It was March, and the spring season was at its full bloom. The light drizzles shrouded the city with mist, and the land had dampened due to the continuous pitter-patter of raindrops.In Jing Cheng, the roof tiles of the the Xu Family\u2019s house had become bright and clear after the rain, creating a glorious and clean texture. Those tiles which were delivered from Yun Zhou and had the semblance of a half-moon. It was said that these tiles would look as if they were illuminated by the glow of fireflies in a bright, moonlit night. The tile-making process was rather complicated, and the tiles came with a heavy price. The price of a whole roof built with these tiles was equal to a common family\u2019s decades of hard work.However, in the capital city, the Xu Family\u2019s satin and silk business was on demand throughout the country, and the price of a whole roof built with half-moon tiles was nothing but a drop in the bucket to them. Master Xu was the prince\u2019s esteemed tutor. He had two sons. His elder son, Xu Zhi Heng was outstandingly talented and was a student at Han Lin Academy. Since young, he was praised by everyone in the capital city of Jing Cheng. When Xu Zhi Heng was eighteen, he was married to a young lady from a family of generals. The He Family\u2019s Second Lord\u2019s first daughter, He Yan, became his wife. The He Family\u2019s Eldest Lord\u2019s first son, He Ru Fei, had been presented the title of General Fei Hong by the emperor himself. The marriage of two people, one with civil virtues and the other with martial virtues, was indeed the perfect union.\u201cFuren, is there anything you desire for?\u201d A young servant girl wearing thin clothes asked with a crisp voice as she handed over a cup of hot tea.\u201cI\u2019m going out for a walk.\u201d He Yan answered and finished the tea in one shot.\u201cBut it\u2019s raining outside\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll use an umbrella.\u201dThe servant girl looked at this young lady. The Xu Family was a family of scholars, and all the ladies here dressed up elegantly, including her mistress, He Yan. However, she had a stingy temperament, which made her incompatible with others. Yet, when she wore the azure blue camlet satin dress, He Yan actually looked very gorgeous, and her heroic and distinct features only emphasized her beauty. Her eyes were clear and distant just like the translucent water of a lake\u2026 Unfortunately, she was blind.He Yan wasn\u2019t blind at birth. Just after three months of her married life, she suffered from a mysterious disease, and had a high fever for two days and two nights. When she woke up the next day, she had lost her eyesight. The Xu Family tried to find highly qualified doctors to return her eyesight, but did not succeed. Since then, He Yan didn\u2019t go out frequently. After all, it was inconvenient for a blind person to go out.He Yan walked towards the arbor located in the middle of the courtyard\u2019s pond.She had been married to the Xu Family for a year. She had lost her eyesight after the first three months of her conjugal life. She then spent the next nine months learning how to live without her eyesight. She adapted well. It was just that she would occasionally miss her life before her marriage, when she could see. Now, she could hear the sound of raindrops making ripples on the pond water. She could listen the red carps in the pond fighting for food\u2026 but she could not see.An unseen spring scenery could still be a beautiful scenery to a person who couldn\u2019t see.Maybe it was because she lost her eyesight too soon that she couldn\u2019t remember Xu Zhi Heng\u2019s appearance very well. All she could remember was the Xu Zhi Heng she had met when she was 14. He was a young boy clad in green, smiling warmly as he offered his hand to her. The present Xu Zhi Heng would not offer his hand to her anymore. Even though he treated her gently and politely, she could definitely feel something faintly blocking their relationship.But she wouldn\u2019t tell anyone.Her years of experience in the army had taught her how to deal with a man. As expected, she never learnt how to carry herself like an elegant woman of a noble family. While she was forlorn and bored, she could only see Xu Zhi Heng doting on He yiniang. After that, she had lost her eyesight, but she got back her leisure time. She felt she was fortunate as she would not be able to see those heart-breaking scenes anymore.She sat quietly in the arbor, recalling her years in the army. It was also a fine spring day like today, and it was drizzling too. She had taken a seat in the middle of the soldiers, smiling as she drank a bowl of liquor which heated up her whole body. The very thought of this fond memory filled her with enthusiasm. Suddenly\u2026He Yan held onto the handrail as a burst of sweetness gushed through her throat, and she spit out a mouthful of blood with a \u2018puff\u2019 sound.Someone\u2019s footsteps approached slowly.He Yan asked cautiously: \u201cXiao Die?\u201dNo one answered. The footsteps stopped. He Yan frowned, \u201cYiniang?\u201dAfter a moment, a woman\u2019s voice resounded in her ears: \u201cGood hearing, Furen.\u201dShe felt intrigued, and her sharp and accurate intuition made her take precautionary steps subconsciously. He Wan Ru was always gentle and graceful and didn\u2019t talk to her much. Her sudden arrival, her talking in such an arrogant tone\u2026 it made He Yan feel uneasy.This was absurd. He Yan was never qualified to be the matriarch of the Xu Family and was only an ornament adorning the family. Her uselessness could be emphasized by the fact that she could not stop He Wan Ru from taking her husband away, and more importantly, how could a blind person possibly be a threat? He Wan Ru neither had the necessity nor a reason to harm her.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dHe Wan Ru caressed the hairpin near her temple. It was a gift she had received from Xu Zhi Heng the day before. She withdrew her hand as she suddenly remembered the fact that the one standing in front of her was blind. She said tonelessly: \u201cFuren, you are pregnant.\u201dHe Yan was stunned.\u201cThe doctor who usually checks your eyes took your pulse a few days ago. You are pregnant.\u201dHe Yan was slightly happy but at the same time, she was at a loss. Before she could utter a word, she heard He\u00a0yiniang\u00a0sigh: \u201cIt\u2019s a pity.\u201dA pity?The smile tugging at the corner of He Yan\u2019s mouth faded, as she asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s a pity?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pity you can\u2019t keep this child.\u201dHe Yan snapped: \u201cHe Wan Ru! How dare you!\u201dHer willow-leaf shaped eyebrows frowned, her gaze became as sharp as a blade. Although she was blind, she looked captivating. It even made He Wan Ru\u2019s hair stand on end for an instant. After a while, He Wan Ru composed herself and said: \u201cThese words are not only mine, General He.\u201dAs the words, \u2018General He\u2019 came out of her mouth, He Yan felt pins and needles pricking her scalp.She asked: \u201cWhat do you know?\u201d\u201cEverything I should and should not know. General He, how can the He Family and Xu Family let you stay alive when you keep such a big secret?\u201dHe Yan was speechless.Before having a general like General Fei Hong, the He Family was just like any other noble family in Da Wei, all on the verge of declining. Nineteen years ago, two wives from the He Family gave birth to two children at the same time. He Family\u2019s Eldest\u00a0Furen\u00a0gave birth to He Ru Fei, while Second\u00a0Furen\u00a0gave birth to He Yan.The rank of nobility should have been given to He Ru Fei, but He Ru Fei was frail and the doctors said he would not be able to live past three years. If He Ru Fei died, the He Family\u2019s rank of nobility would be taken back, and the whole family would lose everything it had required centuries to build.The He Family discussed it and made a bold decision. They made He Yan replace He Ru Fei and sent the frail He Ru Fei to live in the temple as He Yan.He Yan grew up using He Ru Fei\u2019s identity. Although she was borne by the second wife, she lived as the child of the first wife. She considered herself a boy ever since she was a kid and showed great interest in learning the martial arts. When she was fourteen, she secretly applied for the Fu Yue Army and gradually gained fame as she fought in the battles, and, consequently, the emperor himself granted her the title of General Fei Hong. It would have been an honorable occasion to meet the emperor himself at the palace.By this time, He Ru Fei, who was sent to the temple to \u2018convalesce\u2019 had returned.He Ru Fei hadn\u2019t died, and instead grew up peacefully till he turned eighteen. He looked agile and graceful, healthy and handsome. Thus, everything was back to its original place.He Ru Fei met the emperor in He Yan\u2019s stead and became the General Fei Hong, while He Yan remained as He Yan. Everything wasn\u2019t as difficult as they thought it would be. To prevent others from finding out this secret, a stipulation was made. He Yan always wore a mask in the public, as no one had ever seen He Ru Fei\u2019s face. Later on, He Yan was arranged to marry the young and talented bachelor student of Han Lin Academy, Xu Zhi Heng, by the He Family.Xu Zhi Heng was handsome and gentle, considerate and polite, and her mother-in-law was never harsh to her\u2014it was a perfect marriage. He Yan thought so too, until today. Yet, the tender mask was being torn off, revealing the bloody truth\u2026 it made one\u2019s heart cold. This situation was even worse than the hardest battles she had fought.\u201cThe decoction you had drunk that made you blind was instructed to be sent to you by the elders of your family. But as you know, the dead tell no tales. If you live, you will be your family\u2019s greatest threat!\u201d\u201cWhen you drank the decoction, the lord was watching you from the next room.\u201d\u201cWhen you die, the Xu Family and the He Family will only feel relieved. Just blame yourself.\u201dHe Yan laughed loudly.Blame her?What was there to blame?Blame her for substituting He Ru Fei for the He family\u2019s benefit? Blame her for being obsessed with martial arts and becoming a soldier? Blame her for killing the country\u2019s enemies and fighting for peace on the battlefield? Or blame her for being granted the title of General Fei Hong by the emperor himself, and letting He Ru Fei accept it in her stead?Blame her. Blame her for being a girl. She could not achieve anything honestly and uprightly for her own name, because she was a girl. She deserved to be sacrificed and to pave a path for the He Family\u2019s son, because she was a girl. After all, she overestimated the He Family\u2019s kindness and underestimated the He Family\u2019s selfishness.And Xu Zhi Heng\u2026 she must have been blind all along to think he was a good person.\u201cWhat are you laughing about?\u201d He Wan Ru frowned.\u201cI\u2019m laughing at you,\u201d He Yan talked in her direction, emphasizing each word: \u201cYou are so ridiculous that you make me laugh. I will die because of this secret, and what makes you think you\u2019ll live since you keep this secret too?\u201dHe Wan Ru sneered: \u201cYou are still so obstinate when you are facing death! Guards\u2014\u2014\u201dSeveral guards appeared and in a matter of seconds encircled He Yan.\u201cFinish her off!\u201dA fragile willow branch could still be a weapon. It could be as soft and as flexible as a woman\u2019s hand. It was clearly a light and young twig with tender green shoots on it, yet it was like a sword embroidered with flowers, easily brushing away the enemy\u2019s weapon.He Wan Ru had heard of General Fei Hong before\u2014she was aware that this woman was brave and skillful in warfare unlike any other normal woman, but she had never thought that the rumors could be true until she saw He Yan fight with her own eyes.He Yan was blind, but she could still take on ten people by herself. She kicked away the guard in front of her, as if she was planning to break through this ghastly backyard, mount on a horse, and leave before anyone could stop her.However, she suddenly fell from midair, like a wild goose shot by an arrow. The blood she spat out splattered on the grass, like small spots of wild flowers.That cup of tea\u2026 the tea her maid, Xiao Die gave her\u2026 it was probably the cause\u2026She had lost her vision, and now she lost all her five senses, one by one. She had been a person truly blind to the cruelty of life, losing the battle she had fought so desperately before.They did this foolproof preparation, just to kill her.\u201cFools! Do it now!\u201d He Wan Ru yelled anxiously.He Yan wanted to raise her head but someone hit her leg hard from behind. She felt excrutiating pain on her knees and heard something snap. Her legs tottered, making her knees bend. The next moment, someone punched her from behind.The fists that hit her felt like raindrops falling hard on her, making her viscera hurt like hell.They wouldn\u2019t hurt her with swords and blades, they wouldn\u2019t leave a trace of evidence on her body.Someone pulled her hair, dragging her towards the pond, and pressed her head into the pond brutally. Her eyes, nose, mouth and neck submerged in the water, making her unable to speak. She realized that she was drowning in the pond water and she struggled to get back up, but the surface of water was getting away from her, bit by bit. Suddenly, it was as if she was back in her homeland. While she was in a tranced state, she could hear the old folksong, the song she had sung when she was with the army\u2026 she could hear everyone reading books out loud in their own local accents\u2026 and He Wan Ru\u2019s voice, filled with panic.\u201cHelp! Furen is drowning\u2014\u201dShe wanted to go home.However, now she knew the truth\u2014she was homeless.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Outdoors, it was raining cats and dogs.However, the house was warm inside. The fire was crackling excitedly. Steam rose up from the medicinal herbs which were being boiled with a \u2018glup, glup\u2019 sound.A young girl was seated in front of a copper mirror. The mirror reflected a thin and slightly pale face. The owner of the face looked sick and languid. Her lips were pressed together like a water chestnut and revealed a delicate but alienated look. The pair of black, watery eyes shaped like apricots looked just like a mountain stream shrouded with mist, which would reveal a magnificent gem when the mist dispersed. Her skin was as white as snow and her facial features were fair and elegant. She was an attractive young lady of sixteen.Needless to say, she was aware of her own beauty. Different varieties of rouge, gouache, perfumes, and hair balms covered her little dressing table. The whole room reeked of the smell of cheap cosmetics. He Yan wrinkled her nose and couldn\u2019t help but sneeze.The copper mirror was enveloped with the film of hoarfrost she had exhaled, making the reflection in the mirror a little vague. He Yan was absentminded for a moment as she reminisced the past. She recalled the time she had first removed her male disguise. She had sat in front of the mirror, just as she did now, gazing at her own reflection and feeling like she was looking at a complete stranger.She knew that she had been drowned in the Xu Family\u2019s pond by the men He Wan Ru had brought, but when she opened her eyes later, she had become He Yan. Not He Yan, the real General Fei Hong and He Ru Fei\u2019s little sister or He Yan, the wife of Xu Zhi Heng. This was He Yan, the daughter of the owner of a dilapidated hut. He Sui, the father of this body\u2019s original owner, was a ninth-grade town gate officer without any duty.Both had the same name\u2014He Yan, but their statuses were totally different.\u201cYan Yan, why didn\u2019t you call me when you woke up?\u201d A hoarse voice was heard as the portiere was lifted. A man walked in, bringing the cold wind in with him.He Sui was a bearded, middle-aged man. He had dark skin and was square-jawed. He was large, like a bear, clumsy yet strong. His face revealed a fawning smile. When he was reassured that there was no one else in the room, he yelled: \u201cWhere the hell is Qing Mei?\u201d\u201cQing Mei went to pick herbs.\u201d He Yan answered softly.The burly man scratched his head and said: \u201cOkay, then let daddy help you pour.\u201dThe white porcelain medicine bowl was smaller than the man\u2019s palm. The man obviously knew that, so he poured the decoction extra carefully. The room was suddenly filled with the medicine\u2019s bitter scent. He Yan looked at the plum blossom pattern at the edge of the bowl, then set her gaze at the man\u2019s face. This was He Yan\u2019s father, the town gate officer, He Sui.\u2018Daddy\u2019. To He Yan, this was an unfamiliar word.Her biological father was He Yuan Liang, the second lord of the He Family, but she called him \u2018uncle\u2019 because she had already replaced He Ru Fei at that time. In reality, her adoptive father was He Yuan Sheng, her real uncle.He Yan was never close with her adoptive father in the first place. It became worse\u2014it wasn\u2019t wrong to say that it even dropped to freezing point the moment she had said that she wanted to learn martial arts. Her adoptive father only started favoring her when she gained name and fame and got praised by the emperor himself. Her adoptive father never knew what she was thinking of and wasn\u2019t even interested in providing her with basic necessities like food and water. He Yan always thought that this was because he wasn\u2019t her actual father, but her real father wasn\u2019t really close to her, either. He Yan came to the conclusion that it was because \u2018a daughter who\u2019s already been married off is like spilt water\u2019. As time passed, the little affection that remained between them faded away, and he didn\u2019t bother to even take a look at her.Her father figure was only a vague memory to her, compared to He Yan\u2019s friends in the army.He Sui had finished pouring the decoction into the bowl and carefully scooped away the residue floating on top. He blew it gently and brought it towards He Yan\u2019s mouth to feed her.He Yan took hold of the bowl and said: \u201cI\u2019ll do it myself.\u201dThe man withdrew his hand and said, clearly awkward: \u201cAlright.\u201dAs smoke curled up from the decoction, He Yan stared at it with hesitation. It reminded her of He Wan Ru\u2019s words before she had died.\u201cThe decoction you had drunk that made you blind, was instructed to be sent to you by the elders of your family!\u201dThe elders of the He family. Was it He Yuan Sheng? Or He Yuan Liang? Or someone else? Xu Zhi Heng definitely knew about it, and what about the others?She recalled the day she was drowned and that cup of tea Xiao Die had given her. Who knew if this was done by someone who harbored evil intentions towards her?Seeing He Yan holding the bowl without moving, He Sui thought that she wasn\u2019t drinking the medicine as it was too bitter. He coaxed her with a gentle smile: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, Yan Yan. It\u2019s not bitter, after drinking it, you will recover at a faster rate.\u201dHe Yan didn\u2019t wait for He Sui to finish his sentence, instead, she moved the bowl close to her mouth, and drank it all in one shot.\u201cWait\u2026\u201d He Yan placed the empty bowl on the table before He Sui finished his sentence.\u201cIt\u2019s hot\u2026\u201d He could only continue his sentence after He Yan finished drinking.\u201cIt\u2019s not hot,\u201d He Yan answered tartly.He Sui didn\u2019t know what to say at that moment. He only moved his mouth and finally exhorted softly:\u201cRest well here, don\u2019t be naughty and refrain yourself from running around. Daddy will be heading off to the drill fields now.\u201d Saying this, he took the empty bowl and left.Only when He Yan was left alone in the room, did she feel relieved. At present, she was a female and more importantly, she was acting like one. She wasn\u2019t a spoiled young lady who had grown under the loving and protective wings of her family. Thus, this little chat had made her feel very uncomfortable.The maid, Qing Mei, had not yet returned. He Sui didn\u2019t earn much every month. He was just a town gate officer and had no duties assigned to him. He didn\u2019t really have any power either and was barely able to make both ends meet with the salary he earned. The whole household was only supported by He Sui\u2019s salary. A part of it became a maid\u2019s earnings and the rest\u2026 it probably was in the form of He Yan\u2019s table of cosmetics.He Yan stood up, then walked to the door.Her current body was soft and weak, like corneal ulcer and white jade. To her, this was something she was totally unfamiliar with. She couldn\u2019t protect herself with it. If there was anything useful in this body, it was this pair of clear and bright eyes which helped her to see daylight again.Thud! He Yan heard something heavy fall. She turned her head and saw a young boy unloading a pile of firewood from his shoulder.The young boy looked as if he was around the same age as He Yan. He wore azure blue waist clothing and a pair of pants of the same color. He tied his legs with white cloth as it was more convenient for him while working. His skin was slightly dark, and his facial features were a little like He Yan\u2019s, obviously delicate. His chin was slightly narrow, giving him a look filled with patience and determination. He seemed stubborn and arrogant.This was He Yan\u2019s little brother and He Sui\u2019s youngest child, He Yun Sheng.He Yun Sheng had visited He Yan a few times when she was bedridden. He came to give her water and move the stove, but he never uttered a word to He Yan. The relationship between these two siblings did not seem to be good, but\u2026 He Yan looked at the crudely manufactured and unfitting piece of clothing He Yun Sheng was wearing, then looked at her own clothing\u2014a pink based blue satin skirt\u2026 she vaguely understood the situation, but it awed her at the same time.In her original He Family, women sacrificed themselves for men and these men meant the whole world to them. However, in her present He Family, things took a different turn. They treated their own son as if he was adopted and gave every valuable item to the girl child. What in the world was wrong with this family?He Yan stood in front of He Yun Sheng and did not move an inch. He Yun Sheng carried the pile of firewood to the eaves, then started chopping.This family was incredibly poor, thought He Yan. There was only a maid to look after the whole family, and the only son of the family was doing a manservant\u2019s job.The pile of wood was right in front of He Yan. He Yun Sheng chopped it for a while, then stopped and frowned: \u201cPlease give way, you are blocking me.\u201dHe didn\u2019t even want to call her \u2018sister\u2019.He Yan stayed still, neither moving away nor ridiculing him harshly like the original owner of the body always did. He Yun Sheng couldn\u2019t help raising his head, meeting He Yan\u2019s gaze.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Don\u2019t pick on me.\u201d\u201cIf you continue chopping like this, you won\u2019t get it done until midnight.\u201d He Yan didn\u2019t move.Seeing her being so obstinate and disrupting his work infuriated He Yun Sheng. The axe with which he was chopping slid from his hands and landed on the blue stone floor with a bang. He took a step forward, and growled: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you getting sick and useless, our father wouldn\u2019t have sent the manservant away. You may not know, the money with which father paid the manservant was used for your treatment. You understand clearly that I will not get this job done until midnight, so stop bossing around since you don\u2019t know how to chop wood, either! Oh, if you think you are so good at it, go ahead and do it yourself!\u201dHe Yan fretted\u2026 so this household did have a manservant who was sent away because they needed the money to get her a doctor. This young boy had to do the manservant\u2019s jobs in his stead. Seeing his little faced flushed with anger, He Yan knew he had been carrying a grudge against her for quite some time. He continued rambling on without wasting a second to catch his breath.Yet, there were certain advantages of being poor. For example, there was no one in the courtyard to see the awkward situation between the two siblings. If it was the He or Xu Family, the maids might have already crowded to enjoy the show.After finishing his long speech, He Yun Sheng waited for He Yan to stamp her foot and start swearing, but to his surprise, this time He Yan refrained herself from doing so. Instead, she bent down and picked up the axe he had thrown to the ground.She was nearly pulled down by the weight of the axe and her thin wrist looked shockingly weak, as if it could not even withstand the weight.He Yan stared at her hand and frowned slightly. This body couldn\u2019t be used to even lift up an axe. Compared to her previous body, this one was too frail and fragile.He Yun Sheng was stunned by her action. He asked doubtfully: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll show you how to chop,\u201d He Yan answered.He Yun Sheng was even more annoyed when he heard that. \u201cStop fooling around, you\u2026\u201dA loud \u2018thud\u2019 sound interrupted his words.He Yan had already lifted the axe and chopped a piece of wood neatly into two.\u201cSee,\u201d she explained gently, \u201cIt\u2019s easy. You cannot hold near the blade because it will take more effort to chop the wood. You have to hold the axe firmly at the end of the handle, like this\u2026\u201dHe Yun Sheng gave her a blank stare. In an instant, his face flushed, with a voice filled with anger, he pointed his finger towards her and shouted: \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026 you\u2026! I know you carry ill intentions towards me! Your hand\u2026 father will definitely scold me when he sees it! He Yan, you are really malicious and treacherous!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d He Yan was puzzled. The next moment, a young female voice sounded, full of panic, \u201cMiss, you\u2019re bleeding!\u201dHe Yan subconsciously lowered her head only to see her palm all torn up. Her heart stirred at the sight of those distinctive blood stains.She only used an axe to chop a piece of firewood and her hand was already torn? Just how weak was this body? The eldest young miss of the He Family had never even moved a finger to work, what was she made up of, cotton and tofu?He Yan was lost in her thoughts. The maid, Qing Mei, had rushed over to pull her inside the house.She spoke in a hurried tone: \u201cWe should apply some medicine on it first, who knows if it will leave a scar behind\u2026\u201dHe Yun Sheng glared at her hatefully and left saying: \u201cHe Yan, keep being phony and it will lead you to death sooner or later.\u201d Then, he turned and ran away.He Yan didn\u2019t know if she wanted to laugh or weep, throughout her previous life and until today it was really the first time someone had used the word \u2018phony\u2019 to describe her.She felt rather strange. To a General, \u2018phony\u2019 was a distant word.Qing Mei let He Yan\u2019s hand rest on her knee as she applied the medicine on her palm carefully with her own fingertips. Her tears fell freely as she said: \u201cWhat if you leave behind a scar? We need to think of a plan to buy some scar removal cream.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d He Yan couldn\u2019t bear seeing a girl cry, especially a girl of around fifteen or sixteen, a beautiful girl who was younger than He Yan in her past life. She comforted her: \u201cLet the scar be, the important thing is to recover.\u201dQing Mei\u2019s eyes were wide open; she even forgot to dry her tears. She stared at He Yan without uttering a word.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? He Yan asked.\u201cN-Nothing.\u201d Qing Mei wiped away her tears and stood up: \u201cIt\u2019s fine if Miss isn\u2019t angry about it.\u201dThis kind of tone\u2026 He Yan looked at the table full of cosmetics and jewelry and suddenly comprehended the situation. The original eldest young miss of the He family was someone who was proud of her beauty. Her flawless skin seemed to be taken care of so well that even a small cut on it could turn the household upside down.Did God give her such a fragile body, a body which could not withstand any suffering, to let her experience a girlish life she hadn\u2019t in her past life? After all, she had led a manly and rough life in the past.Qing Mei said: \u201cMiss, let me pour you a cup of hot tea, it had just stopped raining, and you might catch a cold.\u201d\u201cWait,\u201d He Yan stopped her, \u201cAfter waking up, I seemed to have forgotten a few things\u2026\u201d She looked at Qing Mei and asked cautiously: \u201cHow did I get sick in the first place?There was a manservant before, but he was sent away in exchange for the doctor. It meant that she was not sick at birth. Plus, after waking up she did not feel uncomfortable or sick anywhere. Yet, everyone in this household treated her as if she was something fragile and delicate, as if she was prone to accidents. He Yan had a strange feeling about this.Qing Mei was scared out of her wits when she heard her question. She grabbed He Yan\u2019s hands, her tears freefalling again: \u201cMiss, you\u2019ve already been upset on Fan\u00a0gongzi\u2019s account once, so please don\u2019t do it again! Even if it\u2019s not for you, please take your beloved father and brother into consideration.\u201dFan\u00a0gongzi? A man?He Yan asked: \u201cWho is Fan\u00a0gongzi?\u201d\u201cMiss, what do you mean\u2026? Oh yes, Fan\u00a0gongzi\u00a0was so ruthless, he was clearly not the right match for you, it\u2019s good for Miss to forget about him. I won\u2019t mention Fan\u00a0gongzi\u00a0again, I only want Miss to lead a content life.\u201d Qing Mei wiped her tears again after she finished talking.This little maid really liked to cry much for no particular reason; the newbies under her command hadn\u2019t even cried much during their first battles. Now, her maid\u2019s clothing was already wet, if she continued to cry like this, she might even flood this place up.\u201cAlright.\u201d He Yan said helplessly, \u201cThen we shall not mention him, go and change now, your clothes are already wet.\u201dQing Mei looked disbelievingly at He Yan, seeing He Yan so calm and composed, she said hesitantly: \u201cThen I shall go change, please wait for me, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Saying this, she finally left.The room was silent again.He Yan extended her hand and opened her palm.The medicine Qing Mei had applied for her was still on her palm. She looked at her slender and delicate hand in a daze. A girl\u2019s strength was obviously lesser than that of a boy. In her past life, ever since she was young, she would slip out of the backdoor before the sunrise.She would then climb Mount Jing Cheng Dong Huang, to reach the temple at the top where she would carry water and chop wood with the monks just to increase the strength of her hand. Her skin had torn several times the first few days, but it became better as her hand gradually gained strength. She was then able to lift two buckets of water easily and also practice shadow boxing with stones tied to her wrist.She had to use cheap tricks to increase her strength. The process did not complete overnight, only after a long period of time was she qualified enough to fight with a man.But now, she was back to square one. Forget about regaining everything she had lost; with this fragile and delicate body she wouldn\u2019t even be fight the thorny dead end she was heading to.\u201cThen I\u2019ll train,\u201d He Yan told herself, \u201cJust like the old days.\u201d This may be a test God had given her, as a price for her rebirth. There was nothing to be afraid of.It was only starting everything from scratch.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The morning sun shone brightly in the sky. The blue stones in the courtyard felt warm under the sunlight, and the grass was lush and green.At the rooster\u2019s third call, He Yan woke up. Qing Mei was flabbergasted when she found out that He Yan was not on her bed. She looked for her everywhere and only felt relieved when she saw He Yan sitting on the stone pier in the courtyard.\u201cMiss, why did you wake up so early? Did you feel cold because of the thin blanket?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, I just couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d He Yan said.She never had the habit of sleeping. When she had been in the army, she could never let her guard down. Every night, she had to stay alert each moment and be wary of the enemies\u2019 raids. Plus, she had been learning the martial arts since a young age and was used to waking up herself at the roosters\u2019 calls. After marrying to the Xu Family, she was taunted by others due to this habit. However, she started getting up late after she was blinded, because to her, there was no difference between day and night. She still woke up when the rooster cawed, but only got out of the bed when she heard the others getting up.Or else, she would seem to be incompatible with the others.\u201cWhere\u2019s father?\u201d she asked.\u201cMaster has already left for the drill fields. Young master just woke up too. Miss, please change your clothing and have some breakfast.\u201d After finishing the sentence, Qing Mei ran into the kitchen.There was only one maid and the household had no shortage of work to be done. The little maid could always use a helping hand.When He Yan arrived in the dining hall, He Yun Sheng was already seated at the table. He had just started eating.His clothing looked no different from the one he wore the last day. He dressed like peddlers and manservants and was not in the least worried about his clothing. When he heard He Yan entering, he just glanced at her, looked away, then picked up his bowl to eat porridge.The breakfast lain on the table consisted of some simple congee and a few side dishes. It was obvious that the He Family could not afford exquisite dishes. However, there was always a plate of light refreshments. These were specially made for He Yan by He Sui and were tasty and aromatic.He Yan picked up her bowl to finish the congee. She finished her meal quickly, which astonished Qing Mei and He Yun Sheng. Before she was bedridden, He Yan used to be a picky eater. She refused to eat simple dishes and would only complete her meal after a long time. They couldn\u2019t fathom what was going on with He Yan today. She had finished eating quickly and didn\u2019t bother to immediately have the light refreshments which He Sui had specially prepared. Those dishes were solely made for He Yan and neither Qing Mei nor He Yun Sheng could touch them.He Yun Sheng put the bowl on the table and stood up. He Yan raised her head and asked: \u201cWhere are you going?\u201dHe Yun Sheng frowned: \u201cWhat?\u201d While he stared at her impatiently, he got a glimpse of He Yan\u2019s palm and his stance softened.He was sure that He Yan would complain to He Sui about her torn palm. Nothing had occurred today and it seemed He Yan didn\u2019t drive a wedge between him and He Sui. He Yan probably did not let He Sui know about her injury.His tone had softened as he spoke: \u201cI\u2019m going uphill to chop wood.\u201dHe Yun Sheng was positive that He Yan would not be interested in what he had said. She would go back to her room to fiddle with her cosmetics, and then go out for a walk after dressing up beautifully. To his surprise, He Yan\u2019s eyes suddenly brightened and she said cheerfully: \u201cReally? I will tag along too.\u201dHe Yun Sheng was dumbstruck. He wanted to tell her off, but Qing Mei forestalled him: \u201cMiss, what are you going to do there? It had rained yesterday hence the road will not easy to trudge on and there will also be mud splattered everywhere. You might slip on it and fall down.\u201d\u201cShe is right.\u201d It was rare to have a person with common sense in this household, so He Yun Sheng continued her sentence without waiting for her to finish: \u201cDon\u2019t go looking for trouble.\u201dBoth He Yun Sheng and Qing Mei thought that He Yan had said this on a whim, but He Yan turned to Qing Mei and spoke: \u201cFather will be on the drill fields all day long, and would only return at night. Qing Mei, you have so many chores to do so it might be disadvantageous for you to always follow me. He Yun Sheng,\u201d She called out He Yun Sheng by his name causing him to shiver: \u201cIf you don\u2019t bring me, I\u2019ll go by myself.\u201d\u201cHey!\u201d He Yun Sheng was instantly mad.\u201cIs there a third person who can take care of me in this room?\u201d She asked slowly.He Yun Sheng was speechless. This single sentence of He Yan\u2019s left no room for questions. When did she become so smart? Not to mention a third person in this house, there was no one in the whole wide world who could take care of her. Their father, He Sui doted on her excessively, which made He Yan rather spoiled. She would never listen to anyone\u2019s words, oh, maybe it would be different when it came to that Fan Gongzi.\u201cJust do what you want to!\u201d He Yun Sheng was exasperated. \u201cIf you fall down anywhere and snivel at me, I won\u2019t take you back home!\u201dHe Yan shrugged.He Yun Sheng stomped out of the room. He couldn\u2019t understand why He Yan had become more and more vexing after recovering from her illness. If the old He Yan had been a bad tempered girl who was pretentious and cutesy, the present He Yan was a rogue who was even more difficult to deal with.She really was his one and only foe!*The road towards Mount Long Huan\u2019s peak was rugged. The terrain was very dangerous and mostly poor people came here to chop wood and pick herbs.There were nameless wild flowers growing by the side of the road, very appealing as they appeared in the grass. However, this wasn\u2019t a road leading to a place where people could go for a stroll and enjoy the beauty of wildflowers. There were sharp protrusions everywhere on the road. Merely the sight of these could make one\u2019s legs tremble.He Yun Sheng had walked on this road many times before; he knew it wasn\u2019t easy to go up the hill. He waited for He Yan to grumble and cry, but He Yan was mute as a fish the whole time.He Yun Sheng couldn\u2019t help but turn back his head. Amazingly, He Yan was not far from him, as she was almost reaching his side.How was this possible?!This road was already strenuous for a man to tread on, not to mention a delicately pretty girl like He Yan, who had to stop for a while to rub her knees just after covering a little distance. When did she have this stamina?\u201cWhy are you looking at me?\u201d He Yan was a little edgy under his keen stare, \u201cHave we reached our destination?\u201dHe Yun Sheng turned back his head without saying anything and continued walking.\u2018It must be an act of hers; she would fall flat on her stomach any minute now!\u2019He Yan glanced at her legs and sighed.The strength of these legs was really insufficient. She had only walked a stretch of road with He Yun Sheng and was already fatigued.\u201cWe have reached.\u201d He Yun Sheng stopped in his tracks and took down the axe tied to his waist.There were a number of small trees there. All the wood He Yun Sheng chose were thin and small as it was more convenient for him to chop them down. He pointed his finger towards a huge rock beside He Yan, \u201cSit there while I work; I\u2019ll be to chopping wood for two hours.\u201d\u201cIs it here?\u201d He Yan asked. Then, she took down the cloth sack she had been carrying.He Yun Sheng\u2019s mouth fell open as He Yan took out an axe from her cloth sack.\u201cYou\u2026 y-you\u2026 w-what are you doing?\u201d He Yun Sheng\u2019s mind went blank. He couldn\u2019t even speak out his sentence clearly.He Yun Sheng had thought that He Yan was bringing a bottle of water and had wondered why she needed a huge cloth sack for that. But then, she was always this stupid, and He Yun Sheng had no idea how her mind worked. As it turned out, she had been carrying an axe the whole time?!What happened next made He Yun Sheng feel assured that he was dreaming.He watched as this weak sister, who usually thought that a simple teacup was too heavy for her, lifted the axe without hesitation and, with a single swing, chopped the wood perfectly into two. Her actions were neat and swift, as if she had done this job a thousand times before.She turned her head, smiled at him, and said: \u201cLet\u2019s finish this job,\u00a0together.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He Yun Sheng wanted to reject at first, but the sweet fragrance had already crept into his nose. Seeing He Yan lowering her head to bite her own, he also reached out his hand to grab the one she had offered him.He took a bite; his taste buds had never experienced such a sweet flavor. He Yan was never the generous type and had kept all good things to herself.Seeing that he was delighted to have it, He Yan put the rest of the dish in his hands and said: \u201cI\u2019m full. You can eat the rest.\u201dHe Yun Sheng was awestruck.There were only two children in the He Family. When he was a youth, He Sui used to be a guard who delivered stuff to Jing Cheng Capital. He had rescued the daughter of a scholar from the cruel hands of bandits. She was the scholar\u2019s only daughter and He Sui was an orphan. To show his gratitude, the scholar offered his daughter\u2019s hand to He Sui.The scholar and his wife passed away due to an epidemic. He Furen was depressed and did not last long. She died of grief when He Yun Sheng was only three, leaving He Sui and his children behind.He Sui and his wife had been deeply in love. He Yan was the miniature form of He Furen. Maybe it was because of this, He Sui favored He Yan. Even though the He Family wasn\u2019t wealthy, He Sui tried his best to fulfill all of He Yan\u2019s wishes. Over time, He Yan became more spoiled and snobbish; at least that was what He Yun Sheng believed.However, after she recovered from her sickness, her actions became incomprehensible; He Yun Sheng didn\u2019t know how to face her anymore.\u201cYou come up here to chop wood every day?\u201d He Yan asked him, \u201cWhat do you do in the afternoon? Don\u2019t you go to school?\u201dHe Yun Sheng was just a year younger than He Yan. He was fifteen this year, and the children at this age ought to be attending school.\u201cAfter I return home, I make Da Nai1\u00a0cakes and sell it under the shed after noon. Forget about school,\u201d He Yun Sheng said with a wave of his hand, \u201cYou already know that our family isn\u2019t wealthy. I have some knowledge in a few subjects and I am not bent on learning the martial arts.\u201dEven though he spoke carelessly, He Yan could clearly see the regret and desire he tried so desperately to hide from her in his eyes.She paused and then asked: \u201cWhat do you plan to do in the future?\u201d\u201cWhat are you asking this for?\u201d He Yun Sheng asked doubtfully, but he answered He Yan\u2019s question after a moment, \u201cI go to the drill fields every day. I can become a part of the backup armies of the town after I pass the tests in the future. In time, I\u2019ll get promoted to an officer rank. At that time, I can earn money.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it? An officer without any duties?\u201d He Yan smiled, \u201cI thought you wanted to do something worthwhile.\u201d\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d He Yun Sheng quipped: \u201cYou want me to become someone like General Fei Hong? Although we have the same surnames, he\u2019s in a much higher level compared to us.\u201dHearing this name come out from He Yun Sheng\u2019s mouth all of the sudden, He Yan was stunned. She was silent for a while before asking: \u201cYou know General Fei Hong?\u201d\u201cOf course I do! Who in Da Wei doesn\u2019t? General Fei Hong brought peace to Xi Qiang and General Feng Yun stopped the barbarians. Since then, no one dared to attack our country, Da Wei! The chivalry, fame, and bravery of the two young men! If I could be like one of them, it\u2019s even worth dying for.\u201d\u201cPfft!\u201dHe Yun Sheng was exasperated: \u201cWhat are you laughing for?\u201d\u201cBut someone who only chops wood and sells desserts can\u2019t be like them. General Fei Hong and General Feng Yun did not succeed by simply going to the drill fields.\u201d\u201cI know that.\u201d He Yun Sheng\u2019s face was red, \u201cBut I\u2026\u201dWhich young man does not desire to succeed? He Yun Sheng was a hot-blooded youth. Living a pitiful life such as this was truly holding him back.He Yan said: \u201cStarting tomorrow, I\u2019ll follow you uphill to chop wood and sell desserts.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d He Yun Sheng jumped up from the stone, \u201cHe Yan, are you out of your mind?\u201dHe could understand that what happened today was due to a sudden whim of hers, but doing this every day\u2026 Did He Yan spoil her brain after getting sick?Not waiting for He Yun Sheng to talk again, He Yan stood up and brushed away the dust on her: \u201cSince we\u2019re done eating, we should start working. Time is money, brother.\u201dHe Yun Sheng: \u201c\u2026\u201d*After the spring rain, it was bright and sunny for the next ten days.Qing Mei had something bothering her lately. Back then, Miss He had always commanded her to do this and that, making Qing Mei unable to leave her side, but now\u2026 she couldn\u2019t even find a trace of He Yan now.He Yan went out with He Yun Sheng in the day; when Qing Mei wanted to serve her and help her bathe at night, she would dismiss her straight away. The only help the miss needed from her was to comb her hair every morning.Qing Mei was worried, since Miss doesn\u2019t need her anymore, would she be like the other manservant sent away by He Sui, if this continues?Another person who had something in mind is He Yun Sheng.For more than a month, He Yan had followed him to chop wood at Mount Long Huan, and she even got up earlier than him. Not to say, she also tied sandbags on both her hands and legs while climbing the mountain. He Yun Sheng weighed the sandbag secretly, it was definitely very heavy. He wondered why He Yan brought such things up the hill to chop wood every day.She never once complained, as if she never got tired. However, He Yun Sheng had seen her palm, exposing her delicate skin that was torn several times. She never paid attention to her wounds and just wrapped white cloth around them.The benefits of doing this were obvious. Because, after half a month, He Yan could walk and chop wood faster than him. He Yun Sheng wondered if those sandbags were magical. If yes, should he secretly tie two up?With two people chopping wood, the work was completed quickly. With the extra time, both of them could make more cakes. Well, He Yan was a girl, it wasn\u2019t advantageous for her to show her face at work. He Yun Sheng alerted her about this, but He Yan didn\u2019t seem to mind. He Yun Sheng\u2019s head ached with frustration; if He Sui became aware of the fact that He Yan went up the hill to chop wood and sell cakes outside with him, he would definitely be subject to whiplashes.Fortunately, He Sui didn\u2019t know.He Sui not only did not know about it, but also seemed to be happy every day, because his son and daughter, who usually were apprehensive about each other, had become closer these days. Because of this, he got the chance to sit together, eat, and chat with them a little. He Sui was so satisfied with it that he became more affable towards the new troupes on the drill field, because, well, he had a harmonious family.Right now, He Yan was sitting in front of her dressing table.Qing Mei gave her veiled looks.Ever since He Yan recovered, she didn\u2019t like looking at the mirror or fiddling with her cosmetics. Now she was suddenly interested in them, which made Qing Mei nervous. The household experienced financially tough times now, if He Yan wanted to buy a new lipstick at this time, there was not enough money.He Yan played with the fragrance powder and hair balm on the table, her head aching a bit. These things had been used before, so they couldn\u2019t be sold to earn money. She searched through her belongings again and found some hair pins and jewelry.They were all made of silver, the color more ordinary compared to the ones she owned in the Xu Family, but there was no other way now.She took out all the jewelry she found and handed them to Qing Mei.\u201cPawn these in a pawn shop; these are tough times, not even a single penny should go to waste.\u201dQing Mei\u2019s eyes widened: \u201cBut\u2026 but\u2026\u201d\u201cWe are poor now.\u201d He Yan explained to her with sincerity, \u201cWe can\u2019t eat jewelry.\u201dShe had to pawn her jewelry and get some money. It would be better to obtain enough money for He Yun Sheng to study in a school.Since she occupied the body of the young miss of the He family, she at least needed to do something for her family. He Yan could only satisfy her own wishes after helping the He family out of their misery.For example, settling an old score.1\u00a0Da Nai \u2013 A kind of dessert from the Song Dynasty.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We won\u2019t be able to find good spots later.\u201d\u201cI had things to do.\u201d He Yan answered: \u201cIt\u2019s fine if we don\u2019t get a good spot, our cakes are good enough.\u201dHe Yun Sheng was rendered speechless.For him, talking to He Yan was like punching cotton, you couldn\u2019t express your anger even if you wanted to. He Yan wasn\u2019t easy to provoke and had a carefree attitude. He Yun Sheng couldn\u2019t tell if she was being optimistic or na\u00efve. It had been a long time since He Yun Sheng saw He Yan feel distressed about something.The shed was put up at the western part of the town where vendors did their various businesses. It was located in front of the biggest restaurant in Jing Cheng, Restaurant Zui Yu. There were a number of people and the vendors were making profits. However, the shed wasn\u2019t very big, therefore, they had to go early to get a good spot that could attract the attention of the passersby.He Yun Sheng took out the Da Nai cakes from the wooden utensil.The Da Nai cake was a popular dessert. Fresh plums without skin and seeds were used to make this cake. These white plums were first scalded and mixed with licorice soup briefly. Then, the gaps were filled with honey, walnuts, olive, pine nuts and pumpkin seeds. Lastly, the ingredients were steamed. The cake was generally sweet but also tasted a little sour. These cakes were not very expensive and were a favorite among the commoners. By selling Da Nai cakes, He Yun Sheng was able to contribute to the income of the He family.When the summer sun shone and the weather was pleasant, people would stop to buy one or two cakes from time to time. By the sunset, they could finish selling the cakes.Watching He Yun Sheng work, He Yan had to admit that He Yun Sheng was very capable. It reminded her of those new recruits in the army. These young men who joined the army usually were from poor families. The rich families were unwilling to let their children fight in the battlefield. The poor people joined the army only to feed themselves and their families. They had to do something to survive.Although she hailed from a noble family, she lived that way.\u201cHey, give me one\u2026 Isn\u2019t this Miss He?\u201d A voice interrupted He Yan\u2019s train of thoughts.He Yan looked up to see a man with a long face standing in front of her. His hair was combed neatly and sparkled in the sunlight. His facial features were ugly and repulsive. In his nondescript white robes, he looked rather sly. He raised his hand wanting to hold He Yan\u2019s shoulder, but she dodged away.The man looked disappointed, but his expression was cheerful when he said: \u201cIt has been a while, Miss He. I was wondering why you didn\u2019t come out of your house these days. So it seems you are busy selling cakes with your brother\u2026 Isn\u2019t it tiring to do such things, Miss He?\u201dHe talked as if he and He Yan were best friends.He Yan was puzzled, so she looked at He Yun Sheng. He Yun Sheng was furious and snapped: \u201cWang Jiu Gui! Leave my sister alone!\u201d\u201cYou little brat, your sister doesn\u2019t mind it, what are you nagging about?!\u201d After finishing his words, the guy called Wang Jiu Gui approached He Yan again with a smile, took something out from his sleeves, and gave it to He Yan: \u201cYoung Miss He, I\u2019ve been having fond dreams about you lately. See, I bought a rouge not long ago to gift you. Since I happened to meet you here today, I\u2019m giving it to you now. And so, do I have the pleasure to invite you for a walk by the Si Waterfront?\u201dHe looked like a loser, but ironically acted like a handsome guy, so much that He Yan wanted to laugh. She had met many people in her past life, both good and bad, but someone who dared to mock her in public? None.\u201cI want to sell cakes, so I can\u2019t go for a walk with you.\u201d He Yan politely declined, \u201cAnd this rouge, please give it to someone else.\u201dWang Jiu Gui was stunned.He lived on the same street as the He Family. At first, others dared not provoke He Yan as she was the daughter of a government official. However, He Yan was never satisfied of her lifestyle and coveted bigger things. Usually when he bought her cosmetics, she would coquettishly call him \u201cBrother Jiu Gui\u201d, but now she made him lose face in front of everybody.Wang Jiu Gui felt that he was being disgraced, so his smile wasn\u2019t sincere anymore: \u201cIs Miss He still thinking about Fan\u00a0gongzi? Fan\u00a0gongzi\u00a0is getting married soon\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d Before Wang Jiu Gui could finish his sentence, he got a tight slap and fell on the ground with a \u2018thud\u2019 sound.A young boy of fifteen was like a half-grown calf, full of power. Wang Jiu Gui\u2019s body was weak because of overindulging himself in wine and women, so how could he be He Yun Sheng\u2019s opponent? His face hurt like hell and his whole body was hot with embarrassment. He stood up after scratching and scrambling on the floor, and then looked at He Yan. She didn\u2019t seem to consider apologizing to him, and even watched the whole seen unfold, full of interest. Anger welled up inside him.\u201cYou two\u2026\u201d He pointed a trembling finger towards the duo.He Yun Sheng shielded He Yan, blocking her from his sight and sneered: \u201cWhat\u2019s with us?\u201dWang Jiu Gui didn\u2019t dare to step forward, he mumbled: Didn\u2019t these two have a bad relationship? He Yan usually complained about He Yun Sheng to him while He Yun Sheng never cared about He Yan, why are these two together today? And why did He Yun Sheng stand up for He Yan?\u201cYou two wait and watch!\u201d He stomped his foot and ran away.The crowd dispersed and the shed was silent again. He Yun Sheng set up the stalls with a gloomy face, not saying a word.He Yan peeked at him.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d He Yun Sheng asked peevishly.\u201cThe punch you did just now was not bad.\u201d He Yan said pensively, \u201cThe only problem is, your legs under the belt are unstable, your basics aren\u2019t strong enough and you need to train yourself on standing on tiptoes and clenching your buttocks.\u201d\u201cShush!\u201d He Yun Sheng didn\u2019t want to continue talking about it anymore, \u201cYou\u2019re not a martial arts officer.\u201dHe Yan looked at He Yun Sheng; he was talented and could be molded to a good soldier. Maybe it was because he did heavy chores since he was a kid. Needless to say, he was much better compared to the young masters of the \u2018He Family\u2019.He shouldn\u2019t be here selling Da Nai cakes, he ought to go to school and train himself in the martial arts hall.\u201cThen I\u2019ll change the topic, who is Fan\u00a0gongzi?\u201dHe Yun Sheng slammed his fist on the table and glared at her, \u201cYou dare to talk about it?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s with Fan\u00a0gongzi?\u201d He Yan gave him a puzzled glance.Talking about \u2018Fan\u00a0gongzi\u2019 made He Yun Sheng furious. \u201cWhy? If it wasn\u2019t because of him deceiving you, how would you have been fooled by him? That playboy seduces women all around and only you will believe in him. When you heard that he was getting married, you went on a hunger strike, wanting to die for him. But him? He\u2019s still busy marrying a new girl! Look at you, you\u2019ve become the joke of Jing Cheng. Now you\u2019re still mentioning him? Do you want to drive me mad?!\u201dHe Yan got the rough idea about the whole situation just through these few words.The eldest miss of the He family was a spoiled brat. Her heart was higher than the sky, how could she be willing to live as a lowlife? She wanted to marry to a noble family and become a noble herself. One day, she met a young man from a rich family when she was out for a walk, and the two of them secretly fell in love with each other. However, He Yan\u2019s love for him was unrequited and the young man just played with her feelings. A rich young man would never marry a daughter of a non-duty officer.Fan\u00a0gongzi\u2019s family had found him a partner from a rich family; they would be a perfect match. But would Miss He give up on him that easily? She went to his house to demand an explanation, but was swept out immediately. She couldn\u2019t accept it and went on a hunger strike. As she was dying, He Yan woke up and replaced the eldest miss of the He family.No wonder everyone in He Family treated her with extra care after she woke up; they might have thought that she would try to commit suicide again.He Yun Sheng was still babbling about her, saying she was a fool, but he didn\u2019t know his real sister was not in this world anymore. He Yan felt regret and disappointment for the previous Miss He. Her only mistake was that she fell in love with a man who deceived her and sacrificed her life for him. One\u2019s life is valuable and should not be wasted for men like him. Plus, the one who cheated her lived happily although she passed away, leaving the ones who truly loved her in pain.Inflicting pain on her loved ones and bringing happiness to her enemies\u2026 what did one achieve by doing this? Death.Her experience was similar to Miss He\u2019s; both of them were cheated and betrayed by others. However, she and the Eldest He Miss were different. He Yuan Sheng, He Yuan Liang, He Ru Fei and Xu Zhi Heng and even He Wan Ru\u2026 She would find them one by one and get back all the things she had lost because of them.She poured her blood, sweat, and tears to attain this goal.Every morning, she tied sandbags to her limbs and climbed the mountain to get back her power. She sold cakes in the afternoon to find out news about the He and Xu families from various people.This was what the townsfolk said: The blind He Furen drowned to death because of an accident, Master Xu was so aggrieved that he became very sick. Old He Master was very sad about this ordeal and his hair turned white in a night. General Fei Hong loved his sister very much so he managed her funeral himself and it was held for three days and three nights.This news may have been real or fake but they entered He Yan\u2019s ears like snowflakes and she only smiled.The truth was hidden and He Yan had to reveal it. To accomplish that, first, she must survive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The shadow on the wall reeled right and left due to the candle. He Yan looked at the little bit of money in front of her and asked: \u201cThis is all?\u201d\u201cI had already asked the shopkeeper to give me more money,\u201d Qing Mei answered with difficulty: \u201cBut the shopkeeper said that he couldn\u2019t give more money for those jewelry.\u201dHe Yan nodded, \u201cYou can go now.\u201dQing Mei left.He Yan picked up the little amount of money bit by bit and put them in her palm. Looking at the two broken bits of silver, she felt as if her heart was breaking together with it.When she was in previous He Family, money was never a problem. Even if she was in short of money, she could simply pawn her jewelry and jade pendants to get a huge sum. There was no need of money when she was in the battlefield. When she came back to Jing Chen, she was rewarded a large sum of money and valuables by the emperor. This amount was enough to fill up a few of He family\u2019s courtyards.Just a little bit of General Fei Hong\u2019s reward would help the He family come out of its crises. But she could never go back to her previous He family.He Yan heaved a deep sigh. She finally understood the meaning of the saying: \u201cA penny beats a hero\u201d.Nothing could replace money. He Yan also wanted to go to the drill fields. She could strengthen her body a little by climbing the hill, but that was not enough. If she wanted to really become as strong as her previous self, she needed to engage in direct combat with people, shoot arrows, and ride horses. However, He Yan was unsure if He Sui, who loved his daughter more than his life, would agree to this.She blew off the candle and went to bed. No matter what, she had to leave tomorrow.*The next day, after chopping wood and going back home, He Yun Sheng planned to sell cakes.He Yan watched He Yun Sheng fill the bamboo utensils with cakes. She asked: \u201cAre you sure you\u2019ll finish selling all these cakes?\u201d\u201cThe weather is warm and sunny and the market is bustling.\u201d He Yun Sheng answered: \u201cWe will finish selling in a short amount of time.\u201dHe Yun Sheng worked hard for his family. His knowledge on business seemed awe-inspiring to He Yan, so she patted his shoulder and said: \u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201dHe Yun Sheng\u2019s body stiffened. He Yan\u2019s actions, it was really\u2026\u00a0manly.It was early when they reached the shed, hence there weren\u2019t many vendors. The two of them found a good spot near the streets and started to take out the Da Nai cakes one by one.It was early April, the warm sensation of summer slowly vanished as the sun gradually went down. The Da Nai cakes tasted both sweet and sour and also had the pleasant fragrance of plums. It was the best time to have these cakes. Just as He Yun Sheng predicted, the business was going well. He Yun Sheng wrapped the cakes while He Yan dealt with the transactions. They were as busy as bees when, all of a sudden, a bunch of men burst in with Wang Jiu Gui in the lead.Wang Jiu Gui slammed his fist hard on the table. The crowd moved back, not wanting to get involved in this scenario.He Yun Sheng was fearless and snapped: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cWhat am I doing?\u201d Wang Jiu Gui snorted, \u201cYou thought I would let the matter go after you beat me up yesterday?\u201dHe Yun Sheng rolled up his sleeves. His face was cold as he said: \u201cYou want to fight? I\u2019m right here.\u201d\u201cBastard, you got some guts!\u201d Wang Jiu Gui took a step back. The people who were crowded behind him advised He Yun Sheng, \u201cYoung man, don\u2019t be too rampant!\u201dHe Yun Sheng didn\u2019t bother to move. At the same time, He Yan yelled: \u201cStop!\u201dHe Yun Sheng and Wang Jiu Gui both turned to He Yan.Seeing He Yan, Wang Jiu Gui smiled and said: \u201cThis little kid is immature, but since he\u2019s your brother, I\u2019ll give him some respect. If Miss He is willing to accompany me for a short walk, we would stop this dispute right here.\u201d\u201cI see, your filthy mouth can\u2019t even utter decent language!\u201d He Yun Sheng was furious.\u201cWait a minute.\u201d He Yan gripped He Yun Sheng\u2019s hand. He Yun Sheng wanted to wrench his hand from her grasp, but he couldn\u2019t do it. Even though he tried hard, his wrist remained in her firm grasp. He Yun Sheng was startled, when did He Yan gain so much strength?\u201cIf you have anything to talk about, don\u2019t do it here. You\u2019ll scare the people.\u201d He Yan said lightly: \u201cLet\u2019s talk there.\u201d She pointed far away, to a deep alley near Restaurant Zui Yu.\u201cNO!\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201dHe Yun Sheng and Wang Jiu Gui yelled at the same time.He Yun Sheng spoke anxiously: \u201cYou\u2019re a girl, how could you go with them\u2026 These people are thugs!\u201dWang Jiu Gui smiled: \u201cIt seems like Miss He is more sensible than you. Let\u2019s go, I even brought a present for you, Miss He\u2026\u201dHe Yun Sheng wanted to stop her, but He Yan suddenly whispered in his ears: \u201cDo you think chopping wood every day on the hills won\u2019t reap us any benefits? Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll be back after a cup of tea\u2019s time.\u201dThe young girl\u2019s voice was soft and gentle, with a faint smile in it. He Yun Sheng was stunned as he watched He Yan following Wang Jiu Gui and his cronies.He Yun Sheng wanted to go after her, but he stopped in his tracks as he remembered what He Yan had told him.This time, he would believe her. A cup of tea\u2019s time. If she did not return by then, he would go look for her.At the same time, He Yan and Wang Jiu Gui walked towards the alley.Above the alley was Restaurant Zui Yu\u2019s wine shop. They could faintly hear the melodious music coming from the shop. He Yan had been looking forward to going to that place for a long time, but she couldn\u2019t do it. After she had come back to the capital, she never got a chance to visit. In the eyes of the populace, she was a girl and was forbidden to go to such places.\u201cSister He,\u201d Wang Jiu Gui approached her with a hippie smile, \u201cWhat did you want to tell me?\u201d\u201cMy brother.\u201d\u201cHe\u00a0shaoye*?\u201d Wang Jiu Gui was taken aback, but he quickly regained his composure and smiled brightly. With a wave of his hand, he said, \u201cI won\u2019t do anything to him, you know that.\u201d He then proceeded to take out a blue colored powder box and extended his hand to caress He Yan\u2019s face, \u201cYou\u2019re the only one in my heart, and we\u2019ll be a family in the future\u2026\u201d*shaoye (\u5c11\u7237): young masterA piercing scream escaped from his mouth before Wang Jiu Gui could finish his words.Inside Restaurant Zui Yu, the strings of the musical instruments stopped for a second. This created a disarray of musical notes, which sounded like a scratch on a beautiful jade piece. Someone asked with curiosity: \u201cWhat\u2019s that sound?\u201dThe edge of gauze curtain was lifted up by a fan handle. The tea cup was delicate, but the slender fingers that held it were way more delicate.He Yan released her hand. Wang Jiu Gui\u2019s arm fell nimbly at his side and his face was filled with horror. He Yan smiled slightly, then raised her arm. That blue colored powder box hit Wang Jiu Gui\u2019s head and his face was covered with white powder.\u201cThanks for your gift, but I happen to be allergic to cheap powders. Remember, don\u2019t give me these things next time.\u201d\u201cBitch! Beat her up!\u201d Wang Jiu Gui howled in pain but did not hesitate to make the men behind him take a move.The young lady heard his words and smiled, as though she had heard some joke. Her laughter was as crisp as the mountain spring. She seemed to be jovial as the breeze blew her skirt. She had jet-black hair and skin as pale as snow\u2014coupled with her large and bright apricot eyes, she merely looked like an attractive young lady out for a walk.But the words she uttered sent shivers down Wang Jiu Gui\u2019s spine.She rubbed her wrist and smiled slightly: \u201cYou better not regret it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He pinched his thigh with great force, and then yelped \u2018ouch\u2019 out of pain.It didn\u2019t seem like a dream.But if this wasn\u2019t a dream, how could he explain all this?In a short time, the men he had brought were scattered on the ground. The initiator walked to the stone steps while brushing off the dust on her clothes. Wang Jiu Gui looked at her incredulously. He Yan turned to him, her eyes bright and clear, making the hair on his body stand on end.He had never seen He Yan acting so high and mighty.He Yan never behaved this way. She was beautiful, mean and rather vain, obsessed in gaining advantages from others through unfair methods. A girl like her was a common sight in Jing Cheng Capital. These kinds of girls aimed for a higher rank in society but never managed to achieve it. The fortunate girls could enter rich households as concubines, while the unfortunate ones could only marry commoners and lead plaintive lives. He Sui raised his daughter like a rich miss of a noble household. Wang Jiu Gui knew for a fact that He Yan had never touched sharp and pointed objects in her life. She may have played musical instruments or painted pictures, but her delicate hands had never beaten up people like this.Yet, just now, Wang Jiu Gui witnessed how this pair of hands clenched into fists and threw a strong man to the ground with a single punch. He recollected how he howled in pain when He Yan had caught his wrist. Her fingers were sharper than an axe.Wang Jiu Gui desperately wanted to sob.Before he could even think of a way to beg for mercy, that young girl walked towards him.\u201cGrandma! Have mercy on me!\u201d His rational thoughts vanished into thin air, and Wang Jiu Gui blurted out: \u201cI failed to use my eyes, please be generous and forgive me!\u201d\u201cFrom this day forth, don\u2019t give me any presents.\u201d He Yan said gently, \u201cI don\u2019t like them.\u201d\u201cAlright! Alright! Alright!\u201d Wang Jiu Gui said \u2018alright\u2019 more than once, afraid that He Yan wouldn\u2019t believe him. He added: \u201cIs there anything you want me to buy for you?\u201d\u201cThere is no need for that. Haven\u2019t you heard the saying \u2018sow nothing, reap nothing\u2019?\u201d He Yan smiled. \u201cWe are neighbors. I would appreciate if you don\u2019t try to pull any more pranks.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, yes.\u201d Wang Jiu Gui answered gratefully.\u201cHowever, I have something to ask of you.\u201d He Yan said.After a while, He Yan left the messy alley with a light heart as the burly men on the ground moaned in pain. She walked away quickly, not knowing that after she left, someone from one of the floors of Restaurant Zui Yu released the fan on his hand, covering the messy place below with gauze curtain.A man with an enthusiastic voice laced with laughter said, \u201cWhen did the girls in Jing Cheng become so brave and fierce? Uncle, is this the reason why you neither want to make an engagement nor get married soon?\u201dHis question wasn\u2019t answered.That person pressed on, \u201cUncle, do you want me to find out which family that young girl belongs to? If she\u2019s strong enough, you could take her in as a female guard under you. Late at night, she could also accompany you\u2026\u201dSomeone\u2019s fingertip lightly tapped on the table and sent a tea cup lid flying accurately into his mouth with a \u2018swoosh\u2019, rendering him speechless.\u201cHmm, hmmmm\u2014\u201d That person revolted unwillingly.\u201cIf you talk one more word of nonsense again, I\u2019ll throw you down from here.\u201d A lazy, unconcerned voice stopped his counterpart from making any complaints.The place was silent again.The sound of strings plucking the song \u2018Liu Guang\u2019 flowed throughout the room, covering the spring scenery outside the window. They continued drinking tea. Someone mumbled the word \u2018stingy\u2019, but the notes of the music soon overlapped his voice.*He Yun Sheng was relieved to see He Yan returning without a scratch.\u201cAre you alright? Where are Wang Jiu Gui and his men?\u201d He Yun Sheng asked, as he hadn\u2019t caught a glimpse of Wang Jiu Gui.\u201cI cleared the misunderstandings by reasoning and enlightened them with my affection, hence they left the place. They informed me that they would come to apologize another day and would not commit such atrocities ever again.\u201dHe Yun Sheng was not fully convinced.If Wang Jiu Gui could be persuaded merely by reasoning, he wouldn\u2019t be called Wang Jiu Gui. Yet, He Yan didn\u2019t seem to want to continue talking about it. She had returned safely and soundly, so He Yun Sheng didn\u2019t give it much thought. He was only a young boy, after all.At night, after having dinner, He Yan pulled He Yun Sheng aside just as he was about to go to sleep.\u201cWhat?\u201d He Yun Sheng was slightly annoyed.\u201cDo you have any clean clothes?\u201d He Yan asked.He Yun Sheng was momentarily confused.\u201cI just want to check if there are any clothes to be mended.\u201d He Yan explained, \u201cI\u2019ll sew them for you tonight.\u201dHe Yun Sheng\u2019s face grew pale with disbelief.Since the day he was born, He Yan had never told him that she wanted to help him mend his clothes. Instantly, an unfamiliar feeling of warmth spread through his heart. He hesitated before asking: \u201cHave you ever touched a needle or thread?\u201dHe knew very well that He Yan had no skill in needlework. This was handled by Qing Mei.\u201cYou\u2019re looking down on me,\u201d He Yan said.\u201cOf course, I am. How could I not?\u201d He Yun Sheng replied tartly.He Yan slightly pushed him: \u201cWon\u2019t you bring your clothes to me? Come on\u2026\u201dHe Yun Sheng brought a pile of clothes, just as he was told. He Yan grabbed all of them and was about to head over to her room when she heard He Yun Sheng\u2019s hesitant voice: \u201cJust let Qing Mei sew those clothes.\u201d\u201cHow good is Qing Mei be compared to me? Go to bed, you have to wake up early tomorrow.\u201d He Yan said.After dismissing He Yun Sheng, He Yan went to her room to select a few pieces of clothes. She finally found a round collar with narrow sleeves and a maroon-colored long coat. He Sui clearly spent most of his earnings for his daughter, leaving He Yun Sheng with cotton and breeches. Only this long coat seemed proper, even though it seemed to have been previously worn by others, its color faded.Her build was similar to He Yun Sheng\u2019s, therefore, his clothes fit her perfectly. She then proceeded to comb her hair to a man bun and slid in a stick she had plucked from outside. She painted her skin darker and drew her eyebrows to make them thicker. He Yan looked at the mirror, which reflected the figure of a youthful, young boy.He Yan was an expert cross-dresser in her previous life. She was sure that her secret hadn\u2019t leaked in the past few years. She had no problem disguising herself as a boy in her current life, either. If she had proper clothes, she could have easily dressed herself as a handsome young man. In these flimsy clothes, she looked like a young master from a declining noble family.She paced back and forth in the room and only sneaked out to the courtyard once she was confident about her disguise. She leaped with agility along the walls and walked to the streets.Jing Chen Capital had no curfew at night, and the streets were rather lively and bustling. He Yan pranced through the brightly lit places, eagerly listening to the tunes drifting from the luxury boats and the shouts of vendors. Spring was in the air, and this night view signified prosperity.She had not been able to go for an outing from the moment He Ru Fei returned to the He Family. She then married to the Xu Family, consequently losing her eyesight.Such picturesque sceneries, full of life and activity, had moved further and further away from her in her past life. But tonight, as the cool wind blew from the lake, she regained all of them back. She was free again.She was truly grateful to God for providing her with another opportunity.Not far away from Jing Cheng\u2019s Restaurant Zui Yu, outside Ming Guan, girls who were as tender and as beautiful as flowers were busy receiving customers.This wasn\u2019t a place for nobles to drink and dine. This was the largest and the most popular gambling house in Jing Cheng, Le Tong.He Yan\u2019s footsteps stopped in front of Le Tong, the great gambling house.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 9": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth of a Star GeneralCH 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDICETranslator: SyrenEditor: marchmallowAt the doorway of the Gambling House, a girl wearing a flower hairpin stopped He Yan and sweetly spoke: \u201cGongzi, this is a gambling house.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d He Yan nodded, slid out a broken piece of silver from her sleeve, and shook it in front of the girl\u2019s face, \u201cI\u2019m here to gamble.\u201dThe girl was reluctant, but He Yan already marched inside before she could even utter a response.Outside the casino, girls known as \u2018gambling prostitutes\u2019 stood to usher people in. Those who came to Le Tong Gambling House were mostly wealthy, and these girls could easily identify people\u2019s status by their silvers\u2019 worth. Those that looked lowly were asked to leave. Firstly, the poor people gambling inside weren\u2019t pleasing to the eyes and sullied the embroidered carpets. Secondly, they cared too much about their silver that they were stubbornly intent on winning. Once they lost, they wailed and howled, insisting to repudiate their debts, hampering the rich people\u2019s interest to gamble.He Yan was obviously not from a rich family just based on her worn-out clothes. However, her persistence to enter made the gambling prostitute helpless.Noise and shouting surfaced from within, and everyone\u2019s faces were red. The people who won were satisfied, while those who lost were unwilling and tossed out stacks of money, yelling: \u201cAgain!\u201dAs He Yan roamed around, she thought: it was not a lie when people said that gambling houses and whorehouses were money-squandering establishments.Earlier, after teaching Wang Jiu Gui a lesson, she had asked him which gambling house was the biggest in Jing Cheng. A street thug like Wang Jiu Gui was naturally well-informed. As expected, Wang Jiu Gui answered: Le Tong Gambling House.He Yan had never been to a gambling house. Before joining Fu Yue Army, her special identity had hindered her from traveling around, much less visiting a gambling house crowded with people. After joining Fu Yue Army, winning battles, and returning to Jing Cheng, He Ru Fei had reappeared. Her identity as the daughter of the He Family\u2019s second branch was restored, which rendered it even more impossible for her to explore such places. Thus, where gambling houses were located, she had no knowledge of. This was her first time.Nearly everything was in Le Tong Gambling House: pai gow poker, bouncing chess, Chinese chess, fighting grass, fighting cock\u2026 they all dazzled her. In her heart, she was excited but also regretful. A pity she had no idea how to play any of those.Someone was guessing dice. He placed the dice into a bowl and guessed the dice point. This game was the easiest and had the most onlookers and participants. A huge amount of money streamed down after each game, dazzling He Yan\u2019s eyes. Her mouth curled into a smile.The He Family was very poor, but He Yun Sheng needed to go to school and train martial arts. The jewelry He Yan had pawned didn\u2019t amount to much, so she was momentarily unable to afford a private tutor. Even though they made and sold Da Nai cakes daily, saving up adequate amount of silver would still take a long time. So, He Yan decided to test her luck at a gambling house, earning bit by bit. Although quite risky, at the moment, she couldn\u2019t care less.\u201cHey brother, why are you blocking us? Don\u2019t just stand there if you ain\u2019t gambling.\u201d The surrounding people pushed He Yan around, their eyes laced with disdain.What was the point of a poor person coming to a casino? Wasn\u2019t it better to use his money to buy new clothes instead? Ugh, it truly provoked disgust.He Yan could only reply: \u201cGamble.\u201dThe people around donned on gold or silver\u2014they were either wealthy or noble. The sudden appearance of a poor young boy had stolen their attention. He Yan fished out the only two silver pieces from her sleeve and put them on the table.Someone ridiculed: \u201cLittle kid, you better think it through. This isn\u2019t a play. I see you have no other money with you, so don\u2019t gamble, or you\u2019ll cry when you lose. Others won\u2019t give back your money!\u201dThis kind of situation was a common occurrence. Gambling was addictive\u2014the more you lost, the more you gambled; and the more you gambled, the more you lost. After suffering continuous losses, some would regret, especially after using their land and family to pay off debts. If they failed to pay, workers of Le Tong Gambling House would throw them out.They gazed at He Yan with pity. Poor people in Le Tong Gambling House would never become wealthy.He Yan smiled slightly: \u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s just a play.\u201dThe people laughed loudly. Whether their laughter contained amusement or mockery, no one knew.The dice was put in the bowl and inverted. The dealer shook it left and right, the rattling of the dice crisp and clear. The sound was like a melody amidst the crowd\u2019s lively chatter, with men\u2019s rough voices resurfacing vaguely from time to time.It reminded He Yan of those years in the army.Joining the army\u2014from a low grade soldier to lieutenant general, and then from a lieutenant general to a general\u2014she had gained everything with her flesh and blood, with no aid from the He Family.It was bitter and cold at the border, and there was no entertainment. The men in the army couldn\u2019t stand it and started gambling in secret.He Yan would always punish them with the army law, but she really had no way of dealing with the jubilation that occurred behind her back. He Yan was helpless about this and thus created a rule: they couldn\u2019t gamble with money, but they could use other things like a chicken leg, a piece of solid food, or fur.They never had the intention to gamble, but the boredom was unbearable. It was their only form of entertainment when they weren\u2019t either training or fighting on the battlefield. He Yan didn\u2019t want to deprive them from it, and she was eventually enticed to join them. Sometimes, when He Yan had the interest, she would gamble once or twice, but lost badly every time.She nearly lost every little bit of her things, but she wasn\u2019t mad. It was just that people were proficient in different fields, and not everyone was good at gambling.The crispy sound of the dice stopped, and the dealer slammed the bowl down and looked at her.\u201cBig,\u201d He Yan said.\u201cOpen\u2014\u2014\u201dThe bowl was opened. Two dice lay silently on the table, making everyone hold their breaths. They eyed the dice. Two of them, one number five, and one six. It was indeed big.The people were slightly astonished. After a moment, the guy who ridiculed He Yan guffawed: \u201cYou are in good luck! Go take these money and buy some new clothes.\u201dA few silver pieces were pushed toward He Yan.He Yan pushed them back.People looked at her.\u201cAgain,\u201d she smiled.\u201cBrother, you better stop when you earn. It\u2019s already quite good to win once.\u201d This was a kind advice.Someone couldn\u2019t stand it and said: \u201cHey, you\u2019re quite arrogant, little kid!\u201d\u201cHe really thinks he\u2019ll always be that lucky? Hahaha, kids are naive!\u201dVoices of ridicule, persuasion, and mockery rang in her ears from all directions, but He Yan\u2019s gaze remained fixed on the two dice.He Yun Sheng needed to attend school and train martial arts with a private tutor. Qing Mei couldn\u2019t finish all the work by herself, so the He Family had to hire a manservant. After some time, the rainy season would come, and the roof at the He residence was short of a few tiles, so leaking would be inevitable\u2026 they desperately needed money.She intended to collect news about Xu Zhi Heng and He Ru Fei, which also required money.Money, it didn\u2019t have to be a lot, just enough, but also not too little. Otherwise, when the urgency arose, it would be really difficult.\u201cYou sure?\u201d The middle-aged man who shook the dice soothed his beard, his smile kind and gentle.He Yan returned a polite smile.\u201cAgain.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Not long after, someone deposited their jade pendant on the pile. He Yan stood out as a youthful lad who had stolen the attention of onlookers, and the place was soon crowded by merry-making people.\u201cBig.\u201d\u201cOpen\u2014\u2014\u201d\u201cGongzi, please choose.\u201d\u201cSmall.\u201d\u201cOpen\u2014\u2014\u201d\u201cAgain.\u201d\u201cOpen\u2014\u2014\u201d\u201cAgain.\u201d\u201cOpen\u2014\u2014\u201d\u201cAgain.\u201d\u201cOpen\u2014\u2014\u201dA huge pile of coins and jewelry were stacked in front of He Yan. Those who laughed at her minutes ago simultaneously shut their mouths, as they could now tell that she wasn\u2019t a mere rookie at gambling. Had it not been for Le Tong\u2019s cast-iron reputation, people would have come to the conclusion that this situation was a scam she and the dealer had cooked up to astound the outsiders.Outside the casino, the sound of the night watch faded. He Yan stood up and said: \u201cThe dawn is near, it\u2019s time for me to return.\u201d\u201cGongzi,\u201d a bearded old man smiled slightly, \u201cJust gamble one more time. How about changing the method?\u201dHe Yan raised her eyebrows and looked at him: \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cWe won\u2019t gamble based on big or small dice anymore. You seem to be an expert, so guessing the number on the dice should be easy for you, right?\u201d He pushed the piles of jewelry and money on the table to the center, \u201cIf you win, all these will belong to you.\u201dHe Yan glanced at the money on the table.She had gained a lot through this little expedition and was well aware that she had attracted the attention of many individuals. When she was in the army, she had heard a rumour that the casinos in the capital were involved in a number of shady deals. She knew it was time for her to put a stop to gambling, but for some reason, the memory of He Yun Sheng eagerly talking about going to school floated to her mind. She looked at the coat she was wearing\u2014it was the only coat in He Yun Sheng\u2019s possession, and it was rather worn out.\u201cAlright.\u201d She had made her decision.There was an instant uproar amongst the onlookers due to the surging enthusiasm.Guessing the number on the dice and guessing whether the results were big or small were two entirely different matters.Guessing the answers \u2018big\u2019 and \u2018small\u2019 was only a matter of luck. However, precision and accuracy were required to guess the numbers on the dice. Once you made a mistake, you couldn\u2019t rectify it, and there were infinitesimal chances of winning this. There was also the fact that the dealer shook the dice rather vigorously.He Yan also pushed all her money to the center of the table.If she lost, everything she had done today would be for naught. On the other hand, if she succeeded, the amount she would obtain would be more than enough to cover the He Family\u2019s expenses and He Yun Sheng\u2019s tuition fees for five years.Watching the situation unfold like this, everyone added their money: \u201cI\u2019m in too!\u201d\u201cThese are my coins; I bet this brother will win!\u201d\u201cHow could that be? I\u2019m betting the opposite, hahaha!\u201dA game with heavier bargaining chips would have more spectators. Getting rich in a night or losing everything in a night was more entertaining than watching Jing Cheng\u2019s best theatrical troupe performing.As the bearded old man slowly held up the bowl, the whole casino went silent. It was as if they could only listen to the sound of the dice shaking in the copper bowl.He Yan\u2019s mind went blank.She was never good at gambling. At least, that was the case until she returned to Jing Cheng and was married to the Xu Family. After her marriage, she had played poker with the\u00a0furens\u00a0of other families in banquets, but she lost badly every time. Those times, Xu Zhi Heng would smile at her warmly and lightly mock her: \u201cHow could you be so silly?\u201dXu Zhi Heng would rarely show his mischievous side to He Yan. He Yan had assumed that she learnt how to make Xu Zhi Heng show that side of his more often. She felt genuinely happy about this and made a big decision in her heart \u2013 she would learn this skill no matter what it took and make Xu Zhi Heng proud in the next banquet.Yet, it was a pity that before she could master this skill, she had lost her eyesight.Be it a family feast or a banquet, the Xu Family would never allow a blind person to represent the household. She could no longer step outside, and staying alone at the large manor was rather boring. Hence, she could only learn to listen.Although she was blind, she refused to seek help from anyone, even if it was only to amble idly around. She had always been a competitive person, so she strove to quickly adapt. She familiarized herself with the characteristics of various sounds and then moved on to learning how to distinguish each one. She then practiced to take action, and when she was finally ready, she used a stick for a sword and revised the movements.It was during this time that she had learned to listen to the sound of dice.Dice was easier than poker, He Yan thought. The quainter the movement was, the more challenging it was to her hearing. She listened. Every single side of a die produced a different sound when it fell. She shook dice in a bamboo log then threw them on the table, meditated on the number, and grazed her fingers on the dice to know if she was correct. She frequently made mistakes in the beginning, but the more she practiced, the more accurate she was. She persevered until one day, after guessing the number, she felt the dice and finally smiled.She had done it.The servants in Xu household held private discussions about her, saying how she had gone crazy after turning blind, shaking a bamboo log every day in her room. But they gradually discovered that they needn\u2019t help He Yan anymore, and she could do almost everything herself. She could accurately recognize every servant in Xu Family just by listening to their footsteps, and she knew where each piece of furniture was located.If they didn\u2019t know that He Yan was blind, they would have mistaken her for a person with normal eyesight.Xu Zhi Heng held her hand and praised her for being so capable. He Yan was delighted, yet in her smile, there was an indescribable loneliness that stemmed from an unknown source.Her hearing ability back then had reached the point of perfection. Thinking about it now, she had probably heard the cool and perfunctory note in Xu Zhi Heng\u2019s voice whenever he talked to her, but her feelings made her subconsciously suppress the thought.He Yan lowered her eyes. Of course, the player saw things less clearly.The sound of the dice rattling in the vessel suddenly came to a stop. With a \u2018bang\u2019, the bowl was inverted on the table.One, two. Two dice stayed still.Everyone\u2019s gazes were fixed on He Yan. He Yan closed her eyes. It was as if she had returned to the days in the Xu Family when she\u2019d sat in front of the table, shaking the bamboo log alone, then opening it and feeling the surface of the dice with her fingers.Trying to catch that small ray of light in the darkness.\u201cTwo, five.\u201d She opened her eyes and said.The inverted bowl was quickly lifted, and two dice were reflected in everyone\u2019s eyes.At first, there was a prolonged silence. After a few moments, the sounds of exclamation started one after the other. A young man in brocade clothes grabbed He Yan\u2019s arm and loudly proclaimed: \u201cSuperior! From this day forth, you are my master! Please accept your apprentice!\u201dHe Yan helplessly shook away his hand.The bearded old man\u2019s smile slightly stiffened, but he recovered after a moment. He patted his beard and said lightly: \u201cI will not take back my word. All these treasures belong to you.\u201d He paused and added: \u201cMay I know\u00a0gongzi\u2019s name? May I have the pleasure to drink a cup of tea with you?\u201dHe Yan packed all the money and jewelry and politely declined: \u201cI\u2019m just a kid with no name, it\u2019s nothing worth knowing. It\u2019s already late, let\u2019s drink tea together another time.\u201d After finishing her words, she walked past the crowd and hastily left Le Tong.Some people remained stunned, while some continued to gamble. The bearded old man\u2019s smile remained unchanged as he turned and headed upstairs. Another man followed him. The old man turned to him and commanded: \u201cGo after that lad.\u201dOn the other side, a burly chap pressed his fingers then waved at the guards behind him. They followed him out of the casino.\u201cRunning away after winning my money? There\u2019s no such good thing in this world, fool!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was not a single soul in the alley, only a stray cat occasionally leaping about, its soft sound filling Jing Cheng\u2019s spring night.A young boy gripping a bulging package traipsed through the alley like a ghost.One was innocent, but, a criminal if one held jade. She had won a lot of money in Le Tong Gambling House, which would inevitably attract trouble. If she used the main road, danger might knock on the He Family\u2019s door, and that was the last thing she wanted to happen.However\u2026 the more one feared, the more trouble approached. He Yan stopped.The end of the alley led to a nearby street where most of the shops and taverns were closed, much unlike the lively Le Tong Gambling House. It was eerie and devoid of people. Only the moonlight and twinkling stars illuminated the road.He Yan looked back and crouched down to pick a few small stones. She pondered for a moment, then suddenly turned her head and hurled the stones into the distance.The stones were fast and sharp, like an arrow without its head. With a \u2018puff\u2019 sound, someone fell from the dark area.\u201cStop following me.\u201d He Yan warned: \u201cYou guys can\u2019t catch up.\u201d\u201cThen what if we join in?\u201d A voice replied, followed by a few people stepping out of the opposite end of the alley. The leader was a shirtless bruiser, his hands looking like they could twist He Yan\u2019s neck.\u201cLittle brat, it looks like you have quite a lot of opponents.\u201d That bruiser laughed loudly, \u201cDid no one teach you not to be too striking when you first go to a casino?\u201dHe Yan gathered the money towards her body and answered calmly: \u201cSince it\u2019s my first time going to a casino, obviously no one had ever taught me before.\u201d But she thought in her heart that the people from the casino were really like what her brothers from the army had described\u2014they were not kind people. They broke the rules they, themselves, had made.\u201cYou\u2019re obstinate even when you\u2019re facing death!\u201d The bruiser was livid, \u201cToday I\u2019ll teach you a lesson. I\u2019ll unscrew your arm, let you kneel before me, and have you call me grandfather!\u201dAs He Yan stood in the alley, the bruiser and his men assembled on her front, while a group of unknown stalkers lagged behind. She was surrounded and had nowhere to hide.She wasn\u2019t even armed.\u201cThen let\u2019s just see if you can do it.\u201d She clenched her fist slowly.\u201cArrogant!\u201d The bruiser waved his hand to urge his men forward. He also advanced, and although his skills were lacking, he arbitrarily slung a fist towards He Yan\u2019s back.Under the moonlight, the young boy maneuvered his body downward and skillfully evaded the attack. The bruiser\u2019s eyes were dazzled, then he felt a sharp punch land on his rear. It was like adding oil to the fire. He snarled furiously as he surveyed the area for the young boy, who had already hopped on to the alley walls.\u201cGet him!\u201dThe stalker who followed He Yan understood the situation. Someone grabbed He Yan\u2019s clothes to yank her down. With a \u2018scrzz\u2019 sound, her clothing had torn.\u201cDamn!\u201d He Yan cursed as she deplored, \u201cIt\u2019s spoiled.\u201d\u201cYou still have the mood to worry about your clothes?\u201d The bruiser roared till his nose wrinkled, and was further stimulated, \u201cI\u2019ll beat you to death today!\u201dHe pounced towards He Yan, his large physique akin to a small mountain, causing the ground to quake as he took action. He believed it to be a piece of cake to teach the kid a lesson since they beat him in numbers.However, they kicked an iron plate for the first time that day. Although the young boy looked juvenile in age, he was as agile as a slippery loach that no one could capture. He shuttled through the squad of villains, landing a few but accurate hits on their vital spots as he did so. Not long later, the men lay flat on the ground after successive strikes.He Yan scuffled away from the bruiser\u2019s fist and kicked his abdomen with a whirl of her body. Unfortunately, her actions were a bit crooked.The bruiser immediately howled in pain.\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t do it on purpose.\u201d She was a bit diffident.After all, since this body and her skills didn\u2019t tally well yet, her attacks couldn\u2019t be accurate and precise. The bruiser lurched on the ground as he shielded his lower body, producing a distressing sound that frightened people.He Yan bent her waist to retrieve the money that scattered on the ground. She was occupied the whole night and got involved in a brawl. She refused to let other snatch her hard-earned silver.The moonlight shone on the ground dotted with pieces of silver and jewelry. As the young boy picked them up, he looked as though he belonged to a scene from one of the chapters of a monster fairy myth: A scholar accidentally walked into a mystical wonderland and spotted money and jewelry strewn along the area. He then gave in to temptation and kept them as his own.Thinking about this scene, He Yan felt a bit funny and she started laughing.After collecting everything, she examined the moaning men on the floor. As she motioned to escape, she suddenly heard a soft and gentle voice: \u201cThis little brother, you dropped your money.\u201dHe Yan turned and looked.A young man stood at the door of the closed tavern. He wore an indigo-coloured wide-sleeve robe, his clothes slightly shaking in the wind, outlining his lean body. His dark black hair was tied with a sapphire tuinga. He had long brows and fine eyes, very gentle and refined, slightly like a fairy. He smiled and took a step forward, a small piece of silver resting on his palm, which must have fallen and rolled towards his direction amidst the chaos.She did feel someone\u2019s presence at the tavern, but that someone had arrived earlier and seemed disinteresred to join the fight. She had assumed the stranger to be a passerby, so she chose to ignore but unexpectedly met the person.He Yan had seen plenty of men in her life. In her past life, she had to socialize with men in her male disguise. She mostly came across brawny men like that bruiser, and they couldn\u2019t be considered handsome, not to say beautiful. Xu Zhi Heng was elegant and graceful, and could be counted as good-looking. However, in comparison to the young man across her, he seemed far inferior.As she was gathering the silver pieces just now, she had thought it similar to a scene from a folk tale. Now even more so, where the poor young boy encountered a real fairy and was enchanted by the fairy\u2019s appearance. Would the fairy then teach the boy some sort of special skill?As she ambled closer, she felt that the young man was really like a fairy from a painting. Seeing her in a trance, the fairy spoke again: \u201cLittle brother?\u201dHe Yan pulled herself back.She took the discarded silver piece from his hand and smiled: \u201cThank you.\u201dThat young man replied with a smile, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201dHe Yan turned and left without looking back.She treaded briskly, like a stray cat parading on the walls, gone after a few steps and could not be chased further.In the dark night, someone appeared and walked towards the man wearing blue, whispering: \u201cSi\u00a0gongzi, that boy\u2026\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s most probably just an occasional passerby, don\u2019t mind him.\u201d The fairy smiled. As though recalling something amusing, his smile widened, \u201cHe\u2019s quite clever.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After emptying its meager contents, she filled in the treasure she had earned that night.Perhaps it was because she had won a huge amount of money that night, she was in a good mood and slept soundly. She dreamed of those good, old days when she used to gamble with the soldiers under her. In her dream, the men yelled: \u201cOpen! Open!\u201d Seeing that He Yan was reluctant, one of them laughed loudly: \u201cGeneral, what\u2019s the matter? Did you lose again?\u201d\u201cDid General win even one round tonight?\u201d The Deputy General shook his head, apparently disappointed. \u201cAh\u2026 General isn\u2019t good at this.\u201d\u201cShut it! Haven\u2019t you people heard the saying \u2018the one who loses in gambles wins in love\u2019? Our General may have lost this time but I tell you, he\u2019ll be invincible when it comes to his love life!\u201dHe Yan guffawed when she heard that.As she laughed, she felt someone pushing her. Her eyes fluttered open. Qing Mei\u2019s face appeared in front of her. \u201cMiss, did you dream of something good? You were smiling happily while sleeping.\u201dThe room was bright because of the sunlight flowing in through the windows. He Yan shielded her face from the light with her hand. She was shaken inside. It was the first time she had woken up so late.Spring days were really comfortable for sleeping.She recalled the dream she had. Back then, the men had consoled her saying that her love life would be successful, but they didn\u2019t have any idea how wrong they were. Perhaps she won several rounds last day because her conjugal life was a failure.He Yun Sheng\u2019s indignant voice came from the door: \u201cHe Yan, the sun is already up, aren\u2019t you going to work today?\u201dIt was hard to believe that the person who said this was the same as the one who strongly opposed the idea of her going to work.\u201cWait for me.\u201d He Yan swiftly changed into clean clothing.Just as Qing Mei walked out carrying a basin of water, He Yun Sheng entered the room and said: \u201cWhy are you so slow today\u2026 He Yan?!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d He Yan is busy tying up the sandbags to her limbs as she met He Yun Sheng\u2019s furious eyes. Puzzled, she asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dHe Yun Sheng pointed to the chair: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?! See for yourself what\u2019s wrong!\u201dThere was fury in the young man\u2019s voice. It felt as if he could burn down the entire household just with the fire in his voice. He Yan looked towards the direction he was pointing to. There was the maroon long coat, carelessly crumpled in a chair, the one she had \u2018borrowed\u2019 from He Yun Sheng to go to the casino. After returning, she simply took off the coat and threw to the chair. She hadn\u2019t given it much thought until now.Not waiting for He Yan to respond, He Yun Sheng took a step forward and took a look at the coat. The coat was crumpled up by He Yan, it was also dirty and smudged. Upon closer look, there was a cut in the middle. Altogether, it looked rather wretched.\u201cSo this is what you wanted to sew for me?\u201d Nothing could diminish He Yun Sheng\u2019s raging fury now. To think that he was so touched when He Yan expressed willingness to sew his clothes for him. He had come to the conclusion that He Yan did love her brother but looking at the coat\u2026 she was definitely sent by God to punish him!\u201cThis is a misunderstanding, I can explain.\u201d He Yan tried to calm down the lad.\u201cExplain? How would you explain this? Do you know\u2026\u201d He Yun Sheng\u2019s voice was full of wrath at first, but now, he suddenly choked and his eyes turned red. He said: \u201cThis was my only coat\u2026 you cut it into pieces, what would I wear now?\u201dHe Yan\u2019s head started to ache.He Yan really, really, really couldn\u2019t stand seeing someone cry. Especially when it came to an aggressive, young lad who cried in such a heart-broken manner.He Yun Sheng felt wronged.Young men like He Yun Sheng were rather concerned about their dignity. If they were poor, they could be considered good if they had filial piety and worked hard. Even so, everyone had at least a little bit of vanity. He had worn this coat for many years. When worn, this was the only piece of clothing that made him look like a \u2018young master.\u2019Although He Yan\u2019s clothes could not be compared to those of the rich families\u2019 girls, she did buy one or two pieces of fashionable clothes every year. Since He Sui doted on her excessively, He Yun Sheng could not utter a word of opposition. Girls ought to carry themselves in style and manner, why should boys care about their external appearance?Yet, at this month, He Yun Sheng felt that he was being denied justice.He Yan stammered while speaking: \u201cS-Since this is spoiled, let\u2019s buy another one. We\u2019ll find the best tailors in Jing Cheng to make a new coat for you, one with those embroidered patterns, okay? The cloth used will be the finest too, d-don\u2019t cry, I didn\u2019t do that on purpose\u2026 Alright? Y-Yun Sheng?\u201dHe Yan had never coaxed him with such a soft and gentle voice, so unknowingly, his anger was half gone, but he still held some resentment within him: \u201cWe don\u2019t have a single penny!\u201d\u201cSays who?\u201d He Yan took opened the chest and showed him, \u201cWe have got lots of money.\u201dHe Yun Sheng\u2019s eyeballs nearly dropped out of their sockets. He tried to regain his composure: \u201cWhere did you get the money from?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dThe next moment, He Yun Sheng rushed up to her and said, clearly bewildered: \u201cYour face\u2026\u201dFace? He Yan was startled. Did her face change too? That couldn\u2019t be, she had washed her face thoroughly with the water from the tank outside the house when she returned last night.She walked towards the mirror while He Yun Sheng\u2019s angry voice sounded from behind her: \u201cWho hit you?\u201dThe reflection of the girl in the mirror hadn\u2019t changed. Her brows were as elegant and refined as ever and her pair of watery eyes had the moist gleam of autumnal waves. However\u2026 He Yan\u2019s gaze moved down her face and stopped at the light bruise near her lips. The bruise looked clearer against her fair skin.When Qing Mei had woken up He Yan, she couldn\u2019t see it because He Yan covered her face with her hand. But now, He Yun Sheng obviously saw it.As He Yan\u2019s skin was tender and delicate, it could not withstand anything. She recollected the memories of last night. Someone had hit her on the face but it didn\u2019t hurt a lot, so He Yan put it to the back of her mind. Who knew it would actually leave a mark on her skin.He Yun Sheng kept questioning her: \u201cWhat actually happened? This money\u2026 these clothes\u2026\u201d He was suddenly horrified, then dejected: \u201cYou\u2026\u201dSeeing that this young boy was thinking too much, He Yan lightly hit his head, \u201cHow far did your imagination go? I borrowed your clothes and wore them to a casino last night, gambled a round or two and won the money. Some people came to me looking for trouble so I taught them a lesson and in the process, got hurt. It\u2019s fine, the mark will be gone tomorrow.\u201dShe said it so casually, but she was unaware that her words had made the young boy\u2019s heart tremble.\u201cYou\u2026 I\u2026\u201dHe Yan went to a casino? He Yan went gambling and even won money? He Yan was in trouble and taught them a lesson after winning money?No matter what, He Yun Sheng wasn\u2019t easily convinced. He even doubted that someone had stealthily substituted his sister. (Editor: You are right, boy)Or else, how could he explain the inconceivable things his sister had done?\u201cYes,\u201d He Yan explained calmly, \u201cBecause we\u2019re too poor, I wanted to try my luck out at the gambling house and hit jackpot. Maybe this was God\u2019s will. I was frightened of those people who wanted to harm me, but my strength had considerably grown after climbing the hill and chopping wood with you.\u201d He Yun Sheng was still stunned, so He Yan continued, \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe in what I said, you can go to Le Tong Gambling House to verify the facts. Trust me, I never lied to you.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 but\u2026\u201dHe Yun Sheng was still muddleheaded, but looking at He Yan\u2019s confident expression, his instincts told him that she was speaking the truth.\u201cOh, right,\u201d He Yan smiled, \u201cSince we have money now, we won\u2019t be selling Da Nai cakes anymore.\u201d\u201cThen what will we do?\u201d He Yun Sheng asked, mumbling.\u201cOf course we\u2019re going to the drill fields.

The academy had scholars and martial arts instructors, and he could study together with his fellow students. You could rely on yourself to build a stable career through exams, scholarships and physical examinations. On the other hand, haphazardly trying your luck without any preparation could result in dreadful consequences.In the past, his family had been poor and famished, but now they had money. The repressed aspirations buried at the bottom of Yun Sheng\u2019s heart gradually surfaced.He glanced secretly at the young woman walking beside him. He Yan\u2026. ever since He Yan had recovered, he felt as if many things had drastically improved within the family. He no longer felt as heavy as the treading deep, stagnant water. At some unknown time, a light breeze had swept over the water, creating ripples, such that the old-fashioned attitudes were cleared away, replaced by all the colors of spring.It was spring time.He Yan took notice of his penetrating gaze, and suddenly held her veil to her face. She warned once again, \u201cWe\u2019ve already agreed to not expose anything until we meet father, understand?\u201d\u201c\u2026Fine.\u201d He Yun Sheng replied.He Yan had never once visited the open fields at the military grounds\u2019 East End City Gate. Once she had left the military to return to the capital, He Ru Fei substituted her. Afterwards, she could never attend any \u2018General Fei Hong\u2019-related activities. He Yan could only occasionally pass by when she accompanied Xu great-grandmother on her walks. At those times, she had felt so much yearning.The capital\u2019s military grounds were still very large. The flag was waving in the wind, and sometimes a general officer would scold his soldiers. Since this year was peaceful and prosperous, the grounds had practically turned into an equestrian archery playground for the sons of rich nobles. There were arrows and weaponry scattered everywhere, blocking one\u2019s field of vision.As soon as He Yan arrived there, she couldn\u2019t avert her eyes.In the past, He Yan had a double-edged sword of white-green jade hue with an edge that cut through iron like butter. It was by her side throughout wars and battles for many years, but when she had married into the Xu family, she didn\u2019t bring it with her, and she deeply missed it immediately.He Yuan Sheng\u00a0(He Yan\u2019s adoptive father)\u00a0had told her: \u201cThe Xu family has a scholarly reputation, if you bring your sword there, your husband and in-laws would not be pleased.\u201dHer own father He Yuan Liang was concerned, and pointed out to her, \u201cTo do that is to invite misfortune.\u201dSo she had reluctantly left her jade sword at home, and asked her family to safeguard it well. But when she first returned home after her marriage, the jade sword was hanging from He Ru Fei\u2019s waist.She questioned He Ru Fei, yet when He Ru Fei hadn\u2019t even spoken, He Yuan Sheng intervened, \u201cRu Fei is now General Fei Hong. If his sword isn\u2019t with him, others will doubt him!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. At any rate, you won\u2019t be able to use it in the future,\u201d He Yuan Liang chimed in.It was as if her cheerful mood was entirely washed over by cold water, from her head to her feet. At that time, she finally became aware of the significance of her marriage, of the significance of giving away the title of General Fei Hong. It meant that from here on out, she\u2019d be like the great-grandmother of the Xu family and the first wife of the second branch of the He family\u2014she\u2019d stay at home taking care of domestic duties, supporting her husband in a harmonious marriage. Those swords, warhorses, soldiers, and liberty, the blood-filled triumphs and accomplishments of war, all were subserviently forfeited to another person.Besides, no one understood her feelings.First it was her jade sword, then it was her warhorse, and after that her troops, everything which belonged to her were taken away, one by one. Her past ten years of laborious work, all to become a wedding dress by Xu Zhi Heng\u2019s side.She was devoid of everything.He Yun Sheng asked, \u201cHey, what\u2019s up with you? You don\u2019t look so good.\u201dHe Yan, momentarily lost for words, cleared her mind, smiled and said, \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong.\u201d She looked around her. \u201cHow come we haven\u2019t seen father?\u201d\u201cThey seem to be over there.\u201d He Yun Sheng pointed to the other side of the track. \u201cProbably horse training.\u201dThere were frequently new fleets of horses brought to the military grounds, and some had an unruly temper that refused command, so they needed to be trained for a while. Nowadays, the city gate\u2019s officers were of low competence. It could be said that their skill levels were essentially on par with the sparring partners of the rich sons of nobles that came to the grounds to practice equestrian archery.\u201cLet\u2019s go over there\u2026\u201d He Yun Sheng said.He Yan nodded, but suddenly stopped walking. She took an iron-headed rod from the upper shelves of a weapon rack in her hands.He Yun Sheng asked, \u201cWhat are you gonna do with that?\u201d\u201cJust getting the feel of it,\u201d He Yan replied. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dHe Yun Sheng was speechless. The two walked towards the track by the stables, but when they were not yet close, they suddenly heard a clamour. The two looked over, and two horses swept past them. On one horse sat a well-dressed gentleman, and on the other sat a person similar to a black bear: he was tanned and built robustly. Who was that person beside He Sui?Who was He Sui horse racing with?\u201cThe Childe is so strong!\u201d The faces of the pages sitting by the side were filled with delight. \u201cThree rounds already, and he\u2019s won every one of them!\u201dIt\u2019s already been three rounds? He Yan glanced around and didn\u2019t see anything serious. Upon this impression, she only raised her eyebrows.The horse beneath He Sui probably hadn\u2019t yet been able to go through training yet, upon a look one could tell it had a wild nature and was difficult to domesticate. Its footsteps were particularly uneven; He Sui was clearly managing his balance while riding this horse. That well-dressed childe was intentionally using his own horse to knock into He Sui\u2019s horse, so much so that He Yan noticed it right away. His horsewhip hit the rear of He Sui\u2019s horse.The horse leaped about wildly, and practically threw down He Sui. He Yun Sheng shouted out, \u201cDad!\u201d He was getting anxious.The finely clothed gentleman just laughed.Just as this round finished, He Sui stopped his horse, albeit also with much difficulty, as it was struggling in its place for a while before quieting down.The gentleman had already been helped down from his horse by others, and proudly said, \u201cHe Xiao Wei\u2019s skill is still lacking, he can\u2019t even train a single horse. But you\u2019ve improved compared to the previous match. At least you haven\u2019t fallen and gotten kicked by the horse.\u201dFalling? Getting kicked?He Yan looked over at He Sui, yet she saw a face dripping with sweat, swollen and battered with a bloody nose, with a horseshoe imprint on his shirt, evidently his fall wasn\u2019t light. This guy\u2026 she couldn\u2019t help but feel a little angry.The gentleman\u00a0delightedly threw out a silver coin, \u201cNot bad, not bad, this young master is very happy. This is a reward for you.\u201dThe silver coin fell to the ground, despite being watched by everyone, He Sui bent over to pick it up. He cheerfully expressed his gratitude, \u201cThank you very much, Zhao\u00a0gongzi.\u201dNever before having seen his father\u2019s meek side, He Yun Sheng blew up in fury and cried out, \u201cWhat are you giving thanks for, haven\u2019t you seen how he played you?\u201d\u201cYun Sheng?\u201d He Sui just had just noticed He Yan and He Yun Sheng. He asked, \u201cYan Yan, how did you guys get here?\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s this fellow?\u201d asked Zhao\u00a0gongzi.\u201cHe is this son of this dog, Yun Sheng.\u201d He Sui apologetically smiled.\u201cOh\u2014 ,\u201d Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u00a0replied, \u201cYour son seems to have quite the uncooperative attitude towards me.\u201d\u201cFor that kind of matter? This kid is not sensible.\u201d He Sui knuckled He Yun Sheng\u2019s head. \u201cHurry and say sorry to Zhao\u00a0gongzi.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014 \u201d He Yun Sheng snapped. This Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u00a0was clearly humiliating He Sui, but He Sui, as a man of lower class played along. But why? In any case, as low as He Sui\u2019s skill could be, he was still an official, not the Zhao household\u2019s servant, so why should he be humiliated this way?He Yun Sheng held his head high, refusing to lower it.Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u00a0glanced at him, and an interesting idea seemed to come to him. \u201cHow about this, I was going to let your dad go against me in another match, but now I have an idea. You and me can have a match. This young master will bestow you a silver coin.\u201d He held out his hand, and a servant handed over a silver coin.\u201cOut of the question!\u201d He Sui, alarmed, instantly replied, and immediately bent down: \u201cYun Sheng has never touched a horse, I can still practice with the gentleman.\u201dAlthough He Sui normally favored He Yan, it didn\u2019t that mean he didn\u2019t love his son. This Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u00a0wasn\u2019t a good person. Despite this rich family\u2019s son\u2019s humiliating acts, He Sui\u00a0had already been well-experienced in them, and didn\u2019t care about this.At He Yun Sheng\u2019s age, he should be trained at an academy. As for He Yan, He Sui had to save up a dowry for her. If she wanted to marry into a rich family, she had to bring along money. But he didn\u2019t have any other means besides offering his strength, so he could only flatter these young masters and make them happy, thus earning silver.Unexpectedly, today his pitiful appearance in a difficult situation had been seen by his son and daughter. He Sui\u2019s heart felt shame and sorrow.Yun Sheng truly had a youthful valor, and couldn\u2019t accept these humiliations, but he didn\u2019t know of Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u2019s dangerous character. If he seriously intended to race horses with Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u00a0today, it would be a wonder if he had half his life left afterwards. One had to understand, this horse was one that was just brought today, and it hadn\u2019t even been trained once, let alone race this horse, simply riding it was far from easy.He couldn\u2019t let an accident happen to his son.\u201cI\u2019ll practice with you.\u201d He Sui placidly said with a smile.\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be okay.\u201d Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u00a0shook his head. \u201cI want him.\u201dHe Sui\u2019s smile froze.During this deadlock, suddenly someone spoke up. A sharp and clear sound broke the silence.\u201cHow about I race with you for one round?\u201dEveryone turned their heads to look, that person who was silent before had suddenly spoken. The young woman\u2019s presence was noticed only then. She was wearing a light short-sleeved jacket with lotus embroidery. There was a gown inside, and a scarlet skirt. Her face, elegant and supple, was covered with a white veil, only showing a pair of graceful, moon-shaped eyes.\u201cAnd who are you?\u201d asked Zhao\u00a0gongzi.\u201cI,\u201d the young woman slightly nodded her head, \u201cam only one who has been trained in horsemanship.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although the girl\u2019s face was concealed behind a veil, from her pair of exposed eyes, he could faintly guess her appearance to be above average. Besides, when she reached her hand out with a stern look, her voice had sounded very clear, much like a delicate beauty. And when a delicate beauty put forward her request, he naturally did not have the heart to refuse.\u201cThe girl doesn\u2019t know that this horse is fierce. If you are hurt because of this, I will be very upset,\u201d he also reminded with good intentions, conscious of his own gracefulness.But as soon as he finished speaking, he heard the girl chuckle and, in a flourish, the peony flowers on the girl\u2019s vermilion dress dazzled his eyes, conjuring a fragrant breeze. Looking up again, He Yan was seated upright atop the horse\u2019s back, clutching the reins in her hand.He Sui had originally pulled the horse towards them, but he didn\u2019t expect He Yan to suddenly turn over and mount on the horse. As soon as his hand loosened, the rope fell, frightening the horse. He let out a long hiss and lurched up in place.\u201cYan Yan\u2014\u201d He Sui exclaimed, also startling He Yun Sheng.He Yan was in no hurry. She simply tossed the reins aside and hastily grasped the mane on the horse\u2019s neck. She held it firmly and tightly, intent on keeping the horse upright and stable. She then bent forward and pressed her lips close to the horse\u2019s ear, purring a series of strange noises.Strangely, the horse stopped struggling, and its front hooves retracted to its original place, gradually calming down.The crowd was astonished.\u201cYan Yan, come down quickly,\u201d He Sui\u2019s heart finally fell to the ground, and he eagerly extended his hand towards He Yan, \u201cDon\u2019t fall.\u201dHe Yun Sheng finally came back to his senses. The boy bit his lips, his face turning white as his voice trembled, \u201cYou\u2026 come down quickly! Do you want to die? Do you?!\u201d\u201cHahahaha,\u201d the dazed master Zhao burst out laughing. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect the girl to be an expert. In that case,\u201d he also turned over and hopped on the horse, \u201cHow about a match, little girl? \u201cHe had proposed very elegantly.He Yan smiled, \u201cThe gentleman should be careful. I did say I was trained.\u201d After which, she stretched out her hand, slapped the horse\u2019s buttocks, and had the horse gallop away with a cloud of dust!\u201cDon\u2019t you use a whip?\u201d Mr. Zhao murmured, then flourished his whip, \u201cGo!\u201dThe two horses trailed out smoke on the track, leaving behind a crowd of stunned onlookers.He Sui slowly turned his head and shot He Yun Sheng an inquisitive look. He Yun Sheng hastened to explain, \u201cDon\u2019t ask me. I don\u2019t even know when she had learned to ride a horse!\u201dHe Sui thought he was imagining things.He knew his daughter best. She was proficient in the four arts: music, chess, calligraphy, and painting, and was also eager in dressing herself up. But when it came to riding horses and playing swords, let alone being skilled, the mere mention of them provoked her disgust. He Yan was fond of those elegant childe brothers who immersed themselves in tea, poetry, and flowers beneath the moonlight. She shied away from these coarse things for fear of ruining her delicate skin.But she turned over and mounted the horse so skillfully, as though she had done it thousands of times, and even more aptly than her father. Moreover, that fierce horse was as obedient as a kitten under her hand even without the aid of a whip. How did she do it?He Sui gazed at the figure on the runway.The blazing steed that He Sui couldn\u2019t tame dashed as swiftly as the wind underneath He Yan, and her posture was somewhat graceful due to the inconvenience brought by her long skirt. She tugged the skirt away, revealing her conspicuous trousers, which should have appeared vulgar, but instead gave off an indescribably downbeat impression.Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u00a0couldn\u2019t catch up with her.Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u00a0was annoyed.He had come to the military grounds to make a name for himself, not to lose face. He Sui had flattered and amused him just now, but what was wrong with this girl? He couldn\u2019t lose to a woman, even more so that she was riding a fierce and untamed horse. Was he going to become a laughing stock?Absolutely impossible!Suddenly, Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u2018s heart grew even more competitive, and the horse he was riding bore the brunt. The horse endured the pain, rushed forward, and was about to surpass He Yan.Yes, that was it. Looking at He Yan\u2019s figure getting closer and closer, Mr. Zhao couldn\u2019t help but be proud. He had learned to ride at the age of seven, and after all these years, how could he be no match for a woman?His horse finally overtook He Yan\u2019s.Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u00a0laughed out loud, \u201cGirl, you\u2019ve got to work harder!\u201d\u201cThe gentleman is so talented,\u201d He Yan exclaimed with faint surprise, \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been overtaken.\u201dAs she spoke, she stroked the iron-headed rod swaying around her waist. Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u2018s horse was in front of her, while her horse fell behind. The distance between them was so near that one end of the iron-headed stick stabbed the other horse\u2019s rear end.No one noticed these slight irregularities, except for the horse underneath Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u2018s body.The horse was alarmed and suddenly stumbled, catching Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u00a0off guard. Next moment, his horse disobeyed his command and darted forward, leaving Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u00a0at a loss for words. He tightened the reins, but it was utterly useless.\u201cStop, stop!\u201d He screamed, overwhelmed by force as his body slammed onto the horse\u2019s back.Behind him came a woman\u2019s eager voice, \u201cMaster Zhao? Master Zhao? Are you alright?\u201d\u201cSave. Help me!\u201d Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u00a0was so frightened that his voice had transformed into a cry, \u201cTell it to stop!\u201dIn the distance, He Yun Sheng frowned, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Why did I seem to hear Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u00a0shouting for help?\u201dHe Sui was appalled, but he had noticed that at the end of the track, the two horses were running back to them. Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u2018s horse was ahead, but his whip was missing from his hand, and he was tearfully clinging onto the reins. Behind him, He Yan called on anxiously, but was as steady as Mount Tai on horseback.\u201cZhao\u00a0gongzi\u2018s horse seems to be frightened.\u201d He Sui quickly went to the stable to lead the horse, \u201cI\u2019ll help!\u201d\u201cYoung master, young master,\u201d the boy\u2019s face was blue, \u201cYou mustn\u2019t lose the reins.\u201dZhao\u00a0gongzi\u00a0was mournfully wailing on horseback. He Yan freed her hand and pressed it against her ear. It was too noisy.Such an arrogant boy, if she didn\u2019t scare him to death today, she would not be called He Yan. At that time, there were no lack of recruits in the army who had thought they were superior and gifted, but in the end, reality beat them into submission. In this world, after all, there were plenty of talented people, so it was better to keep a low profile.After enjoying enough, she spotted He Sui leading the horse from a distance, so He Yan once again patted her horse\u2019s buttocks. The horse stopped. She heroically flew off the horse and crossed the iron-headed stick horizontally against Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u2018s horse\u2019s neck. This sudden action obstructed the horse, causing him to behave erratically. He Yan snatched the reins and uttered, \u201cWhew\u2014\u201dThe horse quieted down.Wind unfurled the white veil, and, for a very brief moment, exposed the girl\u2019s face. After a glance, her face was once again covered with white cloth.\u201cAll right,\u201d she spoke towards the man hugging the horse and weeping, \u201cYou can come down now, Zhao\u00a0gongzi.\u201d\u201cWoo\u2014 woo\u2014\u201dZhao\u00a0gongzi\u00a0wept.\u2014\u2014- Extra Topic \u2014\u2014\u2013Yan Yan: [covering her face] Uncle will officially appear in the next chapter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he dismounted, his legs trembled, and he almost fell over.The manservant went over and lent a hand to support him, and said, \u201cGongzi, gongzi, are you okay?\u201dZhao\u00a0gongzi\u00a0kicked him, \u201cDo I look okay to you?\u201d\u201cJust now, really scared me to death.\u201d He Yan expressed, \u201cIt was all my fault. If I didn\u2019t insist on racing with the gentleman, he wouldn\u2019t have been terrified.\u201dHer heart was full of regret, and she sincerely apologized, \u201cPlease don\u2019t take offense,\u00a0gongzi.\u201dTake offense? Why would he take offense? Across him was the person who saved his life, why would he be offended? Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u00a0willed a smile, but in the end there was still a breath left unsaid in his heart. He glared at the horse, whose head was still lowered, looked at the grass, then shifted to the cause of disaster, the horse saddle, and was unable to restrain his anger. He waved his hand, \u201cThis ungrateful, backstabbing, bastard almost hurt this young master. Throw him out! I\u2019ll have him turned to horse jerky!\u201dHe Yun Sheng furrowed his brow, and He Yan\u2019s smiling expression turned even colder.A horse was like a high-ranking military officer. Not only was it a method of transport, it was also a comrade-in-arms to share life and death with. Horses couldn\u2019t speak, but they would carry a soldier charging into battle. They couldn\u2019t express their thoughts, but they would whinny to mourn over their owner\u2019s death, so much so that they would go on a hunger strike. They treasured their owner as much as their owner cherished them.The wealthy and pampered gentleman hadn\u2019t yet gotten a taste of the cruelties of the battleground, so it was impossible for him to understand the intimate bond between a man and a warhorse. Even before one\u2019s birth, they were already conformed to the social hierarchy segregating nobility from common people. An animal, he would never consider hesitating over. Once it was killed, then it was killed; there was no point in troubling oneself over trifles.\u201c\u2026. This is a fine horse.\u201d The one who spoke up was He Sui, and he soothingly pleaded, \u201cGongzi, please think this over.\u201d\u201cThis is my horse.\u201d Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u00a0didn\u2019t know who to direct his temper at, and He Sui had just interjected like that. Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u00a0coldly laughed, \u201cAnything wrong with doing what I want to do?\u201d He drew a dagger from his waist, which glittered like frost, and declared, \u201cI\u2019ll not only kill it, but I\u2019ll kill it right here!\u201dThe dagger\u2019s handle was inlaid with a ruby the size of a dove egg. The scabbard was forged with gold, appearing incomparably gorgeous, yet the knife\u2019s edge was directly facing the currently grazing warhorse. The horse, utterly unaware of his owner\u2019s heart overflowing with killing intent, leisurely shook his tail.Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u2019s eyes glistened with murderous desire, as though cooking up a good method. Since this horse startled him and let him lose face, he could just slaughter it on the spot. Firstly, it would be a way for him to release his anger. Secondly, he would appear brave and his lost honor would be restored.He bellowed at the manservant, \u201cCapture him!\u201dHe Yan\u2019s palm twitched and unconsciously carressed the iron-headed rod by her waist.She couldn\u2019t\u2026 she couldn\u2019t watch this horse die because of her. But even if she took action, she didn\u2019t have a proper excuse.The horse was pinned by some manservants. The head manservant turned around and yelled out, \u201cGongzi,\u00a0gongzi, we\u2019ve pinned him! Please take action now,\u00a0gongzi!\u201dZhao\u00a0gongzi, with a dagger in hand, strode over. Facing the horse\u2019s neck, the coldness of the dagger gleamed as he was about to swing\u2014\u201cThump\u2014\u201dA sharp and clear noise, similar to metal clashing against gold, resounded as something dropped to the ground. He Yan stealthily retracted her extended hand but saw that the dagger Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u00a0was holding had already fallen. Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u00a0was clutching his wrist, crying out, \u2018Aiyo, aiyo.\u2019\u201cWho? Who was it?\u201d He called out as he shifted about in pain, while not forgetting to insult, \u201cWho fucking messed with me?\u201d\u201cIt was me.\u201dSomeone\u2019s voice floated from behind.This voice\u2026 He Yan\u2019s head slightly moved, and she turned around to look over. But when she looked behind her, she didn\u2019t expect two more people to arrive, also riding on horseback. The young man on the left wore a licorice-root yellow robe with a rounded neckline, and the color looked sharp worn by him. With rosy lips and pure white teeth, a light smile, and pupils that glistened like crystals, rarely could one witness a person with such a boyish and naive air about him. He was a spirited playboy-type son of a wealthy family.But the young man on the right\u2026 He Yan\u2019s eyes lit up.It became spring. Colors blossoming, ice and snow melting\u2014there was an entire city of spring colors.The young man dressed in yellow clothing was actually very handsome, and his eyebrows even more so. His face was as beautiful as jade, and his eyes sparkled like stars. His eyes were gently shaped, though slightly raised at the corners, and were akin to limpid autumn water. His presence made others\u2019 hearts skip a beat, as his gaze was ice-cold.Despite his youthful disposition, he wore a crown, his fine hair gracefully falling straight down. He wore a colorful suit, his lapels adorned with a rosefinch delicately stitched with golden thread. His presence imposed an air of grandeur. He wore olive boots, a sterling sword by his waist. His white horse donned on a golden saddle, carrying with it an aura of elegance. At the moment, the fingers on his right hand were toying with a dark perfume satchel, its contents producing a clinking sound.What a charming and elegant Wu Ling noble son!1He Yan\u2019s heart was pounding with admiration, but she suddenly felt uneasy. At lightning speed, before she could even lower her head, the white cloth slightly swayed and covered her eyes, blocking her vision.Only while listening to that Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u2018s dreadful flattery did she remember: \u201cTurns out it\u2019s Chief Commander Xiao2\u2026 excuse me.\u201dWithin He Yan\u2019s thoughts suddenly surfaced another spring day like this that happened many years ago, on a peaceful day when birds were chirping and dancing, and the willow tree was swaying in the Autumn courtyard. She had raised her head, confused, and spotted a handsome young man wearing a white embroidered jacket at the Poplar Swings Garden, his expression filled with annoyance, but his valiant bearing unrestrained.On a lazy spring day, with a light breeze in the air, he stood out like a person from a painting, and all the colors of spring could not match up to him.Xiao Jue, Xiao Huai Jin3\u2014her previous life\u2019s antagonist, her classmate, and the outstanding famous general, General Feng Yun4.1\u00a0\u4e94\u9675\u8d35\u516c\u5b50 (W\u01d4 L\u00edng gu\u00ec g\u014dngz\u01d0)\uff1aWu Ling isn\u2019t a title or anything. It literally refers to the tomb of five Han kings in Chang\u2019an. But in this context, it\u2019s used as a metaphor for the rich or children from noble families that have produced a lot of officials for several generations. He Yan describing him as such is like emphasizing just how exceptionally rich and noble this person is.2\u00a0\u8096\u90fd\u7763 (Xi\u00e0o d\u016b d\u016b): lit. commander-in-chief Xiao. But we\u2019ll be using Chief Commander Xiao instead as it sounds less awkward. It\u2019s just another one of his titles\u20263\u00a0\u8096\u73cf (Xi\u00e0o Ju\u00e9) is his given name, while \u8096\u6000\u747e (Xi\u00e0o Hu\u00e1i J\u01d0n) is his\u00a0courtesy name. The courtesy name would replace a man\u2019s given name as he entered adulthood.\u00a0It could be given either by the parents or by a private teacher on the first day of school. Women might adopt a\u00a0zi\u00a0in place of their given name upon marriage.\u00a0One also may adopt a self-chosen courtesy name.4\u00a0\u5c01\u4e91\u5c06\u519b (F\u0113ng Y\u00fan ji\u0101ngj\u016bn): General Feng Yun is a title bestowed to him by the emperor after having achieved something meritorious, the same way He Yan (or should we say, He Ru Fei) was bestowed the title \u2018General Fei Hong\u2019.E/N: There seems to be like a billion ways to address Xiao Jue. And so we once again encounter the author\u2019s lengthy and flowery paragraphs describing someone\u2019s unparalleled and jade-like beauty.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She could hear He Yun Sheng gasping and whispering \u2018Chief Commander Xiao!\u2019 beside her.The sight of the hero he had always worshipped prompted He Yun Sheng to make such a yearning exclamation.\u201cChief Commander Xiao, what are you doing in the drill fields?\u201d Zhao\u00a0gongzi, who had acted so high and mighty in front of He Sui and the others, was merely a dog wagging its tail in front of Chief Commander Xiao. Everyone present could not help but shake in alarm.\u201cHow much does this steed cost?\u201d The young man on the horse asked calmly.\u201cAh?\u201d Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u00a0was at a loss for words, but he replied honestly: \u201cThirty taels of silver.\u201dChief Commander Xiao raised his chin and peered at Zhao\u00a0gongzi. The next moment, two pieces of silver ingots flew out of the dark green sachet in his hand and landed on the grass. One of the pieces even bounced off Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u2019s wrist before landing.\u201cI\u2019ll buy your horse,\u201d Chief Commander Xiao said, still indifferent.Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u2018s lips trembled. He could not utter a word.Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u00a0had originally wanted to save his face and reprimand the real culprit, but he could not do so in front of Xiao Huai Jin, the second son of the Xiao family. Since he could not afford to provoke him, Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u00a0swallowed his evil intentions and smiled: \u201cIf you want this horse, I\u2019ll give it to you. You need not pay me.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Xiao Jue countered. \u201cNothing in the world is free.\u201dHe Yan sighed in relief. Xiao Jue and He Yan were both generals. Therefore, they could not bear the sight of such fine steeds being killed in the streets.Fortunately, the horse had escaped this plight due to Xiao Jue\u2019s timely intervention.As He Yan was pondering this, He Yun Sheng stepped forward and looked at Xiao Jue with admiration.He said: \u201cThank you, General Feng Yun, for saving this horse. I sincerely believe that saving lives is worth more than building a pagoda with seven storeys! You are truly amazing!\u201dIf He Yun Sheng was that eager to talk to his hero, the least he could do was to select the right words.His words were embarrassing, yet he didn\u2019t look like he would apologize. He instead looked like he would promise to study hard any time soon. He Yan could swear that Xiao Jue was sneering at Yun Sheng in his heart that moment.Contrary to He Yan\u2019s expectations, Xiao Jue didn\u2019t make any sarcastic remark. Instead, he turned to He Yun Sheng, who was gazing at him with eyes as clear and brilliant as stars. He lightly asked: \u201cDo you like this horse?\u201dHe Yun Sheng took a look at the steed and answered honestly, \u201cI like it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s yours now,\u201d He said.\u201cThank you\u2026 wait!\u201d Needless to say, He Yun Sheng was dumbfounded. He wanted to express his gratitude, but Xiao Jue and the yellow-clad youth beside him had already urged their horses to move forward, obviously not willing to spend any more time there. He chased after them for a while, but returned back, still gazing at their distant backs.He Yan walked up to him, stretched out her hand, and shook it in front of his eyes. \u201cAre you in your right sense now, dear brother?\u201dHe Yun Sheng withdrew his gaze, turned and said, \u201cWhere\u2019s Zhao\u00a0gongzi?\u201d\u201cHe already left,\u201d He Sui rolled his eyes, seemingly not pleased at the way He Yun Sheng had acted. \u201cWhile you were busy worshiping Chief Commander Xiao.\u201dEven though Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u00a0had been reluctant to leave, he didn\u2019t dare find trouble with Xiao Jue. He could only take the silver Xiao Jue had given him, and immediately left the place in a huff.He Yun Sheng walked over to the steed his hero had left him. He gently patted its head as if stroking a possession left by his lover. In a daze, he said: \u201cThis was gifted to me by General Feng Yun.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you build a plaque to commemorate this memory?\u201d He Yan asked, her voice laced with sarcasm.He Yun Sheng glared at her: \u201cWhat do you know? If Chief Commander Xiao hadn\u2019t passed by just now, this horse would have been killed by that thug, Zhao! I can first-hand say that Chief Commander Xiao is a chivalrous man. He would go any lengths to defend justice!\u201d\u201cStop, stop,\u201d He Yan interrupted him, \u201cSpeak about something else, anything other than Chief Commander Xiao\u2019s chivalry!\u201d He Yun Sheng was only a child who was kept in the dark about the dangers of the world. Xiao Huai Jin wasn\u2019t a chivalrous man. He had never been so. That man was ruthless as hell.\u201cYan Yan, why did you come wearing a veil?\u201d He Sui, who had not said anything till this point, finally found a chance to speak. \u201cAnd when did you learn to ride a horse? Dad was really scared to death just now. You can\u2019t be so reckless in the future, okay? If something happens to you, what would I tell your mother in heaven? \u201cHe Sui\u2019s attitude towards both of his children was clearly biased.\u201cThis is a new trend in the capital. Lately, going out with a veil seems to be the fashion trend. It seems mysterious and beautiful.\u2019\u2019 He Yan spouted nonsense with a serious face, \u201cFather, don\u2019t you think this looks good on me?\u201dHe Sui exclaimed: \u201cGood! It looks great! \u201cHe Yun Sheng rolled his eyes. He Yan had come up with such a clumsy excuse and He Sui actually believed it.He Sui trusted He Yan\u2019s words because he knew nothing about the taste of girls. What he did know was that He Yan always liked to dress up and follow the latest fashion trends. Not to mention, He Sui would never suspect that his arrogant and weak daughter actually went to a gambling house to compete with rough people.\u201cAs for horse-riding, I learned it from my friends. Although I only know a few tricks, I\u2019ll make sure to practice till I attain perfection,\u201d He Yan murmured vaguely.*On the other side, Xiao Jue and the young man in yellow robes were riding their horses outside the academy yard near the drill fields.\u201cThat was an interesting experience.\u201d The youth in yellow said with a smile, \u201cUncle, did you see the girl secretly tampering the horse? That guy called Zhao fell into a trap so easily. Man, that was truly a sight to behold!\u201dXiao Jue listened with an indifferent look on his face.They were just passing by when this scene had unfolded. The woman mounted on the horse was astonishingly agile. He firmly believed that the man surnamed Zhao could not escape easily by killing the horse even if he hadn\u2019t said anything about it. He was sure that the woman would have made a move first as her hands had almost reached the iron-headed stick on her waist before he intervened.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity she kept her head down; I couldn\u2019t see her face properly.\u201d The young man in yellow said while stroking his chin, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go back now and inquire about her details, maybe we can see what she looks like?\u201d\u201cGo by yourself.\u201d Xiao Jue remained unmoved.\u201cThat won\u2019t do, she only lowered her head after taking a look at you. She must have been shy because she was shocked to see Uncle\u2019s terrific appearance. I think there are a lot of interesting girls in the capital these days. Previously, we had seen a girl take down a bunch of thugs by herself near Zui Yu Restaurant, and today\u2026 a girl riding a horse efficiently at the drill fields near the academy. Of all the good girls in the world, why isn\u2019t there one for me?\u201d The young man in yellow pounded his chest and heaved a long sigh.Xiao Jue looked at him calmly. \u201cCheng Li Shu, if you don\u2019t shut up, I\u2019ll send you back to the Cheng household.\u201dAs the two men were chatting, they suddenly came across several people standing near the weapons rack, led by a young man in blue. This guy was thin and his appearance would remind one of a banished immortal. He stood there in front of his aides, with a charming smile on his face. They didn\u2019t know how long he had been standing there, but from the looks of it, he had witnessed the whole situation.\u201cIsn\u2019t he the fourth son of the Shi Jin Count Manor?\u201d Cheng Li Shu whispered, \u201cWhy is he here?\u201dXiao Jue did not answer but instead stopped his horse.Cheng Li Shu greeted with a warm smile: \u201cIsn\u2019t this Brother Zilan1? Why did Brother Zilan come to the academy?\u201dHe was the fourth son of the current Count Shi Jin, Chu Zhao.\u201cI was just taking a stroll. I happened to come here and did not expect to meet Chief Commander Xiao and Gentleman Cheng here.\u201d Chu Zhao smiled slightly, \u201cAre you also out on a stroll?\u201d\u201cNaturally. It\u2019s spring time, it wouldn\u2019t do us good if we don\u2019t come out to play.\u201d Cheng Li Shu laughed and muttered, \u201cAlthough I think it would be more pleasant to go out with a beautiful girl.\u201dChu Zhao acted like he didn\u2019t hear it, but his smile remained unchanged.From the beginning to the end, Xiao Jue hadn\u2019t said a single word to Chu Zhao. He gave him a slight nod and resumed his horse-ride, as though he had only met a stranger.Once they were out of earshot, a servant grumbled:\u201cThis General Feng Yun is really rude!\u201dChu Zhao wasn\u2019t bothered by that in the least. He just shook his head with a smile: \u201cIsn\u2019t this why he is known as Xiao Huai Jin2?\u201d Saying that, he took another look at the empty track. He chuckled lightly, as if he had thought of something interesting.1\u00a0A pet name used for addressing people affectionately.2\u00a0\u6000\u747e\u63e1\u745c (hu\u00e1i j\u01d0n w\u00f2 y\u00fa): Xiao Jue\u2019s courtesy name (Huai Jin) comes from the ninth chapter of \u2018The Book of Songs,\u2019 an idiom meaning \u2018full of fine qualities.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But, for some unknown reason, he felt rather empty at heart, as if he had tied a white wolf with his bare hands.1\u00a0As soon as he realized this, he reprimanded himself. How dare he think that! This was a gift from his most adored hero!But\u2026 it was just that General Feng Yun\u2019s appearance was even more striking and sophisticated than it was rumoured to be. Could he grow up to become such a man even in a thousand years?He Sui cast a sidelong glance at He Yun Sheng. His son had a dazed look on his face. He didn\u2019t know where his mind was flying off to yet it was rare to see him in such high spirits. He Sui turned his attention to He Yan again. Although her face was covered with a veil, He Sui could tell that she was lost in thought.What in the world was wrong with his children?! He Yun Sheng hadn\u2019t uttered a word throughout their walk back home. The reason was obvious\u2014He Yun Sheng was not able to keep his mind off the horse and the person who gifted it to him. But why was He Yan silent? Of course, that young man, Xiao Huai Jin, was young and promising and his daughter was one of the most captivating women in the entire kingdom. Wait\u2026 Did his daughter happen to have taken a liking to him? He Sui sincerely prayed that wasn\u2019t the case. He was already in trouble with a certain Fan\u00a0gongzi\u00a0but now a young commander has made his appearance! There were countless Young Masters of noble families but there was only one Xiao Huai Jin in the entire dynasty!He Sui had a headache thinking about this.The three of them seemed to be lost in their own worlds. The person who sold tofu next door, Aunt Li, was rather curious about what had caused the entire family to behave so peculiarly. She pulled He Sui aside and asked with a voice filled with concern: \u201cBrother He, has something happened at home? Yan Yan and Yun Sheng seem to be very distracted.\u201dHe Sui was at a loss for words.Qing Mei had already prepared dinner by the time the three of them arrived. As everyone was drinking their own portion of porridge, He Sui suddenly raised a question: \u201cYan Yan, why did you come to the drill fields today?\u201dIt was understandable in He Yun Sheng\u2019s case but He Yan had never visited the drill fields in her life.He Yan\u2019s thoughts were interrupted because of the question. She turned to look at He Sui and spoke: \u201cWell, I only wanted to tell father that it was high time Yun Sheng entered the academy. You know very well, simply learning some fist moves and footwork won\u2019t help Yun Sheng\u2019s future. He needs to be trained by an experienced tutor. It\u2019s not too late as spring is the right time to be admitted into the academy. What is father\u2019s opinion on this matter?\u201dHe Sui opened his mouth to answer but had a moment\u2019s hesitation. The truth was, he didn\u2019t know if he was supposed to be glad because his daughter had finally started caring for her brother, or worried, because He Yan\u2019s innocent question had actually rendered him speechless.\u201cYan Yan, I have thought about this before\u2026 but right now, we are in short of silver,\u201d he said, scratching the back of his head in embarrassment. \u201cHang in there. Daddy will get a little more silver with this month\u2019s salary.\u201dOtherwise, he would never have tolerated Zhao\u00a0gongzi\u2019s\u00a0insults.He Yun Sheng had supper with his head lowered but his ears were sharp enough. He was aware that his father suffered a lot to feed the family. He had felt that it would be unfilial of him to put forward such a request. But the words he could not say were finally spoken by He Yan, making He Yun Sheng sigh in relief.\u201cDaddy need not worry about the silver.\u201d Saying this, He Yan got up from her seat and went to her room. A moment later, she came back with a chest. She opened it, its sparkling contents almost blinded He Sui\u2019s and Qing Mei\u2019s eyes.The chopsticks in He Sui\u2019s hand fell down with a clatter. Yet, he regained his composure while asking: \u201cYan Yan. Where did you get this silver? \u201d\u201cYun Sheng won it when he went to Le Tong Gambling House.\u201d He Yan answered fluently.He Yun Sheng spurted out a mouthful of porridge.\u201cHe Yan\u2026\u201dHe Yan winked at him and her expression didn\u2019t change at all while lying: \u201cYun Sheng got really lucky. He won a lot of money with his first visit to Le Tong. I have counted them, and the money will be enough for us to last for several years, besides being used for repairs.\u201dHe Yun Shung moved his lips but in the end, was unable to speak up.What could he say? Could he say that He Yan, a girl, went to gamble? Let alone He Sui, even if he couldn\u2019t comprehend it all. Moreover, He Yan was wearing his clothes that day, and others would only remember her as a teenage boy and not a girl. Besides, whenever he thought of the scene when He Yan stood up for him and raced with Zhao\u00a0gongzi, he couldn\u2019t help but feel a sense of pride and heroism.He was ready to take the blame in return for her favour!He Yun Sheng chimed in: \u201cYes, I won this money by gambling. Father, let\u2019s take this silver to the academy! \u201dHe Sui looked at him with his eyebrows raised: \u201cYou won this in the gambling house? Good.You got such a big win with your first visit? Indeed.\u201d\u201cIndeed! Indeed!\u201d He Sui flew into a rage and slammed his fist on the table. He picked up a plank lying nearby and started spanking He Yun Sheng, \u201cYou unfilial son! You actually dared to go to Le Tong Gambling House! As your father, I worked so hard to feed and clothe you, but how dare you give me Le Tong shit?! Do you want us to lose our face? Don\u2019t you have any respect for your dead mother?\u201dHe Yun Sheng tried to save himself: \u00a0\u201cDad, It\u2019s only because our family is too poor! My dead mother won\u2019t come to know if you don\u2019t tell her!\u201d\u201cHow dare you quibble?! Where did you learn this habit? Going to the gambling house! He Yun Sheng, today I will make you turn over a new leaf!\u201dHe Yan quietly shrank to a corner of the room. She would have been in danger if not for He Yun Sheng taking the blame. What if He Sui came to know that she did it and started spanking her too? What if she accidentally retaliated and injured He Sui? She really would be branded as an \u2018unfilial daughter\u2019 then.After a while, the \u2018teaching a lesson\u2019 process came to an end.He Yun Sheng was punished in the end and the matter was put off. The next step was to decide which academy was suitable for He Yun Sheng. The best choice was to take into account the martial arts training in each academy. Second, the school should neither be a highly reputed one nor one with low standards. The problem with selecting the good schools was that it was mostly attended by sons of rich, noble families. Hence, it would be inevitable that for Yun Sheng to pick up some bad habits there.*While in He Yan\u2019s room, He Yun Sheng fiddled with lampstand and a small comb on the table: \u201cReally, choosing the right school is such a painful task.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not something that can be decided overnight.\u201d He Yan glanced at him and said, \u201cWe have plenty of time.\u201dHe Yun Sheng\u2019s lips curled: \u201cAren\u2019t you well-informed? Don\u2019t you know which academy is the best in the capital?\u201d\u201cI have never visited a library. What could I possibly know?\u201d He Yan said, \u201cBut I do know the gambling house.\u201dHe Yun Sheng said, \u201cYou are belittling yourself!\u201dHe Yan smiled at him and said, \u201cThank you.\u201dThinking of the beating he had received in vain tonight, He Yun Sheng was frustrated again. \u201cI\u2019ll feed the horse.\u201d Saying this, he immediately left He Yan\u2019s room.Once He Yun Sheng took his leave, Qing Mei left with the washing basin and He Yan blew out the candle, took off her shoes, and went to bed.The window was open, but she didn\u2019t feel cold on a spring night like this. Moonlight poured in through the window, brightening her room. Gazing at the silver moonlight, she was immersed in her thoughts about Xiao Jue, who she had met in the daytime.She was flustered at that time. She was afraid that Xiao Jue would recognize herself, so she lowered her head in a panic. But later she came back to her senses. She was no longer that \u2018He Yan\u2019. Xiao Jue would never recognize her even if he had seen her face. Besides she had always adorned a mask, back then.The last time she saw Xiao Jue, seemed to be a long time ago. At that time, he was not as cold and indifferent as the current Xiao Jue. He was a proud and green young man2\u00a0who always seemed to be thousands of miles away.The best academy in the capital was called Xian Chang Hall. The two most renowned generals of the Great Wei Dynasty, General Feng Yun and General Fei Hong, both graduated from here.To sum up, He Yan and Xiao Jue had been classmates for one year.1\u00a0\u7a7a\u624b\u5957\u767d\u72fc: idiom, \u2018to tie a wolf with bare hands\u2019; meaning \u2018to gain valuable things in exchange for worthless things or even nothing.\u20192\u00a0\u7eff\u5c11\u5e74 (l\u01dc sh\u00e0o ni\u00e1n): green young man, meaning a young man who is untested in the ways of war, politics, and ruling\u2026 It\u2019s a metaphor for a young man or teenager whose youth means that they are inexperienced and unready for the realities of war, like an unripe fruit or a newly sprouted plantPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, He Yan always felt it was dramatizing.They were both young men that joined the army with exceptional military achievements, so they were often pitted against each other. The various rumors that circulated around were just exaggerations to add spice to the story. So the rumors spread until it all became a rather strange tale to tell.Little He Yan being only fourteen years old, was exceptionally kindhearted and bore no hostility towards Young Master Xiao.As time passed, she got used to being disguised as a man, so being He Ru Fei was pretty easy. There was only one difficulty, that was, once the young boys reached a certain age, they were to be sent to an academy to learn.Back then, the lives of men and women were contrasting. Young girls could invite teachers to their homes, whereas boys could not. The He family summoned a teacher to teach their young boy, but as he grew older, they realized that they would be laughed at if anyone else came to know.Knowing this, they stopped summoning the teacher and sent He Yan to the Xiang Chang Institute to learn when he turned fourteen.The Xiang Chang Institute was the most prestigious academy in all of the capital city. The founder of the academy was the former crown prince. Students learned the six arts, from teachers who were the leaders of the Imperial Court.Although the He family had a title of nobility, they were still inferior to the other families in the institute.Who would have thought He Yuan Liang would have such good luck? One day, when he was at a restaurant, he encountered a dispute and intervened in it, speaking out for one side. Surprisingly, he had helped a teacher who worked at Xiang Chang Institute who had just selected new students. He had even remembered that the He family had an illegitimate son. So to return the favor, he asked him to enroll in the institute.He Yuan Liang had hesitated a long time concerning this matter. He even discussed it with He Yuan Sheng.He Yuan Sheng was the type of person who set his heart on pursuing wealth and fame, so he thought the idea was feasible. If He Yan got enrolled in the Xiang Chang Institute, he would be in the company of children who came from reputed noble families. That would give him an edge, and the title alone \u2018Xiang Chang Institute\u2019s Student\u2019 would be of great help for his future.When He Yan heard about this, she was ecstatic.Even though she cross-dressed, she still followed all the rules women had to. Well, one thing she understood was never to kick a man\u2019s private parts. Well, if you did, better be prepared with your shoes to run. Second was to never appear in public and to practice martial arts hidden from society as it was a patriarchal society. However, she would be deemed an incompetent woman. The daughters of the other noble families learned the piano, chess, calligraphy and painting. It was difficult for He Yan, as she was disguised as He Ru Fei.Earlier, it seemed like it was impractical, but going to Xiang Chang Institute was different. There were myriad talents there, all of them being the same age as her. If she attended the institute, she could learn from the best while making friends and gaining experience. That was something other women could never be able to do, and she suddenly felt lucky for being able to accept He Ru Fei\u2019s identity.He Yuan Sheng\u2019s wife, her nominal mother and her great aunt were present when she got the finely crafted mask. They were apprehensive and told her, \u201cYou must be careful and never let anybody find out your true identity\u201d.He Yan nodded.She did not want to wear the mask. Although being light, it was uncomfortable and stuffy, only revealing her eyes and chin. She had worn this mask for many years; never taking it off, even while sleeping.The craftsman was very capable. One side of the mask was tucked into the hair and the other was equipped with a mechanism only she could open. If she was sure of one thing, it was that the mask would never fall off even when she was fighting. That showed his mastery.He\u00a0furen\u00a0solemnly warned: \u201cIf you let others know, our entire family will be doomed. You must remember this!\u201dHe Yan thought: I knew this already. I had been told this a thousand times. The crime of deceiving the Emperor will result in an unimaginable punishment, implicating nine generations of a family.\u201cI remember.\u201d He Yan replied respectfully but in a somber voice.He\u00a0furen\u00a0had an uneasy expression on her face as she followed He Yan to the carriage. She was reluctant to let her go.In the eyes of outsiders, it was a display of affection and love between a mother and son. He Yan was relieved and filled with joy at the thought of being free. She was finally free from the days where her every move was controlled and watched by others. Her freedom was just around the corner.The carriage stopped at the gate of Xiang Chang institute. Her servant escorted her off\u00a0 the carriage and waited by the entrance.She had reached too early; her teacher had not arrived yet. She could hear the faint voices of students reading, laughing and talking amongst each other. He Yan stepped through the door, full of longing.The blissful spring sun had come out early. There was a large courtyard and a garden before the entrance to the main hall. Inside the courtyard, there were stables; inside the garden, there were ponds and willow trees.There was also a swing.The swing swayed ever so slightly, the wind blowing around it. He Yan reached out at it wanting to sit on it but she didn\u2019t dare. If she sat on it, she was sure to be laughed at. He Yan had to move on.The willow trees were lush and emerald green colors seemed to be pouring into the pond. The mountains and waters shone and the sun cast a warm glow that made her drowsy. Her vision started to become hazy, so she rubbed her eyes. There was a loquat tree in front of her.The He family wasn\u2019t short of money and was able to afford loquats. He Yan had eaten loquats before but this was the first time He Yan had seen a loquat tree full of ripened fruits. The glistening, golden fruit seemed to be packed with honey and fragrance. It was a very attractive sight underneath the sun.Albeit everything, she was still a fourteen-year-old girl who had a lot of fun. Seeing this scene, she remembered the pictures of the young ladies in the yard who used bamboo poles to beat down plums in the summer. Back then, it would\u2019ve been downgrading if the young master of the He family had to pick fruits personally.\u00a0 However, she wasn\u2019t home. She was at the academy. Surely\u2026 it would be fine if she picked a loquat, right? It shouldn\u2019t be disgraceful for a boy to pick a fruit to begin with.Thinking of this, He Yan rolled up her sleeves and prepared to battle.She was in a hurry but she only had a pen and a few books that were given by her teacher. There were no poles around her and nothing she could stand on. Fortunately, the loquat tree wasn\u2019t that high. If she jumped, she may be able to reach it.He Yan stared at the nearest loquat in front of her. The fruit was hanging on the tip of a branch, golden and dazzling as if trying to tempt her into picking it.She missed.Almost.He Yan was not discouraged, and so she continued.She missed it again..She has always been somebody that didn\u2019t admit defeat, so she tried again.She missed, and missed, and missed. She lost count of the times she was defeated. When He Yan was about to give up due exhaustion, she heard a chuckle from up above her head.He Yan looked up.The loquat tree\u2019s branches were bursting with leaves and fruits. She was so focused on the loquats that she didn\u2019t notice the person sitting on the tree.She didn\u2019t know how long he had been sitting there, watching her. She looked up at him, and the sunlight shone down, basking his face in a golden glow.There was a beautiful young man in a white robe and golden boots. His expression was lazy and his arrogance was evident. His head was propped up by his hands, and his beautiful eyes made her heart pound.He Yan was dumbfounded.She had never seen such a good-looking young man before. It seemed like spring was being reflected onto him. For a while, she felt ashamed. Fortunately, the mask covered her blushing face, but it couldn\u2019t cover the shine in her eyes.After the handsome boy glanced at her as he pulled a fruit down.He suddenly turned over and fell to the ground, his white robe swaying in the wind. She watched as the young man approached her with the fruit, not knowing what to say.Should she say thank you? Or that he looked handsome?She was so nervous, and so she reached out and started playing with her robe.The young man stopped before her and smiled.When he smiled, it seemed like spring had come once again, and the flowers were blooming. He Yan said with excitement, \u201cTh-\u2026\u201dBefore the \u2018Thanks\u2019 was finished, the other party passed by her and walked away.He Yan was dumbstruck.She looked back and saw that the white-robed young man was throwing\u00a0the golden-yellow loquat up and down as he walked forward with a leisurely posture, as if mocking her self-indulgence.He Yan stood there trying to calm her pounding heart, and then proceeded to follow the young man inside the academy.However, as she passed by the entrance, she heard someone with a lively and cheerful voice ask, \u201cI heard that the new young master of the He family came here to study today. Brother Huai Jin, did you see him?\u201dShe took a step forward and heard a lazy voice answer, \u201cI didn\u2019t see the young master of the He family. I only saw somebody who was stupid and short.\u201dSt-stupid and short?He Yan hasn\u2019t been so disappointed in her entire life. Stupid was one thing, but short?How was she short? Her stature was excellent among girls the same age as her!He Yan wanted to see the person that had reached such a conclusion. When she looked up, she saw the young man who was surrounded by a crowd of young people. His eyes were shining as if he hadn\u2019t said anything.It seemed like he knew she was staring at him.Bursts of laughter rang throughout the main hall.The world was full of greenery, beautiful scenery, signs of spring and alluring flowers.This was her first encounter with Xiao Jue.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Spring was nearing its end and summer was approaching. Chances of rain would only increase, and the roof of her room was the only one intact in the He family\u2019s house. Both He Sui\u2019s and He Yun Sheng\u2019s rooms had copper pots strewn all over the floor to catch the dripping water droplets, and upon entering their rooms, it looked rather like they were selling pots.The roof was quickly repaired with solid green tiles. He Yan pondered for a while and changed the quilt and pillows in the house as they had cotton peeking out at some places.He Yun Sheng stepped into the house and beckoned, \u201cHe Yan, come and take a look.\u201dHe Yan was baffled when she saw He Yun Sheng pull out a piece of paper from his bosom and told her, \u201cYesterday, I wrote down all the academies in the capital that are still viable. Would you like to check them out together today?\u201d\u201cNow?\u201d He Yan asked. \u201cAre you asking me to come with you?\u201dHe Yun Sheng\u2019s face flushed a little with annoyance as he turned his back to her, \u201cI just told you.\u201d\u201cOh, well, then how about I accompany you?\u201d He Yan replied.This young man had an awkward temperament, but he was quite cute and relatively harmless. When He Yan walked into the yard, she saw that the horse Xiao Jue had given He Yun Sheng yesterday was standing in the corner, and He Yun Sheng had also built it a simple stable.The family, being poor, was unable to raise horses. Only chickens and ducks had been raised in the yard. At this time, there was a giant animal, which was really strange. The horse was eating grass with its head down, the forge wiped clean and the yard neat and tidy.Seeing He Yan looking at the horse, He Yun Sheng proudly praised, \u201cXiang Xiang1\u00a0is very beautiful.\u201dHe Yan almost doubted that she had heard it wrong, \u201cWhat did you call it?\u201d\u201cXiang Xiang!\u201d He Yun Sheng replied matter-of-factly, not noticing her tone as he continued, \u201cI noticed yesterday that she\u2019s a female horse. Since she\u2019s with me now, I\u2019ve given her another name. Xiang Xiang is a name that girls will definitely like.\u201dHe Yan: \u201c\u2026 as long as you\u2019re happy.\u201dHe Yan had already advised him to study more, but He Yun Sheng refused to listen. If a person as fastidious as Xiao Jue found out that the horse he had casually gifted was given such a name by He Yun Sheng, it would definitely be the ultimate disgrace in his horse-giving career.He Yun Sheng didn\u2019t feel that there was anything wrong with the name. Though he tried hard to hide it, he couldn\u2019t stop being happy; and He Yan was too lazy to be bothered about him.The He family didn\u2019t have any horses before and naturally no horse-carriages, so He Yan and He Yun Sheng both walked on the streets with umbrellas above their heads. He Sui went to the drill fields early in the morning. After He Yan got up in the morning, she saw that the bruises at the corner of her mouth had\u00a0healed up and were barely visible, so she decided to go out without wearing a veil.There were no benefits in going out while wearing a veil. Now that she had a different identity, she could observe the town without worrying. After careful selection, He Yun Sheng noted down the names of a total of four schools on the paper. When He Yan looked at it, she found that those schools gave most priority to martial arts.That was good, too. With his appearance, He Yun Sheng didn\u2019t seem like he intended to take the civil service route\u2014\u2014then again, he really wasn\u2019t made for that kind of job, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have named his horse \u2018Xiang Xiang.\u2019The two shopped and ate to their hearts\u2019 fill, but managed to visit all the schools on the list in a day. After they discussed the schools, they decided to choose the one nearest to their home. This school had more martial arts masters and the homework was also arranged properly. He could also go to the school to practice martial arts after completing his studies. The tuition was not extravagant, just one or two tales of silver a year. The money that He Yan had won, would be enough for him to go to school for several years.Although He Yun Sheng didn\u2019t say it, he was obviously ecstatic. On the way back, he even skipped a little as he walked. When they passed by a tailor shop, He Yan suddenly remembered He Yun Sheng\u2019s coat that she had torn up at Le Tong. After thinking about it, she said, \u201cI had agreed to sew you clothes before. Since we\u2019re already here, doing it today is better than waiting for tomorrow. Let\u2019s check it here.\u201dMost of He Yun Sheng\u2019s clothes were He Sui\u2019s hand-me-downs, which had been stitched and mended repeatedly for at least three years, with very few new clothes. He had never before set foot in a tailor shop, so when he heard her words, he hesitated, \u201cForget it, I can just wear the clothes I have.\u201d\u201cYou will be going to the academy. If you don\u2019t carry yourself well, you will be ridiculed.\u201d Saying this, He Yan dragged him inside the shop. The old tailor smiled kindly, \u201cAre the clothes being made for the young girl or the young boy?\u201d\u201cDo it for him,\u201d He Yan pointed to He Yun Sheng. \u201cClothes for both spring and winter seasons, preferably long-sleeved and long trousers. Better looking and suitable for a young man like him. Don\u2019t use too deep colours but don\u2019t use very light colours either. The pattern can be kept simple.\u201dThe old tailor smiled and answered in affirmative.\u201cWhat about you?\u201d He Yun Sheng was shocked and stood up, \u201cI can\u2019t wear all those. They\u2019re too much.\u201dHe Yan pushed him back onto the chair, \u201cI have a lot of clothes to wear, my wardrobe is already full, how can you compare with me? After all, you look so dashing. It would be such a waste of your handsome face if you don\u2019t dress well.\u201dHe Yun Sheng flushed red. \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about?\u201dWhen the old tailor heard the words, his smile widened, \u201cYoung man, your sister loves you a lot.\u201dLove? He Yun Sheng was a bit dazed. He had never expected to shop with He Yan like this one day, just like other siblings. But\u2026 she did help him a lot. She was reluctant to spend money on making clothes for her herself, but she did so much for him. Everyone knew He Yan was the one who liked to dress the most.He Yan didn\u2019t know He Yun Sheng\u2019s inner thoughts were jumbled up right now. She was just thinking that she couldn\u2019t wear the clothes of the original owner of the body as they were way too charming and was not of He Yan\u2019s taste. Every time she wore those long skirts, she fell down after stepping on the corner of the clothes. Whenever she had to hold the hem of her clothes, her face would be filled with despair.Even when she was living at the Xu family, her clothes were always simple and elegant. Therefore the original owner\u2019s clothes were not suitable for her. Not to mention that she couldn\u2019t even practice martial arts in those clothes. She thought that it would be better if she asked the tailor to make two sets of male clothes, but it should not be in front of He Yun Sheng, otherwise, she would have to spend an infinite amount of time explaining it. She would have to do it when she is alone, secretly.While the tailor was measuring He Yun Sheng, He Yan was walking around looking at the bolts of fabric intending to pick one or two pieces for him. At that moment, someone called her name.\u201cHe Yan?\u201dHe Yan turned around to take a look.After she turned around to look, she saw an extremely handsome and richly-dressed youth, whose appearance was fair, but his eyes had a hint of black and blue underneath them, making him appear sullen. Tailing after him were a few young manservants. Seeing He Yan turn around, his eyes lit up and he suddenly dashed ahead to grab her hands.He Yan swiftly avoided his hands.Seemed like the original owner was quite famous in the town. He Yan was going insane, internally, discovering acquaintances wherever she went, first that Wang Jiu Gui, and now this one.The youth was shocked when He Yan avoided his hand, but then immediately looked crestfallen, holding his chest where his heart was, \u201cYou\u2026 are still mad at me?\u201dWhat did that mean?He Yan was still quite lost, but a young calf-like boy had already rushed out like a whirlwind and blocked He Yan\u2019s way.\u201cFan Cheng you dare to come!\u201d\u2018Fan?\u2019 He Yan came to a sudden conclusion. This person was the legendary \u2018Fan\u00a0gongzi\u2019, the ex-lover of the original He Yan.1\u00a0\u9999 (xi\u0101ng): xiang literally means \u2018fragrant, aromatic, sweet smelling.\u2019 A weird name for a horse lolPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He and He Yan had known each other for a very long time and he had almost never seen an occasion where both of them appeared at the same time. Even if it happened once, at that time, both of them were arguing with each other.But now, when he took a look at both of them, they didn\u2019t seem to be arguing, but rather, He Yun Sheng was protecting He Yan. Did something happen between the two of them that he didn\u2019t know about?He turned his attention to He Yan again, and she also stared at him, her clear eyes were full of frankness, without much affection, and it didn\u2019t look like she had any feelings left for him in her heart.Fan Cheng took another step forward and asked with some concern and anxiety, \u201cI heard that you were seriously ill a few days ago. I wonder if you are feeling okay now\u2026 would you like me to buy you some supplements? What do you like? I think you seem to be thinner, hence I don\u2019t feel at ease.\u201dThis man was quite good-looking, well-dressed, and quite passionate. If the original He Yan was here, then she was afraid that she would have been touched by him.He Yan hadn\u2019t had time to speak yet, when He Yun Sheng forestalled her, afraid that she would be moved by Fan Cheng\u2019s few words and said, \u201cDon\u2019t listen to the nonsense that he is spouting! Don\u2019t forget who caused you to be seriously ill, and the words they said at the door of the Fan family! This man is a liar! A cheat!\u201dHe Yan had heard He Yun Sheng say this before. When the original He Yan learnt that her sweetheart would marry his wife, she went to ask for an explanation from him. As a result, she wasn\u2019t even allowed to enter the household as she was directly swept aside by the Fan family servants in front of the door, not even catching a glimpse of Fan Cheng\u2019s face.Fan Cheng hated He Yan for wanting too many things in his heart, but he didn\u2019t show any of the hatred on his face and continued explaining himself, \u201cIt was my parents\u2019 decision. This matter was set by my parents for me, I have no right to choose. You should know who is in your heart, so why listen to outsiders?\u201d\u201cWho did you call an outsider?!\u201d He Yun Sheng was furious, \u201cI\u2019m her brother! What is your relationship with her? Don\u2019t even think about taking advantage of her!\u201dHe Yan patted He Yun Sheng\u2019s shoulder and motioned him to calm down. She then turned to Fan Cheng and said, \u201cThank you, Fan\u00a0gongzi\u00a0for coming, but I am no longer sick. In the last few days, it was just a matter of a cold.\u201dFan Cheng didn\u2019t expect her to say so and he suddenly was at a loss for words.\u201cWhatever happened in the past has already turned into a cloud of smoke. You have now been married and have your own family. It is really inappropriate for a woman to be so close to a man, and it will upset your wife. In the future, let\u2019s not have anything to do with each other and never meet again.\u201dHe Yan thoughtfully said this, which did not hurt the face of the young man. Looking at He Yun Sheng, he seemed to be satisfied with her remarks.Fan Cheng looked at He Yan carefully.Speaking of which, he and He Yan had met totally by chance.In all fairness, He Yan was pretty but without brains. There were many people of this kind around here. He Yan was only interested in his family background and wanted to live a life of comfort. When the fat meat was delivered directly to his mouth, there was no reason for him to not accept it. Fan Cheng thought that it was good to take her in as his concubine based on her appearance.Who knew that He Yan was so ambitious and arrogant that she was aiming for the position of his main wife?How could he marry the daughter of a drill field officer? He Yan was delusional, but in order to deceive her, Fan Cheng also kept on coaxing her, sending her some valuable cosmetics and jewellery which made her ecstatic.Who knew that when He Yan learned that he was about to marry a wife, she would go to his house to kick up a tantrum? His married wife was Cheng Lang\u2019s eldest daughter. If Cheng Lang knew that, they might have cancelled the marriage. So Fan Cheng told his servants to deal with He Yan.Even after he learned that He Yan was very sad at that time and even tried to kill herself in front of the door of his house, he was too lazy to care about her. Afterwards, he married his wife and everything went well.After his newly-married phase was over, Fan Cheng reverted back to his old self. But his new wife was very fierce and he was tightly controlled. He could not go to brothels like before. Even a few of his concubines were dismissed. At that time, Fan Cheng started to miss He Yan.He Yan\u2019s temperament was different from his fierce wife. She was easy to coax, although sometimes he needed to give her gifts and play cute. Fan Cheng asked some of his people to go to He Yan\u2019s place only to know that she was seriously ill after she left the Fan Manor that day. After she recovered, she often didn\u2019t go out alone. She and her brother occasionally went Zui Yu Restaurant to sell Da Nai cakes.He didn\u2019t expect to meet them here.He Yan seemed to be different from before.He noticed that her expression was not as pleasing and charming as it used to be, and she was kind of speaking frankly. Still the same eyebrows, but with a little more vitality, along with a bit of heroism that was not there before. It was this kind of heroism that made her beautiful face seem very different. Even the polite smile on her lips made people unable to blink their eyes and keep staring.\u201cYou\u2019re still mad at me.\u201d Fan Cheng said glumly.He was sure that He Yan was also interested in him. She used to like him a lot before, how could she suddenly have no feelings for him? As long as he apologized to her and gave her some gifts, she would forgive him. For a woman like her, it was more than enough for him to persuade her by saying a few sugar-coated words. He could swear to the heavens and she would even die for him.He Yan didn\u2019t know what was going through Fan Cheng\u2019s mind. She had already expressed everything clearly to him. She turned back and asked the old tailor, \u201cHas the size been measured?\u201dThe old tailor nodded and said yes.\u201cThis is the deposit,\u201d He Yan put the money on the desk, \u201cWhen will it be done?\u201d\u201cTwenty days later, spring and summer clothes will be done. But winter clothes will take more time, a little more than a month.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d He Yan smiled, \u201cWe\u2019ll be here twenty days later to take it, please make it more fashionable.\u201d She pointed to He Yun Sheng and said, \u201cLittle children love pretty things.\u201d\u201cWho loves pretty things?!\u201d He Yun Sheng immediately became indignant.The old tailor smiled and nodded his head again.He Yan and He Yun Sheng strode out of the tailor shop after bidding Fan Cheng farewell.When Fan Cheng wanted to say something, He Yan had already walked away, but He Yun Sheng turned his head, and secretly waved his fist, his eyes full of warning.\u201cOh.\u201d Fan Cheng sneered.\u201cYoung master, Miss He Yan, this time to you\u2026\u201d The servant was very upset.\u201cNo problem.\u201d Fan Cheng waved his hand, \u201cShe is just a little angry.\u201dToday\u2019s He Yan was very different from the past one. Fan Cheng suddenly thought that he had spent so much time on her, but in fact, he had never taken advantage of her.How could he let something that was already his escape from his grasp? Since they met here today, why not continue and do good things together?Fan Cheng\u2019s face broke into a victorious smile.E/N: It\u2019s\u00a0a bit mean to be reborn.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He chatted the entire way back home, more like a grandma than a youth.\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t believe you. It\u2019s just that, that one surnamed Fan is too cunning and liable to lie.\u201d He Yun Sheng continued talking to himself, \u201cWhat\u2019s so good about a man like him? You were blind when you first saw him. If you ask me, General Feng Yun is the one who is truly worthy of admiration\u2026\u2026\u201dUnbeknownst to He Yun Sheng, his murmuring was heard by He Yan. She let the words enter one ear and leave through the other. But when she heard the last statement, she suddenly interjected, \u201cWhat does this have to do with Xiao Jue?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the Xiao family\u2019s second son handsome?\u201d He Yun Sheng probed.Not only was he handsome, but his demeanour and bearing were also delicate and neat.\u201cWell\u2026\u2026 handsome.\u201d\u201cWhat about his family background?\u201dAs for his family, General Xiao, Xiao Zhong Wu was the Emperor\u2019s beloved general who accompanied him to countless battles throughout ten thousand miles of rivers and mountains and was together with him in victory and defeat. Not only that, his wife was also the Empress Dowager\u2019s niece. As for his two sons, the eldest became a senior official/doctor at a very young age. The second son, Xiao Jue, was now a chief commander and his status was sky-rocketing. He was the well-known General Feng Yun.\u201cVery good.\u201d\u201cWhat about his cultural and military strategies?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026one in a million. Superb!\u201d\u201cThis is what I don\u2019t understand.\u201d He Yun Sheng came up with a conclusion, \u201cThis man, who is not only so handsome but is also from a golden household with no flaws, is he not worth admiring? If I were a woman, I would admire only him my whole life!\u201dHe Yan: \u201c\u2026\u2026you can just be quiet.\u201dAlthough Xiao Jue had thousands of good aspects, that indifferent, cold and irritating temperament of his was very uncomfortable. Add to it a huge bunch of women who were crazy for him, despite his cold temper. She guessed that there was no woman admired by him until then. Did that guy even give a second glance to a woman? The answer would be a big \u2018no\u2019. That man was extremely arrogant, and his expectations were as high as the sky. She suspected that even she couldn\u2019t catch up to him.One had to wonder what kind of beautiful girl he would choose in the future, a peerless beauty that could make the gaudy swallows and orioles pale with envy1.He Yan was looking forward to it.He Yun Sheng suddenly stopped walking, \u201cWhat is going on over there?\u201dNot far away, was a notice posted on the stone wall beside the road, and quite a few people were gathered around it. He Yan and He Yun Sheng walked a little closer to it to see what was written on the notice. As they went near, they got to know what it was.\u201cIt turned out to be a conscription document.\u201d\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been that long since they recruited troops. Why are they suddenly recruiting troops again?\u201dHe Yun Sheng asked suspiciously.Unlike He Yun Sheng, He Yan was clear on this matter. She had spent several years with Xiao Jue settling the chaos of West and South but ignored the neighbouring Uto. The people of Uto, no longer able to hide their ambitious nature, took advantage of the years of development and growth. Even after marrying into the Xu family, she had been paying attention to the northwest fortress. This conscription document was about going to Liang Zhou; to station recruits and train them.He Yun Sheng looked at the conscription notice, tore it from the wall and kept the ripped part with him.He Yan said, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Nothing, just want to keep it as a memorial.\u201d He Yun Sheng continued, \u201cUnfortunately, I am not strong enough now to go and fight to kill the enemy. In the future, when the level of my martial arts is higher, I will go and join the army.\u201dHe Yan smiled, \u201cJoining the army is not an easy task. You have to suffer from the wind and sand, watching the sacrifices of the people around you. On the battlefield, you have to be prepared to die at any time. You don\u2019t even dare to kill the fish\u2026\u2026 how are you going to kill the enemy?\u201dHe Yun Sheng was struck dumb. He spoke after a while, \u201cYou are speaking as if you have been there.\u201dHe Yan didn\u2019t say anything and continued walking home with him. She tilted her head down and smiled.Of course, she had been there, when she was the same age as He Yun Sheng.At that time, the Fu Yue Army was recruiting troops to Mo Xian. After arguing with her adoptive father, He Yuan Sheng, again, she secretly packed some silver and clothes, concealed herself using a mask and left for the army in the middle of the night.She had used He Ru Fei\u2019s name to join the army.No one, including the He family, expected that He Yan would go join the army. It wasn\u2019t until He Yan fought her first victorious battle, was promoted to an official position and received the rewards, did this matter reach the ears of the He family.The time she joined the army was not as smooth-sailing as others thought. She was a teenager, still a girl cross-dressing as a teenage boy, had to be careful not to be disowned, and had to compete with men who were stronger than she was. On the battlefield, even more so, as she couldn\u2019t cry nor utter a complaint. She was often scolded by generals, and many a time couldn\u2019t even say anything when she was being robbed of military honors, and despite this, she had to laugh and pour tea with her superiors.He Yan felt that before joining the army she was a dumb, indifferent little girl who hid everything in her heart but after joining the army, she learned to grow up.Outside of life and death, everything else was trivial, and living was what mattered most. General Fei Hong had replaced the He family\u2019s young lady, and since then she had persevered step by step, her suffering unspeakable to others.Thinking about it, the name of General Fei Hong was closely related to her life. So close that when she saw the ripped conscription document in He Yun Sheng\u2019s hands, she was not as calm as she seemed.He Yan\u2019s sudden silence was noticed by He Yun Sheng, who thought that she was still thinking about Fan Cheng\u2019s matters. After returning home, he asked He Yan to go back to fer room.Qing Mei had long since retired, and the notice that He Yun Sheng had torn was still placed on the table, under the oil lamp. The thin paper weighed heavily on He Yan\u2019s heart.Having been busy with matters regarding the He family for so long, now that there was money and that He Yun Sheng had found a school, she could plan for herself. But, how was she going to approach He Ru Fei? This was the biggest problem. As of that day, she had no power and her words carried no weight. If she went to fight against those people, no one would listen to what she said.In her last life, when she was living as He Ru Fei, and later on as Mistress Xu, she only knew how to fight with the sword and had no idea about anything related to conspiracies. Even now after being reborn, she still couldn\u2019t do those dirty and insidious things.What did she have? She only had this life. What could she do? All she could do was fight and kill the enemy.But what could she do at this moment?He Yan\u2019s eyes fell on the conscription notice, and those few lines of words brought up a surge of emotions that had been bottled up in her heart till then, and she felt as if she had returned to her fifteen-year-old self. Having made the decision, taking advantage of the darkness of the night, she took some silver and tied a bundle of cloth on her back as she ran into the army camp. Once she reached there, she immediately wrote down her name and began her new career in the army.Everything had to be done again, from scratch.It was the worst way but also the best.She was going to start from square one, but this time with her own name, He Yan.1\u00a0\u83ba\u60ed\u71d5\u5992: make the gaudy swallows and orioles pale with envy (idiom); fig. so beautiful that even swallows and orioles feel jealous of herPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He Yan went to find a young manservant for He Yun Sheng who could help him to carry things and run errands. Qing Mei could also have a partner to talk with at home.He Yun Sheng had already handed over his responsibilities to his servant and started going to academy every day, leaving He Yan alone in the house. In the absence of He Sui, He Yan was accompanied by Qing Mei and could always practice sword fighting in the yard\u2026\u2026 ahem, with broken branches.Her skills were engraved in her mind, but the body was really weak. Even if she fell down a little, the bruises that formed were rather obvious. Although He Yan diligently practiced everyday, her strength was not great. Compared to the past, it was still lacking.It was a given that she couldn\u2019t go to the battlefield with a weak body. She sighed in her heart and laid down the branch.\u201cMiss, Miss,\u201d Qing Mei trotted in, \u201cSomeone was here to deliver something again.\u201dHe Yan frowned, \u201cWho was it?\u201d\u201cThis servant doesn\u2019t know. They just delivered the things and left.\u201d Qing Mei was very embarrassed. \u201cMiss, what should we do now? When the Young Master comes back from the academy, he will surely be enraged.\u201dIt was none other than the servants of the Fan family who came to deliver things. Since the day he saw He Yan in the tailor\u2019s shop, Fan Cheng had sent his servants to deliver things every now and then. It was always rouge powder, satin, jewelry or tonic soup.He Yan asked Fan Cheng\u2019s servant to return back every time when they came to deliver something. He Yun Sheng always got furious whenever he came to know about the matter and would annoy He Yan by constantly yelling in her room. Because of this He Yan stopped going out these days for fear that she might run into Fan Cheng again thereby causing He Yun Sheng to raise the roof1\u00a0of the Fan family.But today they were being excessive, what did they mean by leaving after putting things down? Were they confident that she would accept them whole-heartedly?He Yan ordered, \u201cThrow the things out.\u201d\u201cBut,\u201d Qing Mei reluctantly said, \u201cThey are all expensive satin and jewelry\u2026\u2026 throwing them out would be a big deal.\u201dHe Yan felt a headache.For heaven\u2019s sake, she had lived her last life like a man and never met such a stubborn suitor. Although she later returned to the He family and was betrothed to Xu Zhi Hheng, Xu Zhi Heng never went out of line, and even alienated her, let alone reach such a degree of ingratiation. She did not know how other girls could deal with this type of situation.What if such valuable things were thrown away, and the Fan family didn\u2019t come to realize it?He Yan sighed and conceded, \u201cI will send them back myself.\u201dQing Mei\u2019s eyes were wide open in shock and replied,\u00a0 \u201cDoes the Miss want to go to the door of the Fan mansion?\u201d\u201cIs there any other way?\u201d He Yan said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you pack up and come with me?\u201d\u201cDo you want this maid to accompany you?\u201d Qing Mei shrank for a moment.\u201cOf course.\u201d He Yan looked at her strangely, \u201cI can\u2019t remember the way to the Fan mansion.\u201dShe was not the original He Yan, that was why she didn\u2019t know the way to the Fan mansion. Naturally, she had to find someone to lead the way. However, looking at the appearance of Qing Mei lingering in fear, it became obvious that her last visit to the Fan mansion must have not been very pleasant.Qing Mei was really truly perturbed. She recalled the last time she accompanied He Yan to the Fan family. He Yan\u2019s eyes were red from crying and she had almost been killed in the Fan mansion. At that time, the madam of the Fan family had peered down at them and had condescendingly remarked, \u201cPeople should know their own places instead of always thinking of climbing high branches and staring at the impossible things, so as not to fall and be ridiculed.\u201dThe irony inside and out of the story was really harsh. Finally, He Yan had lost her breath and fainted. He Sui had asked the doctor to come and visit her. The doctor had said that she collapsed due to cardiac arrest. At that time, everyone thought that He Yan was doomed to die after this attack and would not make it. They didn\u2019t expect that when she woke up, she seemed to turn into a totally different person, not even mentioning Fan Cheng at all.Even though Fan Cheng came to pester her Miss, she never entangled herself with him and tried to make a clear-break.Qing Mei was a little relieved, but she was still concerned. He Yan patted her on the shoulder and comforted her, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, no one will bully you.\u201dQing Mei inexplicably felt at ease.The two of them left together. The Fan family lived far away from the He family, and it took them a long time to get there. Qing Mei pointed to the scarlet gate of a house and said, \u201cThis is the Fan mansion.\u201dHe Yan thought for a moment and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not convenient for me to go over there. You take these things and give them to the gatekeeper. Tell him that they were sent by Fan\u00a0gongzi\u00a0to the He family, and that they must be handed over to Fan\u00a0gongzi.\u201dQing Mei nodded, \u201cThis servant understands.\u201dHe Yan then hid behind the pillar facing the street and watched Qing Mei walking to the guard. She conveyed her Miss\u2019 orders and gave the basket containing the gift to the guard. She returned to He Yan, smiling, \u201cThis servant has said everything!\u201d\u201cWell done,\u201d He Yan said, \u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201d*In the main house of the Fan family, because of the recent marriage, the layout of the house was still red and festive. Tang Ying, Cheng Wu Lang\u2019s eldest daughter, was spoiled and domineering from childhood. Because of the relationship with Lord Tang, the Fan family had to spoil her. Now she has just been married into the Fan family for a few months and had become the head of the Fan family from both inside and out.The pageboy knocked at the door.\u201cCome in.\u201d Tang Ying was sitting on the soft couch, admiring the embroidery she had just made.After the boy came in, he kowtowed to Tang Ying, and then said, \u201cMadam, a servant girl just came outside the door and sent in a basket and said she wanted to give it to the young master.\u201dWhen Tang Ying heard this she made a movement and looked at the boy, \u201cServant girl? What basket? Bring it here and let me a look.\u201dThe boy carried the basket forward.Tang Ying picked it up and fiddled with it a few times, and when she saw that it was full of women\u2019s satin cloth and rouge powder, she became furious, \u201cWhat is this?\u201dThe young man dared not speak.The maid next to her said, \u201cThese are all things for women, Madam. The young master doesn\u2019t use these, so it must be\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt must be that he wanted to fawn over some lady, and she returned them to him!\u201d Tang Ying stood up abruptly and brushed the porcelain cups off the table, and the porcelain crackled all over the floor. She looked ferocious and said, \u201cFan Cheng, this bastard!\u201dThe maid reminded her, \u201cMadam, it\u2019s not impossible to investigate the young master, but you must not give him a chance to be alert.\u201dTang Ying calmed down a little and then said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. There\u2019s no reason to guard against thieves for a thousand days.2\u00a0If she was from a good family, how could she collude with Fan Cheng? I think that slut was just trying to get him. Damn it!\u201dShe instructed the boy who kept his head down, \u201cFrom today onward, you are to follow Fan Cheng. See where he goes and who he meets. You are to report everything directly to me. I would like to see what kind of fox has enchanted him. I want to meet that bitch\u2026\u2026 I must make this couple pay a hefty price!\u201dThe young man nodded his head and retreated.The servant girl persuaded, \u201cMadam, calm down. We must remain indifferent so as to prevent any suspicion. If the young master got suspicious, he might hide the woman.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Tang Ying clenched her fists tightly. \u201cIn the past, when I dismissed his beautiful concubines, he never uttered a\u00a0 word, but now I see that he has become so fearless that he is not taking even me, his rightful wife, in his eyes.\u201d1\u00a0to raise the roof: It means to be extremely noisy and boisterous, complain loudly and angrily.2\u00a0No reason to guard against thieves for a thousand days: \u00a0It means people have limited energy, let alone coping passively, which consumes more energy. It is difficult to achieve long-term prevention, and there are always times of negligence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Soon, Fan\u00a0gongzi\u2018s secret was discovered by Tang Ying.\u201cUnreasonable!\u201d Tang Ying slammed the tea cup that she held in her hands on the table, \u201cWhen both families were discussing the marriage, he had an affair with an outside woman. This man simply does not have me in his eyes. My brother had told me before that this person was unreliable, and now it has been proven true.\u201d\u201cMadam, be at ease,\u201d said the maid, \u201cThe young master still does not dare bring the woman into the house, which shows that there are still some scruples. It\u2019s because this woman knows how to control a man\u2019s heart, which is why the young master made a mistake. Now, the madam and the young master are newly married couple. And this matter has attracted other\u2019s jealousy.\u201d\u201cThen what do you think I should do?\u201d Tang Ying asked angrily.\u201cIt\u2019s better to start with this woman, but she\u2019s just the daughter of a drill field officer, and it\u2019s beneath madam to handle her\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are right.\u201d Tang Ying calmed down after a while, \u201cShe is just a lowly woman, but she is delusional to think that she can marry into the Fan family and become a wife. I will meet her in person.\u201dHe Yan, on the other hand, had no idea about these twists and turns that took place in the Fan family. She thought about how to take care of the paperwork at the conscription office so that she could teach herself, in order to enter the barracks and go to Liang Zhou.He Yun Sheng and He Sui could not be notified about the situation and for this she needed to find a good excuse. If she said that she wanted more achievements\u2014\u2014they would think she had gone crazy. If she said revenge\u2026 forget it, it still wouldn\u2019t work.She tossed and turned around in bed while she thought how similar the matter was when she had previously run away from home. That night, there was no moon and the wind was fast.She knew that the conscription would come to end in the next two days, so if the documents were not filled in properly, she would lose this chance.As she thought about it, Qing Mei came in carrying a cake in her hands, and was shocked to see He Yan tossing and turning in the bed, \u201cYoung miss, you have been lying in the bed since noon, did you eat something bad? This servant will quickly go and find someone to take a look at Miss.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He Yan waved her hand, \u201cIt\u2019s just that I am bored.\u201dNot to mention, when He Yun Sheng was at home, it would be very noisy. Now that he went to school, He Yan felt bored. Even if she practised martial arts in the house, it still did not relieve her boredom. He Yan felt that people were really strange.She lived in the Xu family house for a whole year and she used to feel lonely, but she was already used to it. But after she came here, she was accustomed to having He Yun Sheng around her, and now that she was alone for more than a month, she felt forlorn.It was probably only He Yun Sheng whom she could say this about.He Yan turned over and said to Qing Mei, \u201cI am going out for a while.\u201d\u201cWhere is the young miss going? This servant will accompany you.\u201d Qing Mei said hurriedly.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m going to get He Yun Sheng\u2019s clothes at the tailor shop.\u201d He Yan replied. It had already been twenty days. He Yun Sheng\u2019s summer and spring clothes should be ready. Since He Yun Sheng was at the school, she wanted to help him pick it up.Before she left, she glanced at the conscription notice on the table, and after musing for a moment, she slid the notice in her sleeves, without knowing why she wanted to do this.A long time later, in the future, when He Yan recalled this scene today, she only felt that fate was very mysterious. Since she picked up the notice, the wheels of fate overturned the clouds and rains, and swept her into the game again.It was already afternoon, and the weather was good. He Yan reached the tailor shop with the help of her memory. The old tailor in the shop recognized He Yan when she came in and smiled at her, \u201cYou are finally here. These clothes are ready. The boy didn\u2019t come today?\u201d\u201cHe went to school.\u201d He Yan smiled, as she handed over the remaining silver, \u201cMaster is good at craftsmanship.\u201dThe spring and summer clothes are beautifully sewn, the style is simple and the material is also light weight and would look elegant on He Yun Sheng when he wears this,\u00a0He Yan thought. He Yun Sheng would definitely like it. She folded the two pieces of clothes and placed them in the bag before stepping out of the tailor shop. Just as she stepped out, a strange maid came forward.\u201cAre you Miss He Yan?\u201dDid I meet yet another acquaintance of the original owner of this body?\u00a0He Yan sighed in her heart, but since He Yun Sheng was not around, she did not know who this person was.\u201cExactly.\u201d He Yan tried to make herself look more natural.The maid smiled and said, \u201cMy lady is just around here. I wanted to invite you to talk about something with my lady.\u201dYour lady?\u00a0He Yan thought for a moment. She was not the real He Yan, and if that person was an old acquaintance of the original He Yan, she may expose herself. After she decided, she declined the maid\u2019s offer, \u201cIt would be inconvenient for me today. Is it fine if we meet another day?\u201dThe maid was embarrassed, \u201cThis servant cannot decide anything about this matter, please come with me to see my lady. It won\u2019t take a lot of time and my lady wants to talk about something important with you.\u201dIn this life, He Yan was most afraid of the getting the He family into any sort of danger because of her. The maid looked so embarrassed that He Yan felt like she was causing trouble for her, so her heart couldn\u2019t help but soften. When she heard that the other person wanted to talk about something important, He Yan\u2019s heart jumped up, thinking,\u00a0If it really is an important matter then what can I do if I don\u2019t know anything about it?After He Yan struggled for a moment, she said, \u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019ll go with you. But I still have something to do and thus won\u2019t be able to stay for long.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d The maid replied.The maid led the way and He Yan gazed at the maid in front of her. Although this woman claimed to be a servant and even had the appearance of one, her garments were of high quality, and even the jewelry that she wore did not look ordinary. At the very least, the maid of an ordinary family could not be like her. Either she was the maid of a big family, or the maid of a rich lady. But, according to He Yan, she could be both.As she was thinking, He Yan found out that they had arrived at a small alley.\u201cYour lady is here?\u201d He Yan asked.\u201cOur lady has a house here but she rarely lives here.\u201d The maid continued to speak with a smile, \u201cOccasionally, the nearby restaurant holds little banquets here.\u201dOh\u2026it really is a big family.\u00a0Even the members had their own houses. He Yan was speechless in her heart. If He Yun Sheng knew this, he would probably be envious for a long time.\u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201d The maid stopped in front of a house.The house was not big and even looked a bit old. There were no people around this street\u2014\u2014not even a gatekeeper stood at the door.He Yan went in after the maid, after she passed the garden, the maid brought her in a hall. After she came here, the maid suddenly dropped her gentle fa\u00e7ade and said coldly to the other person in the hall, \u201cMadam, this servant has brought that person here.\u201dHe Yan raised her head and her eyes came in contact with an angry face.\u201cYou are He Yan?\u201dThis didn\u2019t look like a meeting between old friends.\u201cI am, and you are\u2026?\u201d\u201cI am the eldest daughter of Cheng Wu Lang and the wife of Fan Cheng.\u201d The lady replied fiercely with a sneer.He Yan realized what was going on in an instant and she secretly sighed in her heart while she looked at the maid.This lady seemed to have misunderstood something.What kind of sin had she committed in her previous life to be reborn as a rotten peach girl?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She pointed at her nose and scolded, \u201cMisunderstanding? You and Fan Cheng had an affair before I joined the family, and after I married him, you were still unhappy. Otherwise, why would you be fine being a mistress of a married man, I see that you\u2019re dead set on being the main madam of my Fan family!\u201dHe Yan had a headache.That lady was truly unreasonable. Even though she looked like a flowery and slender woman, she had a vulgar way of talking. \u201cMadam, you must inquire thoroughly. I knew Mr Fan before but I haven\u2019t looked for him since the marriage.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re lying. If you hadn\u2019t approached him, how could he give you something?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m also very troubled about this. If Madam could persuade Mr Fan not to do something like this, it would be appreciated.\u201dTang Ying stumbled a few steps back and fell into a chair. Two lines of tears slid down her face, \u201cBastard\u2026 What a bastard!\u201dHe Yan looked at her sympathetically. Any fool could see that Fan Cheng was not a good match for her. Even if he stopped looking for He Yan, he would find some other woman in the future. He Yan didn\u2019t look up to him, but a few people would be willing to sacrifice themselves to climb to a higher branch. The eldest daughter of Cheng Wu Lang was more than enough for Fan Cheng. It was a pity that even with her beauty and such good background she was still tied up with Fan Cheng for the rest of her life.Tang Ying\u2019s maids and nanny quickly approached to comfort Tang Ying in a low voice. After a while, Tang Ying dried her tears.She said, \u201cYou little bitch, you are used to lying. How could I believe your nonsense even for a moment?\u201d\u201cWhat exactly does Madam want?\u201d He Yan looked at the sky. \u201cIt\u2019s getting late, I should go back.\u201dThe woman who was consoling Tang Ying said, \u201cGo back? You\u2019ve done such shameless things and you still want to go back. Until our Lady has a good idea of what to do with you, you have to stay here!\u201dHe Yan retorted, \u201cYou dare to imprison me privately?\u201dThe old woman looked at He Yan with disdain and said, \u201cThose who come out of small doors are not sensible. How can this be regarded as imprisonment? Since you are our young master\u2019s favourite, you\u2019re half Fan. Isn\u2019t it appropriate for our lady, as a Madam of the house, to teach a servant a lesson? Even if you sue us, our actions are justified!\u201dHe Yan was angry but she laughed. How could someone spew so much nonsense with such a serious face?Seeing He Yan laugh, Tang Ying, who was originally a bit hesitant, became angry. \u201cTie her up and throw her in the backroom, starve her for a night. We\u2019ll see tomorrow whether she\u2019s still so arrogant!\u201dIn the end, she was just a lady from a big family, who had recently married into her husband\u2019s family. She hadn\u2019t had the time to learn those thunderous and ruthless tactics, to vent out her anger. It was just a matter of tying people up and starving them so that they would be scared. He Yan was not afraid of it, but she was just scared of causing trouble for the He family as she was the eldest child of the family.The women rushed and bundled her up like a chicken. He Yan stayed still during the entire and obediently let them tie her. Tang Ying looked at He Yan with a heart full of frustration.When they finished tying her up, they threw He Yan on the bed of the backroom. The maid asked, \u201cMadam, do you want to leave someone here to keep watch\u2026\u201d\u201cLeave what?\u201d Tang Ying said angrily, \u201cLet her stay here alone until it gets dark and see if she\u2019s afraid. If she is robbed by a passing thief,\u201d she smiled viciously. \u201cI\u2019ll see if Fan Cheng would still want her!\u201dThe group of people walked away mightily, bringing the courtyard to a standstill.He Yan lay flat on the floor with her hands tied to her feet, looking quietly at the bed.Needless to say, the bed was very soft, and the curtains were made of delicate soft gauze. It seemed that Madam Fan was quite kind to her prisoner. She sighed. The house that Mrs Fan settled her in casually was even more beautiful than the house carefully built by He Sui.\u2018The house is still empty all day, isn\u2019t it a waste?\u2019 She thought indecisively. After the time taken to brew a cup of tea had passed, ensuring that there was no more movement outside, she tampered with the rope.The hands were tied, which felt a little uncomfortable, but the method of binding was random; similar to bundling up like a dumpling. She tried to reach out and touch the knot. Being in the barracks for ten days, she had learned how to unbuckle the knot. Such unorganized knots were the simplest.He Yan felt the shape of the knot and was certain that it could be solved, so she stretched out her hands to do just that. As she was about to move, she heard the sound of footsteps outside. The sound was very low but with her sharp hearing, she recognized a male\u2019s voice. She stopped her movements and tilted her head to look outside the door.Was Tang Ying telling the truth about her being a flower here?The sound of footsteps became more prominent as the person approached step by step. He Yan became a little nervous. She fiddled inside her sleeve for a long time and finally found a sharpened, pointed bamboo branch.It was too expensive to go to the weapon shop and build a hidden weapon. And she was too frugal and poor to have that much money. In such desperate situations, all she could do was to pick up a bamboo branch and sharpen it herself. He Yan pitied herself thinking about it.The door was pushed open and a man dressed as a guard walked in.He was shocked when he saw He Yan with her eyes open and her mouth blocked by a piece of cloth, but he kept looking at her quietly. After a while, he walked towards and whispered in her ear, \u201cMiss He Yan, don\u2019t be afraid. Master asked me to help you.\u201dIt turned out that he was not there to pick flowers but save lives.The guard removed the cloth from her mouth and carried her on his shoulder. \u201cThis slave will send you out first.\u201dHe Yan was so unaccustomed to this posture that she felt as if she had become someone else\u2019s captive and was about to be dragged out to be beheaded by the enemy.But if other people had a good heart, it was hard to say anything.The guard took He Yan into a carriage, which quickly left the Fan\u2019s house. He Yan didn\u2019t utter a word which perplexed the guard a little.He thought he would hear her screaming and crying when he went in. After all, Miss He was a timid and weak woman. Even though she was gagged, she looked curious and guarded but there was no fear in her eyes.The guard had not seen such a woman. He inexplicably felt some shiver in his heart. Fortunately, the carriage was agile, and in about an incense stick of time, they arrived at the destination.The guard helped He Yan out of the carriage.The sky was already completely dark.The Chun Lai River at night, without the hustle-bustle of the day, had become quiet and still. On such a night, there should have been many floating boats in the river with people singing, dancing, drinking and merrymaking. But that day, due to the heavy rain, the wind was cold. Only a few boats were floating in the river. A few fire lanterns could be seen, looking very lonely.He Yan raised her head and the rain fell on her face, cold and itchy. She looked at the distance, \u201cWhy did you bring me here?\u201dThe guard didn\u2019t dare look at her face. He clenched his fists and said, \u201cThe young master is waiting for you on the boat ahead. This slave will take you there.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were only a few, scattered stars that could be seen in the dark sky. The lights near the river bank shone onto the surface of the water, and so He Yan could vaguely see her own reflection.The guard rowed the little boat towards the ornately decorated ship in the center of the river.He Yan hung her head and was silent. The guard couldn\u2019t help but turn his head to look back at He Yan, and saw the girl sitting at the stern of the boat, upright, still, with both her hands tied with rope. She raised her head ever so slightly and stared at him, as if she was aware that he was looking at her. The guard shuddered, the oar clutched in his hand almost falling into the river.Her cold stare stupefied him.He couldn\u2019t describe that eerie feeling. It was like a dead person was watching him. Combined with the sound of the wind-driven waves, she was like a ghost.The whole ordeal was strange, and the guard was worried. She didn\u2019t talk, and didn\u2019t ask for anything. Any other woman would ask at least one or two questions, but He Yan didn\u2019t. She was as quiet as a doll, as quiet as a dead person would be. It was completely silent.The water seemed to glisten underneath the colors of the night sky. It acted like a whirlpool, bringing back the memories she had tried to forget, like the time Wan Ru had dragged her by the hair and drowned her in the pond.She was once adept at swimming, but now, her entire body was tense and rigid, as if telling her she was terrified of water.She was afraid of falling into the water below, afraid of being sucked into an endless whirlpool, and afraid that she wouldn\u2019t be able to make it back to the surface. She was afraid that the light would move farther and farther away from her, until it was completely dark. She was afraid that her life would come to an abrupt end, and she couldn\u2019t do anything about it.She felt disgusted by her own cowardice and fear, but she couldn\u2019t think of any other way. She could only sit silently in that small boat and allow herself to be rowed towards the ship.The ship must have been owned by someone wealthy. It was slightly smaller than a cargo ship, but larger than a fisherman\u2019s boat. The guard helped He Yan up into the boat, lifted the curtain, and escorted her in.He then proceeded to leave in the small boat, as if he was ordered by others to not approach the ship.He Yan stared at the person in front of him.Fan Cheng was dressed well today, with clothing that was extravagant and expensive. Inside the cabin, an aromatic incense had been lit and there were softly-lit lanterns. Upon entering, the first thing He Yan noticed was the beautiful fragrance.He Yan struggled to escape the whirlpool of memories that were spinning around in her brain as she faced Fan Cheng and said, \u201cFan Gong Zi.\u201dFan Cheng walked towards, pulled a chair out from underneath a table, and made her sit on it.\u201cAh He, you were wronged.\u201dHe Yan was silent.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that woman to be so vicious towards you, going as far as to abduct you and tie you up. If I didn\u2019t have somebody secretly protecting you, the consequences would have been unimaginable. Ah He, do you understand my pain now?\u201d Fan Cheng lamented.He Yan looked at the rope tied around her feet, shook her head, and replied, \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201dFan Cheng\u2019s guards had forced her into a carriage, rowed her in a boat, and then onto the ship where she was now. Not once did they untie the rope binding her hands.Her wrists had ached as they chafed against the thick rope, but she hadn\u2019t said a thing.Fan Cheng stared into her eyes and tried to explain. \u201cI was afraid you\u2019d misunderstand me and refuse to board the ship, so I didn\u2019t unbind the rope.\u201dHowever, even after saying this, he still didn\u2019t do anything about the rope.\u201cI\u2019m on a boat.\u201d He Yan said whilst laughing. \u201cWhere could I possibly run to? It wouldn\u2019t do any harm to untie me.\u201dHer smile was as radiant as the morning sun, unspeakably bright. Fan Cheng was stunned. He Yan wasn\u2019t a very obedient child, so he didn\u2019t think He Yan had grown up to be so bold and courageous.The more he thought about it, the more he itched to reach out and stroke her face. He smiled slightly, kneeled in front of He Yan, looked her in the eyes and said, \u201cAh He, I\u2019m not trying to keep you captive. You just need to understand your current situation.\u201d\u201cMy wife is known to be jealous. She will never let you go. Even If you decide to return today, she\u2019ll try to find you tomorrow. Your father\u2019s just a drill field officer, while my father-in-law is the right hand of the emperor. There are plenty of places where things could go terribly wrong if you decide to leave. In the end, nothing matters if you aren\u2019t safe.\u201d\u201cYour house is unprotected, with barely any maidservants and no guards. Once she catches you, she\u2019ll torture you with her twisted ways. I-I won\u2019t be able to bear it.\u201dFan Cheng looked at her affectionately. \u201cHow could I stand to watch you suffer?\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d He Yan exclaimed as she started to secretly unbind the rope. She quietly asked, \u201cWhat are you planning to do?\u201dFan Cheng was overjoyed at seeing her finally relax. \u201cI\u2019m going to hide you somewhere safe so my wife won\u2019t be able to find you. There\u2019ll be servants and guards waiting on you everyday. When the time comes, I\u2019ll bring you back. Once you\u2019re the mistress of the Fan family, nobody would dare to take advantage of you.\u201d\u201cMistress?\u201d He Yan asked.\u201cYes.\u201d Fan Cheng said assertively as he placed a hand over his heart. \u201cAh He, you have been and will be the only one in my heart. I promise. If this marriage hadn\u2019t been arranged long ago, I would\u2019ve never married her! You need not worry, I\u2019ll only love one person in this life \u2013 and that is you. You just need to wait\u2026\u201dHe Yan chuckled after hearing this.Fan Cheng was taken aback.\u201cAren\u2019t you just trying to make me your outside mistress?\u201d He Yan said softly.It was true that if the He family\u2019s eldest daughter was here, she would\u2019ve been moved to tears by this oath. However, she wasn\u2019t. It was clear. If a man wanted to cheat on a woman, he would be able to tell all sorts of lies. Why would Fan Cheng ever want to marry her?If she hadn\u2019t experienced the same thing with Xu Zhi Heng, she might\u2019ve been tricked. Fan Cheng had looked at her the same way he did, as if she was pathetic and ridiculous.\u201cAh He, you\u2026\u201d Fan Cheng frowned.\u201cFan Gong Zi, I\u2019ve already made it quite clear. Since you\u2019re already married, I\u2019m going to let go of our past and go separate ways. I have no intention in being entangled with you, and I\u2019m hoping that you\u2019ll stop bothering me.\u201dThe knot on the rope had been loosened.Fan Cheng didn\u2019t see the rope fall to the ground, so he looked at her with a puzzled expression. After a moment of silence, he suddenly sneered. \u201cHe Yan, you must be joking. I\u2019m coaxing you kindly, and yet you\u2019re so rude! Entanglement? There are so many women in this world. Why would I continue pestering you? It\u2019s just a pity that the time I spent with you was utterly wasted!\u201d\u201cDoes Fan\u00a0gong-zi\u00a0want me to repay the time I\u2019ve wasted with silver or gold?\u201dHe Yan found it ridiculous.\u201cI don\u2019t lack money. Why don\u2019t you give yourself to me instead?\u201d He smirked. \u201cIf you serve me well, I may even pay you.\u201dBefore He Yan could reply, a furious voice was suddenly heard. \u201cWhat bullsh*t did you put in this?\u201dHe Yan turned around to see the curtain lifted and a dripping-wet man walk in. It was He Yun Sheng.An original fanart featuring He Yan by the very translator of this chapter,\u00a0Not-A-TL\u00a0aka\u00a0Dot.See you after two weeks!

She looked again and found that it was indeed He Yun Sheng.He Yun Sheng had already walked up to her, and after shielding her, he pushed Fan Cheng far away.\u201cYou\u2026how did you get up here?!\u201d Fan Cheng stood still and pointed at him, his eyes were full of surprise.\u201cSwam up, of course.\u201d He Yun Sheng roared.As soon as he got up from the water, his whole body was dripping wet. He squatted down to relieve the rope on He Yan\u2019s feet.\u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d\u201cI was afraid that Fan Cheng would pester you, so I sent Shuang Qing back to guard the place earlier, but who knew that he would just see you being called away.\u201d Shuang Qing was the boy He Yan had bought for He Yun Sheng, who accompanied him to the academy on weekdays.\u201cShuang Qing followed you here and kept me informed about the situation. So I ran all the way and swam here. Fortunately, I caught up.\u201d He untied the rope binding He Yan\u2019s feet and was about to untie the rope around He Yan\u2019s hand but it was already loose. It was a little strange but he didn\u2019t think much about it. He straightened and glared at Fan Cheng, \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t made it in time, what would this beast have done to you?\u201d\u201cDo what?\u201d Fan Cheng finally came back to his senses. He looked at He Yun Sheng and said with a fearless smile, \u201cDo you think you can change anything by coming here?\u201dThere was no one on the boat except the three of them. They were probably afraid of disturbing Fan Cheng\u2019s \u201cmood\u201d. Even the guard who had just sent He Yan to the boat was nowhere to be found. He estimated that the guard might be rowing a small boat and was far away, waiting for Fan Cheng\u2019s orders, after the deed was done.\u201cYour sister will be mine sooner or later.\u201d Fan Cheng said with disdain. \u201cYou poured the wine first. Why should I be ashamed of drinking the wine which was served on my table? Who tried to climb my bed at first? Now you are pretending to be chaste!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d When He Yun Sheng heard the words, he turned pale with rage. He rushed forward and punched him, \u201cYou bastard!\u201dFan Cheng almost fell when he was attacked. The boat shook violently by his action, making He Yun Sheng stagger.He Yan frowned and was about to go to help but she saw something glinting in Fan Cheng\u2019s sleeve. She could vaguely see a silver light and her scalp tightened. She yelled, \u201cYun Sheng, dodge!\u201dHe Yun Sheng did not know what had happened, but subconsciously turned over. Fan Cheng took out a knife and pierced his clothes. Luckily, He Yun Sheng missed by inches.He Yun Sheng broke out in cold sweat, \u201cHow dare you!\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d Fan Cheng\u2019s face was ferocious. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if the son of a school lieutenant dies. When you die, I will enslave your sister for my entertainment, every day, and sell her to a brothel after I get tired of her.\u201d He started laughing maniacally.He Yan\u2019s eyes flashed with a trace of fierceness.Afraid of causing trouble to the He family, she did not want to fight Fan Cheng. But it seemed that Fan Cheng was not willing to give up; whether she made the move or not did not matter any more.He Yun Sheng was so angry that he simply turned his head and bumped into Fan Cheng\u2019s stomach. Fan Cheng was knocked down unexpectedly, and the boat wavered again as he fell to the ground. He was about to shout but before he could open his mouth He Yan warned, \u201cDon\u2019t let him make a sound!\u201d Immediately they rushed forward, stuffed the veil on the table into Fan Cheng\u2019s mouth.Fan Cheng was silenced. It was at that moment that He Yun Sheng swiftly rode on his back and started punching him. He was a teenager with great strength. Although Fan Cheng\u2019s mouth was fierce, he could not be He Yun Sheng\u2019s opponent. He gradually stopped struggling.\u201cYun Sheng, that\u2019s enough.\u201d He Yan stopped him. \u201cIf you hit any more, he will die.\u201d\u201cI wish he was dead!\u201d He Yun Sheng gritted his teeth. \u201cIf he died, he wouldn\u2019t dare to make trouble!\u201d\u201cBut the He family would be in trouble.\u201d He Yan pulled away He Yun Sheng\u2019s hand. \u201cGet him up first.\u201dHe Yun Sheng stood up leaving Fan Cheng motionless, facing the ground. He Yun Sheng stretched out his foot and kicked him, \u201cGet up, don\u2019t play dead!\u201dFan Cheng still showed no movement.\u201cI hit you twice and now you\u2019re pretending to be dead. You are expert in how to blackmail people.\u201d While mocking Fan Cheng, He Yun Sheng tried to kick him up. As he moved, he suddenly saw that the place where Fan Cheng was lying was gradually filled with a mass of red.\u201cHe, he\u2026\u201d He Yun Sheng stuttered.He Yan was listening carefully to the movement outside. The boat was swaying. She wondered if Fan Cheng\u2019s guards noticed it. There seemed to be nothing wrong at the moment. Maybe they thought it was due to Fan Cheng\u2019s \u201cmood\u201d. At that moment, she heard He Yun Sheng\u2019s sudden change in voice. He was looking at Fang Cheng strangely.A moment later, she squatted down and calmly turned Fan Cheng over.\u201cAh~\u201d He Yun Sheng gave a short cry but quickly covered his mouth and swallowed the rest of his words. He looked at the sight in disbelief.Fan Cheng was lying on his back. His body was soft; as if he had no bones. The clothes at his waist and abdomen had been dyed red with blood. A small part of the hilt was exposed while the blade of the knife was lost somewhere between his flesh and bones.During his fight with He Yun Sheng, Fan Cheng had pulled a short knife out of his sleeve. Later, the boat swayed and the knife fell to the ground. When He Yun Sheng had punched him again, he lost his balance. As he fell, the sharp knife pierced into his abdomen.It would not have entered so deep but He Yun Sheng also pressed him to the ground and punched him with his fist. This practically led the whole knife to penetrate further into his abdomen, causing his death.He Yun Sheng was frightened to the point that his legs became weak and he fell. He was horrified, \u201cHe\u2026he won\u2019t be\u2026\u201dHe Yan stretched out two fingers to probe Fan Cheng\u2019s nose, and uttered a single word, \u201cDead.\u201dHe Yun Sheng looked at her blankly as if he didn\u2019t comprehend what she said. A moment later, he started sobbing, \u201cHe\u2026how did he die? What shall we do? \u201cThe boat was still in the river, swaying and floating, and there seemed to be no other light around except for the lights inside the boat. In the dead silence, He Yun Sheng\u2019s sniffles were particularly distinct.He kept on murmuring, \u201cWhat should we do? What are we going to do?\u201dHe was just a teenager who had never seen blood, let alone kill a person. He even had to make a detour to kill a fish. He was only fierce in his words but he never expected that he would kill someone one day. He Yun Sheng was panicking.Looking at Fan Cheng\u2019s body, He Yan frowned.She had killed too many people but they were all enemies met on the battlefield. She had not been in a situation like this. Though she was a little surprised, she was not agitated at all. He Yun Sheng was in a trance, crying and laughing at the same time. He was shaking Fan Cheng\u2019s corpse as if trying to shake him awake. He seemed to have lost his mind.Smack!He Yun Sheng felt a burning pain on his face like that of being slapped. He woke up from his chaotic thoughts and looked at He Yan who was in front of him.He suddenly discerned that compared to him, He Yan was extremely calm. Her gaze was as sharp as a sword, piercing his heart. It made him shiver. Her hands were steady, unlike his, which were still shaking.Her voice was cold, laced with a tinge of hatred and harshness. \u201cHe Yun Sheng, wake up, he\u2019s already dead.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He Yun Sheng stared at He Yan blankly.Fan Cheng\u2019s wound was still bleeding, and the knife was impartial as it stabbed him right in the stomach. He Yun Sheng felt his throat was dry. After a moment, he finally opened his mouth. His voice shook with a determination to face death.He said, \u201cI\u2019m going to the court to turn myself in as I\u2019m the one who killed the man.\u201dHe stood up as if to move forward, but only after he took two steps, He Yan pulled him back. He staggered and almost fell down.He Yan asked, \u201cWhat crime are you going to pay for?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s dead. I\u2019ll pay for his death.\u201d He Yunsheng choked, \u201cIt\u2019s justified.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a price worth paying for such a man.\u201d He Yan glanced at Fan Cheng on the ground. \u201cI was thinking that even after today, Fan Cheng would not give up. Eventually, He family would get in trouble, but now there will be less trouble. He is dead \u2013 at least He family will be a lot more peaceful in the future. \u201d\u201cDo you still remember what he said at that time?\u201dHe Yun Sheng remembered that when Fan Cheng wanted to kill him at that time he said, \u201cAfter you die, I will enslave your sister and will use her for my entertainment every day. When I get tired of her, I will sell her to the brothel.\u201d He Yu Sheng took such words for granted.\u201cYou should know that Fan Cheng would have killed you and me on this ship today without having to pay the price. Why should you throw away your life if you killed him by mistake? Are our lives rubbish and only his is precious? Why? With what right?\u201dHe Yun Sheng was still young and passionate, but paying for the life of a man like Fan Cheng unworthy.\u201cI don\u2019t want to, either.\u201d He Yun Sheng said, his eyes filled with grief and indignation. \u201cBut there isn\u2019t any other place for us to go now.\u201dHe Yun Sheng\u2019s thoughts were simple \u2013 because he killed Fan Cheng, the Fan family would probably come to their door, and if he surrendered and paid for Fan Cheng\u2019s life with his life, it would all be over. But He Yan knew that this was impossible. She came from a prominent family in her previous life. Naturally, she knew that people like the Fan family would not give up even if He Yun Sheng surrendered his life. He Sui and her, including Qingmei and Shuang Qing \u2013\u00a0 none of them would be spared.\u201cCome here.\u201d He Yan patted him on the shoulder. He Yun Sheng looked at her in confusion.\u201cYou just said you swam here, that means you are good at swimming? Can you hold your breath? \u201d He Yan asked.He Yunsheng nodded, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou change into my clothes, and when you hear my message later, jump off the boat, swim downstream, then change into clean clothes and sneak back home, be sure to be quick, okay?\u201dHe Yun Sheng nodded foolishly, shook his head, and looked at He Yan, \u201cWhat about you?\u201dHe Yan picked up the bundle from the ground, and in the bundle, there were new clothes she had picked up today for He Yun Sheng from the tailor\u2019s shop. She said, \u201cI\u2019ll change my clothes and draw Fan Cheng\u2019s guards away.\u201dHe Yunsheng was startled and blurted out, \u201cNo!\u201cHow would you distract them? You are a woman. If they catch you, they will torture you and then kill you. You don\u2019t even have the strength to tie a chicken. If you fall in their hands, your life will be living hell\u2026 \u201cHe still babbled, but He Yan pressed his shoulders.She retorted, \u201cNo, I can get rid of them.\u201dUnder the dim light of the lamp, He Yan\u2019s eyes were clear and determined. She even smiled. The smile was very relaxing and somehow soothed He Yun Sheng\u2019s panicked mood, but also made him want to cry.\u201cI can\u2019t let you go.\u201d He Yun Sheng muttered.\u201cListen, Yun Sheng, you jump off the boat in my clothes. I\u2019ll lure them away. We won\u2019t be able to see each other these two days. I can\u2019t go back to the He house as I don\u2019t want to be discovered. In another five days, you go to a tavern called Liu Quan Ju which is in the city\u2019s west. There would be a row of willow trees at the door of the tavern. After finding them, search for the third willow tree from the left and dig down three inches. I will leave a letter for you there. We\u2019ll meet again then, okay? \u201cHe Yun Sheng shook his head, \u201cI can\u2019t let you go\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not a child anymore, you are a man, and you will have to shoulder the heavy burden of the He family in the future. You have to calm down and do as I say. I will be alright, as always,\u201d He Yan replied.He Yun Sheng was speechless and couldn\u2019t utter a word after he listened to He Yan\u2019s reply.It was indeed true, whether it was Wang Jiu Gui, whether it was gambling at the casino, or whether it was a horse race at the academy\u2019s field, every time she was unexpectedly fine, but this time it was different, this time it was the matter of a human life.\u201cOn the father\u2019s side, explain it for me.\u201d He Yan said, \u201cAfter a while, Fan Cheng\u2019s guards will come over, so we don\u2019t have much time. Now hurry up and change.\u201d She said, \u201cTurn your back, I\u2019ll give you my coat first.\u201dThe boat floated quietly in the river, and when He Yun Sheng and He Yan stood opposite to each other again, they changed into their new outfits. He Yan was dressed in brand new men\u2019s clothes, and her hair was tied up into a man\u2019s hair bun. She looked heroic like she really was an elegant young man. He Yun Sheng on the other hand was wearing He Yan\u2019s long skirt and didn\u2019t know where to put his hands and feet. He looked embarrassed.He Yan chuckled.\u201cYou\u2019re still in the mood to laugh in this dire situation?\u201d He Yun Sheng was so preoccupied and worried that he was not in the mood to quarrel with He Yan.\u201cIt\u2019s not the time to laugh yet.\u201d He Yan picked up a scarf from the ground and covered her face tightly, revealing only a pair of eyes. However, there was also a smile in her eyes, \u201cyou have to get used to this.\u201dGet used to what? Killing people and be on the run as a fugitive? He Yun Sheng felt tired, accompanied by deep worries and fears.\u201cOn the count of three, you jump down, okay?\u201d He Yan said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, we\u2019ll meet again.\u201dHe Yun Sheng was about to go to the bow of the boat.After taking two steps, he turned back, looked into He Yan\u2019s eyes, and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine right? Won\u2019t you?\u201dHe Yan rubbed his head, and the teenager\u2019s hair was cold and fluffy with the droplets he had just brought from the water.She smiled and answered softly, \u201cOf course.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sounds of waves slowly dissipated, and the night became exceptionally quiet.It was at this moment, that a woman\u2019s scream seemed to cut through this silence.\u201cKill, kill\u2026\u201dGathered in a few small groups, away from the shore, the guards sat together as they waited for Fan\u00a0Gong-zi\u2019s signal. When they first heard those miserable sounds, they were startled.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? It\u2019s been so long, why is she still making trouble?\u201d the head guard asked.\u201cThe young master didn\u2019t send a signal, so let\u2019s just wait.\u201d someone said.As Fan\u00a0Gong-zi\u2019s guards for so many years, the most important thing for them was to guess what was on their master\u2019s mind. This kind of thing was natural. Fan\u00a0Gong-zi\u00a0had been the young master of the Fan family for many years. In addition to the woman admiring him on their own, there were a lot of women from good families who had been ruined. Today\u2019s situation, it has happened more than once. After abducting those women on boats or some other outsider\u2019s house, Fan\u00a0Gong-zi\u00a0would insult them. Those women were poor and had nowhere to complain, so they could only forget it.Now, He Yan would also be one of them.Originally, Miss He Yan had a deep affection for Fan\u00a0Gong-zi, and there was no need to resort to such a method. But, who knew that after going off from the door of Fan\u2019s house, she would be so angry, that she really wanted to make a clean break with Fan\u00a0Gong-zi. And he was aroused because of her refusal and resorted to this. But, come to think of it, for people like He Yan only a tough approach works.What these guards had to do was just to bring He Yan to Fan\u00a0Gong-zi, and what happened afterwards was none of their business.\u201cI don\u2019t think it is right.\u201d The head guard stood up and looked in the direction of the boat. He saw that Fan\u00a0Gong-zi\u2018s boat shook violently in the river and it looked like someone had initiated a fight inside.\u201cNo, there is a problem!\u201d he shouted, \u201cGet up! Hurry up. In the past, things never went this far.\u201dWhen they heard the head guard, the rest of the people were startled and quickly boarded a small boat to head towards Fan\u00a0Gong-zi\u2018s boat. As they came closer, they saw a woman who stumbled out and looked panicked. That woman was wearing He Yan\u2019s clothes, seemingly hiding from someone. Then, she jumped down and fell into the river, all the while screaming.The river currents quickly swallowed her without any noise, just like a rock fallen in the river \u2013 only the sound of water splashing on the surface was heard. There was no more movement.\u201cThe young master!\u201d the head guard could not help calling out.No one cared if He Yan lived or died. As the boat came closer to Fan\u00a0Gong-zi\u2019s boat, the head guard climbed on their boat\u2019s bow and landed in Fan\u00a0Gong-zi\u2019s boat. In just a few steps, he entered the inner part of the boat and saw someone who stood there. The person\u2019s back faced him, and his face was covered with a scarf with only his eyes exposed and his features were blurred under the dim light of the moon. At his foot was Fan\u00a0Gong-zi\u2018s corpse lying in a pool of blood.That masked man was holding a dagger in his hand.The guard was so shocked when he saw this scene as he never expected to see such a person in the boat. Looking at Fan\u00a0Gong-zi\u00a0again, he was afraid that there would be more trouble in the future. A moment later, he regained his senses, furious and angry, and rushed towards the masked man without further thought, \u201cYou dare!\u201dThe masked man sneered and started to fight with the guard.The sound of swords could be heard from the boat, and the boat shook more violently. Soon, the remaining guards also came onto the boat. After the masked man saw the guards that charged over, he no longer wanted to fight and jumped into the river.\u201cCatch him!\u201d the head guard shouted, \u201cHe killed the young master!\u201dThe guards wanted to follow, but they soon found out that the masked man was very cunning. As all the guards were on Fan Gong Zi\u2019s boat, there was no one in the little boat. They thought that he had dived into the river, but they soon found out that he had got on the little boat that they came from.This was the center of the river. Although some people could swim in the river, it was night and was difficult to avoid dangers. But the little boat was light and thin and it flowed quickly along the river currents. As their boat was slightly heavier, so, even if they paddled it together, they were still half a step behind the masked man.One after another, in the drizzle, no one saw another person swimming in the river.As the boat came near the shore, the masked man threw the wooden paddle in his hands away, stood up and jumped onto the river bank and then quickly disappeared on the shore. The head guard said, \u201cLet two people go to look for the city guards, and the rest follow me to chase after him.\u201dAlthough it was the night time, it was not too late. There were hawkers doing business on both the sides of the road. Suddenly a masked man ran from the pier and he looked like he was in a rush. He was followed by a bunch of guards who looked murderous, which frightened the people on the road.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Why are they running after him?,\u201d A hawker whose stalk was knocked over didn\u2019t dare to say much, and just stooped down to pick up the scattered fruits on the ground.\u201cIt seems like a murder took place. Look at the person that they are chasing, he doesn\u2019t look like an ordinary person.\u201d\u201cA pity, it\u2019s not been peaceful these days.\u201d\u2026The water by the river shook. Suddenly a hand stretched out of the river. After the hand grabbed on a stone for support, a whole person came out of the water, bringing with him the scent of the water.He Yu Sheng\u2019s body trembled. He didn\u2019t dare to move carelessly. After he swam for a while, he finally came out. At this moment his face was pale and his lips were purple. He didn\u2019t know if he trembled because the river water was too cold or because he was scared.He held on to the basket in his hand tightly, inside were his new clothes that He Yan had brought back from the tailor shop and some snacks he had found on the boat. He Yan covered the basket very well, so the clothes inside were clean and not wet. He Yun Sheng took off the woman\u2019s clothes that he was wearing, bundled them up and threw them into the basket. Then, he tied a few stones to the basket and flung the basket to the river.The river water engulfed the basket in an instant.He then put on the new spring shirt, which was almost the same colour of his hair. It also happened to hide his wet hair. The clothes were well-fitted and the style was also very beautiful. After he wore his clothes, he realised that his throat was choked up.However, there was no extra time for him to dilly-dally here. He Yan\u2019s words still rung in his ears.\u201cYou have to change into clean clothes and go home \u2013 you must be quick.\u201dMust be quick.He staggered as he attempted to stand up, but still managed to hurry away in the direction of his home.There seemed to be a city garrison in the city who searched for someone everywhere. As He Yun Sheng walked, he heard someone talking on the street.\u201cI heard that someone on a boat in the river has suffered a brutal death.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, it must be some young master of a big family. Didn\u2019t you see the city guards looking for the culprit everywhere?\u201d\u201cWith so many people, the murderer will definitely not be able to escape. Maybe he is already caught by them. Oops\u2026this rain is heavy and my clothes are also all wet.\u201dThe sound of the talk gradually faded away, until it was no longer heard.Hurry up, hurry up.A young man in a blue shirt walked along the street. His spring shirt was very thin, and on this rainy day, he probably felt very cold. He tightened the clothes around his body and quickly walked home.The rain was getting heavier and heavier, and the pedestrians walking on the street without umbrellas, hurried to avoid the rain. The hawkers hid under the eaves and shouted loudly at the pedestrians who passed by and took a look. At a glance, there seemed to be no difference between this night and the last one.\u201cSister\u2026\u201d Someone whispered to himself, like the wind of a spring night,\u00a0 which fell in the drizzle without a trace.The teenager walked forward with his head lowered, without looking back, as his tears kept falling down.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Chase him!\u201d The leader of the guards pointed to a direction and instructed the approaching unit of guards.The guards were fully equipped and had numerous horses so they started to chase the person in the direction he pointed to. Fan Cheng\u2019s other guards looked at the leader, and someone asked in a trembling voice, \u201cWhat should we do if the young master is dead?\u201dAs Fan Cheng\u2019s bodyguard, they failed to protect him well. The Fan family would definitely hold them accountable, and subject them to punishments ranging from light to heavy. If they were mad, they might lose their lives, too.\u201cWho on earth killed the Young Master?\u201d Someone asked.\u201cI\u2019ve fought that man, and he has good skills,\u201d the leader clenched his fist, \u201cI\u2019m no match for him.\u201d\u201cWas he here for the young master? God, who the hell he is?\u201dWho knows? Fan Cheng had done many evil deeds. Since the man wanted Fan Cheng\u2019s life, he obviously had hated him for a long time. The girls who were abused by Fan Cheng also had parents and brothers. Maybe he took revenge for his relatives or a lover. The man was dead and everything would come to light once the murderer was caught.\u201cMiss He\u2026,\u201d Someone finally remembered He Yan.\u201cShe\u2019s dead.\u201dIf a person with no strength falls in such a deep and cold river, it would be fatal. So what? No one cared. If He Yan was alive, maybe she would be targeted by the Fan family. It was still better to die. At least the business of the He family would end here.\u201cIf you die, you die.\u201d The leader said nonchalantly, \u201cIt\u2019s better to be dead.\u201dIn a word, He Yan\u2019s life was already doomed.\u2026\u2026.The sound of horses\u2019 hoofs resounded in the depths of the street, and the people in the city were in a panic.There was a young man, dressed in green, who walked quietly through the shattered temple where the beggars lived in a group and threw his wet old clothes into the abandoned well.Her clothes had already been changed during the escape, she wore her spring tunics inside so all she had to do was throw off the clothes she wore on the outside. There was no need to wear a turban, so as not to attract attention. She touched the wall and got a layer of dust on her hands. She patted and smeared the black and gray dust and soot on her face. Her face\u00a0 which was white and clean, immediately turned black, giving her an appearance like\u2026 A teenager from an ordinary family who often worked outside.But she still looked like a handsome teenage boy.She walked forward without panic, as the city guards behind her arrested people everywhere, but He Yan\u2019s heart was not as calm as it appeared.Fan Cheng\u2019s guards had fought with her. If they were being careful, they would recognize her. Appearances could be disguised, but size could not be deceived. The guards of the capital city were not trash eaters, and it was not easy to hide from them either. Moreover, if they interrogated the beggars at the temple, they would find out that they had seen a stranger. The gates of this city must have been sealed off by now, and until the next month, the city would be strictly investigated. If they searched people one by one, she would be discovered sooner or later.It was a headache.The Fan family was even more prosperous than she had imagined, and they called so many people to chase after her alone. He Yan didn\u2019t want to give up her life in vain.Units of guards were closing in from every direction, and He Yan was in a precarious position.Suddenly, she remembered something and stretched out her hand to pull out something from her sleeve.The paper was crumpled and drenched in the rain.\u00a0 It was almost impossible to make out the words written on it. This was the conscription notice that He Yun Sheng had torn off the wall that day.Conscription document.The recruitment office was in an open field outside the stables at the west of the city, where tents were set up, and many people filled out paperwork, underwent a simple inspection, and set off together when the time came. The recruitment of soldiers in Liang Zhou had always been in a rush, and she was sure that it would not be strict because even if the person was underage, it wouldn\u2019t matter. People weren\u2019t willing to go unless their family was extremely poor, otherwise, who does not like to live in peace and prosperity? There was no one who would be willing to suffer for nothing.But this recruitment notice came exactly at the right time.Now that she had become a wanted criminal, staying in the capital would do no good to her, and if she was found out, it would be even worse if the He Family got implicated because of her. Besides, it was of no use to stay in the capital. The He family was too far away from her, and the Xu family was even more of a high gate that she couldn\u2019t reach, so she had to stand at the same level as them to claim what she wanted.It was better to go to the barracks. She could go out of the city with the recruited team. At least there would be a place where she could stay.There were no other options, and she had her own arrangements too. She was thinking about how to find a reasonable reason to explain to the He family about her departure, but now she didn\u2019t have to think of any other reason, because this was the only way left for her. The draft would close tomorrow and it was the night before the deadline, so she was right on time.He Yan smiled and felt relaxed so she no longer hesitated and walked towards the direction of the west barracks.The west barrack was originally a horse farm, but horses had been evacuated since the draft tent was set up there. In front of the long tent, a red-faced man sat with a long knife at his waist. Because of the rain, he was wearing a felt hat on his head, and his eyes were like copper bells. He looked neither grumpy nor pretentious and dozed off without a hitch.Since recruitment was almost over, as soon as the next day passed, the new recruits would go to Liang Zhou with them. At this time, those who were willing to go would have already come to cast their names, and there should be no new recruits at this time.When He Yan walked forward, the big man didn\u2019t even lift his eyelids, so He Yan had no choice but to say, \u201cThis big brother, is recruitment over?\u201dThe big man sized her up and said slowly, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d He Yan smiled with delight and said, \u201cI want to join the army.\u201d\u201cYou?\u201d The red-faced man gave a sarcastic smile and said, \u201cBrother, how old are you this year?\u201d\u201cSixteen.\u201d\u201cSixteen,\u201d the man pondered for a while and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t look like sixteen with this body. You haven\u2019t done any heavy work at home on weekdays, right? Joining the army is no joke, if you\u2019re making a joke, go back before it\u2019s too late, don\u2019t waste my time.\u201d\u201cBig Brother, I really want to join the army.\u201d He Yan thought about the brothers who came out of the barracks and imitated their mournful expression. \u201cThere is no one at home. I can\u2019t live. If I don\u2019t join the army, I would have to sell myself as a servant. It would be better to go to war, either die on the battlefield or do some meritorious service. I could live differently. Besides, Big Brother,\u201d she leaned closer and whispered,\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m afraid there are not enough men, so it\u2019s better to have one more than one less, so we could make up a whole number.\u201dThe big man was moved by what she said. He just wanted to get people together and finish his work as soon as possible so he said, \u201cAll right, if you want to die, I won\u2019t stop you. The barracks are just right in front of you, it\u2019s not a place for pleasure, and if you can\u2019t make it and want to be a deserter, you\u2019ll be punished by military laws.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t be a deserter.\u201d He Yan vowed.The red-faced man sneered. He had seen many such teenagers, and they were all confident when they came but when the time came to battle, they were the ones who peed their pants in fear.\u201cThen you fill out this form.\u201d He handed the paper to He Yan.Meanwhile, on the outskirts of the barracks in the city\u2019s west, the garrison of the guards turned their horses around when they reached there as in front of them was the tent for recruitment in Liang Zhou and there was no need to rush in there.He Yan wrote two words sloppily. This time, she used her own name.He Yan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The red-faced man glanced at it and asked, \u201cYou can read?\u201d\u201cOnly a little,\u201d He Yan answered modestly.The majority of the men enlisting in the army were young and hard-working, but few were literate. The red-faced man\u2019s expression seemed to soften a little as he said, \u201cHead over to the tent in the back. They\u2019ll administer you a simple examination. Upon passing, sign the document, and you\u2019ll be officially registered.\u201dHe Yan expressed her gratitude and left.The tent was located near the racecourse, standing out amongst the others for its sheer size and grandeur. He Yan lifted the curtain, only to see a shirtless man sitting atop a horse and a physician standing nearby. The shirtless man grinned and asked the other, \u201cCome on, aren\u2019t I so buff?\u201dHe Yan pretended to not see him. However, the self-proclaimed buff man had caught sight of her. With a surprised expression on his face, he scoffed, \u201cAre people this frail and weak even allowed to enlist in the army?\u201dThe physician then urged him to leave, saying \u201cThrow on your clothing and get out. I don\u2019t have all day.\u201dThe stout man cursed under his breath as he left, occasionally stopping to glance back at He Yan with a puzzled expression.\u201cStand here\u2026\u201d The physician interrupted, \u201cAnd undress yourself.\u201dHe Yan didn\u2019t reply.He Yan knew beforehand that enlisting in the army meant undergoing a physical examination to confirm she wasn\u2019t crippled or bore an infectious disease. If she hadn\u2019t known that, her secret might\u2019ve been revealed. However, she was prepared, after undergoing a similar experience when joining the Yue army in his past life.He Yan took the physician\u2019s hand in her own, and deposited a single silver coin.He looked down at the coin and then back up at her, frowning. \u201cThis\u2026\u201d\u201cPhysician, I had no intention of hiding this from you, but I contracted a disease when I was younger.\u201d He Yan looked down, ashamed. \u201cBecause of the defects that remain, I was never welcome and was bullied my entire life. I couldn\u2019t stand it, so I decided to enlist in the army. I\u2019m begging you, please help me. If I die on the battlefield, I\u2019ll surely remember your kindness and repay you in my next life.\u201dThe physician had expected him to blabber on about some contagious disease, but didn\u2019t expect it to be some type of defect. He stared at He Yan with pity and sympathy. It was the first time he had encountered such a situation, and with such a handsome young man.After weighing the silver coin in his hand and squeezing it several times, he looked back up at He Yan. He Yan looked perfectly healthy, with no sign of a disease. \u201cIn that case, you can leave. Pay attention to your surroundings, and don\u2019t let it be seen by others. If you\u2019re found out, don\u2019t blame it on me.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201d He Yan replied whilst shedding a few tears out of graciosity for the physician.He Yan let out a sigh of relief, after seeing how smoothly the examination went. She stepped outside onto the grass, and was met with the same stout man from before, stuffing his mouth with biscuits. When he saw He Yan standing there, staring at the food, he beckoned her over as if to say hello.He Yan thought about it for a moment, but ultimately decided to walk over to him.\u201cLittle brother, I saw you in there just now.\u201d The stout man paused and attempted to wipe off the sesame seeds that were around his mouth, but failed. \u201cAre you here to enlist in the army?\u201dHe Yan nodded while staring at the remaining biscuits in his hand, feeling the hunger start to set in. She hadn\u2019t eaten anything this entire afternoon, and she could hear her stomach begin to rumble.\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d The stout man asked, seeing her stare at the food in his hand. \u201cHere, take this! I\u2019ve already eaten five, so I\u2019m full.\u201dHe Yan was famished, so she decided to accept the offer. She stepped closer to the stout man, took the biscuit from his hand, and began to eat.\u201cYou look so thin and frail, and yet you\u2019re still enlisting in the army? How could your family be at ease?\u201d The man muttered under his breath, \u201cEven my 10-year old brother looks stronger than you.\u201dHe Yan gulped down the biscuits and replied, \u201cAppearances can be deceiving. I may look weak, but in actuality, I\u2019m strong. I\u2019ll be sixteen this year.\u201d\u201cHow did you come to join the army?\u201d The stout man asked curiously, \u201cYou look like you have an education.\u201dHe Yan replied straightforwardly, \u201cMy family\u2019s been in decline, and there\u2019s no way out.\u201dThe stout man understood He Yan. With sympathy, he remarked, \u201cLittle brother, things will change for the better, so you need not pay attention to it. If you follow me, I will be sure to protect you.\u201d\u201cThank you, big brother.\u201dAfter hearing the words, \u201cbig brother,\u201d he was pleased. \u201cMy surname is Hong, my full name being Hong Shan. Just call me Brother Shan. What\u2019s your name, little brother?\u201d\u201cMy surname is He, He Yan. The He as in firewood.\u201d\u201cHe? That\u2019s one rare surname. I\u2019ll call you Ah He from now on.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d He Yan nodded. She had finished eating the biscuits, and after wiping her mouth, she ventured out to look for a stable. Upon finding one, she plopped down against the railing, content.Hong Shan watched her, perplexed, and asked, \u201cAh He, are you not heading home?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not heading back.\u201d He Yan replied, whilst propping her head up with her hands. \u201cI\u2019m staying here.\u201dThe sympathy in Hong Shan\u2019s eyes became even more evident. He sat down next to He Yan and said, \u201cI\u2019m staying here as well. Let\u2019s make do tonight, and set off tomorrow.\u201d\u201cIt couldn\u2019t get better than this.\u201dIn the distance, a torch was ignited outside the camp. It flickered violently underneath the rain, as if it was going to be extinguished the next moment. They sat quietly in the darkness together, with a lot on their mind.He Yan didn\u2019t know how He Yun Sheng was doing, if he got home safely, or if he was stranded. He Yan worried about it, until she unconsciously fell asleep.\u2013Countless unpleasant things happen in Jing Cheng everyday, and yet nobody pays any attention to the affairs of the poor. However, if something happened to a high-ranking family, it would be known to all.Last night, there was a homicide case on the river. The young master of the Fan family was brutally murdered in a boat. The assailant escaped, leaving no trace or evidence. At the same time, the daughter of a drill officer was also aboard the ship. She was murdered as well, being thrown in the river without a corpse remaining.The murderer hadn\u2019t been caught, leaving the citizens living in the city in chaos and panic for quite a while. However, many citizens applauded the deed, as the young master of the Fan family was known for ruining and abusing girls from common families. He abused his family\u2019s power, causing the girls to shy away from making a public statement. Perhaps, the heavens have finally enforced justice upon the guilty.The He family was miserable.He Sui seemed to age 10 years overnight, sitting still in the hall everyday like a clay sculpture. Qing Mei hid in the yard, and Shuang Qing wore a bitter expression every day. Qing Mei had wiped her tears and lamented, \u201cHow could she suddenly disappear\u2026\u201dHe Yun Sheng had spent all his time sitting in the stables next to Xiang Xiang.The hay bales had started to spoil, but He Yun Sheng paid no attention to it. The horse was also fidgety, but He Yun Sheng was not affected by it at all.The lack of news on He Yan was better than unfortunate news. He Yan hadn\u2019t been caught. He thought of the ship, where the night rain and sweet smelling-fragrance covered up the scent of blood.He had been afraid and helpless. Every time, the girl in the beautiful, long dress with the dreamy eyes would pat him on the head and say, \u201cIt\u2019ll be alright. Like always, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u201cThis time, I hope \u2013 no, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s alright.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The new recruits who had bid farewell to their families had already assembled, waited for the night to pass, and set off for Liangzhou early the next morning.The tents were so small that a few people could barely squeeze into them. He Yan and Hong Shan were sitting next to each other.\u00a0 Since neither of them had much luggage, it was quite spacious to sit up. From last night to tonight, He Yan was here for an entire day.There would be steamed buns to eat here, two for a meal, and they could get more after they settled down in Liang Zhou. The rest was not much of a problem, but it was inconvenient to go to the toilet, so He Yan would have to wait until late at night when no one goes there.She just got out of the toilet, walked to her tent, and when she lifted the tent, there were two people inside. Hong Shan talked to them. As they heard movement outside, the two men looked back.They were probably a pair of brothers, somewhat similar in appearance, thin, and looked very handsome. They looked rather young. The older one looked about sixteen or seventeen years old, and the younger one looked almost as old as He Yun Sheng. He Yan made a guess that the older looking one must be the older brother and the smaller one who looked as young as Yun Sheng must be the smaller brother.The younger one when he saw He Yan showed a smile and asked with a familiar tone, \u201cThis brother is\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is your brother Ah He,\u201d Hong Shan helped He Yan, and said to He Yan, \u201cThese are the two new brothers today, there are no more accommodations out there, so they are here to squeeze in with us.\u201d He pointed to the young man who was quiet, \u201cthis is Shi\u201d and then he pointed to the other young man who had a simple and innocent smile, \u201cThis is Mak.\u201dShi and Mak were probably a pair of brothers from a poor family, otherwise a better family would have given their children a better name.He Yan found a place to sit down. As there were over two people, the tent suddenly appeared to be a little crowded.\u201cAre you guys from the capital?\u201d After she asked, He Yan felt a little thirsty, so she unscrewed the water bottle at her waist and took a sip.Shi was not talkative, but his younger brother, Mak, was very lively. He said, \u201cWe lived on Xiang Huai mountain. We usually lived by hunting. When we went down the mountain last time, I saw a recruitment draft, so I discussed it with my brother and came to join the army.\u201dThey used to be a hunter\u2019s family on the mountain.\u201cPerhaps your parents have also come to join the army?\u201d Hong Shan asked. Generally speaking, even if the family is poor and came to join the army, they won\u2019t let their two sons come and join together \u2013 they would always leave a way out for the family.\u201cOur parents are long gone. I grew up with my brother.\u201dHong Shan sighed, \u201cThen you should all the more cherish your lives, it\u2019s no fun to come and join the army. You guys aren\u2019t\u2026\u201d he glanced at He Yan\u2019s direction, \u201cDo you guys also want to do meritorious service like him, right?\u201d\u201cA man should make a great contribution,\u201d said Mak naively. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, the commander of the right army, Commander Xiao, is going to command the troops leading to Liang Zhou. My brother and I have admired him for a long time. It\u2019s our honor to work with him!\u201dHe Yan was listening to them as she drank water, and with a \u201cpuff\u201d water gushed out of her mouth and she almost choked herself when she heard their words.\u201cWho did you say went to Liang Zhou to be the commander?\u201d She asked.Mak thought she didn\u2019t know \u201cGovernor Xiao\u201d and so he deliberately explained, \u201cIt\u2019s the present-day General Feng Yun, the Xiao family\u2019s second son, Xiao Huaijin.\u201dHe Yan\u2019s heart trembled.How could Xiao Jue be a commander in Liang zhou? There was no need for him to be in this position. Besides, he had his own army. Why should he take new soldiers to Liang Zhou\u2026 unless he was demoted.Xiao Jue was demoted?\u2026\u2026The Xiao family in Beijing.Xiao\u2019s house was specially renovated according to his wife\u2019s preference when General Xiao was alive. The Xiao family did not touch the layout of the courtyard in later generations, so although it was a generals\u2019 family, the courtyard was as elegant and chic as a normal courtyard which could be seen in the city of Suzhou.Through the flower wall was the main room, next to the main room was a pomegranate tree (the time hadn\u2019t come for it to bear fruits), through the window, you could see a yellow pine wood shelf full of books and someone was sitting at the table reading.The young man was born fair and beautiful, but indifferent, with a bit of laziness and fatigue. In his own house, he was dressed casually, and his cloud pattern brocade and blue jade belt made him look more and more heroic. There was a sword that hung on the wall, its color akin to frost and snow. Although it was inside the scabbard, still it looked majestic.The door pushed open and someone came in.The two people who came in were a man and a woman. The man showed a sevenfold resemblance to Xiao Jue but was not as cold as Xiao Jue. He had more gentle and clear air to him. His name was Xiao Jing, the elder brother of Xia Jue. Xiao Jing was followed by his wife, Bai Rong Wei. Although she was not a stunning woman, she was still beautiful and dignified.The couple stood together, looking beautiful and pleasing to the eye.\u201cHuaijin,\u201d it was Bai Rong Wei who opened her mouth. She put the parcel which was in Xiao Jing\u2019s hand on the table and said, \u201cThese are the shoes and clothes we have prepared for your trip to Liangzhou, try them on later.\u201dSince the death of General Xiao and his wife, there have been only two brothers left in the Xiao family, Xiao Jing and Xiao Jue, and his elder sister-in-law was like his mother. In the past, the general\u2019s wife used to mend clothes for Xiao Jue, but now it was Bai Rong Wei.\u201cThank you, sister-in-law.\u201d Xiao Jue nodded his head.Bai Rong Wei smiled and said, \u201cYou brothers talk, I\u2019ll go see if the soup is ready.\u201d After she said this, she retreated.After Bai Rong Wei left, Xiao Jing looked at Xiao Jue for a moment. Finally, he sighed and said, \u201cHuaijin, you really need not go to Liangzhou.\u201d\u201cXu Jiefu has been targeting you frequently in the court and is looking for trouble with the Xiao family.\u201d Xiao Jue looked unperturbed and only said, \u201cThe emperor listens to Xu Jiefu\u2019s words, so I\u2019m only causing trouble by staying in the capital. It\u2019s good to go to Liang Zhou for a while to avoid the front. Besides, father\u2019s death back then was full of suspicions, and this time, maybe I can find a clue and I might make a new discovery.\u201dWhen they talked about General Xiao\u2019s death, the atmosphere in the room became dull.After a long silence, Xiao Jing reached out and patted Xiao Jue on the shoulder, \u201cYou always think more than I do, but I can\u2019t do anything for you.\u201d\u201cElder brother\u2019s situation in Chao Zhong is more complicated. When I\u2019m away, the Xiao family will rely on the elder brother.\u201d Xiao Jue laughed, looked at Xiao Jing, and said, \u201cTake care, elder brother.\u201d\u201cYou take care of yourself, too.\u201d Xiao Jing felt a lot of emotions, perhaps to lighten the bitter atmosphere, he deliberately joked, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want you to go to Liang Zhou, it\u2019s just that you\u2019re now at your prime, and it\u2019s time for you to settle down. Now that you\u2019re old enough, it\u2019s time for you to get married. Do you have any girl you like or do you want your sister-in-law to look for you?\u201dWhen Xiao Jue heard the words, his smile disappeared, and his expression became more and more plain and finally became indifferent.\u201cNo need, I don\u2019t intend to take a wife.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With the arrival of summer came the endless rain, quenching the soil and transforming the city into a misty wonderland.It was the calm before the storm.The capital city seemed to be void of it\u2019s usual bustling, but the court was anything but that. Xiao Huaijin, the chief commander of the army, had been invited to lead the new recruits to Liang Zhou. However, Immediately after Xiao Huaijin\u2019s leaving, the situation in the court had changed once again. The crown prince tried to keep it hidden, but it was quite evident he was both proud and self-satisfied.The affairs occuring in the court were mainly irrelevant to the common folk, so there were little to no changes in their lives. It had been a few days, but the assailant of the Fan family\u2019s young master still hadn\u2019t been found. The Fan family had tried everything, but it was to no avail. Helpless and desperate, they could only turn to his wife. However, her family\u2019s decisions were truly unexpected. After the young master\u2019s death, the head of the Tang family had forced the head of the Fan family to annul their marriage, allowing him to bring back their daughter. He would never allow his own precious daughter, Tang Ying, to be widowed at such a young age. She was still in her prime, and had a future ahead of her.Meanwhile, He Yan had become irrelevant, a supporting role in the accident. Her body was also nowhere to be found, but it was of little importance compared to Fan\u00a0gonzi\u2019s\u00a0missing body. It was like she had never existed in the world, her family the only ones remembering her.The light drizzle had become a downpour, obscuring He Yun Shen\u2019s vision, and leaving him with no choice but to go out wearing his bamboo-rain-hat. After He Yan\u2019s \u2018accident\u2019, he stopped attending classes at the institute, opting to stay home instead for five days. Today was the tenth day since he sent the letter regarding his leave. He was afraid that the Fan family would use some underhanded tricks on him, but he couldn\u2019t bear to ruin the opportunity He Yan had won for him.These days, he had been keeping himself busy by investigating his home, making sure there weren\u2019t any guards monitoring him. He would only be at ease once he was sure.He Yun Sheng hastily changed into his old clothes, as he didn\u2019t want to attract attention to himself. He lowered his head, left through the back door, and went into the heavy rain.During these past ten days, He Yun Sheng was living a life worse than death. He was unable to fall asleep, his body yearning to rest but his mind thinking otherwise. He wanted to hear about He Yan, but he was also afraid. There was no news about He Yan being captured and taken away by the government, so he assumed she was safe.Nevertheless, he was curious as to where she went. If He Yan wasn\u2019t in the capital city, where was she? Apart from the people in relation to the He family, she had no friends. She was bound to wander about aimlessly. He didn\u2019t know if she had been sleeping well, or eating well. Has she been bullied? Thinking of this, He Yun Sheng\u2019s footsteps became faster.Liu Quan Ju acquired its name from the spring at the back and the row of willow trees beside it. There were few people in the tavern on this rainy day, so nobody paid much attention to He Yun Shen when he entered.He still remembered what He Yan had said.\u201cIf you ever find yourself at a tavern named Liu Quan Ju, look for the letter I left. There is a row of willow trees near the back. Dig down three inches under the third willow tree from the left.\u201dHe Yun Sheng crouched down.Dig down three inches down the third willow tree from the left.The upturned soil was wet from the rain. He continued to dig, until his fingers were met with something hard. He Yun Sheng\u2019s heart skipped a beat, and after a moment, a package was uncovered. Instead of opening it on the spot, he filled the hole he dug in with soil, and left with the package held in his arms.After exiting the tavern, he started to break into a run. When he arrived, he noticed He Sui wasn\u2019t there. Therefore, He Yun Sheng returned to his room, locked the door, and placed the package on his lap.He had kept it in his arms the whole time, so it wasn\u2019t wet from the rain. He Yun Sheng opened the package, and took a look at what was inside.Inside, there was clothing and a letter.He Yun Sheng decided to unfold the letter first. It was likely written in a hurry, as the paper wasn\u2019t one for writing, but for packing food. One side of the paper was patterned, and both were full of creases and oil stains. On the other side without patterns, there were a few beautiful characters written in exquisite handwriting.\u201cI\u2019ve enlisted in the army. I\u2019ve departed for Liangzhou, where the mountains are towering and the rivers are broad. After the chilly spring and the scorching summer, we will surely meet again. Take care of yourself.\u201dHe Yun Sheng gaped at what was written, but after a while, he understood, clenching his teeth and grabbing the clothing.The clothing was the one she had custom-made at the old tailor\u2019s shop. When He Yan and he had parted that day, they each wore the clothing to disguise themselves. This one had been neatly folded and sent back.The material felt cold to the touch, reminding him of the girl\u2019s cold smile and soothing words that day.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll meet again.\u201dA hush fell over him.However, the silence was soon interrupted by He Yun Sheng\u2019s loud, desperate sobs.\u201cLiar\u2026\u201dHe Yan, who had just been called a liar, didn\u2019t know she was being scolded behind her back.She had been busy on the road to Liang Zhou. This time, there were only around 20000 soldiers, but there were more on the way.By noon, the soldiers were all sweating profusely. The sweltering summer heat had made it difficult to travel, forcing them to leave camp at the crack of dawn.Hong Shan plopped down on the grass, picked up a tree leaf, and fanned himself with it. While gnawing at the dry rationed food, he asked, \u201cDamn, it\u2019s way too hot. When will we arrive?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll take a little over two months to get to Liang Zhou.\u201d He Yan poured water from the flask into her mouth, \u201ctake your time.\u201d\u201cI miss the mung bean soup in Beijing,\u201d Xiao Mai said while smacking his lips. \u201cIt was served in a bowl and soaked in the well for several hours. It\u2019s sweet and cool, ah, so refreshing!\u201dHe described it so delectably and in detail that everyone who was listening started to drool.\u201cCut it out. Since you\u2019re in the army now, you shouldn\u2019t be going on about some mung bean soup. You should be grateful you\u2019re not starving.\u201d Hong Shan sighed. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll be able to taste some if we get promoted and obtain a reward, just like General Xiao.\u201dHe Yan had lots to say about Xiao Jue.She had joined the army and followed them to Liang Zhou in her past life, traveling day and night with little to no rest. He Yan stayed in a separate tent at night, never having an encounter with Xiao Jue. He and his men were always leading upfront, but they also lived and rested in tents separated from the soldiers. From her time in Xiangchang institute, she knew Xiao Jue was an extremely particular and picky person. The second son of the Xiao family was born with a golden spoon in his mouth, resulting in him eating and dressing to his heart\u2019s content.Even if he was traveling with the rest of the soldiers, his life as a general was still much more comfortable and lavish than theirs. They were all young generals, yet they were all so different from each other.She had become a soldier under him once again. He Yan sighed. After all, who would believe her crazy story? Her only goal was to earn military achievements and get promoted quickly, but Xiao Jue was the pickiest General out of all of them. He made it difficult to be a soldier, much less get promoted.Even if she wanted to drop out, where would she go? She had already enlisted, so her only option was to wait and see.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

By the time they could reach Liang Zhou, everyone would be exhausted and much thinner. He Yan looked at her reflection in the water while she was sitting by the lake and scooping water. The real He Yan had fair skin, but after two months of exposure, she didn\u2019t even need to wipe the dust on her face. Her skin tanned to wheat shade.If the real He Yan came back at that time, she would strangle herself. Such a weird idea tickled He Yan, making her laugh.\u201cAh~ Brother He, why are you laughing so happily?\u201d Asked Mak.Hong Shan glanced at He Yan by the lake and said clearly, \u201cIf we walk for another half a day, we will be in Liang Zhou before dark. Can we not be happy that the hard days are finally\u00a0ending?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Mak thought intensely and addressed Shi, \u201cBig brother, are you happy?\u201dThe quiet Shi nodded his head.The journey of these two months was not an affair indulged in by ordinary humans. Even though most of the people who came to join the army came from a humble background, it was much more challenging than they had thought. Some people who were not in good health had lost their lives during the journey before they could even reach Liang Zhou. And now they could never go back to the capital again.It was a road, from which there was no turning back.In the evening, the army finally arrived in Liang Zhou. Liang Zhou was in the northwest of the country. They thought it would be desolate and barren. However, when they arrived, they found it to be prosperous. Although it could not be compared with the capital city, it was also lively and lush. He Yan walked along with everyone, thinking that Xiao Jue knew how to pick a place. Liang Zhou was much better than the desert county where she had first joined the army. When she first went to the Mo Xian prefecture, it was barren, and the people couldn\u2019t even afford to eat, and the lives of their soldiers were tough.After arriving at Liang Zhou, He Yan first had to go to Liang Zhou Guard, who was stationed at the foot of Bai Yue Mountain, where there was a large open area that was big enough to be used as an arsenal. It was the place where the soldiers practised on weekdays. They were staying in tents at night, but now they would be all staying in the Liang Zhou Guard\u2019s guardhouse.There were so many people, but the guardhouse didn\u2019t have so many rooms, so only a dozen or so people could squeeze into a small hut and sleep in large communal beds. Naturally, He Yan was still with Hong Shan and the two brothers Mak and Shin. The few of them didn\u2019t have any luggage, so they relaxed after finding a place to sleep in a shared bunk.\u201cI see there is a river near here,\u201d Mak said excitedly. \u201cMany people are bathing in the river. Let\u2019s go too.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m already sweating from the heat!\u201d Hong Shan removed his coat in a couple of moves and was about to run outside.Mak looked at He Yan and said, \u201cBrother He is not going?\u201d\u201cHe won\u2019t go, he\u2019s afraid of the water, we three will do!\u201d Hong Shan shoved Mak and Shi out.He Yan had explained, the first time Hong Shan invited her to take a bath in the river, saying that she had drowned when she was a child, and from then on she would feel dizzy and shortness of breath as long as she went into the water. Hong Shan was not suspicious of her, and honestly, He Yan was not lying, she was terrified of the water now.Meanwhile, as soon as He Yan lied down on the big bunk bed, it made a \u201ccreak\u201dsound. She could not help but frown. For a moment, she didn\u2019t know whether it was because she was too thin or because the bed was so hard that it was excruciating. After a moment, she sighed in her heart, thinking, \u2018It is easy to move from thrift to extravagance, but it is difficult to move from extravagance to frugality.\u2019 After living in the barracks for three years and being a Miss for only one year, she became accustomed to the soft bedding and found the bed very irritating.The conditions must be suitable for Xiao Jue. His bed must be soft. She thought it was unfair.After two months of eating dry food and water on the road, it was on\u00a0 the first day after reaching Liang Zhou, when they had a proper hot meal. Even simple steamed buns with plain porridge were steaming hot, and the recruits were sitting on the ground eating, not knowing the names of the delicacies they were gobbling down.\u201cThis bun\u2019s meat filling is so not much .\u201d Hong Shan complained as he licked his fingers, \u201cThis is not enough.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good enough to have a hot meal.\u201d He Yan spoke up, \u201cIt\u2019s better than dry food.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I just inquired that there are many wild animals and rabbits on the Bai Yue mountain,\u201d Mak said with a smile. \u201cMy brother and I can go hunting. We can hunt rabbits and boars. After that, we can clean them, string them on the branches, or wrap them in a leaf with some salt and roast them. It tastes very delicious.\u201dMak was a foodie. After listening to Mak, Hong Shan was getting hungrier and hungrier. He swiftly drank the porridge in front of him and laid it heavily on the table. \u201cDamn, I can\u2019t wait to go up the mountain now.\u201d\u201cThe military order has the rule that you are not allowed to go up the mountain privately.\u201d He Yan splashed the cold water on their beautiful imaginations.\u201cThere must be a time to go up to the mountain.\u201d Hong Shan was unconvinced.After eating and drinking their fill, everyone cleaned up, and the practice commander in charge of the military training told them in advance that they would gather at the arena at dawn tomorrow morning and would rest early that day.He Yan returned to the guardroom with Hong Shan. The room was already full of people, some of whom had already slept, some were still gossiping, unable to stop their excitement.He Yan was sleeping in the innermost part of the bunk bed, sandwiched between Mak and the wall. Hong Shan spoke happily at the other end, \u201cCompared to the past few days, today is simply the best.\u201dThere was food, drink, bath and bed to sleep. We didn\u2019t have to go out in the sun and rain and didn\u2019t even have to be bothered by mosquitoes to sleep at night. It was so much better than before.Mak whispered, \u201cI think it\u2019s easier to train here than to hunt in the mountains. And there are so many people to play with.\u201dHe Yan, \u201c\u2026\u201dSilly boy, how could anyone conclude that the military training is easier than hunting in the capital? These people were all joining the army for the first time, and in the future, it would not be as easy as it was now. Having this meal was like a prisoner having a meal on the road before the execution, it would be a good meal, but also the last one too.Tonight would be the most relaxing night they\u2019d ever spent in Liang Zhou, and the real torture would commence the next day.He Yan closed her eyes and let these silly children indulge in their sweet dreams for a while.Sure enough, the next morning, before dawn, the sound of horns came from the open space outside the guardhouse.\u201cWell, it\u2019s so early, can\u2019t we sleep a little longer?\u201d Mak rolled over and rubbed his eyes. He found that He Yan was already dressed and standing in front of the bed.\u201cBrother He, why are you up so early?\u201d He asked in a daze.\u201cThere will be a roll call at this hour if we don\u2019t reach in time, it\u2019d be considered a breach of military laws which will result in getting spanked by batons.\u201d She said with a smile, her expression very fresh, looking like she wasn\u2019t sleepy at all.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to get punished, get up quickly.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Last night, when they had arrived at Liang Zhou, everyone was excited and inevitably rested a little late. They were all sleepy when they arrived at the arena, and some of them had their shoes on backward.Shi was fine, but Mak and Hong Shan tied their belts as they walked. When they saw that He Yan was in high spirits and very energetic, both of them were confused and asked, \u201cBrother He, aren\u2019t you sleepy?\u201d\u201cI rested early last night and slept well.\u201d\u00a0 He Yan replied.Mak praised, \u201cYou\u2019re amazing!\u201dAs they had talked, they arrived at the arena under Bai Yue Mountain which was surrounded by mountains. Since today was the first day, they still stood in accordance with the previous line up. On the high platform stood a strong man in red, with thick eyebrows and big eyes. His posture was as tall as a tree and looked very imposing as he held a large spear.\u201cWho is that?\u201d He Yan asked.\u201cThe instructor in charge of overseeing our drills, Instructor Shen.\u201d Mak was a chatterbox and had already made inquiries before he arrived.He Yan nodded. She had originally thought that Xiao Jue would come to train the soldiers himself, but she didn\u2019t get a glimpse of him today. Even though they were both young generals, each general had their own way of training. He Yan also wanted to see Xiao Jue\u2019s method of being a master, but for the time being, it seemed impossible for her to do so.\u201cI am Shen Han, your chief instructor.\u201d Shen Han\u2019s voice was very sharp. As they listened to his voice, it felt like something drilled into their ears and made people\u2019s scalps numb, \u201cFrom now on, I will lead you.\u201d He shook the military register and said, \u201cCount the soldiers now!\u201dAs today was the first time the soldiers were counted, it would take some time. After a few days, they would be divided into troops, brigades, and divisions, and the troops would be sent to their appointed commanders of the army, brigades, and the division\u00a0 would save a lot of time.The group of people were all skirmishers recruited from the capital. They had never received any training in the past. They stood in the training arena as they felt uncomfortable all over the body and sneakingly moved their bodies from time to time. Mak secretly muttered to his big brother, \u201cBig brother, Brother He is not moving, he\u2019s standing there like a stone.\u201dShi glanced at He Yan and pondered.It seems that He Yan should be called by his name more than he, himself. She stood upright, with her arms on her side and looked brightly at the platform, neither tired nor bored. This posture gave people the illusion that even after two more hours, she could stand still like that.When Shi and Mak hunted in the mountains, there were wild animals in the mountains, and when the wild animals wanted to catch their prey, they would hide quietly in the grass, motionless, similar to an inanimate stone. He hunted with wheat for so many years \u2013 that\u2019s why Mak and himself stood there motionless for an hour. How could He Yan accomplish this too? According to Hong Shan, He Yan joined the army because his family was desperate. He seemed to have a good family in the past. Why do such people have long-term patience and perseverance akin to wild beasts?!After all, He Yan didn\u2019t need to hunt.His contemplation didn\u2019t get an answer, and soon, the soldiers\u2019 count was finished.Instructor Shen closed the military register and said, \u201cFrom today onwards, hundred people will be formed into one team, and will be assigned an instructor. Here we will train, drill, and charge the troops! What I want to teach you today are military orders!\u201d At this point, Shen Han had a smile on his face, and for some reason, when this smile fell on the eyes of the crowd, they only felt a chill in their hearts.Sure enough, they heard Shen Han who snapped, \u201cThe name will not be called! If the time of arrival is not right or if the troops are too slow, the offenders will be punished! Today you are all a moment late \u2013 you should have been dealt with by military laws! Since, it\u2019s your first offense, you all are being spared.\u201dThe people were carried up and down by his words, and as soon as they fell, they heard the emotionless voice of their cold instructor.\u201cEveryone would run around the barracks with sandbags on your backs \u2013 a total ten laps! Not even one lap less. The instructors from each team will be watching you. Whoever dares to be lazy will be dealt with by military law!\u201dThe crowd all sucked in a breath of cold air.Bai Yue Mountain\u2019s lower martial arts field was the barracks. One lap meant more than one mile, and ten laps would be more than ten miles. Moreover, they would also have to carry a sandbag. In comparison to when they got up today, they didn\u2019t feel excited anymore. At this moment, some soldiers came down.The sun was high, and the heat hung at the top of their head. They all stood there sweating.The idea of running around the arena, against the sun, made everyone full of grief.Mak said, \u201cBrother He, instructor Shen said exactly the same as what you said, how did you know he would say that?\u201dHow does she know?\u00a0Naturally, it was because when she joined the barracks back then, she was in the same situation. It was like a death stick \u2013 they would give the new recruits a head start and let them know that they didn\u2019t come here to enjoy happiness. Even if it wasn\u2019t one of stated situations, Shen Han would still find some other reason to punish them.\u201cMemorizing more military orders,\u201d He Yan patted the youth\u2019s shoulder, \u201cwill be good for you.\u201d Mak nodded even though he didn\u2019t understand.As expected, according to what Shen Han had\u00a0 said, the many soldiers were divided into teams of a hundred men. Everyone went to get a sandbag. At first, He Yan thought that the sandbag would be just like the firewood\u00a0 which she and He Yun Sheng used while going up to the mountain. But when she got to the end, her eyelids jumped.The sandbag was the size of a baggage, which could not be tied to the leg, but only could be carried on the body. When it comes to heavyweight, the firewood could by no means be comparable to these sandbags.\u201cDamn it, it\u2019s too much to run ten laps with this thing on your back!\u201d Hong Shan complained.Mak secretly looked at the face of He Yan. He Yan showed a very calm face from beginning till now. When he picked up the bag of sandbags, there was finally a change in his expression. Mak secretly breathed a sigh of relief. It seemed that Brother He was also an ordinary person, not omnipotent.He Yan was speechless.When she trained the new recruits back then, in order to increase the strength of the recruits, necessary weight running was supposed to be done in the beginning and it was all gradual. Most of the time, it was done with the sandbags she had made in Wo\u2019s house, asnd the weight was increased little by little.She did not know Xiao Jue\u2019s method of military training before, but now she finally knew it. He was ferocious right from the beginning. Xiao Jue had a beautiful face, but she did not expect that he had such a ruthless heart, so she underestimated Xiao Jue\u2019s ruthlessness.What a vicious guy\u2026\u201cBrother He, you.\u201d Hong shan was about to ask if he wanted him to help carry the sandbag on his back when he saw He Yan picking up the sandbag and tying it neatly to her body.He Yan was thin and small, and compared to the barracks full of men, she was like a teenager who had not yet grown up. The sandbag was too big and heavy and pressed against her back which made the teenager look even shorter. The image looked pitiful.Shi was a man of few words but still couldn\u2019t bear to watch, and said to her: \u201cAre you alright?\u201d\u201cI am fine.\u201d He Yan replied.Several people saw her smile and felt a little relieved, as they concluded that she was a young and strong child, and although she looked a little thin and weak, she still had strength.In the meantime, He Yan scolded Xiao Jue ten thousand times in her heart.Of course, there was no problem with such load-bearing in the past. But the original Miss He had a delicate figure, and no matter how hard she tried, she couldn\u2019t turn Miss He into Hercules overnight.It was that heavy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although everyone was complaining and yelling, there was no delay. The head coach in charge of He Yan\u2019s team, named Liang Ping, was as ruthless as General Manager Shen. He yelled, \u201cQuickly line up and set off!\u201dAs soon as the order was given, everyone followed the team and began to run with the heavy load.With such a large sandbag on her back, He Yan felt as if she was carrying a huge stone that pushed her body downwards making her unsteady. Ever since she had become the eldest Miss of the He family, she had been accompanying He Yun Sheng out to chop wood. Even though it made the eldest Miss\u2019s weak body more fit, healthier and stronger than the girls of the same age, Xiao Jue\u2019s iron-blooded method of training was a bit too much to bear.In the past, He Yan could do this amount of training, but now, it was difficult.There were more and more people around her, and most of the people who came to join the army were sturdy, tall and mighty, if they were not tall, they were born from poor families and were used to heavy work. Although it was tiring to run laps with a sandbag on your back, very few of them were weak like He Yan, and those who were, they had already died on the way to Liang Zhou. It could be said that in terms of physical qualifications, He Yan was the weakest one at the foot of Bai Yue Mountain in Liangzhou.The two brothers Shi and Mak were fast paced because they were used to hunting in the mountains. They often had to chase the prey and after hunting it, they would tie it to their body. They were used to running with prey tied to them, so they were quite relaxed. Hong Shan was a little older. After running around, he was a little out of breath, wiped the sweat off his forehead, and said, \u201cHey, it\u2019s really not a human\u2019s job.\u201dHe did not hear He Yan\u2019s reply. He looked back and found that He Yan had fallen behind him by more than ten steps, so he slowed down a little and waited for He Yan to ask, \u201cBrother He, can you hold on? You\u2019re looking a little ill.\u201dHe Yan looked pale and beads of sweat rolled down from her forehead to her chin and finally fell to her clothes. Carrying a sandbag on her back, she looked like those children on the docks of the capital who were sold by their parents to the gang leaders for hard labour. It was an unbearable sight to watch.\u201cI\u2019m fine, Brother Shan you don\u2019t need to worry about me, you go ahead, I can\u2019t run fast, so let me run slowly in the back.\u201d He Yan smiled, \u201cYou can go and have a rest in the shed if you reach early, don\u2019t wait for me.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell the instructor?,\u201d Hong Shan hesitantly opened his mouth, seeing that no one around them was paying attention to them, he leaned closer to whisper, \u201cOr secretly run a few less laps, no one will see you anyway.\u201d\u201cI know it in my heart.\u201d He Yan smiled and said, \u201cBrother Shan, you go first, I\u2019ll meet you later.\u201dHong Shan repeatedly confirmed whether He Yan needed any help before running ahead with the sandbags on his back. He Yan scratched her head and gave a helpless smile.Tell the instructor? How was that possible? If you got into the barracks, you would have to do it even if you couldn\u2019t. Secretly run two laps less? How was that possible? It only looked like there were no people around, but these instructors were very clever, and there were many hidden supervisors on the side of the road. If she wanted to secretly run a few laps less, it would be a violation of military discipline and she would be dragged out to be beaten. When she was a general, she knew this stuff, and when she was a soldier; she had no reason to do this kind of thing.\u201cIt\u2019s just.\u201d She wiped the sweat rolling on her eyelids and looked at the golden sun hanging over her head.It\u2019s so hot!\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Someone came out of the guardhouse.Cheng Li Shu fanned the wind with the folding fan, looking towards the distant mountain peaks covered by clouds and mist, and spoke joyfully, \u201cThe scenery here is also wonderful, ten thousand times more beautiful than the capital! Uncle has such a good eye!\u201dXiao Jue followed him, wearing a black and golden robe embroidered with cloud patterns, and a long sword hung on his waist. His eyes looked like stars, his lips were like vermilion, his aptitude charming and his appearance was beautiful. The ground also added a bright aura. He looked like a noble boy who just happened to pass by, adding brightness to the bitter and cold place.\u201cThey\u2019re running, tsk tsk,\u201d Cheng Li Shu shook his head, \u201cIf I were to do this, I\u2019m sure I wouldn\u2019t last a quarter of an hour.\u201d\u201cThen you go back.\u201d The answer to him was a cold sneer.\u201cAh what did you say, the wind is so strong, I can\u2019t hear you\u2026 Uncle, look who\u2019s here.\u201d Cheng Li Shu bluntly diverged from the conversation.The visitor was Instructor Shen Han, who stopped in front of the two of them, saluted Xiao Jue, and said, \u201cYour Excellency.\u201d\u201cHow are the new recruits?\u201d, Xiao Jue asked.\u201cIt seems that they\u2019re not bad. Sometimes there are a few that can\u2019t do it. Maybe they\u2019ll be good with practice.\u201d Shen Han replied.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with that person?\u201d Cheng Li Shu pointed to the distance, \u201cHe seems to be running and kneeling at the same time.\u201dOn the long path, there was a short teenager running, his pace was so slow that it was hard to say if he was running. He had put a lot of distance between him and the front group, moreover, his delicate physique made him look like the sandbag on his back was heavier than himself.\u201cThat\u2019s Liang Ping\u2019s recruit, running the fourth lap.\u201d\u201cThe fourth lap?\u201d Xiao Jue raised his eyebrows.The others had already started running the seventh lap, and this person had just started running the fourth lap, falling so far behind. He said lightly, \u201cThe qualification is too poor.\u201dCheng Li Su and Shen Han looked at each other without saying anything. They were stunned by Xia Jue\u2019s words, which was really bad because it meant that he could not go to the battlefield.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if the qualification is too poor,\u201d Cheng Li Shu thought of something and smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s good to be a weaponsmith, in case he\u2019s good at it.\u201dHe Yan herself, who was expected to be good at craftsmanship, was running so slow that she didn\u2019t know what to say. The sandbag on her body was really heavy, but she had no choice except to continue. She clearly understood that physical training was just the beginning, and after a while, she would gradually get more skill training, such as crossbow and arrows.But if she couldn\u2019t even endure the physical training, she would not be qualified to continue the skill training and would be thrown out of the ranks.Now, she felt that she didn\u2019t want to be a soldier.Near the shed, after running the last lap, Hong Shan finally found Mak and Shi who were resting in the shed and went over to sit down next to them.Mak looked around and asked, \u201cWhere is Brother He? Didn\u2019t you come two run ogether?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t see him,\u201d Hong Shan was also worried. \u201cThis boy can\u2019t run, he might not have finished yet.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you tell Brother He to run two laps less secretly?\u201d Mak whispered, \u201cNo one would notice it anyway.\u201d\u201cI told him! This boy is a stubborn donkey. He doesn\u2019t listen to me. What can I do?\u201d Hong Shan spread his both hands.As they were talking, Shi suddenly spoke, \u201cHere he comes.\u201dA few people followed his gaze and saw a teenager slowly running at the end of the long path. He was carrying a sandbag that was excessively large compared to his size, his hair was wet in locks, and beads of sweat were slowly dripping down his forehead to his chin and into the dirt beneath his feet. He ran past the vicinity of the shed and didn\u2019t look their way. He continued on, starting a new lap.\u201cHe still wants to run.\u201d Mak murmured.He Yan didn\u2019t stop.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That look clearly stated that He Yan could only be a fellow soldier.\u201cHow did you even finish?\u201d Hong Shan said, \u201cWhat a dead brain, I think there were people running less laps next to me, they are smarter than you!\u201dHe Yan was so tired that she didn\u2019t want to speak, so she only said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a paramedic soldier in the army.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with being a paramedic soldier? Don\u2019t underestimate the guerilla soldiers, people say they might not live longer than us.\u201d Hong Shan disagreed.\u201cI think so too,\u201d Mak looked longingly, \u201cIf I become a guerilla soldier, I will be able to cook more delicious food for everyone!\u201dHe Yan replied tonelessly, \u201c\u2026If you want to work as a cook, then don\u2019t join the army.\u201dMak grievously looked at Shi, \u201cBig Brother wanted me to come.\u201dWhat kind of people are they?\u00a0He Yan thought as she sighed up to the heavens in her heart.She was terribly tired and her legs were a bit soft. Both Hong Shan and Mak\u00a0 helped her move forward, \u201cIt\u2019s only the first day, how long can you persist?\u201dAs long as I can,\u00a0He Yan exclaimed in her heart.With Chief Instructor Shen\u2019s ruthlessness, the entire day was spent in fatigue. In the afternoon, the few soldiers who were lazy and hadn\u2019t run ten laps were arrested and beaten by the military baton. They were called worse than chickens. It was like they killed the chickens to warn the monkeys to train properly in the afternoon. At that time, no one dared to slack off.As He Yan thought, the first half of the month was all physical training. It was nothing more than running with weights, standing under the sun, and lining up. Half a month later, the skills training finally began, and when that reached a certain level, they started to divide the camp.In He Yan\u2019s previous life, she was in the vanguard camp. Now she still wanted to enter the vanguard camp, but the problem was, with Xiao Jue\u2019s training method, she would be eliminated by the time she reached the frontier. After all, physical strength was now her weakness.She thought this as she drank the porridge in the bowl.The congee was thick rice porridge, with all sorts of wild vegetables, fruits, and beans in it. Half a bucket of rice in the morning, and a third of the millet for dinner, with some lumps of noodles in between. If it was some special occasion, there would be soup cakes, meat and so on.But at the beginning, they had to be satisfied with the porridge.It had a faint taste, but because she was exhausted, she felt rather hungry. Almost no one spoke at the place where they ate as they buried their heads and relished the food.\u201cIt would be nice to have some wine.\u201d Hong Shan smacked his lips. \u201cI finally understand why people don\u2019t choose to come to the army until they have no choice but to go. This is not something a human can do.\u201d\u201cI want to hunt,\u201d Mak glanced bitterly at Shi. \u201cBrother, I want to eat a roast rabbit.\u201dShi replied, \u201c\u2026Wait\u00a0 for a few days.\u201dHe Yan was amused. Even if he waited for another month, there was no chance of hunting. After entering the barracks, if anyone tried to run, they would be declared a deserter, and all deserters are to be executed.After dinner, everyone went to take a bath. Hong Shan hesitated for a moment and asked, \u201cBrother He, are you really not going?\u201dAfter a day in the sun, her whole body was sweaty and sticky. \u201cThe river is already full of people like dumplings\u201d. Hong Sshan said, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, I will hold you and keep you safe from drowning.\u201dHe Yan looked embarrassed, \u201cForget it, Brother Shan, I\u2019ll wait until late at night, I\u2019ll go to the river to grab a few buckets of water, and just flush it in the shallows.\u201d\u201cAlright, then.\u201d Hongshan didn\u2019t force her, \u201cYou rest first.\u201dWhen Hongshan and the others walked away, only then did He Yan let out a sigh of relief.It was really inconvenient to enter the army barracks. There were no separate rooms for the soldiers in the guardhouse, nor a separate tent in the field. Bathing became a big problem. She once lived a life of handcuffs, so she stayed on the embankment every night to avoid revealing herself, but then gradually, she was promoted to an officer, to a deputy general, then a chief general, and had her own tent room \u2013 these things were never a problem that time.She didn\u2019t expect to go back down the old road again.He Yan lay down on the bed and rested for a while. When the people who went to the river to take bath came back one after another, everyone started to rest, and the snoring sound of Hong Shan woke He Yan up. She looked at the moon from outside the window and estimated that the time had come. She got up from the bed, jumped over Mak, rolled up her clean clothes, and sneaked out of the door.Outside the Liang Zhou guardhouse, the field was empty, and a round bright moon shone. Maybe because it was the border, the moonlight gave a different feeling compared to the capital. He Yan crept to the river.The river was around the guardhouse at the foot of Bai Yue Mountain, and it\u2019s name was very interesting. It was called Wulu River. It was rumored that one day a fisherman who had lived by the river returned by boat late at night and saw a fairy who wore light makeup, dressed in plain clothes, and rode a five-colored deer on the river, hence the river\u2019s name.There were many boulders along the river. He Yan found a stone and placed the clean clothes behind it in order to not get them wet, then she proceeded to take off her outer clothes and then took a dip in the water.What she had said to Hong Shan was true, because after the Xu family was drowned in the pond, she did not dare get too close to the water. She would not even come to the river if she had a choice. Therefore, even if she went in she would only stay in the shallow water.The river was cold, and with the refreshing breeze,\u00a0 the summer heat felt comfortable. He Yan wiped her face, and the tiredness of the trek with sandbags in the afternoon swept away, so now every part of her body felt comfortable and relaxed. Unlike the capital, the bright moon here was as cold as snow, and it shone in the boundless wilderness as it reached the river, having its own grandeur and elegance.\u201cBai Yue Mountain, Wulu River\u2026\u201d He Yan whispered softly, the name indeed was extremely elegant. She looked at the silver moon and thought that all she was short of was light makeup and plain clothes. If a fisherman passed by here at this moment, he might take her to be the \u2018beautiful fairy\u2019 in the rumor.She thought about it, and it seemed funny, so she laughed out loud.\u201cWho?\u201d A voice rang out in the silence, strange and familiar.He Yan almost swallowed a mouthful of river water into her belly.No way. At this hour? There were still people coming?The man\u2019s footsteps paused first, and then came towards He Yan\u2019s direction. He Yan was ignorant and immediately hid behind a huge rock in front of her. Because she was already in shallow water, she was not far from the river and was able to see the man clearly.He was a young man who wore a dark blue gauze embroidered with a fairy crane, which seemed to flow with the wind. He was already handsome, with a cold and graceful look, and his eyebrows and eyes were beautiful and picturesque. Under the moonlight, the long sword on his waist felt like a long shard of ice which made his expression even colder.This beautiful young man was the commander of the Right Army, Xiao Jue.He Yan saw the man\u2019s appearance clearly and wailed in her heart.This really was a narrow path.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What are you doing?\u201dSure enough, the footsteps came to a standstill.He Yan breathed a sigh of relief. Based on her previous understanding of Xiao Jue, he was an extremely fussy person. Being naked was a misdemeanor in front of him, and he wouldn\u2019t want to dirty his eyes.\u201cWho are you? And what are you doing here?\u201d Xiao Jue stared at her and asked coldly.\u201cI\u2019m a recruit from the guardhouse. I\u2019m here to take a bath.\u201d He Yan replied.After he heard those words, Xiao Jue \u2018s flashed a trace of sarcasm, which made it clear that he did not believe her. He asked, \u201cIs this the time to take a bath?\u201d\u201cThere were too many people at night, so I fell asleep in my room.\u201d He Yan looked at him, \u201cI\u2019m not an adult. If I had my own room to bathe in, who would want to run into the river at night to bathe? It\u2019s too cold!\u201dThis \u2018adult\u2019 referred to Xiao Jue himself. She hoped Xiao Jue could understand her sarcasm.Unfortunately, Xiao Jue didn\u2019t look ashamed of her words, just looked at her calmly.He Yan sank herself into the river and asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201dShe thought,\u00a0Well, let\u2019s just pretend to be an ignorant new recruit, it will seem more convincing.Xiao Jue didn\u2019t answer her. Instead, he said, \u201cIf it\u2019s too cold, then why did you join the army?\u201dWas that to refute what she just said? He Yan looked at her clothes behind the boulder. If Xiao Jue refused to go away, she would have to remain soaked in the water all the time. But if she stayed in the water for too long, she would inevitably arouse Xiao Jue\u2019s suspicion about her identity.\u201cI came to join the army with a purpose.\u201d He Yan said.Xiao Jue raised his eyebrows, and asked, \u201cWhat purpose?\u201d\u201cOf course, it\u2019s to make contributions, get promoted, become rich, and be a young, successful person like General Feng Yun. Then go home to build a house, marry the most beautiful and virtuous young lady, have a lot of children and grandchildren, and live a prosperous life.\u201d He Yan showed a type of look, of one that yearned for the future.Xiao Jue\u2019s eyes went cold, and he coldly rebuked, \u201cVulgar!\u201dHe Yan was so happy in her heart that she purposely associated the name General Feng Yun together with the wishes of ordinary men under the universal sky to deliberately disgust him. Someone as proud as Xiao Jue must have felt humiliated in his heart.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d He Yan looked serious, \u201cPeople join the army to become the happiest of men.\u201dAs though he was unable to listen to such rambles from her, Xiao Jue glanced at her and whisked away, and looked like he didn\u2019t want to talk to her anymore.He Yan said behind him, \u201cHello, brother, do me a favor, please help me throw the clothes behind the stone.\u201dNaturally, Xiao Jue would not pick up clothes for her. He Yan waited until he was far away and was completely out of sight, washed herself quickly, ran to the stone, and changed her clothes.The moon was silent, as if it hadn\u2019t seen anything that had happened. He Yan held onto her dirty clothes and walked back, but thought about the scene where she saw Xiao Jue.At this time of the day, Xiao Jue should not be here to do anything, so he probably just came out to walk around at random. After all, the night was so good.Speaking of which, He Yan and Xiao Jue had not seen each other for many years. The last time she met him was at the academy. She feared that he would find out who she really was, so she bowed her head hastily, and was unable to clearly see the difference between Xiao Jue from the past and Xiao Jue from the present. It was rare to see him like this, but she felt that he was different from what she remembered.She knew that Xiao Jue was born with unparalleled elegance and beauty, and many young girls would come forward just for one look from him. She didn\u2019t know what he had eaten to grow up, but now it seemed that Xiao Jue\u2019s style was much better than the past. In the past, Xiao Jue still had a bit of the youth\u2019s unique frivolity, but now it was gone. He was like fine jade, like a sword in a sheath, with a subtle flow of brilliance.His temperament was also much colder than before.He Yan walked slowly.She reminisced of the past. After a big quarrel with her family, she joined the army,\u00a0 so she didn\u2019t know what had happened in Xianchang Pavilion. At that time, Xiao Jue was the young master of the Xiao family, so everything was monotonous. After she left for the army, it took several years for her to learn about the situation of the second son of the Xiao family from the talk of the people around her.Xiao Jue\u2019s father, Xiao Zhong Wu, was a brave general of the Wei Dynasty. He defeated enemies, such as the Iron Plate of the Wei State, with almost no effort nor many resources. However, when he attacked the Southern Barbarians, he was ambushed by the enemy in the First Battle of Mingshui and died in the hands of the enemy leader. After General Xiao died, Xiao Jue took over the troops and continued to lead the troops to attack the southern barbarians.He Yan was fifteen years old when she joined the army, and Xiao Jue was only one year older than her. She didn\u2019t know what happened but only knew that Xiao Jue, a sixteen-year-old boy, took over the soldiers and horses from his father, which was certainly not a simple task. The Xiao family\u2019s political opponents, like the royal family, would also not miss this opportunity.If Xiao Jue was defeated, the entire Xiao family would be defeated as well, and as a family of military generals, the Xiao family would never be able to survive with just one scholar holding them up \u2013 the eldest son of Xiao.Fortunately, thanks to his extraordinary good luck, Xiao Jue not only won but also made a grand victory. He defeated the Southern Barbarians, left them to crumble, and returned to the capital with the head of the enemy general. At this point, he established his reputation as the \u201cYoung General\u201d and \u201cJade Faced Governor\u201d.War is the fastest way to sharpen one\u2019s character, and all types of edges must be put away in front of life and death. Perhaps at that time, Xiao Jue still had the arrogance of a noble son in the capital, but now it could no longer be seen.A better, more indifferent, more unfathomable, and a man more difficult with.He Yan went to the door of the room, where everyone slept soundly. No one noticed her. She put her clothes at the foot of the bed, lay flat on her back, closed her eyes, and felt peaceful. Fortunately, Xiao Jue was not the only one who grew up over the years. She was also the same as Xiao Jue.It wasn\u2019t that bad.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When they get up in the morning for count, their appearance must be neat, tidy and sharp.The bed they sleep in\u00a0 must be neatly made before departure the next morning. If messy, an extra lap to their routine would be added.An extra round, who\u2019s going to do it? Amidst the cries for their fathers and mothers, the recruits\u2019 appearance and discipline were quickly rectified. In just over a half month, the fresh recruits, though not capable of being armed with swords and arrows yet, were already decent, at least in appearance.He Yan looked at Xiao Jue and sighed in her heart. Although Xiao Jue\u2019s heart was darker than hers in her previous life, his methods were quite powerful. Compared to General Xiao, He Yan only felt that her previous method of training troops was simply too benevolent.It seems that she still had much to learn from Xiao Jue.While the recruits ran lap after lap, the head instructors took advantage of the gap between the recruits to speak with each other.Chief instructor Shen Han looked at Liang Ping and asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you see the one from your team\u2026 Um, the weakest kid?\u201dThese days, everyone knew that among the weakest recruits who came to Liang Zhou, was a recruit under the name Liang Jiao, a young boy with a thin figure and poor physical strength. Therefore, he often fell behind half of the people while everyone ran in the morning. A day or two might be fine, but after three days, almost everyone knew about such a person.It could be said that he was notoriously weak.\u201cAre you talking about He Yan?\u201d Liang Ping nudged towards the mountain road in the distance and said, \u201cAhead, there, the one running in the middle is him.\u201dShen Han looked over unamused, but saw that on the long trail, the teenager ran forward with his sandbag on his back. Although everyone was uniformly dressed in red clothes and looked somewhat strong, the youngster was too thin and short, so it was easy to spot him at a glance.Shen Han was a little surprised, \u201cSo, he isn\u2019t lagging anymore?\u201d\u201cHow could it be?\u201d Liang Ping\u2019s face showed a little mixed emotion. \u201cThis kid is very determined.\u201dSpeaking of which, Liang Ping was not optimistic about He Yan at first either. To be honest, he\u2019d been a trainer for many years and had seen countless recruits. Just one glance at the adolescent and Liang Ping could judge whether or not he could become a fierce soldier. He Yan\u2019s physical qualifications were terrible. Perhaps he grew up in a pampered way, so it was clear that he couldn\u2019t muster much strength. On the first day of the morning run, he ran like a snail, and Liang Ping decided in his heart that He Yan could at most become a guerilla or paramedic soldier.Unexpectedly, he didn\u2019t expect the boy, who was in poor health, to have such a strong temperament. Even though he fell behind every day, he ran with the team. Liang Ping also noticed that from the first day till now, he was never once lazy, instead, he ran very seriously.If the son of a rich family came as a soldier, it would be amazing to have this will and perseverance. What\u2019s more, He Yan never implemented any useless work.He seemed to have mastered some kind of trick, as he gradually began to adapt to this weight-bearing long-distance run. He initially lagged behind everyone in the beginning, but gradually began to slowly catching up with the others , and now could even keep up with the team. Liang Ping even had the illusion that if he went on like this, and ran for a few more days, he might be able to overtake every other recruit.While he was thinking, he suddenly heard the voice of Shen Han beside him.\u201cWhat\u2019s the use of hard-heartedness, a qualification is a qualification.If he can barely keep up with the run, then the skill training in the future will be too difficult for him\u2026 I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be able to pass the skill training.\u201dThe last morning run was to evaluate the physique and potential of the recruits from each team before they could start skill training. But too many people fell behind. Since manpower was already limited, there was even a possibility that they couldn\u2019t provide the skill training to such people. It was impossible to allocate such skills to those who were not worth it.Wars were cruel and brutal, so they could only choose people who could afford the battle.\u201cI think he can.\u201d Liang Ping said.Shen Han and several other passing by instructors looked at him. Someone said, \u201cInstructor Liang, are you sure? Don\u2019t change your mind later. From your years of experience, you should know that\u00a0 such weak people\u2026don\u2019t survive on the battlefield for long.\u201dAfter he listened to what he believed was mere nonsense, Liang Ping smiled,\u201dYou must also know that severe training and hammering makes any type of person unfathomable. Who can be too sure of these kinds of things?\u201dHe looked at He Yan. The young man\u2019s forehead was covered with shiny beads of sweat. In the summer heat, while his companions ran and gritted their teeth, mostly from impatience, he was the only one with a smile on his face and no complaints.This kind of will was really rare.\u2026He Yan did not know that her minor role had become the center of discussion among the head instructors. She finished the last lap and put the sandbags away. Suddenly she was met with a shoulder punch hammered by Hong Shan.\u201cHey, boy, aren\u2019t you something?\u201d Hong Shan looked at him while he stroked his chin. \u201cNow, you can keep up with us. Are you happy that you don\u2019t have to be a guerilla soldier?\u201dHe Yan laughed, \u201cOf course.\u201dSeeing that she was much better now as compared to when after she had finished her run and almost collapsed a few days ago, Hong Shan also felt happy for her. At this time, Mak waved to them from afar, \u201cBrother He, Brother Shan, hurry up, there is a steamed bun today!\u201dAfter coming here for so long, finally, they had a meal of meat. He Yan heard the words, and suddenly felt her mouth full of water, Hong Shan also licked his lips and said, \u201cFinally, a good meal, let\u2019s go quickly!\u201dThere was porridge in the iron pan, one bowl for each person, and the steamed meat buns were in the large wooden barrel next to it. The head soldier responsible for distribution stood in front of the barrel, and each person was given one.He Yan also received one.She held the porridge bowl but there was no room for her there to sit down, so she thought of finding a cool place to sit and drink the porridge. She saw the little clever ghost, Mak, beckon to her from under the tree from a distance, which seemed to be a good place to cool off.He Yan planned to leave.Halfway to her destination, someone rudely and forcefully nudged her shoulder, and caused her to stumble and spill half of the porridge from her hand.She didn\u2019t have a firm grip on her steamed bun either, and it rolled off. He Yan was about to reach out to catch the bun in the air, but suddenly a hand stretched out and snatched the steamed bun.She stood still. In front of her was a tall man with a mustache, and an old scar on his left forehead to cheek. The scar-faced man was born powerful and aggressive. He got the steamed bun as if it could be taken for granted. He didn\u2019t even look at He Yan and continued to move forward.A foot was laid in front of the man.The man paused and looked at the person before him.The teenager withdrew his feet, and there was a polite smile on his face as if he did not understand what had happened. He Yan said, \u201cThis Brother, you seem to have taken the wrong thing.\u201d\u201cThe bun in your hand is mine.\u201dThe scar-faced man gave her a weird look. After a while, he suddenly laughed out loud, as if he heard a funny joke. He opened his mouth, his voice hoarse, \u201cDo you know what you are talking about?\u201d\u201cI said,\u201d the boy replied with a calm expression, \u201cThe bun in your hand is mine.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The army\u2019s crimson colored uniform looked wider and slightly longer on him and he was also shorter than an average boy.The child barked at him like an ungrateful pup barking at a wolf, which looked ridiculous.\u201cYour stuff?\u201d Before He Yan could react, The scar-faced man disdainfully grabbed the meat bun and stuffed it into his mouth. He gobbled up the meat bun, which wasn\u2019t very big, in a couple of bites as if a beast had caught its prey and couldn\u2019t wait to eat. When he finished eating, he looked provocatively at He Yan and smiled strangely, \u201cYours? Who can testify? What can you do to me?\u201dThe food had already entered his stomach, and He Yan couldn\u2019t possibly slit his stomach open to get the steamed bun back. After the other party finished saying his words, he looked at He Yan\u2019s helpless appearance with pleasure and walked forward nonchalantly with the porridge bowl in his hand.\u201cWhat can I do to you?\u201d He Yan muttered to herself. After a while, she smiled and turned around, taking three steps towards the scar-faced man, who was bending over to drink the porridge in the bowl. She kicked the porridge bowl and the porridge in his hand spilled on the ground, leaving nothing behind. He then turned his head in rage to see who had kicked it, seeing that it was He Yan he gritted his teeth and shouted, \u201cYou!\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d He Yan said with a smile, \u201cWho can testify that I did it? What can you do to me?\u201dThe young man\u2019s eyes were cunning, with a hint of subtle provocation that was infuriating. The scar-faced man raised his fist and moved forward.\u201cHey, what do you want?\u201dAt this time, a voice rushed out from the side. It was Hong Shan and Shi who came over. When Mak saw that He Yan had been talking with the scar-faced man for a long time, he guessed that something might have happened and called his elder brother and Hong Shan over.Hong Shan and Shi, unlike He Yan, were not bullied easily as they both looked strong and sturdy. The scar-faced man didn\u2019t act on impulse, he only snorted coldly while staring at He Yan and said, \u201cYou wait for me.\u201d Then, he turned around and walked away.The tone was extremely harsh and threatening.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Hong Shan asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cHe stole my steamed bun, and I spilled his vegetable porridge on the ground, fair enough.\u201d He Yan tried to say it as simply as possible. Hong Shan understood as soon as he heard it, looked at He Yan and said, \u201cHey\u201d. He then gave out a sigh and continued, \u201cWhy did you pick a fight with him, you should have just endured it.\u201d\u201cWhy should I endure?\u201d He Yan asked.She had encountered these kinds of things from time to time in the past when she was in the army. In the barracks, there were often incidents of the strong bullying the weak. When she was in the barracks, it was common for her to be robbed of her food. If it wasn\u2019t for her brothers who took pity on her and gave her a share of their own food, she might have starved to death.The instructor in the barracks could stop the open conflict, but not that kind of secret robbery. Moreover, she was too weak at that time, so weak that even the instructor didn\u2019t bother to talk to her, let alone seek justice for her. Until later, when she became strong, and no one dared to take her food. And later, when she became a general, she ordered all the new recruits under her command to never take food from anyone and to never bully the weak.Who knew that she would be born again and would have to encounter exactly the same circumstances? But this time, she was no longer the poor recruit who had just entered the barracks, trembling and aggrieved to dare not say anything. Even if Hong Shan and Shi did not appear, she would have been enough to teach this scarface a lesson.\u201cThat man\u2019s name is Wang Ba,\u201d Hong Shan said, \u201cHe was originally a bandit, but I don\u2019t know how he ended up coming to join the army. He\u2019s the fiercest one under Instructor Liang, and I\u2019ve heard from people that this kind of man kills like a sore thumb, and you provoked him today. If he harbors a grudge, he will definitely stumble you in the future. Brother Shi and I can\u2019t follow you every day, in case he exploits you\u2026 your life would be difficult.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t just sit and do nothing when he steals from me. Brother Shan, you have to believe that if he can steal one time, there will be a second time, and if he comes back day after day to rob me, will I still be able to live?\u201d He Yan said, \u201cThings are not so fair in the world.\u201d\u201cThings in the world aren\u2019t fair in the first place.\u201d The one who spoke was the ever-quiet Shi, who looked at He Yan and gently shook his head, seemingly disapproving of what she had just done, \u201cYou\u2019re too impulsive.\u201d\u201cIf there\u2019s no fairness, we can fight for it ourselves, if we can\u2019t fight for fairness because we\u2019re too weak, we can try to become stronger.\u201d He Yan smiled slightly, \u201cIf fists are the only thing that makes sense here, then let him come to me, I promise\u2026 I\u2019ll let him know what fairness is.\u201dThe boy spoke lightly, and his expression was calm. There seemed to be a slight smile in his clear pupils. The wind blew, and his hair flowed with the air, not like a soldier, but like a noble child walking down the streets in the capital. They were reminded of a joke \u2018newborn calves are not afraid of tigers\u2019, but when they were met with those eyes, they couldn\u2019t dare to utter those words.Was it true that a newborn calf was not afraid of a tiger?He seemed confident, not reckless.Shi and Hong Shan did not say anything else. The two accompanied He Yan to the tree. Mak knew that HeYan\u2019s meat bun had been robbed and felt very sorry for a while, and finally said in a clumsy way to comfort her, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Brother He, in a few days we can go up to the mountain. There, I\u2019ll make a few slingshots to shoot birds, or get a few traps to catch rabbits. We\u2019ll eat meat then, it would be much better than the meat present in that steamed bun.\u201dHe Yan laughed and responded happily. After drinking the porridge in the bowl, she rested her hands behind her head and leaned against the tree trunk to take a nap.The sun was shining lazily, and there was a rare coolness under the tree. She closed her eyes, her heart turning back and forth.Although the meat bun was a bit of a pity, it shouldn\u2019t go so far, as to haggle over it all the time. When she used to march and fight, her military pay sometimes could not keep up with her needs. She was forced to defend the city, forget meat buns or vegetable porridge, sometimes she had to gnaw the bark and grass roots. And during the worst times, she had to eat Guanyin soil, making her stomach bloated, but even then she defended the city to death.Comparing it with that time, this was better and considered pleasant.The wind blew across her cheeks and He Yan curled up her lips. If she guessed correctly, in five days at most, the skill training would begin. Some people would be assigned as guards, and with her current physical strength, she could probably qualify for skill training, but how could she show her worth in that short amount of time and prove that she was worthy to go to the Forward Battalion?That was a problem\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 40": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth of a Star GeneralCH 40Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPASSING THE TESTTranslator: SylphEditor: MilacHe Yan guessed right. Three days later, when she was running with a sandbag on her back, Instructor Liang shouted, \u201cFrom tomorrow, running around the barracks will be changed to five laps. As for the remaining time we will do weapons training! So today, run with all your might! If you can\u2019t run well, there will be no lunch at noon.\u201dEveryone got excited upon hearing it. Compared to running with a bag of sand on a hot summer day, weapon training sounded much easier and it was more like what a new recruit should do. Being able to end this purgatory and enter a new phase could just be an indication that they had gradually become a decent soldier of the Wei Dynasty.However, He Yan understood the implication of Instructor Liang\u2019s words. Today was the last \u201ctest\u201d. If the runner was not good enough to keep up with his physical strength, he would no longer be qualified to do the following weapon training.He Yan bent over to carry the sandbag. At that moment, someone passed behind her and suddenly bumped her body heavily. She stood up straight to look at the person. It was the scar-faced man who had robbed her of the bun a few days ago. Wang Ba looked at her with a shrewd smile, \u201cBoy, as soon as today is over, you will be a guerrilla soldier, and your good days will be over.\u201dHe Yan shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cThose two brothers of yours won\u2019t be following you all the time, a guerilla soldier\u2026\u201d he lowered his voice, a hint of tyranny flashing in his eyes, \u201cNo one will care even if I killed you!\u201d\u201cThen try it.\u201d He Yan swung the sandbag on her back, smiled at him, and said, \u201cBy the way, I won\u2019t be a guerilla soldier, absolutely.\u201d With that, no matter what expression Wang Ba had, she turned around and went along the way.Mak followed her nervously and asked, \u201cBrother He, he didn\u2019t embarrass you or give you a hard time just now, did he?\u201d\u201cHow can it be?\u201d He Yan replied with a smile, \u201cWe just chatted a few words.\u201d\u201cOh, okay.\u201d Mak laughed again, \u201cBrother He, you are so amazing, you can run with us now without huffing and you\u2019re still being fast!\u201dMak and Shi grew up in the mountains since childhood, as hunters they had to go out to hunt all day long and utilize so much of their physical strength, it was obvious their running was fast. On the other hand, He Yan\u2019s feeble and reluctant start was obvious to everyone, but now, she was getting more energetic and relaxed every day, making people wonder if she had taken some kind of magic pill.\u201cReally?\u201d He Yan nodded solemnly. \u201cI really have a lot of potential.\u201dOn the other end, the instructors gathered around the edge of the long forest path to observe the situation.The daily long-distance running for more than half a month was not only to train the physical strength of the recruits but also to judge the qualifications of the recruits. They have been recording it every day, and today was the last time. After today, long-distance running would no longer be a means of judging qualifications. It would become a part of the common training because being able to carry out weapons training, meant that the person was qualified to become a recruit of the Wei Dynasty and would not die before the war, at least not for reasons related to their physical strength.There was also a distinction between the strong and the weak in the barracks, and the contrast was even sharper. Those with good qualifications stood out from the start, and those with poor qualifications were bullied from the very beginning. This was an unfair thing, after all, no one could change it.However, there was an exception.\u201cLao Liang,\u201d someone patted instructor Liang on the shoulder. \u201cThat boy named He Yan in your team is really a talent.\u201dHe yan was the exception.Her qualifications were so poor that she was uniformly evaluated by the coaches from the very beginning. Even if she happened to become a guerrilla soldier, everyone was afraid that she would be fumigated by the fire, but she was getting lighter day by day, and now she was able to keep up with the team steadily, even at the front of the team.It was really a miracle.\u201cDripping water pierces a stone; a saw made of rope cuts through woods.\u201d Teacher Liang was very proud, \u201cI have said it a long time ago, I, Liang Ping will not be mistaken. This kid\u2019s will is hard to come by, nothing he does will be bad.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk big,\u201d the instructor who poured cold water on him was called Du Mao. He spoke disapprovingly, \u201cYou also know that qualification is aptitude. The reason why he can keep up with the team is based on hard work.\u201dThat was true, the crowd looked at the young man who was running with the group; he was just the right age, described as optimistic, and looked downright pleasant. He was also very disciplined when running, seldom spoke to the people around him, and ran seriously. In short, it looked like he was very serious about doing this.\u201cHe worked very hard to reach this stage, while the others didn\u2019t need to work hard.\u201d Du Mao said, \u201cNow it\u2019s just a long run with a sandbag on his back, in the future, the weapon drills and battle deployment maneuvers will only become more and more complicated, and he will also have to put in more effort than others. In this way, he will never be top notch and can only be an ordinary soldier.\u201d\u201cI advise you to put more effort into the well-qualified recruits in your team, and not pay too much attention to that kid,\u201d Du Mao shook his head, \u201cThere\u2019s no point.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t be bothered to talk to you.\u201d Liang Ping was not very happy with his words, he took his spear and walked away.However, as he walked away, he also murmured in his heart. Those who were leaders of the army had led a lot of soldiers. Those who could survive or make contributions on the battlefield were often those who were amazing and outstanding at the beginning.That boy could only work hard\u2026 but hard work. Was it really useful?He Yan ran through today\u2019s share in one breath, received her meal and ate it. She waited until the afternoon, when suddenly the instructor Liang came and ordered ten or so soldiers to follow him away.\u201cHey, those seem to be the ones who are going to be the guerrilla soldiers.\u201d Mak said, \u201cBut does the guerrilla team need so many people?\u201dHe Yan smiled and shook her head, \u201cIt\u2019s just a name. It\u2019s not just all cooking, but there are other things. In short, you don\u2019t have to fight directly with people on the front line.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s quite good,\u201d Hong Shan stretched his back, \u201cIsn\u2019t it good to live without having to fight with your life, right?\u201d\u201cBut Brother He must be very happy this time,\u201d said Mak, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a guerrilla soldier!\u201dHe Yan was reluctant to be a fellow soldier, it was something that everyone knew, and she didn\u2019t argue, just smiled and said, \u201cGrateful.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t they going to give you a chance to show off right away?\u201d Hong Shan poked at her and spoke derisively, \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to show off your skills in the next weapons drill, right?\u201d\u201cWell, not really.\u201d He Yan thought for a moment before answering.Knives, arrows, and horsemanship were the things she could do well, lance and step siege weren\u2019t difficult either, after running for so long, climbing and charging was also of no problem, the only difficulty was probably the crossbow.The crossbow required a great deal of hand strength and it was difficult for people who were not physically strong to pull it away. With the original Miss He\u2019s physique, it might become a problem.However, Xiao Jue would not come up with the crossbow for military training, would he? She thought.But she was wrong.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He Yan sized it up and thought that this was indeed a good place to train. At noon, when the sun was at its most blazing moment, and there was no hint of wind, the flags on the high platform clung to the flagpole, just like the recruits who were scorched by the sun.\u201cFrom today onwards, you are about to start weapon training.\u201d Instructor Shen threw his spear to the ground heavily. The crowd shook and braced themselves to look at him.\u201cYou see the clearing?\u201d Shen Han pointed his spear to the north.Next to the open space near the weapon rack were rows of more than a dozen crossbows, which stared menacingly at them, and the targets neatly stood a hundred paces away in front of the crossbow.\u201cStarting from today, you will\u00a0 learn the crossbows!\u201d Instructor Shen gave an order, and the next few days were automatically arranged.Everyone didn\u2019t know whether to cry or laugh for a moment.\u201cWow! Archery is my favorite!\u201d The happiest one was probably Mak. \u201cBrother, this time it\u2019s our turn to shine!\u201dHe Yan turned and asked Shi, \u201cYour hunting bows aren\u2019t as heavy as these, right?\u201dHe looked at the crossbow for a while, then shook his head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s lighter than this one. Our bows are not made of horns, but from the bamboo I sharpened myself.\u201d\u201cAlmost the same,\u201d Mak looked cheerful, but then suddenly thought of something, and asked He Yan, \u201cBrother He, can we use this bow to go up the mountain to hunt rabbits?\u201dHe Yan spared a glance at him, \u201c\u2026Train well, don\u2019t dream.\u201dThey were divided into teams, with each team led by an instructor to practice the crossbows. One instructor demonstrated. He drew the bow and released the arrow, which flew right into the center of the target with a solid \u201cswish\u201d.A burst of cheers erupted from the recruits, and the instructor looked very proud of himself.He Yan couldn\u2019t help BUT praise him in her heart. Liang Ping was no fake, he was really capable. Such people were also good at the battlefield.The soldiers in the barracks were very excited and eager to try their bows. Some who were born with great power drew their bows fully. Although they weren\u2019t able to shoot accurately, the arrow still went far. Some had basic knowledge about bows and arrows, so their focus was on their postures. Many of the recruits, who had the strength but not the aim, shot in a twisted manner, and the arrow fell in midair before they reached the target.In the end, they all got one turn to show what they have.Hong Shan went up to try it as well. Although he was born sturdy and was good at drawing the bow, his aim was not good enough, so the arrow fell before it could reach the edge of the target. Regardless he felt satisfied, nodded to himself, and muttered, \u201cYes, not so bad.\u201dThe two brothers Shi and Mak followed suit. Out of the two, Shi was more firm and strong. The feathered arrow flew out of his hand with a \u201cswish\u201d and fell into the target, and although it was not exactly in the middle, it was still somewhere near.Instructor Liang glanced at him unexpectedly and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name? Have you ever touched bows and arrows before?\u201d\u201cMy name is Zhong Shi, I used to be a hunter,\u201d Shi said solemnly.\u201cNo wonder.\u201d Liang Ping nodded in satisfaction. There was a good seed in the team, so he was naturally happy.The younger brother also went up and introduced himself. \u201cMy name is Zhong Mak, I am his brother, and I am also a hunter!\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Teacher Liang looked forward to it and said, \u201cAre you here to try?\u201dMak followed Shi\u2019s example and drew his bow. But, he didn\u2019t have the impressive skills of his elder brother. The arrow shot off the wrong side and didn\u2019t even hit the target.Liang Ping, \u201c\u2026\u201dMak touched his nose and retreated sadly.He Yan was a bit amused. Just when she thought about whether she should try it as well, someone stepped out ahead of her.\u201cOh,\u201d Hong Shan whispered beside He Yan, \u201cit\u2019s him.\u201dIt turned out to be Wang Ba, who hadn\u2019t paid any serious attention, even when he ran on previous days. Wang Ba was a soldier under the same instructor as them, Instructor Liang. He stepped forward, rolled his sleeves to his elbows, spat on his palm, and picked up the bow.He Yan saw that he was a man of great strength. His arms were so tightly disintegrated that the strong honey-colored skin was faintly visible. Unlike the other recruits, Wang Ba wasn\u2019t as eager to shoot the arrow. He took a sigh of relief and aimed it straight at the middle.This look\u2026 He Yan knew that this wasn\u2019t his first time drawing a bow. Like Shi, he must be a good hand who did archery often.Finally, there was a creak from the tight string, and the feather arrow went straight to the bullseye. Everyone only saw a flash of white light in front of them, and then the grass target standing in front was rushed by the strength of the arrow and fell to the ground with a bang.All the other arrows were missing from the center of the target, only a single arrow could be seen. Not only did he shoot through the grass target, but he also brought the whole target down.He Yan sighed in her mind as that was quite an amazing shot. Wang Ba was strong and steady, his aim was good, and his composure was rare. Instructor Liang\u2019s gaze toward Wang Ba was already different. Among this batch of recruits, there was Shi and Wang Ba, both who excelled in the line of crossbows.Wang Ba put away the bow, but didn\u2019t leave immediately. Instead, he walked two steps in front of He Yan. The scandalous-looking scarred man cupped his hands to his chest, looked at He Yan with a look of watching a good show, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s your turn.\u201dIt was fine until he said it. When he did, the gazes of many people around them turned to He Yan. While she faced Wang Ba\u2019s provocative gaze, He Yan stepped forward.The bow was a good horn bow, very smooth to the touch. It had probably been used countless times before, as it showed some visible traces. He Yan stroked it bit by bit, and the past times in the army suddenly appeared in front of her again. The last time she used a crossbow, she was still \u2018General Fei Hong\u2019.In a flash, so many years had passed, just like that.Liang Ping looked at He Yan with a strange expression.He knew that crossbows were different from other things and required great hand strength. He had already judged He Yan\u2019s physique and previous performance, and knew that she wouldn\u2019t be able to perform well. But\u2026 this was another hard-working recruit. People had expectations for the unknown situations that may arise. Liang Ping himself felt very contradictory.\u201cWhat are you feeling around it for? Don\u2019t waste other people\u2019s time,\u201d Wang Ba sneered. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you show us your superb shooting skills?\u201dHe Yan picked up the bow and placed her fingers on the arrow.After a moment, she set the bow and the arrow down.\u201cBrother He, what does this mean?\u201d Mak was puzzled. Why did Brother He put down the bow before he even started to draw it? Was there something wrong?\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you moving?\u201d Wang Ba was dissatisfied, \u201cMove!\u201d\u201cNo need,\u201d He Yan said with a frank expression, \u201cI can\u2019t draw this bow.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Instructor Liang\u2019s face showed a look of disbelief, and he almost thought that he misheard him.What does he mean \u2018I can\u2019t draw this bow?\u2019 Does he take it for granted, saying something like that so confidently? Instructor Liang had led many soldiers, but this was the worst one he had ever seen!It really pissed him off!\u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about?\u201d Wang Ba didn\u2019t expect He Yan to be so frank. He thought that He Yan was arrogant and naturally had some unique skills in his hands. But this result was simply unacceptable.\u201cI don\u2019t have enough strength in my hands, which is why I can\u2019t draw this bow. Why should I waste time? It would be better to give the crossbow to the brothers who need practice. In a few days, my hands will be strong enough to draw the bow.\u201d\u201cHe Yan, the practice field is not a place for you to play.\u201d Instructor Liang said with a sunken face. He had assumed that this young man would work hard and endure hardships, and his determination would surely lead him to succeed. He didn\u2019t expect him to take his incompetence for granted.\u201cI didn\u2019t take it as a place to play.\u201d The boy\u2019s eyes were clear. He pondered for a while, then made a concession, \u201cThen how about after training today, I will attempt to draw this bow tomorrow?\u201dInstructor Liang\u2019s nose was crooked in anger, \u201cHe Yan!\u201dHe Yan actually thought to bargain with him! Does He Yan regard this guardhouse as a vegetable market? He was very satisfied with the progress He Yan made so far in the run, as he improved day by day, but a crossbow is not a simple matter. The strength in hands was not something that could be achieved overnight. Where did his confidence come from that he even blurted that he could draw the bow by tomorrow?Now, Head Instructor Liang began to regret not heeding to Du Mao\u2019s words. Instead of paying too much attention to He Yan, he should\u2019ve placed him as a guerilla soldier earlier, which could\u2019ve saved him the trouble of dealing with the current situation.\u00a0 At his age, there was nothing he could do, even if he was angry.Not wanting to see He Yan\u2019s innocent face, Teacher Liang waved his hand to him, \u201cFine then. Go over and run five laps with a sandbag on your back!\u201dHe Yan let out an \u201cOh\u201d, obediently walked over and picked up the sandbag, and went up the long road.Even though she did as she was told, her obedient behavior felt like a punch on the face of Instructor Liang, which made him even more frustrated. He turned his head and decided not to look at the boy who made him angry.He Yan ran slowly, and there was one more person beside her, the person who provoked her earlier, Wang Ba.\u201cKid, you are so weak, you still dare to come to the barracks?\u201d Wang Ba smiled wildly, \u201cYou can\u2019t even draw the bow, and you still dare to speak out?\u201d\u201cThis brother,\u201d He Yan said as she ran, \u201cYou stare at me all day long, are you really afraid of me?\u201d\u201cAfraid of you?\u201d Wang Ba was taken aback.\u201cIf you are not afraid of me, you wouldn\u2019t have to follow me all day for the fear that I will steal your limelight.\u201d\u201cWho is afraid of you?\u201d Wang Ba simply wanted to yell at her. What kind of person was this? No words entered this person\u2019s ears or affected him in any way, and instead, he interrupted the words in his own set of opinions.\u201cYou might be aware that private fights are forbidden in the army,\u201d He Yan made a \u201chush,\u201d motion to him, \u201cIf one gets caught, they\u2019ll be dealt with a military baton. There are supervisors everywhere in the mountains, even if you want to pick a fight with me, now is not a good time.\u201dThat was true.Wang Ba stared at her, smiled, and said, \u201cIf I wanted to pick a fight with you, why would I do it in private, you can\u2019t even draw your bow\u2026 In the arena, I can make you kneel and beg for mercy.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d He Yan responded carelessly, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s see you in the practice field. Until then, I don\u2019t want to see your face.\u201d After she spoke, her pace seemed to quicken. She carried her sandbag on her back and left Wang Ba far behind.Wang Ba looked at her brisk back, only to feel dazed and cursed. After that, he turned and walked away.\u2026The crossbow training finally ended after the sunset.The recruits rushed over for food, eager to fill their stomachs, while the instructors gathered together to eat their dinner and talk about the anecdotes of their respective teams today. If there were recruits with good qualifications, they were even more likely to show them off.Liang Ping wanted to boast about Wang Ba and Shi, but when he thought of He Yan, he felt stuffy and was afraid of her name being mentioned, so he simply bowed his head to eat in silence. Unexpectedly, as he became more and more afraid, Du Mao asked without concern, \u201cInstructor Liang, how did your team\u2019s He Yan perform today?\u201dLiang Ping had nothing to say.An instructor next to him laughed and said, \u201cHe! Haha, he gave up before he drew the bow, and even said, \u2018I can\u2019t draw this bow.\u2019 His tone was calm, but the expression felt sarcastic, which seems to be ironic. Instructor Liang was so angry at that time, his face turned blue.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t even draw the bow?\u201d Du Mao was also surprised, \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\u201cThat kid doesn\u2019t look like someone who can stay in the barracks. You don\u2019t know, at the time, he even said that if he gave him a day, he would be able to draw it tomorrow. I said \u2018Where did Instructor Liang pick up such a treasure?\u2019 I doubt him,\u201d the instructor who spoke nudged his head, \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong here.\u201dAs they talked, someone came in. It was Xiao Jue and Cheng Li Su. Everyone immediately put down their chopsticks and stood up to salute \u201cGeneral Xiao, Noble Cheng.\u201d\u201cI heard you all were talking lively about something from afar\u2026 so, what were you laughing about?\u201d Cheng Li Su asked with a grin.This young man who was used to having a happy appearance happily ate and drank in Liang Zhou these past few days.\u00a0 Although they didn\u2019t know why the well-dressed and well-fed \u2018Noble of the Capital\u2019 wasn\u2019t at home with his good fortune, and instead came to Liang Zhou. Moreover, he was brought by Xiao Jue, so they must give him a bit of face and dare not neglect.The instructor who talked about Liang Ping at the beginning spoke first, \u201cWe were talking about the training of the recruits today. There is a recruit under Instructor Liang who can\u2019t even draw the bow and said that he would be able to draw it tomorrow. Master Cheng, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s funny?\u201d\u201cHey, he can\u2019t even draw the bow. Wouldn\u2019t he be worse than me?\u201d Cheng Li Su was shocked. He was already known as the weakest scholar and soldier among his brothers in his family. But he could definitely draw crossbows. He didn\u2019t expect to be able to meet someone weaker than him here, so he immediately became interested. He turned to look at Xiao Jue, \u201cUncle, did you hear that? At least in Liang Zhou, I am not the worst.\u201dXiao Jue glanced at him, but seemed to not care. After he got a cold response, he was not annoyed, but instead turned to several instructors, and enthusiastically asked, \u201cWhat is the name of that strong man, who shares the same aspects as me? I must meet him and become brothers with him.\u201dLiang Ping, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHey, Instructor Liang, what\u2019s the name of that recruit?,\u201d The instructor who spoke strained his memory and recalled, \u201cHe\u2026what was after that?\u201dWhat did he do wrong, why did God treat him like this? He was embarrassed in front of the General, Liang Ping wanted to cry a little, but under all the eyes, he bit the bullet and said, \u201cHe Yan.\u201dThe young man who had always been indifferent raised his eyes suddenly.He Yan?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why don\u2019t we go talk to Instructor Liang and ask him to make you a guerilla soldier? It doesn\u2019t sound very glamorous, but\u00a0 the life there is really good, isn\u2019t it, Mak?\u201d He nudged Mak with his elbow and gestured for Mak to say a few words as well.Mak followed and agreed, \u201cThat\u2019s right Brother He, even if you become a guerilla soldier, we\u2019ll still visit you often.\u201dHe Yan smiled but didn\u2019t say anything.Hong Shan was really anxious. Compared to his pampered and sometimes troublesome brother, He Yan was much more sensible. He was very understanding, so much so that he unconsciously started treating him as his own brother.He Yan couldn\u2019t even draw a bow, and if he went to war, he\u2019d be the first one to die. How could he idly stand by while his brother jumped into the fire pit?\u201cBrother Shan, don\u2019t worry about me, I\u2019ll be able to draw the bow tomorrow.\u201d She reassured him.\u201cDo you think you\u2019re a Spiritualist? That whatever you say will just come true?\u201d Hong Shan was furious, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t this child get the hang of it?\u201dInstead, Shi, who had been silent for a while, asked, \u201cDo you have any tricks?\u201dHe Yan shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m a person whose qualifications have never been good from the start. There are many things that I can\u2019t do, so I have no choice but to try a few more times. Once I try a few more times, I\u2019m pretty sure that I can make it.\u201d He Yan sighed.The world knew of General Feng Yun as a natural-born general and a genius. In fact, it could be considered miraculous \u2013 she was a woman, so her natural physical strength was weaker than that of a man. In other words, her current qualifications were definitely not good. It took her many years to turn He Yan into a brave and invincible general on the battlefield, but she was reborn once again and given such a weak body.It is true that \u201cwhen heaven is about to confer a great responsibility on any man, it will exercise his mind with suffering, subject his sinews and bones to hard work, expose his body to hunger, place his joy to poverty, place obstacles in the paths of his deeds, to stimulate his mind, harden his nature, and improve wherever he is incompetent\u201d. She didn\u2019t expect to become brilliant, but it would be fine to make herself as strong as Wang Ba.Accomplishing this will be a lot easier now as compared to the past!He Yan thought about it until night arrived.The new recruits were tired all throughout the day, so they naturally slept soundly at night, and snored incessantly. He Yan estimated the time and climbed up from the bed.Mak rolled over and muttered something. He Yan stopped for a while, but before he could wake up, she tiptoed and left the room through the door.She went straight to the practice field. It was empty, and the summer night winds gently blew the colored flags like quiet, dancing flowers. Under the moonlight, the greenery reflected the silent moonlight.The borders were always bitterly cold, so the situation in Liang Zhou was already considered good. This kind of calming, desolate scenery, she hadn\u2019t seen since she stationed troops in the past. For some time, she stood there in silence, as if she couldn\u2019t bear to tread any further on this quiet night.Some of the crossbows from the daytime had been taken in, which left only one or two, but those were not easy to move. The straw targets were all over the place, but tomorrow, new recruits wouldl tidy up the place after their morning run. He Yan walked over to the row of straw targets and searched for a long time, fumbling in the darkness for an arrow, until she found the right one that was beside her. She took the arrow and walked back to the crossbow.What a normal person could easily accomplish, would take her much longer. But she couldn\u2019t give up now. If she couldn\u2019t do it on the first try, she could only practice again and again with all her might.She tried to draw the bow, but it was too heavy; the string barely moved. It was really hard to notice if it was pulled or not.She put the bow down and rubbed her wrist.She picked up the bow and tried again, but it was still the same as before, no improvement at all.After five or six attempts, she finally got better. This time, she was able to draw the bow farther than before, and she could finally see that it was moving.He Yan sighed in relief.In fact, what she said to Instructor Liang before was not entirely true; she herself was not very confident, as Miss He hadn\u2019t been in contact with any heavy object since the past ten years. When she first arrived at the He family, she only chopped one piece of firewood, and her hand was already worn out. But at that time, the situation forced her to do so. If she couldn\u2019t draw the bow tomorrow, that\u2019s another matter. The worst-case scenario was to play coy with the instructor and fish out a few more chances.In this world, it\u2019s better to make an effort and fail than not to make any at all. She had no talent, so the only thing she had in her bag of skills was effort. But there is also something in this world that can\u2019t be obtained even if you work hard all your life, and that is the heart.She had sacrificed everything for the He family and dedicated all her love to Xu Zhi Heng. She had worked so hard but to no avail.He Yan\u2019s eyes drooped, her fingers clasped the bow to shoot an arrow. This arrow seemed to vent all her pain, making a rustle in the dark as it headed towards the straw targets.But the arrow didn\u2019t hit on the straw target and fell powerlessly halfway through. She was still too weak to draw the bow and shoot the arrow out.Not every pain could be vented to the fullest.He Yan smiled and got up to pick up the arrow. She started to walk towards the arrow when she suddenly noticed something and looked up. Ten paces away from her, a pair of brocade boots, embroidered with golden dark patterns were shining magnificently in the night.There was someone here? She was so focused on practicing the crossbow that she didn\u2019t even notice. He Yan straightened up and took a few steps forward so that the person standing in the night could be revealed.It turned out to be Xiao Jue.The practice field was so large and it was only illuminated by moonlight. He stood behind a straw target, dressed in dark clothes, so he was almost hidden in the dark.The handsome young man looked at her indifferently, without any intention to explain. He Yan felt a little wretched for no reason. She settled down and cleared her throat, deciding to pre-empt the situation.\u201cWho are you? What are you doing here?\u201d\u201cWatching you practice arrows.\u201dIt was clearly a cold tone, but He Yan distinctly heard a hint of sarcasm.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me practicing arrows? What do you think after watching it?\u201d He Yan asked.The beautiful young man restrained his eyebrows. His long eyelashes, under the moonlight, resembled butterfly wings, trembling tenderly, yet his tone was cold, with a bit of mockery.\u201cI\u2019m surprised that there are people who work so hard and are still so vulnerable.\u201dHe Yan was stunned.For a while, time and space seemed to overlap, and as the sound of the wind slowly faded away, the night stars spread out across the long sky. The figure of the young man in front of her gradually blurred into that of a teenager, whose voice fell to her ear, with a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and mockery:\u201cI didn\u2019t expect someone to work so hard and still be a weak chicken.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Did she really take another step forward on her path?All the students in Xian Chang Hall were children of noble families. Not only were they rich and powerful, but they also had a good family background. It was impossible to compare her family to those who were wealthy or relied on earldoms to live on. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that He Yuan Liang was a personal friend of her mentor, her mentor wouldn\u2019t have been able to place her down through the back door.On one hand, He Yan was very happy that she could enter Xian Chang Hall, but on the other hand, she was filled with misery about her daily life in Xian Chang Hall.There was no reason other than her grades, which were a bit too miserable compared to the other kids there.The He family had taught her to use men\u2019s etiquette and behaviour on the outside, but she hadn\u2019t learned much about the things inside. When she first arrived at the Xian Chang Hall, she was so ignorant that she was often at the butt of jokes and her tutor couldn\u2019t do anything about it.If she said her liberal arts were better\u2026\u00a0 It was because she had read and memorized a few more times, and listened attentively during lectures. She could barely get by with an average score. But when it came to martial arts, it was a total failure.Since He Yan was a child, she had been sneaking off to the back of the mountain to help the monks fetch water to practice her hand strength, and she thought she was decent enough, resulting in her first martial arts screening test in the Xian Chang Hall to become a spectacle.Be it bow, knife or stones, she wasn\u2019t qualified in any of them. She tried horse riding but fell down, and the arrows missed their target. Even the Instructor shook his head and sighed. The surrounding teenagers pointed at her and laughed. Someone said, \u201cYou aren\u2019t a woman, are you? How come you don\u2019t know anything? Are you usually at home learning to do embroidery?\u201dHe Yan panicked and stood up from the ground. Patting the dust off of her body, she thought to herself that if it went on, her identity would be disclosed. If anyone found out her identity, she would be taken back by Madam He and would have to stay at home again. She was not sure if she would be able to do that, but it was better to study and practise hard to stay safely in Xian Chang Hall.And hence He Yan embarked on the road of \u201cstudying hard\u201d.There was no such thing as chiselling the wall to steal the light[1], nor was there such a thing as the sacred firefly reflecting the snow[2], or smelling the rooster and dancing[3], neither was there such a thing as hanging the beams[4]. He Yan often cursed in her heart while practising calligraphy, horseback riding, archery, and also handling swords.She tried her best and could only struggle on the edge of her tail. So to her, the proud sons of heaven who could easily get the top spot without having to work hard seemed very dazzling.Xiao Jue was one of them, and the most annoying one.This young man was born a prodigy, but with a mind of a mule. He had a superior and refined family and had collected a lot of affection from people. He came to the academy every day but was often late to class. Sometimes he left early and usually didn\u2019t seem to pay much attention to the class. Yet he was always first in both liberal and martial arts.He Yan was confused. God had already given him the beauty and honourable status, why did he have to give him wisdom too? Couldn\u2019t he give some of it to her?God didn\u2019t answer He Yan, so she could only make up for her poor qualifications with tears in her eyes.Gradually, He Yan\u2019s \u201cSword, Horse, and Bow\u201d began to show results; though not as good as those youths who were accompanied by their parents and brothers to practice since childhood. Sometimes at their practice sessions, she could fight for the third to last place.He Yan felt satisfied working hard to gain something.When it was time for Xian Chang Hall martial arts division, which was at the back of the hall to distribute the weapons. He Yan chose a sword among the weapons. That sword, she felt, was lighter than other swords and less strenuous to wield.However, her swordsmanship was also a mess.The He family hadn\u2019t hired a martial arts master to teach her in the house alone, so He Yan had no foundation at all, even her horse stance was crooked. The instructors of Xian Chang hall had no hopes for her either. They only watched her and waited to see if she was able to defend herself. What kind of gentleman didn\u2019t bring a few servants with him?However, He Yan felt that it would not work.Since she had chosen, she should train her sword well. The students could only go home two days in January and lived the rest of the time in the Xian Chang hall. She sneaked out in the dark at night and went to the courtyard of the academy to practice her sword.The school was elegantly built. When the moonlight was good, the wind rustled the bamboo groves, the shadow of bamboo shoots and cypresses were cast by the moon and the pond was full of red carp. Experts practised their swords there, waiting for the world to change, and would appear whenever there was chaos.He Yan was quite happy to practice. If only she ignored her crappy swordsmanship.Like accidentally chipping off a corner of her clothes, accidentally hitting her head with the sword sheath, accidentally tripping\u2026She heard a soft chuckle.In the night, with that inexplicable chuckle, He Yan crawled up nervously. Did she see a ghost?She saw a person sitting on the stone bench in the small courtyard, wearing a white robe and brocade boots, with bright eyebrows. It was Xiao Jue, the proud son blessed by the heavens.When Xiao Jue looked down at her, she put her hands behind her back and vigorously wiped the sweat on her clothes. She calmly asked, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201cWatching you practice your sword.\u201d The young man replied lazily.\u201cWhat\u2026 What\u2019s there to see?\u201d She summoned the courage to answer. She had never been fond of talking to the teenagers in Xian Chang Hall. They didn\u2019t like her and were always bullying her.Xiao Jue looked at her for a moment and suddenly stood up. While she was caught off guard, the boy was already in front of her. She was a girl, born not as tall as a boy, so she could only reach up to the teenager\u2019s chest. She raised her head and could see the other\u2019s clear jawline, and those beautiful, gentle, slightly cool eyes like autumn water.\u201cIt was just a coincidence.\u201d The young man gently curled the corners of his lips. He was born with a heroic and beautiful appearance. With a smile, he was comparable to the cool night of the whole courtyard which was more moving than the moonlight. However, the words he uttered were ironic, \u201cSomeone is making so much effort but is still a weak chicken.\u201dHe Yan, \u201c\u2026\u201dShe shook Xiao Jue, picked up the sword, and ran away; her heart indignant. The heavens were fair. Giving that young man beauty, talent, and family background, but not a good heart.That person, she hated him!After that, He Yan still sneaked out to the courtyard every night to practice her sword, thinking that hard work made up for her clumsiness and effort was better than lack of it.But what made her angry was that Xiao Jue had followed her every night since that day. While she practised, he sat on a stone bench and read a book by candlelight. And while she fell face down and cut several pieces of her clothes, he watched her make a fool of herself with grace and elegance.While she was still trying to work hard to maintain the sprint away from the bottom, the other person didn\u2019t make any effort and was still top-notch.The one working hard still worked hard, the one relaxing still relaxed. Spring and autumn came and left, as did winter and summer. The teenager had grown into a youth, the girl\u2019s face changed. The only thing that remained unchanged was the night sky in the Xian Chang Hall and the crescent moon in the backyard at the end of the bamboo shoots.Glossary[1]\u00a0\u00a0Chiselling the wall to steal the light: Literally, it means that one works hard to bore a hole and steal some light from it\u2019s neighbour.

Looking at the picture alone, it was a beautiful scene.He Yan was silent.Xiao Jue spoke with a faint voice, \u201cYour name is He Yan?\u201dHe Yan was shocked and blurted out, \u201cI\u2019m already so famous?\u201dShe thought among the people in barracks; she was not good enough to alarm the general. How could even Xiao Jue know her?Xiao Jue sneered, \u201cThe last runner from the weight-bearing run, and a person who can\u2019t even draw the bow.\u201d He looked down at the top of He Yan\u2019s hair, condescendingly, and understated, \u201cStill so short, among the people in the barracks, I can\u2019t think of anyone else.\u201dHe Yan, \u201c\u2026\u201dSo\u2026short\u2026In an instant, she seemed to be back at the time when she first met Xiao Jue at Xian Chang Hall, and Xiao Jue gave her a character evaluation: stupid and short.Unexpectedly, after a change of body, Xiao Jue saw her, but he still said this? He was really as always, so arrogant, and unkind. Looking at him in this way, the indifference brought about by growing up into a young man, with the impression of excellence from almost a mean teenager.He Yan was naturally aggrieved too. To tell the truth, she cannot be called \u201cshort\u201d among women. Only in a barracks full of sturdy men, she appears weak as a chicken. But it\u2019s no wonder. When she was He Yan, she was a little taller than now, and after He Ru fei replaced her, others did not think that General Fei Hong was short. But now, she can\u2019t put cushions in her shoes to appear tall.While she was immersed in her thoughts, unpredictably Xiao Jue took another step closer, so the distance between her and her was a little too close.He Yan was stunned in place.His eyes were beautifully shaped, clear, and gentle. When he looked at her with his eyes downcast, it gave one the illusion, as if he was looking at a lover. His skin was also very white, more crystal clear than Miss He, and his eyebrows were more and more picturesque. The blue silk was tied up and hung on his shoulders. It also looks cool, with a hint of Yuelin fragrance. making people really want to touch it.He Yan thought to herself that the fairy riding the deer would turn around ashamed if she saw this person. It\u2019s no wonder why so many women in the capital\u2019s spring boudoir dreamed of this nobleman, facing him, one could never get tired of this face for a lifetime.\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d He asked indifferently.\u201cThinking about what I should eat to look as good as you.\u201d He Yan replied.His movements became stiff. He stopped making his way closer as if he had verified some results. He looked away and muttered: \u201cBoring.\u201dHe didn\u2019t even curse? He Yan was surprised. She thought that Xiao Jue was going to use out the military order to scold her, but it suddenly became clear to her that Xiao Jue hadn\u2019t identified her yet. Xiao Jue has not yet. According to common sense, she should not \u201cknow\u201d who he is, so she can only be like a stranger who accidentally bumped into her practicing in this area.\u201cWhat\u2019s so boring about it?\u201d He Yan blew out her forehead hair and said in a daunting voice, \u201cEveryone has a desire for beauty.\u201dXiao Jue paused and looked at her fixedly as if looking at a dead person. He Yan stared back fearlessly. He probably never had seen a person like her. Xiao Jue was also startled. After a while, he seemed to sneer, turned, and strode away, leaving He Yan alone in the practice field.He Yan discovered something.Xiao Jue\u2019s temperament is colder than before, but it is also better than before. In the past, when he became angry with her, he could sarcastically answer ten or eight sentences without repetition, but now he just glanced at her and didn\u2019t want to talk to her. She didn\u2019t dare to provoke Xiao Jue back then, but now the noble second son of the Xiao family disdains the tit-for-tat confrontation with others as she did when she was a child. Doesn\u2019t that mean she can casually piss Xiao Jue to death and avenge the damage he did to her heart back then?The Gods are fair, she thought, and came out with \u201cThe wheel of fortune is finally turning to my house.\u201dGood.\u2026After Xiao Jue left, He Yan pulled/draw the crossbow for another half an hour, and went back to sleep when her hands were so sore that she couldn\u2019t tolerate it. The next morning, she woke up a little later, and Mak pushed her,\u201cBrother he, get up.\u201dOnly then did He Yan opened her eyes.When it comes to human bodies, they are really different. When she was a teenager, no matter how late she practiced the sword secretly in the middle of the night, she could still go to listen to her husband\u2019s lecture the next day energetically. Now it\u2019s just a night, and it\u2019s not too late, but still, she felt exhausted all over.Could it be that her last life was really hard life, He Yan reflected on herself like this.Introspection returns to introspection, what should be done is still to be done. Today, as usual, she started running with sandbags. After running, everyone consciously went to the back of the practice field with the recruits in the team to prepare for the archery.The crossbow has been put up long ago, and the coolness of the night was gone in the daytime, and the daylight was a little dazzling. Instructor Liang stood beside the crossbow, and the recruits went to try the bows one by one. Compared with yesterday, the recruits were not so excited, and their technique was a lot more stable. There were fewer shots that resulted in the mess, at least they were all aimed at the target.Hong Shan also went to shoot, and he shot better than yesterday. Shi still won the praise of Instructor Liang. Although Mak\u2019s hand strength wasn\u2019t great, he was not very bad, and because Shi, his brother, was there to give him advice, he made significant progress.He Yan saw Wang Ba again.Wang Ba stepped forward unhurriedly, before drawing the bow, he even gave He Yan a contemptuous look. He Yan replied with a smile that seemed to irritate him. He immediately sank his face, drawing the bow and shooting arrows without thinking.With a \u201cswish\u201d, the feather arrow pierced the air and passed straight through the grass target. It was almost the same picture as yesterday. The grass target was taken forward and fell down.The recruits around immediately applauded. People here always worship the strong.Wang Ba put down his bow, walked to He Yan, and said aggressively, \u201cIt\u2019s your turn.\u201d He deliberately raised his voice so that everyone around could hear, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t draw your bow yesterday, in front of everyone you said you would be able to draw it today. Brother He Yan, let us see, how will you draw the bow, how about it?\u201dFor a moment, all eyes turned to He Yan.He Yan\u2019s name was almost known to the entire barracks. Everyone knows that there is a recruit under Instructor Liang, who can\u2019t even pull/draw the bow, and dares to speak ruthlessly. Seeing the real person at this moment, they all looked at He Yan, waiting to see what was going on.\u201cBrother He\u2026\u201d Mak timidly pulled the corner of her clothes.He Yan smiled at him and slowly walked out. She met Wang Ba\u2019s unkind smile, with an open expression and a humble tone, \u201cIt must be hard for brother to remember my words so clearly.\u201d\u201cYou want to see it so much, I\u2019ll let you see.\u201d She said lightly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She picked up the crossbow, took out an arrow from the quiver, and put her finger on it.Wang Ba looked at her with disdain and said, \u201cPut some effort into it, don\u2019t be like yesterday \u2013\u00a0 putting up a fight for half a day and then finally coming to say you can\u2019t pull it off.\u201dHe Yan behaved as if she hadn\u2019t heard him, but Hong Shan was a little nervous and sweated secretly for He Yan. These new recruits in the army were inherently strong, and according to him, He Yan was not a woman, so people would not have any thoughts of pitying him. They would only feel that he was weak, and the weak inherently didn\u2019t deserve sympathy, but if you add a trait of a person who likes to talk big, it would only make people look down on him even more, just like He Yan did yesterday. If he couldn\u2019t do it today, not only would the instructor secretly despise him, but in the future, the people in the barracks would be ashamed and wouldn\u2019t be friendly to him.Yesterday, he gave up without even drawing, but today will he be able to pull the bow?The young man gazed at the target of the arrow, and from this direction, his hand was extremely steady, his sinking eyes looked like those of a hunting beast, who was waiting quietly for the moment of leaping. The bow was drawn.Little by little, not easily, but slowly, without any trembling, it was pulled. Unlike yesterday, you could tell the bow was slowly opening up.\u201cIt\u2019s moving\u2026,\u201d Mak excitedly tugged on the corner of Shi\u2019s clothes, \u201cBrother, Brother He has drawn the bow!\u201dHe knew that If He Yan said he would be able to do it, he would do it \u2013\u00a0 it had been proven so for how many times?!Wang Ba was stunned at first, and then immediately felt angry at being hit in the face. He stood there with his teeth clenched as he wanted to see what kind of superb shooting skills He Yan could display. On the other side, Instructor Liang, who originally had no hopes, was also attracted by He Yan\u2019s actions.This kid could do it. Yesterday he said he could draw the bow today, and today he really did it. Could it be that yesterday he was playing with a pig and eating a tiger[1], and simply said he wouldn\u2019t, just to be in the limelight right now?In the midst of the discussion, the bow had been opened nearly halfway, and He Yan stopped moving, and did not continue to draw down any further.This was already her limit. She let go of her hand and the arrow steadily, swiftly went towards the target! The crowd couldn\u2019t stop their stares at the tail feathers of the arrow intently. The feathered-arrow headed towards the arrow target did not reach the target, and fell weakly in the middle. The watching crowd let out a regretful sigh, as if the arrow should have undoubtedly hit the center of the target.He Yan withdrew her hand.Mak was the first to jump out. He ran to He Yan\u2019s side, his eyes shining as he said, \u201cBrother He, you really drew the bow!\u201d\u201cRemarkable!\u201d Hong Shan also came over and patted He Yan\u2019s shoulder, \u201cThere you go!\u201dAlthough Shi didn\u2019t say anything, he smiled, showing that he was happy. Instructor Liang also gave He Yan an affirmative look.The surrounding recruits who watched the fun discussed the proceedings.\u201cHe really pulled it off, and it doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s lying.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s luck, it just happened to be a lucky pull.\u201d\u201cLuck is also a form of strength, and he did what he said, not bad.\u201dWang Ba was a bit confused.He had come to watch He Yan make a fool of himself, how come in the end, it was as if he made He Yan the center of attention. He looked at the arrow that had fallen in the middle \u2013\u00a0 He Yan hadn\u2019t even hit the target\u2019s edge. This would be considered a very poor result if done by anyone else, so why did the people here clap and celebrate for him?Did he make a mistake?\u00a0Wang Ba was unconvinced, \u201cIsn\u2019t it just drawing the bow? There are many men in this barrack that can pull the bow. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s all but you. Where\u2019s the greatness?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d He Yan pointed at herself and laughed, \u201cBut I\u2019m the exception that can\u2019t pull it, I couldn\u2019t pull a day ago, and a day later I did, that\u2019s called amazing.\u201dShe curled her eyebrows and laughed happily. This smile fell in Wang Ba\u2019s eyes, and it turned his heart over in anger. He said, \u201cI\u2019m not convinced!\u201d\u201cWhat are you dissatisfied with?\u201d He Yan asked.Wang Ba was a bully who worshipped the strong and despised the weak. He looked at people who were \u2018frail\u2019 like He Yan with a bad eye. In addition, there was a history of bad blood between him and He Yan, so he was unhappy that he didn\u2019t find something wrong with He Yan.\u201cHow can someone like you become a recruit and train with us?\u201d Wang Ba turned to Instructor Liang, \u201cInstructor Liang, I\u2019m not convinced!\u201dInstructor Liang looked at them without moving a muscle as he did not intend to intervene. He was the instructor, not their superior. After this batch of new recruits were trained here, they might be stationed at the Liang Zhou Guard, or they might follow Xiao Jue to other places, but they were not his people anyway. His duty was simply to teach them basic skills, pick some good seedlings, and at the end of the line, it was all up to the generals.Who would want to lose Wang Ba who was very talented with a crossbow for a He Yan who didn\u2019t look particularly good?\u201cYou don\u2019t need to embarrass Instructor Liang.\u201d He Yan took one look at Liang Ping and knew what he was thinking. The instructor here was very cunning. There must be trade-offs at times like this. She looked at Wang Ba, \u201cTell me what you want.\u201dWang Ba sarcastically smiled, \u201cYou go and be the guerilla soldier.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d He Yan refused without further thought, \u201cOn what grounds?\u201d\u201cOn what grounds?\u201d Wang Ba, \u201cJust because you couldn\u2019t pull the bow yesterday, even if you pulled the bow today, you shot so poorly and your friends actually cheered for you. In the future, when it comes to the battlefield, will all the soldiers and generals be like you, with their crossbows in disarray, unable to kill a single enemy, and still need someone to cheer for them? What kind of soldier is this!?!\u201dWow,\u00a0He Yan couldn\u2019t help but applaud Wang Ba in her heart. It was said that the big old bandits were poor in literature, now it seemed that they placed their words rightly. When she had just entered the barracks, she was not so eloquent yet she was worthy of being the leader in the mountain. If she couldn\u2019t bluff, how could she be the boss?Fortunately, she had been in the barracks for so many years, and it was not that she had never seen this battle.\u201cYes, you\u2019re right.\u201d The young man brushed away a lock of hair that had fallen on his forehead and paused before he spoke, \u201cBut as you can see, yesterday I couldn\u2019t pull the bow, but today I can. Yesterday you shot this target with arrows, and today you still did the same.\u201dThe crowd looked at her, not understanding what she meant by that.\u201cI\u2019m getting stronger day by day, but you\u2019re just the same after a day. In this case, ten days later, I can hit the straw target, but you, you will still be the same, hitting the straw target just as before.\u201d\u201cIn ten days, I will win over you.\u201d She said as she punctuated every word.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sunlight gleamed in his eyes like shining gems.For a split second, Wang Ba actually doubted himself.Startled by his own suspicion, he secretly spat at himself for being frightened by a bratty kid. He had lived most of his life, was he still no match for a weak chicken-like brats? A yellow-mouth kid[1], tongue-tied, self-righteous and reckless!He snorted coldly, \u201cHe Yan, do you have any idea what you are talking about right now?\u201d\u201cDo you want me to repeat it again?\u201d The boy said with a smile, \u201cSince you have bad ears, I\u2019ll say it again. In ten days, I will defeat you.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Wang Ba clenched his fists.\u201cBrother He is crazy\u2026\u201d Hong Shan muttered. Wang Ba\u2019s crossbow shooting skills were evident to everyone. Although He Yan had improved a little bit from yesterday,\u00a0 being able to hit the target with a single arrow, that wasn\u2019t something that could be practiced in just ten days!It was understandable that a young man could be angry and put down harsh words, but what if he goes too far and it backfires later?\u201cWhat will you do, if you can\u2019t beat me after ten days?\u201d Wang Ba said as he bit his molars. He decided not to grind his lips with this young man. He Yan was thick-skinned. If you ridiculed him, he might not take such a thing too seriously.\u201cIf I can\u2019t beat you, I\u2019ll be a guerilla soldier.\u201d He Yan replied quickly, \u201cBut if you can\u2019t beat me\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be a guerilla soldier!\u201d Wang Ba said loudly.\u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d He Yan shook his head, \u201cEven if I want you to be such a soldier, Instructor Liang will definitely not agree.\u201d She looked at Liang Ping intentionally.Liang Ping thought about it in his heart, \u201c\u2026\u201dEvil, how could this kid know what he was thinking? Wang Ba had such a good qualification, if he volunteered to be a guerilla soldier, the head instructor would kill him!\u201cThen say it!\u201d Wang Ba said impatiently.In He Yan\u2019s mind, she suddenly went back to the past when she was a youngster in Xian Chang Pavilion, where the teenagers loved to gamble. As the number one in Xian Chang Hall, Xiao Jue was entangled and challenged many times when he was young. What did he say at that time? She remembered the time when that young man had slept on the rocks in the academy. He was woken up and sat up annoyed. He lazily said to the classmate who came to challenge him in horse riding and bow and arrow, \u201cFine, if I lose, I will do what you want. But, If you lose,\u201d he hooked his lips, \u201cYou will have to call me Father.\u201dHe Yan pondered upon, and felt that the scene now was very similar to the previous one.But she couldn\u2019t let Wang Ba call her Dad.\u201cWell, I heard that you are acquainted with the leaders in the mountains and you\u2019re their boss. If I beat you, that would mean my ability is above yours. You will need to call me Boss in the future. How about it?\u201d she said.This request was really unheard of.Everyone looked at He Yan, who was not as tall as Wang Ba, whose arms were as thin as firewood, and then looked at Wang Ba who was tall and big, with fists bigger than He Yan\u2019s face, as he stood there silently.\u201cYour ambition is apparently not small.\u201d Wang Ba stared at He Yan with a deadly grin.\u201cTo be honest, before I joined the army, I also thought about falling into the grass and being a bandit.\u201d He Yan looked very grateful.She had run away from the He family back then. As she carried her baggage at night, she hesitated several times at the gate of the city, and even more between the two roads. One way was to go directly to the south, and the other was to go west and join the Fu Yue army. If she chose to become a bandit, she would live a life of being free and uncontrollable, but, in case the harvest failed and no one passed by, they would have no option but to starve. Some officials came out to suppress bandits, so they would often have to hide, which was not very respectable.Although it was a bit harder to join the army, the soldiers got to eat royal food, also it saved one\u2019s face.However, neither of them accept women, so she has to pretend to be a man in disguise. Thanks to her ability to act like a boy since she was a child, she was able to rise up step by step.When she thought about it now, she sighed.As He Yan reminisced about the past, Wang Ba was even angrier. This kid in front of him seemed to be only fifteen or sixteen years old, so why did he look\u00a0 so mature? He was reminiscing his past however, did he even have a past to miss about?\u201cAlright.\u201d He tried to keep his anger from cutting off the boy\u2019s head, and squeezed\u00a0 a few words from his teeth, \u201cIf you want to be the boss, it depends on whether you have the ability.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d He Yan arched her hands towards the nearby recruits, \u201cI\u2019d like to ask all you to bear a witness to this gambling agreement. In any case, we will see the result here in ten days! Good luck to myself!\u201d She snapped her fingers and felt at ease. They didn\u2019t know if she really was talented, or had any tricks in her hands, but she looked so sure that she would be the one to win.Wang Ba left angrily.Mak and Hong Shan rushed up to He Yan. The rest gradually dispersed. Occasionally, a few of them watched He Yan with a complex expression of admiration and sympathy.They probably all agreed that He Yan would become a guerilla soldier.Liang Ping glanced at He Yan, shook his head, and left while sighing as he walked. Young people were just impulsive and did not consider the consequences, but\u2026 why was he still a little excited when he thought about it?\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Within half a day, the entire Liang Zhou Wei knew about this bet between Wo Yan and Wang Ba.People in the barracks started to make bets themselves, but all of them had little money. They were so poor that they used the dry bread distributed in the barracks to make bets. If Wang Ba loses, one would lose ten, and if He Yan loses, one would lose two.In the past few days, there were a lot fewer people who ate dry bread. After all, it was not easy to find something fun to do with training all day long.Cheng Li Su walked into the room and changed into a brand-new yellow robe with a red koi embroidered on the corners of the robe, which was vivid and lovely. As soon as he came in, he yelled at the young man who sat at the table, \u201cUncle, do you know that the barracks are talking about the crossbow agreement ten days from now?\u201dXiao Jue didn\u2019t look away from the book. \u201cI know.\u201dThe entire barracks knew that there was a weak boy who wanted to be the boss of the bandits and a good archer who wanted to drive the opponent to become a guerilla soldier. What a strange pair.\u201cNow people are even placing bets on them, and I plan to place bets as well, are you coming?\u201d Cheng Li Su squeezed in front of Xiao Jue and asked him cheerfully.\u201cCheng Li Su,\u201d Xiao Jue put down the book in his hand and looked at him calmly, \u201cAre you going to gamble in the barracks?\u201dIt was clearly a flat tone, but Cheng Li Su shuddered. He hurriedly raised his hands up. \u201cNo, no, not me. It was made by someone else, and I don\u2019t want to bet money. At most a few dry loaves of breads, to pass the time and have fun! Uncle, I\u2019m still a child, and it\u2019s normal to play peaches and shoot willows![2]\u201dXiao Jue hummed, \u201cPlaying things will lose one\u2019s will.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have ambitions in the first place, so what can I lose?\u201d Cheng Li Su answered confidently.Xiao Jue couldn\u2019t answer this.\u201cUncle, if you don\u2019t want to go, I will bet by myself. If I don\u2019t have dry bread, I will bet with them with my jerky. It\u2019s not too much money.\u201d He said cheerfully and started to walk out.\u201cWho are you betting on?\u201d He heard Xiao Jue\u2019s voice as soon as he walked to the door.As Xiao Jue has always been uninterested in these things, Cheng Li Su was surprised for a moment, but still answered obediently, \u201cOf course it is the king! Isn\u2019t that Brother He Yan as useless as I am?\u201dXiao Jue twitched the corner of his mouth, \u201cI advise you to change your bargaining chip.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate an idiot who works hard,\u201d the young man looked down. As if he recalled someone, his long eyes looked like autumn water making ripples, \u201cThe last idiot I had seen, became a third-rank military commander.\u201d[1] an ignorant youth[2] playing peach: playing ball, because it is spherical like a peach;shooting willow: shooting willow branches with an arrow.

He Yan remembered that the last time she was so noticeable was when General Fei Hong was rewarded by the court for his victory.Although the situation was quite different now, she was still well known.\u201cThose people are too much!\u201d Mak returned from the outside, dissatisfied, \u201cI heard that people who bet on Brother He could be counted with one hand. It\u2019s like they are sure that Brother He won\u2019t win!\u201d\u201cThis is just a normal choice for people.\u201d Hong Shan said while he supported his forehead.Originally, the recruits have been unable to do anything except drills every day. But, thanks to He Yan, once this happened, there was a lot of fun and laughter everywhere, as if they came to the city of Beijing.\u201cMy eldest brother and I are also going to join in the fun, so to give Brother He a little momentum, we also betted on Brother He.\u201d Mak looked at He Yan, pleased, and said, \u201cBrother He, aren\u2019t we very loyal?\u201dBefore He Yan had time to speak, Hong Shan asked first. \u201cHow many loaves of bread did you bet on?\u201d\u201cOne piece for me and my big brother.\u201d\u201cOne piece\u2014\u201d Hong Shan deliberately lengthened his voice, \u201cThen how much did you bet for the king?\u201d\u201cTen pieces,\u201d Mak answered without even thinking about it. After he recovered and met He Yan\u2019s gaze, he blushed and stammered, \u201cNo, no, we thought of winning a few more pieces of bread so that we could share it together. If Brother He loses, we won\u2019t be\u2026 able to fill our stomachs\u2026\u201d The more he talked, the lower his voice became, and finally, he didn\u2019t dare to speak as he looked at He Yan pitifully.He Yan was surprised, \u201cWhere did you get the ten dry loaves of bread?\u201dWouldn\u2019t one only be to save a single piece a day?\u201cOn credit\u2026\u201dHe Yan was amazed at the fact that they could still use credit and thought that it was still a big gambling game, not just a small mess.She spoke earnestly to Mak, \u201cMak, you\u2019d better quickly withdraw the king\u2019s bet, ten pieces of dry bread. If you plan to starve for ten days, would you be able to endure it?\u201dHong Shan had a headache: \u201cBother He, you have to be reasonable, now is not the time to get angry.\u201dHe Yan, \u201c\u2026What should I say so that you guys will believe that I am not angry?\u201dHow they refused to believe it was almost written on their faces.He Yan had no choice but to stand up and say, \u201cThen I will go out to practice first,\u201d as she left the room.\u201cHuh.\u201d Mak sighed sadly.\u201cHuh.\u201d Hong Shan joined him.Shi watched them silently without a sound, and then quietly sighed as well.A gloomy cloud floated in the room.\u2026This bet with Wang Ba was only the beginning of He Yan\u2019s fame.These days, people could hear He Yan\u2019s name wherever they went.\u201cHave you heard? The recruit named He Yan under Instructor Liang is crazy!\u201d\u201cI know, the one who bet with Wang Ba that he\u2019d compete with the crossbow in ten days, isn\u2019t he crazy for betting?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s even crazier now, and instead of practicing his crossbow properly during the day, he\u2019s throwing stone locks! He doesn\u2019t even try to shoot the arrows.\u201d\u201cThen he must be insane.\u201dHe Yan threw stone locks in the open space. When everyone trained with the crossbow during the daytime, many people watched her, as she simply stopped practicing the crossbow. She even asked the instructor to borrow a big stone lock and started to throw it for fun, as if she didn\u2019t have anything to do.She had to increase her strength.To make the best use of the crossbow, of course, she needed enough strength to draw the bow to its full extent. In the past, when she was in the barracks, there was a man under her command who used to be a street performer. He learned to play with the stone lock since he was a child and was able to play with them in a variety of ways, such as catching lotus leaves, fanning beams, chopping, fighting, covering the roof with snowflakes, and taking off the robe of the God of Guan.That same man was also an excellent archer. Not only did he have a good aim, but other people couldn\u2019t even draw the bow as full as he could. And unlike anyone else, he could fully use the power of the crossbow. He Yan once practiced arm strength together with him. The two of them threw stone locks at each other while they moved around and dodged them. This method resulted in the development of their arm strength, wrist strength, hand strength, and waist strength.But now, no one was there to throw against her. She wanted to practice her arm strength first, so that she would be able to draw the bow to its full extent.Practicing stone locks was a much faster method in order to grow in strength than drawing a bow. In the daytime, He Yan threw stone locks, and at night, after everyone was asleep, she sneaked to the practice field. Fortunately, there were always one or two bows left in the practice field, which allowed her to practice secretly. Since the last time she saw Xiao Jue, she came back at night and did not continue to encounter him.Although she was not afraid of the presence of Xiao Jue, whenever he noticed that she practiced secretly at night, she always felt a vague embarrassment. It made her look back to the time when she was clumsy and had to work hard every night before she could sprint to \u201cthird from the bottom\u201d.This was probably the humiliation of the despisement by the proud son of heaven!She had already gotten rid of this humiliation, but who knew that God, by mistake, would make her feel it all over again.How can she make God take her more seriously?She practiced daily, and it was these brothers around her who understood the least.\u201cBrother He,\u201d Hong Shan hesitated, \u201cNo matter how well you draw the bow, you can\u2019t beat the king.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ve been keeping an eye out for Wang Ba for you every day, he can hit the center of the target every time, and he barely ever missed.\u201d Mak followed.\u201cWang Ba is a good archer,\u201d He Yan said, \u201cHe should be good at hurting people with bows and arrows. It seems that he\u2019s even more skilled than Shi.\u201dShi nodded. After a look at He Yan\u2019s opponent\u2019s skill, he had to admit that he himself was no match.\u201cThen Brother He, why don\u2019t you practice arrows every day?\u201d Mak was even more puzzled. \u201cYou should shoot a few times at least and practice your aim a few times as well. What if the feather arrows fly into the woods?\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d He Yan said.Mak stared at him, \u201cCould it be\u2026\u201dDid He Yan have any secret magic weapon?He Yan laughed. She didn\u2019t have any secret magic weapon. She just used the time when other people slept to practice arrows. She drew her bow daily and shot arrows under the moonlight, and day by day, the bow was drawn better, which was very effective, and the accuracy of archery did not regress. It was a blessing in misfortune.\u201cI just have a terrible aptitude compared to a normal person.\u201d She thought about it for a while and said seriously, \u201cBut I am very lucky. You have to believe that even if I don\u2019t practice arrows, as long as I can draw the bow open and full when the time comes, the arrow will fly to the target by itself like it has eyes.\u201dEveryone looked at He Yan who smiled, and the same thought flashed through their minds.He Yan really was crazy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Most people bet that Wang Ba will win, while a small number of people supported He Yan\u2019s side. Occasionally, when people pass by, they could hear the people who supported He Yan argue with the other side, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with He Yan? To do something he knows he can\u2019t, he\u2019s truly a great man!\u201dAccidently, He Yan also heard it.However, no matter what they say, the bets were the best way to see what people truly desired. The number of loaves of bread betted on He Yan\u2019s win were only three, one from each Mak, Shi, and Hongshan.In addition, to He Yan\u2019s surprise, an unknown person actually betted on He Yan\u2019s win with ten pieces of beef jerky.\u201cWho is such a generous person?\u201d Mak thought hard, \u201cHe has bet so many treasures on Brother He,so he must be very wealthy.\u201d\u201cNot only wealthy but also very discerning.\u201d\u00a0Finally, a wise man in the barracks,\u00a0He Yan thought.Hong Shan glanced at He Yan, \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that his brain is broken.\u201d\u201cBrother Shan, you can\u2019t say that. This person must appreciate Brother He so he secretly supported him. If I had this much jerky, I would have also bet on Brother He.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only a small bet, don\u2019t be so serious.\u201d He Yan poured the water in the jug and stood up, \u201cI\u2019ll go to the practice field later, so get up and move around first.\u201dShi asked, \u201cAre you really up to it?\u201d His eyes were full of doubt.\u201cAs I\u2019ve said, I\u2019ve had good luck every time.\u201d He Yan smiled.When she arrived at the practice field, she found that it was already surrounded by a few people. Someone saw her coming\u00a0 and shouted, \u201cHe Yan is here!\u201d Suddenly, a large crowd of people rushed over.\u201cWhere is he? Where is he?\u201d\u201cHe really didn\u2019t run away, he really came!\u201d\u201cQuickly, are you all ready with your dry loaves of bread?\u201dHe Yan, \u201c\u2026\u201dThis kind of starry-eyed treatment, really made one a little uncomfortable. Instructor Liang looked at him coldly. Originally, private gambling in the barracks was strictly forbidden, but because they used dry cakes\u2013 and it was such a unique situation\u2013 that even the chief Instructor did not intend to stop. So, Liang Ping did not add any more beaks1. Besides, he himself was enthusiastic and wanted to follow along to see what the result was.After all, people are more or less good gamblers in their blood.He Yan just walked over and saw a young man who wore licorice yellow clothes and stood next to Liang Ping. The young man had red lips and white teeth, and he looked very familiar. He Yan felt that she had probably seen him somewhere, so she looked over at him.Seeing that she looked over him, the young man showed a big smile, walked over, and enthusiastically said, \u201cSo you are He Yan!\u201dHas this person also come to see her specially? However, as she looked at the young man\u2019s clothes, he did not look like a recruit in the barracks, much less like an Instructor, and he was no different from the children of the noble family of the capital.\u201cI have heard about you a long ago, and I admire you very much! I\u2019d like to worship you so we will be brothers from now on. How about it?\u201dHe Yan was baffled. This person came up and worshipped her to become her brother. She still didn\u2019t know what his name or surname was.Instructor Liang stepped forward and smiled at the yellow-clothed boy, \u201cMaster Cheng, the governor wants you to stay away from the crossbow.\u201dXiao Jue? He Yan suddenly remembered where she had seen this boy. She was in the academy yard with He Yun Sheng and secretly tried to teach Young Master Zhao a lesson, which made him angry and he turned his anger to his horse. He wanted to kill the horse in the streets, but was stopped by Xiao Jue. At that time, it was this guy who walked alongside Xiao Jue. The little master with a rare stature.Huh? Did he follow Xiao Jue to Liang Zhou?\u201cUncle is just too much, what does it matter? It\u2019s not like the arrows are going to hit me.\u201d The boy muttered a few words and obediently stepped back.Uncle? He Yan was even more surprised. Is this boy Xiao Jue\u2019s nephew? But the Xiao family has only two sons and no other daughters, so what kind of relationship was it?Before He Yan could think clearly, she heard a familiar voice, \u201cYou are here!\u201dIt was Wang Ba.Hehad also made full preparations for today. He had already taken off his red shirt. He only wore a red coat, shirtless, with a long red belt tied to his forehead, as if he was about to fight in the ring.His voice was very loud, and she heard that the brothers in the tent last night gave him all the food so he could fight with his full energy today.He walked over to the crossbow, stood with He Yan, and looked at her provocatively, \u201cTen days have passed, the time for you to fulfill the agreement has arrived.\u201d\u201cI remember, you don\u2019t have to say it so loudly.\u201d He Yan pulled on her ears, \u201cYou first.\u201dWang Ba snorted, approached He Yan, and said in a low voice, \u201cYou still have time to beg for mercy?\u201d\u201cThat is exactly what I want to say to you.\u201d He Yan replied unhurriedly.\u201cI think you are looking for death!\u201d Wang Ba sneered and stepped forward., \u201cHe Yan doesn\u2019t dare to go first, so I\u2019ll go instead!\u201dWhispers filled the crowd. He Yan shrugged and stood aside. Hong Shan asked him in a low voice, \u201cAh He, are you nervous?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not nervous.\u201d He Yan felt helpless, patted Hong Shan, who was nervous one. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to be scared anymore.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll play too well\u2026\u201dIn fact, Wang Ba performed very well every day, but in her mind, there was no such thing as \u201ctoo good\u201d. He took one step forward and set up the crossbow, fingers clasped with arrows. Because of this bet with He Yan, Wang Ba practiced bow more diligently every day, and He Yan could feel that his strength had improved compared to ten days ago, and his archery felt calmer than before.The arrow aimed at the direction of the grass target. The sun was covered by clouds, and it gave a brief breeze. Wang Ba took a deep breath and suddenly released his fingers.In everyone\u2019s sight, the arrow hit the bullseye firmly and brought the target down.The result was very stable, and as fruitful as Wang Ba\u2019s daily archery training, it was not easy to maintain such archery skills.A glimmer of satisfaction flashed in Liang Ping\u2019s eyes. No matter what the result today would be, Wang Ba was an excellent seedling. Such a person should be taken seriously even under other instructors.Wang Ba clapped his hands, put the crossbow back, walked to He Yan\u2019s side, with a triumphant smile. \u201cHow about it, it\u2019s your turn now?\u201dHe Yan smiled and turned around.\u201cHere it comes!\u201d Cheng Li Su craned his neck excitedly and muttered to himself in a low voice, \u201cBrother He Yan, I put ten pieces of jerky on you. Although it\u2019s not a big deal, it\u2019s a piece of the young master\u2019s heart. Don\u2019t let me down!\u201dHe Yan didn\u2019t know that she still carried Cheng Li Su\u2019s ten pieces of jerky. From the moment she walked to the side of the crossbow, the chattering stopped, and all eyes fell on her.This kid, did he just talk big? Or did he really have the skills?However, there were too few things in the world that could be considered miracles. Except for a few people who expect miracles to happen, most people were just there to watch for jokes.He Yan picked up the crossbow.1He didn\u2019t want to stop it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The clouds dispersed to let the blazing sun shine on her face. A drop of sweat slowly rolled down her forehead.Beads of sweat almost rolled into her eyes, and made the people nervous for no reason, and even more wanted to reach out and brush the drops of sweat away. But the young man remained motionless, like a stone statue, without any sensation. His eyes didn\u2019t waver at all.The bow was slowly pulled apart, partly, then in half, until it was full. The hearts of the crowd also lifted, and when they were about to suspect that the bow was going to be pulled off in the next moment, the young man stopped his hand, unprepared, and let go of the hand that held the arrow.The arrow was like a shooting star that pierced the night sky, and with a gust of wind, it rushed rampantly towards the straw target, and it\u00a0 fell down with a\u00a0bang!\u00a0And this time, the arrow target was brought even farther down, making one not able to see the arrow clearly.She had shot the arrow target down, as had Wang Ba.Someone screamed out in shock.Eleven days ago, He Yan stood here, unable to even pull her bow, and ten days ago, though He Yan pulled her bow, it was but a small part here. Now her bow was perfectly drawn, and she even shot the target down. Her strength improved considerably in these ten days.But He Yan wasn\u2019t a prodigy, so how could something like strength grow with the wind?\u201cBrother He is awesome!\u201d Mak called up, laughed and jumped, \u201cBrother He won!\u201d\u201cWhat win?\u201d A recruit who had bet on Wang Ba \u2014 distressed about his dry piece of bread\u2013 was unconvinced, \u201cJust because he hit the target doesn\u2019t mean he hit the center of the arrow, and if he doesn\u2019t,it means he lost!\u201dHe reminded the audience that this was not a show to see how well He Yan could pull the bow. He was too thin and weak, but they were so surprised by the growth of his arm strength that they forgot to look at his accuracy.\u201cI\u2019ll go check!\u201d Someone volunteered to run to the target.Wang Ba looked at He Yan, the teenager stood against the blazing sun with lips full of smiles\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s this smile again. From the beginning when he met him he was like this, he didn\u2019t seem not worried at all, always so ready to teach people with obnoxious confidence.But\u2026 Wang Ba looked at his own hand, why was he even a little shaken?He was an orphan with no father or mother, taken by wolves when he was a child. When someone rescued him from the wolf\u2019s den, he was still on the mother wolf for milk. He had been a bandit for many years, and countless birds and animals had died under his arrow. He could shoot well because he had touched the bow since he was seven years old, and now, it\u2019s been more than twenty years.This little kid was only fifteen or sixteen. Even if he had touched a bow when he was young, it would only be a dozen years, so how could he be as good as him? What\u2019s more, ten days ago, it didn\u2019t look like He Yan pretended when he couldn\u2019t draw a bow, so it couldn\u2019t that a familiar hand had played with a crossbow since childhood.Thinking, Wang Ba steadied his nerves and soothed his faintly restless heart: He Yan must be no match for him.The man who had taken the initiative to look for the target arrived. First, he lowered his head to look at the target, and did not reply for a long while. Then, he suddenly crouched down, picked up the arrow target, and ran back.The arrow target, which was just a straw man, was carried easily, and he quickly ran forward and flung the target to the ground, and said loudly, \u201cEveryone see for yourself!\u201dWang Ba\u2019s heart thudded violently.Everyone looked towards the straw man, but they saw that the center of the straw man was pierced through to the end by a feathered arrow, steadily and impartially, right in the heart.It was exactly the same as Wang Ba\u2019s.Sweat ran down Wang Ba\u2019s forehead. The shocked discussion of the surrounding people seemed to fade away, and he saw Liang Ping staring at He Yan in amazement, and the brocaded young gentleman beside Liang Ping was also filled with joy. He Yan stood beside his friend, but he didn\u2019t look much surprised, just smiling lightly as if he had already expected everything.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dHe Yan smiled, \u201cAccepted.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t win against me.\u201d Wang Ba threw him a deadly stare, \u201cYou and I have the same result, how can you be considered to win over me, at most\u2026 at most it\u2019s a draw.\u201dAs they both shot the grass target down and also shot the grass target right in the middle, it was really hard to tell a winner from a loser. For Wang Ba, such a result was expected. But He Yan was different, he just went from loser to impressive.After she heard Wang Ba\u2019s words, He Yan wasn\u2019t exasperated, so she didn\u2019t even argue with Wang Ba, but nodded her head and said, \u201cI think so too.\u201dIn Wang Ba\u2019s heart, he was actually relieved. It would be good to acknowledge the draw, at least\u2026 at least he didn\u2019t lose. Those recruits also wiped the sweat from their foreheads. Who would have thought that in the end He Yan would hit the target? If it wasn\u2019t a draw, they would have lost their dry breads in vain. A draw was good, a draw was just right, no one would lose or win, and they were entitled to watch a different kind of fun.In the next moment, the celebration in the hearts of the crowd was shattered by the words of He Yan.She just took a pause and said, \u201cI made a bet with you on that day that I will win today. Now that the winner is yet to be decided, it\u2019s natural that we will compete until I win over you.\u201d\u201cHe Yan!\u201d Wang Ba gritted his teeth. What does that mean? Was he certain that he would win? What was this kid saying? What does he want?Liang Ping also stared at He Yan unexpectedly.\u201cFor the crossbow, you can propose a contest as you like, and I will accompany you until I win, how about it?\u201d A smirk crept up on her face.\u201cAren\u2019t you thinking too highly of yourself?\u201d Wang Ba stared at her coldly.\u201cI don\u2019t think too highly of myself, I just believe in my luck.\u201d She blew her shredded hair on her forehead with little concern, \u201cYou know, luck favors those who are prepared.\u201d And she, all the time, was prepared.\u201cIs that what you\u2019re saying, a casual crossbow competition?\u201d Wang Ba slowly asked back.\u201cA thousand times true.\u201d\u201cFine.\u201d The scarred man nodded, took his huge crossbow, and started to walk off the stage,\u00a0 turning his back to her, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of shooting a dead straw target? On the battlefield, the enemy won\u2019t stand still and wait for you to shoot. If you really want to shoot an arrow, shoot at a living thing, and the birds and beasts are just in time for practice.\u201dIt turned out the challenge was to become a predator.The crowd stood dumbfounded. To shoot at living things was much harder than shooting at a target. As the old saying goes, \u201cA hundred steps to pierce the Yang,\u201d[1] and a straw target was not as agile as a living thing.\u201cBrother He, you can\u2019t fall for his trap, don\u2019t promise him!\u201d Hong Shan hurriedly gave He Yan a straight look.When He Yan looked at Wang Ba, her eyes flashed with admiration, and she nodded, her voice cheerful.\u201cOkay.\u201d[1] pierce a willow leaf with an arrow from the distance of a hundred paces; hit the target at every shot; One can hit virtually any target within a hundred steps.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Having had the experience of several times before, he knew that this youth can't be empty talk big words, since promised, at least should be not bad.What can he shoot?\"If you want to shoot wild things, go into the woods.\" It's a bully. Lin Zi is on the white moon mountain. He looks at Liang Ping. Liang Ping takes back his thoughts and shakes his head and says, \"no way.\"Wang Ba and he Yan are both new recruits. They have never been to Baiyue mountain and are not familiar with the way of Baiyue mountain. The recruits will have to wait for some time before they enter the mountain. They can't do it now. He said, \"take the bird as the target.\"Birds The recruits were surprised. If wild animals are more difficult than grass targets, birds are more difficult than wild animals. People on the ground, birds in the sky, the natural distance is different. And shooting from the ground to the sky requires more eyesight and arm strength.Wang Ba burst out laughing, \"OKHe Yan also said with a smile: \"no problem.\"Both of them agreed so lightly, but let the recruits who had just calmed down were excited again. It seems that Wang Ba often shoots birds and wolves up the mountain. What about Heyan?Wheat quietly pulled the corner of the stone's coat, \"big brother, do you say that ahoga can win?\"\"I don't know.\" Stone answered.Wheat surprised to see his big brother, stone did not have a negative. Does it mean that he Yan could have hit it?\"You go get the bow.\" Liang Ping said that he called another recruit, and didn't know what to do. The new soldier listened to coach Liang's orders and turned around to find a gong on the shelf of the arena. He took the gong and ran to the woods not far away.A moment later, \"Dong\" a sound, he in the sound of a hard knock on the Gong, only heard a burst of \"fluttering edge\" sound, startled countless wild birds.There are many wild birds in Baiyue mountain. Last time, he Yan saw white bellied blue swallow and green pearl sparrow. The wild birds quickly flew into the sky. In a moment, Wang Ba immediately arched with his bow. He was skillful in his movements. He was determined to have a relaxed attitude towards the birds in the mountains and forests.The arrows flew up into the sky, and the birds in the flock seemed to be hit by something and fell down. In the martial arts arena, people exclaimed: \"shot! I got it The recruit picked up the arrow on the ground with a crimson arrow.This is Wang BA's prey.Wang Ba looks at Heyan with pride.He Yan laughs and points his bow at the sky. She moves faster than Wang Ba, which makes people wonder whether she is aiming at her prey. However, the arrow has already flown out. The sun is so huge that it blurs people's sight, which makes it impossible to distinguish the direction of the arrow.Stone does not blink at the sky, after a long time: \"in.\"\"Really?\" Hong Shan looks suspicious, \"how can I not see clearly?\"In a corner of the martial arts arena, someone's voice sounded again, \"I've picked up Heyan's arrow! Here it is He ran to Liang Ping with an arrow and said, \"hereOn the arrow, there is a willow string.Liang Ping and Wang Ba looked at Heyan at the same time.The former is a surprise to discover that the man in front of him is a treasure, while the latter is full of unbelievable.How did he do it?Wang Ba clenched his bow and said, \"come again!\" \"Go on!\" he yelled at the rookie who sounded the gongThe recruits struck several gongs, and from the woods, a large number of birds flew out at once. Wang Ba put several arrows on his hand at the same time, and let them go at once!A few arrows rushed into the sky together, but it was not clear whether they had been hit or not, but a moment later, someone in the martial arts arena excitedly called, \"yes! I have the arrowA few arrows can hit a hundred. This man is already one in a hundred. No, it can be said that he is one in a thousand. What about Heyan?When we looked at Heyan again, he Yan gave a smile. He also imitated Wang BA's appearance and put several arrows on the bow together.The bow was pulled full, the young man's face hung with a relaxed smile, as if to go to the Surabaya beach for an outing to the youth's home, playing shooting at will.She pulled the bow.The arrow also rushed into the flock of birds. The birds fled in a panic. Someone yelled at the martial arts arena, \"hit it! I got the arrowIf you take the arrow in front of the coach, you will not miss it.\"You Wang Ba bit his teeth and turned to carry the arrow barrel. \"I don't believe your good luck again.\" He kept shooting with his bow, but he wanted to shoot all the arrows in his quiver.There are 20 arrows in each arrow barrel, and the color of the arrow feathers is also different, which is convenient for recruits to distinguish when they practice. Wang Ba took the red arrow feather. Heyan picked the arrow feather and picked the blue arrow feather. She also learned from Wang BA's archery.For a moment, neither of them spoke. They could only hear the sound of gongs in the woods and the birds flying in the sky.\"How beautiful! How interesting Cheng Lishu's eyes lit up and he grabbed Liang Ping's arm and praised, \"it's much more interesting than in the capital hunting ground! Coach Liang, why are your soldiers so interesting? How did you find such a talent? \"Liang Ping made up his smile. He was at a loss. He didn't know it! It's a surprise to have a Wang ba. Well, now we have another Heyan. Liang Ping doubts whether he is dreaming.Twenty arrows were used up in an instant.The recruits on the arena were also enthusiastic, collecting the fallen arrows and taking them to coach Liang. Twenty red arrows, of which twenty are green, have no false shot.Liang Zhou Wei's recruits, unexpectedly out of such a two hundred one, shooting stone Yinyu God archers. Liang Ping thought that if he was about to be promoted, he would not be promoted, and the monthly rate should also rise.\"I didn't expect ah Hege to be so powerful...\" I've muttered to myself.\"I didn't expect,\" Hong Shan didn't return to his mind. \"I had known I would have won ahe...\"Yeah, it's not over yet. Hongshan's words seemed to remind people that a new soldier suddenly cried out: \"this It's a draw! Is He Yan and Wang Ba the same result? What's the deal? \"Yeah, how about that?Wang Ba lowered his head. No one knew what he was thinking. After a moment, he raised his head and his face was cloudy and clear. \"You didn't win.\"\"Yes,\" He Yan did not deny, she even sincerely praised the other side, \"is your archery is too good, I trust big.\"\"Even if you draw, you still don't beat me today.\" It's a bully. At this point, he is also a little flustered. In fact, he Yan can keep pace with him in the same way as the birds, which shows that he is equal to himself in the other skills of bows and crossbows.He couldn't find any other way to beat Heyan.\"I said ten days ago, ten days later, I will defeat you. How can we make a draw now that there is no point in winning or losing? \" He Yan is good at fanning, \"since you can't think of a way to compete, then I'll mention one, how about it?\"www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Cheng Lishu said in a low voice, \"coach Liang, is there anything comparable to this bow and crossbow?\"Coach Liang shook his head, \"this I don't know. \" In fact, there are quite a few of them, but they are similar. Just now he Yan has shot the birds, and the rest is not difficult. But what she meant by this was that she would surely surpass Wang ba. But what else can Wang Ba not do that she can do alone?Wang Baxian was stunned, and then disapproved of a Xiang, \"you may mention it!\"It's just another draw, he thought.He Yan smiles. She goes to Cheng Lishu and suddenly reaches out and pulls off the long hair band of Cheng Lishu.Cheng Lei Su was in a daze. When he reacted, his long hair had spread out. He said, \"what are you doing?\"\"Sorry for this brother,\" He Yan said with a smile, \"since you want to worship me, you won't be stingy with a hairband and lend it to you.\"\"But you can...\" Cheng Li Su ran her hand around her hair and murmured in a low voice, \"it's too sudden. Besides, why don't you use your own hair band?\" He Yan has his own good.\"I think my little brother's hair band is much more delicate than mine. Maybe it's a bit of luck. I'd like to borrow some happiness from you.\" He Yan does not change his face.Who doesn't like to hear nice words? Cheng Lishu immediately smiles and says: \"it's good to say! You can use itThey didn't understand what he was doing with Cheng Lishu's hair band. He Yan slowly wrapped the hair band between his hands and covered his eyes.\"He is...\" People began to understand what he was going to do.The Yellow headband blindfolded her eyes. She put her hand behind her head and gently tied a knot. Then she said, \"OK.\"He Yan didn't use the hair bands of himself and others. It was because they were running and practicing bows in the hot weather. They were already stained with sweat. People in the barracks don't pay attention to it. Their hair bands are stained. But Xiao Jue's nephew is not the same. His clothes are brand-new and fragrant, and his hair band is as neat as his uncle who has a habit of cleanliness. He wants to use it more cleanly.Maybe he Yan's clothes are even cleaner than he Yan's own. Now he tied up his hair band and thought that it should be true that he still had a little light rosin.He Yan is really exquisite young master. He Yan is really a nephew.\"Heyan, what are you going to do Wang Ba frowned and asked. He had a guess in his heart, but he didn't dare to admit it.\"Let's shoot with blindfolded eyes.\" She said.The martial arts arena gradually quieted down. In summer, when the wind blew, the long end of the hair band behind her head fluttered. It seemed that the young man in red also had a certain elegant color. Her lips are also with a smile, holding a long bow, toward the direction of Wang Ba, \"this game, I will win you.\"Four words, she said the light, decisive, as if had expected the end.Wang BA's face was blue and white, and changed a few times. Before he could speak, someone would speak first. His voice was full of doubt, \"shoot an arrow with a blindfolded eye. What do you shoot? Grass target? \"He Yan shook his head and raised her head slightly. She covered her eyes and should not be able to see the sky. But she looked up as if she could see the traces of tits flying in the sky. She said, \"just like before, hunt tits.\"The crowd was in an uproar.She should be so conceited, but is that really conceited?He Yan turned to face Wang BA's direction again. She asked with a smile, \"OK?\"All right? Two words, like the original coach Liang asked her, she answered \"yes\". Now, the word \"can\" has reached the tip of his tongue, but Wang Ba can't say it.Whether he was a mountain bandit or hunting or killing people, he was for the purpose. Blindfolded archery, he is not blind, do this kind of thing meaningless, not rich children, play novelty. If he is very confident in his bow and Crossbow Skills, he Yan's competition method is one of his least confident.He can't do it at all.Wang Ba looks at Heyan. He Yan doesn't urge him to give him the result. But the recruits around him also looked at him with all kinds of eyes, and taught Wang Ba to ride a tiger. Is he going to be here today, in the full view of the public, he was shamed by a yellow haired boy, and said that he was the head of a mountain bandit, and he did not dare to take the words of a child.\"Yes He gritted his teeth. However, there is a fluke in his heart. Maybe Heyan is also deceiving him. This boy is always cunning and evil, and he can't do it himself. But deliberately want to make a very sure appearance, that is, to deceive himself to give up the defeat.He's not fooled!\"This game, you first!\" Wang Ba said to him.The young man laughed again. She nodded and spat out two words, \"yes.\"\u2026\u2026Next to the flag stage of the martial arts arena, there is a pavilion. The pavilion is next to the Liangzhou garrison. The terrain is high, so you can have a panoramic view of the martial arts arena.There are two people standing in front of the pavilion, far away looking at the young soldiers surrounded by the center.Shen Han was wearing a strong red dress and a black cloth belt around his waist. The youth around him were like ice and snow, and their expression was indifferent. It was Xiao Jue.\"I didn't expect that this time, there were such two good talents in this group of soldiers.\" Shen Han sighed: \"it's needless to say that Wang BA was born as a mountain bandit. He was rebellious, but his bow and crossbow were really exquisite and powerful. However, the most surprising thing is that young man named Heyan. He is only 15 or 16 years old. He has been so outstanding, gentle and charming. After growing up for a few years, he will surely become the best in this group of recruits. \"He thought of talking with Liang Ping before. At that time, Liang Ping was very optimistic about Heyan, but Shen Han didn't pay attention to him. He thought that he was too ordinary to pay attention to, and he almost missed a good candidate.He saw that Xiao Jue didn't answer the question, so he cautiously tried to say, \"what does the governor think?\"\"Gentle in disposition?\" The young man repeated slowly. After a moment, he said, \"I'm afraid you've lost your sight. The rebellious one is not Wang Ba, but Heyan. \"He Yan? Shen Han doubted that he had seen the young man several times, always with a smile. Wang Ba provoked him several times, but he didn't get angry. To be honest, a child of this age is just as brave as blood. If he disagrees with him, he Yan is very self-restraint and gentle.Did the governor say he Yan was rebellious? For the first time, Shen Han doubted the boss's vision.\"Well...\" Shen Han changed his words, \"the governor thought, can he Yan win this game?\"The young man hooked his lips and his voice was faint.\"Yes.\"www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you can't see your prey, you can only listen to it.And there is nothing better than a blind man to hear everything in the world.When she was blind, she was also decadent. A blind man, who was inconvenient to walk in the world, could not even take care of herself. How could she be the outstanding one. She has always worked hard, and her mediocrity will be filled with diligence. However, when the disaster broke down, all her efforts were recovered in an instant. Even her \"ordinary\" qualification became a delusion and turned into ashes.She remembers when she was not reconciled to despair, someone said to her, \"if you really want to be strong, why not be blind? Even if you are blind, you can be the most different one among the blind.\"This is not really a very good comfort, but it was miraculously remembered by her. When she is trying to do something, she doesn't have to do it with her blind eyes.She didn't know if she was the \"most\" different one, but she should be different from the ordinary blind. She can take care of herself and even others. She can play sword and roll dice with her servants on her back. She can also be naughty, secretly hide a child's catapult and shoot birds secretly.A blind man, compared with other blind people, does not live too bad.Since you can do what you can do when you are blind, not to mention now. She's just, for the time being, back to the old days.The sound of gongs in the forest startled countless birds, and birds were reflected in the sky. The young man covered his eyes with a smile and arched with a bow. The arrow followed the bird's trail and flew to the clouds!A tit chirps and cries. It is shot by an arrow and falls rapidly. The blue feather arrow reflects the yellow cloth in the eyes of the boy, which is bright and colorful.He Yan reached out and untied the blindfolded headband. She didn't even look at the arrow on the ground, as if she had expected to shoot the prey. She handed the cloth to Wang Ba and said with a smile, \"it's your turn.\"There was no sound around. Wang Ba didn't reach for her hair band.He Yan did not move. For a long time, Wang Ba dropped his head. He didn't look at Heyan, but said in a low voice: \"no, I won't. You are powerful. I'm not as good as you.\"In this speech, half anger, half sincerity. He was angry that he had lost his face to Heyan. What he sincerely believed was that he Yan's archery was blindfolded. He really could not. Even if he began to learn to practice in the future, he would not be better at it.People always have to admit their shortcomings.The recruits finally came to their senses, but they didn't cheer. At first, a voice wailed: \"my dry cake, my dry cake lost! How miserableAnother voice said, \"I'm even worse. I've got ten credits, and it's gone!\"Then, howling one after another, the huge liangzhouwei did not seem to have won the dry cake from this gamble. Even with the support of wheat and their three dry cakes, the win and loss can be balanced, and it is also in vain.But at this time, a joyful voice rang up, \"ah! I won. I put in ten pieces of dried meat. Ha ha, I said that I have always had a good eye for people! \"Heyan is about to go. He is stunned and looks back at Cheng Lishu. Unexpectedly, the one who threw ten pieces of dried meat is Cheng Lishu. But on second thought, if it wasn't Cheng Lishu, who would have done so much in Liangzhou Wei? Xiao Jue? It's strange that Xiao Jue will take part in this kind of gambling.Cheng Lishu ran to Heyan, looked at him, and said, \"well, brother Heyan, thanks to you, I finally won. You don't know, I can't do anything in the capital city. I can't do anything. I can't even go to the casino. I've never won once. Today is the first time for me to win. Brother Heyan, I will definitely bow down to you as a brother. Today is our day of worship. I will invite you to drink wine. \"\"Cough,\" Liang Ping pressed his fist against his lips and said, \"no drinking in the camp.\"\"Tea, please!\" Cheng Lishu holds Heyan's hand and looks at him as if he is looking at his lost relatives for many years, which shows a real closeness.\"That's not necessary.\" He Yan took out his hand and put the headband into his hand. \"I almost forgot this. Thank you for the headband of Mr. Cheng.\"\"Between you and me, there is no need to say thank you.\" Cheng Lishu smiles, and then he thinks of something. Suddenly he turns his head and opens his mouth to Wang Ba, \"Hey, who, did you forget something?\"\"What?\" He Yan did not understand.\"Have you forgotten your bets?\" Cheng Lishu said in a hurry, \"you gamble with him. If you lose, you go to be a gang leader. If he loses, he has to call you boss. Now that he's lost, he has to fulfill his betsWang BA was stiff.People around him laughed and laughed, and Liang Ping turned his back on his back. After that, he was not supposed to take part in. Wheat and Hongshan lean together to watch the excitement. Heyan raises his eyebrows and looks at Wang ba.Wang Ba came to Heyan step by step. He was much higher than he Yan. He Yan was too thin and too small in front of him. His face turned red, and even the old scar on his face was red as if he were about to bleed.He Yan noticed his clenched fists and sighed silently in his heart. He thought that the head of the family should always pay more attention to face? It would be more embarrassing for him to call himself boss than to kill this man. He Yan was about to open his mouth and say, \"forget it, Wang Ba has already said in a low voice Boss. \"He Yan said:She raised her eyes to Wang Ba, but Wang Ba thought she was going to be upset and said, \"I've called! It's your own business that you didn't hear. I won't call again! \"\"I hear you.\" He Yan laughs, \"I'm just surprised that you can really shout.\"\"My husband's words are as good as his words. I'm not a man who can't believe his words.\" Wang Ba snorted, \"you are lucky this time. In the future Don't provoke me in the future After saying this, he seems to feel very shameless and unwilling to stay here. He turns and leaves in a hurry.He Yan thought for a moment and said in secret that Wang Ba had a certain bloodiness and was able to bend and stretch.\"Brother Heyan, look at you. It's amazing!\" Cheng Lishu put it up again, \"to celebrate, let's go. I'll treat you to tea!\"Before he could refuse, he was taken away by the happy boy.\u2026\u2026\"Mr. Cheng left with Heyan.\" On the pavilion, Shen Han asked, \"governor, do you want to chase him back?\"\"No need.\" Xiao Jue way, saw a competition, he seems to be tired of, turn to go out. Shen Han quickly followed up, thinking of what, and then looked at Xiao Jue, silent calculation in his heart.The governor said he Yan was rebellious. He didn't believe it at first. Now it seems that he is. Although he Yan is thin and small, now he can be called his boss by a mountain bandit. Isn't it difficult to deal with it? If he goes on like this, he can worship the governor.However, when Shen Han glanced at Xiao Jue's cold face, the governor couldn't look on him.www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Naturally, the room is different from the one that the recruits live in. It is a separate room. Although it is not luxurious, it is much better than the place where the recruits live.The room even ordered incense, which is a delicate Xian'e ornament. Seeing Heyan staring at him, Cheng Lishu explained, \"this is a good thing I brought from the capital. My uncle doesn't allow me to order here. I'll secretly order it. Don't tell him.\"It's like a child who stealthily does evil things behind his elders.He Yan heart way, don't say is Xiao Jue, even if it is her, she won't let it. It's summer. It's so hot. I don't have to smoke too much.Seeing that he didn't speak, Cheng Lisu misunderstood his meaning again and asked tentatively, \"do you like this very much? If you like, I'll give it to you! \" He put the censer into Heyan's hand, \"it doesn't matter, we can afford the relationship!\"He Yan put it back to him Thank you. I don't have a place to put it. \"Also, Cheng Lishu thought about it and nodded regretfully, \"I'll go back and tell my uncle to change a room for you, just like me.\"He Yan said:It's strange that Xiao Jue can agree! If Cheng Lishu wants to really accomplish this, she can call her elder brother Cheng Lishu!I don't know who I am, uncle? My uncle is now the commander of the right army, general Fengyun, Mr. Xiao, your superior. \" Cheng Lishu finished in one breath, then went to see Heyan's face. Seeing that he Yan looked as usual, he said, \"Why are you not surprised at all?\"Should she be surprised? He Yan said: \"I think you have a great bearing. I don't look like an ordinary person. I guess the uncle of the young master should do the same. Sure enough, like his uncle, like his nephew. \"This pleased Cheng Lishu. He showed a shy smile and scratched his head. He said, \"that's not true. I'm far from my uncle. My uncle lives next door to me, but he is out now. Or I'll take you to meet himHe Yan thought, that is not necessary.\"Come on, I'm ready for tea.\" Cheng Lishu was so busy that he put a cup of tea into Heyan's hand. \"After drinking this cup of tea, we'll worship the brothers!\"He Yan looked at the tea in his hand, hesitated and put the tea back on the table.Cheng carp Su Leng for a moment, \"what's the matter?\"\"Mr. Cheng, I don't think we should call ourselves brothers. Wrong generation. \" He Yan Dao.She and Xiao Jue are of the same generation, but Cheng Lishu is called Uncle Xiao Jue. If she and Cheng Lishu worship each other, will they be called Uncle Xiao Jue in the future?She can let Xiao Jue take advantage of this? Think beautiful!\"Why the wrong generation?\" Cheng Li Su did not understand, \"I am 15 years old, I listen to Liang Jiaotou said, you are 16 years old, we are not much different.\"\"Your name is Xiao Uncle Dudu, he's not very old. \" He Yan Dao. Xiao Jue was only one year older than her previous life. Now she has just reached her crown. She asked, \"is he your uncle?\"\"Well, we are related.\" Cheng Lei Su explained it very carefully.It turns out that Cheng Lishu's mother, Mrs. Cheng, and Xiao Jue are cousins. However, there was a big age gap between Mrs. Cheng and Xiao Jue. When Xiao Jue was born, Mrs. Cheng had already married, and there was little contact between her brother and sister. However, when Cheng Lisu grew up, he loved to stick to this little uncle of his own age.He Yan thought, as if he remembered that when he was in Xianchang hall, a fat and white young man often came to see Xiao Jue, but he forgot whether his name was Xiao Jue \"Uncle\".\"My uncle is excellent in everything. His literary and military skills are one in a million. With his face shining, no one else dares to call me a\" waste childe. \" When Cheng Lishu talked about nicknames, he was not ashamed to say, \"now I make friends with you again, and you are as good as my uncle. I am really good!\"He Yan said: I don't know where to start.Speaking of Heyan, what did Cheng Lishu think of and asked her, \"by the way, you are so excellent. Brother he, what do you do in your family?\"Even though he didn't drink the tea, he called \"brother he\". He Yan didn't know whether to answer his question or correct his statement first. She said, \"my family is an ordinary family.\"The appearance that she didn't want to say more fell into Cheng Lishu's eyes, and she had a little more profound meaning. Cheng Lishu said solemnly, \"I understand. You're such an expert, you don't want to reveal your whereabouts.\"He Yan thought, is the child brain problem?\"You are so capable, come to Liangzhou Wei?\" Cheng Li Su asked, \"why do you want to join the army because of your skill?\"He Yan then said to his nephew again: \"a man should make a contribution, get a reward to build a house, marry a daughter-in-law and give birth to a childMy nephew was not as impulsive as my uncle. The young man with red lips and white teeth looked at her for a while, nodded in praise and said, \"this is a very good idea, very Down to earth. But, brother Ho, is it too slow for you to join the army and make contributions? In recent years, there is no war to fight. It is said that heroes emerge in troubled times. In our peaceful and prosperous times, your martial arts are nowhere to be used and wasted. \"He Yan said: The child is very thoughtful.\"Why don't I show you the way.\" Cheng Lishu approached her and whispered, \"do you know my uncle's Nanfu soldiers?\"He Yan nodded: \"yes.\" Nanfu soldiers were established by General Xiao, invincible and invincible.\"Among the soldiers of Nanfu, there is a charging cavalry team, nine flag battalion.\"He Yan of Jiuqi camp also knew that this was a close friend Xiao Jue had cultivated for himself after he took over the soldiers from Nanfu. Most of them were attacking and charging with strange methods.\"When my uncle came to Liangzhou Wei this time, in addition to other things, he had to select some of the recruits and take them back to join the nine flag camp.\"He Yan was surprised, \"nine flag camp is not no longer receiving people?\"\"That's what we call the most rare thing in the world. It's talent. In Jiuqi camp, all of them are talents. Last time, a big brother in the camp was injured and broke his hand. He can't fight any more. Now he is an official in Chaoli. Therefore, if you want to make a success, get promoted and become rich, you have to find the right place first. If you are so skilled and you are your own person, you should go to Jiuqi camp. \" The way of youth comes slowly.He Yan gradually put away his smile. After a moment, she frowned and said in a cold voice, \"did you say that to others?\"Her eyes were cold and sharp, and Cheng Lishu was startled and muttered: \"no...\"\"Remember, then, not to speak to them.\"Cheng Lishu nodded subconsciously: \" Good. \"He Yan was satisfied, and suddenly bent his eyebrows and eyes, and his lips were cocked up, \"but what you said just now is quite right.\"\"Yes?\" Cheng Li is confused.The fastest way to get promoted is second. She was too slow to fight for meritorious service in the battlefield. Even if she was promoted, she might not have contacted the Hejia family. With Xiao Jue, they are different. General Fengyun and general Feihong are enemies. They can write countless articles on this basis.What's more, it's much easier to inquire about the affairs of the Dynasty around Xiao Jue. She didn't want to have any entanglement with Xiao Jue in her previous life, but now she has to rack her brains to be Xiao Jue's confidant. This is really incredible, but it happens to be fate.He Yan drank all the tea in the cup, stood up and said, \"I want to enter the nine flag camp.\"End of Volume 1 www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Every day is hard training, which is boring and boring. However, the days went by like this. After a little heat stroke, it was a great heat stroke, and soon after the great heat stroke, autumn began.Summer training, will liangzhouwei recruits quickly develop excellent endurance and determination. In addition to bows and crossbows and morning load-bearing running, they also need to practice whip knife, step circumference, array, spear, sabre, riding and shooting every month. The practice of riding and shooting is less, because Liangzhou guards are limited.\"Hogo, your bread.\" Wheat hands the dry grain to Heyan.The round cake is roasted with charcoal, crisp and salty. He Yan chewed two pieces of cake and poured a large amount of saliva. He felt that his empty abdomen was immediately pressed and felt comfortable.Hongshan stared at Heyan and said, \"ah he, I don't think it's right. You said that you eat the same as us every day, and sometimes you open a small stove. Why are you still so thin, so What about the little one? \" He choked the word \"short\" back.He Yan said:Can I blame her?Her brother, Cheng Lishu, who was a \"waste childe\", came by from time to time and secretly gave him something to eat, sometimes a handful of pine nuts, sometimes a few pieces of dried meat, and once even gave him a bowl of soup, saying it was from his uncle.Every time I give it to him, Cheng Lishu is still very nervous, \"quick, quick, just eat here. I can't be seen by my uncle.\" He Yan doesn't want to eat it sometimes. Why? But on second thought, I couldn't stand it. What's more, the food that Cheng Lei Su sent me was really delicious.Even such a small stove didn't make Heyan look stronger. It is busy training every day, sweating, a few months down, lost a lap, look more small pitiful.However, a few days ago, this little poor man made an amazing performance in Liangzhou's bow and crossbow, which made the mountain bandit's scarred strong man call his boss, which made countless recruits lose their dry cakes vividly. He Yan is also a famous person now.After that, no one came to Heyan for a test, and he Yan was very happy. She is still considering how to let Xiao Jue notice herself, so as to save the country and enter the nine flag camp.Today's practice is long spear. The long spears in the martial arts arena are mostly made of thick wood, with a hard and tough shaft and a short and sharp point.The instructor threw his spears on the stage, and the recruits at the bottom followed suit and practiced for a period of time with little success. He Yan is not good at spears. She is used to using sword. Now she has become Miss heta. She is small and inconvenient to use a gun. She always feels that she can't let go.After coach Liang finished playing a set of shooting techniques, he asked the recruits to follow him. He stepped down to inspect him. When he came to Heyan's side, he couldn't help looking at him more.After all, it's hard to forget Yan's bow. This new recruit should be taken seriously. However, over the past few days, coach Liang also noticed that he Yan's whip knife, step Wai, spear, and knife skills were all good, but they were far from amazing. The only surprise was riding and shooting. But since there was no competition these days, only a little could be seen.She trained hard every day, including crossbow and weight-bearing running. However, coach Liang still has a feeling that the boy seems to have some reservation, and his daily performance is only a part of it.He went back to the position of coach Du maudu. Coach Du is also patrolling around him, pointing to what a recruit is saying.Liang Ping went over and heard them talking.\"It's a martial arts school in my family. You see, the spear is very good!\"\"I said, in fact, he is more skillful than Lao Du. I have never seen this set of shooting techniques!\"\"This boy is not very old. I guess he is only seventeen or eighteen. I'm a little bit of a practitioner. This is.\"Liang Ping asked, \"who are you talking about?\"\"That, the soldier under commander Du, the leftmost one in the front row, big and tall, see that?\"Liang Ping looked in the direction he pointed to. Sure enough, he saw a young man with strong clothes practicing his gun. The young man's thick eyebrows and big eyes, his facial features are straight, and his eyebrows are firm and firm, and there is also a faint look of arrogance. Liang Ping could feel that every step of his gun dance had its own evil spirit.\"Good!\" Liang Ping couldn't help praising.\"It's really good,\" Du Mao and you Rong Yan said, \"I've tried him a few times before, and I have real ability. His name is Jiang Jiao, and his father is the master of the martial arts school in Beijing. \"\"Then he will join the army?\" Liang Ping was surprised. Although the young master of the martial arts school is not rich, he can live a good life in ordinary families.Do you understand the ambition of a man Du Mao said, \"I appreciate such a man!\"Someone cut in and said, \"I don't know who is more powerful than Heyan under laoliang and Jiangjiao?\"As soon as he said this, there was silence around him. Du Maoruo looked at Liang Ping thoughtfully. Liang Ping subconsciously replied, \"Heyan is quite talented in bows and crossbows, but I think he is not a match for Jiang Jiao.\"Joking, he Yan is so small and thin, but Jiang Jiao is very tall and strong. He is different from archery and shooting. Compared with bow and arrow, the prey is grass man, bird and beast. However, two people compete with each other in the art of shooting. If they are not careful, they will bleed. Jiang Jiao's family runs a martial arts school. He Yan is not Jiang Jiao's opponent since he was a child. If he is beaten up by Jiang Jiao, where will he find another such Archer?\"Lao Liang, you can't say that.\" After listening to him, Du Mao did not give up. Instead, he hooked Liang Ping's shoulder. \"At the beginning, he Yan, who was under your command, always lagged behind at the beginning of running. Finally, he could run easily. In the beginning, even the bow can't be opened. Finally, you can shoot with blindfolded eyes. You say he can't now. Maybe he can do it again in ten days. As a coach, you can't protect the recruits too much. After all, they will go to the battlefield in the future. \"People around him echoed: \"yes, yes, Lao Du is right! Lao Liang, you can't protect the calf. \"That's right! Liang Ping thought indignantly in his heart that a group of people who were not afraid of watching the crowd were worried and kind.\"Coach Liang, I also want to compete with Heyan.\"When Liang Ping turned back, the young man named Jiang Jiao had put down his spear and walked behind him. He heard the talk of the instructors and suddenly came up with such a sentence.Liang Ping did not answer, thinking about how to refuse.\"Is that all right?\" Jiang Jiao seemed to know his dilemma and asked again.www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Liang Ping thought of this sentence in his mind and was about to say it. He said, \"Hey, ask coach Liang what to do. Go straight to Heyan! The boy has his own score. If he wants to, he can't, but if he doesn't, it's not very simple. \"\"That's right.\" Du Mao nodded and said to Jiang Jiao, \"go straight to Heyan. But, \"after a pause, he ordered,\" it's OK to have a competition. You can't hurt anyone. \"When he said that, Liang Ping could do nothing but watch Jiang Jiao go to Heyan.Jiang Jiao arrives in front of Liang Jiaotou's new recruits team and sees he Yan playing with a gun. It's not that she's too flashy, it's just that she's too small to stand out among these strong men. Jiang Jiao didn't immediately go forward, but looked at Heyan quietly for a while. He Yan didn't play any complicated shooting skills, but simply put in and stabbed out. However, even if it was the most common shooting technique, she practiced it conscientiously, without any laziness.After reading for a long time, someone noticed him and asked, \"brother, what are you standing here to watch us do?\"\"I'm looking for someone.\" Jiang Jiao said, and then strided to Heyan.He Yan was stabbing the gun forward. Unexpectedly, the head of the spear was held by someone. The stabbing man stepped back two steps. She raised her head and said strangely, \"what do you do with my spear?\"Jiang Jiao stepped back two steps when he was stabbed. He Yan seemed to be dancing with a soft gun, but he didn't know how powerful the gun was until he really held the gun head. If his family was not a martial arts school, he had to be stabbed and fall to the ground.With this in mind, he began to look down on him seriously and said, \"I heard that brother he is outstanding. I would like to have a competition with brother he in the long spear. How about it? \"He Yan blinked his eyes, understand, this is another to challenge?Hongshan stood behind Heyan. He patted his head and said, \"it's bad. People are afraid of being famous. Pigs are afraid of being strong. Last time ahe won Wang Ba, I knew it would be bad. Look, this is the second one.\"\"There will be more in the future?\" Wheat asked quietly.\"It's a lot. There's always a third, a fourth, a fifth.\" Hong Shan shook his head, \"people like to be competitive. What's the point of fighting back and forth? \"What's the point? He Yan thought it was interesting. She always thought that if she wanted to enter Jiuqi camp, she would have to let Xiao Jue find out that she was an outstanding hero. But Xiao Jue didn't come to the martial arts arena every day to see the recruits training, and she didn't show her performance. Unless someone, like Wang Ba, had been challenging her to achieve her reputation, it would naturally spread to Xiao Jue's ears.But I don't know why, since the last time Wang Ba and his bow and crossbow competition, no one has come to challenge her. He Yan speculates that it may be the lost dry cake that makes the recruits lose their vitality, and they don't want to see themselves for the time being. She can not take the initiative to find people, see a person to let others with their own competition.Now there is another one. It's not drowsiness. What is a pillow delivery? It's wonderful.\"Good.\" He Yan stood the spear on his side, \"how do you want to compare it?\"She answered too simply, let Jiang Jiao also Zheng for a moment, hesitated for a moment, he said: \"you and I two people row on the line, point to stop.\"\"Yes.\" He Yan said, \"go get your gun, and compare it on the stage of the martial arts arena.\"\"You...\" Jiang Jiao hesitated and asked, \"don't you have to wait ten days?\"He Yan a Leng, some funny, \"not every time to 10 days.\"Do they think she's going to do it in ten days? A few days ago, it was really because of insufficient strength. Now, in addition to training every day, she has not forgotten to practice stone locks. Although she is not as strong as a strong man, ordinary crossbows are enough.On hearing the news, several instructors came together. Someone touched Liang Ping's arm and said, \"Lao Liang, I said it earlier. I can't point out that your new recruit has not paid attention to this competition at all. You are just worrying about it here!\"Liang Ping:He thought Heyan would not agree. He thought that if he Yan refused in person, Jiang Jiao would not say anything more. I didn't expect he Yan himself to accept it. This boy never knew how to write \"refuse\"? Or is he confident enough that no matter who comes to challenge, he will not refuse?\"I'm looking forward to it.\" Du Mao pulled off the cowhide water bag on his waist and drank a sip of water. His eyes were staring at Heyan, who was walking toward the high platform. \"Or, let's have a bet?\"\"No gambling.\" Liang Ping refused. The man who lost the dry cake in the camp last time was hungry for a whole month, which made people feel terrible. Now that recruits don't gamble, how can the head coach still be blocked?\"He's a coward, he won't come, I'll come!\" Another coach said, \"I'll bet on rice wine at the end of the month, and I'll bet on Jiang jiaosheng.\"\u2026\u2026Cheng Lishu gets the news that Heyan wants to compete with Jiang Jiao on the spear. His first reaction is to find Xiao Jue in the next room.He went away in high spirits. Xiao Jue was talking to his own private secret guard. Seeing this, he frowned, \"Cheng Lishu, what do you look like running around?\"\"Uncle, I'll tell you to see a good play!\"Xiao Jue motioned for dark Wei to leave. After he left, he asked, \"what's the matter?\"\"I'm a big brother. Brother he, I'm going to have a competition with others today.\" Cheng Lishu grabbed Xiao Jue's sleeve. \"It's about to start now. It's in the martial arts arena. Let's go and have a look. How about it?\"\"Heyan?\" Xiao Jue raised her eyebrows.He remembers Heyan. In a few months, his name has been spread all over liangzhouwei. First, he ran, and then he became Cheng Lishu's big brother. Cheng Lishu stealthily delivers food to Heyan from time to time. He also turns a blind eye to him. Quan should be a child's game.However, he was determined. Although his qualifications were mediocre, every night after the recruits went to bed, they still had to go to the arena to continue training. They would not go back to their rooms until the third shift of the month.\"Yes, I know that, too.\" Cheng Lishu pulled Xiao Jue's sleeve and took him out. \"It's said that the boy took the initiative to find my elder brother today. My elder brother will definitely teach him what real shooting is!\"Xiao Jue glanced at him, \"sleeve.\"Cheng Lishu immediately let go of his hand, instead, he hugged his arm and begged, \"uncle, go and have a look with me. My elder brother is really powerful, not inferior to those strong men in your nine flag campXiao Jue chuckled, as if he was not sure what he said, but he did not stop, and eventually went out with him.Cheng Lishu breathed a sigh of relief and thought in his heart, big brother, little brother, I can only help you get here.www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The open square field is a good place for martial arts competition.The recruits gathered around the high platform and looked at the two people on the stage.Jiang Jiao has already got his spear. He is tall and strong, and he is very brave. This is probably the reason why he practiced martial arts since he was young. He looks different from other recruits and looks good. If he is with him, he should teach people to feel at ease.He Yan stood opposite to him. Compared with him, Heyan is more like a young boy who has not yet developed. He is short and thin, but his facial features are fresh and beautiful. After such a long training, the sun is not good all day long. Although the boy is tanned, he is already very white compared with the recruits around him. Standing here like this, he doesn't look like a recruit, like a young master of a big family. He is gentle and handsome.Jiang Jiao raised his spear, \"you first.\"Still quite considerate, he Yan smile Ying Ying Ying way: \"then I am not polite.\" She cross long gun in front of the body, eyes light micro motion, the body has rushed forward.Jiang Jiao's face changed and he went up.In a flash, the two figures mingled into a group, only to hear the sound of \"bang bang bang bang\". In a flash, they seemed to have fought more than a dozen moves. They both stepped back together and looked at each other.He Yan looked at each other, smile unchanged, Jiang Jiao see he Yan, can not hide surprise.As soon as he met, he knew that he Yan could never be the first to practice long spears. The more than ten moves she fought with herself were dangerous, and he could not attack or retreat.It's a good match!He thought he had overestimated Heyan, but he still underestimated him.The recruits at the bottom didn't understand it. They just thought that he Yan and Jiang Jiao stopped after a few moves. They didn't enjoy watching. They were dissatisfied and said, \"what happened just now? Who has the upper hand? \"\"I just drank. What did I miss? Did you see that? \"\"No, I didn't see anything.\"Under the stage of the martial arts arena, several instructors were dignified and speechless for a long time.Du Mao looked at Liang Ping. Liang Ping quickly waved his hand, \"I don't know. Don't ask me! He didn't show his hand when he was practicing, I don't know! \"The recruits can't understand, but the instructors can see clearly. He Yan fought with Jiang Jiao, but he Yan didn't lose. He even underestimated the enemy and was crushed by Heyan. Jiang Jiao's gun skill is complex and changeable, flexible as a snake. Heyan's gunshot seems simple, but it contains strength, which can easily open Jiang Jiao's spear.\"Liang Ping, you really have a good soldier.\" There is a sour road for the coach.Liang Ping was half proud and half frightened. He Yan was too deep to hide. If Jiang Jiao didn't take the initiative to compete with Heyan, he would only think that he Yan had a talent for bow and crossbow, and that he was only good at shooting.On the stage, Jiang Jiao stares at Heyan and says, \"come again!\"He Yan nodded his head.This time, Jiang Jiao took the gun first, and he Yan met him. The two spears were glued together, and the red tassels fluttered in the wind. Jiang Jiao's spear was like a snake. Every time he attacked, he ran straight to Heyan's face. However, he Yan only slightly turned his head, and the gun front brushed her cheek and swept away.Jiang Jiao began to be serious. His shooting technique was as fierce as a rainstorm. He shot one shot after another, trying to find out the flaw of Heyan. However, it was amazing that the young man was dexterous. Every time he avoided danger, the spear in his hand seemed to become an indestructible shield, which blocked Jiang Jiao's spear, and could not get closer.\"Come on, faster! It's only a short way to knock him down The recruits were worried.\"Why does Heyan only defend but not attack? Does she not know how to shoot?\"With the passage of time, Jiang Jiao's gun skills have been unable to support such intensive attacks. He stares at Heyan, and he doesn't know how the seemingly emaciated teenager has such strength and endurance. He is not tired at all, he has only concentration. Concentration is frightening.A trance, Jiang Jiao in the hands of the long gun pulled empty, he was shocked in the heart, only to see the opposite youth showed a smile. Jiang Jiao has no time to react. He Yan's spear, which has always been defending but not attacking, suddenly stabs him in front of him. He carries the gun to block it, and the one who is stabbed is biased.He Yan began to attack.\"Spears are the king of all kinds of weapons. When they encounter guns, they are defeated.\" The young man's voice was clear and crisp, no big or small, and the mountains and forests were empty. When he spoke, there was an echo, which was just able to spread throughout the entire arena.She is short and avoids the spear of Jiang Jiao. From bottom to top, she stabs at Jiang Jiao's face with a tricky angle.\"Drop gun type so broken stick, left and right insert style so broken card boring.\" Move, run the gun head, and come forward again.\"Yes, breaking sword, breaking fork, breaking shovel, breaking double Dao, breaking short knife.\" The arm seems to have infinite strength. When blocked, he also goes forward and stabs Jiang Jiao. Jiang Jiao has no time to deal with it. He is already in a state of confusion.\"Goupu method, breaking whip, breaking mace.\" When she stepped forward, the spear was as fast as the wind and rain. Compared with Jiang Jiao's attack just now, she was more accurate. She grasped every weakness of Jiang Jiao and hit the snake seven inches, which was fatal.\"Broken sword, broken halberd.\" Jiang Jiao has been forced to the edge of the arena. He is in a trance. He only feels that the young people in front of him are like riding horses on the battlefield. Everywhere there is evil spirit, he is irresistible and irresistible. He was forced to retreat and to rout.The spear goes straight to the front door. Jiang Jiao's hind legs are in a hurry. Suddenly, his steps slip. He falls down, and the screams of the recruits are heard in his ear. Jiang Jiao realizes that he has no way to go back.Suddenly, a hand took him.The spear was on his forehead, no more. The young man looked weak, but his strength was great. He pulled him back to the arena and took back his spear to his side.When the wind blows, the heat that blows just now is swept away, and the face is cool. The flag moved with the wind, and birds, beasts and insects were singing in the forest.The young man stood upright, and his voice was still clear and crisp. He did not see the tiredness and panting under the attack. He was slow and loud. \"Man can only see the real gun, so he is obsessed with all kinds of weapons. Once he gets a real gun, he looks at all the instruments as if they were playing games.\"Jiang Jiao stares at him. For a long time, he says softly, \"have you read the record of arms?\"\"The record of arms\" records the skills of each gun and knife. Jiang Jiao read it because his family is a martial arts school. His grandfather, his father, his brother and he all want to read it. He had read it before, but he felt that what was said in the book was too exaggerated to be true. But now he is here. In this young man, he knows that he is not good at learning.The young man looked at him with a smile on his face and said, \"I've read a little, and I understand a little bit.\"www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, there is no need for others to explain them too much. Almost lost, Yanhe was forced to fall to the edge of Jiaojiang.The young man won again.\"Brother ahoe is so powerful,\" the wheat murmured, \"more and more powerful.\"Hong Shan scratched his head, \"this boy, he didn't tell us that he could do this before.\"\"It's not the first time he's been practicing.\" After a long silence, the Stone said, \"so that man can't beat him.\"\"But it's not right,\" Hong Shan wondered. \"Ah he is a young master in the family. Do they usually practice crossbow and crossbow at home?\"He Yan didn't hear the whispers of the recruits. This was a great opportunity. She put her spear on the ground, and she stepped forward two steps and said, \"brothers, today I have won again.\"When she said this, she did not hide her complacency, even a little exaggeration, which made her look dazzling.\"What does this kid want?\" Asked Du Mao.No one knows what Heyan wants.He Yan said with a smile: \"I think in the future, there may be some people who want to challenge me. Don't worry that I won't respond to the challenge. I will not refuse to come. But one match a day. \"\"This guy, do you think you're setting up a challenge arena?\"Regardless of other people's eyes, he Yansi, the leader of the contest, said to herself: \"whip sword, Buwei, spear, sabre, riding and shooting, all of which are available in the barracks, can challenge me. Don't worry. If you win, you won't receive your dry cakes. Those who wish will come.\"Even though I know that this young man has unique skills, but this attitude is really arrogant.\"It's too arrogant to have such a person!\"\"I'm not modest at all, but I'm just lucky enough to beat people in the two items of crossbow and spear. I don't know the height of heaven and earth.\"\"Can't you find someone better than him? Tens of thousands of children, none of them can fight? \"He Yan gently smile, heart way, is not not unable to fight, but the most able to fight the young master, simply disdain to fight with her.She said: \"a word from a gentleman can't be recalled. Today, all the leaders are here, and I will do what I say! If I win, I will fight. If I lose, my brothers can ask for anything. But, \"she seemed embarrassed,\" that should not be possible. \"She didn't say it was ok, but when she said it, the recruits were angry again.\"He looks down on us!\"\"When there was no one in Liangzhou Wei, we all said that ten fingers were long and short. This boy was regarded as his own strong point. Did he regard himself as general Fengyun?\"\"Forget it. We'll see him in a few days. When he's in the face!\"He Yan made an arrogant gesture on the stage, and then walked slowly to the stage. Before he left, he seemed to think of something. He said to Jiang Jiao, who was standing on one side with an uncertain look, \"in fact, you use your spear very well.\"Jiang Jiao a Leng, looking at her, do not understand what she means.\"But when you meet me, I'd better.\" She laughed and walked down the stage, no longer to see Jiang Jiao's face.At the other end, Du Mao's face was as heavy as water. He Yan had a competition with Jiang Jiao, but he Yan killed Jiang Jiao just now. Jiang Jiao could not recover. This is not what he wants to see. He patted Liang Ping on the shoulder. He went to Jiangjiao first, intending to persuade the new soldier who had been standing under the horse for the first time, so as not to lose a good young man.\u2026\u2026On the pavilion next to the martial arts arena.\"Uncle, I won again!\" Seeing all this, Cheng Lishu jumped up and pointed to Heyan's direction. It seemed that he had just won the shooting. He kept praising, \"he is really powerful. No one can beat him!\"Xiao Jue glanced at him and was too lazy to answer him. He turned and walked out.Cheng Lishu thought of something, ran to Xiao Jue, left and right, \"uncle, look at him! Bow and crossbow first, marksmanship first, whip knife and so on, all will be the first, he is the first Liangzhou Wei First in addition to you, right? \"\"Wait until he gets the first one.\" Xiao Jue answered his enthusiasm with indifference.\"He's got two firsts now! The other first thing is sooner or later. And two firsts are amazing, aren't they? Uncle, look at him. How many talented people can you see in the world? Isn't it worth joining your nine flag camp? Look at him, uncleXiao Jue stopped and her eyes fell on him.Cheng Lishu is happy in his heart and thinks he has moved Xiao Jue. The next moment, Xiao Jue looked into his eyes and slowly opened his mouth: \"you mentioned Heyan frequently recently. You said twice about the nine flag camp. You never paid attention to the nine flag camp before,\" he said quietly. \"Cheng Lishu, do you want to promote Heyan into the nine flag camp?\"Cheng Lishu's heart \"clutters\" for a moment, and the secret way is broken. This uncle is the most intelligent, a little bit suspicious of himself, he said: \"no, no, I am I want you to pay more attention to my brother, uncleXiao Jue: do you think I'm stupid or are you smartCheng Lishu looked at him for a moment, then hung his head dejectedly, \"it's me who is stupid...\"\"How do you know about the nine flag camp?\" Xiao Jue asked him.The beautiful young man's eyes were calm, and there was no sign of anger. However, Cheng Lishu felt cold all over. He replied honestly, \"I lived next door to you. I heard director Shen talking to you. I knew that the nine flag camp was going to recruit new recruits in Liangzhou health station, so...\"Xiao chuckled and said, \"so you can't wait to please your big brother with this news?\"\"No, no, I really want to do it for my uncle.\" Cheng Lishu quickly denied, \"I have nothing to do every day.

How can I get into your elite cavalry team? I am also a loyal heartSilence for a moment, Xiao Jue asked: \"what did he say?\"\"Ah?\" Cheng Lisu was stunned at first, and then realized that Xiao Jue's \"he\" meant Heyan, and then said, \"after I finished with brother he, elder brother he seemed very happy. What's more, he said he would enter the nine flag camp. \"\"He said\" yes \" Xiao Jue asked slowly.Cheng Li Su shrank his neck. He felt the cold wind blowing. He nodded and said, \"yes, I want to Is there anything wrong? \"Xiao Jue chuckled, and his eyes, like autumn water, floated inexplicable emotions.

He should have come to see Heyan and Jiang Jiao compare their guns. After reading, he wanted to leave. Unfortunately, he Yan saw him and said, \"brother Wang!\" from a distanceIn the full view of the public, Wang BA's face was black, and he called out a big boss, like a gnat. He Yan looked at him with a smile. He turned his head and left, as if someone was driving him behind.\"Aho, I really have you.\" Wheat envies way.\"There will be more and more such things in the future. You have to get used to it.\" Heyan stood on tiptoe and kneaded the head of wheat. Hongshan saw it and hissed, \"you can grow a little bit first.\"He Yan shrugged his shoulders. He planned things from man to man and from heaven. He couldn't force long things.About today, he Yan was in a good mood. At night, he Yan had a dream for the first time when he finished his practice and went back to bed.In the dream, she stood on the stage of the martial arts arena. Others called her boss one after another. Cheng Lishu ran over and said to her with a smile: \"brother he, you're in the nine flag camp!\"\"Really?\" She was also very happy, only to hear a voice, \"he Rufei?\"She turned to see that it was Xiao Jue. He stared at her coldly and sarcastically, \"are you Heyan or he Rufei?\"He Rufei, when she heard the name, suddenly woke up from her dream, sat up and touched her head, which was full of sweat.It was bright outside. Hongshan was pushing the window open. Seeing her wiping sweat, she said casually: \"it's been extremely hot these days. I guess it's going to rain. After a few rains, the weather will turn cool. Damn it, I don't want to spend summer in Liangzhou. I've lost a layer of skinHe Yan smile, still a little uneasy. The wheat sees the appearance, strange way: \"a he elder brother facial expression is not good, did not suffer the summer heat?\"? Have some tea leaves? \"\"No, it's hot.\" He Yan got out of bed and put on shoes, \"it's good to go out and run and sweat.\"After the morning's heavy-duty running, I still went to the martial arts arena to practice martial arts. Today, I'm practicing sabre. Practicing, he saw a group of people come over and stop in front of Heyan.He Yan put down his knife.\"What you said yesterday counts?\" Asked the leader in a deep voice.This is a bald man with long eyebrows and leopard neck and iron bones. There is a string of Buddha beads on his neck. The beads are warm and shining with dark light. Each one has a finger size. He was holding a gold backed broadsword in both hands. He was much older than Heyan. When he was forty years old, he might have reached the destiny. But people do not see the slightest relaxation and fatigue, such as a tight bear.\"My name is Huang Xiong,\" said the bald man in a stuffy voice. \"I want to compete with you in the art of sword.\"The recruits who were listening to them were excited.\"Ah, there are people, there are people, so soon there are people, I said, we Liangzhou Wei tens of thousands of heroes, how can not choose one to teach this boy a man!\"\"Yes, yes, destroy his prestige and avenge our dry cakes!\"\"I don't think Heyan can be powerful this time. Look at the knife in Huang Xiong's hand. It's not a common product! I'm afraid it used to be a Ranger. \"He Yan also noticed that the blade in Huang Xiong's hand was red, the back was very thick, the blade was sharp, and the tip was flat and slightly curved. This kind of knife is very heavy. Ordinary people feel it hard to wield it. However, it is just right for a hero like Huang Xiong.\"You have a good knife.\" He Yan praised the way.Hearing the speech, Huang Xiong's eyes softened slightly. He said, \"it's my thirty year old friend.\"He Yan's heart is so tongue tied that he can't help but think of his own green Lang sword. She is now a new recruit and comes out in a hurry, unlike Huang Xiong who takes his knife to Liangzhou. I'm not used to having weapons to weigh my hands.At this time, he was very envious of Huang Xiong.Seeing he Yan's delay, Huang Xiong frowned and said, \"didn't you say yesterday that all comers would not refuse? Don't you want to fight now? \"He Yan was surprised for a moment and said with a smile, \"where, I can do it now.\"Facing the eyes of all, she calmly stepped onto the stage of the martial arts arena.Under the stage, Liang Ping looks numb at He Yan's movement.Du Mao leaned against the tree and began to gloat, \"He Yan, who is under your command, is really capable of picking up trouble.\"Liang Ping wanted to go up and slap him in the mouth. If Du Mao hadn't asked Jiang Jiao to compete with Heyan yesterday, he Yan would not have gone to the martial arts arena, nor would he have said such nonsense about setting up the challenge arena. Where else could there be today?Now Liang Ping can't stop what even general manager Shen acquiesces in. I can only recite it in my heart. I hope that today's Heyan will be blessed with good luck and live peacefully.\u2026\u2026Cheng Lisu stayed in Xiao Jue's room, bored to draw peach symbols on the table. His uncle was reading the books sent by the capital. He didn't know what it was. He had been reading them all morning.Cheng Lei Su feels a bit bored. He was thinking about whether to go out and have a look at the end of the arena and have some fun for himself. Outside someone knocked on the door, Xiao Jue said: \"in.\"Shen Han came in.Shen Han went to Xiao Jue and said a few words to Xiao Jue in a low voice. Cheng Li Su moved the chair to the other end, tried to stretch his ears and heard a few words.\"Heyan Huang Xiong Compare the knife Play martial arts. \"Cheng Li Su has always been difficult to use the brain for the first time to play a gratifying intelligence, the heart after a time, will know what is going on. Someone wants to compete with Heyan. Now he is in the martial arts arena. His heart suddenly excited, worthy of his elder brother, yesterday, today someone to play. He wants to see it now!Cheng Lishu secretly put down his pen and paper, while Xiao Jue's back to himself, winked at Shen Han, and crept out of the room.Just walked to the door, Xiao Jue light voice way: \"Cheng Li Su.\"Cheng Lishu: \"it's justHe broke down his face and answered. He was surprised. His uncle had no more eyes than others. How could he be caught every time he wanted to do something?Frankly, Cheng Lishu trotted up to Xiao Jue and said, \"uncle, I'll take a look. My elder brother is competing with others. How can I not go to see it? To be a man, we should be loyal. I'll come back to practice after reading, and I'll make sure I don't delay! \"Xiao Jue raised eyes to see him one eye, \"did I say not to let you go?\"\"Ah?\" Cheng Lishu immediately smiles, \"let's go, you didn't say it earlier! Then I'll go! \" As soon as he turned to run, Xiao Jue said, \"slow down.\"Cheng Lishu looks at him suspiciously.The latter stood up and walked out with Shen Han, \"I will go too.\"Cheng Lishu was stunned.\"Your elder brother is not going to enter the nine flag camp?\" \"I also want to see how he plans to enter the nine flag camp.\"www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It's really inconvenient. Most of the knives on the weapon rack are willow blades and large ring knives, which are not easy for her. She thought and thought, reaching for a knife at the bottom.Staring at her action, the recruits were stunned.Those who did not understand asked, \"why is this knife so small? It's not as long as a man's arm. \"Jiang Jiao saw the situation and said, \"this is a mandarin duck sword, not a pair, but a pair.\"Yuanyang Dao is not big indeed. It is only the same length as a person's forearm. The two knives are sealed in the same scabbard and can be hidden in sleeves or boots. The blade is wide and thick, only a few inches in front of the blade tip, which is convenient for backhand knife and grid block.He Yan slowly drew the sword out of the scabbard. One was a little longer and the other was a little short. It was about that few people used mandarin duck Dao in peacetime. The knife was still quite new.Yes, she praised in her heart. She played around in her hand and thought it was OK.Wang Ba also came to the stage and saw the mandarin duck sword in Heyan's hand. For a moment, he said, \"he actually used the mandarin duck sword?\"Huang Xiong on the stage was also puzzled. He saw that he Yan picked and picked. After picking the knife, he looked at him differently and asked, \"double swords?\"He Yan nodded: \"double swords.\"\"I didn't expect that you were young enough to be able to double swords?\" Huang Xiong said, \"sure enough, it's omnipotent.\"He Yan modestly replied, \"it's all forced by life.\"The people at the bottom didn't feel good. Du Mao reached out and touched Liang Ping, \"what does this Heyan family do? Life forced him to master all kinds of martial arts? Has he been abducted from the streets since he was a child\"You ask me, I ask who to go?\" Liang Ping is not angry. He can even use mandarin duck Dao. Who can use mandarin duck Dao? Most of them are used by Greenwood people!Who the hell is this!No more words, Huang Xiong slowly took out the long sword in the sheath, and nodded slightly to Heyan, \"please give me your advice.\"He Yan thought, how to be \"brother\", even if she was 19 years old in her previous life, she should also call Huang Xiong \"Uncle\". Now Cheng Lishu calls himself big brother. If he follows Cheng Lishu, he should call him uncle Xiao Jue. Now he is called Uncle Xiao Jue, but he is called brother Huang Xiong?Huang Xiong's age can be Xiao Jue's father, which is still a big round!She thought so, the wheat under the stage exclaimed, \"aho brother, be careful\", but saw that Huang Xiong had already rushed over with a knife.The big sword with golden back is popular with the tiger and tiger dancing by the big man. He tilts the knife to the left, moves his right foot slightly, turns around, and cuts it towards Heyan.He Yan is bluffed, crouches down to avoid it. His backhand pushes the other side's blade tip with the back of his knife. The kite knife is in front of him, and the duck knife is behind him. He also approaches Huang Xiong.Huang xiongren is so powerful that he just waves his knife away. He Yan has already thrown it at him. Huang Xiong is leaning away from him. Heyan turns up and takes back the throwing knife. The two stepped back in a standoff, staring at each other.Huang Xiong is not Jiang Jiao. Jiang Jiao is still young. Huang Xiong's Dao has been with him for 30 years, and people and Dao have already formed a perfect tacit understanding. At the time of the fight, Heyan had already learned that this man's skill was above her.We must make a quick decision, otherwise we will have to fight in the face. Heyan thought.Huang Xiong's heart is also full of trouble. Over the years, thousands of people have fought with him, both good and bad. But how old was this young man? Just then he threw his knife and took it, which made him run smoothly and smoothly. How did he do it? He started using knives when he was three?He Yan thought that Huang Xiong was a big man with a fierce but clumsy sword. He was not flexible enough. In this way, it is just right to choose Yuanyang Dao. In this way, it can be broken from \"fast\".Her eyes moved and she said, \"go on!\" He went forward.Huang Xiong holds the knife in his right hand, and takes a left step obliquely, stabbing at Heyan with a single knife.He Yan Yuan Dao stabs in and joins him. Although she looks small, her strength is not weak. The two knives are glued together, but he Yan still has a knife. She took a flower with her other knife, bent her elbow, padded the back of the knife, went over her head, and waved a thorn at Huang Xiong.Huang Xiong couldn't escape, and a corner of his clothes was cut off. Under the stage of the martial arts arena, there was a burst of screams.From this moment on, people found that he Yan's movement began to become faster.Her footwork is extremely flexible. One knife is wrapped around Huang Xiong's golden back sword, and the other is like a snake waiting for an opportunity. Although Huang Xiong has not been stabbed by her, he can never get a bargain. The single Sabre is fierce, and the two sabres are dexterous. It overcomes the strong with softness and overcomes the strong with weakness.\"You just asked me to teach you. I remember that we have a song formula for double swords,\" she had time to speak. \"I'll read it to you.\"Huang Xiong is stunned. She throws a sharp knife at every point.\"Shuofeng has two arms in June, and it is still intended to be used as one.\" She held a long sword on her left and right, and her posture was rustling.\"Before my eyes, my two arms curled around each other, and then I got a sword in Yuyang.\" It's hard to see the young man's manner when he is dancing with long swords. Only his smiling voice can be heard.\"One hand alone, as fast as electricity, only through the beat position has been introduced.\" Step by step, but not disorderly.\"It is known that the sabres in the past were not used at all, and they were used together, so they were trivial.\" The knife sweeps towards Huang Xiong's neck, and is narrowly avoided by Huang Xiong.\"Now I use the right sword in sword technique, but I use the left one to get the beat position.\" One left and one right, she used it skillfully and freely. She felt that the knife was her hand and her hand was like a blade.In the martial arts arena, she read and dance. Corresponding to the slow sound, it is the action as fast as lightning.The sound of the clash of knives and knives only makes people's hearts clench into a group.Cheng Lishu several people came to see this scene.\"Uncle, you see, I said that my elder brother will win He exclaimed excitedly.When someone recognized Xiao Jue, he cried out excitedly: \"it's the governor, commander Xiao, general Fengyun coming to the arena!\"General Feng Yun?So, the eyes of the recruits were immediately attracted by Xiao Jue. The noise spread to the martial arts arena, he Yan's ears moved, Xiao Jue?She looked sideways and saw that Xiao Jue was standing next to Shen Han and Cheng Lishu not far from the stage.The young man was dressed in blue and dark gauze with a crane's deep clothes. His demeanor was beautiful and his eyes were picturesque. He didn't look like a picture of the recruits in the martial arts field. This box is rough and deep, and his room is bright and clear. Separated too far, he Yan can not see his expression clearly, think is also a pair of indifferent kaolin flower appearance.I didn't expect that Xiao Jue would come to see her in person. Does this mean that her good performance of setting up a local arena yesterday has finally reached the ears of those who should be passed on. Did Xiao Jue notice that she was such an outstanding talent?\"Big brother, be careful!\" As she pondered, Cheng Lisu's exclamation sounded in her ear. Looking up, she saw the golden back sword in front of her.www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The curtain fell in the eyes of all the audience, and they were filled with exclamations.Liang Ping couldn't help but blurt out, \"be careful!\"Knife skill is different from spear. The long spear is more dangerous than the bow and crossbow competition, and the knife skill is more dangerous than the long spear competition. If you are not careful, you will bleed. Moreover, Huang Xiong is too strong. If you can't hold the knife, something will happen.This kid is careless on weekdays. How can he be distracted? Liang Ping was anxious. He was distracted from the sword, but he was afraid of it!Huang Xiong saw the opportunity to take advantage of this moment, and immediately slashed it. However, seeing that he Yan could not be avoided, he was about to be pointed at the neck by a knife. The young man suddenly raised his head and felt a sly smile.It's too bad. Huang Xiong says in his heart that he has to stop his hand. At the next moment, he Yan's left hand knife has already reached his long Dao, and his right hand knife has already wound behind him. Huang Xiong was flustered and bent to avoid it. However, he saw that the boy's smile was bigger. When he closed his hand, both the left and right knives were in his hands. Yuan Yang and his two swords make a knife and cut Huang Xiong's head. Huang Xiong wants to reach out and block it. It's already a step too late.The blade of the knife stopped in front of his forehead, but because of the sharp light, it broke a small wound on his forehead and shed a trace of blood.There was a complete silence.After a while, he Yan received the knife and pinned it to his side. He took out a crumpled Papi and handed it to him, \"please.\"Huang Xiong looked at Heyan's handkerchief and didn't go to pick it up. Instead, he asked, \"you just did not distract yourself. Are you cheating?\"\"There is no fraud in war.\" He Yan said with a smile, \"what do you say?\"Of course, she can't be more focused than at any time. Just don't say it was Xiao Jue. Even if the emperor came, she would not waver. However, Huang Xiong's Sabre technique is excellent, and she is not good at using it. If she doesn't need some means, how can she win so easily? However, he deliberately made a mistake and led Huang Xiong to the bait, but a mantis came to catch the cicada, and the Yellow finch was in the back.So she's smart. Xiao Jue probably would not have thought that the \"stupid\" people he evaluated in those days had learned to use wisdom and be clever. At the thought of this, he Yan looked down to the stage to see if Xiao Jue was looking at himself with adoration. Who knows this, where there is the shadow of Xiao Jue, and Shen Han also disappeared, only one Cheng Lishu excitedly waved to her, waving his hair band.He just left? He Yan stayed for a while.Did he see his own demeanor?Before she could figure it out, a large number of people \"Hula\" surrounded her. She made such a show today, and half of the recruits in Liangzhou Wei were completely convinced by her. Bows and crossbows, spears and knives are so exquisite that they can stand out from the crowd. However, half of the people were even more disgusted with her arrogant appearance, and only said, \"it's not right to use intrigue only. It's because you know you're not as good as your opponent that you want to cheat.\"\"That only shows that they are smart!\" Some people retorted.Wang Bahun went out in the recruits. His heart was complicated and hard to understand. On the one hand, he hoped that he Yan would always win, which showed that he Yan was a real strong man. Lost in the hands of a strong, justifiable, after all, the whole Liangzhou Wei, have not been able to beat him.But on the other hand, Wang BA was very unwilling. Why did he lose so many people to Heyan? No one else needed to shout. He had to call Heyan \"boss\" alone.Why!But when I think about it, Huang Xiong, who was in his forties, lost to a 16-year-old boy. It seemed that he was a little more miserable than himself. Thinking of this, Wang Ba felt a little more comfortable and vomited out a cloud.\u2026\u2026In the woods at the foot of Baiyue mountain in Liangzhou station, they are walking slowly.The trees and plants in the forest are dense, so it is cool and smooth to cover the sunlight. There are also birds chirping, only the scenery, Baiyue mountain alone is good.\"You've just seen the martial arts competition,\" Xiao Jue said. \"What do you think?\"Shen Han thought about it carefully, thought it over and over, and then he said, \"Liang Ping has recovered a good soldier. Heyan is a good seedling. Only crossbow, spear and knife are rare talents to do so. It's not easy for him to do everything like this. There is no second recruit in the Liangzhou garrison. \"\"How about the knife technique?\" Xiao Jue asked again.\"It seems that he Yan's Sabre technique is not as skillful as Huang Xiong's. He is more skillful in his footwork, more active in his mind, and more skillful in using tactics.\" Shen Han replied.He Yan's shortcomings are very obvious, if this competition drags on a cup of tea, he Yan will surely fall behind. He probably knew this himself, so he pretended to be distracted and attracted Huang Xiong's impulse to fight, but he defeated Huang Xiong.\"What do you think of his joining the nine flag camp?\" Xiao Jue's careless way.\"At a young age, he is resourceful and does not show his bravery. He is skillful in bowing and horse riding. He has excellent martial arts and is said to be literate. If you want to find them from these recruits, he should be the right one. \" Shen Han said cautiously.\"You think so?\" Xiao Jue turned around, in a noncommittal tone.Shen Han looked at the young man's face. The young governor of the Xiao family was always angry and happy. At the moment, he looked calm and could not see anything. However, Shen Han felt that he did not seem to agree with his view.\"Governor But what's wrong with him? \"\"This man, there's a problem.\" Xiao Jue road.Shen Han was stunned.\"He is not very skilled in Sabre fighting today, but his footwork is the footwork trained by infantry in charge camp.\"When the infantry of charge battalion go to the battlefield, they rush in the front at any time. Because they may die, their footwork is extremely flexible. When he Yan compared with Huang Xiong, he was not as good as Huang Xiong, but he dodged every knife. That kind of subconscious retreat Dodge, he can see at a glance is from the Stormtrooper. He Yan probably realized that he was afraid of being found out by others, so he tried to mend his ways. However, subconscious behavior, sometimes will not always remember.\"This This... \" Shen Han said, \"how can this be possible? He's only sixteen. Has he been on the battlefield before\"It's impossible that's why he has problems.\" Xiao Jue road.Now the situation is tense, Shen Han must be cautious. He hesitated for a moment and asked Xiao Jue, \"governor, what should we do now?\"\"I'll try this man.\" Xiao Jue replied.\"How is the governor going to try?\"\"He doesn't set up a challenge arena in the martial arts arena, one game a day and one victory in every field. Tomorrow you choose three coaches to compete with himShen Han was stunned and hesitated for a moment, \"isn't that good? If he wins... \" If he Yan wins, the recruits can't even compare with their coach.Xiao Jue stopped and said, \"if he wins, there must be something wrong with him.\"\"There will be no such genius in the world. Even if there is, it will not appear in liangzhouwei.\"www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He did not know how many people had promised to teach them the art of knife until midnight. Because it's too late today, I don't plan to go to the training ground at night.Wheat lay facing her with a hand on the back of her head. His eyes were shining and he said to her, \"ah Ho, it's really magnificent today.\"\"You say,\" He Yan pondered for a while and said, \"when I compared swords with Uncle Huang today, did Xiao Dudu finish reading it?\"She was still thinking about Xiao Jue in the daytime. She had such a delicate Sabre technique that Xiao Jue left without reading it? Why not spend some time on her? Maybe it is because Xiao Jue thinks that her Sabre skill is very ordinary and not worth paying attention to?\"Eh?\" Wheat didn't expect Heyan to ask about it. He tried to recall it for a while, and then he said, \"the governor came for a while and left again, but you are too nervous at the last moment of the sword. We all look at you and don't see when the governor left. We should Have you finished watching itHe Yan turned over.\"Ahoga, do you want the governor to see it?\" Asked wheat.\"Naturally, I want to learn civil and military skills and sell them to the emperor's house. I had to sell it first. He didn't even look at it. How could he know that I was the first in LiangzhouXianghongshan's slow voice came, \"now your reputation as the number one in Liangzhou has been well known. Don't worry, there will be people looking for you to compare this and that in a few days. This kind of opportunity is innumerable, and there will always be time for governor Xiao to see it.\"That's good, he Yan thought, closing his eyes.\u2026\u2026The next morning, just after the weight-bearing run, Liang Ping came to Heyan and said, \"come here.\"He Yan didn't know why, so he followed him to the long road behind the arena, and saw two people leading three horses. The two men, he Yan, also remember their faces. They were both the head of Liangzhou health station. One of them was Du Mao, who often came to talk to Liang Ping. The other was a small old man with gray hair, named Ma Damei.\"Coach Liang, this is...\" He Yan didn't understand. He asked her to be a coach because she was excellent? How can recruits be instructors? Promotion is not like this. Besides, she doesn't want to be a coach in liangzhouwei!Fortunately, Liang Ping's words let her down.Liang Ping said, \"you didn't say on the stage the day before yesterday that you can take on any challenge in Liangzhou Weili. One game a day, one victory in each field?\"Although he Yan didn't understand what he meant, he nodded and said, \"not bad.\"\"Today we three will compete with you on horseback and shoot.\" Du Mao stepped forward and handed the reins of the horse to Heyan's hand, \"now compare!\"\"Ah?\" He Yan was surprised, \"do you compare with me?\"She set up a challenge arena to be famous among the recruits. She didn't want to be a coach. What's going on with these coaches? They are not young men. How can they compete with her? Is there a conspiracy?Her wary eyes fell on several people's eyes, and Ma Damei, a thin old man with gray hair, said with a smile: \"what's the matter? Young man, do you dare not compare with us? I thought you were a brave man, but I was afraid of that? \"Ma Damei laughed and her face was full of wrinkles, but it was not ugly. Instead, she was as kind as her elders. However, he Yan also knew that he was not as kind as he was on the surface. Listening to these words, every word was a stirring general. It's just that if she doesn't go, she'll have a reputation of being timid. Xiao Jue, who can't tolerate sand in her eyes, will not let her go to Jiuqi camp.Thinking of this, she would smile heartily, \"how can? I'm just afraid of being humiliated in front of the teachers, and I'm hesitant. Since you are willing to teach me, how dare you be disrespectful. It's a contest, a match. \"Liang Ping looked at each other, nodded and said, \"good!\"He Yan has now become a celebrity of Liangzhou Wei, but if there is a disturbance, it is well known. As soon as the three coaches wanted to compete with Heyan in riding and shooting, all the recruits immediately went crazy and wanted to see it, but they were stopped by their own coach and only allowed to train in the arena.This was naturally arranged by Shen Han. Although Xiao Jue only said he wanted to try Heyan, he could not try it with the reputation of the whole Liangzhou health education leaders. If he Yan wins, will these recruits serve him or his own tutor? It's hard to say.So it's better to hide.The recruits can't go around and watch the excitement. Cheng Lishu, who is not a recruit, can't do it either. He was locked in the room of Liangzhou garrison, and there were guards outside. He couldn't get out.He didn't know that he Yan was going to compete in horse riding and shooting, so he was suddenly shut up. He thought something was wrong with Liangzhou Wei. He beat the door and said, \"what's the matter? Is there a mutiny? Why don't you let me out, uncle? Why do you shut me upOutside came the guard's impassioned voice, \"little childe, the governor said that you have to copy Zhaoming Wenxuan three times before you can go out.\"\"I think you want me dead! Why don't you just kill me? \" Cheng Lishu sat down at the table, three times, he couldn't finish copying for a month!Outside, Shen Han and Xiao Jue are going out.Shen Han looked behind him and said, \"Master Cheng likes Heyan very much. If he Yan really has a problem, will he have another purpose to get in touch with Mr. Cheng? \"\"Very likely.\" Xiao Jue said, \"the nine flag camp is what Cheng Lishu told him.\"Shen Han was silent for a moment and then said, \"if it is, it will be really bad.\"Among the recruits of liangzhouwei, there are people with ulterior motives. Heyan is one of them. He Yan is by no means the only one. If there are others, they are passive. What's more, they knew nothing about it. If it wasn't for Xiao Jue's good health this time, he could see that he Yan's body method was different, and the whole Liangzhou Wei had become the property of others.While they were talking, they had already reached the side of the horse road in the arena. However, he Yan's four men, each holding a horse, stood at the end of the track. First, Liang Ping, then Du Mao, then Ma Damei, and finally Heyan, all of them.He Yan is standing on the most side, her horse is also the smallest, about to take care of her figure, she turned over and mounted the horse skillfully, holding the reins in hand, carrying the arrow barrel and long bow on her back, and she was not like the frail youth that she saw on weekdays.He didn't even have a riding suit. The sun shone on his red vigorous clothes, and his delicate eyebrows and eyes were plated with a special heroic spirit. However, he Yan's lips were smiling, and the appearance of his golden sword and iron horse was just like that of a young general.Shen Han secretly glanced at Xiao Jue on his side. The latter looked lazy and indifferent, and didn't know what he was thinking. However, Shen Han knew that he Yan was a little like him for a moment.www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He said with a smile, \"young man, if you take a stick of incense, you can run around here. This is the origin and the end. There is a grass target at the curve of the horse road ahead. The four of us have different feather arrows. When we shoot arrows at the curve, whoever shoots the arrow first comes back here and wins. \"After listening to this, he Yan nodded his head and said, \"yes.\"Liang Ping couldn't help but look at her. The most common sentence the teenager said was \"yes\". Whether it's Wang Ba, Jiang Jiao or Huang Xiong, it's still \"OK\" to them. I don't know when he'll say \"no\".\"Let's start.\" As soon as Du Mao pulled the reins, someone blew a horn signal behind him, and the four horses were like arrows leaving the string. In a blink of an eye, they ran out more than ten meters away, leaving only a cloud of smoke.The horse that he Yan rode is much more clever than the one he Sui led when she was in the capital school yard. It should have been specially trained. With a little command, the horse could understand. She also noticed that among the other three, Liang Ping and Du Mao had good equestrian skills, but they were not as good as Ma Damei. Ma Damei's skill in controlling the horse is as good as her own. Maybe she is better than herself, but she didn't show it.She was watching the three, and the others were watching her. Du Mao looked at the past and almost didn't stare out his eyes. He Yan didn't even use a whip?She tilted the whip around her arm, directing the horse to run, but gently patted the horse with her hand. This is not the capital childe's sightseeing. What does he mean? The most surprising thing is that he was so casual that he was not left behind by some of their coaches. He even had the heart to smile at him.Don't turn your head at once.Galloping horse, like meteor lightning, blink of an eye has reached the corner. Heyan backhand to the back of the arrow barrel, draw out a few feather arrows, then toward the grass target on both sides of the bow archery.The target is not as big as the one at the other end of the arena. It is only the size of the palm. It is not obvious to see. If you use a bow and crossbow, it is not easy to shoot. It also depends on people's eyesight and movement. When he Yan was about to shoot an arrow, Liang Ping and Du Mao looked at each other. One after the other, they suddenly put forth force. The two horses pushed toward Heyan and pushed his horse to the side. Therefore, the arrow in his hand could not be shot.The horse is frightened, he Yan is bumped a few bumps, busy pull rein to stabilize the body. She looked at Liang Ping and Du Mao. As if nothing had happened, Du Mao even said to her, \"Heyan, you should be careful, don't fall down!\"It's as if they didn't touch her just now.He Yan a pick eyebrows, really, than the test, she never know how to forgive the word. If she was disturbed in archery, how could it be so?Liang Ping and Du Mao had already shot their arrows, but they saw a green arrow darting out of the oblique stab. \"Dong\" cut off their arrows, changed their direction and landed on the ground.They looked at Heyan at the same time. He Yan shrugged his shoulders and said, \"coach, why do you look a little bad at learning?\"Liang Ping:This young man is also too vindictive, his mouth still does not forgive, is really arrogant.He Yan had to build a bow again, but before he pulled out the arrow, he was heavily bumped. The old man Ma Damei had caught up with him from the back and said to Heyan with a smile: \"young man, don't worry. Take your time.\"He Yan can't pull the bow. As long as she moves, the three people will follow from behind, from the front, from the left and right. If nothing happens, \"touch\" her, the horses are often frightened, and she can't aim at the bull's-eye.So many times down, he yansuan also saw that the three coaches were deliberately against her. Although I don't understand why, it's also a part of the competition. If you want her to be unable to shoot, even if you go back to the end of the track, it's not a victory.She is outnumbered and outnumbered. What's more, it's more like archery. She can't fight with these leaders, but that's not what she can do.He Yan's eyes moved and murmured: \"do you want to calculate me? No wayShe suddenly raised her arm, and the whip around her arm responded to the sound and fell in the wind with a crisp sound.\"He is...\" Du Mao frowned. From the beginning to the end, he Yan did not use a whip. It is rare that he can easily control a horse without a whip. But now he Yan does this, she is unable to support, and will start to use the whip again?He was thinking about it. Suddenly he Yan looked up and laughed at himself. Du Mao had a premonition. The next moment, he saw the whip flying towards him. Du Mao was surprised and subconsciously went to hide. He Yan dared to hurt others!On this side, he exposed the arrow barrel behind him.Instead of falling on Du Mao, the whip rolled up a flower and the feather arrow in the quiver. He Yan stretched out his whip and let go of the whip in mid air. So the full arrow fell into the wind.Liang Ping, who witnessed the whole process, was stunned. Before he could react, he Yan's whip had been aimed at him. He was startled and hurried to avoid it. But this time, it was Heyan's turn to shoot. Where could he run? With a pull, all the arrows in his quiver were thrown to the ground.\"Heyan!\" Du Mao's face was livid.\"I think the coaches don't want me to shoot arrows,\" Heyan said with a smile, as if he didn't see his ugly face. \"But I don't want to lose either. There's no way. Everyone should stop shooting arrows. Whoever runs fast will win?\"\"Ha ha ha ha ha!\" Behind him came Ma Damei's laughter. He was not nervous and angry at all. Instead, he was full of interest. \"You little guy is very smart. Don't know if you can take my arrow?\"He Yan tiny smile, \"how can? I'm not going to take your arrows. \"Ma Damei's equestrian skills are excellent. It's hard for her to get rid of his arrows. However, it doesn't matter. As long as he crosses this curve and has no target to shoot, he can only compete with himself to reach the destination first.She and Ma Damei go hand in hand. She shoots, Ma Damei shoots to block, Ma Damei shoots and Heyan shoots to stop. They have left Liang Ping and Du Mao behind. No one can compare with each other, so they pass the last bend in the glue.Everyone didn't hit the target. Well, now we can only fight for who gets to the end first.Ma Damei looked at Heyan and said with a smile, \"young man, you are really good.\" As soon as he waved his whip, the horses ran forward.

It's hard to say who will arrive at the destination first.Liang Ping and Du Mao have already given up. They know that their equestrian skills are not as good as those in front of them, and they can't keep up with them. They just stroll around in the back slowly. Anyway, they have fulfilled the requirements of general manager Shen.Head coach Shen called them out last night and asked them to compete with Heyan today. At first, Liang Ping and Du Maoqi refused, but they were not new recruits, so they compared with Heyan. However, the head coach had to ask them to do this. He also asked them to make trouble for Heyan as much as possible on the way of riding and shooting, so as not to let him win.Liang Ping has a bad taste in his heart. If he wants to compete with Heyan, he can't win. Isn't this unfair? Compared with the recruits, their coach was a bully, and the three of them joined hands to deal with Heyan, which was the best bully.Who knows that human calculation is not as good as heaven's calculation, not to mention the three. Anyway, he and Du Mao did not bully Heyan, but were bullied by Heyan. It's thanks to the recruits who didn't see it. If they did, where would the old faces go?However, among the three of them, Ma Damei is the best equestrian player. I don't know how he Yan compares with him?In the distance, you can see the red silk on the flag pole at the end.He Yan pulls the reins, and the horses come forward, surpassing Ma Damei by half a step.She wants to rush to the end, but at this time, Ma Damei drinks \"little guy\", and Heyan subconsciously looks at him. However, seeing that the little old man was half upright with his feet on the horse's back, she praised it in her heart. Then, the old man gave her a smile and turned over and stole at Heyan's head.He Yan's heart was startled, and he rode to avoid it. The old man was like a bat fly with wings. Half of his body was already on his horse. He also shriveled his mouth and accused Heyan of riding the horse to avoid the action, \"young man, young man, how so unkind, want to fall to death me.\"He Yan wants to push him down, but the man has already occupied the magpie's nest and firmly holds the reins in his hand. He slaps Heyan and wants to beat him down.This man I'm really confident in her, and I'm not afraid of her falling down? He Yan heart stomach Fei, and he fought two moves, each other did not get cheap.Ma Damei was also surprised. Each of the dozens of coaches in liangzhouwei had his own strengths. Some are good at bows and crossbows, others are good at walking around. His best skill is riding and shooting. Yesterday, Shen Han asked him to compete with Heyan today. At first, he thought Shen Han was crazy. Now, it seems that the boy named Heyan has greatly exceeded his expectation.It is difficult for all the skillful riders to get rid of the skillful archers. At the moment, the two moves to fight with themselves are not disorderly at all, as if they often fight with people in crisis, very calm.He Yan did not show that calm. The coach of liangzhouwei doesn't just know how to eat and do nothing. This old man is really difficult to deal with. Her purpose is not to fight with each other, but to rush through the end and consume it here. Even though the horse runs to the end, she and the old man are on the horse. Who wins?It's treacherous.As soon as she looked up, she was also smiling, but she did not see any displeasure. \"Although I am young, I also know how to respect my elders. If you ride with me at such a big age, I will be absolutely responsible for the fall. I'd better change horses. \" As she spoke, she leaned out and grasped the iron ring on the saddle with only two hands and leaned against the horse to let go.This hand is really beautiful, and Ma Damei can't help but brighten her eyes. He Yan grabs the iron ring in one hand, and the whip in the other hand rolls up Ma Damei's empty horse not far away. When the two horses approached, Heyan let go of his hand, jumped on the other horse half way, grabbed the reins and turned over again.\"Good! Good! Good Ma Damei said three \"good\" in a row, and looked at Heyan's eyes without concealing his appreciation, but he said with a smile: \"but you think you win this way, or it's too tender.\"Before the words fell, the horse under Heyan struggled violently and refused to go forward. Instead, he was in a state of madness.\"This is my own horse. You are good at horsemanship, young man. But you can't control the master's horse.\"He laughs, as if he Yan's move, hit him, just waiting to see Heyan lively.The young man smile, the voice did not see the slightest nervous, calmly replied, \"I'd better try it, in case I can control it again?\"After that, she leaned over, her lips close to the horse's ear, and she didn't know what to murmur about. The horse under her body actually calmed down gradually under her agitation.Ma Damei is stunned, some can't believe her eyes. He has seen thousands of horses, and he will have a simple communication with the horse, but he has not seen a few words with the horse, so that the horse who recognizes the Lord is obedient. There are myths and legends in ancient times. Some people are familiar with the language of animals. Heyan Is that right?He lived so old, but he never believed in any fairy tales.As soon as the boy pulled the reins, the horse galloped away, and Ma Damei quickly followed him, but he had missed the best opportunity in his stupefied Kung Fu. The young man's words are still in the ear, with a bit of color, \"coach, your chance to win me, but that's it!\"\u2026\u2026Shen Li and Ma Jue at the end of the jungle.Shen Han didn't move the tea in the cup, but Xiao Jue drank half of it. He Yan and Ma Damei's fight just now has a good view.Shen Han closed his eyes and a chill rose in his heart.Xiao Jue is right. There is no such a genius in Liangzhou Weili. Each item is the first, comparing all the instructors in the past. This is not a good thing. It seems that It seems to be specially prepared for Liangzhou Wei.Red silk fluttered in the wind, the young man with a horse, such as a wind, across the long line of the end. He stopped his horse and raised a cloud of smoke and dust, followed by Ma Damei, who looked grim and not relaxed.They stopped one after another.He Yan gets off the horse first. After she gets off the horse, Ma Damei also dismounts. She walked to Ma Damei and stopped in front of her.\"I didn't mean to play a trick on the coach just now. It's really forced by the situation. The head coach should not care about me?\" The young man looked nervous.Ma Damei was stunned for a moment and then laughed, \"where the young man says, he should try his best to make every effort.\"A big smile broke out on the young man's face. She wiped the sweat on her forehead, thought for a moment, and then said, \"well, this time, I've accepted.\"She also accepted, that is to say, she won again.www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When they get off the horse at the end, they see a pair of Heyan happily drinking water to quench their thirst, and Ma Damei stands on one side, thinking.In this way, it doesn't look like Ma Damei won.They both thought the same thing, didn't they? Ma Damei can't compare with Heyan?Liang Ping went to Ma Damei, who did not wait for him to open his mouth and said, \"I lost.\"Did you really lose?Liang Ping was surprised, \"how can it be? How could you lose to him? \"Ma Damei is the best one of their coaches in riding and shooting. If Ma Damei can't compare with Heyan, it doesn't mean that the whole liangzhouwei is not better than Heyan in riding skills. He Yan is still learning how to ride and shoot. He can teach himself.\"Did the boy cheat?\" Du Mao asked in a low voice, \"did you catch his way?\" He Yan has just run all his arrows with his whip. Du Mao is really angry when he thinks about it. Look, is it really something recruits can do?Ma Damei glared at him and said, \"I'm not good at skills, OK?\" He went to Heyan and asked him, \"little doll, I want to ask you something.\"\"The coach wants to ask what I said to your horse in the end, so that he will not go mad and listen to me?\" He Yan tightened the water bag. \"If the head coach wants to ask about this matter, it's OK. The ancestral craftsmanship can't be said outside.\" She winked at Ma Damei, then turned to Liang Ping and said, \"coach Liang, if there's nothing wrong, I'll go first, and I'll have to go to the martial arts arena for training.\"Liang Ping waved his hand, but his eyes were not clear.Du Mao looked at her back, a little strange, \"she ran this time, still very energetic, actually still have the strength to practice martial arts training, what kind of person is this?\"\"Different from you and me.\" Liang Ping didn't reply.\u2026\u2026\"Let the governor see the joke.\" Shen Han was embarrassed. All of his coaches were defeated by Heyan's staff, which was still the case when the means were used. It was hard to say that the three people could not compete with each other.\"Nothing. You've done well.\" Xiao Jue drooped her eyes to drink tea, \"this is not to let you go to compare riding and shooting, just try people, now people have tried out.\"\"The governor still thinks there is something wrong with him?\" Shen Han asked.\"Yes.\"\"Because he Yan is too competitive?\" If it is because of this, it can only be regarded as suspicion, without evidence.\"The last move he made just now came from the barbarians.\" Xiao Jue put down her tea cup.\"Barbarians?\" Shen Han stood up at once.The barbarians include Xiqiang, Nanman and today's uto people. At that time, the rebellion of Xiqiang was pacified by general Feihong, and it was Xiao Jue who drove them out in person. Now the uto people are ready to move. The barbarians and the great Wei have always been in the same situation. Even today, the relationship between the Western Qiang and the southern barbarians is delicate, and they dare not be on guard.\"Is she a barbarian?\"\"Not necessarily.\" Xiao Jue shakes his head, \"did you bring the military register?\"General Shen Han's book of records submitted, \"here's Heyan.\"\"Since this person is different, don't make a fuss. Pay attention to his every move and act carefully.\"\"The governor wants to...\"\"If you want to catch a big fish for a long time, you must catch the people behind you.\" He answered without hesitation.After Shen Han left, Xiao Jue turned over his military books and stayed on the page of Heyan for a long time. A moment later, he said, \"flying slave.\"Some people appear quietly after their own, as if a shadow, in a low voice: \"young master.\"\"You ask people to check whether there is a son named Heyan in the he family, the captain of the capital city gate.\"Feinu takes orders and is about to leave when Xiao Jue stops.\"Check again to see if there is any secret contact between the he family and Xu Jingfu.\"\u2026\u2026When he Yan returned to the martial arts arena, there was a large group of people who had already looked forward to it.\"How, how, how did it turn out?\"\"Why don't you see them? Did you win or did the coach win? \"He Yan laughed and said only two words: \"secret.\"This answer obviously can't satisfy everybody's curiosity, but he Yan's mouth is very strict, Leng is unable to pry open. They left bitterly, guessing and commenting.\"Won it? He Yan doesn't look like he lost. \" This is believing in her.\"Now that we have won, why don't you speak out in a big way? If you don't say it, you must lose. I'm afraid of losing face! \"This is not to believe her.\"You can't get the result if you fight and fight. If he Yan doesn't say it, you can find out by asking the head coach.\" This is sober thinking.So when the coach came, everyone rushed to several coaches, who were confused at first. When they heard that they were asking about the results of the competition, they all looked at Heyan. The boy in the way of heart is still kind. He also knows to leave some face to the head coach, but he doesn't expose the bottom. The coaches waved: \"don't ask, it's scattered!\"Still didn't say.When he Yan collapsed in the evening, wheat was still thinking about the result and asked Heyan, \"ah Ho, so what happened to the final result?\"\"It doesn't matter how it turns out.\" He Yan patted the head of wheat, \"the point is that I'm going to bed now.\"She turned over and faced the wall, pointing the back of her head at the wheat. The wheat could not find out the result, so he had to give up.He Yan couldn't sleep. He was always thinking about what happened in the horse road in the daytime. In any case, it's really strange that three coaches suddenly come to her for a trial of riding and shooting. The three of them joined hands to deal with themselves. If they were ordinary recruits, they would certainly be unable to resist. But they didn't seem to consider whether they could stand such a contest. It was not like a challenge, but rather Test, or prove something.In the end, she subdued Ma Damei's horse with the skill she learned from a barbarian captive when she was in the army. The prisoner was specially trained by the other party. His horse training skills were superb, which made them suffer a lot at that time. After he Yan captured him, he was greedy for life and was afraid of death, so he wrote down his precious horse riding skills and gave them to Heyan.However, the skill of controlling horses was too complicated, and he Yan only learned a little. Even so, it is enough to stop ordinary horses. If not today, she will not win Ma Damei.However, if it is really a test, it is no more than the chief instructor or Xiao Jue who can command the head coach of Liangzhou health station. If it is Xiao Jue, what is the purpose? Is he going to pick out the people from the nine flag camp now, so he hastens to ask the head coach to test whether she has the qualifications and means?Is that right? He Yan vaguely felt that he might have been thinking of something wrong, but he really couldn't find any other way of thinking. After thinking about it for a while, I simply didn't want to. As soon as she comes, she will be at ease. In the end, she won't lose this game.www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After the competition, they would also see that they were outstanding and should always make some representations. But more than ten days have passed, and the days are still ordinary. Nothing happened except for the recruits who occasionally came to compete with themselves. He didn't even give the army more than one cup a day.Maybe Just a chance? He Yan thought that maybe it was the boredom of a few coaches in Liangzhou. He wanted to try his own skills.She left the matter behind for a while.After a few rains, the heat seems to be reduced a little bit. Sometimes when I get up and run in the morning, there is no sun and cool wind. Before long, the summer of liangzhouwei will be over.It is also because the weather gradually has a cool momentum, a few days ago, recruits can enter the mountains.Baiyue mountain is very big. It takes at least a day and a night to cross the mountain. Therefore, the recruits were strictly forbidden to climb over the mountain, at most to the top of the mountain. Every day, five people in a team go up the mountain to patrol.Hongshan did not understand, \"what kind of logic do five people patrol? If there is a real danger, are five people enough?\"He Yan thought, of course, is not enough, because it is not for you to patrol.The new recruits stationed in Liangzhou garrison have trained here for a whole summer. Before long, they will fight for the flag.To fight for the flag is to plant more than a dozen flags on the top of the whole mountain, and select the recruits with good qualifications and excellent achievements to be divided into teams and fight for the flag on their own. There may be fights among the squadrons. When the team goes down the mountain at last, the team with the most flags will win. And the final winner will become the most promising recruits and will most likely enter the vanguard camp.He Yan's goal is not today's front camp, but nine flag camp.At present, let the recruits go to the mountains every day. In fact, it means that they can familiarize themselves with the terrain of Baiyue mountain in advance and remember the location, so that they will not be unfamiliar with the road when fighting for the flag. But the recruits didn't know, and he Yan, as a person who had been in the army, knew it.The last time she was fighting for the flag in the desert County, the desert county was connected with the desert. Once the wind blew in the desert, the landmarks disappeared and the sand dunes changed. When they fought for the flag, the situation was very dangerous. If it was not for one of the big brothers in the team who found a small river, no one could walk out of the desert.\"Fighting for the flag\" not only tests the individual skills of the recruits, but also depends on the unity and cooperation among the teams. It's not good to be good at one thing. The test for everyone is high. Although the so-called flag fight is said to be a period of time later, in fact, in a certain way, competition has started from now on. Smart people can remember the way when patrolling, while those who are not aware of it should just turn around casually and will not pay attention to it. They will not help the future \"flag fight\".\"Well, it's your turn to go up the mountain today. Can you hunt some rabbits with bows and arrows? Let's sneak back and roast them. I haven't tasted meat for half a month.\" The wheat licked his lips.\"I don't take a crossbow,\" He Yan laughed. \"The crossbow is too heavy. I'll take a knife.\" The most important thing is that the crossbow is not suitable for close combat. If there is any problem, it will not work well. In addition, there will always be people with bows and crossbows in a team, so just borrow them.Seeing wheat's face regretful, she comforted again: \"it's OK. In a few days, we can go up the mountain together, and hunt rabbits as much as they want.\"Wheat is skeptical.He Yan couldn't tell him that when fighting for the flag, everyone was on the mountain, and the coach was not there. He could not even spend the night on the mountain. Naturally, he wanted to eat as much as he wanted.She tied up her belt tightly and heard Hongshan say, \"you go down the mountain early, and we'll celebrate the festival together tonight.\"\"What festival?\" He Yan is at a loss.\"Qixi Festival!\" said wheatHe Yan said:Almost forget, today is the seventh day of July, daughter's day. However, they had a group of men who had a Chinese Valentine's day. Heyan jokingly said, \"it seems that we should spend time with the girl I like? Do you have any girls you like? \"Hongshan immediately said, \"don't look down on people. There are many girls who like your brother Shan. If you want to think about Tanabata, girls will be happy.\"\"I I didn't, \"wheat said quickly,\" but my brother has! My brother likes sister Xiaolan in the noodle shop opened by Uncle sun in the east of the city! \"Stone:.... \"He Yan looks at the stone, the stone's ear is red to the root of the ear. Wheat asked again, \"aho, do you have a girl you like? What kind of girl do you likeHe Yan casually said: \"good looking, smart brain, excellent skills, rich money, by the way, temperament should be gentle and considerate, lively and interesting. You'd better be good at playing piano, chess, calligraphy and painting. It's better to be able to cook. \"After he Yan left, the wheat still chewed on his words and murmured: \"ah ho brother's demands on his sweetheart are really high...\"\"Listen to his nonsense,\" Hongshan nodded his head, \"he wants to Shang princess, wheat, don't learn from him!\"Wheat nodded solemnly.\u2026\u2026He Yan first took a mandarin duck sword on the weapon rack of the martial arts arena. Since she defeated Huang Xiong's golden back dagger with Yuanyang Dao, some people practiced it every day. However, they were not as flexible as Heyan in practicing mandarin duck swords. After practicing for several times, they felt that they were not suitable for themselves, so they gave up. Therefore, yuan he was almost used in the martial arts.When she went up the mountain today, she took the knife easily. If she wanted to make a fire on the mountain and roast two fish temporarily, it would be easy to kill fish.She took the knife and went to the end of the track. The other four were ready.He Yan, the four men, did not know each other. When he saw him, one of them pointed to him with a smile, \"go pick the horse and we'll go.\"He Yan nods, she goes to the stable to pick a horse, five people go up to the white moon mountain together.The mountains are densely covered with forests, shading the sun. It is much cooler and more comfortable to walk than at the foot of the mountain. On both sides there were rabbits skipping by. Some people asked, \"how about hunting some rabbits?\"\"Good, good,\" the new soldier who said hello to Heyan said, \"who brought a bow and crossbow?\"The crowd looked at each other.It was about that the crossbow was too heavy, and he had to stay on the mountain for more than half a day. No one wanted to bring it, so no one took it.\"Well, I didn't take it,\" a new soldier with a hanging tip eye shrugged, his tone was not very good, but his eyes were looking at Heyan. \"That's all we can do.\"Everyone knows that he Yan's archery is superior to others. He probably thought he would take it.He Yan looks back at him calmly.Let general Feihong hunt rabbits for you. Do you have any brains? It's a big face.

The mountain stream rises the misty white fog, looks at the past, the emerald color encircles. Spring light and cloud, winding around the train, the peaks, towering up, as if fairyland.He was very clever. He took some yellow paper with him. When he got to a place, he sketched a few steps on the yellow paper with charcoal, which was a way to remember. Every other way, people should make a mark on the tree, so as not to get lost and not know how to go back down the mountain.Because everyone didn't have a bow and crossbow, they walked very quietly all the way. They set out in the morning and climbed to the top after noon.We all tied their horses to the trees. There was a stream nearby, so we could have a rest by the stream. After eating dry food and enough physical strength, you can go down the mountain and go back to the guard station before the sun sets.The new soldier who said hello to Heyan was not very strong. When he climbed to the top, he collapsed on the ground. Can't wait to take out from the arms of dry food to fill the stomach, while muttering: \"can calculate to the top, go again I can't walk.\"He Yan washed the handle by the stream, sat down under the stone beside him, and took out the dry food.The dry food is dry cake sent in the morning. It is dry and hard. The new soldier comes over and takes out a handful of pine nuts from his pocket and hands it to Heyan and says, \"here you are.\"He Yan was surprised, \"where did this come from?\"\"Before I came to Liangzhou Wei, my mother installed it for me. I couldn't bear to eat it at one breath and save it.\" He was not willing to give up, but also pretended to be generous, \"try it!\"He Yan picked up a grain from his palm, peeled it off and threw it into his mouth, saying, \"it's very fragrant.\"\"Is that right?\" The child was a little happy. \"My name is Shen Hong. I know you, Heyan. You were so good in the martial arts arena before. Everyone couldn't beat you.\"\"Luck, luck.\" He Yan said with a smile.Shen Hong looked at the distance and felt rather sorry, \"it's a pity that I didn't bring a crossbow. I didn't know you went with us. If I know, I'll definitely bring one. You're so good at archery. If you hit a few rabbits with a crossbow, we can eat roast rabbits. \"He and Mai Mai are not half brothers? He Yan thought, casually asked, \"what weapons do you bring?\"Shen Hong was embarrassed to grab the back of the head, \"me? I'm not good at archery. It's no use carrying a bow and crossbow. The skill of knife is not so bad, and the skill of spear is also I didn't think I could be of any use, so I took one... \" He pulled out a long stick from behind. \"A handful of this.\"He Yan was speechless.He actually brought a stick, not an iron headed stick, but a long stick cut from bamboo. Is there such a weapon on the weapon rack in the arena? He Yan doubted that Shen Hong's stick would not be of any use. Oh, unless there is a jujube tree here, he can beat dates with this stick.As if to see he Yan's speechless, Shen Hong hastened to remedy, \"in any case, will not start with people.\"He Yan nodded: \"you are right.\"She and Shen Hong are here. Diaoyuan and the other two are sitting on the other side slightly away from them. After eating, Heyan rests against the tree for a while. Shen Hong carefully asks her, \"that, Heyan, can I borrow your knife?\"\"What's the matter?\"\"Did you see that one?\" Shen Hong pointed to a green leaf beside the stream. The leaves were long and thin, and could not see what grass it was. He said: \"our family has a medicine shop. This one is called shudaicao. It looks like\" Xiebao \"but not\" Xiebao \". It can be eye-catching and soothing. I want to pick some back. We are here all day. Maybe we can use it. However, the book with grass is extremely tough, and it is not easy to pick. They bring either long knives or guns. It is not as easy to use as your knife. \"She used her knife as a sickle.He Yan said All right She took out the mandarin duck knife from her waist and handed it to Shen Hong, saying, \"be careful.\"Shen Hong put down the stick in his hand and happily took the knife. He said to Heyan, \"thank you. I'll cut more. I'll give you one.\"He Yan wanted to say no, but he thought about it. He thought that maybe he could use it. Hong Shan said that he was hot and restless, and he couldn't sleep well. Besides, Shen Hong was so intent that he would not have to swallow two words back into his stomach.She leans under the tree to see Shen Hong busy.Looking at it, I suddenly heard something behind me. He Yan was stunned and asked, \"is this going to go? Don't take a little more rest? \"All in all, they have been here for less than half an hour. It's still early, and there's more time to go down the mountain.Diaoziao seems not to like Heyan, and he is impatient to talk to her, \"if you don't go down the mountain, let's go to the front for a walk.\"He Yan took a look at the front. Now it is the top of the mountain. To go to the front, he is to turn over the mountain. She frowned, \"the coach said you can't cross the mountain.\"\"Just take two more steps and don't turn over,\" he said. \"You didn't follow me. You stayed here. We'll come back later.\"\"I think,\" He Yan stood up, \"it's better to listen to the instructor's words, maybe there is any danger.\"\"Zheng Xuan, are you going or not?\" Another person has already untied the horse rope, turned on the horse, urged.\"If you are afraid of danger, you don't go. Besides, heaven knows the earth, you know me. As long as you don't say it, who will know? Don't worry about it. Mow the grass with that fool! Let's go first. \" After saying that, he did not care about Heyan. He turned himself on his horse and walked with the other two people to the deep forest.He Yan wanted to catch up with him, but he couldn't let Shen Hong go here. As he thought about it, the three men had gone far away. She sighed and sat down again under the tree, but they didn't find anything wrong all the way up the mountain. There were no people in the mountain, nor any big beasts. At most, a few civet badgers and wild cats, when they saw people, ran away from them.After a cup of tea, Shen Hong came from the stream with a bundle of grass in his hands. It is really shaped like a book belt, long and soft, close to smell there is a fragrance. Shen Hong found the longest one, tied the two piles of books with straw, and handed it to Heyan. \"This is it. Go back and dry it in the sun. Find a cloth bag and put it under the pillow to keep the sleeping incense.\"He Yan said, \"thank you very much.\"\"It doesn't matter\" Shen Hong waved his hand, which found that several other people were missing. He said strangely, \"where are they?\"\"Go for a walk.\" He Yan shrugged, \"just wait for them to come back here.\"Shen Hong didn't understand. She was about to ask. Suddenly, she heard a scream from the depths of the jungle. She was one of the recruits who had just joined them.He Yan a Zheng, eyebrows frown, the next moment, then untie the rope on the horse, straight to the voice and go.www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He Yan stops in front of the miscellaneous trees.Zheng Xuan's face turned white, and the other two were more than ready to shed tears.Around the three, four wolves crouched down and howled at them. When he and Yan came, the wolves looked at him with a fierce look.This season, this time, how can there be wolves? He Yan is a little strange.He Yan also noticed that the knife in Zheng Xuan's waist was missing. Wolves will attack the lonely, but not the three for no reason. He Yan asked, \"what have you done?\"Zheng Xuan's face was white and he didn't speak. The recruit behind him opened his mouth with a cry, \"we, we went to the front and saw a cave in the ground with a cry in it. We went in to see that there was a litter of wolf cubs in it...\"\"Did you move the wolf cubs?\" He Yan asked in a sharp voice.She was so quick and fierce that she startled the recruits and quickly replied, \"no, no, we just want to take them back and raise them. After walking for a long time, we saw these wolves.\"He Yan simply wanted to pry these people's brains open to see what was inside. Seeing the wolf's nest means that the mother wolf is nearby. If you don't leave quickly, you still take away the wolf's cubs. Do you really think that the adult wolf will not follow the smell?\"Where's the wolf cub?\" He Yan asked.\u201c\u2026\u2026 We were so scared that we threw the wolf cubs back to them, but\"Just what?\" In the heart of Heyan, a bad premonition suddenly arose.\"It's just that one fell on the top of the stone, as if dead.\" That's humane.\"You He Yan was very angry. The wolves will not leave.\"What are you yelling at?\" Zheng Xuan was angry, \"are not just a few wolves? Kill it! How many animals will people be forced to death? \"He Yan sneered, \"is it? What about your knifeZheng Xuan's face was even worse. After he killed the wolf cub, he once drew a knife to confront the wolves. However, the wolves were cunning. He was good at swordsmanship, but under tension, he was almost injured by the wolf. In a hurry, he even lost his knife. Otherwise, we would not face such a desperate situation now.\"Don't talk nonsense. Now you have to die together or find a way.\" He forced a few words out of his teeth.Just as he was saying, Shen Hong also arrived at the scene. Seeing this, he was startled. His voice immediately trembled, \"good, many wolves! How could there be so many wolves? \"The wolf pack has bowed down, showing its fangs, which is a sign of attack.If there is a fire fold is OK, the wolf is afraid of fire, but they come out in the daytime, they have not brought it, it is not right now. Just think of here, the four wolves together toward the three people around.The three of them screamed in panic. One of them was bitten on his leg and nearly fell off. Shen Hong almost cried, \"help!\"What's the use of calling for help now? There's no one else here. He Yan's heart is horizontal, and he rushes in with his horse. With this rush, she broke up the encirclement of the wolf just now. When several wolves saw her, they rushed to her.He Yan urged: \"where are your guns? Take it out\"Oh, oh.\" The two recruits woke up like a dream, and then they thought of their long guns. They took them out and waved them randomly. They could not hold them firmly. He Yan's heart suddenly cooled into a piece.It's impossible to count on these people. He Yan wanted to touch the knife, only to remember that his knife had been borrowed by Shen Hong. There was only a long bamboo stick on his body. She said, \"Shen Hong, throw my knife over here!\"Shen Hong gave a reply. He pulled out the knife and threw it. But he was too nervous. He even confiscated the knife. The long sword fell out in the air. Only a short knife was inserted into the scabbard, which was thrown into the air and collected by Heyan.The wolves were around them waiting for an opportunity. He Yan said, \"when I let you run, you can run back. Don't worry about anything. Run down the mountain and run all the way to the camp. Let the coaches come up. Do you know?\"\"What about you?\" Shen Hong asked\"I have a way to get rid of them!\"\"Heyan, how can we run,\" sobbed the new soldier beside Zheng Xuan: \"we are surrounded, they will bite the horse leg, bite off the horse leg, we can't walk away...\"\"It's not impossible.\" He Yan said this sentence, the knife in his hand suddenly flew out, the duck knife was small, she was swift and violent, in the blink of an eye, people saw the silver flash, a sudden howl, the blood will suddenly flow out.The biggest wolf fell to the ground with blood blisters coming out of his throat. A knife didn't go in at all, leaving only the handle outside. The wolf struggled a few times, and then he was no longer angry.\"Run!\" He Yan had a big drink.Zheng Xuan and Shen Hong didn't dare to come out. They immediately drank a \"drive\" and drove their horses out of the dense forest with all their strength. They thought that the remaining wolves would come after them, and they did not dare to return their heads. In a blink of an eye, they disappeared.The rest of the wolves did not chase after him. They were in a panic for a moment and then looked at Heyan with fierce eyes.He Yan killed the wolf.Wolves are gregarious animals. Among these wolves, the biggest one is their leader. They listen to the command of the wolf, he Yan killed them, they have no head, not as clever as the group. But also, as the price of killing the turning wolf, she will face the Revenge of these wolves.A wolf showed the dense white teeth to her, sharp claws and teeth can tear the human head. He Yan's horizontal stick swept hard in front of his body, and rolled the wolf forward and threw himself into the air.\"Hiss\" the sound, the extremely slight sound, he Yan ear strength is astonishing, hears then in the heart sink.This bamboo cut stick has cracks. It may not hold up for several times and will break.\"What bad luck!\" She swore in a low voice. It was only three wolves. She could deal with it alone. But now she had no weapon except this broken stick. It's really true that a wen can't defeat a hero? No, there is no double blessing.People can't be forced to die by animals. She thought of Zheng Xuan's words and laughed.On the battlefield, in addition to taking the initiative to attack, in fact, she is also good at running away.\"Run away!\"The girl's voice resounded through the mountains and forests, startling countless birds. The long stick seemed to have infinite power, and it cut straight ahead and made an open road.She drove away with a long stick in her horse as if to disappear into the distant forest.After the wolf chase, fish swim in boiling water, no time to hair.www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I don't know how long it ran. The horse stopped.Shen Hong was holding the horse's belly. They ran open. The mountain road was bumpy and they didn't dare to stop. Until now, they felt that they were in a state of tumult and almost vomiting.He has already run to the middle of the mountain. Looking back, there is no shadow of the wolf catching up.A new recruit said, \"yes, it's saved.\"Shen Hong looks at his waist blankly. When he comes, he grabs a bamboo stick. Now he gives it to Heyan. When he remembers Heyan, his face turns pale again and he trembles and asks in a trembling voice What about Heyan? \"There is only a bamboo stick. Shen Hong has lost one of the only mandarin duck knives. The other is inserted in the wolf's throat. Heyan has no weapons. The three wolves are fierce. How can he hide by himself?\"Shall we go back and have a look?\" He mustered up courage.\"What nonsense are you talking about,\" Zheng Xuan looked at him coldly. \"Those wolves are there, and we can hardly get out and go back to die?\"\"But he Yan is behind. He can't do it alone.\" When Shen Hong thought of Heyan, his eyes turned red. He thought he Yan was a good man. They were still eating pine nuts together.\"Didn't he ask us to go down the mountain to find the coach?\" \"Let's go down the mountain and tell the coach to save people,\" said the new soldier\"No way.\"Shen Hong looked at Zheng Xuan in disbelief. Zheng Xuan's face did not change. \"If you tell the coach, the coach will know that we have crossed the mountain.\"\"He just saved us. If it wasn't for Heyan, we would have been dead!\" Shen Hong said in a high voice.\"No doubt, we'll all die when we're dealing with wolves.\" Zheng Xuan's voice was higher than Shen Hong's, \"crossing the mountain is a violation of military orders. If it's light, it's a stick's responsibility; if it's heavy, it's head landing. Is it necessary to let others die for a dead Heyan! Shen Hong, do you want to do this? \"Shen Hong is stunned by the roar. He was timid and timid. If he hadn't been in trouble at home, he would have been a pharmacist all his life. Now, when things happen suddenly, I feel flustered. When I hear that Xu Hui's head falls to the ground, I feel chilly.His family still has a mother to serve. If he dies and there is no man in the family, how can the whole family live?\"I I... \" Shen Hong was unable to speak.\"After going down the mountain, when nothing happened, when the sun went down, he told the instructor that he Yan did not listen to people's dissuasion and climbed over the mountain, but could not find it everywhere.\" Zheng Xuan had no feelings.This is not only to block his last life, but also to charge him with violating military orders. Shen Hong shakes her head, but the other two people are already worried about their punishment, so they accept. Zheng Xuan stares at Shen Hong and says, \"if you want to complain, you can go there. If you want to complain, you will see whether the head coach believes you or us.\"After that, he did not care what Shen Hong looked like, and drove his horse forward. Shen Hong had no choice but to keep up with the mountain.\u2026\u2026It was getting late and there was almost no light in the jungle.The horses lost their way on the white moon mountain. Heyan held the bamboo stick and looked back. He was relieved and finally got rid of the wolves.It was the first time to see such a wild wolf in pursuit. He Yan curled his mouth and thought of the wolf he met in desert county. At that time, there was a famine in Mo County, and all the wolves within a hundred Li radius were caught and eaten. It was not as arrogant as that in Baiyue mountain. With this in mind, I felt that Zheng Xuan's hanging eyes did not have a brain. How could he want to catch wolf cubs? Wolves are animals that can't be tamed. What can be domesticated is domestic dogs that can wag their tails at people, and wolves can only bite people's throats.The horse made a circle and stopped walking.here is as like as two peas in the woods. She just ran away from the wolves and failed to mark the trees. She was afraid that she had already crossed the hill and didn't know where it was. If Shen Hong didn't tell Liang Ping in time, when it was dark, the forest would not be able to go out. There was no huozhezi. They were afraid of meeting wild animals, so they would have to spend the night on the mountain.She thought to herself, sighed, turned over and dismounted to find out if there was any wind proof cave around her. As soon as she got down from the horse, she suddenly felt a little wrong.I can't tell why. What I have to say is probably my intuition about danger after years of fighting on the battlefield. Her subconscious side of the head, then feel a dark shadow from the top of her head, something rubbed her neck, with a trace of blood.The horse is frightened and raises its front hooves. Heyan doesn't tighten the reins. The horse rushes forward without turning back. In a blink of an eye, he disappears in the deep forest. When she looked back, she saw the dark shadow that had just rushed over. She was lying in the grass, showing two blue eyes.It was a wolf just now.He Yan looked at the wolf, and then looked at the direction of its attack, the heart suddenly realized. A few wolves just now, there was a clever one. Knowing that he could not catch up with Heyan, he took a short cut. Baiyue mountain is not Heyan's territory, but it is the territory of mountain animals here. I think it has been lurking for a long time again. When he Yan relaxes his vigilance, he jumps up and bites her throat.In fact, the wolf almost succeeded.He Yan touched his neck, hot feeling, stained with a hand of blood. The wolf saw that a blow failed, showing fangs, from the back of Heyan.He Yan rolled around on the ground and avoided its claws. He was worried. Now that the horse is gone, he can only fight with the wolf, but she has only this stick.When Shen Hong went up the mountain, she even took a bunch of darts. She thought, the horizontal stick went forward and threw at the wolf's head.The bamboo stick cleaved on the wolf's head with a \"bang\" sound. The wolf's head was tilted and only a little blood was shed. Looking at Heyan, he gave two angry howls and jumped back.\"What a broken stick!\" He Yan scolded and dodged, but the wolf was very cunning. Instead of attacking directly, he came from behind, intending to bite her neck. He Yan hid several times, but was bitten by it and stabbed the wolf's belly with his elbow bent. The wolf was beaten and cried out and threw her under him.One man and one wolf wrestled with each other, and the grass and leaves in the forest were rustling. Heyan tugged at the wolf's head to keep the wolf's mouth from biting him. In his heart, he thought whether he would bite the wolf with his mouth? As soon as she thought of this, she suddenly felt that her feet were empty. Before she could respond, she just felt that she fell down and heard the \"ordinary\" sound. The next moment, she and the wolf fell to the ground together.The sky became a round one, and the branches looked higher. Under the feet is the potholes of soil, and a wolf just stood up.She fell into a trap with the wolf.www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It looks like a smaller stage. The difference is that her opponent has become a bloodthirsty beast. At the moment, he Yan has no weapons, not even the bamboo stick which has been broken in two.The wolf's eyes burst with excitement. This is a clever and cruel animal. In this case, human beings will surely die.He Yan's lips floating a wry smile, God is really very kind to her, how to arrange for her is this kind of particularly difficult bridge, she is not a magic force, which can be saved from danger again and again.This is probably a trap set by the hunter to catch rabbits or foxes. It may have been too long, and they were covered with dead leaves, and there was no trace at all. Who knows that when she and the wolf fight here, she will fall down, and now there is no way out.Wolf slowly stood up, he Yan also want to stand up, just move will know not good, she just fell down, the leg fell, this moment the left leg move will be painful.She had to support the stone wall to stand up.Wolf Fu low body, throat issued a low howl, Heyan looked down at it, back against the stone wall, no action. It walked around a few steps, and suddenly toward Heyan.He Yan saw the dead bones eaten by wolves on the roadside. His body was incomplete and his face was beyond recognition, leaving only a pool of rotten meat.At the critical moment, she suddenly extended her left arm. The wolf ran to her neck and was waved away by her. This palm used some strength, but after all, it could not fight the beast. It only protected the neck. The next moment, the wolf bit the arm.She didn't care about it. Instead, she moved forward, as if to put her arm deeper into the wolf's mouth. The wolf's mouth was not loose, and he Yan's right hand was slashed forward --a scream broke out from the wolf's mouth. The cunning and persistent wolf was struggling in the trap pit, and its eyes were scratched by sharp stones and blood It's all over the place.He Yan released his hand. In her palm, there was a small stone, one end of which was pointed and stained with blood.She blinded the wolf in both eyes.From the moment she fell into the trap, she was everywhere with common things that could be used for self-defense. Unfortunately, there were only scattered stones in the trap pit, so she found the one that could be used.Wolf lost a pair of eyes, nothing to see, and because of the pain and ignore other, only struggling in the pit crazy. He Yan bit his teeth and supported the stone wall. He pressed the wolf's head with all his strength. She held the stone again and cut the wolf's throat.Blood, slowly dense out, first warm, gradually, a little bit cold.She slowly fell down and sat down with no strength left. The wolf bit his left arm. The blood was glued to his sleeve. His left leg couldn't be lifted. His neck was also scratched. Don't think, at the moment is also full of distress, but she just looked at the dead wolf, heart filled with a burst of sadness.She is so similar to the wolf that she can only be manipulated by others when she is blind. Now, seeing the wolf's tragic death at first sight, though he had done it himself, he thought about the past. He felt exhausted and unable to do anything else.The sun went down, the sun faded to the last shade, and the mountain forest became night. She sat quietly, drooping her head and saying nothing. For a moment, she seemed to have no breath, so she died quietly.\u2026\u2026In Liangzhou station, no one knows what happened on the mountain.When Zheng Xuan arrived at the Wei Suo, he went with the other two men to find the coach. They deliberately stayed at the foot of the mountain for a long time before they came back. At the moment, the sun had set, and only a little remnant of the sky, like a blood sunset, was spreading brightly by the water.Shen Hong did not go with them and returned to his room.When he went back, the rest of them had already had dinner. When Shen Hong was sitting there, someone laughed and asked, \"Hey, how are you feeling going up the mountain today?\"\"Why does he look dull? Isn't he tired and stupid?\"\"It's possible, ha ha ha, that's not enough. It's too weak.\"They all thought that Shen Hong was tired and didn't pay attention to it, so they went to do his own thing. After a while, Wang Ba came in. He and Shen Hong were in the same room. After Wang Ba came in, all the recruits in the room said hello to him. Although Wang Ba lost his bow and crossbow to Heyan, everyone still respected him here.Wang Ba also saw Shen Hong sitting in a daze on the bed and asked casually, \"what's wrong with him?\"\"I don't know. It's his turn to go up the mountain today. It's just like that when he comes back down the mountain.\" Someone answered.Wang Ba took a look at Shen Hong and thought that he was a little strange. Although he bullied the honest man, no matter how he bullied him, he didn't see Shen Hong so depressed. He went up to Shen Hong and gave Shen Hong a hand, \"what's the matter? Are you frightened by wild animals on the mountainHe didn't say it was OK. As soon as he said the word \"beast\", Shen Hong's body trembled even more fiercely. His mouth mumbled and did not know what he was saying. Wang Ba leaned closer and listened to him saying \"I'm sorry.\".\"Sorry? Who are you sorry for? \" Wang Ba frowned.Shen Hong was still talking about himself. Wang BA was impatient. He picked him up like a chicken and asked, \"Stinky boy, tell me everything you met when you went up the mountain today. Don't say it.\" he shook his fist like a threat, \"I want you to look good!\"When Shen Hong was mentioned by him, he seemed to wake up from his own thoughts. Wang Ba looked at him fiercely. He felt guilty. He was so excited and immediately blurted out: \"Heyan He Yan is still on the mountainHe Yan? Wang BA's heart jumped when he heard of Heyan. This man was really unjust to him, but he still asked curiously: \"what mountain? The mountain you went up together today? Why are you down? He's still on the mountain? What do you mean\"There are wolves A lot of wolves! In order to save us, he Yan led the wolf away by himself, \"Shen Hong cried out and said in a careless breath.\" Zheng Xuan didn't let us tell the coach, but he Yan went far away. No, no, it was they who overthrew the mountain. Heyan saved them, but they wanted him to die and slander him! Heyan is alone on the mountain. He doesn't even have weapons. He will die. We killed him! \"What he said was confused and incoherent. But who was Wang Ba? He understood the meaning of Shen Hong's words in the blink of an eye. He was stunned for a moment. Suddenly, he was full of anger. He hit the table with a fist, which scared Shen Hong.\"He saved you, and you left him alone on the mountain?\"Shen Hong cried, \"I don't want to I can't... \"Wang Ba looked at him scornfully: \"coward!\" He turned and walked out the door.www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zheng Xuan was standing beside him. Shen Han's face was so ugly that he could only hear a few words: \"don't obey the military orders Over the mountains... \"Zheng Xuan is still saying that he suddenly rushed over. Before he could react, he felt that he had been hit hard in the face and knocked him to the ground.\"Wang Ba, are you crazy?\" Liang Ping was stunned for a moment before he regained his mind and stopped Wang BA's next move.\"Liang Jiaotou, did this boy tell you that he Yan didn't listen to the military order and went over the mountain by himself, and he hasn't come back yet?\" Wang Ba gasped.Shen Han and Liang Ping looked at each other, and Wang Ba sneered, staring at Zheng Xuan, who was climbing up on the ground, and said, \"this turtle grandson is shameless! Zheng Xuan, do you dare to say who saved you? You've been surrounded by wolves. If it wasn't for Heyan, could you have run? You'd better not only run away, but also pour a basin of dirty water on people! Are you still a man? \"Zheng Xuan's face turned white, and his beaten lips were bleeding. He stood up and wiped the blood on his lips and said, \"coach, don't listen to his nonsense. It's Heyan who turned over the mountain himself and didn't believe it If you don't believe it, ask them? \" He pointed to two other recruits who had gone up the mountain with him.The two recruits nodded, \"yes, yes He Yan wanted to cross the mountain himself. We all tried to persuade him, but he didn't listen to him... \"Wang Baqi did not hit a place, rushed up to hit people: \"are you talking about people?\"Shen Hong was so timid and pitiful that he was scared a little. He told the truth about everything. He didn't have the courage to lie. Besides, he Yan is a man Although Wang Ba didn't like it very much, he also knew that he Yan would not take the initiative to do something to die. Compared with Zheng Xuan's style, Heyan looks much better.Liang Jiaotou stopped Wang Ba and said angrily, \"stop! Let's see what you look like! If the governor comes, I will be punished one by one. \"\"What's going on?\" Say Cao Cao Cao to, just finish this sentence, Xiao Jue's voice rings from behind. He came to the backyard of the self-defense center, took a look at the people, came over and said to Shen Han, \"say it.\"Shen Han's scalp was numb, and he replied honestly: \"today, they went up the mountain together. Heyan has not come back. Zheng Xuan said that he Yan did not listen to military orders and climbed over the mountain without permission. In the end, he couldn't find anyone, so he had to go down the mountain before sunset. \"\"That's not what I heard,\" Wang Ba sneered. \"It's these white eyed wolves who turned over the mountain first and provoked the wild wolves. In order to save them, Heyan led away the wolves, but these people ran away by themselves. No matter whether their brothers were dead or alive, they still wanted to detain the excrement pots for others. This kind of person has no morality in our bandits! \"\"Governor, don't listen to him,\" Zheng Xuan quickly knelt down on the ground. \"We all tried to persuade Heyan, but he didn't listen and insisted on leaving. It was getting late, so we had to come back for help first. \"When he spoke, he was sincere and sincere. Xiao Jue glanced at him and could not see what he was thinking.At present, the sun has completely set, the last trace of red haze is swallowed by the mountain top, and the mountain forest is silent. If it goes on like this, he Yan's chance to survive will only become more and more slim. Wang Ba bit his teeth and said, \"since the coaches are not willing to take the risk for him, I will save the people myself.\" He said that he was going to go out, \"I have been the king of the mountain for so many years. I'm not afraid of a few animals! But then again, people are not as good as animals these daysHe just took a step, \"bang\", a sword wiped his scalp, straight into the wooden pile in front of him, scared Wang ba a thrill.When he turned around, he saw that Xiao Jue, the commander of the right army, looked displeased. He warned Liang Jiaotou, \"Liang Ping, take care of your soldiers.\"Liang Ping:He bravely responded with a good voice, and cried a lot in his heart. He thought that this time he could fight well in front of governor Xiao, but he was criticized by name. For a while, I felt frustrated and wanted to have never been here.Shen Han hesitated for a moment and said, \"governor, we are taking people into the mountain now...\"\"No need.\" Xiao Jue interrupted him.Wang Ba looked at him in disbelief, and a glimmer of joy flashed in Zheng Xuan's eyes.\"The terrain on the mountain is complicated. I'm afraid there is fraud. You can't. I'll go.\" He said, finished, then called a voice, from far and near came a black horse, this horse is extremely majestic, four hoofs snow white, ears green, hair color Bingyi. Action will be like riding clouds and running, stop in front of Xiao Jue, intimate with his head to rub Xiao Jue's hand.This is Xiao Jue's favorite riding green ear.Xiao Jue turned over and mounted.What else does Shen Han want to say? Xiao Jue has left.Liang Ping stupidly asked: \"chief coach, what the governor said is deceitful... Is there anyone else on the mountain?\"Shen Han didn't speak. Of course he knew. Now they suspected that he Yan had a problem. He Yan disappeared on the mountain this time. How can we know whether it was intentional or not. \"Cheating\" refers to Heyan, not his opponent.I hope they think too much.\u2026\u2026It was getting colder and colder in the night.The trap was so deep that it was difficult for her to climb on her own. Now she was hurt and was not able to move. The blood will attract the nearby wild animals. If she really walks on the ground and drags the blood, she may be swallowed by the beast within a few steps.It's great here, too.He Yan looked up at the sky. The night sky is divided by traps, leaving only a round one. Looking up from here, you can see the shining star river. The night is as cool as water. Countless bright stars under the sky make up the shadow of a good night.She moved a position, head up, just can see the stars, and feel some cold, but this pit, in addition to her, only a wolf corpse. He Yan thought about it and shrunk his body to the wolf's belly. Although it was cold, he had fur to keep out the cold.Heyan reached out to untie the kettle on her waist. There was only one saliva left in the kettle. She drank up the water and threw it aside. It was cold, hungry and thirsty, which she had not experienced for many years.All of a sudden, he remembered what Hongshan said to her before going out in the morning: \"come back early, and celebrate the festival together in the evening.\".This is a clear autumn night, such as the moon, fireflies flying, star fan River white, black magpie bridge. He Yan looked up at the stars in the distance and murmured: \"every family begged to watch the autumn moon, wearing tens of thousands of red silk.\"She sighed and said with a helpless smile, \"today is the Chinese Valentine's Day...\"Silent night, the distant magpie bridge is crossing the Cowherd and weaving girl. The cool breeze blows away all the joy and hatred.Someone's voice sounded, with a kind of mockery.\"What? Do you still want to go to the river with your sweetheart to set up a flower boat? \"He Yan was surprised and raised his head, but saw a slender figure in the round sky.

He was really in a mess, but he was still in a romantic mood.He looked at his own pair of eyes clear, full of surprise, but not a trace of joy.He Yan blurted out: \"Xiao Governor, why are you here? \"At this time, she thought no one would come. In fact, after thinking about it carefully, it was very unlikely that Zheng Xuan would find someone to rescue her. Shen Hong was so timid that he would not dare to say anything more with a little threat. If others can't expect it, they can only rely on themselves. He Yan wanted to stay here until dawn. When his blood dried up, he got enough strength and tried to climb into the pit. He didn't expect that someone would come to save her, let alone Xiao Jue.Xiao Jue did not answer her words, only asked: \"can you come up by yourself?\"He Yan: NoThe pit was rough, but it was too deep for her to climb.Xiao Jue looked at her, turned around and left. He Yan was in a fog. What's the meaning? He just left?But for a moment, he came back again, holding a long thing in his hand. He Yan looked at it carefully. It was not the bamboo stick that she had broken. Although it is broken into two pieces, it just stretches down from the top and can be held by Heyan.Xiao Jue half knelt beside the pit, stretched out the bamboo stick and said, \"catch it.\"He Yan was speechless for a moment, but he had to admit his life to hold him. But he thought, is it also true that he should expect Xiao Jue to fly down and carry himself out? She felt cold when she thought about it.This man looks at xiuru Meiyu, but his strength is great. Heyan grabs the bamboo stick, and he can pull it up with one hand. When he was near the exit, he held out a hand to Heyan and motioned for him to grasp himself.He Yan was about to stretch out his hand. When he reached half of it, he was frozen in the air. I'm tired of fighting with wolf. I don't know if her hand is full of blood. This bloody hand, together with Xiao Jue's white hand, is really ugly.Xiao Jue, the most love Jie, he Yan some hesitation. The man seemed impatient to wait, and without waiting for her to figure out what to do, he went forward, grasped her wrist and pulled her up.There was no longer the suffocating blood gas in the pit outside, and the sky suddenly became much larger. Stars covered the top of the head, as if to sink down, countless bright convergence together, as if to light up the world.She turned to see Xiao Jue again.The young man stood up and threw away the bamboo stick. His eyes were fixed on her. After a moment, he said, \"you killed a wolf?\"What's the problem? Heyan didn't understand. She still laughed and said, \"yes, I almost died. I didn't have weapons. I was stoned to death, and I was bitten twice.\"Blood seeped out of the young man's sleeve and dyed her red dress into a dark color. However, she looked as usual and asked, \"how could the governor come in person? What about the others? \"\"It's too late. I came up alone.\" He kowtowed, and Heyan saw that there was a horse not far away. He saw Xiao Jue's movements and ran to Xiao Jue. Heyan saw his ears green and his heart moved by the moonlight. People all know that Fengyun general has a love of riding. He travels thousands of miles every day and pursues the wind and electricity. His name is green ear. I didn't expect to see it here today.\"Now we Go back? \" He Yan hesitated to ask.Xiao Jue looked at her strangely: \"do you want to spend the night here?\"\"No, it's not.\" He Yan explained: \"I mean, there is no one else here, there is only one horse...\" Does Xiao Jue want her to follow her all the way? Is it too bad? tragic beyond compare in this human world!He patted green ear's head, the horse gently lowered his head, Xiao Jue looked at her, \"go up.\"\"Eh Me He Yan was shocked.Xiao Jue is willing to let her ride this famous horse? Did she hear right?Xiao Jue pulled a corner of the mouth: \"if you want to walk back, it's not impossible.\"\"No, no, no, I can!\" He Yan replied, \"I'm so happy!\"Today is what good day, she can actually ride to the legendary green ear, Heyan just want to laugh. She limped to green ear. The horse was very tall and powerful. Originally, the movement of turning over and getting on the horse should be very natural and unrestrained. Unfortunately, her whole body is injured and she can't be natural and unrestrained if she wants to be smart. Can only grasp the saddle with one hand, and try to rub up.He Yan's leg was hurt, and his arm was bitten by a wolf. With a strong force, the blood that had just dried up immediately seeped out again. In a blink of an eye, half of his sleeve was wet. And her face was as usual, pale and smiling, with big drops of sweat rolling on her forehead, and her hair was wet.The man had no idea how embarrassed he was. Xiao Jue raised her eyebrows slightly.He Yan was still climbing up with his hands and feet. Suddenly, someone's voice came from his head. He said, \"don't you feel pain?\"He Yan was stunned. At the next moment, someone took her by her waist and drove her up. Before she had time to cry out, she had already sat on the horse's back, and her back was against another person. If there was no moon Lin Xiang, she would disturb her thoughts.\"Sit down.\" Xiao Jue road.It is difficult for Heyan to describe the feeling of this moment.She did not expect that Xiao Jue would carry her to the horse's back Should it be a hug? She didn't feel it clearly. It was too fast. But now he is really sitting behind him. Heyan is petite and his head is just leaning against his chest, which seems to be It was like nestling in his arms.She was horrified by this idea, and her subconscious feeling was not bashful, but frightened. Xiao Jue is not a romantic person, not to mention she is still a man. Today's variety, is not oneself in the dream?Xiao Jue urged the horse to go, and Heyan said, \"wait, wait!\"\"What happened?\" he asked\"Look at that wolf,\" He Yan pointed to the wolf corpse in the pit. \"I managed to kill it. It's a pity to leave it here.\"The man replied coldly, \"what do you want?\"\"Bring it with you?\" Heyan asked tentatively.After a long time, the youth sneered: \"yes.\"\"Really?\" He Yan surprised to turn back, \"governor, you are really a good man!\" She didn't expect much at all.He bent the corner of his lip, and his eyes were indifferent: \"it comes up, you go down.\"He Yan said:She said, \"when I didn't say it.\"The horse walked two steps, and she turned back, almost bumping into Xiao Jue's arms. \"Otherwise, I'd better go down and peel the wolf's skin before leaving. It's going to be autumn. How nice to make a wolf skin boot?\"The answer to her is a cruel word.\"Shut up.\"www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I didn't run very fast because it was a night road and I couldn't see clearly. He Yan is a bit of a pity. He finally got on the green ear and didn't feel the legend of \"crossing mountains and climbing water, like walking on the ground\".It's too bad.The stars and the moon are shining from the branches and leaves of the forest. He Yan rides on his horse and finally has the heart to see the scenery around him. It doesn't matter if you look at it. Not far away, there is a wolf lying on its side. It should be dead.She was surprised for a moment, then walked a few steps further, and there was another wolf corpse.He Yan noticed that this was not an accident. She swallowed her saliva and asked carefully, \"Xiao Governor, you did all this? \"\"If you meet on the road, you can remove it. Otherwise, it will be very troublesome to follow you all the way.\" He replied.Heyan sighs in his heart. Look, he deserves to be a young general. If he doesn't agree with him, he will kill him. No wonder he didn't meet any wild wolves on the way. He was brave enough to be killed by Xiao Jue. She looked at the corpses of the wolves. They were all sealed with a sword. The wounds were very small and accurate.Her eyes moved down slightly and fell on the sword on Xiao Jue's waist. Others know that general Feng Yun is famous for his horse and sword. The horse calls the green ear, the sword name drinks the autumn. The blade of her blue Lang blade is green, cutting iron like mud. It is said that the whole body of drinking autumn is crystal clear, like frost and snow. Now drink autumn to wear on Xiao Jue waist, sword is not scabbard, can not see what.These wolves should have died under the sword of Yin Qiu. Since ancient times, the sword was given to the hero. He Yan felt that he was just a hero. When he saw the sword, he could not help but feel it.She reached out quietly and touched back.Suddenly he felt his body stiff. He Yan immediately gave up and cried, \"I didn't mean to touch your waist. I just want to touch your sword!\"After a long time, a voice came from behind, who tried to resist anger, \"you can not speak.\"\"I'll die of boredom if I don't talk.\" He Yan said, \"governor, in fact, you don't have to be so serious.\" She said, \"you see, you kill so many wolves, but you don't take them away. These wolves will finally be cheaper than the foxes in the mountains. Not to mention meat, this wolf skin is the best. The fur I killed was incomplete. I could only make boots. But the ones you killed didn't damage the fur, enough to make a cloak. But the wolf skin cloak is not suitable for you. If you want to come to your clothes, the material is more expensive. Why not make me cheaper? In winter, I can roll in the snow with a wolf skin cloakXiao Jue seemed to be dizzy by her nonsense, and even took her words. Although the tone was not very good, he said sarcastically: \"you like wolf skin so much. No wonder you are in a trap. Even the dead wolf doesn't let go.\"\"That's not true. I'm just too cold.\" He Yan shook his head, \"the governor loves Jie and doesn't like to be dirty. He can't let the blood of animals contaminate his clothes. We are not the same, not to mention the dead wolf, I even sleep in the deadAfter a moment of silence, Xiao Jue asked: \"when?\"\"I can't remember what happened when I was a child.\" He Yan looked at the stars in the sky, \"at that time, in order to protect life, there was no way. I'm the only one alive in the deadShe thought Xiao Jue would ask what was going on. She was just about to make up a story. Unexpectedly, Xiao Jue didn't ask, and her prepared speech was empty.He Yan's thoughts returned to the past.Shortly after she arrived in Moxian County, a group of recruits from Fuyue army met the Xiqiang people on the edge of the desert.They are all new recruits. They don't know how to fight, but they just rely on their blood. But the blood was soon dissipated by the ferocity of the Xiqiang people. In the end, the recruit team was wiped out.At that time, Yan he'er was still dead, but she was still alive. The Xiqiang people set all the corpses on fire and left. At that time, Heyan felt that she was probably doomed and would die in this desert.Who knows God won't let her die, the middle road suddenly began to rain, the rain put out the flames on the body. He Yan did not have the strength to move, did not dare to move, even did not dare to cry.The boy who was still fighting with himself yesterday has become a corpse that can't move. He still scolds his elder brother in the morning. He has already lost his head. Lying in the wreckage of her severed limbs, she experienced the cruelty of war for the first time. She smelled the smell of blood among the dead, and shed tears with her eyes open all night.At dawn, a pedestrian passed by. He buried all the bodies on the spot and collected them. He also found the dying Heyan and saved her life.Later, he Yan thought many times that although she was a man in the capital, she was not strong enough. In her heart, she left a way out for herself. But after that night, she often no longer left a way for herself. She was not a girl. No one could dry her tears for her on the battlefield. The only thing she had to do was to survive after every fight between life and death.At any time, it's the first thing to survive. What about being next to a wolf carcass in order to survive? When necessary, if she really can't get out, she can eat wolf raw.But Xiao Jue couldn't understand.He Yan heart, gently sigh. At this time, I really felt some coldness.The young man has black clothes and black armour, and his cloak covers the cool. He Yan is afraid to dirty his clothes and dare not look back too much. However, he can't help looking up at him. From this angle, he can see his beautiful chin line.Xiao Jue is really good-looking. He Yan has to admit this fact in his previous life and this life. He was beautiful and heroic. Although he was indifferent, he always had a bit of loose and itchy.He was born with a pair of eyes, such as the autumn water is clear and cool, as if everything has never been reflected in the eyes, it will make people can not help thinking, if one day these eyes seriously look at a person, how gentle.She thought again of the hand that Xiao Jue held out to her in the pit, and thought that \"the finger is as sharp and long as a spring bamboo shoot, and the eye is as clear and green as an autumn wave\". She thinks that it is really suitable for this person.No wonder he is called \"jade face governor\". He is really unwilling to think about it. They are all young generals. Why is he called \"jade face commander\" and she can only be called \"mask general\"? He Yan thought that if he had taken off his mask at that time, he could not have been given the title of \"Pan'an in the army\".She thought about it, but she didn't know that she was gazing at Xiao Jue's face with admiration for a while, and sighed with dismay at the same time. She looked like a madman, which was really inexplicable in Xiao Jue's eyes.And it's pretty stupid.www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Unconsciously, Heyan fell asleep. After a while, someone patted him on the shoulder and called her name: \"Heyan!\"She opened her eyes and saw Liang Jiaotou standing in front of her eyes. She was still dozing against Xiao Jue. There was a trace of moistening on the inside of Xiao Jue's sleeve. I don't know if it was her saliva.He Yan wiped his mouth and apologized and said, \"rightThe words have not finished, this person has been crisp off the horse, almost hurt her head back in the past. Xiao Jue said to Liang Ping, \"I'll give it to you.\" Without looking at Heyan, he walked away.He Yan said:Look, she's not even given a chance to say thanks. He Yan shrugged, Liang Ping helped her down from the horse, and green ear was also aware of it. After he Yan left, the little hoof climbed up and went to the master.He Yan's whole body is full of blood, even if Liang Ping has a stomach of questions, he can't ask at the moment, and only says, \"can you move?\"\"Coach Liang looks down on me too much,\" she said with a smile. \"There's no problem.\"\"Well,\" Liang Ping sighed, \"forget it. I'll send you back first and bandage the wound first. Then I'll talk about it later.\"He Yan agreed immediately.In the room, they all wait for wheat and stone. As soon as Heyan goes in, \"Hula\" sounds, a group of people gather around and ask.\"How about it? Are you okay? Are you all right? \"\"Why did you bleed so much? Is someone dead? \"He Yan even saw Wang Ba, sitting on the box at the corner of the wall, and when he saw her, he seemed to want to move forward. Finally, he was patient and said, \"it's not dead.\"\"Thank you, little brother.\" Heyan already knew from Liang Ping that it was Shen Han who Wang Ba went to find. He blinked at him and said happily, \"I miss me so much. The boss is very moved.\"\"You Wang Ba, like a cat with hair blown up, jumped up from the box, glared at her, and left in a rage. Before leaving, he almost broke the door.He Yan was helped to his bed and sat down. The stone handed him a bowl of water. He drank it in one breath and felt a little more comfortable in his throat.Wheat said: \"a he Ge, your hand has been bleeding, hurry to change clothes?\"He Yan light cough: \"actually also not so serious.\"\"Isn't that serious?\" Hongshan frowned, \"if it wasn't for governor Xiao who went up the mountain to find you, would you still have your life tomorrow morning?\"\"You shouldn't be a hero,\" Jiang Jiao also came, \"for that kind of person, it's not worth it.\"\"Not bad.\" Huang Xiong held the Buddha beads on his neck. \"They should be allowed to feed the wolves themselves.\"He Yan said: She looked at a room full of people, and for the first time found her popularity so good? However, so many people, it is really a brain AChE.Chirping, and someone pushed the door in, voice if oriole, \"you all go out, I'll send medicine.\"There was a moment of silence in the room.He Yan curiously looked at the past, saw the crowd automatically out of a road, into a young woman. The woman was dressed in a palace Satin snow silk dress, her long hair was tied up in a snow-white ribbon, and a lotus hairpin was on her head, which was simple and beautiful. Jade face light brush, moon eyebrow star eye, very graceful and moving.Even mosquitoes are public in Liangzhou Wei Suo. When have you seen such elegant and refined beauties? For a time, these men were silent for fear of disturbing the lovely fairy.He Yan was confused and asked, \"are you...\"\"I'm the medical girl of liangzhouwei,\" the girl whispered, \"Shen muxue.\"He Yan felt that the name was familiar, but he could not remember where he had heard it. Shen muxue has put the medicine bowl in his hand gently on the head of the bed and turned to other people: \"can you please go out first?\"Hongshan immediately blushed and said, \"good, good.\" He yelled out the others and gave him an envious look when he left.He Yan said:He Yan asked, \"is this medicine for me?\"Shen muxue nods, and Heyan takes the bowl and drinks it. Shen muxue was stunned and said, \"in fact, you don't have to drink so fast...\"\"Ah?\" He Yan scratched his head, \"anyway, I want to drink.\"It seems to be amused by her. Shen muxue smiles and says, \"that little brother, take off your clothes first. I'll take the medicine for you.\"Beside the hot water, Heyan hesitated for a moment and said, \"well, Miss Shen, you can put the medicine here. I'll serve it myself.\"\"You?\" Shen muxue shook his head. \"I'll do it.\"\"You're young, or a girl's home,\" He Yan Yu advised her. \"I'm a man in the end. You can see how bad it is.\"\"There is no man or woman in front of the doctor.\" Shen Evening snow answer.He Yan thought for a while, \"you don't care, I have a problem.\"Shen muxue raised his head. Heyan looked back fearlessly and said, \"I have a fiancee, Miss Shen. My body can only be shown to my fiancee alone. You should be responsible for my pure and pure body. Do you know? \" She wrapped herself in her clothes with a look of death rather than surrender.Shen muxue has not seen such a person who does not have a face. For a while, her movements stopped and she didn't know how to react.\"Just leave the medicine here.\" He Yan said, \"I'll take medicine by myself. I'll defend myself for my sweetheart. Don't hurt me.\" She has a serious face.Shen muxue was speechless for a moment, and finally was defeated by Heyan's shameless. She said, \"the medicine and hot water are here. I'll go out and call me when you're good.\"He Yan nodded happily: \"thank you for your understanding.\"Shen muxue retreats, Heyan breathes a sigh of relief. He takes off his clothes covered with blood, wipes his body with hot water, and changes into a clean dress. She pulled up her sleeve, and the elbow was bitten by the wolf. It was so bloody that he Yan took a deep breath and changed a handkerchief to clean the blood from the wound.At this time, the door was pushed open again. He Yan was busy wiping his head. He said, \"I didn't need to come in. Did I apply the medicine myself?\"A cold voice sounded, \"your chastity to your fiancee is really moving.\"He Yan raised his head, Xiao Jue stood a few steps away from her, holding his chest and looking at her.He Yan was very dangerous. Fortunately, she just moved quickly and changed her clothes. So he squeezed out a smile, \"how did the governor come? Don't come to me to settle accounts after autumn? As I said, I didn't mean to touch your waist when I was on the mountainXiao Jue's expression was stiff, and her eyes were about to get angry. She only raised her hand, and a round object was thrown into Heyan's arms.He Yan picked it up and saw it was a delicate porcelain vase. It looked like a mandarin duck pot. She pulled out the plug and smelled it. It was bitter and astringent.\"This is Medicine? \" She asked hesitantly.The man didn't have a good airway: \"treat your own injury first.\"This scene is inexplicably familiar. He Yan is stunned and looks at him again. He must have just changed his clothes. He is as clean as new. Standing here, the moon is flowing down from the outside, reflecting his joyful figure.

If she was asked to look at her past self from the present perspective, she would feel that she was too dull.She was not very good at literature and martial arts at that time. She was similar to Cheng Lishu now, and she was also a \"waste childe\". However, unlike Cheng Lishu, she had a powerful uncle, and the family background of he family was nothing in Xianchang house. Therefore, she was not as happy as Cheng Lishu.What's more, when she was a teenager, she wore a mask all day long, and she always looked out of place with others. Because there was a ghost in his heart, he never dared to go to the province with the young people, so he was rejected by other students in Xianchang hall.Young people's rejection, to direct, at the beginning is just not playing with her, Cuju when not called her. Later, she became more and more serious. The reason was that she worked so hard.When he Yan was a child, he caught the truth that \"stupid birds fly first\", so he really started from stupid birds. The more bad civil and military subjects are, the more they have to learn. They are more serious than anyone else. Even though the gentlemen of Xianchang hall think that the child is not a material for reading and practicing martial arts, they are often moved by Heyan's persistent learning spirit. So he often praised him in class.\"Diligent learning is like a spring sprout, but without its growth, it has its own advantages. You all look at he Rufei and learn from othersAll of them are 14-5-year-old boys. They always like to compete with others. What can they learn from Heyan? Is he always the last to learn from him? I'm afraid it's not brain damage?But several gentlemen seem to like he Yan very much.Young people are angry from the heart, evil to the gall, jealousy and disdain mixed together, they see the masked boy more and more uncomfortable, every now and then to find some trouble for Heyan.He Yan's clothes were cut when he was comparing swords today. Tomorrow, he would train his horse to feed her horse with sneezing grass. Sometimes, he deliberately poked a hole in her boot, and accidentally fell to the ground and taught the stone to cut the center of his foot. When he Yan gets up from the ground, the teenagers hide together and point to her for fun.When he was a boy, he Yan was stupid, and his mouth was stupid. He couldn't do anything to complain to his husband. The gentlemen didn't know the students' small movements in private. He Yan had a hard time.One day, it was winter and it was very cold. When the teenagers were practicing swords in the school hall, they did not know who threw a basin of water on the ground. The water froze quickly on the ground. They urged Heyan outside: \"he Rufei, hurry up, hurry up, sir, call you!\"He Yan ran out in a hurry. He slipped and fell down.The fall was so heavy that she only felt that there was Venus on her head and she didn't get up for a long time. The teenagers hid in the corner and laughed, saying only, \"he was taken in as expected.\"He Yan sat in the same place for a long time, then stood up, pursed his lips, did not speak, xianchangguan students return home once a month, she brought no clean clothes this month. Every once in a while, the gods don't have so many clothes. It's hard to dry in the sun for a long time.He Yan wore half wet clothes for a whole day. At night, she got up from the bed and didn't go to practice sword. Instead, she ran to the hall where the school taught her.Clay figurines also have three parts of soil. Besides, she is the eldest young master of he family. She is a little angry. However, she will still judge the situation. Those young people are tall and powerful, their skills are much better than her, and they can't beat them. Is that all? No way.How can I get rid of this evil spirit?He Yan, 14, thought for a long time and finally came up with a solution.It snowed at night. Wearing her clothes that had not been dried, she braved the wind and snow to fetch a bucket of water from the well in the backyard, and ran to the hall with the bucket of water.She remembers where each of the young people sat in the daytime. She found their copybooks under their desks. This month's homework was to copy \"Xing Li Zi Xun\" five times. Tomorrow is the time to hand in the homework at the end of the month.He Yan splashed the bucket of water.The water instantly soaked the handwriting, dense into a large piece of fuzzy, he Yan out of breath, the heart suddenly happy, after the joy, and a little nervous.She pushed the letter back to its original position in a hurry and ran out with an empty bucket. It was only the first time that she did such a thing. She was afraid to turn on the light in the dark at night. She went to the door without looking at the threshold under her feet and fell down with a sound of \"pa\".She took a breath of cold air in pain. She fell twice a day, and this time it was even worse. Her elbow touched the wooden thorn on the threshold and made a hole and blood flowed out. He Yan sat up with difficulty, holding that arm, thinking in his heart, is this just that many lines of injustice will kill themselves?She only did it once, OK? God is too strict with her!Anyway, I have to return the bucket. By the way, what about her bucket? She just remembered that she had just fallen so hard that the bucket had fallen to the ground. It should have made a huge noise and woke everyone up. How could it still be quiet now?He Yan looked up, stood up and walked forward two steps, and then he saw a man standing outside the door. He leaned lazily against the wooden door, with his back to Heyan and a bucket in his hand.It's Xiao Jue.For a moment, he Yan's nervous words did not dare to say.He saw it? He didn't see it, did he? No way. He must have seen it. He still has the bucket in his hand. But if he didn't see it, how should he explain it? Watering the flowers here in the middle of the night?He Yan thinks wildly, the youth sees her stupidly standing in place, pick eyebrow way: \"you do not ache?\"Heyan: \"ah?\"His eyes fell on Heyan's elbow. In order to draw water, she pulled up her sleeve. Between the white and tender elbows, a bloodstain like ugly embroidery was particularly conspicuous in the weak lantern light.He Yan subconsciously wants to hide his hand behind his back.The teenager looked at her impatiently and said coldly, \"follow me.\"He Yan didn't know why he wanted to listen to him. He was scared and confused, so he followed up.Xiao Jue first put the iron bucket back to the water well. Then she looked back and saw that she was still holding her arm in a daze and sneering. Her expression was meaningful: \"I'm so timid, but I still learn from others to do bad things.\"He Yan clenched his fist and did not speak. She was very nervous. On weekdays, Xiao Jue is only with his few good teenagers. The other teenagers in the school hall are not very close. Heyan doesn't know what this person thinks. If he goes to report himselfA cold pot was thrown into his arms.He Yan looked down and saw that it seemed to be a mandarin duck pot with exquisite body and complicated patterns.She heard her voice as small as a gnat: \"what is this?\"\"Can't use it?\" The boy turned his head and looked lazy, \"medicine.\"www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

One pot can hold two kinds of wine. It is a necessary tool to poison people. He pulled a piece of white cloth and poured a little, then a little. The first thing that flowed out was the juice, then the powder. A small spoon was embedded beside the handle of the pot. Xiao Jue took the spoon and slowly spread it.When he did these things, his long eyelashes fell down, and his profile was handsome and compelling. He also brought some of his youth's elegance, which made people feel confused. He did not know whether he was here in liangzhouwei or Xianchang hall thousands of miles away.When he Yan was in a daze, he had smeared the ointment on the white cloth and threw it to Heyan. His tone was extremely indifferent: \"on myself.\"\"Oh,\" He Yan had expected and whispered, \"I didn't expect you to help me.\"He heard, staring at Heyan with a smile: \"dare not delay you to defend yourself like a jade.\"\"You just know.\" He Yan said with a smile: \"but thank you, governor, such a valuable medicine.\"\"There's a shortage of drugs in the clinic, unless you want to die.\" He said.He Yan solemnly looked at him: \"that also counted to save my life, did not expect the governor is such a kind of person.\"Xiao Jue Xiang way, \"do not know what to say.\" He got up and left.He Yan saw that he was really gone this time, just lean against the head of the bed, and sighed gently. Xiao Jue's medicine is very effective. It is clear and cool, and the pain is relieved a lot.He Yan looked at the pot, his mind gradually away.On that snowy night when she was 14 years old, Xiao Jue was not as indifferent as she is now. At least when he Yan said that he could not use it, he not only helped to open the mandarin duck pot, but also personally prescribed medicine for her.It's strange that the picture at that time has been very vague, but today Xiao Jue so, those forgotten details are slowly unfolding in front of Heyan, as if just happened, clear and incredible.She sat on the stone bench in the yard, and the young man, who was always lazy and indifferent, had the rare patience to prescribe medicine for her. He has picturesque eyebrows and eyes, and his side face is in front of Heyan. He can almost feel his warm breath, which has faded away from the sharpness of the past, with soft warmth, covering her cold heart completely.The mask covered her face, and the other party could not see her expression or feel her palpitation at that time.It's hard to be indifferent to people like him, especially when such a cold hearted person treats others gently, the iron hearted people will bump into each other. He Yan was young at that time, and he had no resistance. He was defeated in an instant.After finishing the medicine, he left. He Yan called him in a low voice: \"your medicine.\"\"See you off.\" The young man carelessly replied, \"you are so stupid, you will have a lot of chances to get hurt in the future. Keep it by yourself.\"A word became a prophecy, she later, the opportunity of injury was innumerable. The ointment in the mandarin duck pot had been used up for a long time, and the pot was later lost by her in a war. I think it's a pity.On the next day, the teenagers went to the school hall and found that the calligraphy on their desk was wet with water, and the flowers could not recognize the handwriting. All of a sudden, they were in chaos.\"Who did it? Come out and I'll take care of it and I won't kill him! \" They roared fiercely.\"Isn't that easy? Look whose copybook is clean. If you look inside, you can always find the one who has a grudge against us Some people offer a brilliant plan.He Yan's heart is tight, extremely upset, no wonder he said he was stupid, even this kind of thing did not expect. Her calligraphy is clean and tidy. If you check it out, you can't be yourself?Forget it, do it all, man man, dare to do it. As soon as she accepted her fate, she watched helplessly as the teenagers asked the students in the school library to check the calligraphy.I'm almost in front of myself.He Yan summoned up his courage and was about to stand up and shout \"I did it\". Suddenly, someone came in and put the book on the table.The movement was so great that everyone looked to the other side. They saw the beautiful young man in white robe leaning against the wall, holding his chest in his hands, and looking lazy and indifferent, he said casually, \"I did it.\"There was an uproar.\"Huai, Huai Jin, are you really responsible for this?\" Someone asked carefully.Xiao Huaijin is not he Rufei. Who dares to provoke in the capital city, let alone the Xiao family who oppresses the dead, even his husband has to protect him. The emperor has praised him personally.\"It's me.\" He answered with a straight answer.\"But why?\" Asked the man, with a sad face.\"No why,\" replied the boy, glancing at him, \"slippery hands.\"\"Puff\", Heyan didn't resist to laugh out, aware of the people's eyes, and quickly turned around as if nothing had happened.What happened later?Later, it was over because it was Xiao Huaijin. Other people did not dare to say anything. They could only admit that they were unlucky.\"Zhi Ya\", the door was pushed open, Shen muxue came in. She took the empty medicine bowl and water basin and told Heyan not to press the wound, and then she went out.From the narrow window of the room, you can see the four corners of the sky, a bright moon hanging in the sky, bright stars.She murmured in a low voice: \"today is the Chinese Valentine's Day...\"She never had a festival, used to do men's dress up, this Festival Japan has nothing to do with her. Later, she married Xu Zhiheng. At the beginning, she was also looking forward to it. How to dress up as a man? When she is red, I just want to be like an ordinary girl. She goes to the river to put flower boats, worship Xianhe, steam Qiao fruit and go to temple fairs. I heard there are fireflies on the mountain.She summoned up her courage and asked Xu Zhiheng for the first time. Xu Zhiheng agreed with a smile, \"OK.\"But before Tanabata, she was blind. So it seems to be forgotten, Xu Zhiheng did not take the initiative to mention, Heyan also did not mention, thinking that Xu was so worried about his illness that he lost his mind. Until the next day, he just like passing by her door, smiling, let people put away the lantern that Xu Zhiheng sent her the day before.She had just learned that Xu Zhiheng was not in the house on the Chinese Valentine's day, not because of official business, but to accompany him, just like going to a temple fair.All kinds of life, white clouds and dew. She didn't know how she was doing as a man, but she knew that being a woman was really bad.Just thinking about it, Hong Shan came in from the outside and saw the mandarin duck pot in her hand. He joked casually: \"Oh, our governor also sent you a gift for Chinese Valentine's Day! What good wine! Let me have a taste of itHe Yan was stunned for a moment and suddenly laughed.The past life and this life, now think about it, in fact, this Chinese Valentine's day, not too bad. She took a ride with countless dream people of Wei women, touched his waist, rode his horse, walked through the mountain road, saw the starry sky, and finally got a pot of miraculous medicine in vain.It's worth living.www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seeing Xiao Jue coming, Shen Han rushed forward and said, \"governor.\"\"I heard they found it?\" Shen Han asked.\"Liang Ping looked at it.\"Shen Han is a little relieved. Now he Yan is being suspected. If he suddenly disappears, he may not have done it intentionally. People with doubts are always safer under their noses.But now that people have found it, it's time to think about another thing.\"What Zheng Xuan said was that he Yan crossed the mountain on his own, and Shen Hong said that he Yan was trying to save Zheng xuanyue mountain. The governor looked at it...\" Shen Han asked.Xiao Jue: \"Zheng Xuan is lying.\"Shen Han was stunned.\"There are horseshoe marks on the mountain crossing road, and I also find traces of wolf cubs falling to death.\" Xiao Jue said: \"He Yan is really saving people.\"Shen Han's face sank. \"In this way, Zheng Xuan is really immoral.\" No matter how excellent such recruits are, once they are on the battlefield in the future, who knows whether they will temporarily switch sides. A soldier can die by the enemy's sword, but not by the hidden arrow of his fellow soldiers.\"But,\" Shen Han thought of another thing, \"if what he Yan said is true, can we clear her of suspicion?\" If he Yan is for the sake of his comrades in arms who can ignore his own life, maybe he should change his outlook on her.\"No way.\" Xiao Jue's cold voice answered, \"he killed a wolf with his bare hands in a pit on the mountain. This son can't be underestimated, \"he raised his eyebrows:\" afraid there is a secret in the body. \"Shen Han didn't dare to say anything more. Although Liangzhou Wei is thousands of miles away from shuojing, now the situation is complicated and no one dares to take it lightly.Shen Han looked at Zheng Xuan's men. They were sitting far away. At the moment, they looked at this head with uneasy faces. Although Zheng Xuan tried to keep calm, he did not know that his lie had been exposed.\"What does the governor intend to do with these men?\" Shen Han asked.\"Out of the army, mixed with the front and the rear, good tongue and sharp teeth, act rashly,\" Xiao Jue's expression remained unchanged, voice calm, \"slander the army's crime, behead.\"Shen Han's heart a Lin, bow head way: \"yes!\"\u2026\u2026When Heyan woke up the next day, the sun had gone up, and there was no one in the room. She sat up and looked at the sunlight coming out of the window in a daze.Someone pushed the door and came in. He Yan looked up and saw that it was Shen muxue, the medical fairy of yesterday. He Yan said strangely, \"Miss Shen?\"\"This is today's soup, you take it first,\" Shen muxue put the medicine bowl on the small table in Heyan's room. \"Yesterday, the governor has given you trauma medicine. You can change it every three hours.\"He Yan picked up the medicine bowl on the table and drank it off. He asked, \"Miss Shen, why are the others missing? They don't call me either? \"\"I told coach Liang that you still need to rest. It's not convenient to practice in the martial arts arena today.\" Shen muxue replied.He Yan answered and looked at Shen muxue. The girl was only 16 or 17 years old. She was very beautiful. What's more, she had a calm and leisurely temperament from the inside to the outside, which made people feel very comfortable. He Yan is about to see some uncomfortable, Shen Evening snow light frown: \"what's wrong with little brother?\"\"Nothing,\" He Yan said, \"I just think Miss Shen has a good face. It seems that she has seen her somewhere.\"Shen muxue was stunned for a moment, then shook his head and laughed, \"I have never seen him before with my younger brother. Maybe I have a wrong memory.\"\"All right.\" He Yan scratched his head. Shen Mu snow see he Yan finished drinking medicine, and then take away the medicine bowl, exit the door.Suddenly quiet down, he Yan did not know what to do, fortunately, not long after such a daze, someone knocked at the door.\"Who is it?\" He Yan asked.A wary voice sounded, \"it's me.\"He Yan was stunned, and his head appeared at the door, which turned out to be Shen Hong.He didn't know where he came from. His face was very pale and his lips were blue and purple, not as lively as when he first saw him. He limped in, some did not dare to see Heyan's face, walked to Heyan's bedside and said, \"I'm sorry.\"He Yan already knew the whole story from Hongshan and said, \"it's OK. Didn't you tell them the truth?\"\"But I Almost... \" Shen Hong is full of guilt.He Yan could understand that Shen Hong, for example, had never experienced anything before. He was timid. He felt flustered when he wanted to be threatened by Zheng Xuan. \"I'm ok now,\" she saidShen Hong nodded silently.\"When you first came in, you walked a little strange,\" He Yan asked, \"what's the matter?\"\"I I broke the military order and was punished by the staff for 40 army sticks, \"Shen Hong said:\" I will be a gang leader in the future. I can't go to the front line. \"He Yan is silent and forty army staff. No wonder Shen Hong's face is so bad. He is not dead.\"And the others?\"\"Zheng Xuan and the other two Cut off In front of all the recruits... \" Shen Hong's face turned white.He Yan was not surprised. When she was general Feihong, she had heard of general Fengyun's bad reputation. The discipline in the army was extremely strict. Once upon a time, the son of a high-ranking official came to join the Nanfu soldiers. Originally, he wanted to become famous. However, Xiao Jue ordered his head to be beheaded because he had violated military discipline. At that time, the senior official refused to let go and told his majesty. Finally, he did nothing.Others may say that Xiao Jue is cruel, but if not, he would not be able to control the Nanfu soldiers, let alone go to this stage.\"In fact, it's good to be a gang soldier,\" He Yan patted him on the shoulder. \"You are gentle and kind-hearted. You dare not kill people on the front line.\"Shen Hong reluctantly smiles. He takes out a lot of things from his pocket and shoves them into Heyan's hands. Heyan looks down and sees that it is a bunch of pine nuts.\"You are a good man,\" Shen Hong stammered. \"I was too cowardly before. I'm sorry. I almost killed you. This pine nut is for you. You Take your timeHe got up and limped out again. As soon as he left, Hongshan and his party came in and hit each other. Shen Hong blushed and left in a hurry. After he left, Hongshan asked, \"what is that boy doing here?\"\"It should be the fault,\" wheat said, \"why, brother ahoe, where did you get pine nuts?\"He Yan put the pine nuts on the table and said, \"you should eat by yourself. Why did you come back so early? \"\"The chief coach says something today,\" said stone, \"you don't have to run with a load in recent days.\"\"What's the matter?\" He Yan is strange.\"We've been in liangzhouwei all summer,\" said Hongshan, picking up some pine nuts and peeling them. \"The chief coach said that we should select new recruits with good qualifications to go to Qianfeng camp.\"He Yan raised eyebrows. According to the time, it was about this time.\"We are going to fight for the first place in the mountains in a dozen days.\"\"Fight for the flag.\" The stone took his words.\"Oh, yes, yes, fight for the flag. Who wins the most, who is the first, may be point to the forward camp Hongshan chews pine nuts.\"Ah he Ge certainly has no problem,\" the wheat holds the cheek, \"the elder brother is so powerful, certainly can enter.\"He Yan laughs and shakes his head. If he is only in the Qianfeng camp, it's nothing. But if you want to enter xiaojue's nine flag camp, I'm afraid we have to work hard.It's really a challenge arena.

Hong Shan was also in the side of coax: \"you listen to the doctor's daughter, if you are upset again, until the flag day, you can't take the first, can't enter the Qianfeng camp, then don't cry.\"He Yan thought about it and gave it up. He was not in a hurry for a day or two.But these days, as long as she gets off the arena, her room is basically full of people who come to see her. People often come to visit the doctor. Today, Jiang Jiao sent some sour and astringent plums. Tomorrow, Huang Xiong brought a bunch of roasted quails. The most speechless thing was Wang ba. He could not make himself down. He asked his new soldiers to send half a dried steamed bun, which was looted from other people's hands. He really regarded the barracks as his own mountain.Liang Jiaotou came twice, and twice he saw Heyan, who was surrounded by the crowd. He took a look at the food that was pushed like a mountain on her table. He threw down a sour sentence: \"Oh, my little life is good.\" and he Yan was helpless.When he Yan's elbow was so noisy and scabby, and his legs could jump on the ground, seven or eight days had passed, and the day of fighting for the flag was getting closer and closer.On this day, before the sun set, Hongshan returned. He Yan was surprised and asked, \"Why are you scattered before the next martial arts performance?\"\"Today is July 14, the mid Yuan Festival,\" wheat replied first. \"The chief instructor asked us to go down to the martial arts field earlier, have dinner, and go to the river to put water lamps to worship our ancestors.\"\"This Liangzhou Wei is not bad. It still gives people time to worship their ancestors and relatives.\" Hong Shan sighed.He Yan laughs and says that this is the tradition in the barracks. When she was in Fuyue army, every year on the mid Yuan Festival, the local government in her garrison would teach people to set up Daochang to worship the soldiers who died in the war. Now Liangzhou Weibei mountain is close to the river, which is very convenient to put water lamps.\"My elder brother and I are going to set the water lamp for my father and mother,\" wheat said of the dead father and mother, but there is no sadness, only a little bit of melancholy. Maybe his father and mother left too early, and his memory has been very weak. He asked Hongshan, \"is brother Shan going to worship?\"\"Go, my mother left early. I'll put one for my mother.\"Several people agreed to look at Heyan: \"ahe brother to go or not?\"Here, he Yan's identity is probably the most mysterious. She doesn't like to talk about family matters with wheat. Hongshan only knows that he Yan came to join the army because of his family's downfall. However, judging from her confident appearance in the martial arts arena before, he Yan is not a child of ordinary people.\"Me? I'll go too. \" He Yan droops eyes, the voice goes down, \"I also have to worship people.\"Wheat, they realized that the atmosphere was not right, and they did not dare to ask. When they were about to turn the corner and talk about something more relaxed.After dinner, the sun set completely, and the moonlight came out from the dark clouds, almost all the recruits of Liangzhou Wei came out.The water lamp has to be folded by itself, and the paper is stacked in several big baskets in the arena. Heyan also went to get one. She was not very good at doing these handwork things. When she saw it, she folded it into the shape of a lotus lamp. She dropped a short white candle in the center of the lotus lamp and handed it to Heyan: \"it's done!\"Thank you very much He Yan praises a way, \"your hand is really clever.\"Wheat embarrassed smile: \"in the past, when the Chinese New Year's day, and big brother folded a lot of lanterns to sell, fold used to. If the paper is bigger, I can make it more beautiful and bigger! \"The stone knocked on his head and said in disapproval, \"this is not the time for you to show off.\"The wheat spat out his tongue and ran to the five deer river with the water lamp in his hand: \"I'll put the lamp first, aho brother, hurry up!\"After the beginning of autumn, the weather in Liangzhou became cooler at night. In the morning, there was a rain, and the cool air did not disperse. The dense forest on the mountain gave birth to cool frost and dew. The moon and stars were rare, which made the river water bright and white.The riverside was already full of people who came to worship their ancestors, and the candle fire swayed, like ten thousand silver flowers shining all over the river, reflecting the beating flames. Red lotus carrying the thoughts of worshippers drifted to the distance, where the water and the sky meet and become a bright light, gradually disappeared.\"Just here, brother ahoe...\" Wheat turned around, a Leng, \"where is ahoe?\"Hongshan and Shi Shi looked at each other, \"I don't know. I was just here.\"He Yan is sitting on a stone, which is not the most open place, so few people put lamps here. He Yan looks at the lotus lamp in his hand silently, and his heart is sour and sour.All of a sudden, he Wanru drowned her in the water, and said to her, \"you are pregnant.\"At that moment, she was more happy than at a loss.But this joy did not last for a moment, and she, her unborn child, sank together in the Xu family's pond.He Yan always felt that she had never felt sorry for anyone in her last life. She had done everything she could to his family, to he Rufei, to Xu Zhiheng, but the only thing she felt guilty about was her flesh and blood. She gave him life, and before she brought him into the world, she killed the possibility for her own reasons. Maybe it was when she was a military general, too many people died under her, and countless evils were created. God would punish her like this. You should punish yourself. Why punish innocent children? She didn't even know whether it was a little girl or a little boy, so she died.He Yan took out the torch, the spark of the torch splashed on the candle, and lit the candle in an instant. The water lamp bloomed slowly in her hand, and the fire reflected in her eyes, forming a small flame. It seemed that tears were about to fall down and were quickly blurred.\"I'm sorry,\" she said in a low voice and sad voice, \"you and my mother have no fate in this life. If there is an afterlife, you must be born into a good family. You will be happy all your life. Don't meet me again.\"\"Me too...\" She put the water lamp into the river, \"I will avenge you.\"The river rippling, gently wrapped in the small water lamp, went forward, he Yan staring at it, has been swaying with countless light spots in the same place, can no longer tell who is who, just take back his eyes, rub his eyes.\"Brother Ho, I didn't expect you to be here!\" An excited voice sounded behind her, \"what a coincidence, you also come to put the water lamp!\"He Yan turned around and saw a young man with red lips and white teeth holding a lamp in his arms. He came to her happily. It was Cheng Lishu.When he came to Heyan's side, he carefully raised the corner of his robe, for fear of being splashed by the river water. He gave Heyan a large number of water lamps in his arms.He Yan asked Is this the water lamp you want to put on\"Yes\"Why so much?\" He Yan was speechless.\"I didn't have so much to let go, and I didn't know the ancestors of our Cheng family. But I don't think my uncle will come today. I'll put it on his behalf. This is my uncle's grandmother's, this is my uncle's, and this is me... \"When he counted them, he could not see half of his sadness. He was so elated that people mistook him for the Lantern Festival lantern, not the Zhongyuan Water Lantern.\"Wait a minute,\" He Yan interrupted, \"why do you put it on behalf of your uncle? Can't he come by himself\"So many people, he won't come.\" Cheng Lishu sighed and shook his head with a broken heart. He said, \"I'll do it for me. Who calls him my uncle.\"He Yan looked at some funny, just because of the past pain is diluted a lot. Although Cheng is less serious about this matter than ordinary people, he seems to be more relaxed. One by one, he ignited the water lamps in his hands, solemnly put them into the river, and prayed nervously not to be blown out by the wind or overturned by the waves. Fortunately, they all went smoothly, and the water lamps gradually drifted into the distance.Cheng Lishu put out the last lamp, breathed a sigh of relief, took out a piece of coarse cloth from his arms and put it on the stone, and then sat down.\"Liangzhouwei is cool at night,\" he muttered. \"It's hot to me a few days ago. I've never been in such a hot summer since I've grown up.\"He Yan laughs. Cheng Lishu used to be in shuojing. The Cheng family must have some ice to cool off in summer. If they stay in the house, they can't get the sun. Of course, it's not as hard as liangzhouwei. She said, \"in this case, why do you come to Liangzhou to suffer with your uncle?\"\"No way,\" Cheng Lishu spread his hands. \"If I don't come out with my uncle, I'll be engaged.\"He Yan one Leng: \"what?\"\"To tell you a secret, I escaped from marriage.\" Cheng Li Su curled her lips. \"I'm still young. How can I get married? Besides, I didn't like her, so I ran away. \"He Yan said: He Yan was surprised that Xiao Jue agreed to take Cheng Lishu with him. He was not afraid that the Cheng family would be dissatisfied with him. After all, he abducted the young master and helped him escape from marriage. Even though he was a relative, he was afraid that there would be a rift in his heart.\"You have a good relationship with governor Xiao.\" He Yan pondered over his words.\"It's OK,\" Cheng Lishu was very proud. \"It's all my initiative to pester him.\"He Yan felt strangely, \"your uncle's temperament is so bad, you can even take the initiative to get over it?\" It's amazing. Who says Cheng Lishu is a \"waste childe\". It's hard for everyone to bear the humiliation.\"My uncle is very strong. If it wasn't for him when I was a child, I couldn't be who I am now.\"Maybe the moonlight is very good tonight. Cheng Lishu is very excited when he talks about the past.Cheng Lishu's mother, Mrs. Cheng, is no less than a few years younger than Xiao Jue's mother. Therefore, when Xiao Jue was born, Mrs. Cheng had already married, and although Cheng Lishu and Xiao Jue were of different generations, they were not very different in age.Although the Cheng family and the Xiao family don't walk around frequently, they are absolutely not indifferent. However, Cheng Lishu didn't see Xiao Jue very much when he was a child. Most of the time, he met his uncle Xiao Jing more often. Xiao Zhongwu has two sons. Xiao Jing, the eldest son of Xiao, was too weak to practice martial arts when he was young. When he got well, he was over the best age to practice martial arts. But Mrs. Xiao didn't want Xiao Jing to join the army, so Xiao Jing took the road of being a civil servant.After Xiao Jue was born, Xiao Zhongwu paid special attention to this son.Xiao Jue did not fail to live up to Xiao Zhongwu's expectations. When she was a child, she showed her talent. Xiao Zhongwu took Xiao Jue to the mountain and was taught by four senior scholars. As for what mountain it was and who was Gao Shi, Cheng Lishu was not sure. In the end of the year, you may only see it once, sometimes not once.When Xiao Jue was 14 years old, she went down the mountain and returned to shuojing, where she entered the Xianchang hall, where she practiced arts and martial arts with her sons. Cheng Lishu was nine years old that year. He was abducted by abductors when he went out to play with his friends on the Mid Autumn Festival. At his age, the abductor is too old, but he is really delicate and delicate. He is like a silver doll in a new year's picture. He abducts him out of the city. Cheng Lishu says that he shouldn't cry every day. He shivers in the carriage.When he woke up, he cried, ate and slept with tears in his eyes. He did not know how long it took for him to wake up. The sound of fighting came from outside the carriage. Cheng Lisu was bruised and bruised by the bumps. When he was crying for help, the car stopped.He quickly lifted the curtain of the carriage and climbed out. He saw the dead people who had fallen all over the ground. They were all shot to the throat. There was not only one abductor, but dozens of them. All the children were tied up in the carriage. At the moment, some of them fell out and some were still in the carriage. A group of people were crying. In the chaos, Cheng Li Su climbs out of the room and comes across a white corner of his robe.He looked up and saw a beautiful young man with a silver crown and a white robe standing in front of him, holding a long sword. The sword was like frost and snow, dripping blood. The color of his blood was not as bright as the young man's lips. His expression was calm and his eyes fell on him.It should be a very fierce painting, but Cheng Li Su felt a little relieved. He shook his rope to hold the boy's leg. He learned his mother's voice when talking to others. Dogleg's flattery said, \"dare to ask the name of the great Xia and where he lives. I'm the young master of the zhilang family of Yousi. If you save me, our family will surely have a lot of rewards.\"The young man took a puff from the corner of his mouth, looked down at him from above, and said coldly, \"I am your uncle.\"\"I knew at that time that he was my little uncle who was always absent from sight.\" Cheng Li Su held his cheek and looked at the moon, \"I thought at that time that this little uncle was really powerful.\"Xiao Jue saved him, as well as those children abducted by abductors. Cheng Lishu felt that there was such an uncle, and he wanted to stick to him. But Xiao Jue didn't like this little nephew very much. After sending him back to Cheng's house, he never came to see him again. Cheng Lishu gave him a post and asked him to come to his house. Xiao Jue never came. Besides, Xiao Jue is also very busy. When Cheng Lishu sees Xiao Jue, there are very few.He Yan thought of the picture described by Cheng Lishu, and he wanted to laugh. Xiao Jue wants to have such a nephew, but also really helpless.\"Then how did you get close afterwards?\" He Yan asked.If it was just a life-saving grace, as Cheng Lishu said, it did not improve their relationship much, then something must have happened later, and the two nephews can now come to Liangzhou Wei together.\"In fact, our Cheng family, including my mother, and relatives and friends who know the Xiao family, don't like uncle very much.\" Cheng Lishu said, \"they prefer the big uncle.\"Xiao's two sons are born in Wei Dynasty. Xiao Jing, the eldest son of Xiao family, is also born with a good appearance. He is as modest as jade. From the aspect of temperament, it is more comfortable to get along with Xiao Jing, but he doesn't like Xiao Jue.\"Why?\" He Yan asked, \"Xiao Dudu didn't save your life. Even if it's for the rescuer, your mother will definitely not dislike him.\"\"That's true, but my uncle has so little time to meet with our relatives that we don't know him well.\"Xiao Jue was rarely in shuojing before she was 14 years old. After she was 14 years old, she entered Xianchang hall again, not to mention her relatives and friends. Even Mrs. Xiao was not very close to her son. Cheng Lishu knew that there were several times when Mrs. Xiao talked to her mother. She was worried and didn't know how to get along with her little son.Since we don't know how to understand people, we naturally have a lot of prejudice. Xiao Jue is lazy and does not like to communicate with others. Compared with his brother Wen Lang Yu, the contrast is more distinct. However, as he Yan said, this is not a dislike. The real dislike is from Xiao Zhongwu's death after the first World War of Mingshui.The sudden death of Xiao Zhongwu was a great blow to the Xiao family. Mrs. Xiao has never experienced the wind and rain. Her husband is the God of her life. After Xiao Zhongwu's death, Mrs. Xiao hanged herself on the beam and left with her husband, leaving only two sons.Xiao Jing and Xiao Jue, the two sons of the Xiao family, were very sad, but Xiao Jue didn't shed a single tear. After the general and his wife were buried, the first thing Xiao Jue did was to go to the Jinluan palace to make a case, and to hold the military power of Nanfu soldiers in his palm.Mrs. Xiao's first seven have not passed, he took the Nanfu soldiers to Pingnan man rebellion. On that day, Xiao Zhongwu died in the battle of the southern barbarians. Some people said that he was revenge for his father, while others said he was eager for quick success and instant benefit. No matter for his father's death or his mother's death, Xiao Jue did not show excessive sadness. So the sign of indifference and hardness of heart was printed on him.The capital city is short of the second son of Xiao, Jin Zunyu GUI. Others can only learn about Xiao Jue's recent situation from the battlefield. It is said that he killed generals when he was young, and countless people died under his sword, which was even more severe and inhumane.\"Have you ever heard of Zhao Nuo?\" Cheng Li asked.He Yan vaguely felt that the name was very familiar, but he did not know where he had heard of it. He shook his head and said, \"I don't know.\"\"Zhao Nuo is the legitimate eldest son of the Minister of Hubu, who was once the governor of Jingzhou.\" At this point, Cheng Lishu looked gloomy. \"In fact, the misunderstanding of uncle by Cheng family and Xiao's relatives and friends is caused by this person.\"www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although the world knows that Xiao's second son is excellent in both literature and martial arts, he is still young and can't afford to shoulder the heavy responsibility. Zhao Nuo is the governor of Jingzhou. He is lustful, greedy and ignorant. When Xiao Jue first arrived in Jingzhou, he didn't pay attention to Xiao Jue. It's very rude to make jokes at times. That's all right. In the first World War of Jingzhou, Xiao Jue led his troops to the battlefield. Zhao Nuo was greedy for life and death in the rear. He misdirected and delayed the fighters, causing many soldiers to die innocently. Xiao Jue saw that he was so arrogant that he was bound up and taken down.Zhao Nuo's father is the Secretary of the Ministry of war. He himself has been in Jingzhou for many years. Naturally, countless people intercede with each other. There are many high-ranking officials and nobles who bully and seduce him. However, he deceives Xiao Jue when he is young and has no relatives here.\"He is the governor of Jingzhou. His father is the Minister of the Ministry of finance. How many people in the imperial court make friends with the Zhao family. You offend him, and you can't do anything in the future!\"Xiao Jue was not moved, but said with a contemptuous smile: \"however, Shangshu is so rampant. Even if he worships the prime minister, I will kill him.\"Three days later, Xiao Jue surrounded Zhao Nuo's residence and pushed him to the stele Hall of the dead soldiers and beheaded him.\"The Zhao family is actually related to the Xiao family, and the Cheng family, so they have something to do with each other,\" Cheng Li Su recalled. \"Zhao Nuo, by right, should be related to us. At that time, my mother wrote a letter to ask her uncle to be open-minded and stay on the line. \"\"But my uncle didn't listen.\" He laughed, a little helpless, and a little proud.\"Don't you fear to be provoked in front of your majesty when governor Xiao acts like this?\" He Yan thought, \"your majesty will be dissatisfied with it.\"\"It's my big brother, asking the same questions as me.\" Cheng Lishu said happily: \"I also think my uncle's action is too imprudent.\"Later, a long time later, the young man had stopped being romantic, and became introverted and calm. Cheng Li asked, \"uncle, are you not afraid that your majesty will estrange you?\"The youth is reading a book, smell speech just phase ran a smile, light way: \"he dare not.\"The emperor did not dare, but the ministers were not afraid.In fact, it is true. Even if the officials in the imperial court said all the bad things about him, the Jinluan hall in the Ministry of Hubu asked for punishment in the end. It is because Xiao Jue, with the soldiers of Nanfu, defeated the southern barbarians.At the time of employing people, a dead governor, a general in a million, Emperor Xuanwen was not blind, so he naturally knew how to choose.However, Emperor Wenxuan did not dare to punish Xiao Jue, which did not mean that there were no rumors in the capital city of Shuo. The Liangzi of Zhao Tong and Xiao Jue, the ministers of the Ministry of Hubu, ended up here. People who had made friends with Zhao Tong naturally could not see Xiao Jue well. But originally and Xiao family relations good family, also coincidentally alienated Xiao Jue.For one thing, he was cold and harsh, and could order his relatives to be beheaded without mercy. Secondly, he was so arrogant that he didn't even put his Majesty in his eyes. In the future, he would inevitably offend others and implicate his relatives and friends around him.Because of their close relationship, the Cheng family and the Xiao family do not have to break up contact. However, they prefer to associate with Xiao Jing than Xiao Jue.\"My mother told me not to go too close to my little uncle,\" Cheng Lishu said, \"saying that he didn't want to be intimate.\"He Yan thought: \"Xiao Dudu is not that kind of person.\"\"I know.\" Cheng Lishu said with a smile, \"I always know.\"The two young masters of the Xiao family, the eldest one, is gentle and gentle, and makes people feel like a spring breeze when they get along with each other. More friendly and warm-hearted, no light wind and moon, everyone loves. The second young master's appearance and talent are excellent, but probably for the sake of fairness, his temperament is not so pleasant.What's more, after the massacre of Zhao Nuo, Xiao Jue's reputation of \"jade face governor, young murderer\" spread out, and others dare not look up to it. Of course, Zhao Tong helped, but Xiao Jue himself left a lot of rumors. For example, when his parents were buried, he didn't shed a drop of tears, so he went to the Jinluan palace to fight for military power. He left without even passing the first seven, and left Xiao to clean up the mess.Every time relatives get together on Chinese New Year's day, he doesn't like to talk to people, and he just leaves after a quick meeting.Cheng Lisu still remembers that it was a summer day. Bai Rongwei, his great aunt, entertained relatives of the Cheng family in the mansion for a summer banquet. Now the Xiao family is sparsely populated and rarely has such a lively time.Cheng Lishu also went with him. At that time, Xiao Jue had been granted the title of general Yun. He returned to shuojing shortly after his 18th birthday.The women's family members all eat snacks and drink tea together in the hall, while the men talk about current politics with Xiao Jing. Cheng Lishu looked around and didn't see Xiao Jue.He was very naughty when he was a child. He hated ghosts and was not liked to play with him. Cheng Lishu had fun on his own. He ran to the backyard of the Xiao family. He saw a spotted orange cat at the gate of the ancestral hall. He ran after the cat and ran all the way behind the screen in the ancestral hall.It was summer, and the weather changed as it was said. In the evening, there were already dark clouds pressing on the head of the city, thundering and suddenly pouring rain.He was holding an orange cat in his arms and wanted to go out. Suddenly, he heard people's footsteps and someone came in.Cheng Lishu stealthily pokes out a head from behind the screen, and sees his little uncle, who can't see the head but the tail, come in.The young man is wearing a crow blue cloud Satin round collar robe, wearing a gold crown, posture and appearance, such as a variety of pearls and jades. When he was a boy, he liked to wear white robes, which was elegant and bright, but now he only likes to wear dark clothes when he is old, which makes him more and more cold and unpredictable.Xiao Jue walked into the ancestral hall, picked up three sticks of incense from the side and lit it up slowly.Cheng Lisu's eyes widened.It's probably that there are rumors about Xiao Jue from outside. Cheng Lishu has heard of it. Xiao Jue never gives incense to her parents. She is a heartless person. But now it seems that rumors are not always true.He was very slow, but very careful. First, he dusted off the dust near the censer, wiped it with a cloth, and then lit the incense and inserted it into the censer. The smoke curled up from the censer and dispersed in the air. And he did not leave, did not speak, so drooping eyes stand, do not know what is thinking.It's hot and humid in summer. The water vapor comes in from outside. It's sticky and greasy. The thunder is louder. The young people's eyes are closed and their looks are calm. The rain outside washes the eaves, but the room is quiet and inconceivable. Cheng Lisu didn't understand what happened, but he felt the atmosphere was strange. He didn't dare to come out of the atmosphere. Holding the cat in his arms, he sat behind the screen with his cold little uncle for more than half an hour.After a long time, the rain stopped and Xiao Jue left the ancestral hall.From he entered the ancestral hall, until he left, he only put on three sticks of incense, said nothing, did nothing, just stayed quietly. But it is these three incense sticks that make Cheng Lishu aware of the distinct softness of this uncle's chilly appearance.He is not a heartless man in the neighborhood.There are many people in the world, the heart is always hidden under the cold appearance, but it is not without, just poor expression, understatement and a pass.Others always say that Cheng Lishu is still like a child, innocent and ignorant of things. However, in children's eyes, he can distinguish between good and evil. He doesn't think that this little uncle is as mean as his mother said. He likes him more than Mr Xiao.\"My uncle is very strong,\" Cheng Lishu said, looking into her eyes seriously. \"If you stay with him for a long time, you will also like him.\"He Yan laughs, can't help rubbing his head, \"I know, I already know.\"\u2026\u2026Shuojing, thousands of miles away, today's spring to the river is also a spark.The water lamp reflects the lights on the water and under the water. It can't distinguish the sky and the earth. Today, it's drizzling. It's because the water lamp has a small paper cover, so it can't be watered out by the rain.In the ancestral hall of Xiao's house, someone is offering incense.Since the death of Mr. and Mrs. On weekdays, it's quiet, but occasionally, it's a little lonely.Xiao Jing was dressed in a jade robe. He was as straight and warm as green bamboo. Standing at the same place with Bai Rongwei beside him, everyone would like to praise the fairy couple. Incense curl, outside the autumn rain, cool wind, he will take off his body's Cape, cover in Bai Rong micro body, warm voice: \"cold weather, be careful to catch cold.\"\"I'm not cold.\" Bai Rong gave him a smile and worried, \"I don't know how the weather is in Liangzhou.\"\"Tonight is the mid Yuan Festival,\" Xiao Jing looked at the drizzle in the yard and said, \"if Huaijin is in your house, it will be fine.\"\"He won't come to the ancestral hall,\" Bai Rong shook his head. \"He won't enter the ancestral hall.\"\"He will come in.\" Xiao Jing's answer is very positive.Bai Rong looked at him with surprise, \"but I have never seen him...\"\"It's raining today. There's thunder,\" Xiao Jing said with a smile. \"He'll come in.\"\"Ruby, I don't understand.\" Bai Rong was puzzled.\"When Huaijin was very young, she was taken to the mountains by her father and taught by Gao Shi.\" Xiao Jing took her hand and said in a soft voice, \"we seldom see him all year round. He is proud and proud. His mother doesn't like him to dance with a knife and stick. In fact, the relationship between Huaijin and his mother has not been good. \"Mrs. Xiao is the niece of the Empress Dowager. It was the Empress Dowager who married this marriage. Xiao Zhongwu Sheng is handsome and powerful, and Mrs. Xiao likes him very much. But after the marriage, the contradiction between the two gradually revealed. Mrs. Xiao is a delicate flower raised in the house for a long time. She can't bear any grievances. Xiao Zhongwu is a general in the end. She is not as careful as a gentleman of the aristocratic family. Although she has never taken a wife and concubine, she can't help but feel dissatisfied.The two of them had the most serious quarrel in those years because of Xiao Jue.Mrs. Xiao didn't want her two sons to take up martial arts. She didn't like killing animals and blood. She believed in Buddhism. At the beginning, Xiao Jing missed the best opportunity to practice martial arts because of his health, so he had to do it. Xiao Jue has been the successor of Xiao Zhong Wudang since childhood.Mrs. Xiao didn't want her son to follow Xiao Zhongwu's old ways, but Xiao Zhongwu, who was always obedient to Mrs. Xiao, did not listen to his wife's dissuasion for the first time.My son and his mother have been separated for a long time. Even though they are related by blood, they are unfamiliar. Moreover, Xiao Jue was not as clever and docile as Xiao Jing when she was a child, and occasionally showed a rebellious side. In the face of this cold and proud son, Mrs. Xiao did not know how to get along with him.Mrs. Xiao and Xiao Jue show good, Xiao Jue's performance is also light. Mrs. Xiao likes to taste tea and discuss poetry, but Xiao Jue likes to practice sword and horse riding. Although Xiao Jue's poetry is also very good, it is Xiao Jing who accompanies Mrs. Xiao in the end.\"My mother told me privately that she was afraid of Huaijin.\" Xiao Jing said here, seems to be a little funny, \"she later simply did not deliberately go to talk to Huaijin, two people get along, always very polite.\"\"Huaijin is actually very poor.\" Xiao Jing's smile was sad.\"My father is cold-blooded and has no tolerance for Huaijin. I learned later that he suffered a lot in the mountains. He did not say, we all thought that he had a good life. If it was me, I would probably not be able to hold on for long before I ran away. \" He laughed at himself.White Rong micro pacified patted his hand, \"nonsense, you can also do well.\"Xiao Jing remembers the year Xiao Jue just came down from the mountain. He asked the younger brother, \"how about the mountain?\"The youth stretched a waist, a light smile, \"not bad.\"\"Not bad\" three words, hiding all he had suffered, left to the outside, just a high spirited young master Xiao.\"Others say that my father is strict with his mother. My father treats him severely, but my mother is not always with him. Later, she finally comes back, but she is too polite because she is afraid of him. My mother thought he liked sweets, so she often made him osmanthus candy. Huaijin ate it clean every time. Even I was cheated. Later, he said that Huaijin never ate sugar. \"\"Because this is the way that a mother can express her love for him, he eats it. Even if he doesn't like it, even though no one has asked him what he likes to eat.\"Bai Rong sighed and did not speak.\"Although I am his elder brother, I never seem to have helped him. Others always say that he is heartless, not as good as me. However, I don't know that the reason why I can be the eldest son Xiao today is because he has undertaken a lot for me. I understand that, and so does he. \" He laughed bitterly. \"Now, I really regret that my father didn't let me start martial arts. If I didn't become a civil servant, I would be the one who would shoulder the burden of the Xiao family today. Huaijin doesn't have to be misunderstood by outsiders. \"\"We all know that Huaijin is painstaking.\" White Rong tiny light voice way: \"father and mother also can know.\"Xiao Jing looked at the memorial tablet on the ancestral hall and said, \"when I was a child, Huaijin was not very close to her mother. She ran outside in two or three days. In fact, he put her mother in his heart.\"\"My mother is timid by nature, easily frightened, and most afraid of thunder. Every time there is thunder, if Huaijin is in the house, she will find a reason to sit in her mother's room. Every time she saw Huaijin, she thought about how to get along with Huaijin, so she forgot about thunder. When the rain stops, Huaijin will leave\"I didn't understand at first. Once, when it rained, I was outside with him, but he suddenly said that he had something important to do and he had to go back to his house. When I got back to the house, he said that he wanted to eat osmanthus candy. His mother was busy cooking for him. I suddenly realized that Huaijin was just afraid that his mother would be frightened by the thunder, so he made an excuse to come back. \"Hearing this, Bai Rongwei also laughed and shook his head: \"Huaijin is really...\"\"It's a pity that my mother didn't know what Huaijin meant to her until she died.\" Xiao Jing astringent way, \"if you know, maybe today will not be this result.\"Bai Rong Wei firmly held his hand: \"the spirit of mother in heaven will understand.\"\"He was with her before she died, and after she died. As long as he is at home, he will come to the ancestral hall to accompany his mother whenever it rains or thunders. \" Xiao Jing smile, \"this is a secret, I did not tell others, I want to Huaijin him, also do not want others to know.\"Xiao Jue is too proud. He does these things like continuous spring rain, moistening things silently, but he doesn't ask too much. What is the result. But in the end, after serious consideration, he felt that he was the one who owed the most.\"That's why you said that if he was in shuojing today, he would come to the ancestral hall to accompany his mother.\" Bai Rong Wei suddenly.\"He is such a man.\" Xiao Jing said with a smile.The smoke in the censer floated into the air and slowly dispersed without trace. The past has become the past, and the unspoken care and company have no chance to explain.\"If Bi, you should know,\" Bai Rong Wei pulled Xiao Jing's hand and said gently, \"Huaijin does these things to keep the Xiao family. Now Huaijin is far away in Liangzhou, and Xu Xiang's party still regards the Xiao family as a thorn in the eye. You should keep up your spirits and not let Huaijin's efforts go to waste. \"Xiao Jing slightly a Zheng, then smile, he said: \"I naturally know.\"\"I know you love Huaijin,\" Bai Rong said softly, \"but I also love you. Huaijin takes on a lot of responsibilities, but you don't? Xu Xiangming secretly suppressed the Xiao family and searched for your mistakes. How could you be so careful in the court? \"\"You don't have to worry,\" Xiao Jing said with a smile, \"the most difficult time has passed.\"Bai Rong Wei Zheng ran for a moment and then laughed, \"you're right.\"The next rain continued, the courtyard of shuojing was drenched with a piece of land. In Liangzhou, thousands of miles away, there were also some people leaning on the window. His green silk is hanging on his shoulder, smooth and cold like silk, and his expression is light. There is a rustling sound in the distance. I don't know who is blowing the tune of his hometown. He listened and listened, and he laughed softly.The smile was self mocking and lonely. A moment later, he closed the window and isolated the night outside.The lights in the room beat slowly, reflecting his starry pupil. On the table was a long wooden plate with scattered grains of rice. In different places, small flags made of red horn cloth were inserted.Shen Han and Liang Ping were all in the room, around the table, staring at Xiao Jue's movements.These are the places where the flags are placed? Is it too much? \"\"Not much.\" The young man's posture is like jade, holding a chess piece, and lighting the top red flag, \"seven days later, the white moon mountain is fighting for the flag.\"www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He Yan was afraid that he would not allow himself to participate in the flag fight. He said in a hurry: \"very good, excellent, very good. Do you want to fight with meLiang Ping couldn't hold his face when he thought of riding and shooting with He Yan before. He coughed softly: \"no, you can do it if you're OK. Go up the mountain with you tomorrow.\"After he left, he Yan almost did not cheer.Hong Shan said with a smile, \"now you can fulfill your wish.\"\"I don't know what it's like to fight for the flag,\" wheat begged, looking at Heyan. \"After he goes down the mountain, he will tell us about it word by word.\"\"Isn't your brother going up the mountain, too? Why just ask ah Ho? \" Hongshan Road.\"My brother won't say it.\" The wheat curled its mouth.Although there are tens of thousands of new recruits in Liangzhou Wei, everyone can not fight for the flag on the mountain. Moreover, they are only selected for the vanguard camp, who perform particularly well in the martial arts arena on weekdays. Both wheat and Hongshan can only be regarded as mediocre in qualification, and are not in the line of competing for the flag. Only stone and Heyan were chosen to go up the mountain.\"The wound on your hand is not all right.\" Hongshan worries for Heyan, \"when the time comes, don't fight hard. If you can't fight, you can run, you know? All Liangzhou guards know you are good and don't care about winning or losing that time. \"\"It's too bad for ahogo,\" said wheat. \"If it wasn't for ahogo's injury, the first thing would be ahoga.\"\"It's OK.\" He Yan comforted: \"even if I was injured, the first is certainly me.\"The rest of the house laughed.\"Again! We're going to set up a challenge arena on the mountain again. Does anyone want to bet on dry cakes? \"\"Bet fart, I haven't lost last time.\"A noisy, but let he Yan's heart a little relaxed. In fact, she has not been fighting for the flag for a long time, and her memory of the last flag fight is not very good, and she is not the most brilliant one. Who knows what the result is this time.However, compared with the results of the flag fight, the most important thing is the performance in the process of flag fighting. If you want to enter Jiuqi camp, you don't just look at the result of this time. If you want to come to Baiyue mountain, all the coaches will hide in the dark and have a good view of their performance. The one who shows the best performance may have a chance to enter the nine flag camp.Therefore, this is not so much a competition as a play, and the audience is only one person from the beginning to the end, that is the second young master Xiao. In order to win the favor of Xiao Jue, she has to work up a spirit of 120000 and make every step beautiful and thoughtful.She should be able to do it.\u2026\u2026Outside the station, Shen Han gave Xiao Jue a bow: \"governor, you are all ready.\"Green ear in the side step two, Xiao Jue stroked its head, way: \"set out.\"Shen Han nodded and suddenly remembered something: \"Master Cheng's side...\"\"I've sent someone to protect him in the dark. Don't worry.\" He looked at the direction of Baiyue mountain, \"it's almost time. Let them start at once.\"\"Yes,\" Shen Han said\u2026\u2026When he Yan comes to the arena, he doesn't see Liang Ping, but he sees Du Mao. Du Mao holds a book in his hand and points out the names of Heyan and Shi Shi. They come forward and find Jiang Jiao, Huang Xiong and Wang Ba standing on one side.\"Five people fighting for the flag are in a group, you are in the same group.\" Du Mao said: \"after a stick of incense, you will start from here on foot to mount Baiyue. You are not allowed to cross the mountain. Red flags are planted everywhere in the mountain. You must go back here before sunset. \" After a pause, he added: \"there are 30 groups of recruits going up the mountain in this fight for the flag. After returning to this place, the number of red flags in their hands is the number, and the group that wins the most flags is the group that wins.\"\"There are weapons on the weapon rack. Please pick one that is convenient. The bow and crossbow are not available. Fight for the flag on the white moon mountain. Don't hurt your colleagues. Stop when you click. Don't hurt your life. Don't worry about the friendship of your friends. \"Several people nodded together.Jiang Jiao chose the spear he was good at, while Huang Xiong took his big sword with his gold back. Although Wang BA was good at bow and crossbow, he could not use bow and crossbow in this battle. So he chose a phoenix head axe and looked at it smartly. The stone took an iron headed stick. When people looked at Heyan, they thought he would take the mandarin duck sword, but she took a nine knot whip on the shelf.\"You...\" The stone hesitated. They all know he Yan is good at knife, crossbow and spear, but they don't know how she uses whip. The whip is not as powerful as the sword.\"You'll know when you get to the mountain.\" He Yan a smile, \"let's go.\"Several people then each with weapons, toward the white moon mountain rushed away.Du Mao said with a loud smile behind them: \"I'm waiting for your good news here. Go, boys and girls!\"The birds in the forest were scared to fly around. People didn't enter the forest and disappeared in the blink of an eye. Ma Damei and Liang Ping came from a distance. They led their horses and said to Liang Ping, \"it's almost time. Let's start.\"\u2026\u2026Thirty groups of people, more than 100 recruits in the white moon mountain, such as fish into the sea, nothing to see. Just stepping into the woods, Wang Ba suddenly said, \"wait a minute!\"Several people stopped and looked at him: \"what?\"\"Before us, some people have advanced into the mountain. What if they are ambushing in the forest at this moment and we step into the trap?\"\"Don't worry,\" He Yan said with a smile: \"the fight for the flag has just begun. Everyone is busy to grab the flag. We have no flag in our hands now. What's the use of ambushing us. I guess everyone is going to Go by the white stone in the south of the mountain. \"\"Why is Shannan white stone?\" Jiang Jiao asked.\"Stone, show them the map.\" He Yan looks at the stone.The stone took out a roll of paper from his arms and slowly unfolded it. However, there were several red dots on the paper, which had only a general orientation. Each group of flag makers will have a map, which shows the location of the flag, but only the general orientation. The map is also very scrawly. Even there are no trees and rivers marked. There are only four directions in southeast, northwest and northwest.\"You see, there are twenty flags.\" He Yan pointed to the red dot at the bottom, \"the side closest to the foot of the mountain should be the mountainside part. When recruits enter the mountain, they will naturally first search for the nearest flag and want to get it in their pocket. There is a stream beside the white stone in the south of the mountain. There is no tree cover around it. This flag should be the best one to look for. Therefore, most of the brothers who are more advanced than us in the mountains have gone to look for this flag. \"\"How do you know it's Shannan white stone?\" Huang Xiong doubted, \"there is only one dot on it.\"\"I'm just guessing, but don't worry. When I was on a mountain tour before, I recorded the road, so even if there is a deviation, I can find it.\"\"Didn't you get chased by wolves when you went on a mountain tour before?\" Wang Ba couldn't help but say, \"do you still remember the way?\"\"Well, when I was chased by the wolf, I also looked down the road by the way, and when I came back, I remember it again. It's very familiar.\" He Yan looked at him with a smile, \"you have to believe your boss, absolutely no problem.\"Hearing this, Wang Ba turned his head and stopped looking at Heyan.He Yan laughs. It is necessary to remember the terrain and all roads on the battlefield. She once stayed in Qianfeng camp. The most important thing is to find out the enemy's situation and surrounding environment at the beginning, so as to judge the layout.\"What are we waiting for now? Go straight to the white stone in the south of the mountain to grab the flag! \" Huang Xiong carried the sword on his back, \"how can I get there?\"He Yan said: It's a pathless man.\"We are not going in this direction.\" He Yan Dao.\"Why?\" Huang Xiong frowned.\"At the moment, there must be a lot of people fighting for the same flag. If you want to grab it, there are too many opponents. It's not cost-effective.\" He Yan shook his head, \"don't go to join in the excitement. We're going in this direction. \" She pointed to the opposite direction on the map, where there was also a red dot.\"There are dense forests here. The road is very steep and it is easy to get lost. I thought for a second that it would be difficult to find the flag unless it was someone who remembered the road clearly. So it should not be easy to be taken away. Let's go directly and take the flag first. \"\"There are only 20 flags. I think we can win if we get more than half of them. So in the beginning, we'll look for these hidden but unnoticed flags to save energy. After all, it's not necessarily the strength of your hands to fight for the flag. It's here. \" She pointed to her head.Is this a different way to boast that you are smart? Some of them were speechless. Huang Xiong asked, \"do you really remember the way?\"\"Absolutely true.\" He Yan blinked and said, \"I don't forget passing by.\"The young man was dressed in a strong red suit. Although he was thin and weak, his eyes were extremely cunning and smart. The sunlight through the gaps in the woods shone on him, showing that he was all shining.\"All right, all right. Let's go.\" Wang BA was the first to say, \"go quickly. You'll be robbed by others later. Let's fight for a bird!\"Shitou and Heyan are together. Naturally, they don't say anything. Jiang Jiao is young. Moreover, he admired Heyan's heart for Bi gun, and there was no objection. Several people agreed. Huang Xiong, the oldest, didn't say anything. The most important thing was that he was a road blind. If there was no one to lead the way, he would be able to stay in it for three days and three nights.So the five men, who happened to be the same, led by Heyan.The five of them walked up the mountain together. Because they didn't ride a horse and the mountain road was rough, people were worried that he Yan would not be able to keep up with him at first. But when they saw that she was light and relaxed all the way, they gradually relaxed and knew that he Yan's physical strength should be no problem when he reached the top of the mountain.And he Yan, as she said, seemed to have taken the road of Baiyue mountain countless times, remembering all kinds of paths. She avoided every avenue that might collide with other groups, and took the trail. The road was more difficult to walk, but the distance was much closer. Moreover, every seemingly pathless Bush was pulled away by her, and she walked out of another road.\"You have to think more about everything,\" He Yan sighed. \"Is the road straight? Can't you sing it? Do people have to walk on the ground? Can't you learn gecko to climb on the wall? The rule is that dead people are alive. With snacks, many things are not so complicated. \"All of them said, \"well\"I'm 46 this year,\" Huang said in a stuffy voiceWhile walking, he Yan said, \"well.\"\"You're only sixteen this year.\"By implication, how can a 16 year old boy teach his elders a lesson? The elder has eaten more salt than you have eaten rice!He Yan said, \"but you still don't know the way.\"Huang Xiong can't answer this question. Who is he? He's completely invulnerable to oil and salt.As they spoke, they turned over a mound and saw a small flag hidden in the bushes, standing alone on the ground.\"Found it!\" Jiang Jiao eyes a bright, three or two steps forward to hold the flag in the palm, \"really there is!\"\"It was found.\" Wang Ba mumbled and saw the young man leaning against the tree and said leisurely, \"I said so long ago that I will never forget passing by.\"The supervisor, who was hiding in the distance of the Bush, took two steps outside and murmured, \"what's the matter? How could it be found so soon? \"According to the law, the flag of this place is hidden deeply, and the road is not easy to walk. At present, most people should fight for the flag of Baishi in the south of Shannan. However, at this time, they came here straight from the beginning, and there was no obstacle on the way. They Did you know in advance where to put the flag?\"Don't worry about it. Write back.\" The supervisor quickly wrote a few words on the note and sealed it into the copper tube on the pigeon's leg.\u2026\u2026In the room of the garrison, black and white pieces were scattered on the chessboard, and someone was playing chess.A pigeon flew to the young man's shoulder and cooed twice. The latter took the copper tube from his leg and drew out a note to read it.Shen Han looked at it doubtfully.Xiao Jue handed the note to him. Shen Han took it over and looked at it. After a while, he was shocked and said, \"did you find it so quickly?\"\"No surprise.\" Xiao Jue grinned and her eyes became clearer and clearer. He said, \"at this moment, he went straight to this place in the early morning.\"The nearest one of the 20 banners on Baiyue mountain is beside the white stone in the south of the mountain. Although some people have found it in the early morning, there are too many people who have come to grab the flag, so far they have not won. On the contrary, he Yan's hand became the first flag to be found, because no one came to grab it.\"He remembers the way?\" Shen Han is suspicious. Even if there is a beginning of the patrol, one can't remember the road so well, and at the beginning the recruits did not know the significance of the patrol, so they would not deliberately remember the road. It's amazing to remember half of it.\"Not necessarily, maybe,\" Xiao Jue said, \"he just knew about today's flag fight in advance.\"He knew in advance that he would write down or think deeply when he was patrolling the mountain. He Yan got the specific map of Baiyue mountain from the beginning. So when you see the flag, you will know where it is.Shen Han frowned, \"so he has doubts. What's next? \"\"Go on,\" the young man said with a faint smile, \"it's not over yet. The outcome is unknown until the end. It's not urgent.\"\u2026\u2026After he found the flag, he continued to walk up the mountain with the other four people. However, her road seems to be closer to other people's roads. Occasionally, some of them have to run into the recruits of other groups. Before the other party finds out, Heyan lets the people lie down in the grass or behind the bushes, and doesn't meet them directly.Wang BA was a little discontented. He was used to being the head of mountain bandits. When did he feel so timid, he only said, \"we are not afraid of them. What can we hide from? I don't think we should hide any more. Go straight up and grab it! \"\"It's still early.\" He Yan explained patiently with him, \"the other recruits we met may not have flags, but we do. Once there is a conflict, there may not be booty after winning, but it is not cost-effective to lose even the flag in your hand when you lose? \"Seeing Wang Ba still reluctantly, she unfolded the map in her hand and showed it to Wang Ba: \"I've seen that, as just now, there are three flags hidden in the deep forest. We've got one. We've got the other two. It should be easy to find this road, and the last one is close to the top of the mountain. \"\"We'll get the three sides first, and then we'll get to the top of the mountain.\" She said, \"when we get to the top of the mountain, we will think about the future.\"Wang BA was forced to talk about this. He said, \"this is what you said. There are two sides. If not,\" he waved his fist, \"I want you to look good!\"He Yan Si was fearless and smilingly took his fist away: \"I can't be so rude to the boss.\" She looked into the distance. \"Let's go.\"The sun is getting bigger.Although the depth of the forest was not as hot as the foot of the mountain, because of the rugged mountain road, everyone was sweating. There are many birds, animals, insects and ants on the mountain. There are also several snakes on the road. What is surprising is that Heyan is very good at dealing with these accidents. Compared with Wang Balai, she is just like the Lord of a mountain. If we don't all know that he Yan is a new soldier from shuojing, I'm afraid others will misunderstand her as a native hunter on Baiyue mountain.She also did not lie, although the road with rough, but actually let her find another two flags unimpeded. Finally, a flag was collected by Jiang Jiao. Huang Xiong looked at the front and said with some uncertainty: \"the front is the top of the mountain.\"He Yan nods: \"good.\" She looked down the hill and said, \"the shortcut we took, we didn't meet other groups that were faster than our feet. We should be the first to come to the top of the mountain. \"Other recruits were busy fighting for the flag. They avoided other people and only looked for the flag, which was very convenient and saved a lot of time.Wang Ba sat down under the tree, unscrewed the water bottle on his waist and drank a large amount of water. He said, \"on the way, he did nothing but kill two snakes. He took two axes for nothing. I said we're here to look for something, not to rob? \"It's very subdued to avoid other people looking for things. Although Huang Xiong and Jiang Jiao didn't say so, they agreed with Wang BA's words.The stone opened his mouth and said, \"you can win, you don't have to stick to the way.\"\"Brother Shitou is still smart,\" He Yan said with a smile: \"if you want to have a competition, why not go directly to the martial arts arena. It's not personal skill that tests flag fighting. \"She clapped her hands, looked at the crowd and laughed again, \"but I never said we were going to hide here all the time.\" He Yan said: \"let's get ready.\"\"What are you going to do?\" Jiang Jiao is puzzled.He Yan smile: \"rob.\"www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The weather is favorable, the place is favorable and the people are in harmony. Is it not a pity that we do not rob?\" Her name is Wang Ba: \"brother Wang, you can do your old job this time. Do you remember the rules?\"Wang BA was angry and complacent. He said, \"of course I know it.\"\"Then step on the plate first.\"\"What do you mean by stepping on the plate?\" Jiang Jiao is at a loss.\"I know that,\" Huang Xiong explained for him, \"Greenwood slang, explore the wind in advance to explore the surrounding areas.\"Wang Ba snorted and said to Heyan, \"you still know the jargon.\"\"I know that.\" He Yan said, \"if you don't have any objection, how about I arrange it?\"Everyone looked at her.\"The terrain here is high and we have come early. When we want to come here and wait for other groups to come here, we must be tired and relaxed. We just have to ambush here and take their flag. We have five people in total. One of us needs to go up the tree to investigate the situation, and the rest ambush around. This person is me, \"He Yan pointed to himself,\" I'm in the tree. \"\"When people came, brother Wang was in front of them and introduced their people into our circle. Jiangjiao brothers and stone, one of you holding a long stick, one holding a long gun, distributed around. Uncle Huang presses behind the array, so that they can be surrounded in the middle. At this time, I will come down from the tree again, and my nine knots whip will take the opportunity to take away their flagIt suddenly dawned on everyone that he Yan wanted to choose the nine knots whip. It's really chaotic. There may not be any chance to get close. But as long as the whip rolls up from a distance, the flag can be rolled over.\"Why should I be bait?\" Wang BA was dissatisfied: \"I can crush the array.\"\"Because you are the most powerful,\" He Yan said without changing his face. \"If the rest of us take the flag to attract people, others will doubt it. You are not the same. You are strong in the recruits. It's reasonable to grab the flag. It's better for you to hold it.\"Jiang Jiao wanted to laugh a little, but finally he held back. Shi Shi and Huang Xiong lowered their heads in silence. Wang BA was the only one who deeply believed that he was dissatisfied with the arrangement of Heyan, and immediately disappeared.\"But is that really possible?\" Jiang Jiao some doubt, \"if they are above us, how to do?\"\"Don't worry, they have enough time to rest. What's more, they'll only make a mess of themselves by encircling the left and the right, attacking and defending at the same time. What's more, our aim is not to fight with them, but to fight for the flag. \"\"According to the book of war, those who are first in the field of war but wait for the enemy are lost, and those who are later in the battlefield and tend to fight are laborious. Therefore, those who are good at fighting can cause others, but not to them.\"Among the first five people here, only Jiang Jiao and Heyan have studied. Several other people have not responded, but Jiang Jiao looks at Heyan and asks in a complicated way: \"have you read the book of war?\"\"A little bit.\" He Yan replied.Huang Xiong looked at Jiang Jiao, then he Yan, and sighed, \"I remember that you said you had read the book of arms, and now you have read the book of war. If you are so capable, you will be famous for thousands of miles one day and will not be with us.\"\"I don't deserve it.\" He Yan said with a smile.\"If you are rich, don't forget us.\" Wang Ba said in a low voice, probably ashamed, and added: \"but you don't look like you can be rich.\"He Yan shrugged his shoulders and said, \"now let's find a place to hide. I'll go up to the tree first. You can eat and have a rest. Brother Jiang will give the flag to brother Wang and listen to my whistle later. As soon as you whistle, you can bring me a messageThere was no objection, they all scattered around and found a place to hide. He Yan found a tall camphor tree and climbed up.She was very flexible in climbing trees. Wang Ba murmured: \"it's like a four legged snake\"He Yan climbed to the top of the tree in one breath, found the most luxuriant place to sit down. At the moment, when the wind came, the face was cool and comfortable. This is a high position, can have a panoramic view of the neighborhood. Seeing that no other recruits have come up for the time being, she took out a small piece of dry cake from her arms, chewed two mouthfuls, and drank some water.After eating this small piece of cake and lying on the branch for a few minutes, we could see that there was a rustling noise on the path down the road nearby. There's a group of recruits coming up.He Yandeng sat up straight and hid in the leaves without moving. He whistled softly in his mouth, blowing three times. Her whistle was the same as that of a partridge. If she had not said hello in advance, Jiang Jiao and his party would not have distinguished her.Huang Xiong, who was hiding in the dark, winked at Wang ba. Wang Ba hung up the kettle and stood up with the flag in his hand and went out.I don't know if he is used to doing this kind of robbery business. Even if he is used to doing this kind of robbery, he can't even see a clue. Wang Ba has to look around every two steps, as if he was just here, exploring the way.As he walked, he ran into the group of recruits who had come up the mountain.\"You...\" Before the recruits could speak, Wang Ba covered his waist and ran back. He did not cover good, a cover, then teach people to see his waist that red flag.The recruits were stunned, and then excited, and said, \"he's alone. He has a red flag. Brothers, grab it!\"Hearing this, the group of people immediately pursued him. Wang Ba seemed to be left alone, not fond of fighting. He only scolded him while running: \"bah, don't follow your grandfather! I'll kill you againThe group looked at the red flag in Wang BA's hand as a bag of things. They laughed and chased after him and said, \"you chop it! Brother, pay the flag and don't kill it\"I'll pay your grandmother! It's not polite to chase me again! \" Wang Ba warned.\"Who is rude to whom?\" The group laughed and chased after him. When they ran to a dense forest, Wang Ba suddenly stopped.\"Why, can't you run?\" The first recruit laughed, learning from the bandit's appearance, \"I opened this mountain, I planted this tree, I want to cross from here, leave to buy road money!\"Wang Ba originally wanted to show off his prestige. He laughed at his words. He took out two big axes from his waist, turned and said, \"pheasants are boring. How can you go up to Tianwang mountain. Grab your grandfather my head, I see you are lard covered heart, do not faintNo one could understand his series of bandits' Chinese. The other side didn't want to be entangled with him here. He raised his sword and stabbed it to the flag on his waist.At this time, a sudden sound came from behind. In the grass on the left and right sides, two young men, one with a long gun and the other with an iron stick, were Jiang Jiao and Shi. There was another loud noise, and the bald man holding the golden back sword had already jumped in front of him.Just now, Wang BA was chased by five to one, but now the situation is turning rapidly, just like catching a turtle in a jar. There were ambushes in all directions, but there were only four men, but they made a grand scene of ambush on all sides.The several people were stunned for a moment, and their smile gradually disappeared and said, \"it's ambush! They cheatAlong the way, either the real sword or the real gun directly started to rob, or ambush in the dark directly rushed out a fierce battle. This is the first time that we have a bait to play in front of us like this. The first recruit gritted his teeth: \"what are you afraid of? There are quite a number of them. I'm afraid they won't succeed. I'll fight with them! \"Turning around, several people rushed into the scuffle together.To tell you the truth, although these men have their own strengths, they are not one in a million. After all, all the recruits who went up the mountain today are outstanding talents of liangzhouwei. It's strange that Jiang Jiao has the upper hand in a fight.One is that they have been up for a long time. They have been resting and eating here for a long time. However, the other recruits have just gone through the Trek and have no time to sit down and drink. They are naturally in a passive position. Secondly, it's the location they set up here. It's very well-known.Jiang Jiao and Shi Shi are on the left and right sides, so that these people are surrounded from the beginning to the end. Huang Xiong's big sword is powerful, but it is perfectly matched with Wang BA's axe. It has two long and two short parts. It has both offensive and defensive functions. This recruit can't find any mistakes in the other side. Instead, he is often defeated.Jiang Jiao opened the other party's sword with one shot and knocked down all the weapons of the other party. A new soldier said, \"no, we can't grab the flag. Let's withdraw quickly.\"\"How to withdraw?\" The first recruit was not angry: \"you give me a gap to try out!\"He tried to break through several times, but couldn't find a gap. However, they could not hold on to the consumption.\"No,\" a recruit turned to avoid Huang Xiong's sword and asked, \"Why are there only four of them, and one more?\"Yes, I've been fighting for a long time, but it's only five to four, and there's still one person missing. But because they've been suppressed so hard, they didn't notice. At this moment, after being reminded, they understood it immediately. The leader of the new recruits said, \"there is fraud! Protect the flagAs soon as his voice fell, he heard a roar: \"Heyan, you're going to watch the Opera! Not yetBut see that luxuriant camphor tree rings out a young brisk voice: \"come!\"A red figure suddenly appears in the dense forest. The young man talks and laughs like a swallow passing by. His posture is light, but he looks like an enemy in the eyes of the other party. Before a man on the edge has time to hide the bag, suddenly a long shadow comes towards his face door. He jumps down and subconsciously releases his hand. The long shadow is like a snake, winding and flexible. He takes it away with him Back to the nine knots whip, sitting on the tree, smiling will be a shaking hand, the burden of the skin fell, she held a flag in her hand, and said with a smile: \"thank you As soon as he turned his head, he disappeared in the jungle, leaving a voice: \"the thing has arrived, withdraw!\"The rest of Jiangjiao were still in the middle of a fierce battle just as they received orders. Now they are not interested in fighting at all. They put away their long guns and ran away. They were half dead from climbing mountains. After a fierce battle, they were exhausted. They could not catch up with them. However, they could not catch up with them after several hundred steps. They watched the group of people run away and no longer have a figure.\"What kind of bandit is this...\" Some people are tired and paralyzed on the ground, gnashing their teeth and cursing: \"it's really lawless!\"\"I can't help it. The thief doesn't leave the room.\" At the other end, Heyan is asking Jiang Jiao to take up the red flag in his hand and snap his finger and say, \"go.\"\"Where to?\" Wang Ba asked.\"Rob the next family.\"\u2026\u2026The pigeon paced back and forth in the window. Some people sprinkled some rice in their palms, and the pigeons fell on his palms and let the copper pipes be removed from their legs.After reading the note, Xiao Jue handed it to Shen Han, shaking his head and smiling.The words on the note were very simple. He only said one thing. He Yan set up ambushes around the mountain to engage in robbery and robbed the flags of several recruits.The most important thing in fighting for the flag is the word \"fight\". However, there is no one who can win such a covert and aboveboard way. From the very beginning, they only thought about the flag and didn't want to have a dispute with other recruits. They laid an ambush later and put the flag first. If there is no flag, grab it and let others walk by. If there are flags, take advantage of the fire and run.In the end, the loss is the least and the flag is the most.\"He's quite a bit of a teaser.\" After a long time, Shen Han held out this sentence.\"Not only do you know how to please, but also how to use troops.\" Xiao Jue road.\"Use the army?\"\"Serve the far with the near, work with ease, and hunger with contentment.\" He bent the corner of his mouth and said slowly: \"the recruits of Liangzhou Wei are all fooled by him.\"Shen Han is speechless. This young man really teaches people what to say. He suddenly thought of another thing: \"speaking of these five people, actually all of them are headed by him, and there is no objection.\"In fact, in addition to fighting with other recruits, there are also disputes in each team. If everyone's habits and tactics are different, they may not be harmonious. Some teams will even fight for the right of command, so that they can get nothing in the end. If you know how to cooperate and arrange, you can also see the ability of new recruits. From this point of view, he Yan has already had the ability to deploy troops.Among the five, except for stone, all the others had conflicts with Heyan, but now none of them has been involved with him.This is also the outstanding point of this young man.\"These men are all good,\" Shen Han thought. \"Jiang Jiao and other recruits are better than each other. So far, there has been no failure. In the governor's opinion, are these people qualified for the vanguard camp? \"Xiao Jue chuckled and said, \"it's not that they are strong, it's because he Yan sets up the array. A small team and a group of scattered soldiers are not the same as each other. \"\"The governor said Shen Han seems to have some understanding.\"The left and right open like crane wings. Don't you see that after the senior general presses into the array,\" Xiao Jue said, \"he used five people to set up the Crane Wing array.\"It was probably that the news was too creepy for Shen Han to say anything for a moment. If a new recruit can set up an array, it can almost show that this person has a problem. Shen Han hesitated for a moment: \"maybe Is it a coincidence? \"\"If it's a coincidence, we'll find out next.\" Xiao Jue said, \"flying slave.\"Black bodyguard quietly appeared behind him: \"childe.\"\"Send a message to other captains on Baiyue mountain,\" he said, picking up a cup of tea on the table and taking a sip. \"On the way down the mountain, set up a battle.\"\"Governor!\" Shen Han was anxious: \"this will make other recruits can't go down the mountain!\"\"Don't worry,\" the young man put down his tea cup and picked up the sunspots in the chess box. In a flash, he said, \"someone will break the battle.\"\u2026\u2026On Baiyue mountain, next to the stone cliff, several people are hiding in the grass, counting things.\"One, two, three Six! We've got six flags in all Jiang Jiao is a little happy.\"It's less than half of it,\" said Wang, pouring cold water on him. \"How happy I am.\"\"Six sides are already very good,\" said Huang Xiong. \"Besides, three sides are still stolen.\"Three of the six flags were found by Heyan, who had been ambushed near the top of the mountain.\"It's still not enough. Go for more.\" Wang Ba took the axe and said, \"if you win more than half of it.\"He Yan shakes his head: \"can't grab now.\"Stone frowned and asked, \"why?\"\"At present, the other recruits are going up the mountain one after another, and those who were robbed before will surely tell people about the flag snatched by us. I think we're notorious in these people's mouths right now. Those new recruits with flags will only pay more attention to us. Moreover, we have been robbing three places, and our physical strength is not as good as we have just now. \"\"Who said that?\" Wang Ba motioned to others to look at his powerful arm, \"I'm full of strength, not tired at all! How many more can I rob? \"He Yan said, \"Oh? What if they join hands? \"Wang BA was stunned.He Yan spread out his hand and said, \"we have six flags in our hands, which are equivalent to live targets. I think those recruits on the top of the mountain probably thought of joining hands to seize the flag in our hands. Two fists are hard to beat four hands, five of us, ten, twenty, thirty Or a hundred people, do you think it's necessary to fight? \"The crowd was speechless.\"What do you say?\" After a long time, Wang BaCai spoke impatiently.\"No matter how tricky things are in the world, there are the first and the second. We have just shown them how to take advantage of the fire. I think the next recruits will follow suit. We don't have to compare with the recruits one by one, just compare with the strongest of the remaining recruits. \"Jiang Jiao's eyes brightened: \"do you mean that when they fight with each other, we will gain profits?\"Let the rest of the recruits be on the mountain, and whoever the east wind prevails over the west wind or the west wind will defeat the east wind. One team will win. What they have to do is to rob the winning team and take away their flag. In this way, we should have half the flag.\"So...\" Huang Xiong looks at Heyan.\"Go down the mountain.\"\"Down the hill now?\" Jiang Jiao hesitated.\"It's still early to go down the mountain, and we can seize the opportunity. Hiding on the only way down the mountain, the recruits who have not snatched the flag will always pass by before our eyes. The team that inquires the most is our Yanggu. \"\"What you said is simple,\" Wang Ba couldn't help but argue, \"the other party is not Yanggu. Since he can get so many flags, he must also be a cruel character. We may not win. \"\"You're right.\" He Yan nodded, \"so the scene at the foot of the mountain will not be relaxed. But it doesn't matter. We can win. \"\"Why?\"\"Because of me.\"www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although he was confident, he was not arrogant, and he always seemed ready to do it. But he also has the ability to convince people, at least so far, he has done what he has said.The six banners were collected by Jiang Jiao. After walking for some hours, they were far away from the top of the mountain. When he was about to reach the mountainside, he Yan stopped and said, \"now take a rest here.\"They all sat down at the same place, but Heyan climbed up the tree again and looked around. \"What are you doing?\" Wang asked\"Step on the plate.\" He Yan replied.\"Robbery is so familiar, what kind of plate to step on.\" Wang Ba hums and laughs, \"you pretend on purpose.\"After observing around for a while, Heyan got down from the tree, sat down on the stone, and said, \"this should be the last stop. Since we are using a clever trick, we must hit it successfully. Otherwise, the six flags may not win the first place.\"\"Are they really going to pass through here?\" Jiang Jiao turned to take a look behind him. The forest was deep, and he couldn't see a person. \"There are so many mountain roads and so big mountains. What if they take other mountain roads?\"\"Baiyue mountain is also a road and a path to go,\" He Yan said with a smile. \"People with flags should always be cautious. If you take the main road, you will inevitably be conspicuous, for fear that other recruits will come to rob. It is because they will not take the main road, and in the small road, this is the nearest way to the Wei Suo and the best way to find it. You know, not everyone can cross the road without forgetting, so they are likely to take this road. \"Huang Xiong still liked to hear Heyan's speech, so he asked, \"is this the art of war you mentioned?\"\"This is called discussing potential,\" He Yan casually picked up a branch and drew a picture on the ground to show them: \"the purpose is not to choose the place to treat the enemy, but to control the complexity with simplicity, to keep constant strain, to respond to big change with small change, to respond to movement with immobility, and to respond to great movement with small movement.\"Wang Ba asked, \"then we don't move anything? Didn't you say that? Our tactics have been exposed for a long time. Others may be cheated. \"\"You think that since the other side has won a lot of flags, he will surely win many games in a row and his morale will soar. If he really wants to defeat us, he may not lose.\" Having said that, he Yan didn't have half an anxiety on his face, \"so let's go down the mountain to nourish our energy. By the way, find a good place to ambush, but I think in the end, the most powerful people on both sides will take the flag. \"\"But it's also natural that in the end, there's always a winner or loser between the best people.\"This word everybody can't receive, only Wang Ba slants at her one eye, cool way: \"how are you the best person?\"\"I call myself.\" He Yan answered sincerely.Wang Ba: \"it's just\"In a word, everyone will eat, drink and rest here first, and then we will ambush according to our arrangement. I have seen here that the road ahead is dangerous and narrow, easy to defend and difficult to attack, which is beneficial to us. If you can take advantage of the situation, when I grab the flag, don't be obsessed with war and leave as soon as I can. The following mountains are the boundary. If you leave Baiyue mountain, no one can take away the flag. \"\"Understand!\" \"I can't wait,\" Huang Xiong said\"Give me the flag.\" He Yan Dao.Jiang Jiao handed the flag to her, and he Yan put it on her body and said, \"I think the flag will be in the hands of the leader if the last recruit team appears. At that time, I will fight him fiercely. You just entangle other people and keep them away. \"\"You can do it alone?\" Wang Ba asked, \"there are six flags here. If you don't disperse them a little, they won't all be taken away.\"\"You are too small.\" He Yan lightly jumped, fell on the branch, and laughed: \"at least in liangzhouwei, no one can rob my things.\"\u2026\u2026Wang Xiaohan is walking down the mountain with one of their teams.His clothes were so worn that he couldn't cover his upper body, but his trousers were still in good condition. The knife in hand has been cut a notch, the face also received a blow, the eye rim is black. The companions behind him were no better than him. They were all black and blue and ragged. I don't know. I think they are refugees from outside the city.Wang Xiaohan felt desperate.The new recruits of Liangzhou garrison fought for the flag. At the beginning, they were all full of ambition and blood boiling. Who knows it's not like that until you get to the mountain.In order to find the flag hidden in the rugged mountain road, we should be careful of snakes, insects and wild animals in the mountains, as well as traps and traps put by hunters. If you want to compete with other recruits, you will be beaten to pieces if you encounter a mild method, or if you encounter a more ferocious means.Although the coach said that his life would not be hurt before he went up the mountain, the fight could not be intact. They did not really endanger their lives. However, Wang Xiaohan wronged to think that he was so big, it was the first time he was beaten so badly!And the flags have been robbed, just, robbed on, Wang Xiaohan also see that their team is not comparable to others. It's good to go down the mountain safely. Whoever likes to enter the vanguard camp will enter it. Go to his mother's forward camp and fight for the flag!He was thinking, stepping into the withered branches, something hit him on the forehead, but it didn't hurt. He looked up and saw a young man in red sitting on the oak tree in front of him, holding an acorn in his hand, aiming at his forehead. See Wang Xiaohan look over, that teenager then smile, say hello with him, \"Hey!\"The young man's face and eyes are clear and vivid, which should be a good picture. However, Wang Xiaohan feels like a basin of cold water pouring from head to foot, and his heart is cold. His voice trembled, and he could only utter a sad cry: -- It's Heyan, run quickly -- \"when his companions heard the words, they ran away. Wang Xiaohan also turned to run, but he just moved and felt something flying on his knee. Then, his legs became numb and he could not move any more. If you look at some of his companions, they are all like this.Heyan flew down from the tree, holding the acorn in his hand. He hit their hole with the acorn. This is also thanks to Wang Xiaohan and his party were injured, and the road down the mountain is steep. They are exhausted when they walk here. They are so easily controlled by Heyan.He Yan walks up to Wang Xiaohan. Wang Xiaohan does not wait for her to open her mouth. He yells: \"we don't have a flag, we don't have one side!\"Wang Ba several people also came out of the dark at the moment, searched them several people, shook his head to Heyan and said, \"No\"Since there is no flag, what do you see me running?\" He Yan asked curiously.\u201c\u2026\u2026 I'm afraid you'll hit me Wang Xiaohan's difficult way.\"Who told you we hit people?\" He Yan was even more strange, and looked at his eyes, \"brother, it seems that you have been hurt a lot. Has the flag fight on the mountain become so fierce?\"From the beginning to the end, they avoided the particularly fierce dispute, and did not know what the situation was. At the moment, seeing the miserable appearance of Wang Xiaohan and his party, they were all glad that they did not fight with the recruits.No one wants to be beaten black.\"We, we heard that you robbed a lot of flags,\" Wang Xiaohan stammered, \"and the means are insidious and vicious...\"Wang BA was not happy: \"who is his grandmother's nonsense? We want the brutality to be here? Who has discredited our reputation everywhere? \"Wang Xiaohan didn't dare to say that outsiders said too much. He described Heyan as a mob and a group of dogdang foxes.\"You've just come down from the mountain, haven't you?\" He Yan asked.Wang Xiaohan nods.\"Why go down the mountain without a flag?\"Wang Xiaohan broke the jar and said: \"I can't get it anyway. I'd better go back to take a bath and have a rest.\"\"Let me ask you,\" He Yan looked at him with a smile, \"besides us, who are the most flags in the hands of the mountain now?\"\"It is ... Raymond. \"\"Lei Hou?\" Huang Xiong frowned, \"have you heard the name?\"Jiang Jiao shook his head: \"NoStone and Wang Ba also said they had not heard of it. Liang Zhou Wei tens of thousands of new recruits, excellent people will be talked about in the end. Since Lei Hou has robbed many people's flags, he should be very excellent. However, no one has heard of his name before.\"He's very good?\" He Yan asked Wang Xiaohan.\"Very good. He has more than a dozen flags in his hand. I think he has everything except what you have in your hands. \" Wang Xiaohan said.More than ten faces, Heyan raised eyebrows. It seems that Lei Hou was not caused by luck. She asked, \"how did she grab the flag and set a trap?\"\"No, it's not,\" Wang Xiaohan replied, \"he just saw who had the flag, fought directly with the other party, defeated the other party, and took the flag away. His companions are similar to ours, but this man is so powerful that one can resist several others. \"He Yan was stunned. In this way, this man is not so fierce. She asked, \"is your injury a hit by him?\"Wang Xiaohan nods in humiliation.He Yan tut shook his head.Wang Xiaohan asked, \"what's the matter?\"\"He hit you. Why don't you know how to hit him?\"\"I can't beat it!\" Wang Xiaohan airway, \"if I had such skill as you, I would have fought with him!\"\"That's not true. If you can't do it, use your brain.\" He Yan patted him on the shoulder and untied the acupoints for them. \"You sent us so much news that we didn't expect to get back. Don't worry. I'll avenge him for beating you. Brothers, \"she turned to greet Jiang Jiao and said,\" don't be dazed, clean up and work. \"\"Do you really want to fight him?\" Wang Xiaohan carefully asked, about with Heyan to say a few words of Kung Fu, feel that he Yan is not as vicious as the legend. Wang Xiaohan felt relieved and said to him, \"since you have the flag in your hand, you'd better go down the mountain first. Lei Hou is really good at fighting. If you can't fight, there will be no flag. If you go down the mountain now, you can get a second. \"\"Second?\" He Yan shook his head, \"the second may not enter the vanguard camp. Don't worry, \"He Yan said,\" whatever monkey he is, when he comes to my territory, he can only be a good insect. \"She laughs wildly, for a time, Wang Xiaohan also has nothing to say.\u2026\u2026Wang Xiaohan several people in He Yan asked a few words, went down the mountain by themselves. He was afraid that he Yan and Lei hou would fight each other, and they ran very fast and disappeared.Jiang Jiao turned to look at Heyan: \"listen to what he said, that Lei Hou's skill is very strong.\"\"Don't worry,\" He Yan said, \"I'm more powerful.\"She was so confident that people didn't know what to say. Heyan estimated the time, it should not be long before they will go down the mountain, so he urged everyone to hide quickly, not to delay time.It took me a cup of tea. Someone's footsteps are approaching.There were five of them. The other four were at the back, and one was in the front. The leader of the five, about 20 years old, was a young man. He was tall and thin, with a good appearance and a bright sight. When he came to the forest, he suddenly stopped and stopped his companion's action behind him. He said, \"wait a minute!\"\"Brother Lei?\" Asked the companion.\"There is a faint murderous spirit in the forest ahead. I'm afraid there are ambushes here.\"\"Ambush?\" The companion feels very strange, \"how can anyone dare to ambush us?\"Their party, with the help of Lei Hou, grabbed all the flags in the hands of the recruits on the side of the mountain. Others, not to mention ambush, had to take a detour when they saw it. When they went down the mountain, they were very public and almost uncovered, because no one could beat Lei Hou.\"We have only fourteen flags in our hands.\" \"There is no thunder left.\"\"Isn't the rest in Heyan's hands?\"\"Not bad.\" Lei Hou looked at the dense forest in front of him, \"so the ambush here is mostly Heyan.\"Several people looked at each other. For a long time, someone asked, \"what should we do?\"No one in liangzhouwei didn't know about him. He was one in a million. Although Lei Hou was also very good, it was hard to say what the result would be if the two men got together.\"Good come,\" leihou said with a sudden smile. \"He was here, and he just took all his flags and didn't leave them to others.\"His words were full of confidence and blood boiling. His companions said hello one after another, and Lei Hou said again, \"you go to deal with other people. He Yan will give it to me.\"He didn't know. Coincidentally, he Yan thought so.Lei Hou himself walked forward a few steps. The road was narrow, with dense forests on both sides. Instead of going forward, he said loudly to the front: \"come out, Heyan, I know you are here.\"The young man's light smile suddenly rings from the tree. Lei Hou looks up. The young man half leans against the branch and holds his head with one hand. She looks sorry and says, \"brother, your eyes are so good that you can't hide them.\"\"You hide well.\" Lei Hou also laughed, \"it's just that your companions are so murderous.\"He Yan reluctantly thought, what can we do? A mountain bandit, a green man, a young master of a martial arts school, and a hunter who was born and raised in shuojing are all coming from the bloodbath. Can they be as calm as the monks in the temple?\"Tell your men to come out,\" leihou said. \"Let's fight for the flagHe bit the word \"open and upright\" very seriously.It was probably at the top of the mountain that he Yan had heard about their \"great achievements\" and loved fishing in troubled waters, so we should emphasize that no tricks should be used.\"They like to play hide and seek,\" He Yan only said with a smile, \"let your people find it by themselves.\"Lei Hou's smile turned cold. He looked at Heyan for a moment. Suddenly, a cold light forced him to leave. He Yan sidestepped away and passed the cold light. However, he saw the cold light flying back to Lei Hou's hand, which was actually a long sword.This man used to use a sword.\"Brother, I'm so anxious,\" He Yan smiles. He pulls out the nine knots whip from his waist. The whip collides in the air and makes a crisp sound. \"So, I'll fight with you!\"She rushed to leihou.Lei Hou came up, and his companions also wanted to help, but as soon as he started, he saw several people coming out of the fox hole from all directions, in the grass, behind the stone, beside the tree trunk, and probably he Yan's companions. They appear to be caught off guard, grasp the first opportunity, Lei Hou people caught off guard, had to eat such a dull loss.They were all beaten up a few times.They have been invincible all the way up to now. When they were beaten, they were shocked more than angry.Wang Ba waved his axe and rushed into the crowd: \"your grandfather, I've thought of doing a big job. Come on, have a good fight!\"He Yan said with a smile: \"take it easy, brother Wang. If the end is too fast, there will be no fight.\"\"Are you still in the mood to laugh?\" Lei Hou felt strange. He was probably angry that he Yan didn't pay attention to this kind of fight. He didn't feel soft at all, and his sword was stabbed at Heyan's chest.He Yan slightly frowns, looking at Lei Hou's expression is also gradually cold.The purpose of the recruits fighting for the flag is to fight for the flag, not to fight. It's because the instructor will remind you not to hurt your life. But as soon as she had a fight with Lei Hou, she knew that he had no scruples.No wonder Wang Xiaohan was beaten so badly, so early frustrated. Wang Xiaohan is not the most miserable one who wants to fight with Lei Hou on the mountain. For example, if I had just changed a person, I was afraid I would have been stabbed.He's not really soft at all.Seeing the change of Heyan's expression, a trace of contempt flashed in Lei Hou's eyes. He said, \"if you admit defeat now, I won't fight.\"\"How?\" \"I still want the flag left in your arms,\" he said with a smileLei Hou's face changed. All the flags were in his arms. For one thing, he had snatched all these flags, and his companions did not object to them. Secondly, if you put it here, no one else would dare to rob him.I didn't expect to be seen through by He Yan.With a sneer, his eyes were quick and his hand was quick. He pointed his sword to Heyan, so he wanted to open his front and seize his flag. He Yan raised his hand, the tail of nine knots whip \"pa\" to shake off the tip of Lei Hou's sword. He Yan's toes light, back a few steps.She looked down at her clothes. Fortunately, she was not provoked. A trace of displeasure passed in my heart. If I put it in shuojing, Lei Hou's move would be enough for the girl to send him to the government office. It's a rogue to insult a good woman in the street.\"Brother Lei is so rude.\" She raised her eyebrows and said, \"I'm a little angry.\"www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 83": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth of a Star GeneralCH 83Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"I'm a little angry.\"As soon as this sentence came out, Wang Ba several people all agreed to look at Heyan.Stone and he Yan stay the longest time, knowing that he Yan has always been a good tempered person. Even though Wang Ba had robbed her meat bun before, she was just protecting her own food, but she didn't seriously say that she was angry.At present, this monkey, who doesn't know where he came from, has made Heyan angry.Lei Hou said with a smile, \"brother he, the sword has no eyes. Don't be angry.\"\"You have to hurt me.\" He Yan smiles and turns back. He is already behind Lei Hou. The nine Section Whip is like a long snake. He swims it lightly. Lei Hou dodges. However, the whip looks like a long eye. Instead of being thrown away by him, he brushes his cheek. In a moment, there is a red mark on Lei Hou's face.Because of the whip tail, there was no bleeding, even so, Lei Hou's face was very ugly.\"Brother Lei, the sword has no eyes,\" He Yan flushed his hook finger, \"don't be angry.\"Lei Hou didn't say a word and rushed to him with a long sword. He is very skillful and murderous. He is totally different from the new recruits in the martial arts training competition. The point of the sword is either Heyan's throat or his heart. It's very poisonous.In contrast, the movements of teenagers are much more gentle. He was born thin and delicate, but he did not see fatigue in the move, as if he had infinite energy. And sweep and entangle, make the tip of Lei Hou's sword unable to move forward an inch.He Yan doesn't want to hurt Lei Hou's life, but Lei Hou doesn't think so. She thought a few times in her heart. It seemed that unless Lei Hou was completely knocked down, all Lei hou would not give up chasing her and snatch the flag.However, the fight with Lei Hou also gave Heyan a strange feeling. The strange feeling was not clear and the way was unclear. In the end, she felt as if something had been ignored and felt uncomfortable all over her body.Just thinking about it, a sword light came from the oblique stab. He Yan was surprised and pulled back. His sleeve was cut in an instant, and the wind leaked in.Lei Hou stares at her and says with bright eyes: \"at this time, it seems that we should not be distracted.\"\"I'm just thinking, how can I make you quiet down,\" Heyan said, \"brother Lei, no one told you, are you a little bit upset?\"Such blatant and provocative words, coupled with her smiling expression, can really make ordinary people angry. Lei Hou's face sank, and he raised his sword to stab him. He Yan smiles, and the whip is thrown out. The whip flower is wrapped around his body, like a long snake flying around, but the tip of the sword is not allowed to enter an inch.She was still smiling, laughing and saying, \"in fact, you don't know. I use my whip very well.\"In an instant, whip flowers crisscross, sweeping forward rolling, from fast to slow, dazzling.The voice of the young man was full of laughter. It seemed that it was not a fierce fight for the flag, but a spontaneous contest among her companions in the martial arts arena.\"This is called inside out elbow.\"\"It's called cheating on the horse.\"\"Well, the White Snake talks.\"\"Sweeper!\"She moves faster and faster, faster and faster. Wang Ba and they have already stopped their movements. Looking at her, they seem to be shocked by her momentum.At the beginning, I thought she was very powerful in the martial arts arena, but now it seems that she had taken it before.Rayson gritted his teeth and looked more and more ugly.He did not put Heyan in his eyes. No matter how powerful a new recruit is, he will not have everything. He Yan's excellent sword, bow and gun skills does not mean that he can defeat himself. However, at present, the young man used the whip move at his fingertips, as if he had already used it for thousands of times. Well, if one weapon is used well, it can't be said that he can win the battle.He Yan, however, is too cunning. She only exchanged hands with herself several times, which seems to be able to observe his weak points and attack them specially. In such a short time, however, he could not find out the weakness of Heyan and was unable to start. Lei Hou was shocked.Young people's smile is more and more expanded, a whip set of a whip, a whip even a whip. Lei Hou felt that the whip in front of him was like a wheel whistling and turning, and it was like a hard and fierce steel stick, like a worm like a dragon. He could not help but feel a little dazzled.Just in the middle of his eyes, he saw that the whip was coming to his face again. Lei Hou subconsciously took his sword to block it. The next moment, the whip made a mischievous curve and went straight to his chest.Lei Hou's heart was not good, but it was too late. The whip, like a long eye, was directly involved in his arms with more than a dozen flags and took them back.Lei Hou wanted to use his sword to stop the whip, but the whip could be retracted or put away. Where would he be entangled with his sword and not slip into autumn and fall into Heyan's hands.\"This one is called golden silk wrapped gourd.\" He Yan took the flag in his hand and said with a smile, \"thank you very much, brother Lei. I've tied it up for me.\"Lei Hou was conceited and felt that none of the new soldiers fighting for the flag on Baiyue mountain could beat him. Therefore, even the flag is extremely arrogant, directly tied with a rope, put together into the arms. But now he Yan has taken all of them away. I can't help but feel a little regret in my heart. If I were more safe and open, I would not have nothing at once.At present, all of them were taken away by Heyan. Lei Hou could not hold his gloomy face any longer. Without saying a word, he rushed to Heyan.He Yan stepped back a few steps and said with a smile, \"when it comes to my hands, it's my things. No one can rob them.\"\"What if I want to rob?\" Lei Hou is so murderous that his sword is like a meteor.\"In fact, I don't like to fight,\" He Yan sighed, \"you want to rob, then I have to beat you.\"The two figures collided in a flash.Wang Ba and his companions were tired of fighting. Besides, the flag is not in hand, so it's not interesting to fight. All of them have been sitting under the trees, watching on the wall. It is also clear in my mind that this is a contest between Heyan and leihou. Whoever wins will take the flag.\"Can you tell which of them is better?\" Asked Lei Hou's companion.Jiang Jiao shook his head: \"can't see.\"\"I have to ask. It must be Heyan!\" Wang BA's answer was taken for granted.\"Oh? What's the point, brother? \"\"I don't know. Feel it.\"\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Do you want pine nuts? \" Huang Xiong also handed a pine nut to each other.\"Thank you very much. Oh, it's delicious.\"A small handful of pine nuts have not finished, listen to the \"Dong\" sound.They looked forward together, and the two figures were separated. Lei Hou's face did not move, and the boy held the whip with a smile.There is a sword lying on the ground.\"You lost.\" He Yan Dao.Lei Hou's face was ugly and he didn't speak. After a moment, he said calmly, \"you cheat.\"\"There is no fraud in war.\" He Yan picked up the long sword on the ground and returned it to him. He said seriously, \"your leg has been injured by me. Take a rest here for half an hour and move again. Otherwise, your leg will leave a legacy and you will never be able to make any progress in future practice.\"Lei Hou put his face away and took the sword. He didn't want to see her.\"It's OK,\" He Yan patted him on the shoulder and said with great heart: \"the family affairs of the victorious and defeated soldiers are unexpected. Bao is a man. It's just a flag fight. You've been very good. It's a pity that you met meShe pointed to herself: \"I'm the best.\"Wang Ba and he Yan have said this countless times, but at the beginning they were disdained. Now, they have been numb. Besides, she was right.He Yan said to Jiang Jiao, \"let's go.\" Then he said to his companions, \"take a rest here and protect brother Lei.\"The man looked at her puzzled.\"You beat so many recruits on the mountain. After a while, the recruits go down the mountain and see that brother Lei is not good at moving at the moment, so they will not fight back together.\"\"So I said,\" she said in her right words, \"don't do evil because it's small.\"\u2026\u2026Lei Hou and his party were left behind. Jiangjiao and he Yan went down the mountain together.\"He just said you cheat,\" Huang Xiong couldn't help asking, \"how do you cheat?\"\"In fact, it's not to cheat, but to sell his flaws on purpose.\" He Yan shrugged, \"he wants my life, but I just want him to be unable to go and catch up with me. He misunderstood me, so... \"\"That monkey is not very powerful either,\" Wang Ba did not agree. \"He said so much. He was defeated so quickly. He was so weak.\"\"You are wrong,\" He Yan shook his head and laughed. \"He is really powerful. Of the recruits of liangzhouwei, he would be the first without me. \"He Yan had a fight with this man. She didn't know what he used to do. He was only in his twenties, but he wanted to practice martial arts for at least ten years. Besides, he has profound skills and skillful techniques. If there is anything wrong with it, it's too murderous. Although he didn't hurt his life, he probably hurt his partner with his playing method.It was because he was so good at it that his way to win the flag was so simple and crude. It's just about winning the flag. It's never a challenge arena. Whoever can fight to the end is the winner. Although Lei Hou was very powerful, he had been fighting with other recruits on the top of the mountain. He kept on going up and down the mountain, which eventually consumed him a lot of physical strength.However, he Yan went up and down the mountain today. All of them were working together. Wang Ba and they were also conscientious in their efforts. Besides arranging the arrangement, he Yan did not really fight with each other several times. It was her own energy and strength to see the weakness of Lei Hou.\"Is he really not coming?\" Jiang Jiao still has some doubts, and looks back frequently, \"I think we should go faster, so as not to wait for him to follow up.\"\"Don't worry,\" He Yan said, \"unless he doesn't want to continue practicing martial arts in the future, he won't follow him. But you also have a point. We'd better get down early. \"\u2026\u2026In the room of Wei Suo, a game of chess is not finished.Shen Han had something in his mind, so he didn't have much interest in playing chess. However, the young people in the opposite side seemed not worried at all and did not care about the result of the flag fight. They drank tea and played chess in a leisurely way, which was quite appalling.The bodyguard in black came in from the door and went to Xiao Jue's side. He said in a low voice: \"Heyan bumped into Lei Hou and fought with Lei Hou. Lei Hou was defeated. Now all the 20 flags belong to Heyan.\"He didn't avoid Shen Han, so Shen Han heard this and took a cold breath.Narihou, who started fighting for the first flag on the mountain, was noticed by them. This young man did not show the mountains and dew before. If it wasn't for the flag fight, I didn't know that there was one in Liangzhou Wei who could fight. He was also recommended by relatives of the family of Pope Du Maodu. At first, he did not look very special, but now he knew that he had real skills.The man went up the mountain and began to fight for the flag, but he did not lose. And he Yan that kind of hiding in the dark ambush temperament is different, only know straight forward, do not know how to hide. He beat the flag 14 times, but he is better than countless people.At first, Shen Han was looking forward to the meeting between Lei Hou and Heyan. I really want to see who will win if they really fight. Shen Han thought that he Yan was used to flattering. He was afraid that he could not defeat Lei Hou. After all, Lei Hou is really good at it.I never thought that Lei Hou was defeated by Heyan.\"He Yan and his party have already gone down the mountain,\" continued feinu. \"Another half an hour, you can enter the array.\"Shen Han looks at Xiao Jue.At first, he thought that for a new recruit, it was not necessary to use the array. Now Shen Han had only one thought in his mind. He could do anything. He was afraid that the formation would not trap him.Xiao Jue looks calm, droops his eyes and picks up Shen Han's white son.Shen Han asked in a low voice, \"governor Will he win? \"Xiao Jue hook hook lip horn: \"perhaps.\"\u2026\u2026The sun is beginning to sink in the West.Sunlight from the bright gold in the day, into a warm red, through the cracks in the branches and leaves, like a large piece of red, soft and bright, like a girl's red yarn.From the depths of the jungle came the cry of wild birds. It was about 20 flags already in hand and the victory was in hand. The whole party was in a good mood. It seems that I'm not here to fight for the flag, but I'm going out for an outing.Wang Badao: \"I don't know if I will go back this time, in addition to the possibility of entering the vanguard camp, what will be rewarded?\"\"There should be.\" He Yan asked casually, \"what do you want?\"\"Wine! Good wine, of course! I don't drink much when I come here. I'm so greedy. \" Wang Ba complained, \"if I could have a drink, I would be stronger than I am now.\"\"It's wine, not medicated food.\" He Yan is a little funny.\"You can send some good weapons.\" Jiang Jiao said: \"when I joined the army, I did not bring my family's weapons. It's not easy to use the spear in the martial arts arena. It would be nice if I could reward you with a good spear. \"Huang Xiong touched the Buddha beads on his neck and said, \"I just want to eat some hot beef. Drinking in a big bowl and eating large pieces of meat are just living! \"After pondering for a long time, the Stone said, \"take wheat up the mountain. He has always wanted to hunt rabbits.\"Of the four people, three people's wishes are related to eating and drinking. Heyan doesn't know whether to praise them. They have no desire and no desire. Jiang Jiao asked, \"what about you? What kind of reward do you want? \"\"Me? Nothing to think about. \" He Yan said: \"I will be very happy if I can enter the vanguard camp.\"\"You really want to do something.\" Wang BA's sour road.\"That's natural. It's a pity that I'm so good at it? I also hope to be appreciated by the governor and be a guard in front of him Heyan thought, if so, every day and Xiao Jue opposite, can always find the news of he family.\"You think,\" Wang Ba rolled his eyes. \"If you become, I'll call you dad.\"He Yan said:Just then, Huang Xiong stopped and said, \"have we been here all the time? How do I feel like we've been here?\"\"Pull it down,\" Wang Ba opened his mouth. \"Do you know the way?\"\"I feel like we've just been here.\" Jiang Jiao also said.He Yan didn't speak. The stone took a straw rope from his arms, went to a tree in front of him, stretched out his hand and tied it up. He said, \"the mountain road is complex, the trees look similar, and it's common to see if you're wrong. Go and have a look.\"Then they went down again. After a cup of tea, they saw a tree in front of them. On the tree was a straw rope tied by a stone just now.This time, everyone was quiet.For a moment, Wang Baqiao opened his mouth, and his voice was trembling imperceptibly. He said, \"did we encounter a ghost hitting the wall?\"He also said more and more forcefully, and said in a garrulous way: \"I heard a teacher at the top of the mountain once said that he used to walk on the mountain road at night, and when he got to a place, he would go around in the same place. He had no choice but to sit down and sleep with his clothes. By the next morning, Ho, guess whatHe deliberately sold a pass, but no one took his words, Wang Ba said bitterly: \"he woke up and found himself in a cemetery!\"He Yan helped his forehead: \"brother Wang, it seems that this is not the time to tell ghost stories.\"\"What are you afraid of?\" Huang Xiong said in an impassioned voice: \"I have Buddha beads, and ghosts and monsters can't get close to me. It's you, \"he turned to look at Heyan.\" did you remember the way wrong\"No He Yan Dao.\"How could you get lost all of a sudden?\" Jiang Jiao was puzzled. Although Baiyue mountain is big, it can't get lost. When you come up, you can't get out when you go down.\"We are really going down the mountain, yes,\" He Yan said, \"but we do go around here.\" An idea passed through her mind, and she went to the tree with straw ropes and looked around.This is a wild place. The trees are not as dense as the top of the mountain. The ground is overgrown with weeds. There are several scattered stones falling everywhere.Stone?He Yan's heart moved, and then a few steps forward, see a pile of stones. She bent down to look at it carefully. Several huge stones were piled together in a disorderly way. They had no shape. They looked like they were picked up by hunters on the mountain when they were resting.\"What are you staring at this pile of stones?\" \"Is there a word on it?\" Wang askedHe Yan straightened up and said, \"there are no words on it, but this is why we can't go out.\"\"What?\" Jiang Jiao several people also around, are looking at the stone, how can not see the pattern. The stone frowned and asked, \"what does this mean?\"\"Qimen dunjia: life, injury, rest, Du, Jing, death, shock and opening eight doors. Some people set up the array here, \"He Yan said,\" we entered the array, so we went around in the same place. \"Her words were intelligible to everyone, and even to them they were incomprehensible. The crowd looked at her and didn't even know where to start.He Yan is also very strange, there is no shadow of Wang Xiaohan everywhere, indicating that Wang Xiaohan and they have gone down the mountain. They can't break the battle, which means that they haven't, so how come they have it now?Who's here for her? Shen Han? Or Xiao Jue?www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The military array was originally changed according to Qimen dunjia.\" He Yan said: \"it's just a long story, but now this array...\"\"What?\" Asked the stone.\"It's not a military formation, it's just an ordinary eight trigrams array.\" He Yan replied.She really didn't understand why there were so many arrays here. When they went up the mountain, there was no such thing. Wang Xiaohan and Wang Xiaohan did not meet. It seems that they were prepared for them alone or for her. But why?\"Then you Can you walk out? \" Jiang Jiao stares at her face and asks.\"Of course.\"This time, Huang Xiong was also surprised, \"you can even this?\"He Yan tiny smile: \"slightly understand just.\"She has a \"slight understanding\", which is generally \"very understanding\". There was nothing to say. Heyan knew that there must be supervisors hiding in the dark to observe their situation everywhere on the mountain. At the moment, her words and deeds must be watched by the eyes in the dark. Never say you can't.Maybe Xiao Jue set up the array for herself to test her level? After all, I've never seen a \"flag fight\" until the end of the battle. It seems that it is not a simple thing to enter the nine flag camp. If everyone in the nine flag camp will break the battle, it is really not simple. Xiao Jue has such an iron horse, no wonder he is invincible.She thought so, and said, \"you follow me, as I go, you can go. Don't take a wrong step.\"He Yan was rarely so serious. Jiang Jiao and he Yan did not dare to be careless. They followed his steps and walked slowly down the mountain.While walking, Huang Xiong said, \"brother he, who did you learn this hand from?\"He Yan said with a smile: \"learn from an expert.\"\"I think so,\" Huang Xiong nodded. \"Your master must be a peerless master. How can you do anything?\"He Yan bowed his head and laughed and did not answer. In fact, it is not uncommon for general Feihong to be brave and good at fighting on the battlefield. Although she is not afraid of the world's first heroes, she is not lack of strength. What general Feihong is good at is arranging troops.Her master is indeed a peerless master, but as a woman, she is not as good as a man in terms of physical strength and physique. People should know how to develop their strengths and avoid their weaknesses. If they learn how to arrange and deploy their troops, they will be more capable of fighting on the battlefield alone. Her master was very good at Qimen dunjia. She learned to combine it with the art of war and finally became a famous general, Feihong.Generals should learn how to train and arrange their troops, but why should the people of the nine flag battalion learn this? He Yan couldn't figure out what to do, so he had to give up and go down the mountain. In fact, she can also directly break the array here and destroy the array. However, he Yan is not sure whether the array is prepared for her. In case it is prepared for others, she destroys it so passionately. What will the later people do?So she took Jiang Jiao and they went out after the students.This array was easy for her to master, and it was a great event in the eyes of the supervisor who was watching in the dark.Ma Damei and Liang Ping are hiding in the dark at the moment. When they see Heyan and his party go away, they open their mouths and look at each other. They can see the surprise in each other's eyes.\"He He just left? \" Liang Ping stammered.\"See as if there is nothing...\" Madame road.He Yan didn't even stop to think about how to break the battle. How do you know? Just look out. There was such a character in their recruits. Up to now, there seems to be nothing to stop him.This should have been a good thing, hero boy, outstanding. If there is such a hero in his account, he has to feel that he has accumulated a lot of luck in his life. However, today's situation is complex. Last time I looked at Mr. Shen's meaning, I didn't know whether it was a blessing or a disaster.The jungle is dense, half the sun has already sunk on the mountain top, and he Yan and his party also stepped out of the array. She stopped and looked back. The array made of stones and dead branches was blurred and could not see clearly.\"Are we coming out?\" Wang Ba asked.\"Not bad.\"Wang BA was happy: \"his grandmother, is there anything to stop us this time? I reckon I'll be down the hill in half an hourJiang Jiao was also a little happy, \"it's almost over.\" He looked at Heyan and asked, \"what's wrong?\"\"No He Yan shakes his head, but she still feels that this array is baffling. Before Lei Hou fought with her, there were some differences. The discomfort was like a tiny stone falling into her boots and burning people's panic, which made it difficult for her to feel happy. She only felt that she had neglected something and felt uneasy.\"It's getting dark. Let's go down the mountain earlier.\" Wong Hung Road.He Yan recollected his thoughts and said, \"let's go.\"\u2026\u2026The sun has not passed the Baiyue mountain, and fell into the Wulu river. Half of the body sank into the river. The water surface is soaked by the setting sun like blood, shining with sparkling light, as if a woman's make-up box was opened and pearls were sprinkled on the whole side.A pot of tea in the room is cold.It is evening, the wind thin curtain green, autumn color far and near. Two people playing chess, one look hard to hide anxiety, the other calm without wave.Someone came in from the door and said, \"the first team is down the mountain.\"Shen Han looks at feinu and waits for feinu to say his name.\"It's Heyan.\"Three words, Shen Han body slightly back, the whole person relaxed.This result is unexpected and reasonable. He had guessed it was the result in the early days, but he had some doubts. Now he finally confirmed it. For a while, he was a little confused.Sunspot settled down, the youth in front of him raised his head and said, \"you lost.\"Shen Han: The governor's chess skills are superb. I'm ashamed of myself. \" He hasn't won once in half a day.I don't know how Xiao Jue is in the mood to play chess like this.\"Governor, they are going down the mountain. Do you want to reward them now...\"\"No need,\" Xiao Jue hooked his lips. \"Du Mao looks at it. Five days later, it's the Mid Autumn Festival. It's a night trip.\"\"What happened to the vanguard camp? Did he Yan enter Shen Han asked hesitantly. He Yan has already won the first place, so he should enter the vanguard camp naturally. But his identity is questionable. At present, his friends and enemies are not clear. Is it not good to agree so rashly?\"No,\" the young man stood up and looked out of the window at the osmanthus trees. The osmanthus trees were blooming and fragrant. They were with him, and the gentleman was like jade. He said, \"let Lei Hou enter Qianfeng camp.\"\u2026\u2026After the battle, it took only half an hour to get down from the mountain to the station.There were several torches outside the martial arts arena. Everything was as calm as ever. There was no coach at the door. There was no picture of warm celebration as I thought. Several people looked at each other.\"I thought there was a celebration party,\" Wang BA was a little discontented. \"Why is there nothing?\"Just then, someone in the martial arts arena saw them and came to this end. When they got to the front, they could see clearly that this man was Du Mao.Du Mao was not as excited as he was when he saw them off in the morning. He looked calm and asked, \"where are the flags?\"He Yan took out that big banner from her arms. Her arms were bulging with this thing, and suddenly handed it to others. It was much easier.Du Mao counted, \"twenty sides?\"\"Not bad.\" Jiang Jiao is still a little excited, can't help but say: \"we should be the first?\"\"It's number one.\" Du Mao nodded and put the flag away. He said to several people, \"go back to take a bath and rest. Tomorrow morning, you can have an extra hour to come to the martial arts arena. It's hard today.\"Still, he did not mean to reward him for his merits. Wang asked, \"is that it?\"Du Mao looked at him: \"what else?\"Wang Ba couldn't answer this, and he felt aggrieved. Du Mao said: \"I'll go back to tell the head coach first. Don't stay here. I'll sweat all over. Wash and eat something.\" Having said that, he also ignored several of them and turned away.It's heartless.Looking at Du Mao's back, several people only feel that the night wind is a bit cold. Seeing that Du Mao had gone far away, Wang Ba dared to point to his back and asked, \"no, what does he mean? Leave us alone? I have to give an account! We've been working hard for a whole day, but we've been busy for nothingHuang Xiong and Jiang Jiao are also somewhat disappointed, but Shi Shi talks. He says, \"Xu is not talking about merit today. After all, there are still recruits who haven't gone down the mountain.\"\"Not bad.\" He Yan also thought, \"I don't know when the last recruit went down the mountain. Besides, the head coach has to discuss the lottery for a while. It's not immediately possible to think of it.\"Wang Ba took a look at her and said sour: \"of course you don't care. You'll be sure to enter the Qianfeng camp. Naturally, you can say so.\"\"When I enter the vanguard camp, I'll get you two jars of good wine.\" He Yan patted him on the shoulder.Wang Ba shook her hand away and hummed twice: \"whatever you say, Grandpa, I'm going back!\"They didn't live in a house, so they parted ways in the arena. When he Yan and stone came back to the house, the quiet room suddenly became lively.The wheat was the first to rush up to the stone: \"brother! How are you doing? How many flags have you got? What's the row? \"A rare stone smile, said: \"all.\"The room was stunned for a moment and suddenly cheered. He Yan was almost lifted up and thrown into the sky, and heard Hongshan's exaggerated cry: \"all? You're working too hard! Ah he, you can. This is the first time again. I don't think you will live in this house any longer. It's said that the soldiers in the forward camp eat and sleep better than us. Ah, I'm so jealous\"Stone, brother Ho, tell us quickly, how did you win the flag?\"\"Yes, there are so many recruits on the mountain. Have you ever had a fight? Have you had a good fight\"With 20 flags, can we not fight? I don't think you're very lucky. Are other people so hard to fight? \"He Yan only said, \"brothers, let's eat something and drink some water, and tell you slowly, don't worry.\"This said, actually also talked about the night.Outside, I heard the recruits coming down the mountain one after another. He Yan's heart was just relieved. When there was no one at night, he ran to the riverside where there was no one to bathe.The long summer was over, and the river began to cool gradually. He Yan couldn't help fighting a cold war when he didn't go in. She had some worries in her heart, such as this summer and autumn. In winter, she was not good to go to the clean room to have a shower with the recruits. She didn't know what the river would look like when it was cold. Cool is next, but when we get there, what excuse should we use to explain that we have to take a cold bath in the river instead of hot water?Others will think her brain is sick!Therefore, we have to enter the nine flag camp as soon as possible. Xiao Jue is not short of money, and he is a young master. I think he will not treat his confidant badly. He is more convenient than now.Body gradually adapted to the cool, he Yan to the body of some water, take wheat to her pancrease wipe.All the recruits have gone down the mountain, and they have never heard of anyone falling down. This shows that the formation on the way down the mountain should have been removed after Heyan and they left. The array is really prepared for himself. He Yan thinks that Xiao Jue really wants her to enter the nine flag camp and deliberately tests her qualifications. In this way, after she passed, she thought that Xiao Jue should be satisfied with her and was sure to enter the nine flag camp. In the future, more performance is needed, so that the more satisfied Xiao Jue is with her, the more he can become his confidant. It is better to have left and right hands, which is inseparable.Even today's Lei Hou fought with him, he Yan always felt something was wrong. She couldn't figure out what was wrong, and it was the same at the moment. He can only shake his head and think that he can find out what reason to discuss with this person in a few days. Maybe we can find out the crux of the problem.But he was merciless and had to be on guard.He Yan flushed the foam and wiped his body with a cloth before he put on his clothes and went back to the house. Since the last time he ran into Xiao Jue at the Wulu River, he Yan had to go far and far every time he took a bath to avoid hitting him again. After thinking about it, she, a new recruit, has been very cautious.\u2026\u2026The next day, all the recruits who had gone up the mountain the day before rested in the tent for an hour. Cheng Lishu has come to find Heyan.Young Master Cheng brought two round pomegranates to Heyan and sat cross legged on her cave in and said, \"I didn't know you were fighting for the flag until yesterday evening. My uncle locked me in the house for a day, and I copied a letter for a day. If I had known, I would have come to see you. \"He approached Heyan and said, \"I heard that elder brother, you have got 20 flags. This is the first recruit in Liangzhou.\"Heyan smilingly opens the pomegranate brought by Cheng Lishu. The pomegranate is big and round, and the inside is ripe. When he opens it, the pomegranate grains are like red crystal, which makes people's tongue produce fluid. He Yan picked up a few grains to eat, while answering: \"it's just luck, fluke.\"\"Brother, you are good at everything, but you are too modest!\" Cheng Lishu said, \"how can you call it luck? You are good at it\"Then I'm so powerful,\" he Yanyou thought of getting a word out of his mouth. He looked at him with a smile and asked, \"do you think you can enter the nine flag camp?\"\"That's...\" Of course, the two words were swallowed by Cheng Lishu.Originally, this is a matter of course. It can't be more normal. But Cheng Lishu still remembers that Xiao Jue's attitude towards Heyan was not like appreciating him when he said something from his mouth not long ago.\"I think, elder brother, you have proved one thing to everyone. You are the first in Liangzhou Wei. There is no doubt about it.\" Cheng Lishu carefully considered the sentence, \"but ordinary people will choose you into the nine flag camp.\"His words have implied very clearly, \"but ordinary people\", but Xiao Jue is not an ordinary person, so no one can say what the result is.He Yan didn't notice the trap in Cheng Li Su's words. He was too confident about himself. After all, she has collected all the flags this time, which is enough to show how powerful she is. Moreover, in the whole struggle for the flag, he Yan thought about it carefully and felt that he had performed very well. He was able to employ people and ambush him. He was skillful and did not lose in the battle with Lei Hou. Even Xiao Jue's last additional array was lightly broken. Heyan felt that even in Xiao Jue's nine flag camp, he himself was one of the best.How can Xiao Jue let go of such a talented person.She was so beautiful that she didn't see it. The more happy she was, the more guilty Cheng Lishu was.\"But do you know when it was when the merit was rewarded?\" He Yan asked, \"if there is no yesterday or today, it should be in recent days. You must know that you are inseparable from your uncle. \"Cheng Lishu was relieved. He could answer this question and said, \"it's Mid Autumn Festival. On the night of August 15, rewards are rewarded in the military camp.\"He Yan slightly stunned: \"Mid Autumn Festival?\"\"Yes,\" Cheng Lisu sighed. \"Time flies. I feel like I haven't been to Liangzhou for a long time. It's Mid Autumn Festival.\"He Yan looked at him, the face of the young boy who had always been in high spirits showed a little sadness. He Yan asked, \"do you want to go home?\"The worried color quickly faded, which made people wonder whether it had appeared just now. Cheng Lisu shook his sleeve and said angrily: \"how can it be? Is the scenery of Liangzhou bad, or uncle looks ugly? Why am I homesick? I'm so happy here! I don't want to go back to get marriedHe Yan said:At this age, children always yearn for freedom.Cheng Lishu turned to her and asked, \"what about you, brother? You want to go back? \"The young man drooped his eyes, and the shadow passing sideways made it difficult for people to see his expression clearly. Her voice was also smiling, with a trace of invisible perplexity, and said: \"fortunately, I don't miss home very much.\"\u2026\u2026In the next few days, everything was as usual. The talk about the flag fight was just lively in private among the recruits, and people were talking about what kind of awards would be given to the top prize this time. The coaches were very calm and tight lipped, and they didn't reveal anything. More and more exciting people scratch the heart and liver.The autumn moon is more and more perfect day by day. In a twinkling of an eye, the Mid Autumn Festival is coming.www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 85": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth of a Star GeneralCH 85Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAutumn geese fly across the sky, osmanthus fragrance, the summer heat of the burning meaning finally faded, leaving the late autumn frost and dew slightly cool.Early in the morning, Heyan got up, and the wheat handed her a pear: \"I picked it in the woods next to the martial arts arena. It has been washed. Have a taste.\"He Yanfang combed and took a bite. He almost lost his teeth. Seeing her sour, he narrowed her eyes and scratched his head with embarrassment: \"the wild forest is not very ripe. It should be sweeter after a while. However, in autumn, there are many wild fruits in the mountains and forests. We can pick a few fruits secretly after practicing every day. This kind of sour pear is salted with sugar to make ice sugar and Sydney. It's deliciousHe Yan said, \"there is no sugar here.\"Wheat Leng for a while, seem to just react to come over, some disappointments way: \"also.\"\"Not necessarily,\" interrupted Hong Shan, who was glaring at their words: \"today is not about merit. Ah he, you and Shi Shi won the first place in the flag fight last time. Maybe there is sugar in your reward today. Maybe there's something else to eat, and some rock sugar and Sydney! \"At the mention of this, wheat suddenly became excited and said, \"yes, brother ahoga, we will discuss the work tonight. Do you have a good idea of what you want?\"\"It's not that I can give anything I want,\" He Yan said with a smile, \"the Wei office is not the capital city, and there is a shortage of materials.\"\"Hey, he wants to be in the forward camp.\" Hongshan also chewed a bite of pear, vaguely said: \"on this request, certainly can satisfy.\"He Yan smiles. These days, although she is calm, she is a little excited. Once in the nine flag camp, the representative and Xiao Jue's distance is closer, and they will be more open and aboveboard to deal with the issue of Hejia. She wants to achieve her wish tonight. So far, her military career is quite smooth.After all, general Feihong should be robbed wherever he went. He Yan was a little pleased.In the daytime, he still went to the arena to train. But in the evening, everyone was enjoying the moon in the open space near the foot of the mountain outside the martial arts arena. Liangzhou is no better than the capital city. Naturally, it will not be like the rich and noble families in the past. They will hold banquets in their own courtyard or in restaurants and boats to invite colleagues and friends to fill them with delicious dishes. To enjoy the moon in Liangzhou is nothing more than to light a bonfire. The recruits sit around and eat something good. Maybe there will be rice wine. Friends boast, gossip, family, drink, eat meat, look at the moon, also passed.In the afternoon, he Yan went back to his room and changed a clean dress. The recruits in Liangzhou garrison have strong clothes in spring, summer, autumn and winter. They can wear clothes in spring and autumn. There are two pieces of clothes, one red and one black. The style is simple and dirty. He Yan changed a red one and went to find Cheng Lishu first.Cheng Lishu has already been to the martial arts arena in the morning. He asks Heyan to look for him in his room in the evening. Heyan estimates that Cheng Lishu is going to give her something to eat. Sure enough, when he sees Cheng Lishu, the young boy hands her a mahogany basket.The basket is exquisitely made, and the design of Chang'e flying to the moon is carved on the top of the basket. When you open it, you can see that there are neat moon cakes, which are fragrant and delicious.\"Brother he, this is for you,\" Cheng Lisu whispered. \"The moon ball of Liangzhou Weifa is too rough. I will give you the one that others gave me.\"He Yan said, \"thank you very much.\" In fact, she was not particularly interested in cakes or other things, but if the basket was given wheat, the child would probably jump with joy.\"You haven't eaten this before, have you?\" Cheng Lei Su's eyes flashed a trace of sympathy, but also some pride, \"this is not the best. The cakes of Zuoyu building in Shuo capital city are unique in the world. In the future, we will go back to Beijing together. I will invite you to eat in zuiyu restaurant. I will tell you secretly, \"Cheng Lishu offered a treasure like way:\" my uncle also likes the food of Zuoyu house. \"He Yan thought that Cheng Lishu, like he Yunsheng, worshipped Xiao Jue unconditionally and without any mind. As if Xiao Jue agreed, it would not be worse.But well, to be honest, Xiao Jue is really good.After thanking Cheng Li Su's autumn gift, it was getting dark, and Heyan went out with the basket of snacks. At the foot of the mountain, a bonfire has been set up in the field. The fire was bright. Many recruits had arrived and sat on the ground near the fire. It is said that every recruit can get meat pie and orange. There are also wooden branches near the campfire, with rabbits and fish on them. It seems that they were hunted on the Baiyue mountain.It seems that there is meat to eat today.Heyan was in a good mood. He even threw the basket one after another. The aroma of roasted game lingered around, making people feel hungry. She also saw a big wine jar near each bonfire. The wine should not be good wine, and it tastes a bit pungent, but at this time, it's only when the liquor is poured down.She came a little late. She went to look for wheat first. When she passed by other recruits, they all looked at her with a strange look.I was probably trying to guess what good things she could get today.Heyan happily walked forward and came to a place near the foot of the mountain when he saw them. Wheat they surrounded in a campfire, Heyan waved to him from a distance, called: \"wheat!\"Hearing the voice, the boy looked over, but not as enthusiastic as usual with her response, as if some hesitation. He Yan came closer to see that in addition to Hongshan and stone, Jiang Jiao, Wang Ba and Huang Xiong also came. The three people gathered together. Heyan put down the snack basket in his hand, then sat down cross legged, opened the cover of the basket, and said with a smile, \"what good things have I brought you? You don't have to be very grateful. \"She picked up a delicate moon group and handed it to the wheat. The child was so greedy that she said, \"here you are!\"Wheat Leng for a moment, slowly reach out to take over, mumble a lip, want to say what did not say. Heyan to other humanitarians: \"take what you want.\"No one answered her.He Yan raised his head, and everyone was staring at him, looking at her eyes a little strange. Even the careless Hongshan is silent. He Yan asked suspiciously, \"what's the matter? Why do you look like a ghost? What's the matterHongshan don't go too far. A trace of sympathy flashed in Jiang Jiao's eyes. He said, \"Heyan, don't be sad.\"\"What am I sad about?\" He Yan is at a loss.The atmosphere is suffocating silence. He Yan looks at Huang Xiong. Huang Xiong moves his eyes and rubs the Buddha beads on his chest. It seems that the world has nothing to do with me. But Wang Ba couldn't help it, and said, \"I'm afraid Well, even if you don't enter the forward camp, don't be too sad. It depends on people. \"He Yan was relieved and said, \"I thought it was something. How could I not be in the vanguard camp? I...\" Her words stopped, and then looked at the crowd. They could not bear it. She moved her lips and heard her voice, like floating in the air, \"really not in?\"\"When you were away, the head coach of general manager Shen went there. Lei Hou entered the forward camp, but No mention of you. \" Wheat carefully considered the words.\"Did you miss it?\" He Yan heart still has a ray of luck, \"maybe because I just did not come.\"\"I asked the head coach for you,\" stone whispered, \"we didn't enter the forward camp this time. Of the others, except for others, Lei Hou was lucky to get in. \"He Yan is silent.Everyone is staring at her nervously. How much he Yan wants to enter the forward camp is obvious to all. When I first came to Liangzhou, I was reluctant to even run with heavy load. At that time, the boy was forced to carry down in order to enter the forward camp. His skill is so excellent that he won the first place in the competition for the flag, not to mention that he can't understand. Even in the eyes of the people around him, he feels incomprehensible.\"It's OK. I'm not angry,\" Hong Shan comforted her. \"Isn't it just a forward camp? We're not rare. Let's go to another battalion, infantry camp, cavalry camp? As long as you have the ability, why don't you appreciate it? Ah he's such a thousand li horse, you have to be appreciated by bole. They don't want you. They have no vision! \"\"Not bad.\" Jiang Jiao also felt sorry for her. He Yan's opponent is far more convincing than Lei Hou's, \"you are so powerful that you can see real gold with fire, and people will know it in the future.\"They were comforted, but when they saw that the young man, who was always open-minded, bowed his head for the first time and said nothing, his whole body was full of drooping and dejected, then he gradually calmed down.Hongshan pokes wheat in the arm and signals him to say a few words. Wheat is racking his brains and trying to speak. Heyan suddenly stands up and says nothing, and he wants to go out.\"Well, where are you going?\" Huang Xiong grabbed her.\"I went to find Xiao Jue and asked,\" why did you choose Lei Hou instead of me? What can't I do better than Raymond? My name is not in the vanguard campHongshan was startled. Unexpectedly, he Yan called the governor's name. He stopped his action: \"you can't be so impulsive! Looking for Xiao Dudu now will only displease the governor and make it impossible for him to go to the vanguard camp in the future\"Yes, yes,\" wheat said clumsily, \"aho, governor Shaw is deliberately keeping you to do something else, such as going to another camp. You're so good, there's no reason not to choose you! \"\"I'm good at this,\" he Yanqi's face was blue. \"Let Xiao Jue stand in front of me, we have a fight, I think he may not beat me!\"Jiang Jiao went to cover Heyan's mouth in a hurry. All these words were said. It can be seen that he was really angry.People were afraid that she would go down to find Xiao Jue's trouble, so they pulled her back to her original position and sat down. Huang Xiong said: \"young man, don't be so anxious. You don't have to worry about firewood. He's the governor now. You're a new recruit. How can you talk equally? When you become an official and a general, you can see him again!\"\"It will take another ten years or eight years,\" Wang Ba muttered. \"It may not be able to be one.\"Jiang Jiao also said: \"this commander Xiao is really true. It is clear that we are the first. Lei Hou or he Yan's defeated general, how could he abandon Heyan and choose Lei Hou?\"\"I heard,\" Wang Ba thought for a moment, \"that Lei Hou seems to have something to do with a religious leader here. He may be a relative. He may be through the back door. I think these noble people are powerful and powerful, so they can't care about the lower class. \"Wheat couldn't help but open his mouth: \"Don Xiao is not that kind of person! There must be some misunderstanding in thisWang Babai glanced at him: \"who are you from?\"Wheat no longer spoke.\"Gentlemen,\" He Yan held his breath, \"I have a terrible headache. Can you please let me be quiet for a while.\"The crowd immediately silenced.The bonfire danced in front of him, and the night color reflected by the fire became red. He Yan in any case do not understand why Xiao Jue points Lei Hou into the forward camp.She thought that she had been blind for some time, but it was far from Xiao Jue's. Did she not perform well in liangzhouwei all the way? Good can't be better. She won't fight much for the flag? Many aspects are not left for others. Even the array that ordinary recruits are difficult to solve has been broken, so talented, Xiao Jue is actually not moved?If it's good for her to take back Xiao Jue!He Yan only felt his Qi liver ache, never thought this tone was not the last. Another moment later, Mr. Shen came over.In full view of the public, he had a small box carried over, only to the public: \"you are all here, just in time, this time the flag won the first place, tonight is also the Mid Autumn Festival, this is your lottery.\"Wheat used to open the box, but there was a small jar of wine and a few ingots of silver.\"It's eighteen immortals. It's a small altar worth a hundred Liang,\" Mr. Shen said with satisfaction. \"You can drink it tonight. Don't be greedy.\"\"Eighteen immortals,\" Wang Ba smacked his lips. \"I didn't expect to drink eighteen immortals here. I'm worth my life!\"In a flash, he forgot who was still scolding \"powerful and powerful people\".Huang Xiong also swallows and swallows. He is a hero. He loves wine and is precious. Even if he was as young as wheat and didn't like wine, he grabbed a ingot of silver and bit it in his hand.It's not big, but it's not small. In the joy, Heyan is particularly unique.She just took a look at the box, then suddenly gave a smile and said, \"it seems that our governor is not doing well.\"Shen Han was stunned.\"I'm so poor.\" The boy didn't look at him. He took the branch and poked the firewood in the fire. He looked down and said to himself that everyone could hear the evil in his words.Hongshan covered her mouth and said with a smile: \"this brother is drunk, drunk Don't talk nonsense like a child. \"Shen Han left for no reason.After Shen Han left, he Yan looked at the box on the ground and couldn't help but sneer: \"this thing, send the beggar.\"\"That's a good thing, brother.\" Huang Xiong said patiently, \"you are angry.\"He Yan is holding the fire and doesn't want to talk.Huang Xiong sat down beside her, took her shoulder, looked at the flames beating in front of her, and said in a deep voice: \"young man, don't be discouraged. It's just that you meet a hurdle. Look at me,\" he pointed to himself. \"Now you just don't have a chance to enter the vanguard camp. I didn't have anything at that time.\"He was not willing to move the jar of eighteen immortals. He poured two bowls of yellow rice wine beside him, one for Heyan and the other for himself. He tasted a mouthful and said, \"what a strong wine!\"Seeing he Yan did not speak, he pointed to the Buddha beads on his neck and said, \"this is my mother'sThe Buddha beads are dark and shining with warm light. They are not commensurate with his vigorous physique. However, Huang Xiong has never seen him walk by. He also pointed to his knife: \"this knife, killed 19 people.\"This is a little creepy. For a moment, even Wang Ba looked at him. He Yan eyes light micro motion, looks at her.Seeing that she finally had a reaction, Huang Xiong said in an impassioned voice: \"I was as old as you at that time. We have a Dao manual which is handed down from our ancestors. Some people came to buy it, but my father refused to sell it. \"\"At that time, my companion and I went out to spend the heat. When we came back, our house was full of people, and the property in the house was all there. We lacked the sword manual.\"Wheat exclaimed: \"this is...\"\"Some people destroyed the whole family of Huang for the sake of Dao spectrum.\" At this point, Huang Xiong looks very calm. I don't know whether it's because of too long time or something else. He said: \"I reported to the official, and the local officials could not take care of the matter. So I personally investigated and scattered my family wealth. I carried a knife for thousands of miles by myself and went looking for the trace of the thief. It took me three years to find where they were. \"\"I'm afraid that if I can't find revenge, I'll take my own life. I'm not afraid of death. I just don't want to die in vain. I'm the only one left in the Huang family. I'm dead, and no one can get justice for them. \"\"So I pretended to be a coolie, and went into the house. During the day, they observe the terrain and their daily habits, and at night they practice sabre. For a year and a half, I found a chance to avenge our Huang family one night. \"The story was breathtaking, but it was told by him. The danger of the story can be imagined. But seeing that the bald man only had peace in his eyes, he looked at Heyan and said, \"it's not too late for a gentleman to take revenge on him for ten years. If I had tried my best to get justice from them, I would have been killed in the end. But now, the enemy is dead and I am still alive, and I can still be with you here Drinking and eating meat, you say, who won? \"He wanted to use his own affairs to tell Heyan that he should not show off his anger for a moment.Heyan laughed and was about to open his mouth when Jiang Jiao reached out and poured himself a bowl of yellow rice wine. He looked up and took a big gulp. He was not as good at drinking as Huang Xiong. His face was so hot that he reached out to wipe the wine stains on his lips. He blurted out: \"that is, when no one is sad, you are nothing. Look at me, the young master of the martial arts school. I have a fiancee, which was originally this year I should have married her, but she died. \"Wheat's eyes widened and he was about to ask questions. He was rammed by a stone before he became quiet.\"Do you know how she died?\" Jiang Jiao's eyes turned red and said in a stuffy voice, \"she died of love. She liked others and refused to marry me, so she died of love with that scholar! Do you think I'm worse than you and I? \"It's no wonder that Jiang Jiao was so good-looking and skillful that he came to join the army. He was so frustrated that he simply stayed away from his hometown.They all looked at Wang Ba, who was puzzled. Then he said in shame and anger, \"what do you want me to do? I don't have a lot of stories! What's wrong with you all? Well, that's a good thing to say?

Bonfire reflects the fragrance of wine, elegant and luxurious. The recruits bow their heads to drink and eat meat, and look up to talk and enjoy the moon, which has become the unique scenery of liangzhouwei.Mars floated out along the autumn wind, making people wonder if it would burn to the clothes. But in a moment it became a fire, accompanied by a low sob.Wheat sobbed: \"I have forgotten what my parents look like...\"\"I'm more miserable,\" Wang Ba said without expression. \"I haven't seen my parents since I was born.\"He Yan said: She raised her hand and poured herself a mouthful of wine, trying to calm herself down.In order to comfort her, many people compare their own disappointments. In the end, they seem to compare each other who is more miserable. Now, all the recruits on the other side were laughing and laughing, and only at their end were gloomy and miserable.Looking at the tearful wheat and Wang Ba, and the red eyed young master Jiang Jiaojiang who drinks alone, Heyan is speechless. Well, I don't know who is comforting whom.Huang Xiong looked at her and said, \"brother he, you have a good drink.\"He Yan a Zheng, look down to oneself, imperceptibly, she all drank the third bowl. She didn't know how much she could drink. She thought that the weak lady would not drink this pungent liquor with a broken bowl, but it was very familiar to the former general Feihong.When it's cold, when you're afraid, when you're in a bad mood, when you're hungry, if you have wine on hand, you can withstand the hard times for a while. Wine can drive cold, can strengthen courage, can satisfy hunger, can also pour sorrow.When she was in shuojing, she did not drink, for fear of falling into the dew. When she came to Fuyue army, she was in Mo County, but she gradually became a habit. Will also train out the amount of alcohol, the account of the young general recruits, no one can drink her. Sometimes, she is the only one who can wake up at the end of a feast to celebrate a great victory.This may be the legendary lonely quest for defeat.What surprised her was the stone. She thought that the stone grew up in the mountain and looked strong. When the wine was good, she fell on her back and fell asleep before half a bowl of wine was drunk?His remaining half bowl of wine was taken away by his brother wheat, and he worked with Wang Ba and said, \"I didn't expect that all of us are degenerates from the end of the world. In this way, we will be a family in the future.\" After that, he drank it dry, and his nose was flushed with spicy wine. Then, with his elder brother, he lay on his back and was drunk.He Yan said It's my own brother. \"Wang Ba immediately lost such a friend. He went to take Jiang Jiao's shoulder, handed him a bunch of roast rabbit meat, and said, \"don't just drink wine. Come on, eat some meat. Your fiancee doesn't choose you. It's because you two have no predestination. \" This is the first time he said like human words, \"life in the world, gathering and dispersing are fate, there is no need to force.\"Jiang Jiao takes over his rabbit meat and still drinks in silence. Huang Xiong looked at the moon in the sky and said to himself, \"I miss my family.\"He Yan takes out a month group from the snack basket Cheng Lishu gave her. The moon group made a small one, shaped like water chestnut, with the red \"flower and moon full\" written on it. She took a bite and tasted the sweetness of sesame and peach kernel.\"If they were alive, I would not be here. I would be in the hometown of Chuang Hu,\" said Huang Xiong. \"My mother's food is delicious. I want to eat her food.\"He Yan lowered his head and ate the cake silently. Huang Xiong asked, \"what about you?\" He turned his head and looked at Heyan, \"how do you live at this timeThe usual Mid Autumn Festival? He Yan is in a trance.Before she joined the army, she spent the Mid Autumn Festival with other people. It's just that I have a special identity. I'm not very free. In fact, she also liked the bustle of the festival, but it was inconvenient to wear a mask. She is an awkward existence in the he family. In terms of her identity, she is a legitimate daughter. On the other hand, she neither belongs to Dafang nor to Erfang.After three years of military service in Moxian County, at the beginning, I was worried every day. I didn't know which day I would die in the sand field and have a reunion in the Mid Autumn Festival.Later, she went back to Beijing and married to the Xu family. At this time last year, she was blind.With that person full of hope for a happy marriage has not been achieved, he fell into a dark. At that time, she thought she couldn't get out, and she would be like this all her life. On August 15, she asked Xu Zhiheng to take her to the mountain to worship Buddha. She hoped that the Bodhisattva would bless her and let her see the light again. Xu Zhiheng agreed.In fact, on that day, she did not really want to ask for the blessing of Bodhisattva.As soon as the tip of her tongue hurt, she accidentally bit her tongue, and the sweet and greasy taste was covered with stinging pain. He Yan regained his mind, avoided Huang Xiong's eyes, and said as if nothing had happened: \"it's just like this. It's almost the same as now.\"\"I see you as if I saw myself.\" Huang Xiong took a sip of wine and said, \"you are just like me in those years.\"He Yan smiles: \"elder brother, my family lives well.\" Even better than most people.\"But you won't take it.\" She heard Huang Xiong's voice and looked sideways. The bald man's face showed the wisdom and vicissitudes of life of a middle-aged man. He touched the Buddha's bead and said, \"you have not revenged your great revenge. You are not willing to do so, so you are always troubled and trapped.\"He Yan's heart moved, did not speak.\"I don't know what kind of hatred you are,\" he said, looking at the moon. \"Sometimes your eyes look the same as I did at that time.\"He Yan is a bit at a loss, does she have? She always thought she was a good cover up.\"It will be all right one day.\" The man lowered his head and patted her on the shoulder: \"you have to believe that.\"He Yan did not speak, quietly picked up the wine bowl to drink. Huang Xiong no longer spoke, eating meat and drinking himself. Wang Ba is also a bit drunk, holding his head and sitting in the same place, giggling, while Jiang Jiao, burying his head in his knee, does not know whether he is crying or sleeping.\u2026\u2026The instructors also gathered together to eat meat and drink on the campfire. After days of hard training, they have finally seen results in these recruits. He was a young master from the capital city. He had never experienced this new way of playing. Even the roasted rabbit leg sprinkled with coarse salt was delicious. Originally, I still wanted to go to Heyan to talk to him. After a sip of wine, I felt that my legs were weak and could not walk. I sat back again.The instructors laughed in good faith and said, \"Master Cheng has to practice drinking more, but I can't be Wei'er Lang in Liangzhou!\"\"I'm not from liangzhouwei,\" Cheng Lisu muttered. \"I just came here to have fun.\"This child can always say his \"can't\" rightfully. If this is the descendant of the Godhead's own family, he would have been beaten up for ten times and eight times. But this man was Xiao Jue's nephew, so they all said, \"it's still childe Cheng who is open-minded.\" \"It's not good to drink too much. My wife won't let me drink! Learn from Mr. Cheng! \"\"No process, childe,\" Liang Ping asked him, \"is the governor really not going out to have fun with us\"Uncle doesn't like places that are too noisy,\" Cheng Lisu replied. \"Surely he won't come.\"Some people feel that Xiao Jue is too inhumane. After all, this is the Mid Autumn Festival. Even the generals who don't enjoy the Mid Autumn Festival with their subordinates are too proud to have deep feelings with their subordinates.However, some people don't mind. Ma damiei laughs, \"or you'd better send some food and wine to the governor. It's hard for a person to have a big holiday.\"\"No need,\" Cheng said. \"My uncle won't drink this kind of inferior yellow rice wine.\"All of them said, \"wellWell, after all, it was the second son of the Xiao family in shuojing. He would never be forced to drink.Du Mao asked curiously, \"Mr. Cheng, do you know how much wine the governor has? I have heard that general Feihong is not drunk for a thousand cups. I wonder whether the governor is better or worse than general Feihong? \"When the instructors heard the speech, they immediately looked at Cheng Lishu. Any talk about general Feihong or general Fengyun is always fresh. From swordsmanship to drinking capacity, from height to temperament, people have to compare one by one. It is a pity that the two men have never appeared together outside the window, nor have they ever competed in person. Moreover, general Feihong has always been wearing a mask. It is still a mystery who is better than him.\"My uncle, of course.\" Cheng Li Su did not want to answer, \"I grow so big, I have never seen my uncle drunk.\"In fact, Cheng has never seen Xiao Jue drink. However, he could not have said this in front of the leaders. No matter how powerful general Feihong was, he could not be more powerful than his uncle.\"Go and go, don't talk about people behind their backs.\" Shen Han waved his hand, \"how can you be as garrulous as a lady when you drink wine! Mr. Cheng, here, I'd like to propose a toast to you Mr. Cheng? \"Mr. Cheng's face was red and he was drunk.\u2026\u2026It is night, green curtain close to the bright moon, collapse on the shadow of desolate. Autumn sound is quiet, someone is playing the piano.On the moon, Mulan has bones, and Ling binghuai is like jade. The sword hung on the wall was like frost and snow. The young people in their clothes were handsome and calm. Their hands touched the strings, and their feelings were moving and flying. They were intoxicated.He plays \"streamer\".This is the night of the Mid Autumn Festival. Even though the new recruits of Liangzhou Wei are far away from their families, they still gather together and sing and drink. It is not as quiet as he is. He didn't seem to notice it. He just plucked the strings carefully, and the green silk was hung over his shoulder and was covered with a cold color by the moonlight.From spring to autumn, from summer to cold, it seems that it is just a blink of an eye.The moon was more colder and quieter by his music. The night sky was as clear as water. The music seemed to float down endlessly in the long sky, and people wanted to cry.All of a sudden, something hit the yard, making a clear sound, which interrupted the silent sound of the piano. Xiao Jue made a movement and looked up. Through the window, we could see that something was thrown in again outside the courtyard wall.He paused for a moment, stood up and pushed the door out. At this time, a third thing fell in and fell right beside him. He bent down to pick it up and found it was a stone.Feinu showed his shadow behind him and said in a low voice, \"young master, outside...\"Xiao Jue opened the gate.Outside stood a young man in red, with a small jar of wine in his hand. The cork had been pulled out, and the aroma was fragrant. It was eighteen immortals.He is generous. Ordinary people have to hide a small jar of wine for a long time before they are willing to take a sip. Judging from his appearance, he must have drunk a lot.This man is He Yan.Xiao Jue looked at her indifferently. He Yan's eyes widened. He seemed to see his appearance clearly. He said, \"Xiao Jue?\"The flying slave behind him couldn't help but look at Heyan. He called the young master's name directly. He was really bold.\"What are you doing here?\" Xiao Jue asked him.\"I thought and thought,\" the young man did not know how much wine he had drunk, and his whole body was full of alcohol. However, he looked as usual. He could not see whether he was drunk or not. He said, \"you chose Lei hou to go to Qianfeng camp. I'm not convinced, so Xiao Jue,\" he said with a curve of his mouth, \"let's have a fight.\"The voice did not fall, the body will go straight to Xiao Jue!The flying slave behind him saw this, and he would come forward and listen to Xiao Jue's command: \"don't move.\" I dare not move at the moment.The young man flew forward and raised his fist to Xiao Jue. Xiao Jue sidestepped away and twisted his eyebrows to look at him.He Yan had no weapons and came with his bare hands. It would be stupid to say it was an assassin. But his words were clear and his eyes were clear. He didn't look like he was drunk and crazy. Xiao Jue looked at him and saw what he wanted to do. He Yan can't make a hit, turn around and come again.Young people are flexible, but they really want to fight, but the way they use is poor and rough. At first glance, it seems that the students in the school are fighting. They only know how to greet each other with fists and feet, but ignore the accuracy.Xiao Jue sidestepped again, and failed to attack twice in a row. He Yan doubted and said to himself, \"when is my skill so bad?\"The flying slave, who was waiting at the same time:Does this young man think he can beat Xiao Er childe? I've heard that there is no one in Liangzhou Wei's Heyan eyes. He is arrogant and arrogant. I can see it now, but I can't believe it. The young master is really good-natured. He didn't put the boy out of the door.She had been defeated and defeated again and again. She came back again. This time, she was still shunned by Xiao Jue. Xiao Jue was about to open her mouth when she saw a black object coming towards her. She frowned, but she did not want to think about it. She drew out the sword of Yinqiu and chopped it across.He stepped back and was not touched. He Yan, who came with that thing, could not avoid it and was poured from head to toe.The moon is perfect, the wind and dew are beautiful, the cassia seed is in bloom, and the wine is fragrant. On the ground are scattered pieces of eighteen immortals, each piece is crisp and fragrant, and the young man's clothes are fragrant and frown.She seemed to be awakened by the fragments of wine jars all over the ground. Looking at Xiao Jue, she stepped forward like a little lady who was trampled on zhuchai in the flower market and said, \"if it's broken, you'll pay for it!\"Feinu looked at it and thought that the young man was really drunk, otherwise he would not be so righteous and confused. In a low voice, he said to Xiao Jue, \"young master, do you want your subordinates to take him away?\"Xiao Jue raised her hand to stop it and shook her head gently.For many years, the master and the servant knew what each other thought with one look. Feinudun understood that the reason why Xiao Jue didn't throw Heyan out at the first time was not because he had a good temper, but just wanted to try Heyan. The boy's identity is suspicious now, and his whole body is full of doubts. If he can ask for something through drunkenness, he can save a lot of effort. It would be more unforgivable to pretend to be drunk and do something else tonight.And he hid himself in the tree, and said no more.Xiao Jue turned to walk inside the house and said, \"why should I compensate?\"Hearing the speech, the teenager rushed into Xiao Jue's room. She ran very fast and staggered. She grabbed in front of Xiao Jue and blocked her way. She said, \"do you know who I am?\"Xiao Jue smile, eyes very cold: \"who are you?\"He Yan patted his thigh and said, \"my husband can't change his name or sit down. I, Heyan! Liangzhou is the first\"Liangzhouwei first?\" Xiao Jue looked at her like a smile: \"who told you?\"\"Do you need to be told?\" Also do not know whether the drunk youth, tone is amazing, of course, \"I know.\"Xiao Jue sidled around him, put down his sword, picked up the teapot on the table and poured tea for himself. Then he took a step. The boy stuck to him like a tail and stood in front of him and asked him, \"do you say, am I short or not?\"Is this man drunk and likes to be taller than others? Xiao Jue glanced at his hair on his chest and nodded: \"short.\"He Yan: \"I'm not short!\"Xiao Jue:He Yan asked him again, \"am I stupid or not?\"Xiao Jue stops pouring tea in his hand, stares at him, and says slowly: \"stupid.\"He Yan: \"I'm not stupid!\"Xiao Jue suddenly regretted that he didn't throw Heyan out of the yard for the first time. Instead, he came here to ask for trouble and set his words. Apart from listening to his nonsense here, there seems to be no useful information. Either He Yan is too stupid, or he is smart enough to leak.\"What else do you want to boast about yourself, together?\" He drooped his eyes and opened his mouth without salt.He Yan: \"I am tall and powerful, fierce and invincible. I am handsome and free from vulgarity. Why, why, why no one likes me? Do you know how hard I workXiao Jue:\"Because of you, I'm not happy tonight, I ask you,\" she stepped forward, and Xiao Jue's distance was extreme, looking up at him, earnestly asked: \"do you like me?\"Xiao Jue stepped back, opened the distance with her, dusted the sleeve that she had pulled out of shape, as if seeing the plague God to avoid, calmly replied: \"I am not a broken sleeve.\"\"Neither am I He Yan murmured, raised his head suddenly, looked sad and angry, and asked in a loud voice: \"then why do you prefer Lei hou to me! That person is higher than me, where can I be? In terms of appearance, skill, or the past affection of you and me, Xiao Jue, you are too much and too insightful! I'm disappointed! \"At this time, Shen Han, who is going to send some roast rabbit meat to Xiao Jue, covers his mouth and looks surprised. Just now, he seemed to have heard some terrible secret.In the room, the young man in the white coat looked up at the people in front of him, and the young man looked up at himself. His eyes were bright and his voice was full of fear and hesitation, which made people wonder what she was thinking.What is love in the past? However, he had been given a mandarin duck pot before, which became the affection of the past. He was too familiar with himself.\"But it's nothing,\" the boy suddenly raised his mouth, with a sly smile, and whispered: \"if you pick Lei hou to enter the Qianfeng camp, I'll fight with Lei Hou every day, ten times and ten times defeated. The people of man Liangzhou Wei all know that Xiao Jue is blind and has a bad eye. What will you do then? \"Xiao Jue:After saying this, Heyan belched wine and fell on Xiao Jue's soft collapse. When he fell down, he half of his body fell on the Wanxiang lute lying horizontally, pressing the strings to a harsh clang, \"bang Dang\", and fell to the ground.Standing in the middle of the room, Xiao Jue's eyebrows fluttered faintly. She felt that today's idea of taking advantage of the wine routine was really bad and could not be worse.At a glance, there was a figure by the door, hesitating. He said coldly, \"what are you doing outside if you don't come in?\"Shen Han was shocked and came over. Just now he heard the secret at the door, and when he entered the yard, he was seen by the flying slave. He was neither in nor out. At the moment, the governor was in a bad mood. Don't make fun of him.\"My subordinates took some rabbit meat that had just been roasted from the outside, thinking that the governor might not be able to use the dinner, so he sent it specially.\" Shen Han put the roast meat wrapped in oil paper on the table, \"governor, please use it slowly. I'll go down first.\"\"Wait a minute.\" Xiao Jue said unhappily, \"can't you see such a big living man?\"He motioned Shen Han to look at Heyan. When Shen Han looked at him, he was moved. He only listened to Heyan's words and had a deep relationship with Xiao Jue. At the moment, he saw that the young man was so generous in sleeping on the soft collapse of Mr. Xiao. It was Xiao's soft collapse! Liangzhou Weizhong, I'm afraid he has the courage to do so. This is the only one.The relationship between them is really extraordinary!Xiao Jue went to the soft collapse, picked her up with the collar of Heyan's back neck and threw her in front of Shen Han: \"your people, take it away.\"\"No, I dare not.\" Shen Han said.Xiao Jue: whatShen Han said quickly: \"my subordinates mean that all the recruits of Liangzhou Wei are under the charge of the governor. How can we say that they are subordinates? It's the governor's man. \"Xiao Jue laughed angrily: \"Shen Han, you talk a lot today.\"\"My subordinates understand,\" Shen Han Yilin, \"I'll take him away!\" Just then he turned around and walked half way. He seemed to think of something. Shen Han asked, \"where does the governor think his subordinates should send this boy?\"Xiao Jue calmly looked at him: \"do you want to send it to your home?\"\"No, no more!\" Shen Han felt numb and said, \"Heyan Return to his original roomAfter Shen Han left, feinu entered the room.When he pinched the string, the young man could not help but break the string.\"Young master,\" said Fei Nu, looking at the direction of Shen Han's departure, \"Mr. Shen is a little strange today.\"\"He's always weird.\" Xiao Jue replied.\"Young master, do you think he Yan is drunk today?\"Xiao Jue put the piano well, and he Yan decided to drink tea just now. The tea in the cup has been cooled. He poured out the cold tea, poured it again, took a sip and said, \"I'm not sure.\"He Yan is not sure if he is drunk, because normal sober people probably don't talk to themselves like this. But there is no trace of chaos in her steps, words and expressions. Most important of all, he did nothing but collapse a piano, break a jar of wine, and say crazy things here tonight. Including revealing who he is.This is puzzling.\"He seems to have a lot of complaints about Lei Hou being able to enter the forward camp.\" \"He wants to be in the vanguard camp,\" feinu saidXiao Jue mocked: \"it's not only the forward camp, but also the nine flag camp of mine.\"\"Well...\" Feinu asked, \"but if you want to send him to the vanguard camp, you're going to make a plan?\"\"No,\" Xiao Jue said, \"I have other plans.\"Feinu stopped talking. Xiao Jue thought of what he Yan had just said. He had to consult Lei Hou every day to prove his bad eyesight. Such a rogue's behavior is really handy.If you look at the mess in the house, the yard is full of debris, and you have to find a spare time to go to Liangzhou city to ask a master to mend the piano. Heyan has the face to say, \"because of you, I'm not happy on this mid autumn night\". It's unreasonable.The young man stood in the room, elegant as jade, as tall and straight as pine. After a long time, he sniffed: \"I'm sick.\"\u2026\u2026Shen Han, who carries Heyan on his back outside, is also very unhappy.When others saw it, they all looked at Shen Han in surprise and said, \"He Yan is drunk. How can the head coach still carry him on his back?\"Shen Han was calm and silent. If he hadn't broken the relationship between He Yan and Xiao Jue, Shen Han would have asked someone to take him back. But now that they know their relationship, how dare Shen Han neglect.He Yanfang said that he had \"the past affection\" with Xiao Jue! It seems that they had known each other before. Why did the governor pretend to have no knowledge of Yan and secretly investigate his identity. Is it that they were good at the beginning, but had a lot of changes in the middle of the way that they have become the present appearance?It's no wonder that the people of the Wei Dynasty all know that the governor Xiao is not close to women. He is also one of the best brave and outstanding people. So many women are eager to go up and countless unique colors are not moved. It turns out that It turns out that people are not good at this!At the gate of Xiao Jue, he Yan said, \"why do you like Lei Hou but not me?\" the tone was sad and harsh, which really made people cry. Unfortunately, the governor was as hard as iron and completely unmoved. Shen Han thought wildly. The more nervous he was, the more strange stories he remembered.For example, he Yan and Xiao Jue did know each other in the past, and they made friends for some time. But later, Xiao Jue found that he Yan's identity was different, so he cut off his feelings and drew a clear line with the other party. He Yan was very young. He was not willing to come to Liangzhou. Knowing that Xiao Jue was going to come to Liangzhou, he joined the army and went to the camp to ask Xiao Jue for an explanation. Even hard training, want to enter the forward camp, let Xiao Jue look at.He Yan did a good job. Unfortunately, Xiao Jue named Lei Hou in order to avoid suspicion. He Yan is sad and distressed. He can't help but use wine to dispel his worries. He vomits his true feelings after drinking. He finds Xiao Jue to ask for an explanation.Xiao Dudu, who is as hard as iron, flatly refused, but in the end he Yan sleeps on his own soft collapse because he reads in a trace of old love.Very good. Shen Han clapped for himself in his heart. It's very reasonable. It should be like this. It's all right.www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 87": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth of a Star GeneralCH 87Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe second day after the Mid Autumn Festival, it was a rainy day. When Heyan wakes up, the rest of the people are sleeping on the shop, probably because they haven't woken up yet last night. It's just that the call to run outside has been sounded, and training is needed even in rainy days. She got up from the bed and woke the people in the room one by one.\"I'm dizzy.\" wheat is too young to resist such a hangover, but he still feels that his strength is not over. \"Aho, what are you doing?\"He Yan handed the water bag to him: \"drink quickly, wash your face, it's time to run.\"When the wheat took over the water bag and drank, Hongshan saw it and said with a smile, \"wheat, you and your brother have to practice more. How can you handle this amount of wine? It's not as good as your brotherWheat took a look at Heyan and said, \"ah ho brother, you are so good at drinking?\"\"Not so much.\" He Yan perfunctorily said. She didn't feel a headache at the moment. Instead, she was refreshed. She had forgotten when she was going back to the house. I just remember drinking with Huang Xiong in front of the fire. I drank a few more bowls. It seemed that I had opened eighteen immortals By the way, what about the eighteen immortals?\"Why didn't you see the jar of wine that governor Xiao appreciated?\" Hongshan also remembered, \"that's a good thing. Don't lose it.\"\"Maybe it's Wang BA's side.\" He Yan replied. And carefully recalled the memories, it is really nothing to remember.In fact, she was not really drunk. After drinking too much, he will still be drunk, but he Yan is different from others. When I was drunk, I didn't show any sign on my face. I was very clear. When I was in the army, once I was drunk, and I talked about the art of war with the military master in the tent for a night. I looked energetic. On the second day, the military adviser praised he Yanguo as a rare hero in the world. In fact, he Yan did not remember what he did last night.Even if you are drunk, others can't see it. I will not walk in vain and talk nonsense. So, it's a scene that won't be seen, but what did she do last night?Can't think of it any more, they quickly washed their faces and cleaned up, went outside to get dry cakes and ran away.After the rain, the ground is wet. You can't run too fast to avoid slipping. He Yan Ran and felt that someone was looking at him. When he followed his eyes, he saw the head coach Shen Han standing at the end of the horse road, staring at her without blinking. His expression was complicated.Seeing Heyan look over, Shen Han looks away. This is very strange. She is extremely sensitive to people's eyes. Shen Han's appearance seems to be thinking about something. She looked at Shen Han again. Shen Han had gone away.He Yan looked at Shen Han too clearly. A new soldier running beside him said, \"the chief coach is so fierce, it's good for you. What's the relationship between you and how does he take care of you like this\"Take care of me?\" He Yan was baffled: \"how can I not know.\"If Shen Han really takes care of her, he won't point Lei hou to Qianfeng camp.\"Last night, when we went back, we saw Mr. Shen carry you back to the room.\" The new recruit seemed dissatisfied. \"You are too ungrateful. If it were me, Shen Jiaotou would not be so thoughtful.\"He Yan was stunned.She asked, \"did you see Mr. Shen carry me back last night?\"\"Yes,\" the recruit looked at her strangely, \"don't you remember? You may not remember. You are drunk He said that, because the companion in front of him was calling for him to catch up quickly, he rushed to the front regardless of what he Yan looked like.He Yan left behind alone, and was surprised. Is she drunk? Did Shen Han carry her back?What's the reason. She asked them in the morning that they were drunk early. The recruits in the same room dragged them back. When Heyan came back, no one was awake. They did not know when and how he came back.He Yan didn't think Shen Han was a considerate person.She thought about it and didn't think about it until the end of the run. She made up her mind to go to Huang Xiong and find them when the running was over and the drill began. Maybe Huang Xiong knew that. If Huang Xiong didn't know, she would go to ask Shen Han directly.At the end of the run, everyone ran to shelter from the rain in the grass shed or under the tent to drink water. Cheng Lishu came.The boy is holding an oil paper umbrella with some red and white Koi painted on it, which is quite interesting. He couldn't find Heyan, so he went around to ask and finally found someone under the thatched shed.\"Big brother ho!\" He cried.He Yan didn't expect Cheng Lishu to come to her, so he got up and went to his end. He said strangely, \"it's raining so hard. Why don't you stay in the house?\"\"This is not a place to talk.\" Cheng Lishu took her and hid under the umbrella for a long time. After finding the long frame with the flag platform on the back of the martial arts arena, he stopped and looked at Heyan and said, \"I was drunk yesterday. This morning I heard my uncle talk to big brother feinu. I knew you went to my uncle last night.\"\"I went to see your uncle?\" He Yan was shocked.\"Not bad.\"He Yan a bit can't believe, she actually went to find Xiao Jue? Now she is quite dissatisfied with Xiao Jue. It is also for the sake of Qianfeng camp. Looking for Xiao Jue is definitely not a way to reminisce about the past and drink tea. So\"What am I going to do with your uncle?\" He Yan asks slowly.Cheng Lishu was eager to say: \"last night, you may be drunk...\"He Yan said:She tried to make herself smile as usual and said, \"it's OK for you to say it.\"\"You fought with my uncle and crushed his piano.\" Cheng Li Su's honest answer.He Yan closed his eyes.\"Who won?\" She asked.Cheng Lishu didn't expect that Heyan was still concerned about the result at this time. He scratched his head and said, \"maybe it's my uncle. I heard he asked Shen Jiaotou to take you back.\"He Yan said: OK, she took advantage of the drunkenness to go to Xiao Jue to have a contest, but she lost. Now Xiao Jue doesn't like her very much. She is a step away from her entering the nine flag camp.He Yan suddenly feels dejected, thinking that it is impossible to get close to Xiao Jue by taking the nine flag camp. If not to change the way, or as before slowly promoted, although the action is slower I just don't know when she grows up to be close to he Rufei, he Rufei has already become an official?Cheng Lishu looked at her sympathetically and tried to comfort her: \"brother he, in fact, you don't have to lose heart. My uncle My uncle is not so fussy. I came here to tell you that you'd better not go to my uncle these days to save him from getting angry. It's very expensive. He didn't let you pay for it. It's already very open. \"\"I can't afford it either.\" He Yan's depressed reply.\"You see, things are not so bad.\" Cheng Li Su added, \"you don't have to be too sad. I'll speak good words for you in front of my uncle.\"He Yan listless way: \"thank you so much.\"Cheng Lishu left, Heyan looked at the red and white Koi's distant figure, only felt a burst of weakness. She never took it seriously when her brother in the account said that drinking was a mistake. Now it seems true. This came to Liangzhou only drunk once, then poked the basket.Why did Shen Han carry her back to the house in person? I think it's because I witnessed such a chaotic moment and knew that she would never get the favor of Xiao Jue in the future, and her career was hopeless, so she felt sympathy for her.He Yan thought, otherwise, we should find a chance to find Xiao Jue and apologize sincerely. Maybe we can save it?\u2026\u2026At the moment, in the room of the commander of the right army of Liangzhou Wei, Xiao Jue sits at the table and looks at the post in his hand.The post was written by sun Xiangfu, the magistrate of Liangzhou. He said that in a few days, Yuanbao Town, the censor of the capital city, would arrive in Liangzhou. The magistrate held a banquet in the mansion, along with the invitation of Cheng Lishu, Xiao Jue's nephew.Feinu stood behind Xiao Jue and said, \"young master, it's not convenient to take Mr. Cheng to the city. Maybe it's a Hongmen banquet. I'm afraid there's a threat.\"\"Yuan Baozhen has a private connection with Xu Jingfu, and he has been Xu Jingfu's person for a long time,\" Xiao Jue, playing with his post, looked at the sweet scented osmanthus tree in the window and said, \"this is for me. However, I happen to want to know what chess Xu Jingfu planted in Liangzhou.\"\"What does the young master mean?\" Feinu asked hesitantly.\"Yuan Baozhen is Xu Jingfu's, and sun Xiangfu may not be.\" \"The magistrate of Liangzhou should have been changed for a long time,\" Xiao Jue said\"The young master is planning to go to the banquet, and his subordinates want to go with him. But Mr. Cheng needs to be protected when he stays in the guard house. If someone is plotting something wrong...\" He did not finish, referring to Heyan. Now the unknown and extremely dangerous liangzhouwei is He Yan.\"Besides, childe Cheng trusts Heyan very much. If the young master is not here...\" If Cheng Lishu was cheated by Heyan or simply calculated by Heyan, the gain was not worth the loss.\"When did Luan Ying arrive in Liangzhou?\" Xiao Jue asked.\"Luan shadow is still in Lou county.\" Fei Nu replied and looked at Xiao Jue again, \"young master, why don't you refuse the post?\"\"No way,\" Xiao Jue lowered her eyes. \"This banquet must go.\"\u2026\u2026When Cheng Lishu came back, he saw Xiao Jue sitting at his desk reading a book. The book was a jumble of scripts he had bought in the hands of the head coach. He was startled. He went forward without saying a word and said, \"uncle!\"Xiao Jue is casually turning over his book, smell speech hand a shake, look to him, frown way: \"call what?\"\"I I'm wrong Cheng Lei Su road.\"What's wrong?\" Xiao Jue looks at him calmly.You don't seem angry? It's true that I was in a bad mood when I heard that I was fighting with elder brother Xiao Jue last night No, my uncle, are you not angryThinking of a madman who had been crazy last night and overwhelmed him, Xiao Jue's eyes darkened and her tone was as indifferent as ever: \"No.\"\"If not! Uncle, you are still so generous Cheng Lisu quickly flatters.Xiao Jue glanced at him, took out a post from his arms and threw it on his face, \"see for yourself.\"\"What is this?\" Cheng Lishu picked it up and looked at it as he walked along, \"isn't this a post? Someone gave my uncle a post. Here is my name. Is this going to Liangzhou city? Excellent! I've been in the health station all day, and I'm growing mushrooms. Let me have a look. Monitor Yuanbao Town, the imperial historian Why does the name sound familiar? \" He looked suspiciously at Xiao Jue: \"uncle, who is Yuanbao town?\"\"Don't you remember?\" Xiao Jue crooked his lips and reminded him, \"the marriage between you and Miss Song was suggested by Mr. Yuan and your father. Song Ci was once the boss of Lord yuan. \"\"Song, Song family?\" Cheng Lishu loosened the card's hand and dropped it at his feet. He didn't seem to see it. He just looked at Xiao Jue with an uncertain look. \"How could the Song family come to Liangzhou?\"\"It's not the Song family,\" Xiao Jue said lightly, \"it's Yuanbao town.\"\"It's not all the same...\" Cheng Lisu murmured: \"they came to Liangzhou to invite me to a banquet. It's not because they want to take me back to shuojing. I don't want to marry her I don't want to get married... \" He seemed to have suddenly regained consciousness and seized Xiao Jue's sleeve. \"Uncle, you can't watch your nephew jump into the fire pit.\"\"What do I have to do with it?\" Xiao Jue took the sleeve out of his hand and turned the book carelessly.\"It has a lot to do with you!\" Cheng Lishu went around the table to Xiao Jue. \"Uncle, you know I don't like Miss Song! If I marry her, I'd rather die. I'll hang myself on the day of marriage! Uncle, you're not going to die, are you? \"Xiao Jue stopped his movements and looked at him indifferently. He drew out his sword and put it on the table.Cheng Lisu stammered, \"this, what is this for?\"\"You can kill yourself now and see if I can't help you.\"Cheng Lishu glared at the knife and said with a sad face: \"uncle, I really don't want to go back to shuojing. I've been with you for half a year. I'm used to the days of Liangzhou garrison. I really can't live without you.\" He took Xiao Jue's leg and began to cry.Xiao Jue pressed to press forehead heart, seem to be intolerable, way: \"get up.\"Cheng Lei Su didn't move.\"Again, get up.\"Cheng Lishu still held Xiao Jue's leg and blinked at him, \"unless you promise me not to give me to the Song family.\"\"Tired of Liangwei City, don't you want to stay?\"\"I don't want to do it now!\"The young man's voice was faint, \"that's the censor Yuan Bao town.\"\"Uncle, you are still general Feng Yun Xiao Huaijin!\"\"Yuan Baozhen met you and knew you were hiding in Liangzhou. How could he tell the Song family about your neglect?\"Cheng Lishu immediately replied, \"how could he have met me? I've never met him before. My father and mother can't hide this picture of me. If I had met him, he would not have recommended me to Mr. Song. Miss Song and I are totally incompatible at first sight\"Is it?\" Xiao Jue's eye light moved, looking at the boy who was indignant, \"go is must go, since he has not seen you, it is not impossible.\"Cheng Lisu's eyes widened.\"Find someone to take your place and go to the party.\"Cheng Lishu was stunned. After a long time, he finally realized that he did not howl, nor did he cry with Xiao Jue's leg. He stood up and slapped his hands, \"wonderful! What my uncle said is very true. He has never seen me, so he can find someone to replace me! \"\"Do you have a candidate?\"Cheng Lishu looks at him, \"I...\"\"Liangzhou Weili, it seems that there is no youth of your age and stature.\" Xiao Jue said: \"if the difference is too far, it will be found.\"In the barracks of Liangzhou garrison, most of them were young men who were strong and dark. Cheng Lishu is a young master from shuojing. He is raised by Jin Zunyu. He is delicate and tender. He looks different from the recruits in the barracks.\"If you can't find it in person.\" Xiao Jue's way as if nothing had happened.\"Who said it couldn't be found!\" Cheng Lishu was worried and had a brainstorm in his heart, \"my elder brother, my elder brother is almost like me!\"Xiao Jue picks eyebrow, do not agree: \"He Yan?\"\"Yes, my elder brother. My elder brother is of the same age and stature as me, and he is smart. He will be able to adapt to circumstances and cope well with Yuanbao town. Yuan Baozhen can take me, not necessarily my elder brother. \"Cheng Lishu is very new to Heyan. In his opinion, he Yan is the most versatile person besides his uncle. He Yan must be able to do what others can't do.Seeing that Xiao Jue didn't make a noise, Cheng Lishu felt very nervous. He only said that he Yan went to fight with Xiao Jue last night. At the moment, Xiao Jue must still be angry with Heyan. May not want to see Heyan, just want to how to talk about Xiao Jue, see his young uncle a book, light way: \"good.\"Cheng Lishu's words of persuasion were stuck in his throat, and he could only send out an \"ah\"?Xiao Jue looked at him, \"if you can talk about your big brother, let him go instead of you.\"\u2026\u2026At the end of the afternoon's practice, when he Yan was sitting outside the martial arts arena to have a rest, Huang Xiong several people came to him. Instead of saying anything else, he first gave Heyan a ding of silver sent by Shen Han last night, and then asked him where the eighteen immortals had gone.\"I remember that you took it at last,\" Huang Xiong asked. \"I went to look for some empty wine jars today, and the brothers shared some. What do you think?\"\"I think it's very good,\" He Yan said. \"It's just possible to wait until the next flag fight comes down.\"\"What do you mean by that?\" Wang BA was a little impatient. Suddenly he understood something and looked at Heyan: \"you, you are not Drink it upFacing the burning eyes of all, he Yan nodded and said, \"I'm really sorry. I'm not careful and I'll drink it up.\"\"Heyan!\" Wang Bagao said in a loud voice: \"you are too much! That's a lot of money for us. If you drink it yourself, the mountain bandits are not as domineering as you are! \" He rolled up his sleeve to beat Heyan. When he pulled it half way, he remembered that the man in front of him couldn't beat him. He didn't do it. He was very embarrassed for a moment.Jiang Jiao and Shi tou didn't think there was anything wrong with them. They were not greedy for drinks and were not interested in wine. They did not say anything. Although Huang Xiong is not as excited as Wang Ba, his eyes are full of criticism.If on weekdays, he Yan should be sorry for his behavior, but these days after another bad news to hear her also a little numb. Unable to cope with these people's thoughts, he sat here and said nothing.Seeing her silent and dejected appearance, several people looked at each other. Thinking that the attack on Heyan that he had not been in the vanguard camp this time was really great. He drowned his worries with wine last night, but he was still so depressed today. But on second thought, he was really worth it. Others only gave up a few taels of rice wine, but he used several hundred taels of silver. So he did not pour down his worries, which cost a lot of money.Just when several people do not know what to do, someone's voice broke the silence.\"Brother he Brother Ho, you are here Cheng Lishu came panting, with sweat on his forehead, so he came all the way.He Yan saw him for the second time in a day. But as soon as I saw him, I remembered that I had offended Xiao Jue last night and felt a headache. He Yan raised his head and asked, \"how did you come?\"\"I've come to see you about something important.\" Cheng Lishu looked at the people around him, pulled up Heyan and said, \"this is not the place to speak. Brother he, come with me.\"He is Xiao Jue's nephew. Naturally, others dare not say anything. Even if there are still 18 immortals left, they have to watch Cheng Lishu pull Heyan away and stay in the same place with wide eyes.Heyan is pulled by Cheng Lishu and trots all the way to the place where Cheng Lishu lives. He Yan doesn't want to go in here. He knows that Cheng Lishu's next door is Xiao Jue. If he goes in, he will not be embarrassed if he meets his four eyes.Cheng Lishu's brain was clever at last. Seeing that he Yan's face was embarrassed, he stood still and refused to move. He said intimately, \"don't worry, my uncle is out. There is no one here!\"He Yan smell speech, just walked in with him.As soon as he went in, Cheng Li Su looked around and closed the doors and windows, as if to discuss killing and arson. He Yan saw that he was so speechless for a moment.\"If you come to me, you won't talk about your uncle again.\" He Yan said in advance, \"brother Cheng, thank you for your care, but I really don't want to hear about him recently.\" Please give her a face, too.As soon as she finished saying this, she felt that her shoulder was pressed, and Cheng Lishu turned him around. She grasped her hand tightly and pressed it against her chest.He Yan almost subconsciously beat this man to fly.She repressed her impulse to beat people. Although she got along with men more, she was more likely to hook up with each other. It was very awkward for her to clasp her ten fingers together.However, the young boy in front of him is a clear face, and he doesn't feel that his actions cause misunderstanding. However, in his eyes, the two men are like this, and there is nothing to avoid.\"Brother, please help my little brother!\" Cheng Lishu said miserably.\u201c\u2026\u2026 What happened to you? \" He Yan asked.\"You promise me to help you, or you'll never see him again, elder brother.\"\"So serious?\" He Yan asks, but he doesn't think so. Cheng Lishu is a child who always exaggerates. He can say anything big. What's more, if something goes wrong, his uncle, Xiao Jue, will help him. \"Tell me what it is before I can help you.\"\"Do you remember what I said to you that I escaped from marriage. My family wanted to marry me, but I really didn't want to, so I begged my uncle to take me to Liangzhou. \" Cheng Lishu said here, a group of sad, \"now my family has not let me go. Now they came to Liangzhou and sent a post to my uncle to let him go to dinner with me. God, I am a boy who has no official position and no fame. Why did I write my name on the post. It is clear that he is scheming for me to take advantage of my arrival, so that I can be taken away! \"What he said was similar to robbing civilian women. He almost went to the gate of Yamen to beat drums and complain about injustice.\"It's not as good as that,\" He Yan said. \"If you don't want to go, your uncle will protect you. Can they take you away by force in front of your uncle? \"Cheng Lishu is not easy to say that Xiao Jue may really watch people take him away, and he may be happy to throw away his oil bottle. He coughed softly and said, \"elder brother, you know my mother has been very critical of my uncle. If he appears for me, will he not again commit himself to injustice. My mother will hate him to death, I don't want to cause him troubleI didn't expect Cheng Lishu to defend his uncle like this. He Yan felt that this was the blood and blood relationship, which could not be changed in any case.\"What do you want me to do?\" She asked, \"shall I help you to beat that man away? It's against the law to beat an official. \"\"Where do you want to go, big brother!\" Cheng Lishu released her hand. \"I'm not such a rude person. I was thinking that the adult had not seen me before and didn't know what I looked like. Elder brother, we are about the same age. We both look elegant and handsome. We have the same figure. You might as well go to the dinner party instead of me. If the Lord wants his men to catch me, you can escape easily with your skill. In this way, they can't catch me. It's their problem. They can't blame my uncle. \"\"I'll take your place?\" He Yan said, \"no way, no way.\" She turned and wanted to go, and there was a sense of resistance in her heart. It's a stand in again. She's been a stand in for her whole life. Now it's so easy to use her name openly. How can she be a stand in?My God, this is deliberately with her to get along with it!\"Big brother -\" Cheng Lishu called heartrending, \"you really can't die without help! You think, you and uncle go to dinner, with uncle, day and night, you do a little better, uncle see you so considerate, will certainly change your outlook. Besides, you are standing up for his nephew, and my uncle may be grateful for you Maybe I will let you go to the nine flag camp! \"He Yan said:Cheng Lishu is really in order not to go to the banquet, what lies can be said. Xiao Jue is not a person who can buy and sell human feelings. It's not sure that she follows Xiao Jue day and night, but arouses Xiao Jue's anger. If there is anything wrong, she is really struck out.Seeing her resolute refusal to help, Cheng Li Su collapsed on the ground, pointed to his head with one hand, and howled: \"God, why do you treat me like this! Yuan Baozhen, what deep hatred do I have with you in my last life? You want to push me into the fire again and againHe Yan was about to go out of the door. He came to the door. He heard his steps and looked back: \"you said Yuan Baozhen? \"\"Yes,\" Cheng Lishu looked at her and subconsciously replied, \"the adult who made me betrothed is Yuan Bao Town, the censor.\"He Yan eyebrow heart jump, a moment later, she quickly walked to Cheng Lishu, to sit on the ground of the juvenile stretched out a hand.\"Stop howling, isn't it just going to the party? I'll help you. \"www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He Yan has been waiting for him to repeat several times and swear to God before he believes that she really wants to help himself, and Cheng Lishu can believe it.He poured a cup of tea to Heyan and offered it in both hands: \"good brother, you really saved my brother's life! In the future, if there's anything I can do, I'll go up the mountain and go down to the sea of fire, and I'll do my best! \"He Yan just wanted to open his mouth, he immediately said: \"I know that the elder brother's wish is to enter the nine flag camp and make a contribution. Don't worry. Once this matter is over, I will speak to my uncle every day. Even if I can copy books every day, I will help him to finish this matter!\"\u201c\u2026\u2026 I want to say, \"Heyan stopped the child's ecstasy,\" I agreed to go to the banquet instead of you, but you still have to persuade your uncle. \"Is Xiao Jue a person who can agree so easily? After all, it sounds strange.\"Don't worry about it,\" Cheng Lishu happily came up and said, \"I've told my uncle before. I dare to come to you after my uncle agrees.\"\"Did Xiao Jue agree?\" He Yan was stunned.\"Maybe I feel guilty that I didn't let you into the nine flag camp before. I'll give you a chance to show myself.\" Cheng Lishu sincerely looked at Heyan, \"so you see, the right time, the right place and the right people. Elder brother, you go to the banquet instead of me. This is the arrangement of God.\"He Yan didn't have time to pay attention to Cheng Lishu's nonsense. He was just surprised that Xiao Jue agreed so easily. This is not his style of doing things. Are there any traps?Seeing he Yan's silence, Cheng Lishu was anxious again: \"elder brother, are you not repenting?\"\"No He Yan helplessly said, \"I just want to pretend to be you. After all, I'm different from you.\"\"Don't worry, that Yuanbao town has not seen my appearance, and will not be uncovered. But I have to tell you a little bit before I'm seen. I love to eat mushroom fat chicken, the most hate to eat is stem rice porridge. Do not like people to follow, eat peanuts on the face will grow rash. I have to take a bath every day, change clothes frequently, and use incenseall he saw was the extravagant life of a rich son, and he shook his head.Cheng Lishu said the time of a stick of incense. He said that his mouth was dry and his tongue was dry. He took up his tea and ran his throat in a hurry. Only then did he come back to life.\"Brother, do you remember what I said just now?\"He Yan said ... remember. \" She said, \"what else do you have to explain? Let's talk about it together.\"\"Let me see.\" Cheng Lishu sits on the chair and looks at Heyan. He Yan is about the same age as he is. He looks like a new recruit in Liangzhou. However, it was not clumsy and strong at all, and it seemed thin and weak. But this is just the same as him. If he is dressed as a rich man\"Almost forgot the important thing!\" Cheng Li Su patted his forehead, \"you can't go to a banquet if you dress like this. I'm also a young master in zhilang's house. How can I dress so shabby? Wait. \" He ran to the inner room and didn't know what he was doing. After a while, he came out with a bundle.\"Here are some clothes I picked. Take them and wear them. We are not so different from each other. You should be able to put them on. Even if they are fake, big brother, you have to look better. In addition to being good-looking, I don't have any other advantages. If I've been obliterated, wouldn't I be worthless? \"He Yan was amazed that he could say \"embroidered pillow\" so fresh and refined.He turned again and again, took a box in the drawer, filled some things and handed it to Heyan. He said, \"there are hairpins, fans and jade pendants here. It's necessary to do a play.\"He Yan: \"you are really thoughtful.\"Cheng Lishu was embarrassed to scratch his head: \"flatter, flatter.\"He Yan put away the package and the box, and asked, \"if you have already agreed with your uncle, have you not lied to me?\"\"No, no,\" Cheng said. \"If you come here early tomorrow morning, you can probably start.\"\"In such a hurry?\" He Yan was surprised.\"It was supposed to take a few days. Yuanbao town has not yet arrived in Liangzhou, but my uncle has to go to the city to find a craftsman to repair his evening incense zither, so he went earlier.\"He Yan thought of the piano that was crushed by himself, and stopped speaking.Cheng Li Su patted her on the shoulder, \"brother he, it's up to you this time. Thank you very much.\"\u2026\u2026Heyan comes back to the Tongpu house of the recruits with a bundle full of things. Wang Ba and they are still eating the moon ball that he Yan brought from Cheng Lishu last night. See he Yan come back, still carrying things in his hand, Wang Ba sour way: \"Yo, go to receive filial piety again?\"\"Did Mr. Cheng send you something to eat again?\" Wheat eyes staring at the burden in Heyan's hand, saliva will flow out, \"such a big package, what is delicious?\"Heyan put the heavy burden on the table, and the bag was loose, so it was scattered, revealing the things inside. It's not the food people think of, but some clothes and accessories.This is unexpected. After a long time, Hong Shan hesitantly asked, \"ah he, what are you doing with your clothes? We can't wear regular clothes when we are in the barracks\"I'm going to work in the city with governor Xiao tomorrow,\" He Yan said. \"I'm afraid that I'll wear too shabby clothes and lose the face of Dudu Xiao, so Mr. Cheng specially sent me some clothes to decorate my appearance.\"\"You and governor Shaw?\" Huang Xiong looked at him, \"it's a good thing. Why don't you look so happy?\"If nothing happened last night, Heyan should be very happy. After all, he can listen to a lot of news around Xiao Jue. It's just that after last night's incident, I'm afraid Xiao Jue doesn't like her any more. Who knows if something is wrong and annoys the second young master.I'll have to work hard first.\"I'm so happy that I don't know how to express myself.\" She replied.And they besieged her with many questions, that they might send them all away easily. At night, he Yan was still thinking about it before he collapsed.The reason why she agreed to help Cheng Lishu go to the laoshizi banquet was not because of her deep love with Cheng Lishu and her chivalry, but because she heard the name of Yuan Baozhen.He Yan once met yuan Baozhen. She has to be granted general Feihong. He Rufei receives the reward for her. He Yan has met this man in the he family after he recovers his daughter. Yuan Baozhen was standing with heyuansheng and his son at that time, and Heyan also had a ceremony with him.See he if not with his voice, is also very familiar. He Yan thought at that time that he Rufei had just \"received the reward\". In fact, he did not get close to other colleagues in the court of shuojing. He did not expect to have friends so soon.Now that he Rufei's friend came to Liangzhou, she happened to have a little relationship with \"Cheng Lishu\". If you can take this opportunity to get close to her and inquire about some news about he Rufei, it may be helpful for her future road. If she wants to stand out and get to the position of being heard, she must make contributions in the army. However, Liangzhou is thousands of miles away from the capital, and it is too far away from the he family. Many news can not be transmitted.Yuan Baozhen arrived in Liangzhou, which is also a sleepy pillow. I just don't know what Xiao Jue means, but I can't agree with Cheng Lishu. He Yan can't understand Xiao Jue more and more. He thought he would order himself into the vanguard camp, but he ordered Lei Hou, thinking that he would not let himself pretend to be Cheng Lishu, but he agreed.Nearby came the sound of Hongshan snoring. Heyan turned over and closed his eyes. Since he couldn't think of the result, he could not keep up with him. There was plenty of time to study what Xiao Jue really thought. When soldiers came to cover up the water, she was afraid.\u2026\u2026Different from Heyan's natural and unrestrained, Shen Han looks surprised in the room of Liangzhou garrison. After a while, the surprise on his face becomes anxious.\"Governor, how can you take Heyan to the city? His identity is still unknown, and he will follow you. If he strikes at you... \"\"I am not yet threatened by him.\" Xiao Jue road.\"But...\"The candle in the silver lamp holder on the table was nearly extinguished by the wind. He plucked the wick, and the room brightened again.\"If he belonged to Xu Jingfu, he might show his weakness if he went to the banquet with me this time. It's really strange to put him in the guard station. You may not be able to resist. It's better to put him by my side. \"\"What's more,\" he hooked his lips. \"Heyan boasts his extraordinary skills. This Hongmen banquet can just be used as a kicking brick.\"Shen Han's heart a Lin, Xiao Jue this is to use Heyan as the ghost.If governor Xiao is still the governor of Xiao, he doesn't even read his old love. I don't know how Heyan annoyed Xiao Jue at first. At the thought of this, Shen Han's heart actually gave birth to a trace of sympathy for Heyan.Xiao Jue said: \"after I leave tomorrow, you should protect Cheng Lishu and don't let him run around. I'll leave it to you for the time beingShen Han put away his reverie and said, \"yes!\"\u2026\u2026The next morning, when wheat got up, he found that the bed beside him was empty.He rubbed his eyes. It was still early, and no one else in the room was awake. He Yan's bed, the bedding folded neatly, people have disappeared. Is He Yan gone? But yesterday he didn't say that he only set out at the time of today, but now it's not time.After a while, they all got up and found that he Yan was gone. Hong Shan said: \"this boy will not leave now? Not even a greeting? \"\"Did you leave for fear of waking us up?\" Wheat asked tentatively.\"Who knows, stone, have you seen him?\" Hong Shan asked.Stone also shook his head: \"NoSeveral people look at each other, are confused. Even so, they couldn't wait for Heyan here, and then they got up to wash their faces.The wheat had already put on his clothes. He took the lead in packing them. He pushed the door and ran out to grab hot dry cakes. Shitou and Hongshan were still washing their faces. Suddenly, he heard wheat cry outside: \"brother, brother shange.\"\"What happened?\" Hongshan wiped the water on his face, \"we wash our face.\"\"Come out and see!\" The voice of wheat could not restrain the excitement.Hongshan looked at the stone in wonder. The Stone said he didn't know. He shook the water on his hand and went out of the house. He said, \"wheat, can you not do this next time...\"His voice stopped abruptly.He Yan stood facing him and said with a smile, \"brother Shan, how do I look?\"Hong Shan opened his mouth and did not speak for a moment. The other recruits in the room also came out one after another. Seeing Heyan, \"Hua La\", all around, he said.\"Good looking! It's so beautiful, Heyan. You look like the young master of a rich family in the capital city! \"\"It's not just the young master of a rich family. I don't think it's too much to come out of the palace.\"\"You can pull it down, just as you have seen people coming out of the palace.\"\"I haven't seen it before. I imagine people coming out of the palace look like this!\"\"It's not cheap, Heyan. Can you wear it for me?\"\"Bah! Can you wear it? Don't spoil your clothes, go on the sideHe Yan was surrounded by the crowd, let them look at him. Hongshan several people stood far away, wheat looked at Heyan, his eyes were bright, and said: \"ah he brother is so nice to see!\"\"It's no wonder that people rely on clothes and horses rely on saddles. You see, people don't show mountains and dew on weekdays. When you put on these small clothes and hairpins, they look different from us.\" Hongshan touched his chin and asked the stone, \"isn't it?\"Stone nodded: \"yes.\"He Yan let them look at enough, and then straightened the burden on their shoulders, and said with a smile, \"before leaving, I'd better show you. The brothers say I'm good-looking, so I'm relieved. I haven't lost the face of Liangzhou guards when they say it out.\" She waved. \"Then I'll go.\"The crowd waved goodbye to her.On the other hand, Cheng Lishu also left the door early.Shen Han is talking to Xiao Jue in the yard, and green ear is eating grass with his head down beside him. Cheng Lishu went to the stable last night to pick a lot of beautiful little red horses. He thought that the horses looked lovely and had a good match with him.\"What are you going to do if you don't go?\" Xiao Jue is not sure.\"I don't want to go, but my elder brother is going on behalf of me. We can't let people say behind their backs that the young master of Yousi zhilang's family is not good, although he is good at it. They all say that we should develop our strengths and avoid our weaknesses. I have only one strong point. Of course, I want to raise my strengths. \"Xiao Jue hissed: \"how to do, with your elder brother's appearance, it seems that can't help you develop.\"\"Uncle, what you said is wrong,\" Cheng Lishu looked at him seriously: \"I have read it carefully, my elder brother, the birth should be not bad. Although not comparable to you and me, in Liangzhou Wei, it is also outstanding. \"Shen Han listened to the chatting between the uncle and nephew. He was speechless for a moment. As he was talking, he saw someone coming in front of him and said, \"here comes Heyan!\"The two people who spoke looked at the side of their heads and suddenly felt a light in front of them.Autumn morning, the air is clear, cool, autumn wind blowing, refreshing. The sun has not yet fully come out, only a small head, a line of gold fell on the youth, set off her particularly outstanding.The boy was wearing a dark red cicada brocade robe with a belt around his waist. Usually, she is too thin and frail. She is dressed in Cheng Lishu's clothes, but she completely disappears her frailty. She is only romantic. She was born beautiful. She tied up her long hair with a carved wooden hairpin. She was clean and energetic. She walked at a leisurely pace and carried a burden. She could not see the sweating recruits in the martial arts arena at all. She was free from the charming young people in the Beijing Academy of learning. Every smile was poetic.The young man walked up to several people. \"Pa\" opened the folding fan in her hand. The folding fan was elegant. Her smile was more eye-catching than the landscape painting on the folding fan. Her voice was deliberately lowered: \"sorry, I'm late.\"Cheng Lishu looked at him with wide eyes. After a long time, he finally came back to his senses and turned around Heyan. He was overjoyed and said, \"brother, I didn't expect you to be such a beautiful man. Liangzhou Wei really buried your demeanor! I look at it like this, you're almost catching up with meHe Yan heart proud, mouth or humble way: \"where where where, praise.\"She went to the riverside early this morning and changed her clothes when no one else was around. Most of Cheng Lishu's clothes were yellow. The boy loved such bright colors, but he Yan felt a little frivolous in his clothes. It was easy to find such a color that was not so jumping off, and picked up a simple hairpin in the box. Looking at the river side for a long time, in order to avoid accidents, he also specially showed them to Hongshan.The recruits of Liangzhou Wei applauded unanimously, which is not bad. In her previous life, she had to wear a mask when she was dressed as a man. Now she can look so generous and square, which also gives birth to a strange tension.Shen Han on one side looks at Heyan and takes a breath in his heart. He was still thinking that Heyan was just a teenager. Even if he had an old relationship with Xiao Jue, why did he get into Xiao Jue's eyes? After all, there are countless beautiful women who admire Xiao Jue. Now when I see Heyan like this, I understand a little bit. It's just a woman. It's not common for a man to have such a beautiful appearance. Besides, this young man has outstanding skills and good temperament. If his identity is not questionable, in fact In fact, it is not very strange to stand with governor Xiao.Cheng Lisu is still babbling on and on. Heyan looks at Xiao Jue, but sees Xiao Jue standing in the same place, his eyes calmly sweeping over her, without any appreciation. Suddenly, he feels embarrassed and goes to Xiao Jue.\"Governor,\" she said, folding her fan half open, covering her face with a low smile, and acting like a disciple who molested a good woman, \"what do you think of me like this?\"The young man looked at her indifferently. After a moment, he bent down slightly and bent down to her ear. His voice was lower and hoarse than that of ordinary teenagers. For example, he was getting older this year and had a loose magnetism.\"How could you...\"His ears seemed to be able to feel the heat of the other party's breath. He Yan felt ashamed of his face. He wanted to listen to this face and praise people with this tone. Not everyone could stand it.\u201c\u2026\u2026 It's shorter than Cheng He finished the rest of his speech.He Yan said:He Yan steps back and looks at him incredulously. Shouldn't ordinary people say \"you're so eye-catching\" and \"you're so amazing\"?Shorter than Cheng Lei Su?The beautiful young man seemed to be not bad enough. Looking at her, he hooked his lips and said, \"besides, your belt is on the contrary.\"He brushed his body forward. Heyan looked down and saw that Cheng Lishu's clothes were complicated and complicated. She had never worn them before and didn't know how to tie them. When she heard the reminder, she hurried to solve them. Cheng Lishu saw this, and then he came to help him: \"ah, I forgot to tell you that my belt is different from that of others. You should tie it like this...\"He Yan looked at Xiao Jue's back and grinded his teeth.Xiao Jue could never have made her a substitute for Cheng Lisu because she felt guilty about fighting for the flag. He Yan seriously suspected that he had brought himself with him just for the convenience of humiliation and torture.This is a natural enemy.\u2026\u2026It takes about three hours for Liangzhou garrison to ride a horse without stopping. In the morning, it was afternoon. In addition to Heyan and xiaojue, there was also a bodyguard named feinu.Probably because she was not really Cheng Lishu, she even omitted the carriage. Riding all the way, I didn't even care to eat. In the afternoon, I finally arrived in the city.The last time he came to Liangzhou City, he Yan had just arrived here from shuojing with the recruits. However, he did not stop in the city, so he went directly to the garrison at the foot of Baiyue mountain. Now she changed into ordinary young master's clothes and came to the bustling market. Different from shuojing, Liangzhou has a different style.This is the East, with four distinct seasons. Although it is not as prosperous as the capital, it is also lively. The passers-by was in a hurry. When he got to the city, he didn't have to ride as fast as he could. As he walked, he felt that he could not see enough.But Xiao Jue did not come to visit the city. Several people arrived at an inn, which should be regarded as one of the most luxurious rooms in Liangzhou City, with a total of three floors. The magnificent repair outside, to the door of the inn, Xiao Jue dismounted, the assistant helped to lead the horse to the stable, several people walked into the lobby.To tell you the truth, although Heyan is the eldest young master of he family, he has never lived in a particularly expensive inn. Xiao Jue, like his nephew, was so extravagant and extravagant that he even had to pay attention to his resting place. He Yan thought so, heard Xiao Jue to the shopkeeper's way: \"two guest rooms.\"\"Two rooms?\" He Yan is surprised, \"I and feinu a room?\"It's so easy to get out of the barracks. Can't she have her own? Cheng Lishu also told her to take a bath every day, and feinu was in the room. How would she wash it?\"Otherwise?\" Xiao Jue stares at her and asks, \"do you want to have a room with me?\"\"No, no, no,\" He Yan said, \"then I'd better have a room with feinu.\" Joke, she is not as self-conscious as this. After all, Xiao Er childe is pure and clean. How can she live in the same room with such rude people as her? He Yan's heart Feifei, Xiao two childe should live with the Bodhisattva in the temple, put a censer in front of him for fruit, then he can be worshipped.Xiao Jue ignored him.The shopkeeper took the silver and asked him to clean up the room. Since they haven't had lunch since the morning, they can eat on the first floor of the inn, so they plan to go upstairs after having dinner here.At the table of sesame, chicken and duck, we can see that they are not steamed with five pieces of noodles How many would you likeNot waiting for Xiao Jue to speak, Heyan first asked aloud, \"shopkeeper, can you have mushroom fat chicken?\"\"Yes, yes.\" The shopkeeper replied.Xiao Jue looks at her calmly. He Yan blinked his eyes, \"what's wrong, uncle, you know, my favorite food is mushroom fat chicken!\"Feinu:.... \"Acting should be comprehensive, which Cheng Lishu told her. Now entering Liangzhou City, she is not Heyan. She is Cheng Lishu, the nephew of Xiao Er Gongzi. My nephew wants to eat his favorite dish. Is that wrong?No mistake at all!Xiao Jue took back her eyes and said, \"give him the pan Kou mushroom chicken.\"How nice to talk? He Yan's heart move, is also, if here met acquaintances? In front of outsiders, Xiao Jue is always hard to deny. Since Yan Xiaoli didn't have a chance to kill the sheep, she didn't even have a chance to eat it?\"Uncle!\" He Yan yelled crispy and sweet, and said with a smile, \"I also want to eat spicy shredded tripe, sesame roll, Babao wild duck, shredded chicken and cucumber, steamed gluten with five flavors, five item pigeon What else, mung bean chess face! I want to eat them all! \"Feinu moved his lips and held back what he wanted to say. It was really a long time since he saw such a fearless man.The shopkeeper was surprised at first, then beamed with joy. Looking at Heyan's appearance, he seemed to have seen a god of wealth. He said to Xiao Jue, \"this young master has a good eye. He believes in the dishes of our inn.\"\"I'm sorry,\" Xiao Jue chuckled, elegant, but with a kind of sarcastic tone, he said: \"nephew has never seen the world, let people laugh.\"He Yan said:\"Have a copy of everything.\"Xiao ER was so extravagant that the shopkeeper was overjoyed. He turned and ordered the kitchen to cook.He Yan was just trying to make fun of him. He thought it would be nice to eat some of the dishes. He never thought that Xiao Jue would be obedient and ordered every kind of food. Is Cheng Lishu so popular in front of this uncle? He Yan was jealous of the wind and rain.She approached Xiao Jue and asked cautiously, \"governor, why are you so good at talking?\"\"What?\" Xiao Jue light way: \"when uncle, of course can't let nephew hungry.\"This \"Uncle\" is really meaningful. He Yan pondered and pondered, but he thought out a bit of wrong taste. She and Xiao Jue were of the same generation. She was a classmate before and a general later. As a result, she became Xiao Jue's little soldier and called him governor. Now he has simply become Xiao Jue's nephew, even his seniority is short.Xiao Jue has taken advantage of it!She was silent and did not intend to call Xiao Jue any more. Who knows want to make fun of Xiao Jue unexpectedly let oneself suffer a loss? It's a poor chess game.The shopkeeper's dishes, however, are quite fast. After a while, the dishes are served and the whole table is filled. So extravagant, the people nearby looked at them.He Yan felt a little embarrassed and said, \"governor, let you spend money.\"\"If you want to eat, of course.\" Xiao Jue said slowly and leisurely, \"it's just that I've taught you before. If you're simple, you'll be prosperous; if you're lost, you'll die. Don't waste it. \"He Yan is aware of a trace of error, was about to speak, only heard the man in front of him said: \"there is a grain of rice left, you don't eat tomorrow.\"He Yan said:www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if it is a delicacy, it is difficult to swallow in the end. It's so easy to eat. After getting the right to eat tomorrow, Mr. Xiao also glanced at him and said, \"it's as good as a man.\".If he hadn't said that he couldn't waste it, would she have been able to do this in full view of the public? Other diners looked at her in the wrong way, and he Yan felt ashamed.She was so full that she didn't want to talk to Xiao Jue more, so she went upstairs with the assistant. Fei Nu didn't follow her. She was too lazy to take care of it. As soon as she entered the house, she lay down on the collapse.This is really, can't walk.He Yan felt soft and comfortable under his body. He Yan couldn't help rolling on the collapse. So it's good to have money. He enjoys living when he goes out. Xiao Jue's room is next door. She sticks up her ears against the wall to hear what Xiao Jue is doing there. She doesn't know if the wall is too thick to hear anything.Listen, listen, Heyan fell asleep.I've been on the road for a long time today, but I've come back with enough food and drink. The bed is so comfortable that it's hard for me to sleep. This sleep, Heyan wake up, the sun has completely set, the moon came out. She opened the window, lanterns were lit downstairs, and there were singing girls in the restaurant not far away.He Yan rubbed his eyes, drank a glass of water, got up and pushed the door open. He went to Xiao Jue's room and knocked on the door.A moment later, there was humanity in the room: \"come in.\"He Yan walks in, lights the room, and feinu guards the door. Xiao Jue sits at the table, reading with a book in his hand.Is this person not sleepy? At the beginning, I didn't see him working so hard in Xianchang hall, but now he is working hard. He Yan's feeling of shame arises spontaneously. Look at it. This is the endless learning. She craned her neck to see what kind of book Xiao Jue was reading. She saw that the man closed the book and could not see anything.He raised his eyes, his eyes were cold, \"what's the matter?\"He Yan said, \"governor, what do you do at night?\"\"Nothing.\"\"Are you not going out?\"He said, \"what do you want to say?\"\"I want to say,\" He Yan smiles, \"if you have nothing to do, I want to go out and have a look. I'm also the first time I've been to Liangzhou city to see if there are any interesting gadgets around me, \"she quipped.\" if you meet the right one, buy some and take it back to my fiancee. \"Xiao Jue seems not interested in her things, light way: \"as you.\"He Yan was overjoyed and said, \"that's great. Governor, I'll go first.\"She almost jumped downstairs. After she left, Xiao Jue said, \"flying slave.\"The bodyguard already understood and said, \"young master, I will follow him.\"\"Don't get too close,\" he said. \"Be careful you're found.\"\"I understand.\"\u2026\u2026He Yanxing rushed out of the door.Yuan Baozhen has not yet arrived in Liangzhou. In the next few days, they live in an inn. They come to the city ahead of time and don't tell the county magistrate that Xiao Jue has to deal with other things besides practicing Qin. However, he Yan does not intend to follow, at least to the present, Xiao Jue can not trust her meaning, why hot face stick cold butt. She did not want to read in the inn like Xiao Jue, which would make her think of the terrible memories when she was studying in Xianchang hall.The night was just right, so I took advantage of this time to walk around. Although Yuanbao town has not yet arrived in Liangzhou, it is not the only way to know the news about the he family. Where there is a tavern and teahouse, just shout \"I know general Feihong recently...\" It can lead to countless conversations. It's not her boasting. In her most famous years, storytellers in many places have been talking about general Feihong's books every day.Of course, we should also talk about general Feng Yun.In the night of Liangzhou City, there are not as many people on the street as in shuojing, but it is not cold. Roadside vendors also sell local products here. As he walked along, he Yan saw that she only had a ding of silver she got when fighting for the flag.Although Xiao Jue was her \"Uncle\", she didn't mean to give her money. Fortunately, Heyan was full of food and drink at this time. He didn't want to spend money, so he just looked at it and didn't want to buy it.A dozen paces behind her, feinu was following closely.Xiao Jue suspects that he Yan's identity is different. When he brings her to Liangzhou City, he should keep an eye on her to see if she secretly contacts Xu Jingfu's people. Feinu followed with all due diligence, but there is still a trace of wonder.This young man, walking all the way to see, with did not come out to stroll the street in general, very novel. He said that he wanted to buy trinkets for his fiancee, but he didn't buy any. Either he is a miser, even a box of fat and powder are reluctant to give the girl. Either he's lying. It's just a cover up.He Yan turns a street and walks into an alley. Feinu remembers Xiao Jue's words and doesn't dare to follow him too close. When he gets to the end of the lane, he turns in. He is stunned when he enters. In the empty alley, only a few lanterns are hanging in the wind. Where is there any human shadow?Feinu's heart was bad, so he quickly stepped forward to the end of the lane. At the end of the alley was a road, and there were crowds around. He didn't see the young man.When he was found out, he clenched his hands, not only that, but also lost him.He Yan swung his sleeve and went straight ahead.Liangzhou city doesn't look peaceful, and there are a lot of gangsters. She was a new comer and was followed up before she stepped on the land. The other side followed her all the way. She didn't offend anyone now. Most of them wanted to take advantage of the fire. But now she is still staring at Cheng Lishu's identity, Xiao Jue is still in the inn, or not to cause trouble. It is because she did not start, even did not face to face with each other, just quietly left behind the people.Without the tail, you can walk more easily. He Yan stopped a passer-by in the street and said with a smile, \"brother, do you know where the biggest pub in the city is?\"The man looked at her up and down. He saw that he Yan was well-off and looked extraordinary. He estimated the young master of a rich family, and his tone was particularly good. He said, \"the biggest tavern is Wanhua Pavilion.\"\"Thank you very much,\" He Yan asked again, \"can you tell me how to get to Wanhua pavilion\"It's not far. You go straight down this street, and at the end, you can see a rice shop. Turn left and you can see it not far away.\"\"Thank you very much, brother.\" He Yan arched his hand again, and then walked forward with a smile on his face.It's exactly the same as what the man said just now. After walking along the left side of the rice shop, you can hear the sound of playing pipa. There are many rich and well-to-do young masters are going to the other end, needless to say, naturally it is the Wanhua Pavilion.He Yan also walked along the people.Before she got to the door, she felt the gusts of fragrant wind coming, and he Yan's step was a little strange. At this time, a group of red fragrance rushed to her eyes, and the snow-white lotus root arms climbed onto her shoulder. The woman's smile was a little provocative, \"young master, is it the first time to come to our Wanhua pavilion?\"He Yan said:Wasn't she asking about the biggest pub? Can anyone tell her why the Wanhua Pavilion mentioned by that person is actually a brothel!He Yan said, \"I'm not here.\" She tried to pull the girl's hand off. However, the girl was not angry. On the contrary, she stuck it more tightly. Heyan's arm touched a soft ball, and she was embarrassed.Even if they are both women, this is really too close!The girl in red took Heyan in her arms and walked in, saying, \"if you're not here, you can come in and have a look. We have a wonderful time in Wanhua Pavilion. \"The other party was a woman, and he could not deal with Wang Jiugui. He Yan had no choice but to say, \"girl, I don't have any money. I'm poor.\"The woman glanced at her dress from head to toe, and chuckled and said, \"you can really talk and laugh. You can't be so stingy. If you are really stingy, you will have nothing to do. Would you like to invite Mr. Yun Yan to drink wine today without collecting money? \"Her body of incense heavy pungent, smoked Heyan dizzy, a inattention, was called Yunyan woman into the Wanhua Pavilion. As soon as I went in, I felt warm and fragrant. The young women on the stage were wearing thin clothes and were playing the piano and singing. A group of young men and literati sat under the stage and cheered and presented couplets.There were people everywhere. He Yan had not seen such a scene for a long time. He stopped for a moment and didn't know where to go. Seeing this, Yunyan covered her mouth, chuckled and pulled Heyan's arm. \"Young master, let's go upstairs. There are too many people here. The young master is so beautiful. I'm afraid someone will rob him.\" After that, he also touched a hand on his face.He Yan only felt a cold, like a rabbit into the wolf cave, all over the body are uncomfortable. This cloud Yan but is a fire of enthusiasm, where also see he Yan's face, pull He Yan to go upstairs.There are several floors in Wanhua Pavilion. The bottom floor is Changtai, where girls from brothels play songs and dances. At the top is the elegant room, which requires more money for entertaining distinguished guests. Up there, that's where the girls live.Yunyan is not so good-looking in Wanhua Pavilion, and there are not many benefactors to take care of her. It's so easy to catch such a rich young master as Heyan at the door today. It's not easy to let go. He Yansheng is also beautiful. If he is seen by other girls, he will inevitably come to rob him. There are more monks and less clergymen. Of course, it's better to lock them in their own rooms.She has been holding Heyan, he Yan ponders how to get away naturally. When she gets upstairs, he no longer sees the benefactor holding the girl.\"There's no one up there?\" He Yan asked.Yun Yan said with a smile: \"not everyone can enter a girl's boudoir, young master, don't want to get cheap and sell well.\"The girls here are fierce and bold. He Yan doesn't know how to parry. Passing by a room, suddenly, the door was opened, and a man with loose hair rushed out and rushed to the door. Then he was grabbed by someone and dragged his hair back. He Yan had not had time to look carefully, the door \"bang\" was closed, almost hit her nose, her fan also to fly.All this happened so fast that he Yan was stunned for a moment. Yun Yan rushed forward and asked, \"are you ok? Did you get hurt just nowHe Yan shook his head, bent down to pick up the fan, and then looked at the closed door. Her ear strength was extraordinary. She heard the woman's cry faintly from inside, and then there was the voice of a mother's scolding.\"Here...\" He Yan reached out to push the door.\"You can't!\" Yun Yan stopped his action, \"what do you do?\" There was a trace of precaution in his eyes.He Yan thought of a move, and then raised his eyes, the eyes are completely curious, \"who is this inside? What was it just doing? \"In the end, it was the first time that she came to the brothel. She didn't know anything. A trace of scorn passed through Yun Yan's heart, but she laughed and took Heyan's arm. \"It's the new girl in our building. She didn't understand the rules and ran into the guests. Mammy is teaching her.\"\"Are there any girls in your building who don't know the rules?\" He Yan said quietly: \"I thought they were as understanding as a girl.\"He said, \"you are so sweet. We grew up in the brothel, do not understand the rules, do not eat, naturally dare not bump into guests. However, some people are different. They are born without any setbacks. When they meet with great changes, they think that they are still the former Miss. They are arrogant and willful, and always have to suffer a lot. Eat a few more times and you'll understand. \"He Yan raised eyebrows: \"it turns out to be a good family.\"\"Childe,\" Yunyan pretended to be angry, and gently hammered Heyan's chest with a powder fist, and said, \"so you can't look up to our brothel girls?\"He Yan low smile: \"how can? Compared with a wild cat with claws, of course, it's a clever girl who is more painfulShe was born beautiful, dressed in Cheng Lishu's gorgeous clothes, and she looked like a graceful young man. If she was more casual and romantic, she could charm a large number of young women. Sure enough, Yunyan was also a little shaken by her smile, and more unconsciously.\"Nevertheless, some people like this kind of wild cat with spleen. Although the people in this room don't know the rules, now the young master of Liangzhou county magistrate's house wants her by name. I don't know where it came from. \" At this point, there is a sense of jealousy.\"The young master of the magistrate's house?\" He Yan's heart turned a thousand times, and his expression did not see half a loophole. He looked at her in surprise: \"the color of the people in this room is so moving that even the magistrate is attracted by his name?\"\"Why do you come here in admiration?\" Yunyan did not think so. \"This girl just came to our building. Her mother asked her to receive a guest, and she picked up Mr. Sun. Who knows she is very good. She not only doesn't serve him, but also stabs him in the arm with a hairpin.\"\"Mr. Sun is the only son of Sunzhi county. How can we just let it go? Let her mother train the girl for a few days, and when she is obedient, she will send her away. \"As she walked forward, she said, \"it's just that this girl has backbone. It's been three days. You see, it's still the same. We haven't seen such a strong girl in the Wanhua Pavilion for a long time.\"\"What can I do?\" He Yan shook his fan and worried: \"if the training is not good, how can you communicate with Mr. Sun?\"\"Young master, there are no bad girls in Wanhua Pavilion. No matter how strong the girl is, you can't do anything if you drink some overpowering drugs. I think this girl is also asking for trouble. If she is obedient and coax young master sun, she may be able to be a concubine's room. Now, even if it's the fall of young master sun, I'm afraid it's hard for him to please him. I don't know how miserable it will be. \"She said, jealous and sympathetic.\"Maybe she'll figure it out these days.\" He Yan comforts, \"also need not worry too much.\"Yun Yan shook her head: \"I'm afraid there's no time. Soon, Mr. Sun's people will come to meet him. Just now I think it's putting on makeup. \"He Yan did not speak.Yunyan also seemed to realize that she had said too much, and then she showed her sweet smile at the beginning. She took Heyan to a room at the end and pushed him in: \"look, how can you and I talk about other people's affairs? Young master, why don't you come and talk about us? \"This is a woman's boudoir. It is not very big. There are some rouge, water powder and lotus red curtains on the dressing table. I suddenly feel that the spring night is short and bitter.She put her arms around Heyan's neck again.He Yan's scalp was numb, but he still had to be a romantic young master's posture on his face. He said with a smile, \"a beautiful woman is in her arms. Naturally, it's good. But don't you think there's something missing?\"\"What's missing?\" Yun Yan asked\"Good wine, of course. The girl and I are as good as before at first sight. In this situation, we should have a drink. \" She thought about the scene when he Yuanliang was playing with his aunts in the mansion, and nodded Yunyan's nose, \"aren't you going to invite me to drink? Are you lying to meThe handsome young man flirts with himself. Even if she is a happy girl, she can't help but feel her heart fluttering. Yunyan stomps her feet and says, \"how can you? You wait, I'll get the wine now, tonight I'll be drunk with you. \"She winked, twisted her waist and went out. He Yan waited for her to go, a buttock sits on the chair, this just was relieved. Learning men to go to brothels, both in the past and now, is what she is extremely bad at. It's killing her. It's more terrible than going to Xianchang hall to study.She swung her sleeve again, from which she rolled out a small ball of paper.Just passing by the room, someone suddenly rushed out of the room and was caught back. In that very short time, a paper ball was thrown out. At that time, she was afraid of being discovered by Yunyan, so she threw her fan down and covered the paper ball. When he bent down to pick up the fan, he picked up the paper ball again.All the way for fear of being discovered by Yunyan, only now dare to take it out. The paper was crumpled and scattered. He Yan unfolded it and saw two words on it.Help me.The handwriting is written in Meidai, which is a little fuzzy. The writer should be very nervous. Even so, it can be seen that the small script with hairpin flower is particularly beautiful.There's a girl in the room.Although Yun Yan's high sounding, can be said in the end, there are no more than four words, forcing a good man into a prostitute. She is now following Xiao Jue. She shouldn't have been in charge of these things. She has been worried since she knew about it. It's hard to stand by.He Yan put the paper ball away again, stood up, pushed the door and left.When Yunyan came back with the wine, the room had already been empty. She stayed for a long time, stamped her feet and scolded, \"liar!\"\u2026\u2026The night grew deeper and deeper.The singing in Wanhua Pavilion is more and more provocative and ambiguous. It's hard to say whether it's a play or a true love.The moon here is not as clear as it was when it was in the garrison. It was probably because there was no back mountain and river. It was a little less broad-minded and a little more blurred.In the teahouse opposite the Wanhua Pavilion, the young man in royal clothes is sitting drinking tea.He Yan picked a button from Cheng Lishu's clothes. This button is also inlaid with gold. Heyan bought a cup of tea with this button, the cheapest one.The owner of the teahouse probably hasn't seen such a splendid dress, but she wants to pay with buttons. She looks at her with a kind of unspeakable look. She just says, \"brother, you'd better keep the button by yourself. This cup of tea is for you, no silver.\"He Yan said Thank you very much She also gave Shi ran the button to Chuai good, thinking that after a while, she would sew Cheng Lishu back. Why is it after a while, of course, because she has to go to the street these days, in case she wants to drink tea? I have to pull it a second time after I sew it.If Cheng Lishu knew he Yan had such an idea, he would regret lending her clothes.The deeper the night is, the more lively the Wanhua Pavilion is. The more guests come to the pavilion, and few of them return home. Warm fragrance nephrite in the heart, nature lingers. At this time, someone came out of the ten thousand Flower Pavilion and saw it very clearly.A carriage stopped in front of the Wanhua Pavilion.Two fat moms helped a woman out, and the woman half reclined on one of them, as if drunk. He Yan fixed his eyes on it. It was not so much the two mothers who helped her walk, but rather that it was holding her.This is probably the brave girl whom Yunyan said was favored by sun.The strong girl was put into the carriage, which took her away. In addition to the coachman, there were two bodyguards following, just like an escort. He Yan spat in the heart, which is really open to people as goods.She put down the tea cup in her hand and followed it quietly.There were not many lanterns on the street in Liangzhou City, and the night was very deep. He Yan felt that the carriage was almost integrated with the long night.The two guards sat on the ruts of the carriage, talking.\"I'm quite obedient today. I don't say a word.\"\"After entering Wanhua Pavilion, is there any good fruit to eat? This girl is also too ignorant of the current affairs. If she had been obedient earlier, why should she suffer from such torture? \"\"Didn't she say she was a lady of a big family? It's not unusual to think about it. But it's just like this. The young master doesn't like her. After tonight, maybe you and I will be cheaper. \"They looked at each other and laughed obscenely.Just then, suddenly, the carriage fell forward and almost didn't knock them down. One of them scolded: \"Hello! What's going on? \" And raise your head.But there was a man sitting under the low eaves. He was dressed in royal robes, with his hair tied, and half of his face covered with a sweat towel. He only showed a pair of eyes, which seemed to be smiling. He could not see clearly because of the dim night. He was throwing stones up and down in his hand, and the reason why the carriage stopped now was that a stone had cut the wheel and the car couldn't move.\"Who are you?\" The guard got out of the carriage and yelled.\"Are you out of your mind?\" The man spoke in a low voice, but he couldn't hide his arrogance. He pointed to himself, \"I'm dressed like this. Of course, it's robbery.\"Robbery?In broad daylight, no, well, it's dark and windy now, but in Liangzhou City, I haven't heard this word for a long time. What's important is that there are still people in Liangzhou who dare to rob them?\"I think you are impatient to live!\" The guard sneered, \"do you know who we are?\"\"Yes.\" The man said lazily, \"prefect Sun family, Sun family.\"\"I know you dare...\"\"I dare!\" His words were interrupted, the next moment, but saw the man from the eaves, rushed.At the moment, the coach had already lost his way, and no one was scared to run away. However, the two guards could not stop at this point. All of a sudden, the three men were entangled in each other.The sound outside seemed to disturb the people in the carriage, and there was a rustle in the carriage. The people inside seemed to think of it. He Yan said in a high voice: \"stay inside, don't move!\"All of a sudden, the sound disappeared and did not move again. One of the guards seemed to realize, \"you are her lover! Well, what about robbery? You are a group\"The brains of your grandchildren are all made of paste.\" He Yan exclaimed, a punch hit his face, beat him to the ground, half a day can not get up.Another man rushed over with a knife. Unfortunately, his strength was enough for ordinary people, but not enough for Heyan. He Yan smiles and holds his wrist. The man can only make a scream. The knife in his hand falls in response to the sound. He Yan kicks him a few meters away.Although the two men were said to be the guards of sun, he Yan didn't realize how good they were. Maybe I just came out to pick up people. I sent two people randomly. Who would have thought that in the sun family's territory, there are people who are so bold and fearless to cut off Hu?She bent down and picked up the knife that had just fallen off the ground.The two guards were beaten and had no strength to fight back. Seeing the masked man approaching step by step, he subconsciously retreated. A man said, \"if you have something to say, don't be impulsive, great Xia? Great XiaThis is a soft talker, but there is another person who has no fear. He just doesn't know whether he is fierce or not. He sneers at Heyan and says, \"Stinky boy, you are brave enough to move the people of the sun family. You know, tonight you cut people, tomorrow it's your turn, you You're in big troubleHe Yan didn't look at them. He approached step by step. When both of them turned pale, he slashed the rope connecting the carriage and the horse.\"Will I be afraid?\"Then she reached out and pulled the man out of the carriage. The woman was drugged, unable to move at all, staring at Heyan.He Yan put her on the horse and rode up with him. With a whip, he quickly disappeared in the night.www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After a long time, he Yan stopped the horse.This is an empty market, and now the peddlers have already gone home. The strong-natured girl had been shaking since she got on the carriage. At the moment, it seemed that the medicine was a little too strong to speak. She was soft and had no strength to say, \"let me go.\"He Yan helped her off the horse and sat down at the door of a tofu shop.Just now I was in a hurry, and I didn't really see what the girl was like. Now, with the faint lantern light hanging under the eaves of the tofu shop, it was clear that the girl was really beautiful. It is delicate and soft, white and tender, with delicate eyebrows. It is just that some of the cheeks are chubby, and they look childish. They should be young. At most, they are similar to Cheng Lishu.Just like this little girl, she was dressed up by the people of Wanhua Pavilion. She was dressed in inappropriate Tulle clothes, heavily made-up and shivered with cold.As soon as she sat down, the girl shrank back and looked at Heyan warily: \"who are you?\"He Yan was stunned for a moment, and then returned to his mind, thinking that the girl was about to recognize himself as a philanderer. He pulled off his face towel and said with a smile, \"don't be afraid. I'm here to save you. It was just inconvenient to show up just now, so I covered my face with a cloth towel. Didn't scare you? \"Under the moonlight, the young man who pulled off the cloth towel has a beautiful eyebrow and a soft voice, which makes people gradually put down their guard.\"How do you know...\" She still had some difficulty in speaking. Heyan felt a paper ball from his sleeve: \"this one you threw out was picked up by me. I've heard about the business of forcing good men into prostitutes in Wanhua Pavilion. I've been hiding in the teahouse next to Wanhua Pavilion, and I'll take your carriage with you all the way. \"He Yan looked at the girl: \"are you ok? They didn't hurt you, did they? \"It's OK not to say that. As soon as she said this, the girl's eyes suddenly turned red. She held out her hand trembling, but she saw that her ten fingers were so swollen that she didn't know what it was.Even if the girls in the brothel, especially the new comers, don't know the rules and the lessons to be learned, the mother will not use the method that will leave traces on her body. After all, the girl still wants to go out to entertain guests. If her body is blue and purple, and the guest's appetite is knocked down, the gain is not worth the loss. Therefore, he came up with such a torturing method.He Yan looked at some heartache, whose daughter was so spoiled, parents would be heartbroken. She softened her voice a little bit and asked, \"girl, where is your home? Take me home first. \"\"Home?\" The girl was stunned for a moment and looked at Heyan. After a long time, she replied, \"my family is in shuojing...\"\"Shuojing?\" This next turn He Yan is stunned, \"are you abducted?\"\"I think so.\" The little girl said: \"I was, I was escaping from marriage. I wanted to go to Yangzhou, but I made a mistake and came to Liangzhou. I just wanted to stay in Liangzhou for a few days, but I didn't expect to be seen by sun Ling.\" She hated: \"if I go back to shuojing, I will see them well!\" At the end of the day, almost gnashing one's teeth.He Yan said ... \"the little girl is too brave to look at her. How dare you run from shuojing to Liangzhou? What's the matter? Nowadays, young girls in Beijing are in favor of escaping marriage, aren't they? Cheng Lishu is like this, and so is this little girl at present.He Yan said, \"are you here alone? Is there anyone you know in Liangzhou, where you can settle down? \"The little girl shook her head.He Yan is also in trouble. Such a big man, should he take her back to the inn. Xiao Jue should not have killed herself, although in a few days they will go to the house of Sunzhi County for a banquet, although she just intercepted a person from the son of Sunzhi County tonight.The little girl seemed to see he Yan's embarrassment. She sat up with difficulty, and she had backbone. She bit her lips and said, \"you You don't have to worry about me. I'll just hide myself next. Your great kindness, when I return to shuojing, I will let my parents repay you. Whatever you want, gold and silver jewelry, luxury house, beauty, you can. What's your name? I'll go back and... \"\"Little girl, you are now difficult to protect yourself,\" He Yan Fu forehead, \"can you walk out of Liangzhou city is hard to say, don't mention so far things.\"\"So what?\" The other side avoided her eyes and said with red eyes, \"I won't ask you anyway.\"All the young masters and young ladies from shuojing are full of temper. Heyan thought that being strong is a good thing, but it's not so good just after easy folding. If Cheng Lishu was here, he could bend and stretch. If he entered Wanhua Pavilion, he would be able to avoid a lot of flesh and blood.He Yan pulled her up: \"let's go?\"\"To where?\"\"To me, of course. This girl, \"He Yan said helplessly,\" I just robbed you. I think that after a while, young master sun will search the whole city for your trace. In such a big night, you have nowhere to go. In the end, you are not found by sun Ling. He will only torture you even more. I have worked hard all night. Is this the result? \"The little girl had no strength. She was held on by Heyan and hesitated: \"if you take me home, it will bring you trouble. The sun family covers the sky with one hand in Liangzhou. You... \"The little girl's heart pour is menerqing, he Yan drives a horse way: \"you don't worry, my home is in big Wei still only hand covers the sky.\"If you can't, I'll move Xiao Jue out. Mr. Xiao can't cover the sky with one hand in the Wei Dynasty.He Yan asked: \"forget to ask you, what's your name?\"\"My name is Pottery. \" She said.Pottery? The name sounds familiar. It seems that he heard it somewhere. He Yan thought about it carefully, but he couldn't remember it. Now the situation is urgent, and it's not the time to make such a fuss. Wait for Tao Tao Tao to be sent back to the inn. After tonight, I'll ask you carefully.\u2026\u2026Heyan did not grow up in Liangzhou City, nor did he know the road of Liangzhou city. Fortunately, she was used to recording the way, and found the inn when she came. For fear of finding sun Ling's horse here, far in front of the inn, he dismounted with Tao Tao Tao, patted the horse's buttocks in the opposite direction, and watched the horse run into the night.The second young master Xiao is very good at choosing the inn. It's not as lively and quiet as the area of Wanhua Pavilion before. At this moment, there are almost no people at night. When Heyan helped Tao Tao up the stairs, there was no one downstairs. She opened the door and found that Fei Nu was not there. She was relieved.There was water in the room. He Yan said, \"wash your face first. I have some clean clothes here. You can change them. You can't wear this on you. You'll catch cold She put a large pile of clothes that Cheng Lishu gave him and put them in Tao Tao's hand. \"You can choose what you like to wear.\"Tao Tao looked at her and blushed, \"you go out.\"He Yan then remembered that he was a man now, and said, \"OK, I'll go out. I'll watch at the door. You can change your mind.\"Xiao, don't want to shut her head outside the house.The light in the room has gone out. I wonder if Xiao Jue is asleep. He Yan said softly, \"Dudu, Dudu?\"No one responded. She reached out and knocked on the door again. No one answered. He Yan stood up straight, hesitated for a moment, and opened the door.The windows in the room were not closed, and the wind was leaking in. Looking at the moonlight, the bed was neat, and no one had ever slept. Xiao Jue is no longer here, nor is the drink autumn sword he put on the table. The man kept the sword in his hand. I think he went out.He Yan also noticed that on the small table next to him, there was the familiar evening fragrance lute. He Yan skimmed his lips, and his heart was filled with anger. He said that he came to practice the piano. In fact, he must be doing something confidential in Liangzhou city. Feinu is not here. The master and servant must have gone out on business. They don't take her at all. They just don't trust her.Although Xiao Jue had known for a long time that Xiao Jue didn't trust him and that it was reasonable, he Yan still felt a little uncomfortable. Anyway, they were classmates. They had known each other for so many years. When they went out to work, she would not tell anyone else! It's stingy.She withdrew from Xiao Jue's room and closed the door for him again.At that end, Tao Tao had already changed his clothes. He pushed the door open and saw he Yan. He bowed his head and said, \"I've changed it.\"He Yan pushed her forward, \"hush\" a, \"walls have ears, come in and say.\"She turned on the light in the room, and Tao Tao changed Cheng Li Su's clothes, which made her look more beautiful. Cheng Lisu's clothes are mostly bright colors. The long robe of Xiang color is worn on the girl's body, which makes the little girl more white and beautiful. Her eyes were still red, and her hair was spread over her shoulders. She was as good as the snow-white rabbit he had seen before. At first sight, she was a girl who had been raised by a rich family.\"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that, but you have such a bad taste in clothes.\" When the rabbit talks, it's not so cute. Tao Tao frowned, pointing to a carp on his clothes, \"it's really vulgar.\"He Yan said:This young lady, when is it that she still wants to observe clothes? Is it true that all the young ladies from shuojing are like this? He Yan thought that he was not like this before. She coughed softly and said, \"at present, if you have to, Miss Tao Tao has to slow down the matter of clothes first.\"She handed Cheng Lishu a box of hairpins: \"first choose one that you don't think is so gaudy. Tie up your hair. Now you can't dress up as a woman.\"\"Why?\" Tao Tao is puzzled.\"Sun Ling should send someone to search for women who look like you in the whole city. We are not immune. \"Tao Tao smelled the speech and became nervous, \"what should I do?\"\"Don't worry, I'll try to get them away. It's so late. Haven't you eaten yet? I have some dry food on the road. I'll ask the inn to make some hot food for you tomorrow morning. There is still tea here. If it's cold, you can help yourself. \"Tao Tao felt hungry just after touching his stomach. He went to pour the tea in the teapot. He Yan sighed in his heart. If this girl is really simple, she is still so easy to believe others when she passes through the Wanhua Pavilion. If she had not met her own, she would have been abducted by someone who had evil intentions. If she had not cheated, she would have given medicine in the tea without any trouble.In those years, although he left the Hejia alone, he followed the Fuyue army and was not so dangerous. This world, for women, is always more difficult.She thought to herself that she wanted to hide it from Xiao Jue, but now Xiao Jue and Fei Nu are not here, so it's not easy to do it. Originally, she planned that if sun Ling's people came to the door and Xiao Jue was there, she would not go into the house to look up people. Now that the Buddha is gone and Xiao Jue's name is taken out, others may think she is lying.I can only expect Xiao Jue to come back earlier. He Yan never found that he had been looking forward to the return of Mr. Xiao for a moment.Tao Tao casually ate a few dry cakes, drank a cup of tea, and then said, \"no more.\" From the expression of her disgusted wrinkled nose, this \"no eating\" is definitely not because she is full, but not to her taste.She sat down at the table, tied her hair in front of the bronze mirror, combed it for a moment, then turned around and said, \"OK!\"He Yan felt thirsty at the moment. He took a cup of tea and almost didn't spray the tea. The child's hair was so tangled up that it looked as if he had just come back. She couldn't help asking, \"you Is it a tie? \"\"They didn't comb their heads in the mansion before. They were all groomed by servant girls.\" The little girl was very aggrieved and threw the comb, \"I can't!\"He Yan said:She had no choice but to go over and pick up the comb with a good temper and said, \"no, it won't be. I'll help you if I get angry.\"After that, he really held Tao Tao's long hair in his hand and combed her hair once and for all.Tao Tao is stunned. The young man in the bronze mirror is gentle and handsome. She can't help asking, \"do you even know this?\"\"Just try a few more times.\" He Yan answers with a smile.She has been the eldest master of the he family for many years, but the change of her identity is unknown to all but the second room of the family. Therefore, he Yan's servants and servants should never be too close to her. Even if you tie up your hair, you may get sunken. So he Yan from a very young age, began to bundle his hair.It's not just a haircut, but anything that might reveal a secret, she has to do it on her own. As time goes by, they also develop a kind of disposition of doing everything personally. Although I sometimes envy those young masters and girls who are held in the palm of my hand, I think, for example, when I meet this kind of thing today, she won't cry. For many things, she has a lot of confidence on her own.After the hair was tied, he Yan blackened her face and roughened her eyebrows. She has been very good at dressing up as a man. After making up, Tao Tao looks at herself in the mirror and says, \"thank you very much You are a good craftsman. \"He Yan clapped his hands, \"practice makes perfect. Miss Tao Tao, turn your back and I'll have to change my clothes. \"\u2026\u2026The city of Liangzhou is really lively tonight.Someone actually robbed the carriage of young master sun in a place not far from the house of Sun Zhi county. The man in the carriage was a concubine newly accepted by young master sun. For a moment, the government of Liangzhou was flying and swearing to catch the thief.\"Young master, young master, that man is clearly her lover!\" The guard, who had just received a blow from Heyan, is kneeling on the ground and yelling, \"they are a group, and they deliberately rob her!\"\"She's not from Liangzhou at all. Where did she come from?\" Sun Ling kicked in the past, \"fool!\"Sun Ling is now in his thirties and has achieved nothing. He lives by pointing to his county magistrate's father and bullying men and women in Liangzhou city. He gave birth to a rabbit head with a black birthmark on its cheek, which was even more terrifying. There were countless concubines in his family, and countless good women who had been bullied and humiliated by him. The people of Liangzhou dare not to speak up and allow his father and son to cover the sky in the city.Today, she was intercepted on her way home. The woman's business is small, and her disgrace is great. For sun Ling, this is naked and she doesn't pay attention to their grandchildren!\"Now the gate is closed.\" Another guard said, \"the woman was injured and should still be in the city. Door to door, you can always find the whereabouts! \"\"Fool,\" Sun Ling scolded again, \"when are the people in Liangzhou so bold that they dare to break ground on Tai Sui's head! Since you say that person knows it's my sun Ling's person and dares to do it, he is naturally a person who knows nothing about life and death. Most of them are not from Liangzhou. \"\"That woman is not from Liangzhou. They may be in a group.\" The former guard said again.\"No matter whether he is a group or not, if he dares to fight against my sun family, he must be prepared to die or die! What did the man look like, you repeat\"He was blindfolded and could not see what he looked like. He is about seven feet shorter than me. He is thin and thin, but he is very rich and expensive. The material of his clothes is not ordinary \"In a word, it should not be the poor.\"Sun Ling thought for a moment and said, \"I know.\"The two guards looked at him.\"The people in the city continue to block the city gate, and the rest of the big head, follow me to check the inn!\"\"Inn? Young master, why is this? \"Sun Ling scolded: \"a fool is a fool. I don't want to think about it. Since most people are not from Liangzhou, they are staying in the inn! You said that the man was well-dressed and could not live in a humble inn. Would you look for those good and expensive Inns\"So it is,\" two guards quickly praised: \"young master wise, young master wise!\"\"Hum,\" Sun Ling said with a proud smile, and the birthmark on his cheek became more terrible. He measured: \"in Liangzhou City, I haven't seen such a person who is not afraid of death. I'd like to see who is so bold. And that slut, I really don't know how much I'm doing. I'm afraid I don't know what I'm doing\"Don't let go of any of them!\"\u2026\u2026The night in the city seems to be illuminated by torches. It was supposed to be the time to sleep. Every household was awakened by the sound of horse hooves. The Yamen and the city guards rushed into the civilian's houses and investigated them in turn.It should not be, but it is not a day or two for the sun family to abuse their private rights. Hearing that sun Ling's concubine was taken away, many people scolded him secretly.\"Bah, nonsense. Where did the concubine come from? Even if you don't look up to her, she must be an innocent girl. What's the difference between this kind of behavior and a robber? The robbers have to choose to start at night. Who dares to rob so openly\"But isn't he taken away? It's a righteous man who can't look down on it\"If you are really a righteous man, I will pray for his safety and health in front of the Bodhisattva every day. Don't be caught by someone surnamed sun!\"\"Well, the world has changed.\"Naturally, these voices did not dare to appear in front of the officers and soldiers. They just whispered after they left. They quickly dispersed into the night without any trace.The inns in the city were also attacked tonight. The shopkeeper's assistants and the guests upstairs were all pulled out for investigation. If it seems that the family is rich, it is more careful to cross examine, even a fly is searched in the house.He Yan is sitting by the bed, the light has been turned off, only a little moonlight comes through the window. Now it's late at night, Xiao Jue and Fei Nu have not come back yet. She thought to herself, are these two people not coming back? Just like those families with poor families who can't afford to raise extra children, they take their little son to the crowded street and cheat them to buy sugar. In a flash, the people are gone and their bones and flesh are abandoned on the roadside.Xiao Jue abandoned her? Then she is too pitiful! With only such a small amount of money, the hotel will have to pay for the room tomorrow, have to eat, and go back to Liangzhou health station. Is this what people can do? If that's the case, tomorrow she'll sell the Nightingale next door. He Yan thinks wildly about whether this person will come back or not. If he doesn't come back, she and Tao Tao just have a room for each other tonight, which is not a waste.Just thinking, Tao Tao Tao, who was also sitting on the edge of the collapse, whispered, \"you won't run away, will you?\"\"Ah?\" He Yan was surprised.\"They said that sun Ling was very powerful in Liangzhou, and everyone was afraid of the power of the sun family. I have asked for help with many people before. When they heard that it was Sun Ling, no one dared to help. \"Tao Tao said this with indignation. At that time, she was exiled in Wanhua Pavilion, which was not calculated at the beginning. Struggling on the road, he took the opportunity to ask for help. She looked for a lot of people, including strong men who looked tall and powerful, and scholars who looked at the full mouth of propriety, righteousness and shame. There are rich businessmen who can be her father, and chivalrous men who travel around with swords on their backs. She tried to find those who seemed capable of saving her, but when they heard that sun Ling wanted them, they walked away with their tails in their hands. Even if she promised to give up her identity, no one paid attention to her.In the end, Tao Tao himself was in despair. When the note was thrown out, she didn't even think about tomorrow. I just want to see sun Ling and die with him. Who knows, at the last moment, someone rushed out.She turned her head to look at the people on her side. The teenager tilted her head and didn't know what she was thinking. It was strange that such a frail and young person would have an inexplicable sense of security. Maybe it's the soft smile on her face, or her clear eyes without dust.Tao Tao believes this man inexplicably, but he is worried. She said, \"the strong dragon can't beat the local snake...\"\"And you know that?\" He Yan laughed, \"in fact, I am also a local villain, I am very powerful.\"When Tao Tao saw her relaxed, she also relaxed a little. Looking at Heyan, she couldn't help asking the last question. She asked, \"the sun family are so domineering. You are not from Liangzhou, and you don't know what kind of trouble you will bring if you save me. They don't dare to do anything. Why did you save me? \"This child, why so many problems. Heyan side head, see the little girl's eyes red looking at her, curious and expectant, can not help but reach out to touch her head.\"Because you are a woman.\" \"And I am also a woman,\" she said in silence\u2026\u2026The noise besieged the whole inn.The night was glowing with fire, and all the people in the inn were awakened by the sudden officials and stood at the door for questioning.Sun Ling stood at the door, his eyes fell on the last room upstairs and said, \"what about that room? Why don't you open the door? \"The shopkeeper's trembling to knock on the door: \"young master, young master?\"After a long time, someone came to open the door slowly. He was a delicate young man. He was wearing an inner garment. He was sleepy and said, \"it's so late. What's the matter?\"Before the words fell, the officers and soldiers went in and searched. There was also a schoolboy in the room, who was busy dressing the boy: \"young master, don't get cold.\"The officers and soldiers went in to search, but failed, and soon came out and shook his head to sun Ling.Sun Ling looked at the young man in front of him. He was young and looked well cared for. His schoolboy was busy putting on boots for him.\"What are you doing?\" He Yan frown, \"a greeting does not say.\"\"Say hello?\" Sun Ling sneered, \"joke, Liangzhou city does not need my sun Ling to say hello.\" He looked at Heyan and remembered what the guards said before. He was about seven feet tall and thin. That's exactly what happened to this teenager.\"What's your name?\" He asked.\"Cheng Lei su.\" He Yan replied.\"Pa\" a sound, the schoolboy's boots did not hold steady, fell to the ground, people with their eyes to see, sun Ling look a change, suddenly said: \"you, raise your head.\"He was referring to the schoolboy.He Yan was not good at heart and asked, \"what are you doing? Do you want to rob me in broad daylight? \"\"Your men?\" Sun Ling was staring at him, his eyes were overcast, \"don't talk too early. The one on the ground, look up to meThe people on the ground did not move. They lowered their heads and looked carefully. Their hands were still shaking.Seeing this, sun Ling looked more and more ferocious. He went to pull the schoolboy's hair. The next moment, he Yan block in front of the schoolboy, she holds sun Ling's arm: \"this childe, pay attention to your words and deeds.\"\"You are the assassin who robbed me of my concubine?\" Sun Ling laughed, birthmark such as demon ghost tattoo, \"you are dead!\" He said, \"come on, catch them both for me!\"\"Catch me?\" He Yan laughed, and she said, \"I advise you to think twice before you act. Do you know who my uncle is? \"Sun Ling asked, \"who is your uncle?\"\"My uncle is Mr. Xiao, the second son of Xiao, who is now the commander of the right army. Are you sure you want to catch me He Yan raises eyebrows.Sun Ling was stunned and laughed for a moment. His tears of laughter were coming out. He pointed to Heyan and asked the people around him, \"did you hear him? Who did he say his uncle was?\"Everyone around me laughed.\"Stinky boy,\" Sun Ling stopped laughing and glared at Heyan: \"since your uncle is Xiao Jue, you can let him out! What happened to Xiao Jue? Today, in front of your uncle, I will tell you that there is no way for you to live or die! \"\"Is it?\"A strange voice came from behind him.Sun Ling looked back and saw the young man, who was as bright as the moon, came slowly with the bodyguard behind him. His voice was low, with a cold mockery.\"You may as well try it.\"www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sun Ling looked at the youth in front of him. Seeing the young man's beautiful appearance and elegant manner, he didn't feel jealous. Because he had a big birthmark on his face and knew that he was ugly, he especially hated the beautiful people. There are numerous concubines in his family, and they often defile good girls when they are outside. However, they are not entirely because of lust. They will never be spoiled. The beauties were in his hands, and often came to a miserable end. What sun Ling doesn't own, seeing that others have it, he wants to destroy it.The man in front of him is really too excellent, not to mention Liangzhou, but also one of the best in the Wei Dynasty.\"Uncle!\" He Yan jumped up and ran to Xiao Jue. He only showed a head and pointed to sun Ling with his hand. \"This man, bullying me!\"She yelled naively, such as the child was bullied outside and went home to complain to the elder. The flying slave on one side saw this and was speechless.Xiao Jue's body was also stiff. He held back his dislike and ignored the man who pulled his clothes behind him. He only looked at Sun Ling: \"is that you?\"Sun Ling's heart leaped.The young man's appearance is really too good, his expression is plain, but with a little invisible edge, even if it is a calm question, listen to people can't help but cold heart, inexplicably produce some fear.He calmed down, looked at Xiao Jue and said coldly, \"it's me. Who are you? \"\"Xiao Jue.\"Xiao Jue? Sun Ling is suspicious. He had never seen Xiao Jue. More than half a year ago, he heard that Xiao Jue had brought new soldiers to Liangzhou to garrison Liangzhou garrison. However, he did not come to Liangzhou City, let alone the sun family. Sun Ling, of course, has heard the name of Xiao Jue. He is a famous young murderer in the Wei Dynasty. He is beautiful and beautiful. Now this life is good, but in addition, how can we prove that he is Xiao Jue. Besides The commanding commander of the right army, only one bodyguard when he goes out? One of his sons, a magistrate of the county, had to support him when he went out. What happened to this nephew? In any case, these people all look strange.Sun Ling whispered to his sidekick, \"have you heard about general Fengyun's coming to the city recently?\"The boy shook his head: \"NoWhen sun Ling heard the speech, he was more suspicious. However, he was always cunning and was not willing to draw a conclusion easily. So he sneered at Xiao Jue: \"since you say you are Xiao Jue, do you have a jade card to prove your identity?\"Xiao Jue: NoNot even a jade card? Sun Ling's heart changed. These people in front of him must be counterfeit goods. Sun Ling was annoyed to think that he was almost frightened by the counterfeit goods. He looked at Xiao Jue and said, \"I don't care who you are. You dare to take away the official family members without permission. This is a death penalty. Come on, get them for me\"What kind of official dependents?\" He Yan leaned out of Xiao Jue's back and said in a loud voice, \"that's my schoolboy! If you want to say it is your official dependents, please show evidence! What about her deed? You don't even have a personal contract. If you arrest people at random, there is no royal law! \"\"Royal law?\" Sun Ling laughed ferociously, \"in Liangzhou, my sun family is the king's law! Do it for meA group of officers and men stormed forward.He Yan now plays Cheng Lishu, who has no strength to bind a chicken. Of course, he won't do it. She, ah ah, for fear that the world would not be in disorder, cried out: \"killing! Officers and soldiers have killed people! \"There were other guests living up and down in the inn. When he heard the words, he was in a state of chaos. Even dogs began to bark in the street.Xiao Jue said, \"flying slave.\"The bodyguard in black immediately blocks in front of Xiao Jue, and he Yan takes the opportunity to see clearly. She didn't know whether feinu was a member of Jiuqi camp or not, but judging from her skills, she could be comparable to her former self. If the nine flag camp is at this level, I'm afraid that miss heta is not qualified.Her eyes did not change. She pulled Xiao Jue's clothes out of shape. She heard Xiao Jue scold in a low voice: \"let go.\"\"Oh.\" He Yan regained consciousness and quickly let go. Seeing that his sleeve was crumpled by himself, he stroked and tried to smooth it. He said, \"uncle, big brother feinu is really good. GreatYou don't have to think about yourself at this time, and he Yunsheng has a virtue.Xiao Jue ignored her.The officers and soldiers in Liangzhou government office are carved in the same mold as sun Ling. They are good at wine and food all day long. They have formed the habit of only eating and not doing things. It's OK to catch the old and the weak, the young and the old, who can't hold a chicken in their hands. They don't have the strength to fight in the first World War.Feinu alone knocked them all to the ground.Seeing this, sun Ling took a step back and told the boy: \"go... Go and call all the people to me!\"the boy turned to run. Before he could run, he was hit with a stone, his legs softened and he knelt down.He Yan stealthily throws away the stone in his hand, which of course can't be reported. Although it is not impossible to fight, but the fight is so tiring that the flying slave also needs to rest.Suddenly, there is no one around. Sun Ling was half angry and half frightened. He pointed to Xiao Jue and said, \"you If you dare to beat officers and soldiers, is there any royal law? \"\"Don't you say that you are the king's law in Liangzhou?\" He Yan felt that his appearance at the moment was like a dog to help others. He hid behind Xiao Jue and talked back to sun Ling. \"This adult, you are not so good at the royal law. It's better that the bodyguards of other people can fight.\"\"YouSun Ling pulls out his whip and throws it on Heyan's face. Heyan shrinks behind Xiao Jue. The next moment, feinu grabs the whip of the other party and kicks it. Sun Ling is knocked down by the kick. Feinu steps on his head and tramples his face into the ground.He Yan looks at how tongue, this flying slave looks at not to utter a word, also quite ruthless.\"Young master, kill or not?\" Asked feinu.\"You You dare to kill me My father is chicken County in Liangzhou, \"Sun Ling was trampled so hard that he couldn't say clearly. He was angry and afraid. However, at this time, he still didn't believe that this man dared to really kill him. He still didn't forget to speak hard,\" my father will not let you go! You are all going to die\"Young people, don't curse others.\" Seeing that he had been restrained, he Yan stepped forward and squatted beside sun Ling. He looked at him and said, \"besides, who is not dead? You think you're a monster, you'll never die? I really admire youShe was more angry and shameful than the feinu who stepped on her face. Sun Ling was speechless.He Yan doesn't like this person at all. In the world, she hates nothing more than bullying the weak. Men who bully women are more hateful. If they have no conscience, they will bully women only if they have no ability. You can do it to a lovely girl. This man is a beast.She wanted to be angry with sun Ling again. Suddenly, there was a change downstairs, as if someone had taken the crowd upstairs. As soon as she got up, someone rushed to the door of the corridor and said, \"my son!\"He Yan followed the voice to see, but saw a man rushed to sun Ling, flying slave raised his feet, he held sun Ling's head and said, \"my son! Do you have any injuries? \"This is a middle-aged man, born and sun Ling very similar, and the cheek also has a black birthmark and sun Ling the same. But because he was older than sun Ling, besides his ugly appearance, he took a kind of obscene vulgarity, and then dressed luxuriantly, it was quite inhumane.He Yan realized that he was not a superficial person who judged people by his appearance. Seeing this person, he could not help but move his eyes, and then looked at Xiao Jue's face and waist. He felt that he felt much more comfortable from body to heart.This is the best color in the world.\"Dad,\" Sun Ling said, pointing to Heyan and Xiao Jue, as if the light was shining back. \"These two people pretended to be imperial officials, took my concubines, and injured my people. Dad, you can arrest them. I want them to die without a burial place!\"\"How brave you are This person hears speech, immediately angry, pointing to He Yan several humanity: \"come on, take them down!\"\"It was Sunji county.\" He Yan said with a smile: \"why waste time? Anyway, your people can't beat it. It's just a bunch of bread and butter. \"About did not expect to meet this kind of oil and salt does not enter the people, Sunzhi county also stupefied for a while, to return to God, is more angry, only way: \"take them, do not talk about life and death!\"Don't talk about life and death? He Yan frowned. No wonder the sun family and his son were hiding the sky in Liangzhou city. Isn't it true that the officials in the capital don't have the power, but they just come.\"Sun Xiangfu,\" interrupted Xiao Jue. He looked at each other, spoke coldly, and his voice was like stabbing people with a knife. \"You can open your eyes and see who I am.\"When he got the news, sun Xiangfu didn't have time to listen to what happened. He only knew that sun Ling took people to get people. He didn't want to be bullied. When Lao Tzu supported his son, what's more, this is Liangzhou City, and sun Xiangfu didn't think so much about it. When he came here and saw sun Ling beaten so badly, sun Xiangfu was deeply distressed. The light was dim. He didn't go to see Xiao Jue's face carefully. At the moment, he suddenly heard his words and raised his eyes seriously.At this point, I was stunned.A moment later, sun Xiangfu suddenly lifted the corner of his robe and knelt down. His head was on the ground. His voice was trembling with fear: \"Officer I don't know that the governor has arrived here. If you miss me, please forgive meGovernor? Sun Ling looked at her father in surprise.Seeing sun Xiangfu return to his taste, I can't think of any waves when I look at him. He Yan then said with a smile, \"what kind of sin should Sun Zhi county forgive?\"? When young master sun just came upstairs, he wanted to take away my schoolboy and kill me. He wanted to make my life worse than death in front of my uncle. Now you want us to forgive? How dare we? \"\"Isn't it, uncle?\" She looked at Xiao Jue and confidently complained.This time, in addition to Xiao Jue, there is also his nephew, the young master of Yousi zhilang's family. At the moment, this young man is called Uncle Xiao Jue, and he must be Cheng Lishu. I didn't expect that his unfilial son even bumped into his uncle and nephew. Sun Xiangfu's heart was unbearable.He slapped sun Ling in the face. Sun Ling was beaten on the head. The slap was so strong that everyone could hear the sound.Sun Xiangfu knelt down and kowtowed as he said, \"all the officials are not good at teaching their children. The dogs have no eyes. They can't recognize the governor and the young master. When he bumped into an adult, Wan Wang, the governor, Hai Han, will teach the dog well when he goes back. \"Seeing Xiao Jue still silent, sun Xiangfu bit his teeth and slapped him. Sun lingben was injured. His reaction was not as good as before. He was stunned by his slap. At the moment, he was slapped and screamed. However, sun Xiangfu would not give up. Since he wanted to show Xiao Jue, he could never be soft hearted. He said: \"you are an unfilial son. You have forgotten all the proprieties, righteousness, integrity and shame taught you by your father on weekdays.\"! How can you slander people! I know that you admire governor Xiao in your heart. You think that someone pretends to be governor Xiao will be so indignant But, this is the real governor Xiao. You are so kind to do bad thingsHe Yan said: She was astonished to hear it. Look, people in office can talk. Even if she had been a military general of three grades in her previous life, she did not have such a good tongue. If she could have such a good tongue, would she be able to serve as an official, a king and a marquis.Sun Xiangfu puffed dozens of times, and sun Ling was beaten and screamed, and then he simply did not make a sound. Seeing this, sun Xiangfu felt heartache. Although he has a large number of wives and concubines, he has only one son. To show Xiao Jue at present is to hope that Xiao Jue will step down.However, the cold and merciless commander of the right army just stood on the sidelines and did not open his mouth. If he went on like this, he did not know whether he would kill sun Ling.Sun Xiangfu couldn't help it. He let go of his hand and knelt down to Xiao Jue. He kept kowtowing to Xiao Jue, \"governor, if you hit him again, you will die. Please give the dog a way to live! Governor, if you want to punish meFor a moment, sun Xiangfu couldn't help kowtowing on the ground. Sun Ling lay bleeding on one side of his mouth. Looking at it was a pity. If he hadn't seen what kind of virtue sun Ling was before, Heyan could not help being deeply moved by this scene. After all, it is the son who does evil. What did the old father do wrong?But Xiao Jue didn't let Heyan down. Even if sun Xiangfu's head was broken, Xiao Jue's face did not move.When sun Xiangfu felt that he couldn't support himself, Xiao Jue opened his mouth.He said: \"the son does not teach the father's fault, sun Xiangfu,\" he bowed his head and looked down at Sun Xiangfu. His voice was also very calm. \"Do you forget how Zhao Nuo died?\"As soon as he said this, sun Xiangfu's sobs stopped abruptly and began to feel cool from the beginning to the end.How did Zhao Nuo die? Zhao Nuo was pushed by the man in front of him to behead under the stele hall. Who is Zhao Nuo? Zhao Nuo is the eldest son of the Minister of Hubu today!How could he forget this? When Zhao Nuo had an accident, many high-ranking officials and nobles came to plead for mercy because of the relationship between Zhao Nuo and his majesty. Xiao Jue, 16, did not blink. He said that he would kill him, and his majesty could do nothing about it.This person, but can move the real character. He can kill all the sons of the Minister of Hubu. Although he dominates Liangzhou, he is only a small magistrate.Sun Xiangfu was so scared that his tears almost fell down. He trembled and said, \"governor, please spare your life! Please forgive meSun Ling didn't know why her father was afraid of Xiao Jue, but when she saw her father like this, she was frightened.All the guests upstairs and downstairs were shocked by the incident. They were very happy to see that the father and son of the magistrate, who had always committed crimes in Liangzhou, were in such a mess today.Also do not know how long, Xiao Jue just carried the body way: \"you get up.\"Sun Xiangfu was so weak that he almost fainted. Looking at Xiao Jue's back, he said, \"governor?\"\"Next time, it will be his life.\" He said.Sun Xiangfu was overjoyed and dragged sun Ling to kowtow to Xiao Jue. He said, \"there are a lot of Dudu adults. Don't argue with the dogs. The governor can rest assured that there will be another time in the future. There is no need for the governor to do anything. The officials and relatives will kill him by themselves.\"Xiao Jue turned to the room and said, \"take your people and leave here at once.\"\"Governor Don't you want to live in your house Sun Xiangfu asked carefully.\"No, I have something else to do in Liangzhou. When Yuan Baozhen arrives, I will come to the door. \"What else did sun Xiangfu want to say, but he held back again. It was not a good place for him to speak when things suddenly happened today. It's better to take sunling back first and find a doctor to show him. Then he answered Xiao Jue's words and ordered his men to move.\u2026\u2026Sun Xiangfu's action is very fast, but with the help of a stick of incense, his staff are clean and clean up the things that have just been broken. The guests also scattered. The shopkeeper didn't expect that such a Buddha was staying in the inn. He Yan patted him on the shoulder: \"it's OK. We are all very kind. Don't be afraid. Your mung bean chess noodles are very delicious. I'll eat them tomorrow.\"When the shopkeeper saw that the boy was naive, he put his heart down. After the shopkeeper left, he Yan was relieved. When he turned around and looked at Xiao Jue's back, his heart was raised again.How can I explain it to this adult?Xiao Jue did not enter his own room, but into Heyan's room. Fei Nu also followed in. When he Yan walked in, he saw the pottery shrinking in the corner of the wall.She was probably just scared. When she came from Xiao Jue, she hid in the corner and lowered her head. He Yan walked over and patted her on the back and comforted him, \"they're gone. They're all right.\"She was so soft spoken that Xiao Jue and feinu couldn't help looking at her. Seeing this, he Yan said, \"uncle --\"\"you won't tell me,\" he stares at Heyan and sneers: \"your fiancee has come to Liangzhou to look for you?\"Fiancee? He Yan thought for a while and then remembered that she seemed to have made a fable about a fiancee in order not to let Shen muxue, the medical daughter, find out that she was a woman. Unexpectedly, Xiao Jue still remembered.\"No, uncle,\" He Yan said solemnly, \"I was in Liangzhou city. I saw that sun Ling forcibly robbed a woman and forced her husband to become a prostitute. I couldn't see it for a while, so I helped. Who knows this sun Ling is so lawless in Liangzhou that he chases him to the inn. I.... \" She flattered with a smile, \"I also carry forward your good reputation for eliminating harm to the people!\"Xiao Jue sneered: \"I don't need that kind of thing.\"He Yan couldn't answer this.She thought about it for a while and decided to put it another way. \"I was really scared to death just now. Fortunately, uncle, you came in time. Otherwise, I don't know what to look like to be bullied by sunling. I'm not sure I'll die to see you in the future.\"\"You are my nephew,\" Xiao Jue smell speech, hook lips leisurely way: \"who dares to bully you?\"Words are good words. Why do they sound so wrong? He Yan thought, well, he called him uncle. Anyway, all the cheap things have been taken, so don't care about taking more or less. It's just a verbal advantage and doesn't lose a piece of meat.\"Then this girl, uncle, let's take her home. If you stay in Liangzhou, you will surely be revenged by sunling. \" Heyan tried to ask him for his opinion.\"Do it yourself.\"If really heartless, he Yan in the heart stomach Fei.At this time, the schoolboy who had not spoken suddenly raised his head, looked at Xiao Jue and said, \"Xiao Er childe?\"Her voice, though hesitant, was not small, especially clear in the quiet night. Xiao Jue looked at her, but saw that the schoolboy was a young man with dark skin and red eyes, but her voice was the timid and timid daughter's, and she did not feel that she was frowning.Seeing her frown, the schoolboy was more afraid and blurted out: \"I am Song Tao Tao!\"It turned out that her surname was not Tao, but song. He Yan thought, how could Song Tao sound more familiar? Where did he hear it? If we look at Song Tao Tao's initiative to call Xiao Jue, do they not know each other?Thinking of this, he Yan asked the exit, she said: \"you Do you know him? \"Song Tao Tao looked at Heyan with complicated eyes. She said, \"young master Xiao It's the one who wants to be engaged with me. \"He Yan: \"what!\"\u201c\u2026\u2026 My uncle. \" Song Tao Tao finished his speech.Heyan breathed a sigh of relief. She said that she had never heard of the news of Xiao Jue's engagement. How could a person who was engaged suddenly appear? It was Uncle It's uncle?!She looked at Xiao Jue and asked, \"well, governor, how many nephews do you have?\"Xiao Jue looked at her as if she were looking at a fool.He Yan understood it in an instant.This is Cheng Lishu's fiancee! Cheng Lishu came to Liangzhou from shuojing to escape marriage. Coincidentally, her fiancee also thought so. Who knows she was abducted to Liangzhou on the way to escape from marriage and was rescued by herself. This is how a kind of divine fate, they are afraid that it is destined to be a pair!It's no wonder that when sun Ling came, Heyan reported to his family that he was Cheng Lishu. Song Tao Tao was so surprised that his boots fell off. It turned out that he was frightened by the news of his fiance.\"Xiao Er childe,\" Song Tao Tao looked very tangled, \"I I don't want to go back to shuojing for the time being. I heard that you are stationed in Liangzhou garrison. Can I follow you to the garrison? I I promise you no trouble\"Are you sure you want to go to liangzhouwei?\" Xiao Er childe's expression is cold, \"your fiance is here now.\"Song Tao Tao's expression is stiff, and he Yan feels that she is almost crying.\"Miss Song, don't you like Master Cheng?\" He Yan whispered: \"I think he is very good.\" Cheng Lishu, this person, in addition to a little silly, is not bad. Sometimes it is naive, but the heart is very good. Looks can also be called handsome and lovely, family background is not to mention, how can not be despised into such a bar.\"He can't do anything,\" the little girl said of Cheng Lishu, and her eyes and eyebrows were full of disgust. \"If you don't become a martial artist, you can't make progress! I don't like him. He's not as good as youHe Yan is a little flattered. She and Song Tao Tao have not been together for half a day, so she got such a high evaluation. It's really flattering.Xiao Jue glanced at her and said to Song Tao Tao, \"we'll talk about it later. You'll have a rest today. I'll call the doctor tomorrow.\"Song Tao nodded.He Yan yawned and felt sleepy. Because Song Tao Tao was a girl, the shopkeeper found a room for Song Tao again, next to Heyan and them. Feinu lives with Heyan. He goes to sleep on the side couch and gives the bed to Heyan. He Yan is very grateful and even a little guilty.But the guilt was quickly diluted by other things.It's a coincidence that she saved Song Tao Tao tonight. Even she didn't expect that the girl she saved was Cheng Lishu's fiancee. These two people are really childish. They run away from marriage when they don't agree with each other. They also escape to Liangzhou thousands of miles away. Fortunately, he Yan bumped into him today, otherwise I really don't know what to do.It seems that sun Xiangfu is afraid of Xiao Jue. It is also the attitude of Xiao Jue, which is arrogant to the point of disgusting. Heyan realized that she would not speak to her colleagues or subordinates in the past when she had the most prominent military achievements and status. At the end of the day, it's still a different person.No wonder Cheng Lishu will be developed into a \"useless childe\" who can't do anything, and will always be upright. Nonsense. With such a powerful uncle, he can walk horizontally in the Wei Dynasty. What else can he do with both literature and martial arts? She is just a casual complaint tonight, can let in Liangzhou county magistrate father and son kowtow to make amends, this feeling of being protected is very fresh, the taste is also very good.He Yan now think about it, feel strange envy Cheng Li Su.It is impossible for Song Tao Tao to be alone in Liangzhou. I'm afraid she can't be short of people. Who knows if the sun family father and son will wait for an opportunity to revenge. The best way is to send her back to shuojing's parents with the protection of the Song family. But now Song Tao Tao, in order to escape his marriage, has come to Liangzhou. He may not go back to shuojing obediently. Moreover, the people who sent her back to shuojing are not easy to find.So in order to protect Song Tao Tao's safety, she can only be left in Liangzhou Wei for the time being. I don't know what kind of expression Cheng Lishu would look like when she saw Song Tao Tao. They won't fight, will they? It doesn't matter if you really want to fight. Anyway, there is a ready-made arena.He Yan didn't know what he was thinking. Those thoughts gathered together and became a question: who was Song Tao Tao?Why is this name so familiar that it has to be called out several times, but how can't it be remembered.Feinu is a martial arts practitioner. He doesn't make a sound when he sleeps. He Yan is used to the snoring of Weida Tongpu in Liangzhou. He can't sleep for a while and turns over. Who knows she joined the army and joined his nephew? It's incredible.Join the army enlist!In the dark, Heyan suddenly sat up.She remembered who Song Tao Tao was.In fact, he Yan had the first quarrel with Heyuan Shanda, and then took advantage of the night to join the Fuyue army. It was because of this song girl that he Yan got up.www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 92": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth of a Star GeneralCH 92Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHe Yan entered Xianchang hall at the age of 14 and joined the Fuyue army at the age of 15. No one knew that she was in a hurry when she joined the army. All the Shibao in the Xianchang hall were frightened. Later, after she returned to Beijing, she had already won meritorious service and was granted by the emperor. Therefore, he family did not investigate why he wanted to join the army.Now think about it, if she had not received any meritorious service at that time, but was just an ordinary soldier. After a few years of wandering life, she would not have returned to his family.Heyan still remembers the pottery of the Song Dynasty.At the age of 15, he Yan studied in the Xianchang hall under the identity of he Rufei. She is mediocre in qualification, and the girl is naturally less powerful than the man, so she can't be compared with the teenagers in Xianchang hall. He Yuansheng gradually saw it, but he did not blame her. He Yan thought that he could live a peaceful life all the time.Until that day.There are two days a month for students to go home. But because of the rainy season, the rain washed down the plaque at the gate of Xianchang hall. The teachers asked the students to go home one day in advance and come back three days later.He Yan back in a hurry, no one knows. She changed her clothes first, and then went to heyuansheng. When she came back to his home every month, he Yuansheng would ask him about his life in Xianchang hall. This kind of alienated, almost surveillance questioning doesn't make Heyan feel warm. Every time she talks to he Yuansheng, she is actually a little nervous.But on that day, when she went, he Yuansheng had not come back, and even the boy was not at the door. She sat and waited in heyuansheng's study. There was a screen in the study. He Yan felt that he had nothing to do. He might as well sit down and read for a while in front of the screen.She just sat for a moment when someone came in.He Yuanliang's voice said, \"what do you think about Heyan?\"He Yan, who was about to go out, was stunned for a moment and tried to bypass the screen. Instead of going out, she shrank back.He Yuanliang and he Yuansheng have different temperaments. He Yuansheng looked gentle, but in fact he was strict. Later he gave birth to other children and treated them very harshly. He Yuanliang, her biological father, is a totally different temperament, always smiling. In addition to her, she was also spoiled.He Yan's feelings towards he Yuanliang are very complicated. If we say that she is in awe of the elder like his adoptive father and the eldest uncle, she brings a trace of invisible dependence and expectation to he Yuanliang. She expected he Yuan Liang to be as kind to her sisters as he was to her sisters, but he did not. Every time I look at her eyes, if you look at her nephew's eyes, polite, at most preaching a few words.In this way, the number of times of disappointment, he Yan also did not force.But today, he heard his name from his father's mouth. He Yan didn't know why he wanted to hide here.\"She's very good now. She's studying in Xianchang hall, and no one has found out. Now she's 15 The marriage must be settled before the age of 18 at most. \"He Yan, shrinking behind the screen, held his breath for a moment.Marriage? She never thought about these, she is now facing the identity of he Rufei, is a man's identity, how can we get married? What should he do once he has made an appointment? Who will do this \"Wo Rufei\"?She thought of it for granted that she was a woman. Naturally, she was engaged to a man. After all, she was not good at grinding mirrors. However, he Yuan Liang's words surprised her.\"Elder brother, do you see a suitable girl in Beijing?\"Girl?How can it be a girl?He Yan raised his head. The two people outside the screen were facing her with their backs. They could not see their expressions clearly. They only listened to the tone. They were calm and did not feel how shocking their words were.\"Song Ci, vice governor of the inner Province, has two daughters. The eldest daughter is married and the youngest is now 11 years old.\" Heyuan Sheng said: \"he is a little younger, but when he Yan is 18, he has already reached the hairpin. After two years, we can get married. \"\"Song Ci's daughter?\" He Yuan Liang hesitated, \"is that little girl named Song Tao Tao? I remember that Song Ci searched for her daughter's birthday gift the year before last, and all the merchants in shuojing would go through it again. \"\"Yes,\" He Yuan Sheng asked with a smile, \"there is no young man in Song Ci's house, only two daughters. Now that the eldest daughter is married, she dotes on her younger daughter. If you can get married with the Song family, you will get the help of the Song family. Why worry that our family is not thriving? \"On hearing this, he Yuanliang also slowed down his expression and said: \"what elder brother said is reasonable. It's better for me to hold a banquet for song cilai's family in a few days, so as to talk about the children's affairs. At least let him know that we have this idea first. \"They talked happily, as if the marriage was just a transaction, and that was all. Nowadays, women are the weight to check and balance marriage. But she can be used as a weight, how can we ignore her identity?She's a woman! How can a woman marry a woman? If she does get married, will it hurt her life?He Yan thought so in his heart, suddenly ran into the screen and made a sound. He Yuansheng turned his head and said, \"who?\"Seeing that he Yan was found, he simply stood up and said, \"it's me.\"\"Heyan?\" Heyuansheng was relieved, then frowned and said, \"Why are you here? Isn't it time to be in Xianchang hall today\"Shibao asked us to leave school one day in advance. I'm here to find my father.\" He Yan said here, pause for a moment, secretly take a look at He Yuan Liang. He Yuanliang showed his habitual smile, and his expression did not change because he was called \"father\" of heyuansheng.It's just another disappointment. Why don't you give up. He Yan lowered his head to cover the loss in his eyes.\"I have something to discuss with your second uncle. You can come to me later.\" Heyuan Sheng said: \"go to see your mother first.\"He Yan did not move.\"Heyan?\" He Yuansheng frowned again.\"I have heard what my father and second uncle just said.\" He Yan raised his head, voice calm, \"father, I am a woman, how can I marry the second miss of the Song family?\"He Yan did not expect to speak like this. The two brothers of the he family were stunned for a moment.\"These are not your business,\" he replied after a while. \"I will arrange everything for you.\"\"I will not marry the second miss of the Song family. As a woman, it's enough to sacrifice me alone. There's no need to implicate irrelevant people. \" He Yan Dao.She is now 15 years old, a little taller than before. She is dressed up as a teenager. Her eyes are clear and open. She stands here like a poplar tree and looks like a stranger.Heyuan said angrily, \"what do you mean by this? Are you angry with us? Is it to blame us for sacrificing your right to be a woman? \"He Yuan Liang looked at her with a smile, \"Heyan, how can you talk to big brother like this? Big brother is for your goodHe Yan thought, is this really for her? Her husband taught her that \"compassion is the end of benevolence; the heart of shame is the end of righteousness; the heart of resignation is the end of propriety; the heart of right and wrong is the end of wisdom\". But now what he family wants her to do is that she is not benevolent, unjust, impolite and not wise. How ridiculous?Without fear, Heyan replied in a loud voice: \"I will never promise to marry Miss Song! Not only that, I will not marry any woman in this life, which will delay others' life! \"He Yuansheng and he Yuanliang were both stunned.He Yan's temperament is known to his family. She is gentle and talkative, and even a little timid and cowardly. In the he family, she does what she is told to do, and does not like to cause trouble. If it had not been for the exchange of identities, she would have lived a life like a puppet, just like all the mediocre officials in shuojing.But what does she look like now?\"Heyan, do you dare to talk to me like that?\" He Yuansheng was really angry. When he was angry, his facial features were very fierce, and the children in the big room of he family were afraid of him.He Yan looked at him and was not moved. \"My father sent me to the Xianchang school to study for the sake of etiquette and virtue, not for the benefit of being a liar.\"The young man held his head high, proud, clear, and Fang Jie. The disdain in her eyes stung heyuansheng. He Yuansheng became angry, and he Yan slapped him in the face.It was the first time that Heyan was beaten by heyuansheng.And her father was watching, did not say anything, until the beginning of that sentence, is \"big brother is also for you.\".The quarrel between heyuansheng and Heyan shocked the whole family. As the highest authority of Heyuan Sheng, no one will doubt his decision. He Yan was kept in the ancestral hall for a day and night, and was released the next night.No one had visited her that day and night. Whether it's her adoptive father, her adoptive mother, or her natural father and mother. On this day and night, he Yan looked at the memorial tablets, big and small, and thought of only one question.What kind of family is he family? Does she really want to stay in the he family? If in this home, the significance of her existence is to make a substitute to bind them, which does not belong to their interests. If she has no sincerity, there is really no place to linger on.An even man, also want to break away from the line, dominate their own life.The next night, she went back to her room, which was deserted. He Yan remembers that these days, the Fuyue army was enlisting in the street. She sat on the couch, thinking that if someone came to see her tonight and asked if she was ok, she would not go.But never.From afar came the sound of playing a watch. Heyan carried the burden on his body and sneaked out in the night. For so many years, since she practiced martial arts on her own, she has been so familiar. It is also because he family did not value her, even when she left, it was so easy.Just, she thought, although she could not continue to stay in the he family, in the end, she saved a little girl in shuojing. How can he family get married when she is away. The girl named Song Tao Tao, and Ji Ji, may be able to stay with a young man who agrees with him for life, instead of being involved in this shady plot and becoming a pawn sacrificed.The night was heavy and could not see the end. The girl disguised as a teenager did not know what the road ahead was. She looked back at the gate of the he family. The house was hidden in the night and connected with the past. She was cruel and ruthless. She turned around and walked forward without turning back.The past unfolded in front of his eyes, as if blowing away the dust covered in it. It gradually became clear that it had only happened yesterday. Only Heyan knew that it was a previous life that he could never go back to.At that time, she was very young and angry with the brothers heyuansheng. She did not seriously think about the absurdity of the decision. She was a woman. If she really married Miss Song Er, sooner or later, this secret would be exposed. How could he family allow such a thing to happen?Unless, they had long expected that it would never happen.He Yan stares at the sachet hanging on the bed tent.Heyuansheng and heyuanliang knew from the beginning that sooner or later, if he had not, he would return. He Yan had no way to know the situation of he Rufei, but he Yuansheng knew that he Rufei's body was getting better and better at that time, which was not like he was dying as they said.It is because he knows that he Rufei will come back sooner or later, and he Yan and he Rufei will return to their original positions sooner or later, so they talk about the engagement without any scruple. They have made up their minds to take off the man's clothes and become the miss of he family again before he Ruo becomes married.At that time, Heyan didn't realize this. She thought that she would do it for a long time and maybe sacrifice her whole life. Unexpectedly, she didn't expect that she would become herself again one day. But this is not a gift. After being a substitute for a person for a long time, you will inevitably forget who you are.Moreover, on that day, she left the Hejia with her burden on her back and joined the Fuyue army. Since then, the layout of the he family has been disrupted and the chess game has been out of control.Who could have thought of it?Who would have thought that she had lived her whole life, died once, and then woke up and went around. She met a girl who was almost \"engaged\" with her in her previous life. The 11-year-old girl has grown into a graceful lady. The young man who left home with a burden has tasted all kinds of human tastes. The fate is mysterious. Without Song Tao Tao, she would not have left home or joined the army. There would have been no general Feihong, who is today's Heyan.In the dark, he Yan silently smile.Maybe it was just to tell her something that fate had made them meet here.She didn't do anything wrong. She saved a girl.\u2026\u2026The next morning, when Heyan woke up, feinu was no longer in the room.She thought about things late last night and slept so hard that she didn't know when feinu left. When she woke up and went to have a wash, she went out of the door. She wanted to knock on the door next door to see if Xiao Jue was in.As a result, the door next to the door opened. Song Tao Tao's head came out from behind the door. She said, \"do you want to find Mr. Xiao? They eat downstairs. \"Don't you call her at dinner? He Yan thought, this is really did not regard her as his own person. He Yan asked, \"have you eaten yet? Go down and eat togetherSong Tao Tao nodded.The little girl went downstairs with her. Sure enough, Xiao Jue and feinu were sitting downstairs by the window, and some dishes were randomly placed on the table. I don't know if I was shocked by Xiao Jue's identity last night. The innkeeper made this breakfast with great care and delicacy. He Yan wanted to scold him for extravagance.\"Uncle, you don't call me at dinner.\" He Yan muttered, \"if you don't call me, why don't you call Miss Song?\"\"I want to sleep more. It's not about Mr. Xiao.\" Song Tao Tao opens his mouth in a hurry. Somehow, she seems to be a little afraid of Xiao Jue. But I think it's the same thing. Xiao Jue talks coldly all day long. Who can stand the delicate little girl?He Yan put a single basket of golden milk cake into his mouth. The milk cake was fragrant and sweet. Soon after it came out of the cage, it was very hot and appetizing. She said with a smile, \"uncle, what do we do today?\"Xiao Jue looked at her like a smile: \"what do you want to do?\"\"I...\" Before he Yan finished speaking, Song Tao Tao began to speak.\"Cheng Mr. Cheng. \" She already knew that he Yan was not Cheng Lishu, but she could see that he Yan was playing \"Cheng Lishu\". She did not expose it. She called Cheng Lishu's name together. She said, \"can you go out with me?\"After saying this, the other three people on the table looked at Song Tao Tao.\"I I don't have any clothes. I can't get used to the men's clothes. I want to go out and buy two ready-made clothes to change, but I don't remember the way. Mr. Cheng, can you go shopping with me? \" She plucked up her courage to finish.Three people on the table, feinu can not say a word all night, Xiao Jue is not a person who can accompany the girl to buy things. Only Heyan was kind and gentle. He Yan said, \"of course! It's just She looked at Xiao Jue, \"uncle, what can we do today?\"\"Nothing.\" Xiao Jue hang Mou light way: \"you accompany song Er miss to go.\"\"Thank you, Mr. Xiao!\" Song Tao Tao was overjoyed.After dinner, he Yan went out with Song Tao Tao. After they left, feinu said, \"young master, I'm going to follow them now.\"\"Don't get too close.\" Xiao Jue orders, \"he also takes Song Tao Tao.\"Flying slave should be under, was about to leave, suddenly thought of something, hesitated for a moment, or opened his mouth: \"young master, sun Ling's matter, so calculate?\"\"Who says it's ok?\" Xiao Jue hook lip, \"wait a second, now is not the time.\"\u2026\u2026He Yan followed Song Tao Tao out of the inn.As soon as he left Mr. Xiao, Song Tao Tao became more and more cheerful. She approached Heyan and said in a low voice, \"why do you call uncle Xiao er? Why do you call yourself Cheng Lishu\"It's a long story. Young Master Cheng has something to do, so I'll come to Liangzhou for the time being. Don't tell anyone about it.\"Song Tao Tao said, \"of course I won't tell others! That rubbish childe, must be oneself cannot do, just let you replace? This kind of person still wants to be my husband. Why doesn't he dream? \"Miss Song's prejudice towards Cheng Lishu is really deep.\"What's your name then?\" Song Tao Tao asked.\"I can't tell you right now, so I won't let it slip. I'll tell you when the city is done. \" He Yan said with a smile.Song Tao Tao curled his lips and was not very happy. Heyan pointed to a clothing store. \"You see, there are clothes there. Why don't you go in and pick one?\"Song Tao Tao changed his mind and Heyan was relieved. However, this tone has not been relaxed for a long time, suddenly thought of something, then secretly bad.When Heyan came out of Liangzhou, Cheng Lishu gave her clothes and hairpin jewelry, but forgot to give her silver. He Yan didn't dare to ask Xiao Jue for it, so that she had only one ingot of silver for the flag. She had been reluctant to put it on her body. She would rather pull the button of Cheng Lei Su's clothes for tea instead of touching it. Song Tao Tao just came out of the Wanhua Pavilion. His money has been wiped clean. He Yan will pay for everything he bought today.This is all she has now!Fortunately, Liangzhou city is not shuojing. There is no tailor shop with hundreds of taels of silver for a garment. The ready-made clothes here are cheap and Heyan can't afford it. Song Tao Tao picked out a pair of shoes, a hairpin and a pair of earrings. Heyan could not help but pay for the silver, which was the only copper coin.Song Tao Tao picked out his clothes and changed them in order to come out. As soon as he came out, he became a pretty girl. She picked out a cherry red fairy skirt, long hair tied in a bun, hair band is also cherry red, bright eyes and teeth, Shanshan lovely.He Yan's eyes brightened. In an instant, the pain of spending money disappeared in front of the lovely girl.\"It's beautiful.\" She said heartily.Song Tao Tao blushed, turned his head and muttered, \"the clothes here are too shabby. There's nothing good about them. The clothes made by our tailors in Song Dynasty are much more beautiful than these clothes! \"He Yan thought, is this still called poverty? This has already spent her savings in the past six months!After wrapping the original clothes with a bundle, Song Tao Tao walked out of the clothing store and said, \"let's go shopping in other places.\"He Yan said Good. \"The beauty and loveliness of a little girl also costs money, especially the little girl raised by a wealthy family. He Yan only hopes that Liangzhou will not have anything to attract Miss Song's attention. She has no money.God seems to have heard her voice. Along the way, Song Tao Tao had nothing to buy. However, when I visited Liangzhou City, I was still in high spirits. He Yan has been trying his best to accompany her, not a bit bored, to the end, the arrogant little girl is also a little embarrassed, asked Heyan: \"you accompany me so long? Is it boring? \"\"No He Yan said with a smile: \"I just want to go around.\"Song Tao Tao looked at her for a long time and said, \"you are really a good man.\"He Yan is a little surprised, but she said so. The little girl has gone on. She thought about it, shook her head and laughed.To Song Tao Tao, he Yan's mood is not only to take care of the little girl, but also to indulge him as much as the elder. After all, the girl almost became her fiancee. It was also the person who had been willing to leave home and wanted to make it, which, in a way, changed her fate. In the years after that, Song Tao Tao didn't get involved in those inexplicable things and grew up well.He Yan felt very lucky if she had not done so. Maybe later Song Tao Tao would not marry a woman, but the person who married became he Rufei. Is it really a good thing to marry into he family? This family has no warmth but interests. It is not suitable for a girl like Song Tao Tao.However, he Yan looked at the little girl in front of the skipping back, some helpless. At the beginning, she left home, which was also a \"runaway marriage\". At present, Cheng Lishu also ran away from her marriage. Song Tao Tao still ran away from her marriage. Is this due to the escape of marriage?She has to talk to Cheng Lishu.\u2026\u2026The sun's house in Liangzhou city is a bleak place.Sun Ling was sent back to the sun family last night. Sun Xiangfu asked famous doctors to treat sun Ling's injuries. Although it's all skin and flesh injuries, it's really not light. We should take good care of it for a few months.When did young master sun suffer such a great loss from childhood to adulthood. Sun Xiangfu was also in a bad mood. Early this morning, he punished several servants according to their mistakes.People dare not take a wrong step. The house is quiet. Sun Ling was lying on the bed. Mrs. sun sat beside the bed and wiped her tears. She said: \"your father is too much. He is just a general. How could he beat you like this? My son has suffered, and I don't know when to keep this injury... \"As soon as sun Xiangfu came in, he heard this and said angrily, \"the view of women! What is \"just a military general?\" you know that he even dares to kill the legitimate eldest son of the Minister of Hubu, who stabs him to the emperor. What happened in the end? In the end, I had to admit my bad luck! If he killed this unfilial son last night, what do you think you can do? Nothing can be done! \"After being scolded, Mrs. sun froze for a long time and said, \"he, he is really so powerful? What shall we do now? Is it an apology to him? \"\"You go out.\" Sun Xiangfu was so upset that he waved his hand, \"I will arrange these. I came here to ask Ling er a few things. \"Sun Xiangfu walked away with tears in her eyes. Looking at Sun Ling's pale face, sun Xiangfu was both distressed and angry, and said, \"you said it's not good for you to provoke anyone, but to provoke that Yama.\"\"I But he was not provoked. It was his nephew who had been deceiving others When sun Ling mentioned this, he was not angry. He told the truth of what happened last night. At last, he said, \"how do I know that Cheng Lishu will suddenly attack?\"\"Is that bookboy the woman you like?\" Sun Xiangfu asked.Sun Ling shook his head: \"I don't know. I haven't seen my face clearly. The surname Xiao is here.\"\"If it's just a misunderstanding, it's OK. If it's really this girl, Cheng Lishu will inevitably have prejudice against you since he protects him.\" Sun Xiangfu sighed, \"it's my fault that I didn't inform you of Xiao Jue's coming to the city in advance, otherwise it would not have caused such a situation.\"Sun Ling never cared about political affairs. He only knew how to eat, drink, whore and gamble. Therefore, he did not know about sun Xiangfu's post to Xiao Jue.\"Dad, we've already offended them. They won't make trouble for us later.\" Sun Ling was a little nervous.He was used to lawlessness in Liangzhou City, but because he had a magistrate Laozi. But last night sun Xiangfu's tearful appearance in front of Xiao Jue made sun Ling understand that Xiao Jue was not a person the sun family could afford.\"Don't be afraid,\" Sun Xiangfu said, \"in a few days, the censor yuan will be here. Mr. Yuan belongs to Xu Xiang. Xu Xiang and Xiao Jue Su are at odds. Maybe we can do something here. \"www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There is a red sugar gourd on the grass man, which makes him feel sweet. Heyan took out the last few copper plates, bought several strings with the peddler, and handed the largest one to Song Tao Tao: \"hungry? First, we'll have some of this cushion. When we get back to the inn, we'll have something good. \"Poor God, she's been thinking all the way. If Song Tao Tao wants to eat in a restaurant, what should she do if she doesn't have enough money? Fortunately, she ate too much in the morning, and the little girl was picky. She didn't want to eat anything. She just sat down and drank a few cups of tea, ate two cakes and used some copper plates.Song Taotao took the sugar gourd and looked at Heyan: \"it's hard for you today.\" after a pause, she added, \"in fact, there's nothing very easy to visit in Liangzhou City, and everything is just the same. If it wasn't for hiding from Mr. Xiao, I wouldn't let you stay with me so late.\"\"Ha?\" He Yan also took a bunch of sugar gourd and bit one in his mouth. The hawthorn was sour and sour, and the honey was sweet and sour. He Yan felt that he had not eaten such a childish thing for a long time. She asked, \"what? Don't you like governor Shaw\"It's not that I don't like it, it's just A little afraid. \" The little girl flat mouth, \"as if in front of him, everyone will become very inferiority.\"He Yan heard the music, inferiority? Song Tao Tao was so young. He Yan said with a smile, \"but he's good-looking and powerful. Don't all the girls like this?\"When he was young, many girls came to see Xiao Jue at the gate of Xianchang hall every day. He Yan had never seen any girl who didn't like him. Song Tao Tao was so special.\"I'm not like them.\" Song Tao Tao snorted, \"they only know how to look at their appearance, but such a cold person can't say sweet words. It will be very bad to live a life. I don't like it. I like it gentle, \"she said with a sigh of maturity.\" it's very good like that. It's a pity that he's married. \"Heyan a hawthorn in his mouth, almost choked.What? Xiao Jue also wanted to be the uncle of his niece and daughter-in-law, but he didn't know that what people wanted was to be his sister-in-law!Song Tao Tao deserves to be the one who almost became her \"little fiancee\". People are so different. He Yan said: \"in fact, governor Xiao is very gentle sometimes But there are few people like you who don't like him Her heart moved, and she wanted to get something out of Song Tao Tao's mouth. She asked, \"do you know general Feihong, who is as famous as him now, have you seen him?\"\"General Feihong?\" Song Tao Tao said, \"are you talking about the eldest son of the he family? The one who said that he couldn't see people because of his injuries on his face and wore a mask all day long? \"He Yan said:\"It's rare that he has been wearing a mask for ten years. I met him before I escaped from my marriage. At that time, he had taken off his mask and looked good. Do you know why he wears a mask Song Tao Tao asked.He Yan: \"why?\"\"It's natural to find a gimmick for yourself. You think, he did not take off his mask long before his majesty granted him the title of \"face saint\". It is said that it is necessary to meet a miracle doctor to help cure the scar on the face, but how can there be a miracle doctor to treat the scar, even a little scar can't be seen? Over the years, we all know that he is ugly and terrible. He suddenly takes off his mask and is a graceful young master. This is so strange that his original appearance of five points becomes seven points. \"Heyan couldn't help but applaud Song Tao Tao. It was reasonable. If she was not herself, or the person wearing the mask, she would have believed that Song Tao Tao was true.\"What do you think of general Feihong and commander Xiao?\"Song Tao Tao did not want to answer: \"of course, that is Xiao Er childe, he family that childe is not as good-looking as Xiao Er childe!\"OK, the way of the world is to judge people by their appearance.He Yan said in a bashful voice: \"I haven't seen general Feihong. I'm still the same surname as him. I've always wanted to see him with my own eyes. Do you have a chance in this life?\"\"Of course, there will be a chance, but he is highly valued by the emperor. Before I left Beijing, his majesty often called him into the palace. His cousin passed away before, but he didn't go to court for a few days. His majesty also gave a lot of things. \"He Yan's smile is a little reluctant: \"you said, but big grandmother Xu?\"\"Is she married to a man surnamed Xu? I don't know her name. I don't know her name. This elder sister was not in shuojing before. Few people knew her in the capital, and there were no familiar sisters. I knew that it was general Feihong's sister, who had been married for only one year, and she was blind because of a strange disease. When she was blind, she went to the garden in the mansion, but the servant did not notice and fell into the pond and drowned. \" Song Tao Tao sighed: \"what a pity. It is clear that there is general Feihong who is the supporter of this elder brother. He can't live a bad life. What's her name? What's her name? Well, I can't remember. \"He Yan thought that her name was he Yan. Unfortunately, this name was destined to be drowned in the name of general he Rufei of Feihong. What the world knows is that she was born weak and was brought up in Chuang Tzu, the younger sister of general Feihong. Her name, nobody remembers.\"What about Uncle Xu?\" He Yan asked, \"what happened to Xu after she died?\"\"I'm in the house on weekdays, and I don't like to hear about these things. I vaguely remember that the sisters mentioned that the husband of miss he was depressed for a while after the death of miss he's family. He was really affectionate. However, who knows about this kind of thing, \"said Song Tao Tao,\" when can a man's words be taken seriously? I can't say that I still remember today, but tomorrow I will welcome new people into the house. \"He Yan wryly smile: \"what you said is very reasonable.\"\"Why do you ask me all of a sudden?\" Song Tao Tao said, \"but I don't know much. If you really want to know, you should ask Mr. Xiao. They are both generals. They are colleagues, and they should know more than me.\"He Yan thought, that is not afraid of Xiao Jue suspicion? At present, she is no longer her own person. If you ask about the affairs of the he family, Xiao Jue is afraid that she can find out all her details. Don't want to find out what you haven't found out. If you are exposed to the identity of a woman, you can't even stay in the military camp. It's not worth the loss.He Yan and Song Tao Tao went upstairs. Song Tao Tao said, \"thank you very much today. I'll change my clothes and have a rest. You can eat with me.\"He Yan said with a smile: \"good.\"Although the girl had the habit of being a young lady and liked to give orders, she was not a nuisance. He Yan waited for her to leave, did not return to the room, knocked on the door next door.It was a good day. Someone in the room said, \"come in.\"As soon as he went in, he saw Xiao Jue sitting at the table. He was wiping the Guqin in front of him with a white silk. He Yan had a close look at it. It was the Wanxiang Qin that she had crushed.\"Governor, have you fixed the piano? Isn't it bad? \" He Yan approached and asked in a low voice.\"What's the matter?\" Xiao Jue said lazily I don't want to talk to her any more.He Yan took the hand on his back from behind: \"look! I went out today and brought you a gift! Although I'm shopping with Miss Song, I'm still thinking about you. This sugar gourd is for youXiao Jue glanced at the sugar gourd in her hand: \"take it away.\"He Yan said: \"don't, I've tasted it. It's sweet!\"\"I don't eat sweets.\" He said indifferently.He Yan looks at him, in the heart abdomen Fei, installs what attire. When we were together in the Xianchang hall, the man took a small sachet with him. At that time, the young man who was in love with him went to rob him. He protected it tightly. He Yan thought it was a wonderful treasure, but later he found out that it was a bag of sweet scented osmanthus.When he returned home two days a month, the sachet was full again. A young man who had been sweet scented osmanthus candy all the time told her that he didn't eat sweets. I'm afraid this person is not hating that it was bought with two copper plates?\"If you don't eat it, give it to brother feinu.\" He Yan put the sugar gourd into the pen holder on the table. He turned his head and softened his expression. He said with a flattering smile, \"governor, I have something else I want to discuss with you.\"Xiao Jue looked at her with no waves and no waves.Heyan brazenly continued: \"I'm going out with Miss Song today. Miss Song wants to buy clothes and jewelry. All the silver I got from the flag has been spent. I think Miss Song is your niece and daughter-in-law and your relative. I buy things for your relatives. Although I shouldn't pay for the money, I'm sincere to the governor. How can I make the governor spend money? That is I have no money now. If Miss Song wants to buy another one, can you give me some silver? I don't have money to go shopping, and I don't want to lose your face, do I? Uncle? UncleYoung smile is particularly flattering, a pair of eyes flashing bright, like a young fox. It is clear that they will bite people, but when they ask for food from people, they are particularly smart and docile.Xiao Jue looked at her coldly and was not moved.He Yan asked, \"is it OK?\"The man's answer was heartless: \"no way.\"\u201c\u2026\u2026 Not really? \" She was still reluctant.\"No way.\"He Yan straightened up and looked at him with hatred. When she joined the army in her last life, she had heard that the moment when a person really grew up was to borrow money. Heyan now deeply thought that she was so low three times. Xiao Jue was so rich that she didn't give it at all. He deliberately aimed at himself!Xiao Jue raised her head, looked calm, and scoffed: \"I still remember that I am not your uncle. Do you forget that Song Tao Tao is Cheng Lishu's fiancee, not yours.\"He Yan thought about this for half a moment before he understood. She said, \"you don't think I'm treating Miss Song...\"Xiao Jue drooped her eyes, continued to wipe the body, \"I hope you still remember who you are.\"He Yan almost scolded in his heart. Do you think this is human? Is Xiao Jue afraid of robbing Cheng Lishu's fiancee? Joke, if she hadn't left home on her own initiative, where did Cheng Lishu get this fiancee now? What's more, Xiao Jue wants to be his uncle. Do you know that the little girl wants to be his sister-in-law? What does he know?He Yan was angry in his heart and said with a smile: \"of course I remember who I am. I'm Heyan, who won the first place in Liangzhou Wei's flag competition.\" She bit the word \"first\" very heavily, and said, \"the governor is not willing to give money, that's all.\" She turned to go, and suddenly remembered something. She suddenly turned around and grabbed the sugar gourd on the table. \"Anyway, the governor doesn't like sweet food. I'd better take the candied gourd and eat it myself.\"She took a big bite out of her anger. She chewed it \"crunchy\" and walked out. She said vaguely: \"what commander in chief of the right army is an Iron Rooster with no hair...\"Xiao Jue:The flying slave just came in and heard such a sentence. Looking at the back of Heyan, he turned back and closed the door.Xiao Jue looked up at him.\"Young master, he...\"\"Nothing,\" interrupted Xiao Jue, \"can we have a harvest today?\"Fei Nu shook his head: \"He Yan has been with Miss Song er. He has not done anything on this day. He is just shopping and drinking tea on the street. He has never met anyone.\"Xiao Jue nodded: \"I know.\"\"Is it possible that the person he meets is not from Liangzhou city?\" Feinu asked, \"I always think he Yan is a little strange.\"His skill is different from that of ordinary people. He doesn't know how to use the array when he is a recruit, but he has not been caught. It can be seen that his attitude towards Xiao Jue is really bold. Ordinary people It won't be like this, will it?\"He's by my side, so he won't make a mistake. You tell chiwu to come here to meet someone. \"\"Young master, do you want chiwu to accompany Miss Song?\" Asked feinu.Xiao Jue nodded: \"Yuanbao town is coming to Liangzhou. Song Tao Tao is not suitable for the same trade. There will be no good meeting, there will be no good banquet, \"he said quietly.\" we have to be well prepared. \"Feinu said, \"I understand.\"\u2026\u2026The next few days, it was very comfortable.It was about the first day of wandering too long, Song Tao Tao's hand injury is not completely good, these days are too lazy to go out. Xiao Jue and Fei Nu are often absent in the daytime. He Yan can't leave Song Tao Tao alone in the inn, so he can only accompany him.The little girl is good at coaxing. She will listen carefully to the strange people and things she met when she joined the army. When I was tired, I could eat some food downstairs at will, and the day passed. He Yan wanted to go out with Xiao Jue and ask for some information. However, she was not taken with her. He was definitely anti foreign. After several times, he Yan was also a self-conscious person and was too lazy to move forward.This trip to Liangzhou is not very cost-effective. The only hope was that the censor yuan Baozhen. He Yan had never expected a person to come. Fortunately, after three days, the Lord yuan finally arrived in Liangzhou city.This morning, feinu brought a man over.This is also a young man dressed as a bodyguard. His name is chiwu. He should also be Xiao Jue's confidant. He came here to take Song Tao Tao away.\"You can't stay here for the time being. Chiu will take you to a safe place. It's about Liangzhou. I'll pick you up again. \" Xiao Jue road.Song Tao Tao looks at Heyan: \"that Is Mr. Cheng not with me? \"Another few people's eyes immediately toward He Yan, especially Xiao Jue, eyes light cold. He Yan immediately understood the meaning of \"deal with your own troubles\".She had no choice but to stand up and smile to Song Tao: \"I want to do something with Mr. Xiao. I can't accompany you for the time being. Don't worry, this Brother chiwu will protect you\"What's the matter? Is it dangerous?\" Song Tao Tao asked again.He Yan embarrassed, but also some moved, the child did not white pain, also know to ask her whether she is dangerous, she said with a smile: \"there is Xiao Er childe, not dangerous, not dangerous, you can rest assured.\"\"Then you must be careful.\" Song Tao Tao told her to go back to her step by step.He Yan looked back and saw Xiao Jue's sarcastic eyes. She said, \"I really didn't do anything...\"Xiao Jue turned around and left, and he Yan ran after him. \"Uncle, don't be upset. Although Miss Song only asked me whether I was safe or not, she didn't ask you because she thought you were too cold to get close to, and I was kind and gentle and likable. You should not take it into consideration!\"\"Shut up.\" Xiao Jue stopped, examined her from head to toe, and said, \"you have the mind to talk nonsense. You'd better think about how you can't help yourself at dinner. Cheng Lishu, no matter how you say it, is also the young master of zhilang's house. You, \"he gave her a meaningful glance:\" do you pretend to be like that? \"Put down this sentence, he will not return to go. He Yan Leng for a moment, just react to come over, this person laughed at her again. She roared at Xiao Jue's back: \"what's wrong with you Si zhilang?\"In the final analysis, she is also a young master from the he family. Who is not an official! She has been pretending to be the young master of a big family for so many years. What can't she do? Xiao Jue must be impressed tonight.\u2026\u2026Liangzhou city gate, a carriage in the crowd is particularly conspicuous.The carriage was decorated very ornately. On the outside, it was embroidered with fine embroidery, with large mountains and rivers. There is also a white crane in the grass. Its eyes are made of black crystal, which is particularly delicate and interesting.Someone lifted the curtain of the carriage and looked out, but for a moment it was lowered.Yuan Baozhen covered his nose with a handkerchief and said, \"the city of Liangzhou is really windy and dusty. It's far from the capital.\"He is now over 40, and in fact he is about the same age as sun Xiangfu. However, compared with sun Xiangfu, he is well maintained. The clothes are neat and exquisite, the face is white and unnecessary. When speaking, he has a smile of three points, which is very kind.\"What do you think Xiao Jue didn't come to such a place to ask for trouble?\" He asked the people around him.Beside him, there was also a bodyguard like man. He was mediocre in appearance and thin in stature. If it was not for the thick cocoon at the mouth of the palm, others would only think that he was an ordinary boy.\"I don't know.\" The guard replied.\"Well, I'll see him today anyway. When I see him, I'll ask him myself.\" Yuan Baozhen said with a smile, \"Hey, is it from the sun family coming in front?\"Sun Xiangfu came to meet him in person.Yuan Baozhen's face showed a little satisfied smile, \"not bad, not bad, this Sunzhi County, very polite.\"Sun Xiangfu looked at the stopped carriage and wiped his sweat. Although he could not neglect the imperial censor when he came to Liangzhou, he did not go to the gate of the city to meet him. But now he has offended Xiao Jue. If he offends Yuanbao town again, he will have no way to live. He also expected yuan Baozhen to support him and make Xiao Jue suffer. Naturally, we have to put out 120000 efforts to please the man in front of him.When Yuan Baozhen got out of the carriage, sun Xiangfu met him and said, \"if you come here, I'd like to meet you far away. If you neglect me, please don't blame me.\"\"No,\" Yuan Baozhen said with a smile, \"I see that Mr. Sun is very kind. You don't have to be so polite.\"The two joked for a while, and sun Xiangfu said, \"in this case, please come to your house and have a rest.\"Yuan Baozhen came to Liangzhou to live in sun's house for the time being. Together, they got on the carriage prepared by sun Xiangfu. On the carriage, Yuan Baozhen asked, \"I heard that the commander of the right army has arrived in Liangzhou, but I don't know if he can be in his house now?\"\"Governor Xiao is staying in the inn in Liangzhou city for the time being, saying that he has something important to do. I came to your house tonight. I have another thing to ask Mr. Yuan for help. \"Yuan Baozhen's eyes moved, but his smile was just like a talent. He only asked, \"what's the matter with Sunzhi county?\"\"It's about governor Xiao. My ungrateful son accidentally bumped into the nephew of governor Xiao before. I'm afraid that governor Xiao will be angry with me for this reason. Since we have held a banquet to meet Mr. Yuan tonight, I hope Mr. Yuan can make peace in it and solve the misunderstanding. \" Sun Xiangfu was embarrassed.Although he didn't say clearly what it was, Yuan Baozhen could guess something. A magistrate in Liangzhou who covers the sky with only one hand can raise a son who is not a kind person. Xiao Jue's nephew is the young master of Yousi zhilang. They have a conflict, but they are afraid that sun is doomed to suffer losses.He thought in his mind, but said on his mouth, \"I think Sunzhi county has taken this matter seriously. The governor Xiao was not unreasonable. He was not careful to collide with each other, so he could make it clear. How can you still remember the hatred in your heart? \"\"That's what it says,\" Sun Xiangfu wiped his sweat and said with a smile, \"but commander Xiao Didn't Zhao Nuo be dealt with in the same way at that time! \"As soon as he said this, Yuan Baozhen's face changed.At that time, the beheading of xiaojue stele hall, Zhao Nuo, the eldest son of the Minister of Hubu, was well known in the great Wei Dynasty. But time passed by too long, others thought he was young and vigorous, and then gradually forgot. Now when sun Xiangfu mentioned it, Yuan Baozhen remembered it again. When Zhao Nuo had an accident, the first person Zhao Shangshu found was actually Xu Xiang. Xu Xiang handed in the post. Zhao Shangshu went to the Jinluan hall and cried to his majesty. His Majesty was so sympathetic that he did not deal with Xiao Jue.\"If logging does not come from its origin, it will be revived; if water is not blocked from its source, it will flow back; if disaster is not destroyed from its base, chaos will be restored.\" At that time, Xu Xiangxiang only said such a sentence, \"this son is not removed, and it will become a great trouble to me in the future.\"All they wanted was to get rid of Xiao Jue as soon as he was young, but since he took the soldiers to Nanman, they never gave the chance to others. He grew up at an amazing speed, but in a few years, the man who killed Zhao Nuo was regarded as unreasonable by the world. If he goes to do these things again, others will find it unusual.This is what Xiao Jue has done in recent years.He is much more powerful than Xiao Zhongwu and much younger.\"Your honor, Lord yuan?\" Seeing that Yuan Baozhen had a different look and was silent, sun Xiangfu did not know why and spoke uneasily.\"Nothing. I just thought of something else.\" Yuan Baozhen said with a smile, \"since governor Xiao is coming to dinner tonight, I'll tell him for you, but I don't know the temperament of governor Xiao. If he doesn't listen to me, don't blame me.\"\"Where and where,\" Sun Xiangfu was grateful. \"Lord yuan is willing to open this mouth, and the lower officials are already very happy.\"Yuan Baozhen shook his head with a smile. His mind had already gone to other places.No matter how fierce Xiao Jue was, he came to Liangzhou just to get rid of this big trouble for Xu Xiang.I hope everything goes well.\u2026\u2026In the evening, he Yan is going out with Xiao Jue.They are going to sun Xiangfu's house, so they have to send Song Tao Tao away. Otherwise, when sun Ling sees Song Tao Tao Tao, or Song Tao Tao sees sun Ling, he may have something wrong.Cheng's dress is as lovely as that of Li's, but it's the same as that of Li's. She also picked a hairpin of the same color and stuck it on her head. She did not forget to take the folding fan, which was half opened across her chest. When she looked at the people in the bronze mirror, she felt quite satisfied.After finishing, he Yan just boasted about going out. When he went out, he saw Xiao Jue standing at the door.He also changed his clothes. It's a pair of crane brocade clothes with dark blue and dark patterns. Today, it's not wearing a gold crown. It's only a red sandalwood hairpin. It's a simple piece of Qing Dynasty. If you look carefully, the material and embroidery are all excellent. He was born to be particularly beautiful, such a dress, then a little less apathy, more a trace of Yingxiu, jade metallography, is really a noble and elegant gentleman.He Yan thought that the original bright and beautiful boy had finally grown into such a beautiful man. He looked as if he had not changed. He seemed to be totally different from the past.Xiao Jue a side, on is He Yan slightly some daze of vision, he hook hook lip, way: \"wipe your saliva clean.\"He Yan subconsciously wiped, and then came back to God: \"where is there?\"\"You look like a fool.\" He was disgusted both inside and outside of his words. \"Do you want to hide from Yuan Baozhen?\"Hearing this, he Yan was not convinced. \"Shua\" unfolded the folding fan. She went to Xiao Jue and said in a low voice, \"if I am in shuojing, I dare not mention the governor. At least I should be compared with Mr. Cheng. Otherwise, why did miss song tell me instead of you when she left? \"Young eyes and eyebrows are smiling, eyes bright as stars, but still can't stop foolishness, Xiao Jue mocked: \"because you are stupid.\"\"What?\"\"Stupid people always need a lot of reminders.\"He Yan frowned, \"uncle, do you particularly hate me?\" Can this man die if he doesn't run for a day?\"You are my nephew. How can I hate you?\" Xiao Jue glanced at her like a smile and told the flying slave, \"go.\"www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

All the houses around were big and beautiful. Xiao Jue didn't like to take a bus, so they went on a horse together. Feinu didn't follow. He didn't know where. He did not protect the second Miss song like chiwu, nor did he go to the banquet with Xiao Jue. Heyan guessed that he had gone to help Xiao Jue.Without feinu, he Yan and Xiao Jue were left alone. Although Fei Nu was reticent, he Yan could still connect with him. Alone with Xiao Jue, he Yan is inexplicably nervous. Fortunately, they did not have to say anything on horseback. They had already arrived at the gate of sun's residence after three incense sticks.When the boy at the gate of sun's mansion saw them, he should have received sun Xiangfu's notice in advance. He immediately approached them warmly and said, \"this should be governor Xiao? This is Mr. Cheng? The master is waiting in the front hall He took the horses of Xiao Jue and Heyan, and ordered another maid: \"yingyue, take commander Xiao and childe Cheng in.\"The maidservant named yingyue was also very beautiful. She had already been in September, and the autumn night was chilly. However, she only wore a thin gauze dress. If she didn't wear it, she still had an extra layer. If she said that, what could it cover? He Yan almost couldn't help but put on a dress for the girl. The men in their barracks once said that when they were young, they often wore shirtless. When they were old, they would inevitably have leg pain and low back pain. Why?Yingyue opened her mouth, and her voice was graceful. If Huangying came out of the valley, \"governor, please follow your servant.\" One side said, a pair of affectionate eyes staring at Xiao Jue's eyes, delicate can drip water.Even if he Yan is a fool, he also knows that the maid is looking at Xiao Jue. Well, after all, there are not many girls like Song Tao Tao. People in the world are ordinary people. Xiao Jue's face is quite bluffing. He Yan should have expected that there are so many girls he loves.However, if you want to drop flowers, Lang's heart is like iron. Xiao Jue doesn't look at the maid. Instead, she glances at Heyan and says in a cold voice, \"what's wrong?\"\"Ah?\" He Yan returned to God and saw that he had gone forward, so he quickly followed. The heart way this person really has the disease, puts the flowery girl not to look, seeks her stubble to do what?The two men entered the gate of sun's house with the maid.The repair of sun's house is very luxurious.He Yan has not seen the houses of the officials in Beijing, and that's it. Although he's family can't compare with the Xiao family, it's also an official. It can be named in shuojing. Sun's house is as good as he's in repairing. But this is not shuojing, but Liangzhou. Sun Xiangfu is not a Beijing official, but a magistrate.Three years of Qing Zhixian, 100000 snowflakes silver. This is true, he Yan looked at those stone bonsai, glazed jade tiles, do not feel in the heart of surprise. How can a magistrate's salary afford these things? Sun Xiangfu did not know how much people's fat and cream had been looted. It's also true that sun Ling's virtue shows that the sun family's father and son have done a lot of evil in Liangzhou. They are almost half local emperors.She thought to herself, but she didn't know what she looked like, and was seen in the eyes of the people around her.Xiao Jue's eyes moved.Young people wearing Cheng Lishu's clothes are not as naive as Cheng Lishu. Although people depend on clothes and horses on saddles, a recruit at the bottom of the line will show his horse's feet in any case when he tries to install a young master of a rich family. What you have done and who you have seen will be engraved in your body and become a clear mark.Everyone's traces are different.He Yan's eyes are full of emotion and meditation, but there is no shrinking and nervous. If you do this for the first time and go to such a place, you can't say that.Just at this time, yingyue had stopped and rushed to the head of Li: \"master, governor Xiao and childe Cheng are here.\"All of a sudden, sun Xiangfu's exaggerated voice rang out inside: \"commander Xiao is coming! I'm afraid that the governor and the young master will not come. If you come, just come! \"He Yan raised his eyes and looked at him. He was not afraid of being laughed at when he was an official. He was not afraid of being laughed at.Sun Xiangfu did not wait for Xiao Jue to speak, but turned around to reveal the people behind him. He said with a smile, \"Lord yuan has arrived.\"Is this Yuanbao town? He Yan looks at him. Then I saw a middle-aged man with a white face smiling at them. In a flash, it overlapped with what he Yan remembered.When she first met yuan Baozhen, she was outside the study of the he family. At that time, he Rufei had gone to get meritorious service, took off his mask and became \"general Feihong\". As a young lady of the second room of the he family, she is waiting to marry into the Xu family. When she saw this man, she was still stunned for a moment. She didn't expect he Rufei to make friends with him so soon.She later asked who he Rufei was. He Rufei said that he was Yuanbao Town, the censor of today's censor.\"What are you going to do with him?\" He Yan just said it casually at that time.He Rufei looked at her with a strange smile. He said, \"what you need to do now is to embroider your wedding dress, not to take care of these things. He Yan, \"he approached a little, and his voice was unpredictable, which he could not understand.\" you have to remember that you are a lady of the second room of the he family and a woman now. \"He Yan doesn't think so. She can't embroider, and the wedding dress is not embroidered by her. She also understood the meaning of he Rufei's words. He Rufei was warning her not to get in touch with general Feihong.Is it for fear of being discovered? He Yan sneers in his heart and laughs that at that time, she didn't find the numerous murders in he Rufei's words.Now, seeing her cousin's friend, how can she get the news she wants?Without waiting for Heyan to think clearly, Yuan Baozhen had already stepped forward and bowed to Xiao Jue: \"governor.\" Then he looked at Heyan and said, \"is this Mr. Cheng?\"He Yan stares at him, showing a surprised smile: \"Mr. Yuan.\"\"I've heard that Mr. Cheng is a young man of great valour and extraordinary talent. Now I see him, and it's not surprising.\" Yuan Baozhen said with a smile: \"sure enough, heroes are young!\"He Yan said:Isn't Cheng Lishu a famous \"Junzi\" in Beijing? Thanks to what the man said, I understood that the first thing to do in the Wei Dynasty was to learn the ability to \"talk to people and talk to ghosts\".He Yan had no choice but to say, \"flatter, flatter. Shame on youSun Xiangfu rubbed his hands and said, \"governor, I have an unkind invitation.\"Xiao Jue: what's upWhen you were a kid, didn't you Sun Xiangfu was very upset. \"Although he was taught a lesson by the lower official, the child felt very guilty and wanted to apologize to the governor and the young master himself. Since he knew he was wrong, he thought, he would ask the governor with his old face, so that the unfilial son could have an opportunity to apologize. \"\"Anyone who is not a sage can be faultless,\" Yuan Baozhen said with a smile: \"besides, this is just a misunderstanding. Just untie the misunderstanding, and the governor will not care about it. You should ask young master sun to come over and clarify with governor Xiao. \"\"Really?\" Sun Xiangfu excitedly told the boy, \"go and call the young master to come here.\"He Yan saw that the two of them were singing a song and a duel. He had finished the trick himself without asking Xiao Jue. He knew that the two people had already discussed in advance. It seems that Yuan Baozhen is the same as sun Xiangfu. What kind of person can he be as good as he Rufei?Sun Ling seemed to be waiting outside the hall. Soon after this, she came in with her maid. \"Yan he almost bit his tongue.This man was very arrogant and arrogant before. Now, just a few days later, he looked haggard. The whole person seemed to be seriously ill. He dressed very simply. He saluted Xiao Jue and said weakly, \"I didn't understand before. I had a dispute with Mr. Cheng. Now I know that I'm wrong. I hope the governor and Mr. Cheng can forgive me for being young and frivolous. I'm determined to make a new start Change, never again. \"Young frivolity is this used? Look at him, he is not young. Heyan didn't believe that this man could never commit any more crimes in a few days. She looked at Xiao Jue. Xiao Jue was indifferent, neither saying good nor bad. The atmosphere was frozen for a moment.He Yan still wants to fight this round. Anyway, it's all opera singing. If the opera is not sung, will it be embarrassing at the banquet? She looked at Sun Ling's hair with a smile and said, \"what's the point? It's just a misunderstanding that day, so don't worry about it. Even if you don't recognize the wrong person in the future, it's OK to meet my uncle and me this time. If you meet someone who is arbitrary, even if you apologize a hundred times, you will not get the result. \"As soon as he spoke, sun Xiangfu was relieved. He quickly scolded sun Ling and said, \"thank you, Mr. Cheng. Mr. Cheng is younger than you, and he has more prospects than you! \" He probably didn't have to boast about it either. He left it dry and said, \"learn more from Mr. Cheng in the future.\"Sun Ling and he Yan quickly said a pile of good words, listen to He Yan overnight meal will vomit out. She really does not like to listen to these words, this fake, really can bluff people?Sun Ling went back to his house after singing the drama of \"the magistrate pleaded guilty to the emperor\". According to his father, sun Ling had a family law last time when he went home. He was seriously ill and couldn't get out of bed. Today, he came to Xiao Jue to plead with him. Now that sin is over, I have to go back to bed.He Yan said with a smile: \"that young master sun go quickly, don't want to hurt the body.\"He was afraid that something might happen at the banquet. After all, his son looked like a troublemaker.After sun Ling left, sun Xiangfu said, \"please take a seat, and so do Mr. Cheng. When it's a little later, there will be singing and dancing in the mansion. Then we will join in the banquet and dance.\"Heyan sat down next to Xiao Jue, and then sun Xiangfu spoke. It's nothing special. It's just asking if he Yan and Xiao Jue are used to living in Liangzhou city. The weather in Liangzhou city recently After all, they were meaningless greetings.He Yan's mind has always been in Yuan Baozhen.Yuan Baozhen and he Rufei should be regarded as friends, right? At least she saw yuan Baozhen in and out of the he family more than once. And he Yuansheng and his son's attitude is not like nodding acquaintance. So this time Yuanbao town came to Liangzhou, can he know? It must be known. If he is a good friend, maybe he will practice it before he leaves. What is the situation of he family in the near future? If he is not planning for the next period of time, Yuan Baozhen should also know clearly.But how can yuan Baozhen talk so much with her \"Cheng Lishu\"?He Yan was so distracted that he forgot to cover up his eyes. Yuan Baozhen was not an ordinary person. After a scan, he realized that he Yan had been staring at himself. He didn't say anything. He still listened to sun Xiangfu's words with a smile. Occasionally, he added two sentences, which seemed normal at a glance.After a while, it was completely dark. Sun Xiangfu stood up and said with a smile, \"I see the time is almost up. Let's go to the hall for a banquet.\"She is on the right side of Yan Baohe and sun Xiaohe. He Yan thought about he Rufei, and his eyes fell on Yuan Baozhen.She was thinking about something. Suddenly, Yuan Baozhen turned to him. He was a man of officialdom and had many prefectures. Now he stopped laughing. His eyes twinkled with dazzling light, which was really frightening. He captured Heyan.He Yan's heart was startled. Before he could speak, he felt that his arm was gently pulled by others. At the next moment, a person was standing in front of her.Xiao Jue's cold voice fell into her ears: \"take a good look at the road.\"She was surprised to see that Xiao Jue was higher than her. In this way, Yuan Baozhen's frightening eyes were completely blocked by him and could not be seen at all. Xiao Jue is also looking at each other, curved the corner of his lips, \"Yuan adult has been staring at my nephew as what?\"Yuan Baozhen was stunned for a moment, then laughed, and said, \"no, the governor is probably looking at the chasm.\" He turned and stopped looking at Heyan, as if what had just happened was just a trivial joke.Xiao Jue continued to go forward, he Yan Zheng for a moment, followed up. There is something strange in the heart, that sentence \"my nephew\", although it refers to Cheng Lishu, but it is her that is protected. She has not had this feeling for a long time.Maybe, never.When he got to the hall, the banquet had been set up, and there were long and short seats set up everywhere. Heyan sat down next to Xiao Jue. The middle hall is empty for the next song and dance. He Yan didn't really understand why such a banquet should invite beautiful girls to sing and dance? Only the real people can disdain it.But Sun Xiangfu is not really everyone after all.Looking at the dishes on the table, he Yan can't help but wonder, such as Xianglong Shuangfei, bergamot golden roll, Phoenix Tail shark fin, ganlianfu sea cucumber. In the capital city of Sanpin official's residence, the banquet is like this. It seems that the sun family's life is very nourishing.She turned her head to see Xiao Jue again. It has to be said that Xiao Jue has a cold face on weekdays. Neither can this or that. Once he comes to the banquet and sits lazily, he will be less indifferent, and his inner idleness will be outlined. He Yan suddenly remembered that this man was the real young master in the capital city. He used to go to a reception today, and to have a good night tomorrow. The young master was very well behaved. In this way, he immediately had the shadow of Xiao's young master at the banquet.\"What do you think I'm doing?\" Xiao Shao's mouth was hooked, his voice was low, and he Yan's ear was in a low voice. \"Be careful to expose the stuffing.\"He Yan gently coughed, \"I was surprised by my uncle's demeanor, just distracted for a moment.\"She is used to flattering, inexplicable words open mouth to come, Xiao Jue also lazy to pay attention to her. At this time, Yuan Baozhen opened his mouth and said, \"the relationship between governor Xiao and childe Cheng is excellent.\"\"It's good to be my own.\" Xiao Jue's reply is not salty.Yuan Baozhen was just trying to find a way to talk, but of course he didn't care about Xiao Jue's attitude. He picked up the wine cup on the table and said with a smile, \"I always don't understand that in the cold and bitter land of Liangzhou, governor Xiao is better in shuojing than here. Why would he come to Liangzhou to garrisonHe Yan hears the speech, move in the heart, she is also curious about this question. Xiao Jue is now the commander in chief of the right army, and the whole Nanfu soldiers are in his hands. There is no need to bring a new soldier here. He Yan thought he had been demoted, but his arrogance in front of sun Xiangfu didn't seem to be demoted.Xiao Jue took a look at Yuan Baozhen. Instead of answering his question, Xiao Chueh asked, \"why does yuan Yushi think I am?\"How did the man kick the ball back.Yuan Baozhen was also a fierce man. His smile did not change at all. He immediately used the ability that everyone in the officialdom had to possess. He said: \"I think the governor must be worried about the difficulty of new recruits. He may not be able to take good care of other generals. The governor has never been afraid of hardship, so he volunteered to come to Liangzhou to garrison.\"After a long time, Xiao Jue said, \"really?\" He asked casually: \"the imperial historian means that I think it's a good thing for me to come to Liangzhou?\"\"Of course.\"Xiao Jue glanced at him and said indifferently with a smile: \"I didn't think yuan Yushi was going to say that.\"\"Oh?\" Yuan Baozhen asked with a smile, \"what is the meaning of governor Xiao?\"\"At the end of the day, there is no end to the end.\" He said with profound meaning, \"isn't it because of this that Lord Yuan went to Liangzhou in person?\"The atmosphere suddenly solidified, sun Xiangfu did not dare to say a word, carrying his tail. Yuan Baozhen's smile almost couldn't hold on. Heyan looked at Xiao Jue from the side of his head. He couldn't help calling Xiao Jue a good word.You flatter me. I compliment you. It's really meaningless. It's all lies. There's nothing useful at the end of a party. It seems that the second young master Xiao is so powerful that he makes others speechless.The hidden mystery of the banquet should have been so candid on the table!Yuan Baozhen stopped for a moment and then said with a smile, \"governor Xiao is really a joker. I came to Liangzhou, but I was ordered to inspect.\"Xiao Jue is not sure.\"I don't know how well the new soldiers in the governor's office are practicing?\" Yuan Baozhen asked again, \"is there a strong army?\"Xiao Jue looked at him with a smile: \"this is also one of the contents of Yuan Yushi's inspection tour?\"Although yuan Baozhen had heard of Xiao Jue's reputation in the past and met him face to face, it was the first time that he really sat down to talk. Therefore, for the first time, he really experienced the unruly of this young general. It's no wonder that killing Zhao Nuo didn't work at all. Just sitting down with this young master and talking, he was already exhausted physically and mentally.He used to keep the smile, for the first time, some of them couldn't keep on, only saying, \"I care and care.\"\"I'm afraid yuan Yushi is concerned about more than Liangzhou recruits,\" Xiao Jue said slowly. \"Nanfu soldiers, nine flag battalion, should we care about them together?\"Yuan Baozhen couldn't answer that.Sun Xiangfu looked left and then saw that both of them were the people he could not afford. However, he could not let such a good banquet be filled with such swords and swords, so he came out uneasily and made a round. \"I said, the two adults have said they are tired. Why don't you stop and enjoy the song and dance? Have something to eat. This wine is grape spring. It's new. Have a taste. \" He told his maid, \"call yingyue quickly.\"After a while, several beautiful girls stepped into the hall. The first one was the maidservant who had just brought him into the hall. At this time, she changed her clothes again. The red dress was embroidered with plum blossoms. Her sleeves were long and she was made up again. She was just a delicate beauty. At this time, she looked at Xiao Jue affectionately.There are so many people sitting here together. Heyan doesn't say that Yuan Baozhen is also an official. The girl only stares at Xiao Jue to see what's going on? Is that too clear a goal? He Yan thought in his mind, went to see Xiao Jue, and saw that his eyes were cold as ice, not moved at all.Heyan thinks that his eyes on feinu are softer than those on this girl. Is there something wrong with Xiao Jue, such as hating women?She thought like this, yingyue had already taken the rest of the maids, Yingying saluted, and said, \"the maids have made a fool of themselves.\" Everlasting longing for each other,played the Zheng girl. It's a beautiful piece of music. Here, Heyan is a girl. Xiao Jue is not interested in singing and dancing at all. Xiao Jue has just said that Yuan Baozhen has already gone to other places. Sun Xiangfu is the only one who is most satisfied.Sun Xiangfu himself probably has a lot of affection for this dancer, but the girl who reflects the moon may also be a judge by her appearance. The long sleeves are all in the direction of Xiao Jue. Flattering eyes can be crisp to people's bones, but every time they are facing Mr. Xiao.He Yan was bored and counted. Yingyue threw five eyes at Sun Xiangfu, three at Yuan Baozhen, seventeen on Xiao Jue, and none on himself.She is still at the bottom of the list. Why do you look down on people?Go to the banquet, but also with such a blow to people's self-confidence. He Yan's mind, may not blame her, who told her to wear the wrong clothes today? The color is black.She stretched out her chopsticks and took a snack. This is sun Xiangfu's family dinner. Maybe sun Xiangfu didn't have the courage to poison it. Heyan tasted it and the taste was good.Just a song, the moon's forehead exudes bright sweat, beauty sweat, more delicate and moving, her face red, salute to the public.\"Good, good, good!\" Only sun Xiangfu was watching the dance carefully. He clapped his hands and said, \"wonderful! What do you think? \"Naturally, Xiao Jue would not answer him. Yuan Baozhen just laughed, and Heyan said, \"if it's really hard to drive out the fragrance of heaven, it's gorgeous!\"\"Do you think so?\" Sun Xiangfu looked as excited as if he had found a confidant. \"How about giving yingyue to Mr. Cheng?\"Can this work? He Yan body a stiff, wave hand way: \"can't no, no, I already have fiancee, I'm afraid it's not right.\"\"Ah.\" Sun Xiangfu said, \"it's a pity at once.\"Now, when officials go to a banquet, they are still in a fashion to give each other a selagine at any time? Is there something wrong? He Yan was feeling strange, so he heard sun Xiangfu say with a smile: \"yingyue, you go to serve commander Xiao.\"He Yan said:She suspected that the Wanhua pavilion was not opened by this Sunzhi county. Otherwise, the tone and manner of this speech would make her look like a pimp. Even if she is a pimp, she should have eyes. Can't ordinary people see that Xiao Jue's whole body is written with refusal in every inch of her body?Some people are blind, but in fact the mirror is clear. Some people can see, but he is blind.Fortunately, this yingyue girl also knows how to behave. She doesn't do anything stupid to touch her hand. She just stands beside Xiao Jue and serves him with food.There is also a maid beside him who is preparing food for her. When she looks up, she sees yuan Baozhen sitting on the opposite side of her, but behind him is not a maid, but a bodyguard.Strange, is he the one who hates women?He Yan looked at the bodyguard behind him. He was bored. At first glance, he felt that the blood was almost frozen and the whole person was frozen in place.Even in the bodyguards, he was thin and short, and his facial features were extremely mediocre. He was hiding behind Yuanbao town and was almost in darkness. It was hard to detect such a person. He never said a word. Since he saw yuan Baozhen, he Yan didn't notice him. At the moment, he was struck by lightning.In an instant, all the banquet dishes on the table were gone, and the scenery was like a horse's-eye view, and quickly went back to that day. She was sitting in the Xu family's house, and her servant girl gave her a bowl of soup and medicine. She said that it was cooked by the kitchen specially to fill her body. She only hoped that she would be pregnant with lin'er as soon as possible, so as to provide some food for the Xu family.The scenery was just right and the sun was shining. She sat at the table and looked out of the window. She saw a man who looked like a little boy passing by. The maid laughed and explained that the medicine for making soup today was from this boy.This is he Rufei's boy and he's family.He Yan was newly married at that time. Although he was occasionally lost because of Xu Zhiheng, he didn't pay attention to it. He still had a trace of warmth towards his family. Never thought, this sent tonic medicine, to her eyes.It was the last time she saw the sun in her previous life. The next day, she had a high fever, and then she was blind.It was only a very short glance, but she had already remembered the man's face in her heart. Now, even though he was dressed as a bodyguard and followed Yuan Bao Zhen, she could see it at a glance.\"Let's have a drink.\" Sun Xiangfu raised his glass and said with a smile.The sparkling wine was poured into the white jade cup. She saw the man on her side holding the cup close to her lips. In a moment, all kinds of past things appeared in front of her. He Yan was extremely afraid. He felt that the previous scene was about to repeat. Under the combination of surprise and anger, she cut off the wine cup in Xiao Jue's hand.\"Don't drink it!\"www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 95": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth of a Star GeneralCH 95Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Don't drink it!\"Her voice, like a sword, with a bloody shrill, suddenly interrupted the feast.It was at this time that the accident happened.Yingyue, standing by Xiao Jue's side, is holding a wine pot in her hand. She has just poured the wine and has not had time to take it back. He Yan's voice just fell, as if he had got some signal. In the blink of an eye, the pot of wine showed the shape of a dagger. Without hesitation, he stabbed Xiao Jue.The young man looked calm and did not see half panic. He flew straight away with the jade lamp in his hand. He collided with the dagger in the air, smashed into pieces, and stopped to rush to his own knife point.All at once, the sound of the wind rose from all sides. The beautiful women who had just Sung and danced did not all step back. They all split up, and then they all rushed to Xiao Jue. It was a well planned murder.\"Uncle!\" He Yan called, but when he saw the young man slapping the table, the sword fell into his hands and was surrounded by about ten people. He only told him in a cold voice: \"stay away from me!\"Sun Xiangfu seemed to be stunned by the sudden change, so he hugged his head and hid under the long table. He still called out: \"come on, come on, come on --\"however, Heyan was paying attention to the bodyguards behind Yuan Bao town. She thought that he was he Rufei's person, and she was afraid that he would come after Yuan Bao town. However, he was so frightened and angry that he only cared about the wine on the table I thought the women around were assassins. Yuan Baozhen, protected by the guards behind him, stepped back a few steps, looking flustered.The guard didn't do it.Is today's assassin a coincidence? He Yan thought so in his heart. Looking at Xiao Jue who was surrounded in the middle, he almost got angry.The assassins are all women. The women who just came to the stage to dance or the women who play the zither are all light. They look warm and soft, but they start with vicious moves. There are sleeve arrows hidden in the sleeve. When the water sleeve blows, those concealed weapons fly towards Xiao Jue.No big night banquet, only Xiao Jue with one as ten. He Yan had been on the battlefield in his previous life, and was open and aboveboard in his present martial arts competition. He never saw such a dirty and private means. He was filled with indignation for a moment. When he saw the knife on the table used to cut the roast deer meat, he grabbed it and rushed into the crowd.\"Uncle, I'll help you!\"Now, when it comes to \"half of Yan Shuoli's words\", how can he think of himself as a waste? She was afraid that she could not show her martial arts in an open and aboveboard manner. She was thinking of turning and exclaimed, \"how can these people's sleeves be so long? I can't even see you! \" While speaking, he grabbed a woman's sleeve, a dagger stroke, and the water sleeve broke in response to the sound.The water sleeve turns into a short sleeve in an instant. If you move the concealed weapon, the action will be obvious. He Yan yelled and whirled in the crowd. She was light and slippery like loach. Everyone wanted to catch her, but he couldn't catch her. But seeing the boy scream and scold, he made the scene a little funny.Xiao Jue swung the woman's knife in front of her with a sword and glanced at her.He Yan is still shouting: \"help, kill!\" He blocked the dart and kicked the woman's face.Xiao Jue puffed at the corner of her mouth.The target of those singing girls was Xiao Jue. All the vicious means and concealed weapons were aimed at Xiao Jue. Suddenly, they broke into such a young man, and they were all disturbed. \"The moon, may hate,\" he said Straight to Heyan's tianlinggai.He Yan \"ah ah\" a cry, hide behind Xiao Jue, while calling \"Uncle save me\", while surprised.These ten or so women, all of whom have extraordinary skills, can not be practiced overnight. Instead, these techniques are like death soldiers trained to kill people.Who did Xiao Jue offend? To kill him by such means?Among these women, the highest means is to reflect the moon, but it is not the highest. In fact, there are countless hidden weapons in her hands, such as jujube stone arrow, plum blossom needle, Emei thorn, iron lotus He Yan didn't know how to put so many concealed weapons in her sleeve. However, Xiao Jue didn't seem to want this person's life, and the tip of his sword avoided the crucial point.He Yan knew that when he was young, he had excellent swordsmanship and excellent skills. Now he met again after a long separation. It was such a scene when he saw him fight for the first time. The assassin was unable to get close to him. All of them were hurt by drinking the autumn sword. When he pulled yingyue's sleeve and turned his arm, yingyue was pulled forward. The next moment, the tip of his sword pointed to yingyue's throat.The voice of the youth is low, as if it is more pleasant than the music of the piano just now. It contains the killing intention that can not be concealed, and it is fierce and pressing.\"Who sent you?\"He Yan can't help but go to see the bodyguards behind yuan Baozhen.The bodyguard was in front of Yuanbao Town, and his face, which had just been hidden in the dark, appeared at the moment. His expression was also very flustered, as if he did not expect this to happen, and he did not see any clue. However, he Yan saw that his fingers and index fingers slowly curved into a semicircle.No one will pay attention to a guard at this time. The movement of that finger is extremely small. If he Yan had not been paying attention to him, it would have been ignored.Years of intuition made her subconsciously look back, but saw the gatekeeper who had been holding his head and hiding several times at the door, rushed to Xiao Jue.\"Be careful!\"Xiao Jue is pointing at yingyue. Heyan doesn't care about other things. He pushes Xiao Jue away with one hand. The man jumps forward and is stabbed in the throat by Xiao Jue.Those who have been assassinating are women. Who will notice this boy? Moreover, from the first moment of the accident, this man was like all the servants who had no strength to bind a chicken, and hid in a few short places. Who would have expected him to be the last piece.\"What can I do for you?\" Xiao Jue twisted her eyebrows and asked her.He Yan shook his head.The moon on the ground suddenly laughed.Her smile was particularly harsh in the silence. He Yan turns his head and looks at the beauty with blood on her lips, but her expression is fierce.He Yan stepped forward and asked, \"who are you? Why do you want my uncle? \"Yingyue looks at Heyan with a fierce look: \"if you didn't come out to stir up the game, why should we be here today?\"! You will never know who my master is... \"She coughed more and more blood on her lips, and her blood was also abnormal black. If you look at the women around her, it's the same. He Yan will be clear. If he is really a dead man, he will die if he fails to assassinate him.\"Is it?\" Xiao Jue looked at yingyue and suddenly chuckled with his eyes. He said, \"there are countless people in the world who want to kill me. But there is only one who is so anxious. \"\"I'll take this gift from your master. I hope you can afford my returnYingyue's face changed dramatically. But she had already taken the poison, but for a moment, her face turned pale. Like the other ten or so women, she died and lost her breath.Xiao Jue stepped over her body and stood in the hall. Looking at Sun Xiangfu, who was shivering in fear, he said, \"Sunzhi County, you may as well explain why you set up a banquet, and the maid in the mansion will assassinate me. Are you trying to murder me? \"Sun Xiangfu had already scared his brain into a paste. Hearing the speech, he almost burst into tears. Seeing that the assassins were all over, he dared to step down from the height to explain: \"governor, I really don't know, I really don't know! Lend me ten courage, I dare not murder you! These singers were brought back to my residence half a month ago. I I didn't know it was an assassin! Mr. Yuan, Mr. Yuan, please help me to explain. I really don't know what's going on here! \"Yuan Baozhen, who had never said a word, came back to his mind, patted his chest, and said, \"Sunzhi County, this is not a matter of whether you know it or not. These singers are all from your family. If there is something wrong with governor Xiao today, you can't get rid of it. I don't think it's as simple as it seems on the surface. I'd better tidy up here first and let's have a look at where these people come from and what their identities are. \"He looked at Xiao Jue again: \"governor Xiao is also shocked. It's better to clean up and change places and listen to Sunzhi county to tell us what's going on. I think these singers are just prepared. \"Xiao Jue looked at him like a smile and said, \"OK.\"The banquet stopped abruptly in the middle of the night, but at the moment, it was obvious that everyone had no mood to continue. There was a mess in the hall, and the Yamen servants came quickly to carry away the singer girl's body. Yuan Baozhen asked, \"do you want to search them for any keepsakes?\"\"Since I have been to sun's house for half a month, the keepsake has already been hidden. How could it be left on my body and wait for someone to search for it. Really, I'm afraid it's also to blame others, \"Xiao Jue stared at Yuan Bao Town and said faintly:\" don't get caught in the trap. \"Yuan Baozhen had a tight scalp.Xiao Jue didn't pay attention to him any more. When she turned her head, she saw he Yan standing in the same place. Suddenly, she remembered that she had not spoken much since she had just started.Scared?\"What are you doing? Let's go.\" He said to He Yan. As soon as he finished, he felt his sleeve pulled out.\"Uncle,\" said the young man, looking up at his face, which was always smiling. There was no smile on his face. He was very nervous. His eyes were also confused and fell on his face, as if he had not looked at him. He said: \"just when the little boy rushed over, I pushed you away. He threw a handful of things on my face, and my eyes hurt a little,\" her voice was small, and there was no previous flying, a little flustered, \"I can't see.\"\u2026\u2026The doctor went in one by one and came out soon. His expression was terrified. Everyone shook his head and sighed.Xiao Jue's face became more and more heavy.Sun Xiangfu watched with horror. Who could have thought that Xiao Jue's nephew, the teenager who followed Xiao Jue's side, would be hurt by assassins? The doctor could only take a look at his eyelids. The young man only said that he could not see. There was no miracle doctor in Liangzhou city. All the doctors that could be found were found. There was no way.The powder on the ground has been blown away by the wind, and there is no trace left. Even the poison is unknown. How can it be solved. Fortunately, only his eyes were injured, and the rest of the place was OK. Otherwise, if his life was hurt, I didn't know how the governor would be furious.\"Commander in chief,\" Sun Xiangfu Nuo said, \"I'm going to ask a famous doctor again. The young master and the lucky man have their own natural features. They will certainly be OK.\"Xiao Jue: \"get out of here.\"The anger in the words could be heard by anyone. Sun Xiangfu did not dare to offend Xiao Jue at this juncture. He said a few words in a hurry and retreated like fleeing for his life.Xiao Jue stood outside the house for a moment and then went inside. As he passed by the last doctor, he saw the young man sitting on the couch with a calm expression and did not know what he was thinking. A moment later, he used his hands to make gestures in front of him, as if he would not believe that he could not see.Because of her pain, the doctor did not dare to use any medicine, only found some soothing and cool herbs applied on the clean cloth, with the cloth tied to the eyes.Heyan has always been smiling. Sometimes he is smart and sometimes he is stupid. As for whether he is really stupid or pretending to be stupid, nobody knows. His eyes are very clever, clear and clear. When staring, they are a bit silly. When they are bent, they are full of vigor and cunning. Now the cloth covered her eyes, and in an instant, the young man's face became strange, and his vivid expressions in the past seemed to be blurred.Xiao Jue suddenly remembered that he Yan had not wavered when yingyue and his party were assassinating at the banquet. Even if he Yan didn't mention the wine, he would not drink it. But in the cry of the youth at that time, fear and anger didn't seem to be fake.It's even frightening to hear it.He went inside and came to the collapse of Heyan.He Yan seems to be aware of it, but it seems to be uncertain. He looks on his side and asks carefully, \"is someone coming?\"Xiao Jue did not speak.\"No one?\" She murmured again, and turned her head to be quiet.This way into Liangzhou City, he Yan dialect is really a lot. If Xiao Jue doesn't talk to her, she goes to find feinu. Fei Nu didn't speak much, and the Song Tao Tao appeared later. A person who often chirps, suddenly quiet up, is not used to people.The boy is only 16 now, but he is different from ordinary people. Knowing that he couldn't see his eyes, he was a little flustered, but he didn't cry or cry. It seems that he accepted this fact very quickly, but when he sat quietly, he felt a little unbearable.Maybe he is too thin and weak. Looking at it like this, he is pitiful.\"How do you feel?\" Xiao Jue asked\"All Uncle He Yan was surprised and ran for a while, then said, \"I just don't get used to it.\" She stretched out her hand as if to touch her eyes, but it was the cloth. Then she drew back and said, \"can't I see my eyes?\"He even asked in a calm tone.Xiao Jue should have said \"yes\", but at this moment, he could not say it.Such a young man with extraordinary skills is the best age. With his qualification, he will be promoted in Liangzhou Weili within a few years. The pearls in the muddy water will not be buried in any case. But losing a pair of eyes is different. Not to mention the impact on the future, it takes courage for him to get used to such dark days.After all, he was not invisible from birth. Having and then losing is much more unbearable than never having at the beginning.\"Uncle, you're not sorry for me, are you?\" He Yan suddenly said. Although his eyes were covered with cloth strips, the tone of her words was imaginable. If it was ordinary, she should have widened her eyes at the moment, and her eyes were full of narrow and mocking.\"Maybe you're still blaming yourself?\" She said with a smile: \"in fact, you don't have to blame myself for me. You should praise me. Maybe if you praise me, I will think that it's worth doing all this.\"\"What do you praise?\" Xiao Jue said indifferently.\"Praise me, of course.\" The voice of the teenager was a little surprised and a little proud, \"if I hadn't reminded you not to drink, I wouldn't have led to this assassination. I'm your Savior, isn't itWhen is it that she still wants to think about it? Xiao Jue is speechless. I don't know if the boy is big hearted or really doesn't care.\"You don't seem upset.\" Xiao Jue said, \"your eyes can't see, maybe you'll never see.\"As soon as the words came out, the young man's fingers curled up for a moment. Although it was very subtle, it was still caught by Xiao Jue.He was afraid, not as understatement as it seemed.\"God won't be so bad to me, will he?\" He Yan said: \"I haven't done a bad thing in my life. How can I be treated like this. If If you really want to treat me like this, I can't help it. There are many kinds of blind people. I'm so good. I'll be the most powerful one among the blind. \"Xiao Jue was slightly stunned. It seemed that she had heard this sentence for a long time.\"But, uncle, are you going to give up so early? I think you'd better get me some more doctors? Maybe I can cure it. Why do you talk like there's no cure? \" He asked.Xiao Jue took a look at him. Although the young man tried his best to behave the same as when he was in peace, he was a little tired and could not lift his spirit. He said, \"have a good rest.\" Turn around and go.Xiao Jue left the room, and the room was calm. Because there may be assassins in the house, all the servants in the house have been removed. Only one of Xiao Jue's own people, feinu, is left outside the courtyard.He Yan stretched out his hand, as if to untie the knot behind his head. After a moment, he still put down his hand and did not continue to move.She bowed her head and murmured, \"Ding Yi.\"Yuan Baozhen's bodyguard, he Rufei's former servant, who personally gave her a bowl of poison in his previous life, heard yuan Baozhen call his name. His name was Ding Yi.\u2026\u2026In the study, sun Xiangfu's face wrinkled into a ball, almost crying.In front of him was Yuanbao Town, who said, \"Sunzhi County, I can't help you with this.\"\"Mr. Yuan, you can't be helpless! Now you are the only one who can help me, \"Sun Xiangfu said with a sad face:\" I really don't know what happened to those assassins today. Now the governor is angry, and childe Cheng can't see. Governor Xiao will surely send the fire on the lower officials. I'm just a magistrate. Where can I take the anger of general Fengyun? \"Sun Xiangfu personally met Xiao Jue and Cheng Lishu, who had a good relationship with his uncle and nephew. Cheng Lishu and sun Ling have a dispute. The appearance of Xiao Jue coming to protect the short is really frightening. At that time, he only argued a few words, which was so. Now Cheng Lishu is really blind. Isn't Xiao Jue going to die with his life? Sun Xiangfu shuddered at the thought.\"I don't think governor Xiao is such a unreasonable person.\" Yuan Baozhen comforted.When they were talking, Xiao Jue arrived.Sun Xiangfu did not care to ask yuan Baozhen. He lifted his robe and knelt down to Xiao Jue.\"What do you mean?\" Xiao Jue looked coldly and asked.\"Governor, I really don't know what's going on at the moment? They cheated me too! Even if you give me a hundred courage, I dare not murder you Sun Xiangfu began to complain.\"Get up,\" Xiao Jue glanced at him. She didn't seem to like his manner. She went inside, sat down in the top chair and looked at him. \"Tell me how you met them.\" After a pause, he added, \"those assassins.\"This is Believe he's not behind the scenes? When sun Xiangfu realized this, he was overjoyed. On the other hand, Yuan Baozhen's eyes flashed and there was no sound.Sun Xiangfu got up in a hurry. Without dusting his robes, sun Xiangfu retreated to a slightly lower chair. In this way, he and Yuan Baozhen sat in the same position as Xiao Jue. Sun Xiangfu wiped the sweat on his forehead and said, \"in fact, it's only half a month for them to enter the mansion. At first, it was a new opera troupe in the city...\"The leader of the opera troupe was an old woman. She brought a group of beautiful girls to the city. She said that the drought in the place where they lived was so severe that they had no way to live, so they moved to Liangzhou city. They set up a stage in the east of Liangzhou city and sang three times a day.At the beginning, it was just the common people who came to see them. The girls were not only beautiful, but also very attractive. Gradually, they became famous, which attracted many dignitaries to know about it. Once they came and went, they spread to sun Ling's ears.Liangzhou city's beautiful woman, which Sun Ling did not touch. Sun Ling saw the night of the opera, he asked people to buy that group of women, into the house to sing. When the old woman refused, she was wounded by sun Ling's servants and was about to be killed. When yingyue stood up, she said she was willing to persuade her sisters to enter the government voluntarily. She only hoped that sun Ling would release their leader.Sun Ling magnanimous to do, yingyue really also convinced a group of sisters, into the house, gentle and small. After entering the sun's residence, sun Ling found that these girls were not only good at singing opera, but also proficient in music, chess, calligraphy and painting. Among them, yingyue was particularly outstanding.Sun Xiangfu also knew about the moon.Sun Xiangfu is different from sun Ling. Sun Ling only knows how to eat, drink and play every day, but Sun Xiangfu has a little ambition. It's good to be the magistrate of Liangzhou, but what if we can go further? Even if there is no further development, the magistrate does not really sit firmly and firmly. He has to take care of all the people who are familiar with and unfamiliar with him. For example, the new commander of Liangzhou Wei is not very familiar with him.Sun Xiangfu wants yingyue to come. He asks yingyue to hold a banquet in the mansion to entertain the guests. In any case, there are two guests. Yuan Baozhen, the censor, and Xiao Jue, the commander of the right army. As long as he pleases one person, he can rest assured.Although sun Ling was dissatisfied, he was helpless. In the days after that, yingyue really took her sisters to practice dancing and singing. Every time sun Xiangfu went to see her, she was very satisfied. The maid was still very smart. When she entered the mansion as the head of the class, she was a little reluctant. After being taught about the luxury of the sun family, she became more and more smart. Sometimes sun Xiangfu could feel the woman's desire for power when she spoke to her.It's also true that people go up and water flows down. It's the same for men and women.Sun Xiangfu thought so until the banquet happened tonight.When he talked about these things, he probably embellished them a little because of his embarrassment, but it was nothing more than a matter of removing those unimportant decorations. Sun Ling saw the color, who knows to pick up a poisonous snake home.\"I really didn't expect that they were assassins. Women How can a woman be an assassin? \" Sun Xiangfu said, I don't know if this is for Xiao Jue or for himself. For the sons of the sun family, Gein women have always been playthings, or things that have been sent to seduce their superiors. Now they have been put together by women. It is difficult to tell how he is feeling at the moment.\"Did these assassins enter the house half a month ago?\" Xiao Jue asked.Sun Xiangfu nodded. \"Yes, it's all the fault of the lower officials. They didn't check their identities seriously. They just thought that they were women, and they had no relatives in the city. They were weak and pathetic...\"He tried to describe himself as a pity for others' weakness, but Xiao Jue didn't pay any attention to him. Just playing with the tea cup in his hand, he said: \"half a month ago, Sunzhi county did not give me a post and invited me to come to your house for a banquet.\"Sun Xiangfu was stunned.\"But half a month ago, Lord yuan should have known when he arrived in Liangzhou.\" He turned his head and looked at Yuan Baozhen with a smile.Hearing the speech, Yuan Baozhen replied with a smile, \"what does the governor mean by this? You don't doubt me, do you? The governor didn't think about it. If I arranged for these women, how could I be sure that they would be taken back to the mansion by Sunzhi county? I can't predict things like that? \"\"Of course, you can't expect things like God,\" Xiao Jue said calmly, \"you just need to write a letter to Sunzhi county.\"This is to say that Yuan Baozhen and sun Xiangfu did the game together.It was easy for sun Xiangfu to think that he had cleared away the suspicion. Xiao Jue immediately let him sweat like rain, and immediately waved his hand: \"no, no! Governor, I really don't. I don't know what's going on. I haven't heard from Lord yuan either! \"Yuan Baozhen stopped laughing. He looked at Xiao Jue and said, \"with a word from the governor, Sun Zhi and I were convicted, but there was no evidence. It was really chilling. I don't have a deep hatred with the governor. Why would I harm the governor if I had a banquet with him for the first time? \"He was born with a good face. His words were sincere, and there were two points of sadness that were misunderstood.Xiao Jue stares at him for a while. After a moment, he smiles. He says indifferently: \"it's just a joke. Lord yuan doesn't have to be serious.\"He closed his smile and became cold again, like a knife about to be scabbard, hiding the ferocity of the mountain rain.\"But I'm afraid we'll have to talk about it for a few days before we get to the bottom of it.\" He said.\"Governor Do you want to live here? \"Since the assassination happened, ordinary people will only feel that this place is unsafe and will leave as soon as possible. The province will be calculated again. How can he stay here?\"Yes,\" the young governor put down his tea cup and stood up with a long body and cool eyes. \"Live here and catch thieves.\"www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was unreasonable to use them to guard their own door. But now sun Xiangfu is like a frightened bird. He can't care so much. All the servants in the house were examined one by one, and no doubt was found for the time being.Xiao Jue, the commander of the right army, and Yuanbao Town, the censor of the imperial inspection, both lived in their houses. Sun Xiangfu was also aware of these two quiet undercurrents. He sat in the room and sighed. Sun Ling had learned the whole story from the people below and said, \"Dad, why are you still worried about this?\"Sun Xiang's luck did not hit a place to come, \"if you are not troublesome, take those women back to the house, how could these things happen?\"\"Dad, I took them back to the house for my own use. I didn't let you take them to entertain the guests.\" Sun Ling quit, turned his eyes and said, \"now there's trouble. How can I blame you? Those women are really useless. If they want to assassinate, they will succeed at one time, and then they will die in vain. I don't know who's cheap? \"Before the words fell, sun Ling was covered by sun Xiangfu. Sun Xiangfu looked around and said, \"you don't want to die. Say this kind of words!\"\"I'm not wrong,\" Sun Ling approached him and whispered, \"Dad, don't you like that Xiao Jue so much?\"Sun Xiangfu did not speak. Is this a question of whether he likes it or not? Compared with whether he likes Xiao Jue or not, it seems that we should worry more about whether Xiao Jue likes him or not?\"I hear that there seems to be a quarrel between the governor Xiao and the Lord yuan. You just have to sit on the mountain and watch the tiger fight. Mr. Yuan is OK and kind-hearted. You might as well help secretly. The enemy of the enemy is a friend. \" Sun Ling said: \"if something really goes wrong in the end, you not only get rid of Xiao Jue, but also make friends with Mr. Yuan. Don't you kill two birds with one stone?\"Sun Xiangfu slapped him on the head with a slap on his head. Sun Xiangfu scolded: \"how can you say so simple? You haven't seen Xiao Jue today... \" He thought of what, fear in the eyes of a flash, \"not easy to deal with.\"\u2026\u2026Yuan Qing, sitting in front of the lamp house. The mediocre bodyguard stood behind him, his eyes flashing.\"Xiao Jue is suspicious of me.\" A moment later, Yuan Baozhen said, \"I can't do anything today. I'm afraid there's no chance.\"\"How could he suspect you?\" Bodyguard, the man called Ding Yi said.\"I don't know.\" Thinking of what had just happened in sun Xiangfu's study, Yuan Baozhen was not angry. Xiao Jue's suspicions were blatant and arrogant. He didn't know how to answer them. He has just come to Liangzhou City, and he has never met Xiao Jue in the past. In any case, Xiao Jue should not suspect him.\"What's more, why is Cheng Lishu blind?\" Yuan Baozhen frowned and said, \"is this also arranged in advance?\"Ding shook his head: \"never heard of it.\"It's no use doubting. Now all the assassins are dead and there is no one alive. Even if they are full of questions, no one can answer them.\"That Cheng Lishu is a little strange.\" Ding Yi opened his mouth and said, \"if it wasn't for his voice to stop today, maybe Xiao Jue has drunk poisoned wine.\"He reminded yuan Baozhen again. At the dinner party, the guests of Wu Cheng's party are not ready to drink. If it wasn't for his voice to stop It's not such a dilemma.\"How did he know that the wine was poisonous...\" Yuan Baozhen murmured. After a moment, he rubbed the lamp holder of the oil lamp in front of the table and said, \"since Xiao Jue and his wife are in the house now, this is our opportunity. I'll try Cheng Lishu tomorrow. If the boy is really blind, I may be able to use him to tie Xiao Jue and save the country. \"\u2026\u2026He Yan did not know that in these invisible places, the undercurrent was surging. At the moment, she was sitting in the room, arguing with feinu.After she had a problem with her eyes, Xiao Jue called the flying slave and stood in front of Heyan's house. After all, there have been assassins in sun's house before. Who knows if there will be several people hiding in the servant girl's servant girl? Yan He is not safe for many people.\"Brother feinu, you go out. I can do it myself.\" He Yan has a headache.\"You can't see with your eyes,\" feinu replied very rigidly. \"The young master asked me to guard you.\"\"Then you guard the door, you want to be my personal servant girl, I really feel very uncomfortable.\" He Yan answered earnestly. \"Can you go out?\"\"If you can't follow your orders.\"\"How can you be as reasonable as your master?\"Xiao Jue just arrived at the door and heard such a sentence. He stood at the door and said, \"what happened?\"Feinu said, \"young master...\"Without waiting for Fei Nu to finish, he Yan had already looked at the direction of the door. Her eyes were still covered with cloth strips, and she did not know whether it was clothes or anything. She said, \"is uncle coming? Brother feinu is crazy. He wants to take a bath for meFeinu's lips moved, as if speechless at her insulted expression, and explained, \"he can't see, I'm afraid...\"\"Uncle! It's not that you don't know that I have a fiancee, my body is pure and pure, how can I be seen by others The young man's voice was clear, and his loneliness and panic had been swept away. He was used to be unreasonable. \"If I break up because of your marriage, big brother feinu, can you afford to pay for my fiancee?\" She muttered again, \"you don't have one yourself.\"Feinu:.... \"Xiao Jue looked at her and sarcastically said, \"are you sure you won't drown?\"The bath tub is placed behind the screen in the middle of the house. The water is not deep. I don't know if the days in sun's house are so extravagant, and there is a circle of petals on it. He Yan did not use such exquisite flower bath when he was a woman, but he used it when he was a man.\"Uncle, did you forget that in Liangzhou, I could shoot sparrows in the sky with blindfolded eyes. How could I drown?\" He Yan said: \"don't worry. Besides, if I really become blind, I can't let people do things for me all my life. Uncle, if you have this possibility, I'd better forget itFeinu was speechless. He had seen many brothers in the nine flag camp. Occasionally, some of them were short of arms and legs. Although they could live with laughter, they would be depressed for a while. He Yan is the quickest person he has ever seen to come out of this kind of mood. If it wasn't for the cloth on her face, people would doubt whether she was really blind.Xiao Jue saw that she was full of air and didn't care about her. She only said to the flying slave, \"come out.\"Fei Nu follows Xiao Jue out, the door is closed, and he Yan is relieved.She didn't untie the cloth, took off her clothes, went into the tub, and soaked her whole body in water. If anyone is here at the moment, she will be surprised that she is as good as ordinary people, and her actions are not half hesitant. She seems to be able to see them.The water temperature is just everywhere. I have been taking a bath in the river next to the health station. The river is cold and not as comfortable as at present. But even if comfortable, but also dare not covet. Water mist transpiration, blurred her shadow, he Yan face smile also relaxed.I thought I was going to dinner here, but I didn't expect to stay here for a few more days. In this way, coupled with the blind eye, so that there are more people around to serve, it is more important to guard against the identity of women being exposed.She still remembers Ding Yi's last action at the banquet today, that obscure action of bending fingers. If she had not been staring at Ding Yi, it would have been ignored. But just because she recognized Ding Yi, she knew that the boy who finally rushed out to Xiao Jue was arranged by Ding Yi. Then this matter became very strange.Ding Yi was he Rufei's little brother, and Yuan Baozhen was also he Rufei's friend. Ding Yi colluded with the assassin at the banquet to assassinate Xiao Jue. In a way, it may mean he Rufei. But why did he want to kill Xiao Jue?In her previous life, when she was \"he Rufei\", she did not invade the river with xiaojue well water, and even worked as a classmate in Xianchang hall. Now he Rufei returns to his original self and has no hatred with Xiao Jue in the past. Why should he use such vicious means to kill Xiao Jue?Maybe she should talk to Yuan Baozhen.\u2026\u2026At night, he Yan and Xiao Jue Fei Nu sleep in a room.For fear that there were other assassins in sun's mansion, they did not separate. However, there are many courtyards in sun's mansion. This room is divided into inner and outer rooms. In the inner room, Xiao Er Gongzi lives naturally, while in the outer room, feinu and Heyan sleep on one side and collapse on the other. Heyan felt that such a sleeping method seemed to protect Xiao Jue's Dharma. Considering that she was injured for Xiao Jue, he didn't expect to catch even the collapse of a mile. It was really worthless to think about it.But he didn't think about it for long. He Yan fell asleep. The next morning, he Yan was awakened by the flying slave.She sat up, her eyes full of darkness, subconsciously asked, \"when is it?\"\"The hour of the hour.\" Said feinu.\"Oh.\" He Yan went to touch the cloth on his eyes again, and this time she directly untied it.From the dark to the bright, if you can see, you must narrow your eyes to get used to it. However, Heyan just opened his eyes and didn't feel any discomfort. Feinu's heart sank and asked, \"can you see it?\"He Yan shook his head blankly.There was a silence.\"Maybe Just a few more days. \" Feinu's clumsy comfort. He didn't have much sympathy for Heyan, but he heard that during the banquet last night, he Yan not only reminded Xiao Jue, but also helped Xiao Jue deal with the assassin himself. Everything was one thing. Although the boy's identity is suspicious, so far, Xiao Jue has not been harmed.\"Isn't uncle here?\" He Yan asked.\"The young master is out.\"He Yan nodded again, thought for a while, and covered his eyes with the cloth.\"Why are you wearing it again?\" asked Fei nu The herbal medicine has been used for a day, it doesn't work. Today, he Yan didn't call his eyes hurt, so the cloth didn't work. He felt uncomfortable wearing it.\"Put it on and remind others that I can't see now.\" He Yan laughed and said, \"to a blind man, people should be tolerant. I can't get away from others. Other people can avoid me, can't they? \"Obviously, the former is more like a blind man than the latter. Feinu was shocked in his heart. It seemed that something flashed from his head. He couldn't catch it quickly. After a moment, he didn't say anything. He just said, \"go to dinner first.\"He Yan nodded.Xiao Jue is not there. After finishing with Heyan, feinu sits in the room to eat. He Yan didn't want feinu to help him. He ate slowly, but his action was steady. He didn't spread the soup outside. Sun Xiangfu's maids were all withdrawn. With Xiao Jue's warning, he Yan couldn't believe any of the maids here.Just after eating, feinu asked people to take away the leftovers on the table. Heyan sat alone for a moment, and someone's voice rang. The footstep sound is very light, if it is not her ear strength, ordinary people can not hear, not one person, but two people.Xiao Jue doesn't have to be like this. He Yan knows who the talent is just after he leaves. He Yan still sits quietly, as if in a daze.The footstep sound fell to the front of him, as if he was studying her carefully. He Yan's eyes were covered with the cloth strip, and he did not move.After a while, the visitor did not seem to find any flaw, and suddenly opened his mouth: \"Young Master Cheng.\"\"Ah He Yan was startled and almost fell off the chair. She stood up disorderly and knocked her foot against the leg of the table. She cried out in pain. Someone came to help her and said, \"is everything ok?\"He Yan opened his hand and grabbed it in disorder and said, \"who is it?\"He caught a man by the corner of his coat. The man comforted her with a good voice: \"I am yuan Baozhen, not a villain. Don't worry, young master.\"He Yan then calmed down, relieved, and began to speak with fear: \"it's yuan Yushi. I thought it was the assassins who came again. They scared me to death! Why don't you come in\"I'm sorry. I didn't expect to frighten you.\" Yuan Baozhen said with a smile, \"I heard that you can't see in your eyes. I've come to see you.\"When he said this, although he was concerned and distressed, he had no smile on his face. He was staring at Heyan's expression, as if to see whether he was really blind or not. However, he Yan's eyes were covered with strips of cloth and could not see anything.If you don't see a person's eyes, it's hard to see the loopholes in his expression.He leaned so far that ordinary people might not realize this, but he Yan could clearly feel it. The person she was holding was Ding Yi. Yuan Baozhen was greedy for life and death. He was afraid of accidents, so he would not go directly. But his eyes are like maggots of tarsal bones, which is hard to ignore.Even so, he Yan didn't show any signs. She seemed to be in some distress, and some young people were indifferent. She said, \"yes, I can't see now, but my uncle said that he would find a miracle doctor to cure me, so I should not see for a while.\"It's good that she didn't say it, but when she said it, people almost believed the fact that she really couldn't see. Because \"miracle doctor\" said, originally with a kind of relief perfunctory meaning, used to deceive children.Yuan Baozhen sat down on the chair next to him, shook his head and sighed, \"I didn't expect that this trip would hurt the young master. It didn't hurt his life, and so did governor Xiao. \" With that, he seemed to think of something. He looked at Heyan and asked, \"it's just young master, how do you know that there was an assassin at that time at the banquet last night, and he didn't let the governor drink that cup of wine?\"No one knew whether the wine was poisonous or not. Therefore, Yuan Baozhen asked skillfully. He did not mention the wine at all, but only assassinated. He Yan sneers in the heart, this is to test her to come. She looked up as if she didn't know which direction yuan Baozhen was in. After hesitating for a moment, she said, \"I don't know there were assassins at that time. I just saw flying insects flying into my uncle's wine cup.\"This answer made Ding Yi and Yuan Bao Zhen not expect, two people at the same time a Leng, Yuan Bao Zhen asked: \"flying insects?\"\"Yes, you don't know. My uncle loves Jie,\" He Yan sighed. \"His clothes are stained with dust, and they will be replaced immediately. Their shoes are stained with mud. They will never wear them again. If he drinks them, he doesn't know how much fire he will get. I just want to remind him not to drink and change to a cup. Who knows there are assassins and I am scared Who could have thought of it? \"Is that the reason? Yuan Baozhen was a little suspicious. At that time, Cheng Lishu yelled bitterly and anxiously. When he heard this, he felt very nervous. Was that the case? But if it was not for this reason, how could he, a young master who did not know anything, know that there was something wrong with the wine.Maybe it was a mistake? Yuan Baozhen couldn't tell what he felt. Who could know that a good chess game would be destroyed here? He was half angry and half doubted. When he looked at Cheng Lishu, he only found the boy annoying.However, \"Cheng Lishu\" obviously didn't know his dislike. Instead, he seemed to be very close to Yuan Baozhen when he came here to see him. He said with a smile, \"I heard from my uncle that Yuan Yushi came from shuojing?\"\"Not bad.\"\"Can yuan Yushi know general he Rufei of Feihong?\" She asked.As soon as this was said, there was a moment of silence in the room. Ding, who is very close to Heyan, presses his hand on the long knife on his waist. In an instant, his face is full of murderous spirit.The young man was still in suspense, with a smile on his face, waiting for his answer in the direction of Yuanbao town.A moment later, Yuan Baozhen just stared at Heyan's face and asked, \"how could you suddenly ask general Fei Fei Hong?\"\"People don't all say that general Feihong and my uncle are enemies, and they have the same skill and merit. I have never met general Feihong. I don't know how he is or how he looks? Yuan Yushi came from shuojing and was an official in the same Dynasty. Maybe I have seen him. I heard that he used to wear a mask, but now he takes it off. How about it? Does he look good\"Cheng Lishu\" was in front of him with a light voice. He didn't know that the bodyguard on his side was almost drawing his knife. He asked the same question as those naughty Beijing teenagers. Yuan Baozhen breathed a sigh of relief. For a moment, he thought that the boy had found something, and he almost wanted to shut up.\"I've seen him. He was born It's very handsome, but it should not be compared with governor Xiao. \" Yuan Baozhen replied with a smile.\"Not as good as my uncle?\" He Yan was disappointed and quickly said, \"well, is yuan Yushi close to general Feihong? If you get closer, I'll go back to shuojing in the future. Can you introduce general Feihong to me. I've heard a lot about him, and I want to see for myself what kind of person he is She whispered: \"it's just that my uncle will never know about it. I'm afraid he will punish me for copying.\"\"I'm afraid you will be disappointed,\" Yuan Baozhen shook his head and said, \"general Feihong and I are just acquainted with each other. If the introduction, it's better to let governor Xiao introduce the young master. \"He Yan whispered, \"I dare not let him introduce me.\"As she said this, Yuan Baozhen looked at her and suddenly said, \"I came here today, originally I was afraid that the young master would be sad because of his eyes, but now I see that I am worried. It seems that the young master is not very sad.\"He Yanqi said: \"why did yuan Yushi say that? I had been crying for two hours last night. If my uncle hadn't scolded me for not stopping talking, you would not have seen me now. What's more, I also want to understand who I am. I am the young master of Yousi zhilang's family. Although I can't do anything, my uncle is the commander in chief of the right army. As long as there is my uncle, my eyes will not be blind all the time. My uncle said that if a miracle doctor could cure it, there would be a miracle doctor who would cure my eyes! \"Her words were full of admiration and trust for Xiao Jue, but she taught yuan Baozhen to be speechless for a while and didn't know what to say. He Yan's words are not leaking. I haven't found any flaws for the moment, just He was still a little uneasy.\"You're right, Dudu Xiao can't do anything, he can find a way. It seems that I am narrow-minded, \"he stood up with a smile,\" so I should go. Young master is not feeling well now, so let's go and lie down first, \"he looked around.\" how come there is no servant in this room? \"\"I want them all to go,\" He Yan said with a smile, \"that happened last night. I dare not use the servants in this house. Do you dare to use Yu Shi Yuan? You have a lot of guts. \"Yuan Baozhen said with a smile, \"but you can't see now. Do you always want someone to serve you?\"\"Feinu will serve me, and I can feel it myself.\" She said with a smile: \"Yuan Yushi, don't worry, I can do it myself.\"Yuan Baozhen said with a smile, \"young master, I'll leave first.\" After that, he turned and left, but went out to the door, turned back again and again, and stood still at the door.Ding didn't move a step in the room.When they came in, they were talking to Yuan Baozhen all the time. Ding Yi didn't say anything. He Yan easily thought that there was only one person in the room.Yuan Baozhen stood at the door and winked at Ding Yi.He Yan stood up and walked to the room. Ding Yi was in front of her. She could feel that there was an Emei thorn hidden in her sleeve, which was taken from yingyue's hand last night. She had already thought out how to avoid it and how to pierce the Emei thorn into his heart.The boy's eyes were covered with cloth strips, and she did not reach for it. She held the wall beside her and walked slowly into the room. Perhaps the people in the room were afraid that she would not be able to move easily, so they put the chair and everything aside. From the front of the table to the collapse, there was nothing on the way. Just hold on to the wall and touch it.He Yan is the same.She went to the place near the bed, Ding Yi bent down and put a bench in front of her.Young people have no idea, a foot in the past, \"bang when\" a sound, a stumbling step, immediately fell forward. He planted really unfortunately, hit the bed title, the whole person exclaimed, the forehead immediately swollen a bag. He fell to the ground, half of his body fell on the ground, his hands were also bruised, and he did not get up for a long time.Ding Yi and Yuan Baozhen shook their heads.Yuan Baozhen saw this, turned to go out, Ding Yi also lightly followed out.He Yan is the only one left in the room.He Yan covered his head and screamed, no one saw her, and her lips overflowed with a sneer.www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On the one hand, he tried to find out why she found out about the wine. On the other hand, he wanted to see if she was really blind. This person thought carefully, unexpectedly also wants to let Ding come to put a stool, specially sees her reaction. If he Yan's response is half wrong, I'm afraid the master and servant will have other ideas.Her ear power is extraordinary, early to hear Ding Yi's action, also know that Yuan Baozhen did not leave immediately, so she specially cooperated with them to perform a play that Yuan Baozhen wanted to see. But yuan Baozhen is testing her. Why is she not testing yuan Baozhen?It's obvious that the relationship is very shallow, but it's just knowledge. Just know, he Rufei's little servant Ding will never follow him here. There was a problem in that cup of wine, but what puzzled Heyan most was what role he played in this matter. Is it that he and Yuan Baozhen conspire to murder Xiao Jue, or is he Ru not the chief agent at all, or are they all doing things for others?Next, she has to follow Ding Yi to figure out what the two men are going to do.There was no movement outside, and he Yan's \"ouyo ouyo\" voice was louder. There was a movement behind him. It was the voice of flying slaves. He asked, \"what's the matter with you?\"\"I just knocked my head.\" He Yan reached for him blankly, \"big brother feinu, come and help me quickly, my foot is sprained.\"Feinu came forward and helped her to the collapse. The cloth covers Heyan's eyes, so feinu can't see her mood from her eyes, and naturally he doesn't know what he is thinking at the moment.In fact, the play just now was not only for yuan Baozhen, but also for feinu.Yuan Baozhen and Ding Yixin want to test Heyan, but they don't find that feinu has been standing at the door, listening to the movement inside. They didn't find out, but Heyan found out that the flying slave was just a person to take away the dishes. Why did they go so long? It was just Mantis catching cicadas and yellow finches.For some reason, Heyan always felt that Xiao Jue and feinu didn't trust her, which was nothing. A person who had little contact with him in the past would not trust her at the beginning. But she is sensitive to realize that Xiao Jue does not only distrust her, but also a little wary and suspicious.He Yan also can't feel the head, she thought that she did not do anything suspicious. Now that she came here, she and Yuan Baozhen did not even meet in the past, and they were doubted for some reason.It's all, doubt is suspicion, a play deceives two people. He Yan said: \"brother feinu, where did you just go? You haven't seen the imperial censor yuan for a moment. \"Fenu avoided her question and asked, \"what's on your head?\"He Yan touched his head and said: \"swollen boss a bag, I don't know when to eliminate.\" She sighed again and again, \"this is really a Hongmen banquet. I think my little brother is very clever. It's right not to come. It's more dangerous than being forced to marry. \"This if change Cheng Li Su here, do not know what situation is at present.\"Sit down and have a rest.\" Feinu's voice could not hear any emotion. \"I'm at the door. What can I do for you?\"He left again.He Yan is lying on the collapse. She is covered with a piece of cloth. Feinu can't see her expression. She can't see the reaction of feinu. I think she has no expression.I don't know when Xiao Jue will be back.\u2026\u2026When Xiao Jue came back, it was already late at night.On this day, Heyan and feinu stayed in sun's house and did nothing. All the food and wine that sun Xiangfu sent over should be tested for poison one by one with a silver needle. Because he Yan can't see, he simply sleeps in the house for a day, and feinu also guards at the door for a day.After Xiao Jue came back, the flying slave who was sleeping on the collapse immediately woke up and walked to Xiao Jue and said, \"young master.\"Xiao Jue motioned him to follow him into the inner room. Feinu took a look at the fallen Heyan. Under the dim light, she was sleeping soundly.Feinu and Heyan went into the inner room, but they didn't see the young man lying on the collapse and knocking the mattress under him with his hands. Of course, Heyan didn't fall asleep. After a day's sleep, how could she still sleep at night? She was not a pig raised in the village. Xiao Er childe obviously had something to say with his confidant. He estimated that feinu would tell the governor what happened here today.The two masters and servants whispered, but he Yan didn't have the courage to listen. Xiao Jue is not yuan Baozhen. He has real kung fu. Once he exposes himself, he will have too many troubles, and his gain is not worth the loss. However, he wanted to know what feinu could tell him. He Yan realized that he had cheated feinu.As for whether she can cheat Xiao Jue, she doesn't know.In the room, the lamp was lighted.Xiao Jue put his sword on the table and sat down on the chair in front of the table.\"Young master, I've been to Yuanbao town today.\" Feinu road.Xiao Jue raised his eyes and said, \"what's the matter?\"\"My subordinate, I'm here to look for Heyan. Yuan Baozhen had a few words with Heyan. \" He told Xiao Jue the original dialogue between Yuan Baozhen and Heyan, and finally said, \"Yuan Baozhen seems to be testing Heyan.\"Xiao Jue pondered for a moment and said, \"what do you think?\"\"It seems that he Yan didn't know yuan Baozhen. There was no flaw, but it was possible that the two of them were acting together. But on the whole, he Yan's doubts can be cleared for the time being. \"\"Clean up?\" Xiao Jue hook lip to smile, he way: \"flying slave, the swindler in our house, even you have cheated past.\"Feinu was stunned and didn't know why.\"Don't forget that he Yan shot the birds in the sky with his blindfolded eyes when he compared the bow and crossbow with Wang ba. Do you think a person with such an ear can't hear that the guards of Yuanbao town put a stool in front of her? \"\"Young master means...\"\"He can avoid the stool completely, but he will fall down. One is to cheat yuan Baozhen, and the other is to cheat you.\" Xiao Jue carelessly opened his mouth, \"this person, very can cheat people.\"What kind of a blind person is, stumbling and flustered. When there is no one around, he can't do anything. It's very pitiful. This is the impression of ordinary people on blind people. Yuan Baozhen and feinu are both ordinary people. Naturally, they think so. Seeing Heyan fall helpless is just like a blind man. But he Yan is not ordinary blind. Even if she is covered with cloth, she can practice better than other people's bows and crossbows.Yuan Baozhen had never seen Heyan shoot an arrow with blindfolded eyes, but feinu had seen it. Even so, even he ignored this point.\"Cheating on you is the second thing. Yuan Baozhen is the most perfunctory. Otherwise, he would not say that there are flying insects in the wine.\"Flying insects in the wine? How can this be possible? It's not summer now. Sun's residence pays special attention to this point. Wormwood sachets are hung everywhere. Flying insects fly into wine cups, which is hard for Heyan to think of.\"Young master, is he from Yuanbao town?\" Feinu didn't understand. If yuan Baozhen was a man, why should he be so suspicious.\"It doesn't look like it, but it can't be said that it's not.\" There are ink, brush, paper and inkstone on the table, which Sun Xiangfu specially arranged. He didn't love it himself, but preferred to be elegant.Xiao Jue found a pen and paper and wrote a few words. His handwriting is elegant and elegant, very beautiful, falling on the paper, as bright as a person.\"I want you to bring a letter to Lin Shuanghe.\"\"Mr. Lin?\" Feinu's calm face finally showed a surprised expression, \"young master, you don't let Mr. Lin come to Liangzhou?\" He suddenly thought of something, can not set the channel: \"is it He YanThe handwriting quickly dried when he saw the wind. He put the letter paper into the envelope and looked down: \"for him, but not all for him.\"Feinu didn't ask any more questions. He packed the letter and was about to leave. Xiao Jue saw this and chuckled.\"What are you doing so carefully? People outside have already woken up.\" He said.\"Young master?\" Feinu was stunned.\"Well, you're no match for cheating.\" Xiao Jue shook his head, lazy way: \"anyway, he did not have the courage to come in.\"Feinu stood there thinking for a while before he left the room. After he left, Xiao Jue moved the wick of the lamp. In the light, his pupil was bright and compelling.\"Xu Jingfu...\"The night swallowed his whisper.\u2026\u2026When he Yan wakes up, Xiao Jue is no longer there.He seemed to be very busy these two days. When he was awake, he had already left. When he came back, he had already gone to sleep, but he didn't even hit him face to face. She guessed that what Xiao Jue had done might have something to do with the night banquet in sun's mansion, but she couldn't go with her. She could only sit here and wait.But sitting around and waiting was not her pleasure. Fortunately, after noon and towards the evening, feinu also went out. Before leaving, she was told to stay in the house and not to go out to save trouble.He Yan nodded and said yes.In fact, in Heyan's opinion, sun's house is not as murderous as feinu said. From the night banquet, we can see that the target of those assassins was Xiao Jue alone. If Xiao Jue is not here, 70% of the house is safe. The remaining 30% may not beat her.Early this morning, he Yan took off the cloth on his eyes. It was because the cloth had been used for two days and should be replaced. However, the doctor in the house was scared away by Xiao Jue last time, and no one made cloth for Heyan.Although the cloth was removed, after two days, all the people in the government decided that he Yan was blind and would not treat her as an ordinary person, only he Yan himself.Suddenly take off the cloth, then feel too bright, still some uncomfortable. Yesterday morning, she untied the cloth in front of the flying slave to maintain the same expression. God knows how much she wanted to shed tears at that time.In fact, he Yan has never been invisible.That day in the evening banquet, finally received Ding Yi to rush over the boy, really threw a powder like things. She blocked it, and she did feel some pain in her eyes at that time.After all, she had been blind once. She was so nervous and sensitive in her eyes that she felt vaguely in front of her and suspected that she was going to be blind. But when she calmed down, she felt that she had actually escaped. At night, when there was no one, he Yan secretly untied the cloth, and she could see the lantern light outside.But because she was too nervous and made an oolong, she wanted to explain the next day, and when it really came to the next day, she changed her mind.A blind man, almost no threat. It's much easier to be a man without threat and get close to Yuanbao town than to be a \"clever young master Cheng who can find the poison in the wine\".Therefore, he Yan did not show any difference when he took apart the cloth in front of feinu. She has been a blind person for a long time. She can imitate all the reactions that a blind person should have.However, he did not expect that Yuan Baozhen was so cautious that he came to confirm whether she was really blind. As a result, he Yan was even more difficult to get off. But at the same time, he is more convinced that there are absolutely problems between he Rufei, Ding Yi and Yuan Baozhen. He Rufei was definitely involved in the murder of Xiao Jue. Although she didn't understand what was wrong between him and Xiao Jue, the enemy of the enemy was a friend. Now she and Xiao Jue should be together.She has to find out what yuan Baozhen and Ding Yi want to do.He Yan tied up his hair and went out the door quietly.Other people know that today's childe Cheng can't see. He stays in his room every day except to go to the toilet. What's more, people in the mansion are in danger these days. Sun Xiangfu is busy with self-cleaning. He Yan's head is really neglected. Fortunately, she had a good memory of knowing the way. On the first day when she came to the sun's house, she felt the way of the sun's house.However, Heyan didn't know where yuan Baozhen lived. When he was in trouble, he saw a man walking quickly through the garden. It was Ding Yi, not someone else.Come on! He Yan heart dark praise, quickly followed the past. She was very quick and used to looking for a house to hide. Of course, because of the luxury of sun's mansion, there were rockery and bonsai everywhere, which gave her many hiding places. No one found her all the way. Finally, Ding Yi stopped in front of a house and pushed the door to enter.I don't know why. The room where Yuan Bao Zhen lived was far away from the hall. It was almost too far away, and there were few people. In autumn, in the evening of Liangzhou, it was already dark. Heyan estimated and swept the roof.She is small and thin. The roof is tilted and cornices are flying, and carved stones are everywhere. He Yan is lying on the roof, almost integrated with the roof. After searching carefully for a long time, she finally found a gap. She didn't know whether it was rain or hail. The fragile crystal tile broke for a little while and just leaked out a line of gap. Heyan pasted her face to listen to the movement inside.Inside, Ding Yi walks in.\"How about it?\" Asked yuan Baozhen.Ding Yi shook his head: \"lost with.\"\"You have not been found by him, have you?\"\"That's not true.\" Ding Yi hesitated for a moment, \"I don't dare to get too close. I'll be found out by him. He went out early today and went to the east of the city. I later looked for him nearby, but I didn't find him. \"Yuan Baozhen looked uncertain: \"what does Xiao Jue want to do! When something happened in sun's house, he had to live in the house. He went out every day and didn't know what to do. I always think something's wrong. \"He Yan hears here, doubt in the heart, Yuan Baozhen is to let Ding Yi follow Xiao Jue?\"What happened at the other end of Yamen Asked yuan Baozhen.\"Yingyue and his party are all dead. There is no evidence, and the agent in the house is also dead. Since he said hello to sun Xiangfu in advance, there should be no problem.\" Ding Yi said here, \"I still don't understand how Cheng Lishu knew the action that should have happened at that time, and that cup of wine was also discovered by him.\"\"Do you think he has a problem? But yesterday you saw that he couldn't see. He was just an ordinary teenager. \"\"Even so I always feel something is wrong. \" Ding Yi also can't say, that youth should be blind, otherwise also won't pretend to be like this. The servants in the mansion also said that he stayed in the house all day long, and Xiao Jue's bodyguards guarded him. It seemed that he was just a rich young man with no strength to tie a chicken. Dante remembers that at the banquet, Cheng Lishu cast his eyes at him.His eyes were fleeting, as if he had caught a glimpse of other people. But for a moment, Ding Yi seemed to feel the anger in the young man's eyes. He looked at it again. The boy had already looked away, as if it was just his illusion.But is that really an illusion?He Yan was shocked by the bustle of their talk. \"Yingyue is dead\", \"there is no evidence\" and \"said hello to sun Xiangfu\". That is to say, the assassination of Xiao Jue was really done by Yuan Baozhen. Maybe sun Xiangfu also helped.Now that Xiao Jue still lives here, isn't he leading others to continue to harm him?As she was thinking about it, she heard yuan Baozhen ask, \"has brother he written to you recently?\"This \"brother he\", he Yan thought, is he Rufei.\"No, the master told me to succeed this time.\" Ding Yi said: \"if you fail, you can't explain to Xu Xiang.\"Xu Xiang?He Yan's heart moved. The meaning of this remark is that he Rufei asked Ding Yi to assassinate Xiao Jue, because he wanted to make an account of Xu Xiang. In other words, he Rufei is working for Xu Xiang? But who is Xu Xiang? She knew that Xu Jingfu was the Prime Minister of the present Dynasty, but she did not know whether it was the \"Xu Xiang\" in Ding Yikou.\"We have failed,\" Yuan Baozhen was half angry and half depressed. \"I didn't expect Xiao Jue to be so difficult, and now he suspects me I don't know if there will be such a chance in the future. \"\"Xiao Jue is really hard to deal with, but he has a blind nephew.\" Ding Yi said: \"since this person is blind, he can't do anything, just like a fool. I think it can be used.\"\"What do you want?\" Asked yuan Baozhen.\"Don't forget what I used to do.\" Ding Yidao: \"I have my own way...\"He did not finish his words, then heard the \"creak\" on his head, a small piece of green color fell down, Ding looked a change, \"who?\" He jumped out.Under the moonlight, someone's figure flies by very quickly, such as a swallow's lightness, and disappears in the night in the blink of an eye.He Yan complained incessantly in his heart. Sun Xiangfu attached himself to mediocrity and elegance. Even the roof tiles were made of Cuijing tiles. Good looking is good-looking, but it is very fragile. Even a thin person like her would collapse by accident. What's the reason? He Yan suspects that sun Xiangfu is playing the role of a pig eating a tiger. The purpose of using this tile is that no one can listen to the corner of the house on the roof. If it is an ordinary man, he will just fall down.In the distance, Ding Yi was still chasing after him, but for some reason, he didn't say a word to the servants of sun's house to catch the assassin. Maybe he had a ghost in his heart. He Yan is familiar with the road here, hiding in the left and hiding in the right. He also thinks about the conversation he overheard just now.Yuan Baozhen came to Liangzhou, Ding came to Liangzhou, and he Rufei was in shuojing. They all wanted to assassinate Xiao Jue for one purpose. All three of them had to explain to Xu Xiang. At present, Xiao Jue is living well, and all the dead men are destroyed. Yuan Baozhen is unwilling to come back, and Ding Yi still stares at her, a \"waste blind man\". To use her as a blind man to murder Xiao Jue.After thinking about it, one person using another is nothing more than instigating rebellion, taking hostages and acting as innocent murderers. Cheng Lishu and Xiao Jue are uncles and nephews. Yuan Baozhen probably would not have thought of plotting a rebellion. Then there are only two kinds left. One is that he Yan doesn't think Ding Yi has beaten herself. Second, she is not really Cheng Lishu. Xiao Jue probably can't do anything stupid like \"to be arrested for my nephew.\".As for the third kind of murder weapon, ignorant and unconscious They forgot the most important point, that he Yan was not only blind, but even began to guard against Ding Yi early in the morning.Thinking about these, he Yan has seen her own room. The light is on in the room. Maybe the flying slave has come back. He Yan touched his body, the cloth was put in the room, thought that he would have to play for the flying slave, but he didn't feel headache.She was afraid of being caught up by Ding Yi. She leaped forward and entered the room with a lightning bolt. Just turning back, she was almost choked by her saliva.Xiao Jue is sitting in a wooden barrel for bathing in the room. The beautiful woman is in the bath. The moonlight slips in through the window, and the green silk is covered with cold color. It is particularly attractive. His shoulder blades are very beautiful. For a moment, he Yan's mind wandered to other places. She thought, when she was in Xianchang hall, she had never seen this man take off his clothes. Most of the men in the army were fierce and rough. Xu Zhiheng was probably gentle. But Xiao Jue was different from them. It was both British and American and contained strength. That strong waist was particularly attractive, no matter men or women People, see must praise.It turns out that this man not only has a good-looking face, but also has a different body from ordinary people. No wonder his name is \"jade face governor\", which is worthy of his name.The fog made it difficult to see his expression. I don't want to be too happy. Xiao Jue probably didn't expect that someone would burst in and stand up at the moment. The water was clear and crisp.He Yan said:After that, he Yan saw all the things that should be seen and what should not be seen. At this moment, she scolded herself bloody. Why did she wear a piece of cloth when she went out all day, but she didn't wear it today? Or if only she could not see.Xiao Er quickly picked up the clothes on one side of the rack and put them on, and looked at her coldly.It seems cold in the room.As he was about to speak, he saw the boy in front of him open his hand and casually close the door. His eyes seemed to stare even bigger, but nothing could be reflected. He said, \"who Who is it? \"\"Oh.\" The second young master Xiao was laughed at by his poor acting.www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is it uncle? \" He Yan showed a surprised look, such as a blind man touching an elephant, opening his hands and grabbing together, \"where are you?\"Xiao Jue looked at her with a cold eye and sarcastically said, \"don't you know how to shoot arrows with blindfolded eyes and hear sounds and shapes? Why, can't you hear me? \"He Yan's action stops abruptly, after a moment, Shan Shan's smile, \"I'm afraid you feel embarrassed. Are you bathing, uncleThe young man opened his eyes and looked at the front without blinking. Even though he had put on his clothes at the moment, Xiao Jue felt uncomfortable all over.\"Where did you go just now?\" He asked.\"The toilet, big brother feinu is out. I can't believe the servants here. I feel out and relax for a while. Uncle, why did you come back so early today He Yan asked: \"has big brother feinu not come back yet?\"Xiao Jue side body, and the outer dress to put on, way: \"don't run around here.\"He Yan looked at him and thought of the conversation he had just heard from the master and servant of Yuanbao Town, and said, \"uncle, have you been looking into the assassins at the banquet these days? Did you find out? \"Xiao Jue glanced at her and asked, \"what do you want to say?\"\"You say Is it possible that the people of this family have hurt you? You see, although sun Zhixian said he didn't know the truth, it was his family. How could he know nothing? Can't he? And Yuan Yushi, \"He Yan suggested, racking his brains,\" I think he is also very strange... \"\"Oh, where's the surprise?\" Xiao Jue asked.He Yan didn't know how to answer this, but he couldn't say that I went to the roof of their house to uncover the tiles and overheard them. Moreover, I was blinded by the bodyguard beside him in my last life. He Yan had no choice but to say, \"Yuan Yushi came to me once and asked me some strange questions. If you want me to say it, I have to say that my intuition is a little wrong. You should be more careful of them, uncleThe young man groped for a chair to sit down. His voice was very serious. A trace of unexpected color flashed in Xiao Jue's eyes. He asked slowly, \"do you want me to be on guard against Yuanbao town?\"\"Yes, you think, if they do harm to you once, there will be another time. Uncle, you don't have to worry if you are not in the house But it's not right. You are not in the house on weekdays. Why do you still live here? \" He Yan suddenly remembered something.Since he wants to live in sun's house, he has to go out every day. Isn't this a contradiction?\"You should pay more attention to your eyes than to these things.\" Xiao Jue light way, \"your eyes really can't see?\"He Yan jumped in his heart and pretended to be stupid: \"that's nature! What's good for me to pretend to be blindWhat she said was eloquent. When Xiao Jue looked at her again, she felt that everything she had done was not like a real blind person. If she was really pretending, it was really too powerful. But this man is used to deceiving others, otherwise he would not even cheat the flying slave.He Yan saw that Xiao Jue didn't speak. He was afraid that he would continue this conversation. He said with a smile, \"uncle, are you just bathing? Am I disturbing you when I come in? Do you want to continue? You go on. I'll guard the door. I can't keep it in. I can't let anyone else in. \" Having said that, he felt for the door and pushed it open. He went out and sat down on the steps outside the door, guarding the gate like a door god.Xiao Jue:He Yan didn't listen to the room. I don't know whether Xiao Er childe still has the mind to continue bathing. Anyway, he Yan's mind is a bit chaotic. There are so many facts that I don't know what to think about first. He Rufei and Xu Xiang, Yuan Baozhen and Ding Yi's plot are mixed together, and finally they become Xiao Jue's bathing appearance.\"Bah, bah --\" Heyan scolded. The man who is not blind in his mind will be blind after such a encounter. Although she was a woman, she didn't know who was taking advantage of whom after careful consideration.Half a dozen!\u2026\u2026The next morning, Xiao Jue disappeared again. After feinu came to give her a meal, she also disappeared. They don't know what they are doing every day. Heyan sits on the couch and thinks whether he wants to sneak out to follow yuan Baozhen and his bodyguards. But after last night, Yuan Baozhen will surely stare at the roof of the house. The sun's roof is fragile, so it's not suitable to climb repeatedly.Who knows not to allow Heyan to come up with a result, Ding Yi himself came to the door. He stood at the door with a respectful voice: \"Mr. Cheng?\"He Yan raised his head, and Ding Yi's voice was respectful and polite: \"Mr. Yuan, please go to tea.\"\"What tea?\" He Yan casually asked, \"I drink tea quite selective.\"\"There are all kinds of tea,\" Ding said with a smile, \"if you don't want to...\"\"Yes,\" Heyan stood up, holding the head of the bed. \"I'm really bored here alone. It's rare that Mr. Yuan remembers me and accompanies me to relieve my boredom. How can I be so disrespectful? You lead the way. \" Her eyes are still wrapped in a cloth, \"please bring my bamboo stick.\"When Fei Nu came back last night, he brought back a bamboo stick, which was not high or short, and could be carried by Heyan. Although this person looks silent, she is actually very considerate. After all, the people in sun's house are not trustworthy and can't be used by everyone. However, it's really inconvenient for her to walk on her own. It's much better to have a bamboo stick, and it's more like a blind man in the eyes of others.Ding Yi said, \"good.\" Looking sideways, he saw a bamboo stick standing in front of the table. He went to take the bamboo stick in his hand. While walking to Heyan, he handed it over and said, \"please take it, Mr. Cheng.\"He Yan reached out to pick it up. Just as he was about to touch the head of the bamboo stick, Ding Yi suddenly took his hand forward, and he Yan threw himself into the air. She was already standing unsteadily, and she almost fell down. Fortunately, Ding Yi helped her. Ding Yi said, \"is Mr. Cheng OK?\"\"It's OK.\" He Yan heart has the way of remaining palpitation: \"almost fell down.\" Then he said in a gloomy tone: \"now I can't even take a thing.\"\"It's not good for his subordinates,\" Ding Yi said with guilt. \"Just now, it should be sent directly to Mr. Cheng, which made him frightened.\"Although he said so, his eyes were fixed on Heyan, trying to find a flaw in his face. Unfortunately, once his eyes are covered by the cloth, it is really difficult to predict the change of Heyan's expression. He also did not know, he Yan looked at the people in front of him, silent sneer in his heart.This piece of cloth was changed by her last night. The black piece of cloth can be used to grind out a tiny gap in her eyes with a needle. Not much, just a little bit. Through this gap, we can see the actions of outsiders. In the eyes of outsiders, he Yan is just a blind man whose eyes are covered with cloth strips.Ding Yi's trial, staring at her face at the moment, was he Yan's eyes. She didn't expect that Ding Yi had doubts about her now. But why? Last night, she escaped so fast that Ding Yi didn't find any clue. If she had been reminded at the dinner party that Xiao Jue should not drink a cup of wine, the last time yuan Baozhen came, the temptation should have ended.Why do you try again and again.He Yan couldn't think of it, so he leaned on the bamboo stick and said, \"well, it's none of your business. Let's go.\"\"I'll help you.\" Ding Yi opened his mouth.\"No,\" He Yan said, \"if I really can't see again, sooner or later I have to adapt to this kind of day. What's the matter of always asking others for help? Besides, I have a bamboo stick. I'm just walking slowly. I can't keep up with it. Just tell me how to get thereThe boy's voice is stubborn. It sounds like a man who wants to win even if he is blind. Ding Yi doesn't find any loopholes and says, \"please follow me, Mr. Cheng.\"He walked forward and told Heyan where there were steps and where to turn left and right. In fact, he Yan walked very slowly. The bamboo stick touched the ground and made a sound of \"dutiful\". He was very careful. He walked seriously, and Ding Yi was very patient and guided her all the time. However, he Yan's Yu Guang could see that the man's eyes were always staring at her every tiny movement, and he was still trying to catch her possible loopholes.If it is to pretend to be blind, people will have some common habits when they walk a long way. If people who are close to each other, they can also find that there is something wrong with them. However, he Yan had already come prepared. She covered the cloth, she could think of the days when she was in the Xu family. She did not have to pretend to be blind at all, as long as she did it in the past.The two of them, one pretending to be blind and the other observing, were on guard against each other. After all, they were better at pretending to be blind.Ding Yi said: \"Mr. Cheng, be careful of the steps. We're here.\"He Yan points the bamboo stick, raises his feet according to the bamboo stick's guidance, and climbs up the steps with Ding Yi.The room in Yuanbao town is close to the shady side. It seems that it is difficult to get sunlight in ordinary days. As soon as you enter the room, you will feel dim. In the daytime, even a lamp is lit. There is a teapot on the front of the table with several tea cups and a plate of snacks. Ding Yi leads her to sit down in front of the table.Yuan Baozhen raised his head and said with a kind smile, \"how are you doing these days, Mr. Cheng?\"\"It's OK. It's OK.\" He Yan pointed to his eyes: \"it's not good except here.\"\"Haven't you improved these days?\"\"No He Yan sighed, \"I don't know the doctor my uncle is looking for, when can I get to Liangzhou.\"Yuan Baozhen didn't take it seriously. He just looked at Ding Yi. Ding Yi shook his head to him, meaning that he had not found any flaw in his life.That's really blind.When he looked at Heyan, he also looked at him. He Yan felt that this man was different from what he had seen a few days ago. His voice is still very kind, but because he Yan can't see, even the smile on his face disdains to pretend. There was a little impatience in his expression, as if something was not going well.Also, since they came to kill Xiao Jue, they didn't succeed. At present, even the trace of Xiao Jue has not been seen every day, and the smooth point can not be touched.Yuan Baozhen pushed the tea cup in front of him to Heyan's hand, and then sent the plate containing snacks to Heyan. He said with a smile, \"have some snacks.\".Some of the snacks are sprinkled on the head of Yan He.He Yan still remembers when he left that Cheng Lishu told him that he would get a rash as long as he ate peanuts. That's interesting. Did Yuan Bao Zhen know that Cheng Lei Su can't eat peanuts? He Yan felt that nine out of ten knew it. Then the purpose of this plate of snacks is very clear, or to test her.After eating this plate of snacks, there is no rash, there is a problem. If you don't eat this plate of snacks, there's a problem.He Yan thought that he could do what he could, and asked yuan Baozhen to try again and again.She did not go to pick up the cup of tea, nor to get a snack. Instead, she laughed and said in a strange way: \"Mr. Yuan, I can't really drink tea and eat snacks.\"Yuan Baozhen's eyes moved: \"why?\"\"You know my uncle won't let me eat and drink in the house after the dinner. My daily things are sent by feinu. Lord yuan, I can't believe you. It's because my uncle is very strict. If I eat on his back and get angry, I can't afford the consequences. \" The tone of the boy was so natural that he didn't even understand why yuan Baozhen was so stupid. He said, \"I advise Mr. Yuan not to eat the food of the family, but to endure the desire of eating, so as not to be killed.\"The young man answered quickly, without any clue. It was hard to know whether he was telling the truth or lying. Yuan Baozhen smile, \"I here tea, but also order the waiter to buy outside.\"\"Eating outside is more dangerous.\" He Yan said in a long way: \"it's really not possible. Mr. Yuan, wait a minute. When my uncle comes back to the mansion, you can talk to my uncle and get my uncle's approval. How about eating these things again?\"Yuan Baozhen couldn't answer that. Did he invite Xiao Jue to have tea? It's not that you expose yourself.He Yan realized that this remark was perfectly perfect. Cheng Lishu was originally a small counsellor who was afraid of his uncle!Yuan Baozhen took back his hand, shook his head and laughed: \"if you don't want to eat, you don't want to eat.\" The tone is very lost.\"Nothing. I'll sit down with Mr. Yuan. It's very good.\"\"Well, there's something I'm very curious about,\" Yuan Baozhen said, looking at the young man in front of him. \"Governor Xiao loves you so much. Why does he leave you alone in the mansion these days. Only that bodyguard was with him. Even if he was a bodyguard, he didn't stay with Mr. Cheng all the time. If there was any problem in this mansion, governor Xiao would not worry that childe Cheng would be in danger? \"As soon as he said this, he Yanfu suddenly understood why the master and servant of Yuanbao town wanted to hold on to him.Because Xiao Jue put his nephew alone in the sun house, this is an unreasonable thing! Xiao Jue did this because he Yan knew martial arts. On the other hand, she was not really Cheng Lishu. She had no blood relationship with Xiao Jue. Of course, the indifferent young master Xiao would not treat her differently. But in fact, with the real Cheng Lishu here, Xiao Jue will try every means to ensure his safety. Instead of the present situation, Heyan stayed alone in the sun's mansion and was covered with the words of being released. He looked like a spoiled and abandoned concubine who was thrown into the cold palace.He Yan himself has always been very correct in his position, so he does not feel anything, but in the eyes of others, it is wrong. At this time, she suddenly realized that this was the reason why the master and servant of Yuanbao town had always felt wrong and stared at himself.But Xiao Jue, such a smart person, could not have thought of this. He Yan thought it impossible. When he was in Xianchang hall, he Yan was careless, but Xiao Jue was very careful. He Yan didn't believe he would ignore it. So there was only one possibility. Xiao Jue was intentional. Xiao Jue deliberately let her show flaws, let Yuan Bao town master and servant full of doubts about her, again and again to test themselves.But why? Although Xiao Jue has doubts about her, at least for now, they should be a group. Is it possible that This bastard used her as a shield. She attracted the attention of the master and servant of Yuanbao town. Xiao Jue had time to do his own business?The more he Yan thinks about it, the more he thinks it is possible. He wants to tear Xiao Jue's hand into eight pieces. Her face is not obvious, only a naive way: \"what can be dangerous, my uncle said long ago, the real danger is not in this house, I am safe to stay in the house, I tell you,\" she whispered: \"the real danger is outside the house.\"\"Outside the mansion?\" Yuan Baozhen and Ding looked at each other and asked Heyan, \"what do you say, Mr. Cheng?\"\"I don't know,\" He Yan spread his hands and looked like he had nothing to do with me. \"Anyway, I overheard that my uncle said that. If you want to know, go straight to my uncle. \" She added, \"I think he's been out of the house these days. I'm not sure he's going to solve the\" danger. \"OK, since Xiao Jue used her as a shield, she would kick the target back and lead yuan Baozhen's eyes to the outside of the house. What's more, the image of a useless childe she didn't know about was deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and she didn't find any flaws in Yuanbao town.\"Mr. Cheng is really a joker,\" Yuan Baozhen said with a smile, \"since it's the private affairs of governor Xiao, I won't inquire.\" He said something else.He Yan is full of awe.She saw that Ding Yi came over and was very close to her. She bent down to untie a incense ball in her waist.Cheng Lishu is a very particular young master. There are countless sachets and jade pendants. He Yan thinks that these things are too expensive and is afraid to lose them. After searching for a long time, he finds a simple looking incense ball. The incense ball is only two fingers big. It is a small ball woven from Wisteria. It is hollow in the middle and filled with spices and herbs. It is worn on the waist. It has a faint fragrance, lovely and elegant in action.Ding Yi holds the incense ball in his hand. His movements are very light and almost invisible. He Yan, who cannot be seen, can only pretend to be unconscious at the moment.She would not think that Ding Yi liked this incense ball, so she stole it. Sure enough, Ding Yi opened the top of the incense ball, took out the original medicinal materials inside, and filled in other things.It must not be a good thing.After all this, he tied the incense ball to Heyan again. From the beginning to the end, he Yan did not do anything.Yuan Bao Zhen looks satisfied. Ding Yi stands back to Yuan Bao town again. From the outside, everything goes as usual, as if nothing has happened.He Yan's mouth and Yuan Baozhen are chatting about the anecdotes of shuojing, only to feel that fragrant ball on his waist is faintly hot. In her previous life, she had already suffered from poisoning. He Yan suspected that Xu Ding was good at using poison. She still remembers what she heard last night when she was listening to the master and servant room of Yuanbao town. They planned to use themselves to trip Xiao Jue. This is probably the way they came up with.It's probably poisonous. It's not small. If you wear it on yourself, you'll die. Xiao Jue, who is close to you, will die when you smell it. Even the flying slaves can't escape. In this way, a family of three, no, the master and servant are really one, and they can all blame the assassin. Maybe when he came to the autopsy and found out that he was not Cheng Lishu, he became an assassin disguised as Cheng Lishu, who secretly murdered the commander of the right army.He Yan fought a cold war, and we must not let this happen.She said, \"Mr. Yuan, I'm a bit anxious. I want to go to the toilet first.\"\u2026\u2026Sun house, Xiao Jue came in.Feinu followed him in, and seemed to have been waiting for him for a long time.\"Young master, he Yan, general of Yuanbao Town, please leave.\" He said.Xiao Jue put the sword on the table, turned around, and said carelessly: \"probably still trying.\"\"If you can't find the young master, they can only start from Heyan.\"Xiao Jue gave a noncommittal smile. He Yan is the shield he put out to attack the West. He doesn't have two tails, so it's more convenient to do things. Others thought that he had gone out of the mansion. In fact, the day when he really went out of the mansion was only today.He has been in sun's mansion, hiding in the dark, but no one found it.\"If you do this, you won't be found out by Heyan?\"\"He should have found out, but he can only lie.\" Xiao Jue said: \"this man lied to Yuan Baozhen for the first time, although I don't know why.\"He Yan coped well. The better he dealt with it, the more he could not find a flaw, the more suspicious yuan Baozhen would be. Because Xiao Jue left his nephew in the sun's house, this is a thing full of flaws.\"The young master tried Heyan with Yuanbao Town, and Yuanbao town with Heyan. What if they were a gang?\"Up to now, Xiao Jue has been killed at a banquet in sun's mansion on the same night. Almost all of Xiao Jue's people are not involved. Heyan and Yuan Baozhen tried each other out, just to find out the origin of the two people, killing two birds with one stone.\"If it's together, it's all in one net.\" Xiao Jue light way: \"originally this matter, also fast stop here.\"Feinu was silent. After a moment, he seemed to think of something, and then said: \"today, Heyan went to the room of Yuanbao Town, and the guards around Yuan Bao town changed the incense ball he wore on his body.\"Xiao Jue picks eyebrow: \"did he not discover?\"\"No\"Just acting.\"\"I'm afraid it's poisonous in that incense ball, governor. Stay away from him today.\"Xiao Jue looked out of the window and suddenly said, \"at this time, Heyan should be back. What are you doing outside?\"As soon as the words fell, I heard a servant girl of sun's house come panting, running and saying, \"no, no, no!\"Feinu opened the door: \"what's wrong?\"The servant girl mumbled: \"Mr. Cheng Mr. Cheng fell down in the hut! \"www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The head servant girl said anxiously, \"Mr. Cheng, are you ok? Will you let the servants in? \"The answer to her was the angry voice of the boy: \"no! No admittance! Stand outside. \"All the servants looked at each other. It was also true that the young master from the capital city of Shuo usually looked at the wind, the scenery, and the light. Now he fell into the toilet pit, he was certainly very embarrassed, and he didn't want to be seen by others. However, we can't just leave it like this!The servant girls are anxious to lose their hair.He Yan stood in the side room and sighed silently.To be honest, the sun family's decoration is gorgeous and exquisite. In fact, the toilet room is very clean. But she did so to solve the problem that Ding Yi changed the incense ball on her waist.Mr. Cheng, who fell into the toilet, must clean his whole body up and down. Even if it is a incense ball for smoking clothes, after such a time, he can only throw it away. Yuan Baozhen master and servant asked, reasonable, can not find a problem. It is difficult for adults to walk from the toilet pit, but also have to put a dirty incense ball on the body, that is sick.It's just He Yan looked at the stain on her body through the cloth. The sacrifice she made was really great. Cheng Lishu is a really smart kid because his brain is not big and easy to use. He Yan is responsible for all the dirty work.What's this called.She thought in her mind, and suddenly heard someone shouting outside: \"Master Cheng, you come out, here comes commander Xiao!\"Is Xiao Jue here? He Yan originally thought that the flying slave came to meet him. How could it be Xiao Jue who came back so early today? She did not think clearly, heard the voice of Xiao Jue outside: \"Cheng Li Su, come out.\"He Yan said:Why is it that she is so embarrassed when she meets Xiao Jue every day? He Yan took a deep breath and came out with the bamboo stick.People outside hold their breath.The clothes he was wearing were splashed with smudges, and his hair was a bit messy. His eyes were covered with black cloth, but his mouth was flat. As soon as he came out, he made a complaint in a wrong direction: \"uncle, you are coming! But for my life, you would have a nephew who fell to death in the toilet room! \"Xiao Jue:Xiao step forward, Yan Jue side. This person loves Jie most. It is probably the biggest concession that he can bear to come here to pick up Heyan.\"Feinu, take him back to me and wash it clean.\" It seems that he Yan's smell is unbearable. Xiao Jue turns around and walks away.He Yan scolded in his heart, look, is this what people do? Who did she fall into the bathroom for? Xiao Jue is really a white eyed wolf.Feinu came to help Heyan. He followed him every step of the way. Now he fell into the toilet. He even helped him across the distance and used a handkerchief. He Yan was speechless.When they lived outside, this time, he Yan didn't need to remind him. Feinu sent hot water and a wooden plate for bathing. With a face on his face, he said to Heyan, \"go in and wash it.\"\"You won't wait for me to take a bath?\" She asked tentatively.\"It's inconvenient for you to have a fiancee.\"It's been a long time. He Yan was lazy to pay attention to him, he closed the door and jumped into the bath tub.It's hard to bear to think about it. General Feihong, now he has to jump into the toilet to avoid disaster. If his subordinates saw this, he could not help laughing at her.But I didn't expect to come to Yuanbao town. The incense ball he gave himself was abandoned before he saw Xiao Jue. After all, it's going to rain and people have to wrestle.Outside the house, feinu squatted down, took the branch and poked at the dirty clothes he had thrown on the ground. From the clothes, a round incense ball rolled out. Feinu took the branch against the incense ball and said, \"this should be it.\"Xiao Jue glanced at the incense ball on the ground and did not speak.\"Young master, is this intentional or unintentional?\" Feinu was also confused. If he Yan is unintentional, just fell down the toilet room, resulting in this incense ball can not be used, it is also too coincidental. But if it is intentional, if he and Yuan Baozhen are together, why should we make such a fuss. Even if it's hard work, it's too real.\"On purpose. However, \"he grinned, his eyes did not know whether it was disgusting or unexpected. He said in a very complicated way:\" this method can be achieved. It's really informal. \"This is also true. Who would have thought that he Yan would fall into the toilet? I'm afraid even yuan Baozhen didn't think of it. He Yan's action is really incredible. But any individual face person, will not think of this method.\"If he did it on purpose,\" Fei Nu looked at Xiao Jue and said in surprise, \"young master, he Yan can see with his eyes?\"Xiao Jue picks eyebrow: \"ten to nine.\"\"What does it mean that he has been pretending not to see?\" Feinu was puzzled, \"is it to deceive us, or to cheat yuan Baozhen?\"\"All of them.\" Xiao Jue said slowly: \"he may not be on one side with anyone else.\"Just as Xiao Jue was wary of Heyan and watched yuan Baozhen play coldly, he Yan might have left himself out of the picture. She probably saw him fighting with Yuan Baozhen from the perspective of watching a play. When she cheated yuan Baozhen, she cheated Xiao Jue by the way. As for her purpose, I can't see it now.\"Young master, will Heyan interfere with our affairs?\"\"No \"It's almost over,\" Xiao Jue saidFeinu was silent for a moment and said, \"the reply from shuojing will arrive tonight.\"After tonight, we will know what he Yan came from and what he asked for. As for yuan Baozhen, his good days are coming to an end.\u2026\u2026In the room, Yuan Baozhen could hardly believe his ears. He asked his servant, \"what do you say?\"Sun Fu's servant was scared by his face, and nono said: \"just now, Master Cheng fell into the toilet room, and governor Xiao took him away.\"Ding Yi's face changed dramatically. Yuan Baozhen helped his forehead and waved: \"you go down.\"The servant left.Yuan Baozhen slapped his hand on the table: \"asshole!\"We don't need to study it carefully. We know that the incense ball given to Heyan today is useless. If you fall into the toilet, you will inevitably get dirty all over your body. If you want to clean the inside and outside, how can incense balls survive?\"Not good.\" Yuan Baozhen stood up, some uneasy, \"that incense ball will not be found by Xiao Jue, right?\"\"Xiao Jue loves Jie and should not deliberately move. Just, \"Ding Yi looks unpredictable,\" He Yan is not necessarily. \"\"You mean he did it on purpose?\"\"Don't you think it's a coincidence? Just after giving him incense balls, he fell into the toilet. Before that, the so-called flying insects into the pot in the banquet was just one side of his story. More importantly, why did Xiao Jue leave his nephew alone in the sun mansion? There is something wrong with this person. I always feel that Cheng Lishu is not as simple as it seems on the surface. \"\"If he has a problem, isn't it that he knows what you and I intended in the first place? Is this a trap set by Xiao Jue? \" Asked yuan Baozhen.He was afraid of Xiao Jue from the bottom of his bones, probably because he knew that the commander of the right army was the one who would kill people regardless of his identity.\"Let's do it tonight, I think.\" I don't know how long it took, Ding Yi just said.\"What?\" Yuan Baozhen said in a hurry: \"sober Xiao Jue, you can't beat it.\"Because of this, they did not dare to fight Xiao Jue directly. Unfortunately, the night banquet failed. It would be difficult to find another opportunity. Originally, they wanted to start from Cheng Lishu. This boy is more evil, and he can't slip away. He has no idea what's going on.Yuan Baozhen's words seemed to annoy Ding Yi. He swept his face and said, \"I didn't intend to start with him. His strange nephew is my goal.\"\u2026\u2026He Yan washed himself clean. Finally, in order to dispel the smell, he took Cheng Li Su's ointment and wiped it all over his body. He changed his clean clothes before he dared to see Xiao Jue.Xiao Jue sat at the table and stopped her from going forward: \"it's ten meters away from me.\"He Yan's heart greatly turned a white eye, but smile on the face: \"uncle, I wash clean. Don't believe you smell it - \"she tried to get close to her, and a scabbard hung in front of her, touching her nose and blocking her way. Through the gap between the black cloth, we can see that Xiao Jue covers her nose with sleeves and looks unhappy. Her brow is as if she has been attacked by the rebels.He Yan spread out his hand: \"good good, I don't go forward.\"Mr. Xiao is really fastidious, but I don't know if it can save his life. If she hadn't jumped into the toilet by herself, the second childe would not have been able to hold on for a few minutes under the toxicity of incense balls. He Yan's heart was filled with regret. He knew that he had thrown the incense ball directly to Xiao Jue. He dared to be so critical as now.She reached for a chair with a bamboo stick and sat down on it. After thinking about it, she still asked, \"uncle, how long will we stay in this mansion?\"\"What?\" \"Do you want to go back?\" Xiao Jue said\"Not really. It's just that I feel strange living here.\" He Yan replied. She also wanted to dig out more things about he Rufei from Yuan Baozhen and Ding Yi. Of course, she couldn't go back so soon. But it's not right to stay here. Although he Yan doesn't know what Xiao Jue is doing, all kinds of actions of Xiao Jue have made yuan Baozhen pay attention to Heyan and come to him instead. In this way, he Rufei's secret has not been dug out. Don't let yuan Baozhen discover his plan.\"What a strange way?\" Xiao Jue opened her mouth slowly, as if she had not put her words in her heart.\"Yuan Yushi talks to me from time to time,\" He Yan simply said to the point. \"I feel like he's talking to me. Uncle, you're not afraid to leave me here alone and reveal any secrets to him?\"Xiao Jue looked at him like a smile: \"what secret do you have to divulge?\"He Yan said:Xiao Jue and feinu secretly do something, have not told Heyan, put clearly do not take her as their own people. Even if yuan Baozhen wanted to get information, he Yan really had no secret to disclose to others. She was a marginal figure outside the core and knew nothing about it.She said, \"that's not right! Where does uncle leave nephew alone in tiger's den? Doesn't it make people suspicious just by looking at it? \"Who knows if yuan Baozhen will make a sachet for her to change. She can't fall into the toilet again and again. It's not the eyes that can hurt, but the brain.\"Suspicious?\" Xiao Jue lowered his eyes and said slowly: \"I see that he has not been suspicious these days.\"He Yan cried in his heart, that is because she has been helping the lie! This kind of clumsy lie, is the individual can suspect. However, he Yan also saw that Xiao Jue was intentional. It should be that he was deliberately attacking the West and bringing disaster to the East. He was too black hearted to do such a thing without shame.She said, \"uncle, you run around all day long. Have you found the murderer?\"When she said this, there was a slight irony in her voice. Although she could not see her eyes with her eyes covered with cloth strips, she could also think of the young man's rolling eyes. Xiao Jue calmly replied, \"I have found it.\"\"Found Did you find it? \" He Yan Leng for a moment, \"who?\"\"You'll soon find out.\"She knew it very soon. She knew it already. The murderer was the master and servant of Yuanbao town. He Yan scratched his ears and scratched his cheek. He wanted to take Xiao Jue to Yuanbao town now, pointing to Ding and Xiao Jue in Yuanbao town and saying, \"it's him, this man, catch him!\"But now she can only pretend to be silly and ask, \"does uncle not arrest him now?\"\"Not yet.\" Xiao Jue hooked her lips.\"When will that wait?\"\"When the swindlers are in force.\"He Yan: \"what?\"She didn't understand Xiao Jue's meaning. Without waiting for her to continue to ask questions, feinu had already come over, pulled her up and pushed her out of the door in a different direction. While pushing, she said, \"it's too late. You should have a rest first.\"\"Bang when\" a sound, and closed the door, it is really heartless.He Yan stares at the door behind him, and a villain is cursing wildly on his hips. Not to mention the friendship of former schoolmates, they have dealt with assassins together in this life. They are half friends of life and death. What's Xiao Jue's attitude? With this attitude, there are so many girls admiring him in the Wei Dynasty. I'm afraid they are all bewitched by the sorcerers in southern Xinjiang. It's hard to understand!She climbed up and lay flat, pulled the quilt up and got her head in.Just rest, rest. Anyway, what yuan Baozhen wants to kill is not himself, who he loves.\u2026\u2026It's colder after the autumn equinox.He Yan was awakened by cold.Sun's quilts are silk quilts, soft and soft, with delicate embroidery, round and round, which is very rich and magnificent. Although this kind of quilt is thin, it is very warm. He Yan has been sleeping in the sun's family for several days, and his bed quilt is really impeccable. It's the first time I've been awakened by cold like today.The black cloth strip was beside her. Before she went to bed, she untied it. Now he Yan sat up slowly, thinking whether it was a little too annoying to ask someone to cover himself in the middle of the night. As soon as she turned around, she saw the window beside her opened and the wind was pouring in.No wonder it's so cold. It's useless to build three floors. He Yan wants to get up and close the window. He suddenly thinks of something. He turns his head aside. If it is, under the weak lantern light outside the window, the flying slave on the other side collapses and is empty. This man is not there.Feinu is not here. You don't have to go into the inner room to know that Xiao Jue is definitely not there. The master and servant probably went to some shady business behind her back. Heyan see strange, then stay in bed wear shoes, want to go to close the window to continue to sleep.The wind was so cold that the branches beside the bed swayed and a dew fell. He Yan reached out and was about to close the window. Suddenly, he saw a dark shadow passing by from afar. If a person who could not use martial arts looked at it, he might feel dazzled.This big night, even the dog has gone to sleep, how can someone hang around. He Yan thought flashed, grabbed one side of the clothes and followed out.He Yan followed him carefully. She had been in Qianfeng camp in her previous life, and had the experience of taking advantage of the night to raid, cover up her tracks and escape into the enemy's camp. Therefore, it was easy to do such a thing.This man in black is not Xiao Jue and feinu. Xiao Jue and feinu are very tall, but this man is not tall. All over the body are covered in the night clothes, can not see the clue. He seems to be very familiar with the courtyard of the sun family. He avoids the place where there may be guards and goes all the way to an abandoned courtyard of the sun family.There is such an abandoned yard in the sun mansion of nuota. It is far away from the main hall. He Yan hid under the window for a few days to listen to the maid chatting outside. He knew that the yard was once a concubine captured by sun Ling. This concubine was the youngest daughter of a rice shop keeper in Liangzhou. She was beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, she was taken in by sun Ling and robbed to her home.The Maidian girl had a family relationship. She was a scholar outside the city who was dependent on her widowed mother. The scholar was not angry about the humiliation of robbing his wife. However, the officials took care of each other. Liangzhou city was covered by the sun family. Finally, both the scholar and the Widow Mother were put into prison and died soon.After hearing the sad news, the girl in Midian shed tears every day. Sun Ling was a man who liked the new and hated the old, but in a moment she was tired of this girl. Seeing her weeping day by day, I felt that she had touched his bad luck, and raised her hand to reward the girl to his subordinates.A good girl was tortured to death.It was probably that she had died so miserably that a rumor came from the yard that someone had heard the girl crying at night. Sun Ling felt bad luck, so he sealed the courtyard. There were rumors of ghosts and ghosts in it. On weekdays, no one dared to enter. This yard became a deserted yard.When he Yan heard about this incident, he just wanted to rush up and twist sun Ling's head. There are always some people who are full of evil in the world. It is ridiculous that such people are afraid of retribution and dare not enter because of ghosts in their hearts.The man in black chose this place, but it's just a deserted yard. Even the servants have been removed for many years. There is no place where there is anything. What do you want to do?There are a lot of weeds in this place. Some of the trees have died because of no watering, some are still alive, but no one has pruned them. The strange shape of the branches and forks, and the shadows cast on the ground are full of ghost. Except for the wind signal, there was a dead silence. There was no vitality at all. It was like a graveyard.The man in black had arrived at the house where the girl had lived and stepped in.He Yan hesitated for a moment. Instead of entering from the door, he jumped in from the window.I don't know if there is a ghost in sun Ling's heart. There are many Taoist seals on the front and window of this room. I'm afraid that the wronged girl will come to find her. She is very cautious.He Yan sneaks in through the window. Strangely, he Yan can't help but be surprised to see what the scene is in front of him.In this room, there are many Buddha statues on the table and underground. The lamp is the oil lamp on the niche. It should be added by someone from time to time. The fragrance of Buddha is curling. It can not make people feel calm in their hearts, but make people feel cold all over the body.There are Taoist seals outside the house, and Buddha statues in the house. Sun's father and son are desperate to find their way. The integration of Buddhism and Taoism is not as calm as it seems on the surface.Sleeping on the bloody pillow, I'm afraid I will have nightmares every day. Heyan heart ridicule, since so afraid, why do evil. It can be seen that the evil in people's bones can not be changed.At this time, a flower dart flew out of the oblique stab. It came quickly and quickly. Heyan sidestepped away and blocked it with a dagger in his sleeve. With a \"Dang\" sound, the dart fell to the ground and knocked over an angry King Kong.\"You are not blind.\" Someone came out from behind the shrine.After being chased for such a long time, the man finally showed his face. He was still a plain face, but his expression changed. He was no longer flat, without waves. His eyes even flashed with excitement, as if he had caught an interesting prey.\"It took so long to discover that you are blind.\" He Yan Dao.Ding a smile, he also laugh some strange, he said: \"you are really brave, alone, also dare to follow me all the way.\"\"You deliberately open the window, deliberately flash past the window, deliberately walk slowly, so that I can catch up, is not to let me follow? I am always very kind, \"He Yan also laughs.\" I don't like to let people's painstaking efforts go to waste. \"At the beginning, she found out that her disguise had been exposed since others had set a trap, and there was no need to pretend to be stupid. What's more, real masters never fear pitfalls.Only those with insufficient strength will be hesitant.Ding Yi was punctured and his expression changed slightly. After a moment, he said with a smile: \"did you learn from Xiao Jue for your hard mouth?\"\"Born.\"\"You are not Cheng Lishu.\" Ding one stare at He Yan's eyes, \"who are you?\"He suspected Heyan even earlier than yuan Baozhen. It was just because that day, when Xiao Jue had not been drinking, the boy caught a glimpse of it.His eyes were mixed with surprise, anger, hatred, unwillingness and doubt. All sorts of tastes mixed with Chen forced him to come. Although he Yan moved his eyes quickly, his eyes at that moment were still noticed by Ding Yi.He had never seen the boy, but it was clear that he had.\"Who are you?\" He asked again.He Yan smiles.The gods and Buddhas watched silently, and the mantras outside the house cleared the heart to expel demons. It seemed that there was a distant sound of Sanskrit. The young man slowly raised his head and looked like he had met before. His eyes were like light and electricity, which made people's heart shrink.\"I'm the ghost you killed,\" she whispered. \"I'm coming out of hell and asking for your life.\"www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth of a Star GeneralCH 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis is a strange face that Ding Yi has never seen, and there is no trace of changing face.Before he came to sun's house, Yuan Baozhen once said that Xiao Jue came with his nephew, the young master of Yousi zhilang's family, and the famous \"waste childe\" in shuojing city. It's just a casual mention, without elaborating on it. After all, none of them expected that such a useless childe who seemed to have no threat at all would disrupt the whole game.He will not be the real Cheng Lishu. The young master raised in shuojing city will never have such fierce eyes.Who is he? Xiao Jue's staff? But why should Xiao Jue's subordinates look at him with such eyes? As if they had a feud.Looking at the young man in front of him, Ding Yi said, \"are you playing tricks here?\"He Yan chuckled: \"are you afraid?\"Ding Yi's smile received slightly: \"you are hard to please.\" Having said that, the dagger in the sleeve suddenly grows a few inches and stabs Heyan.He Yan spins and flies.The two figures are wrestling together, and the silhouette reflected on the window is particularly strange. If the servants of sun's residence pass by at the moment, the rumor of being haunted will be confirmed.He Yan was a little surprised.She was at that time he Rufei's plan, that is, the soup that the person in front of her sent, making her blind. She always thought that Ding Yi was just a little boy who did things for he Rufei. Later, when she saw yuan Baozhen, she knew that he was good at it. But only when she came to fight in person did she know that Ding Yi was more powerful than she thought.His skill was far ahead of the assassin's leader yingyue on that day. He was extremely cautious and conservative. He would never attack without full assurance. Therefore, even if it is a night banquet, he is also the last piece of chess, and will not attack until he has to. The incense ball is the same. You must wait until Xiao Jue is poisoned and very weak. You can make sure that you are killed by one blow.Today, Ding Yi set a trap to wait for Heyan to enter the pit. However, no matter how good he Yan is, a 16-year-old boy will not be really good.This person, both conceited and careful, conceit is conceited in their own skills and ability, careful is careful in doing things, to be sure.Not to be underestimated.Ding Yi was shocked.He had never seen such an opponent.It's said that Xiao Jue, the commander of the right army, has both civil and military skills. He is rarely an enemy. He wanted to fight with Xiao Jue very much. However, if he had not told him not to fight with Xiao Jue head-on, he had to take the opportunity in secret. People like him can never compete openly with people. Like a mouse hiding in a ditch, he can only hide in the dark. There is no place to display martial arts, just like a night walk in a royal dress.Ding Yi's heart is not without regret.The mystery of the boy made him eager to try. He wants to defeat him openly, and then use him to calculate Xiao Jue. Only in this way can he show his ability. But as soon as I played, I knew that I was the only one who had been raised.The boy is not weak.The dagger grasps Heyan's head, and Ding slaps him on his left shoulder. He takes her back a few steps and knocks down the Buddha statue on the table.\"You are disrespectful to the Buddha statue.\" He Yan said: \"not afraid of the Bodhisattva Buddha come to you at night?\"Ding one is not happy to look at her, see this young man was slapped by him, unexpectedly can still speak well? He sneered, \"you know a Buddha here represents a dead man, and you will join them soon.\"He Yan reached out and touched his shoulder, showing a look of panic: \"good, don't tell ghost stories at night!\" The mouth said so, the dagger in his hand did not hesitate to stab Ding.As soon as Ding dodged, the dagger lifted his hat and fell to the ground.He Yan sighed. She didn't have any weapons when she went out. This dagger was still used to cut deer meat at the banquet of sun mansion on the first day. At that time, Xiao Jue was stabbed, so she rushed in to help. This dagger, which cuts deer meat, seems too gorgeous to be practical at the moment.She is thinking, Ding Yi has come forward again, he Yan avoids his knife tip, is patted on the back by his palm, suddenly feel a sweet throat.Although Ding Yi used a dagger, he preferred to fight with bare hands. This is only when the person is very confident in his own skills.\"After being slapped by me, I can still stand,\" Ding Yi's eyes moved. \"You are the first one.\"He Yan swallows the blood in his throat and shows a smile: \"if you can beat me, you are the first one.\"\"Smart mouth.\" Ding Yi said and ran again.He Yan turns to the window to escape.Miss heta's health is still too weak. Maybe God is just like this. There is no absolute fairness in the world. Women's mind is more delicate than men's, and their bodies are doomed to be weaker than men's. Even though she was brave and good at fighting in her previous life, she is only a 16-year-old girl, and she has never had half of her martial arts skills before this Spring Festival.The internal force is not as deep as a ding.\"You want to run away?\" Ding Yi laughs, reaches out to grab Heyan's skirt and pulls it back. Heyan is pulled back by him and falls into the niche.The dust was sprinkled in the air.\"No one will come here at night.\" Ding Yi said with a smile: \"no one dares to come, you can only wait here to die.\"He Yan stood up and kicked aside a Buddha statue in front of him and said with a smile, \"I am a dead man.\"She this action is random, but call ding a look extra familiar, unexpectedly Leng a Leng.Ding Yi is the subordinate of he Rufei, who has been following him for many years. They have been living in other hospitals, far away from shuojing. In the past few years, he Rufei trained Ding Yi as a dead man. Ding Yi's skill is excellent, can make poison, can camouflage, the mind is careful, even if it is to do other people's hand, is also the excellent one.His skills naturally have a place to use. However, when they returned to shuojing, Ding Yi's first task was to prepare a bowl of blinding poison and send it to granny Xu, who is he Rufei's cousin.At that time, he was very dissatisfied with the task, and he did not know why he had to order the cousin to be killed. The fight between women is a matter of the back house. What can he do for him? It's a waste of talent. Ding Yi is insulted consciously.He Rufei told him: \"you should not look down on her, you must be careful, do not want to be found clues.\"Ding Yi is very strange, a woman, where can be fierce? Why should he be careful.Half curious and half disdainful, Ding Yi entered the Xu family and stayed in the Xu family for three days.It was these three days that he found out that Granny Xu was really not a simple woman. She is very sensitive. Sometimes when Ding hides in the dark and wants to observe her, she can immediately find out something wrong. Several times, Ding Yi was almost exposed.In the end, he had no choice but to hide in the Xu family with the identity of he Rufei. Although she was cautious and sensitive, she trusted the family and gave him the opportunity to take advantage of it. He still remembered that bowl of medicine was given to granny Xu at that time. She heard that it was the tonic sent by he family. She looked up and drank it without thinking about it. At that time, he felt that he did not know what it was. Such a woman, with such skill and ability, would have to work hard to kill her if she fought openly and honestly. But as long as the people around you start to do it, you don't even have to worry to get what you want.No wonder others always say that only those who can be cheated and hurt are the people around them.In those three days, Ding Yi also noticed some of the little habits of Granny Xu. For example, sometimes there is something in front of her, such as a fallen branch, she always likes to kick it away. She kicked away seemingly casual, but very hard, which is in fact a very impolite woman in a large family. Granny Xu also knows this, so every time she unconsciously kicks things away, she will react. If there is no one around, she will leave as if nothing happened. If someone, then apologetic, bashful tongue out to say sorry.When she did this, her always plain face would show a dynamic look. As if this is the real her. Therefore, after a long time, Ding Yi can't remember the appearance of Granny Xu, but he still remembers her kicking away the branch in front of her.Just now, the young man in front of him kicked away the Buddha statue beside his feet. All of a sudden, his movement and air coincided with Xu granny in Ding Yi's memory.But how could he be the great grandmother Xu?After drinking that bowl of medicine, Granny Xu became a blind man. Ding Yi thought that this was the end of the matter. Until this spring, when he was in the he family, he heard that Granny Xu fell into the pond and drowned.Ding Yi would not think that she was really drowned by mistake. When he Rufei and his family heard about it, except for the wife of the second room, they were not half surprised. I think it's been known for a long time.What can make the whole he family kill a married daughter so much that she can't trust to become a blind man, and even want her life? When he recalled it afterwards, he gradually came up with a clue.He Rufei lived in other courtyards for many years, returned to shuojing and became general Feihong. Ding Yi thought that he family had found a substitute to replace he Rufei. Since he had come back, the substitute should die. But what if the substitute is a woman?It sounds incredible, but it's not out of the question. In particular, when Ding thought of Xu's alertness and skill, an ordinary woman could not do it. In particular, when I heard that Granny Xu was blind, she didn't feel depressed. Instead, she tried to distinguish the sound and shape. Maybe it was because of this that he family felt uneasy.What they need is a blind man who is obedient. If the blind man can walk, move and speak, it will not be reassuring.The grandmother Xu, who had been blinded by him at the beginning, may be the famous general Feihong. When he thought about it, Ding Yi was proud and regretful. He was proud to have calmed down the rebellion in Xiqiang, but general Feihong, who had been deterred by so many people, was defeated by such a small man as him. It's a pity that although he had calculated on Xu's grandmother, he was not just aboveboard, but just a bowl of medicine.The light was shadowy, and the youth's appearance was blurred. He Yan canthus a corner of the eye: \"when fighting, be absent-minded, is not a good habit.\" Accompanied by her voice, it is her movements, such as ghosts, light, in the blink of an eye has reached Ding Yi.\"Puff and hiss\", the dagger scratched from his sleeve, leaving a bloodstain, and Heyan stabbed his arm.\"Is that all you can do?\" Ding Yi's eyes passed a trace of excitement, and a little disdain. This boy is definitely not general Feihong, general Feihong More than that.He didn't take it seriously and tore off the sleeve that was scattered out. He looked at Heyan and laughed: \"no matter you are a person or a ghost, you will die today!\"He came rushing towards Heyan.The room was originally very spacious, but it was narrow and narrow because there were Buddha statues everywhere. Ding Yi had practiced martial arts since childhood, with deep internal power and treacherous and dangerous means. Otherwise, he would not have been his confidant. He Yan played four or five moves with him, and the place he was photographed was full of scars. The most serious injury was the back, which was cut by Ding Yi's knife point.The window was in front of her, but it was difficult to escape. She was caught and thrown on the ground. Ding Yi grabbed her head and looked at her suspiciously: \"who are you?\"\"Who do you think I am?\" The young man's lips spilled blood, but his expression was indifferent, as if he did not know the pain, even the smile has not changed.In a trance, Ding Yi thought of Granny Xu again. This association made him unhappy, and the hand holding Heyan's neck tightened more and more. He said, \"if you don't tell me who you are, I'll kill you. There are gods, Buddhas and charms everywhere on the ground here. You will never be able to live beyond life. Therefore,\" he said gently and coaxed: \"who are you?\"This young man's skill is already very excellent, give him the feeling of familiar again, Ding Yi does not want to brush past with the truth.However, Heyan laughed when she heard the speech. She coughed up blood and said with a smile: \"you, I have not told you that since I am a devil who has climbed out of the underworld, I have already disdained to be born. What's more, even I can come and go freely. This charm and Buddha statue, however, can't be true. You are so easy to deceive. Do you know your master's son he? \"He even knew he Rufei, Ding one Leng, the expression suddenly changed: \"what do you still know?\" He felt behind him subconsciously, but he felt empty.The young man's face was still in front of him with a smile. As soon as Ding noticed that he was wrong, he stabbed him with a dagger in his hand. However, the young man suddenly woke up and gently withdrew from his control.With a small plum blossom dart in her hand, she leaned against the niche and said, \"is this your assassin's mace? It's still hidden in my arms. If I hadn't been beaten so many times, I couldn't find it. \"Ding Yi's face suddenly sank down: \"you play me?\"\"I dare not,\" the boy said with a smile, \"but I can't plant the same person twice. I'm prepared. It's not your fault. You've hidden it so well. \"A previous life this person sent a bowl of medicine, he Yan was blind. Seeing him again in this life, there seems to be something wrong with that glass of wine at the dinner party. In Yuanbao's house, Ding Yi even changed a incense ball for her. If you are not a person who often uses poison, you can't carry such things with you.With the preconceived impression, she paid special attention to this man. Dingyi's fingertips are black, and his skin is chapped as if he had been soaked in medicine all the year round. This is a pair of hands of a poisoned man. In addition to the hearts of the assassins before him, I think this man also took a sinister and insidious way. He had hidden weapons with poison on his body. The dagger is just a cover up. The real killing move is the poisoned plum blossom dart.In fact, it's not difficult to fight him in close quarters. The difficulty lies in that if he is forced to use a killer's mace, he Yan will not dare to gamble with his life.She is very conceited to observe Ding Yi. Although she has a dagger in her body, she is used to fighting with her bare hands. She is confident that her skill is not weaker than her. Therefore, he Yan deliberately showed his weakness and pretended to be weak. He was just an ordinary young man with a little skill but a little inferior. As expected, Ding Yi began to belittle the enemy.And she smoothly touched Ding Yi's \"killing move.\".Ding Yi ruthless way: \"I must kill you.\"\"Do you think you still have this chance?\" He Yan hit a ring finger: \"now you get beaten.\"The two figures were thrown together. The boy who looked a little weak in internal power was really disguised before. She moved faster and fiercer. However, in a moment, she kicked the dagger in Ding Yi's hand and dodged his big palm with a low body. His head did not return. He stabbed his backhand forward and the dagger hit Ding Yi's waist.\"You...\" His eyes widened in disbelief.He Yan kicked his knee, Ding Yi was kicked down in front of him. He Yan picked up his hair and said, \"now it's my turn to ask questions.\"\"Why did he want to kill Xiao Jue? Are you working for Xu Xiang? What good did Xu Xiang promise you, and what did he want to do? \"She said fast and urgent, ding a Leng for a while, slowly smile.\"I won't say it.\" He said, \"yes, you'll kill me right away. You might as well try to find out what I can do to make me speakHis smile was even a bit rogue.He Yan had seen the expression on his face many times and was not unfamiliar. When she was pacifying the Vietnamese army, when she captured the enemy's men and horses, some prisoners would quickly surrender and rebel, while others would die rather than speak. No matter how you extort a confession, you won't speak. At the end of the day, it's frustrating for the trial taker.The expression on Ding Yi's face is the expression of \"a dead pig is not afraid of boiling water\". What he said was good, but he didn't say absolutely. It seemed that he had left a way to live. In fact, he was playing with Heyan. If ordinary people, they will be fooled in the past, and they may leave him a way to live. If they get a chance, they will save him.But he Yan is not an ordinary person, and he will not be cheated.She looked at Ding Yi and suddenly said, \"you just asked me who I am. Who do you think of?\"Ding Yi's face suddenly changed, staring at her face and did not speak.\"Don't you think it's strange? You have met me only a few times. How can I know that you have a hidden weapon with poison in your body? Prepare for it in advance. The wine at the dinner party is also a reminder. How can I know? \"Ding Yi sneered: \"don't play tricks. Kill me if you can. \"\"If I had no enmity with you, I would not have killed you, but what's the use of keeping you? I live just for revenge.\"\"As the gods and Buddhas testify, I am not lying.\" Heyan smiles, as if to cater to this strange atmosphere. In autumn night, a thunder burst out suddenly, and the lightning lights up the room. The benevolent Buddha statues look at them, as if in a round cause and effect many years ago.\"You once fed a bowl of medicine to a woman, and that woman was blind.\" The boy spoke softly.\"Guess if I'm that woman.\" She laughed.Ding Yi struggled: \"you are...\"In the middle of the speech, his eyes suddenly widened, a trace of blood spilled from his lips, and the look in his eyes quickly dissipated.The plum blossom dart stabbed into his throat. It was very deep, but for a moment, he died.He Yan stood up and looked at the people at his feet. Ding Yi's body lies in the golden statue of Buddha, as if ironic. She whispered, \"you die here, and see if you can survive.\"She turned and went out.Ding Yi can't stay. For such a person, she doesn't even know where to hide. If Xiao Jue knows, he Yan can't explain why she inquired about the he family. Since he was a dead man, he refused to reveal his secret, and it was meaningless to save his life. What's more, he committed many crimes, and his death was not worthy of regret.To die here is his best ending. It has been several days since the yard was haunted and wanted to be found his body.Outside thunder bursts, under the autumn rain, Heyan stumbled to the direction of the house.Although she used her body as bait to lure Ding Yi to relax her vigilance, she did suffer a lot of injuries. Today's body is no better than that of her predecessors. Ding Yi is not an ordinary person. She may have underestimated the power of he Rufei. The wound on the back was drenched by the rain, and the bloodstain flowed into the yard along with the rain, and was quickly washed away. He Yan felt that all his strength was disappearing.This is probably the most embarrassing time since she was born again. Fortunately, when she went out, Xiao Jue and feinu were not there, so they had not come back for a short time. She had to hurry back and change her clothes and pretend nothing had happened.The room is close in front of him, he Yan jumps in from the window, sees that there is no one in the room, and then he is relieved.She murmured, \"it's a good thing I haven't been found.\"As soon as the voice dropped, someone's voice came.\"You are too early to be happy.\"\"Pa\" a sound, the room suddenly big bright, he Yan whole people are frozen.There was a man sitting in front of the middle of the table, playing with the fire clasp in his hand. The lamp on the table was flickering. The man was beautiful and handsome, and his clothes were neat. He glanced at her slightly: \"back?\"It was Xiao Jue.He Yan's heart trembled for a moment, and quickly returned to his mind and said, \"uncle! This is a misunderstanding. I just found out I could see it. I met an assassin outside... \"Before she finished speaking, she saw that the young man sitting in front of her was already in front of her. He Yan stretched out his hand to block her. However, the point of the sword didn't want her life, so he took a bend to open her skirt.\"Shira --\"the clothes stained with blood were all reduced to pieces, and the girl's body was bright white and weak. From her chest, she was wrapped in layers of white cloth, like a budding bone.He Yan's face suddenly rose red.Xiao Jue from her back, sheath against Heyan's neck, breathing phase smell, sword drawn.\"Liars are in force.\"He hooked the corner of his lips, as if he were a young man in white robe who criticized the lazy, tired and romantic people under the tree. His voice was slightly ironic, and he said indifferently with a smile: \"should I call you Heyan or miss heta?\"End of Volume 2 www.novelhall.com , the fastest update of the webnovel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
