    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1 Python and Sparrow Swallow the DragonNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe brightly lit inner palace was a dazzling yet imposing sight. Green smoke rose in spirals from the green rock that burned within each oil lamp, and weaved about in the palace.The green rocks were blue sandalwood. They gave off a rare fragrance when burnt that had a meditative effect and was one of the necessities for cultivation. However, such items were not cheap. Hence, their usage as fuel was enough to show the status of the palace's owner.A middle-aged man stood within the inner palace with his hands behind his back. Unwavering determination decorated his face, and his eyes contained a dignified aura, evidence that he had occupied a high ranking position for a long time. A faint aura appeared to rise behind him, which seemed to fluctuate between fire and lightning as it emitted m.u.f.fled rumbling sounds.However, if one looked towards his right arm, one would find that there was nothing there. His right arm had been severed.At this man's side was a beautiful woman in palace garments. Her lovely body was slim, and her features were natural and pretty. However, her face appeared exceptionally pale and sickly.At this current time, the man and woman, whom were clearly of substantial status, had a sliver of worry on their faces, as they looked at the thirteen year old youngster seated on a bed in front of them. The youngster's body was rather frail and his eyes were tightly shut. However, a tendril of blood Qi circled on a face that should have been br.i.m.m.i.n.g with youthful energy.While the strange blood Qi roamed beneath his skin, the bitter and resentful howl of a dragon faintly echoed.As the dragon howl resounded, the veins on the youngster's forehead squirmed, while his body shook continuously. His face twisted as if he was bearing an indescribable pain.By the youngster's side was a white haired old man holding a copper mirror in his hand. Soft light s.h.i.+ned from the copper mirror onto the youngster's body. Under this light, the strange blood Qi on the youngster's face gradually began to calm down.The blood Qi persisted for a single incense stick of time before finally retreating. In the end, it withdrew into the youngster's palm.The white haired old man immediately breathed a sigh of relief as if he had been relieved of a great burden. Subsequently, he turned around and bowed to the worriedly waiting middle-aged man and beautiful woman in palace garments.\"Congratulations your majesties,\" he said. \"His highness has at long last pa.s.sed this triennial ordeal. There should be no problems in the following three years.\"Joy was revealed on the faces of the middle-aged man and woman in palace garments when they heard this, and their tightly clenched fists gradually loosened.The dignified man in bright yellow robes looked at the white haired elder in an expectant manner and asked, \"Master Qin, Yuan'er is already thirteen this year. Youngsters at this age usually have eight meridian channels, and can start their cultivation. What about Yuan'er?\"Upon hearing this question, the white haired elder's expression immediately dimmed somewhat, before he lightly shook his head and replied, \"Your majesty, I was still unable to find the eight meridian channels in his highness' body this time\u2026\"The dignified man's expression similarly dimmed when he heard this.In this world, the Dao of cultivation started within one's body. The body possessed countless meridian channels, and most important amongst them were the eight great channels. With the exception of some unique circ.u.mstances, an ordinary person's eight channels would gradually form when they were about thirteen years of age. It was at this time that these eight channels needed to be found. Only by finding the eight channels would one be able to start cultivating; by taking in the Genesis energy of the land, and opening the eight channels.This was the Channel Opening stage, and was where all cultivation began.Through this, cultivators were able to take in the Genesis energy of the land, and completely transform themselves. Hence, they were known as Genesis Masters.Master Qin gazed at the disappointment on the middle-aged man's face, and could not help but softly sigh, \"His highness was originally born with the sacred dragon blessing. He would have stunned the world and looked down upon the heavens. Who could have foreseen that such a calamity would occur\u2026\"The middle-aged man's fists clenched tightly, while the beautiful lady's eyes reddened. She covered her mouth and violently coughed twice.\"My queen, please take care of yourself,\" Master Qin hastily said upon seeing this. \"You have lost a great amount of essence blood from nouris.h.i.+ng his highness. You cannot allow your emotions to run wild.\"However, the beautiful lady in palace garments merely waved her hand. Sorrow surfaced in her eyes, as she looked at the youngster seated on the bed, \"The poison in Yuan'er's body erupts once every three years. Each outbreak is more serious than the last. He can only rely on himself to eradicate the poison, yet his eight meridian channels have yet to appear. What is to be done three years from now?\"Master Qin was silent for some time, before he slowly replied, \"After three years, external suppression will lose its effect, and if this situation persists, I'm afraid that his highness' hopes are bleak.\"The moment these words were said, silence blanketed the inner palace. The middle-aged man's fists tightly clenched, as his body faintly shook, while sobbing noises were emitted through the covered mouth of the lady in palace garments.A rather young yet calm voice suddenly emerged within this silence.\"Does that mean\u2026 I only have three years left?\"The three people in the palace were stunned upon hearing this. They quickly looked up, only to find that the youngster on the bed had opened his eyes at some unknown time, and was now staring at them.The three exchanged a look. It was evident that none of them had expected the youngster to awaken so quickly. In the past, he had remained unconscious for two or three days before slowly awakening.\"Yuan'er\u2026\"The name of this youngster, who had been called Yuan'er, was Zhou Yuan, and the middle-aged man and lady before his eyes were the king and queen of the Great Zhou Empire, Zhou Qing and Qin Yu.Zhou Yuan's young face was rather pale, as he pursed his lips. Perhaps because his body had been frail since young, he could only read books, and thus looked rather scholarly. After being silent for a moment, he slowly extended his hand.A dark blood-red lump could be seen at the center of his palm, which seemed to be embedded in the deepest part of his flesh. It slowly wiggled and squirmed, looking just like a threatening blood dragon. A faint yet extremely bitter and resentful aura seemed to rise from within it, causing one to s.h.i.+ver although it was not cold.\"Father, Mother\u2026 I believe it is time to tell me exactly what is happening to me, right?\"Zhou Yuan involuntarily gritted his teeth, as he stared at the tiny blood-dragon-like-thing on his palm. It was this very thing that made him feel what could be called pain beyond death.Every three years, this thing would begin to act up. It brought with it an endless pain, that felt as if it was devouring the flesh on his body inch by inch.When they heard Zhou Yuan's words, Zhou Qing and Qin Yu's faces lost a substantial amount of color. Zhou Qing in particular, tightly clenched his fists, as extreme remorse and self-blame surfaced on his face.This silence lasted for a long time. Even the atmosphere seemed to grow rather heavy, before Zhou Qing finally inhaled deeply, and said in a hoa.r.s.e voice, \"That is the Dragon's Resentment Poison.\"\"Dragon's Resentment Poison?\" Zhou Yuan's eyebrows were tightly knitted together, failing to comprehend.Zhou Qing's hands trembled somewhat as he tousled Zhou Yuan's hair and continued, \"It is time for you to know of these matters. Yuan'er, you should know that you are the sacred dragon of our Zhou Clan!\"Zhou Yuan could not help but let out a bitter laugh. Was there really such a miserable sacred dragon? Even the eight channels in his body could not be found.Zhou Qing sat down at Zhou Yuan's side. His voice was low as he spoke, \"Yuan'er, the current Great Zhou Empire can perhaps only be considered a small and unimportant country, but what you do not know, is that fifteen years ago, Great Zhou was a powerful nation. Every country came to pay homage to us, and our might was overwhelming to all.\"Shock surfaced on Zhou Yuan's small face. Amongst the numerous empires that dotted this boundless continent, Great Zhou Empire was really not very noteworthy at all. How could he ever imagine that it possessed such status in the past?\"Do you know of the Great Wu Empire?\" Zhou Qing slowly spoke each word of this name, as if he intended to carve it into his heart.\"The Great Wu Empire?\" Zhou Yuan nodded. The Great Wu Empire was one of the top level empires of this vast continent. It was a flouris.h.i.+ng nation that contained countless Genesis Masters. In comparison, Great Zhou was akin to a dwarf before a giant.Zhou Qing's eyes were dyed red bit by bit at this moment. Deep hatred was revealed within them, \"Then do you know that fifteen years ago, the current royal family of Great Wu was merely one of the subjects of the Great Zhou Empire?\"A sliver of astonishment finally appeared in Zhou Yuan's eyes. The Great Wu royal family was once a subject of Great Zhou? Was Great Zhou actually so powerful fifteen years ago?\"Then\u2026 then how did things turn out like this?\" Zhou Yuan could not help but inquire.\"When Great Zhou was established several hundred years ago, the Wu clan followed at our side, as we waged war all over. They were loyal and devoted va.s.sals. Later on, Great Zhou established a country, and in recognition of their service, we conferred upon the Wu clan the hereditary t.i.tle of king Wu, allowing them to enjoy an endless amount of privilege and power. And so in the next hundred years, the Wu clan guarded the Great Zhou's borders, intimidating anyone who saw them.\"Zhou Qing's body faintly shook, as veins of blood climbed out in his eyes, \"However, who could have expected that the Wu clan would suddenly rebel fifteen years ago? Only then did our Zhou royal clan realise that after hiding their strength and biding their time over the years, the Wu clan already possessed extremely great power, and even the numerous conferred kings had been enticed to their side.\"In the short period of less than a year, our Zhou clan was utterly defeated, and could only escape towards the south. We fled towards our Zhou clan's ancestral land, which is also now the current Great Zhou's territory.\"I do not know why the Wu clan rebelled, the status they enjoyed in Great Zhou was not the least bit less than the royal clan\u2026\"It was only later, that a spy obtained some information from the Wu clan. A certain prophecy that had been pa.s.sed down in the inner circle of the Wu clan for several hundred years\u2026\"\"A prophecy?\" Zhou Yuan was slightly stunned.Zhou Qing gritted his teeth, as he spat out each word, \"Python and sparrow swallow the dragon, and the Great Wu will rise and flouris.h.!.+\"\"Python and sparrow swallow the dragon, and the Great Wu will rise and flourish?\" Zhou Yuan softly repeated these words, but he failed to understand the meaning behind them. \"What does it mean?\"Zhou Qing's eyes turned scarlet red at this moment. Incomparable grief flooded his eyes as he stared at Zhou Yuan, \"Back then, I too did not understand the exact meaning behind these words, until a certain day\u2026\"\"After Great Zhou was completely defeated, I led what was left of our people, and continuously retreated. The Wu clan tightly pursued us till we came to this Great Zhou City beneath our feet. However, the Wu clan merely surrounded us and did not attack, as if they were waiting for something.\"\"What were they waiting for?\" Zhou Yuan felt a sense of unease.Zhou Qing stared at Zhou Yuan. From the expression on the former's face, it was as if he was crying inside. The mixture of such despair and anger made Zhou Yuan's heart tremble.\"They were waiting for you to be born.\"Zhou Qing's words caused Zhou Yuan's heart to shudder violently. He had been caught completely off guard.By the side, Zhou Yuan's mother, Qin Yu, was already covering her mouth. Sobs that had been suppressed to the limit were emitted.\"Do you know what it was like when you were born?\" Zhou Qing gazed at Zhou Yuan with red eyes. \"Yuan'er, the moment you were born, a mystical sign appeared in the heavens. Dragon Qi swirled around you, and a dragon roar shook the land. It was the sign of the sacred dragon.\"\"Your eight meridian channels naturally opened at birth, allowing you to skip the Channel Opening stage, and reach the Qi nouris.h.i.+ng level.\"\"This is known as the legendary one-in-a-billion sacred dragon blessing, which bestows upon one the potential to reach the greater cultivation stages. As our Zhou clan's unprecedented sacred dragon, you would have s.h.i.+ned as brightly as the sun and moon, and have the longevity of the land!\"Zhou Qing's voice was overflowing with emotion, while his entire body violently shook. One could imagine just how emotionally moved he had been when Zhou Yuan was born. The heavens had not forsaken the Zhou clan, and allowed them to welcome the birth of a sacred dragon during such a calamity.Zhou Yuan's eyes widened. It was clear that he was unable to believe that such a phenomenon had appeared when he was born.\"Then\u2026 then why\u2026?\" His hands trembled slightly, as he touched his body. Since his eight meridian channels were naturally open, why were they now unable to be found in his body?Zhou Qing's emotional voice came to an abrupt halt. The brilliance in his eyes seemed to vanish completely at this moment. There was only deep sadness within them, as he explained in a dejected manner, \"Because the moment you were born, king Wu's wife also gave birth to a son and daughter outside the city. Python Qi coiled around the baby boy, while spirit sparrow Qi was present around the baby girl's head. Both were also blessed by destiny!\"\"Moreover, according to the information we obtained, king Wu's wife had been pregnant for a whole three years without giving birth, yet she suddenly gave birth that day\u2026\"\"I never understood why before, but it finally became clear at that moment. It is said that those born on the same year, month, and day may devour each other's destiny. It turns out that the many years of plotting by the Wu clan was not simply targeted at Great Zhou, but at the dragon of our Zhou clan!\"Zhou Yuan's mouth opened and closed. A chill swiftly spread from the soles of his feet to the top of his head. \"It was a scheme!\"How could there be such a coincidence. It was obvious that this plot had been brewing for a hundred years, and was aimed at their Zhou clan\u2026 a grand scheme that was specifically aimed at him.For this, they had even used all means to stop king Wu's wife from giving birth for three years. It was all done in wait for him!Zhou Qing nodded his head, and continued in a hoa.r.s.e voice, \"It was indeed a scheme. The Wu clan had patiently waited in Great Zhou for several hundred years. They had fought our battles for us, and gained our full trust. However, who could have expected that their centuary long wait was all for your arrival!?\"\"That day, king Wu entered the city and threatened us with the lives of hundreds and millions of Great Zhou citizens. He wanted to seize your sacred dragon blessing in front of your mother and I\u2026\" At this point, tears of blood flowed out from Zhou Qing's eyes.By the side, Master Qin also wore an expression of sorrow, as he continued in a low voice, \"That day, to protect your highness, his majesty fought king Wu on the Great Zhou mountain, but was no match for the latter, and one of his arms was severed. If that king Wu was not afraid that the others would destroy his highness' sacred dragon blessing, it is likely that even his majesty would have died at the king Wu's hands.\"\"To smoothly seize his highness' destiny, king Wu made an oath. Great Wu would not take even half a step into Great Zhou for the next hundred years.\"As that frightening scene once again surged out from the depths of her mind, Qin Yu could no longer restrain her emotions. She fell to her knees before Zhou Yuan, tightly hugging him, as she started to sob in a heart wrenching manner.\"Yuan'er! My pitiful son! Mother has let you down!\"The cruel memories from that day were once again bloodily torn open. She clearly recalled how the recently born Zhou Yuan was used as an array eye, and placed on the altar that king Wu had set up.Joining him on the altar were king Wu's recently born son and daughter.However, one was being stolen from, while the other two were taking.The stripping of fate was akin to peeling off one's flesh. Such pain was unimaginable.The Qin Yu at that time had been glowing with joy mere moments before. She could only helplessly watch her child bear an endless amount of pain, so much so, that even his young cries became hoa.r.s.e.Such despair and powerlessness had caused her to faint.Urgh.Due to this sudden surge of emotions, Qin Yu's face instantly paled. A mouthful of fresh blood was involuntarily vomited, dyeing Zhou Yuan's hair red.\"What's wrong, mother?\" Zhou Yuan was greatly alarmed. He hastily helped Qin Yu wipe the blood at the corner of her mouth.Master Qin also rushed over from the side. Gentle energy spread from his palm, and poured into Qin Yu through the top of her head, helping her steady the Qi and blood in her body. He looked at the pale Qin Yu, before he sighed towards Zhou Yuan, \"Your highness, please do not blame his majesty and her majesty for being unable to protect you. Back then, his majesty had given his all, and almost died in battle.\"\"As for her majesty, after your destiny was stolen, she infused her own essence blood into your body. Subsequently, she gave you blood every year, allowing your highness to live till this day. However, her majesty had to pay an extremely huge price. Every time she gave her blood, her lifespan would be cut by three years. Over the past twelve years, her lifespan has already been shortened by thirty six years. This is an enormous blow to her health, and she now has less than ten years to live.\"\"What?! What did you say?!\"It was as if a lightning bolt had struck Zhou Yuan when he heard this. Veins of blood crazily climbed out in his eyes. He had never reacted so strongly even previously when he heard that his destiny had been stolen. After all, these events had occurred when he was still too young. Hence, he did not have overly strong feelings towards the sacred dragon blessing. Even if it was seized, he would only feel somewhat shocked.Although the fact that he had been the target of the Wu clan's century long plot had caused huge waves of shock to rise in his heart, he was able to suppress them. However, when he found out that they had forced his beloved mother to deplete her life force, an uncontrollable killing intent rose within Zhou Yuan's heart for the very first time.Thus, when Zhou Yuan heard Master Qin's words, he could no longer control his emotions. The blood in his body frantically rushed towards his head, causing his face to turn blood red. That delicate and immature face now appeared rather sinister.\"Wu clan, you dare to cause harm to my mother! You truly deserve to die!\"Zhou Yuan's eyes were blood red. Overflowing rage and killing intent surged in his heart, while his entire body shook.Zhou Qing carried Qin Yu, and leaned her against a jade couch. His hair seemed to be a little whiter, and his dignified aura had practically vanished as he numbly said, \"It has been said that since the Wu clan's foundations were weak, sufficient destiny is needed for them to establish a country, allow their line to continue, and awe everyone with their power. With regards to all this, your sacred dragon blessing was the ideal.\"\"King Wu seized your destiny, and granted it to his son and daughter. Henceforth, Great Wu was protected by the dragon and phoenix, allowing their country to prosper. The flouris.h.i.+ng Great Wu Empire owes everything to your stolen destiny.\"\"Meanwhile, forcibly taking away your sacred dragon blessing naturally gave rise to intense resentment. That king Wu purposely sealed this resentment in your body, thus creating the Dragon's Resentment Poison. It continuously strengthens itself by devouring your essence blood until a certain day where it will finally mature. Then, it will erupt and completely devour your life force.\"\"Meanwhile, your sacred dragon root was damaged, causing your naturally formed eight meridian channels to disappear. Till now, your eight meridian channels have yet to show themselves, making your journey of cultivation extremely difficult\u2026\"Zhou Qing's tone was rather bleak, and contained an endless feeling of powerlessness. It was difficult to imagine how much despair that day had been to their Zhou clan.On that day, the python and sparrow cried outside the city. Multi-colored lights had exploded, while they seized the opportunity to transform.On that day, the sacred dragon wailed inside the city, turning into green smoke that rose in spirals, before fading away.This was the python and sparrow swallowing the dragon.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

The atmosphere was so stifling that it made one unable to breath.Zhou Yuan gazed at Zhou Qing, who was seated beside him. The latter's usually imposing face was listless and filled with powerlessness at this moment. It was obvious that the events from back then had been a huge blow to him.His son's destiny had been stolen by his enemy right in front of him, destroying the former's foundations, and he had been completely powerless. It was possible to imagine what kind of humiliation that had been for any father.Zhou Yuan bit into his lips. He understood Zhou Qing's character. If it was not for the sake of protecting the hundreds and millions Great Zhou subjects, it was likely that he would have chosen to go down together with king Wu.\"So that is why my eight meridian channels have never appeared, making it difficult for me to start cultivating. This king Wu's methods are truly vicious.\" Zhou Yuan gazed at the slowly squirming bundle of dark red on his palm with anger in his eyes.Taking his destiny and destroying the roots of his sacred dragon had not been enough. This king Wu even intended to completely eliminate him by slowly forcing him to his death through the Dragon's Resentment Poison.What infuriated Zhou Yuan the most, was that his queen-mother had suffered greatly because of this, and she now had less than ten years to live.With a deep breath, Zhou Yuan slowly pushed down the surging rage in his heart. It felt as if his heart had been cut open by a blade when he looked towards the pale face of the sleeping Qin Yu by the side, and asked, \"Father, what can be done for mother? Herremaining life span\u2026\"Zhou Qing was silent for a while before he slowly replied, \"In this world exists mystical treasures that can extend one's life. If we can obtain such an item, we will be able to prolong your queen mother's life, however\u2026\"When he reached this point, Zhou Qing bitterly smiled, before continuing, \"Such mystical treasures are extremely rare. I once used the humongous manpower of Great Zhou to search, but we were still unable to find any.\"\"Great Zhou is after all nothing compared to back then. Now, we can only hole up here. We barely have the power to defend ourselves.\"Zhou Yuan's hand tightly clenched. At this moment, he finally understood the advantages of having power. If he had power, he would be able to search, even the most dangerous forbidden grounds, for those mystical treasures that could extend one's life span.However, the seemingly never showing eight meridian channels of his body made it such that he did not even have the power to protect himself.Zhou Yuan gritted his teeth, and spoke in a low voice, \"Father, am I truly unable to become aGenesis Master?\"His mother had lost her essence blood for his sake, reducing her lifespan. As her son, how could he possibly sit back and watch? Moreover\u2026 it might have been fine if he did not know of everything the Wu clan had done to Great Zhou and himself, but since he now knew, such a debt would not be written off so easily.But all of this could only be established if he possessed sufficient power.And in this world, the group of people with the greatest power were naturally Genesis Masters!Upon hearing Zhou Yuan's words, Zhou Qing's deeply frowned, as if he was thinking about something. A long while later, he finally replied in a soft voice, \"Are you truly unwilling to give up?\"Zhou Yuan lightly nodded. Although he had his fill of suffering and torture over the years, it had also led him to possess a maturity and determination that transcended those at his age.He knew that ever since the Wu clan rebelled and stole his destiny, there was already no way for both of them to coexist.The fact that Great Zhou was still alive today was all due to the vow that king Wu had made back then. Once the hundred year vow was over, it was easy to imagine how the Wu Empire would be the first to ma.s.sacre Great Zhou, preventing any future potential troubles.Hence, to change such an outcome, he needed to possess enough strength.Zhou Qing was rather gratified by the determination Zhou Yuan had shown. After being silent for some time, he roughly patted Zhou Yuan's shoulder. \"Good! Unwilling to easily give up. As expected of my son! Since you are willing, father will naturally do all he can to help you!\"Upon hearing these words from Zhou Qing, Zhou Yuan's eyes instantly brightened, pleasantly surprised as he said, \"Father has an idea?\"Zhou Yuan nodded. Soon after, he bitterly smiled and said, \"You shouldn't celebrate too early, because even I am not certain if this method will work.\"\"What method is it?\" The liveliness of a youngster was finally seen from Zhou Yuan's impatient appearance.\"The ancestral offering ceremony is three days later. This time, you will follow me to the ancestral grounds.\"Zhou Qing merely chuckled and did not explain in detail. Soon after, he paused before continuing, \"However I have one condition for you.\"\"What condition?\" Zhou Yuan was stunned and he curiously asked.Zhou Qing sternly said, \"Regardless of whether you are able to unlock your meridian channels, you cannot give up on studying Genesis runes. You must know that if your eight meridian channels are not unlocked, Genesis rune cultivation will be the final path you can take. If you are able to ascend to the peak of Genesis rune cultivation, it may be possible to suppress the Dragon's Resentment Poison in your body.\"Genesis Masters were the most prevalent power in this world, however, it was not the only path. There were many different styles and paths, and the path of Genesis runes was the most broad and deep amongst them.During the time where Zhou Yuan's eight meridian channels had yet to appear, under Zhou Qing's instruction, Zhou Yuan studied the Dao of Genesis runes. As the saying went, having more skills will not burden oneself. In fact, many Genesis Masters would also have some basic understand of Genesis runes.Zhou Yuan lightly nodded his head upon hearing this. Truth be told, he understood the underlying meaning behind Zhou Qing's words. He was worried that Zhou Yuan would abandon himself to despair if his eight meridian channels still did not appear, denying him from becoming a Genesis Master, and in the end give up on that final path.Zhou Qing nodded, as a happy smile formed on his face.\"Rest for today. You still have to go to the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute to study. I will bring you to the ancestral grounds three days later.\"\"Okay!\" The youngster's voice was br.i.m.m.i.n.g with antic.i.p.ation.Zhou Qing chuckled as he tousled Zhou Yuan's hair. Subsequently, he carried the unconscious Qin Yu and walked out of the inner palace with Master Qin at his side.Zhou Yuan gazed at Zhou Qing's back. The usually dignified back currently gave off powerless and tired aura that made one sad. He knew that there was a time when his father was filled with grand aspirations. However, cruel reality had little by little whittled away these aspirations.All of this was because of that king Wu.Zhou Yuan's lips tightly pursed as a chilling look surfaced on his rather scholarly and young face.\"Wu clan, king Wu\u2026 I will make sure that these debts are paid back one by one in the future!\"...The next day.When early morning arrived, Zhou Yuan left the palace under the protection of a group of guards, heading straight for the north-west district of Great Zhou City where the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute was located.Zhou Qing had personally given the command to establish the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute years ago. At the same time, he had gathered the experts in the army to become tutors. The Great Zhou Inst.i.tute did not discriminate when it came to accepting students, as long as one had enough talent, even the commoners were allowed into the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute to practice cultivation.Over the years, the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute had groomed several outstanding individuals, hence allowing its status to grow greater and greater in the Great Zhou Empire. Thus, even his royal highness Zhou Yuan would come here to study.The gates of the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute were tightly guarded. Guards in armor rigorously checked the ident.i.ties of all who entered. However, Zhou Yuan was naturally exempt from this procedure. After all, everyone in Great Zhou City recognized the prince.\"Greetings your highness!\"Therefore, the guards respectfully bowed to Zhou Yuan when he appeared at the gates.\"Your highness.\" Several Great Zhou Inst.i.tute students came and went along the way. There was a some respect in their expressions as they smiled at Zhou Yuan.Zhou Yuan likewise returned their smiles and cupped his fists together in greeting. He knew that most of these students were commoners, and the respect they had for him was mostly due to his father's establishment of the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute. It had allowed commoners like them to raise their status, and gave them the chance to change their destinies.West district of the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute.Desks were arranged in a orderly manner within a rather s.p.a.cious and bright teaching hall. Numerous youths were seated in a kneeling position before the desks. It was a tranquil atmosphere.Zhou Yuan also quietly seated on the first desk of the first row. A bright and clean looking jade tablet, while a dark red long brush lay by its side.The body of this brush was made entirely of red jade, while the hairs of the brush head came from the softest belly hair of a flame rat. Light glimmered on the fine hairs. It was a Genesis Rune Brush.When it came to the most important item for drawing Genesis Runes, everyone would answer these three same words; Genesis Rune Brush.A Genesis Rune Brush was the medium for Genesis Runes. Only with a brush would one be able to draw the mysterious and profound Genesis Runes, draw in the Genesis Qi of the land, and display great power.Hence, nothing more needed to be said about the importance of the Genesis Rune Brush. Without it, no matter how great one's talent in Genesis Runes, the power of one's Genesis Runes would suffer.Zhou Yuan held the red jade Genesis Rune Brush, while he looked to the very front, where a middle-aged lecturer was lecturing with a calm voice.\"Focus your soul into the tip of the brush to draw each stroke. Every line and stroke must be drawn with one's soul as the ink. Only then will the drawn Genesis Runes be able to utilise the Genesis Qi of the land.\"\"You must remember that when drawing Genesis Runes, one's heart must be akin to still water, and no distractions can be present. Only by making the Genesis Rune Brush a part of your body, will you be able to focus your soul into the tip of the brush, such that the brush and your will become one, allowing any action to be smoothly completed with a single breath.\"\"......\"After finis.h.i.+ng his explanations, the lecturer said, \"Next, we will continue practising the three Genesis Runes that I taught you last month. I hope that someone will be able to successfullycomplete one of the three today.\"The moment these words were said, cries of grief rang could be heard in the lecture hall, and many youths had pained looks on their faces. Though practising Genesis Runes might seem simple, every practise session would exhaust one's spirit, and make one feel extremely worn out.When he heard their cries, the middle-aged lecturer spoke out in a stern and angry manner, \"Humph, stop your whining. The three runes that I taught you; Rampaging Bull Rune, Light Body Rune and Metal Skin Rune are merely elementary level.\"His voice was br.i.m.m.i.n.g with resentment towards these students of his whom had failed to meet his expectations.The many youths shrunk back when they saw that their lecturer had been angered, and did not dare to make any more noise. Afterwhich, all of them grabbed their Genesis Rune Brushes and started to draw on the jade tablets before them.Zhou Yuan smiled slightly. Brush in hand, he started to focus, and the surrounding noise was immediately shut out. His heart was akin to a serene pond as he concentrated on the clean jade tablet. Rays of light emerged between his brows, and the tip of the brush started to flicker with faint red light.Zhou Yuan's brush fell, and the brush tip slowly moved across the jade tablet, leaving behind several complicated strokes. These strokes looked like the horns of an antelope, and gave off a certain charm. When they were completely a.s.sembled together, they seemed topossess a magical power.Every Genesis Rune was made from numerous strokes and lines. In general, the more strokes and lines there were, the greater the quality and might of the Genesis Rune formed.The rune that Zhou Yuan was currently drawing was the Metal Skin Rune. It was merely an elementary level rune, and had over a hundred strokes. However, a tremendous amount of practise was required to perfectly draw the over hundred strokes.The tip of Zhou Yuan's brush quietly flowed like water. There was no hesitation at all, and its movement had a natural and a free flowing kind of beauty.Due to the fact that the eight meridian channels in his body had not appeared in the past year, practically all of Zhou Yuan's time had been spent practising Genesis Runes. Thus, his foundations were far stronger than the other students.Of course, the most important factor was that he could sense that his soul was stronger than ordinary people. Although his destiny had been seized, and his sacred dragon root damaged, it seemed that his soul had fortunately not been hurt. It was likely that his soul had yet to fully form because he had been too young, hence allowing it to avoid that disaster.Several minutes later, Zhou Yuan's slender hand made a light curving movement downwards, and a radiance suddenly emerged from the jade tablet in front of him. One could only watch as a complex and beautiful Genesis Rune slowly took shape.\"Good, good. The strokes are perfect and full of liveliness. This Metal Skin Rune can be considered a successful masterpiece.\" The moment Zhou Yuan completed his work, an exclamation of admiration was suddenly heard from the side.Zhou Yuan lifted his head, only to find that the lecturer had been standing beside him since some unknown time, and was currently looking at the Genesis Rune on his jade tablet with a smile of appreciation.The other youths in the lecture hall raised their heads and looked towards Zhou Yuan. There was some surprise in their eyes. They had yet to even start, while Zhou Yuan had already succeeded.The lecturers mood was much better as he lamented towards the many students, \"It would be nice if all of you learned as well as him.\"The youths chuckled and shook their heads upon hearing this. His highness Zhou Yuan was clearly rather talented in this area. How could the lecturer expect everyone to be so good?However, a strange laughter suddenly rang out amongst the chuckles.\"Hehe, lecturer's words might be a little unfair. Most of our efforts are concentrated in opening our meridian channels, hence we naturally cannot put our hearts and soul into the study of Genesis Runes like his highness. Otherwise, would we not be putting the cart before the horse?\"This laughter was rather piercing, and immediately silenced the lecture hall, as numerous gazes s.h.i.+fted over.Zhou Yuan slightly raised his eyebrows and likewise cast his gaze over. Subsequently, he saw a youth in embroidered clothes looking back at him with a superficial smile as the latter lazily twirled the Genesis Rune Brush in his hand.The corners of this smile had slight hints of mockery.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 Su YouweiPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe lecture hall was instantly quietened by the sudden words of the youth in embroidered clothes. All the youths that looked towards the former silently withdrew their gazes, because the status of the one who had spoken was not ordinary at all.The youth in embroidered clothes name was Xu Lin. His father was a senior official of the Great Zhou Empire's western province. Of course, Xu Lin's status was naturally far lower than the prince of the Great Zhou Empire, Zhou Yuan. However, everyone knew that Xu Lin had the backing of the little prince of Qi Manor, Qi Yue.Zhou Yuan lightly tapped his fingers on the desk as he looked at Xu Lin, before indifferently withdrawing his gaze. When it came to currying favor with Qi Yue, this fellow was truly unscrupulous.\"Since this Xu Lin fawns over Qi Yue so much\u2026 it is likely that his father has also thrown his lot in with king Qi's camp\u2026\"Zhou Yuan's eyes seemed to become somewhat deeper. He had once heard his father mention that this king Qi was backed by the Great Wu Empire Therefore, he had constantly stirred up trouble behind the scenes over the years. It was obvious that he intended to disrupt the peace of Great Zhou.Moreover, because Zhou Qing was afraid of giving Great Wu an excuse to deal with the Great Zhou Empire, he could not openly take action against king Qi, However, there was naturally a battle going on between the two parties behind the scenes.It was due to this relations.h.i.+p that there were similarly sparks between Qi Yue and Zhou Yuan in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute.Xu Lin's mocking smile grew even wider when he saw that Zhou Yuan did not retort. Just as Xu Lin was about to speak again, the lecturer suddenly glared at him in a stern manner, causing him to have no choice but to shut his mouth.After all, it would be a huge loss for him if he was expelled from the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute.As the two parties became silent, the atmosphere in the lecture hall was gradually restored. The lecturer continued to elaborate on the three Genesis Runes until two incense sticks of time later, when the bell started to ring.\"Alright, I'll have to stop here today. We will continue tomorrow.\" The lecturer kept his belongings and walked out of the lecture hall.As the lecturer left, the tense atmosphere in the hall immediately became relaxed. The many youths congregated together as lively laughter and noise erupted.Zhou Yuan absent-mindedly tidied his desk in preparation to leave.\"Your highness.\"While he was tidying up, he suddenly heard a gentle voice. Zhou Yuan raised his head, and saw a girl smiling at him in front of his desk.This girl wore the uniform of the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute. Although it was a little large on her, the contours of her well developed curves could still be seen. That simple pair of pants truly made those long and slender legs stand out.Her fair skin, raised nose, shapely eyebrows and almond-like eyes were all evidence that she was a beauty in the making. In particular, the tear-shaped birthmark at the corner of her eye gave her a sort of unique charm.Her rosy little lips were currently slightly pursed. Although she wore no costly jewelry and looked rather plain, she had a strong look paired with a long pony-tail that bounced with vitality.Merely standing there drew the coverted gazes of numerous boys in the lecture hall.Zhou Yuan looked at the pretty girl as a smile emerged on his scholarly face. \"Oh, it's Youwei.\"The girl's family name was Su, and her name was Youwei.Su Youwei's pretty face reddened a little as she met Zhou Yuan's gaze. Subsequently, she looked away and her gaze fell upon Zhou Yuan's messy desk as she knelt down and said, \"Your highness, I had better help you tidy up.\"Zhou Yuan chuckled and did not reject. After all, the relations.h.i.+p between the two of them was indeed not ordinary.Hence, the girl started to busy herself with Zhou Yuan's study desk, helping him neatly tidy up everything. This drew the gazes of numerous boys in the study hall. Their eyes seemed to be about to burn holes through Zhou Yuan, and the envy within them was practically bursting out.\"Has your grandfather recovered from his illness?\" As Zhou Yuan watched the busy girl, he propped up his chin with his hand and asked.Su Youwei slightly lifted her pretty face when she heard Zhou Yuan's words as her fair hand pulled back a stray strand of hair that had fallen in front of her eyes. Soon after, a smile emerged on her face.\"He has made a full recovery. Grandfather says he wants to invite your highness over if you have time, but our house is just a little too unsightly, I'm afraid\u2026\"Zhou Yuan smiled and said, \"Alright, I'll go during our next vacation period.\"Su Youwei gently bit the red lips of her little mouth when she heard Zhou Yuan reply without the slightest hesitation. A glimmer of water seemed to flash in her eyes as she looked towards him, before she hastily lowered her head, afraid that he would see it.She still remembered the day she met Zhou Yuan a year ago.It was perhaps the most despairing day of her life, but was also the same day that she started to welcome hope once again.On that day, the grandfather whom she had relied on since young had fallen deathly ill, causing her already broken family to completely fall apart. She had no choice but to brave the torrential rain with her grandfather on her tiny back in search of help. Because they lacked money, she could only kneel before each clinic, crying as she implored for their aid, hoping that a doctor would be able to save her grandfather.The her from back then had been drenched in mud, a sight that was miserable to the extreme.In the end, every single clinic's door remained coldly closed. Under the pouring rain, she felt the entire sky darken as her heart grew cold as ice.Just as her desperation was about to reach a numbing level, she sensed someone walk to her side and place an umbrella in her hand, before walking forward and barbarically kicking open the tightly shut doors of the clinic in front of her unfocused gaze.At that time, a cold voice seem to have rang out.\"Open up and save this person!\"The one who had kicked open the doors of the clinic was naturally Zhou Yuan. Back then, Su Youwei could only blankly gaze upon his back. In the past, the ones she had most hated were those children from wealthy families, yet, at that very moment, she knew that she would never forget the back of the boy who had kicked open those large doors...It was from that very day that she came to be acquainted with Zhou Yuan. Later on, she discovered his ident.i.ty; the royal highness of the Great Zhou Empire.Later on, Zhou Yuan had by chance discovered her talent for cultivation. Hence, he had recommended her into the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute. It was then that she started to undergo a magnificent transformation...The very first month after she entered the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute, she successfully opened the first meridian channel, becoming the fastest channel opener ever since the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute's establishment. Henceforth, she also became the so-called genius that everyone in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute spoke of.This sudden change from being an existence no one took notice of to the center of attention felt rather unnatural for Su Youwei. Moreover, there were times when people would find the relations.h.i.+p between her and Zhou Yuan unsightly, and secretly say that Zhou Yuan had only helped her because he had taken fancy to her looks.However, Su Youwei merely smiled in response. Only she clearly knew what a dirty and malnourished little girl she had been when she first met Zhou Yuan...\"Hey, how high are you going to stack my books?\" Zhou Yuan helplessly looked at Su Youwei. The latter was obviously a little out of it at the moment. She had stacked the books on his table into a giant pyramid that reached the heavens.\"Ah?\" Su Youwei returned to reality and saw her masterpiece. Her little face immediately turned beet-red as she hurriedly unstacked the books. \"Sorry your highness, I will redo it!\"This appearance of hers was clearly even more adorable, causing the gazes that were looking at Zhou Yuan to instantly turn much fiercer. If not for Zhou Yuan status as a prince, it was likely that they would have long rushed out to save their G.o.ddess.Upon sensing their gazes, Zhou Yuan could only shake his head as he whispered, \"Now that you've become so pretty, I no longer dare to order you about.\"Su Youwei softly laughed when she heard this and said, \"Then I'll have to smear some dirt on my face in future to make myself a little uglier.\"Zhou Yuan could only roll his eyes in response.\"Oh, that's right\u2026\" Zhou Yuan pointed at the table as he continued, \"How many meridian channels have you opened so far?\"Su Youwei was slightly taken aback. She glanced at Zhou Yuan, before very cautiously replying, \"I've already opened the third meridian channel.\"She knew that Zhou Yuan seemed to be unable to open his channels and cultivate for some unknown reason. Thus, she would not voluntarily bring up the topic of opening channels when the two were together, and never flaunted her progress. She was afraid that this sensitive topic would upset Zhou Yuan.\"The third already. At this rate, all eight channels will be fully opened in one or two years.\" Zhou Yuan sighed in admiration. Su Youwei's talent in cultivation was obviously extremely outstanding. In less than a year, she had already accomplished what others had worked years to achieve.This made him exceptionally pleased. Looks like he had unintentionally picked up a treasure.\"There's only two more months to this year's newcomer exam, so work hard, try to unblock your fourth meridian channel, and aim for the top ten. I spent a great deal of effort to secure a slot for you. As long as you are ranked amongst the top then, you will be able to receive personal guidance from the inst.i.tute head and the other instructors. This will be extremely beneficial for you.\" said Zhou Yuan.Su Youwei's tiny hand suddenly stiffened as she was tidying up the table. She lowered her head and did not dare to look at Zhou Yuan.\"What is it?\" Zhou Yuan was rather puzzled when he sensed this change in her.Su Youwei's was practically burying her head in her chest as she replied in a tiny voice, \"I, I no longer have the partic.i.p.ation token.\"Zhou Yuan was stunned. Soon after, his eyebrows tightly furrowed as he inquired, \"What happened?\"His tone was not stern, but it caused Su Youwei's heart to beat a little faster. Her pearly white teeth bit into her red lips, and she did not speak for a long time. Instead, a girl who was rather close to Su Youwei interjected from the side, \"Who else but Xu Lin. A few days ago, he was spreading bad rumours about you in the inst.i.tute, causing Youwei to argued with him and demand an apology. That fellow said that he would apologize if Youwei beat him in a match, but if she lost, she would have to give him her entry token for the newcomer exam.\"Zhou Yuan's brows were tightly furrowed. \"That Xu Lin has only opened two meridian channels. He should not have been able to beat Youwei, right?\"The girl frowned and said, \"Youwei only opened her third channel recently, while Xu Lin was also extremely shameless. He had the advantage of a Genesis weapon, and eventually managed to beat Youwei by some fluke.\"Zhou Yuan's expression was rather ugly. He stared at Su Youwei's lowered head and scolded, \"Why did you not tell me earlier?\"Su Youwei's fair hands were clasped together as she softly said, \"It's me who is useless, I don't want to cause more trouble for your highness.\"Zhou Yuan felt a little sorry when he saw this appearance of hers. The stubbornness of this la.s.s would really give one a headache at times. Therefore, his cold gaze s.h.i.+fted towards the smilingly watching Xu Lin inside the lecture hall.\"Setting a trap to bully a girl. Your methods are truly great huh?\" Zhou Yuan sneered. This fellow clearly had his eye on the newcomer exam entry token in Su Youwei's hands. Thus, he had intentionally goaded her into using it as a wager.Xu Lin lazily replied, \"I don't know what your highness is talking about. There are many people who saw me use my own strength to win. I will no return it even if your highness personally asks.\"Zhou Yuan coldly said, \"Do you dare to wager it on another fight?\"Xu Lin chuckled. \"Not interested.\"His previous victory had been mere luck. Moreover, Su Youwei had already opened her third meridian channel, and he would definitely not be her match.Zhou Yuan icily smiled as his eyes swept towards Xu Lin. \"I don't intend for you to fight Youwei. I'm saying that you and I will fight!\"As he spoke, he fished out a glowing jade pendant and placed it on the study desk. \"If you win, this Genesis Gathering Jade will be yours.\"A series of gasps immediately erupted in the hall as numerous gazes looked at the jade pendant with longing. This Genesis Gathering Jade was very advantageous for cultivation. If worn long enough, it would be able to increase the rate of opening one's eight meridian channels. A rather pricey and precious item indeed.\"Your highness!\" Su Youwei was greatly alarmed.It was not due to the Genesis Gathering Jade, but because Zhou Yuan wanted to personally deal with Xu Lin. Zhou Yuan had not opened even a single meridian channel, how could he possibly be a match for Xu Lin who had opened two?Zhou Yuan waved his hand at Su Youwei to stop. He toyed with the jade pendant as he smiled at Xu Lin in a mocking manner.\"Do you have the courage to fight now?\"Xu Lin's eyes were burning with desire as he stared at the Genesis Gathering Jade and licked his lips. He then coldly chuckled at Zhou Yuan and said, \"Since your highness insists on gifting this Genesis Gathering Jade to me, it will be rude to refuse.\"\"However, as the saying goes, fists and feet have no eyes. Please do not blame me if yourhighness is injured.\"Although Zhou Yuan's actions baffled Xu Lin, he did not believe that a person like him, who had opened two meridian channels, would be unable to defeat someone who had not even opened a single channel!Zhou Yuan declined to comment and said, \"I hope that you are as skilled as you say.\"Xu Lin laughed loudly, believing that Zhou Yuan was merely being sharp-tongued. With a swing of Xu Lin's sleeves, he walked out of the hall as laughter tinged with amus.e.m.e.nt and ridicule continued to resound from outside.\"Alright, I will wait for your highness at the practice grounds. I really want to see how your highness will win back the newcomer exam partic.i.p.ation token!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 The Power of Genesis RunesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPractice grounds of the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute.Many practice platforms stood in the practice grounds, while the numerous youths atop them yelled out as they exchanged blows. Each punch and kick had the vigour and ferocity of a tiger, a rather imposing sight. Below the platforms were crowd of spectators who would burst into cheers from time to time. There was no lack of young and pretty girls amongst the crowds, and their pretty watching eyes made the boys on the platforms fight with even more enthusiasm, hoping to show off their moves and thus bask in the limelight.It evident that this practice grounds was a rather popular location in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute.When Xu Lin lazily walked onto a platform, news of his fight with Zhou Yuan had already been secretly spread by the former to the entire practice grounds.\"What? His highness Zhou Yuan is going to fight with Xu Lin?!\"\"How is that possible! His highness Zhou Yuan has yet to open even his first meridian channel, on the other hand, Xu Lin had already opened two!\"\"This Xu Lin is truly a bully, he surely used some despicable means to force Zhou Yuan.\"\"......\"When the many students heard this news, cries of disbelief and surprise immediately erupted. Some of the commoner students felt that such a fight was really a little too unfair for Zhou Yuan.For any Channel Opening stage pract.i.tioner, the opening of every meridian channel would raise the innate quality of one's body. Strength, speed, reflexes etc. far surpa.s.sed those who had yet to open their channels. To put it bluntly, a Channel Opening stage pract.i.tioner was able to effortlessly defeat dozens of cultivators who had yet to open their channels.Atop the stage, Xu Lin merely chuckled when he heard these voices. No matter what they said, after today, his vicious beating of Zhou Yuan would definitely spread to the entire Great Zhou Inst.i.tute. Such news would undoubtedly be a blow to Zhou Yuan's reputation, thus making him a laughing stock.While these malicious thoughts swirled in Xu Lin's head, the black ma.s.s of a crowd around the practice platform suddenly split apart. One could only watch as a thin youth slowly walked forward.This thin youth had a scholarly face and gave off an aura of culture. He looked just like a weak and delicate scholar.Naturally, this was Zhou Yuan.Under the many varied gazes, Zhou Yuan headed straight for the practice platform where Xu Lin was.\"Your highness.\" Su Youwei's little face was somewhat anxious as she followed closely behind him. It was clear that she still wanted Zhou Yuan to give up on fighting Xu Lin.Zhou Yuan gently smiled at Su Youwei and said, \"I can no longer back off at this point. Or else, I will be known as the prince who ran away just before the battle.\"Su Youwei's footstops stopped as she tightly bit into her red lips. She knew that it would indeed be a huge blow to his reputation.Su Youwei lifted her pretty face and looked at Xu Lin, who was stop the practice platform. At this very moment, her eyes slightly narrowed, and seemed to become a little ferocious.\"Your highness, it is my fault for not handling matters properly this time and causing trouble for your highness. In future, I will no longer be careless nor merciful.\" said Su Youwei in a soft voice.Truth be told, she had lost to Xu Lin previously mainly because she was lacking in ruthlessness. Otherwise, Xu Lin would not even have the chance to use his Genesis weapon. This lesson allowed her to understand that if one does not give the snake a fatal blow, one would surely be bitten.Zhou Yuan was a little stunned. He blinked at Su Youwei and said, \"We are friends. It is only right for a friend to help settle another's problems.\"By the time his words faded, he had already stopped onto the practice platform.Su Youwei smiled a little as she gazed at his back. A warm feeling flowed within her heart. Soon after, her eyes slightly lowered; she had already made a decision. If Xu Lin dared to hurt Zhou Yuan, she would let the former know the meaning of a little girl's grudge and vengeance.\"Oh? Your highness actually dared to come. I had believed that you would secretly run away to the palace.\" Xu Lin mocked with a smile as he watched Zhou Yuan, who had walked to his front.Zhou Yuan gently arranged his sleeves as he said, \"Looks like you are very confident in yourself.\"\"I never imagined that even someone like your highness would act so rashly for a pretty girl. This seems to be rather unwise.\" Xu Lin shrugged his shoulders. It was clear that he believed Zhou Yuan's rash behaviour was to gain Su Youwei's favor.\"Let's begin.\" Zhou Yuan had no intentions of continuing this nonsensical bantar. His legs slid away from each other and seemed to tightly root themselves to the ground like an old tree, before he beckoned to Xu Lin. \"I'll allow you to attack first.\"The moment these words were said, the numerous youths surrounding the platform looked to each other. They did not understand what Zhou Yuan was thinking. He was clearly the weaker party, yet he still acted so wantonly.\"Since your highness cannot wait to be humiliated, I'll have to oblige.\" Being looked down upon by Zhou Yuan in this manner caused rage to rise in Xu Lin's heart. With a sneer, his foot powerfully stamped on the ground, and his body shot out like an arrow. Five fingers were tightly clenched into a fist as a punch flew towards Zhou Yuan.This punch of Xu Lin brought with it a stream of air and was full of power. If it hit a rock, a crack form.Zhou Yuan watched the powerful punch fly towards him and made no movements to dodge. He merely crossed his arms before him in a defensive posture.However, when the crowd below say this stance of his, they could not bear to continue watching. With Xu Lin's two channel opened body, this punch would likely break Zhou Yuan's bones.Under the nervous gazes of the crowd, Xu Lin was akin to fierce tiger. He held nothing back as his overbearing punch heavily slammed into Zhou Yuan's arms.Dong!A m.u.f.fled sound rang out. Next, the crowd was unsurprised to see Zhou Yuan's feet draw two several meter long trails on the ground before he managed to stabilize his body.Ah!A miserable cry erupted.However, the cry had not erupted from Zhou Yuan but Xu Lin.Everyone was dumbstruck as they watched this scene. Xu Lin screamed miserably as he hugged his fist. His fist was entire red, as if it had been smashed onto hard steel.Xu Lin howled at Zhou Yuan, \"You! What did you hide in your sleeves?! Despicable!\" Xu Lin was in so much pain that even tears were about to flow from his eyes.The surrounding gazes looked towards Zhou Yuan in astonishment. Could his highness have used some petty trick?Under the crowd's apprehensive gazes, Zhou Yuan slowly pulled back his sleeves. Subsequently, the crowd discovered a complicated rune of light on his arms. The rune emitted faint black light that spread and covered Zhou Yuan's arms. At a glance, it seemed as if his skin had turned to incomparably hard black metal.\"This\u2026\"Numerous students were shocked as they gazed at this complicated rune. In the end, some suddenly cried out, \"That is the Metal Skin Rune that the lecturer had taught previously!\"A flash of understanding struck everyone. It was a Genesis Rune!Su Youwei's tense heart relaxed at this moment. She breathed a sigh of relief as she said, \"So his highness is already able to draw a Genesis Rune on his body.\"Xu Lin came back to his senses as he stared at the black Genesis Runes on Zhou Yuan's arms and said in disbelief, \"You, you actually drew a Genesis Rune on your body?!\"Although Xu lin had seen Zhou Yuan draw a Metal Skin Rune in the lecture hall previously, it had only been drawn on a jade tablet. To draw it on the body, one needed to be proficient in the locations of the acupuncture points and meridian channels of the body. Only then would one be able to prevent the Genesis Rune from harming the body. Hence, drawing a Genesis Rune on the body was far more challenging than drawing it on a jade tablet.Yet, while they were still unable to draw Genesis Runes on jade tablets, Zhou Yuan had already started to learn and even use it\u2026 this gap was not small.\"Did you really believe that I would be powerless just because I have not opened my channels?\" said Zhou Yuan with a smile.Xu Lin's face was steely green, and had a look of anger from being toyed with as he coldly said, \"Do you really believe that you will be able to beat me by relying on a Metal Skin Rune?\"\"I'll let you have a good look at the gap between a Channel Opening stage pract.i.tioner and one that has yet to open any channels!\"\"Channel open!\"As Xu Lin roared, faint lines of flowing light emerged around his body. The dust under his feet swept outwards as Genesis Qi poured into his body in sync with his breathing.Huu huu.Even his clothes started to flutter at this moment.The surface of his skin began to glow, and everyone could feel Xu Lin's aura rapidly soar at this moment.The expressions of the many students slightly changed. There was now Genesis Qi flowing within Xu Lin's body. Genesis Qi circulating within his meridian channels would undoubtedly cause his power and speed to rise sharply.Under the numerous grim gazes of the students, Zhou Yuan stared at Xu Lin as he muttered to himself, \"Opening two channels huh\u2026\"\"Since I let you attack first, it is now my turn.\"The instant these words were spoken, Zhou Yuan's foot had already stamped on the ground as his body charged straight at Xu Lin.\"Arrogant. Your speed, power and the innate quality of your body is now not even a tenth of my own. You still dare to attack?\" Xu Lin sneered when he saw Zhou Yuan charging towards him.\"Is that so?\"The corners of Zhou Yuan's mouth seemed to form a smile.In the next instant, faint light suddenly surfaced at his ankles, and one could vaguely see runes of light spreading on them.Rustle!Zhou Yuan's body seemed to become much lighter at this moment, and his speed sharply increased as he pounced forward like a cheetah.\"That is\u2026 that is the Light Body Rune!\" Someone with good eyesight immediately cried out when he saw the light runes on Zhou Yuan's ankles.While this cry rang out, Zhou Yuan had already closed in on Xu Lin. With a sudden jerk of the former's shoulder, a faint glow emerged from inside his sleeves. Although it was not clear, everyone could clearly feel that Zhou Yuan's fist was now filled with rampaging power.\"Rampaging Bull Rune!\" Another piercing cry was heard. As Zhou Yuan neared Xu Lin, the former's arm suddenly jerked as a faint glow spread from under his clothes. Although it was barely discernible, everyone could clearly feel the rampaging power that filled Zhou Yuan's flying fist.Metal Skin Rune, Light Body Rune, Rampaging Bull Rune!At this time, even Su Youwei could not help but cover her tiny mouth while disbelief filled her pretty face. In a short span of several breaths, Zhou Yuan had activated three Genesis Runes in succession.This also meant that the three Genesis Runes taught by the lecturer had already been mastered by Zhou Yuan and even used on himself.Bang!Under both the watching eyes of the crowd and Xu Lin's horrified eyes, a fist containing domineering power had already slammed into Xu Lin's body in an incomparably swift and violent manner.Dong!With the aid of these three Genesis Runes, the current Zhou Yuan's speed, power and innate body quality was clearly not inferior to Xu Lin. Hence, when this punch landed, Xu Lin felt a giant surge of force. His body was directly blown away, before smas.h.i.+ng onto the ground outside the practice arena.The originally noisy surroundings of the platform turned deathly silent at this moment. Numerous youths stared at Zhou Yuan in disbelief.No one could have imagined that the fight would end in such a way.Atop the platform, Zhou Yuan slowly withdrew his fist. The runes of light on his arms swiftly faded as if they had used up all their power.He ma.s.saged his wrist, jumped off the platform and fished out a piece of jade from Xu Lin's clothes. It was the partic.i.p.ation token for the newcomer exam.\"Can't even beat a person who has yet to open a single meridian channel. It's best that you miss this year's newcomer exam to avoid losing face.\" Zhou Yuan merely smiled in response to Xu Lin's death stare.Upon hearing these words, Xu Lin once again felt the mocking gazes around him. A miserable feeling filled his heart, and he could not help but vomit a mouthful of fresh blood. The scene before his eyes turned to darkness as he fainted.He knew that starting tomorrow, he would become the newest laughing stock of the many the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute students...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 Qi Yue and Liu XiPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Alright, the show is over, everyone can scatter now.\" Zhou Yuan tossed and caught the jade piece in his hand before smiling at the numerous spectators.Upon hearing his words, the crowd smiled back and left. However, there was an additional trace of amazement in their gazes when they took one final look at Zhou Yuan before they left. This was because the fact that Zhou Yuan was unable to open his channels was long known by everyone in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute. Thus, many people believed although this prince of theirs had a high status, he did not have any power.However, the scene today made them completely drop this belief.Zhou Yuan was indeed temporarily unable to open his channels, but he wielded another kind of power; Genesis Runes. With Genesis Runes, even someone like Xu Lin, who had opened two meridian channels, was not the former's match.In this world, status was admittedly also a kind of power. However, the power that was most easily acknowledged by others was undoubtedly still one's own power that had been gained through the culmination of one's efforts. Because this kind of power would not be changed by one's status or position.\"Hey, don't lose it again alright.\" Zhou Yuan tossed the jade piece at Su Youwei who had walked over. A breeze blew past, causing her uniform to hug her body, accentuating the fine and exquisite curves of a young lady that could cause one to have rather wild thoughts.Su Youwei was a little embarra.s.sed as she bit her red lips. Her clear eyes stared at Zhou Yuan as she said, \"Are you okay?\"Girls were after all very attentive. She could see how Zhou Yuan's hand seemed to tremble slightly.\"Heh heh, you've discovered it huh.\" Zhou Yuan chuckled. He lifted his hand, and one could see that it was very red. This had been brought about by the ferocious punch from before.\"Without any channels opened, the innate quality of the body is after all a little lower.\" Zhou Yuan sighed. Although he had borrowed the powers of the Metal Skin Rune, Light Body Rune and Rampaging Bull Rune to temporarily boost his strength, speed and toughness of his skin, the interior of his body was still too weak. A tiny bit of the backlash had invaded his body, causing him to feel rather terrible.\"Instructor has said that there are some Genesis Runes that can temporarily strengthen one's entire body. If you manage to learn them, you will not be hurt by the backlash of power.\" Su Youwei said after mulling for a while.Zhou Yuan nodded. \"The grade of such Genesis Runes is not low.\"It was said that Genesis Runes were divided into nine grades. However, the ones Zhou Yuan had used were only of the elementary level and could not even be considered grade one. Hence, he was not able to learn such Genesis Runes for the time being.Su Youwei bit her red lips and said in a worried manner, \"Then you'll have to work hard. In the newcomer exam next month, unless you are able to draw a grade one Genesis Rune, it is unlikely that you will be able to achieve the top ten rankings.\"If Zhou Yuan did badly in the newcomer exam, bad rumors would surely spread.Zhou Yuan ma.s.saged his hand as he replied, \"Don't worry, I know what I have to do.\"His eyes slightly narrowed. At this time, he could only hope that the trip to the ancestral grounds two days later would be able to help him solve the major issue of his eight meridian channels not appearing. If not, the only thing left would be to invest all of his energy into Genesis Rune study.It was just that he really could not resign himself to solely studying Genesis Runes.When Su Youwei saw Zhou Yuan fall silent, she knowingly changed the topic. Her eyes seemed to twist in thought as she beamed. \"Your highness, shall I help you apply some ointment?\"\"Forget it, if I accept such a great gesture from a pretty girl, I'm afraid that someone would see and surely employ some underhanded tactics against me.\" Zhou Yuan playfully smiled in response. After all, Su Youwei was rather popular in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute.Su Youwei unhappily rolled her eyes at him. \"Since you are so timid, I'll not bother with you any further. I still have to go to the library to tidy up the books.\"This was a part-time job she had found for herself to earn a little income. After all, her family situation was not good and she still had a grandfather to care for. Thus, she usually found some work to do in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute during the school term.Upon hearing this, Zhou Yuan hesitated a little before saying, \"There is only a month left till the newcomer exam, and time is of the essence. I feel that you should spend more time on opening your meridian channels. If needed, I\u2026\"\"Your highness.\"Zhou Yuan was interrupted before he could finish. He looked towards Su Youwei. The girl's red lips were currently slightly pursed as she earnestly stared at him. Her voice was soft and gently, but it contained a strength that could not be ignored. \"You've already helped me a lot. You brought me to this place where I can change my destiny, and I am grateful to you from the bottom of my heart. However\u2026 you've said before that we are friends, right?\"Zhou Yuan was taken aback as he gazed at the girl before his eyes. The depths of her glistening eyes seemed to hide something that would be difficult to sense for an outsider. It was that final shred of dignity at the bottom of her heart that needed to be preserved.She knew that as long as she opened her mouth, Zhou Yuan would settle everything that she needed. However, if that happened, a certain change would occur in her relations.h.i.+p with him.She had very carefully maintained the relations.h.i.+p between them since the beginning. Zhou Yuan was the prince of the Great Zhou Empire, a status that was high as could be, while she on the other hand, was a commoner. The gap between the two was too great, hence it very easily drew the criticism of others.She was not afraid of such criticism, but she did not want to be looked down upon by Zhou Yuan.Therefore, she put in her greatest efforts after she entered the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute such that she would be able to become independent. She likewise worked hard in her cultivation to change the large difference of status between them.She had been very successful. As the fastest channel opening genius ever since the founding of the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute, everyone began to value her talent. So much so that even Zhou Yuan's father, Zhou Qing, started to hear of her name.\"Alright then.\"In the fact of the girl's stubborn gaze, Zhou Yuan was defeated in the end and could only hold up his hands in surrender as he bitterly smiled, \"I will not interfere.\"Su Youwei's eyes bent into a crescent moon when she heard this. Meanwhile, she secretly breathed a sigh of relief in her heart. She knew that if Zhou Yuan were to insist, she would not be able to reject. It was just, that would be a little disappointing.At the very least, she knew that Zhou Yuan had respected her last bit of dignity till now. His choice to concede made a glimmer flash in her eyes as her heart filled with a peculiar kind of gratefulness.\"Don't worry your highness, I will not slack off in my training. I promise you that I will definitely obtain one of the top ranks in the newcomer exam and enter the A cla.s.s.\" Su Youwei smiled sweetly. Her bright and beautiful smile was filled with confidence.There was a dozen cla.s.ses in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute and the A cla.s.s was naturally the strongest.Zhou Yuan nodded. He pondered for a moment before suddenly taking out the Genesis Gathering Jade he had used as a wager in the fight against Xu Lin previously. Subsequently, he lifted Su Youwei's fair hand and placed it on her palm.\"Don't take this wrongly, I am not giving but lending this to you. I have yet to open any meridian channels and can't make use of it for now.\" Zhou Yuan immediately said when he saw that Su Youwei was about to reject it.When Su Youwei heard Zhou Yuan's words, she swallowed the words that were about to exit her mouth before giving him a glare. This fellow, how could he say it in such a manner!\"I'm leaving!\" Su Youwei kept the Genesis Gathering Jade and with a soft snort, she brushed past Zhou Yuan.\"So defiant yet lovable\u2026\"Zhou Yuan watched the graceful and slim figure of the girl as she departed and shook his head. Just as he was also about to leave, he suddenly sensed something. He raised his head and looked towards a building in the distance, only to find a figure in white was currently looking back at him with a gaze that was as sharp as a blade.\"Qi Yue.\" As Zhou Yuan gazed at the figure in white, his eyebrows raised slightly.The figure in white was the heir of Qi Manor, Qi Yue.A slight smile surfaced on Qi Yue's face when he felt Zhou Yuan's gaze as the former cupped his fists together towards the latter.Zhou Yuan coldly chuckled in his heart, but maintained a smile as he nodded his head, before turning to leave.Atop the building, Qi Yue watched Zhou Yuan's leaving figure. A playful look emerged on Qi Yue's face as he mumbled to himself, \"I never imagined that his highness would unknowingly attain some proficiency in the Dao of Genesis Runes\u2026\"A pretty figure walked out behind Qi Yue. It was a tall and slender girl whose looks were also very beautiful. The only flaw was her slightly thin lips which made her look a little unkind. Compared to Su Youwei, the former did lack some charm.She disdainfully glanced in the direction Zhou Yuan had left in as she coldly snorted. \"Genesis Runes are after all a side path. No matter how great one's attainments, one would still be unable to transform oneself and there will remain a limit to one's lifespan. Carelessness might even result in being killed by an ordinary person.\"She was known as Liu Xi and her father was a marquis of Great Zhou. People called him Marquis Liu, and he was naturally one of the big shots. On this topic, there could be said to be some relation of sorts between Liu Xi and Zhou Yuan.Several years ago, Zhou Qing became aware of how powerful Qi Manor was growing. To keep them in check, he planned to place a 'weight' on Marquis Liu. Thus, Zhou Qing proposed a marriage between their factions; he intended for Zhou Yuan and Marquis Liu's daughter, Liu Xi, to be married and strengthen the ties between the two clans.Marquis Liu was somewhat hesitant with regards to Zhou Qing's proposal. After all, the royal family of Great Zhou was in decline and the sole successor, Zhou Yuan, was unable to open his meridian channels. In addition, Marquis Liu was extremely doting on Liu Xi, and thus asked her about her thoughts. Liu Xi was an extremely proud girl and felt that Zhou Yuan was merely a crippled prince. Hence, she rejected the proposal without any hesitation, and even spread word that his highness was a toad that wanted to dine on a swan's meat. It even became a popular joke back then.Upon seeing her response, Marquis Liu use it as reason to reject Zhou Qing.Although this matter had occurred long ago, Liu Xi naturally felt a little uncomfortable in her heart when she now saw Zhou Yuan, the same Zhou Yuan whom she had once called a toad.Qi Yue laughed and nodded upon hearing her words. \"The highly ranked students partaking in this newcomer exam have already cast their lot in with me. If our prince Zhou Yuan believes that he will be able to make it through with just this teensy bit of proficiency in Genesis Runes, I can only make him lose all face.\"At this point, he paused as his eyes narrowed. \"However, that Su Youwei's talent is indeed astonis.h.i.+ng, and her future prospects are very bright. If there is a chance, we need to do all we can to pull her over to our side.\"A look of unhappiness flitted across Liu Xi's face when she heard these words. She frowned and replied, \"She is merely a lowly la.s.s who has opened three meridian channels. If we cannot win her over, we should find an opportunity to cripple her.\"Liu Xi's was of a n.o.ble family and was also very talented. In the past, she was undoubtedly the most dazzling pearl in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute. However, ever since Su Youwei's appearance, the former's radiance had been suppressed. This undoubtedly caused Liu Xi to find this commoner girl Su Youwei extremely distasteful.Qi Yue was naturally able to hear Liu Xi's dislike for Su Youwei. He chuckled and did not speak about it. Instead, he merely stared at Zhou Yuan's disappearing figure.\"Looks like this Zhou Yuan no longer has any confidence in himself. That is why he intends to support a genius to rely on in future\u2026\"\"Zhou Yuan ah Zhou Yuan. The sacred dragon of the Zhou clan has truly become a crippled dragon.\"\"Since that is so, your Zhou clan is going to be done for.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6 The Ancestral Grounds ShrinePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs the sun began its ascent, warm morning sunlight s.h.i.+ned down on the City of Great Zhou, brightening the place.Great Zhou Royal Palace.Zhou Yuan had been unable to sleep for the entire night. By the time he rushed to the palace gates, the imperial guards were already respectfully standing there. The thousand strong imperial guards wore heavy armour and wielded spears which flickered with cold light. It was a powerful military force.Zhou Qing sat on a fine fiery-red horse. He smiled as he watched Zhou Yuan hurry over and asked, \"Are you ready?\"Today was Great Zhou's ancestor offering ceremony.Zhou Yuan forcefully nodded his head while hope surged in his eyes. He knew that whether or not the eight meridian channels in his body would surface again, allowing him to begin channel opening cultivation, would hinge upon this very day.A guard led another fiery-red steed over. Flames burned at the tip of the horse's tail, but its head was that of a ferocious-looking lion.This creature was known as the Fire Lion-Horse, and was a grade 1 Genesis Beast. It was able to gallop a thousand miles without rest.The originally irritable Fire Lion-Horse had long since been tamed. Thus, when Zhou Yuan mounted it, it merely swung its flaming tail for a moment before calming down again.Zhou Yuan pulled the horse reins. The youth's pitch-black pupils seemed to burn as he opened his mouth and said, \"Let's go father.\"Zhou Qing chuckled and nodded his head, before waving his hand.Woooo!A horn sounded and the thousand-men force swiftly turned into a torrent that engulfed Zhou Qing and Zhou Wei, protecting them within it. Next, they surged out of the royal palace with rumbling sounds of movement, travelling along the city streets as they hurried towards the city exit....The Great Zhou royal clan ancestral land was also where the Great Zhou royal tomb was located. Although the royal tomb was about a hundred miles from Great Zhou city, given their pace, they would reach their destination in four hours.Under a lofty green mountain, Zhou Qing and Zhou Yuan got off their horses while the imperial guards spread out and positioned themselves at the various entry points. Even a bird would be killed if it neared.\"This is where the tomb of our Great Zhou royal clan is located.\"Zhou Qing pointed at the majestic green mountain before their eyes. After being silent for some time, he slowly said, \"Back then, this was where our Zhou clan began and after much hard work, we eventually created the Great Zhou Empire. I just never imagined that our forefathers' efforts would be beaten back to its original shape at my hands.\"Zhou Yuan looked at Zhou Qing's somewhat dejected face and softly said, \"Father should not blame himself, the Wu clan were scheming and heartless and no one could have predicted that they would plot for a hundred years. The fault does not lie with father.\"Zhou Qing bitterly laughed. He did not speak any further on the topic and merely walked towards the stone steps. \"Follow me.\"Zhou Yuan nodded and quickly caught up.The stone steps led to the peak. There were nine thousand and ninety nine steps which reached straight into the clouds.The two wore solemn expressions as they slowly ascended. An incense stick of time later, they finally reached the peak where a black shrine stood. The shrine was ancient and seemed to have bathed in the rays of countless moons.These three mountain ranges snaked along the ground like hidden dragons. They surrounded and protected the green mountain below Zhou Yuan's feet like three dragons coiling around a pearl. A majestic aura seemed to rise spontaneously when one watched them.\"What a powerful presence.\" Zhou Yuan praised. Looks like their Zhou clan ancestral grounds had excellent fengshui*. No wonder they had been able to establish an empire.Zhou Qing smiled and said, \"Luck exists in this world, and this land contains a part of it. The fact that our Zhou clan was able to rise to power is mostly thanks to the fengshui* of our ancestral land.\"Zhou Yuan pursed his lips and replied, \"The land's fengshui* did play a part, but the greater part was still due to our forefathers' efforts. As the saying goes, the universe never stops so the n.o.bleman must ceaselessly strive. As long as one works hard to improve, there will be a chance to change one's fortunes no matter how bad the hand one is dealt.\"\"Likewise, regardless of how great one's hand, the one that reaps what others have sown will always be in danger of being defeated.\"Although the youth's voice sounded somewhat immature, the determination that faintly seeped out was taken note of by Zhou Qing as the smile on his face grew even wider.\"Looks like the bitter experiences over the years were not completely bad.\"Zhou Qing tousled Zhou Yuan's hair before walking into the shrine. As Zhou Yuan followed, he saw the many memorial tablets within the large shrine amidst the lingering incense smoke, tablets which belonged to the forefathers of the Great Zhou royal clan. Under Zhou Qing's lead, Zhou Yuan offered joss sticks and bowed at every tablet.In the end, Zhou Qing's steps paused before a memorial tablet at the deepest part of the shrine. This was the first emperor of their clan that had founded Great Zhou. After Zhou Qing paid his respects, he reached out and lightly turned the tablet.Rumble.A rumbling noise was immediately heard when the tablet was turned. Zhou Yuan watched in astonishment as as a thick and heavy set of secret stone doors slowly cracked open on the wall behind the memorial tablet.The interior of the stone doors were filled with a deep darkness, and appeared rather mysterious.Zhou Qing's expression was somewhat complicated as he gazed at the stone doors and said, \"Whether or not you will be able to open your meridian channels and start cultivating will depend on this place.\"Upon hearing this, Zhou Yuan's expression grew nervous as his fists tightly clenched. No matter how mature he was, he was after all still a child and was hence unable to maintain his calm before important matters related to opening his meridian channels.Zhou Qing glanced at Zhou Yuan before walking past the stone doors. Behind them was a long stone corridor. Lamps burned on the floor of the corridor, giving the place a dusky lighting.The two did not speak. Only the faint sound of footsteps filled the corridor.After walking for about a dozen minutes, Zhou Qing's and Zhou Yuan's footsteps finally stopped. They had reached the end of the corridor, and a vast ancient cavern had appeared before their eyes.At the end of the cavern stood a stone platform.Zhou Qing headed straight for the stone platform. Only at this moment did Zhou Yuan discover that the numerous ancient Genesis Runes were carved onto the surface of the stone platform. These Genesis Runes formed a certain picture.With Zhou Yuan's current understanding of Genesis Runes, he was completely unable to recognize what grade these Genesis Runes were. Just vaguely trying to picture them in his mind made his spirit greatly exhausted, leaving him feeling a little light-headed. Hence, he immediately withdrew his gaze.\"Father\u2026\" Zhou Yuan looked towards Zhou Qing. Could the solution to the gordian knot of his missing eight meridian channels be found here?Zhou Qing's expression grew more solemn as he gazed at the ancient Genesis Runes on the stone platform and said, \"A certain secret saying has been pa.s.sed down in our Zhou clan. It says that a great destiny is hidden in this secret room that can help our Zhou clan truly flourish for ten thousand years.\"\"The key to this great destiny is the blood of our Zhou clan's successor. However, although every successive emperor has come here in an attempt to unlock the great destiny with his blood, every single one of them ultimately failed.\"At this point, he looked towards Zhou Yuan before continuing. \"That is why I have brought you here to see if you are able to unlock this great destiny. If you are successful, solving the problem of your eight meridian channels should not be hard.\"\"Eh?\"Zhou Yuan gazed at the ancient stone platform in amazement. He had evidently never expected that such a secret saying had been pa.s.sed down in their Zhou clan.\"Go on.\" Zhou Qing said as he patted Zhou Yuan's shoulders.Zhou Yuan took in a deep breath. His heart was thumping like a drum, but he still mustered his courage and walked onto the stone platform before seating himself amongst the many ancient and mysterious Genesis Runes.He took out a small sharp knife and gritted his teeth as he moved it across his wrist. Fresh blood immediately flowed out and spread along the groves of the Genesis Runes.In the short span of several breaths, the Genesis Runes on the stone platform had taken on the color of fresh red blood.Outside the stone platform, Zhou Qing watched this scene with eyes filled with anxiety as his fists subconsciously clenched tightly.As Zhou Yuan felt the flowing fresh blood, his young and somewhat scholarly face instantly turned even paler. His unwavering gaze was fixed on the complicated Genesis Runes while his heart thunderously beated.\"Is this my last chance\u2026\"Zhou Yuan tightly gritted his teeth and endured the waves of dizziness that battered at this mind. At this very moment, the scene of his mother, Qin Yu, vomiting blood once again surfaced before his eyes, causing waves of piercing pain to spread in his heart.\"For my sake, mother's health was greatly affected and her lifespan was cut!\"\"For me, father lost an arm to king Wu!\"\"My destiny was stolen, my sacred dragon root damaged and poison gnaws at my life!\"\"Great Zhou is a mess inside while danger lurks outside. We risk being overthrown at any time!\"\"Therefore, I want to change all of this. I want to help mother recover her lost lifespan and father regain his aspirations. I want to ensure that my people no longer have to worry or be afraid. I want to take back everything that I have lost!\"\"... this great destiny is mine!\"Howls abruptly rang out in Zhou Yuan's heart. In that split second, Zhou Yuan's body seemed to shake violently, as if a furious and unresigned dragon roar was echoing from the deepest recesses of his body.Buzz buzz!It was at this very moment that blinding light exploded from the bloodied ancient Genesis Runes. The light converged like silver water and rapidly swallowed Zhou Yuan.This sudden turn of events caused Zhou Qing to be stunned. He hastily looked towards Zhou Yuan and watched in shock as Zhou Yuan vanished into thin air...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7 A Mysterious PlacePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBlinding light flooded the eyes, followed by a barbaric pulling force. Zhou Yuan was. .h.i.t by vertigo as if he had fallen into a whirlpool.Fortunately, the pulling sensation did not last for long. Zhou Yuan felt a huge force rush towards him and his body was flung into the air.Bang!Zhou Yuan's body landed heavily on the ground, causing him to eat a mouthful of soil in the process. However, he was rather quick-witted. Ignoring the pain when he landed, Zhou Yuan swiftly rolled on the ground, distancing himself from where he had originally landed.At the same time, the Metal Skin Rune, that had been prepared in advance on his arms, started to flicker with a faint glow, ready to activate at any moment.Fortunately, the ambush he had expected did not come, and Zhou Yuan's tense body gradually relaxed. Only then did he leisurely inspect the surroundings.\"This is?\"Zhou Yuan was wide-eyed as he looked around him. The cavern had long since disappeared, and in its place was a quiet and peaceful ancient forest. Giant trees thrust into the sky, while their dense leaves covered the heavens.A clear stream flowed by the side, emitting the sounds of running water. It was a tranquil sight.\"What is this place?\" Zhou Yuan was completely baffled. He remembered being in the secret cavern inside the shrine just moments ago. How had he come to this unfamiliar place in the blink of an eye?\"Strange.\" Zhou Yuan frowned slightly as he observed his surroundings. Could it be that the so-called great destiny was this land?\"But there are no signs of any people.\" Zhou Yuan mumbled to himself. As his gaze swept back and forth, his pupils abruptly shrunk while the expression on his face froze as if he had seen a ghost.It was because he had just discovered that a beautiful figure had unknowingly appeared under one of the giant trees to his front.At closer inspection, it was a girl in green. The girl's body was slender and she was currently leaning with her back against the tree trunk as a pair of bright eyes calmly observed him.When Zhou Yuan's gaze met her own, an indescribable feeling of numbness spread across his scalp.However, Zhou Yuan's mental resilience was after all pretty good, and he very quickly calmed himself. A smile immediately emerged on his immature face, trying his best to appear harmless, as he cupped his fists together and said, \"Big sis, may I know where this is? I am Zhou Yuan and I did not mean to trespa.s.s. Please forgive me if I have offended you in an manner.\"The girl before his eyes looked to be of similar age to himself. However, a little politeness at such a time was never a bad thing.However, the mysterious girl in green did not seem to take any notice of Zhou Yuan's respectful mannerisms. Her slim and fair hand pulled back a strand of black hair in front of her forehead, before she walked towards Zhou Yuan.When she walked out of the shade, light immediately sprinkled down on her body. As she approached, Zhou Yuan was finally able to clearly see her, and a look of amazement involuntarily flitted across his eyes.The girl had snow-white skin. Her fine black hair was lightly bundled up, while her simple green clothes outlined her wonderful curves. She had a very exquisite set of facial features. In particular, her bright eyes seemed to contain a certain aura of mysteriousness, causing them to appear both unpredictable and distant.At this very moment, the girl seemed to tread on shards of sunlight against the backdrop of towering ancient trees. A gentle breeze blew past and lifted her fringe, allowing one to catch a glimpse of an extremely ancient rune between her brows, a sight that gave off an aura of indescribable mysteriousness. This scene was so beautiful that it made Zhou Yuan breathless for a moment.\"Big sis.\" Zhou Yuan displayed a smile. Although this scene was breathtaking, he still maintained a little cautiousness. After all, both this foreign environment and the mysterious girl before him were unknowns.\"Big sis?\" The girl in green curled her lips slightly when she heard how Zhou Yuan addressed her as if it was somewhat amusing.She inquisitively sized-up Zhou Yuan for a moment before muttering, \"Grandpa Hei was right, someone really came here today.\"\"What?\" Zhou Yuan was unable to clearly catch what she had said.However, the girl in green ignored him. She turned around and headed towards the ancient forest. As she pa.s.sed by the giant tree from before, the girl called out.\"Tuntun, time to go home.\"Upon hearing the girl in green's call, Zhou Yuan immediately discovered the small gray creature lying under the giant tree. The little creature looked like an unremarkable small dog.\"A pet doggy?\" Zhou Yuan mumbled.Ao ao!As if it had heard Zhou Yuan's mumbling, the small creature's hair immediately bristled and it started to bark at him. However, because its body was too small, the barks from it lacked any destructive power and instead made it appear rather cute.The small creature seemed to have realised that its barking had not intimidated Zhou Yuan. Its tail stood straight up as it jumped in front of a boulder, before opening its mouth and taking a vicious bite.Crunch crunch!As it continued to chomp down in this manner, one could only watch as the boulder rapidly shrank at an alarming speed. In the short span of several breaths, the boulder had completely disappeared. All of the hard pieces of rock had been swallowed into the little creature's tiny stomach.The expression on Zhou Yuan's face turned rigid as he secretly gasped. He was a little dumbstruck as he stared at the little dog-like creature. What exactly was this thing? To think that such a huge boulder would be devoured in a few bites.What strong teeth and healthy appet.i.te!Zhou Yuan wiped away the cold sweat on his head and no longer dared to look at this seemingly plain little beast. The latter's teeth had been able to easily chew threw rock, what hope could his frail body have against it?No wonder it was called Tuntun*. (Means swallow or devour)Upon seeing the shock on Zhou Yuan's face, the little creature called Tuntun happily swung its tail. It rolled its eyes at him in an extremely human-like manner, before catching up to the girl in green while still shaking its tail.When the girl in green walked into the forest, she tilted her head back a little, slightly raising her snow-white chin at Zhou Yuan.\"Come along if you want to find your great destiny.\"After speaking, she walked into the forest, her pretty figure flas.h.i.+ng between the gaps in the trees.A contemplative look emerged on Zhou Yuan's face as he watched the girl in green and small creature grow smaller and smaller. All of this was very mysterious, and he could not make heads or tails of it. He was clearly unable to understand why he had come to this foreign place from the stone platform in the secret cavern of their ancestral shrine.However, since he was already here, there was obviously no way to back out. After all, he did not plan on returning empty handed.Huu.Zhou Yuan took in a deep breath. Without any further hesitation, he opened his stride and quickly caught up to the girl and little beast.A boy, girl and beast travelled within the ancient forest, a lush green forest that was full of life. From time to time, ferocious beast howls could be heard in the distance. But every time that happened, the little Tuntun at the girl in green's side would emit a bark. Although the bark was not loud, the entire forest seemed to fall silent, as if they were afraid of this small creature.Zhou Yuan could not help but took another look at the mysterious little beast. The little gray-dog-like creature seemed to be very special.It was clear that the girl in green had not intentions of speaking with Zhou Yuan. Hence, Zhou Yuan could only maintain his silence as he closely followed behind.They advanced in this manner for an hour, before Zhou Yuan finally sensed the girl in green's footsteps come to a stop.\"We're here.\"The girl's voice echoed from the front. Zhou Yuan's heart jumped slightly as he raised his head and peered at through the greenery of the forest. A clearing had appeared within the forest where a cottage peacefully stood.There were three fences around the cottage. Zhou Yuan's gaze ultimately paused on a recliner in front of the cottage where an old man in black was peacefully resting as he gently rocked back and forth.As if he had sensed Zhou Yuan's gaze, the old man opened his eyes and looked at the former.Zhou Yuan's heart faintly trembled when he saw the old man's eyes. Those eyes were filled with an indescribable ancientness, as if they had experienced countless eons.At the same time, Zhou Yuan was able to feel a thick declining and decaying aura cloaking the old man.However, the moment their gazes met, Zhou Yuan also felt the sensation of being seen through. It was as if all of his secrets had been put on display before the old man's eyes.\"Hehe, a little fellow who possess the sacred dragon blessing has indeed come.\" The old man in black slowly withdrew his gaze as a raspy voice was heard. However, the voice was akin to thunder when they fell upon Zhou Yuan's ears.\"However it's a pity that the sacred dragon blessing has been stolen, and even the sacred dragon root has been damaged. Oh, is this the Dragon's Resentment Poison?\"\"Tragic, truly tragic.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 Searching for the Eight Meridian ChannelsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe old man's voice was undoubtedly akin to a sudden clap of thunder when it landed in Zhou Yuan's ears, causing the seas of his heart to churn. All it had taken was a single look for this old man to discover everything that had happened to him.The girl in green walked to the old man's back and glanced at the shocked Zhou Yuan. Tuntun started to jump with the intent of throwing itself into her arms, but was instead ignored as she picked it up and offhandedly threw it into a water jar.Tuntun appeared a little upset, but since it knew of the girl's obsession with cleanliness, it could only obediently start to wash itself. It was an exceptionally comical scene.However, Zhou Yuan was completely indifferent to this amusing scene. All he could do was stare in shock at the mysterious old man in black. A long while later, his shock finally started to recede as a glimmer of hope began to s.h.i.+ne in its place.Since this old man was able to discover the problems of his body in a single glance, the former was definitely no ordinary individual. Perhaps, the predicament of his eight meridians would really be solved in this place.Zhou Yuan took in a deep breath, suppressing the intense emotions that were surging in his heart, before he cupped his hands together and spoke in a respectful manner, \"This junior one is known as Zhou Yuan. Greetings elder.\"The old man nodded and replied, \"It is indeed someone from the Zhou clan.\"The old man eyed Zhou Yuan, who seemed to desire to speak. It was as if the old man knew what Zhou Yuan was thinking in his heart as the former smiled in a strange manner and said, \"I know what you're thinking. You're not wrong, I can indeed help you solve your eight meridians problem. However, why should I help you?\"Zhou Yuan was taken aback. After some silence, he seemed to consider what to say before he gave his answer, \"Junior neither knows where this place is nor who elder is. However, since my Zhou clan forefathers left behind a secret cavern that led to this place, elder should have some relation to my Zhou clan forefathers.\"The old man in black did not comment when he heard this.By this time, Zhou Yuan had already completely regained his calm. He stared at the old man and slowly continued, \"Given junior's current state, I have nothing that could possibly move elder. However, I can tell that elder has likely been\u2026 waiting for me, right?\"In the split second that the elder had looked at him earlier, Zhou Yuan was able to ascertain with his sharp senses that a strange light had flashed in the depths of the old man's eyes.The slowly rocking recliner finally slowed to a stop at this moment as the old man's eyes faintly narrowed. It was impossible to tell if he was furious or pleased as he stared at Zhou Yuan and said, \"Little child, your words are rather bold. Do you really believe that you have anything that is worth my waiting?\"In response to the old man's words, Zhou Yuan merely smiled as he shook his head. \"I do not know the answer to this question, but elder might perhaps be aware?\"The old man in black stared at Zhou Yuan with eyes that were filled with ancientness. Although the former did not give off a terrifying aura, a pressuring feeling had emerged, causing the entire ancient forest to become deathly silent.Outside the cottage, the tactful youth wore a slight smile as he looked straight at the old man without any fear like a newborn calf.He believed that the secret saying in his Zhou clan was not a shot in the dark. There surely must be a reason as to why he was able to come here. In addition, he believed in his intuition.The oppressive feeling akin to billowing thunderclouds lasted for a rather long time until a helpless smile surfaced on the old man's expressionless face. He lay on in the recliner and sighed, \"Looks like I have really grown old. Can't even scare a little baby.\"Behind the old man in black, the girl in green's bright eyes swept across Zhou Yuan as her clear voice sounded in an indifferent manner, \"He's acting. In fact, he's very afraid.\"\"Eh\u2026\"Zhou Yuan's face turned a little rigid. Soon after, he revealed an awkward smile. His back was indeed already wet with cold sweat. After all, no matter how calm he was, he could not possibly fully keep his composure in the face of his only hope.\"Elder\u2026\" Zhou Yuan anxiously looked towards the old man.\"Aih.\" The old man withdrew his aura, looked towards Zhou Yuan and said, \"I can solve the problem of your eight meridians, however, I have one condition.\"\"Condition?\" Zhou Yuan was stunned, but he very quickly nodded his head in an earnest manner. \"Please tell me.\"The old man softly sighed, tilted his head and looked at the elegantly standing girl beside him as he slowly said, \"I want you to leave this place with Yaoyao, and protect her.\"\"Yaoyao?\" Zhou Yuan was stunned once again as he too looked towards the girl in green. This was evidently her name and was a good match for her pretty and tender look.\"Grandpa Hei.\" The girl in green bit her red lips as a look of unwillingness and resistance was revealed on her aloof and pretty face.The old man lightly patted the girl's hand as he gently said, \"Yaoyao, grandpa Hei has something to do and will have to leave for some time, I cannot continue staying by your side.\"The crystal clear eyes of the girl called Yaoyao dimmed. She looked at Zhou Yuan and softly said, \"Grandpa Hei, he is too weak.\"An awkward expression filled Zhou Yuan's face. It was indeed true that he was practically powerless as someone who had yet to open even a single meridian channel.The old man could not help but chuckle upon hearing this. His gaze swept over Zhou Yuan as he said, \"Although this kid is weak now, it is hard to say what he will become in future.\"\"Grandpa Hei, will I still be able to see you in future?\" Yaoyao asked in a low voice. As an intelligent girl, how could she not sense that the old man's actions was similar to entrusting her to someone else. It was evident that he was going to do something extremely dangerous, so dangerous that he might even pay with his life.The old man in black did not reply, but instead gently patted Yaoyao's little hands.He then turned his head, looking towards Zhou Yuan as he smiled and said, \"So how about it?\"A serious expression covered Zhou Yuan's face. He respectfully bowed to the old man as he slowly said, \"Although I do not have any power now, I can promise elder that if anyone wants to hurt big sis Yaoyao, he will have to first walk over my corpse.\"Although the youth's voice sounded rather immature, it had an unquestionable tone that made one raise one's brows.Upon hearing this, a satisfied smile was revealed on the old man's face.\"Since that is so\u2026\" The old man chuckled as he stared at Zhou Yuan and said, \"I'll now solve the problem of your eight meridian channels\u2026\"Zhou Yuan immediately felt a surge of excitement as he eagerly gazed at the old man in black.A strange smile emerged from the corners of the old man's lips when he saw Zhou Yuan's expectant gaze, before the former suddenly waved his sleeve.Boom!The earth shook and an enormous crack opened below Zhou Yuan's feet, forming a deep abyss. With a single gulp, it swallowed the pale and horrified Zhou Yuan.Aaahh!Zhou Yuan's body frantically fell as a shriek emerged from his mouth. While this happened, a sticky and viscous black liquid appeared from the darkness and wrapped around his hands and feet.As the black liquid creeped up inch by inch, an intense pain washed over Zhou Yuan as if the skin of his body was being melted away.The most alarming thing was that the black liquid was invading his body through his pores and destroying the inside of his body. Wherever the black liquid pa.s.sed, everything; his blood, his flesh, his channels, were being completely eroded away.Along with the intense pain, fear invaded Zhou Yuan's heart and he started to smell the scent of death.He knew that he would really die if he allowed the black liquid to continue its destruction.Zhou Yuan frantically struggled, activating the three Genesis Runes he had inscribed on his body without any hesitation. However, the moment the three Genesis Runes started to glow, the black liquid surged over and extinguished their light. In the end, even the three runes were wiped away by the black liquid...Zhou Yuan's heart turned completely ice-cold when the three runes were utterly destroyed.The black liquid continued to spread and eventually covered Zhou Yuan's eyes. Intense pain exploded and seemed to erode even his eyes as the entire world faded into darkness.In the darkness, Zhou Yuan could feel the intense pain that originated from inside his body as the black liquid descended layer by layer.The smell of death grew increasingly strong.This was no illusion. If he was unable to stop the black liquid, he would really die!\"I cannot die in this place!\"\"I still need to help mother recover her lifespan! I still need to avenge father for the loss of his arm! And there is still the sacred dragon blessing that was stolen from me!\"\"How can I possibly die here without completing all of that?!\"\"I cannot die!\"In the darkness, an angry and unresigned roar echoed in Zhou Yuan's heart, a roar that contained the deep desire to live.Just as death approached, Zhou Yuan mind suddenly sank into his body. In that moment, he was barely able to discern eight faint meandering paths of light in the deepest depths of his body.These eight paths of light were akin to eight hidden dragons.\"Are these\u2026 the eight meridian channels of cultivation?!\"Zhou Yuan's heart violently shuddered as he stared at the eight paths of light while comprehension started to bubble forth within him. These eight paths were the eight meridian channels that had never revealed themselves since the beginning!Roar!It was when death truly approached that they seemed to sense danger and immediately started to slowly squirm while emitting low dragon roars.Buzz!Dazzling light abruptly exploded from the deepest recesses of Zhou Yuan's body. As the light unfurled, the black liquid began to dissipate at a speed which could be detected by the naked eye.In a short span of several breaths, the darkness had completely withdrawn.Zhou Yuan's tightly shut eyes also opened at this moment as bright light once again flooded them. He fell down on his bottom, sweat flowing down his young face as if he had been fished out from a body of water.*Pant* *Pant*Zhou Yuan gasped for breath as his gaze darted all around him. He was currently still in front the cottage, as if everything from before had been an illusion.\"Was what happened earlier a hallucination?\" Zhou Yuan was taken aback.\"What do you think?\" An elderly voice was transmitted from his front. The old man in black was currently faintly smiling as he looked at Zhou Yuan.Zhou Yuan's expression fluctuated indeterminately. He had clearly felt how real death had been just moments ago. He slowly lifted his hand as his pupils abruptly shrank.He had seen something black stealthily fade away at his fingertips.It was exactly the same as the black liquid from before.\"It was real?!\" Zhou Yuan's heart shuddered. He was now certain that everything that had happened previously was real. This old man's methods were just too unimaginable.The old man chuckled and said, \"Feel the interior of your body.\"Upon hearing this, Zhou Yuan closed his eyes and concentrated. It was at this same moment that his heart suddenly thudded like thunder and a look of disbelief emerged on his young and pale face.It was because he could now clearly sense eight meridian channels in his body. They were akin to hidden dragons that had flown out from the abyss.These eight meridian channels were the very same meridian channels that marked the beginning of one's cultivation!Zhou Yuan abruptly opened his eyes that were now filled with surging emotions. He stared at the old man in black as he spoke in a trembling voice.\"My\u2026 my eight meridians have appeared?!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9 Emergence of the Eight Meridian ChannelsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn front of the cottage, the youth's rather thin-looking face was currently filled with disbelief while overwhelmed with emotions as his trembling hands touched his body. This feeling of rebirth made even the mature Zhou Yuan involuntarily grin like a fool.After all, this was far too important to him.As he grew older, the other kids had all started to their channel opening cultivation, revealing their varying apt.i.tudes. Although Zhou Yuan had hid it very well, the depths of his heart was still filled with envy.He likewise desired to open his channels, step into the great Dao of Genesis Qi and wield the power that filled this world.He had deeply yearned for this day for a very long time.The old man in black gazed at the emotionally overwhelmed Zhou Yuan as he chuckled and said, \"You were born with eight naturally open meridian channels. Unfortunately, you encountered a disaster at birth. Sensing the external danger, the eight meridian channels in your body hid in the deepest recesses of your body as a form of self-defence. That was why your eight meridian channels did not show themselves even when you reached the normal age where they were suppose to appear.\"Though your eight meridian channels had hidden themselves, they were still able to sense danger. Thus, the only way to bring them out once again was to place yourself at the doors of death. Only then would the eight meridians be forced to reveal themselves.\"The eyelids of the old man raised as he continued in an indifferent tone, \"Do not believe that the smell of death from before was fake. If you were unable to rouse the eight meridian channels to protect yourself at the final moment, you would have died.\"The still emotional Zhou Yuan felt a chill pa.s.s through his entire body when he heard this. His face paled slightly as he dazedly stared at the old man in black. It was clear that Zhou Yuan was recalling the thick scent of death from before.He even had a premonition that if he had roused his meridian channels just a split second later, he would really have died.It was obvious that the old man had used an extremely dangerous method to rouse the eight meridian channels in his body.The old man in black was all smiles as he asked, \"Why? You blame me for not warning you beforehand?\"Zhou Yuan took in a deep breath, shook his head and slowly replied, \" I am willing to take even the greatest risk as long as I can channel opening training. Hence, it is not important even if I did not know in advance. I just feel some lingering fear when I recall it.\"Only then did the old man nod his head and speak with some admiration, \"Little kid, you may be young, but your mettle is rather decent.\"However, do not be too happy just because your eight meridian channels have reappeared. Although you were originally born with naturally open meridian channels, due to the many years of concealment, your eight meridian channels have once again been blocked and sealed. Therefore, if you want to begin your cultivation, you will have to first completely unblock your eight meridian channels. Only then will you be able to cross over from the Channel Opening stage to the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage.\"Moreover, unblocking your meridian channels will be even more difficult than normal. This is because the eight channels in your body had sealed themselves back then to avoid disaster. The hards.h.i.+ps you will face when unblocking your meridian channels will be even greater than those faced by an ordinary person.\" The old man shook his head as he elaborated.Zhou Yuan frowned slightly upon hearing this, but quickly came to accept it and said, \"At the very least, I now have more hope than before, isn't that so?\"No matter how bad the current situation was, could it possibly be as bad as before when his eight meridian channels were nowhere to be found? So what if it was more difficult to unblock or open his meridian channels? There was now hope, wasn't that right?Behind the old man in black, the girl in green lifted Tuntun out of the water jar and lightly shook it. Specks of red light emerged from the little creature's body, drying away all of the water. Only then did she cradle it on her arms, satisfied.Her fair hand gently stroke the little creature as she calm gazed at Zhou Yuan. It was obvious that the latter's dedication towards channel opening cultivation had surprised her a little.Yaoyao's red lips cracked opened slightly as she said in an unemotional voice, \"Being incapable of channel opening cultivation is nothing to be fret about. I too am unable to use Genesis Qi.\"The girl in green clearly belonged to the group of people who were a little more indifferent by nature. They would not take even a second glance at people or things that they did not care about. Thus, these words of hers were slightly meant as consolation.Zhou Yuan was somewhat astonished as he stared at her. To think that this girl in green was also unable to use Genesis Qi.\"Hehe, due to certain reasons, Yaoyao is indeed unable to utilise Genesis Qi.\" The old man in black chuckled, before he playfully said to Zhou Yuan, \"However, don't belittle her because of this as she has received all of my teachings with regards to Genesis Runes. Although her age is similar to your own, she has more than enough attainments in Genesis Runes to become your teacher.\"\"Eh?\"Zhou Yuan's eyes were filled with bewilderment. It was really unexpected that this girl in green would have such great mastery over Genesis Runes.\"However, you should not undervalue yourself either. Though it is true that you will have great difficulty in unblocking your meridian channels, as the saying goes, with great effort comes great reward. Thus, the benefits you will obtain every time you open a meridian channel will be much greater than normal.\" said the old man with a smile.Zhou Yuan's eyes brightened slightly. He knew that the innate quality of one's body would rise every time a channel was opened. According to the old man in black, he would become much stronger than any ordinary person. As such, although unblocking channels would be harder, he was able to accept it.A thought formed in Zhou Yuan's head. He suddenly looked towards the old man in black and said in a seemingly bitter manner, \"Elder, although I am now able to begin my channel opening cultivation, my starting point is already a step behind everyone else. I'm afraid that it will take quite some time before I am able to reach the stage where I will be able to protect big sis Yaoyao.\"The old man in black seemed to smile as he looked back at Zhou Yuan. \"Kid, what exactly do you want to say?\"Zhou Yuan chuckled and replied, \"Why not elder be a good samaritan till the end and bestow a little destiny onto me?\"The old man before Zhou Yuan was obviously unfathomable. According to Zhou Yuan's estimates, the old man's power had likely already reached an unimaginable level. At the very least, his father Zhou Qing, could not compare at all.Usually speaking, given Zhou Yuan's current status, he would not be able to come into contact with such an expert. Yet, since he had the fortune to meet this old man, Zhou Yuan naturally intended to make full use of this opportunity.This was also a kind of destiny.The old man in black released a chuckle when he heard Zhou Yuan's words and said, \"Such a crafty kid, to think that you would be so greedy.\"Zhou Yuan's keen senses could detect that there was no anger in the old man's words. Hence, he smiled and replied, \"Is junior's request not for the sake of better accomplis.h.i.+ng the task elder has entrusted me with? Else if I really encounter some danger, with my small arms and legs, there will be nothing else I can do but die in front of big sis Yaoyao.\"His seemingly pained appearance together with his immature face did seem somewhat amusing, causing Yaoyao to involuntarily bend over slightly as her eyes seemed to swirl in thought. This fellow was really interesting.Yaoyao gently stroked Tuntun as her red lips parted slightly, \"Grandpa Hei, if you want him to protect me and not become a burden, I think it will be better to accept his request.\"When Zhou Yuan heard this, he immediately gave her a look of grat.i.tude. However, the girl remained expressionless as if she had not seen it.The old man gently stroked his beard as his eyes faintly flickered. He pondered in silence for some time, before softly sighing in the end. \"Yaoyao, you are right. If this kid is too weak, he will instead become an inconvenience to you.\"The old man in black stared at Zhou Yuan with his seemingly bottomless eyes as he slowly said, \"However, my techniques are not to be pa.s.sed on to an outsider.\"Zhou Yuan was a smart lad. Upon hearing these words, he immediately went on his knees and respectfully said, \"Disciple Zhou Yuan greets master!\"\"Heh, brat, you are indeed quick-witted.\" The old man in black clicked his tongue in response to Zhou Yuan's swift and direct actions. The former had only showed a slight opening in his words, and this kid had straightaway acknowledged the old man as his master. As the saying went, when attacked with a stick, the snake would immediately slither up. This kid was truly skillful at catching an opportunity.The old man in black shook his head. Soon after, he sighed deeply and said, \"Our meeting here can also be considered destiny of sorts. Although you have come here for my techniques, I will still accept you as my disciple for the time being.\"Zhou Yuan was overjoyed when he heard this and immediately bowed.The old man's eyes became a little gentler when he saw Zhou Yuan meticulously complete the traditional rites of a disciple and said, \"Since you are so willing, I cannot be stingy.\"\"Now that your eight meridian channels have emerged, I will teach you a Qi drawingmethod.\"During the Channel Opening stage, the body was incapable of storing Genesis Qi and thus unable to learn or use any real cultivation techniques. Hence, one could only learn a Qi drawing method. Only when all eight meridian channels were opened and one reached the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage would one be able to truly master and utilise cultivation techniques.A faint glow appeared at the old man's fingertip and there seemed to be tiny words flowing within it. Subsequently, he suddenly touched Zhou Yuan's forehead.Boom!When the finger touched Zhou Yuan's forehead, he immediately felt his head start to swell. Next, a huge amount of information poured in, causing him to become a little dizzy.However, the dizzy spell pa.s.sed quickly and Zhou Yuan proceeded to savor the information that had appeared in his head.Qi drawing method, Dragon Breathing?This Qi drawing method was called Dragon Breathing, a name that sounded rather mighty. It was unknown how effective it would be for cultivation, but it should be rather extraordinary since it was from the old man in black.The old man withdrew his finger, stared at Zhou Yuan and smiled, \"I have seen the Genesis Runes inscribed on your body earlier, are you interested in this path?\"Zhou Yuan nodded and earnestly replied, \"The path of Genesis Runes is both broad and deep. It cannot be underestimated.\"He had focused on Genesis Runes for the past two years and was faintly able to tell how formidable the essence of Genesis Runes was. The path of Genesis Runes was somewhat similar to the b.u.t.terfly effect. Using a little power to construct mysterious runes would result in an extremely great force.It was a pity that Genesis Runes could not allow the body to undergo a metamorphosis. Moreover, due to its broadness and depth, one would have to invest a great deal of effort in order to attain some accomplishment in this path. Hence, the majority of Genesis Masters viewed it as a side path and did not bother with it too much.The old man in black nodded his head in approval when he heard Zhou Yuan's words. \"The people of the world who view Genesis Runes as a side path are ignorant. They dislike it because it is difficult to master, but what they do not know is that crux of the Dao of Genesis Runes is in the spirit. If mastered, it will complement the Dao of Genesis Masters.\"Zhou Yuan felt a little proud while the old man in black talked about Genesis Runes. Heknew in his heart that the old man likely had extraordinary attainment in this path.\"I can see that your spirit is full of vigour and is indeed rather suited to Genesis Runes. I will also teach you a spirit tempering method.\"The old man in black laughed. In the next instant, a bright light suddenly flew out from his eyes and shot into Zhou Yuan's eyes.A loud sound suddenly boomed in Zhou Yuan's head as if a great bell had been struck as countless ancient characters circulated in his pupils. In the end, they gradually quietened down as information started to flow in his mind.'Primal Chaos Divine Grindstone Visualisation Method'Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 Tutelage of DestinyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe sound of a loud bell continued to echo in Zhou Yuan's head for quite some time before gradually fading away. Amidst this, Zhou Yuan could feel the spirit tempering method, 'Primal Chaos Divine Grindstone Visualisation Method', being branded into his mind.However, this was not the time savour this new skill. Hence, Zhou Yuan opened his eyes and respectfully bowed towards the smiling old man in black, \"Thank you for this technique master.\"He could faintly feel that both the Qi drawing method and the spirit tempering method were no ordinary techniques. Although the old man before his eyes was mysterious, he had indeed bestowed a huge opportunity onto Zhou Yuan.The old man in black waved his hand. After some hesitation, he suddenly reached into his sleeve and retrieved a black foot-long brush. The black brush seemed to be made from bronze and was mottled with bits of coloring, as if it had been marked by the long pa.s.sage of time. It gave off an antique aura.However, the black brush appeared to be rather dull and lacked the usual glossy l.u.s.ter as if it had lost its innate spirit.The old man in black seemed somewhat reluctant as he held the black brush, but in the end, he still offered it to Zhou Yuan and said, \"Let this be master's gift to you of our first meeting.\"Zhou Yuan carefully accepted the black brush in a respectful manner. It felt rather weighty when it entered his hands. As he observed the ancient patterns on the brush, he could faintly feel a kind of formidable aura.Zhou Yuan curiously asked, \"Is this a Genesis Rune Brush?\"The old man in black replied, \"It is both a Genesis Rune Brush and a Genesis Weapon.\"Zhou Yuan was taken aback, feeling a little confused. A Genesis Rune Brush was a unique medium for inscribing Genesis Runes, while a Genesis Weapon was used for battle. The two described completely different things. How could they both be used on a single object?Moreover, the black brush in his hand looked rather weak. How would it be used to hurt an enemy?\"Heh, looks like it's been underestimated.\" The old man in black could not help but chuckle when he saw Zhou Yuan's expression. \"The name of this brush is Heavenly Yuan Brush. It was once a Sacred Genesis Weapon.\"\"Sacred Genesis Weapon?!\" Zhou Yuan gasped and dumbly stared at the mottled black brush in his hand with eyes filled with disbelief.In this world, Genesis Weapons were more or less divided into different grades, namely Normal, Black, Heaven and Sacred. According to what Zhou Yuan knew, the strongest Genesis Weapon of their Great Zhou royal clan was the Nine Flames Spear wielded by his father, and it was only an upper tier Black Genesis Weapon.The Sacred Genesis Weapons spoken of in legend possessed indescribable power. Power so great that it could burn mountains and evaporate the seas, a power that people both desired and feared.Was the seemingly powerless mottled black brush in Zhou Yuan's hand really a Sacred Genesis Weapon?\"I said that it was once a Sacred Genesis Weapon.\" The old man in black softly snorted before continuing, \"This Heavenly Yuan Brush has accompanied me in countless battles. In one of these battles, it was seriously damaged.\"Only then did Zhou Yuan understand. It was a damaged Sacred Genesis Weapon.Upon seeing Zhou Yuan's expression, the old man could not help but unhappily say, \"Little brat, do you really think that I would be so petty and give you a useless piece of rubbish? Although this Heavenly Yuan Brush was heavily damaged, it is after all a Sacred Genesis Weapon and still retains some remnant spiritual power. As long as you nourish it consistently, it might gradually recover.\"\"Eh?\" Zhou Yuan was amazed. To think that this Sacred Genesis Weapon was still able to be saved.The old man in black pointed at the black brush and said, \"Do you see the nine runes on the brush?\"Zhou Yuan lowered his head, only to discover the faint outline of nine ancient and complicated runes on the mottled black brush. They had been difficult to see because theywere a little too faded.\"These nine runes represent the power of the Heavenly Yuan Brush. When the day comes that you are able to light all nine runes, the brush will recover its Sacred Genesis Weapon power.\"\"How do I light them?\" Zhou Yuan asked with interest. If he could help this Sacred Genesis Weapon regain its power, it would undoubtedly become a huge aid to himself.\"Hehe, it's simple. The Heavenly Yuan Brush has a spirit of its own. If you feed it the spirits of Genesis Beasts, it will gradually regain its power.\"\"Of course, the higher the quality of the Genesis Beast spirit, the better the effect.\"\"As for how the Heavenly Yuan Brush will become a weapon to do battle with others, you will naturally find out when you light the first rune.\" The old man in black grinned as he explained.Although Zhou Yuan knew that the recovery of the Heavenly Yuan Brush to the Sacred Genesis Weapon level would surely not be simple, he still nodded in acknowledgement. The Heavenly Yuan Brush nimbly spun once at his fingertips as he smiled at the old man in black again and said, \"Many thanks to master for giving me this brush. There is one thing though, till now, this disciple has yet to know of master's name.\"The old man in black smiled faintly when he heard this and replied, \"Cang Yuan. That is master's name. Master also has two other disciples, and they can be considered your senior brother disciples. If fate allows it in future, you might be able to meet them and if not, then let it be.\"After Cang Yuan said these words, he s.h.i.+fted his attention away from Zhou Yuan, turning his head to look at the girl in green. The latter's pearly white teeth were gently biting into her moist lips, while her slightly lowered eyes contained some sadness of their imminent separation.She had lived here with Cang Yuan ever since she could remember, and he was undoubtedly her closest kin. Hence, she still felt rather sad despite her rather indifferent and aloof character.\"Aih, foolish girl. There is no such thing as a banquet that never ends.\" Cang Yuan softly sighed. He was silent for some time, before he suddenly fished out a jade pendant from his clothes. The jade pendant glowed faintly, and there seemed to be a nine-petal fire lotus burning on it. Every petal was of a different color.\"Yaoyao, I know that there are many things that you want to ask me, but this is not the time for it. Take it. If there is a chance in future, you will perhaps come to understand.\"\"Besides this, you must be very careful in the event that this jade pendant fire lotus starts to burn, because they will be about to find you!\"Yaoyao urgently asked, \"Who are they? Why are they searching for me?\"Her heart was full of questions. Who were they? Why was it that she had lived here alone with grandpa Hei as if they were hiding from something.Cang Yuan was silent. He did not reply Yaoyao's questions, but merely gently placed the jade pendant in her hands before looking towards Zhou Yuan and speaking in a deep voice, \"Zhou Yuan, you must remember this at all costs. Do not let Yaoyao undo the seal and use Genesis Qi. Else a calamity will surely arrive.\"Zhou Yuan was slightly shaken and glanced at the faintly discernible rune of light between Yaoyao's brows. It turns out that it was a seal. So it was not that Yaoyao was unable to use Genesis Qi, but because she had been sealed...But why?Zhou Yuan's was rather puzzled. However, he sensibly chose to not probe any further. Both Cang Yuan and Yaoyao were undoubtedly full of mystery. There was likely some kind of story behind them.In addition, given his current capabilities, he still did not have the qualifications to know such a story.Zhou Yuan earnestly replied. \"Don't worry master, I will remember.\"Cang Yuan nodded before continuing, \"You can seek out Yaoyao if you encounter any problems in your training in future. After following me for so many years, she has long since learnt everything I know. But of course, whether you will recieve help or not will depend on her mood.\"Upon hearing this, Zhou Yuan's eyes seem to brighten slightly as he looked towards the big sis in green. He had originally been worried about hiccups in his cultivation due to being alone, and would never have antic.i.p.ated that this big sis had concealed herself so deeply. Looks like he would need to curry favor with her in future.However, the big sis in green was still immersed in her sadness and did not pay any attention to him.\"Both of you should go.\"Cang Yuan patted the girl's tiny hands as he slowly said.\"Now?\" Zhou Yuan was stunned. Was this not a little too quick?\"Leave now!\" There was an additional trace of sternness in Cang Yuan's voice.Zhou Yuan did not say anything else. He could feel that Cang Yuan was chasing them away and it was likely that something was about to happen here.Cang Yuan waved his sleeve and dust started to rise from the ground in front of the cottage as ancient runes swiftly followed. If one took a closer look, one would discover that these were profound and mysterious runes.These runes were exactly the same as the runes on the stone platform from which Zhou Yuan had arrived from.Zhou Yuan saw the look in Cang Yuan's eyes and swiftly walked forward into the array formed by the runes. Meanwhile, the girl in green hugged the little creature called Tuntun while she blankly stared at Cang Yuan.\"Go, there may perhaps still be a day where we will meet again in future.\" Cang Yuan waved his hand.The girl in green's eyes were slightly tinged with red, but she did not break out into tears in the end. Instead, she bowed deeply to Cang Yuan before walking into the array and stood beside Zhou Yuan.Cang Yuan's finger immediately jabbed at the air when he saw this. Light exploded from the runes and coverged together, swiftly enveloping both Zhou Yuan and Yaoyao.\"Zhou Yuan, remember the promise you made to master, you must protect her!\"Light flooded the eyes. When s.p.a.ce began to distort, Zhou Yuan heard Cang Yuan's deep voice, a voice that seemed to contain a slightly pleading tone.\"Don't worry master! Since I have undertaken your teachings, I will naturally protect her!\"Zhou Yuan closed his eyes and uttered in his heart.Light blossomed before the cottage as a gale erupted. In the next instant, Zhou Yuan and Yaoyao vanished into thin air, and only the flickering runes remained. The runes continued to flicker for some time before being thoroughly extinguished, leaving no traces behind.Cang Yuan gazed at the spot where the two had disappeared with some melonchany in his eyes as he softly mumbled, \"Zhou clan\u2026 it is indeed as that old fellow said, I was still able to take another disciple. However, what the future holds will depend on his luck and destiny.\"He shook his head as he collected himself, slowly laying back on the chair as he gently started to rock back and forth.The entire place was quiet and peaceful.It was unknown how long this peace lasted when Cang Yuan suddenly opened his tightly shut eyes and indifferently stared at the empty s.p.a.ce.Rumble!A wild clap of thunder suddenly boomed across the area. It seemed as if lightning was pouring down in the distant sky above, ripping open this domain in an extremely barbaric manner.The ground started to collapse as patches of forests fell.\"So it has still come in the end.\"Cang Yuan watched the devastation, but his aged face remained expressionless as he mumbled to himself.\"Oh well, these old bones of mine are about to become rusty after recuperating for so many years, it is indeed time for some exercise\u2026\" Cang Yuan grinned before slowly standing up from his chair.Cang Yuan appeared hunchback, but the moment he stood up, his black robes slowly began to flutter as an indescribably terrifying aura completely awakened like an angry dragon being roused from a deep sleep.Lightning seemed to cover the entire sky as it poured down, and three figures wrapped in lightning slowly descended from within. When they appeared, three frightening auras unfurled from their bodies and engulfed the land as if they were high ranking G.o.ds.Their ice-cold gazes were thrown towards Cang Yuan's far away body.\"Hehe, to think that the almighty emperor Hei will hide like a rat for so many years. Truly a tale that brings tears to the eye\u2026\" An emotionless voice descended from the heavens. As it spread, the domain began to show signs of rapidly falling apart.\"Hand her over! Or this place will become your grave today!\"A mocking smile formed on Cang Yuan's face when he heard the cold voice, and a thunderous laughter echoed in response.\"Haha, come, come, come. I really want to see exactly whose grave this place will be today!\"Cang Yuan took a step forward and his clothes immediately disintegrated, revealing a thin and withered body. This body was inscribed with numerous complicated ancient runes, every rune pulsing with terrible power.Buzz!Blinding light erupted from the runes at this moment. The light was akin to the steadily rising scorching sun, while Cang Yuan's originally withered body suddenly started to swell.In the short span of several breaths, a giant now towered on the ground as a torrential and tyrannical aura unfurled.He roared at the heavens, the wave of sound devastating the surroundings. In the next instance, his foot stamped on the ground and a t.i.tanic body shot upwards, slamming into the endless sea of lightning that descended from the sky with a loud bang.Boom boom boom!It was at this very moment that the entire domain started to fall apart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He ma.s.saged his forehead, trying to alleviate the discomfort.\"Yuan'er?\"A happy and surprised voice could be heard from the front when the light scattered. Zhou Yuan raised his head and saw Zhou Qing joyfully looking at him from in front of the stone platform.Zhou Yuan smiled and said, \"Father.\"\"You really gave me a huge scare you stinking brat!\" Zhou Qing's eyes were filled with impatience as he quickly walked forward. More than half a day prior, he had seen Zhou Yuan disappear on the stone platform. That sight had alarmed him greatly and caused him to be at a loss.When Zhou Yuan saw Zhou Qing's expression, he understood that Zhou Qing had likely been worrying himself to death here and felt somewhat sorry. Zhou Yuan scratched his head and promptly said, \"Father, my eight meridian channels have appeared!\"\"What?!\"Zhou Qing's body jerked as his hand hastily slapped onto Zhou Yuan's shoulder. A stream of Genesis Qi entered Zhou Yuan's body to probe.The outcome was known to Zhou Qing several breaths later as his hand involuntarily started to tremble. He was overwhelmed with emotion as he heavily patted Zhou Yuan's shoulders.\"Good, great, excellent. It is truly a blessing from our forefathers. The heavens have not closed their doors to our Zhou clan!\" Zhou Qing's voice was slightly trembling, and his eyes had become moist. It was easy to imagine how emotional he currently was.Zhou Yuan's inability to begin channel opening cultivation had been a thorn in Zhou Qing's heart. He had felt that it was because of his powerlessness as a father back then that Zhou Yuan's destiny would be stolen by king Wu at birth, causing him to be in this miserable state.Zhou Qing had seeked out every method, but none of them could find Zhou Yuan's channels. Hence, Zhou Qing could only place his final hope on the secret saying that had been pa.s.sed down in their Zhou clan.And now, it looked like the heavens was still looking after their Zhou clan.A warm feeling flowed in Zhou Yuan's heart when he saw such a look on the usually calm and dignified Zhou Qing. The former reached out his arms and lightly patted Zhou Qing's wide back as he gently smiled and said, \"Don't worry father, we will make sure to take back everything our Zhou clan has lost!\"Zhou Qing collected himself a little as he forcefully nodded. It was at this same moment that he looked behind Zhou Yuan and saw the girl in green standing there hugging a little gray creature, while her bright eyes coolly watched them.\"Yuan'er?\" Zhou Qing at a complete loss as he looked towards Zhou Yuan. It was obvious that he did not know why Zhou Yuan would return with a mysterious girl.Upon seeing this, Zhou Yuan started to describe everything he had seen and what had happened in the mysterious domain.After listening, Zhou Qing was silent for some time before he spoke, \"Since our Zhou clan forefathers left behind such a secret saying, they must have some relation to the elder in black. Moreover, having received his gifts and blessings, you must naturally accomplish the task he left to you.\"Having said this, Zhou Qing revealed a warm smile to the girl in green and said, \"Little miss, if you have nowhere to go, you can stay in Great Zhou. We will definitely ensure your safety here.\"Yaoyao's small head lightly nodded when she heard this as her soft yet indifferent voice sounded, \"I'll have to trouble you then.\"\"It's no trouble, no trouble at all.\" Zhou Qing smiled as he waved his hand, before he turned to Zhou Yuan and said, \"Since your problem has already been solved, let us prepare to return to Great Zhou city. Your mother has been waiting for news of you all this time.\"Zhou Yuan nodded. Likewise, he really wanted to tell this good news to Qin Yu.The trio followed the secret pa.s.sage out of the cavern and walked out of the shrine on the summit of the mountain.Zhou Qing went ahead to instruct the imperial guards to get ready while Yaoyao hugged Tuntun as she stood at the edge of the cliff. Her pretty eyes were a little blank as she observed this foreign land.A breeze brushed at her clothes, outlining her exquisite curves while also making the girl look rather lonely and distant. There was only Tuntun in her arms making small noises to console her.Zhou Yuan walked to Yaoyao's side and softly said, \"Big sister Yaoyao, you don't need to worry. Master possess great powers and will be alright. We will definitely see him again in future.\"He knew that no matter how much calmness and indifference Yaoyao displayed, there would still be some unease in such a foreign place.Yaoyao glanced at him and said in a small voice, \"I know that grandpa Hei chased me away because formidable enemies were coming.\"\"These foes came for me, and grandpa Hei stopped them for me.\"Although Cang Yuan had never spoken of these matters to her, she was keenly able tosense that these disasters had been drawn to them because of her.Zhou Yuan scratched his head. He did not know the ident.i.ties and background of these two individuals. Thus, he was unaware of the story that was hidden here.Zhou Yuan slowly said, \"Big sis Yaoyao, perhaps it is as you say. However, I feel that the current you should not blame yourself, else, you will have betrayed master's efforts, and everything that he has done will lose its value.\"Yaoyao's fair hand gently stroked Tuntun's soft fur as she gazed into the distance. Soon after, she showed a light-hearted smile to Zhou Yuan and nodded. \"Relax, I am not that kind of person. I will make sure to get to the bottom of this matter in future. When that time comes, if anything happens to grandpa Hei, I will definitely avenge him. Not a single one of those people will be able to escape.\"Her calm and cool voice contained an iciness that made Zhou Yuan tremble a little.This big sis looked like a little fairy, but when she became serious, it appeared that she would be able to kill decisively.\u2026Great Zhou royal palace.The moment Qin Yu came to know of the news, she immediately hugged Zhou Yuan on the spot as she cried, causing him to feel both touched and helpless.Zhou Qing helplessly said from the side, \"Alright, alright. Yuan'er being able to cultivate is good news, there is no need to weep so much.\"\"Don't tell me that you did not cry?\" Qin Yu wiped her eyes and glared at Zhou Qing.Zhou Qing awkwardly rubbed his nose. He had likewise been on the brink of tears when he sensed Zhou Yuan's eight meridian channels in the cavern. However, these tears had been forcibly suppressed in the end.Zhou Qing did not dare to speak any more and hastily changed the topic. \"First help make arrangements for Yaoyao.\"Only then did Qin Yu realise that there was someone else watching from the side. She was somewhat embarra.s.sed as she wiped away her tears and revealed a warm and gentle smile to Yaoyao. \"Yaoyao, you do not need to care about other things while staying here. We will definitely ensure that you will not face even the slightest mistreatment.\"Qin Yu was extremely affectionate to Yaoyao. Although it was mostly out of grat.i.tude for helping Zhou Yuan, it was evident that she rather liked this girl. After all, anyone who saw such a pretty girl would definitely be fond of her.Yaoyao was a little unaccustomed to Qin Yu's warmness. She had after all lived with Cang Yuan in that isolated domain since young and had practically zero contact with any outsiders. Moreover, she was aloof by nature and was not good at communicating with others.However, she could feel the sincerity and grat.i.tude from Qin Yu's heart. Therefore, she was not overly resistant and merely glanced at Zhou Yuan before allowing Qin Yu to drag her away.While Qin Yu led Yaoyao away, Zhou Qing and Zhou Yuan exchanged a look and helplessly chuckled.\"Your majesty, headmaster Chu seeks an audience!\" An imperial guard reported at this moment.Headmaster Chu was the headmaster of Great Zhou Inst.i.tute, Chu Tianyang, while also an important general under Zhou Qing.\"Let him in.\" Zhou Qing nodded before looking towards Zhou Yuan, who was about to leave, and said, \"Stay. In any case, you are the prince of Great Zhou and should know of certain matters.\"Zhou Yuan was slightly stunned. He did not reply but nodded his head in acknowledgement.A well-built figure walked in from outside the great doors of the inner palace. It was a middle-aged man wearing a purple jacket. He had a determined-looking face and wind seemed to accompany his steps with 'whoo whoo' noises.\"Greetings your majesty.\" The middle-aged man wearing a purple jacket bowed as he cupped his fists together towards Zhou Qing, before he looked towards Zhou Yuan by the side and nodded with a smile, \"Your highness.\"\"Headmaster.\" Zhou Yuan did not dare to be the neglectful. Chu Tianyang was an important official who had father's deep trust and was also his right-hand man. In addition, he was the headmaster of the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute.Zhou Qing waved his hand and smiled. \"What is the matter?\"After hearing this, Chu Tianyang first glanced at Zhou Yuan.Zhou Qing chuckled. \"There is no problem. Let him hear it.\"Chu Tianyang nodded. He had a bitter smile on his face as he sighed and said, \"Your majesty, Xu Hong is currently eyeing my position as headmaster.\"Zhou Yuan's heart s.h.i.+vered a little. Xu Hong was the current deputy-head of the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute. However, he was on king Qi's side and blindly followed the latter. He often payed lip service to the Great Zhou royal clan while opposing them in secret.Zhou Yuan knew that king Qi had desired the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute for a long time and wanted to take control of it. Thus, he had secretly tried to sink his claws into the inst.i.tute and Xu Hong's current position had been arranged by him through various means in an attempt to seize the position of headmaster.\"Your majesty, according to the information I have secretly obtained, that little prince Qi Yue has use an extremely high price to continuously coerce or entice the outstanding students that emerge in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute.\"\"In this year's newcomer exam alone, more than half of the students that are able to enter the top ten have been drawn to his side.\"Moreover, once these students pa.s.s the newcomer exam, they will chose to enter Xu Hong's B cla.s.s. After the newcomer exam comes the cla.s.s ranking exam. In the past two years, the quality of the B cla.s.s students on a whole has been higher than my A cla.s.s, and they have already obtained first place in the cla.s.s ranking exam twice. If they are allowed to succeed again this time, Xu Hong will take the opportunity to rise up and seize the position of headmaster.\"Back when Zhou Qing established the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute, to motivate the various cla.s.ses, he had created the rule that any cla.s.s master that was able to take first place in the cla.s.s ranking exam for three years in a row would be able to run for the headmaster position.Chu Tianyang's A cla.s.s was originally the strongest, but due to Xu Hong's subsequent emergence and king Qi's strong financial support to continuously draw the outstanding students to their side, the originally strongest A cla.s.s had been suppressed by B cla.s.s for the past two years.It was evident that Xu Hong's target was the headmaster position. Once he became headmaster, the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute would likely fall into king Qi's hands and the flow of talented individuals would be taken away by the latter. For the royal clan, this was practically cutting off their flesh.Most importantly, if king Qi was allowed to get away with this, it would result in the many factions on the sidelines thinking the royal clan was in the decline and no longer able to contest with king Qi. It would be devastating if these factions chose to cast their lot in with the latter.Zhou Yuan's brows were tightly furrowed as he looked towards Zhou Qing. The latter's eyebrows were currently twitching a little. A long while later, a dark voice was slowly spat out from between his teeth.\"This king Qi truly has a huge appet.i.te!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12 Genesis FoodPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe atmosphere in the inner palace was somewhat stifling. Zhou Qing's expression was dark while murder surged in his eyes. It was clear that he was now full of killing intent due to king Qi's actions.However, Zhou Qing ultimately gritted his teeth and restraint his killing intent. This was because the current king Qi was also very powerful. Moreover, the Great Wu Empire secretly supported him. If Zhou Qing was to openly declare war, even if he won, their Great Zhou's many years of recovery would be wasted. When that happened, the internal troubles and outside hostility facing Great Zhou would cause it to be wiped out.King Qi needed to be eliminated, but this had to be done step by step. The current Great Zhou could not afford too much turmoil.Zhou Qing deeply breathed in and slowly said, \"There is still half a year to the cla.s.s ranking exam. Who has the best chance of obtaining the top rank this time?\"Chu Tianyang was silent for a while before he replied, \"There are indeed some pretty good saplings amongst this batch of students, but I'm afraid that the most outstanding one is B cla.s.s' Qi Yue. He has already opened his sixth meridian channel.\"\"Qi Yue\u2026\" It was impossible to tell whether Zhou Qing was angry or happy as he said in a low voice, \"King Qi's two sons are truly talented.\"Qi Yue was the second of king Qi's two sons.\"So it looks like first place will land in Qi Yue's hands?\"Chu Tianyang mumbled to himself a little after hearing this before he replied, \"That might not be the case. Our Great Zhou Inst.i.tute still has a genius that is even more outstanding than Qi Yue. If she enters the A cla.s.s, there might be a possibility of contesting against Qi Yue half a year later.\"\"Oh?\" Zhou Qing was slightly taken aback. A student that was even more talented than QiYue in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute?Chu Tianyang chuckled before looking to Zhou Yuan as he grinned and said, \"Could your majesty have forgotten his highness little girlfriend, Su Youwei?\"Zhou Yuan was somewhat embarra.s.sed by Chu Tianyang's teasing laughter. The former's face was slightly red as he replied, \"Youwei is a friend, not a girlfriend!\"Zhou Qing also understood at this moment and suddenly said, \"You mean the little la.s.s that Yuan'er recommended into the inst.i.tute right?\"Chu Tianyang nodded and said, \"Yes, she is called Su Youwei. However, she has already opened her third meridian channel. Although she entered the inst.i.tute a little later than usual, she will surely be able to take one of the top spots in this year's newcomer exam.\"Zhou Qing exclaimed in surprise. \"Already opened her third meridian channel?\" This speed was indeed rather quick. At this rate, she might open all eight meridian channels in a year and reach the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage.The little la.s.s called Su Youwei was indeed rather talented and her prospects practically limitless.\"Looks like Yuan'er has unearthed a genius for Great Zhou.\" Zhou Qing smiled at Zhou Yuan.Chu Tianyang also smiled. Soon after however, he said in a somewhat worried manner, \"But according to the information I have gathered, Qi Yue has come into contact with Su Youwei in hopes of drawing her over to their side. If he succeeds, I'm afraid that Su Youwei will join the B cla.s.s after the newcomer exam.\"He then looked towards Zhou Yuan as he smiled and said, \"Hence, another reason why I came here was to ask for your highness help. At the minimum, I hope that you can help our A cla.s.s get a stable hold on Su Youwei.\"Zhou Yuan's eyes suddenly became a little more imposing upon hearing this. To think that Qi Yue would actually dare to target Youwei. Zhou Yuan fairly trusted Su Youwei, and felt that Qi Yue could not possibly entice her to their side, but he was worried that Qi Yue would try to hinder her.\"Don't worry your highness, I have long since sent people to secretly protect Su Youwei. She will not be hurt.\" Said Chu Tianyang with a smile as if he knew what Zhou Yuan was thinking.Only then did Zhou Yuan breath a small sigh of relief before he lightly nodded. \"Headmaster also does not need to worry. After the newcomer exam, Su Youwei and I will join the A cla.s.s.\"Only then did Chu Tianyang nod as he smiled and said, \"As long as your highness can bring Su Youwei into the A cla.s.s, I will bend the rules and also allow your highness in.\"According to the rules, only the top ten individuals had the qualifications to enter the A cla.s.s. Despite Zhou Yuan's bit of skill in Genesis Runes, it was likely that he would still be unable to rank amongst the top ten given that he had yet to open even a single meridian channel. Thus, from Chu Tianyang's point of view, Zhou Yuan needed certain special procedures in order to enter the A cla.s.s.Zhou Qing could not help but laugh as he remarked, \"To make a stickler to the rules like you make such a concession, looks like you think very highly of Su Youwei.\"Zhou Yuan also smiled as he looked at Chu Tianyang. \"It is Youwei's fortune to be so highly appraised by headmaster. As for me, there is no need to make things difficult for headmaster with regards to opening a backdoor for me. I will do my best to take one of the top ten spots in the newcomer exam.\"If it was before, where he was unable to open his meridian channels, Zhou Yuan would perhaps have no better option than to rely on Genesis Runes. But now that his eight meridian channels had appeared, he could formally begin his channel opening training and was naturally no longer worried that he would not be able to catch up to those people.Chu Tianyang was under the impression that the young Zhou Yuan wanted to maintain his dignity when he heard this reply. Hence, Chu Tianyang planned to persuade the latter again.\"Hehe, let him try.\" Zhou Qing waved his hand at Chu Tianyang while chuckling. \"Yuan'er's eight meridian channels have emerged and can formally begin his cultivation training.\"Chu Tianyang was initially stunned by these words. Happiness involuntarily surged on his face as he cupped his fists together and said, \"So that's why. Then I'll have to congratulate your majesty and your highness.\"It was only now that he understood why Zhou Qing was so cheerful today. The cultivation problem that had plagued Zhou Yuan for many years had finally been resolved.\"My A cla.s.s awaits your highness' grand arrival. Hehe, your highness will perhaps even be able to achieve some glory for my A cla.s.s in the cla.s.s ranking exam in half a year.\"Of course, these words of his were mostly flattery. After all, from his point of view, although Zhou Yuan was able to begin channel opening cultivation, his starting point was still rather late compared to others. At the very least, it was likely that he would not be able to contest against the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute's top students in the a short period of half a year.\"Chu Tianyang was clearly much more at ease after confirming the matter of Su Youwei. After discussing some matters with Zhou Qing, the former bid his goodbyes and left.Seeing that Chu Tianyang had left, Zhou Qing turned to Zhou Yuan and said, \"Now that your eight meridian channels have appeared, prepare to begin your training tomorrow.\"\"Alright!\"Zhou Yuan nodded. Though his thin and immature face was calm, his eyes burned with impatience. He could not wait to get started....The next day.Zhou Yuan and Yaoyao carrying Tuntun sat on the left side of a table, while Zhou Qing and Qin Yu sat on the right.On the table was a porcelain bowl the size of a washbasin. It was filled with a brown soup-like liquid which faintly glimmered with small specks of light. A strong fragrance rose from the bowl and a single breath of it made one's face flush red.Zhou Qing smiled at Zhou Yuan and explained, \"This is the Nine Beast Soup and is made from nine types of tier 1 Genesis Beasts. The ingredients neutralize each other and it is a great supplement to a beginner pract.i.tioner like yourself. The past you was unable to open your meridian channels and thus could not drink this as your body might not be able to take it. But now, you can.\"Zhou Yuan nodded. He knew that this Nine Beast Soup was their royal clan's secret recipe and a single bowl was worth a fortune. Ordinary clans would likely not be able to afford it even with half a year of earnings.This was the so-called cultivation resource.\"Besides this, you shall no longer eat normal rice.\" With a wave of Zhou Qing's hand, a servant girl brought in a silver bowl. It was a bowl of rice.However, this rice was sparkled like crystal. Every grain was equally plump, while mystical patterns were barely discernible on the each one. The rice emitted extremely gentle Genesis Qi undulations.\"This is the Mysterious Crystal Rice, a grade 2 Genesis Food. It contains extremely pure and gentle Genesis Qi that is easy to absorb. If eaten in the long run, it will help speed up the rate of opening one's meridian channels.\"\"So this is Mysterious Crystal Rice\u2026\" Zhou Yuan curiously observed the bowl of crystal-like rice. He had long heard of this dish because it was practically considered Great Zhou's strategic resource.The medicinal effect of this Mysterious Crystal Rice was was perhaps incomparable to the earlier Nine Beast Soup. However, the Mysterious Crystal Rice had the advantage of being gentle in nature and consuming it in the long run would better the quality of one's body, hence speeding up the rate of channel opening.Thus, the cultivation method for the Mysterious Crystal Rice was controlled by the royal clan and was used to both reward those who did good service and win over the hearts of the people.Hence, though it was only a grade 2 Genesis Food, due to certain special reasons, its true value was difficult to put in words.Zhou Qing could not help but chuckle as he watched the excited Zhou Yuan. Zhou Qing knew that the Zhou Yuan of the past coveted this Mysterious Crystal Rice, but because his eight meridian channels had never appeared, he was unable to consume and utilise it.\"Our Great Zhou royal storage room originally had an extremely potent grade 4 Genesis Food, 'Blood Rain-Dragon Barley'. Long term consumption would strengthen one's physical body and cause Blood Rain-Dragon scales to grow. These scales possess great defensive power.\" Said Zhou Qing with a sigh.\"Grade 4 Genesis Food, Blood Rain-Dragon Barley?\" Zhou Yuan licked his lips. With the knowledge of how awesome the grade 2 Mysterious Crystal Rice was already, just how crazy would that grade 4 Blood Rain-Dragon Barley be?Zhou Qing nodded in acknowledgement. Soon after however, his expression dimmed as he said, \"It's a pity that these strategic treasures of our Great Zhou royal storage were taken by king Wu during the chaos caused by Great Wu back then.\"Zhou Yuan was initially stunned before he involuntarily gritted his teeth. This wretched king Wu had really cleaned out the treasures that originally belonged to Great Zhou.Zhou Qing regained control of his feelings and said to Zhou Yuan, \"Eat these first then prepare to start training.\"Zhou Yuan forcefully nodded. Although king Wu was loathsome, what Zhou Yuan needed to do now was to eat and work hard in his cultivation. Only when he became strong would he be able to take back what Great Zhou had lost.A bowl of Nine Beast Soup and Mysterious Crystal Rice were similarly placed in front of Yaoyao.\"Yaoyao, you can try if these are to your liking. If you like them, they will be also be prepared for you in future.\" Qin Yu smiled warmly as she looked at Yaoyao.Yaoyao could feel Qin Yu's kindness and lightly nodded in response before she drank a mouthful of Nine Beast Soup. However, it seemed that she was not too interested in the highly nutritious beast soup but instead lifted the bowl of Mysterious Crystal Rice and ate one small mouthful at a time.\"Woo.\"Tuntun anxiously gazed at her from her lap, wagging its tail as it emitted pitiful-sounding 'woo woo' noises.Yaoyao glanced at it and brought the Nine Beast Soup over to it after some thought.Upon seeing this, Zhou Qing smiled and said, \"Eh Yaoyao. The medicinal properties of the Nine Beast Soup is too strong. Ordinary pets cannot drink it\u2026\"Ao!However, before he could finish his sentence, Tuntun had already widened its mouth and swallowed the soup together with the bowl in a single gulp.After wolfing down the Nine Beast Soup, Tuntun let out a belch. Its patted its stomach with its paw while its eyes narrowed as if it was not sufficient.Zhou Qing was astonished as he looked at the perfectly fine Tuntun.\"Father, Tuntun is a special creature.\" Zhou Yuan could not help but grin after seeing this scene.Tuntun could easily finish off a boulder in two to three bites, let alone a bowl of Nine Beast Soup.Zhou Qing could only show a forced smile as he nodded before he picked up a jade bottle at his side and pour himself a cup of jadeite-color alcohol, causing the strong fragrance of alcohol to spread.The smell of alcohol spread, causing the eyebrows of the silently eating Yaoyao to suddenly raise slightly as her clear and bright eyes looked towards Zhou Qing.\"May I have some of that?\" Zhou Yuan and Qin Yu stared at Yaoyao in shock. It was the first time that a strong look of desire had appeared on her usually emotionless face.Zhou Qing was also taken aback. In particular, he felt even more awkward when he saw the gaze of reproach Qin Yu threw at him for absentmindedly drinking in front of the children as he said, \"This is Jadeite Brew. It is a strong alcoholic drink and not suitable for a young lady.\"However, Yaoyao continued to stare at him with bright and clear eyes, causing Zhou Qing to let out a bitter laugh before he signalled for a servant girl to place a bottle of Jadeite Brew in front of Yaoyao.Yaoyao raised the wine bottle and tilted her head slightly, revealing slender swan-white neck, before she directly took a huge mouthful of the alcohol. A crimson flush immediately arose on her pretty jade-like face.\"Good.\" Yaoyao released a soft laughter, a laughter akin to the chime of a silver bell.Qin Yu glared at Zhou Qing, causing him to rub his nose and drink his alcohol in a slightly depressed manner. He would never have imagined that this mysterious girl, who always wore an uninterested look, would be fond of drinking.By the side, Zhou Yuan seemed to be full of interest. When Yaoyao drank, she undoubtedly appeared even more breathtaking and full of life.After downing an entire bottle of Jadeite Brew, Yaoyao's clear eyes had become a little more watery. With a soft chuckle, she reached into her sleeve as a flash of light shot out and landed before Qin Yu.Yaoyao smiled and said, \"Auntie Qin, I can tell that your weak aura is most probably due to poor health. This little gift shall be my payment for the alcohol.\"The light gradually receded and transformed into a green palm-sized lotus. Eight lotus seeds flickered with green light within the flower like a jade masterpiece.\"This is?\" Qin Yu blankly gazed at the green lotus.Zhou Qing's expression subconsciously changed as he said in astonishment, \"Those are Green Jade Lotus Seeds, a rare Genesis resource. It has lifeforce nursing properties and also moisturizes the body.\"With a complicated expression, Zhou Qing continued, \"This item is enormously beneficial to you. Your body is too weak and these Green Jade Lotus Seeds will be able to help you stop the loss of life energy.\"These Green Jade Lotus Seeds were very rare and an uncommon sight even in their Great Zhou royal treasury.Qin Yu hurriedly shook her head upon hearing this. \"Yaoyao, a bottle of Jadeite Brew is not worth so much.\"Yaoyao merely pursed her lips and smiled before carrying Tuntun and leisurely walking away, leaving three wide-eyed people at the table.Zhou Yuan scratched his head and said, \"Accept it mother, we will find an opportunity to repay big sister Yaoyao in future.\"He was rather grateful towards this act of Yaoyao's. After all, he knew that the reason why Qin Yu's body was so weak was completely because of him.Qin Yu exchanged a look with Zhou Qing, only to see a nod from the latter. She became a little more fond of the girl.Zhou Yuan smiled before lifting the bowl of Nine Beast Soup and sending it straight towards his mouth. 'Gulp gulp'. His throat continuously swallowed as he drained the entire bowl.Having finished the Nine Beast Soup, he lifted the bowl of Mysterious Crystal Rice and swallowed each mouthful after two to three rounds of chewing.\"Delicious!\" Praised Zhou Yuan. This Mysterious Crystal Rice was full, soft and moist enough. Every grain was very savory.Phew.After several minutes, Zhou Yuan put down the bowl and let out a drawn out breath. The breath of air floated in front of him like white fog as he face flushed red. His body felt like a stove, a burning sensation circulating all over within it.As he felt the burning sensation in his body, Zhou Yuan licked his lips while his eyes flooded with excitement. He was finally going to formally begin his training!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13 Unblocking the Meridian ChannelsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHundreds of flowers contested with their fragrances in the flower park where a stone pavillion stood and a little stream flowed. It was a refres.h.i.+ng and serene place.Zhou Yuan's eyes were closed as he sat inside the stone pavilion while instructions flowed in his mind. It was the Qi drawing method, 'Dragon Breathing', that Cang Yuan had imparted to him previously.One was unable to practice cultivation techniques during the Channel Opening stage, and could only utilise Qi drawing methods to draw the natural Genesis Qi of the land into the body and attack the sealed eight meridian channels to open them bit by bit.Hence, there was no need to doubt the importance of a Qi drawing method to one at the Channel Opening stage.A high cla.s.s Qi drawing method would allow a Channel Opening stage pract.i.tioner to achieve better results with less effort.There were also Qi drawing methods in the royal treasury. However, after Zhou Yuan gave it some consideration, he still chose Cang Yuan's 'Dragon Breathing'. After all, Cang Yuan was an unfathomable individual and the techniques that he imparted were likely extraordinary.\"Like its namesake, Dragon Breathing mimics the breathing of a dragon. Each breath has the power to extinguish wind and clouds.\"\"Extreme skill and practice is needed for a human to imitate a dragon's breathing. Only when one is able to achieve resonance of the flesh and blood and release a dragon roar would one be able to absorb Genesis Qi.\"Zhou Yuan meticulously savoured the 'Dragon Breathing method' and eventually found the most important instructions hidden within it.\"Ninety eight forms of the frolicking dragon.\"Toughening the inner flesh was required for a human to mimic a dragon's breathing, and this hidden ninety eight forms of the frolicking dragon was the most important piece.One by one, unusual forms flashed in Zhou Yuan's mind. There were a total of ninety eight strange forms. Together, they faintly resembled a frolicking dragon.Zhou Yuan engraved these movements in his heart before walking out of the stone pavilion. He then lifted his arms started to slowly momic the first form.His first round of practice undoubtedly appeared rather rough. By the time Zhou Yuan slowly completed all ninety eight actions, he was already drenched in sweat and his body felt like a burning stove.However, what caused Zhou Yuan to frown slightly was that although his body was burning after completing all ninety eight movements, he did not absorb even the tiniest bit of Genesis Qi.\"It feels as if I'm still lacking a little something.\" Zhou Yuan mumbled to himself before wiping his sweat and continuing his practice of the frolicking dragon forms.An incense stick of time later, Zhou Yuan was dripping with sweat as he finally stopped. He had completed three whole cycles. However, he had yet to absorb any Genesis Qi, causing him to feel as if he had been practising a fake technique.\"It is indeed a little inconvenient to fumble about on my own without a master's guidance.\" Zhou Yuan helplessly shook his head. Looks like he needed to practice a few more times to try and grasp its essence.Just as Zhou Yuan was planning to continue, he suddenly saw a beautiful figure standing in the flower park from the corner of his eye. His eyes immediately brightened a little as he smiled and headed over.\"Big sis Yaoyao, you've come at the right time. I hope to seek some guidance from you.\"The beautiful figure was naturally Yaoyao. Upon hearing Zhou Yuan's voice, she crooked her head and looked at him while carrying Tuntun in her arms. Subsequently, a slight smile was revealed on her exquisite and fair face as she extended five slender fingers. \"Guarantee that I will be given five bottles of Jadeite Brew daily and I will teach you.\"Zhou Yuan was taken aback. Soon after, his eyebrows furrowed as he replied, \"Five bottles is too many. That alcohol is too fierce in nature and will harm your body. I can only give you one bottle a day.\"Yaoyao was about to speak again.\"Any more will be impossible, if not I will go mull over it myself.\" However, Zhou Yuan was firm. If Cang Yuan found out that Yaoyao became a heavy drinker mere days after following Zhou Yuan, the former would likely kick Zhou Yuan out from his disciples.h.i.+p in rage.Yaoyao could only wrinkle her nose and let out a soft snort after seeing Zhou Yuan's resolve before she threw Tuntun forward. \"Take a good look.\"\"What do I look at?\" Asked Zhou Yuan in bewilderment. Yaoyao did not seem to have any intentions of showing him the frolicking dragon forms.Yaoyao pointed to the ground at Tuntun and said in a slightly unhappy manner, \"Look at it!\"The corner's of Zhou Yuan's mouth twitched for a moment. However, before he could speak, his pupils abruptly shrank, his face looking as if he had seen a ghost. On the ground, the short and stout Tuntun had suddenly stood up on two legs and started to do a series of profound actions. It was the ninety eight forms of the frolicking dragon.\"This\u2026 Tuntun can learn the frolicking dragon forms?!\" Zhou Yuan was dumbstruck.Under Zhou Yuan's stupefied gaze, Tuntun smoothly completed all ninety eight movements. After the final action was done, Tuntun's body suddenly jolted as it opened its mouth wide and the faint roar of a dragon could be heard.Huuhuu!Genesis Qi surged over from the surroundings and transformed into a white line that poured into Tuntun's mouth.After gulping down the vigorous Genesis Qi, Tuntun patted its stomach in satisfiction and turned its head to look at the dumbstruck Zhou Yuan as it disdainfully rolled its eyes.Zhou Yuan gradually came to his senses at this moment and oddly stared at the little fellow. Exactly what kind of Genesis Beast was Tuntun? To think that it would actually be able to learn human techniques.\"Have you understood?\" Yaoyao's airy voice could be heard.Zhou Yuan pushed down the shock in his heart and muttered to himself for a while. A long time later, he slowly said, \"It's breathing! To master the frolicking dragon forms, one needs to maintain the tempo of one's breathing and allow one's body and breathing to resonate.\"\"Dragon Breathing imitates the breathing of a real dragon. A dragon's breathing is drawn-out and unbroken, Tuntun's every action began with inhalation and ends with exhalation. Only when both are in sync will Dragon Breathing be triggered.\"Yaoyao's eyes flashed when she heard this as she stared in astonishment at Zhou Yuan. A rare sigh of praise was emitted as she said, \"Your comprehension ability is not bad.\"To realise the essence after merely watching Tuntun complete a set of frolicking dragon forms. It was no wonder that he had caught grandpa Hei's eye.Zhou Yuan closed his eyes and recalled the rhythm of Tuntun's breathing from before. A long while later, his legs slowly stretched out as his fists were lifted and he once again started to perform the first action of the dragon frolicking forms.A youngster's body swayed in the flower park. His chest heaved up and down as he breathing became drawn-out. From a distance, it looked as if a young dragon was stretching its body.The ninety eight movements were tightly linked together, while Zhou Yuan's eyes seemed to grow increasingly brighter. He could feel the flesh and bones inside his body start to vibrate at this moment.A breath climbed up along his flesh before finally das.h.i.+ng up his throat.With this final movement, Zhou Yuan's face flushed red as his tightly shut mouth abruptly opened.Roar!A faint dragon roar emerged through his throat from within his body.At the same time, Zhou Yuan's chest sunk inwards. Like a giant dragon breathing in water, the Genesis Qi in the flower park was drawn towards him, directly turning into a white line that could be seen with the naked eye, as it shot into Zhou Yuan's body with a single gulp.This influx of a single mouthful of Genesi Qi immediately caused Zhou Yuan's skin to become scalding hot. The Genesis Qi from the consumption of the Nine Beast Soup and Mysterious Crystal Rice from before also rose at this moment and joined the pure Genesis Qi that had entered his body. Like a wave, the newly merged Genesis Qi surged towards his first meridian channel.The rush of Genesis Qi towards the sealed first channel caused intense pain to emerge, resulting in a m.u.f.fled groan from Zhou Yuan.However, he fiercely gritted his teeth, enduring the intense pain as he controlled waves of Genesis Qi and continually attacked the sealed first meridian channel.Genesis Qi surged towards the first meridian channel in waves. This lasted for half an incense stick of time before it finally ended due to the exhaustion of Genesis Qi.Zhou Yuan's face was covered in sweat, but his eyes were filled with surprise as he said, \"What a formidable technique.\"Although he had never learnt any other Qi drawing methods, he knew that the higher the quality of a Qi drawing method, the more abundant and powerful the Genesis Qi drawn into the body. According to his knowledge, the Genesis Qi gathered by the 'Yuan Strengthening Method' in their royal treasury could only last for half a finger-sized incense stick of time before being completely used up.On the other hand, the Genesis Qi from the Dragon Breathing from before had lasted half a regular incense stick of time. This was almost ten times more than the Yuan Strengthening Method.Although it was true that the Nine Beast Soup and Mysterious Crystal Rice had played a part, this result was enough to show how powerful the Dragon Breathing method was.\"You are only at the elementary stage of the Dragon Breathing method. If you become highly proficient, you will no longer need the aid of the frolicking dragon forms. When that time comes, you will have already become capable of doing it on instinct. Even if you do not activate Dragon Breathing, you will be able to use Dragon Breathing to take in the Genesis Qi of the land at any time.\" Yaoyao's airy voice sounded from the side.Zhou Yuan was emotionally moved. To transform ordinary breathing into dragon breathing and endlessly take in Genesis Qi. Given this effectiveness, just how crazy would that be?\"I managed to unblock a tiny portion of my first meridian when I attacked my meridian channels for the first time earlier. At this rate, I will completely open my first meridian channel in less than a month.\" Zhou Yuan's fists were tightly clenched while his heart seemed to surge.This efficiency was thanks to the Dragon Breathing. Of course, the Nine Beast Soup and Mysterious Crystal Rice also contributed a little.\"Time to continue training!\"After some rest, Zhou Yuan intended to begin practicing the frolicking dragon forms once again but was stopped by Yaoyao. The latter's eyes scanned him once as she said in a cool voice, \"You're really out of your mind. Attacking one's channels will damage them, thus most people only attempt it once a day. They must wait till their channels recover on the second day before continuing to unblock the channels. If not, they will end up injuring the meridian channels.\"Zhou Yuan was stunned. It was not that he was unaware of this but\u2026 He felt the first meridian channel inside his body and hesitated for a moment before he said, \"But I feel that my meridian channel can still take it.\"Now it was Yaoyao's turn to be stunned. Her watery eyes stared at Zhou Yuan in doubt as she said, \"Is that true?\"Zhou Yuan earnestly nodded.Upon seeing this, Yaoyao pondered a little before she said, \"Could it be because you are someone born with naturally open meridian channels. It is possible that although they were sealed up again, your meridian channels are still much st.u.r.dier than an ordinary beginner.\"Then try again.\"Yaoyao placed her hands behind her back. With her clothes wrapped around her lovely figure, this posture of hers propped up her chest slightly, revealing a very enticing sight. However, Zhou Yuan did not dare to continue looking because Yaoyao's bright eyes were currently staring at him.\"I do want to see exactly how many times you will be able to attack your meridian channel.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14 SpiriPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayUnder the attention of Yaoyao's bright eyes, Zhou Yuan's body started to move once again as the ninety eight forms of the frolicking dragon were unhurriedly performed. It was done in a much more experienced manner this time, and felt a little more natural with his now coordinated breathing.Roar!As the final action was done, Zhou Yuan once again opened his mouth as a faint dragon roar echoed from within his body. His body immediately jerked while Genesis Qi converged towards him, transforming into a white stream that was swallowed by Zhou Yuan with a single gulp.Rumble!As Genesis Qi entered, his body felt like a burning stove. With a thought from Zhou Yuan, the Genesis Qi once again began to surge towards the first meridian channel in waves.This lasted for another half an incense stick of time.Zhou Yuan's body glowed with red light as a wave of heat evaporated his sweat. He could feel the slightly more loosened first meridian channel and a smile emerged from the corners of his lips. After some rest, he started to do the ninety eight forms of the frolicking dragon again under Yaoyao's watching eyes.In the following period of time, two faint dragon roars sounded in succession. This meant that Zhou Yuan had attacked his channels twice more.In addition to the previous two times, the total number had reached four!Four sets of meridian channel unblocking!An ordinary pract.i.tioner that had yet to open his first meridian channel could only attempt to unblock his meridian channels once a day before it would become somewhat unbearable to continue. Yet, Zhou Yuan had done it four times. Just how tough were these meridian channels of his?As she stood by the side, ripples finally emerged in Yaoyao's eyes.However, Zhou Yuan was currently in no mood to pay any attention to Yaoyao's expression. His burning body was seated on the floor and he could feel a faint piercing pain pulsing from the meridian channels in his body. This showed that his meridian channels were about to reach their limits after four sets.A smile involuntarily formed on his lips as he felt his first meridian channel. The originally sealed channel had clearly loosened even more after the fourth set.\"At this rate, I might not even need a month. In ten days, I will be able to completely unblock my first meridian channel!\"Even with his mental fort.i.tude, Zhou Yuan could not help but become rather emotional when he thought of this. Cang Yuan had said back then that opening his chanels again would be even more difficult than normal, so he had been prepared to wait several months before opening his first channel. Yet who could have expected that the toughness of his meridian channels and the might of the Dragon Breathing technique would shorten this time to such an extent.Back then, Su Youwei had used a month to open her first meridian channel, an achievement that made her the fastest channel opener in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute.Just imagine what level his pace of ten day would be.Of course, Zhou Yuan understood that Su Youwei's achievement was solidly based on her own talent and hardwork. After all, she had neither a high cla.s.s Qi drawing method, Nine Beast Soup nor Mysterious Crystal Rice.Hence, it was really difficult to say who was better.However, one point was certain. Due to the fact that it was his second time opening his meridian channels, Zhou Yuan would be surely be more powerful than Su Youwei when she had opened her first meridian channel. As for how much stronger, he could only test it when the time came.\"Looks like even grandpa Hei has underestimated a second-time channel opener like you.\" Yaoyao's airy voice was tinged with a sliver of shock.Zhou Yuan chuckled. \"Someone as pitiful as myself is probably quite rare.\"Yaoyao nodded in acknowledgement when she heard this as a faint smile started to show it self on her face. \"That is true. Born with naturally open meridian channels yet having them sealed later on. Such a situation is indeed very rare.\"\"Ch ch.\" On the ground, Tuntun pointed at Zhou Yuan with mockery in its eyes.Having been mocked by a little creature, Zhou Yuan grinded his teeth, grabbed a stone and threw it at Tuntun.Ao!However, Tuntun ate the stone in a single gulp before giving a provocative and menacing look to Zhou Yuan.Zhou Yuan laughed. His eyes seemed to turn in thought as he fished out a piece of dried meat from his clothes. It was Genesis Beast meat that had been roasted with the utmost care and was used to recover his energy.Tuntun's eyes were immediately glued to the piece of dried meat the moment it appeared. Its pink tongue peeked out while saliva dripped from the tip.\"Hehe.\" Zhou Yuan evilly chuckled as he stuffed the meat in his mouth and started chewing. *Little b.a.s.t.a.r.d, you dare to fight me.*Ao ao!Tuntun was infuriated upon seeing this and released a few barks.While Yaoyao watched Zhou Yuan tease Tuntun, she suddenly said, \"If it really becomes angry, it will even eat a human. Do you plan on seeing what the inside of its stomach looks like? I for one have never seen anything come out alive from Tuntun's stomach.\"Zhou Yuan's chewing mouth suddenly froze. He carefully observed the now erect-tailed Tuntun that was glaring at him before looking at Yaoyao with a forced smile. \"You will stop it, right?\"Yaoyao's red lips curved slightly as she seemingly smiled and replied, \"Perhaps.\"\"You're good!\" Zhou Yuan gritted his teeth and immediately took out all of the Genesis Beast dried meat he had on him. With a smile plastered across his face, he offered them to Tuntun and said, \"Come on, feel free to eat till you're full!\"Tuntun instantly pounced towards Zhou Yuan. It pulled all of the meat into its mouth with a single swipe of its tongue and started chewing furiously. However, it looked as if it was very satisfied with the taste as its tail was happily wagging from side to side.After devouring the dried meat, Tuntun seemed to find Zhou Yuan a little more pleasing to the eye. It stood up and lightly patted Zhou Yuan's shoulder with a paw, as if saying 'you've done a good job'...Zhou Yuan's mouth twitched a little. This little b.a.s.t.a.r.d was practically human.\"Big sis Yaoyao, exactly what rank Genesis Beast is Tuntun?\" Zhou Yuan looked towards Yaoyao and asked in curiosity. He had never seen such an intelligent Genesis Beast.The origins of this seemingly little-dog-like Tuntun were surely extraordinary.Yaoyao seemed to mull about it for a while, before ultimately shaking her head. \"I too do not know. Tuntun has been at my side ever since I can remember. However, grandpa Hei has said before that if Tuntun fully matures, there will be practically nothing in this world that it cannot eat.\"Zhou Yuan inwardly wet his lips. To think that Cang Yuan had given such a high evaluation of Tuntun. Looks like this little b.a.s.t.a.r.d was really not simple at all...\"Big sis Yaoyao, master said before that you are pretty skilled in Genesis Runes?\" Zhou Yuan pushed Tuntun's paw away from his shoulder before looking up at Yaoayo with a smile.Yaoyao's long shapely eyebrows raised slightly as she replied, \"You want to learn Genesis Runes?\"\"I've always been learning Genesis Runes. After all, if I was really unable to open my meridian channels, that would have been my final hope.\" Zhou Yuan honestly confessed.Yaoyao bent down slightly as her slender fingers picked up Tuntun. She held it in her arms and she gently stroked its fur while the now slightly arched Tuntun comfortably lay on her satin-like skin. This sight made the corners of Zhou Yuan's eyes twitch as he secretly cursedthe little b.a.s.t.a.r.d's luck.Yaoyao lightly stepped forward, walking in to the stone pavillion and elegantly seating herself on a stone stool. She propped up her cheek with a hand as she languidly looked at Zhou Yuan and said, \"It is too tiring to teach. I don't feel like it.\"Zhou Yuan also sat himself on another stone stool and quoted his offer. \"Although the Jadeite Brew is a fine liquor, there are plenty of things that are better than it. I will help you find them.\"A beautiful smile emerged on Yaoyao's small face when she heard this. The brilliance of that moment made even the hundreds of flowers in the flower park lose their color, while also causing Zhou Yuan's heart to beat a little faster.She faintly smiled and said, \"So understanding.\"Zhou Yuan also smiled. Soon after, he said, \"But you may still only drink a bottle a day.\"Yaoyao's smile was withdrawn as she scowled at him.However, Zhou Yuan did not concede. After all, interest was interest and should not be without control. Cang Yuan had mentioned that Yaoyao was unable to utilise Genesis Qi. Thus too much excessive drinking would harm her body.Yaoyao could only grind her teeth when she saw that Zhou Yuan was unwilling yield, but she could ultimately only give him a vicious glare.\"Since you've studied Genesis Runes before, you should naturally understand what is most important, right?\" Yaoyao put out the embers of rage in her heart as she spoke in a flat voice.\"The spirit.\" Replied Zhou Yuan.Yaoyao nodded as she slowly said, \"Then do you know of how the different levels of Spirit are cla.s.sified?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 Primal Chaos Divine Grindstone Visualisation MethodPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"There are four levels to the Spirit, The Illusory stage, the Corporeal stage, the Transformation stage and the G.o.droamer.\"\"Only those who possess powerful Spirits will be able to draw high tier Genesis Runes. Your Spirit talent is not bad, but it is not even at the Illusory stage.\" A young girl's airy voice echoed in the stone pavilion. Sunlight sprinkled down on her fair and pretty face, making her appear exceptionally attractive.\"The Spirit is originally formless and only by continuously tempering it will one by able to allow the formless Spirit to gain a form. This first stage with a form is called the illusory form, also known as the Illusory stage.\"\"There are two ways to strengthen the Spirit. One is to wait for one's strength to rise and the Spirit will follow suit and strengthen as well. However, this method is rather slow and there is an upper limit to how strong the Spirit will grow. The second way is to practice a Spirit tempering method. However, there are such techniques are very rare in this world and only a couple of the powerful factions possess them.\"At this point, Yaoyao glanced at Zhou Yuan before continuing, \"The 'Primal Chaos G.o.dly Polis.h.i.+ng Visualisation Method' that grandpa Hei imparted to you is an extremely high grade Spirit tempering method. However, great courage to conquer great terror is needed to practice this method, something that you will eventually come to know when you practice it.\"\"Given the current level of your Spirit, you will not be able to draw grade 1 Genesis Runes. I advise you to start early on your practice of the 'Primal Chaos G.o.dly Polis.h.i.+ng Visualisation Method' and raise the level of your Spirit to the Illusory stage. When your Spirit steps into the Illusory stage, I will teach you grade 1 Genesis Runes.\"Zhou Yuan nodded. He had long intended to try out the Primal Chaos G.o.dly Polis.h.i.+ng Visualisation Method. After taking a deep breath, he sat down cross-legged on the stone stool and slowly closed his eyes.Darkness descended as Zhou Yuan's heartbeat gradually slowed, allowing his mind to enter a state of absolute calm.Dong! Dong!The chirping and wind from the outside world stealthily faded. Only the sound of a beating heart echoed in the darkness.Within the darkness, Zhou Yuan urged his Spirit to sense the brand that had been pa.s.sed to him by Cang Yuan, the brand that contained the 'Primal Chaos G.o.dly Polis.h.i.+ng Visualisation Method'.As Zhou Yuan continued to reach out, a slowly spinning glimmer of light suddenly appeared within the darkness. Its depths was immeasurable, as if it hid something terrifying.However, while Zhou Yuan's Spirit was hesitating, a powerful suction force suddenly exploded from the glimmer of light and sucked Zhou Yuan's Spirit inside.A momentarily wave of dizziness washed over Zhou Yuan as he felt his surroundings begin to change. Darkness receded as a formless void took its place. The primal chaos here had devoured time, s.p.a.ce and everything else, making it appear as if time had gone back to the place before everything had started.Zhou Yuan's formless Spirit stood within this vast nothingness as a feeling of insignificance overwhelmed him.Rumble!While Zhou Yuan's Spirit gazed upon this endless expanse of primal chaos, a loud sound suddenly resounded from within it. Zhou Yuan's Spirit looked towards the sound and a split second later, a shuddering-like feeling madly surged over, causing his Spirit to s.h.i.+ver uncontrollably.It was because he had seen an incomparably colossal shadow slowly appear. The shadow was akin to a black hole that endlessly devoured everything.However, it was not a black hole but a giant grindstone that seemed without end.The giant grindstone was mottled and covered all over by the scars of time. The dark splotches decorating it looked as if they were the remnant traces of the blood of pulverised G.o.ds and devils.Rumble!The giant grindstone loomed within the void as it slowly rotated. It could grind anything downinto nothingness.Zhou Yuan's Spirit stood before the giant grindstone like an insignificant grain of sand. It was at this very moment that a mysterious piece of information flowed into his mind.It was the cultivation instructions for the 'Primal Chaos Divine Grindstone Visualisation Method'.\"The divine grindstone was born within the primal chaos, a single turn capable of annihilating G.o.ds and devils\u2026\"\"Visualise the divine grindstone and feel it grind with the Spirit as your anchor\u2026\"\"Nine rotations, every rotation a new realm\u2026\"Zhou Yuan's Spirit faintly trembled. It was at this very moment that he finally understood why Yaoyao had said that the will to overcome great terror was needed to learn the 'Primal Chaos G.o.dly Polis.h.i.+ng Visualisation Method'. Uncontrollable terror would swallow the Spirit of anyone who stood in an endless expanse before the world-destroying divine grindstone...Zhou Yuan's Spirit shook as he stared at the divine grindstone within the primal chaos. Just standing here required a great amount of courage. Let alone the fact that one needed to cast one's Spirit onto the grindstone and be grinded by it...If Zhou Yuan did not have such great mental fort.i.tude, he would have long turned around and run for his life.\"If I die then so be it!\"Amidst his endless trembling, Zhou Yuan was ultimately able to maintain a sliver of rationality. He fiercely gritted his teeth and drifted towards the divine grindstone, directly landing upon its infinite ma.s.s.Boom!The instant Zhou Yuan's Spirit landed on the t.i.tanic grindstone, he could only watch helplessly as a shadow loomed towards him. Terror and pain swiftly exploded from his Spirit.In the short span of several breaths, Zhou Yuan's Spirit turned into nothingness under the grinding of the divine grindstone.Something faintly trembled within the primal chaos as an invisible ripple converged to a single spot. It was Zhou Yuan's Spirit. If a Spirit had a face, Zhou Yuan's would be deathly pale, eyes overflowing with terror.In that very moment from before, the feeling of being destroyed was just too real.Yet although he had been scared witless, between being pulverised into nothingness and the subsequent reconstruction had seemed to make his Spirit become an eensy bit more coporeal.\"What an insane Spirit tempering method!\"Zhou Yuan's heart shuddered. Anyone with a little less mettle would have long been destroyed by fear. Once fear of the divine grindstone left its mark in one's heart, Cang Yuan's primal chaos divine grindstone brand would fade and the 'Primal Chaos Divine Grindstone Visualisation Method' would fail.\"This Primal Chaos Divine Grindstone Visualisation Method is to continuously cast one's Spirit onto the divine grindstone. Amidst the millions and millions of times of being obliterated into nothingness, the endless destruction and reconstruction will allow one to undergo a metamorphosis and grow stronger\u2026\"\"According to the instructions, there are nine rotations to this Primal Chaos Divine Grindstone Visualisation Method, and every rotation a new realm. This so-called nine rotations refer to the divine grindstone completing a full round nine times. As long as the Spirit is able to persevere till an entire round is complete, it will undergo a single transformation.\"Zhou Yuan looked towards the divine grindstone within the primal chaos. It was split into an upper layer and a lower layer, while a vertical faint dark-gold line could be seen joining these two layers as if it was a scale of sorts.As the divine grindstone rotated, the upper part of the golden line would move. When it once again returned to its original position and joined with the bottom part, an entire round would be completed.However, Zhou Yuan's Spirit had only managed to endure for several breaths before being destroyed. Looks like it would not be easy to persist till an entire rotation was complete.\"The Primal Chaos Divine Grindstone Visualisation Method is indeed extraordinary, a single attempt has made my Spirit a tiny bit stronger. As expected of the Spirit tempering method big sis Yaoyao praised as one of the highest ranked.\"Zhou Yuan breathed in deeply in an effort to suppress the fear he had towards the primal chaos divine grindstone. With a clench of his teeth, his Spirit flew forward again and landed on the slowly rotating mottled divine grindstone.Boom!As the divine grindstone turned, Zhou Yuan's Spirit was once again pulverised into nothingness.An invisible ripple appeared and Zhou Yuan's Spirit reformed once more. His Spirit violently shuddered, but he was evidently still able to control his emotions. A long while later, he gritted his teeth again and cast himself towards the divine grindstone.Boom!In the vast expense of primal chaos, the divine grindstone turned again and again, completely obliterating the speck of dust that was cast into it over and over.Each time it was destroyed, the continuously reconstructed Spirit gradually started slowly turn from incomporeal to corporeal.The eighty eighth time.Zhou Yuan finally stopped after his Spirit was destroyed and reforged for the eighty eighth time. He could feel intense tiredness and pain gus.h.i.+ng out from within his Spirit.This allowed him to know that he had finally reached his limit today. If he forced himself any further, it would instead do more harm than good.Although his Spirit was exhausted, Zhou Yuan's heart was overflowing with happiness. After over eighty times of being destroyed, his originally formless Spirit had now taken on an illusory color.The Illusory stage!When the Spirit turned from formless to illusory, it meant that he had finally reached the Illusory stage!\"A down right awesome visualisation method.\" Zhou Yuan praised with a sigh. The very first training session had allowed his Spirit to reach the doorstep of the Illusory stage. Although he understood that this was partly because his Spirit's foundations were pretty solid, it was still enough for him to realise how extraordinary the visualisation method was.\"In the stone pavilion, Zhou Yuan's tightly shut eyes slowly opened. Although his face was as white as sheet, the excitement in his eyes could not be hidden.\"I've reached the Illusory stage!\"Yaoyao was a little taken aback by Zhou Yuan's words as she doubtfully asked, \"So fast? How many times did you endure the divine grindstone?\"\"Eighty eight times.\"Yaoyao's eyes narrowed a little as a peculiar look flashed within them. Ordinary people were only able to endure a dozen or so times on their first attempt. Yet Zhou Yuan had endured eighty eight times, a far from ordinary result.\"As expected of the one who once possessed the sacred dragon destiny. Compared to your wounded body, your Spirit does not seem to have suffered any damage.\" Yaoyao softly praised before continuing, \"Your Spirit is still too weak. When you recover, I will teach you a grade 1 Genesis Rune.\"She stood up carrying Tuntun as she glanced at the mottled black brush hanging at Zhou Yuan's waist. \"You need to properly nourish the Heavenly Yuan Brush given to you by grandpa Hei and light the first rune as quickly as possible.\"Zhou Yuan lowered his head and retrieved the Heavenly Yuan Brush hanging at his waist. It nimbly twirled in his hand as he smiled and nodded his head.Cang Yuan had said that Genesis Beast Spirits could be used to recover the Heavenly Yuan Brush's spirituality. This was not difficult for him. His status as the prince of Great Zhou allowed him to easily obtain several Genesis Beast Spirits.Zhou Yuan really looked forward to the transformation after lighting the first rune. After all, he was very interested to find out exactly how this foot-long Heavenly Yuan Brush would change for it to become a Genesis Weapon...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16 Digging at a Corner of the WallPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEarly morning the second day.After Zhou Yuan drank a bowl of Nine Beast Soup and ate a bowl of Mysterious Crystal Rice, he continued his practice of the ninety eight forms of the frolicking dragon, absorbing Genesis Qi to attack and unblock his meridian channels.A good part of the afternoon was spent on another four waves of attacks on the meridian channels. Although Zhou Yuan's channels ached and he dripped with sweat, he could feel his first meridian channel loosening more and more, causing unconcealable excitement and antic.i.p.ation to fill his heart.A servant girl offered a towel from the side and waited till Zhou Yuan wiped clean his sweat before respectfully saying, \"Your highness, the items you wanted have already arrived.\"\"Oh?\"Zhou Yuan was overjoyed when he heard this and swiftly walked into the room. Sure enough, he saw a jade plate on the table where a dozen crystals of varying colors and l.u.s.ters were neatly arranged.On closer inspection, one would discover faint silhouettes within the crystals. These silhouettes were shaped like various beasts and emitted a strange light.These were Beast Spirit Crystals. After the death of a Genesis Beast, its beast spirit would be condensed into a crystal form as a form of protection.Evidently, Zhou Yuan wanted these Beast Spirit Crystals to nourish the Heavenly Yuan Brush.\"All grade 1 Beast Spirit Crystals.\" With a glance, Zhou Yuan saw that these Beast Spirit Crystals came from grade 1 Genesis Beasts. This was rather appropriate. It was likely that given the current state of the Heavenly Yuan Brush, it would not be able to deal with too highly ranked Beast Spirit Crystals.Zhou Yuan retrieved the Heavenly Yuan Brush at his waist and stroked it with his hand. The mottled body of the brush felt rather rough while the hairs at its tip appeared slightly dull. The mysterious and ancient runes were the only evidence that this Heavenly Yuan Brush was once extraordinary.Zhou Yuan fetched a small metal hammer and used it to strike one of the Beast Spirit Crystals, creating a small hole. Subsequently, he placed the head of the Heavenly Yuan Brush into the hole.The Heavenly Yuan Brush vibrated the moment it touched the beast spirit within the Beast Spirit Crystal. Subsequently, the hairs at the tip of the brush reached out and swept up the beast spirit. With a sucking sound, the beast spirit disappeared into the Heavenly Yuan Brush.As the beast spirit disappeared, a faint glow emerged from the Heavenly Yuan Brush. The first ancient rune on its body seemed to have become a little brighter.\"It is indeed effective.\"Zhou Yuan was pleased. Using the same method, he broke each Beast Spirit Crystal before using the Heavenly Yuan Brush to suck out the beast spirit inside.One by one, the beast spirits were absorbed by the Heavenly Yuan Brush and its glow grewincreasingly bright. In addition, the first ancient rune also began to give off a faint radiance.However, the Heavenly Yuan Brush suddenly stopped after it absorbed the eighth beast spirit. It no longer emitted a suction force no matter how Zhou Yuan fiddled with it, while its light also gradually receded.\"It's\u2026 full?\" Zhou Yuan was stunned. He finally understood and let out a laugh due to annoyance. This blasted Heavenly Yuan Brush. He had allowed it to absorb beast spirits to regain its spirituality and yet it wilfully decided against overeating?!However, the Heavenly Yuan Brush was stubborn and refused to eat after it was full. There was nothing Zhou Yuan could do. He did not know whether to laugh or to cry as he kept the brush and prepared to continue nouris.h.i.+ng it the next day.If this was the situation, some time would be needed to light up the first rune.However, Zhou Yuan was not too anxious. After placing the Heavenly Yuan Brush back on his hip, he walked out of the room. He planned to visit the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute today. Although he believed that Su Youwei would not be enticed to Qi Yue's side, Zhou Yuan needed to to be vigilant so as to ensure that Qi Yue would not secretly cause trouble for her.\u2026The Great Zhou Inst.i.tute.Zhou Yuan did not see Su Youwei after a stroll around the campus. Only after asking did he find out that she was working in the library.The library of the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute used to be considerably deserted. However, ever since Su Youwei started to work part-time there, it had become one of the popular spots in the inst.i.tute. People would slip over from time to time and feign borrowing books with the hopes of getting closer to Su Youwei.Zhou Yuan did not see Su Youwei at the front desk when he walked into the library. Hence, he took a trip around the place and paused before a large bookshelf.A slim girl was standing on a tall stool, tidying the bookshelf as she very carefully wiped away the dust.At this moment, a ray of sunlight shot in from outside the window. Dust danced within the light, while the girl's pretty face seemed to sparkle. Her long lashes gently fluttered as her small raised mouth softy hummed a little tune, a scene filled with youthful vigour.*Cough*.Zhou Yuan's soft cough heartlessly broke the beautiful scene.Su Youwei seemed come back to reality as she hastily lowered her head. Joy immediately surged onto her pretty face when she saw Zhou Yuan.Zhou Yuan walked under the tall stool and lifted his head, only to be stunned. It was because the bottom half of the uniform Su Youwei wore was a skirt, resulting in two long and slender white legs being imprinted in his eyes. They were as glossy as jade and made one have the urge to cop a feel.\"Your highness!\"Su Youwei immediately blushed when she felt Zhou Yuan's gaze and cried out in an embarra.s.sed and angry manner. The thick book in her hand was jolted, causing a layer of dust to fall and obstruct Zhou Yuan's gaze.\"Waa, I'm blind.\" Zhou Yuan hurriedly took advantage of this turn of events to cover his eyes.Su Youwei gracefully hopped off the tall stool and placed the book back on the bookshelf. Her face was red as she rolled her eyes at the acting Zhou Yuan and spit out, \"Low-cla.s.s.\"Zhou Yuan opened his eyes and helplessly replied, \"It was an accident.\"Su Youwei softly snorted. \"Why has the care-free and unambitious prince come here?\"\"Heh heh, if I did not come, I'm afraid that my little Weiwei would be kidnapped by someone.\" Zhou Yuan chuckled.\"Eeih, so sickening! Don't address me in such a way!\"Su Youwei's pretty face was red as she resentfully glared at Zhou Yuan. Her little mouth stuck out slightly as she said in a somewhat distressed manner, \"You also know of this huh? That Qi Yue has approached me quite a few times. So annoying.\"\"He request that you enter the B cla.s.s after the newcomer exam?\" Zhou Yuan's eyes narrowed. This Qi Yue was indeed determined, to think that he would dare to dig at the corners of Zhou Yuan's wall!Su Youwei nodded. She did not thoroughly understand the struggle for the position of headmaster, but she knew that Zhou Yuan and Qi Yue did not get along. Hence, she made excuses whenever Qi Yue tried to win her over to his side.\"What did he offer?\"Su Youwei rolled her eyes at Zhou Yuan again. His words were unpleasant to the ear, but she knew that that was not what he meant. Hence, she replied, \"Let's not mention the wealth and power he guaranteed, he even promised to give me a tier 3 Genesis Qi technique after I reach the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage.\"\"So generous huh.\" Zhou Yuan was somewhat amazed. A tier 3 Genesis Qi technique. The highest tier Genesis Qi technique in their royal treasury was only tier 4.\"However, I still rejected his offer.\" Water glimmered in Su Youwei's eyes as she continued in a low voice, \"He was not too happy and asked what you gave me.\"\"I told him that his highness did not give me anything. He merely helped me kick open a door.\"Her voice became softer and softer towards the end, but it still made Zhou Yuan chuckle bitterly. It had been pure chance that he had pa.s.sed by and seen a little girl braving the torrential rain as she kneeled and begged before a clinic. He had only kicked open the tightly shut doors of the clinic due to a sudden surge of anger at this injustice.How could he know that his unintentional actions from back then would be deeply carved by Su Youwei onto her heart.Zhou Yuan said, \"That fellow Qi Yue probably almost died from anger.\"\"Well that has nothing to do with me.\" Su Youwei covered her mouth as she softly chuckled.Zhou Yuan nodded but secretly thought to himself that he should also prepare a decent technique for Su Youwei after she reached the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage. Else her talent would really be wasted.\"How has your channel opening been going recently?\" Asked Zhou Yuan.Su Youwei casually replied, \"Not bad, unblocking the fourth meridian channel before the newcomer exam should not be difficult.\"Zhou Yuan clicked his tongue in praise. Su Youwei's talent was indeed outstanding. If she was under the same conditions as himself; drinking Nine Beast Soup and eating Mysterious Crystal Rice daily, it was likely that even Qi Yue would not be able to compare to her.However, Zhou Yuan did not dare to mention giving Nine Beast Soup and Mysterious Crystal Rice to Su Youwei. This la.s.s was not only very sharp but also extremely stubborn. She definitely would not accept such help from Zhou Yuan.Zhou Yuan looked towards Su Youwei and said, \"Headmaster Chu told me earlier that I must make sure that you enter the A cla.s.s.\"Su Youwei thought for a moment before she smiled and said, \"You can tell him that I will enter the A cla.s.s if you are also allowed to enter.\"Although she had spoken in an off-handed manner, there was some worry in her eyes. The requirement for entering the A cla.s.s was placing top ten in the newcomer exam, and Zhou Yuan had not even unblocked a single meridian channel. It was obviously an uphill task for him to achieve such results with just his elementary level Genesis Runes.According to what she knew, headmaster Chu was a person that felt strongly about the rules. If Zhou Yuan was unable to take any of the top ten spots, headmaster Chu might not give the former face even if he was the prince.How could Zhou Yuan not know her thoughts. He was a little touched as he looked at her and smiled, \"Don't worry about me. I will surely enter the A cla.s.s.\"When Su Youwei saw how serious Zhou Yuan was, there was really nothing much to say. She could only nod her head.The two happily chatted as they walked out away from the bookshelf. Just as they reached a turn, a figure suddenly appeared before them.It was a rather tall young man who was also rather handsome. His expression changed a little when he saw Zhou Yuan and Su Youwei walk out together, but he quickly revealed a polite smile, \"Your highness.\"Subsequently, his gaze turned towards Su Youwei as his eyes became much gentler. \"Youwei, are you finished with your work? Are you free today? May I ask you out for a meal?\"Zhou Yuan's eyes slightly narrowed as he watched this handsome young man. He had recognized the latter.Lin Feng, another influential figure amongst the new batch of students. He was rumoured to be the most promising individual in the newcomer exam.But according to what Zhou Yuan knew, this fellow had already been pulled over to Qi Yue's side.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17 Lin FengPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhile Zhou Yuan's eyes narrowed slightly, Su Youwei also eyed the confident and relaxed young man before them. Her long and shapely eyebrows slightly knitted together before she displayed a smile and said, \"So it is young master Lin. However, I'm afraid that I do not have time today.\"Lin Feng was not the least bit dejected by So Youwei's gentle rejection. Instead, he grinned as he nodded. \"Since that is so, maybe next time.\"He did not stubbornly insist but instead appeared rather polite.However, it was this very att.i.tude that made So Youwei helplessly sigh in her heart. Such individuals were the most difficult to deal with.Zhou Yuan did not say anything and merely smiled faintly at Lin Feng before walking away with Su Youwei.Lin Feng watched the two departing figures as his kind face turned somewhat darker.\"Hehe, looks like you do not have much of a chance.\" A soft chuckle was suddenly heard from behind. Lin Feng turned his head only to find Qi Yue wearing white clothes.\"Little prince.\" Lin Feng controlled his expression and bowed slightly.Qi Yue seemed to smile as he stood beside Lin Feng and he looked in the direction that Zhou Yuan and Su Youwei had left in. \"Although our prince is unable to start channel opening cultivation, he still has his status. Moreover, Su Youwei owes a debt of grat.i.tude towards him. I'm afraid that you don't really have much of a chance.\"Lin Feng's eyes were somewhat dark while his lips were tightly pursed. It was clear that he was extremely unresigned.\"You've really fallen for Su Youwei?\" Qi Yue could not help but smile and ask when he saw Lin Feng's appearance.\"Su Youwei might be a mere commoner but she has qualifications to change everything. She will surely separate herself from the ordinary and become the focus of everyone's attention in future.\" Lin Feng explained.Qi Yue nodded and sighed. \"That is true. It is only a matter of time given her talent. Prince Zhou Yuan is really lucky, to think that any random person he picked up would become a genius.\"Lin Feng's expression grew increasingly pa.s.sionate as he slowly said, \"Even more so why I will not give up.\"Qi Yue grinned a little. \"Honestly speaking, you are not weaker than his highness. The only thing he has over you is his status as prince. Without it, he will not even have the qualifications of receiving a second glance from you.\"Lin Feng did not reply, but a sliver of pride appeared in his eyes. From his point of view, if Zhou Yuan was not the prince of Great Zhou, someone like him who was unable to open his meridian channels truly would not even enter Lin Feng's eyes.\"I do hope that you will be able to obtain Su Youwei. If that happens, there will be one less huge inconvenience for me.\" Qi Yue chuckled as he continued, \"I went looking for her previously and made many offers, but was still unable to convince her to enter the B cla.s.s after the newcomer exam. From the looks of it, she is really committed to his highness Zhou Yuan.\"Lin Feng's expression became a little uglier.\"However, I do have an idea.\" Qi Yue paused for moment. \"There is still one more month till the newcomer exam and Zhou Yuan is also partic.i.p.ating. If he fails miserably, it will be a rather substantial blow to someone of his status.\"Lin Feng's eyes flickered. Cultivation was mainstream in Great Zhou and it was a nation established on martial prowess. Even if Zhou Yuan was prince, if he did not produce any results, people would surely start talking. At that time, Su Youwei should be able to clearly see that a crippled prince could not be relied upon.\"What are little prince's intentions?\"Qi Yue faintly smiled as he said, \"I will pull some strings during the exam and ensure that Zhou Yuan b.u.mps into you. When that happens, you should know what to do to dim his princely halo.\"Lin Feng was somewhat hesitant after hearing this. \"But he is after all the prince, if we go too far\u2026\"\"In a match, fists and legs have no eyes. No one will say anything.\" Qi Yue shook he head before continuing, \"Since your Lin clan is already standing on the side of my Qi Manor, we will protect you even if something happens.\"Lin Feng's eyes flickered. A short while later, he fiercely gritted his teeth and replied in a low voice, \"Alright, I understand. If I meet him in the newcomer exam, I will make sure that his highness will lose in the most humiliating fas.h.i.+on.\"A venomous look flashed across his eyes as he lifted his head and looked at Zhou Yuan's departing figure. Since a crippled prince wanted to s.n.a.t.c.h away his woman, he could only make sure that this prince suffered when the time came.Qi Yue laughed softly. If Zhou Yuan was beaten into the mud, Qi Yue would go look for Su Youwei again. This girl should be able to tell who was the stronger one. As long as she cast her lot in with the B cla.s.s, there would no longer be anyone who could threaten him in the cla.s.s ranking exam and the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute would fall into the hands of Qi Manor.Henceforth, the students that graduated from the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute would be branded by Qi Manor. When that happened, it would be time for the ruler of the Great Zhou Empire to change.\u2026\"I'm afraid that Lin Feng is already working together with Qi Yue.\" Zhou Yuan conversed with Su Youwei as they walked along the corridors of the inst.i.tute. \"This might even be Qi Yue's scheme. Since he is unable to openly draw you to his side, he decided to use a handsome man to entice you.\"Su Youwei unhappily shook her head upon hearing this. \"Don't worry your highness, this tactic is useless against me.\"She paused for a moment before asking in a somewhat worried manner, \"However your highness needs to be more careful. Most of the talented individuals amongst the new batch of students have been pulled over by Qi Yue to his side. I worry that they will hinder you during the newcomer exam.\"Given Zhou Yuan's strength, it was already very challenging to take one of the top ten spots in the newcomer exam. If others were to hinder him, it would become even harder.Zhou Yuan grinned and said, \"Don't worry, I have my own plans.\"He gently spat out a breath of air before slowly speaking again, \"Qi Manor's foundations are truly solid.\"Qi Yue's offers were difficult to reject. Such wealth was no less than the royal clan. Looks like father was right, the Great Wu was likely backing the Qi Manor.At this point, a cold light flashed across Zhou Yuan's eyes. Qi Manor was truly a tumor of the Great Zhou.To think that they now even planned to dip their fingers into the pie that was the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute. Moreover, it was easy to imagine how great a blow it would be if the inst.i.tute fell into Qi Manor's control. Thus\u2026 Zhou Yuan absolutely could not let them succeed.Of course, the most important thing now was to quickly open his meridian channels to face the upcoming newcomer exam.\u2026In the following few days, Zhou Yuan stayed in the royal palace. He diligently practiced the ninety eight forms of the frolicking dragon in the early morning and did four waves of attacks on his meridian channels. At night, he practiced the 'Primal Chaos Divine Grindstone Visualisation Method' to train his spirit.Zhou Yuan's improvement over these few days was not small. The first meridian channel in his body grew increasingly loose and opening it completely was in sight. Moreover, his spirit had also stabilized at the initial Illusory stage.This progress made Zhou Yuan very excited and put in even more effort into his training.Another day.Ding!The small hammer in Zhou Yuan's hand struck and broke open a hole in a Beast Spirit Crystal. He placed the Heavenly Yuan Brush inside and the beast spirit within the crystal was absorb with a sweep of its hairs.Buzz!Just as Zhou Yuan was preparing to break open a hole in the next Beast Spirit Crystal, a faint buzzing noise was suddenly emitted from the Heavenly Yuan Brush. At the same time, a strange light slowly emerged from the brush body.Zhou Yuan was first stunned by this scene before joy broke out on his face.It was because he had seen the first ancient rune on the Heavenly Yuan Brush completely light up at this moment and give off a mysterious glow.Evidently, after several days of nouris.h.i.+ng it, the brush had finally recovered some of its spirituality and power.\"Master and big sis Yaoyao said that I will come to know of its wonders once the first rune is lighted. I'm really interested to find out the peculiarities of this once Sacred Genesis Weapon Heavenly Yuan Brus.h.!.+\" Zhou Yuan's eyes lighted up as he stared at the Heavenly Yuan Brush in his hand.He had long been filled with curiosity towards the Heavenly Yuan Brush.While grasping the Heavenly Yuan Brush, Zhou Yuan's eyes slowly closed. Light blossomed on the brush as a cryptic message poured into his mind.\"First rune of the Heavenly Yuan Brush, Culture and Martial.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18 Culture and MartialPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Culture and Martial?\"Zhou Yuan's eyes flickered brightly after opening. At this very moment, he finally understood why Cang Yuan had said that the Heavenly Yuan Brush was both a Genesis Weapon and a Genesis Rune Brush.It was due to this rune known as 'Culture and Martial' that bestowed two different forms to the Heavenly Yuan Brush.\"Martial form!\"Brush in hand, a thought flashed in Zhou Yuan's mind as he softly called out.Buzz!Intense light exploded from the Heavenly Yuan Brush. Next, Zhou Yuan's eyes were filled with amazement as he watched the foot-long brush in his hand suddenly start to grow.In the short span of several breaths, a roughly five foot long thick black brush appeared in Zhou Yuan's hand. This black brush was almost as tall as Zhou Yuan and its mottled body faintly flickered in a glossy manner.In particular, the soft snow-white hairs that were originally at the tip of the brush were now tightly packed together and flickered with cold light. At a glance, it seemed like the sharp tip of a spear.\"It's pretty heavy!\"Zhou Yuan gazed upon the rather enormous black brush in his hands. It was not light and even caused his arms to sink a little.\"I should test its power.\"Zhou Yuan left the room and walked into a s.p.a.cious courtyard. With a thought, the Heavenly Yuan Brush shook slightly as the surrounding Genesis Qi rippled and poured into the brush.A Genesis Weapon was able to absorb Genesis Qi and release tremendous power.As Genesis Qi poured into it, the brush gradually started to glow. In particular, light seemed to lengthen and shorten indeterminately on the brush tip made from snow-white hairs as if it was a sharp tip of a spear.Zhou Yuan brandished the brush with both hands as if it was a heavy spear. He had never used such a strange weapon before and naturally appeared rather untrained. However, the force generated by the spear was not weak and was akin to a ferocious tiger as it swung about.Ch!The spear suddenly turned and ferociously thrust at a copper cauldron by the side. A clear and crisp sound was immediately heard. One would look over only to find that the tip of the brush had pierced the cauldron and exited from the opposite side.\"Not bad. It's sharp enough.\" Zhou Yuan's eyebrows raised slightly when he saw this. This level of sharpness would easily tear apart the body of a two channel pract.i.tioner.\"It should have barely reached the Normal mid tier Genesis Weapon level.\"Zhou Yuan was rather pleased with this outcome. If he continued to nourish it by allowing the Heavenly Yuan Brush to absorb beast spirits, it would likely reach the Black tier pretty soon.Zhou Yuan mumbled to himself, \"It really is somewhat surprising for a brush to become a weapon. Although it is a brush, it is similar to a spear. I should learn some spear techniques in future.\"His gaze now burned a little hotter as he stared at the Heavenly Yuan Brush. To think that the first rune had already caused such a transformation. Zhou Yuan wondered how formidable the brush would become when all nine ancient runes completely recovered.Zhou Yuan waved the martial form Genesis Rune Brush until he was satisfied before a thought flashed in his mind. \"Culture form!\"The tall as a human Heavenly Yuan Brush suddenly shrunk till it was a foot long and landed in Zhou Yuan's hand. The brush tip that was previously sharp enough to pierce metal also became soft, its brush hairs gently swaying back and forth.With a gently flick of his fingertips, the Heavenly Yuan Brush nimble spun a single time in his hand as light emerged from the soft tip of the brush.This form was called the Genesis Rune Brush and could be used to draw Genesis Runes.\"Such a magical Culture and Martial Genesis Rune.\" Zhou Yuan sighed in praise. Genesis Runes that were able to change the form of an object were certainly not ordinary. This 'Culture and Martial' rune was surely very high grade.\"Finally activated the first rune?\"While Zhou Yuan was excitedly changing between the two forms in the courtyard, a somewhat surprised voice was heard. Zhou Yuan raised his head and saw Yaoyao elegantly standing outside the courtyard, while a whimpering Tuntun closely followed at her feet.\"Yea, just a while ago.\" Zhou Yuan nodded. The Heavenly Yuan Brush turned into its culture form and landed in his hand as he somewhat eagerly said, \"Big sis Yaoyao, I now have a Genesis Rune Brush. When will you teach me Genesis Runes?\"Yaoyao's steps were light as she slowly walked over. She stood before Zhou Yuan as asnow-white hand was outstretched.The corners of Zhou Yuan's mouth turned downwards when he saw this. He had no choice but to instruct a servant girl to bring over a jade bottle. \"This is Red Tiger Liquor, an extremely strong alcohol that I stole from father's secret stash.\"Yaoyao received the jade bottle and tipped back her head slightly, revealing her slender swan-like neck, as she took a small sip. Her pretty face immediately flushed red as her eyes sparkled. \"Not bad, you did not skimp on me.\"One could tell that she was very satisfied with the liquor Zhou Yuan had found.Zhou Yuan breathed a sigh of relief when he saw this. Just as he was about to speak, he felt a tug a his clothes and lowered his head only to find Tuntun biting at his trousers, before it stuck out its tongue and extended a paw.\"You're the same as your owner!\"The corners of Zhou Yuan's eyes twitched as his cursed inside. However, he could only instruct a servant girl to bring over a plate of dried Genesis Beast meat and place it at his foot.Only then did Tuntun release Zhou Yuan, perfectly satisfied as it lay down and gobbled up each piece of meat with a single gulp, its eyes narrowing in pleasure as it enjoyed the delicious dried Genesis Beast meat.Zhou Yuan squatted and stroked Tuntun's soft fur as he gave it two forceful strokes. In response to this, Tuntun glanced at the former. It decided not to pay much attention to that disrespectful fellow on the grounds that he had brought it meat.\"Alright, I will teach you grade 1 Genesis Runes today.\"After a few mouthfuls of Red Tiger Liquor, Yaoyao nodded in contentment before walking into the stone pavilion. Jade tablets for Genesis Rune practice had already been placed on the stone table within.Yaoyao elegantly stood before the table and shot a glance at Zhou Yuan as she said, \"I'll first write while you watch.\"With a clench of her hand, a slender green Genesis Rune Brush appeared within it. This Genesis Rune Brush gave off a faint green glow and numerous runes of light seemed to flutter within the glow, making it appear extremely mystical.Zhou Yuan's heart was a little moved by this sight. This Genesis Rune Brush of Yaoyao's was obviously not ordinary.Yaoyao's pretty face immediately became serious as she held the brush. A distinct aura spread from her body as the brush tip gently landed on a jade tablet and began to move as she desired.Zhou Yuan stood by the side and watched Yaoyao's gently moving hand as he could not help but praise in his heart. \"Such a pretty hand.\"Yaoyao's small, slim and slender hand seemed to be suffused with jade light. It was so pretty that one would find impossible to s.h.i.+ft one's eyes away.However, Zhou Yuan did not dare to pay too much attention to it, and his gaze very quickly s.h.i.+fted to the jade tablet.Light immediate surfaced on the tablet the moment Yaoyao's final stroke was complete. A complicated rune seemed to have leapt onto the tablet as a tiger roar was faintly heard.Yaoyao explained in an unenthusiastic voice, \"This is known as the Tiger Roar Rune and is a grade 1 Genesis Rune. It can be inscribed on the throat and when activated, a tiger roar sound wave would erupt. If used at close-range, it may even stun the enemy.\"\"A sound wave type Genesis Rune?\" Zhou Yuan was a little taken aback. This type of Genesis Rune was rather rare and could save one's life or even turn the tides of the battle if used at the opportune moment.\"Take a closer look. How many strokes are there in this Genesis Rune?\" Said Yaoyao in a casual manner.When Zhou Yuan heard this, he understood that Yaoyao wanted to test his foundations in Genesis Runes. After all, no matter how high grade a Genesis Rune was, it was still made from the combination of various strokes. The ability to identify and recognize these strokes was the fundamentals of learning Genesis Runes.Zhou Yuan carefully observed the 'Tiger Roar Rune' on the jade tablet. A short period later, he slowly said, \"I can see four hundred and thirty seven strokes.\"Previously, when Zhou Yuan was studying elementary Genesis Runes, there would at most be approximately a hundred strokes. This grade 1 Genesis Rune had more than four times that amount.Yaoyao nodded and said, \"To be more precise, there are four hundred and forty eight strokes. However, the fact that you were able to see four hundred and thirty seven strokes is proof enough that your fundamentals are rather decent.\"\"In the following few days, you will practice copying this 'Tiger Roar Rune' and fully master this grade 1 Genesis Rune.\"A surge of eagerness surfaced in Zhou Yuan's eyes when he heard this. If he was able to learn this grade 1 Genesis Rune, his strength would be greatly boosted.Given how close the newcomer exam was, he needed to the strength of four channels to get into the top ten. Thus, he would take any chance he could to grow stronger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19 Channel OpeningPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTo fully master a Genesis Rune was not easy at all. This was because it was not simply drawing the rune. One needed to use one's spirit as ink for every Genesis stroke. At times, when the spirit was just the tiniest bit too strong when the brush landed, the Genesis stroke would be unable to withstand it and become defective.Moreover, a single defective stroke meant that the entire Genesis Rune would become a failed product.Hence, a tremendous amount of practice was needed to reach perfection and ultimately allow the Genesis Rune to form.Therefore, in the following days, besides practicing the ninety eight forms of the frolicking dragon and the Primal Chaos Divine Grindstone Visualisation Method, Zhou Yuan also took some time to practice the 'Tiger Roar Rune'.Meanwhile, Zhou Yuan also squeezed out some time to learn some basic spear techniques. This was for the sake of familiarizing himself with the Heavenly Yuan Brush as a weapon so as to avoid the scenario where he had zero fundamentals and no idea what to do when he wielded it.This arrangement allowed Zhou Yuan's time to be amply utilised. However, he knew that time was of the essence and diligently worked hard every day.Under his efforts, an important juncture swiftly approached.On this day, the practicing Zhou Yuan in the flower park was solemn-face while a trace of excitement and antic.i.p.ation leaked from his eyes. He could feel that the first meridian channel in his body growing looser and looser over the past few days. If nothing unexpected occurred, it was very possible for the channel to be completely opened today.\"This day has come at last.\"Zhou Yuan's fists were tightly clenched. He had dreamt of the day he would open his meridian channel for many years.Zhou Yuan took in a deep breath, allowing his emotions to calm down a little. Subsequently, his fists were raised and the ninety eight forms of the frolicking dragon were very naturally displayed.Roar!As the final form was completed, the Qi and blood in Zhou Yuan's body boiled and his skeleton vibrated. His back undulated up and down as a faint dragon roar emerged from within his body.Huu!Zhou Yuan sucked in and the surrounding Genesis Qi was immediately drawn towards him. It surged over, transforming into a white mist that was swallowed into his body with a single gulp.Once the Genesis Qi entered his body, Zhou Yuan directed it towards the final bit of blockage in the first meridian channel and ferociously attacked.Pop!The last bit of blockage did not pose much of an obstruction. A faint sound was heard as if an invisible membrane was broken.At the same time, Zhou Yuan could feel that the first meridian channel in his body was completely opened at this very moment!Zhou Yuan felt as if the surroundings had become very quiet. The Qi and blood in his body boiled with gurgling noises, while the first meridian channel seemed to have come alive, slowly squirming as it continuously devoured the Genesis Qi that poured into the body as if it had been starved.The meridian channel absorbed Genesis Qi and swiftly fed it to the flesh.Waves of piercing pain pulsed within Zhou Yuan's body, but he did not panic. Instead, ecstacy overflowed on his face.Along with the piercing pain, a feeling of transparency filled his body. His entire body seemed to grow lighter at this moment while a numbing sensation washed over his muscles, skeleton and skin.It was an indicator that his physical body was strengthening!This feeling lasted for a dozen minutes before Zhou Yuan's eyes slowly cracked open. He immediately smelled an odd odour from his body and lowered his head, only to find that his skin was covered in filth. It was the impurities that had been expelled from his body when it had been strengthened earlier.Zhou Yuan's eyes seemed to become much brighter at this moment while the world around him also grew much clearer.\"Is this channel opening?\" Zhou Yuan's five fingers slowly closed as he felt the increased power in his body, while his eyes filled with happiness.The scene he had yearned for even in his dreams had finally become reality.\"Go inform father and mother.\" Zhou Yuan entered a room to wash his body while instructing a nearby servant girl.By the time Zhou Yuan had cleaned himself and reemerged, he saw that Zhou Qing and Qin Yu were already waiting. Their faces were filled with both surprise and joy.\"Yuan'er, you've unblocked your first meridian channel?!\" Upon seeing Zhou Yuan emerge, Qin Yu quickly walked forward, emotions stirring on her gentle face.Zhou Qing also walked over, flames seemingly burning within his eyes as he looked at Zhou Yuan.Zhou Yuan's heart warmed when he saw the emotions on their faces as he nodded his head. With a thought, the first meridian channel in his body vibrated and a suction force was emitted. The surrounding Genesis Qi immediately flowed into Zhou Yuan's body through his pores, causing the surface of his skin to glow a little.\"Drawing Qi into the body. He has indeed opened his channel!\" Zhou Qing's eyes flickered brightly. Even he seemed to have lost some self-control at this very moment as he heartily laughed and said, \"Good, good. As expected of the sacred dragon of our Zhou clan. You've opened your first meridian channel in the short span of ten days. No one in Great Zhou has ever achieved such speed before!\"Qin Yu's eyes were red as she hugged Zhou Yuan and choked out between sobs, \"Yuan'er is able to cultivate. The outbreak of Dragon's Resentment Poison three years later will be suppressed!\"Zhou Yuan gently patted Qin Yu's back as he consoled with a smile, \"Don't worry mother, your child will definitely dispose of that Dragon's Resentment Poison.\"\"Come, Yuan'er. Let father see how strong your body has become.\" Zhou Qing beckoned to Zhou Yuan. Every time a channel was opened, the quality of the channel opener's body would improve, allowing it to far surpa.s.s an ordinary person's.Zhou Yuan eagerly nodded upon hearing this. Cang Yuan had said before that although opening his channels for the second time would be far more difficult than normal, it would also benefit him much more once they were opened.Now, he wanted to test exactly how much more beneficial it was.Zhou Qing casually stood on the spot and beckoned at Zhou Yuan. The former's seemingly careless posture and position rippled with a presence that made Zhou Yuan's breathing stifle slightly.\"Father is indeed worthy having broken through the Heaven Gate and reaching the Alpha-Origin stage.\"For Genesis Masters, channel opening was the beginning. After all eight meridian channels were unblocked, the Qi Dwelling could be opened, allowing one to advance to the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage. At the perfect Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage, Qi could be used to attack the Heaven Gate, and once broken, Genesis Qi will be able to leave the body to move mountains and overturn the seas. A power that was unmeasurable.The Alpha-Origin stage was what came after the Heaven Gate stage.Channel Opening, Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng, Heaven Gate and Alpha-Origin. These were the first four greater stages for Genesis Masters.The current Zhou Yuan had only opened his first meridian channel. Thus, he was naturally awed by the presence of an Alpha-Origin stage expert.Zhou Qing extended his hand and said, \"We'll test your power first. Use all of your strength.\"Zhou Yuan nodded. His foot powerfully pushed off the ground as his body shot out like an arrow. With a twist of his hip, power surged in his body and converged at his fist. Fist winds immediately emerged as a punch filled with vigorous power heavily slammed into Zhou Qing's extended hand.The soil beneath Zhou Yuan's feet was sent flying while Zhou Qing's body remained unmoved. His hand had likewise not budged a single inch, but an expression of surprise appeared in his eyes.Zhou Yuan ma.s.saged his fist, a little dejected as he withdrew. His full power had not been able to move Zhou Qing's hand at all.\"How did I do father?\" Zhou Yuan raised his head and looked towards Zhou Qing.Zhou Qing did not respond but said, \"Let's test your speed.\"With a twirl of his hand, a dozen pebbles rose from the ground and revolved above his palm. A sudden wave of his hand and the pebbles shot towards Zhou Yuan like a torrential rain storm.Every pebble was akin to an arrow and the sound of rapidly speeding through the wind could be faintly heard.The tip of Zhou Yuan's foot pushed off the ground as his body swiftly backed away, avoiding the majority of the pebbles. However, several pebbles still shooting towards him at a crafty angle, making it impossible for him to dodge.Zhou Yuan's eyes faintly s.h.i.+vered. At this moment, the spirit between his brows jumped and his senses instantly became extremely sharp, making the trajectories of the pebbles exceptionally clear.As a result, he suddenly reached out and caught all of the pebbles with two soft 'pluck' sounds.The force from the pebbles made Zhou Yuan's hand hurt somewhat. He grinned as he swung his hand and said to Zhou Qing, \"Almost wasn't able to catch them.\"\"Father?\"Zhou Yuan sudden realised that Zhou Qing blankly staring at the hand which had caught the pebbles.Zhou Qing came back to his senses upon hearing Zhou Yuan's voice and looked at him in a strange manner. Zhou Qing had intentionally increased the force of behind those few pebbles from before to measure Zhou Yuan's resistance to strikes, in other words, the toughness of his body.However, he never imagined that Zhou Yuan's eyes would be so sharp. He had seen through the trajectories of the pebbles and caught all of them. Was this a coincidence, or something else?Zhou Qing shook his head and shot a glance at Zhou Yuan. The former's finger suddenly flicked and a red bolt of lightning shot out. In the blink of an eye, it blasted Zhou Yuan's chest.Cras.h.!.+Zhou Yuan was sent flying and smashed into a tree. He covered his chest with a hand and cried out in pain.Qin Yu hastily walked over and helped him up before angrily looking towards Zhou Qing. \"Why did you use Flame-Lightning Qi?\"After an awkward laugh, Zhou Qing walked forward and looked at Zhou Yuan's chest. Although it was bruised somewhat green, this was clearly a superficial wound. Zhou Qing's eyelids immediately twitched. How did someone who had only opened a single meridian channel be so st.u.r.dy?\"How was it?\" Zhou Yuan ma.s.saged his chest and asked with a pained face.Zhou Qing looked at Zhou Yuan oddly and replied, \"Are you certain that you've only openedone meridian channel?\"Zhou Yuan could not help but roll his eyes. Did his father think that you could really open two meridian channels at one go?Qin Yu also sensed that something was amiss and nervously asked, \"What is it? Is there something wrong with Yuan'er?\"\"Something wrong?\"Zhou Qing bitterly chuckled. \"Something is indeed wrong, because regardless of whether it is power, speed or toughness, let alone a single channel opener, even a two channel opener cannot compare to this child's body.\"\"This is the first time I've seen such a thing in many many years. To think that the body quality of a mere single channel opener would be so great.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20 Genesis TechniquePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Better than a two channel opener?!\"Zhou Yuan's and Qin Yu's eyes involuntarily opened wide when they heard Zhou Qing's words.\"Master Cang Yuan did not lie. Although it is more difficult to open my channels, the benefits are indeed greater.\" Excitement flooded Zhou Yuan's eyes. From his father's evaluation, it seemed that the quality of his body was even higher than a two channel pract.i.tioner and far surpa.s.sed normal one channel pract.i.tioners.If he added in the Genesis Runes he knew, in terms of battle power, even a three channel pract.i.tioner might not be able to defeat him.\"If I master the Tiger Roar Rune, victory will practically be ensured as long as I don't encounter a four channel pract.i.tioner.\" Mumbled Zhou Yuan in his heart as a wave of happiness washed over him. His hard work over this period had indeed achieved rather pleasing results.Most importantly, this had given Zhou Yuan hope, a hope that he could continuously climb till the day that he would be able to change everything.Zhou Qing's eyes seemed to sparkle as he looked at Zhou Yuan. The only arm he had was extended as he heavily patted Zhou Yuan's shoulder while the latter could see unconcealable excitement and hope in the former's eyes.\"Yuan'er, You've done very well!\"Zhou Qing's voice was somewhat shaky at this moment, and even his eyes had become red. \"King Wu believed that stripping you of your sacred dragon blessing would plunge our Zhou clan's sacred dragon into an endless abyss, but from the looks of it, he has underestimated you!\"Zhou Yuan's mood fluctuated somewhat as he gazed at the emotional Zhou Qing. The former knew that the years where he had been unable to open his channels had caused his father's lofty aspiration to be slowly and cruelly grinded away by reality, while his father's heart had perhaps also started to despair.Reality had made Zhou Qing unable to see even the slightest hope.The Great Zhou Empire was at death's door, while the Great Wu Empire grew increasingly prosperous and powerful. He knew that once the deadline of king Wu's vow arrived, Great Zhou would have to welcome its end.Now however, at the very moment when Zhou Yuan opened his meridian channel, the despairing Zhou Qing had finally seen a glimmer of light.Even if this glimmer was still extremely faint, Zhou Qing believed that there would eventually come a day when this glimmer would transform into a great blazing sun. The fires of revenge would thoroughly incinerate Great Wu, taking back everything that Great Zhou had once lost.Currently, Great Wu was waging war against two other nearby empires and could not spare any attention to Great Zhou. Hence, this was the best time for Zhou Yuan to grow.Zhou Yuan took in a deep breath, pus.h.i.+ng down the emotions in his heart. He knew that there was still an immeasurable gap between him and Great Wu. Thus, he needed to pull back his sights from such a distant place.What he needed to do now was to enter the A cla.s.s through the newcomer exam and ultimately ruin Qi Manor's scheme targeted at the position of Great Zhou Inst.i.tute headmaster.\"Practically all of the hopefuls for the top ten spots in the newcomer exam have the strength of four channels. I may be unafraid of any three channel pract.i.tioner, but my chances against a four channel pract.i.tioner are not great.\" Zhou Yuan's eyes flickered. To make certain that no mishaps would occur, he needed to improve again in the time before the newcomer exam and unblock his second channel.As long as his second meridian channel was opened, Zhou Yuan would have nothing to fear. It was likely that he would have some chance even if he encountered the one who was said to have the best odds at first place, Lin Feng.\"Looks like I can't relax if I intend to enter the A cla.s.s.\" Zhou Yuan secretly thought.\"Yuan'er. Now that your first channel has been opened, you can learn some Genesis techniques and bring out the full potential of your power.\" Said Zhou Qing after regaining his calm.Genesis techniques were techniques that utilised one's Genesis Qi in a more powerful manner. In this world, Genesis techniques were similar to Genesis Weapons and were divided into four tiers, Normal, Black, Heaven and Sacred.However, the higher the grade of the Genesis technique, the greater its requirement on the body. Most Channel Opening stage pract.i.tioners could only learn Normal tier Genesis techniques.\"I'll get someone to send you some suitable Genesis techniques from the royal treasury for you to try.\"Zhou Yuan nodded. Although he had now opened his channel, it could only be said that all he had was power that he was unable to fully utilise. The root cause was that he had never learnt any Genesis techniques.Therefore, a new module was added to his daily cultivation routine from this day....Zhou Qing was highly efficient. Thus, several Genesis techniques were swiftly sent into Zhou Yuan's hands.In the stone pavilion, Zhou Yuan browsed through the Genesis techniques. The most formidable amongst them were the Universe Origin Fist and the Bright Air-Shattering Fist. Both were mid grade Genesis techniques.Zhou Yuan was deep in thought as he stared at these two Genesis techniques. Although they were naturally not too complicated, they were better than low grade Genesis techniques. Of course, the Genesis Qi one had at the Channel Opening stage was not overly abundant, hence even if a more profound Genesis technique was learnt, one would be unable to bring out its true power.While Zhou Yuan was immersed in the two mid grade Genesis techniques, he suddenly smelt a light fragrance. His expression immediately changed a little as he lifted his head, only to find that Yaoyao was standing beside him as she cast an indifferently glance at the two Genesis techniques in his hands.\"Very ordinary Genesis techniques.\" Yaoyao quickly withdrew her gaze and heedlessly remarked.Zhou Yuan helplessly smiled and said, \"They're only Normal mid grade Genesis techniques, how complicated do you expect them to be?\"\"You want to learn Genesis techniques?\"Zhou Yuan's gaze remained on the manuals as he nodded and said, \"Now that I've opened my first meridian channel, I am able to use some Genesis Qi and naturally intend to learn Genesis techniques to supplement my battle power.\"If one did not learn any Genesis techniques, there would be no other option than to clash with the quality of one's body in battle.Yaoyao could not help but give Zhou Yuan a strange look when she heard this. \"You already have superb techniques on you, why do you still look through these ordinary ones?\"Zhou Yuan's eyes suddenly focused. He lifted his head and looked at Yaoyao as his brows furrowed. \"What do you mean?\"Upon seeing this appearance of his, Yaoyao's ruddy little mouth frowned slightly. \"Stupid.\"Zhou Yuan clenched his jaw and said with a hateful tone, \"Has all my good liquor been drunk in vain?\"Yaoyao placed her hand on her cheek and lazily replied, \"Have you not realised anything after so many days of frolicking dragon forms practice?\"A look of thought emerged on Zhou Yuan's face. After a long time, he suddenly stood up, walked out of the stone pavilion, raised his fists and slowly started to do a set of ninety eight forms of the frolicking dragon.He did not quickly complete the set this time. Every action and movement was done rather slowly.Half an incense stick of time had already pa.s.sed by the time he finished the entire setHe stood on the spot and seemed to immerse himself in each and every movement. A long while later, his pupils suddenly shrunk as shock appeared on his immature face.Subsequently, he raised his head and looked towards the stone pavilion at Yaoyao, his voice containing a tone of disbelief.\"This\u2026 this frolicking dragon forms hides Genesis techniques?\"A small smirk emerged on Yaoyao's exquisite as an autumn moon face. \"Although you're a somewhat slow, you are not beyond redemption.\"Next, she extended two slender fingers and coolly said, \"To be precise, there are two Genesis techniques hidden in the ninety eight forms of the frolicking dragon.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21 Dragon Step, Dragon Tablet HandPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Two Genesis techniques?!\"Zhou Yuan's heart shook, eyes full of excitement as he looked towards Yaoyao. The Dragon Breathing method master Cang Yuan had imparted to him was deeply profound and obviously not ordinary at all. Hence, the two Genesis techniques contained within it were likely not simple as well.Yaoyao gently stroked the Tuntun and slowly said, \"These two Genesis techniques are known as the Dragon Step and the Dragon Tablet Hand.\"\"Dragon Step? Dragon Tablet Hand?\" A pensive look emerged on Zhou Yuan's face.He could faintly sense that there were indeed some mysteries within the ninety eight forms of the frolicking dragon. However, he was incapable of clearly identifying them. After all, the only thing master Cang Yuan had done was throw Dragon Breathing at him, and a disciple groping about in the dark by himself would undoubtedly result in rather slow progress.Thus, he begged with his eyes at Yaoyao.Yaoyao displayed a very faint smile and winked at him.Zhou Yuan knew what she meant. With a wave of his hand, a servant girl immediately sent over a bottle of fine liquor. Only then did Yaoyao nod her head in satisfaction before lifting Tuntun and throwing it out of the stone pavilion.Upon seeing her actions, Zhou Yuan's eyelids jumped as a feeling of unease bubbled within him. \"Could it be that Tuntun also knows?\"Yaoyao's red lips curved slightly, displaying a playful expression as she replied, \"Back then, grandpa Hei would teach Tuntun whenever he had nothing to do. Strictly speaking, Tuntun can be considered your senior brother disciple.\"The corners of Zhou Yuan's mouth twitched as he involuntarily howled in his heart, \"Was Tuntun a human wearing the skin of a beast? How the heck was it even able to learn Genesis techniques?! Exactly what kind of beast was it?\"No matter how he howled in his heart however, he still had to learn what needed to be learnt. Hence, he could only look towards Tuntun, gently rub its head and show an extremely kind smile. \"Good Tuntun. Show me the Dragon Step and Dragon Tablet Hand.\"However, Tuntun was currently in a bad mood due to being thrown by Yaoyao. Thus, it merely swept a lazy glance at Zhou Yuan before laying down, refusing to move.Zhou Yuan extended a finger and prodded Tuntun's fat stomach, causing a wave of meat to ripple. However, no matter how he poked and prodded, the latter did not respond at all as if it was dead.Zhou Yuan raised an eyebrow when he saw that the little b.a.s.t.a.r.d was acting dead. Subsequently, he beckoned with his hand and a servant girl immediately brought over a plate of dried Genesis Beast meat.Tuntun's eyes moved the moment its smelled the fragrance of food. It instantly got up and pounced at the plate with a bark.Zhou Yuan pulled the plate away, causing Tuntun to pounce at empty air. It immediately bared its teeth at Zhou Yuan and snarled.\"Show me a first and I'll let you eat.\" Zhou Yuan was all smiles.Tuntun looked at Zhou Yuan and then looked at the enticing Genesis Beast meat. In the end, it came to a compromise before the delicious food and stood up on two legs. Its paw-feet slanted at an angle and it began to display a series of bizarre footwork.Each step was wide and bold but gave off a mist-like sensation. Its body quickly became somewhat blur and it faintly seemed as if a real dragon was soaring within the mist, making it difficult to make out.A small creature standing up on its hind legs and displaying complicated footwork was usually a rather comical sight. However, Zhou Yuan's expression was exceptionally serious while his eyes were unblinkingly fixed on Tuntun.\"This is known as the Dragon Step. A dragon hides within the clouds, barely visible. Dragon Step similarly has a misty and illusory feeling, making others incapable of catching hold of you.\" Yaoyao's indifferent voice echoed from the stone pavilion.\"You may try to attack Tuntun.\"Upon hearing this, Zhou Yuan clenched his hand and the Heavenly Yuan Brush landed within it. \"Martial form!\"The foot-long Heavenly Yuan Brush abruptly grew as Zhou Yuan grabbed it with both hands. Its body swiftly shot forward, wind accompanying the tip of the brush as it pierced towards Tuntun in a tricky manner.Zhou Yuan had spent a substantial amount of time practicing basic spear techniques recently. Therefore, the way he used the Heavenly Yuan Brush now looked a little imposing.The brush tip ferociously shot forward. However, just as it was about to strike Tuntun, the latter's feet slanted and its body seemed to fade away, causing the brush tip to slide past.Zhou Yuan could not believe his eyes. Power circulated in his arms as the Heavenly Yuan Brush fiercely thrust forward with swis.h.i.+ng sounds. It was a rather intimidating sight.However, Tuntun continued to move, neither fast nor slow, as its body seemed to fade away from time to time. Zhou Yuan was unable to even graze the former no matter how he attacked.In the end, Zhou Yuan stopped, gasping for breath as light blossomed in his eyes. He had realized the greatness of the Dragon Step. Such mist-like footwork could toy an enemy dizzy. It was clearly no ordinary auxiliary Genesis technique.Tuntun also slowed down when it saw that Zhou Yuan had stopped. Its little claw patted its fat stomach and pointed Zhou Yuan with a sneer.\"Once the Dragon Step is learnt, one's Genesis Qi will vibrate with the air, creating a smokescreen-like effect. That is how the fade-away effect comes about. In other words, others might see that an attack is aimed at your throat but in reality, the attack has deviated three inches away from your real body. It is these three inches of deviation in which the Dragon Step displays its greatness.\"\"Next is the Dragon Tablet Hand.\" Said Yaoyao in a drawn-out manner.Zhou Yuan raised his head and looked towards Tuntun. It ferociously pounced, its paws swiping and grabbing in a wild and free manner. This sight vaguely resembled a giant dragon reaching out its claws and gave off a bold and powerful aura as if a giant dragon was smas.h.i.+ng a mountain with a tablet.Bang!Claw shadows appeared and heavily slammed into a boulder, instantly shattering it, causing countless pieces of shattered rock to be flung outwards.Zhou Yuan's pupils shrunk a little. The power behind this strike was truly domineering. Most importantly, he could feel that Tuntun had not used powerful Genesis Qi. This meant that the power of this technique would not be weak if he was the one to use it instead.The Dragon Tablet Hand was clearly much stronger than the Universe Origin Fist and the Bright Air-Shattering Fist.Ao ao.Tuntun hopped till it was right in front of Zhou Yuan, pointed its paw at the plate of dried Genesis Beast meat and barked as if to hurry him.Zhou Yuan put down the dried meat with a look of contemplation in his eyes. He considered himself to be achieved basic mastery of the frolicking dragon forms after practicing for the past few days. Thus, he could tell with a single glance that both the Dragon Step and Dragon Tablet Hand from earlier were basically derived from the dragon frolicking forms.Zhou Yuan stood in silence for a long time before he suddenly lifted his foot and stepped forward at an angle. His steps were abnormally eccentric, yet remarkable like a soaring dragon. Meanwhile, the first meridian channel in his body began to absorb the surrounding Genesis Qi before diffusing it out from his body.The instant the circulation of Genesis Qi in his body aligned with his steps, Zhou Yuan s.h.i.+fted his feet horizontally and his body blurred for a moment, unable to be found. It was rather bizarre.In the stone pavilion, Yaoyao's eyes faintly flashed when she saw this. Soon after, a smile of admiration was revealed on her face.Evidently, Zhou Yuan had grasped a little of the Dragon Step.Zhou Yuan continued to practice. An incense stick of time later, his originally inexperienced steps had grown much more practiced. He seemed to absent-mindedly s.h.i.+ft his feet, causing his body to fade away from time to time, becoming as difficult to discern as the mist.Zhou Yuan eventually stopped, eyes filled with surprise and excitement. The Dragon Step was really amazing. The moment one seemingly faded away was in fact due to a certain special reaction between one's Genesis Qi and the surrounding air. It hid one's true location, making it hard to tell what was real or fake, ultimately making it difficult for others to find.After gaining some understanding of the Dragon Step, Zhou Yuan's thoughts s.h.i.+fted to the Dragon Tablet Hand.This bold and powerful Genesis technique was akin to a giant dragon smas.h.i.+ng a mountain with a tablet. That instantaneous explosion of power was obviously rather shocking.The technique was not overly complicated. One only needed to visualise the destructive feeling of a giant dragon flinging a tablet while making Genesis Qi flow along one's channels and brazenly attack.Zhou Yuan's fist seemed to flicker. It appeared to move in slow-motion but gave off a feeling of heaviness as if dragging a heavy tablet while energy brewed within it.Meanwhile, Genesis Qi flowed along the meridian channel in his body and poured into his fist.At a certain moment, Zhou Yuan's eyes suddenly focused as his immature face became stern. His hand abruptly moved, one pulling, the other guiding, as if he was a giant dragon smas.h.i.+ng the stone tablet in his claws at an unbroken mountain range.Boom!Zhou Yuan's fist heavily smashed into a thick tree trunk. Berserk power exploded from the centre of his fist, immediately causing wood splinters to fly as he pierced the entire trunk with a single punch.Sweat flowed down Zhou Yuan's face, but his eyes were exceptionally bright. He knew that his battle power would jump with the Dragon Step and the Dragon Tablet Hand.Next, once he unblocked his second meridian channel, he would no longer have anything to fear in the newcomer exam.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22 Advent of the Newcomer ExamPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs time flowed, the date of the newcomer exam grew increasingly near.For the greater part of the month, Zhou Yuan had not relaxed even for a single moment. He practiced the frolicking dragon forms daily, relentlessly attacking his meridian channels time and time again, while every night was spent on the Primal Chaos Divine Grindstone Visualisation Method to temper his spirit.In addition, the gaps in between were spent learning Genesis Runes from Yaoyao along with diligently practicing the Dragon Step and Dragon Tablet Hand.This enriching and highly intensive training made even Zhou Yuan's body ache all over at the end of each day, while his mind was even more exhausted. Fortunately, Zhou Yuan would become as lively as a tiger and filled with energy after the night's practice of the Primal Chaos Divine Grindstone Visualisation Method.It was then that Zhou Yuan finally felt the benefits brought by the Primal Chaos Divine Grindstone Visualisation Method.Although the training was tough, the results from persevering through it made Zhou Yuan jump with joy. He had finally unblocked his second meridian channel just two days before the newcomer exam...\u2026In the flower park.Zhou Yuan's foot s.h.i.+fted as his figure gave off a faint feeling of mist. He seemed to move carelessly, but his speed was extremely quick, appearing a dozen feet away in a few steps.At the same time, his fist seemed to flicker. Every punch was slow and heavy, but when he punched, the faint sound of wind could be heard, making it clear that these punches contained great force.These were obviously the Dragon Step and Dragon Tablet Hand.The Dragon Step was ungraspable as the mist, while the Dragon Tablet Hand gave off a weighty feeling. Fast feet and slow fist. Contrary to expectation, the combination of the two was rather impressive.Dong!Zhou Yuan's faintly flickering fist suddenly slammed into an artificially placed rock in the park. The rock immediately shook as numerous cracks grew on it. In the end, the rock collapse with a loud boom.Phew.Zhou Yuan deeply exhaled, releasing a ball of white Qi. He looked towards the shattered rock in satisfaction.Zhou Yuan mumbled to himself, \"The Dragon Tablet Hand has three levels, shatter the mountain, split the earth and break the sky. With my two channel strength, I can only use shatter the mountain.\"After half a month of bitter training, he had gained an even greater understanding of the Dragon Tablet Hand and now knew that there were three levels to this technique. Of course, the names of these levels had come from Zhou Yuan himself for the sake of intimidating his opponents. After all, given his two channel strength, he would not be able to shatter an entire mountain even if he obtained complete mastery of the technique.No matter how high grade a Genesis technique was, it needed the support of abundant and powerful Genesis Qi to fully display its might. On this point, his current Genesis Qi was still much too spa.r.s.e.If he was to reach the Heaven Gate stage, his Genesis Qi would become so abundant that a mere breath would be able to shatter a mountain.Even so, Zhou Yuan was already very satisfied with the power of the Dragon Tablet Hand. After all, the opponents he had to face at his current level were not so inconceivably powerful.\"It is nearly time for the newcomer exam. I have to take one of the top ten spots and enter the A cla.s.s, else with just Youwei alone, it will be difficult to keep Qi Yue in check.\" Zhou Yuan's eyes flickered. Qi Yue was the source of the confidence for Qi Manor to take the position of headmaster.The headmaster position was too important. If it fell into Qi Manor's hands, king Qi would definitely do a clean sweep of the ranks and stealthily change the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute into the Great Qi Inst.i.tute.This would be a fatal blow to the royal clan and Zhou Yuan absolutely could not let it happen. Thus, he would do everything in his power to ensure that the number one spot of the year-end cla.s.s rankingl exam ended up with the A cla.s.s.Zhou Yuan inhaled as his eyes gradually turned sharp. Of course, before all of that, he had to first make sure that he would successfully enter the A cla.s.s through the imminent newcomer exam.\u2026On the day of the newcomer exam, the fish-belly-white sun rose from the horizon as the atmosphere over the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute became extremely lively and filled with excitement.Every new student who entered the inst.i.tute would have to take part in the newcomer exam after a year of training. They would subsequently be allocated to a cla.s.s and continue on to more advanced training.Therefore, there was no need to doubt the importance of the newcomer exam in the inst.i.tute.When Zhou Yuan arrived at the exam practice field, it was already a boiling cauldron of noise. Numerous boys and girls gathered in groups as they chatted with each other, each and every one wearing expressions of both nervousness and excitement.Zhou Yuan saw Su Youwei in the biggest group. She was undoubtedly the group's center of attention and the sight of this appeared somewhat like a bunch of stars surrounding the brilliant moon. After all, not only was she pretty, her talent was likewise amazing and she had a determined character. All these factors undoubtedly made Su Youwei the focus amongst the newest batch of students.A faint smile emerged on Zhou Yuan's face as he watched this scene. He could still recall the time when he met Su Youwei a year before, back when she was only a little girl covered in grime. It was as if she had undergone a complete metamorphosis. Not only was she enchantingly beautiful, she also gave off a glow of confidence, causing numerous boys to adore her.All of these changes originated from her own efforts. All Zhou Yuan had done was point out a road for her to walk.In the crowd, the faintly smiling and chatting Su Youwei seemed to have sensed something and lifted her pretty face. Her gaze met Zhou Yuan's and the smile on her lips fully blossomed. The brilliance in that moment caused the eyes of the surrounding boys to brighten.However, before they could redouble their efforts to be friendly, Su Youwei had already politefully smiled at them and exited the crowd. With her small hands behind her back, she unhurriedly walked towards Zhou Yuan, eyes like crescent moons and a smile on her lips.Zhou Yuan stared at Su Youwei. He could faintly sense that the Genesis Qi surrounding her body seemed to have grown stronger and immediately asked, \"Opened your fourth meridian channel?\"\"Opened it long ago. The reason why you do not know is because you've not come to the inst.i.tute recently.\" Su Youwei's bright eyes blinked a few times as she spoke in a somewhat grudging tone.Zhou Yuan could not help but let out an awkward chuckle when he saw her gaze. \"I was also working hard in my training.\"\"So are you confident in your chances?\" Su Youwei's eyes contained some worry. She did not know that Zhou Yuan had already found his meridian channels and thus believed that he could only depend on Genesis Runes.Zhou Yuan grinned as he nodded. \"Don't worry, I will definitely enter the top ten.\"Su Youwei was somewhat relieved when she saw his confident smile and responded with a light nod.While Zhou Yuan was chatting with Su Youwei, several gazes habouring malicious intentions were staring at them from a nearby platform.\"Looks like our prince does have the b.a.l.l.s to take part in the newcomer exam.\" A smile was plastered across Qi Yue's face though it contained a trace of mockery.\"To think that learning a few Genesis Runes would make him so conceited. He truly overestimates himself.\" At Qi Yue's side was the girl called Liu Xi. She had a pretty appearance with thin red lips, and was currently staring at Zhou Yuan in disdain. Her gaze would s.h.i.+ft over to Su Youwei from time to time as jealousy flitted across her eyes.In the past, she, Liu Xi, was the most adored pearl in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute. However, all of this had changed after Su Youwei appeared. Not only was she extremely popular amongst the newer students, even the boys from the various cla.s.ses would talk about her from time to time. Such popularity was clearly not ordinary at all.This made Liu Xi extremely furious. In her eyes, Su Youwei was merely a lowly commoner, someone worlds apart in both status and n.o.bility compared to herself. Yet, this commoner girl had obtained popularity that surpa.s.sed her own, a fact that really infuriated her.Lin Feng stood slightly behind Qi Yue. The former was expressionless as he watched the chatting Zhou Yuan and Su Youwei, but a cold look flashed in his eyes.When Qi Yue saw the look in Lin Feng's eyes, he could not help but chuckle as he patted the latter's shoulders. \"No need to worry, everything is already in place. I have prepared the most excellent opponents for his highness for every match.\"He smiled superficially as he stared at Zhou Yuan and said, \"Since he dares to come, I will let him receive so much humiliation that he will no longer dare to show his face in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute ever again.\"Upon hearing these words, Lin Feng and Liu Xi exchanged a look and laughed. Looks like there was going to be a good show during today's newcomer exam.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 First Sign of the ExcellencePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayClang! Clang!As more and more new students gathered on the practice field, a loud sound spread from a tall platform. Everyone raised their heads and saw an examiner standing there.\"For this newcomer exam, your opponents will be decided through drawing lots. Everyone come forward and draw your lot, those with the same number will be matched with each other.\" The examiner's powerful voice spread across the entire field.Following this, the numerous new students went forward to draw their lots, causing the place to become increasingly bustling.The upper echelons of the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute were gathered on a viewing platform west of the field. Seated at the very centre was the current headmaster, Chu Tianyang.Beside him was middle-aged man in purple robes. The man's face was thin and he had deeply set eyes, making him look rather stern. His was expressionless as he sat with his back against the chair, cup of tea in hand.This person was the vice-headmaster of the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute, and the one in charge of the B cla.s.s, Xu Hong.Xu Hong observed the field as he faintly smiled and said, \"Headmaster Chu, I'm afraid that your A cla.s.s will only be able to select those ranked eleven and below this time.\"Chu Tianyang was expressionless. He naturally knew that most of the outstanding individuals of the new batch had already been enticed to Qi Yue's side and would undoubtedly enter the B cla.s.s after the newcomer exam.Chu Tianyang coldly replied, \"Vice-head Xu, acting so smug so soon might not be a good thing.\"Xu Hong did not mind Chu Tianyang's anger-filled response, the former's lips curling into a mocking smile. His B cla.s.s had already obtained the top position in the cla.s.s ranking exam for the past two years. If they took first place again this year, he would be able to contest for the headmaster position in accordance to the rules of the inst.i.tute.When that happened, the new headmaster of the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute would be him, Xu Hong.The other surrounding cla.s.s masters could only maintain their silence as they watched the two parties clash. They understood very well that behind this contest for the headmaster position was the battle between the Great Zhou royal clan and Qi Manor.Chu Tianyang was deeply enraged by Xu Hong, but there was nothing he could do. Even he could not match majority of the promises Qi Yue had made to entice those students.\"The only thing I can do now is hope that Su Youwei will perform well. She is very talented. If she enters the A cla.s.s and is properly groomed, there might be a chance to for her to vie with Qi Yue during the year-end cla.s.s ranking exam.\"Chu Tianyang softly sighed in his heart. Soon after, his gaze suddenly s.h.i.+fted to Zhou Yuan's location with some worry in his eyes. Although Chu Tiangyang knew that Zhou Yuan was now able to unblock his meridian channels, it had only been a month since then and even if Zhou Yuan's talent was not less than Su Youwei's, he would have likely barely managed to unblock only one channel.With such strength, top ten was certainly out of the question and it was likely that he would not even be able to win a few matches today.Zhou Yuann was the prince of Great Zhou, and the halo of this ident.i.ty would surely draw the attention of others. Hence, it would damage the Great Zhou royal clan's reputation if he lost in an unsightly manner.Chu Tianyang shook his head and mumbled in his heart, \"I hope that his highness will be able to endure for a few matches.\"At this current moment, Zhou Yuan and Su Youwei had already drawn their lots on the practice field. Zhou Yuan had drawn eighteen while Su Youwei forty seven.\"Thank goodness we did not draw the same number.\" Zhou Yuan could not help but smile upon seeing this.Su Youwei softly laughed. Soon after, she said in a serious manner, \"If you meet me, I will not go easy on you.\"Zhou Yuan could only roll his eyes in response.While they were conversing, the referees had already ascended each practice arena and loud shouts sounded in succession.\"Number one, Qin Ya and Liu Ying!\"\"Number two, Cheng Yu and Zhao Qingshan!\"\".\u2026..\"As strong and healthy figures leapt onto each arena, the atmosphere of the entire practice field began to boil. Each arena was surrounded by numerous boys and girls while various cheers and shouts could be heard.Zhou Yuan and Su Youwei did not join in the fun and merely observed from afar.As time pa.s.sed, the matches on these martial arenas quickly came to a close. The victors would rejoice while the losers hung their heads in dejection.However, the exam would not stop for anyone's loss. Hence, intense battles continued to play out on the arenas and Zhou Yuan's turn quickly arrived.\"Number eighteen, Zhou Yuan and Pei Yun!\"As this shout spread, the hearts of numerous youths skipped a beat. Their attention was drawn over from all direction because everyone in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute knew of Zhou Yuan's ident.i.ty.What shocked them even more was Zhou Yuan's opponent, Pei Yun.This individual was quite famous amongst the new batch of students. Not only had he already opened his third meridian channel, he was also one of the more outstanding pract.i.tioners amongst the three channels.\"His highness Zhou Yuan's first match is against Pei Yun?!\"\"That's really unlucky. Pei Yun is one the stronger three channel pract.i.tioners\u2026\"\"Although prince Zhou Yuan is rather good in Genesis Runes, it is quite unlikely that he will be able to defeat a three channel pract.i.tioner.\"\"Is prince Zhou Yuan going to be eliminated in the first match?\"\".\u2026..\"Whispers spread in the practice field. Zhou Yuan had a rather good reputation in the inst.i.tute, hence many people felt that this match-up was rather unfortunate for him.\"To think that it would be Pei Yun.\" Su Youwei's face was somewhat ugly. She had naturally heard of Pei Yun and knew how powerful he was.Zhou Yuan's eyes narrowed slightly. He looked towards a nearby high platform as if he had sensed something, only to see Qi Yue watching him with a strange smile. A thought flashed in Zhou Yuan's mind as he said to himself, \"It is really too much of a coincidence for me to meet such an opponent in my first match.\"His eyes faintly flickered with thought. It was likely that Qi Yue had a hand in this matter. However, the fact that he could pull off such a thing was enough to show how deeply Qi Manor had infiltrated the inst.i.tute.\"To think that he would not hesitate exposing some of Qi Manor's secret p.a.w.ns just to cause me trouble\u2026\"This thought flashed across Zhou Yuan's mind before he smiled at Su Youwei, whose eyes were filled with worry, and said, \"Don't worry, I'm afraid that a three channel pract.i.tioner is not enough to stop me.\"\"I'll be going.\"After speaking, Zhou Yuan waved his hand at Su Youwei and briskly walked towards the practice arena.Qi Yue watched this scene from the high platform and could not help but grin at Lin Feng and Liu Yi. \"The show is about to start. I hope that our prince will be able to at least last for a while and let us properly enjoy it.\"A gloating look flitted across Lin Feng's and Liu Yi's eyes when they heard this. Both of them also smirked and looked towards the arena.On the viewing platform to the west, Chu Tianyang frowned slightly when he saw this same scene and helplessly sighed in his heart. With such an opponent, it likely going to be very difficult for Zhou Yuan to achieve victory in his first match.Under numerous pitying gazes, a calm-looking Zhou Yuan ascended the arena. He looked to his front, only to find a boy in blue fearlessly standing there, a mocking look in the latter's eyes.Pei Yun had an odd look in his eyes as he smiled and said, \"I really did not imagine that I will meet your highness in the first match. Do forgive me if my blows are too heavy later on.\"\"Did Qi Yue set this up?\" Asked Zhou Yuan in an emotionless voice.Pei Yun's eyes widened a little, before he smiled and replied, \"I do not know what your highness is talking about.\"Zhou Yuan adjusted his clothes. \"I'm afraid that things will not end well for the one who volunteered to be the first to test the waters.\"Pei Yun was a little angered and coldly replied, \"It will be better for your highness to think about your own situation. I pray that you will not be humiliated too greatly today.\"While they were talking, a referee sternly cried out, \"Begin!\"Pei Yun's eyes were filled with iciness. Hence, his figure bolted out like a panther the moment the referee's cry rang out, fingers tightly clenched into a powerful punch that was thrown at Zhou Yuan.He did not hold back at all with regards to this punch. Three channels of power fully poured out, covering the surface of his fist with Genesis Qi and even the sound of wind could be heard due to its momentum.This was obviously an extremely domineering and powerful punch. Even a three channel pract.i.tioner would not dare to underestimate it.The crowd around the arena could not help but shake their heads. It was likely that Zhou Yuan would lose when this punch landed.Under the watching eyes of the crowd, intimidating fist winds pounced at Zhou Yuan's face. He gazed at the rather twisted look on his opponent as his hand suddenly shot out to catch the latter's fist.\"Courting death!\" Upon seeing this, Pei Yun's anger transformed into laughter. Could Zhou Yuan have been frightened silly? Pei Yun's punch could shatter even rock and yet Zhou Yuan dared to catch it? Was he not afraid of breaking his arm?Thump!A sinister look filled Pei Yun's eyes as he watched his deadly punch heavily smashed into Zhou Yuan's palm, causing a pleased smile to emerge from the corners of the former's lips.However, this smile immediately turned rigid a split second later.He had seen that Zhou Yuan's outreached hand had not budged at all. Wild power gushed out from Pei Yun's punch, but it was as all of this power was charging into a black hole. There was no response at all.\"How is this possible?!\" A horrified cry sounded in Pei Yun's heart, his expression suddenly changing, as a feeling of unease rose within him.The corners of Zhou Yuan's mouth turned into a cold smile as he watched the changing expression on Pei Yun's face. Zhou Yun had already unblocked his second meridian channel, greatly strengthening his body. Even a three channel pract.i.tioner could not compare to him now.He held Pei Yun's fist and slowly exerted force with a grip as solid as that of an eagle. The growing power caused Pei Yun to feel as if his fist was about to be crushed.\"Three channels open!\"Pei Yun wore a horrified expression as he fiercely gritted his teeth and howled.The three meridian channels in his body abruptly started to vibrate, pulling in the surrounding Genesis Qi. Immediately, a powerful force exploded within his body.However, just as he was able to free himself from Zhou Yuan's grip, the latter suddenly made his move, or more accurately swung his leg. Powerful kick-wind blew as a foot surrounded by slivers of swirling Genesis Qi was swiftly flung at Pei Yun's chest.\"Scram!\"Thump!A m.u.f.fled sound was heard as Pei Yun felt an indescribably huge force slam into him. The force was so great that he would not be able to match it even if he use all three meridian channels to take in Genesis Qi.Thus, his body was sent miserably flying off the arena, before cras.h.i.+ng into the ground as he vomited a mouthful of blood.The surroundings immediately turned silent. Everyone was dumbstruck as they watched this scene.The exchange between Zhou Yuan and Pei Yun had been too quick. They had only seen Pei Yun charge at Zhou Yuan, and before they could react, the aggressive Pei Yun had been kicked off the stage by Zhou Yuan a millisecond later\u2026Just how much power was in that kick?!Everyone looked at Zhou Yuan as if they had seen a ghost. They clearly knew that he had not used any Genesis Runes this time.Therefore, the kick from earlier was completely Zhou Yuan's own power.Even a three channel pract.i.tioner could not compare, right?!Since when had this prince of theirs, whom was said to be unable to find his channels, become so strong?Su Youwei's hand covered her mouth, while her face filled with disbelief. She had not understood why Zhou Yuan had been so confident before. Only now did she understand\u2026 Zhou Yuan had been hiding his power all along!On the tall platform, the smiles of the trio whom were originally ready to enjoy a good show also turned rigid at this moment as their faces turned white with anger, disbelief and shock.This turn of events had far exceeded their expectations.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 Show of MighPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"How is this possible?!\"Lin Feng's and Liu Xi's faces were filled with astonishment. Their eyes were glued to the slender figure on the nearby arena as they said in shock, \"He removed the three channel Pei Yun from the arena with a single kick?!\"Qi Yue's face twitched, his eyes like dark clouds as he said in a chilling voice, \"It seems that we've been tricked by Zhou Yuan. He used Genesis Qi in his previous kick, meaning he has already unblocked at least one meridian channel!\"Lin Feng's and Liu Xi's pupils shrunk. They knew that Zhou Yuan's eight meridians refused to show themselves so why had they suddenly been unblocked now?Zhou Yuan had concealed himself very deeply indeed!Qi Yue inhaled deeply and darkly said, \"He has likely unblocked his channels recently and cannot possibly have opened too many. Pei Yun lost so quickly because he was caught off-guard and did not even have the chance to use any Genesis techniques.\"\"If he was prepared, Zhou Yuan might not have won.\"Upon hearing this a.n.a.lysis, Lin Feng and Liu Xi regained their calm and nodded in agreement. Zhou Yuan had purposely hidden his strength, making his opponent careless before taking victory in a flash.\"Such craftiness.\" Liu Xi sneered. \"However, this method can only be used once. Let's see how he fares in the next match!\"Lin Feng slowly nodded. He had originally planned to wait for Zhou Yuan to be thoroughly humiliated in front of Su Youwei. Lin Feng never imagined that Zhou Yuan would pull off something like this and it truly angered him.Qi Yue's eyes flickered as he darkly stared at Zhou Yuan's figure. No one knew what the former was thinking.Meanwhile, on the observation platform, Chu Tianyang's face was filled with shock as when he saw this scene. Bewilderment fluctuated indeterminately in his eyes as he said, \"How did prince Zhou Yuan become so powerful?\"He clearly understood that Zhou Yuan had only been able to begin his channel opening training a month ago. Yet, the power of that kick from before had been even greater than that of a three channel pract.i.tioner!He could not figure it out at all and could only inwardly shake his head. However, he also secretly sighed in relief. Looks like Zhou Yuan did have some chance in this newcomer exam.No wonder he had declared that he would enter the A cla.s.s through the newcomer exam a month ago. It turned out that he did have the ability to match his words.Beside Chu Tianyang, Xu Hong frowned a little when he saw Zhou Yuan obtain victory, but did not say anything. Although the power that Zhou Yuan had shown was astonis.h.i.+ng, it was still rather optimistic for him to take one of the top ten positions. Thus, there was no need to worry.Under the gazes of astonishment from all around, Zhou Yuan hopped off the arena after hearing the referee's decision and walked towards Su Youwei.\"You've really concealed your abilities really well!\" Su Youwei pouted a little as she looked at Zhou Yuan. To think that she had been worrying all along because she was in the dark with regards to the fact that he had already begun unblocking his channels.Zhou Yuan hurriedly explained, \"There was no time to tell you because I was training non-stop.\"Su Youwei softly snorted, a clearly unhappy look on her small face as she replied, \"Then tell me truthfully, how many channels have you opened?\"\"Two.\" Zhou Yuan chuckled, not hiding anything. After all, everyone would know after today.Su Youwei's long and shapely eyebrows furrowed slightly as she shot a skeptical look at Zhou Yuan. \"That kick from earlier was not from a two channel pract.i.tioner.\"That attack had been able to kick even a three channel pract.i.tioner off the stage. Its power was completely unlike something a two channel pract.i.tioner was capable of.Zhou Yuan could only let out a helpless laugh. The quality of his two channel body was practically akin to a four channel pract.i.tioner. Hence, sending Pei Yun flying with a kick was not difficult at all. However, he naturally could not explain this so as to avoid drawing attention he could not afford.Fortunately, Su Youwei did not dwell on this topic. Instead, her eyes contained joy as she said, \"Two channels. If you add in your Genesis Runes, you might even have a chance of charging into the top ten rankings.\"Zhou Yuan nodded with a smile.The newcomer exam went on while they talked. An unceasing string of intense battle on the various arenas continued to incite cheers and shouts from the numerous surrounding boys and girls.It soon came to Su Youwei's turn.Su Youwei's opponent was a mere two channel new student. The latter's face turned somewhat pale when he realised he had been matched with her. After all, the gap between both parties was far too great.Thus, there was no suspense at all in this match. After a few exchanges, Su Youwei's opponent had been completely defeated and he subsequently jumped off the stage.After a few more rounds, Zhou Yuan's turn came once again.\"Zhou Yuan, s.h.i.+ Yu!\"When this shout rang out in the field, numerous gazes were instantly drawn over. The first match had ended way too quickly and many people did not understand how Zhou Yuan had won. Hence, they were extremely curious about this next match.Zhou Yuan walked onto the arena unde the attention of numerous gazes. The boy called s.h.i.+ Yu facing him had a rather well-built body. However, s.h.i.+ Yu was currently full of vigilance as he stared at Zhou Yuan. It was evident that this second opponent had learnt a lesson from his predecessor.\"Begin!\"s.h.i.+ Yu made his move the instant the judge's shout was heard. \"Three channels open!\"Following s.h.i.+ Yu's roar, Genesis Qi flooded into his body. His clothes flapped about, while light that could be seen with the naked eye swirled on the surface of his body. It was a rather imposing sight.As he felt the explosion of power in his body, the wariness in his eyes receded substantially. s.h.i.+ Yu tightly stared at Zhou Yuan and a split second later, the former's foot pushed off the ground as he shot forward.His body appeared in front of Zhou Yuan, five fingers curling like an eagle's claw while Genesis Qi light flowed at his fingertips. The sharpness of this attack was enough to tear through rock.s.h.i.+ Yu's attack was extremely swift and ferocious, reaching Zhou Yuan's neck in the blink of an eye. However, just as it was about to land, Zhou Yuan's feet suddenly inclined as his body turned blurry.The hand-claw surrounded by wisps of Genesis Qi light slashed downwards, but what made s.h.i.+ Yu's pupils shrink was that his originally sure-hit attack had landed on empty air.\"Not good!\" A chill rose in his heart.However, a figure flashed before his eyes before he could pull back his hand and defend. Zhou Yuan rapidly closed-in, a slim palm penetrating Su Yu's defences and lightly landed on his chest. The palm strike seemed to be a light blow, but it contained astonis.h.i.+ng power.Thump!s.h.i.+ Yu was barely able to direct Genesis Qi light to his chest in defence before he quickly felt an overbearing power pour onto his chest.s.h.i.+ Yu's body was directly blown away by the power and his sorry figure landed on the arena.He miserably steadied himself before hastily rolling away in hopes of avoiding Zhou Yuan's follow-up attack. However, the moment his body stopped, s.h.i.+ Yu saw a flash from the corner of his eyes as a figure closely followed him like a shadow, causing him to scared out of his skin.However, before he could take any action, he felt a hand grab his forehead. Power surged at the center of the hand, causing his body to freeze, no longer daring to make any movements.If that power was released, his head would be crushed.\"I admit defeat!\" Cold sweat drenched s.h.i.+ Yu's body as he loudly shouted without the slightest hesitation.Upon hearing s.h.i.+ Yu concede, Zhou Yuan released his hand and his gaze swept around him. The surroundings of the arena were completely silent.Everyone's mouths were wide open having seen the swift and direct end to the match.\"Great!\"This silence lasted for a split second before countless cheers followed. The swiftness and ferocity Zhou Yuan had shown earlier paired with his almost phantom-like speed was truly stunning.Was this still the prince that was rumored to have been unable to begin channel opening cultivation?On the tall platform nearby, Qi Yue, Liu Xi and Lin Feng turned silent while their expressions fluctuated indeterminately.Lin Feng slowly said, \"Very fast!\"A serious look had finally appeared in his eyes.As an observer, he was naturally able to clearly see that s.h.i.+ Yu had lost because of Zhou Yuan's speed. No matter how the former retreated at full speed, Zhou Yuan had followed behind like a shadow.Liu Xi gritted her teeth as she angrily scolded s.h.i.+ Yu, \"What a useless piece of trash.\"Qi Yue was expressionless. His hands slowly stroked the railings as he said in a voice void of any warmth, \"The quality of his body is very high, practically able to match a four channel pract.i.tioner.\"His tone turned much icier as he looked towards Lin Feng. \"Three channel pract.i.tioners are no match for him. It seems that we can only rely on you.\"Cold light flowed in Lin Feng's eyes as he nodded. \"Relax. He will not pa.s.s me. I will let him know just how powerful a true four channel pract.i.tioner is!\"On the viewing platform, shock was revealed on Chu Tianyang's face as he mumbled to himself, \"The quality of his body is comparable to a four channel pract.i.tioner, but the Genesis Qi undulations are not as strong as a four channel pract.i.tioner, strange\u2026\"Zhou Yuan jumped off the stage. He could feel an additional trace of respect in the gazes that were cast at him from all around, respect not because of his status or ident.i.ty, but because of the power he had displayed.In a world where cultivation was the mainstream, even a prince like Zhou Yuan being unable to start channel opening cultivation would make others feel sympathy and pity for him.Zhou Yuan did not like those gazes. That was why he had such a strong attachment to Genesis Qi cultivation.Now, these feelings were no longer present in the gazes that were directed at him.\"So powerful.\" Su Youwei's pretty face was filled with astonishment as she watched Zhou Yuan walk over. As a four channel opener, she could naturally tell how formidable his attacks had been on the arena. Especially that speed, even she did not dare to underestimate it.Zhou Yuan chuckled before turning his head as he looked towards the tall platform nearby. Qi Yue's gaze coincidentally met Zhou Yuan's, both seeing the frostiness in each other's eyes.Qi Yue stared at Zhou Yuan in a cold and dark manner as his lips cracked open into a smile, revealing a set of sinisterly white teeth. Subsequently, he extended his hand and slid it across his throat, an action that was filled with provocation.Zhou Yuan merely let out a laugh in response as he softly said to himself.\"Still so lively. Just wait and see how I will beat you to death in the cla.s.s ranking exam at the end of the year\u2026\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25 Battling Lin FengPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe field was over-saturated with people. The intense battles on each of the various arenas would cause deafening cheers to erupt from the many boys and girls from time to time. It was a pretty explosive atmosphere.As time pa.s.sed, more and more new students were eliminated. However, the remaining students were becoming increasingly elite, causing the battles that followed to naturally become even more amazing.Over this period, Zhou Yuan had another two matches. There were no surprises to the outcomes. His three channel opponents were utterly defeated at his hands.Hence, he entered the top twenty.In front of a certain martial arena, Zhou Yuan gazed at the stage where two figures were criss-crossing at high speeds. Genesis Qi light flowed around their bodies and every clash of fists and legs would cause the air to make ear-piercing noises.The one on the stage was naturally Su Youwei, and her opponent was similarly a four channel pract.i.tioner.If she won this match, Su Youwei would advance to the top ten and possess the qualifications to enter the A cla.s.s.Su Youwei's beautiful figure moved nimbly like a willow in the wind. Her opponent was a well-built youth whose attacks were wild and free, extremely barbaric like a ferocious ape.In response to her opponent's wildness, Su Youwei chose to not meet him head-on. Instead, she borrowed the force of her opponents punches and strikes to agilely dodge.This went on for a long time until the strong youth's ferocious attacks finally grew weary. Su Youwei's eyes flashed as she changed her strategy, her pretty figure abruptly closing in on her opponent.However, it was at this moment that a bright light flashed in the youth's eyes. His originally somewhat weary attacks were suddenly revived. With a loud shout, Genesis Qi light swirled around a hard fist containing alarming force whilst accompanied by a faint sonic boom as it powerfully struck at Su Youwei.Formidable fist-wind rushed over, causing Su Youwei's fine black hair to fly. However, there was no trace of panic in her eyes. Her two fingers jutted out like a sharp sword and violently thrust forward, beating the youth by half a beat as it landed on his chest.The fist-wind came to an abrupt halt. The youth's eyes were wide with fury, his body faintly trembling and his face flushed red as he said through gritted teeth, \"You've actually mastered the Jade-Breaker Finger?\"Su Youwei smiled faintly as her outstretched hand gently pushed and the well-built youth's body immediately fell to the ground with a loud thud. At the same time, the crowd finally saw a jade-like l.u.s.ter on Su Youwei's slender fingers. It sparkled in a translucent manner while giving off a formidable aura of coldness.The numerous watching boys and girls surround the arena exploded into cheers.\"That is the Jade-Breaker Finger, right? A mid grade Genesis technique said to be very difficult to master. I never imagined that Su Youwei would actually succeed.\"\"This technique concentrates power at a point to break through and has extremely great destructive power. A moment ago, there was a gap in Zhao Feng's powerful a.s.sault which was exploited by Su Youwei's finger attack, resulting in his defeat.\"\"So awesome, as expected of the fastest channel opening genius of our Great Zhou Inst.i.tute.\"\".\u2026..\"Numerous boys lamented, their gazes turning even more pa.s.sionate when they looked towards Su Youwei. There was also thick adoration within their eyes.Under those pa.s.sionate gazes, Su Youwei got off the stage and headed straight for Zhou Yuan. There was no longer any trace of the decisiveness and ruthlessness from the recently ended fight in her current smiling appearance.\"How was it?\" Su Youwei lightly hoisted her snow-white chin like a young child showing off candy.\"Very formidable. The power of that Jade-Breaker Finger was fairly shocking. Even the body of a four channel opener will not be able to withstand it.\" Zhou Yuan sincerely praised. He would likely be unable to take the might of that finger attack if it landed on his body.Upon obtaining Zhou Yuan's praise, the corners of Su Youwei's ruddy little mouth turned upwards. Just as she was about to speak, a referee's shout was suddenly heard from a nearby arena.\"Zhou Yuan, Lin Feng!\"The moment this shout was heard, the originally noisy field instantly fell silent. Soon after, booming cheers exploded as practically every person flooded towards that particular arena.After winning the previous few matches, Zhou Yuan had undoubtedly become the most dazzling black horse in the newcomer exam. However, the opponent he encountered this time was Lin Feng!Lin Feng was hugely popular amongst the new batch of students and was rumoured to be the most likely candidate for the number one position in the exam.Amongst the new batch of students, Lin Feng was definitely one of the very best.Would Zhou Yuan be a black horse till the end, or would he be stopped by Lin Feng just outside top ten? Everyone was burning to find out.Su Youwei's expression also changed drastically at this moment. It was obvious that it had never occurred to her that Zhou Yuan and Lin Feng would meet. One must know that even she would have prepare for a hard fight against Lin Feng, what more the merely two channel Zhou Yuan?Zhou Yuan's eyes narrowed slightly. He lifted his head and looked towards the nearby tall platform where Qi Yue revealed a smile at him. Subsequently, the latter reached a hand and tapped Lin Feng's shoulder.Lin Feng also looked towards Zhou Yuan with an expressionless face. However, there was coldness and disdain in those eyes of his.Lin Feng seemed to smile and say something to Qi Yue before pus.h.i.+ng off the ground with the tip of his foot, causing his body to rise into the air. He landed on the arena in a confident manner that drew cheers from the surrounding crowd.A cold smile also emerged from the corners of Liu Xi's lips when she saw this. \"Let's see how he will win this time!\"Qi Yue also smiled and nodded. Lin Feng's strength was top tier amongst four channel pract.i.tioners. Dealing with a mere Zhou Yuan should not be too difficult.On the viewing platform, Chu Tianyang frowned a little upon seeing that Zhou Yuan and Lin Feng had been matched. Soon after, a cold glint flitted across his eyes as he beckoned to a guard and said in a flat voice, \"After today, fire the one who's in-charge of the arrangements for this exam.\"He had already realised that it was rather strange for Zhou Yuan repeatedly encounter formidable opponents. Now that even Lin Feng had been matched with the former, how could he possibly fail to grasp what was going on. Fury instantly flooded his heart. To think that these people actually dared to target Zhou Yuan in front of him.By the side, Xu Hong's expression remained unchanged as he asked, \"Isn't this a little too much?\"Chu Tianyang coldly chuckled and replied, \"All of you know full well what you have done. Besides, I am the headmaster and do not need the likes if you to teach me how to do things.\"There was a little anger in Xu Hong's eyes, but in the end, he only snorted and did not speak any further. Although Qi Yue had exposed some of Qi Manor's men, it did not affect the the grand scheme of things.Under numerous gazes of pity from the field, Zhou Yuan also stepped onto the arena.Lin Feng stood with his hands behind his back, looking rather tall and handsome. He looked at Zhou Yuan and said with a superficial smile, \"Your highness is truly surprising. To think that you were actually able to come all the way here.\"Zhou Yuan glanced at Lin Feng and replied in an indifferent tone, \"You will be even more surprised later on.\"Lin Feng let out a cold laugh. \"I look forward to it.\"Sparks were already flying in the exchange of words between the two like two needles clas.h.i.+ng at their tips.\"Match begin!\" The referee's shout rang out in the arena, breaking the exchange between the two.On the arena, Zhou Yuan and Lin Feng stared at each other, cold light flas.h.i.+ng in both of their eyes.Bang!In the next instant, Zhou Yuan's and Lin Feng's bodies shot out at practically the same moment.With a stamp from Lin Feng's foot, his body rose into the air. A whip-leg ripped through the air with a 'chi la' sound, filled with astonis.h.i.+ng force. Like a whip, it viciously snapped at Zhou Yuan's head.This kick could shatter even rock.Zhou Yuan's arm swept out horizontally, blocking the kick. The powerful force caused his arm to be violently jolted, while his other arm had already thrust forward, five fingers curling into a fist as it headed straight for Lin Feng's chest.Pa!Lin Feng's body abruptly swivelled in mid-air as his five fingers also formed a fist that smashed against Zhou Yuan's like a javelin.Thud thud thud!In a short span of less than a dozen breaths, the two already exchanged a dozen blows. Each strike was deadly and aimed at the vitals, causing the onlookers outside the arena to be greatly disturbed.Strong winds unfurled on the arena, sweeping up the dirt as Zhou Yuan's and Lin Feng's bodies were jerked back time and time again.Waves of noise rippled from below the arena. The crowd now looked at Zhou Yuan in a new light. Both of the partic.i.p.ants had not used any Genesis Qi in their earlier exchanges and fully relied on the quality of their respective bodies.However, Lin Feng's four channel body was not able to obtain even the slightest advantage over Zhou Yuan.This caused them to be rather shocked. No matter how much they racked their brains, they could not understand why Zhou Yuan's body would be so strong.The commotion below the stage also caused Lin Feng's expression to become somewhat ugly. The cold light in his eyes immediately became colder as he took in a deep breath and no longer held anything back. \"Four channels open!\"The moment Lin Feng's shout rang out, Genesis Qi surged over from all around and poured into his body.Strands of Genesis Qi light swirled around Lin Feng's body, and faint cracks started to grow on the stone arena below his feet. It was very intimidating.Bang!Lin Feng's foot stomped, cracking the stone floor of the arena. His speed soared and he instantly appeared in front of Zhou Yuan, palm-wind screaming as a strike powerfully swept towards Zhou Yuan.The powerful wind that pounced towards Zhou Yuan caused his heart to s.h.i.+ver a little. The fact that Lin Feng was able to become one of the top students amongst the new batch was definitely proof of his strength.Zhou Yuan's steps inclined at an angle, activating the Dragon Step, as his figure turned mist-like and blurry.Lin Feng's palm swept past but only managed to brush Zhou Yuan's chest.\"What a strange body-type support skill!\" Lin Feng's pupils shrunk slightly. He had previously seen Zhou Yuan's bizarre auxiliary technique. When his body became blurry, it seemed as if any attack would land on empty air.\"Mid grade Genesis technique, Demon Bull Stomp!\"Bright light flickered in Lin Feng's eyes as his foot suddenly stamped on the ground. Stone was immediately shattered as a ripple that could be seen with the naked eye unfurled.Regardless of how amazing Zhou Yuan's auxiliary technique was, he was still affected by the shockwave area attack. His body immediately jerked, freezing for an instant.\"Time for you to get off the stage!\" Lin Feng instantly grabbed ahold of this opening. With a loud shout, his five fingers curled into a fist as he threw a punch at Zhou Yuan's chest like an angry lion.As wind whistled towards him, Zhou Yuan did not dare to tarry as his foot stamped on the ground. \"Two channels open!\"Genesis Qi poured into Zhou Yuan's body as flowing Genesis Qi light appeared on the surface of his body.Zhou Yuan's crossed his arms in a defensive posture.Boom!Lin Feng's fist heavily landed on Zhou Yuan's arms, power pouring out in torrents. Zhou Yuan's feet shook as his body rapidly slid backwards, only coming to a stop dangerously close to the edge of the arena.Cries of alarm immediately exploded from below the arena. Su Youwei's hand covered her mouth, her pretty face filled with anxiety.Lin Feng sneered, \"You are really tenacious.\"Zhou Yuan lightly shook his numb arms as he replied, \"The power of four fully open channels is indeed formidable.\"If he had not braced his lower body earlier, the explosion of power would have likely thrown him off the arena.Lin Feng coldly said, \"You're going down next time!\"Zhou Yuan's eyes narrowed slightly, the expression in his eyes gradually growing sharper as he stared at Lin Feng. The former took a step forward, his body bending forward slightly, like a tiger that was about to go all out and rip its prey to shreds.A dangerous feeling spread from Zhou Yuan's body as he grinned at Lin Feng, revealing a set of eerily white teeth that made one's heart beat a little faster.\"I feel that you will not have another chance!\"The instant his voice rang out, Zhou Yuan's figure had already shot forward!His full power counter attack had begun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 RisePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySwis.h.!.+The moment Zhou Yuan's words faded, his body had already swiftly lunged forward like a cheetah. Threads of flowing Genesis Qi light swirled on the surface of his body, allowing his power and speed to soar.Ferocious!\"You're courting death!\"Cold light seemed to overflow from Lin Feng's eyes when he saw Zhou Yuan begin his counter attack. Lin Feng was after all a four channel pract.i.tioner and this response from Zhou Yuan was really belittling this four channel status.\"Since you are so confident, I will completely obliterate this confidence of yours in front of everyone!\"Lin Feng's five fingers slowly clenched tightly as flowing Genesis Qi light emerged on the surface of his body. His clothes flapped while the muscles beneath his skin vibrated as explosive power rapidly converged.An imposing aura spread from Lin Feng's body. The power of four channels had been displayed to the limit at this moment.The crowd below the arena also felt Lin Feng's aura, their expressions changing slightly in response. Even Su Youwei's pupils shrank slightly, her fair hands tightly clenched as a look of worry flitted across her pretty face.Lin Feng's strength was top tier even amongst four channel openers.Zhou Yuan was likewise able to feel his opponent's presence. However, he had no intentions of withdrawing and instead stamped his foot on the ground as the glow of a Genesis Rune emerged from the bare part of his leg.\"Light Body Rune!\"His speed instantly rose sharply once again.\"Metal Skin Rune!\" His arms glowed with black light as if they were made from metal.\"Rampaging Bull Rune!\" Zhou Yuan's shoulder shook as a faint bull cry rang out, bringing with it rampaging power.Three Genesis Runes had been simultaneously activated, causing Zhou Yuan's aura to surge. His ferocious appearance let everyone know just how formidable his counter attack would be.This sight also made the numerous boys and girls below the stage cry out in surprise.On the tall platform however, the corners of Qi Yue's and the girl called Liu Xi's mouths lifted to form mocking smiles when they saw this scene.Qi Yue's ten fingers were clasped together. He watched Zhou Yuan menacingly pounce towards Lin Feng as he said in a mocking voice, \"Looks like our prince does not know that Lin Feng's specialty is not attack, but defence\u2026\"\"Among those at the four channel level, no one has been able to break Lin Feng's defence.\"\"That's why the more powerful his attacks, the more miserable his defeat will be. Hehe, I truly look forward to it.\"Under the attention of numerous tense gazes from the crowd, Zhou Yuan and Lin Feng were practically inches away when the corners of Lin Feng's lips raised slightly. Suddenly, he took half a step forward as he body leaned forward.\"Mid grade Genesis technique, Metal Demon Wall!\"A roar abruptly emerged from Lin Feng's mouth. One could only watch as the flowing Genesis Qi light on the surface of his body whizzed out, forming a faint membrane of black light in front of him.Although this light film was extremely thin, its dark l.u.s.ter gave off a feeling of indestructible solidness.Upon seeing the black light membrane that had appeared on the surface of Lin Feng's body, the expression on Su Youwei's pretty face immediately changed drastically. She knew that this Metal Demon Wall was considered top tier amongst mid grade Genesis techniques. Not only did it possess extremely strong defensive power, it was even able to reflect a portion of the enemy's attacks.In other words, if it was not instantly destroyed, the more powerful an attack, the greater the backlash on the attacker.In addition, even Su Youwei did not have absolute confidence in instantly destroying this Metal Demon Wall.\"Making you lose to your own attacks, prince Zhou Yuan, your miserable appearance will spread throughout the entire Great Zhou Inst.i.tute.\" A smile of disdain emerged from the corners of Lin Feng's mouth as he watched as Zhou Yuan grow closer and closer.Under the numerous gazes of the crowd, Zhou Yuan's eyes similarly detected the black light film that had appeared on the surface of Lin Feng's body. The power surging within it caused the former's brows to raise slightly.\"So he plans to rely on a tortoise sh.e.l.l\u2026\"Zhou Yuan coldly chuckled as coldness surged in his eyes. \"Since you are so confident in this tortoise sh.e.l.l, I will have to insist on breaking it!\"His figure shot forth and appeared right in front of Lin Feng. In the next moment, he suddenly breathed in and everyone saw a rune of light appear on his throat.\"Another Genesis Rune?!\" Lin Feng's pupils shrunk when he saw this.Roar!While Lin Feng's heart was in shock, Zhou Yuan's mouth abruptly opened, and a deafening tiger roar ferociously swept out in a wave like fas.h.i.+on.\"Grade 1 Genesis Rune, Tiger Roar Rune!\"The crowd around the arena hastily covered their ears. The feeling of Qi and blood in their bodies churning about immediately caused them to turn pale with horror. The power of this Genesis Rune was definitely not at the elementary level!Even the bystanders had been affected. As the main target, Lin Feng's head was buzzing. The black membrane on the surface of his body rippled violently and seemed to freeze for an instant.It was at this same instant that Zhou Yuan closed-in on Lin Feng. Zhou Yuan's five fingers tightly grasped together and swung forth in an incomparably heavy manner. Even the air seemed to explode in the face of this punch.\"Dragon Tablet Hand, shatter the mountain!\"Genesis Qi swirled around his fist as it smashed into the black light membrane.Buzz!The light membrane pulsed violently as ripples frantically spread. It was at this moment that Lin Feng finally recovered from the tiger roar sound wave and his expression immediately changed on the spot. He could feel a frightening power surging towards him.The source of that power was Zhou Yuan's fist.\"How can his strength be so terrifying?!\" Lin Feng's heart shook as terror appeared in his eyes.\"Break!\"Zhou Yuan's icy roar rang out at this moment.Bang!The moment he roared, everyone was overwhelmed with shock to see the layer of black light on the surface of Lin Feng's body shatter in response.\"I admit\u2026\" Terror filled Lin Feng's face as he hastily tried to cry out.However, Zhou Yuan did not wait for him to finish. The fist containing all of his power heavily slammed into Lin Feng's chest.Urgh!A mouthful of fresh blood spurted out as Lin Feng's body was sent flying backwards under many shocked gazes. His body flew past several arenas before heavily landing on the ground, smearing a long scar in the dirt before fainting on the spot.Following Lin Feng's fall to the ground, the entire field was blanketed in silence. Everyone was stupefied as they watched this scene. Even Su Youwei's eyes were wide open, her hand over her mouth.\"How\u2026\"Everyone mumbled to themselves, their faces full of disbelief. Just moments ago, they had been admiring Lin Feng's solid defence and a split second later, that seemingly indestructible Metal Demon Wall had been smashed to pieces by a single punch from Zhou Yuan\u2026Just how powerful was that punch?Was this really what a two channel opener was capable of?\"Excellent!\"Chu Tianyang burst out on the viewing platform. He quickly rose to his feet, his eyes flas.h.i.+ng brightly, his face filled with amazement. The power of Zhou Yuan's earlier punch was definitely not that of a two channel pract.i.tioner.Looks like this prince of theirs had finally started reveal his extraordinariness after so many years of silence. This was undoubtedly a tremendously joyful occasion for Great Zhou.Meanwhile, Xu Hong's face twitched slightly, bewilderment flickering indeterminately in his eyes as he stared at Zhou Yuan.On the tall platform, Qi Yue's and Liu Xi's smiles froze.Crack.Qi Yue's hands suddenly clenched, crus.h.i.+ng the railing in front of him. His handsome face had become turned white with rage.\"How could he have broken Lin Feng's Metal Demon Wall?!\" A pale face Liu Xi spit out between gnashed teeth.The Metal Demon Wall that no four channel pract.i.tioner had been able to break had now been shattered by a mere two channel Zhou Yuan. How could anyone not be stunned by this?Was this still the same crippled prince they knew?Qi Yue's gaze was tightly glued to the young figure on the nearby arena as murder surged in his eyes. In the past, he had treated Zhou Yuan as a joke, yet at this very moment, Qi Yue could genuinely feel a very faint feeling of threat.Cracking sounds could be heard as Qi Yue's five fingers tightened. His eyelids twitched as he muttered in a low and raspy voice, \"Could it be that the Zhou clan's crippled dragon really intends to rise from the ashes?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27 End of the Newcomer ExamPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe silence outside the arena continued for quite some time till it was eventually broken by thunderous cheers. The eyes of numerous boys and girls were filled with fire as they gazed at the thin figure on the stage. No one would have dreamt that this prince of theirs, who was rumoured to be incapable of opening his channels, would give such a miraculous performance today\u2026By now, all of them clearly believed that the past Zhou Yuan had merely been concealing his strength.Zhou Yuan merely smiled when he heard the cheers resounding below the stage. He cupped his hands together towards the audience before leaving the stage and walking towards Su Youwei.Upon seeing that Su Youwei had been unblinkingly staring at him all along, he could not help but chuckle and say, \"Oh? Have you been subdued by my charm?\"Su Youwei's face turned slightly red. She made a soft 'pshaw' sound before snorting. \"Your hiding skills are top tier.\"She had previously been all kinds of worried when she found out that Zhou Yuan and Lin Feng had been matched. Who could have expected that Zhou Yuan would have so many astonis.h.i.+ng cards up his sleeve, and that even Lin Feng would fall at his hands.\"It turns out that even Lin Feng is not your match. Looks like the number one position amongst the new students belongs to you.\"Zhou Yuan gave a nonchalant smile in response. He did not have much interest in being number one amongst the new batch of students. The reason for fighting this time was completely for the sake of entering the A cla.s.s and helping headmaster Chu stabilize his position.After all, the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute was of paramount importance to the Great Zhou royal clan.His original goal had been to enter the top ten nad now that it had been achieved, he did not have much interest in the following matches. Moreover, even Lin Feng had been defeated by him. Hence, there was naturally nothing to worry about for the next few matches.These thoughts were swirling in Zhou Yuan's mind when he suddenly raised his head and looked towards the nearby tall platform. He was just in time to see Qi Yue's black to the maximum face, and immediately showed a small smile to the latter.Upon seeing Zhou Yuan's smile, Qi Yue's face grew even uglier. Power surged in his hands as the railing was once again crushed. He had utilised all kinds of methods to make sure that Zhou Yuan's face was to be thoroughly smeared into the ground. Yet, who could have expected that everything he had done would instead end up growing Zhou Yuan's reputation. This undoubtedly made Qi Yue extremely furious.By the side, Liu Xi hatefully said through gnashed teeth, \"Truly someone who loses control due to joy. Does he really believe that defeating Lin Feng gives him the right to do as he please in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute?!\"Both she and her Liu clan belonged to the Qi Manor camp. Hence seeing Qi Yue thwarted naturally made her angry at Zhou Yuan.\"It is just a newcomer exam. Even if he takes the number one position, he will only be considered average amongst the various cla.s.ses. Does he not know that even Lin Feng does not have the guts to make any moves in front of you?\" Liu Xi disdainfully glanced at Zhou Yuan as she consoled Qi Yue.Qi Yue took in a deep breath, suppressing the rage in his heart. His face regained its cold and detached look as he said, \"Don't worry. It will be useless even if he enters the A cla.s.s. Once the end-of-year cla.s.s ranking exam comes, I will personally beat him into the mud once again. When that happens, the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute will also end up in Qi Manor's hands.\"Upon seeing Qi Yue recover, Liu Xi also nodded. She did not doubt Qi Yue's words. Even though the strength Zhou Yuan had displayed today was astonis.h.i.+ng, one must know that the current Qi Yue had already opened six meridian channels, and would grow even stronger by the end of the year.Thus, compared to Qi Yue, Zhou Yuan still substantially lacking.Although she did not know why Zhou Yuan would suddenly spring up, from what Liu Xi could see, Qi Yue was the true pride of the heavens. The crippled prince and the Great Zhou royal clan would ultimately be trampled under Qi Yue's and Qi Manor's feet.With such thoughts in mind, she rather looked forward to their future confrontation. Would Zhou Yuan still be able to smile in such a pleased manner when he was crushed under Qi Yue's feet?On the field, the exam continued. However, after Zhou Yuan's and Lin Feng's intense battle, the other fights seemed rather lackl.u.s.tre.Fortunately, the exam finally came to an end after one last big battle.On the viewing platform, Chu Tianyang watched the exam reach its end and nodded his head in satisfaction. Both Zhou Yuan and Su Youwei had made it to the top ten, a fact that made him especially happy.After all, he had originally only placed his hopes in Su Youwei. Who would have imagined that Zhou Yuan would suddenly become so ferocious that even Lin Feng would be defeated at his hands. Moreover, he knew that Zhou Yuan's had only been engaging in channel opening training for a month.Two channels in a month of training and battle power that surpa.s.sed even the four channel Lin Feng. Such talent was likely even greater than Su Youwei's.How could Chu Tianyang not be overjoyed by an unexpected haul like this. He now had a little confidence in the originally completely hopeless year-end cla.s.s ranking exam.\"Now that the newcomer exam has concluded, next up will be the cla.s.s allocation. You may select your cla.s.s as long as you meet the conditions.\" Chu Tianyang gazed at the numerous boys and girls on the field as his powerful voice boomed in everyone's ears.His gaze first looked towards the top ten new students. \"The top ten may enter the A cla.s.s. Are any of you willing?\"At this moment, Xu Hong walked to Chu Tianyang's side and added in with a superficial smile, \"If any of you desire, you may enter my B cla.s.s. You should also know that my B cla.s.s has placed first in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute for the past two years.\"Anger rose in Chu Tianyang's eyes, but what Xu Hong said was true and he could only let out a snort.\"I hope to enter the B cla.s.s.\"\"I shall also enter the B cla.s.s.\"\".\u2026..\"In the wake of Xu Hong's words, several voices immediately rang out simultaneously. A total of seven people amongst the top ten indicated that they wished to enter the B cla.s.s. It was obvious that these people had been bought over by Qi Yue's generous promises long ago.Although Chu Tianyang had antic.i.p.ated this, his face could not help but turn somewhat green. After all, practically every person who ranked amongst the top ten would chose the A cla.s.s several years ago. Yet, only two or three would make the same decision in the present.Xu Hong let out two hearty chuckles when he saw Chu Tianyang's ugly expression. \"Alright, since that is that case, all of you will be part of my B cla.s.s from now on.\"\"I'm entering the A cla.s.s.\" It was at this moment that Zhou Yuan calmly declared, interrupting Xu Hong's loud laughter.\"I will also enter the A cla.s.s.\" Said Su Youwei without any hesitation.The final person hesitated for a moment before finally choosing the A cla.s.s.Upon seeing that the two most outstanding individuals of this newcomer exam had chosen to enter the A cla.s.s, Xu Hong's pleased expression receded a little as he brushed his sleeves with an icy snort.Chu Tianyang's expression seemed to ease somewhat as he turned towards Zhou Yuan, Su Youwei and the third person. \"Since that is so, you three will be part of my A cla.s.s after today.\"\"The rest of my fellow cla.s.s masters may begin to recruit your members.\"Chu Tianyang looked towards the other cla.s.s masters. After the ten best seedlings had been allocated, the remaining students would be divided amongst the other cla.s.ses.The martial practice field was a abuzz with activity. Things only quietened down a long while later when all the new students had been split into the various cla.s.ses.\"Today's newcomer exam is formally over. After today, everyone will enter their respective cla.s.ses to train. Do not slack off.\" Headmaster Chu's deep voice boomed.On the field, the many boys and girls respectfully responded.After all these matters were settled, headmaster Chu glanced in the direction of Zhou Yuan and Su Youwei, giving them a slight nod before turning around to leave.The field was bustling with noise and excitement. Numerous girls and boys were exceptionally happy. After today, they would finally leave behind their new student status and become true members of the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute.After all, the treatment of new students and true students would be as different as black and white.Zhou Yuan called out to Su Youwei, planning to leave, but suddenly raised his head as if sensing something. On the tall platform nearby, an expressionless Qi Yue glanced at the former, his eyes flickering with spookily cold light, before he turned and left.Zhou Yuan watched him leave with eyes that were similarly frosty, while his five slender fingers curled and unfurled. He knew that the war with Qi Yue was not over just because the newcomer exam had ended. Instead, the struggle between them would grow even fiercer after he entered the A cla.s.s.However, Zhou Yuan did not fear any of this. He knew that Qi Manor intended to take the headmaster position and as the prince of Great Zhou, he naturally would not allow them to succeed.He could not deal with the likes of king Qi for the time being, but Qi Yue on the other hand would be an opponent Zhou Yuan would properly duel in the following days.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He beamed as he looked towards Zhou Yuan and chuckled, \"You might not know but Chu Tianyang specially made a trip to the palace and praised you a whole lot.\"Evidently, he was aware of Zhou Yuan's performance in the newcomer exam today.By the side, Qin Yu was practically glowing as she looked at Zhou Yuan, her eyes similarly filled with joy.Zhou Yuan ate his food and merely smiled in response to Zhou Qing's and Qin Yu's praise as he said, \"It's only a newcomer exam. The important one is the cla.s.s ranking exam at the end of the year.\"Zhou Qing nodded upon hearing this and gleefully said, \"No arrogance after victory. Brat, your years of suffering have not been in vain.\"\"The year-end cla.s.s ranking exam is indeed very important.\"Zhou Qing slowly continued, \"Qi Manor has been eyeing the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute and have secretly schemed for a long time. If they are allowed to take the number one spot in the year-end cla.s.s ranking exam again, I'm afraid that they will begin to make things difficult.\"Cold light flashed in Zhou Qing's eyes. It was clear that he hated Qi Manor to the extreme.Qin Yu tenderly looked at Zhou Yuan and said in a somewhat hesitant manner, \"But that Qi Yue has already opened six meridian channels and will likely become even stronger by the end of the year. Yuan'er's starting point is much later than his\u2026\"To make up for the gap between them, Zhou Yuan had to put in a tremendous amount of hard work.Contrary to expectation, Zhou Yuan's expression remained undisturbed. He smiled at Qin Yu and said, \"Don't worry mother and father. I will not let them have their way.\"Due to being unable to locate his meridian channels, the past him could only hide beneath his father's wings. Now that he was able to cultivate, Zhou Yuan would naturally give his best effort to share some of the pressure his father was facing.He clearly understood how dangerous the current situation was for Great Zhou.Zhou Qing and Qin Yu felt gratified when they saw Zhou Yuan's sensibility. However, the feelings of self-blame and heartache were greater. If they had realised king Wu's plot in advance back then, Great Zhou would not have fallen to such a state and Zhou Yuan would not have to shoulder these burdens at his tender age.Zhou Yuan sensed Zhou Qing's and Qin Yu's gloomy moods and immediately changed the topic. \"Truthfully speaking, my success in the exam is mostly thanks to big sis Yaoyao's guidance.\"By the side, when the silently dining Yaoyao with Tuntun on her lap heard these words, her gaze lightly swept across Zhou Yuan as if unhappy that he had s.h.i.+fted the attention to her.Zhou Qing nodded upon hearing this and smiled. \"Miss Yaoyao is indeed our benefactor. Come, I'll toast a cup to you.\"The moment he said this, Qin Yu's displeased glare arrived. In her eyes, Yaoyao was still a young girl and Zhou Qing's actions were practically leading her astray.However, before she could speak, the eyes of the originally silent Yaoyao brightened slightly as she raised her wine cup and drained it in a single gulp.Zhou Qing was stunned. He glanced at Qin Yu, seeing her displeased gaze and awkwardly laughed before quickly finis.h.i.+ng the wine in his cup. After which, he no longer dared to speak of toasting.\u2026Qi Manor.An oil lamp burned within a study, spreading dusky yellow light.A middle-aged man in yellow robes sat upright behind a desk, expressionless as he flipped through the books. A cold and stern aura rose from between his brows, while a faint pressure spread outwards, causing no one to dare to underestimate this individual.Qi Yue stood in front of the desk, his hands hanging by his side while his face respectful.\"You say that crippled prince is now able to engage in channel opening cultivation?\" After a long silence, the middle-aged man in yellow finally s.h.i.+fted his gaze away from his books and dully said.\"Yes father. He has defeated the four channel Lin Feng with the strength of two channels.\" Qi Yue immediately responded.This middle-aged man in yellow robes was king Qi of Great Zhou, Qi Yuan.King Qi's eyes narrowed slightly like a viper as he slowly said, \"As expected of the one who once possessed the sacred dragon blessing. He can still crawl up even after being crippled to such an extent. Such tenacity.\"Killing intent flitted across Qi Yue's eyes. \"Father, do we send news of this to the Wu Empire?\"King Qi mumbled to himself for a while before shaking his head. \"The Wu Empire is currently engaged in war with two neighbouring empires. How could they possibly spare any time for a Great Zhou on the verge of death. As for the crippled prince, his sacred dragon blessing was taken and he even received backlash in the form of the Dragon's Resentment Poison. It is not so easy for him to recover. His current state is probably akin to the final radiance of a dying star.\"Qi Yue nodded upon hearing this. Zhou Yuan had been crippled far too greatly back then. Clawing his way back up would indeed be difficult.\"Moreover, even if he is really able to crawl back up, do you believe that I, Qi Yuan, will be afraid of a hairless brat?\" Qi Yuan coldly chuckled before continuing, \"I've prepared for so many years, and even Zhou Qing does not dare to do anything to me now. How can a mere two channel brat possibly alter the grand scheme of things?\"\"If we have to inform Great Wu of a mere crippled prince, it will instead make them look down on us. If that happens, even if we take over Great Zhou in future, they will believe that we succeeded with little effort.\"Qi Yuan threw the book in his hand onto the table as he continued, \"As long as the B cla.s.s takes the number one position in the year-end cla.s.s ranking exam, the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute will be mine. That is most important.\"\"Therefore, you must take first place in the year-end cla.s.s ranking exam.\"In response to Qi Yuan's gaze, Qi Yue nodded without the slightest shred of hesitation and confidently said, \"Relax father. No one in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute will be able to compete with me in the year-end cla.s.s ranking exam.\"\"As for Zhou Yuan, if he does not tactfully back down, I will crippled him again and see if he is still able to crawl back up!\"As he spoke, a sinister smile emerged from the corners of his lips.\u2026The next day.In the early morning, Zhou Yuan continued his uninterrupted practice of the ninety eight frolicking dragon forms before proceeding to the daily channel unblocking.After finis.h.i.+ng, he washed his body and left the royal palace, heading straight for the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute.Now that he had entered the A cla.s.s, he could not longer frequently miss cla.s.ses like before.Great Zhou Inst.i.tute, A cla.s.s courtyard.A dozen figures were gathered in a s.p.a.cious lecture yard, the atmosphere abuzz with noise and excitement.When Zhou Yuan, Su Youwei and the other new student entered, the dozen gazes in the yard turned towards them, filled with curiosity and antic.i.p.ation.The Zhou Yuan trio were taken aback by such attention.While they were stunned, two figures in the lecture yard walked over, one male, the other female. The young man's body looked strong and st.u.r.dy, and his skin was a little tanned. A smile decorated his rather rough-looking face, making him appear like a straightforward individual.The young lady was rather pretty. Although she could not compare to Su Youwei, her long and slender legs were quite eye-catching.The tanned and straightforward-looking youth smiled at the Zhou Yuan trio and said, \"Hehe, welcome you three. I am the cla.s.s head of the A cla.s.s, Yang Zai.\"\"I am Song Qiushui.\" The pretty girl winked at the trio, smiling happily as she continued, \"We found out yesterday that your highness Zhou Yuan and the rest of you chose the A cla.s.s, so here we are today waiting for you guys.\"She looked towards Su Youwei and pursed her smiling lips, \"Of course, those fellows are more likely looking forward to meeting the number one beauty of our Great Zhou Inst.i.tute.\"Upon hearing her teasing, Su Youwei's fair face blushed a little. Her enchanting appearance drew the dumbstruck stares of quite a few boys in the yard.Yang Zai chuckled as he looked at Zhou Yuan and said, \"Your highness' performance in the newcomer exam yesterday has already spread throughout the entire inst.i.tute. With you three joining the A cla.s.s, our power and fame will definitely rise.\"Zhou Yuan cupped his hands together and smiled. \"There is no 'your highness' here, call me Zhou Yuan.\"Yang Zai was a little taken aback by Zhou Yuan's placid mannerisms, but quickly showed a simple-looking smile as he nodded his head. \"Since your highness says so, we will feel free to do so.\"The group introduced themselves to each other and the A cla.s.s members were swiftly acquainted. These older students were also youths and were both kind and friendly. Thus, there was no case of 'putting the new students in their place' and the group quickly grew closer after getting to know each other.It was in this time that Zhou Yuan came to know that Yang Zai was the number one individual in the A cla.s.s, hence his election as cla.s.s head. He had opened five meridian channels and while Song Qiushui was slightly weaker, she too had opened five meridian channels.Such strength was indeed inferior to Qi Yue. No wonder Chu Tianyang constantly worried about the year-end cla.s.s ranking exam.While the group was getting to know each other better, Chu Tianyang walked into the yard and coughed softly, immediately causing the many noisy boys and girls to quieten down as they respectfully said, \"Greetings cla.s.s master.\"Chu Tianyang nodded in acknowledgement. \"From today, there will be three more members in our A cla.s.s. You guys should have already acquainted yourselves with them right?\"The many boys and girls responded with a yes.\"Good. From today, your training will be doubled.\" Chu Tianyang indifferently declared with his hands behind his back.The moment these words were heard, a series of complaints and grumbling erupted.Chu Tianyang coldly snorted, suppressing the various noises as he raised his voice. \"The year-end cla.s.s ranking exam is not far off. If you guys still do not put in more effort in training and no one is able to reach six channels by the end of the year, you won't even have the qualifications to vie with others. When that happens, the A cla.s.s will become the B cla.s.s. What face will you guys have left then?!\"Ashamed looked emerged on the students faces after being chided as they hastily lowered their heads, while the strongest Yang Zai and Song Qiushui let out a bitter laugh. Though they had done all they could to catch up, the momentum was currently with the B cla.s.s and Qi Yue was just too formidable, firmly suppressing them from start to end.Upon seeing that everyone no longer dared to speak, Chu Tianyang's expression relaxed as he said, \"Everyone make your preparations, the Jade Spirit Waterfall opens today. I hope that no one will delay us.\"The moment these words were said, the eyes of the many boys and girls in the yard abruptly brightened as their faces filled with excitement.\"Jade Spirit Waterfall\u2026\"Zhou Yuan's heart trembled slightly when he heard this as interest and curiosity was revealed in his eyes.He had long heard father mention a cultivation treasure land in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute, which was the 'Jade Spirit Waterfall' that Chu Tianyang had spoken of.This was also one of the main reasons why Zhou Yuan was unwilling to miss any cla.s.ses after entering the A cla.s.s.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 Jade Spirit WaterfallPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the mountains behind the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute was a lush and verdant mountain peak where a silver-river-like waterfall was located. The rumbling sounds of cras.h.i.+ng water spread throughout the entire mountain range. It was a very majestic sight indeed.Zhou Yuan, Su Youwei and the rest of the A cla.s.s students were currently standing below the waterfall where a giant lake lay, its waters as clear as a mirror.\"So this is the Jade Spirit Waterfall?\"Su Youwei gazed at the falling torrent of water, curiosity all over her face. It was clear that She had heard of it before.Song Qiushui nodded from the side as she said with a grin, \"This is the cultivation treasure land of our Great Zhou Inst.i.tute, the Jade Spirit Waterfall. It is said that there is a patch of purple spirit quartz growing at the top of the waterfall, and the water that flows down contains a sliver of extremely gentle quartz energy. When the powerful force of the waterfall strikes the body, the quartz energy within will be pushed into the body which helps us unblock our meridian channels.\"\"Of course, the most important aspect is that this extremely gentle quartz energy will not damage our meridian channels. So even if our meridian channels have reached the daily limits of the usual unblocking method, we will still be able to make use of the Jade Spirit Waterfall for channel opening training.\"Exceptional splendour instantly blossomed in Su Youwei's eyes when she heard this. Due to the threshold of the meridian channels, there was a limit to the number of daily channel unblocking sessions for each individual. Yet, this Jade Spirit Waterfall before their eyes was able to help them unblock their channels without harming them even after the channels had reached their limit. This point alone allowed one to understand the value of the Jade Spirit Waterfall.Zhou Yuan also smiled and nodded. This was why he regarded the Jade Spirit Waterfall as important. After completing several rounds of channel unblocking sessions each day, his channels would reach their limit, but with the aid of this Jade Spirit Waterfall, he would be able to continue unblocking his channels.There was no doubt that this would speed up his training.\"However, the Jade Spirit Waterfall needs to absorb the natural Genesis Qi of the land to provide a steady stream of quartz energy. Hence, it only opens for use once every two days.\"Yang Zai chuckled at Zhou Yuan and Su Youwei before continuing, \"You guys are pretty lucky to come across such a chance the moment your enter the A cla.s.s.\"Zhou Yuan seemed to ponder as he gazed at that waterfall that contained faint dashes of purple. \"How is the time allocated?\"There was only one Jade Spirit Waterfall after all, while the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute had five cla.s.ses and several hundred students. It was evidently impossible for everyone to enter the Jade Spirit Waterfall together for training. Thus, there was definitely some sort of allocation.Yang Zai explained, \"The Jade Spirit Waterfall is open for 16 hours. According to the rules, our A cla.s.s is allocated 6 hours, the B cla.s.s 4 hours and the other cla.s.ses 2 hours. Because we are the A cla.s.s, both the amount of time and our time slot is the best.\"Zhou Yuan nodded in understanding. Soon after, he clicked his tongue and said, \"To think that we only have 6 hours.\"Yang Zai let out a gentle chuckle. \"6 hours is already a lot. Moreover, you might not be able to last that long.\"\"Eh?\" Zhou Yuan was taken aback.Yang Zai laughed mischievously but did not elaborate. He merely said, \"You will find out later.\"\"Alright, no more nonsense. Prepare to enter the rooms and get your Genesis Runes inscribed.\" At the front, Chu Tianyang clapped his hands together, interrupting everyone's conversations. He pointed towards the nearby lakeside where two large bamboo rooms where located.\"We need to get Genesis Runes inscribed?\" Zhou Yuan and Su Youwei were stunned upon hearing this.Song Qiushui explained, \"Yes. Every time we come to the Jade Spirit Waterfall to train, the inst.i.tute will dispatch teachers proficient in Genesis Runes to draw a Genesis Gathering Rune for every student. It is a grade 1 Genesis Rune that increases the effectiveness of absorbing quartz energy from the waterfall,\"They arrived at the bamboo rooms while conversing. There were two bamboo rooms, one for the guys and the other for the girls. Everyone lined up to enter, but while the male students were queuing up, s.h.i.+fty gazes would shoot towards the girls room from time to time.Zhou Yuan's turn quickly arrived. He entered the room and saw an instructor holding a Genesis Rune Brush waving at him, indicating for him to shed his clothes and lie on the bench provided. The tip of the brush descended and gradually drew a Genesis Rune on Zhou Yuan's back. In the wake of the final stroke, a faint glow emerged from Zhou Yuan's back before concealing itself. When the Genesis Rune was complete, Zhou Yuan felt that he had become much more sensitive to the surrounding Genesis Qi.\"This Genesis Gathering Rune is not much different than the Genesis Gathering Jade other than the fact that it lasts for only a short while.\" Zhou Yuan put on his clothes and bowed towards the instructor before walking out.At the mention of the Genesis Gathering Jade, Zhou Yuan lowered his head to look at the warm jade pendant hanging from his neck. Ever since Su Youwei found out that he was able to engage in channel opening training, she had insisted on returning it to him, a matter he felt particularly helpless about.However, he understood her stubborn character. Thus, Zhou Yuan did not push it.After exiting the bamboo room, Zhou Yuan happened to see Su Youwei walking out. He walked over and stealthily glanced at her back. Past her fair neck, he was able to see some portions of a faintly glowing rune.\"Where do you think you are looking!\" Su Youwei's pretty face blushed a little as she glared at him when she sensed his gaze.Zhou Yuan chuckled. He cast a glance at the stream of girls exiting the bamboo room one after another and could not help but ask, \"Is it also a male instructor over there?\"If that was the case, it would really be too huge of a loss!Su Youwei lightly stamped on Zhou Yuan's foot in a humiliated and angry manner as she bit down on her teeth and said, \"What nonsense are you saying! Of course it's a lady!\"One's clothes needed to be taken off when inscribing a Genesis Rune on the body. It would be too outrageous if a male instructor was allowed to do this deed for the girls.Zhou Yuan let out a hollow laugh. The banter between the two had drawn all of the other A cla.s.s students over. Chu Tianyang also shot a glance at them before turning around to lead everyone to the waterfall.Rumble!The enormous waterfall was akin to a roaring water dragon. Water pounded downwards into the lake, causing huge waves to rise and vapor to fill the air.Chu Tianyang took out a large incense stick and lit it before placing it in a crevice between the rocks beside him. Next, he sternly looked towards the group and said, \"Get ready. You only have 6 hours. I hope that none of you will waste this chance.\"As he spoke, he looked towards Zhou Yuan, Su Youwei and the other new student before continuing, \"You three wait here first and observe.\"The Zhou Yuan trio nodded and looked towards Yang Zai, Song Qiushui and the rest. Their gazes were both expectant and somewhat fearful as they looked at the Jade Spirit Waterfall. In the end, they took in a deep breath, gritted their teeth and charged into the training platform in the middle of the waterfall.Rumble!A boundless torrent roared as it fell. Yang Zai and gang dashed into the waterfall, their legs powerfully gripping the rock below them as they allowed the water the pound onto their bodies.The force from such a gigantic waterfall was undoubtedly tremendous. Therefore, the bodies of Yao Zai and the rest shook even though they were using all of their strength.They tightly gritted their teeth as torrents of water smashed into their bodies. It was akin to being continuously slapped, causing their faces to distort somewhat in pain.The Genesis Runes on their backs emitted a faint glow as wisps of purple energy seemed to flow into their bodies while the water crashed down upon them.Rumble!Numerous students endured the battering of the waterfall. This lasted for about a ten minutes before some began to waver. In the end, the students were washed into the lake below one after another with a respective shriek.Yang Zai and Song Qiushui persisted the longest, but were only able to last for slightly over twenty minutes before falling into the lake.When they crawled out from the lake, their skin was bruised black and green as if they had been beaten. From their miserable grimacing appearances, it was obvious that their entire bodies were in pain.Only now did Zhou Yuan understand why they both loved and hated the Jade Spirit Waterfall. Though the quartz energy was admittedly able to help unblock their meridian channels, they would be bruised all over by the water each time. It was akin to receiving a series of vicious beatings.Chu Tianyang said to Zhou Yuan, Su Youwei and the other remaining student, \"You three are up next.\"\"Heh heh, good luck. The first time always ends rather quickly.\" Yang Zai mischievously chuckled at Zhou Yuan.Zhou Yuan exchanged a look with Su Youwei before they advanced, stopping in front of the waterfall as they watched the thundering waters descend. In the end, they gritted their teeth and took a step in.Zhou Yuan's skin tensed the moment he entered the waterfall, while his feet were akin to the roots of a great tree and tightly gripped the ground. A split second later, he felt an enormous force accompanied by water slam down onto him from above and engulf his entire body.\"How painful!\"The boundless torrent viciously pummelled him, causing Zhou Yuan to gasp. Such power was really too brutal and had almost swatted him into the lake.However, as the water pounded him, Zhou Yuan could faintly feel a suction force emerge from the Genesis Gathering Rune on his back as an extremely gentle energy flowed into his body.The appearance of the gentle energy slightly alleviated the intense pain.\"Is this quartz energy?\" Zhou Yuan's heart shook. He had indeed felt the third meridian channel in his body loosen a little in that brief moment.Upon sensing such a change, Zhou Yuan immediately braced himself, gritting his teeth as he endured the battering water and greedily absorbed tiny bits of quartz energy from within.AAHHH!While Zhou Yuan was tenaciously holding on with gritted teeth, a cry was heard from the side. The new student could endure no longer and had been swept into the lake by an enormous torrent of water.Zhou Yuan sneaked a peak from the corner of his eye and saw the faint silhouette of Su Youwei's lovely figure tottering on the verge of collapse under the rampaging water. However, she bitterly persisted.\"This quartz energy is indeed very effective! However it's a pity that it's somewhat spa.r.s.e.\" Thoughts spun in Zhou Yuan's head. If he was able to absorb more quartz energy, he should be able to fully alleviate the physical pain due to the boundless flowing water. If that happened, he would be able to endure longer.However, the Jade Spirit Waterfall was wide and the water that crashed down onto his body would at most contain a wisp of quartz energy. It was not likely for him to have more.When his thoughts reached this point, Zhou Yuan could not help but shake his head. Soon after however, an idea struck him. The other students might be unable to sense the quartz energy, but it may not be so for himself. His Spirit had already reached the Illusory stage and it was likely that no one at the Channel Opening stage could compare to him with regards to sensing ability.\"I'll give it a try!\"Zhou Yuan closed his eyes without hesitation. The Spirit between his brows began to stir as his senses spread outwards. The thundering sound of water became silent and Zhou Yuan was able to clearly sense strands of purple energy swimming within the endlessly falling waterfall.\"I can indeed sense the quartz energy!\"Pleasant surprise rose in Zhou Yuan's heart. He nudged his Spirit with a thought and a strange glow appeared between his brows. One could faintly see a translucent figure seated there. It was Zhou Yuan's Spirit.A suction force emerged from the illusory figure. This suction force was not strong, but it was focused and only targeted the purple strands of flowing energy.While Zhou Yuan was using his Spirit to absorb the purple energy, a faint purple glow emerged from the water that was continuously battering his body and steadily tunnelled into his body.Zhou Yuan's slightly shut eyes suddenly opened at this moment as they filled with wild joy and excitement. In that brief moment earlier, he had felt the amount of quartz energy flowing into his body multiply a dozen fold!\"To think that it actually works!\"As Zhou Yuan felt the increasingly loosening third meridian channel in his body, he could not help but jump in excitement.Cras.h.!.+However, this jump immediately separated himself from the ground. Water slammed into him and with a crash, Zhou Yuan was viciously swatted into the lake below amidst a miserable yelp.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30 Opening the Third Meridian ChannelPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPlop!Zhou Yuan's excited face emerged from the lake waters. His eyes seemed to burn with pa.s.sion as he look at the giant Jade Spirit Waterfall. He never imagined that using the power of his Spirit would actually help him absorb the nearby quartz energy.Others were only able to absorb quartz energy from the water that hit their bodies, but he had the ability to consciously absorb and his range was much greater. The difference between the two need not be said.\"At this rate, I will be able to unblock my third meridian channel in a few days!\"According to Zhou Yuan's estimates, he would likely need half a month or so to unblock his third meridian channel. Yet, that estimation had now been shortened by more than half. From this, one could tell just how effective the Jade Spirit Waterfall was.\"This is the benefit brought by a Illusory stage Spirit.\"Zhou Yuan could not help but sigh. Other students did not know any Spirit tempering methods, hence, their Spirit could not possibly be as strong as his which naturally led to being unable to sense the quartz energy or consciously absorb it.Plop!While Zhou Yuan was happily sighing, a figure also fell into the water beside him. A head emerged, revealing Su Youwei. Her pretty face was rather pale and bruises could be seen all over her fair wrist.Zhou Yuan's gaze continued its path downwards before it came to a point where he could no longer turn away as a wave of heat seemed to surge up his nose.Due to the water, Su Youwei's clothes were wet and tightly hugged her lovely figure, causing her exquisitely enchanting curves to show. He could even faintly see her fair skin that glowed with the radiance of youth.Cras.h.!.+However, before Zhou Yuan could get a better look, water splashed into his face. His raised his gaze, only to find Su Youwei glaring at him with a beet-red face.Zhou Yuan gave a hollow laugh.Su Youwei tightly gritted her pearly-white teeth. This fellow was really adept when it came to taking advantage of others. If it was anyone else, she would have long sent a slap flying over. However, she could not gather any hate for Zhou Yuan and only felt bashful and angry.\"Hooligan!\"Su Youwei pushed with her hands, causing a wave of water to crash into Zhou Yuan's head. At the same time, she used the resultant force to gracefully fly out of the water, nimbly landing at the edge of the lake as Genesis Qi light flowed around her body, rapidly evaporating the water in her wet clothes.An even more drenched Zhou Yuan helplessly shook his head before also leaving the lake, landing on an empty spot nearby.Happiness was revealed in Chu Tianyang's eyes when he looked at the two of them as he praised, \"Not bad. The two of you persevered for about ten minutes. That's a pretty good time for a first timer.\"With the exception of Yang Zai and Song Qiushui, the majority of the older cla.s.s A members had only managed to endure for roughly ten minutes. Thus, Zhou Yuan's and Su Youwei's performance was pretty good for new students that had come into contact with the Jade Spirit Waterfall for the first time.By the side, the faces of Yang Zai, Song Qiushui and the rest of the older students were filled with amazement as they looked at the two. Though they were not too surprised by Su Youwei's achievement because she was after all a four channel pract.i.tioner, it was different for Zhou Yuan. The latter had only opened two channels, yet his tolerance level was not any weaker than a four channel opener.\"Hehe, if such a pathetic time can be considered pretty good, the Jade Spirit Waterfall has truly been squandered.\" While they were sighing in amazement, a sneer was suddenly heard, causing the atmosphere to pause for a moment. Subsequently, angry gazes turned towards the direction of the sound one by one.However, they froze when they saw who had spoken.Zhou Yuan's brow furrowed slightly. He raised his head, only to find that a large group of people had arrived at some unknown time. At the front of the group, a handsome Qi Yue stood straightly with his hands behind his back, giving off a dignified aura. Beside him was the beautiful and eye-catching Liu Xi. Disdain was currently visible on her face as she stared at the members of the A cla.s.s. It was she who had spoken earlier.The rest of the B cla.s.s students also showed contempt on their faces as if looking down upon the performance of the many A cla.s.s students.\"The B cla.s.s.\" Yang Zai's face was riddled with fury while the others were also br.i.m.m.i.n.g with rage due to the undeserved remark. To come and criticize them even during their training was a really intolerable act.Zhou Yuan's eyes turned a little frosty as he swept a glance at Liu Xi and said in a flat voice, \"May I ask how long you lasted in the Jade Spirit Waterfall during your first time?\"Liu Xi's pretty face turned rigid. She was clearly angered but was unable to reply.Qi Yue smiled superficially as he interjected, \"There's no need for your highness to lower yourself to her level. I'm not too clear on how long Liu Xi managed to endure during her first time, but I recall that I persisted for 30 minutes for mine.\"Although they knew that Qi Yue was doing this on purpose, Yang Zai, Song Qiushui and the many A cla.s.s members were incapable of retorting and felt a little dejected. Qi Yue's first time had already been 30 minutes, while they on the other hand were barely able to achieve a time of slightly over 20 minutes even till now.With an abnormality like Qi Yue in the B cla.s.s, will their A cla.s.s ever be able to rise up again?The morale of the A cla.s.s was a little low for a time.\"Do you guys still intend to train?!\" While they were silent, Chu Tianyang's stern voice boomed through the air. He looked towards Qi Yue and the rest and said with an expressionless face, \"If it is not the B cla.s.s' turn, do not come here and disturb others' training or you will be punished!\"The B cla.s.s students shrunk back in response to Chu Tianyang's chilly gaze. Only Qi Yue remained unaffected as he replied with a nonchalant smile, \"No need to get angry headmaster, we have only a.s.sembled here in advance to wait for our turn at the Jade Spirit Waterfall. If just watching will interfere with their training, the A cla.s.s students would really be a little too delicate.\"The A cla.s.s students hatefully gritted their teeth upon hearing the mockery hidden in his words.Chu Tianyang swept a cold glance at Qi Yue before withdrawing his gaze and saying in a loud voice, \"Continue training!\"When they heard this, Yang Zai and the rest turned around and headed for the Jade Spirit Waterfall again. However, there was now a rather depressed mood hanging around them.\"That guy is really loathsome.\" Su Youwei muttered in a low voice. The originally pretty good atmosphere had completely ruined by Qi Yue's arrival.Zhou Yuan gently tapped his fingers in the air as he looked towards Qi Yue and said, \"Is half an hour considered long?\"After speaking, he did not say anything else but instead turned around and walked towards the Jade Spirit Waterfall. Since Qi Yue had decided to use such an underhanded tactic to lower the A cla.s.s' morale, Zhou Yuan could not possibly allow him to get away with it.\"Tch, what a sharp tongue! Look at him, does he really believe he can compare to you?\" Liu Xi could not help but let out a laugh of contempt as she watched Zhou Yuan's leaving figure. It was obvious that she had taken his words as a stubborn refusal to admit defeat.Zhou Yuan's performance in the exam was not bad, but he should see who he was competing him. Qi Yue was after all currently the strongest student in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute.Qi Yue smiled, a smile that was filled with a toying sensation. \"Then I'll have to take a good look later on. However, I do hope that he tries to show off since he will be the one that suffers in the end.\"The other B cla.s.s members agreed with a nod. Likewise, they did not know exactly what qualifications a two channel pract.i.tioner like Zhou Yuan believed he had to entertain the notion that he could compete with Qi Yue.Under the expectant gazes of the B cla.s.s group, Zhou Yuan once again arrived before the Jade Spirit Waterfall. He gazed at the endlessly falling torrent of water and took a step in without the slightest shred of hesitation.Boom!With his body now within the waterfall, Zhou Yuan's legs bent slightly, tightly gripping the ground. The raging water smashed down onto him as he closed his eyes and the Spirit between his brows began to vibrate.A suction force that was difficult to detect for ordinary individuals stealthily emerged. Wisps of quartz energy immediately converged over from the curtain of water, slapping onto his body along with the violent water.The Genesis Gathering Rune on his back emitted a glow as it unceasingly absorbed each strand of quartz energy into his body.Strands of gentle and cooling energy shuttled within Zhou Yuan's body, substantially relieving the intense pain wherever it pa.s.sed.Zhou Yuan's originally somewhat wobbly body gradually grew stable. No matter how the waterfall crashed down onto him, his body remained unmoving like a boulder.At the same time, strands of quartz energy surged in his body, continuously attacking his third meridian channel, causing it to become looser and looser.Cras.h.!.+ Cras.h.!.+Students once again fell into the lake one after another. Perhaps because of their low morale, the performance of many students was even worse than earlier, the time they were able to endure shorter.At the lakeside, Chu Tianyang's face turned stormy black as he watched this.On the other hand, the smiles on the faces of Qi Yue, Liu Xi and the rest of the B cla.s.s students grew wider and wider.Cras.h.!.+Su Youwei also fell into the water. She had endured for a whole 20 minutes this time, an achievement that made the A cla.s.s students exclaim in admiration. This timing was fast approaching Yang Zai's and Song Qiushui's.Su Youwei's performance also made Chu Tianyang's expression lighten a little.Almost immediately after Su Youwei, Yang Zai and Song Qiushui also landed in the water with an inward sigh. They were still unable to last 30 minutes.The entire group was silent as they left the water, bathed in a rather stifling atmosphere. Suddenly, Su Youwei's slightly alarmed voice sounded, \"Zhou Yuan is still up there?\"The group was stunned upon hearing this and their gazes turned towards the Jade Spirit Waterfall. Sure enough, they saw the faint silhouette of a figure within.Song Qiushui covered her mouth with a hand as she cried out, \"Zhou Yuan is about to reach 30 minutes?!\"Yang Zai scratched his head, a look of disbelief on his face.Unlike them, Su Youwei's eyebrows were knitted together, worry clouding her eyes. She was worried that Zhou Yuan was purposely pus.h.i.+ng himself over the limit and stubbornly holding on. If that was the case, it would instead hurt his body and affect his channel opening.\"Interesting.\" Qi Yue could not help but softly chuckle as he watched. The depths of his eyes were full of disdain as he stared at the faint silhouette in the waterfall. From what he could see, Zhou Yuan's stubbornness would only hurt himself.\"I'm interested to see just how long he can continue acting tough!\" Liu Xi sneered. Her pretty face had a gloating look on it.Hence, everyone's gazes were directed at the figure in the waterfall. They were so fixated that Su Youwei and the rest did not have the mood to climb up again and ended up standing there watching.Under their tense gazes, time swiftly flowed.30 minutes.40 minutes.\u2026An hour!By the time it reached an hour, everyone at the bank of the lake had become silent. Even Qi Yue's eyes had started to flicker in uncertainty, slowly frowning as unease gradually crept up inside him.The B cla.s.s students looked to each other. An hour. Besides Qi Yue, no one in their B cla.s.s could accomplish this. Furthermore, Qi Yue was a six channel pract.i.tioner!What about Zhou Yuan? Only two channels!Liu Xi tightly clenched her jaw and could not help but mumble, \"Could something have happened?\"Boom!Just as her words faded, a noise was heard from the waterfall. Everyone could only watch as Zhou Yuan's body finally fell, plunging head-first into the lake below.His figure emerged on the lake, but his eyes were tightly shut.Upon seeing this, Liu Xi immediately sneered. \"Looks like his injuries are not light.\"The moment her sneer appeared, Zhou Yuan suddenly opened his eyes. Everyone could see a stream of Genesis Qi light curl around his body, causing whirlpools to form in the surrounding lake waters.His sleeves flapped as a faint rumble spread from his body. Streams of Genesis Qi rushed into him, causing his aura to soar.\"This is?!\" The pupils of Qi Yue, Liu Xi and the rest shrunk when they saw this.\"How is this possible?!\"Su Youwei, Yang Zai, Song Qiushui also gasped.Chu Tianyang's face trembled with emotion. His eyes seemed to s.h.i.+ne as he stared at Zhou Yuan, pausing between each word as he mumbled, \"To think\u2026 he has actually unblocked his third meridian channel?!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31 Establishment of PowerPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the lake, Genesis Qi surged around Zhou Yuan's body. Streams of light seemed to flow on his skin as invisible undulations spread outwards, pus.h.i.+ng back the surrounding lake waters such that they were unable to flow back in.On the lake bank, everyone was wide-eyed and opened-mouth as they stared at him. This scene was very familiar to them. It was a scene that only appeared when one opened one's meridian channel.\"Opened his third channel? How is that possible!\" Green and white interlaced on Liu Xi's attractive face as a burning sensation washed over it. She had previously mocked Zhou Yuan for overdoing it. Who could have antic.i.p.ated that the latter would not only be uninjured, but even unblock his third meridian channel on the very spot!The expression in Qi Yue's eyes turned ominously stormy at this moment. His five fingers were tightly clenched as he stared at Zhou Yuan like a viper while rage boiled in his heart. He had similarly never imagined such an outcome.Moreover, what he could not fathom was how Zhou Yuan's mere two channel body could possible endure for an hour in the Jade Spirit Waterfall.\"How did he do it!\"The other B cla.s.s members were speechless as they looked to each other, evidently both intimidated and in awe of this scene.In the lake, bright light flashed in Zhou Yuan's tightly shut eyes as they slowly cracked open. He lowered his head, looking at the swirling Genesis Qi light surging around his body. Unrestrained joy bubbled in his heart as he felt the now completely unblocked third meridian channel.He too never expected that he would actually open his third meridian channel.According to his original estimate, he would need at least several days of training. However, he seemed to have somewhat underestimated the quartz energy of the Jade Spirit Waterfall. The tremendous amount of quartz energy absorbed had allowed him to unblock his third meridian channel today.\"Unfortunately, the quartz energy was likely so effective because it was my first time absorbing it. Once my body becomes accustomed to it, there will no longer be such quick and visible results.\" Zhou Yuan muttered to himself as joy was revealed in his eyes.Even so, opening his third meridian channel made Zhou Yuan exceptionally happy. After all, it had only been a few days since he had unblocked his second channel.With a soft inward chuckle, the tip of Zhou Yuan's foot pushed as his body flew to the lake bank. When he raised his head, he found everyone staring at him in complete silence.\"Clap clap!\"Applause suddenly rang out. Chu Tianyang's usually unsmiling and serious face was currently decorated by a warm smile. His eyes filled with emotion as he stared at Zhou Yuan and clapped.Su Youwei, Yang Zai, Song Qiushui and the rest came back to their senses and immediately started clapping too as their faces flooded with excitement.They had just earlier been intimidated by Qi Yue, causing their morale to plummet. Who could have imagined that Qi Yue's record would be broken by Zhou Yuan in the blink of an eye, even leaving the former far far behind.With a mere two channel body, he had persisted in the Jade Spirit Waterfall for an hour. This was something that had never happened before in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute.The crowd's clapping first stunned Zhou Yuan, but he soon broke out into a smile. Next, he lifted his head and his line of sight turned towards Qi Yue and the rest of the B cla.s.s students.Upon seeing Zhou Yuan look over, the B cla.s.s members seemed to shrink back as their faces burned. After all, they had been mocking him just moments ago and before they could even blink, their mockery had now turned on them.Liu Xi's steely-green face had twisted in an extremely ugly manner, but she could not utter even a single word. All she could do was bite down forcefully on her teeth.On the contrary, Qi Yue wore a dark expression as a sinister voice seeped out between the crevices of his teeth, \"Good, excellent. Your highness really surpa.s.ses one's expectations.\"Zhou Yuan swept an indifferent glance at Qi Yue and replied with a faint smile, \"Behave yourselves if you want to watch and stop trying to hold a drama here, we really don't have time to entertain you guys.\"The corners of Qi Yue's eyes twitched, but he ultimately took breathed in deeply, suppressing the rage in his heart. However, the eyes that looked towards Zhou Yuan had become increasingly menacing and cold.Zhou Yuan no longer bothered with Qi Yue after seeing this. He turned his head and smiled towards Su Youwei, Yang Zai, Song Qiushui and the rest as he said, \"Let's continue. There's not much time left.\"Of the 6 hours they had, almost half had pa.s.sed.\"Alright!\"Responded all the A cla.s.s students, their morale rapidly rising. The gazes that looked towards Zhou Yuan were much different than before.Before, there existed a tiny bit of the mentality of a senior student viewing a new student. However, not only had Zhou Yuan's accomplishment intimidated Qi Yue and the rest of the B cla.s.s, it had also made them, the A cla.s.s students, feel more respect for the former.By the side, Chu Tianyang secretly breathed a sigh of relief as he watched the A cla.s.s students regain their morale. The gaze with which he looked towards Zhou Yuan had subconsciously become increasingly pleased.Over the past year, Qi Yue was practically a boulder that weighed heavily in the hearts of all the A cla.s.s students, making them feel as if they would never be able to prevail over him. But Zhou Yuan had let everyone know today that it was not impossible to beat Qi Yue.As the saying went, there was always someone better. No one had been able to keep Qi Yue in check because that someone had yet to appear\u2026 but now\u2026That someone had perhaps finally appeared. Chu Tianyang secretly thought as he looked at Zhou Yuan.Under the Jade Spirit Waterfall, the now spirited A cla.s.s students continued their training once again. While the thundering waterfall washed over them, the figures standing within seemed to have become much more powerful.In the following period of time, Zhou Yuan maintained his 1 hour timing during each attempt, a fact that made everyone exclaim in admiration. No one could understand how he did it.Most importantly, Zhou Yuan was still rather lively even after enduring for an hour, and few bruises could be seen on his body. This appearance made it seem as if the waterfall was unable to damage him at all.Hence, the gazes which looked towards Zhou Yuan grew increasingly respectful.The 6 hour training session soon came to an end. Subsequently, the spirited A cla.s.s students walked past the B cla.s.s students under Zhou Yuan's lead.The B cla.s.s students were silent as they watched them leave.Liu Xi hatefully gnashed her teeth and said, \"Acting so pleased just because he was able to persist a short while longer! Does he really think that opening his third meridian channel will allow him to fly?\"\"Qi Yue, you cannot allow him to keep doing as he pleases!\"Qi Yue was expressionless as he coldly said, \"What's the rush.\"A cold l.u.s.ter pulsed in his eyes as he turned his head and looked towards the enormous Jade Spirit Waterfall. Moments later, he icily chuckled and said, \"Looks like this Jade Spirit Waterfall is rather useful to him\u2026\"A frosty glint flashed in his eyes as he looked towards Liu Xi. \"Don't you think that 6 hours is a little too much for the A cla.s.s?\"Liu Xi's eyes brightened upon hearing this. \"What do you mean?\"Qi Yue chuckled as the ominous look on his face faded. \"It just so happens that I previously heard cla.s.s master Xu mention how unfair the Jade Spirit Waterfall allocation was. The other cla.s.s masters also have some opinions with regards to this.\"\"No one would say anything if the A cla.s.s is able to tower above the other cla.s.ses like before, but does the current A cla.s.s have such qualifications?\"\"Do they still have the face to consider themselves the leader of the cla.s.ses after two consecutive years of being suppressed by our B cla.s.s?\"Qi Yue looked towards the direction Zhou Yuan and the rest had left in, the cold glint in his eyes growing even colder while the smile that hung from his lips overflowed with mockery.\"I feel\u2026 that it is indeed time to deal with this Jade Spirit Waterfall allocation problem.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32 Ice and Fire Genesis Gathering RunePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTime in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute flowed extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, half a month had pa.s.sed.Over this half a month, Zhou Yuan gradually grew accustomed to the training lifestyle in the A cla.s.s. However, it was a pity that the Jade Spirit Waterfall training was no longer as effective after unblocking his third meridian channel. Though this was the case, his fourth meridian channel was gradually being unblocked with the aid of the quartz energy\u2026Completely opening the channel was only a matter of time.On a certain day.Zhou Yuan had just left the inner palace after finis.h.i.+ng his breakfast when he caught sight of a certain pretty silhouette in the nearby flower park, causing his heart to tremble slightly.The Jade Spirit Waterfall in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute would be open again today. However, the effectiveness of the Jade Spirit Waterfall had already fallen somewhat for Zhou Yuan as his body had likely grown accustomed to the quartz energy.Hence, Zhou Yuan had to think of other ways to grow stronger.\"A Genesis Gathering Rune is drawn on my body every time I enter the Jade Spirit Waterfall. Big sis Yaoyao's attainments in the art of Genesis Runes is extremely high and far surpa.s.ses the Genesis Rune teachers of the inst.i.tute. I wonder if she knows of a more effective grade 1 Genesis Gathering Rune. If she does, my quartz energy absorption efficiency will rise to a higher level.\" When his thoughts reached this point, Zhou Yuan's eyes subconsciously brightened slightly, his pace growing quicker as he walked into the stone pavilion within the flower park.Yaoyao gracefully stood in the stone pavilion. The tip of the Genesis Rune Brush in her hand moved to and fro on the scroll that had been laid out on the tablet. Her gorgeous and fair face was currently fully concentrated. This earnestly working appearance of hers gave off a special sort of charm.Zhou Yuan quietly arrived at Yaoyao's side and looked towards the scroll, only to discover that it was a landscape painting. The mountain range within weaved about like a snaking dragon, while the meandering river gleamed like real water under the sunlight.Zhou Yuan's expression gradually became serious as he observed the majestic work of art. A trace of amazement rose in his eyes when he realised that there were Genesis Rune strokes hidden within the painting.The picture hid a very profound Genesis Rune!This was definitely no low grade Genesis Rune. An icy sensation soaked Zhou Yuan's entire body while he tried to feel the Genesis Rune as if he was facing some sort of terrible creature. Meanwhile, astonis.h.i.+ng undulations slowly pulsed from the painting.Zhou Yuan was overwhelmed with shock as he cried out in his heart, \"This Genesis Rune has likely reached grade 3!\"Grade 3 Genesis Rune. Even Heaven Gate stage experts did not dare to underestimate one.Moreover, the thing that shocked Zhou Yuan the most was that Yaoyao was able to blend the Genesis Rune in her landscape painting. From this, one could see just how deep her mastery of Genesis Runes went.While Zhou Yuan was immersed in the Genesis Rune landscape painting, a small fair hand blocked his line of sight, allowing him to come back to his senses.\"Your current mastery of Genesis Runes has yet to reach that level. Falling too deeply into it will hurt your Spirit.\" Yaoyao's flat voice was transmitted into his ear.Sure enough, Zhou Yuan felt a little dizzy after hearing this. He hastily turned away and sighed with admiration. \"Big sis Yaoyao's attainments in Genesis Runes are indeed amazing.\"He looked towards Yaoyao with eyes filled with curiosity. \"May I ask what is the highest grade Genesis Rune big sis Yaoayao can currently draw?\"Normally speaking, grade 3 Genesis Runes were comparable to a Heaven Gate pract.i.tioner. If it was grade 4, even Zhou Yuan's father, Zhou Qing, would have to be somewhat vigilant.Unfortunately, even in the entire Great Zhou, the most skilled person in Genesis Runes that Zhou Yuan knew of was unable to draw a grade 4 Genesis Rune.Yaoyao gently rolled up the painting in front of her as she offhandedly said, \"For the time being, I can only draw grade 3 Genesis Runes. But if I make ample preparations, it might be possible to try grade 4.\"Zhou Yuan could not help but grin.The power of grade 3 Genesis Runes was able to match a Heaven Gate stage pract.i.tioner. In other words, Yaoyao might seem weak because she was unable to use Genesis Qi, but in actual combat, armed with the power of Genesis Runes, even a Heaven Gate stage pract.i.tioner would be unable to stop her.\"Can't believe that master expects me to protect her. Just who exactly will be doing the protecting?\" Zhou Yuan could not help but laugh bitterly in his heart.As if she knew what Zhou Yuan was thinking about, Yaoyao glanced at him and said, \"Grandpa Hei is not counting on the you of now. The one he hopes to rely on is the future you.\"Zhou Yuan's heart shook slightly as he recalled the day Cang Yuan had sent Yaoyao and him away. Back then, Cang Yuan had clearly given off a feeling of urgency, as if an imminent danger was approaching that even he was not confident of dealing with.Zhou Yuan probed, \"Big sis Yaoyao, do you know of master's origins?\"Cang Yuan possessed unfathomable strength. An unknown danger that even he was not sure he could overcome would surely be an extreme terror. Thus, Zhou Yuan wanted to know more such that he could prepare himself.A vacant look emerge in Yaoyao's pretty eyes when she heard this and she retrieved an ancient jade pendant from her clothes. A life-like seven-color fire lotus had been carved onto the pendant.She stroked the pendant and gently shook her head as she replied in a tiny voice, \"Grandpa Hei never told me anything.\"Zhou Yuan let out a bitter laugh. Cang Yuan and Yaoyao were undoubtedly filled with mystery that he was unable to investigate.Seeing the somewhat depressed Yaoyao, Zhou Yuan did not dare to probe any further and hastily changed the topic. \"Big sis Yaoyao, do you know the Genesis Gathering Rune?\"Yaoyao replied in an absent-minded manner, \"The Genesis Gathering Rune is a very common grade 1 Genesis Rune. There is practically no need to ask.\"\"Then what is the most effective Genesis Gathering Rune that my body is able to support?\" Zhou Yuan's eyes seemed to burn as he stared at Yaoyao.Genesis Runes could not be carelessly inscribed. For example, if a grade 3 Genesis Rune was drawn on someone like Zhou Yuan, even if he was able to someone activate it, it would only harm to his body.Yaoyao pondered for a while before casually drawing a Genesis Qi in the air, \"Is this the Genesis Gathering Rune you used previously?\"Zhou Yuan nodded. The Genesis Rune Yaoyao had drawn was the most ordinary Genesis Gathering Rune. It was the same one that the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute instructors had inscribed on their bodies.Yaoyao held her green-jade-like Genesis Rune Brush, gently pressing its tip on her chin as she thought and said, \"There are many kinds of Genesis Gathering Runes and I naturally know of those that are more effective than this one.\"It was as if a surge of energy had suddenly flooded through Zhou Yuan as he anxiously looked at Yaoyao. \"Can you help me draw one?\"Upon seeing Zhou Yuan's gaze, Yaoyao's little hand folded into a fist as she lowered her head, revealing a thoughtful expression.Zhou Yuan tacitly retrieved a jade bottle from his sleeves. \"Hundred Flower Brew. I spent a great deal of effort in order to get this.\"Yaoyao received the jade bottle and took a light sniff. Only then did she smile in satisfaction. Her fair hand twirled the jade-green Genesis Rune Brush as she said, \"Take off your clothes.\"Zhou Yuan shed his clothes without any hesitation. Having trained for quite some time, his body now appeared much healthier and even had some muscle definition.\"This Genesis Rune of mine is called the Ice and Fire Genesis Gathering Rune and can be considered top tier amongst the grade 1 Genesis Runes. However, you will have to suffer a little.\"\"No problem. Bring it on.\" Zhou Yuan did not seem to mind.Yaoyao nodded. Without delay, the tip of the brush flickered with a faint l.u.s.ter as it landed on Zhou Yuan's back. As the brush tip flowed, Genesis strokes appeared one after another.As the Genesis strokes on his back continued to appear, Zhou Yuan gradually started to feel a strange sensation, as if fiery heat and icy coldness had appeared on his back. As fire and ice continuously interweaved, an intense stabbing pain could be felt.Hss!Zhou Yuan gasped in a mouthful of cool air. The sensation of ice and fire was clearly unpleasant.\"It's done.\"A short few minutes later, Yaoyao pulled back her hand, lifting the brush tip. One could see that the Genesis strokes had come together to form a complicated Genesis Rune on Zhou Yuan's back. Fire and ice seemed circulate on the Genesis Rune, a rather peculiar sight.As the Genesis Rune took shape, Zhou Yuan felt the surrounding Genesis Qi begin to converge towards him. This was far more effective than an ordinary Genesis Gathering Rune.\"It is indeed pretty awesome!\"An expression of surprise was revealed in Zhou Yuan's eyes. This Ice and Fire Genesis Gathering Rune was more than twice as effective as a normal Genesis Gathering Rune!\"With this Ice and Fire Genesis Gathering Rune, the amount of quartz energy I absorb during this trip to the Jade Spirit Waterfall will increase again!\" Excitement flooded Zhou Yuan's heart. After all, their A cla.s.s was only allocated 6 hours of the Jade Spirit Waterfall. Since there was nothing he could change with regards to the allocated time, the only thing left was to try and absorb more quartz energy during this period.Zhou Yuan regretfully said, \"Such a pity, 6 hours is still too short. If it was a little longer, the time taken to unblock my fourth meridian channel will be shorten.\"\"The effectiveness of this Ice and Fire Genesis Gathering Rune is pretty good. If Su Youwei has one too, she should be able to very quickly unblock her fifth meridian channel.\" As his thoughts reached this point, a certain idea hit him. Su Youwei's cultivation talent was extremely high and he naturally did not desire her progress to be delayed.\"Big sis Yaoyao\u2026\" Zhou Yuan shamelessly looked towards Yaoyao. \"Is it possible for you to help my friend draw one of these Ice and Fire Genesis Gathering Runes?\"Yaoyao's shapely eyebrows knitted together upon hearing this as she said without the slightest hesitation, \"Don't even think about it.\"She was obsessed with cleanliness and if it was not because she had been living with Zhou Yuan for so long, she would not have helped him draw a Genesis Rune.Zhou Yuan hurriedly said, \"She is a girl.\"Yaoyao's pretty face eased slightly when she heard it was a girl.\"It is boring for big sis Yaoyao to spend all day in the palace. It just so happens that you can follow me to the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute for a stroll to relieve your boredom.\" Zhou Yuan swiftly struck while the iron was hot.Yaoyao hesitated for a while. She had stayed in the palace for over a month and was indeed a little bored.\"Alright, I will go with you. However, I will only help one person.\" Yaoyao gave a light nod. However, she still took some precaution. If Zhou Yuan was to find ten or eight girls, she would really lose it.Zhou Yuan hurriedly nodded as he breathed a sigh of relief in his heart. One was obviously enough as he only wanted to help Su Youwei. As for the others, once he learnt this Ice and Fire Genesis Gathering Rune, he would consider helping those whom he had a good relations.h.i.+p with.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33 The Two Girls MeePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayGreat Zhou Inst.i.tute.When Zhou Yuan walked past with Yaoyao, he could clearly feel the surroundings grow silent as stunned gazes continuously turned towards them from all directions.Of course, these gazes were not directed at him but the leisurely strolling Yaoyao beside him.She was currently still in her simple green clothes. Her figure lovely and tall, her long legs thin and slender, and her supple little waist that was just too unreasonable. She carried a lazy Tuntun in her arms, who could occasionally turn and twist its body, squeezing deeper into the slightly developed curves of her chest. This caused countless people to secretly curse the little b.a.s.t.a.r.d, was.h.i.+ng they could replace it.Above that fair graceful neck was an gorgeous yet aloof face that seemed to have been carved from ice. A faint rune of light was faintly discernible on her forehead, giving her an air of mysteriousness, a mysteriousness that could be admired but not be touched.Based on face alone, Yaoyao and Su Youwei had their own individual charms, but Yaoyao possessed a mysterious and ungraspable-as-mist presence. A feeling that made one understand that they could never get to close to her yet could not help but want to chase her.Thus, when Yaoyao appeared in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute, the youths she pa.s.sed were all awed by her beauty and presence. Although amazement and wonder emerged in the eyes that closely followed her, no one dared to go up and talk to her.Zhou Yuan ignored these gazes as he led Yaoyao straight to the A cla.s.s.As the two left, the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute students exploded into whispers of curiosity.\"Such a pretty girl. Who is she? Is she also a student at our inst.i.tute?\"\"I've never heard of such a person in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute.\"\"With regards to prettiness, I'm afraid that only our Great Zhou Inst.i.tute's Su Youwei can compare.\"\"I feel that this girl is more stunning,\"\"Tch, I feel that Su Youwei is better. She's pretty and easy to approach. This one is too cold and it seems hard to get close to her.\"\".\u2026..\"From a certain spot in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute, Qi Yue and Liu Xi were watching Zhou Yuan's and Yaoyao's departing figures with different expressions.As Liu Xi gazed at the backs of the now distant figures, she could not help but grit her teeth and say, \"Humph. This fellow is not strong, but his b.u.t.terfly drawing ability is nothing to scoff at.\"Years ago, she had almost been betrothed to Zhou Yuan but ultimately managed to reject the marriage. Hence, she had never given a second glance to him. Who could have imagined that the girls that appeared at Zhou Yuan's side would become more and more remarkable. This naturally made her feel extremely uncomfortable.A look of amazement flitted across Qi Yue's eyes as he watched Yaoyao's lovely figure. Although Yaoyao's and and Su Youwei's faces had their own charms, someone of high status like himself had a preference for girls an aura similar to Yaoyao, mysterious and an aloofness that made her seem so high up that she was practically untouchable.Those that others could never obtain was what Qi Yue wanted.\"But I've never heard of this girl. Why does she have such a close relation to Zhou Yuan? Where did she come from?\"Qi Yue's eyes faintly narrowed. Soon after, he smiled and said, \"However, this prince of ours seems to be doing pretty well recently. He even has time to play with flowers.\"\"Is there any update with regards to the matter you spoke of before?\" Said Liu Xi through gritted teeth. She did not wish to see Zhou Yuan have such a free and easy time.The corners of Qi Yue's mouth lifted slightly. \"The preparations are almost done. The other three cla.s.ses also have some objections towards the A cla.s.s' 6 allocated hours. Today will be a good day to raise this problem.\"As he spoke, he looked in the direction Zhou Yuan had left in, the smile on his lips filled with playfulness.\"Strolling with a beauty is indeed a fine thing. However, you chose the wrong time to do so. Be careful of losing all your face.\"A cla.s.s courtyard.When Zhou Yuan brought Yaoyao in, every gaze immediately s.h.i.+fted over with a woosh, before becoming stunned when they saw the girl in green at Zhou Yuan's side.Su Youwei was talking to Song Qiushui and the rest when she caught sight of Zhou Yuan. Just as she was about to call out to him, her body froze momentarily as her pretty limpid eyes landed on Yaoyao.Su Youwei's heart shook faintly as her teeth bit into her red lips. It was obvious that she did not know what the relations.h.i.+p between Zhou Yuan and this girl in green was.\"It seems that this prince of ours really likes to womanize.\" Song Qiushui felt injustice for Su Youwei. Over this period of time, Su Youwei had already become the most welcomed person in the A cla.s.s. After all, she was pretty, had amazing talent and there was not a single trace of the usual arrogance of a genius.\"Elder sister Qiushui, please do not speak such nonsense.\" Su Youwei hastily pulled at Song Qiushui's sleeve.\"You!\" Song Qiushui helplessly glanced at Su Youwei and said in a low voice, \"You're hopeless. You are definitely going to be thoroughly used for your entire life.\"\"We are only friends.\" Su Youwei explained with a blush.\"Tch.\" Song Qiushui curled her lips.\"What are you guys talking about?\" Zhou Yuan smiled as he walked over.\"Your highness.\" Su Youwei smiled at Zhou Yuan before seemingly looking towards Yaoyao by accident as she softly asked, \"This person is?\"Zhou Yuan pondered for a while before he smiled and said, \"This is my little senior sister disciple.\"Yaoyao glanced at him but did not refute. Zhou Yuan was Cang Yuan's disciple, hence calling her little senior sister disciple was considered appropriate.Su Youwei was somewhat astonished. She had never heard of Zhou Yuan having a little senior sister disciple. However, since Zhou Yuan had said so, she naturally chose to believe him.\"Come, follow me.\" Zhou Yuan ignored everyone else's gazes and beckoned towards Su Youwei as he led Yaoyao to an empty room by the side.Su Youwei's pretty eyes were filled with doubt, but she still followed.The three entered the room and Zhou Yuan closed the door before starting to remove his clothes.\"Your highness, what are you doing?!\" Su Youwei's face immediately turned beet-red when she saw this. She stamped her foot in nervousness as her eyes drifted away, not knowing where she should look.Zhou Yuan awkwardly scratched his head and turned around, revealing the Ice and Fire Genesis Gathering Rune on his back. \"I want you to look at this.\"Only then did Su Youwei s.h.i.+ft her gaze over, however, her face was still red as she stared at the rune on Zhou Yuan's back. Moments later, she gasped in surprise, \"This is a Genesis Gathering Rune?\"Zhou Yuan put his clothes back on and nodded. \"This is the Ice and Fire Genesis Gathering Rune inscribed by my little senior sister disciple. It is even more effective than an ordinary Genesis Gathering Rune, which is why I invited her over to help you draw one too. It will increase the effectiveness of your training in the Jade Spirit Waterfall.\"Su Youwei was taken aback. She gazed at the quietly standing Yaoyao carrying Tuntun in a somewhat amazed manner. It was obvious that the former never imagined that the latter would have such high attainments in Genesis Runes.One must know that the Genesis Rune teachers of the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute were unable to inscribe such a unique Genesis Gathering Rune.However, while she was amazed, a warm feeling flowed in her heart due to Zhou Yuan's actions.Zhou Yuan smiled at Yaoyao and Su Youwei as he said, \"There is a inner room here, you two go in. I will stand guard outside.\"Yaoyao nodded and walked into the inner room. Su Youwei glanced at Zhou Yuan before quickly following.Inside the inner room, Yaoyao sized-up Su Youwei without batting an eyelid, but secretly praise in her heart. The girl before her looked intelligent and enchanting. The spirited feeling given off by Su Youwei's eyes was akin to a beautiful embryo.\"You are called Su Youwei, right?\" Yaoyao's voice was a little gentler than usual. After all, anyone would feel better in front of such a pretty and intelligent girl.Su Youwei nodded. She looked at Yaoyao and hesitated for a moment before asking, \"What about you big sis?\"\"I am Yaoyao.\"\"Then may I call you big sis Yaoyao?\"Yaoyao gave a light nod. \"Take off your clothes.\"Su Youwei's face turned red again when she heard this. Although they were both girls, it was still embarra.s.sing for her to undress in front of others.However, she was ultimately not a procrastinator. With a clench of her jaw, she removed her clothes.The moment her clothes fell, the entire inner room seemed to become somewhat brighter as a snow-white body blessed with enticing curves appeared. Su Youwei's face was dyed red as she turned around, revealing a flawlessly bright and fair back. Her arms hugged her chest, faintly emphasizing a rather full set of curves.Any male would have a nosebleed at such an exhilarating sight.\"What a lovely girl.\"Yaoyao inwardly exclaimed in admiration before retrieving her green jade brush and cautioning, \"It might be a little painful.\"Su Youwei shyly nodded.The jade brush descended, flickering with specks of light as it landed on Su Youwei's back. The brush tip swirled about, drawing stroke after stroke, each one pulsing with Spirit energy.The scorching and freezing sensation from Su Youwei's back made her grit her teeth, but she did not release even the slightest sound of pain.Yaoyao nodded upon seeing this.The inner room was silent for a long time before Yaoyao withdrew her brush. One would see a rune akin to swirling ice and fire slowly emerge on Su Youwei's back. It emitted a peculiar undulation and absorbed the surrounding Genesis Qi.\"Eh?\"However, the moment the Ice and Fire Genesis Rune was formed, Yaoyao suddenly let out a cry of surprise. Her pretty eyes stared at the Ice and Fire Genesis Gathering Rune, because in that brief moment earlier, she had faintly sensed the effectiveness of this rune seem to grow substantially.\"Don't move.\" Yaoyao suddenly said before she reached out a fair hand and gently pressed it on Su Youwei's back. After sensing for a moment, a thoughtful look was revealed on her pretty face.\"There seems to be a feeling of Yin and Yang in the depths of her body and it appears to be a little similar to the legendary Yin Yang Genesis root. But why is it so weak? It is because it has yet to fully mature?\" Yaoyao mumbled to herself in her heart.This Yin Yang Genesis root was an extremely unique root. It was similar to the sacred dragon root Zhou Yuan once possessed, giving one abilities that far surpa.s.sed the ordinary man.However, Su Youwei's Yin Yang Genesis root was very weak and may have yet to fully mature. Hence, Yaoyao could not be certain for the moment.\"Big sis Yaoyao, what is it?\" Su Youwei hurriedly asked as she looked at the pondering Yaoyao.Yaoyao thought for some time before shaking her head. After all, there was no need to speak of it since she was not sure. She only said, \"The effect of this Ice and Fire Genesis Gathering Rune is even better on you than Zhou Yuan.\"Su Youwei was somewhat shocked when she heard this. However, she did not overthink things. After all, the effectiveness of Genesis Runes would indeed vary depending on the person and a difference could be considered normal.After inscribing the Genesis Gathering Rune, the two girls walked out. Outside, the waiting Zhou Yuan smiled when he saw them. \"Finished?\"Yaoyao and SuYouwei nodded.\"That's good.\" Zhou Yuan breathed a sigh of relief before pus.h.i.+ng open the room doors.Once they left, Zhou Yuan immediately felt searing gazes shoot over. The many boys of the A cla.s.s were grinding their teeth. It was all because Zhou Yuan's actions had drawn too much hate. To think that he actually pulled two great beauties into a small room!In response to their gazes, Zhou Yuan merely rolled his eyes.It was at this moment that a figure hurriedly ran over from outside. It was profusely sweating Yang Zai. Upon seeing everyone, he hastily shouted, \"Headmaster Chu wants us to hurry over to the Jade Spirit Waterfall. Something has happened!\"Zhou Yuan was stunned by the situation and asked, \"What's going on?\"The other A cla.s.s members also cast puzzled gazes over.Yang Zai wiped his sweat as he spoke through gritted teeth, \"It's that d.a.m.ned Qi Yue. Their B cla.s.s has united with the other cla.s.ses and say that the cultivation allocation time for the Jade Spirit Waterfall is unfair. They want to cut our A cla.s.s' time!\"*Uproar*!The moment these words were said, an outburst instantly erupted as anger stirred in the crowd. Everyone's eyes seemed to be spitting fire. The Jade Spirit Waterfall was the cultivation treasure land of the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute and was extremely important to them. If their allocated time was cut, it would definitely cause everyone's channel opening speed to slow.Qi Yue's actions was practically cutting off the path of their A cla.s.s!Zhou Yuan's eyes faintly narrowed upon hearing this as a cold glint surfaced within them. This tactic of Qi Yue's was truly vicious...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34 Jade Spirit Waterfall ConspiracyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBy the time Zhou Yuan, Yaoyao, Su Youwei and the rest rushed to the Jade Spirit Waterfall, it was already flooded with people. All the students from the five cla.s.ses of the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute had gathered here. For a time, it was a boiling cauldron of voices, bustling with noise and excitement.Zhou Yuan's group pa.s.sed through the crowd and arrived at the very centre. Their gazes swept about, only to find a steely-green-faced Chu Tianyang and Xu Hong standing in front of the former.Behind Xu Hong was Qi Yue and Liu Xi.When Qi Yue saw Zhou Yuan rush over, he could not help but reveal a slight smile towards the latter. However, his smile was filled with a toying sensation.Chu Tianyang also caught sight of Zhou Yuan but did not say anything. He merely stared at Xu Hong with a steely-green face of anger, his fists clenching so hard that cracking noises could be heard as he said in an icy voice, \"Xu Hong, don't go overboard. The Jade Spirit Waterfall time allocation has been decided long ago. How can it possibly change at your whims?!\"\"Hehe, what is headmaster Chu saying. The Jade Spirit Waterfall is the most important cultivation treasure land of our Great Zhou Inst.i.tute and we naturally want to utilise it as efficiently as possible.\"Xu Hong looked at Chu Tianyang and slowly said, \"In the past, the A cla.s.s was the strongest cla.s.s of our Great Zhou Inst.i.tute and we naturally had nothing to say with regards to them using 6 hours of the Jade Spirit Waterfall.\"\"But what about now? The A cla.s.s has already been suppressed by our B cla.s.s for two consecutive years and is no longer the leader of the cla.s.ses. Since that is so, isn't 6 hours a little unjustifiable?\"Cold light flashed in Chu Tianyang's eyes as he retorted, \"The Jade Spirit Waterfall allocation was determined by his majesty back then. If you have any objections, go look for his majesty.\"Xu Hong did not seem to mind these words as he smiled and said, \"Ever since the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute was established, we have been free to decide the matters of the inst.i.tute and even his majesty will not interfere. Hence, there is no need for headmaster to use his majesty as a s.h.i.+eld.\"He had long cast his lot in with king Qi, something that naturally substantially diminished his respect for Zhou Qing.\"You!\"Chu Tianyang was furious. A ferocious look surged in his eyes as he suddenly took a step forward. His body immediately shook as a crimson red aura soared from his the top of his head.The crimson red aura was akin to a hundred foot long red cloud. Incomparably hot, it hovered in the sky above Chu Tianyang as a crimson red glow spread, causing the air in the area to turn blistering hot.A powerful pressure swept outwards at this moment, causing all of the students' expressions to change drastically as their legs began to tremble.\"So this is a Heaven Gate stage expert? It is indeed terrifying. Qi that breaks through the Heaven Gate is powerful enough to move mountains and split the land!\" Reverence emerged in the eyes of the many students. The Genesis Qi they were able to use at the Channel Opening stage was akin to a drop in the ocean when compared to a Heaven Gate stage pract.i.tioner like Chu Tianyang.Behind Chu Tianyang, Zhou Yuan's face was also filled with astonishment as he glanced at the overbearing crimson red Qi. His heart shuddered as he thought, \"Is this the Genesis Qi that Chu Tianyang has cultivated, the grade 3 Crimson Sun Qi?\"There were 9 grades of Genesis Qi. The better the Genesis Qi cultivation technique, the higher the grade of the cultivated Genesis Qi.Currently, the highest level Qi cultivation technique in their Great Zhou royal treasury could only cultivate grade 4 Genesis Qi.\"Humph, want to fight? Do you really think that I am afraid of you?!\" Xu Hong's eyes turned frostier when he saw Chu Tianyang's actions. The former also stepped forward as an equally powerful Genesis Qi burst out from the top his head like a shooting star.This Genesis QI was akin to a silver torrent and was filled with bone-piercing coldness. An aura of coldness unfurled, causing frost to grow on the surrounding ground.Grade 3 Genesis Qi, Silver Frost Qi!As the two Heaven Gate stage experts faced each other, a suffocating pressure spread, causing the numerous students present to feel a surge of fear, afraid that they would be caught in the aftershocks.After all, a battle between Heaven Gate pract.i.tioners was nothing like the childish fights of Channel Opening stage pract.i.tioners. It was a stage where even the slightest move would cause mountains to crumble and the earth to split.\"Headmaster Chu, cla.s.s master Xu, this is not the place to fight!\"However, while Chu Tianyang and Xu Hong clashed with their auras, someone finally shouted, breaking the confrontation between the two.The one who had shouted was a man in a black robe. It was the C cla.s.s master, Qin Xiao.The other two cla.s.s masters also hastily called out. After all, it would benefit neither party if they were to battle here,Following the interjection of the other cla.s.s masters, Chu Tianyang and Xu Hong knew that they could not really go at it. Both immediately let out a cold snort as the crimson red and silver-frost-like auras were withdrawn, burrowing back into the top of their respective heads.Chu Tianyang icily declared, \"Humph, I definitely will not agree to changing the Jade Spirit Waterfall allocation!\"Rage emerged in Xu Hong's eyes. Just as he was about to speak, Qi Yue suddenly smiled and said, \"Headmaster Chu, our proposal is not aimed against the A cla.s.s, but for all of the students of our Great Zhou Inst.i.tute.\"\"Headmaster should know how important the Jade Spirit Waterfall is to us students. In the past, the allocation was based on how the A cla.s.s stood above all the other cla.s.ses. Hence none of us had any dissent towards the A cla.s.s having 6 hours.\"\"But the current A cla.s.s in the decline. If it is still allowed to occupy so much time, won't it be a little too unfair to the other students? Thus, reallocating the cultivation time is what everyone wants.\"Qi Yue's voice sounded righteous and awe-inspiring, causing the numerous students around the Jade Spirit Waterfall to secretly nod in agreement. Everyone knew that the Jade Spirit Waterfall was extremely useful to those at the Channel Opening stage. If they were allocated a little more time, their channel opening rate would rise.With regards to obtaining benefits for oneself, everyone would always be a little selfish.Qi Yue laughed inside when he saw the acknowledgement from the crowd. He gazed at the increasingly ugly expression on Chu Tianyang's face as he continued, \"Headmaster Chu, although you are the cla.s.s master of the A cla.s.s, do not forget that you are also the headmaster of the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute. If you cannot be fair, I'm afraid that you will lose the will of the people.\"Chu Tianyang's expression changed completely, because these words of Qi Yue's were practically putting his head on the chopping block. If he dared to deny them, it would surely turn the other students against him.\"You!\" Chu Tianyang's cheeks faintly twitched.Behind Chu Tianyang, the numerous A cla.s.s students were likewise speechless while their faces had also turned rather ugly. After all, Qi Yue was doggedly grabbing onto the fact that the current results of their A cla.s.s was no good and did not have the qualifications to be the leader of the cla.s.ses. This was a point that they could not refute.\"According to the rules, if you want to take the A cla.s.s' place as the leader of the cla.s.ses, you will have to wait till the A cla.s.s loses first place in the cla.s.s ranking exam for three consecutive years. Since the year-end cla.s.s ranking exam has yet to arrive, isn't kicking the A cla.s.s down from their leader status being a little too impatient?\" While the many A cla.s.s students expressions were twisted, a calm voice suddenly rang out. Numerous gazes converged towards the origin of the voice, only to find that it was a thin, scholarly youth standing behind Chu Tianyang.It was Zhou Yuan.Qi Yue faintly smiled when he saw that Zhou Yuan had spoken. \"Since the current A cla.s.s has already lost first place in the cla.s.s ranking exam for two successive years, this year will naturally be no exception. Therefore, being the leader of cla.s.ses now only exists in name. There is no need for your highness to force this point.\"\"Rules are the rules. Moreover, I do not believe that our A cla.s.s will lose first place this year.\" Zhou Yuan also smiled. His voice was flat and did not waver.Qi Yue's eyes narrowed as disdain emerged from the corners of his mouth, matching t.i.t for tat as he replied, \"Your highness opinion seems to be rather naive. There are only a few months till the year-end cla.s.s ranking exam and the outcome is already more than obvious. Why should the A cla.s.s still occupy 6 hours of Jade Spirit Waterfall training and waste this cultivation resource?\"Zhou Yuan shook his head. \"I do not feel that our A cla.s.s Jade Spirit Waterfall training is a waste of cultivation resource.\"Qi Yue coldly chuckled. \"Since you insist on being stubborn with words, do you dare to prove your words with action?\"\"Oh?\" Zhou Yuan's eyebrows raised slightly.\"Relax, I do not plan on having a match with you guys. That will be a little too unfair.\" Qi Yue smiled superficially. His tone was filled with both contempt and disdain, causing the faces of the numerous A cla.s.s students to turn steely-green with rage.Qi Yue pointed at the flowing Jade Spirit Waterfall as a penetrating look surfaced in his eyes. \"If you are unconvinced, each of us will send one representative into the Jade Spirit Waterfall and see who lasts the longest. This will naturally show exactly who is wasting this cultivation resource!\"It was at this very moment that he finally revealed his plan.Chu Tianyang said in a low voice, \"You have long opened six meridian channels and the quality of your body is very high. Who can possibly endure as long as you in the Jade Spirit Waterfall?\"Although Zhou Yuan's performance in the Jade Spirit Waterfall was outstanding and the time he managed to persist was growing longer and longer, one must know that Qi Yue could do the same with just the high quality of his body.Qi Yue indifferently said, \"If headmaster Chu feels that this is not fair, you can only blame your A cla.s.s for having no one who is able to reach the six channels.\"Fury flooded Chu Tianyang's eyes. Just as he was about to speak, Zhou Yuan said, \"What are the stakes?\"Zhou Yuan could tell that Qi Yue had come prepared and would not let the matter drop so easily. Thus, it was likely that they would have to go through with it no matter what.\"The stakes huh\u2026 if our B cla.s.s wins, the A cla.s.s will have to cough up 3 hours of training time. 2 hours will end up with my B cla.s.s and the remaining hour will be split amongst the other three cla.s.ses. How does that sound?\" The corners of Qi Yue's lips raised as he stared at Zhou Yuan as if the latter was prey that was about to be caught.\"3 hours?!\" Rage immediately covered the other A cla.s.s students' faces when they heard this. Practically half of their A cla.s.s 6 hours would be taken away. This would be a substantial blow indeed.The students of the other cla.s.ses did not remark. It was clear from the current situation that the A cla.s.s and B cla.s.s were competing. However, they would be rather satisfied if they could ultimately get some additional Jade Spirit Waterfall training time.Hence, most of the students decided to wait and see from the sidelines with regards to Qi Yue's overbearingness.Zhou Yuan's eyes narrowed as he looked at the smiling Qi Yue. A brief moment later, the former slowly said, \"3 hours huh? Deal! However, if you lose, the B cla.s.s also needs to pay 3 hours of Jade Spirit Waterfall cultivation time!\"If they were to face each other head-on, Zhou Yuan, who had yet to open his fourth meridian channel, did not favor his chances against a six channel Qi Yue. But if they were to compete in Jade Spirit Waterfall training, Zhou Yuan was confident that he did not need to fear any of the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute students.He knew the Qi Yue was prepared, but he should not look down on Zhou Yuan.Moreover, similar to how Qi Yue was eyeing the 6 hours belonging to their A cla.s.s, Zhou Yuan likewise felt that these 6 hours were too short\u2026 He just never had any justification so far and was unable to change anything. Since Qi Yue suddenly decided to send a big present over, Zhou Yuan did not have any reason to reject.Qi Yue's expression turned a little rigid at this moment, evident unprepared for Zhou Yuan's straightforward agreement. However, he soon recalled his hidden trump and an eerily vicious look involuntarily flitted across his eyes.\"Alright! If we lose, our B cla.s.s will also lose 3 hours!\"As Qi Yue's words faded, a commotion exploded from the numerous surrounding students as they swiftly began to stir. From the looks of it, there was no need to wait till the year-end cla.s.s ranking exam. The clash between the A cla.s.s and the B cla.s.s would begin here\u2026However, it was obvious that they favored the B cla.s.s, because the B cla.s.s had Qi Yue. As the only six channel student in the current Great Zhou Inst.i.tute, he was an existence that towered over everyone else.On the other hand, Zhou Yuan had only opened three meridian channels. How could he possibly match Qi Yue?Why had the usually calm and level-headed prince Zhou Yuan lost his cool today?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35 Jade Spirit Waterfall BattlePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe atmosphere in front of the Jade Spirit Waterfall instantly fired up after Zhou Yuan and Qi Yue settled on the bet. More and more Great Zhou Inst.i.tute students came over after hearing the news, stuffing the area until not even a drop of water could seep through.After all, the stakes were far too great.3 hours of Jade Spirit Waterfall training time. One must know that with the exception of the A cla.s.s and the B cla.s.s, the other cla.s.ses only had an hour.\"The fish has taken the bait.\" The corners of Liu Xi's mouth lifted to form a delighted smile the moment she saw this, as if she was already able to see Zhou Yuan's miserable appearance after he was defeated.By the side, a dark and cold look flitted across Xu Hong's eyes. Did Zhou Yuan really believe that he had the ability to challenge Qi Yue just because his performance in the Jade Spirit Waterfall was rather decent? Truly naive.Although the numerous surrounding B cla.s.s students were a little alarmed by Qi Yue's acceptance of the bet, these feelings were swiftly replaced by excitement. They knew how strong Qi Yue was and even if the compet.i.tion this time was not a clash of fists, it would not be too difficult for Qi Yue to achieve victory.Hence, they felt as if the A cla.s.s' 3 hours were practically already in the bag.In contrast to the feeling of certain victory that shrouded the B cla.s.s students, the atmosphere of the A cla.s.s was rather heavy, and the expressions of many students were gloomy. After all, Qi Yue's reputation was just a little too overwhelming.\"Zhou Yuan, do you believe in your chances?\" Asked Chu Tianyang in a low voice, worry in his eyes.\"I'll try my best.\" Zhou Yuan smiled in response.Chu Tianyang eased up somewhat when he saw Zhou Yuan's relaxed smile. The other party was clearly prepared and would not let up until their aim was achieved. Thus, agreeing to the bet was the only thing they could do.\"You can do it!\" Su Youwei waved her little fists with the intention of boosting Zhou Yuan's morale.\"Zhou Yuan, the future of our A cla.s.s rests on your shoulders!\" Song Qiushui could only anxiously look towards Zhou Yuan. Their A cla.s.s were already in a rather disadvantageous position in the struggle with the B cla.s.s. If they were to lose 3 hours of Jade Spirit Waterfall training time, it was likely that no one in their A cla.s.s would be able to reach six channels when the cla.s.s ranking exam arrived.Hence, it was not too much to say that the futures of all the A cla.s.s students hinged on this bet.Zhou Yuan nodded in response when he saw the worry and hope in the many A cla.s.s students eyes.Under the attention of numerous gazes, Zhou Yuan and Qi Yue advanced towards the Jade Spirit Waterfall.\"If your highness has started regret, you can admit defeat sooner so as to avoid suffering too much.\" Qi Yue's smile was as light as a breeze.\"I'll send those words back at you.\" Zhou Yuan did not even look at Qi Yue as he replied in an indifferent voice.\"Looks like it is as the saying goes, one does not cry till one sees the coffin. Since that is so, do not blame me later.\" A look of mockery surfaced from the corners of Qi Yue's mouth. Without further ado, the tip of his foot pushed off the ground and his body landed on the other side of the Jade Spirit Waterfall.Zhou Yuan and Qi Yue stood on opposite ends of the waterfall as their gazes met. Each could feel the coldness in the other's eyes.Huu!A split second later, the two took in a deep breath before stepping into the violent waters of the Jade Spirit Waterfall under the attention of countless watching eyes.A seemingly boundless torrent of water, along with an almighty force, viciously slammed into the two individual's bodies. However, their bodies were akin to boulders, their feet tightly gripping the ground, unmoving as they allowed the water to crash onto them.Zhou Yuan's were shut, the Spirit between his brows throbbing as strands of Spirit sense spread outwards, sucking over all of the nearby quartz energy within the flowing waters to ease the intense pain brought about by the water striking his body.Meanwhile, the Ice and Fire Genesis Gathering Rune on his body began to emit a faint glow. Cold and heat interweaved as the quartz energy was swiftly absorbed.The speed of absorption was far greater than an ordinary Genesis Gathering Rune.\"This Ice and Fire Genesis Gathering Rune is indeed effective!\" Zhou Yuan praised in his heart as he felt the difference.Boundless water continued to descend, making Zhou Yuan's and Qi Yue's figures barely visible. Outside the waterfall, everyone's gazes were unblinkingly fixed on the duo.\"Zhou Yuan's previous limit seems to be an hour while Qi Yue on the other hand can reach one hour fifty minutes.\" Liu Xi stared at the two silhouettes in the watercall as she coldly smiled, \"So the victor will be decided in an hour.\"It seems that Zhou Yuan's ego had swelled somewhat after having such an easy time in the newcomer exam. Did he truly believe that Qi Yue was in any way like the trash he had faced in the newcomer exam? In Qi Yue's eyes, there was probably no difference between Zhou Yuan and the trash he had defeated.Xu Hong nodded. He was very confident in Qi Yue. After all, the quality of a six channel body was enough to allow him to easily endure in the Jade Spirit Waterfall.The numerous students on the B cla.s.s side also wore smiles and appeared rather relaxed. After all, Qi Yue's reputation in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute was just too great. He and Zhou Yuan were on completely different levels.In contrast to them, every one of the A cla.s.s students wore looks of worry.Yaoyao glanced at the tightly clenched fists of Su Youwei and consoled in a flat voice, \"No need to worry. Zhou Yuan will not lose.\"Her Spirit was powerful and it was likely that no one here could even hold a candle to her. Therefore, she could naturally sense that Zhou Yuan was using the power of his Spirit to absorb large amounts of quartz energy. Moreover, with the aid of the Ice and Fire Genesis Gathering Rune, Zhou Yuan was practically able to endlessly endure in the Jade Spirit Waterfall without tiring.On the other hand, Qi Yue was relying on his strong body. But no matter how strong the body, the continuous damage from the Jade Spirit Waterfall would gradually erode at it until it reached its limit.This was why the victor was clear from the start.Although Su Youwei did not know why Yaoyao was so certain, the former felt a little more at ease. However, her pretty eyes still unblinkingly stared at the waterfall.Under everyone's attention, time swiftly pa.s.sed.Ten minutes\u2026 half an hour\u2026 fifty minutes\u2026An hour rapidly approached. However, what puzzled the crowd was that Zhou Yuan's figure remained unmoving and had not started shaking, as if he was having an easy time. There was no indicator that he had reached his limit at all.Xu Hong's brows faintly furrowed as he glanced at Liu Xi. She was biting down hard on her teeth as she said, \"It's merely stubbornness. Let's see how long he can continue acting!\"And so, another ten minutes pa.s.sed and an hour was reached.Low gasps could be heard from the bank of the lake. They had realised that Zhou Yuan still showed no signs of being washed away by the waterfall, remaining as steady as a rock.Doubt began to fluctuate indeterminately in Xu Hong's eyes, while Liu Xi felt her face burn. Her expression also flickered in uncertainty, no longer daring to make irresponsible remarks because she could already feel some of the B cla.s.s students cast odd looks at her.\"That kid is still able to endure?\"In the Jade Spirit Waterfall, Qi Yue frowned as he sensed the still persisting Zhou Yuan. By this time, intense pain had started to emerge in Qi Yue's body, but it was still within his tolerance threshold.\"I'll wait and see if he is acting tough.\"While Qi Yue waited, another half an hour pa.s.sed.However, there was still no signs of any movement from Zhou Yuan.Qi Yue's face was now rather ugly. He could feel that he was about to reach his limits.\"This brat. No wonder he agreed so easily. Turns out that he was holding back before.\" Qi Yue's eyes darkened, a cold glint surfacing in his eyes as he glanced at Zhou Yuan.\"However, do you think that I did not make any preparations for this bet?\"Qi Yue's eyes slowly shut as he waited for time to pa.s.s. Another twenty minutes pa.s.sed in this manner and the total time had now reached one hour and fifty minutes, which was also Qi Yue's limit.Qi Yue opened his eyes as a sinisterly cold light emerged within them.\"Zhou Yuan. Since you cannot appreciate my kindness, don't blame me for what happens next.\"The moment this thought was finish, he flipped his tongue and a dark red pill appeared in his mouth before being swallowed in a single gulp.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36 Underhanded TacticPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs the dark red pill was swallowed into Qi Yue's stomach, he immediately felt an icy sensation appear in his body that headed straight towards his forehead.This pill was known as the Spirit Strengthening Pill and could temporarily strengthen one's Spirit. However, there were repercussions. After usage, the Spirit would be depleted for a period of time.It was obvious that Qi Yue no longer cared about such things at this point in time.As his Spirit swelled, a faint ray of light emerged from the spot between Qi Yue's brows and seemed to transform into an illusory figure. It was his Spirit. Evidently, Qi Yue's Spirit had stepped into the Illusory stage with the aid of the Spirit Strengthening Pill.With his Spirit now at the Illusory stage, Qi Yue immediately discovered what he had previously been unaware of. He could sense strands of quartz energy in the Jade Spirit Waterfall continuously flowing towards Zhou Yuan.\"So that's what's going on! To think that your ability to last so long in the Jade Spirit Waterfall is because of your Spirit!\" Qi Yue's pupils shrank. He had finally discovered the secret to why Zhou Yuan was able to endure even longer than himself.\"Humph. It is fortunate that I made preparations for this day. Else it would really be akin to capsizing on a calm lake!\"Qi Yue's expression darkened. Soon after, a Genesis Rune gradually appeared between his brows. This rune was known as the 'Spirit Needle Rune', a grade 1 rune which he had specifically found someone to help him inscribe. Its function was to condense the Spirit into the shape of a needle that could attack the enemy.Normally speaking, one needed to at least be at the advance Illusory stage to use Spirit based attacks. Qi Yue was barely able to reach the initial Illusory stage with the help of the Spirit Strengthening Pill and thus needed to rely on an external power in order to utilise Spirit attacks.Qi Yue could not attack directly in the waterfall. Hence, he could only choose a concealable method like Spirit attacks.Swis.h.!.+Following the activation of the 'Spirit Needle Rune', the spot between Qi Yue's brows flashed as a long needle made from a strand of Spirit shot out. The long Spirit needle pierced through the water and headed straight for Zhou Yuan.Zhou Yuan immediately sensed the Spirit needle the moment it shot towards him and the expression in his eyes instantly sunk. \"A Spirit attack? How can Qi Yue's Spirit be so strong?!\"Even the current Zhou Yuan could not perform Spirit attacks.Though he was bewildered, Zhou Yuan did not dare to tarry. Although the Spirit attack might not seem imposing and was unable to do any damage to the body, its destructive power to the Spirit was extremely great.Once one's Spirit was hurt, it would be even more difficult to recover than a physical wound.Thus, Zhou Yuan immediately stopped absorbing quartz energy. His Spirit withdrew and entrenched itself between his brows, creating multiple layers of defence.Ch!A faint sound was heard as a strand of Spirit power was directed to Zhou Yuan's eye. Zhou Yuan could now see a long Spirit needle drill its way out of the flowing water and shoot straight towards his head.Ch ch!Stabbing pain could be felt from between his brows as his expression grew increasingly grave. The Spirit needle was sharp and had managed to penetrate the layers of his Spirit defence he had set-up.\"Since you wish to seek death, I will have to oblige!\" Zhou Yuan's gaze flickered as the corners of his lips lifted to form an icy smile. The current him might not be a match for Qi Yue in a battle of fists, but if it was Spirit, Qi Yue was practically courting death!Zhou Yuan used his Spirit to continuously grind away at the sharpness of the Spirit needle. A short while later, he suddenly dispersed his defences with a thought.\"Success!\"An evil grin appeared on Qi Yue's face when he sensed this.Boom!However, the moment this sinister smile emerged on his face, a loud sound was transmitted into his ear. Subsequently, the scenery before his eyes rapidly changed as he found himself in an endless starry sky.Rumble!This sudden turn of events caused Qi Yue's expression to change drastically as a rumbling sound thundered. He raised his head and was swiftly overwhelmed by inconsolable terror when he saw an infinitely stretching giant grindstone slowly appear. A shadow that could cover the heavens descended as the behemoth hurled towards him.Endless dread surged in Qi Yue's heart.The t.i.tanic grindstone crushed downwards and there was nothing he could do to resist as he felt his Spirit being smashed to pieces.Crack!A faint cracking sound emerged from between Zhou Yuan's brows, marking the shattering of Qi Yue's Spirit needle as an icy chuckle to left the former's mouth. Between Zhou Yuan's brows was the Primal Chaos Divine Grindstone brand left by Cang Yuan. Hence, Zhou Yuan was not afraid of Spirit attacks. Any Spirit attack that entered would naturally be crushed by the Primal Chaos Divine Grindstone.AAH!When Zhou Yuan shattered the Spirit needle, a miserable shriek suddenly rang out nearby.The shriek immediately draw the attention of everyone outside the waterfall. Subsequently, they were appalled to see Qi Yue's figure start to shake before ultimately being washed away by the boundless flow of water, falling into the cold waters of the lake below.\"How is this possible?\" Xu Hong's expression abruptly changed. He face was steely-green as he stared at the trembling Qi Yue that had fallen into the lake.By the side, Liu Xi's small mouth was wide open while disbelief filled her attractive face.The other B cla.s.s students were silently trembling, their faces white as sheet.Of course, it was not just them. Even Chu Tianyang, Su Youwei and the other A cla.s.s students had faces overflowing with shock. It was obvious that this outcome had surpa.s.sed everyone's expectations.The surroundings of the Jade Spirit Waterfall was complete silence, as if everyone had just seen a ghost.While a blanket of silence covered the crowd, a figure flew out from the Jade Spirit Waterfall, his foot pus.h.i.+ng off the surface of the water before confidently landing by the lake side. Tall and straight, who else could it be but Zhou Yuan.He looked at the ugly to the max expressions on Xu Hong, Liu Xi and the rest as he said in a flat voice, \"The victor is already clear. What else do you have to say?\"Some students fished out Qi Yue from the lake, only to find that his face was deathly pale while his eyes were full of fear. His s.h.i.+vering appearance was extremely miserable.This baffled everyone. They were clearly unable to understand how he became like this.\"This is\u2026 Spirit injury?\" Xu Hong's expression immediately changed when he saw Qi Yue's appearance.When Liu Xi heard this, she immediately pointed at Zhou Yuan and shrieked, \"Despicable! You cheated!\"The many students also looked towards Zhou Yuan in doubt.\"Cheated?\" Zhou Yuan sneered and pointed towards Qi Yue's head where the remains of a rune was gradually fading, \"If I am not wrong, that is the grade 1 Genesis Rune, Spirit Needle Rune, right?\"\"If he did not attack me with a Spirit needle earlier, he would not have fallen into such a state.\"The moment these words were said, an uproar exploded from the crowd as their gazes turned towards Qi Yue's forehead. Sure enough, they found the fading remains of a rune and those proficient in Genesis Runes immediately identified it.\"Qi Yue is clearly stronger than prince Zhou Yuan. To think that he still made use of such despicable tactics!\" Numerous students muttered while the gazes that looked at Qi Yue now had an additional trace of despise.Liu Xi's face turned steely-green when she sensed these gazes, while fire practically spit from her eyes. However, she could not say even a single word in reb.u.t.tal because the truth was already more than clear. If Qi Yue had not done anything fishy, what was this Spirit Needle Rune for?If she tried to explain, it was likely that even she would be drowned in the crowd's spittle.As they heard the voices from the crowd, the many B cla.s.s students looked to each other with ugly expressions. The respect from before was no longer present in their gazes when they looked towards Qi Yue, instead, there was now blame.After all, Qi Yue had lost the bet, causing their B cla.s.s to lose 3 hours of Jade Spirit Waterfall training time. In other words, all they had left was a single hour\u2026This was a tremendous blow to their B cla.s.s.Someone could not help but mutter, \"Challenging others without absolute confidence. Great job, there's now practically nothing left to lose.\"Liu Xi immediately swept her furious gaze over, but was unable to find who had spoken and could only grind her teeth in anger.\"Hehe, cla.s.s master Xu, our A cla.s.s kindly accepts your B cla.s.s' 3 hours of Jade Spirit Waterfall training time.\" Chu Tianyang heartily laughed at this moment. It felt really awesome to look at Xu Hong's steely-green face.Never in his wildest dreams would Xu Hong have ever expected that causing trouble for the A cla.s.s would instead result in such a huge loss for the B cla.s.s.Rage churned in Xu Hong's stomach, but he not act out on his anger. He could only show a forced smile as he looked at Chu Tianyang and Zhou Yuan and said, \"Don't celebrate too early. The cla.s.s ranking exam is fast approaching and as long as our B cla.s.s takes first place again, whatever you've taken away now will have to be spit out twice fold!\"After saying this, he flung his sleeves, turned around and left.Liu Xi and the other B cla.s.s students could only weakly follow. Their figures were an extremely sorry sight.As the left, thunderous cheers exploded from the A cla.s.s as they surged forward, wis.h.i.+ng they could throw Zhou Yuan up into the air.Zhou Yuan hurriedly put a stop to their crazed happiness and smiled towards the surrounding students from the other cla.s.ses as he said, \"Of the 3 hours our A cla.s.s has won, 1 hour will be split amongst the other three cla.s.ses. Take it as thanks for cheering us on today.\"The moment these words were said, the students of the other three cla.s.ses were taken aback. Soon after, ashamed looks were revealed on their faces. The truth was that their three cla.s.ses had been a little akin to those who threw stones at someone who was already down. Who could have expected that not only would Zhou Yuan not bear a grudge, he would even give them an hour of his winnings. This act of requiting goodness for evil made them feel both shame and admiration.\"Then we'll have to thank your highness!\" Numerous students cupped their fists towards Zhou Yuan with grat.i.tude on their faces.Praise involuntarily flitted across Chu Tianyang's eyes when he saw this. This move of Zhou Yuan's was just too beautiful and had practically bought over the will of the students. From this day onwards, Zhou Yuan's popularity would likely surpa.s.s Qi Yue's.Moreover, after receiving such benefits from Zhou Yuan, no one would agree to whatever trickery the B cla.s.s tried in future.The expressions of Qin Xiao and the other two cla.s.s masters were complicated. Their hearts s.h.i.+vered as they glanced at Zhou Yuan. It was at this very moment that they finally realised that this prince of theirs was not simple at all. Looks like they definitely could not offend him in future...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37 Double BreakthroughPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySmas.h.!.+In a certain room, Qi Yue's eyes were entirely red as he smashed everything he could get his hands on. It was a long time later before he finally stopped, panting for breath with a twisted face that was menacing to the extreme.Qi Yue violently punched a hole in the table as he snarled through gnashed teeth, \"Zhou Yuan!\"By the side, Liu Xi waited till he finished venting before approaching as she consoled, \"Qi Yue, there's no need to be angry. Zhou Yuan was just lucky this time. If it was a real fight, he would be no match for you. He merely relied on his meagre attainments in the Spirit.\"Qi Yue's jaw was clenched. Of course he knew that Zhou Yuan would not be nothing in a real fight, but he did after all lose the bet. Moreover, he had lost in a such an unsightly manner in front of all of the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute students.It was easy to imagine how his popularity and fame in the inst.i.tute would be destroyed after this affair.Especially when he had lost 3 of the 4 hours of Jade Spirit Waterfall training the B cla.s.s had. One could easily imagine how the B cla.s.s students might not dare to openly say anything, but would surely blame him in their hearts.When he recalled those gazes, the proud Qi Yue felt so sullen that he almost vomited a mouthful of blood.Liu Xi said, \"The cla.s.s ranking exam is fast approaching. During the cla.s.s ranking exam, you will openly defeat him and let him know exactly how great the gap between the both of you is. When that happens, you will take everything back.\"Qi Yue took in a deep breath, suppressing the fury in his heart as he slowly nodded and said, \"Don't worry. I will make sure that he returns everything to me in the cla.s.s ranking exam!\"\"However, there's something very odd about that brat so I can't afford to relax. I need to redouble my training and make sure that he will not even have the slightest chance to make a come back.\"Liu Xi nodded, gratified by Qi Yue's words. In the end, he had not allowed his anger to overwhelm his rationality and instead began to view Zhou Yuan as a rival. She believed that with Qi Yue's talent, as long as he no longer looked down on Zhou Yuan like before, it would be impossible for the latter to vie with Qi Yue.The most dazzling person in the year-end cla.s.s ranking exam would be Qi Yue!Additionally, she was not wrong to have called Zhou Yuan a toad back then!Qi Yue's fists gradually loosened as he eyes narrowed slightly, flickering maliciously.\"Zhou Yuan, you'd better remember this!\"\u2026The following ten days were exceptionally good for the A cla.s.s members. The time they had to train in the Jade Spirit Waterfall had grown from 6 to 8 hours, allowing the channel opening rate of many students to rise and several were even attempting to unblock their next channel.The formerly high and mighty students of the B cla.s.s quickly made themselves scarce whenever they saw an A cla.s.s student and no longer mocked the latter. This made the A cla.s.s members feel rather carefree. As for the students from the other cla.s.ses, they were extremely friendly to the A cla.s.s students due to Zhou Yuan's actions. For a time, the morale of the A cla.s.s members soared and they sincerely admired Zhou Yuan in their hearts a little more than before.Rumble!In the Jade Spirit Waterfall, Zhou Yuan's eyes were shut as he allowed the boundless water to wash over him. Meanwhile, strands of quartz energy were continuously absorbed by his body.While Zhou Yuan was quietly training, he suddenly heard cheers from the lakeside.\"Wow! Youwei, you are really too awesome! You've unblocked your fifth meridian channel so quickly!\"Zhou Yuan was somewhat startled when he heard this. He opened his eyes and looked through the curtain of water and was barely able to make out Su Youwei's figure surrounded by numerous A cla.s.s students at the lake bank.\"Oh? Su Youwei has unblocked her fifth meridian channel? That's really fast!\" Zhou Yuan could not help but sigh in admiration. Su Youwei's talent was indeed superb. The fact that her achievements were so outstanding even without much cultivation resources was truly amazing.\"Good job Youwei. Very well done indeed!\" At the lake side, Chu Tianyang was all smiles as he looked at Su Youwei with a joyful expression. With this, their A cla.s.s now had three five channel students.Su Youwei smiled faintly. Her pretty eyes looked towards the Jade Spirit Waterfall and saw a familiar silhouette give her a thumbs-up.The smile on her lips grew wider, making her even more attractive and enchanting.\"Youwei has even opened her fifth channel, I cannot fall too far behind. Fortunately, I'm almost there!\"Zhou Yuan very quickly calmed his heart as his senses peered into his body. The fourth meridian channel had been growing increasingly loose over the past few days of training and he was extremely close to being completely unblocked.Zhou Yuan's eyes slowly closed once again as he began to increase the rate of quartz energy absorption.This lasted for two whole hours.The sun gradually set, casting rays of light on the Jade Spirit Waterfall, making it turn a rather darkish red.Within the waterfall, Zhou Yuan's figure began to tremble at this moment while he tightly gritted his teeth as if bearing tremendous pain.Inside his body, waves of quartz energy were ruthlessly charging into the final sliver of blockage in his fourth meridian channel under Zhou Yuan's guidance.Pop!A tiny sound was heard. Almost immediately after, Zhou Yuan's eyes abruptly opened as the surrounding Genesis Qi surged over and poured into his body.Cackle crack!Genesis Qi rumbled and his flesh and blood seemed to boil while faint vibrations were emitted from his skeleton. Like a set of firecrackers, the quality of Zhou Yuan's body soared once again as waves of Genesis Qi washed over it.Surging heat flowed in his four limbs and skeleton.The fourth meridian channel had finally been unblocked!Strands of Genesis Qi light swirled on the surface of Zhou Yuan's body, stopping even the torrential waters from touching it. A carefree smile emerged from the corners of his lips as he felt the sharp rise of power in his body.After more than an entire month of tough training, his fourth meridian channel was now open!Zhou Yuan mumbled to himself, \"With my fourth meridian channel unblocked, I no longer have to fear a direct clash against Qi Yue. However, at the very minimum, Qi Yue will definitely reach the seventh channel by the year-end cla.s.s ranking exam. Thus, the fourth channel is still not enough to take first place.\"The current him had at last began to catch up to Qi Yue, but Zhou Yuan was still not absolutely sure of comfortably beating Qi Yue in the cla.s.s ranking exam. After all, Qi Yue was not staying stagnant while Zhou Yuan was growing stronger, and it was very possible that the former would soon unblock his seventh meridian channel.However, what made Zhou Yuan feel somewhat troubled was that as his fourth meridian channel was unblocked, the effectiveness of the Jade Spirit Waterfall was growing worse and worse. It should be because his body had absorbed too much quartz energy and had now become rather resistant to it.Hence, it was likely that he could not count on the Jade Spirit Waterfall to open his fifth meridian channel.Zhou Yuan was rather vexed as he ma.s.saged his head and mumbled to himself,\"Looks like I have to find other methods. Or else, I'm afraid that my fifth meridian channel will not be open when the cla.s.s ranking exam arrives\u2026\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38 Black Forest Mountain RangePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe sun rose into the sky as its rays enveloped the entire Great Zhou royal palace.\"Not bad. As expected of our Zhou clan's sacred dragon, you've opened your fourth meridian channel in such a short period of time.\" At the dining table, Zhou Qing watched Zhou Yuan drain a bowl of Nine Beast Soup with a face full of gratification.Zhou Yuan cleaned out the entire bowl with a single gulp and began to feel a rising heat within his body. He licked his lips as he picked up a bowl of Mysterious Crystal Rice and wolfed it down together with the meticulously prepared Genesis Beast meat dish on the table.As the quality of his body increased, more and more nutritious Genesis Beast meat was added to his diet to make up for the energy used during his daily training.Only after finis.h.i.+ng his food did Zhou Yuan finally smile at Zhou Qing. A short while later, the former regretfully shook his head and remarked, \"However, the effectiveness of the Jade Spirit Waterfall is growing worse and worse. I need to think of other methods to quickly unblock my fifth meridian channel.\"The difficulty of opening his channels was far higher than an ordinary person and normal methods would be far too time consuming, something that he obviously could not afford.A thoughtful look appeared on Zhou Qing's face when he heard this. By this point in time, he already knew that it was way harder for Zhou Yuan because it was the second time he was opening his channels.From the side, the quietly eating Yaoyao suddenly said, \"I have an idea to more quickly open your channels.\"\"Eh?\" Zhou Yuan and Zhou Qing looked towards her in shock.In response to their gazes, Yaoyao's face remained expressionless as she elaborated, \"I know of a Genesis Rune called the Thirty Six Beasts Channel Opening Rune. Using the blood of thirty six kinds of grade 1 Genesis Beasts as an anchor, it can be inscribed on a person's body, allowing the person to borrow the savage energy within the Genesis Beasts' blood to unblock his channels.\"\"However, this method is somewhat dangerous. If one's will is not strong, the savage energy contained within the blood of the Genesis Beasts will sunder one's mind.\"In simple terms, one would become nothing more than a simple fool.The moment these words were said, Zhou Qing's and Qin Yu's expressions changed slightly.In contrast, joy flitted across Zhou Yuan's eyes. He was extremely confident in his willpower. After all, he had survived even the torture of the Dragon's Resentment Poison and there was thus no reason to be afraid of the savagery of a few grade 1 Genesis Beasts.Zhou Yuan said without hesitation, \"Big sis Yaoyao, we'll use this Thirty Six Beast Channel Opening Rune!\"Qin Yu wanted to say something but Zhou Yuan smiled at her. \"Don't worry mother, I will be fine.\"There was nothing else Qin Yu could say upon hearing this and she could only slowly nod her head.Zhou Qing also nodded as he slowly said, \"I will not stop you since you are so determined. I will get someone to gather the fresh blood of thirty six grade 1 Genesis Beasts.\"He was very happy with the determination that Zhou Yuan had shown.After all, the road of cultivation was a hard one. If one did not have great courage and drive, it would be difficult to travel very far on this road.Yaoyao shook her head as she softly said, \"It will be better to let him gather the blood himself. He currently lacks actual combat experience and his battle awareness is not strong. If he continues to train in this manner, he will become a barbarian that relies solely on brute force.\"Zhou Yuan was stunned, but soon after, a look consideration surfaced in his eyes. Yaoyao was right, he had far too little combat experience and his battle awareness was weak. This was the reason why he had failed to make much progress with regards to the Dragon Tablet Hand for some time and was ultimately still unable to master the second level of the technique.If this situation persisted, even if he managed to raise his strength, it was very probable that he would end up encountering an unexpected failure in a true life and death struggle.As his thoughts reached this point, Zhou Yuan looked towards Zhou Qing and said, \"Father, I will be spending some time in the Black Forest Mountain Range.\"The Black Forest Mountain Range was a grand mountain range in the vicinity of Great Zhou City. Countless Genesis Beasts lived within it and it was a rather dangerous zone. The ability to fight was essential to survive there.Zhou Qing fell silent for some time before he slowly nodded his head. \"It is good that you have such thoughts. One will ultimately appear rather immature without experiencing some life and death struggles.\"\"You may go, but I will get Lu Tieshan to follow you with some men. Don't worry though, they will not interfere and will be there purely for your safety.\"Lu Tieshan was a captain in the imperial guard, a Heavenly Gate stage expert and was deeply trusted by Zhou Qing.Zhou Yuan knew from Zhou Qing's expression that he would not give in, hence, the former could only nod his head.\u2026The next day.Early in the morning, when Zhou Yuan and Yaoyao arrived at the palace gates, a tanned and muscular metal-tower-like figure greeted them.\"Your highness!\"The welcomer's face was cold and impa.s.sive like a block of ice. Faint wisps of a metallic b.l.o.o.d.y aura rose around his body, evidence that he was a veteran of the battlefield. It was Lu Tieshan, a captain of the Great Zhou palace imperial guard.\"We'll be troubling captain Lu. Let's set off.\"There was no delay as Zhou Yuan faintly smiled and nodded at Lu Tieshan.Lu Tieshan nodded. With a wave of his hand, a dozen strong-looking figures rushed over and escorted Zhou Yuan and Yaoyao out the palace gates. The group merged into the flow of the crowd and swiftly disappeared.The Black Forest Mountain Range was half a dozen miles from the city. The mountains that sprawled across the land contained countless Genesis Beasts and various natural treasures. This was why the Black Forest Mountain Range was one of the popular locations in the vicinity of Great Zhou City.Numerous Genesis Masters gathered here from all over in hopes of chancing upon some luck in the perilous mountain range, trying to see if they could change their destiny and become one who stood above others.At the entrance to the mountains, many Genesis Masters were seeking companions or groups to join. However, Zhou Yuan's entourage did not stop and headed straight into the mountain range. After all, with a Heaven Gate stage expert like Lu Tieshan with them, there would not be much problems unless they encountered grade 3 Genesis Beasts.Zhou Yuan and gang stopped after venturing about fifteen miles into the mountain range. This was the outer layer of the Black Forest Mountain range and majority of the Genesis Beasts here were grade 1.They set up two tents in a randomly chosen valley before Lu Tieshan withdrew with his men, leaving the place to Zhou Yuan and Yaoyao.As Lu Tieshan and the rest left, Zhou Yuan breathed out deeply as he gazed at the dark forest, smelling the faint scent of blood in the air while his hand slowly closed around the Heavenly Yuan Brush at his hip.He knew that he needed to train here in the following period of time and hoped that he would be able to unblock his fifth meridian channel here....Qi Manor.In a certain room, Qi Yue's gaze was chilly as he looked at the middle-aged man before him and slowly asked, \"Zhou Yuan has gone to the Black Forest Mountain Range?\"\"Yes. Lu Tieshan personally escorted him and it's likely that he plans to train there.\" The middle-aged man's eyes were deep set and his skin a rock-like faded yellow.This person was housekeeper of Qi Manor, Qi Ling.Qi Yue could not help but let out an icy chuckle when he heard this. Cold light flickered in his eyes as he mumbled to himself, \"I won't be able to do anything if you stayed in the city, but you've actually voluntarily went to the Black Forest Mountain Range. You are truly reckless.\"\"Does second young master intend to take action against him?\" Qi Ling frowned as he continued, \"If we are discovered, the royal clan will surely retaliate.\"Qi Yue faintly smiled, \"That's why I need a very meticulous plan. Moreover, I do not intend on killing him. Leaving him half dead to relieve some of this pent up anger is fine.\"He thought for a while before he said in an emotionless voice, \"Get two people to fake a robbery at Qi Manor. After which, you will lead some men and go after them, chasing them all the way to the area where Zhou Yuan is where you will find an opportunity to delay Lu Tieshan. As for the rest, leave it to our two 'robbers'.\"\"If anything happens, those two will take the blame and it will have nothing to do with us. After all, Qi Manor was the victim of robbery. Make sure to silence them as soon as possible so that no one will be able to say anything.\"Qi Ling was stunned. Soon after, he smiled and said, \"It's a pretty good plan.\"Qi Yue let out an icy laugh as he retrieved a jade scroll form his clothes. A faint radiance was emitted by the scroll as if ancient text had been carved onto it. \"But we must ensure that everything is done properly in order decrease suspicion. Hand this item to the two that will carry out this task.\"Qi Ling recieved the scroll and glanced at it, causing his expression to change drastically. \"The Auraflare technique? This is one of the most powerful Genesis techniques of Qi Manor and was obtained by master from the Wu Empire.\"\"I retrieved it from the treasury earlier. It is even more suitable because it is important. When the two have completed their mission, you will a.s.sist Lu Tieshan to kill them and retrieve it.\"\"This can be considered an explanation of sorts. After all, I expect that the royal clan will have nothing to say since our Qi Manor narrowly lost such a treasure. As they saying goes, a mute that eats a bitter gourd will be unable to complain. The royal clan will have no choice but to suffer in silence.\"Qi Yue's voice was sinisterly cold. His vicious plan made even Qi Ling involuntarily nod in approval.\"Excellent. Second young master's plan is very thorough.\" Qi Ling grinned evilly. As a follower of king Qi, he no longer cared about the Great Zhou royal clan and showed no fear even when they were plotting against Zhou Yuan.Qi Yue laughed and raised his head. There was a venomous look in his eyes as he looked towards the direction of the Black Forest Mountain Range.\"Zhou Yuan. Since you made me lose face in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute, I will take half your life!\"\"Fight me? Humph, you are still too experienced!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Shadows flashed within the dense foliage. The place was br.i.m.m.i.n.g with danger.On a certain clearing in the forest, Zhou Yuan's crouched body was stretched taunt while his eyes were fixed straight ahead where a night-black Genesis Beast with a silver horn was staring back at him with cold animal eyes.It was a Silver Horn Beast, a grade 1 Genesis Beast.Growl!The Silver Horn Beast's body slowly lowered before suddenly shooting forward a split second later like a shadow. The pungent scent of blood was strong as it pounced at Zhou Yuan.\"Dragon Step!\"The Silver Horn Beast was swift and ferocious, hence Zhou Yuan did not dare to be negligent. His feet immediately inclined at an angle and moved as his body turned blurry.Sch!The Silver Horn Beast's sharp claws grazed past the skin of Zhou Yuan's face.Zhou Yuan's five fingers clenched into a fist, Genesis Qi light swirling around it as he viciously punched at the lower back of the Silver Horn Beast.Thud!The Silver Horn Beast let out a howl of grief as it slammed into the ground, creating a crater. However, when it hit the ground, its tail whipped out like a metal whip and smashed into Zhou Yuan's arm.Zhou Yuan's body was swept backwards, only managing to stabilize himself after a dozen steps.Ignoring the burning pain from his arm, Zhou Yuan ferociously pounced forward again, his hand sweeping out at a horizontal angle while all the Genesis Qi in his body surged through his meridian channels and poured into his palm.\"Dragon Tablet Hand, shatter the mountain!\"A low cry was followed by the sound of wind then A faint sonic boom.Bang!Without waiting for the Silver Horn Beast to crawl up to its feet, Zhou Yuan's hand powerfully swatted onto its head, immediately causing its hard skull to shatter as its body fell to the ground with a loud thud.Having killed the Silver Horn Beast with a palm strike, Zhou Yuan sighed in relief as his tense body began to relax.Ch!However, the instant he relaxed, a shadow suddenly shot out from the shade of the tree behind him. Sharp fangs flickered coldly as they viciously closed in on Zhou Yuan's throat.\"Martial form!\"A shout suddenly rang out.Light surged in Zhou Yuan's hand as a mottled black brush appeared. The snow-white hairs of the brush tip binded together tightly like a lotus flower shaped spear tip with unparallelled sharpness, while strands of Genesis Qi swirled around it. With a swish, it pierced through the air, penetrating the shadow through its b.l.o.o.d.y, wide-opened mouth and pinning it on the tree trunk.With his hands grasped around the end of the Heavenly Yuan Brush, Zhou Yuan lifted his head, only to find a thick black snake nailed to the trunk, fresh blood flowing from it.It was a Shadow Python, another a grade 1 Genesis Beast.\"Come at me again?\" Zhou Yuan grinned at the snake's corpse. He had suffered quite a bit at the very beginning. If his Spirit had not reached the Illusory stage, giving him keen senses, it was likely that he would have been swallowed as food when he first encountered this particular creature.Zhou Yuan retrieved the Heavenly Yuan Brush, transforming it back to its culture form and stuck it back into his waistband. Subsequently, he hoisted up both the python and Silver Horn Beast corpses before walking out of the forest.After exiting the forest, he came to a valley after approximately a dozen minutes of walking. Yaoyao was seated on a rock by the little stream, her bare feet dipping into the cool waters as she leisurely played in the water. Meanwhile, Tuntun was shuttling up and down in the stream, catching the fish swimming within.Upon hearing some noise, Yaoyao turned her head and glanced at Zhou Yuan. \"Not bad, at least you didn't get injured this time.\"Zhou Yuan threw the two Genesis Beast corpses onto the ground, feeling a little embarra.s.sed when he heard her words. It was already his fifth day in the Black Forest Mountain Range and he had just barely gotten accustomed to the fighting and killing of Genesis Beasts.However, on his first day here, he had been riddled all over with injuries. In particular, the claw wound on his chest had been so deep that bone could be seen. It was then that Zhou Yuan finally understood the difference between practice fights and true life and death battles.These Genesis Beasts had experienced numerous fights to survive, and every single one was both cunning and ruthless. If Zhou Yuan treated them as easily slaughtered reared cattle, it was likely that he would not be able to walk out of this mountain range.However, although the past few days of fighting and killing had been extremely dangerous, it had also brought about a significant change to Zhou Yuan. In the past, Zhou Yuan had a slight scholarly aura and looked like a weak scholar that would be blown away by a breeze.But now, he gave off a faint aura of danger when he entered battle mode.Yaoyao threw over two bottles and instructed, \"Collect the beasts' blood, remember to only take the blood of the heart where the savage energy is the strongest.\"Zhou Yuan caught the bottles and nodded. He used a small knife to cut open the skin of the two Genesis Beasts with ease before collecting the heart blood in the bottles.\"Up till now, you've already killed fifteen Genesis Beasts. You only have eleven more to go.\" Yaoyao rose, her bare feet stepping on the rock. The snow-white fairness made the surrounding light seem a little dimmer.Zhou Yuan nodded in acknowledgement. Thirty six different kinds of grade 1 Genesis Beasts were needed for the Thirty Six Beast Channel Opening Rune. Thus, some time was required to gather the ingredients. However, it was not urgent and in any case, he could use this period of time to temper himself.He could feel that he was growing a little stronger each day, strength not of the body but of the mind. At the very least, he was confident that the current him was able to effortlessly beat the him from before entering the Black Forest Mountain Range.\u2026While Zhou Yuan was killing Genesis Beasts in the Black Forest Mountain Range, certain events had occurred in Great Zhou City. The most notable amongst them was that Qi Manor had been robbed and was rumored to have lost something very important. The entire Qi Manor had practically been turned inside out and the search for the thieves ultimately extended throughout the city, causing it to become abuzz with activity.However, this was after all an affair of Qi Manor. Therefore, everyone merely watched from the sidelines, even gloating somewhat before no longer paying any attention.Ta ta!On the second day after Qi Manor was burgled, the housekeeper of the manor, Qi Ling, led a group of men out the city, heading straight for the Black Forest Mountain Range where some clues were said to have been found.Qi Ling stood with his hands behind his back at the entrance to the Black Forest Mountain Range. His deep set eyes were fixed onto the mountain range like an eagle's.Someone reported from behind in a low voice, \"Master Qi, the men have already entered the Black Forest Mountain Range and are closing in on the target.\"Qi Ling nodded and said, \"Prepare to search the mountains and make sure to cause a bigger disturbance. We will be heading to where Lu Tieshan is.\"\"Roger!\" The person behind him responded before waving his hand as a dozen figures shot out and flew towards the mountain range.Half a day later.At a certain location in the mountain range, Lu Tieshan was seated cross-legged in front a towering tree. He suddenly opened his eyes, his gaze firmly fixed on the forests in front of him as he shouted in stern voice, \"Who?!\"Behind him, several figures grasped the weapons at their side as the Genesis Qi in their bodies began to circulate.\"Hehe, no need to be nervous brother Lu, it's me.\" A chuckle emerged from the forests followed by Qi Ling and his men.\"Qi Ling?\" Lu Tieshan was stunned before he frowned and asked, \"What are you doing here?\"Qi Ling helplessly replied, \"The manor has been burgled and the thieves seem to have hidden themselves in the Black Forest Mountain Range. Me and my men have chased them all the way here.\"Lu Tieshan's furrowed brows relaxed a little. He had heard of the recent Qi Manor burglary. Though he looked as large as a bear, he was very prudent and cautious, else he would not have become a captain of the imperial guard. Thus, although he seemed to have relaxed his guard, he tilted his head and instructed the imperial guards behind him, \"Send two men to protect his highness.\"Two imperial guards immediately responded and stealthily withdrew.Qi Ling was all smiles as he watched this happen. As he walked forward to greet Lu Tieshan, the hand behind his back lightly waved as shadows seemed to retreat in the dark.\u2026In the valley, Yaoyao was seated on a rock, her long legs folded under her while Tuntun lay on her lap. Her fine black hair draped over her shoulders, while the dried yellow leaves of an ancient cedar fell behind her. This beautiful scene was akin to a painting.Roar!Suddenly, the lazy Tuntun on Yaoyao's lap opened its eyes and looked towards the nearby darkness as a roar was released from its throat.Yaoyao's brows knitted together slightly as she also raised her pretty face and looked in the same direction.\"Heh heh. I never imagined that I would meet such an extremely gorgeous little lady in the deep mountains.\" A voice that was filled with evilness echoed from the darkness as two figures slowly walked out.Both figures had the back of a tiger and the waist of a bear. The one in front had a tattoo on his face, while an ominous look brewed in his eyes. At this current moment, his gaze seemed to burn like magma as he stared at the lovely figure nearby as if he was about to swallow the latter in the single gulp.The man with a tattoo on his face said to his partner as he pointed towards the nearby woods, \"Luo Tong, you go deal with the target. He should be nearby.\"Although he was speaking, his eyes remained tightly glued to Yaoyao's body.\"That kid should have only opened four meridian channels. You will be able to easily dispatch him with your six channel strength.\"Although the man called Luo Tong was somewhat reluctant when he heard this, he did not dare to go against the tattoo-face man's words. After all, the latter had already stepped into the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage.Luo Tong licked his lips and said, \"Boss, you have to leave a bite of such a high quality good for me. I have never seen such a pretty girl in my life.\"\"Haha, don't worry. I will definitely wait for you to return, but you must be quick.\" The perverse light in the tattoo-face man's eyes blossomed as he grinned.\"Great.\" Luo Tong nodded his head in a satisfied manner when he heard this before he quickly shot towards the forest.Upon seeing Luo Tong leave, the tattoo-face man beamed as he walked towards the Yaoyao, who had not moved from the spot. He looked at the latter's alluring hands and her beautiful breathtaking face as he felt a fire burn in his body.\"Little beauty, come have some fun with me. I will be very gentle with you.\" The tattoo-face man did not sense any Genesis Qi undulations from Yaoyao's body and hence was not even the slightest bit wary. His eyes wantonly swept across her figure as he grinned.Yaoyao shot an indifferent look at him. Not even the slightest fluctuation could be seen in her bright eyes. Her calm appearance caused the tattoo-face man to be stunned as he felt a tiny bit of unease.\"Tuntun.\"Before he could do anything else, Yaoyao's red lips had already opened slightly. Her clear and sweet voice was completely ice-cold.As Yaoyao's voice faded, the tattoo-face man's pupils immediately shrank. He watched in horror as the tiny body of the originally pet-like Tuntun lying on Yaoyao's lap began to grow. Its fur receded and in its place grew scarlet red scales. A pair of scarlet red animal eyes were br.i.m.m.i.n.g with endless ferocity, while black light faintly emerged in the slightly opened mouth of the creature as if it could devour all things.In the blink of an eye, the originally cute little pet had become a mysterious and horrible beast. An ominous aura dashed into the sky, while an alarming pressure slowly spread from its body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Subsequently, he conveniently wiped his b.l.o.o.d.y fist on its fur.It was a Wind Tiger. An extremely quick Genesis Beast that was considerably difficult to deal with amongst the grade 1 Genesis Beasts. Fortunately, Zhou Yuan had the Dragon Step. Its ability to make him akin to the mist had just barely brought him victory.\"This is the thirty sixth grade 1 Genesis Beast\u2026\" Zhou Yuan smiled as he bent over to lift it up.Swis.h.!.+It was at this moment that a flash of cold light suddenly shot out from the darkness, heading straight for Zhou Yuan's heart at a crafty angle.However, just as the flash of cold light was about to hit Zhou Yuan, his arm jerked, causing the tiger corpse to slant and block his heart. The flash of cold light pierced the corpse, the entire blade of the dagger firmly lodging itself into its flesh. From this, one could see just how powerful the force behind it had been.\"Eh?\" A cry of surprise involuntarily echoed from the darkness when the hit missed.\"Who is it? Come out!\" The sudden ruthless sneak attack caused Zhou Yuan's expression to change. With another jerk of his arm, the tiger corpse was sent smas.h.i.+ng towards the darkness.A figure swiftly shot out from the darkness, pus.h.i.+ng off on the tiger corpse with a foot before landing in front of Zhou Yuan like a feather.Zhou Yuan frowned as he looked at the bulky man with an ominous look in his eyes and asked, \"Who are you?\"\"The one who has come for your life.\" The one who had come was naturally Luo Tong. He gazed at Zhou Yuan, a look of contempt rising from the corners of his mouth as he icily said, \"Kid, obediently receive your death. The little beauty back there is still waiting for me to enjoy her!\"Zhou Yuan expression immediately changed upon hearing this, but he quickly regained his calm. Although Yaoyao might seem as powerless as a bound up chicken, Zhou Yuan knew how deceiving that appearance was. Moreover, there was an enigmatic Tuntun at her side protecting her.It was likely that Yaoyao would be fine even in the face of a Heaven Gate stage expert. Heaven Gate experts were the most powerful pract.i.tioners in Great Zhou and would not appear so easily.Although Zhou Yuan had calmed down, cold light flickered in his eyes. These b.a.s.t.a.r.ds that dared to have designs on Yaoyao truly deserved to die.Zhou Yuan's five fingers slowly clenched as he said, \"I guarantee that you will not be able to walk out of the Black Forest Mountain Range alive today.\"\"You overestimate yourself brat! Watch how I kill you with a single punch!\" Luo Tong grinned hideously upon hearing this. In a flash, his figure had already charged forward, five fingers turning into a fist surrounded by flowing Genesis Qi as a sonic boom rang out. Luo Tong had the strength of six channels and the power of his punch was definitely astonis.h.i.+ng.However, Zhou Yuan's expression was calm in the face of Luo Tong's ferocious punch. The former's tightly clenched fist also ferociously thrust forward.\"A mere four channel dares to exchange fists with me?\" Luo Tong's hideous smile grew even wider when he saw this, believing that Zhou Yuan was making a mistake due to his immaturity. Luo Tong immediately put more power into his attack, intending to break Zhou Yuan's arm with this punch.Boom!However, the hideous smile on Luo Tong's face turned a little rigid when their fists collided. He could feel that the power from Zhou Yuan's fist was not any weaker than his own six channel power!\"How is this possible?\"Luo Tong's heart shook slightly, knowing that he had encountered a tough foe. As such, he no longer dared to show any more contempt. His fist abruptly changed into a claw, finger-winds ripping through the air as an attack that seemed to flicker with cold light slashed at Zhou Yuan's throat.Zhou Yuan's feet inclined at an angle and moved, displaying the Dragon Step, while his body seemed to flicker, appearing somewhat blurry.The formidable finger-winds missed Zhou Yuan's body by three inches while he quickly followed up with a powerful punch aimed at Luo Tong's face. The attack was both fierce and direct, not showing even the slightest mercy.The rapidly growing fist reflected in Luo Tong's eyes caused alarm to shoot through his heart as his body suddenly jolted. \"Six channels open!\"Boom!The surrounding Genesis Qi surged over and poured into Luo Tong's body. His clothes immediately began to flap about as Genesis light flowed out from his pores, covering him in a faint glow.Boom!Zhou Yuan's fist slammed into the Genesis Qi light flowing on Luo Tong's face, but was unable to advance any further. Instead, Zhou Yuan was catapulted backwards by the threads of Genesis Qi.\"To have forced me to open six channels to deal with you, you can die with no regrets!\" Luo Tong gnashed his teeth in rage. The fact that he had almost suffered a lost against a four channel brat had made him extremely angry.Swis.h.!.+Luo Tong shot forward once again, his speed even greater this time. A night-black glow emerged from his fingertips as the faint foul smell spread.\"Mid grade Genesis technique, Black Ghost Palm.\"Zhou Yuan's eyes narrowed slightly and extended his hand in a slow and heavy manner as if he was carrying a giant mountain. However, every tiny s.h.i.+ft of his hand would cause piercing sounds to emerge from the surrounding air.\"Four channels open!\"The meridian channels in Zhou Yuan's body vibrated, emitting a suction force that continuously absorbed the surrounding Genesis Qi into the body, turning it into surging power that poured into Zhou Yuan's hand.A faint but imposing pressure spread from Zhou Yuan's body.\"Dragon Tablet Hand, split the earth.\" A soft voice was gently spat out from his mouth.Over this period of fighting and killing Genesis Beasts, Zhou Yuan was finally able to use the second level of the Dragon Tablet Hand.Bang!The ground beneath Zhou Yuan's feet seemed to shake violently as his fist flew forward. The air in front of it was ripped apart as an overwhelming force spurted out.\"Genesis Qi leaving the body?!\" Luo Tong was astonished. Such a phenomenon could only be done with the strength of the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage or through a Black tier Genesis technique that far surpa.s.sed ordinary Genesis techniques.But how could a four channel brat possibly master a Black tier Genesis technique?However, no matter how shocked he was, the faintly glowing deadly fist-winds had already surged over and slammed into his chest without giving him any time to dodge.Bang!Luo Tong's body was sent flying backwards like a cannonball as he wildly vomited a mouthful of fresh blood. Ignoring his heavy injuries, he crawled up and started to run. After the previous exchange, he had already realised that the battle power of the mere four channel youth was terrifying.Iciness flashed in Zhou Yuan's eyes when he saw Luo Tong run. A Genesis Rune emerged on his throat as Zhou Yuan opened his mouth and roared.Grade 1 Genesis Rune, Tiger Roar Rune!A sound wave rippled outwards, causing Luo Tong's body to stiffen momentarily. His head was spun while the Qi and blood in his body churned.By the time he regained his senses, it was too late to even cry out as Zhou Yuan's hand slammed into his head, knocking him unconscious.Zhou Yuan glanced at the now unconscious Luo Tong, picked him up and started running towards the valley. Although he knew that Yaoyao had many tricks up her sleeve, he was still worried that something might happen.He ran to the valley as if there was a fire under his feet while panting heavily, painting an extremely miserable image.When he arrived at the valley however, he was immediately stunned by the sight before him. It was still peaceful and Yaoyao was seated on a rock, lightly tilting a jade bottle to sip from it while Tuntun yawned as it lay on the ground beside her.\"This\u2026\"Zhou Yuan was a little dazed. Not even the smallest traces of a battle could be seen.Zhou Yuan walked over and asked through pants. \"Big sis Yaoyao, are you alright?\"Yaoyao could not help but smile slightly when she saw the anxious eyes of the rather miserable looking Zhou Yuan. There was a sliver of warmth in her smile as she shook her head and replied, \"I'm fine.\"She paused before continuing, \"But a little accident happened to a rather unlucky fellow.\"Zhou Yuan hurriedly asked, \"Where is he?\"Yaoyao extended a finger and pointed at Tuntun. In response, it wagged its tail and spit out a jade scroll. She then pointed at the jade scroll and smiled, \"That's all that's left.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41 Auraflare TechniquePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"That's all that's left?\"Zhou Yuan blankly stared at the jade scroll Tuntun had spat out before he suddenly understood. That unlucky fellow had been swallowed by Tuntun.\"What an unfortunate way to die.\" The corners of Zhou Yuan's lips twitched as he felt a huge amount of sympathy. What a tragic fate, he wondered just how much mental damage the poor soul had suffered towards the end.Zhou Yuan bent over, picked up the jade scroll and took a look, only to be stunned. He had seen a glow emerge from the jade scroll and was barely able to make out the numerous words contained within.Yaoyao off-handedly said, \"It's probably used to record a Genesis technique.\"\"Eh?\" Zhou Yuan's eyes brightened when he heard this. It was not worthwhile for ordinary Normal tier Genesis techniques to be recorded in such a manner. Could those two thugs actually possess something good?Zhou Yuan poured Genesis Qi into the jade scroll, causing the light on it to flicker. A ray of light was projected onto the air above as clear words began to flow downwards.Zhou Yuan scanned it as his eyes narrowed slightly. \"Low grade Black tier Genesis technique, Auraflare technique?\"\"It's a Black tier Genesis technique?\" Zhou Yuan was a little emotionally moved. A Black tier Genesis technique was considered a treasure even to the royal treasury and was normally used to reward those who did great services for the country.\"Why does this Auraflare technique sound a little familiar?\" Zhou Yuan pondered. He had a faint feeling that he had heard of it somewhere before.\"I remember! Qi Manor! This Auraflare Technique is one of best Genesis techniques of Qi Manor and it is said to have been bestowed onto them by the Great Wu Empire.\" Zhou Yuan's expression fluctuated indeterminately. Were these two thugs from Qi Manor? But given their strength, how could they possibly be in possession of one of Qi Manor's top Genesis techniques?Zhou Yuan shook his head, unable to understand.However, although he could not figure it out, Zhou Yuan still let out an icy laugh and shoved the jade scroll into his clothes. He recalled that Zhou Qing had once told him that Qi Manor's Auraflare technique was extremely formidable. Although it was only a low grade Black tier Genesis technique, its power was great enough to match techniques at the mid grade Black tier.Since such an item had landed in his hands, don't even think about letting him spit it out.\"But why is captain Lu not here yet?\" Zhou Yuan raised his head and peered into the distance as he frowned. Given the sharp senses of a Heaven Gate stage expert, he should have felt that something was wrong, right?\u2026An hour earlier.Lu Tieshan had dispatched two imperial guards to protect Zhou Yuan, but after a long time, he sensed some activity in the nearby forest.\"Go!\"Lu Tieshan frowned and suddenly stood up. Without saying anything to Qi Ling, Genesis Qi surged around his body as his transformed into a flash of light that shot towards the direction of the disturbance.Several minutes later, Lu Tieshan's figure appeared and gazed at an empty clearing to his front where four people were fighting. Two of them were the guards he had sent to protect Zhou Yuan earlier.\"What are you doing?!\" Lu Tieshan waved his sleeve as a torrent of Genesis Qi light burst forth, splitting up the four people.When the two imperial guards saw Lu Tieshan, they hastily said, \"Sir, we were rus.h.i.+ng to his highness location when these two appeared and obstructed us.\"\"Are you two seeking death?!\" Lu Tieshan's turned eerily cold when he heard this and immediately looked towards the other two individuals.\"Please do not be angered captain Lu. They are from Qi Manor and I previously instructed them to search for the thieves. They might have mistaken your men for the thieves.\" Qi Ling rushed over from behind with an apologetic face. He then turned towards the two individuals and scolded, \"Still not going to scram? You hindrances!\"Lu Tieshan's eyes were ice-cold as he watched this, before his stare turned towards Qi Ling. \"Qi Ling, what exactly are you plotting?\"\"Roar!\"Qi Ling chuckled. Just as he was about to speak, the roar of a tiger suddenly emerged from the nearby forest.\"Tiger Roar Rune?! Oh no! It's his highness!\" Lu Tieshan's pupils abruptly shrank when he heard the tiger roar. He suddenly seemed to understand something at this moment as his twisted face turned to Qi Ling. \"How b.a.l.l.sy of you Qi Ling!\"\"Hehe, I do not know what captain Lu is talking about.\" Qi Ling smiled. It was likely that those two thieves had already succeeded by now, right?Lu Tieshan thundered, \"If anything happens to his highness, I will not let you off!\" The Genesis Qi around his body suddenly erupted as his foot stomped on the ground, splitting the earth as his figure rose into the sky like a rainbow, heading straight for the valley.Qi Ling watched Lu Tieshan's hurrying figure as a sneer emerged from the corners of his lips. With a wave of his hand, he swiftly followed with his men.The group travelled as quickly as they could and reached the valley after some time.Qi Ling was all smiles as he walked out of the forest and looked towards the valley. He believed the place should be a mess and expected to see a half dead Zhou Yuan.With such thoughts in mind, the smile on his lips grew even wider.However, in the next moment, he suddenly saw something nearby. A thin youth was staring at him with a smile.Qi Ling's smile froze.\"Zhou Yuan? Why is he fine?!\" The corners of Qi Ling's eyes twitched slightly as he cried out in both rage and disbelief in his heart.Meanwhile, Lu Tieshan sighed in relief as if a heavy burden had been lifted from his shoulders before he kneeled on one knee and said, \"Punish me for my late arrival your highness!\"\"Please stand captain Lu, I am fine.\" Zhou Yuan smiled.Lu Tieshan stood up, his eyes br.i.m.m.i.n.g with an ominous light as he cast his gaze at the unconscious Luo Tong and frostily said, \"Is this the one who attacked your highness?\"\"It's the thief!\"However, before Zhou Yuan could speak, a furious howl emerged from behind Lu Tieshan. Qi Ling swiftly walked forward, grabbed Luo Tong and sent a slap flying towards him.\"Speak! Where is the item you stole from Qi Manor?!\"The unconscious Luo Tong was slapped awake. When he saw Qi Ling's twisted face, he hastily struggled as he tried to speak, \"Qi\u2026\"\"Stubborn pig! Die!\" However, before he could finish speaking, Qi Ling's eyes turned frosty as a force spurted out from his hand and crushed Luo Tong's neck.Luo Tong's wide-opened eyes stared at Qi Ling as if he was unable to believe what had just happened.Qi Ling ignored the dead man's gaze and ripped apart the corpse's clothes, searching all over for something. Moments later, he stopped with an extremely ugly expression.\"Qi Ling, why does it seem that you are silencing the culprit?\" Lu Teishan's eyes were eerily dark. With a wave of his hand, the dozen imperial guards stealthily encircled Qi Ling.Qi Ling's expression remained unchanged as he replied in an indifferent tone, \"What is captain Lu saying. The fact that this thief dared to touch his highness warrants a death sentence. What's more, they even stole Qi Manor's Auraflare technique.\"\"Auraflare technique?\" Lu Tieshan was stunned. Qi Manor's Auraflare technique had been stolen?Qi Ling looked towards Zhou Yuan and cupped his hands together, \"Your highness, there were two thieves. Do you know where the other thief is? Qi Manor's Auraflare technique should still be in his hands.\"Zhou Yuan smiled upon hearing this. \"That I have no idea. I only saw one person. The other one might have escaped with the treasure.\"Qi Ling's face twitched as he said in a certain manner, \"Impossible!\"Zhou Yuan seemed to smile as he said, \"Why is housekeeper Qi so certain that he did not escape?\"Qi Ling's heart jumped, the expression in his eyes fluctuating indeterminately.\"I really have not seen the other person. Housekeeper Qi can continue to search for him.\" Zhou Yuan waved his hand as he continued in an indifferent voice, \"It's rather messy here so I shall not insist on housekeeper Qi staying.\"Upon seeing that Zhou Yuan was chasing them away, Qi Ling's expression turned extremely ugly. They had originally planned on dealing with Zhou Yuan today, but not only was the latter safe and sound, the Auraflare technique had even gone missing. This was practically a double whammy. King Qi would definitely be enraged when he returned.Although Qi Ling did not know exactly what had happened here, he had a feeling that the Auraflare technique was now in Zhou Yuan's hands. But what could he do? How could he possibly forcibly search Zhou Yuan? Did they think he was blind to how Lu Tieshan was eyeing him as if the latter wanted to swallow him whole?As these thoughts churned in his heart, Qi Ling could only clench his jaw and cup his fists together. Without saying another word, he waved his hand, and led his men away in a dejected manner.He knew that Qi Manor had suffered a truly huge loss this time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42 Thirty Six Beast Channel Opening RunePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Your highness.\"Lu Tieshan watched Qi Ling depart. What had happened today was definitely related to Qi Manor, hence he was rather unwilling to let them off so easily.Zhou Yuan waved his hand and said, \"They are very clever and have likely long prepared an excuse. In addition, the two culprits are already dead and they will never admit to anything unless we declare war on them now.\"Upon hearing Zhou Yuan's words, Lu Tieshan's heart s.h.i.+vered a little. Looks like the other thief had indeed died here. However, there was something that puzzled him. The other thief was rumoured to have the strength of the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage, but Zhou Yuan and Yaoyao, who gave off no Genesis Qi undulations, were the only ones here. Just how did that Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage thief die?Lu Tieshan's heart was filled with questions, but knew that it was no appropriate to ask. Hence, all he could say was, \"Your highness, I will send men to inform his majesty of this matter.\"Zhou Qing needed to know that such a thing had happened so as to take further precautions.Zhou Yuan nodded and Lu Tieshan withdrew with his men. However, they did not station themselves too far this time to be avoid being separated from the prince. Thus, they ended up standing guard just outside the valley.\u2026In the valley, Yaoyao looked at the thirty six bottles that had been placed in front of her, bottles that contained the essence blood of thirty six different grade 1 Genesis Beasts. After checking them, she nodded and said, \"Not bad, all the ingredients have been gathered. Let me make some preparations first. I'll help you inscribe the Thirty Six Beast Channel Opening Rune tomorrow.\"Zhou Yuan nodded in a rather expectant manner. Soon after, he asked, \"Big sis Yaoyao, what grade is the Thirty Six Beast Channel Opening Rune?\"Zhou Yuan had never seen a Genesis Rune that could aid one in the unblocking of channels, and no one in the entire Great Zhou knew of such a rune. From this, one could see just how precious the rune was.Yaoyao off-handedly replied \"It's a grade 2 Genesis Rune. I will teach you when you reach the second level of the Primal Chaos Divine Grindstone Visualisation Method.\"Zhou Yuan scratched his head as he asked, \"May I teach it to others?\"The Thirty Six Beast Channel Opening Rune was very valuable, especially to Great Zhou. Although there was some risk, the success rate should be pretty decent if those with strong will power were selected.Hence, if he could impart it to the army, it would definitely raise the strength of many Channel Opening stage pract.i.tioners and make Great Zhou stronger.However, the rune belonged to Yaoyao after all. Her permission was needed if he wanted to teach it to others.Yaoyao fiddled with the bottles as she indifferently said, \"No need to ask me if you want to impart it to others. Everything was taught to me by grandpa Hei. As his disciple, you naturally have the right to do with them as you please.\"\"Thank you big sis Yaoyao!\"Zhou Yuan was both delighted and grateful. A grade 2 Genesis Rune might be nothing to Yaoyao, but it was extremely valuable to Great Zhou.\"Go rest. Tomorrow, we will try out the effect of this Thirty Six Beast Channel Opening Rune.\"\"Okay.\"\u2026\"What? The Auraflare technique has gone missing?!\"Qi Manor.When Qi Yue heard Qi Ling's words, he quickly stood up as his face turned ashen, fire practically spitting out of his eyes.Upon seeing Qi Yue's man-eating appearance, Qi Ling could only brace himself as he nodded and said, \"By the time I rushed over, Luo Tong had already been captured, while not even Luo Hao's shadow was to be seen.\"Qi Yue gritted his teeth and said, \"Luo Hao is at the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage and it is impossible for Zhou Yuan to be his match, while the girl Yaoyao does not even give off any Genesis Qi undulations. Hence, Luo Hao cannot possibly be dead!\"Qi Ling said with some hesitation, \"Could he have run with the treasure?\"\"Does that dog have the b.a.l.l.s?\" Cold light flowed in Qi Yue's eyes as he continued, \"Send out pictures of him and spare no efforts in searching. We need to find the Auraflare technique at all costs!\"One must know that the Auraflare technique was bestowed upon his father by the Great Wu Empire, and was one of the strongest Genesis techniques of Qi Manor. Only those who have done great service to the manor would obtain the right to learn it. Now that it had been lost by him, one could imagine just how furious Qi Yuan would be when he returned.Qi Yue felt his scalp grow numb when he imagined that scene.Qi Yue's face was warped as he deeply breathed in and lifted the tea cup by his side. However, he was ultimately unable to calm the raging fire in his heart and the tea cup was viciously smashed into the ground.\"Zhou Yuan, I will not let you off!\"In the room, Qi Yue's voice was so full of fury that it sounded like the howl of a beast.He had originally planned on teaching Zhou Yuan a lesson, but events had spiralled out of his control. How could the prideful Qi Yue accept this?\u2026Early morning. A chill blanketed the forest, covering the lush green leaves with a thin layer of frost.Yaoyao lightly shook the transparent bottle in her hand, a bottle half filled with a thick and viscous red liquid. As the bottle swayed back and forth, a savage aura gushed out and the faint howls of beasts could be heard.\"Just this little from so much essence blood?\" Zhou Yuan was shocked. A whole thirty six bottles of grade 1 Genesis Beast heart-blood and not even half a bottle was produced.\"Yes. I only collected the most quintessential part. The savage energy within the blood of thirty six Genesis Beasts have been gathered in this bottle, causing the savage energy to multiply.\"\"This half bottle about should be enough for five attempts.\"Yaoyao twirled the jade-green Genesis Rune Brush in her hand before beckoning to Zhou Yuan with her chin, \"Take off your clothes.\"Zhou Yuan did not delay. He shed his clothes, revealing a healthy-looking body. Although his muscles were not huge, they were well defined and looked full of manliness.\"Your figure is not bad.\"Yaoyao's expression was unperturbed but she still offhandedly praised.Zhou Yuan felt a little embarra.s.sed.The corners of Yaoyao's small red mouth lifted slightly. Soon after, her face turned serious as she instructed, \"Closely guard your heart and do not allow the savage energy to invade your mind or your Spirit will be wounded.\"Zhou Yuan took in a deep breath upon hearing this and steadied his heart as if he was about to face a formidable foe.When Yaoyao saw this, the brush in her hand dipped into some of the vicious essence blood before slowly descending.When brush tip moved, Zhou Yuan could not help but draw in a breath of cold air. It felt as if the brush had been dipped into magma, bringing a burning sensation to his skin.Cryptic Genesis strokes continuously appeared on Zhou Yuan's back. This went on for several minutes before Yaoyao's snow-white hand shook gently and final stroke descended.\"The preparations are done!\"At the same time, her gentle sounding shout rang out by Zhou Yuan's ear.Buzz!The instant her voice was heard, blood red light immediately blossomed on Zhou Yuan's back as beast roars rang out one after another.Zhou Yuan pupils abruptly tightened at this moment. He could feel a ruthless to the extreme presence maniacally pour into his back, charging into the interior of his body.Roar roar roar!Savage beast roars echoed in Zhou Yuan's mind, causing him to feel a wave of dizziness as if his conscious was being bitten by numerous beasts.Fortunately, Zhou Yuan was prepared. The Spirit between his brows buzzed slightly as he began visualising the Primal Chaos Divine Grindstone. The divine grindstone turned and the menacing beast roars were pulverised till nothing remained.His dazed consciousness gradually began to recover.Subsequently, Zhou Yuan felt a stream of heat appear in his body, a barbaric scalding heat that charged about in his body.He knew that this stream of heat was the power of the Thirty Six Beast Channel Opening Rune.With a thought, he directed the stream of heat towards the blocked fifth meridian channel.The stream of heat charged in, causing a faint loosening sensation to appear in the originally blocked fifth channel.Joy bubbled in Zhou Yuan's heart when he felt this change. He focused even more on controlling the heat to continuously attack the channel.When the stream of heat finally dissipated a long time later, a small portion of the originally tightly blocked fifth channel had been forced open. This progress made Zhou Yuan overjoyed. It was not less effective than his first time in the Jade Spirit Waterfall.Phew.Zhou Yuan opened his eyes and spat out a breath that smelled of blood. He did not care about the stench, his eyes s.h.i.+ning brightly.The effectiveness of the Thirty Six Beast Channel Opening Rune had exceeded his expectations.At this rate, he was confident that he would be able to completely unblock his fifth meridian channel in a month.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 Learning the Auraflare TechniquePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the following period of time, Zhou Yuan engaged in daily channel unblocking attempts with the help of the Thirty Six Beast Channel Opening Rune. It must be said that although this channel opening rune was rather dangerous, its effectiveness was astonis.h.i.+ngly good.In a mere few days, Zhou Yuan's fifth meridian channel grew increasingly loose as the blocked portions were continuously cleared.At this rate, completely unblocking the fifth channel was practically just around the corner.However, there was some slight delay due to the troublesome ingredient procurement process. The heart-blood Zhou Yuan had painstakingly gathered for such a long time could only last for five uses. Therefore, he had not choice but to spend the majority of each day hunting grade 1 Genesis Beasts and acquire more heart-blood.In the blink of an eye, ten days pa.s.sed in the mountain forest....Bang!In the forest. An entirely blood-red giant of a creature charged at Zhou Yuan, who had just killed a Genesis Beast. The former was extremely ferocious, leaving Zhou Yuan no choice but to jump onto the branches of a tall tree with a push of his foot, avoiding the blood-red creature's charge.Having chased Zhou Yuan away, the giant beast ignored the former's furious gaze as it lowered its head and began to tear apart the Genesis Beast corpse Zhou Yuan had killed.\"This G.o.d d.a.m.ned b.a.s.t.a.r.d!\"Atop the tree, Zhou Yuan could not help but curse when he saw this. However, there was nothing he could do as he had no way to deal with the giant blood-red creature.This creature was known as the Flame Plate Rhino and was a grade 1 Genesis Beast. However, it was extremely hard to deal with compared to other grade 1 Genesis Beasts. Its strength was comparable to a six channel human pract.i.tioner, but its defence could match a seven channel expert, power that allowed it to reign as the little tyrant of this particular zone.Even Zhou Yuan's Dragon Tablet Hand did not have much of an effect on the exceptional defensive prowess of this Genesis Beast, while the Heavenly Yuan Brush could only leave b.l.o.o.d.y scratches but was unable to do any real damage.Hence, Zhou Yuan chose to avoid the Flame Plate Rhino whenever he encountered it, but who could have expected that the b.a.s.t.a.r.d would grow more and more unreasonable, even beginning to steal his kill today.It was clear that Zhou Yuan had now been targeted by the Flame Plate Rhino due to his frequent hunting of Genesis Beasts in the area.\"I'm being bullied by a beast.\"Zhou Yuan did not know whether to laugh or to cry, but he knew that there was no point in lingering. Thus, he decisively turned around and dashed forward, the tip of his feet pus.h.i.+ng off one giant tree after another as he rushed out of the forest, hurrying back to the valley.In the valley, Yaoyao was a little surprised when she saw that Zhou Yuan had returned empty handed.Zhou Yuan awkwardly explained when he saw Yaoyao's gaze, \"I was robbed by a Flame Plate Rhino.\"Yaoyao was unable to restrain her smile when she heard this. \"The Flame Plate Rhino has strong defensive ability and even a seven channel human pract.i.tioner will find it very troublesome to deal with. You might be able to break through its defences if your Heavenly Yuan Brush reaches the upper tier Genesis Weapon level.\"Zhou Yuan nodded. He had been feeding the Heavenly Yuan Brush daily but still had yet to light the second ancient Genesis Rune.The corners of Yaoyao's mouth bent slightly as she said, \"If you do not think of a way to deal with this Flame Plate Rhino, I'm afraid that you will not be able to hunt anymore Genesis Beasts unless you change location.\"The corners of Zhou Yuan's mouth pulled downwards. Chased away by a rhino? He really could not afford to be humiliated in this manner. Therefore, he had to think of some way to deal with it.\"Although the Dragon Tablet Hand is bold and unyielding, it is indeed a little lacking in the face of such a highly defensive Genesis Beast.\" A look of thought emerged in Zhou Yuan's eyes. He needed to learn a Genesis skill that could amplify his offensive power.As his thoughts reached this point, something suddenly hit him as he reached into his clothes and retrieved a jade scroll. It was the Auraflare technique he had obtained a few days ago.\"I should take a look at the technique that is so highly valued by Qi Manor.\"Zhou Yuan seated himself and poured Genesis Qi into the scroll. Light was immediately emitted, s.h.i.+ning on the air in front of him as words started to flow.Zhou Yuan focused on the words. They were the introduction and cultivation method for the Auraflare technique.\"Oh, this Auraflare technique is somewhat peculiar.\" While Zhou Yuan was immersed in the cultivation method of the Auraflare technique, he suddenly heard a cry surprise. He turned his head, only to find that Yaoyao was standing beside him. Her bright penetrating eyes were glued to the screen of light.Zhou Yuan nodded in agreement. Having just looked through it, he now knew the theory behind the Auraflare technique. Basically, this technique made use of a unique method to continuously compress the Genesis Qi in the meridian channels, concentrating it.After continuous compression, the Genesis Qi would become highly concentrated, giving it astonis.h.i.+ng force and piercing power.Zhou Yuan exclaimed in admiration, \"As expected of a Black tier Genesis technique. Its profoundness far surpa.s.ses Normal tier Genesis techniques.\"A thoughtful look was revealed in Yaoyao's eyes as she said, \"This technique is rather interesting. It looks simple but it takes a very extreme approach of compressing Genesis Qi to the limit.\"\"The true rank of this Auraflare technique should not be merely low grade Black tier. However, it is somewhat incomplete.\"\"Incomplete?\" Zhou Yuan's heart trembled a little. \"This Auraflare technique was given to king Qi by the Great Wu Empire. They may not have given him the complete version.\"Yaoyao nodded. \"You may try to learn this technique but you should know that high level compression of Genesis Qi in the meridian channels will be a huge burden on them. After all, a lapse in concentration might cause you to lose control and damage your meridian channels.\"However, Zhou Yuan smiled when he heard this. With regards to the toughness of meridian channels, it was likely extremely difficult to find anyone who could better him amongst those at the same cultivation level. After all, he was born with eight naturally open meridian channels and although they were subsequently sealed, the strong foundations remained.\"Then I'll give this Auraflare technique a go!\" It was obvious that Zhou Yuan was extremely interested in the Auraflare technique.As the saying went, do what you plan to. After informing Yaoyao, Zhou Yuan sat down in a cross-legged position. With a thought, a suction force was emitted from his channels, pulling strands of Genesis Qi into his body.As Genesis Qi poured into his channels, Zhou Yuan followed the compression method recorded in the Auraflare technique. He exerted control over each strand of Genesis Qi in his channels, making them slowly revolve.The compression method was called Spin Refining. One directed Genesis Qi to form a 'whirlpool' that spun at high speed, continuously compressing the Genesis Qi until the 'whirlpool' finally dissipated and a 'concentrated flare' was created.It seemed easy when described, but actually doing it was very difficult. After all, such level of control was not easy to achieve. If too much power was used, the pulling force would grow too strong and hurt the meridian channels.On the other hand, if too little power was used, the 'concentrated flare' would not be created.In the beginning, Zhou Yuan failed time and time again, the Genesis Qi whirlpools in his meridian channels dissipating each time. On the bright side, his strong Spirit made him aware of even the smallest details, allowing him to gradually learn from every failure.Hence, Zhou Yuan was already able to somewhat successfully utilise the Spin Refining method after an entire day.This went on for another five days.As the glorious sun rose into the sky, its scorching rays s.h.i.+ned down upon the seemingly endless Black Forest Mountain Range, covering it in a layer of golden gauze.In a certain valley, Zhou Yuan was silently seated on a rock. The view within his meridian channels however was completely different from the peacefulness on the outside. Genesis Qi whirlpools spun at high speeds, emitting 'ch ch' noises as a pulling force spread, causing the channels to twitch.This was only possible due to the toughness of Zhou Yuan's meridian channels. The channels of any other ordinary four channel pract.i.tioner would have been torn by this time. Even so, there was still a piercing pain that Zhou Yuan had to endured.Hummm!Faint vibration sounds could be heard within his meridian channels.Meanwhile, the whirlpools spun faster and faster, rapidly increasing the pulling force which in turn caused the piercing pain to intensify.Zhou Yuan's brows tightly scrunched together, but he did not plan on giving up. Instead, he braced himself and increased the rotation speed of the whirlpools.Boom!As the rotation speed rose, the strands of Genesis Qi lingering above it were compressed to the very center and in the next moment, the whirlpool exploded.Zhou Yuan's eyes abruptly opened. However, there was no disappointment on his face but instead overflowing joy.He extended his hand, making two fingers jut out. With a thought, a layer of extremely faint green light slowly emerged from his fingertips.The faint green light seemed to lengthen and shorten randomly and looked extremely feeble.Zhou Yuan's fingers suddenly slashed at the rock below him. One would only hear a 'shlick' sound as a stupefied Zhou Yuan watched the boulder being cleanly sliced open as if it was tofu, the rock within glossy as a mirror.Zhou Yuan's eyes s.h.i.+ned while his breathing became a little ragged.\"So this is the Auraflare technique? Such frightening sharpness and shocking penetrating power.\" Zhou Yuan was full of praise. A single attack would likely seriously injure anyone who was less than seven channels and even a seven channel expert would have no choice but to avoid such an attack.\"With this Auraflare technique, if that b.a.s.t.a.r.d dares to appear again, I will stab it dead with a single finger!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44 Su Youwei\u2019s ProgressPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"There are two levels to the Auraflare technique, the green flare and the purple flare. What you have currently has just barely reached the doorstep of the green flare level.\" Yaoyao explained from the side when she saw that Zhou Yuan had succeeded.Zhou Yuan nodded. He looked at the faint pulsing green light at his fingertips and said, \"The destructive power of this Auraflare technique is astonis.h.i.+ng indeed but there are some flaws. The Qi concentrating process is troublesome and it uses too much Genesis Qi.\"If he had not activated the Dragon Breathing technique and sucked in a mouthful of Genesis Qi, he would not have succeeded in creating this tiny green flare no matter how long he spent.With his current four channel strength, it took everything he had to create this tiny wisp of light. If it was to be used against an enemy, he would have to kill in a single strike or the light would automatically dissipate after some time.\"If only I could reach the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage.\" Zhou Yuan sighed. Reaching the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage was akin to entering the inner chambers from the main room. Once the Qi Dwelling was open, Genesis Qi could be stored in the body. This would be countless times better than his current pitiful state where he had to draw in strands of unpurified Genesis Qi from his surroundings every time he wanted to use it.With the support of sufficient Genesis Qi in the body, Black tier Genesis techniques would be able to display their true power.After sighing for a while, Zhou Yuan steadied his heart. After all, he had to take things one step at a time. What he needed to do now was to fully open his eight meridian channels, creating a better foundation for future cultivation.\"Alright then, it's time for me to go slaughter that b.a.s.t.a.r.d. A beast that dares to interfere with my training cannot be pardoned.\" Zhou Yuan stood up and called out to Yaoyao before his body shot forth, heading straight into the mountain forests.He could not wait to try out the might of the Auraflare technique.Once he entered the forest, Zhou Yuan rushed straight towards its depths. A long time later, he stood on a giant tree and sat down. He knew that the Flame Plate Rhino was extremely sensitive to presences and would likely discover him the moment he stepped into the deeper part of the forest. Thus, he only needed to wait for the rhino here.Zhou Yuan shut his eyes. After about ten minutes, he felt the ground begin to tremble and his gaze looked towards the depths of the forest, only to see towering trees falling one after another as a fire-red figure madly charged over, thunderous rumbling sounds in its wake.An over ten feet tall fire-red figure ultimately came to a stop in the clearing. Its scarlet eyes locked onto Zhou Yuan as grouchy snorting noises emerged from its mouth.It was the Flame Plate Rhino.The surface of its body seemed to be covered in fire-red armor, blazing hard armor that thoroughly protected it.\"You've come?\" Zhou Yuan grinned a little as he looked down from above at the Flame Plate Rhino. No longer did he avoid it like before. Instead, his figure leaped into the air and landed on the ground\"Bring it on you b.a.s.t.a.r.d.\" Zhou Yuan extended a finger towards the creature and beckoned.As if sensing Zhou Yuan's contempt, the madness in the Flame Plate Rhino's eyes immediately intensified. With a powerful stomp of its foot, the ground cracked open as its enormous figure transformed into fiery shadow that charged towards Zhou Yuan with terrifying momentum.Meanwhile, the thick flame armor on its body glowed with scarlet light as if it was burning.Even the air itself cackled under such force.Even a seven channel pract.i.tioner had no choice but to avoid the sure-kill charge of a Flame Plate Rhino.However, Zhou Yuan did not move nor showed no intentions of retreating. He merely lowered his gaze as Genesis Qi turned into whirlpools in his meridian channels, continuously compressing and refining.Several breaths later, Zhou Yuan slowly extended his hand as a faint green aura slowly surfaced.The aura pulsed indeterminately as Zhou Yuan's figure also dashed forward, colliding with the Flame Plate Rhino in the blink of an eye.At the moment of impact, Zhou Yuan's hand took the form of a blade and fiercely chopped downwards as splitting the mountains, slamming onto the ferocious face of the Flame Plate Rhino.Ch!A faint noise seemed to ring out when the hand landed. In the next instant, fresh blood wildly spurted out. The enormous body of the ferocious rhino had been sliced into two!Due to the tremendous momentum behind its giant body, the two halves of the rhino continued to charge forward for quite some distance before ultimately cras.h.i.+ng to the ground with a loud bang, dyeing the ground in fresh blood.On the other hand, Zhou Yuan remained unmoved on the spot, still in his chopping posture as a b.l.o.o.d.y mist descended. It sprayed on his face, making it appear enchantingly bizarre.The faint green glow gradually faded from his hand while Zhou Yuan's slightly tottering body gently fell the ground on his b.u.t.t. The previous chop had cleaned out all of his energy.He turned his head slightly, glancing at the two halves of the Flame Plate Rhino and could not help but grin.The destructive power of the Auraflare technique was really frightening.In addition, the new little tyrant of this area was now him, Zhou Yuan....Time pa.s.sed in the mountains.While Zhou Yuan concentrated on his training deep in the mountains, things were not going well for Qi Yue. No matter how they searched, they were unable to find any traces of Luo Hao, let alone the Auraflare technique.In a certain room, Qi Ling said with a rather ugly expression, \"Second young master, we have already extended the scope of our search to many cities but we are still unable to find even the slightest trace of Luo Hao. It's as if he vanished into thin air.\"Cold light flickered in Qi Yue's eyes. It was a long time later before he finally replied, \"If he can't be found even with this level of searching, I'm afraid that there might not even be a corpse left of him.\"Qi Ling frowned slightly. \"You are saying that he's been killed?\"Qi Yue clenched his jaw. \"Although I do not know who killed him, I have a feeling that the Auraflare technique is in Zhou Yuan's hands!\"Qi Ling's expression fluctuated . \"If that is so, it will be very troublesome.\"Ever since the previous incident, Zhou Qing had increased Zhou Yuan's level of protection. Lu Tieshan had also chased away all outsiders in the area Zhou Yuan was in. It was practically impossible to repeat the play they had staged before.A dark and vicious look appeared in Qi Yue's eyes. After some silence, he coldly said, \"Get me Liu Xi.\"Qi Ling looked at Qi Yue. Although he did not know what the latter was planning, he still did as instructed....The beautiful rays of the setting sun enveloped Great Zhou City.In the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute, Su Youwei had just left the inst.i.tute after her cla.s.ses, walking along the street towards the southern part of the city where her home was located. She did not linger for long in the inst.i.tute recently because Zhou Yuan was pretty much absent.A young girl's long and slender legs lightly hopped over a ditch. Her pony tail bouncing with the vigour of youth, drawing admiring gazes from pa.s.sersby.Pa.s.sing through familiar street after street, her footsteps suddenly stopped after taking a corner as she raised her head and looked to her front.Liu Xi was leaning against the wall, several figures behind her.Liu Xi's pretty face was icy as she coldly stared at Su Youwei. The latter's elegant appearance caused tiny embers of jealousy to flit across her eyes as she frostily smiled, \"Come walk with me Su Youwei.\"\"What do you plan on doing?\" Su Youwei's eyebrows knitted together slightly.Liu Xi coldly snorted, \"Humph, Zhou Yuan has stolen something from Qi Yue. You will be used to exchange for it.\"Su Youwei's pretty face turned a little frosty when she heard this. \"What a joke. Do you think that Qi Yue's things would even catch his highness' eyes?\"\"Sharp-tongued wench!\" Liu Xi's eyebrows turned almost turned vertical as she shouted, \"Catch her!\"The moment her words faded, two figures immediately shot out from behind her. Faint Genesis Qi undulations surrounded their bodies, testament to their five channel strength.Su Youwei did not move as she icily stared at the two individuals that were shooting towards her. It was only when the their hands grabbed at her like eagle claws that she suddenly made her move.Two fingers were thrust forward, jade light swirling around them while formidable Genesis Qi tore through the air like a mealstrom.Ch ch!The two fingers landed, causing the two figures to be sent flying backwards, fresh blood flowing from their shoulders.Su Youwei's hands hung by her side while Genesis Qi light swirled around her body, causing her aura to rise steadily.Liu Xi stared at Su Youwei, eyes wide open and her jaw clenched so hard she almost shattered her teeth. \"You've unblocked your sixth meridian channel?!\"She clearly remembered Su Youwei had only just unblocked her fifth meridian channel slightly over a month ago. How had she so quickly unblocked her sixth channel too?Su Youwei flatly replied, \"Unblocked it ten days ago.\"Su Youwei had not slouched off while Zhou Yuan was away from the inst.i.tute. She received the full efforts of headmaster Chu Tianyang's personal tutelage. After all, in Chu Tianyang's opinion, compared to the explosive Zhou Yuan, a stable type like Su Youwei was less worrying. Hence, he had done all he could to train her over this period of time.Thus, she had not been stagnant while Zhou Yuan was progressing.Liu Xi's face was steely green with anger, fire practically spitting from her eyes. She had only managed to unblock her sixth meridian channel half a month ago after lengthy amounts of training and a huge expenditure of resources. Yet, Su Youwei was now practically at her heels using only half the time. How could this not make her jealous.Liu Xi frostily said, \"Do you believe that you will be able to leave just because you have unblocked your sixth meridian channel?\"\"Liu Ye, go catch her for me. It will be best if you also carve up that little minx's face!\"As Liu Xi's words rang out, a figure slowly walked out from behind. Powerful Genesis Qi spread, displaying the strength of seven channels.Su Youwei's expression finally became grave when she saw this. However, while she was trying to think of a plan, her heart suddenly shook as two figures shot out from behind and landed at her side.They seemed to be ordinary men but the Genesis Qi undulations from their bodies had reached the level of seven channels.\"You are?\" Su Youwei was taken aback when she saw the two newcomers.The two replied with a soft chuckle, \"We were sent by his highness miss Su. His highness was worried that Qi Yue would let out his anger on you, thus we have been protecting you in secret.\"Su Youwei blinked when she heard this. Although she did not say anything, the corners of her mouth subconsciously raised a little while her sour mood due to Liu Xi's appearence took a turn for the better.The two men lifted their heads, looked Liu Xi and said in a flat voice, \"Please watch yourself miss Liu. Do not become Qi Yue's chess piece.\"Liu Xi's face had practically become purple due to the interference, but she knew that she could no longer do anything to Su Youwei.\"That blasted Zhou Yuan!\"Liu Xi furiously cursed. Abandoning the deadlock, she led her men and left with a stomp of her foot.The two imperial guards turned their heads and said to Su Youwei in a low voice, \"Miss Su, let us send you back home.\"\"I'll be troubling elder brothers.\" Su Youwei did not reject. She paused for a moment before continuing, \"Do you know how his highness is doing? He has been absent for almost two months.\"\"Don't worry miss Su, his highness is a crucial point in his training. He will definitely be back for the cla.s.s ranking exam in half a month.\"Su Youwei nodded. She did not know what would be the outcome of Zhou Yuan's training session, but she had heard that Qi Yue had already unblocked his seventh meridian channel. For their A cla.s.s to take back first place at the year-end cla.s.s ranking exam, a bitter battle could not be avoided...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45 Before the Class Ranking ExamPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the mountain forests.Zhou Yuan stood on a rock, five snarling giant green wolves currently circling him.These Wind Spirit Wolves were also grade 1 Genesis Beasts. They specialized in speed and were extremely difficult to deal with due to their pack nature. Even seven channel experts would avoid them as much as possible. They could be said to be the tyrants of this particular area.However, there was not much fear on Zhou Yuan's face but instead some eagerness.Swis.h.!.+One of the Wind Spirit Wolves took the lead and attacked, a green figure darting forward like a shadow, sharp claws ripping through the air as they mercilessly slashed at Zhou Yuan's back.However, its surprise attack was not the least bit effective. Zhou Yuan's figure seemed to flicker as it turned blurry, causing the sharp claws to slice through empty air.Bang!Zhou Yuan's counterattack was as swift as thunder. Five fingers tightly clenched into a fist as vigorous Genesis Qi surged around it. A punch slammed into the attacking wolf's waist, breaking bone with a crack and sending the wolf to its death.Ahwoo!The moment it died, scarlet red washed over the other four wolves eyes as they shot forward with a howl.\"Martial form!\"Zhou Yuan let out a hearty laugh as he charged towards the remaining four Wind Spirit Wolves. He grasped the growing Heavenly Yuan Brush and swung it horizontally like a long spear, sending one of the wolves flying.Ch ch!In the forest, a human exchanged vicious blows with four wolves. Zhou Yuan wielded the Heavenly Yuan Brush like a heavy metal spear, devastating force wreaking havoc as it swept forth, making it practically impossible for the four wolves to approach.The snow-white hairs of the brush tip flickered with sharpness, cutting deep and b.l.o.o.d.y wounds everytime it swept across a wolf's body.The battle started intensely and ended quickly.After several minutes, Zhou Yuan stood on the spot, the Heavenly Yuan Brush in his hand standing on the ground at a slightly slanted angle. Fresh blood dripped from the tip of the brush while the corpses of five WInd Spirit Wolves gradually turned cold around him.A breath was slowly spat out from Zhou Yuan's mouth while a stern glint surged in his eyes like a sharp blade. Two months of training in the mountain forest had given Zhou Yuan a faint aura of ferocity.\"Culture form.\"The Heavenly Yuan Brush in his hand swiftly shrunk, becoming a foot long again as Zhou Yuan stuck it back into his waistband.He raised his head, eyes narrowing slightly as he watched sunlight spill through the cracks in the trees and mumbled, \"Only a few days left till the cla.s.s ranking exam. It's about time to return.\"He had trained for about two months in the mountain forests and his fifth meridian channel had already been completely unblocked a month earlier.He had not returned because his channel opening speed would drop once he left this Genesis Beast infested mountain forests. Instead, he used the Genesis Beasts in the forest to temper himself.He bent down to dig out the Beast Spirit Crystals from the heads of the five Wind Spirit Wolves before turning around and leaving the forest. Half an hour later, he arrived at the valley.\"Are we returning?\" When Yaoyao saw that Zhou Yuan had returned, she seemed to know that he was ready to go back. She stretched lazily, displaying the enchanting outline of her waist.She had previously lived with Cang Yuan in a domain void of any other people and was used to this kind of life. Thus, her two months her had been rather leisurely.Zhou Yuan smiled and nodded before whistling. After a brief period, a dozen figures flew out from the mountain forests. They were the imperial guards that had been protecting him from the shadows.\"Inform captain Lu to prepare our return to Great Zhou City.\"Zhou Yuan watched the imperial guards withdraw before turning his head. His gaze seemed to penetrate the dense forests and see Great Zhou City.\"The guards reported some time ago that Qi Yue has already unblocked his seventh meridian channel\u2026 that guy does have some ability.\"Zhou Yuan's lips were tightly pursed as coldness surfaced in his eyes.Qi Yue had constantly caused trouble for him ever since he entered the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute and most recently even using such an underhanded tactic at the Jade Spirit Waterfall. Qi Yue had even tried to use Su Youwei to threaten Zhou Yuan after the former's subsequent loss of the Auraflare technique.These actions had already roused Zhou Yuan's desire to kill.\"There were never any chances in the past, but in the cla.s.s ranking exam\u2026 Qi Yue, it is time for us to properly write off these debts!\"...Great Zhou royal palace.Zhou Qing and Qin Yu rushed over the moment Zhou Yuan arrived at the royal palace.Qin Yu quickly walked forward the moment she saw Zhou Yuan, grabbing his shoulders as she said in a tender voice, \"My child, you did not return for so long after you left, look at how thin you've become.\"The current Zhou Yuan had actually become leaner, but to Qin Yu, training in the mountain forests was purely suffering.Zhou Yuan smiled as he hugged Qin Yu. After some consoling, he let Yaoyao accompany Qin Yu as he walked away with Zhou Qing.\"Unblocked your fifth meridian channel?\" Zhou Qing grinned as he glanced at Zhou Yuan.Zhou Yuan nodded.\"Lu Tieshan has told me what happened. I did not expect Qi Yue would be so bold and actually target you.\" A cold look flitted across Zhou Qing's face.Looks like the past few years of tolerating Qi Manor's actions had now made them fearless. However, he did have his difficulties. After all, if he fully fall out with Qi Manor, the Great Zhou Empire would definitely have to welcome a war that would hurt them to the very core. This would be extremely detrimental to Great Zhou.Hence, he somewhat blamed himself for the attack on Zhou Yuan. If he was not such a useless father, Zhou Yuan would not have fallen into such danger.Zhou Yuan knew how his father suffered in silence. With a smile, he fished out the Auraflare technique jade scroll form his clothes and said, \"Don't dwell on it too much father, I was not the one who suffered a loss this time.\"\"Auraflare technique? It has indeed landed in your hands!\" Zhou Qing was a little taken aback but soon burst out into laughter. He was naturally aware how Qi Manor had practically turned the place upside down in search of this very technique.\"Let them pay a little interest first. As for Qi Yue, father need not worry. I will properly resolve the debts between us in the cla.s.s ranking exam three days from now.\"Although Zhou Yuan's expression was calm, the confidence in his voice made Zhou Qing feel rather gratified as he nodded. Two months of training in the deep mountain forests had slightly unsheathed the blade that was Zhou Yuan.Zhou Qing slowly said, \"The upcoming cla.s.s ranking exam is extremely important. If the A cla.s.s is defeated by the B cla.s.s again, the headmaster position might fall into Qi Manor's hands. All their years of plotting have c.u.mulated into this very day.\"Zhou Yuan nodded. He clearly understood the importance of the upcoming cla.s.s ranking exam. It might seem to be a contest between the two cla.s.ses, but the truth was that it would affect both the Great Zhou royal clan and Qi Manor.The him of the past was unable to find his meridian channels and naturally could not be of much aid with regards to this matter. But since he had now opened five channels, Qi Manor would have to first ask his permission if they intended on taking over the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute.Zhou Yuan took in a deep breath as his eyes narrowed. All his months of bitter training were for this very day!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46 Beginning of the Class Ranking ExamPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThree days pa.s.sed in the blink of an eye.When the third day arrived, faint undercurrents began to stir a little in Great Zhou City as numerous factions turned their gazes towards the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute in unison.They knew that today was the cla.s.s ranking exam.Of course, a mere cla.s.s ranking exam was naturally incapable of drawing the attention of so many factions. It was because this cla.s.s ranking exam concerned the struggle between the royal clan and Qi Manor.Everyone knew that Qi Manor had been eyeing the inst.i.tute for many years and had used all sorts of methods to infiltrate it. It was now time for them to reap their harvest. As long as the B cla.s.s was able to take the number one spot in the cla.s.s ranking exam this year, Qi Manor's representative, Xu Hong, would likely replace Chu Tianyang and become the new headmaster of the inst.i.tute.If so, the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute would secretly become the Great Qi Inst.i.tute.This would be a huge blow to the royal clan because it also meant that Qi Manor was gradually gaining the upper hand in the struggle between the two parties, a fact that would undoubtedly sway the stances of the other factions towards Qi Manor, hence furthering the royal clan's decline.Thus, the outcome of this cla.s.s ranking exam could be said to even shake the royal clan's position and its importance was self-evident.\u2026Great Zhou Inst.i.tute, A cla.s.s courtyard.When Zhou Yuan once again stepped into the A cla.s.s courtyard, he immediately felt the many students within look over before being stupefied by the subsequent orderly applause.Zhou Yuan asked in bewilderment, \"What are you guys doing?\"Su Youwei, Song Qiushui and Yang Zai were all smiles as they approached. \"Are we not thanking you? If it weren't for you winning an additional two hours of Jade Spirit Waterfall training time from the B cla.s.s, our A cla.s.s would have no hope for this cla.s.s ranking exam.\"Zhou could not help but smile when he heard this. \"Looks like you guys have grown substantially stronger over the past two months.\"Su Youwei's little mouth was pursed as she let out a soft laugh. \"The three of us have already unblocked our sixth meridian channel.\"Yang Zai also chuckled as he said, \"It's all thanks to the additional Jade Spirit Waterfall training time. Or else, we would likely need another month to unblock our sixth channel.\"Zhou Yuan was somewhat amazed. Looks like the two additional hours of Jade Spirit Waterfall training time had done a rather huge service to them.Zhou Yuan asked with interest, \"What about the B cla.s.s? With only an hour of Jade Spirit Waterfall training time left, they should not have made much progress, right?\"Song Qiushui pondered a little before she replied, \"The morale of the B cla.s.s has been rather low recently and they seem to hold some resentment towards Qi Yue.\"After all, three quarters of their B cla.s.s' originally four hour long Jade Spirit Waterfall training time had been lost by Qi Yue. Who could tolerate such a huge drop? Even if they did not dare to say anything due to Qi Yue's status, some resentment could not be avoided.\"All of you will be gravely mistaken to believe that the B cla.s.s' strength has fallen just because they lost those three hours.\" A voice was suddenly heard while they were talking.Zhou Yuan's looked over and saw a solemn-face Chu Tianyang walking over with his hands behind his back.Everyone greeted one after another. \"Cla.s.s master!\"Chu Tianyang waved his hand and glanced at Zhou Yuan as he slowly said, \"As far as I know, Qi Yue has secretly brought several B students to Qi Manor over the past two months.\"\"Oh?\" Zhou Yuan's eyes narrowed when he heard this. \"He plans to do all he can to groom them with Qi Manor's resources?\"Chu Tianyang's expression was ugly as he nodded. Qi Yue's actions were nauseating but there was nothing the former could say. After all, outsiders did not have any right to comment on how others were training.Qi Manor had abundant resources and it was a very simple task for them to groom another handful of people.However, this also made the other B cla.s.s students feel rather unhappy and unfairly treated. Thus, there had been a lot of complaints recently from the B cla.s.s about Qi Yue, complaints that ended up forcibly suppressed by Xu Hong.Chu Tianyang said in a stern voice, \"So don't become complacent just because you have unblocked your sixth meridian channel because Qi Yue has already reached seven channels!\"The numerous A cla.s.s students turned silent as worry emerged in their eyes. The pressure Qi Yue gave to the A cla.s.s was really too great. Although Zhou Yuan had defeated Qi Yue in the Jade Spirit Waterfall that one time, it was after all a very limited kind of contest and was nothing like the upcoming cla.s.s ranking exam where one needed to rely on one's own strength.As the crowd worried, several gazes turned towards Zhou Yuan. After all, he was the only person who had been able to 'defeat' Qi Yue in the past year. Hence, they naturally held some expectations for him.Zhou Yuan smiled as he looked at Chu Tianyang and said, \"Relax cla.s.s master, I will deal with Qi Yue.\"Chu Tianyang nodded. However, there was still some worry in his eyes. After all, the cla.s.s ranking exam was nothing like the Jade Spirit Waterfall contest.However, he also understood that he could not allow the A cla.s.s' morale to be affected at such a time. Hence, he waved his hand and said, \"If everyone is ready, follow me to the cla.s.s ranking exam site.\"He turned around the moment his words faded while Zhou Yuan, Su Youwei and the rest of the A cla.s.s students flocked over.\u2026The cla.s.s ranking exam site was the northern district of the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute.An enormous field sprawled across the place. Five tall platforms of varying heights rose on the field, platforms which were also known as the cla.s.s ranking exam stages.At this current moment, the surroundings of the field was already a sea of people. Practically all of the students had gathered here and even quite a number of people from the city had come to watch.Thunderous noises echoed across the field.Zhou Yuan and the rest of the A cla.s.s students arrived at the field. Their gazes turned towards the five tall platforms before ultimately stopping at the tallest one, the platform that represented the leader of the cla.s.ses.Every year, the first amongst the cla.s.ses would place their cla.s.s flag upon it.Currently, a tall flag fluttered on the cla.s.s leader platform. A flag marked by a bold 'B'.\"Our A cla.s.s has lost the cla.s.s leader platform for two years.\" Chu Tianyang sighed softly from the side. This was the shared pain of every A cla.s.s member. The glory that was originally theirs had been monopolized by the B cla.s.s for two years, making their t.i.tle as leader of the cla.s.ses nothing but an empty name.Zhou Yuan pursed his lips as a stern look emerged in his eyes. If the B cla.s.s still wanted to dominate the leader cla.s.s platform this year, they would have to first ask his fists.As the sun hung high in the sky, the crowd surrounding the cla.s.s ranking exam field grew larger and larger.\"His and her majesties have arrived!\"A loud shout suddenly rang out across the area. One could only watch as Zhou Qing, Qin Yu and Yaoyao appeared on the central viewing platform and seated themselves on the highest seats.This cla.s.s ranking exam was so important that even Zhou Qing could not help but personally make a trip over.\"King Qi has arrived!\"Not long after Zhou Qing arrived, another loud shout rang out. One would turn only to see a procession of people rus.h.i.+ng over from another direction under the attention of countless gazes.Zhou Yuan's eyes were fixed at the front of the procession where a middle-aged man in official-looking robes was located. His steps were as majestic as a tiger, his expression cold and stern, while his eyes s.h.i.+ned brightly. An invisible pressure spread, making it such that no one to dared to look directly at this man.\"King Qi, Qi Yuan\u2026\" Zhou Yuan's eyes narrowed as he looked at the man. This person was the biggest tumor of Great Zhou and the secret needle Great Wu had stuck here.King Qi had the strength of the Alpha-Origin stage and was one of the top experts in Great Zhou.Chu Tianyang frostily remarked, \"It seems that today's cla.s.s ranking exam is also very important to king Qi.\"On the central viewing platform, Qi Yuan cupped his fists together towards Zhou Qing but did not offer him the greetings of a subject.Zhou Qing expression did not change as he nodded. The level of hostility between the royal clan and Qi Manor was clear as day.Dong dong!After Zhou Qing and Qi Yuan appeared, the excitement in the air reached its peak as the sound of a gong reverberated across the area.\"The cla.s.s ranking exam begins!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47 StrangePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs the gong reverberated across the area, the excitement surrounding the field instantly soared.Chu Tianyang's figure appeared at the center of the field, Genesis Qi surging around him as his powerful voice rang out by everyone's ears, \"The rules of the cla.s.s ranking exam are the same as usual. Every cla.s.s will send four partic.i.p.ants that are free to challenge each other. Defeating all four members of a cla.s.s will allow your cla.s.s to replace their current position.\"\"Partic.i.p.ants from the respective cla.s.ses, please ascend your respective platforms!\"As Chu Tianyang's loud voice faded, figures immediately shot out from each of the cla.s.ses. Amongst the cheers that filled the sky, the figures landed on the stages, allowing everyone to see them.The partic.i.p.ants from the A cla.s.s had been decided long ago. Zhou Yuan, Su Youwei, Yang Zai and Song Qiushui.\"You guys can do it!\" The numerous A cla.s.s students cheered loudly.Zhou Yuan and the other three exchanged a look and nodded before their figures flew onto the second highest platform. The highest belonged to Qi Yue and the other three B cla.s.s partic.i.p.ants.Qi Yue stood with his hands behind his back while Liu Xi stood beside him. At this very moment, they were looking down from above at Zhou Yuan and the rest on the lower platforms.Iciness overflowed from Qi Yue's eyes as he stared at Zhou Yuan and said in a cold voice, \"This cla.s.s leader stage will still end up with my B cla.s.s this year. I advise all of you to not have any designs on it.\"Zhou Yuan smiled upon hearing this and replied, \"Many thanks for your gift of the Jade Spirit Waterfall training time. I believe that the rich Qi Manor should not mind too much since you can even afford to groom others from your own pockets.\"Qi Yue's face twitched slightly. Losing to Zhou Yuan in the Jade Spirit Waterfall had caused his reputation in the B cla.s.s to become extremely terrible. Moreover, the substantial amount of the good will he had painstakingly cultivated was now gone.Liu Xi sneered as she said, \"Humph, what's there to be happy about. After the cla.s.s ranking exam, you guys will lose your t.i.tle as the A cla.s.s. When that time comes, all of these things will still be ours.\"Su Youwei flatly replied, \"It's a little early to speak of who will win or lose.\"Liu Xi said with disdain, \"Who do you think you are? Do you believe that someone like you has the right to talk to me?\"Su Youwei's eyes lowered slightly. \"Status does not mean anything on this stage. If you lose, your words will merely be a joke.\"Liu Xi's eyelids twitched as she said through gnashed teeth, \"Sharp-tongued commoner girl, if you fall into my hands later, prepare to see just how I will deal with you!\"\"You should also be careful. I too plan to properly settle things between us with regards to what happened previously.\" Cold light also surged in Su Youwei's eyes.\"I'm afraid that you don't have that capability!\"Sparks were already flying between the two parties before the battle began.Zhou Yuan's group sat down on the mats atop the platform as he shot a look at Qi Yue's group with narrowed eyes. Behind Liu Xi were two tall and well-built youths whose bodies were surrounded by faint Genesis Qi undulations.Beside Zhou Yuan, Su Youwei softly said, \"Those two are Cao Ling and Fan Wu, elites of the B cla.s.s. If my guess is correct, both of them should have already unblocked their six meridian channel.\"Zhou Yuan gave a slight nod as he glanced at the duo. He seemed to sense a faint but strange aura from the two.Dong dong!As the partic.i.p.ants from the various cla.s.ses ascended the stages, the sound of the gong grew increasingly frequent until the last hurried yet drawn out 'dong', marking the start of the cla.s.s ranking exam.\"D cla.s.s' Li Tong challenges C cla.s.s' Wu Jian!\"\"E cla.s.s' Chai Yanzhi challenges D cla.s.s' Sun Qing!\"\"\u2026\u2026\"A series of shouts immediately followed the final gong. Figures quickly flew out one by one and landed on the empty stone stages.\"I'll go test the waters.\" On the A cla.s.s side, Yang Zai was the first to stand up. His gaze locked onto Cao Ling on the B cla.s.s side and yelled, \"A cla.s.s' Yang Zai challenges B cla.s.s' Cao Ling.\"The youth called Cao Ling was expressionless as he stood up on the cla.s.s leader platform and leaped onto the stone stage.Yang Zai also flew up to the stone stage and cupped his fists together towards Cao Ling.A referee landed on the stage and looked at the both of them before waving his hand. \"Begin!\"Bang!Two figures immediately shot forward as two low shouts rang out, \"Six channels open!\"Both of them had the strength of six channels and did not intend to hold anything back. Six channels were opened from the beginning, their respective full power blasting out.Strands of Genesis Qi swirled on both of their bodies as punches and kicks whizzed forth, causing even the air to be blasted away, neither party willing to give a single inch.Thump! Thump!The two figures clashed under the attention of countless gazes, fists zipping here and there. Neither showed any mercy and every attack was aimed to hurt, making the fight look exceptionally dangerous.Su Youwei remarked in a low voice while concentrating on the fight, \"They are pretty even.\"Zhou Yuan gave a slight nod of acknowledgement. Both individuals had the strength of six channels, giving neither an advantage over the other. Victory would hinge on who had stronger Genesis techniques and the better battle sense.His gaze turned towards Qi Yue, only to discover a strange look on his face as he watched the two exchange blows. Zhou Yuan immediately frowned, feeling that something was amiss.Rumble!On the stage, Yang Zai's and Cao Ling's battle grew increasingly intense. However, no one had discovered the slight tinge of redness in Cao Ling's eyes and the additional sliver of berserk and heavy feeling in the Genesis Qi that poured out from his body.These changes were most clearly felt by Yang Zai. He suddenly felt much more pressured and there were signs of being suppressed in the subsequent clashes.\"Why is this happening?\" Yang Zai was filled with confusion.\"Get lost!\"Following a brief lapse in Yang Zai's movement, red light surged in Cao Ling's eyes as a roar emerged. He pounced like a tiger that had just been released from its cage and sent the weakened Yang Zai flying with a punch, causing him to vomit a mouthful of fresh blood.*Uproar*A commotion immediately broke out in the field. No one had expected the originally even fight to abruptly end in Yang Zai's defeat.Zhou Yuan's brows were tightly knitted together. In that brief moment earlier, he had faintly felt the Genesis Qi in Cao Ling's body pulse strangely before suddenly becoming more berserk and violent.On the cla.s.s leader platform, Qi Yue grinned as he watched this scene before his gaze turned towards Zhou Yuan, a dark and cold look flitting across the former's eyes.This cla.s.s ranking exam was extremely important to Qi Manor. Thus, he had pulled out all the stops to make sure Zhou Yuan had no chance.\"I'll go next.\" Song Qiushui's stood up with a grave expression.\"Be careful.\" Zhou Yuan gave a slight nod.Upon seeing Song Qiushui rise, Qi Yue looked at Fan Wu and said in an emotionless voice, \"You, go.\"Fan Wu stood up and flew onto the stage while Song Qiushui swiftly followed suit.Both sides did not waste any time with words. Six channels were opened the moment the referee signalled the start. Genesis Qi poured into their bodies as surging power filled their limbs.Two figures shot forth, cracking the stone beneath their feet.Zhou Yuan's eyes were glued to the duo that were exchanging blows on the stage. Like before, the gap between them was not big and the fight was naturally rather even.However\u2026 as time pa.s.sed, Zhou Yuan's pupils suddenly tightened when he once again sensed the Genesis Qi in Fan Wu's body show faint signs of becoming berserk.Boom boom!Fan Wu's attacks became more ferocious, each punch filled with violent Genesis Qi that shattered the air, causing explosion sounds to emerge.Qi Yue indifferently said as he watched. \"It's over.\"YAA!A thunderous howl from Fan Wu shook the ground as a punch containing churning Genesis Qi stirred up a storm and blasted towards Song Qiushui with a momentum that could overturn mountains and the sea.Thump!Although Song Qiushui did all she could to defend, the power of the attack was far too great, causing her to catapult off the stage with a m.u.f.fled thump.An uproar once again swept through the entire field. The A cla.s.s had suffered two consecutive defeats\u2026On the tall platform, Zhou Qing's expression became rather ugly. In contrast, a strange and mysterious smile hung on Qi Yuan's lips.Zhou Yuan stared hard at Fan Wu. Moments later, his eyes seemed to flash as he slowly said, \"I know what trick they used\u2026\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48 NexPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"What do you mean?\" Su Youwei was stunned by Zhou Yuan's words.Zhou Yuan's eyes were a little cold as he looked towards Cao Ling and Fan Wei and said in a flat voice, \"If my guess is correct, they have used the Blood Boiling Rune.\"\"Blood Boiling Rune?\"Zhou Yuan slowly explained, \"It is a grade 1 Genesis Rune which uses Genesis Beast essence blood as an anchor. When drawn on the body, it can burn the essence blood in the body, allowing one's Genesis Qi to become berserk and violent. However, it is very harmful to the user and will cause a loss of essence blood. In serious cases, it may even damage one's meridian channels, making it difficult to progress one's cultivation in future.\"The Blood Boiling Rune was somewhat similar to the Nine Beast Channel Opening Rune. However, the former was not as refined at the latter.The expression in Su Youwei's pretty face changed slightly. \"Such Genesis Runes are forbidden! They wouldn't dare!\"Zhou Yuan's eyes narrowed. \"They've concealed it well, making it extremely difficult to discover. It is likely that no runes can be found on their bodies.\"\"Can't be found? Then how were they drawn?\" Su Youwei was puzzled. She was clearly not as proficient in Genesis Runes as Zhou Yuan.Zhou Yuan slowly explained, \"They probably had the Blood Boiling Rune inscribed on their bodies every day before the cla.s.s ranking exam, allowing some of the rune's power to remain in the body. Hence, the blood within their bodies will gradually start to boil as the battles intensifies. As such, no one will be able to find out.\"\"However, this will cause even greater harm to the users body. I'm afraid that Cao Ling and Fan Wu will likely become cripples in the future.\"Su Youwei could not help but clench her jaw. \"How vicious.\"Coldness flashed in Zhou Yuan's eyes as he said, \"Looks like Qi Manor is very prudent. To think that they would resort to such tactics to ensure that nothing unexpected would happen even with Qi Yue at the helm. It seems that they are very determined on obtaining the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute.\"\"They likely plan on using Fan Wu and Cao Ling to tire you.\" Su Youwei's eyes narrowed a little, a stern look emerging in them as her hand slowly closed into a fist. \"But don't worry, I will not let them succeed!\"She could vaguely sense how important this cla.s.s ranking exam was to Zhou Yuan and intended to do everything in her power to help him. For him, she would sweep away all of the stumbling blocks in his path. At the very least, she needed to ensure Zhou Yuan was at his peak condition when he faced Qi Yue and not allow anyone to tire him out.Zhou Yuan had begun to think of a way to deal with the situation, but it was at this moment that a ball of paper was suddenly thrown over, landing at his side.Zhou Yuan was taken aback. He picked up the ball of paper and slowly unfurled it, only to find three beautifully drawn words: Clear Heart Rune.\"These words\u2026 big sis Yaoyao?\" Zhou Yuan was stunned. Subsequently, he raised his head and looked towards a distant platform where Yaoyao was holding Tuntun as she lazily observed the field. As if sensing his gaze, Yaoyao tilted her head and gave him a small smile.It was obvious that she had also discovered the problem. Her mastery of Genesis Runes was even greater than Zhou Yuan, hence she had very quickly worked out a solution.\"So that's how\u2026\"With this pointer from Yaoyao, Zhou Yuan immediately understood. He grinned as he turned to Su Youwei and said, \"It is not impossible to deal with the Blood Boiling Rune. Give me your hand.\"Su Youwei was a little confused but she still reached out a hand as instructed. He her hand was soft, supple, fair and slender, while her nails were akin to little sh.e.l.ls, neat and cute.Without much thought, Zhou Yuan also reached out and grabbed Su Youwei's small hand.Upon seeing his actions, Su Youwei was a little alarmed as her face flushed red. However, before she could say anything, Zhou Yuan retrieved the Heavenly Yuan Brush from his waist and swiftly started to draw on her palm with a serious expression.He was done pretty soon and continued to hold Su Youwei's hand as he said in a low voice, \"This is a Clear Heart Rune. Although it is only an elementary level rune, it will be very useful in this situation.\"\"Clear Mind Rune?\" Su Youwei was somewhat surprised. She naturally knew of this elementary rune but did not understand how it would be of use against the Blood Boiling RuneZhou Yuan smiled and said in a mysterious manner, \"When they activate the Blood Boiling Rune later, use this hand to attack the top of their head.\"Although she was still somewhat puzzled, Su Youwei obediently nodded. Her clear-water-like eyes subsequently looked towards Zhou Yuan as she said with a red face, \"Are still not going to let go?\"Only then did Zhou Yuan realise that he was still holding a small, soft hand and immediately released his grip. Soon after, he said without a change in expression, \"I was talking about important matters and did not intend to take advantage.\"Su Youwei softly snorted. \"You've become accustomed to it anyways.\"Zhou Yuan felt somewhat embarra.s.sed. Just as he was about to try and explain, he saw Yang Zai and Song Qiushui walk over with shame on their faces.\"Sorry. We lost.\" The two hung their heads in dejection. Zhou Yuan had won two hours of Jade Spirit Waterfall training time for them, but they had still lost in the cla.s.s ranking exam, making them feel that they had let him down.Zhou Yuan did not seem to mind as he smiled and said, \"Don't mind it, it was not your skills that were lacking but our opponents' tactics that were far too devious.\"He lifted his head and looked at the cla.s.s leader platform, only to see Qi Yue look back with a superficial smile. From the curve of his lips, it was as if victory was already a.s.sured.\"Already so happy huh\u2026\"Zhou Yuan withdrew his gaze as an icy smile emerged on his face.At this current moment, countless gazes from the field were looking towards the A cla.s.s. Evidently, the A cla.s.s' two consecutive losses had led many believe that they would once again be suppressed by the B cla.s.s.Several factions were also mumbling to themselves, \"Looks like the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute is really going to fall into Qi Manor's hands.\"Su Youwei stood up under the attention of these gazes. She was wearing black training attire today, consisting of a black s.h.i.+rt and black pants. The clothes outlined her slender figure and the rise and fall of her ample bosom, while the waistband around her waist further enunciated an unreasonable tiny waist. A ponytail hung over her back, emitting a youthful vibe.\"I'm going.\" Su Youwei smiled at Zhou Yuan.\"Go for it.\" Zhou Yuan responded with a nod and smile.Su Youwei looked at Zhou Yuan. As the rays of the sun s.h.i.+ned down on her, it seemed as if she had the attention of the entire world. She gave him a slight smile that was both bright and enchanting and in a voice only the two of them could hear, she said, \"Your highness, when you kicked open a set of doors for me back then, I told myself that I would do my best to become very strong. I will make sure that all hindrances will not be able to touch you.\"When her final word faded, the young girl had already agilely flew forth with a light push off the ground. She landed on the tall stage as a clear voice sounded, \"A cla.s.s' Su Youwei challenges B cla.s.s' Cao Ling.\"This clear and pleasant voice drew the attention of countless gazes. When they saw the valiant and elegant girl on the stage, they could not help inwardly cheer.The jealousy in Liu Xi's eyes multiplied as she watched Su Youwei draw more and more attention. \"Cao Ling, go teach her a lesson!\"Cao Ling soundlessly stood up and ascended the stage.\"Begin!\"As the referee signalled the start of the match, the Genesis Qi around Cao Ling's body immediately erupted. Six meridian channels were instantly opened as Genesis Qi surged into his limbs.His body shot forth like a panther as deadly fist-winds ripped through the air, turning into countless punches that seemed to envelope Su Youwei.In response to Cao Ling's flurry of attacks, Su Youwei gracefully s.h.i.+fted like a wisp of smoke. Each time an attack was about to land, she would borrow the incoming force to cleverly avoid, causing Cao Ling's attacks to be unable to connect.Thus, Cao Ling frantically attacked on the stone stage while Su Youwei effortlessly dodged in a manner that was neither hurried nor slow.As time pa.s.sed, red light surfaced in Cao Ling's eyes once again, while the Genesis Qi in his body gradually turned violent as his blood boiled.\"Get lost!\"With a stamp, Cao Ling's figure bulleted forward, appearing in front of Su Youwei as a palm was swung horizontally in a ferocious and imposing manner.However, just as his palm-wind whizzed forth, Su Youwei style did a 180, now advancing instead of retreating. A fair hand gently landed on Cao Ling's head as the Genesis Rune on her palm emitted a faint glow.A refres.h.i.+ng aura tunnelled into Cao Ling's head, causing the boiling blood within his body to suddenly turn peaceful.This sudden change also made the berserking Genesis Qi fade and the contrast caused the Genesis Qi in Cao Ling's body to fall into chaos.Swis.h.!.+Su Youwei decisively attacked. Two fingers suffused with jade light ripped through the air and swiftly hit Cao Ling's chest.Urgh!Cao Ling's figure jerked as a mouthful of fresh blood was vomited from his mouth before cras.h.i.+ng to the ground on his back.*Uproar*!The entire field erupted. No one had expected the previously unstoppable Cao Ling to be so easily defeated at Su Youwei's hands.Under countless gazes of shock, Su Youwei's pretty face remained as calm as water. She merely looked towards the cla.s.s leader platform as a flat voice followed.\"Next.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 Battling Liu XiPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Next.\"Su Youwei's clear, flat voice sounded from the stone stage, causing numerous cheers to erupt. After all, Su Youwei's victory was simply beautiful. Cao Ling's attacks had seemed fierce but he had ultimately been led around by the nose all along.Numerous A cla.s.s students burst into cheers, shouting out praise and encouragement for Su Youwei while Chu Tianyang's tense expression seemed to loosen slightly as he nodded. Thankfully, the hopes and expectations he had placed in her had not been for naught.Qi Yue frowned as he listened to the deafening cheers from the field, while Liu Xi angrily clenched her jaw. The one thing she could not bear was to see Su Youwei become the focus of everyone's attention.Liu Xi icily said, \"Fan Wu.\"Fan Wu nodded and his figure leapt onto the stone stage.Fan Wu cupped his fist towards Su Youwei and said, \"Please give me some pointers.\"The judge loudly shouted, \"Begin!\"Bang!Like the previous match, Fan Wu was the first to make a move. Power surged in his legs, shattering rock as his figure ferociously pounced at Su Youwei. His hand took the form of a claw as it viciously slashed at her, \"Ripping Tiger Claw!\"Ch ch!Ear-piercing noises vibrated from the air as his claw-hand slashed downwards.However, no matter how fierce his attacks were, they were unable to even graze Su Youwei's figure. Her figure drifted like a wisp of smoke, every punch hitting nothing but air.\"High grade Genesis technique, Drifting Smoke.\" Zhou Yuan's eyes flashed as he softly praised. This auxiliary Genesis technique was one of the hardest to learn in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute. Who could have imagined it would be mastered by Su Youwei.Drifting Smoke may not be as profound as his Dragon Step, but it did have its own unique characteristic. Its concept was based on borrowing external force to move, the fiercer the opponent's the attacks, the lesser the chance of landing a blow.\"Fan Wu's defeat is unavoidable.\"As Zhou Yuan made this judgement, like Cao Ling from before, the blood in Fan Wu's body began to boil due to the intensifying fight. Redness surged in his eyes and his Genesis Qi gradually grew violent.Su Youwei's eyes flashed as her figure made a sudden turn and shot straight at Fan Wu.Upon seeing this, Fan Wu bellowed and threw a fist, blasting away the air in front of him as ferocious power pounced at Su Youwei.However, a split second before impact, Su Youwei ingeniously gave a light tap to the incoming blow with her foot and her body flew above Fan Wu.At the same time, a palm was sent downwards, striking the top of Fan Wu's head.Yet another strand of refres.h.i.+ng energy poured into Fan Wu's body, calming the boiling blood within. Genesis Qi immediately started to throb and without any further action from Su Youwei, Fan Wu's fell on his back with a groan, fresh blood flowing from the corner of his mouth.This scene undoubtedly gave rise to cheers that seemingly filled the sky.Liu Xi gnashed her teeth together so hard that cracking sounds could be heard, while fire practically spouted from her eyes.Qi Yue's eyes also darkened slightly as he said, \"She has discovered the Boiling Blood Rune and found a way to counter it.\"Although Qi Yue did not know why, he could sense that Su Youwei had purposely waited for Cao Ling's and Fan Wu's blood to boil before she made her move.\"Su Youwei is indeed a problem.\" Qi Yue's brows were tightly knitted together. The two matches they had painstakingly won had been single handedly reduced back to zero by Su Youwei, thwarting his original plan to tire out Zhou Yuan to ensure that nothing would go wrong.Su Youwei gracefully stood on the stone stage. She calmed the Genesis Qi in her body before a pair of cold eyes turned towards Liu Xi as an emotionless voice rang out, \"A cla.s.s' Su Youwei challenges B cla.s.s' Liu Xi.\"These words immediately caused countless tongue to click. To think that Su Youwei actually planned on fighting three consecutive battles.\"Hehe. good, good. This lowly wench actually dares to challenge me. Truly a fool who does not know her limits!\" Liu Xi was so angered that she burst out into laughter before giving Su Youwei a vicious glare.Liu Xi flew onto the stone platform, her icy gaze fixed onto So Youwei as she said, \"Since you are asking for trouble, I will gladly accommodate!\"Su Youwei replied in a cold voice, \"It's too early to decide exactly who is the one asking for trouble.\"\"Do you really believe that you have the qualifications to challenge me after beating those two useless pieces of trash? When I started training in the inst.i.tute, who knows where you were begging for food!\"Liu Xi continued her mocking, \"Do you really think that you would have the qualifications to enter the inst.i.tute if Zhou Yuan had not picked you up from the dirty streets?\"However, Su Youwei's eyes merely lowered in response to Liu Xi's harsh words as she replied in a calm voice, \"That is the very reason why I will help him sweep away all stumbling blocks like you guys.\"The referee shook his head in response to the atmosphere between the two girls, wasting no more time as he waved his hand, \"Begin!\"Sparks flew as the two girls' gazes met.\"Six channels open!\"Genesis Qi light flowed around the two girls at practically the same time. A split second later, Liu Xi made her move. She appeared in front of Su Youwei in a flash as a hand was sent chopping downwards. Genesis Qi swirled around her finger tips, giving off a faint aura of sharpness.\"Wind Chopper Palm!\"Ch ch!Even the air itself was split apart by this chop. Liu Xi showed no mercy, using a high grade Genesis technique the moment she attacked. Its astonis.h.i.+ng power could cleanly slice even a rock into half.As the daughter of Liu Hou, Liu Xi naturally received a tremendous amount of cultivation resources and the Genesis techniques she had in her a.r.s.enal were not ordinary.Upon seeing Liu Xi's formidable attack, Su Youwei's foot pushed off the ground as she once again displayed the Drifting Smoke technique and retreated like the mist.\"Do you think that I am the same as those two fools?\"\"Wind Spirit Step!\" A smile of disdain emerged on Liu Xi's red lips. Wild winds rose and she appeared in front of the retreating Su Youwei like a gale with a single step as a chop was once again sent hacking downwards.\"Jade-Breaker Finger!\"In response to Liu Xi's dogged pursuit, two of Su Youwei's fingers fiercely thrust forward, flas.h.i.+ng with jade light as they clashed head-on against Liu Xi's falling hand.Clang!The collision was akin to jade smas.h.i.+ng together. The opposing Genesis Qi caused wind to sweep outwards as cracks grew on the stone ground below them.Both Su Youwei and Liu Xi were pushed back a dozen steps. However, it was clear that Liu Xi had taken the upper hand in this clash. After all, her Wind Chopper Palm was a high grade Genesis technique while the Jade-Breaker Finger was only mid grade.\"Let's see how many attacks you can take!\" Liu Xi sneered as she activated Wind Spirit Step again. A gale seemed to scream as her figure headed straight for Su Youwei, while a palm suffused with deadly Genesis Qi hacked apart the air, leaving scars on the ground below.Su Youwei continuously retreated, falling into a disadvantageous position for some time.\"She's being suppressed by the opponent's Genesis techniques\u2026\" Zhou Yuan frowned a little as he watched. Su Youwei was truly talented, but high grade Genesis techniques were already considered top tier in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute, let alone the fact that contribution was needed in order to learn them. She naturally could not match Liu Xi who possessed numerous Genesis techniques that were handed down to her in her clan.Several of the sharper individuals were already able to see the awkward predicament Su Youwei was in, causing them to feel some pity. They could tell that the situation would likely be reversed if Su Youwei knew Genesis techniques of the same level.Ch ch!Two figures fluttered and dodged like b.u.t.terflies on the stone stage, one attacking one defending.Liu Xi was elated as she watched Su Youwei being continuously suppressed by herself and sneered, \"Humph, so what if you're talented? In my eyes, you are merely a lowly dirt-poor wench. Challenging me is akin to seeking your own humiliation!\"Su Youwei was silent as she continued to dodge.\"Don't you feel it's unfair? Laughable wench, the gap between us has long since be decided! No matter how much effort you put in, you will never be able to surpa.s.s the difference in status between us!\"The corners of Liu Xi's lips raised to form a thin smile. \"If a mere high grade Genesis technique can already put you into such a miserable state\u2026\"\"Then what about\u2026 a Black tier Genesis technique?\"Cold light blossomed in Liu Xi's eyes. She would shatter all of Su Youwei's self confidence, affecting her future state of mind and leaving a shadow of doubt in her heart. Hence causing her future cultivation journey to be littered with obstructions.This was nothing but vicious.Liu Xi figure came to abrupt halt. One could only watch as her fingers curled while streams of Genesis Qi converged towards her hand, frantically gathering at the center of her palm, ultimately culminating into a blade of wind.The wind blade vibrated with a piercing sound as the air around it was continously blasted away.\"Low grade Black tier Genesis technique, Green Wind Blade!\"Cruelness flashed across Liu Xi's eyes as she suddenly hacked at Su Youwei. The wind blade whizzed forth with a swish, slicing through the air as it shot straight towards her.The entire place exploded when they saw this, and even the referee prepared to interfere to save Su Youwei.However, not even the slightest change could be seen in Su Youwei's bright eyes as she stared at the green wind blade. Its sharp aura caused her to feel a piercing pain on her skin even from a distance away.But she still did not move to avoid it.Su Youwei's lips parted slightly as she looked at the overjoyed Liu Xi and said, \"It is true that I do not have many high level Genesis techniques like you. However, I do not agree with your words. The gap between us is not insurmountable as you say.\"\"How can someone like you possibly imagine my efforts?\"Su Youwei's hand slowly closed as powerful Genesis Qi suddenly erupted from within her body, causing her clothes to flutter and her hair to fly.\"Seventh channel open!\"The entire field went crazy when Su Youwei's shout rang out as countless individuals cast their shocked gazes over.Not even in their wildest dreams would anyone have imagined that Su Youwei would forcibly open her seventh meridian channel in battle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50 BreathtakingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Seventh channel open!\"A clear shout resounded across the area as Genesis Qi surged towards Su Youwei. Meanwhile, a powerful aura exploded from within her body.Su Youwei's black hair seemed to dance in the wind as Genesis Qi light shuttled through her body. The light finally converged at her two fingers, making her fingertips sparkle prettily like jade while flickering with deadly power, vibrating the air around it.\"Jade-Breaker Finger!\" Su Youwei gazed at the green wind blade that was shooting towards her. The green light was so sharp that it could split the ground but there was no fear on her face. Instead, she gracefully stepped forward as her two jade-like fingers powerfully stabbed at the wind blade.Clang!Two forces crashed into each other as the sound of metal striking metal rang out. However, everyone saw the green wind blade begin to tremble violently at this moment before bursting apart with a bang, transforming into specks of green light.Though Liu Xi had ultimately managed to display this low grade Black Genesis technique, she had just barely been able to pull it off. Hence, Su Youwei was able to use the abundant Genesis Qi of seven channels to forcibly disperse the former's attack.This scene caused Liu Xi's face to warp as she shrieked in disbelief, \"Impossible!\"She refused to believe that her Black Genesis technique had been scattered by Su Youwei's mid grade Genesis technique.Swis.h.!.+However, Su Youwei did not give Liu Xi any time to be stunned and instantly rushed towards the latter. In response, Liu Xi hastily used Wind Spirit Step to retreat.Previously, she had been able to use Wind Spirit Step to match Su Youwei's speed, but the latter was now on a whole new level after opening her seventh channel. Thus, it only took Su Youwei several breaths to close in on Liu Xi.Liu Xi's expression changed when she saw Su Youwei rapidly near with an icy face and shouted, \"Lowly wench, you dare to hurt me?!\"In response to Liu Xi's question, Su Youwei's jade fingers darted forward like lightning, tearing through the air before landing on Liu Xi's shoulder. Fresh blood immediately spurted out as Liu Xi's body was sent flying with a miserable shriek. She crashed into the ground, smearing a long scar on it before coming to a stop.Su Youwei slowly walked forward and arrived at the now miserable figure of her defeated opponent. The former's face was frosty as she lowered her gaze, the iciness flickering in her eyes inducing a s.h.i.+ver from Liu Xi.Su Youwei stared at Liu Xi and said in an indifferent voice, \"It is true that I am not from a powerful clan like you, but I will use all of my talent and effort to make up for every bit of this disparity. Thus, you are not that amazing in my eyes.\"Liu Xi tightly clenched her teeth.\"Besides this, there is something I've wanted to say to you for a long time.\"The corners of Su Youwei's tiny mouth lifted in a disdainful manner as she softly said, \"You once said that his highness is a toad, but I've always wanted to tell you that compared to him, you are the true toad at the bottom of the well!\"\"Because the self-important you can't even match up to a girl he picked up from the streets.\"Liu Xi almost went crazy with anger. Never in her wildest dreams would she have imagined that she would be called a toad and be unable to refute. Not only had she lost, her defeat at Su Youwei's hands had been really pathetic.It was really too much to bear for her and her eyes rolled, showing whites, as she fainted.The approaching referee let out a bitter laugh when he saw this before his strong voice sounded, \"A cla.s.s, Su Youwei's victory!\"*Uproar*!The entire field exploded and countless cries were heard as stunned gazes shot towards the valiant yet elegant girl standing on the stone stage.No one had expected that she would actually be able to reverse the situation and defeat Liu Xi who knew so many high tier Genesis techniques.Every member of the A cla.s.s stood up and clapped as they cheered. The gazes that looked towards Su Youwei were filled with even more adoration than before. Such a girl! She did not have an amazing family background, but she was as tenacious as a swaying hibiscus in a storm, unafraid of the wind and rain as it fearlessly blossomed.\"This young lady is not bad at all.\" On the central viewing platform, Zhou Qing could not help but praise her. He could naturally tell that Su Youwei had forcibly opened her channel earlier, an extremely risky move in a fight. However, that valour and decisiveness really made one raise one's eyebrows.He lamented as he thought how given Su Youwei's talent and character, she would have likely long become a pride of the heavens if she had been born in a good clan, making countless geniuses bow to her.The cheers that flooded the field had not ended.Su Youwei paid no attention to those cheers as her gaze swept towards Zhou Yuan, only to see the latter giving her a thumbs-up. Her lips curled slightly as a certain resolution surfaced in her eyes.Under the attention of countless gazes, she turned her head and look straight at Qi Yue as her clear voice sounded, \"A cla.s.s' Su Youwei challenges B cla.s.s' Qi Yue!\"Silence!The cheers that filled the sky came to an abrupt halt, everyone stupefied as they watched. They clearly never imagined that Su Youwei would continue on to challenge Qi Yue!Zhou Yuan was likewise stunned by Su Youwei's action and immediately muttered under his breath, \"This girl is too reckless!\"By his side, Yang Zai and Song Qiushui also looked at each other but did not know what to say.On the cla.s.s leader platform, Qi Yue's expression looked rather dark. He stared at Su Youwei and stood up as he said in a flat voice, \"You are not my match. Excuse yourself from the stage.\"\"We'll only know once we try.\" Su Youwei did not budge, cold light emerging in her eyes as she stared at Qi Yue. Since you planned on tiring out Zhou Yuan, I will do the same to you. Even If I cannot beat you, I can exhaust some of your energy.She knew that this cla.s.s ranking exam was very important to Zhou Yuan and intended to do all she could to increase their chances.Qi Yue's expression was stormy. He naturally understood Su Youwei's intentions and could not help but feel somewhat angered. The tactic that he had originally planned to use on Zhou Yuan was now being used by Su Youwei on himself.Qi Yue frostily said, \"Stubborn girl, you're too reckless!\"Soon after, the tip of his foot pushed off the ground as his figure flew onto the stone stage.\"I will show you the true power of seven channels!\"With a stomp, Genesis Qi poured into his body. Light swirled around him as the stone floor beneath his feet was shattered. An astonis.h.i.+ng aura pulsed, an aura even stronger than Su Youwei's.After all, Qi Yue had opened his seventh channel quite some time ago, while Su Youwei had only just made her breakthrough. The gap between the two was naturally not small.\"If you can receive a single punch of mine, we'll take it as your victory!\" Qi Yue proudly sneered. A split second later, he had already lunged forward, his five fingers tightly clenching into a fist as the Genesis Qi within his body surged like a wave, gus.h.i.+ng through his channels and into his fist. His fist immediately lighted up as if an explosive power was contained within.\"Low grade Black Genesis technique, Galloping Thunder Fist!\"A punch was thrown with an icy cry from Qi Yue. Rumbling thunder immediately emerged as a fist-shaped-seal whizzed forth, like a bolt of lightning as it ferociously blasted towards Su Youwei.Qi Yue had begun the fight with a Black tier Genesis technique, evidently planning to finish the fight in a flash and regain all of the face their B cla.s.s had lost earlier.Su Youwei's pretty face turned extremely grave at this moment as all the Genesis Qi in her body began to circulate. She observed the rapidly approaching glowing Genesis fist-seal, and in the next instant, her body swiftly retreated.From the momentum of the punch, she knew that she could not receive it head-on. Hence, she immediately changed her strategy, intending to use footwork to gain a little more time.\"Can you escape?\" Qi Yue merely let out a cold chuckle when he saw this. His eyes flashed and the speed of the fist-seal suddenly rose. Like a thunderbolt, it appeared in front of Su Youwei in a flash and slammed into her.Bang!The air seemed to explode at this moment while cracks grew on the stone stage.All Su Youwei could feel was an unstoppable domineering power surge at her. Her body was flung backwards, blood appearing at the corner of her mouth as she let out a groan.Sighs of pity could be heard. Qi Yue was truly the overlord of the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute. Su Youwei was unable to compete even after opening her seventh channel.As Su Youwei's figure was thrown off the stage, another figure rose into the air, reaching out his arms and catching the girl before gently landing.Su Youwei gazed at the familiar face that had appeared before her eyes. She chuckled softly and said in a slightly embarra.s.sed manner, \"I couldn't beat him. Looks like I tried to show off too much.\"The one who had caught Su Youwei was naturally Zhou Yuan. Murder flashed in his eyes when he looked at the glaring red at the corner of Su Youwei's mouth as he replied in a gentle voice, \"You've already done some pretty amazing things so just leave everything else to me. Don't worry, we will not lose.\"There was no longer any strength left in Su Youwei's body, so she lay in Zhou Yuan's arms with slightly narrowed eyes like a languid cat. The valiance from before was now nowhere to be seen.Zhou Yuan landed and handed the feeble Su Youwei to Song Qiushui. Only then did he raise his head as his blade-like gaze shot towards the proudly standing Qi Yue.With a stomp of his foot, his figure soared into the air under countless watching eyes and landed on the stage like a great Peng.At the same time, Zhou Yuan's chilling voice rang out.\"A cla.s.s' Zhou Yuan challenges B cla.s.s' Qi Yue.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51 Zhou Yuan VS Qi YuePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe entire field reached its boiling point the instant Zhou Yuan stepped onto the stage. Practically every gaze converged on the stage, making it the center of attention.\"Isn't that prince Zhou Yuan? Wasn't it rumoured that he was unable to cultivate?\"\"That's old news. Prince Zhou Yuan has already opened his channels in the newcomer exam. I've heard that he has already reached five channels.\"\"Five channels? How can he possibly compete with Qi Yue? Didn't we just see even the seven channel Su Youwei lose?\"\"Looks like Qi Manor has this this cla.s.s ranking exam in the bag.\"\"\u2026\u2026\"Whispers filled the air. Based on their exterior strength, it was clear that the majority felt that victory was already in Qi Yue's gasp. After all, he had always been the strongest existence in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute for the past two years.On the central viewing platform, both Zhou Qing's and Qi Yuan's backs were straight, while their burning gazes were glued to the stone stage. They clearly understood that the battle between Zhou Yuan and Qi Yue would decide who the inst.i.tute would ultimately belong to.Qi Yue stood with his hands behind his back on the stone stage that was now the focus of everyone's attention. His white clothes fluttered in the wind, painting a picture of dignity, as his indifferent eyes looked towards Zhou Yuan. \"Your highness has truly surprised me by coming all the way here.\"One must know that a year ago, Zhou Yuan had merely been a crippled prince that was unable to cultivate in Qi Yue's eyes. A crippled prince that would not draw even a shred of seriousness. Yet, in a short period of half a year, it was as if Zhou Yuan had suddenly awakened, leaping from a state where he was unable to cultivate to five open channels today.Such progress secretly amazed even Qi Yue.\"However, this is as far as you will go.\" Qi Yue's voice was emotionless, as if Zhou Yuan's fate was already in his hands to do as he pleased.Qi Yue had tried all kinds of methods in order to cripple Zhou Yuan, but none of them had succeeded, causing him to lose his patience. This cla.s.s ranking exam was his best opportunity. Zhou Qing would not be able to do anything even if Zhou Yuan was crippled here.\"That may not be so.\" Zhou Yuan's face was akin to rippleless well, but killing intent surged in the depths of his eyes.Qi Yue's past actions had similarly long touched Zhou Yuan's bottom line, rousing his killing intent. Thus, he likewise intended to return everything Qi Yue had thrown at him during this cla.s.s ranking exam.On the stone stage, sparks and killing intent appeared when their gazes met.Every gaze on the field had converged on the stage, and there was no longer anyone who was paying attention to any of the matches between the other cla.s.ses. Everyone knew that the match between Zhou Yuan and Qi Yue would cause violent ripples in the Great Zhou Empire.\"Begin!\"The silence on the stage was abruptly broken by the sudden shout of the referee.Qi Yue was the first to move. Power poured into his legs as he stomped on the ground, his body transforming into a black blur as it rushed towards Zhou Yuan.Boom!A punch was thrown, fist-winds blasting apart the air like a sonic boom.The punch rapidly grew in Zhou Yuan's eyes as his feet suddenly slanted at an angle, causing his figure to blur momentarily. It was the activation of Dragon Step.The incoming punch only hit empty air, causing a tiny glimmer to appear in Qi Yue's eyes. He was long aware of Zhou Yuan's miraculous auxiliary Genesis technique that would turn his figure blurry and enable him to avoid numerous attacks.Qi Yue's fist immediately transformed into a palm, Genesis Qi surging as it swept out like a blade, ripping through the air.Zhou Yuan's five fingers clenched into a fist as a punch containing similar power collided against the palm-blade that was slas.h.i.+ng at this throat.Bang!Fist met palm as the air exploded. Ripples that could be seen with the naked eye pulsed outwards, blowing up the dust on the ground.Bang bang bang!In the next instant, Zhou Yuan and Qi Yue simultaneously let loose a flurry of attacks. Punches seemed to be followed by after-images as they ferociously rained upon the opponent like a storm.In a short span of a dozen breaths, the two had clashed over a dozen times, making the onlookers a little giddy.Dong!After yet another head-on clash, Zhou Yuan's and Qi Yue's bodies jerked backwards, their feet sliding over a dozen steps on the ground before stopping.A faint disturbance could be observed in the crowd, while the eyes of numerous onlookers held some surprise. They had discovered that the merely five channel Zhou Yuan had not fallen into much of a disadvantageous position in the violent clash.Originally, they had believed that Zhou Yuan would be completely suppressed by Qi Yue.Zhou Yuan ma.s.saged his fist as he remarked, \"Seven channels is indeed formidable, much harder to deal with than those wild beasts.\"He had killed several beasts comparable to human seven channel experts, but none of them were as tough as Qi Yue.Qi Yue had a somewhat grim look in his eyes. Although he had long known about Zhou Yuan's unusually strong body, it was only after experiencing it first hand did he truly realise exactly how powerful it was.One must know that he had the strength of seven channels and the quality of his body had risen time and time again. Yet, he could do nothing against a mere five channel Zhou Yuan, a fact that made him rather sullen indeed.\"Seven channels open!\"Following a roar from Qi Yue, Genesis Qi whizzed over and poured into his body. Light immediately emerged on the surface of his body as an astonis.h.i.+ng aura exploded.Crack!The stone floor under Qi Yue's feet steathily shattered, an indication of just how much power was gathered in Qi Yue's body.Zhou Yuan's eyes narrowed slightly as his expression became a little more serious. As the saying went, a lion should use all its power even to catch a rabbit. Let alone the fact that this Qi Yue was no harmless rabbit.\"Five channels open!\" Genesis Qi also surge into Zhou Yuan's body as power flowed in his limbs.Swis.h.!.+Qi Yue's body moved. His speed was several times faster now that he had opened seven channels. In a flash, he had already appeared behind Zhou Yuan.\"Galloping Thunder Fist!\"Qi Yue did not hold anything back, his gaze icy as a Black tier Genesis technique was released. The air immediately exploded as cracks grew inch by inch from under his feet, a rather spectacular sight indeed.This punch was even stronger than the one used against Su Youwei previously.\"Dragon Tablet Hand, shatter the mountain!\"Zhou Yuan's hand swept out in a horizontal arc, incomparably heavy as if he was carrying a mountain. The overwhelming force slammed into the incoming punch from behind.Dong!Shockwaves swept out from under the two's feet, ripping apart the solid ground below.\"You blocked it?! Try blocking again then!\"Ferociousness flashed in Qi Yue's eyes as he pounced like a cheetah. Fist, leg, elbow. Each had turned into deadly weapons, blasting apart the air as they maniacally rained down on Zhou Yuan's vital spots.Qi Yue had already pushed his power to its limits. He needed to obtain dominance and destroy Zhou Yuan's confidence.The sight of such a torrential flurry of attacks made the scalps of countless onlookers turn numb.Zhou Yuan's expression changed slightly in response to Qi Yue's berserk offensive. It was as if his entire view had been filled to the brim with his opponent's attacks and even using Dragon Step would not allow him to avoid them.Although Zhou Yuan was alarmed, he did not panic. His Spirit flickered between his brows as his senses stretched forth, causing the attacks that flooded his vision to instantly change appearance.With his Spirit senses, the trajectories of every single one of Qi Yue's attacks were now extremely clear in Zhou Yuan's eyes.Thus, he boldly made his move.Genesis Qi rapidly swirled on his fists and legs. His counter-attack was not as chaotic as Qi Yue's and instead appeared rather slow, but it was these seemingly slow attacks that were accurately able to land on the weakest points of Qi Yue's flood of attacks. All it took was a gently tap to dispel all of the latter's ferocious power.Like how a long enough lever would be able to lift the earth.Qi Yue's expression grew increasingly ugly. He could feel that his ferocious attacks were ultimately unable to break Zhou Yuan's defence. The latter's seemingly slow counter-attacks were able to accurately disperse his power.Dong!Another heavy punch was thrown by Zhou Yuan, landing on Qi Yue's elbow. The powerful force jerked Qi Yue's entire arm, causing his body to freeze momentarily.\"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. Eat this!\"Zhou Yuan's eyes flashed as his fist suddenly turned into a palm. The Genesis Qi in his body surged out, flowing along his channels before pouring into his palm, causing the surrounding air to vibrate.An astonis.h.i.+ng aura rippled from Zhou Yuan's body.\"Dragon Tablet Hand, split the earth!\"In accompaniment to his shout, Zhou Yuan's palm swung out horizontally. Dazzling Genesis light emerged at the center of his palm, boiling even the air itself as it flew past.This strike was directly aimed at Qi Yue.Qi Yue's expression abruptly changed at this moment. It was clear that he had sensed the shocking power within this counter-attack from Zhou Yuan. The former immediately crossed his arms before him as Genesis Qi light flowed on them.\"High grade Genesis technique, Metal Arm!\"Dong!Zhou Yuan paid not heed to Qi Yue's actions as his ferocious without equal attack slammed into Qi Yue's arms. A loud boom was heard as an overwhelming force erupted.Dong dong dong!Qi Yue's arms shook violently due to the heavy blow, his feet leaving many footprints on the stone ground as he miserably shot backwards in retreat.An uproar shook the entire field, every wave stronger for each step Qi Yue took backwards.Bang!Qi Yue was finally able to forcibly stabilized his body. As he listened to the noise from the crowd, his face turned so stormy that it was as if rain was going to fall from it at any moment. Fury flooded his eyes as he looked towards Zhou Yuan while a shout br.i.m.m.i.n.g with murder rang out from between the crevices of his teeth.\"Zhou Yuan, you are courting death!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Veins crawled up in his eyes, making him appear exceptionally sinister.He had originally believed that it would be an easy fight for him. After all, his seven channel strength was enough to crush any student of the inst.i.tute.Yet, who could have that he would not only be unable to achieve a clean victory against a mere five channel Zhou Yuan, but to even be pushed this far.To Qi Yue, this outcome was undoubtedly akin to losing all face.\"Exactly who is courting death has not been decided!\" Zhou Yuan's voice was calm, but murder also blossomed in his eyes.Qi Yue's bloodshot eyes glared at Zhou Yuan. A brief moment later, the twisted expression on his face slowly disappeared, replaced by calmness. However, his voice grew increasingly eerie as he said, \"Zhou Yuan, I have to admit that you coming this far has already surpa.s.sed my expectations.\"\"However, do you believe that this will be enough to beat me?\"Upon seeing Qi Yue's eerie expression, Zhou Yuan's eyes narrowed slightly as his expression became a little more serious. He knew that Qi Yue had definitely made certain preparations for this cla.s.s ranking exam.Qi Yue deeply breathed in as a ruthless look flitted across his eyes. In the next instant, his body violently shook as a howl rang out.\"Channel Breaker Art!\"Buzz!One could only watch as Genesis Qi suddenly surged over from the surroundings and poured into Qi Yue's body. Everyone quickly sensed Qi Yue's aura begin to climb.Zhou Yuan's expression finally changed at this moment as he slowly said, \"To think that you would use the Channel Breaker Art. That's some real determination indeed.\"This Channel Breaker Art was a type of Gensis technique that could temporarily force open another meridian channel. Since Qi Yue was already a seven channel pract.i.tioner, breaking open one more channel would allow him to reach the eight channel state.However, the technique would harm one's body and greatly prolong the time it subsequently took to open the eighth channel.Genesis Qi light swirled around Qi Yue's body as his clothes flapped. His five fingers clenched into a fist, releasing cracking noises as he felt the overwhelming power in his body.\"For the sake of obtaining the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute, this small price is really nothing.\" Qi Yue's tone was apathetic as he continued, \"Moreover, Qi Manor has already prepared mystical treasures to aid in my quick recovery.\"\"However, before that, I feel that you will be the one who is going to pay!\"Bang!His body shot forward the moment the final word left his mouth.\"Such speed!\" Zhou Yuan was a little startled. Qi Yue's strength has risen to a whole new level after forcibly opening his eighth channel.\"Dragon Step!\"Zhou Yuan wasted no time as his body stepped out at an angle.Boom.A fist surrounded by swirling Genesis Qi light viciously thrust towards him from behind, brus.h.i.+ng past his chest.However, the moment the attack missed, Qi Yue's fist suddenly transformed into a palm and slapped downwards. Genesis Qi blasted apart the air, the powerful force caused pockets of air to explode, hitting Zhou Yuan in the chest.Thud thud!Zhou Yuan's figure rapidly retreated as he felt waves of pain from his chest. Although he had only been hit by the explosion of air from Qi Yue's previous blow, it had been more than enough to cause damage.It was clear that Qi Yue had grown even more powerful after forcing open his eighth channel.\"Let's see how long you can continue to dodge!\" Cold light was revealed in Qi Yue's eyes as his figure shot forth once again. A flurry of swift attacks enveloped Zhou Yuan in waves.In response to the now extremely formidable Qi Yue, Zhou Yuan could only retreat, retreat and retreat.Zhou Yuan instantly fell into a disadvantageous position.On the field, countless cries were heard due to the sudden change in the situation. Anyone could tell that Qi Yue had gained complete dominance in the fight. If Zhou Yuan did not have anything else up his sleeve, the pace of the match would fall into Qi Yue's control.On the A cla.s.s side, graveness and worry filled the face of every student. Su Youwei's hands were tightly clenched, while her pretty face was somewhat anxious. The current Qi Yue was really too powerful.On the tall viewing platform, Zhou Qing's expression was also grim. In contrast, a pleased smile emerged on Qi Yuan's face.Rumble!Two figures continued their chase across the stone stage. Qi Yue's attacks were relentless, wave after wave of deadliness forcing Zhou Yuan to continuously duck and dodge.However, under Qi Yue's pressure, the amount of s.p.a.ce Zhou Yuan had to dodge grew tinier and tinier.Until a certain point in time when his foot arrived at the edge of the stone stage. It was then that Qi Yue's face filled with a twisted smile as fist-wind suddenly slashed downwards, causing cracks to grow on the ground below.This palm strike was enough to sweep Zhou Yuan off the stage and decide the victor.Hence, cries of alarm rose and fell across the field.\"Time for you to get off the stage. Did you really believe that you could change anything?!\" Qi Yue's evil chuckle rang out at this moment.Palm-winds struck Zhou Yuan in the face as he suddenly lifted his head. Not even a single trace of panic could be seen, instead, there was only a chillingly icy smile.\"I've said it before. Losing yourself to joy is not good at all!\"Boom!A strange sound suddenly emerged from Zhou Yuan's body as the surrounding Genesis Qi flooded towards him, causing his Genesis Qi undulations to soar.Zhou Yuan's change naturally drew the attention of countless people as shouts filled with disbelief sounded one after another, \"Prince Zhou Yuan has also unblocked his sixth meridian channel?!\"\"Did he also use the Channel Breaker Art?\"\"It's not the Channel Breaker Art. The Genesis Qi in prince Zhou Yuan's body is still as vigorous as before and shows no signs of disorder, a sigh of practiced control. Thus, it cannot be the Channel Breaker Art.\"\"This can only be achieved if he has truly unblocked his sixth meridian channel.\"\"Which is to say that prince Zhou Yuan's sixth channel has been unblocked long ago and he was concealing his strength!\"\"Such cunning. To think that he purposely acted weak to give Qi Yue the impression that victory was in his grasp, giving rise to carelessness!\"\"\u2026\u2026\"Countless voices could be heard. Everyone was shocked by Zhou Yuan's sudden explosion of power.\"How is this possible?!\" Qi Yue's pupils also shrank at this moment. He had originally believed that he had forced Zhou Yuan to the end of the rope. Who could have expected the latter to suddenly bare his fangs a split second later?\"Do you really believe that I only unblocked my fifth channel after two months of training in the Black Forest Mountain Range?!\" Zhou Yuan let out a chilling chuckle. He had spent all day and all night fighting Genesis Beasts in the Black Forest Mountain Range, plus he had Yaoyao help him inscribe the Thirty Six Beast Channel Opening Rune. It could be said that he had underwent every kind of suffering. Therefore, it was only natural that he had unblocked his sixth meridian channel five days before leaving the mountains.However, he had concealed this fact all along and only showed the strength of five channels.\"Dragon Tablet Hand, split the earth!\"Zhou Yuan's counter-attack was exceptionally swift and ferocious. His palm swept out horizontally, Genesis Qi surging along as the air continuously exploded in its wake. Its momentum was practically unstoppable.Zhou Yuan's counter-attack made all the airs on Qi Yue's body stand as a feeling of danger washed over him. He had no time to think and could only desperately squeeze out as much Genesis Qi as he could.\"Galloping Thunder Fist!\"In his haste, Qi Yue threw a punch which smashed into Zhou Yuan's palm a split second later.Bang!A m.u.f.fled sound echoed. The stone floor beneath both their feet cracked even further as a shockwave unfurled, sweeping up the shattered stone.As pieces of the floor danced in the air, everyone saw Qi Yue's body jerk back as it was sent sliding backwards on the ground. When he finally came to a stop, a groan was released as blood emerged from the corner of his mouth.In contrast, Zhou Yuan had only been pushed half a step back due to his fierce counter-attack.*Uproar*!The entire field exploded once again as countless people secretly cheered. Zhou Yuan's tactic of displaying weakness to the opponent had undoubtedly achieved pretty good results.\"Pretty good and shrewd battle senses.\" Several of the sharper individuals present nodded to themselves. Although Qi Yue might seem stronger on paper, he was lacking in battle sense when compared to Zhou Yuan.Moreover, Zhou Yuan's fierce attacks were akin to those of a seasoned fighter. Each explosion of power was sure to be effective.On the stone stage, Qi Yue slowly wiped away the blood at the corner of his mouth as his face faintly twitched. In the end, he breathed in deeply, firmly suppressing the violent rage that was about to overwhelm his rationality.Qi Yue frostily remarked, \"I never imagined that you had already opened your sixth meridian channel!\"Zhou Yuan replied with a faint smile, \"Well, I've got to keep something up my sleeve, no?\"If he used all of his trump cards from the beginning, he would not have been able to catch Qi Yue off guard. At the very least, Qi Yue had now been injured due to his carelessness.A pair of cold and dark eyes stared at Zhou Yuan as Qi Yue slowly replied, \"Indeed. You have taught me a valuable lesson.\"He closed his eyes and nodded as he continued in a detached voice, \"That is why in order to thank you, I will use my greatest power to defeat you. I will rip apart every single one of the trump cards you are so proud of and allow you to have a taste of true despair.\"As his voice faded, Qi Yue slowly lifted his hand, allowing everyone to see the faint green glow that had emerged on it. Light fluctuated indeterminately as it gave off an aura of sharpness that changed one's expression.Even the air itself was being ripped to shreds by the green aura.The expression of some of the more knowledgeable experts present changed as voices of shock rang out, \"That is\u2026 one of Qi Manor's top tier Genesis techniques, the Auraflare technique?!\"\"Qi Yue has mastered the Auraflare technique?!\"\"Not good, things are going to get dangerous for prince Zhou Yuan. Although the Auraflare technique is said to be a low grade Black tier Genesis technique, its power surpa.s.ses several mid grade Black tier Genesis techniques!\"\"With this technique, Qi Yue is practically invincible amongst those below the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 I Know This TooPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayGreen light pulsed on Qi Yue's hand, never stretching beyond half a finger in length. As the green light throbbed, even the air itself was sliced apart with 'ch' sounds, making clear its astonis.h.i.+ng destructive power.Only a single glance was needed for everyone to realise the ident.i.ty of the green aura. It was one of the most powerful techniques of Qi Manor, the Auraflare technique.The insanely terrifying power of this technique made it such that ordinary pract.i.tioners would not dare to engage it in a direct clash. Hence, there were very few experts under the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage who could face Qi Yue while he was using this technique with eight open channels.Hence, the situation was reversed once again.Qi Yue's entire body brimmed with killing intent as he stared and Zhou Yuan and said in a chillingly eerie voice, \"Zhou Yuan, I'll admit that you are indeed very capable. I would never have imagined that a cripple from half a year ago would become such a huge threat to me!\"\"The great threat that you pose has made me feel that it would be better to cripple you once more!\" Qi Yue revealed a set of spookily white teeth as he smiled sinisterly.Surprise flitted across Zhou Yuan's eyes as he stared at the throbbing green aura on Qi Yue's palm. The former had clearly not expected Qi Yue to have learnt the Auraflare technique.However, Qi Yue's green aura was extremely faint and seemed rather unstable. It was evident that he had just barely managed to bring out this technique.Even so, the power of the green aura far surpa.s.sed the low grade Black tier Galloping Thunder Fist from earlier.\"It just so happens that you and I have opposite views.\" Zhou Yuan's voice was indifferent as he looked at Qi Yue's twisted face that oozed with killing intent. \"Because I have never seen you as a threat from the very beginning. In my eyes, you are merely a small pebble in my path of cultivation.\"Qi Yue's pupils shrank, his seething rage ultimately releasing itself in the form of laughter. To have a once crippled prince see him as a tiny pebble in the latter's path made him feel humiliation he had never experienced before.\"I truly hope that you will still be able say these words when you are kneeling at my feet later!\"Qi Yue's killing intent had reached its peak. His presence raged like a tiger as the green aura pulsed on his palm. He could not longer restrain the killing intent in his heart. His foot stomped on the ground, shattering the stone floor, as his figure swiftly shot towards Zhou Yuan amidst countless cries of alarm.Qi Yue's palm sliced through the air. The faint green glow around it emitting extremely deadly pulses.Zhou Yuan remained where he stood. In the onlookers' eyes, it seemed as if he had been frightened silly by Qi Yue's ferocity.On the A cla.s.s side, Su Youwei's face paled a little. She was almost about to lose control and dash towards the stage, but firmly suppressed this desire with her rationality.By the side, Chu Tianyang's fists were tightly clenched, a tense expression on his face as he unblinkingly stared at the stage.On the central viewing platform, Zhou Qing's body leaned forward as faint traces of Genesis Qi surged around him. It was obvious that he planned to step in at the final moment to ensure that nothing happened to Zhou Yuan.Below him, Qi Yuan smiled faintly, as if victory was already in his grasp.Under countless gazes of pity, Zhou Yuan stared at Qi Yue as he murmured, \"Is the Auraflare technique really that great?\"He stepped forward, his body suddenly jerking and his back rising as he opened his mouth, \"Dragon Breath!\"Roar!The roar of a dragon echoed faintly as the surrounding Genesis Qi transformed into a stream of white that was swallowed by Zhou Yuan with a single gulp.As he grew more and more proficient with the ninety eight forms of the frolicking dragon, Zhou Yuan now no longer needed to perform all the stances and could vibrate his bones to activate Dragon Breath.The mouthful of rich Genesis Qi that entered his body immediately started to spin at high speeds in his channels as it was compressed.Zhou Yuan raised his head, gazed at Qi Yue's increasingly distorted face and slowly extended his hand. Disbelief flooded everyone's eyes as they watched a green glow emerge from Zhou Yuans palm, a green glow that pulsed as it shredded the air.The green glow was exactly the same hue as the one on Qi Yue's hand, only a little deeper.Most importantly, Zhou Yuan's green glow was a whole inch long, while Qi Yue's was less than half a finger long.Countless cries erupted throughout the entire field.\"Prince Zhou Yuan is also\u2026 using the Auraflare technique?!\"\"How is that possible? Isn't the technique exclusive to Qi Manor? How could prince Zhou Yuan have learnt it?!\"\"Prince Zhou Yuan's aura is deeper and longer! His mastery is clearly even greater than Qi Yue's!\"\"How is this possible\u2026\"Cries of alarm and surprise rose and fell. Everyone was shocked by the scene before their eyes.The eyes of the rapidly approaching Qi Yue also widened at this moment as he stared at the throbbing green light on Zhou Yuan's hand.The corners of Zhou Yuan's mouth lifted when he saw Qi Yue's appearance as he mockingly said, \"Sorry but I also know the Auraflare technique!\"When the final word left his mouth, Zhou Yuan abruptly stepped forward as his hand ruthlessly chopped at the incoming Qi Yue like a green blade.Ch ch!As the palm descended, the air was split apart and cracks emerged on the ground below.Under the attention of countless gazes, Zhou Yuan's and Qi Yue's palms slammed into each other as the two green lights emitting deadly auras clashed.Ch!A very faint sound seemed to echo.Zhou Yuan's and Qi Yue's figures crossed each other, both taking several steps forward before slowly coming to a stop.Their backs faced each other as the green aura on their hands continued to flicker.The entire field had become extremely quiet and every gaze was glued to the two partic.i.p.ants. They knew that the outcome of this battle of the t.i.tans was about to appear.\"How is this possible\u2026\" A low voice broke the silence. Everyone watched as Qi Yue mumbled, \"Why do you know the Auraflare technique? And why is it so powerful?!\"\"I'm afraid that it's all thanks to you.\" Zhou Yuan's voice was emotionless.Qi Yue's pupils shrank as if something suddenly clicked in his head and his face immediately twisted. \"So\u2026 Luo Hao died at your hands!\"No wonder they could not find any traces of Luo Hao no matter how they searched. It turns out that he had long been killed by Zhou Yuan. Moreover, the Auraflare technique had fallen into his hands and had even been secretly learnt by him.Zhou Yuan ignored Qi Yue. With a light swing of the former's sleeve, a blade of wind whizzed forth.The wind blade swept past and countless onlookers on the field gasped as they watched Qi Yue's entire arm slowly fall off, fresh blood spurting out as it dropped onto the ground.The place of the cut was as glossy as a mirror.ARRGH!It was at this very moment that a Qi Yue's miserable shriek rang out.The entire field was dead silent, everyone blankly staring at the miserably shrieking Qi Yue. They knew the outcome of the match had been decided at this very moment.However, this outcome had clearly exceeded everyone's expectations.No one could have imagined that the very same Qi Yue, who had practically reigned supreme over the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute for the past two years, would lose in such a miserable manner at Zhou Yuan's hands today.Gaze after gaze was tinged with amazement as they turned towards the stage where Zhou Yuan stood with his hands hanging at his side. They never imagined that the crippled prince, whom was rumoured to be unable to begin his channel opening cultivation, would unknowingly begin to reveal his potential.The Great Zhou royal clan was perhaps not as in the decline as they had thought.On the tall viewing platform, Zhou Qing and Qi Yuan were similarly shaken by the outcome of the match. However, Zhou Qing was pleasantly surprised, while Qi Yuan's face was green with anger. When he saw Zhou Yuan cut off Qi Yue's arm, he could not longer control the rage in his heart and suddenly stood up as he howled, \"Child, how vicious!\"Boom!A pillar of golden Qi dashed out from the top of his head, transforming into a giant golden hand that grabbed at Zhou Yuan.If this palm landed, it would crush the entire stone stage.Grade 4 Genesis Qi, Primal Gold Qi!However, as the giant gold hand descended, a similarly powerful red Qi also dashed into the sky, transforming into a giant scarlet hand that mercilessly smashed into the gold hand.Grade 4 Genesis Qi, Flame-Thunder Qi!An earth shaking noise reverberated across the area as the land shook and terrifying gales swept outwards, filling the sky with dust.At the same time, Zhou Qing's rage filled voice thundered,\"Qi Yuan, are you planning on rebelling?!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54 TriumphPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRumble!The clash of two Alpha-Origin stage experts could be said to shake the mountains. The entire field began to tremble violently at this moment, the spreading aftershocks making countless people feel as if they were unable to breath.When Zhou Qing's furious shout rang out, a large group of imperial guards flooded out from behind the field. But at the same time, numerous figures reached for their weapons in the field as they gathered towards king Qi.Both factions were on high alert.The suddenly suffocating atmosphere did nothing for the various factions that were secretly in shock. Was the royal clan and Qi Manor really going to war today?Both parties were clearly unprepared. If they were to start a war now, Great Zhou would definitely descend into internal chaos, chaos which would in turn allow a third party the opportunity to reap the benefits.Zhou Qing's expression was frosty as vigorous scarlet red Flame-Thunder Qi continuously shot out from the top of his head. An astonis.h.i.+ng aura accompanied the faint rumble of thunder as the Qi stormed in the sky above.His eyes were ice-cold as he stared at Qi Yuan. Any movement from the latter would definitely provoke a response.Qi Yuan's face twitched faintly under Zhou Qing's hawk-like gaze. Although there was anger and murder surging in the former's eyes, he was after all no ordinary individual. He knew that both sides would suffer terrible losses if they were to clash here, allowing a third party to take advantage.Hence, with a deep breath, the vigorous Genesis Qi that had poured out from his head was sucked back into his body.A smile was revealed on his stormy face as he cupped his fists together towards Zhou Qing and said, \"Your majesty, please quell your anger. I was reckless due my anxiousness and hope that you can forgive me.\"As he spoke, he looked towards Zhou Yuan on the stone stage, \"Your highness, please do not take offense if I scared you earlier.\"At the sight of the smile on Qi Yuan's face, Zhou Yuan could not help but think to himself, \"King Qi is truly a formidable person, knowing when to bow and submit. No wonder he has caused so much trouble for father.\"Zhou Yuan was growing increasingly wary of Qi Yuan, but maintained a smile full of apology as he replied, \"I do not blame you, it is my fault for being unable to restrain myself earlier so I should be the one who apologises.\"The corners of Qi Yuan's eyes twitched as he shot a glance at the screaming Qi Yue, who was grabbing the stump where his arm once was, but could only force a smile, \"Punches and kicks have no eyes and accidents are unavoidable. I can only say that Qi Yue was not as skillful.\"Zhou Yuan seemed to breath a sigh of relief as he happily said, \"Nothing is better than king Qi's understanding.\"\"Hehe.\" Qi Yuan chuckled. There was a twinkle in his eye as he continued, \"Is the technique previously used by your highness our Qi Manor's Auraflare? May I inquire where your highness obtained it?\"Zhou Yuan smiled upon hearing this. \"Someone tried to a.s.sa.s.sinate me some time ago while I was training in the Black Forest Mountain Range, but the attempt was ultimately foiled by myself. I found the technique on his corpse.\"\"So that's what happened.\" It was as if a flash of understanding had struck Qi Yuan. \"Qi Manor was burgled some time ago and it just so happens that this very same Auraflare technique was stolen. I believe that the burglar must have been the one who attacked your highness.\"Qi Yuan's smile became gentle as he continued, \"I should really thank your highness. If not for you, Qi Manor would have truly lost the Auraflare technique.\"Zhou Yuan's eyebrows raised slightly. King Qi was such a wily old fox, but did he really believe that the Auraflare technique would be returned with a few simple words?Thus, Zhou Yuan immediately let out a sigh and said, \"I would naturally return the technique to Qi Manor if I still had it. Unfortunately, it was ripped to pieces in a fight with a Genesis Beast so I had to throw away the remains.\"The smile on Qi Yuan's face turned rigid as his fists involuntarily clenched tightly. Even a three year old would not believe Zhou Yuan's words. It was clear that the latter had no intentions of returning the technique.However, there was nothing Qi Yuan could do unless he wanted to fall out with the royal clan here.Zhou Qing let out an icy chuckle in his heart when he saw this and withdrew his Genesis Qi. Although he too had been greatly angered by Qi Yuan's unbridled actions, the former also knew that this was not the time to go to war with Qi Manor.As the two individuals withdrew their Qi, the tense atmosphere smothering the field gradually dissipated.Although everyone knew that the royal clan and Qi Manor were at loggerheads, the final membrane had not been broken. If it was torn apart here today, no one would be able to avoid the subsequent turmoil that would surely engulf Great Zhou.With a wave of Qi Yuan's hand, two figures flew onto the stage and a.s.sisted the still shrieking Qi Yue off. Only then did the referee return to his senses and shout, \"A cla.s.s, Zhou Yuan's victory!\"\"All the B cla.s.s partic.i.p.ants have been defeated so the A cla.s.s has won their challenge! I now announce that the A cla.s.s is this year's leader of the cla.s.ses!\"As the referee's voice boomed, the numerous A cla.s.s students burst out into cheers, cheers accompanied by thunderous applause from the countless audience members around the field.Gaze after gaze was filled with amazement as they looked towards the thin figure of the youngster atop the stage. No one had expected the once crippled prince to reach such heights.Those that had experienced the events from over a dozen years ago sighed inwardly. To think that even the calamity back then had been unable to completely ruin his highness. This clearly showed how just how tenacious his highness was.However, when all was said and done, Zhou Yuan had after all lost the sacred dragon blessing. Hence, it was hard to determine exactly how far he would be able to go.After all, the sacred dragon blessing that once belonged to him was currently the country blessing of Great Wu. In addition, its power had also been bestowed onto the two born with the python and sparrow blessings that were born on the same day as himself. With just the power of Great Zhou, taking it back would be harder than ascending the heavens.In contrast to the celebratory atmosphere of the A cla.s.s, an oppressive atmosphere covered the completely silent B cla.s.s. Their cla.s.s master, Xu Hong, had a steely-green face of compressed anger akin to a volcano that was on the verge of erupting.A single step was all that separated him from the position of headmaster. He should taken control of the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute after today, but who could have expected such a turn of events.The originally sure-win Qi Yue had lost to Zhou Yuan!It was at this time that the unconscious Liu Xi finally awakened. However, her pretty face immediately turned deathly pale when she heard the referee's announcement.\"Qi Yue lost to Zhou Yuan? How can it be?!\"She blankly stared at the stone stage, only to see Zhou Yuan standing there with his hands behind his back. His tall straight figure and his thin face gave off an aura of sharpness that no one dared to underestimate.\"How is it possible\u2026 how could he have beaten Qi Yue! He's nothing but a crippled prince!\" Liu Xi mumbled to herself, still unable to accept reality.The other cla.s.s B students gloated a little as they watched Liu Xi. Qi Yue had been the only one to be acknowledged by this arrogant girl who acted superior to all of her other B cla.s.s cla.s.smates.You once said that prince Zhou Yuan was a toad that you would never give a second glance. Yet, he has now become so outstanding, so outstanding that even Qi Yue can no longer compare.Looks like Su Youwei was right. Compared to prince Zhou Yuan, Liu Xi was the real toad.On the tall viewing platform, Qi Yuan knew that their plan had already failed. His expression was somewhat dark as he looked towards Zhou Qing and said with a faint smile, \"The outcome of this cla.s.s ranking exam is truly unexpected. Congratulations your majesty.\"Zhou Qing's expression was calm as he replied, \"It's a pity with regards to all the thought and effort king Qi has put into the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute over the years.\"Qi Yuan laughed, \"Qi Manor made a wrong move this time, but your majesty should not be too overjoyed. Qi Manor is still the same Qi Manor even without the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute.\"\"Besides\u2026\"He paused, revealing a slight smile as he glanced at Zhou Yuan. \"My eldest son Qi Hao is said to have gained recognition under the great general. Perhaps your majesty should pay some attention to this.\"Zhou Qing's pupils shrank a little upon hearing these words, but his expression remained unchanged as he replied, \"The great general is no rebel. At the very least, this is something that I still believe in.\"\"Hehe, I hope so. But it seems that he does not intend to repay your majesty's faith.\" Qi Yuan's words seemed to hold a deeper meaning. Without further ado, he smiled and cupped his fists together towards Zhou Qing before turning around to leave.Zhou Qing's eyes grew colder as he watched Qi Yuan leave. The former knew that Qi Manor would not just leave it at this after this failure. Looks like the future clashes between them would only grow more and more ruthless\u2026However, the one thing he knew was that no matter what, he would never allow a repeat of the events from back then!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 Wei CanglanPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Great Zhou Inst.i.tute cla.s.s ranking exam was over. This year's cla.s.s ranking exam however had caused some pretty big ripples in Great Zhou City. The most enthusiastically discussed amongst them was the extraordinary performance of their prince. The prince rumoured to be incapable of beginning channel opening cultivation had used his six channel strength to obtain an overwhelming victory over Qi Yue, whom had relied on the Channel Breaker Art to reach eight channels\u2026The spread of this news caused numerous gasps of surprise. For the very first time, Zhou Yuan had begun to gain some reputation for himself in the Great Zhou Empire without relying on his status as prince.\u2026A long break followed the cla.s.s ranking exam. For Zhou Yuan however, there was no relaxation after victory and his daily training routine continued.It was just as he had said to Qi Yue. In Zhou Yuan's eyes, the latter was not much of a threat at all. Qi Yue had merely been a small pebble on Zhou Yuan's path to growing stronger.After kicking this pebble aside, Zhou Yuan's gaze turned back once again to a more distant goal.A month later.The inner chambers of the royal palace.Zhou Yuan walked into the chambers and looked behind the desk at Zhou Qing, \"Father, you were looking for me?\"Zhou Qing lifted his head with a smile and replied, \"How has your training been recently?\"Zhou Yuan responded, \"Pretty good. I should unblock my seventh meridian channel soon.\"He had diligently training around the clock for the past month and the seventh channel was now in sight.Zhou Qing nodded in gratification. Looks like the cla.s.s ranking exam victory had not made Zhou Yuan lose himself to joy and slack off on his training.Zhou Qing could not help but sigh and say, \"It was really all thanks to you. If not for you, the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute would not have escaped Qi Manor's claws.\" Recalling the cla.s.s ranking exam still caused him to be a little on edge.\"As a subject of Great Zhou, it is only natural for me to do what I can.\" Zhou Yuan smiled.The smile on Zhou Qing's face grew even wider. Soon after, he slowly said, \"We may have been able to stop Qi Manor this time, but they will not give up.\"Cold light was revealed in Zhou Yuan's eyes as he said, \"Father, Qi Manor is a tumor to Great Zhou. To strengthen Great Zhou, this tumor must be destroyed.\"Zhou Qing nodded. \"I naturally desire to eliminate Qi Manor at all times, but they are currently no weaker than the royal clan. If we were to go to war with them, both of us will surely suffer huge losses. Unless\u2026\"\"Unless what?\" Zhou Yuan was a little startled.Zhou Qing continued in a soft voice, \"Unless the great general will firmly stand on our side and help us deal with Qi Manor.\"\"Great general? Wei Canglan?\" Zhou Yuan's heart shook. It was obvious that he had heard of this individual before.Zhou Qing lightly nodded. \"The three strongest factions in the current Great Zhou are us, the royal clan, Qi Manor and the great general's faction.\"\"Great general Wei is also an Alpha-Origin expert and the Canglan army under him is one of the three strongest armies of Great Zhou.\"As for the other two armies, one was the royal clan's imperial guards and the other was Qi Manor's King Qi Guards.\"Father, could great general Wei have thoughts of rebelling?\" Zhou Yuan frowned.Zhou Qing shook his head. \"Back then, great general Wei stood at my side even against Great Wu. He is not the kind of person who would entertain thoughts of rebellion. Truthfully speaking, it is I who let him down.\"At this point, Zhou Qing's expression dimmed somewhat.Zhou Yuan curiously asked, \"What happened?\"Zhou Qing stood up and pointed at a map of Great Zhou hanging on the wall behind him. On the north-west part of the map was an area called Canglan County. Next to the county was a sprawling large black ma.s.s akin to an abyss.Zhou Qing pointed at the black area on the map and asked with a serious expression, \"Do you know of this land?\"\"This is\u2026 Blackwater?\" Zhou Yuan's expression changed a little. Blackwater was well known in Great Zhou as a vile land populated by countless savage Genesis Beasts. No empire was able to occupy this region, allowing many independent pract.i.tioners to gather there, forming numerous factions of varying sizes.These factions would poke at Great Zhou's borders from time to time, plundering and slaughtering. No crime was beyond them.Zhou Qing elaborated in a heavy voice, \"Blackwater's most powerful faction is known as Black Venom City and its lord goes by the t.i.tle Black Venom King. He is a very infamous Alpha-Origin expert.\"\"Back then, the Black Venom King invaded Great Zhou but was stopped by great general Wei. In retaliation, the Black Venom King besieged Canglan County and although he was pushed back in the end, great general Wei was struck by the Black Venom King's secret technique, Devil Miasma Poison.\"\"Although great general Wei was tortured by the poison, he was after all an Alpha-Origin expert and was ultimately able to suppress it. But no one could have expected what happened next. Great general Wei's only son, Wei Bin, was afflicted by the poison at birth. He has been paralyzed and bedridden till this day and is constantly tormented by the poison.\"\"With his only son poisoned, great general Wei was overwhelmed by rage and his hatred for Black Venom King reached all the way to the heavens. From then on, great general Wei has never taken even half a step from Canglan County. He views the Black Venom King as a thorn and is constantly plagued by thoughts of vengeance.\"\"This is why great general Wei has shut himself in Canglan County for the past few years and pays no attention to the affairs of the Great Zhou Empire.\"At this point, Zhou Qing's voice lowered, \"I know that great general Wei still blames me. It was I who asked him delay the Black Venom King back then while I led troops to encircle the latter. Who could have imagined that king Qi would chose such a time to intervene and impede us. By the time I arrived with the troops, great general Wei had already been struck by the Devil Miasma Poison.\"\"That is why I too am somewhat responsible for the plight that had befallen great general Wei's son.\"It was only after listening to Zhou Qing's story that Zhou Yuan finally understood. To think that there was such a tale behind this matter. It was likely that great general Wei held a little grudge against father. In addition to the waning power of the royal clan, there was now enough reason for great general Wei to shut himself away in Canglan County.After all, Wei Canglan would not dare to do such a thing if the royal clan was as powerful as it had been back in the day.As for Wei Bin's misfortune, it was a similar situation to his own. The only difference was that the Dragon's Resentment Poison was many many times worse than the Devil Miasma Poison.Therefore, great general Wei could be said to be a neutral faction. He neither acknowledged Qi Manor nor receive commands from the royal clan. No wonder father said that the side Wei Canglan chose to stand on would obtain absolute superiority.Zhou Qing slowly said, \"According to my sources, Qi Yuan's eldest son, Qi Hao, headed to Canglan County after graduating from the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute and enlisted himself under great general Wei. It is said that he now has somewhat of a reputation in Canglan County. Qi Yuan clearly plans on getting closer to the great general through his son, making it easier for him to tilt great general Wei to their side.\"Zhou Yuan's eyes narrowed. If Wei Canglan chose to help Qi Manor, the royal clan would be at risk of being overthrown.\"But you need not worry too much. great general Wei is someone I understand rather well. There is no chance that he would side with Qi Manor to deal with Great Zhou.\"Zhou Yuan slowly replied, \"But he will not help the royal clan deal with Qi Manor either.\"Zhou Qing stiffened momentarily before nodding with a bitter smile.Zhou Yuan let out a soft sigh. Great Zhou was in a really unstable position, crisis looming at every corner. His victory in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute had merely been akin to pouring a little water onto the blazing fire that was Qi Manor. If this tumor was not removed, there will never be peace for Great Zhou.\"I called you over because I have something to tell you.\" Zhou Qing's expression turned rather serious.Zhou Yuan could not help but ask when he saw Zhou Qing's expression, \"What is it?\"Zhou Qing's gaze turned to the Blackwater region on the map as he slowly said, \"I received information some time ago of some ruins that had been discovered in Blackwater.\"\"Ruins?\" Zhou Yuan was taken aback. Blackwater was an incomparably vast land. The discovery of a few ruins should be rather ordinary.It was as if a fire had been lit in Zhou Qing's eyes at this moment as he elaborated in a soft voice, \"Someone found an unusual plant in the ruins. Red like fire, its absorbs sunlight to grow and its seeds look like fire crystals.\"\"What is it?\" Zhou Yuan was baffled.\"If I am not wrong, it is likely the Fire Spirit Grain, a grade 4 Genesis Food!\"\"Grade 4 Genesis Food?!\" Upon hearing these words, Zhou Yuan's expression finally changed. One must know that even the Mysterious Crystal Rice owned exclusively by their royal clan was only a grade 2 Genesis Food. Even so, it had been extremely beneficial to his channel opening and had even won over many talents to their side.It was really difficult to imagine just how much more amazing a grade 4 Genesis Food would be. Only when Great Zhou was at her peak did they possess a similar grade 4 Genesis Food, the Blood Rain-Dragon Barley.If the royal clan could gain possession of the Fire Spirit Grain, Great Zhou's strength might even rise to the point where she could once again threaten Great Wu.A Genesis Food like this was a true strategic resource of utmost important to any empire.Thus, Zhou Yuan finally understood why Zhou Qing had become so emotional earlier.Zhou Yuan declared, \"This Fire Spirit Grain must land in the hands of the royal clan.\"It was easy to picture how this item would enable Qi Manor's power to swiftly grow in a few years, surpa.s.sing the royal clan.Zhou Qing nodded and shot a glance at Zhou Yuan as he continued, \"Besides the Fire Spirit Grain, it seems that there is also a gem-like tree which bears jade fruits akin to a new born child.\"Zhou Qing stared at Zhou Yuan as he slowly said, \"This fruit is called the Jade-Infant Fruit and can be used to supplement one's lifespan.\"Bang!Zhou Yuan felt as if his head had exploded. His breathing grew heavier while his eyes turned scarlet red. His mother had lost a substantial amount of her lifespan in order to save him and now had less than ten years to live. This had always been a thorn in his heart, and he had many a times mulled over how to extend his mother's lifespan.But mystical items that could prolong one's life span were just too rare, and even using all of the royal clan's resources had not beared any fruit. Zhou Yuan would never have imagined such information would reach his ears today.Zhou Yuan licked his lips, determination filling his eyes as he looked towards Zhou Qing, speaking with a pause between each word, \"We must obtain the Jade-Infant Fruit!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56 Wu HuangPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Of course.\"Zhou Qing nodded strongly. If he had not been such a useless father and husband back then, Zhou Yuan would not have been tortured by the Dragon's Resentment Poison for so many years and Qin Yu would not used so much essence blood to save Zhou Yuan and end up having her lifespan cut.These were things he had blamed himself for for many years.Therefore, now that such hard to come by information about a lifespan supplementing treasure had arrived in his hands, he naturally did not plan on giving up so easily.Zhou Yuan's pounding heart gradually quietened down and he asked in a low voice, \"Father, has this information been verified?\"Zhou Qing replied, \"It is true. Someone unintentionally entered this particular ruins and saw the Fire Spirit Grain and Jade-Infant Fruit. However, there seemed to be a powerful Genesis Beast guarding the ruins so he had no choice but to hastily flee.\"\"If this news has spread, I'm afraid that Qi Manor will know of it too.\" Zhou Yuan frowned. Qi Manor would became a really huge threat if they managed to obtain the Fire Spirit Grain.That was after all a true strategic resource that was indispensable to any faction.With such a resource in hand, grooming one's own forces and recruiting powerful pract.i.tioners would become much more effective.\"Yes.\" Zhou Qing nodded. His expression grew somewhat solemn as he said, \"That is why I plan to send Lu Tieshan.\"Zhou Yuan said, \"Father, let me go too.\" He had already unblocked six channels and would soon reach the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage. Once he stepped into the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage, he would be considered a little powerhouse.In the Great Zhou Empire, Alpha-Origin stage experts stood at the pinnacle. They were followed by Heaven Gate stage experts, while the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage made up the core of the elite forces. In the military, those at the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage were qualified to take on heavy responsibilities.Upon seeing Zhou Yuan volunteer himself, Zhou Qing smiled and said, \"That is why I called you here. Besides aiding Lu Tieshan, there is another important task that I have for you.\"\"What is it?\"Zhou Qing let out a sigh before he said, \"On this mission you will have to first head for Canglan County. If possible, I hope that you will be able to think of a way to draw the great general to our side and help us deal with Qi Manor.\"\"At the very least, you must ensure that Qi Hao does not pull the general to Qi Manor's side.\"Zhou Yuan nodded. As the prince, going to Canglan County would show the sincerity of the royal clan.Zhou Yuan replied, \"Don't worry father, I will do my best.\"Zhou Qing chuckled before reaching into his clothes and fis.h.i.+ng out a scarlet red jade scroll on which light seem to flow. \"You will soon reach the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage and will formally be able to practice a Qi Cultivation Method. This is the Flame-Thunder mantra of our royal clan and will allow you to cultivate the grade 4 Flame-Thunder Qi. Take it and have a good look. If it is suitable, you may practice it.\"\"So this is the Flame-Thunder mantra?\" Zhou Yuan's eyes quivered.In this world, Genesis Qi cultivation methods were categorised into nine grades. In other words, there were nine grades of Genesis Qi.The better the Qi cultivation method, the better the quality the Genesis Qi. Grade 4 Genesis Qi was practically top tier in Great Zhou, and the ma.s.ses were only able to cultivate grade 1 or grade 2 Genesis Qi.\"Master didn't have time to impart any Qi cultivation methods to me back then, I wonder if big sis Yaoyao has any.\" Zhou Yuan smacked his lips. Given master Cang Yuan's mysteriousness and unfathomable power, the Qi cultivation methods he knew should far surpa.s.s the royal clan's Flame-Thunder Qi.Although he had such thoughts in mind, Zhou Yuan still took the Flame-Thunder mantra. If Yaoyao did not have any Qi cultivation methods, he would have no choice but to choose the former.\"Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage\u2026\"Zhou Yuan tightly grasped the jade scroll as antic.i.p.ation flooded his eyes. The Channel Opening stage could only be considered creating one's foundations. Only at the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage would one be able to finally take one's first step onto the path of cultivation.Only after reaching that level would one be able to truly experience the true wonders of Genesis Qi.\u2026Great Wu Empire.Royal city, Subdue Zhou City.Years ago, the Wu clan had rebelled against Great Zhou and seized her lands. From the name of Great Wu's capital, it was obvious that Great Wu intended on completely subduing Great Zhou, ensuring that she would never rise again.Majestic structures rose one after another in the Great Wu royal palace, extending all the way till the end one one's sight. Powerful Genesis Qi rippled from the many paG.o.das, enveloping every corner of the royal palace.Compared to Great Zhou, Great Wu's royal palace was undoubtedly much grander, and the latter's security was likewise far superior. This showed just how powerful Great Wu was.In a certain inner palace within the royal palace, a youth in yellow robes sat behind a desk. His skin was as fair as jade, while a pair of eyebrows akin to the a sword's edge decorated his extremely handsome face.The simple act of sitting there made him exude an aura of n.o.bility, standing high above everyone else like the pride of the heavens.A faint aura seemed to rise behind him like the roar of a coiling dragon.A faintly glowing blood red dot seemed to have been embedded between his brows. A sight that was both mysterious and strange.This youngster was the crown prince of the Great Wu Empire, Wu Huang.His face was indifferent as he flipped through the scrolls before him. Although he was only a youth, due to his special status in Great Wu, king Wu had allowed him to take part in the national affairs of Great Wu since a young age.At this moment, someone respectfully walked in, kneeled before the table and respectfully said, \"Crown prince, the secretary supervisor has sent some news.\"Wu Huang lifted his eyelids and reached out a hand to receive the bamboo tube. He removed the paper roll inside and slowly opened it as his eyes swept across it.\"Oh?\" Wu Huang's expression suddenly changed. A strange look surfaced on his handsome face as he said in an emotionless voice, \"How interesting, it's about the Zhou clan's sacred dragon.\"\"What a tenacious person. So he managed to survive even after having the Dragon's Resentment Poison sealed in his body by father?\"The kneeled figure asked in a cold voice, \"Your highness, shall we eliminate him?\"Wu Huang let out a soft chuckle. \"Our Great Wu Empire is currently busy with the Thousand Beast Empire and the Sword Empire. How can we possibly spare any attention to a practically dead Great Zhou.\"The figure replied in a low voice, \"But Zhou Yuan once possess the sacred dragon blessing and was claimed to be the sacred dragon of the Zhou clan.\"The moment these words left his mouth, he saw Wu Huang's cold eyes sweep over and immediately swallowed the rest of his words.Wu Huang wore an apathetic look as dragon Qi rose behind him, making him appear incomparably n.o.ble. His voice was calm as he said, \"You are wrong. Zhou Yuan is not a true sacred dragon. If he was, how would our Wu clan have succeeded?\"\"The sacred dragon blessing originally belonged to me and he was merely a tiny mistake. This error has already been corrected and brought back to the proper path. Hence\u2026\"\"Zhou Yuan is nothing but a fake dragon who once bore a destiny that did not belong to him, resulting in both he and Great Zhou paying a steep price.\"\"On the other hand, I am the true dragon. Therefore, the sacred dragon blessing ultimately returned to me.\"He stared at the figure before him as he slowly continued, \"So please do not make this blunder again. It was not I who stole his sacred dragon blessing but he who took what was mine. All I did was take it back.\"\"This is called returning to its rightful owner.\"\"Understand?\"The figure s.h.i.+vered as he gazed at the slightly smiling Wu Huang and hastily acknowledged in a respectful manner.Wu Huang threw away the bamboo tube and said in an indifferent voice, \"Go check on what this fake dragon is doing. Six channels\u2026 Do you know? With such pathetic strength, he does not even have the qualifications to stand before me.\"The figure respectfully responded, \"Your highness is the true dragon and Zhou Yuan is only an ant in comparison that is not even worth mentioning.\"Wu Huang picked up the rest of the scrolls and said, \"During the subsequent period of time, I have to focus on training so as to prepare for Cangmang Continent's approaching battle of the saints. It is this battle that is truly important. Do not bother me with matters regarding the crippled dragon in future.\"\"Understood!\" The figure responded.Wu Huang stared at the scrolls for a while, before he said, \"But since this matter has already come to my attention, I cannot take it as if nothing has happened. Tell them to give the Qi clan more support. If they are able to overthrow the Zhou clan, our Great Wu will have saved some effort. Else it will be somewhat troublesome due to the vow father made back then.\"He smiled at his point. \"Let this be a lesson for that crippled dragon. Let him know that he should properly behave himself as a cripple in future.\"His words were simple, but they seemed to have decided the fate of Great Zhou.He then smiled at the figure and said, \"Have a good look. What you see is a true dragon\"A single sentence to determine life or death. A single sentence to decide the destruction of a nation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 Ancestral Dragon ScripturePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayGreat Zhou royal palace, the fragrance pavillion.Yaoyao sat with a straight back in front of a crystal mirror while Tuntun lazed on her lap. Her fine black hair was draped over her shoulders, reaching all the way down to her slim waist. The soul wrenchingly beautiful face reflected in the mirror wore a distant and emotionless look.Behind Yaoyao, Qin Yu wore a gentle look as she helped comb Yaoyao's long hair.Ever since Yaoyao came to the royal palace, Qin Yu had become extremely fond of the former and practically treated her as a daughter.Although Yaoyao was rather distant, she had grown much gentler in response to the sweet and warm-natured Qin Yu. Therefore, the two grown increasingly close.\"So pretty.\"Qin Yu tied Yaoyao's long hair into a simple high ponytail, causing the usually distant girl to give off a slight aura of lively youthfulness. It was a sight that would take away one's breath.Yaoyao smiled faintly. \"Thank you aunt Qin.\"Qin Yu smiled as she stroked the girl's head. \"No need to be courteous. If staying in the palace is boring, get Zhou Yuan to accompany you out for a stroll.\"Yaoyao gave a slight nod.Tuntun suddenly opened its eyes at this moment and barked at the door. It transformed into black blur as it dashed forth, slamming into the stomach of the figure that had just entered.\"Hey, that hurt.\"The person who had just stepped through the door was Zhou Yuan. He was currently clutching his stomach with one hand, while the other supported Tuntun. The latter was currently biting and pulling his collar with a force so huge that Zhou Yuan was almost flipped over.\"Stop pulling, stop pulling!\" Zhou Yuan cursed as a servant girl brought over a plate of meticulously marinated Genesis Beast dried meat from behind. Only then did Tuntun let go of Zhou Yuan's collar and jump onto the silver plate, eyes narrowed as it started to savour the meal bite by bite.\"Does this little brute really take me as a meal ticket?\" Zhou Yuan jaw was tightly clenched in anger as he looked at Tuntun. The little brute's eyes practically turned green with anxiety whenever it saw him.Zhou Yuan shook his head, ignoring Tuntun as he walked towards Qin Yu and greeted her.\"I shan't disturb you children then.\" Qin Yu grinned, tousling Zhou Yuan's hair before leaving in an unhurried manner.Yaoyao stroked her ponytail and tilted her head, causing the end of the ponytail to bounce a little as her eyes swept towards Zhou Yuan.Zhou Yuan let out a chuckle as he fished out a scarlet red jade bottle from his sleeve and said in a somewhat miserable voice, \"You're becoming more and more picky. I spent a thousand Genesis crystals to buy this scarlet spirit wine.\"Yaoyao reached out, received the scarlet red jade bottle and took a small whiff, causing her eyes to brighten slightly. Soon after, she looked at Zhou Yuan and said, \"One does not curry favor for no reason. Speak. What do you want?\"Zhou Yuan let out an awkward chuckle. Soon after, he earnestly replied, \"Big sis Yaoyao, unblocking my seventh meridian channel is just around and corner and the eight meridian channel is likewise not far off. After unblocking all eight channels, I will be able to step into the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage and establish a Qi dwelling. When that happens, I should practice a Qi cultivation method.\"\"So you want a Qi cultivation method.\" A soft laughter escaped Yaoyao's mouth. She propped up a cheek with a hand and continued, \"Is your royal clan's Flame-Thunder mantra not good enough for you?\"\"The Flame-Thunder mantra can only cultivate grade 4 Genesis Qi. Even if I find a higher tier Qi cultivation method in future and change, much time will be wasted.\" Zhou Yuan sighed. Grade 4 Genesis Qi was indeed top of the line in Great Zhou, but his eyes were looking at a much further place.Yaoyao c.o.c.ked her head and pondered. \"I do have a few Qi cultivation methods.\"\"However, it still depends on your choice.\"Zhou Yuan was taken aback. \"What do you mean?\"Yaoyao pressed a hand onto her waist where an exquisite little cloth bag was hanging. It was a Universe bag that contained a pocket s.p.a.ce. Such items were rather uncommon. At the very least, there were less than a handful in the royal treasury and the s.p.a.ce within them spanned a dozen feet at most.The Universe bag flashed and a black jade strip appeared in Yaoyao's hand.\"This is grandpa Hei's Qi cultivation method, the Heavenly Yuan Canon. It can cultivate grade 7 Genesis Qi.\"Zhou Yuan's pupils tightened as he involuntarily cried out, \"Grade 7 Genesis Qi?!\"Shock filled his face. Let alone someone like himself, not even his father had seen such high grade Genesis Qi.Even the entire Great Zhou Empire could not be exchanged for such a high cla.s.s Qi cultivation method!Zhou Yuan's breathing grew hurried as his eyes turned a little red. Fortunately, he had considerable mental fort.i.tude and did not s.n.a.t.c.h it from Yaoyao. Instead, he took in a deep breath, looked at Yaoyao and said, \"Are there other options?\"Since Yaoyao had mentioned a choice earlier, there were definitely other alternatives. Qi cultivation methods that could be placed alongside the Heavenly Yuan Canon were likely not ordinary, right?Yaoyao grew silent for a while upon hearing this. With a gentle press of the Universe bag, a bone fragment appeared in her hand. The bone fragment was mottled with age and faint cracks could be seen on it. However, the moment it appeared, an indescribable pressure spread, causing the circulating Genesis Qi in Zhou Yuan's body to turn sluggish.Roar!Behind them, the hairs of the slowly eating Tuntun abruptly stood up as it ferociously pounced in front of Zhou Yuan and let out a roar at the bone fragment. One could see a faint scarlet red glow emerge on its body.Evidently, the bone fragment made Tuntun feel very threatened.\"What is it?\" Zhou Yuan was similarly frightened by the pressure from the mysterious bone fragment.Yaoyao's red lips parted slightly as she answered, \"A Qi cultivation method is recorded in this bone fragment. It is called.. the Ancestral Dragon Scripture.\"\"Legend speaks of a certain creature that was born when the world was created, a creature known as the Ancestral Dragon. It is said to be capable of devouring the heavens and destroying the land, an existence that towers even over the apex. It was from the body of the Ancestral Dragon that all living beings eventually emerged and from then on, numerous life forms appeared in the world.\"Zhou Yuan asked, \"More powerful than the Heavenly Yuan Canon?\"Yaoyao slowly said, \"In the beginning, it will only be able to cultivate grade 5 Genesis Qi.\"\"Grade 5 Genesis Qi?\" Zhou Yuan's eyebrows furrowed.\"There are four levels to the Ancestral Dragon Scripture. The first is the Omni Python Qi, a grade 5 Genesis Qi, the second is the World Subduing Heavenly Serpent Qi, a grade 7 Genesis Qi, and the third is the Galaxy Sacred Dragon Qi, a grade 9 Genesis Qi.\"Yaoyao's soft voice felt like thunder in Zhou Yuan's ears, causing his entire scalp to turn numb as his body trembled.\"Grade 9 Genesis Qi?!\"Zhou Yuan's shaky voice rang out. In this world, grade 9 Genesis Qi was already the apex. Who could imagine just how powerful someone who cultivated it would be.\"Wait!\" Alarm washed over Zhou Yuan as he looked at Yaoyao. \"Did you not say there were four levels?\"If the third level was already grade 9, then what could the fourth level be?Yaoyao's beautiful eyes seemed to turn as deep as the night at this moment as she nodded, before her airy voice sounded out once again, \"The fourth level is the true Ancestral Dragon Qi and it surpa.s.ses grade 9.\"Zhou Yuan fell b.u.t.t first onto the chair behind him, his eyes almost popping from their sockets while his mouth hung wide open. \"There are Qi cultivation methods in this world that exceed grade 9?!\"This Qi cultivation method had already went beyond Zhou Yuan's common sense. He even doubted the existence of such a heaven defying Qi cultivation method.Could this Qi cultivation method be the reason why master Cang Yuan and Yaoyao were pursued by their mysterious enemy, forcing them to hide constantly?Yaoyao slowly said, \"There are many mysteries in this world. 9 grades of Qi cultivation methods is just one way of thinking. If you never heard of something, it does not mean that it does not exist.\"\"However, although the Ancestral Dragon Scripture is powerful, practicing it is difficult and practically unprecedented. In addition, once you begin practicing the Ancestral Dragon Scripture, you will be unable to change to other Qi cultivation methods, or you will be devoured by it.\"\"What a tyrannical Qi cultivation method!\"It was at this point that Zhou Yuan's expression could not help but change. If that was true, it meant that every other road would be closed to him. The only option was to continuing advancing on the path of the Ancestral Dragon Scripture.Yaoyao gave a light nod. \"Besides this, there is another condition you must fulfill in order to practice this Qi cultivation method.\"Zhou Yuan immediately cut in, \"What condition?\"Yaoyao glanced at Zhou Yuan. \"You must carry a dragon type blessing.\"\"Dragon type blessing?\"\"It is said that the Ancestral Dragon's body transformed into all living things. Amongst them are some who are born with great luck. Strange signs appear at their births, seeming to take the shapes of carps, snakes, pythons, serpents\u2026 all of these can be considered dragon type blessings. It means that there is a sliver of Ancestral Dragon Qi in their bodies, allowing them to possess talent that surpa.s.ses the ma.s.ses.\"\"To begin practice of the Ancestral Dragon Scripture, this sliver of Ancestral Dragon Qi must be used as a primer.\"\"However, even if one fulfills the requirements, very very few people will be able to truly master this Qi cultivation method. Let's not even mention the fourth level, I'm afraid that since time immemorial, only one individual has been able to reach the third level.\"Yaoyao stared at Zhou Yuan as she continued, \"As for you, you were born with the sacred dragon blessing, and the Ancestral Dragon Qi in your body was even greater than other dragon type blessings. Hence, you might even have a ten percent chance of getting through the first stage of beginning the Ancestral Dragon Scripture, but it's still hard to say how many levels you will ultimately master.\"\"Unfortunately, your sacred dragon blessing was stolen and the majority of it was obtained by Great Wu's python and sparrow.\"Zhou Yuan's fists involuntarily clenched tightly as he bitterly laughed. \"So I am fated to never learn the Ancestral Dragon Scripture.\"He could not help but become a little dejected. After all, anyone who watched such an amazing heaven defying Qi cultivation method slip away would not be able to remain unaffected.However, Yaoyao shook her head. She reached out and grabbed Zhou Yuan's hand as she faintly said, \"That may not be so.\"Zhou Yuan looked at her in confusion.Yaoyao slowly opened Zhou Yuan's hand, revealing the blood-red lump at the center of his palm. Malicious resentment spread from it, causing one's heart to s.h.i.+ver.Yaoyao pointed at the blood-red lump and said in a soft voice, \"The ignorant king Wu believed that sealing the sacred dragon's resentment into your body will suppress you forever, but he did not know\u2026 that this Dragon's Resentment Poison is actually also a sliver of Ancestral Dragon Qi!\"Zhou Yuan's pupils shrank. \"You mean?\"Yaoyao nodded. \"You may use the Dragon's Resentment Poison as a catalyst to initiate the Ancestral Dragon Scripture. Thus, you will also be able to practice it.\"Yaoyao's bright eyes silently stared at Zhou Yuan as her airy voice echoed, \"So\u2026 what is your decision?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 Genesis ResourcesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"So what is your decision?\"In the fragrance pavilion, Yaoyao bright eyes were fixed on Zhou Yuan. The soft words that left her red lips caused him to fall into conflict, his eyes flickering indeterminately.It was hard to choose between the two.Of course, the Heavenly Yuan Canon would undoubtedly be the more reliable choice. Grade 7 Genesis Qi was more than enough for him to reign supreme over those of the same cultivation level. In fact, it would even allow him to have some confidence against enemies at a higher cultivation level than himself.Compared to the stable Heavenly Yuan Canon, the mysterious Ancestral Dragon Scripture was br.i.m.m.i.n.g with innumerable possibilities.Based on what Yaoyao had told him, Zhou Yuan could sense just how difficult it was to practice this Qi cultivation method. It was so difficult that he might not even surpa.s.s the first level in his entire lifetime and this first level could only grant grade 5 Genesis Qi, Genesis Qi that was clearly unable to satisfy him.Most importantly, there was no turning back once he chose to practice th Ancestral Dragon Scripture. One could change to other Qi cultivation methods if one felt that one's own was unsuitable, but this option was unavailable for the Ancestral Dragon Scripture. It akin to a path of no return.For the Ancestral Dragon Scripture, the only option was to advance endlessly.A choice that undoubtedly required a tremendous amount of courage and charisma.It was true that the path of the Ancestral Dragon Scripture would be fraught with danger, but\u2026 the possibility of unlimited growth caused excitement to flood Zhou Yuan's heart. It was basically impossible to give up on it.Hence, in the face of these two choices, even the normally decisive Zhou Yuan was stuck in a dilemma. His face fluctuated indeterminately, unable to make a decision.Yaoyao did not hurry him and merely watched in silence.The silence in the fragrance pavilion lasted for a very long time, before finally being broken by a long sigh.Zhou Yuan opened his eyes and looked towards Yaoyao as he slowly declared, \"I choose\u2026\"\"The Ancestral Dragon Scripture!\"Yaoyao's hand seemed to tremble a little, somewhat surprised by Zhou Yuan's choice. After all, compared to the Heavenly Yuan Canon, the Ancestral Dragon Scripture was filled with too much uncertainty.Zhou Yuan looked at Yaoyao, laughed in a somewhat self-mocking manner and said, \"Big sis Yaoyao, I do not want to experience the events of the past ever again; having others take away what belongs to me, even hurting those closest to me while I am powerless to do anything. Never again.\"Every time he saw his mother's pale complexion, Zhou Yuan's heart felt as if it was being cut by a blade. He knew that he would have long been dead if not for Qin Yu's constant infusion of essence blood to him.There was also Zhou Qing. He had been betrayed, his empire stolen and even had an arm cut off by king Wu when he tried to protect the things that mattered to him. He ultimately failed to save his own son, and greatly blamed himself day and night.All of this had happened due to powerlessness.\"The enemies I have to face in future will likely become stronger and stronger. Therefore, I need the greatest of powers in order to protect my family and myself.\"\"I want to be so strong that any existence would be unable to be even the smallest threat to me and those I care about.\"\"The Heavenly Yuan Canon is strong, very very strong, but it cannot give me the strength I yearn for. Thus\u2026\"He stared at Yaoyao and declared once again, slightly pausing between each word, \"I choose the Ancestral Dragon Scripture!\"Yaoyao could see the burning determination in Zhou Yuan's eyes, causing her to give a light nod before offering the mottled bone fragment in her hand.Zhou Yuan reached out, grabbed it and gave a little tug, but was unable to take it.\"Zhou Yuan, you will have no other roads to walk once you select it. Hence, you cannot regret this decision in future.\" A grave look emerged on Yaoyao's pretty face.Zhou Yuan grinned. \"Big sis Yaoyao, I've been tormented by the Dragon's Resentment Poison since young and have experienced how people treated me due to being unable to find my meridian channels. Therefore, I understand very well just how determined I am.\"\"This road may be difficult, but\u2026 I will definitely walk till the end!\"Zhou Yuan's voice was filled with resolution. Without any hesitation, he pulled even harder, removing the mottled bone fragment from Yaoyao's grasp. His expression was incomparably serious as he kept it.On the path of cultivation, the state of one's heart was the most important. Zhou Yuan's past experiences taught him that determination was essential if one wanted power. Once one was set on a goal, one needed to do all one could to realize it. Hence, one needed great willpower!Yaoyao watched Zhou Yuan keep the mottled bone fragment and sighed. \"Four Genesis resources are needed for you to begin practicing the Dragon Ancestral Scripture's first level.\"Yaoyao took out a piece of paper and handed it to Zhou Yuan.With a glance, Zhou Yuan saw the beautifully written words on the paper. However, when he took a closer look at the four Genesis resources needed, his face could not help but twitch.\"Genesis Swallowing Rock? Heavenly Gold Marrow? Nine Underworld Black Spring Crystal? Grade 4 python type Genesis Beast spirit?!\" Each of the four ingredients caused Zhou Yuan to cry out in surprise as his hands subconsciously trembled.Every single one of them was an extremely rare Genesis resource. Amongst them, Zhou Yuan had heard a little of the Heavenly Gold Marrow, which just happened to be present in the royal treasury. However, there were only a few drops.The addition of a single drop while forging a Genesis Weapon would allow the weapon to become much sharper than usual, and might even raise the grade of the final product. This was why it was extremely valuable.Moreover, the one that troubled Zhou Yuan the most was the grade 4 python type Genesis Beast spirit. Grade 4\u2026 this was comparable to a human Alpha-Origin stage expert!There were only a handful of Alpha-Origin stage experts in the Great Zhou Empire and obtaining a grade 4 Genesis Beast spirit was no different from killing an Alpha-Origin stage expert.The mere thought of this task made Zhou Yuan's heart s.h.i.+ver.After reaching the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage, one needed to use one's body as a furnace in order to refine your own Genesis Qi. To further elaborate, the Genesis Qi absorbed from the world is the most basic ingredient, while the Qi cultivation method is the blueprint or instructions. Genesis resources on the other hand are supplementary materials that can be added according to the blueprint. It is through refining and fusing all of these various components together followed by tempering that one will ultimately be able to create Genesis Qi of one's own.Every single piece is indispensable. Hence, even the supplementary Genesis resources must be properly prepared.Upon seeing Zhou Yuan's rather uncomfortable looking face, Yaoyao could not help but laugh and say, \"Do you regret your choice? There is still time to change.\"Zhou Yuan let out a bitter laugh, he did feel a little regret. Just the first level of the Ancestral Dragon Scripture already required such rare Genesis resources. Who knew what kind of mysterious ingredients were needed for the second, third and fourth levels?Only now did Zhou Yuan understand how difficult it was to practice the Ancestral Dragon Scripture. The prerequisites alone were already insane.However, determination quickly filled his eyes. \"I will think of a way to get these Genesis resources.\"Since his choice had already been made, such difficulties were naturally unable to shake him. Otherwise, he would have given up long long ago.Zhou Yuan's unwavering determination was a little admirable in Yaoyao's eyes. \"You'll have to hurry up if you do not plan on using the most basic Genesis Qi after reaching the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage.\"Ordinary Genesis Qi had no attribute nor any special effects. Hence, it was very lacking in battle power when compared to Genesis Qi produced through Qi cultivation methods.Zhou Yuan smiled bitterly as he nodded. Looks like he would have to trouble Zhou Qing since the current him really had no means of gathering these materials.\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 Advance Illusory StagePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOn the fifth day after obtaining the Ancestral Dragon Scripture, Zhou Yuan finally managed to completely unblock his seventh meridian channel. This brought him one step closer to the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage and made him increasingly anxious with regards to gathering the ingredients needed for the first level of the Ancestral Dragon Scripture.Royal palace.\"Father, have the Genesis resources I requested been prepared?!\" A pair of expectant eyes shot towards Zhou Qing the moment Zhou Yuan entered.In response, Zhou Qing could not help but let out a bitter chuckle. \"You brat, do you genuinely think that our royal treasury is all powerful?\"Even Zhou Qing could not help but shudder when he recalled the four items Zhou Yuan had requested.\"Moreover, are the Genesis resources you need really only used to cultivate grade 5 Genesis Qi?\" Zhou Qing was after all a knowledgeable individual and had encountered grade 5 Genesis Qi before. None of the grade 5 Genesis Qi he knew of required such rare and high quality Genesis resources.Zhou Yuan awkwardly laughed in response. Yaoyao had warned him that the Ancestral Dragon Scripture must be kept secret, hence, he had told Zhou Qing that he intended to practice a grade 5 Genesis Qi cultivation method.Zhou Yuan asked with a slightly vexed voice, \"Even the royal treasury is unable to gather them?\"Zhou Qing released a helpless sigh before retrieving a jade box from behind him. He opened the box, revealing a transparent jade bottle. The bottle was filled with water in which a drop of vicious gold liquid slowly revolved.It was the Heavenly Gold Marrow!Beside the jade bottle was a black crystal dotted with holes. An astonis.h.i.+ngly cold chill swept out from it, causing frost to form in the surrounding air. Meanwhile, sounds of flowing water could be heard from inside the crystal, as if spring water was flowing within it.The Nine Underworld Black Spring Crystal!Zhou Qing pointed at the jade box and said, \"The royal treasury only has these two.\"Zhou Yuan scratched his head. \"No Genesis Swallowing Rock or grade 4 python type Genesis Beast spirit?\"A displeased Zhou Qing glared at Zhou Yuan. \"Greedy brat, the four items you requested probably cost a total of 500,000 Genesis crystals. Moreover, you likely won't be able to purchase them even if you have the money.\"A year of collected taxes for the entire Great Zhou Empire only amounted to a million. From this, one could tell just how expensive these items were.Zhou Yuan smiled awkwardly. 500,000 Genesis crystals was a frightening sum indeed. It was practically enough to purchase an high tier Black Genesis Weapon from the auction house.And the only high tier Black Genesis Weapon of the royal clan was the Nine Flames Spear that belonged to Zhou Qing.\"Then what can we do?\" A miserable look emerged on Zhou Yuan's face. If he did not gather the four Genesis resources, he would not be able to initiate himself into the first level of the Ancestral Dragon Scripture.Zhou Qing frowned as he pondered for a while. \"I have heard of something like the Genesis Swallowing Rock before.\"\"Oh?\" Zhou Yuan's eyes brightened. As long as there was news, there would be a way.Zhou Qing elaborated, \"There is a rock in the great general's residence that is able to continuously absorb Genesis Qi and expel purer Genesis Qi in return. Thus, when placed in a room, training in the room will be more effective.\"\"Geat general Wei Canglan?\" Zhou Yuan was stunned. What a coincidence, he was about to head to Canglan County after all.\"Yes, but due to how valuable it is, whether or not you will be able to obtain it from him will depend on your abilities.\" Zhou Qing was unable to help. After all, it was not appropriate for him to force the great general to give this Genesis Swallowing Rock to Zhou Yuan.\"I will give it a try.\" Zhou Yuan nodded. At the very least, he now had some information. As for how to obtain it, he would have to think of a way.\"What about the grade 4 python type Genesis Beast spirit?\" Zhou Yuan looked towards Zhou Qing again.Zhou Qing's head started to ache somewhat when he heard this as he helplessly said, \"A grade 4 python type Genesis Beast.. even I find it rather troublesome to deal with a Genesis Beast of that level, to think that a brat like you actually wants its beast spirit.\"\"There is currently no news of such an item but I will continue to help you search for it. Besides this, with regards to the place you're heading to, Canglan County, the neighbouring Blackwater is home to innumerable Genesis Beasts. Likewise, countless Genesis masters hunt the Genesis Beasts there and with some luck, you might b.u.mp into the creature you seek.\"Zhou Yuan let out a helpless sigh. Looks like he would have to try his luck in Canglan County to get ahold of the remaining two Genesis resources.Zhou Yuan inquired, \"Father, when will we be leaving?\"His head had nothing but thoughts of quickly searching for the last two Genesis resources and then begin practicing the first level of the Ancestral Dragon Scripture, the Omni Python Qi.Upon seeing Zhou Yuan's impatient appearance, Zhou Qing could only helplessly chuckle and reply, \"In five days. I will instruct Lu Tieshan and a group of imperial guards to protect you on this trip to Canglan County.\"\u2026Time flew by. In the blink of an eye, four days had pa.s.sed.Night of the fourth day.On the bed, Zhou Yuan's eyes were tightly shut, a faint light flickering between his brows where a blurry seated figure could be seen. It was Zhou Yuan's Spirit.Rumble!A rumbling noise rang out from between Zhou Yuan's brow at this moment, indicating the divine grindstone was rotating. It was obvious that Zhou Yuan was currently using the Primal Chaos Divine Grindstone Visualisation Method to temper his Spirit.It had almost been half a year since he began practicing the Primal Chaos Divine Grindstone Visualisation Method. Zhou Yuan's Spirit was growing increasingly tough and powerful under his relentless training.In a formless black s.p.a.ce, an unimaginably huge grindstone slowly turned. Anything that was cast unto it would be crushed into nothingness.An illusory silhouette was currently bitterly enduring within the t.i.tanic grindstone.The upper and lower wheels slowly crushed its body. Every touch caused the illusory figure to tremble violently, as if it was bearing an immense pain.As it bitterly persisted, the two golden markings on the slowly turning grindstone suddenly joined together again.Nine rotations of the divine grindstone, every rotation a whole new realm!After half a year of tempering, Zhou Yuan's spirit had finally endured an entire rotation of the divine grindstone.Crack!As the two golden lines became one once again, Zhou Yuan's Spirit finally reached its limit and shattered. But soon after, an invisible ripple converged in front of the divine grindstone as an illusory figure was reconstructed.It was Zhou Yuan's Spirit.At this moment, the Spirit's eyes were shut a unique undulation pulsed from it. Zhou Yuan's Spirit had undoubtedly become much more material compared to before.In the room, Zhou Yuan suddenly opened his eyes and a bright light shot out from them. The rippling Spirit aura between his brows abruptly strengthened!\"Advance Illusory stage!\"Zhou Yuan felt the pulsing Spirit between his brows as wild joy flooded his face. After half a year of training, his Spirit had finally stepped into the advance Illusory stage.Now that it had reached this level, his Spirit power could materialize in the outside world, allowing him to perform Spirit based attacks like the Spirit Needle Rune Qi Yue had used in the Jade Spirit Waterfall back then. If he managed to catch an enemy off guard with such an attack, it would surely be very effective.Most importantly of course was that Zhou Yuan could now begin learning grade 2 Genesis Runes!Even a Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage opponent would be wary of grade 2 Genesis Runes.Being unable to quickly cultivate the Omni Python Qi had originally caused Zhou Yuan to be a little vexed, but now that he had the potential aid of grade 2 Genesis Runes, there was no longer a need to fear Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage foes whom have learnt Qi cultivation methods.Huu.Zhou Yuan let out a drawn out breath as he body gradually relaxed.\"I can finally head to Canglan County without too much worry.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 JourneyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe next day.In front of the royal palace.A group of imperial guards stood ready and waiting. Beside them, Zhou Yuan's gaze constantly swept outwards into the distance as he talked to Zhou Qing and Qin Yu, whom had come to send him off.Clatter clatter!The hurried sounds galloping was transmitted from afar as a fiery red horse seemed to fly towards them. It eventually came to a stop a short distance from them with a neigh and lithe figure gracefully dismounted.The figure naturally turned out to be Su Youwei. Today, she wore a grey s.h.i.+rt and trousers, while her long hair was bundled into a ponytail, making her look relaxed and pretty.The imperial guards did not stop her, allowing her to pa.s.s through and walk to the carriage. Due to having hurried here, her pretty face was a little flushed and beads of sweat dotted her fair forehead.\"Youwei greets his and her majesties.\" The first thing Su Youwei did was cup her fists and bow towards Zhou Qing and Qin Yu.Zhou Qing and Qin Yu responded with warm smiles. They had seen Su Youwei's performance during the cla.s.s ranking exam and were quite fond of this strong and independent girl.\"Youwei, treat this trip as a training experience. Also, help me take care of Zhou Yuan and don't let him cause too much trouble.\" Qin Yu smiled.Zhou Yuan chuckled. Both Yaoyao and Su Youwei were tagging along this time. Yaoyao was coming because she had become rather bored in the palace. As for Su Youwei, he hoped that she would be able to gain different experiences which would be beneficial for her cultivation.After all, Su Youwei was on the verge of unblocking her eight meridian channel and stepping into the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage. Hence, the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute no longer had much to offer her. So as to not delay her cultivation progress, Zhou Yuan decided to bring her along on this trip to Canglan County.\"It's about time, prepare to set off.\" Zhou Yuan glanced at the sky before turning to Lu Tieshan. \"You shall be tasked with protecting them.\"Lu Tieshan replied in solemn voice, \"Don't worry your majesty, I will offer you my head if anything happens to his highness.\"\"I do not wish for anything to happen to any one of you.\" Zhou Qing waved his hand.Lu Tieshan nodded, before he stood up and mounted his horse. With a wave of his hand, he loudly shouted, \"We're setting off!\"Zhou Yuan took a step onto the carriage, waving his final goodbye to Zhou Qing and Qin Yu before entering.The group began their journey, accompanied by rumbling sounds of movement as they pa.s.sed through various streets, ultimately exiting Great Zhou City and heading straight towards Canglan County.\u2026When Zhou Yuan left Great Zhou City.Qi Manor.In a certain study, Qi Manor's housekeeper, Qi Ling, respectfully reported, \"Master, Lu Tieshan and a thousand imperial guards have accompanied Zhou Yuan out of the city. Their destination should be Canglan County.\"Behind the desk, Qi Yuan nodded with an emotionless face.\"Looks like the royal clan has also heard of the most recent news regarding those ruins.\"An eerie light flickered in Qi Yuan's eyes as he indifferently said, \"Things did not turn out well for us in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute matter, but this time, I am determined to get my hands on the Fire Spirit Grain!\"The Fire Spirit Grain was a grade 4 Genesis Food, an item with an inestimable value. With it, Qi Manor would be able to both nurture and gather mult.i.tudes of experts.Just think about it, the royal clan had managed to stabilize their situation with the grade 2 Mysterious Crystal Rice. If Qi Manor obtained the Fire Spirit Grain, Qi Yuan believed that they would be able to completely crush the royal clan in less than a year.\"I will stay in Great Zhou City to keep Zhou Qing in check. You shall set off immediately, head for Canglan County and get in contact with Hao'er. He has after all managed to build up a place for himself there over the past two years. I want the both of you to find a way to pull Wei Canglan to our side!\"Qi Yuan's eyes hardened as he continued, \"As long as Wei Canglang stands with us, there will no longer be anything to fear and we will immediately take action to remove the royal clan.\"\"Of course\u2026\" Tea cup in hand, Qi Yuan icily said, \"If Wei Canglan shows any indications of leaning towards the royal clan, it will be best that you find a way to eliminate him. Once Wei Canglan dies, the Canglan army would be akin to a headless dragon, allowing Hao'er to swiftly take over and use them to attack the royal clan.\"Qi Ling responded, \"Understood!\"Qi Yuan's eyes narrowed like a vicious wolf as he said in a hair-raising voice, \"As for Zhou Yuan, tell Hao'er if there is a chance, make sure that the little b.a.s.t.a.r.d never returns to Great Zhou City!\"\"Canglan County is right next to Blackwater. It will not be strange for anyone to die there, even a prince.\"\"Since the little b.a.s.t.a.r.d cut off my son's arm, he shall repay this debt with his life!\"Qi Yuan's voice was as cold as a malicious spirit that had crawled out from the abyss, dripping with so much venom that hearing it would cause one's heart to s.h.i.+ver uncontrollably.Qi Ling immediately acknowledged before turning around and leaving.Qi Yuan watched Qi Ling leave before he lifted his head and looked in the direction of the royal palace as a cold voice echoed in the study,\"Zhou Qing, don't be so happy just because you won in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute affair. Once the Fire Spirit Grain falls into my hands, your royal clan will never be able to rise again!\"\"Qi Manor will definitely win this time! When that happens, I make sure to let both father and son have a taste of what it's like to be stray dogs!\"\u2026Canglan County sat at the southwest border of the Great Zhou Empire and was quite some distance from Great Zhou City. At Zhou Yuan and group's current pace, it would take several weeks to reach their destination.Fortunately, there was the company of Yaoyao and Su Youwei. Under the sunlight, those two beautiful faces were a rare treat for Zhou Yuan, making the dull journey rather exhilarating instead.However, this feast for the eyes was quickly cut short by Yaoyao because she did not want to watch Zhou Yuan pa.s.s his days so comfortably.\"Since you look so free and your Spirit has reached the advance Illusory stage, I will teach you a grade 2 Genesis Rune.\" In the carriage, Yaoyao threw a jade tablet at Zhou Yuan. The extremely complex rune on the tablet glowed faintly.\"This is a grade 2 Genesis Rune, Gold Ape Moves the Mountain Rune\u2026 when drawn on the body, it will amplify the strength of one's body, greatly increasing one's power.\"\"Oh?\"Zhou Yuan joyfully caught the jade tablet. Grade 2 far surpa.s.sed grade 1. If he inscribed the Gold Ape Moves the Mountain Rune on his body, the resultanting power would make the previous Rampaging Bull Rune pale in comparison.\"How complicated.\" Zhou Yuan shot a look at the complex rune on the jade tablet and could not help but frown. He estimated that the rune was made up of almost a thousand strokes. Without a strong Spirit, a few glances would definitely make one dizzy.Zhou Yuan shook his head, catching Su Youwei pursing her lips with a smile. She seemed to be amused by his pained look.\"What's there to see, don't think that you'll be let off either.\" Zhou Yuan was a little miffed as he rolled his eyes at her. Subsequently, he fished out a jade strip and tossed it at Su Youwei.Su Youwei hastily caught the jade strip and asked in a puzzled manner, \"What is this?\"Zhou Yuan smiled and said, \"A low grade Black Genesis technique I took it from the royal treasury, Heavenly Luo Hand. It's pretty suitable for you.\"Su Youwei grasped the jade strip as she said in a rather hesitant manner, \"Your highness, this is too precious.\"She knew the value of a low grade Black Genesis technique. Even the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute did not own any techniques of this level. It would at the very least cost several tens of thousands Genesis crystals, a price she would not be able to raise even if she sold herself.Zhou Yuan sternly said, \"We're not on a sightseeing trip. You're about to unblock your eighth meridian channel and reach the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage. If you manage to learn the Heavenly Luo Hand, you will have some battle power if we encounter any enemies.\"Su Youwei gently bit her red lips. She was not an unreasonable person after all and soon tightly gripped the jade strip as she earnestly nodded. \"Don't worry your highness, I will master it as soon as possible!\"Zhou Yuan chuckled and nodded. Before leaving Great Zhou City, Zhou Qing had given him a mid grade Black Genesis technique, Emperor Extreme Seal. Unfortunately, this technique was too adamant and inflexible in nature, hence not suitable for Su Youwei. Therefore, he planned to leave it for himself.\"Looks like we can no longer relax.\" Zhou Yuan sighed. He then began to concentrate all his attention on the jade tablet as he slowly copied each stroke.Thus, the following few weeks were mostly spent studying the Gold Ape Moves the Mountain Rune. If he had any free time, he would use it to practice the Emperor Extreme Seal, making him awfully busy.As this high intensity studying continued, Zhou Yuan and gang slowly slowly approached Canglan County.However, before they reached their destination, a certain incident made Zhou Yuan have no choice but to slow their speed.After almost two months of training, Su Youwei had finally unblocked her eighth channel.And once all eight channels were unblocked, the Qi Dwelling would emerge.Su Youwei was about to step into the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 Yin Yang Qi DwellingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn a certain s.p.a.cious carriage.Su Youwei's eyes were tightly shut, her back straight, while her legs crossed together in a lotus position. Faint rumbling sounds could be heard as the surrounding Genesis Qi converged towards her and poured into her body.The rumbling sounds were due to the vibration of her eight channels, a precursor to the opening of a Qi Dwelling.There was both nervousness and curiosity on Zhou Yuan's face as he stared at her. This was the first time he would see someone establish a Qi Dwelling.While the swirling Genesis Qi caused Su Youwei's clothes to flap, Zhou Yuan lowered his gaze. He could sense streams of Genesis Qi swiftly gathering towards her lower abdomen area.The Qi Dwelling was one of the mysteries of the human body, seemingly present yet not and difficult to detect. Only when all eight meridian channels were unblocked would one be able to call out to the Qi Dwelling and open it, connecting it to the rest of the channels in the body.More and more Genesis Qi converged at Su Youwei's lower abdomen area. Moments later, a very faint bubbling sound was heard.It was as if a tiny hole had appeared and all of the Genesis Qi was sucked into it.At the same time, Zhou Yuan suddenly saw a cyan light appear at Su Youwei's lower abdomen, clearly visible even through her clothes.\"A cyan Qi Dwelling?\"Zhou Yuan's eyes flashed. Due to the varying circ.u.mstances of each individual, the Qi Dwelling opened was generally cla.s.sified into four different tiers.The first was the most ordinary and common colorless Qi Dwelling.Second, the cyan Qi Dwelling, third, the purple Qi Dwelling and finally the golden Qi dwelling.A higher tier Qi Dwelling was tougher and could store more Genesis Qi. Everyone knew that the Qi Dwelling was a vessel to store Genesis Qi and would constantly expand through cultivation.Starting with a higher tier Qi Dwelling would undoubtedly be advantageous. In fights with those of the same cultivation level, not only would one's Genesis Qi would be stronger, more Genesis Qi would also allow one to last longer in battle.Yaoyao corrected, \"It is not cyan... \"Zhou Yuan was a little stunned. He concentrated and sure enough, he saw a tiny purple dot emerge as the cyan light grew deeper and deeper. Purple light gradually engulfed the cyan light.\"A purple Qi Dwelling!\"Zhou Yuan's face filled with emotion. Based on his knowledge, a cyan Qi Dwelling meant that one was pretty outstanding, while the even rarer purple Qi Dwelling was an indication of the most talented geniuses of crazy potential.\"I never imagined that Su Youwei's innate talent would be so great.\" Zhou Yuan sighed. Although he could tell from her cultivation speed that she was very talented, he never expected that she would actually open a purple Qi Dwelling.The purple light intensified more and more before gradually fading away after some time.Su Youwei's tightly shut eyes opened at this moment, shooting out rays of Genesis Qi light. Her skin gleamed like jade as a feeling of pressure slowly unfurled from her body.The Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage!\"Is this the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage? It is indeed something.\" Zhou Yuan clicked his tongue in amazement. Su Youwei's aura was several times stronger than before, and even he felt a little pressured.According to his estimate, without the Gold Ape Moves the Mountain Rune, he would not be able gain any advantage in a fight against Su Youwei.\"Congratulations. Not only have you reached the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage, you have even opened a purple Qi Dwelling.\" Zhou Yuan grinned.Su Youwei's pretty face was overflowing with joy. However, she frowned slightly a moment later and said in a somewhat hesitant manner, \"My Qi Dwelling feels a little strange.\"Zhou Yuan and Yaoyao were stunned, unable to understand what her words meant.Su Youwei was also a little puzzled as she elaborated, \"I do not know why but my Qi Dwelling feels as if it has been divided into two sections.\"Zhou Yuan was completely lost. \"Aren't Qi Dwellings one complete body? What do you mean divided into two?\"Yaoyao pondered for sometime before she suddenly approached Su Youwei, casting a backward glance at Zhou Yuan as she said, \"Turn around.\"Zhou Yuan was utterly confused but still turned around under Yaoyao's watching eyes.Upon seeing Zhou Yuan turn, Yaoyao then said to Su Youwei in a soft voice, \"Let me take a look.\"Only after seeing Su Youwei nod did Yaoyao stretch out a hand and gently pull aside Su Youwei's clothes, revealing a tiny flat waist. The fair stomach was flat and supple to the touch, not even the slightest trace of excess fat could be seen.Su Youwei blushed a little. She now understood why Yaoyao had asked Zhou Yuan to turn around.Yaoyao shut her eyes as she gently touched Su Youwei's small stomach, her Spirit senses reaching out.A long while later, Yaoyao opened her eyes and withdrew her finger. A trace of surprise could be seen on her face.Yaoyao slowly said, \"Your Qi Dwelling is indeed split into two parts.\"\"What's going on?\" Zhou Yuan turned around and asked in a rather worried voice, \"Did something go wrong?\"Yaoyao mulled for quite some time before she answered, \"Nothing is wrong. If my guess is correct, her Qi Dwelling is likely the legendary Yin Yang Qi Dwelling.\"She had faintly sensed a Yin Yang Genesis Root in Su Youwei's body when helping the latter inscribe the Genesis Gathering Rune previously. It was a rather unique Genesis Root.Therefore, the strange development today was likely related to the Yin Yang Genesis Root.\"Yin Yang Qi Dwelling?\" Zhou Yuan and Su Youwei looked at each other, they had obviously never heard of such a thing.\"Relax, a Yin Yang Qi Dwelling is not a bad thing but instead very advantageous.\" Yaoyao waved her hand as if shooing away their worries.\"Advantageous?\"\"Yes, its greatest advantage is that she is able to practice two different Qi cultivation methods at the same time.\" Yaoyao lifted a snoring Tuntun into her arms, gently stroking it as a faint smile emerged on her lips.\"Two different Qi cultivation methods?\" Zhou Yuan and Su Youwei were taken aback. Did this not mean that there would be two different kinds of Genesis Qi in the Qi Dwelling at the same time? Would the two different Qis not clash?\"If it was a normal Qi Dwelling, it would indeed only be capable of containing one type of Genesis Qi.\" Yaoyao nodded as she spoke. \"But it is different for her. The Yin Yang Qi Dwelling is somewhat akin to having two Qi Dwellings. Thus, it is able to accommodate two Genesis Qi without them clas.h.i.+ng.\"\"However, you need to practice a Yin and a Yang attribute Qi cultivation method in future and absolutely must not practice dual Yin or dual Yang attribute Qi cultivation methods. Or else, your Yin Yang Qi Dwelling will be unable to maintain balance, ultimately resulting in the destruction of the Qi Dwelling.\"Su Youwei's expression changed slightly.\"Moreover, there cannot be too huge of a gap in the grade of Yin and Yang Qi cultivation methods or equilibrium will be broken.\"Yaoyao's expression turned stern as she continued, \"Although the Yin Yang Qi Dwelling is powerful, there are numerous restrictions. Of course, if you are one day able to break the part.i.tion in the Qi Dwelling and allow Yin and Yang to blend, you will definitely become an apex-like existence in this world.\"Su Youwei blinked in a somewhat uneasy manner and looked at Zhou Yuan.Zhou Yuan's face was full of happiness. He quickly retrieved a jade strip from his clothes and said, \"Yang nature Qi Genesis method? It just so happens that the royal clan's Flame-Thunder mantra is of the Yang attribute.\"\"Your highness, only those of the royal clan can learn this!\" Su Youwei was startled. She had naturally heard of the royal clan's Flame-Thunder mantra. It was a Qi cultivation method that allowed one to generate grade 4 Genesis Qi, and its value far exceeded the Heavenly Luo Hand from before.\"It's only grade 4 Genesis Qi.\" Zhou Yuan forced the jade strip into Su Youwei's hands. \"Truthfully speaking, its grade is a little unsatisfactory. Don't worry though, I may not have the capability now, but I will let you change to a better one in future.\"In response to Zhou Yuan's overbearingness, Su Youwei could only bite her red lips as her slender fingers tightened around the jade strip. She ultimately did not reject as she gave Zhou Yuan a deep look with bright eyes that flickered with a little moisture, a sight that tugged a little at one's heart.\"Since he gave you a Yang attribute Qi cultivation method, I will provide a matching Yin attribute Qi cultivation method.\" Yaoyao smiled upon seeing this and retrieved a jade strip from the Universe Bag at her hip before offering it to Su Youwei. A cold aura emanated from the jade strip.\"This is the Niflheim sutra and can cultivate grade 4 Niflheim Qi.\"Su Youwei hesitated for a moment and looked towards Zhou Yuan. Only after a nod from the latter did she receive the jade strip and gratefully said, \"Thank you big sis Yaoyao!\"Yaoyao offhandedly replied, \"It is only a grade 4 Qi cultivation method. When you grow stronger in future, you should try to find better Yin and Yang Qi cultivation methods.\"\"However, you must remember that balance is key. If balance is broken, Yin and Yang will fall into chaos and you will suffer the consequences.\"Su Youwei forcefully nodded. \"I will remember big sis Yaoyao.\"Zhou Yuan enjoyed the sight of the two pretty girls from the side. One was elegant and pretty while the other was exquisite and aloof. It was like watching the moon and stars dance in the sky, a naturally relaxing sight.However, before he could admire any further, Yaoyao's bright eyes swept towards him.\"Have you mastered the Gold Ape Moves the Mountain Rune yet?\"A crestfallen Zhou Yuan could only turn his head around upon hearing this and continue studying the rune.Su Youwei could not help but cover her mouth to m.u.f.fle her laughter when she saw Zhou Yuan's deflated look, while the corners of Yaoyao's lips turned slightly upwards. The two gorgeous faces made the inside of the carriage substantially brighter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62 Canglan County, Wei QingqingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCanglan County was sat on the southwest border of the Great Zhou Empire.By the time Zhou Yuan and his group reached the outskirts of the city, half a month had already pa.s.sed.Zhou Yuan observed the gigantic city from the carriage. Compared to the grandness of Great Zhou City, Canglan City seemed a little menacing. It was after all close to the border and had a first row seat to the skirmishes that constantly broke out. Hence, a taunt aura of vigilance naturally surrounded the place.In addition, majority of the pa.s.sersby gave off a faint b.l.o.o.d.y scent and varying Genesis Qi undulations.Canglan County neighboured Blackwater, and only G.o.d knew how many Genesis Masters gathered here first before heading to Blackwater to hunt Genesis Beasts or search for other opportunities. The Black Forest Mountain Range Zhou Yuan had went to previously was practically a child in comparison.Lu Tieshan rode over on his horse and reported in a strong voice, \"Your highness, Canglan City is just ahead, but we cannot enter the city because our numbers are too many and have to head for the neighbouring Canglan barracks instead.\"Zhou Yuan nodded. \"It's getting late. We'll go to the barracks and visit general Wei tomorrow.\"Lu Tieshan acknowledged and turned around to pa.s.s the order. Soon after, the thousand men group transformed into a rumbling flood that flowed past the city, heading straight for the barracks.The approach of unfamiliar troops naturally drew a response from Canglan barracks. Dozens of riders quickly exited the barracks and rode towards Zhou Yuan.\"Who goes there!\"The riders blocked their path, a commander in red armor at their head. As Zhou Yuan and the rest approached, they realised that the commander was a girl.The red soft-armor she wore nicely wrapped around her rather toned figure. Below her scale-like battle skirt were a set of long slender legs that appeared even more enchanting when paired with her battle boots.Under her helmet was a cold yet pretty face, the long shapely eyebrows slightly erect, giving her an air of valiance.\"A captain of the imperial guard, Lu Tieshan.\" Lu Tieshan gazed at the riders as he continued in a stern voice, \"We have come on orders of the king and plan to enter Canglan barracks.\"\"So it's captain Lu.\" The face of the red armor girl thawed slightly. It was clear that she had received news of their arrival. \"Wei Qingqing greets you.\"\"Wei Qingqing?\" Zhou Yuan's heart shook slightly when he heard this name. Wei Canglan had a son and a daughter whose name was Wei Qingqing. It seems that this daughter was valiant looking female commander before them.\"So it's general Wei's daughter.\" Lu Tieshan cupped his fists together.Upon hearing this, Wei Qingqing indifferently said, \"The only one present here is Canglan army's second-in-command Wei Qingqing, there is no general Wei's daughter.\"Lu Tieshan seemed to choke for a moment, before he helplessly nodded his head and moved to the side, revealing Zhou Yuan. \"This is his highness Zhou Yuan. He has come with me this time.\"Wei Qingqing lifted her gaze and looked towards Zhou Yuan. She had originally never heard of the latter, but he had become quite a hot topic recently after the cla.s.s ranking exam of the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute. Word on the street was that their once crippled and unable to cultivate prince had defeated Qi Manor's second prince, Qi Yue.However, her brows quickly knitted together because she had spotted Yaoyao and Su Youwei at Zhou Yuan's side. The two were extremely beautiful and made him look like one of those frivolous princes.\"So, it is prince Zhou Yuan.\" Due to having a bad first impression, Wei Qingqing's face was stoic as she cupped her hands together while shaking her head inside. Looks like someone must have pulled some strings in the cla.s.s ranking exam.She was truly unable to believe how a frivolous prince that would even bring along two beauties on a trip would be able to defeat Qi Yue, whom was rumoured to be rather talented.Ever since young, Wei Qingqing had a rather strong character and hated those sc.u.mmy men whom indulged in pretty women. Else she would never have become a part of the Canglan army with her ident.i.ty as a woman.\"Follow me. I will arrange a place for all of you to stay.\" Wei Qingqing did not wait for Zhou Yuan to reply and immediately turned her horse around.\"Eh\u2026\"This sight caused Zhou Yuan to be a little baffled. Why did it seem that this girl held some dislike towards him?\"Let's go your highness. We have no choice but to keep a low profile on someone else's territory.\" Lu Tieshan advised, afraid that Zhou Yuan had been angered. After all, their biggest goal was to bring Wei Canglan to their side. If Zhou Yuan fell out with Wei Qingqing here, it would likely worsen Wei Canglan's image of them.Zhou Yuan chuckled, showing that he did not mind. He had been on the receiving end of such treatment for many years and naturally would not be angered by Wei Qingqing's att.i.tude.\"Let's go.\"Zhou Yuan waved his hand, indicating for the troops behind to follow. They quickly caught up to Wei Qingqing and entered the enormous Canglan army barracks.A thousand imperial guards poured into the barracks, drawing the attention of countless eyes as they pa.s.sed. However, the majority of these gazes were filled with curiosity and provocation.The three strongest armies in the Great Zhou Empire were known to be the imperial guards, king Qi's army and the Canglan army.As troops that were equally well known for being the strongest, the Canglan army soldiers were naturally sizing up the imperial guards, hoping to see if the latter did truly have the qualifications to be as famous as themselves.While Zhou Yuan and group advanced, the crowd in front of them suddenly parted as several figures emerged.Wei Qingqing dismounted upon seeing them and muttered something under her breath.Zhou Yuan and Lu Tieshan also walked forward at this moment.Wei Qingqing turned around and said, \"These are the officers of Canglan army, and this is my elder cousin, Wei Ting.\"She pointed towards a certain woman as she spoke. The latter was also clothed in a set of soft-armor that did nothing to hide her s.e.xy figure. However, her facial features were not as pretty as Wei Qingqing's. Wei Ting's eyes swept across Zhou Yuan as a superficial smile emerged on her lips. \"Isn't this our famous prince? It must be so nice to have two beauties accompany you even on such a long journey.\"Zhou Yuan frowned when he heard her words. He could sense that this woman seemed to have something against him.However, he soon found the reason behind her hostility. A tall and slim young man walked forward from the woman's side. He wore a set of white armor while his helmet was currently tucked under his arm, displaying a handsome smiling face.Faint but powerful Genesis Qi pulsed around him, evidence that he was a Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage expert. Moreover, it was the advance Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage!Zhou Yuan's eyes faintly narrowed as he observed the young man in white armor. The latter's face was a little familiar.Under Zhou Yuan's watching eyes, the white armor man approached with smile and said, \"You are prince Zhou Yuan? We can be said to have met before.\"The white armor youth grinned as he extended a hand towards Zhou Yuan, however, the former's gaze was akin to a snake's.\"I am Qi Hao. I heard that my disappointing younger brother had one of his arms chopped off by your highness?\"Zhou Yuan eyes hardened. As expected, this young man was Qi Yue's elder brother, Qi Hao.\"As the saying goes, punches and kicks have no eyes in a fight. No one else can be blamed for his lack of ability.\" Zhou Yuan's expression and voice were calm as he also extended a hand to shake Qi Hao's.The smile on Qi Hao's face grew wider as he nodded in acknowledgement. \"Indeed, that brat does deserves to lose an arm.\"He looked straight at Zhou Yuan and continued in a seemingly genuine voice, \"Us Canglan army brothers are very happy to hear that our guests today are the imperial guards. Your highness must absolutely attend the welcome party tonight.\"\"Moreover, we army people are rather straightforward in nature. If your highness is unable to make it, I'm afraid that everyone will feel that your highness is looking down on them.\"Zhou Yuan's eyelids dipped a little as he replied, \"Don't worry. Since all of you are so welcoming, I will definitely make an appearance.\"Qi Hao smiled and nodded before he said in a low voice, \"However, I feel that there is something I should warn your highness about first. Canglan County is right next to Blackwater, it won't be strange for even a prince to die here. Hence, your highness must be careful in this place.\"Zhou Yuan chuckled and also lowered his voice, \"Then you should be even more careful. Since even a prince may die, a little manor prince dieing will be even more inconspicuous.\"Hearty laughter erupted from Qi Hao as the two tightly grasped each others hand, before releasing at the same time. However, chilling murderous intent swelled in their clas.h.i.+ng gazes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63 Awe in a Single MovePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNighttime.Numerous bonfires burned in the enormous barracks, chasing away the darkness of the night as they illuminated half of the sky.At the very center of the barracks was a wide platform, several bonfires burning around it. Every bonfire was surrounded by soldiers who were happily drinking and eating, making noise that soared into the heavens.Zhou Yuan, Yaoyao, Su Youwei and Lu Tieshan were seated at the center.Opposite Zhou Yuan and his group, Wei Qingqing shot a look at at the two girls beside him and said, \"It must feel great to have beauties accompany you everywhere.\"Yaoyao merely glanced at the Wei Qingqing and did not say anything. On the other hand, Su Youwei could not longer tolerate this girl's treatment towards Zhou Yuan. Hence, her red lips parted slightly as she retorted, \"Since deputy-commander Wei is also a lady, why do you treat other women as objects to be admired?\"As she spoke, Genesis Qi trembled around Su Youwei, displaying her Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage strength.Wei Qingqing was stunned. There was now an additional trace of seriousness when she looked at Su Youwei. The fact that she was able to reach the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage at her age definitely meant that she was a genius, and in no way a mere pretty vase to admire.\"I was blind, my apologies.\" Wei Qingqing was rather straightforward and immediately gave Su Youwei a slight nod, showing that she was sorry.However, Wei Qingqing's frown grew even deeper than usual when she looked towards Zhou Yuan again, as if she felt that the company of such an outstanding girl was truly wasted on him.At this moment, Qi Hao suddenly smiled from beside Wei Qingqing and asked, \"Hehe, your highness, there are many brothers in Canglan army that are dying to exchange pointers with the brothers of the imperial guard and liven up the place abit. We hope to know his highness' opinion.\"Loud cheers from the numerous surrounding Canglan army warriors followed. Their eyes were filled with the desire to battle.Zhou Yuan looked towards Lu Tieshan. The latter nodded and loudly said towards the imperial guards, \"Make sure to properly receive all challenges, do not lose the face of the imperial guards!\"\"Understood!\" The ones who had been dispatched this time were the elite of the imperial guard, and hence naturally proud individuals. They had long been itching to respond to the repeated provocations from the Canglan army.A muscular figure shot out, landing on the stage as a powerful voice echoed, \"Imperial guard, Tong Wudi. Which brother from the Canglan army wants to have a go?!\"Genesis Qi swirled around this figure, displaying his initial Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage strength. He was one of the officers in the imperial guard.\"Haha, great! Canglan army, Sun Meng. I will entertain you!\" A figure also shot out from the Canglan army side. He was clearly not any weaker than Tong Wudi.Cheers erupted from all around the moment both individuals got onto the stage.Both parties did not waste any time with words. After cupping their fists together, ferocious attacks exploded, causing dust to fly. Punches and kicks flew one after another, making the intensity of the fight more than clear.The atmosphere below the stage was explosive, troops from both sides madly shouting and cheering.The fight lasted for quite some time before ending in Tong Wudi's narrow victory, causing countless cheers to sound out once again.After the opening act, experts from both sides ascended the stage one after another. The intensity of the fights made the cheering around the stage rise and fall like waves.Zhou Yuan eagerly relished each fight. All of these warriors had been tempered by blood and fire, and their attacks were decisive and fierce, far surpa.s.sing the bouts between the students of the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute.As the atmosphere grew more and more lively, Qi Hao suddenly stood up and said with a seemingly casual smile, \"I heard that your highness managed to turn around a pretty desperate situation during the cla.s.s ranking exam and become pretty famous in Great Zhou. This has made us Canglan army brothers rather curious about your highness. Will you show us a thing or two to broaden our horizons?\"The surrounding eyes swept over and stared at Zhou Yuan in interest. Everyone had heard of the rumors that their prince was unable to cultivate, and were thus very surprised when they heard news about the recent cla.s.s ranking exam.\"He target is me after all.\"Zhou Yuan's expression remained unchanged. He just knew that Qi Hao wanted to cause trouble for him tonight. The latter was clearly planning on making Zhou Yuan lose face in front of the Canglan army in an attempt to hurt the both his reputation and the royal clan's. So even if Wei Canglan chose to side with the royal clan in future, the Canglan army soldiers would feel that the royal clan was useless, allowing for other thoughts to rise in their minds.A seemingly small matter was in actuality filled with Qi Hao's evil intentions.Qi Hao grinned as he looked at Zhou Yuan. With a wave of the former's hand, a thin man stood up. \"I've heard that his highness defeated my younger brother while he was using the Channel Breaker art to unlock all eight channels. So our Canglan army will send a true eight channel expert to test his highness abilities!\"The smart Qi Hao did not send out a Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage expert because no one would find it disgraceful for Zhou Yuan to lose. Therefore, someone who had unblocked all eight channels but had yet to open a Qi Dwelling was the most suitable opponent. It was more than clear that Qi Hao had put quite a lot of thought into this decision.\"Hehe. It is fine if your highness feels that there is no need. After all, us common folk and your highness live in completely different worlds.\"Qi Hao sighed deeply as if he fully understood, but his intentions were extremely malicious. If Zhou Yuan were to reject at this point, the Canglan army soldiers would feel that he was looking down on them due to his status as prince. As such, their impression of him would naturally become rather negative.By the side, Wei Qingqing's expression changed. She had just realised Qi Hao's intentions and was about to speak up.Just as Wei Qingqing was about to speak, beside her, Wei Ting said to her ear, \"Qingqing, we should take this chance to see exactly how capable our prince is. The atmosphere in Canglan County has become a little restless due to the recent news regarding the ruins. If the prince does not have any ability and is humiliated, he will likely be unable to take it and leave, saving the rest of us some trouble.\"Wei Qingqing hesitated a little upon hearing this but eventually nodded. Wei Ting did have a point. If Zhou Yuan was really not capable, returning to Great Zhou City would be the safer option so as to prevent inciting Zhou Qing's anger if anything unfortunate happened.Countless gazes turned towards Zhou Yuan at this moment, waiting for his reply.Under their gazes, Zhou Yuan raised his head and looked at the grinning Qi Hao before suddenly smiling, \"Since everyone is in such high spirits, I can't possibly ruin the mood.\"How could he not know Qi Hao's intentions. However, Qi Hao was a little too gullible if he believed that this would suppress Zhou Yuan.Zhou Yuan stood up, jumped and landed on the stage as the Heavenly Yuan Brush appeared in his hand. The martial form was immediately activated, causing the brush to grow into a long spear.The Heavenly Yuan Brush pointed to a ground at a slanted angle as a faint smile emerged on Zhou Yuan's face. \"Come on up, we'll count it as my defeat if you manage to receive a single blow from me.\"\"Oh oh oh!\"Zhou Yuan's words instantly drew countless strange noises from the watching crowd. Soldiers from the both the Canglan army and the imperial guard could not help but cheer. Disregard Zhou Yuan's strength for the moment, just his boldness alone was very to their liking.Wei Qingqing was momentarily stunned before she remarked, \"Bold words.\"Beside her, Wei Ting smirked in disdain.Qi Hao chuckled softly before retrieving a long fiery-red blade and handing it to the lean man. \"Go. If you win, this mid grade Genesis Weapon will be yours.\"The lean man quickly received the weapon, joy bubbling in his eyes. A mid grade Genesis Weapon was worth over a thousand Genesis crystals, something that a soldier like him would never be able to afford.Blade in hand, the lean man leapt onto the stage, eyes practically burning as he stared at Zhou Yuan.Zhou Yuan ignored the searing gaze, his expression akin to deathly still water. The surrounding Genesis Qi flowed into his body through his nose and a split second later, he suddenly shot forward, headed straight for the lean man.\"High grade Genesis skill, Flaming Blade Beheader!\" The lean man did not dare to delay. With a roar, he grasped the blade with both hands and swung it downwards as flames emerged on its body.It was an extremely deadly chop that gave off an air of violence. It was evident that the lean man's strength was top tier amongst eight channel pract.i.tioners.His attack was both fiercer and more ruthless than Qi Yue's had been during the cla.s.s ranking exam.However, Zhou Yuan's body did not even flinch in response to such a powerful blow. His charge continued, the tip of the Heavenly Yuan Brush bringing up sparks as it streaked across the ground.Huu.Zhou Yuan suddenly took in a deep breath as Genesis Qi poured into his body. With a sudden jolt of the Heavenly Yuan Brush, green light spilled from its tip.\"Auraflare technique!\"This time, the green aura extended several inches from the brush tip. This combined with the power of the Heavenly Yuan Brush far exceeded the time when Zhou Yuan had used it during the cla.s.s ranking exam.Swis.h.!.+The Heavenly Yuan Brush was thrust like a spear as his body shot forward, accompanied by a piercing sound while it shredded even the air itself. In the end, the brush clashed against the flaming blade of the lean man under the watching eyes of the crowd.Clang!The sound of metal against metal rang out as sparks flew.At the same time, everyone watched as one of the figures miserably shot backwards, taking step after step on the ground, only managing to steady himself several dozen steps later.Uproar!While he was stabilizing his body, everyone looked towards him before bursting out into noise. The figure was the eight channel lean man.No one had expected him to be incapable of handling even a single blow from Zhou Yuan!The lean man's face was filled with shock. He slowly raised the fiery-red long blade in his hand, only to discover the numerous cracks that had emerged on its body, before it shattered soon after\u2026Astonishment rose in the eyes the onlookers. Did prince Zhou Yuan just destroy a mid grade Genesis Weapon? Just how much power was needed to do that?Near a certain bonfire, Wei Qingqing's eyes widened slightly when she saw this. She could clearly feel just how destructive Zhou Yuan's previous blow had been.Even an initial Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage expert would feel threatened by its power.A sliver of amazement flashed in Wei Qingqing's eyes as she stared at Zhou Yuan's figure and mumbled, \"So the rumors are true.\"On the stage, the Heavenly Yuan Brush in Zhou Yuan's hand was slanted towards the ground as he smiled, \"Thanks for letting me win.\"Qi Hao had believed that sending someone who was about to open a Qi Dwelling would be enough to defeat Zhou Yuan, but the former never imagined that Zhou Yuan had grown stronger after the cla.s.s ranking exam and unblocked his seventh meridian channel.It was likely that only a handful of people under the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage would be capable of receiving a single blow from the current him.*Cheer*!Countless Canglan army soldiers burst out into cheers below the stage. Respect and admiration was now present in the eyes that looked towards Zhou Yuan. His beautiful move had evidently won over all of these soldiers who respected the strong.\"Prince Zhou Yuan! Prince Zhou Yuan!\"No one knew who started it, but deafening cheers began to sound out one by one, echoing across the entire barracks.Beside one of the bonfires, Qi Hao's face appeared a little rigid under the fire light.It was obvious that he never imagined his original plan to ruin Zhou Yuan's reputation would instead do the opposite. The prince from Great Zhou City had gained the acknowledgement of the Canglan army warriors.This was a little akin to a certain saying: go for the wool and come home shorn.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64 Master YingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter returning to his seat beside the bonfire, Zhou Yuan could clearly feel the changes in how everyone looked at him. There was no longer any scrutiny, but instead admiration and surprise.\"It seems that it is true, you did defeat Qi Yue.\" Wei Qingqing's bright eyes glowed with amazement as she stared at Zhou Yuan. She had previously been under the impression that something fishy had been going on during the cla.s.s ranking exam, but the formidable attack Zhou Yuan showed earlier had stunned even someone like herself.Only a handful of people under the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage would be capable of receiving such a strike.\"I was blind previously. Please accept this toast as an apology.\" The straightforward Wei Qingqing raised her winecup towards Zhou Yuan and downed it in a single gulp.Her motions were confident and contained no traces of deception.Zhou Yuan smiled as he returned the toast. The tiny bit of sulkiness he had from before due to Wei Qingqing's tartness has faded away. In fact, he rather admired the latter's forthcoming att.i.tude.Beside Wei Qingqing, Wei Ting smirked and said, \"Hehe, prince Zhou Yuan does indeed have some skill. However, the extremely dangerous Blackwater is located right next to Canglan County. Defeating an eight channel pract.i.tioner is really no reason to feel secure. I'm afraid that your highness will still have to be a little more careful while you're here.\"Zhou Yuan faintly smiled in response. \"There is no need for you to worry too much on my behalf.\"He could tell that Wei Ting was a little smitten with Qi Hao and as the saying went, if you loved someone, you'll also hate his enemies. Thus, Zhou Yuan could feel that she was pitting herself against him.However, it did not really matter to him. Wei Ting was only Wei Canglan's niece, and her status nowhere near as important as Wei Qingqing's.Qi Hao's rigid expression recovered at this moment, a smile emerging on his face once again as he said to Zhou Yuan, \"Your highness is pretty good. No wonder my unworthy little brother lost to you.\"Zhou Yuan replied with a slight smile, \"It's mostly thanks to Qi Manor's Auraflare technique.\"Qi Hao's face instantly blackened. Even someone as shrewd as himself was barely able to hold back a spew of vulgarities in response to Zhou Yuan's words.Yet, he could not refute those words because they were true. Zhou Yuan had used Qi Manor's Auraflare technique to defeat both Qi Yue and the eight channel man from earlier.Qi Hao's eyes were stormy as he said, \"Your highness should be careful. Things that belong to Qi Manor are not so easily swallowed!\"\"Then I hope that no one else will deliver such treasures to me again.\" Zhou Yuan chuckled.Murder flowed in their eyes as they looked at each other.*Cough*!Suddenly, a soft cough from Wei Qingqing broke the tension as she shot each of them a glance and said in a calm voice, \"This is Canglan County. Regardless of how huge of a grudge there is between you two, it is best that neither of you breaks Canglan County's rules.\"As Wei Canglan's daughter, how could she not know of the terrible relations.h.i.+p between the royal clan and Qi Manor. But since Wei Canglan chose to be neutral, they naturally would not help either party.Qi Hao's smile became gentle as his gaze s.h.i.+fted towards Wei Qingqing, before he approached her and said, \"Qingqing, I will bring someone to pay a visit to great general tomorrow.\"Wei Qingqing frowned. \"My father is not in a good mood recently. I hope that you will not disturb him.\"She knew that Qi Hao's goal was to draw great general Wei to Qi Manor's side.By Wei Qingqing's side, Wei Ting hurriedly smiled as she interjected, \"Ai yah Qingqing, don't say such things. I heard Qi Hao tried very hard to find a master highly proficient in Genesis Runes. This master is especially proficient in expelling poisons and Qi Hao likely hopes to help little Bin this time.\"Wei Qingqing was taken aback. Her expression was now a little warmer when she looked at Qi Hao. The biggest concern of the Wei family was to expel the poison in her little brother. After all, he was the only son of the entire Wei family.Her little brother's worsening condition was the reason for her father's troubled self.Wei Qingqing asked in a rather nervous manner, \"A master proficient in expelling poisons? Will it work?\"The Dao of Genesis Runes was both broad and deep. Hence, some support base Genesis Runes existed which were capable of expelling poisons.Qi Hao replied, \"This master is proficient in grade 3 Genesis Runes.\"\"Grade 3 Genesis Runes.\" Wei Qingqing's pretty eyes brightened. Such talent was extremely rare even in the entire Great Zhou Empire. Looks like Qi Hao had indeed invested a great deal of time and effort.\"Then I'll have to thank you.\" Wei Qingqing nodded as a smile emerged on her face.\"Don't worry about it, it's only natural that I do so. As his big bro, seeing little Bin's state makes my heart ache.\" Qi Hao smiled, continuously trying to better the relations.h.i.+p between them through his words.Zhou Yuan frowned as he observed from the side with the cool eyes of a bystander. It seems that Qi Manor was becoming more and more aggressive, even investing a lot of thought into this issue and inviting a Genesis Rune expert over. If they managed to cure Wei Bin, the Wei family would owe them a huge debt of grat.i.tude. When that happened, even someone like Wei Canglan would likely be shaken no matter how firm on neutrality he currently seemed.Moreover, Zhou Yuan's most important mission this time was to ensure Wei Canglan did not side with Qi Manor.Zhou Yuan's eyes flickered with thought, before he lifted his head and smiled at Wei Qingqing. \"It just so happens that we also intend to pay great general Wei a visit tomorrow.\"Wei Qingqing responded with a nod, before once againing turned towards Qi Hao and began bombarding him with questions regarding the background of the Genesis Rune expert. It was clear that this was very important to her.Qi Hao wore a slight smile of his face, a pleased look flitting across his eyes as he shot a glance at Zhou Yuan.\u2026As the sky grew darker, the welcome party came to an end.A complentatize look decorated Zhou Yuan's face as he and his group returned to their allocated lodgings. Beside him, Lu Tieshan's expression was rather grim. After a quick scan of their surroundings, he said in a low voice, \"Your highness, if Qi Hao really manages to cure Wei Bin, our situation here will become rather problematic.\"Receiving such a huge favor would likely make Wei Canglan lean towards Qi Manor. After all, Wei Bin was the only son of the Wei family and only he could carry on their bloodline.Zhou Yuan gravely nodded.Soon after, he looked towards Yaoyao and asked, \"Big sis Yaoyao, will you accompany me tomorrow?\"Yaoyao slightly rotated her head, casting a glance at Zhou Yuan. Even under the night sky, her gorgeous face gave off a faint jade glow. \"When the time comes, I will help you take a look.\"After speaking, entered her tent with Tuntun in her arms.Zhou Yuan could only worriedly scratch his head in response to her curt answer.\u2026The next day.Zhou Yuan, Lu Tieshan, Yaoyao and Su Youwei saw the waiting Wei Qingqing, Qi Hao and the rest when they arrived at the east gate of the barracks.However, there was now one more person at Qi Hao's side, a grizzled hair old man. This elder had a pair of sunken eyes which appeared rather cold and stern. His expression was indifferent, making him appear rather arrogant.Before this elder, even Wei Qingqing was wearing a slight smile on her face.\"Your highness, are all of you ready?\" Upon seeing that Zhou Yuan and his group of four had arrived, Wei Qingqing smiled before pointing at the elder beside her and said, \"This is master Ying, the Genesis Rune master Qi Hao invited to help expel the poison in my little brother.\"After hearing Wei Qingqing's introduction, master Ying swept an indifferent glance at Zhou Yuan and gave a slight nod, his expression still filled with arrogance.The strength of a master that could draw grade 3 Genesis Runes was comparable to a Heaven Gate stage pract.i.tioner. However, such masters were very rare in the Great Zhou Empire.\"A mere grade 3 Genesis Rune and he dares to call himself a master. The one beside me hasn't even said anything.\" Zhou Yuan mumbled in his heart as he nodded at master Ying.\"Let's go.\"Wei Qingqing did not waste any more time, evidently rather anxious. With a wave of her hand, her steed shot forward, galloping straight towards Canglan County city.Qi Hao pulled the reins of his horse, coming to Zhou Yuan's side with a playful smile as he said in a low voice, \"Your highness, I'm afraid that Canglan County will no longer welcome you after today. I suggest that you scram back to Great Zhou City as soon as possible.\"With a loud laugh, he kicked his horse and the fiery-red steed also shot forward.Zhou Yuan's eyes turned frosty as he watched Qi Hao's leaving figure. Without further ado, Zhou Yuan also waved his hand, bringing the group along as they swiftly caught up.He was still somewhat doubtful. Why did a master proficient in grade 3 Genesis Runes have such confidence in dealing with the Black Venom King's poison? A poison that even an Alpha-Origin stage pract.i.tioner would be greatly wary of.He really wanted to see just what kind of tricks Qi Hao was going to pull today!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65 Getting Rid of the PoisonPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe general's residence stood at the center of Canglan County city and was undoubtedly the most well guarded place in the entire city. In fact, detachments of patrolling guards could be seen patrolling the streets as the group neared their destination.Fortunately, with Wei Qingqing leading them, they did not face any obstructions all the way to the general's residence.The group got off their horses and entered the residence, walking past several corridors and courtyards before finally arriving at the main hall.The moment they stepped through the doors, Zhou Yuan's gaze was cast towards the master's seat where a middle aged man was seated. He wore purple robes and appeared rather lean, while numerous little black dots were visible on his face.An extremely strong presence emanated from his body as he sat there, causing Zhou Yuan and the rest to feel some pressure.Evidently, this middle aged man in purple was the great general of the Great Zhou Empire, Wei Canglan.Wei Qingqing called out as she entered the main hall, \"Father.\"Wei Canglan raised his head and looked at the group. His gaze paused on Zhou Yuan for a moment as he rose and said in an indifferent voice, \"Wei Canglan greets his highness Zhou Yuan.\"Zhou Yuan cupped his fists together. \"Zhou Yuan greets great general. Father has asked me to ask how you are doing.\"Wei Canglan's expression did not change as he replied in a flat voice, \"I'm not doing too great.\"Zhou Yuan's eyes lowered slightly. It was obvious that Wei Canglan still held a grudge from his response.After answering Zhou Yuan, Wei Canglan turned his gaze towards Qi Hao and the elder beside him. \"I believe that this honoured guest is master Ying right? I have long heard of you.\"His cold face grew much kinder at this moment, clearly aimed at master Ying.\"Greetings great general.\"Master Ying withdrew his arrogance in front of Wei Canglan, respectfully bowing as he cupped his fists together.Wei Canglan asked, \"I heard from my little girl that master is adept in the art of Genesis Runes and specializes in poison expelling Genesis Runes?\"Master Ying smiled slightly as he answered, \"General's son has been afflicted by the Devil Miasma Poison, right? I once encountered this poison while in Blackwater and ultimately managed to neutralize it.\"Upon hearing these words, Wei Qingqing's face immediately filled with joy, growing respect in her eyes as she looked at master Ying. Even a smile had emerged on Wei Canglan's solemn face.Wei Canglan cupped his fists and said, \"Then we'll have to trouble master Ying. I will be greatly thankful if you cure my son!\"Qi Hao smiled a little at this moment. \"Great general need not be so courteous. It's mostly thanks to my father that we managed to invite master Ying this time.\"Wei Canglan's expression fluctuated for a moment. Qi Hao's words were clear. Accepting master Ying's help would be akin to accepting Qi Manor's good will.Although this did not mean that they would now side with Qi Manor, Canglan County's neutral position would be slightly affected.Wei Canglan shot a glance at Zhou Yuan as he hesitated for a while. However, his love for his only son ultimately won and he said in a low voice, \"Then I'll have to thank Qi Manor for their kindness. If my son is cured, I will surely pay a visit to give my thanks.\"A grin was revealed on Qi Hao's face as he covetedly swept a pleased glance at Zhou Yuan. If Wei Canglan visited Qi Manor, it would undoubtedly signal to numerous factions that the great general's faction was no longer neutral.This would undoubtedly affect the Great Zhou Empire's current state of affairs.Zhou Yuan was expressionless as he lowered his gaze slightly, while anxiety flitted across Lu Tieshan's eyes.Wei Qingqing cast them an apologetic look but did not say anything. The poison in Wei Ben was a thorn in their entire family's hearts, and they had did all they could to help him recover.Now that such a hard to come by chance to resolve the problem had appeared, they were naturally unwilling to give up on it.Wei Canglan was rather anxious as his gaze turned towards master Ying. \"There is no time to lose, please start the treatment.\"Master Ying responded with an indifferent nod.Upon seeing this, Wei Canglang said to Wei Qingqing, \"Qingqing, arrange a place for prince Zhou Yuan to rest.\"Zhou Yuan interjected at this moment, \"Great general, please allow us come along and have a look. It just so happens that I too study the art of Genesis Runes, and hope to observe master Ying's techniques such that I may learn a thing or two.\"Wei Canglan hesitated for a while. It was not appropriate for him to reject since he had done a disservice to Zhou Yuan earlier and thus looked towards master Ying.Master Ying merely swept an eye at Zhou Yuan as a smile of disdain formed on his mouth. \"Since your highness is also proficient in the ways of Genesis Runes, feel free to follow and have a look. However, my skills are not so easily learnt.\"Evidently, he was under the impression that Zhou Yuan wanted to steal his techniques.\"Then let's go.\" Wei Canglan did not waste any more time upon seeing this and led the way out of the hall, heading towards the rear courtyard, while everyone else quickly followed.A s.p.a.cious and brightly lit room was located in the rear courtyard.Wei Canglan practically flooded in with the rest. As Zhou Yuan's eyes swept around the place, he saw a young nine year old boy on the bed. The boy's face was sickly pale, and black dots could be seen all over body, dots that gave off a foul smell.Currently, the boy was shyly peeking at the huge group that had entered.When Wei Qingqing saw this, she hurriedly walked forward and soothed him in a soft voice, \"Don't be afraid little brother, they have come to help you get rid of the poison.\"There was no longer any trace of the valiance she had displayed in the barracks.Wei Canglan tenderly gazed at the young boy as he walked forward and gently stroked the latter's head. Subsequently, hope-filled eyes turned towards master Ying. \"Please help him master.\"Master Ying strutted over as w.a.n.g Canglan hastily gave up his seat. After being seated, master Ying looked at the black spots on Wei Bin's body and said, \"The poison has already entered deep into the bone. This is very serious indeed. If delayed any longer, I'm afraid that he would not longer be able to keep his life.\"The moment these words were said, Wei Qingqing paled, while Wei Canglan's expression changed.\"Master, you have to save my little brother!\" Wei Qingqing begged with red eyes.Qi Hao stepped forward, his hand landing on Wei Qingqing's shoulder as he consoled in soft voice, \"Don't worry Qingqing, master Ying will definitely save him.\"Wei Qingqing promptly nodded, taking no notice of the hand that was now on her shoulder.Master Ying smiled as he nodded and pridefully said, \"General Wei and miss Wei can rest easy. Since I have come, I'm naturally confident in dealing with the poison.\"\"Undress young master Wei.\" Master Ying instructed with a wave of his hand.A servant girl immediately stepped forward from the side and very carefully removed Wei Bin's clothes, revealing the black dots and pale body underneath.Master Ying retrieved a dark grey Genesis Brush from his waist, concentrating slightly as the brush descended. The brush tip flickered as it slowly painted cryptic stroke after stroke on Wei Bin's body.Everyone held their breaths, afraid to make even the slightest noise.Wei Qingqing's and Wei Canglan's faces were filled with anxiety and hope, while Qi Hao wore a faint smile. There was a pleased look in his eyes as he looked towards Zhou Yuan and the rest from time to time, as if victory was already in his grasp.Zhou Yuan was expressionless, while a restless Lu Tieshan tightly clenched his fists.They knew that their situation in Canglan County would become extremely th.o.r.n.y if master Ying succeeded in curing Wei Bin. Moreover, the subsequent contest for the treasure of the ruins would become extremely disadvantageous.After all, given their strength, it would be very difficult to put up a fight against those from Blackwater without Wei Canglan's support.The implications of this matter were really far too great.While varying expressions decorated everyone's faces, Yaoyao carried Tuntun in her arms, her beautiful face indifferent and her bright eyes faintly flickering as she observed the Genesis Rune being drawn by master Ying.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66 ExposedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe room was stiflingly silent and no one dared to speak. The only noise that could be heard was the nearly inaudible rustle of master Ying's Genesis Rune Brush across the skin.As time slowly flowed, an extremely complicated rune began to emerge on Wei Bin's body. The rune extended across half of his body and gave off a faint yet astonis.h.i.+ng aura.\"It's a grade 3 Genesis Rune!\" There was a grave expression on Wei Canglan's face. Soon after, he remarked with a sigh of admiration, \"But it looks to be a support type rune, so little Bin's weak body should be able to handle its power.\"With one last hooking motion, master Ying's brush tip completed the final stroke. If one took a look at this moment, one would see a mysterious glow emerge from the now complete Genesis Rune. The light spread a little before shrinking back, burrowing into Wei Bin's body.Wei Bin released a groan of pain as he tightly clenched his fists.Upon seeing this, Wei Qingqing anxiously called out, \"Little brother!\"Master Ying smiled faintly and said, \"No need to worry miss Wei, my Genesis Rune has begun neutralizing the poison, a process that will be a little painful.\"Wei Qingqing nodded when she heard his explanation. She could only try to restraint the worry in her heart though her gaze never budged an inch from Wei Bin.A long and tense wait ensued, before everyone discovered that the black spots on Wei Bin's body had indeed started to show signs of receding. In a short few minutes, the originally appalling black dots had completely vanished.\"The Devil Miasma Poison has been neutralized?!\" Wei Qingqing's shocked voice rang out as joy flooded her face.Wei Canglan's eyes were wide open, his fists tightly clenched, his heart trembling with emotion.Master Ying proudly said, \"I came across this grade 3 Genesis Rune by chance. It is known as the Poison Neutralization Rune and is capable of neutralizing all poisons, even one as domineering as the Devil Miasma Poison.\"Wei Canglan nodded as he sighed in admiration, \"The Poison Neutralization Rune is indeed very formidable. Although it is only grade 3, it has managed to dispel even the Black Venom King's Devil Miasma Poison.\"He looked towards master Ying and respectfully cupped his fists. \"Master Ying is truly the benefactor of my Wei family.\"Wei Qingqing also hastily bowed towards master Ying.Master Ying responded with a light smile, \"I came here on the request of another.\"Wei Canglan could not help but sigh in his heart as he glanced at the smiling Qi Hao and the expressionless Zhou Yuan. This debt of grat.i.tude was really far too great.Wei Canglan said, \"Your highness, you should temporarily stay in the barracks. A storm is stirring over Canglan County and all sorts of characters have gathered here. The barracks is the safest place for you.\"Lu Tieshan's expression changed slightly. Did Weird Canglan intend to confine them to the barracks? If so, how would they be able to vie for the Fire Spirit Grain and Jade Infant Fruit?Qi Hao had a faint smile on his face as he looked towards Zhou Yuan, a toying smile overflowing with mockery.Wei Qingqing sighed inwardly and shook her head.\"What are all of you so happy about?\" As the atmosphere grew heavier, an indifferent yet melodious voice was heard. Everyone turned, only to find that it was Yaoyao who had spoken.Qi Hao chuckled and said, \"Hehe, young master Wei's poison has be successfully neutralized and is on route to a full recovery. Is this not a matter worth celebrating?\"Yaoyao stroked Tuntun's fur as she said, \"It would certainly be a happy event if the poison was fully neutralized, but I'm afraid that such superficial effort would instead hurt him even more.\"The expression of everyone in the room changed the moment these words were said.Master Ying was the first to react. His expression frosty as he scolded in anger, \"Little girl, what nonsense are you spouting!\"Wei Canglan frowned deeply, his eyes like a lion's as he stared at Yaoyao. \"What do you mean young miss? If you are spouting nonsense, I'm afraid that I will have to teach you a lesson even if you are part of his highness' entourage.\"Yaoyao paid no attention to them, walking towards the bed instead as her eyes swept over Wei Bin while her red lips parted slightly, \"Poison Neutralization Rune? What a joke.\"Master Ying's rage swelled as he shouted, \"Are you blind little girl? Do you see any traces of poison on his body? Do not blame me for being rude if you continue to utter such unreasonable nonsense!\"By the side, Wei Qingqing's brows were also furrowed. There was currently a hint of healthy rosiness on Wei Bin's pale face, a sign that the poison had indeed been successfully neutralized. Wei Canglan's expression was stern because he had checked previously and the Devil Miasma Poison had indeed disappeared from Wei Bin's body.Yaoyao continued to ignore master Ying's bellowing and instead indifferently said to Wei Canglan, \"Poke a needle three inches above the tailbone.\"Master Ying's pupils seemed to shrink when he heard these words. He immediately faced Wei Canglan and said in a low voice, \"Great general, I was invited to provide my services, not to be told off by a little wench!\"Qi Hao also spoke up, \"Great general, master Ying rushed here from far away to save young master Wei. It will be really cold to doubt him at this point.\"Wei Canglan hesitated after hearing their words.Zhou Yuan suddenly interjected at this moment, \"Great general, young master Wei's life is at stake here. It will be best to get to the bottom of it so as to avoid any future regrets.\"Wei Canglan's expression fluctuated for some time. He ultimately cupped his fists towards master Ying and said, \"Please accommodate me master Ying, I will definitely seek justice on your behalf if I find that they are slandering you.\"\"Bring me a silver needle!\"Wei Canglan icily shouted and a servant girl immediate brought over a silver needle.Wei Canglan grabbed the needle and approached the bed as he confirmed in a low voice, \"Three inches above the tailbone?\"Yaoyao replied indifferently, \"All of the Devil Miasma Poison has been forced into that very spot by master Ying. No other place will work, it has to be here.\"Wei Canglan took one long and deep look at Yaoyao before decisively taking action. The needle in his hand instantly pierced the spot three inches above Wei Bin's tailbone. Half of the needle disappeared, before being slowly drawn out.Everyone's expressions abruptly changed the instant the needle emerged.The tip of the needle was pitch-black and gave off a pungent smell.It was the Devil Miasma Poison!Wei Qingqing's face changed drastically, abruptly raising her head as an icy glare shot towards master Ying.Wei Canglan was white with rage. He turned his head, lifting the needle as he stared at master Ying and said in an hair-raising voice, \"May I ask master Ying what exactly is going on?\"Master Ying had paled substantially, but still shamelessly answered, \"It seems that the poison was not fully neutralized. This must be the some remnants.\"Qi Hao's face twitched as he forced a smile and suggested, \"Maybe great general can let master Ying try again?\"Yaoyao's tone was apathetic as she said, \"It isn't a case of the poison not being fully neutralized, in fact, that was no Poison Neutralization Rune, but a poison suppression rune.\"A poison suppression rune entailed forcibly suppressing the poison in the body through special methods. However, this rune of master Ying's was indeed pretty decent to have so cleanly suppressed the poison such that even Wei Canglan was unable to sense that something was amiss.\"Although you've temporarily suppressed the Devil Miasma Poison, this temporary measure will only last for a year. After which, the Devil Miasma Poison will resurface once again and become unstoppable. Even the greatest of techniques would not be able to save him then.\"\"I believe that those you 'saved' with the 'Poison Neutralization Rune' ultimately met very pitiful ends, right?\"Wei Canglan's and Wei Qingqing's expressions abruptly changed the moment these words were said. If gazes could kill, master Ying would have died a dozen times over.Sweat covered master Ying's forehead as he looked at Yaoyao in fear. Never in his wildest dreams would he have imagined that the latter would see through his tricks. One must know that even an Alpha-Origin stage expert would not find anything wrong.Boom!Genesis Qi suddenly exploded from master Ying's body as he transformed into a flash of light and shot out. He could no longer bear Wei Canglan's man-eating gaze and hurriedly escaped.Wei Canglan's expression was eerily frightening. With a flick of his finger, the needle in his hand was coated in green Genesis Qi and disappeared with a swish.AHH!A miserable cry suddenly echoed over from far away several breaths later.Wei Canglan icily said, \"Bring him in. To think that someone dares to bring his scam to my residence, does he really believe that I am unable to deal with him?\"Someone respectfully acknowledged outside the room and swiftly left to comply to the great general's order.Qi Hao's face was deathly pale, his hands faintly trembling as he hatefully looked at Zhou Yuan and Yaoyao. His originally perfect plan had went awry because of these two.Wei Canglan indifferently commanded, \"Men, bring prince Qi somewhere else to rest.\"Guards entered and invited Qi Hao out. His gaze was br.i.m.m.i.n.g with murder towards Zhou Yuan when he left.However, Zhou Yuan returned the gaze with a warm smile.After master Ying and Qi Hao left, the room became suffocatingly silent once again. Wei Qingqing's eyes were tinged red as she softly cried while Wei Canglan appeared years older as he seated himself.Yaoyao frowned as she shot a glance at the two. \"What's there to cry about. He isn't dead yet.\"Wei Canglan was taken aback. He seemed to realise the underlying meaning behind Yaoyao's words and quickly lifted his head, looking towards the extremely beautiful young girl as he hurriedly said, \"Please forgive me for offending you earlier.\"After what had happened, he no longer dared to underestimate the Genesis Qi-less girl.Having apologised, Wei Canglan then carefully continued, \"May I ask if the young lady knows of any way to save my son?\"Yaoyao slightly c.o.c.ked her head in thought for a while before she said, \"I will not save him, but\u2026 he may.\"Her finger pointed towards Zhou Yuan.Wei Canglan's and Wei Qingqing's eyes instantly locked onto Zhou Yuan.Under their stares, Zhou Yuan felt his scalp turn numb and almost cursed out loud. Even master Ying, who had the ability to draw a grade 3 Genesis Rune, was incapable of dealing with the Devil Miasma Poison. What use would someone like him, who was only at the grade 2 level, be?Who understood his capabilities better than himself?Big sis Yaoyao, don't sabotage me!You should be the savior that reveals herself and shock then till they shake!Zhou Yuan furiously cursed inside, but in the face of Wei Canglan's expectant eyes and the pitiful teary Wei Qingqing, the former could only respond with a hollow chuckle and nod.He knew that odds were he would also be 'invited' to leave like Qi Hao if he shook his head.\"Ha, haha\u2026\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He then turned towards Yaoyao and asked in a low voice, \"How do I save him?\"Who better understood his own capabilities than himself? None of the Genesis Runes he had mastered were able to neutralize poisons.Yaoyao's red lips curled slightly upon seeing Zhou Yuan's appearance, before she raised her head and said to Wei Canglan, \"He says that he needs to make some preparations, it'll take about ten days.\"Wei Canglan was stunned. \"What is needed? I might be able to help.\"\"Just some ingredients for the Genesis Rune, there's no need to trouble general Wei.\"Wei Canglan warmly said, \"I will immediately prepare a guest room in my residence for your highness and the rest to stay over this period. It's safe here and no mishaps will occur.\"Zhou Yuan nodded as he shot a glance at Yaoyao. The latter's earlier performance made him feel a little less guilty. After all, Yaoyao was not someone who messed around. It was likely that she had her reasons for doing things this way.Zhou Yuan regained his cool and slowly said, \"Great general, I can save young master Wei, but I have two conditions.\"Wei Canglan solemnly replied, \"Please speak your highness. Wei Bin is the only son of my Wei family and I will not hesitate to even give my life.\"Zhou Yuan did not waste time with frivolities and directly stated his goal, \"First, I hope that great general will aid me in obtaining the Fire Spirit Grain and Jade Infant Fruit.\"Wei Canglan was not surprised. After pondering for a while, he responded, \"The information regarding the recent discovery in the ruins has already spread in Canglan County and Blackwater. Hence, an intense battle will not be avoidable.It is likely that even the Black Venom King will also partic.i.p.ate.\"Murder overflowed in Wei Canglan's eyes at the mention of the Black Venom King.\"However, if your highness is really able to save Wei Bin, the Canglan army will do everything we can!\" Wei Canglan's deep voice rang out. In his eyes, Wei Bin's life was number one.Wei Canglan's decisiveness somewhat shocked Zhou Yuan. Soon after, he chuckled and said, \"As for the second condition, I've heard of a certain item belonging to the general's residence, the Genesis Swallowing Rock. I hope to request this item from you.\"\"The Genesis Swallowing Rock huh\u2026\" Wei Canglan fell into thought. He eventually nodded and said, \"Although it is a treasure, it is nothing compared to my son's life.\"\"As long as your highness saves my son, these two conditions are no problem at all!\"Having come to an agreement, happiness flitted across Zhou Yuan's eyes. He cupped his fists together and declared, \"I will do my best to neutralize the poison in young master Wei.\"Wei Canglan smiled and said, \"Great. Qingqing, bring his highness to their lodgings and ensure that they are well received.\"Wei Qingqing nodded and turned towards Zhou Yuan. A rare gentle smile decorated her pretty face, her long legs taking a step forward as she proceeded to lead the group.Wei Canglan watched them leave as he began to frown.After guiding Zhou Yuan and the rest, Wei Qingqing returned the room. She hesitated somewhat before she asked, \"Will prince Zhou Yuan really be able to get rid off the Devil Miasma Poison?\"Although master Ying was repulsize, he was still rather skilful in Genesis Runes. No matter how one looked at it, Zhou Yuan had inferior Genesis Rune abilities.Wei Canglan's expression was rather complicated. A soft sigh escaped his lips, before he replied, \"The only option left to us now is to treat a dead horse as if it were alive. I hope that he is not lieing, or else, I will chase him out of Canglan County even if he is the prince of Great Zhou. \"\u2026Guest room of the great general's residence.Once through the door, Lu Tieshan worriedly looked at Zhou Yuan, \"Your highness, are you truly able to neutralize the Devil Miasma Poison?\"Zhou Yuan rolled his eyes in response, \"You're asking me? Then who should I ask?\"Lu Tieshan smiled bitterly. \"Then I'm afraid that we will be chased out of Canglan County ten days later.\"Zhou Yuan helplessly shook his head before turning towards the currently leisurely seated Yaoyao, who was toying with Tuntun, as he inquired with an awkward smile, \"Big sis Yaoyao, isn't this sabotaging me? Given your mastery of Genesis Runes, won't the Devil Miasma Poison problem be easily resolved with a wave of your hand?\"Yaoyao carried Tuntun in her arms, her slender finger lightly tapping it's head as she lifted her gaze, \"That fellow must be dreaming if he believes I will help after threatening me earlier. You wish.\"The corners of Zhou Yuan's mouth twitched. To think that this little G.o.ddess would actually be so petty.By the side, Su Youwei covered her mouth, hiding her smile.Zhou Yuan sat himself beside Yaoyao, a pained look on his face as he said, \"I don't know anything about poison neutralizing Genesis Runes. In addition, the Devil Miasma Poison is a really th.o.r.n.y problem. How will I resolve this?\"Yaoyao replied in an offhand manner, \"I'll teach you.\"\"I can't draw grade 3 Genesis Runes.\" Zhou Yuan let out a bitter chuckle. The current level of his Spirit allowed him to at best draw grade 2 Genesis Runes. As for grade 3, it would have to wait till his Spirit reached the advanced Illusory stage.\"Who says you need to draw a grade 3 Genesis Rune?\" Yaoyao rolled her eyes at Zhou Yuan. \"That old man could only depend on a grade 3 Genesis Rune to suppress the Devil Miasma Poison because he is too useless.\"\"In the following ten days, I will teach you a grade 2 Genesis Rune known as the Thousand Poisons Erosion Rune and a grade 1 poison expelling rune. After which, it should not be difficult to neutralize the Devil Miasma Poison as long as you follow my instructions.\"Yaoyao took out a white piece of paper and wrote some things on it before pa.s.sing it to Zhou Yuan. \"Additionally, quickly prepare the ingredients written here.\"Zhou Yuan received the paper and took a quick glance. His expression immediately changed as he burst out, \"Big sis Yaoyao, isn't this too ruthless? All of these are poisonous blood from various Genesis Beasts. Are you trying to kill young master Wei?\"Every item written on the paper was poisonous in nature. This caused Zhou Yuan to wonder if Yaoyao was still mad at the Weis.Yaoyao unhappily retorted, \"Nonsense, these are all ingredients for the Thousand Poisons Erosion Rune. This is called fighting poison with poison!\"Zhou Yuan worriedly asked, \"Nothing will go wrong, right?\"Young master Wei was in terrible health. If Zhou Yuan caused the former's death by accident, he would never be able to wash away this sin.Wei Canglan may even go crazy and make Zhou Yuan accompany his son in death\u2026Yaoyao ignored him this time and turned around to continuing toying with Tuntun.Zhou Yuan could only force a smile as he handed the paper to Lu Tieshan. \"Prepare these items.\"Lu Tieshan's face also twitched when he saw the list. In the end, he did not say anything and proceeded to comply. But from the looks of it, it was clear that he had already begun to make preparations with regards to escaping.Zhou Yuan looked at Yaoyao again. \"Big sis Yaoyao, when shall we start the Thousand Poisons Erosion Rune lessons?\"Yaoyao stretched, displaying her amazing curves. She stood up with Tuntun in her arms and lazily said, \"Tomorrow. I'm too tired today.\"After speaking, she brought Su Youwei along into the inner courtyard.Zhou Yuan watched the two gorgeous figures leave as thoughts of the ruthless Thousand Poisons Erosion Rune swirled in his head. In the end, he could only shake his head with a sigh.\"What a petty big sis.\"\"My big sis Yaoyao is really something. She may not be full of vicious words, but one really cannot afford to offend her.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68 PreparationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the following ten days, all of Zhou Yuan's energy was invested into learning the Thousand Poisons Erosion Rune. After all, the method Yaoyao had chosen this time was a little on the fiercer side, and it was very likely that the sickly Wei Bin would die if even the slightest mishap occurred.Therefore, Zhou Yuan had no choice but to redouble his enthusiasm to ensure that he would not be killed by a Wei Canglan turned crazy due to the loss of his only son.Fortunately, his Genesis Rune talent was pretty good, plus his Spirit had reached the advance Illusory stage. Therefore, it was not too strenuous for him to learn a new grade 2 Genesis Rune.After about seven days, Zhou Yuan had managed to grasp the Thousand Poisons Erosion Rune. Next, he would have to practice.\u2026Great general's residence, the study.Wei Canglan raised his head, looking towards Wei Qingqing as he asked, \"What has prince Zhou Yuan been up to these past few days?\"Wei Qingqing hesitated for a while before answering, \"He seems to be practicing Genesis Runes.\"Since Zhou Yuan was staying in the great general's residence, every little thing he did was naturally easy to monitor.Wei Canglan's face twitched. Was this a hasty last-minute effort? What exactly was prince Zhou Yuan doing?\"Besides this\u2026 I have discovered that Lu Tieshan has recently bought several things in the city.\" Wei Qingqing hesitated somewhat, but eventually retrieved a piece of paper and handed it to Wei Canglan. Recorded on the paper were the poisonous ingredients Zhou Yuan had asked Lu Tieshan to purchase.Wei Canglan received the paper and took a look. His face soon began to twitch once again. If he was not certain of Zhou Yuan's ident.i.ty, he would suspect that Zhou Yuan had a secret motive.\"Father, are we really going to let prince Zhou Yuan treat little brother? Should we find someone else instead?\" Asked Wei Qingqing. Zhou Yuan's situation really made one apprehensive after all.Wei Canglan sighed. \"Have we not already spent so much time and effort searching? If the Black Venom King's Devil Miasma Poison was so easy to neutralize, he would not be reigning as a tyrant in Blackwater for so many years.\"\"Now\u2026 we can only place our trust in prince Zhou Yuan.\"Wei Canglan swept a glance in the direction of the guest courtyard as his eyes narrowed slightly. \"Moreover, this prince of ours is very intelligent. He should clearly understand what will happen if he thoughtlessly treats little Bin.\"Wei Qingqing nodded when she heard this. Zhou Yuan had been both earnest and serious back then, even stating all his conditions. He would not do dare to do so unless he had some confidence, else it would only be akin to humiliating himself.\"Then we'll wait during these final three days. I hope that he will be able to save little brother.\" Wei Qingqing sighed. Wei Bin's poison had already become a disease in the hearts of their Wei family. If this disease was not eliminated, the great general's residence will continue to be choked by its stifling atmosphere.Zhou Yuan had brought them a sliver of hope, but it was unknown whether this hope would turn into even greater despair.\u2026A certain large manor in the city.\"Hehe, Zhou Yuan's self-confidence is really something. To have even stated all of his conditions already.\" In the room, Wei Ting stood before a stormy-face Qi Hao.It was evident that he had obtained news of Zhou Yuan's current situation in the great general's residence from her.Wei Ting remarked in disdain, \"That kid is very arrogant indeed. Even the master Ying you invited was unable to neutralize the Devil Miasma Poison, what does someone like him think he can do?\"\"Is there any other news?\" Asked Qi Hao.Wei Ting beamed as she pressed against Qi Hao, while the latter reached out an arm and wrapped it around her slender waist. Subsequently, Wei Ting fished out a piece of paper from her sleeve. \"This is a list of things Lu Tieshan recently bought in the city.\"Qi Hao received the paper and took a look. His brows immediately furrowed. \"All of these items are poisonous. Just what exactly are they up to?\"He pondered for a moment, but did not arrive at any answer. Thus, he could only coldly chuckle and say, \"Let them do what they want, we'll see whether Wei Canglan will go mad if Wei Bin ends up dead due to their shenanigans.\"He too did not believe that Zhou Yuan had the ability to neutralize the Devil Miasma Poison.Qi Hao said, \"Tingting, help me keep a good eye on Zhou Yuan in the great general's residence and inform me at once if anything occurs. In addition, if he makes any mistakes, find a chance to secretly fan the flames and thoroughly anger Wei Canglan. We cannot allow Zhou Yuan to leave the great general's residence alive.\"\"Besides all this, Wei Qingqing will definitely be heartbroken if Wei Bin dies at Zhou Yuan's hands. When that happens, ask her out for me. Her guard will be greatly lowered and it will be the best time for me to take advantage.\"Wei Ting's pouted upon hearing this. \"You want me to help you obtain another woman?\"Qi Hao smiled slightly as he explained, \"Tingting, you will need my father's consent to mary into Qi Manor. As long as you are able to help me obtain Wei Qingqing, I will be able to dabble my hand in the pie that is the Canglan army. Our success will be a huge contribution to Qi Manor and my father will surely allow me to marry you.\"Even after a year in the Canglan army, he had ultimately been unable to enter the inner circle. He knew that Wei Canglan was wary of him, thus, the only way for him to obtain the Canglan army was by first getting to Wei Qingqing.This woman was had a strong influence in the Canglan army.Wei Ting foolishly asked, \"Really?\"Qi Hao nodded with a smile.Wei Ting bit her red lips. Soon after, she forcefully nodded and said, \"Alright, I will do all I can to help you!\"The two continued to cuddle for a while, before a satisfied Wei Ting left.The smile on Qi Hao's face turned cold as he watched her leaving figure. Subsequently, he somewhat irritatedly tugged at this clothes and said in a dull voice, \"What a delusional woman.\"A figure walked out from the screen behind him. It was the housekeeper of Qi Manor, Qi Ling.Qi Ling said with a frown, \"First young master, what exactly is Zhou Yuan up to? Could he really be able to cure Wei Bin?\"Qi Hao immediately let out a icy laugh upon hearing this and answered, \"A brat like him? In his dreams.\"Just how many years had Wei Canglan struggled with the Devil Miasma Poison? It was not as if he had not seeked the help of various experts and masters. However, all of them were ultimately powerless. All of these facts made Qi Hao greatly doubt that a mere Zhou Yuan, who had not even stepped into the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage, would be able to do what everyone else had failed to.\"Although I do not believe that brat will succeed, we should still plan for the worst.\" Iciness flickered within Qi Hao's eyes.If Zhou Yuan somehow miraculously succeeded like a blind cat b.u.mping into a mouse, Wei Canglan would inevitable chose to help the former obtain the Fire Spirit Grain.Qi Hao raised his head, killing intent surging in his eyes as he looked towards the great general's residence.\"Wei Canglan ah Wei Canglan. If you really decide to help Zhou Yuan, I will have no option but to think of a way to get rid of you. Don't worry, I will make sure to take good care of your daughter and the Canglan army after you are gone.\"\u2026Under the watch of various parties, the final three days unhurriedly pa.s.sed by.In the courtyard, Zhou Yuan was busy keeping his things. He could not help but roll his eyes as he shot a glance at the grim-faced Lu Tieshan, before he beckoned to Yaoyao and Su Youwei with his chin.\"Let's go. Today will determine whether we live or die!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69 Revelation of SkillPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA particular room located in the rear courtyard of the great general's residence.When Zhou Yuan and the rest arrived, Wei Canglan and Wei Qingqing were already waiting. The two swiftly walked forward to welcome Zhou Yuan upon seeing him.Wei Canglan then proceeded to ask with a smile, \"Your highness, will you be starting the treatment today?\"Zhou Yuan returned the smile and nodded. Without further ado, he walked into the house and arrived in front of the bed where Wei Bin was currently lying. His complexion looked much better than before, but Zhou Yuan knew that it was only because master Ying had forcibly suppressed the Devil Miasma Poison in Wei Bin's body. When the poison erupted once again, it would instantly take his life.Zhou Yuan reached out and lightly tapped the black Universe bag at this waist. Before they left Great Zhou City, Zhou Qing had retrieved a Universe bag from the royal treasury and given it to Zhou Yuan. Although its grade was not very high, and the rather tiny s.p.a.ce within only extended to a few feet, it was still very convenient.Several bottles appeared in Zhou Yuan's hand. Next, he retrieved a plate and very carefully dripped the liquid contents of the bottles onto it, beginning a process of modulation.An appalling stench spread the moment the liquids emerged. A single whiff would cause one to feel giddy, clearly showing just how toxic the liquids were.Although Wei Canglan and Wei Qingqing had antic.i.p.ated this, their expressions still changed.Wei Qingqing bit her red lips and asked, \"Your highness, what do you plan on doing?\"Zhou Yuan grinned. \"The Devil Miasma Poison is extremely domineering. The only way to neutralize it is to find a master that can draw a grade 4 poison neutralizing Genesis Rune. However, I'm afraid that such masters are extremely rare in our Great Zhou Empire.\"\"Hence, I will have to use another method.\"He paused at this point before continuing, \"Poison against poison.\"\"As for the details, you two will have a first hand view later on. Please do not worry great general, I understand the consequences of this matter and would not have selected such a foolhardy method if I did not have any confidence.\"Zhou Yuan's voice was indifferent as he gazed straight at Wei Canglan.Wei Canglan took one deep look at Zhou Yuan as he slowly said, \"Since your highness is confident, do what you must. If your highness is truly able to cure my son, my Wei family will owe you a huge debt of grat.i.tude.\"Zhou Yuan smiled, but did not speak any further and instead continued to adjust the vicious poisons. A long while later, he finally stopped when the horrifying smell reached its peak.He unhooked the Heavenly Yuan Brush from his waist, and dabbed the brush tip on the poison concoction. After which, his expression grew serious as he took in a deep breath, before the brush tip slowly descended.Yaoyao was already standing slightly behind Zhou Yuan. If anything unexpected happened, she would have to personally take action to save the situation.Shch!The brush that had been smeared in poison landed on Wei Bin's skin, causing 'shch' sound to be emitted as black strokes began to appear.Zhou Yuan's wrist twisted and turned, the brush tip never stopping like flowing water and moving clouds, as stroke after stroke swiftly emerged.Wei Canglan and Wei Qingqing began to frown as they stared at the strokes Zhou Yuan had drawn. Although they did not have in-depth knowledge of Genesis Runes, they were still able to tell that the rune Zhou Yuan was currently drawing was a grade 1 Genesis Rune.A grade 1 Genesis Rune was practically useless against the Devil Miasma Poison.Although their hearts were filled with doubt, it was not a good time for them to speak up as it would disturb Zhou Yuan. Hence, the two could only continue to watch in silence.Zhou Yuan's full attention was on his work, ignoring everyone else's gazes. After completing the grade 1 Genesis Rune, his brush once again descended and another grade 1 Genesis Rune began to emerge\u2026In the subsequent hour, Zhou Yuan drew a total of eight grade 1 Genesis Runes.\"These eight grade 1 Genesis Runes\u2026 seem to have nicely surrounded the spot three inches above Wei Bin's tail bone.\" Wei Canglan's eyes flashed when he finally made this discovery. The grade 1 Genesis Runes Zhou Yuan had inscribed were similar to a troop encirclement, tightly sealing off all escapes routes of the Devil Miasma Poison hidden in Wei Bin's spine area.Zhou Yuan exhaled, his forehead now dotted with some perspiration after drawing eight grade 1 Genesis Runes in succession. He closed his eyes and rested a little before beginning once again.This time, his expression was much more serious than before. The rune he was about to draw was the grade 2 Thousand Poisons Erosion Rune he had recently learnt. What's more, it was key with regards to dealing with the Devil Miasma Poison.Zhou Yuan gathered his concentration for a moment, before his brush abruptly descended. His Spirit flickered between his brows as it seemed to fuse together with the Heavenly Yuan Brush in his hand.Shsch shsch!Pitch-black stroke after stroke appeared, perfectly joined together. Subsequently, Wei Canglan and Wei Qingqing watched in astonishment as a complicated and mysterious Genesis Rune slowly emerged.\"A grade 2 Genesis Rune.\" Wei Canglan and Wei Qingqing exchanged a look, both could sense something extraordinary about this grade 2 Genesis Rune.The tip of Zhou Yuan's brush finally stopped, and he let out a sigh of relief as if a huge burden had been lifted from his shoulders as he gazed at the completed Genesis Rune. The Thousand Poisons Erosion Rune had been successfully completed.\"The most important step comes next.\" Wei Canglan's and Wei Qingqing's hearts shook when they heard Zhou Yuan's following words.The Heavenly Yuan Brush in Zhou Yuan's hand gently dotted on the most inner grade 1 Genesis Rune. A gentle glow immediately rose from it as it began to slowly squirming like an eight-claw snake sending out a taunt.As the grade 1 Genesis Rune twisted and taunted, Wei Bin suddenly cried out in pain. Everyone watched in horror as the skin on his spine area suddenly began to turn black as the night.The black patch began to spread like ink, pouncing directly at the surrounding grade 1 Genesis Rune.When the Devil Miasma Poison ferociously surged over, the grade 1 Genesis Rune suddenly dispersed as if an entire battalion had turned into smoke. This caused the surging Devil Miasma Poison to charge into the layers of Grade 1 Genesis Runes that had surrounded it.All of the grade 1 Genesis Runes activated at this moment. As they rotated, the Devil Miasma Poison was sliced into various chunks.Each chunk of poisonous Qi blackened patches of Wei Bin's skin, a rather ghastly sight.Zhou Yuan's expression did not change as the Heavenly Yuan Brush dotted once again. One of the separated pieces of Devil Miasma Poison charged out of the encirclement, arriving in front of the Thousand Poisons Erosion Rune.The Thousand Poisons Erosion Rune also contained a powerful poison. Hence, when the two poisons b.u.mped into each other, it was akin to the meeting of two ferocious tigers in the mountainous woods, no words were spoken and the fight immediately began.The Devil Miasma Poison transformed into a black mist as it surged towards the Thousand Poisons Erosion Rune. The latter seemed to joyfully respond without any fear, the rune squirming like a gigantic mouth. It allowed the Devil Miasma Poison to flow in and thoroughly devoured it.After swallowing the Devil Miasma Poison, the rune slowly rotated as a strange black light flickered on it. Moments later, the light dimmed as everyone saw a sliver of black poison mist rise from Wei Bin's skin.This sliver of poison mist gave off a nauseating miasma-like stench.However, Wei Canglan and Wei Qingqing could not help but glow with joy when they saw the poison mist. It was very familiar to them, this poison mist was the Devil Miasma Poison!In other words, the Devil Miasma Poison in Wei Bin's body had been neutralized!\"It's still not finished. This is only the beginning.\"Zhou Yaun reminded them because another piece of the Devil Miasma Poison had rushed towards the Thousand Poisons Erosion Rune.Wei Canglan's eyes s.h.i.+ned and could not help but praise out loud, \"Impressive, truly impressive!\"Wei Qingqing was somewhat puzzled. \"How is this grade 2 Genesis Rune of his able to neutralize the Devil Miasma Poison?\"Wei Canglan's eyes were filled with admiration as he explained, \"That is the amazing part about his highness' method. It's similar to a war strategy. First, one of the grade 1 Genesis Runes acts as the bait, drawing out the Devil Miasma Poison. Next, the seven grade 1 Genesis Runes slice up the Devil Miasma Poison, continuously weakening it before sending each piece to the waiting grade 2 Genesis Rune.\"\"The grade 2 Genesis Rune contains a powerful poison. Poison against poison, poison to neutralize poison. Each piece of Devil Miasma Poison that comes ends up thoroughly neutralized.\"\"If this continues, the Devil Miasma Poison in Wei Bin's body will finally be fully neutralized!\"\"Amazing! Truly amazing!\" Wei Canglan stared at Zhou Yan as if he was a treasure. Zhou Yuan's method may not look as impactful as when master Ying showed his grade 3 Genesis Rune, but with the teamwork of many grade 1 Genesis Runes and a grade 2 Genesis Rune, the Devil Miasma Poison could only dance on the palm of his hand.Even an Alpha-Origin stage expert like Wei Canglan was awed by such Genesis Rune mastery and finesse.By the side, Wei Qingqing was also inwardly shocked after hearing her father's explanation. It was obvious that she had not expected that Zhou Yuan would be achieve such a feat.\"Looks like little brother will be saved!\"Wei Qingqing was overwhelmed by emotion, her white teeth biting into her red lips as her eyes turned slightly red. An extraordinary splendor appeared in her eyes as she looked towards the bedside where the handsome youth was seated.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead, only joy could be seen on their faces.It was because this meant that more and more of the Devil Miasma Poison was being neutralized.Wei Canglan's eyes were filled with emotion as he looked at Wei Bin's waist area, where the patch of pitch-black had already receded substantially, the black from before not as deep as it had been.By the side, Wei Qingqing tightly clenched her fists. It was hard for her to control her overflowing emotions.Although they were both a little overwhelmed, they did not make any noise that would disturb Zhou Yuan. The latter currently wore a solemn look on his face, while perspiration dotted his entire forehead.The Heavenly Yuan Brush in his hand continued to descend, patching the parts of the Genesis Runes that had faded due to the repet.i.tive attacks of the Devil Miasma Poison.In fact, several places had even been broken.Thus, Zhou Yuan needed to continuously do repairs to maintain the formation. If not, it would become much more difficult to encircle and draw out the Devil Miasma Poison again if it were allowed to break out.Light flickered between Zhou Yuan's brow, a sign that his Spirit was being pushed to its limit.Controlling a formation of eight grade 1 Genesis Runes and a grade 2 Genesis Rune was pretty exhausting even for someone like Zhou Yuan whose Spirit was at the mid Illusory stage. The only thing he could do was tough it out, clench his teeth and endure.Sweat fell dripped from his forehead into his eyes, causing a p.r.i.c.kling pain.Suddenly, a faint fragrance drifted over as a fair hand reached out with a handkerchief, wiping away the sweat on Zhou Yuan's head.Zhou Yuan's eyes turned and was somewhat shocked to see that the owner of the handkerchief was Wei Qingqing.Upon sensing Zhou Yuan's gaze, Wei Qingqing pursed her lips into a slight smile.Zhou Yuan nodded, indicating his grat.i.tude, before casting his attention back to the Genesis Runes.Time slowly flowed and noon unknowingly arrived.Only a half-fist sized patch of pitch-black Devil Miasma Poison was left at Wei Bin's lower backbone area. In addition, it had also become less concentrated. From the looks of it, full neutralization was not far off.However, just as everyone breathed a sigh of relief, the lump of Devil Miasma Poison suddenly began to squirm, suddenly splitting up and charging in all directions as if it had gone mad.\"Oh no! The Devil Miasma Poison wants to escape. It intends to hide in the depths of little Bin's body!\" Wei Canglan's expression changed slightly. The Devil Miasma Poison was troublesome indeed, it had instinctively began to search for somewhere to hide the moment it sensed its life was threatened. It will be very dangerous if it was allowed to conceal itself again.Zhou Yuan calmly said, \"Relax, it will not be able to escape.\"After which, with a dot of the Heaven Yuan Brush, the layers of Genesis Runes suddenly began to swell, cutting off all routes of escape. At the same time, the Thousand Poisons Erosion Rune that was originally outside the encirclement also slipped in and began to counter-attack.Blobs of Devil Miasma Poison dashed in all directions, but it was completely useless. Every one was eventually swallowed by the Thousand Poisons Erosion Rune, transforming into wisps of black smoke that rose into the air.After dozens of minutes, the final piece of Devil Miasma Poison was purged and the entire room lapse into silence.Phew.Zhou Yuan breathed out heavily as if a great burden had been lifted from his shoulders. Just as he desired to stand up, a wave of dizziness washed over his head, causing him to stumble backwards.Thud!However, his body did not fall to the ground. Instead, he crashed into something fragrant, warm and soft. This caused him to be stunned, his eyes quickly turning as the sight of a beast baring its fangs appeared before him.Tuntun was snarling at him.He raised his head, only to find Yaoyao's distant eyes staring at him.Yaoyao's red lips parted slightly and she said, \"If you don't get up, I will let Tuntun swallow you whole.\"Tuntun grinned, showing its teeth to Zhou Yuan.Zhou Yuan's body instantly straightened, standing up while secretly cursing the insatiable little beast in his heart. All of the dried Genesis Beast meat he had fed it had truly been wasted.Zhou Yuan ma.s.saged his forehead as he smiled at the still silent Wei Canglan and Wei Qingqing, \"Great general, I have by some chance not humiliated myself and managed to complete the task.\"\"*Sniffle*, little brother!\" Wei Qingqing was the first to regain her senses. She immediately pounced over and hugged the young boy as she cried.The only son of their Wei family had at long last been saved.Wei Canglan's somewhat trembling hands wiped at his eyes, before he turned towards Zhou Yuan and bowed deeply.Zhou Yuan hurriedly pulled the great general up as he said, \"Please rise great general, I cannot accept such a grand gesture.\"\"Your highness, there is not much to say. My family will remember this debt.\" Wei Canglan's voice was a little soft.By the side, Lu Tieshan, whose entire body had been tense while he stared at Wei Canglan from start to end, inwardly sighed in relief. Thankfully, his highness had succeeded.Zhou Yuan smiled and said, \"Each of us did what we had to for what we needed. There is no need for great general to go so far.\"Wei Canglan waved his hand. A servant girl brought over a small jade box which he took and personally pa.s.sed to Zhou Yuan. \"The Genesis Swallowing Rock is inside.\"Excitement rose in Zhou Yuan's heart when he heard this. He very carefully received the small jade box and opened it. A palm-sized dusty-yellow rock lay within it. There were two holes on the rock, a big one and a small one. A suction force spread from the small hole, absorbing the surrounding Genesis Qi while Genesis Qi poured out from the big hole. He could feel that the Genesis Qi that exited the big hole was purer than normal.This was indeed a Genesis Swallowing Rock!Joy emerged in Zhou Yuan's eyes as he kept the box in his Universe bag. The Genesis Swallowing Rock was his at last. Now, he only needed to obtain the grade 4 python-type Genesis Beast spirit and all the ingredients for him to learn the first level of the Ancestral Dragon Scripture would be gathered.This transaction was not a loss for him at all.Wei Canglan solemnly said, \"Your highness, I will discuss with you in detail with regards to the ruins in Blackwater later on. Don't worry, since I've agreed to your conditions, I will definitely do all I can to help!\"\"Then I'll have to give my thanks to great general.\" Zhou Yuan was elated. With Wei Canglan's promise, he now had some guarantee of sorts in the battle of the ruins. After all, the great general's faction was one of the two strongest powers in the area.Zhou Yuan and the rest understood that the Wei family was currently in a celebratory mood, thus and did not plan on disturbing. Hence, they bid their goodbyes, giving the family some time for themselves.\u2026\"Zhou Yuan cured Wei Bin?! How is that possible?\" In a certain manor, Qi Hao abruptly stood up, his face full of disbelief.By the side, Qi Ling also had an expression of shock.Wei Ting smiled bitterly as she nodded. Although she too felt that it was unbelievable, it was indeed the truth.Qi Hao's face was white with anger, cracking sounds emitting from his tightly clenched fist as he howled in a low voice, \"Zhou Yuan, you dare to spoil my plans!\"Now that this had happened, the entire year of effort he had invested in Canglan County had basically been wasted.Qi Hao's eyes turned as dark as a storm as he said, \"If Zhou Yuan has really cured Wei Bin, given Wei Canglan's character, he will very likely do all he can to aid Zhou Yuan in obtaining the treasures in the ruins.\"\"First young master, we cannot linger any longer in Canglan County or we will surely fall under Wei Canglan's surveillance.\"Qi Hao gnashed his teeth, eyes filled with iciness, his face sinister as he cursed, \"Wei Canglan, since you wish to seek death, I will grant your wis.h.!.+\"After cursing in a low voice, he decisively said, \"Go, we'll leave Canglan County. Qi Manor must obtain the Fire Spirit Grain. If Wei Canglan dares to help Zhou Yuan vie with us, I will let him know that he is not as important as he thinks in the eyes of Qi Manor!\"As he walked out of the door, a dark gaze shot towards the general's residence while his five fingers clenched into a fist.\"Zhou Yuan, do not think that you have won because Wei Canglan is now aiding you. If you dare to enter Blackwater, I will ensure you that you do not return!\"\"Qi Manor has already decided that the Fire Spirit Grain will be ours. If you dare to have any designs on it, Blackwater will be your grave!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Both of their faces were currently filled with joy, and the worry that had long entrenched itself between their brows had already completely faded.Evidently, Wei Canglan had very carefully searched Wei Bin's body after Zhou Yuan and the rest had left. After sensing the growing life force within Wei Bin's body, they were finally certain that the Devil Miasma Poison had been completely neutralized.The worry that had hovered over the great general's residence for several years had finally been dispersed.When Zhou Yuan and his group entered the main room, Wei Canglan and Wei Qingqing hastily rose and cupped their fists together, \"The Wei family will never forget your highness kindness!\"Zhou Yuan chuckled as he shot a glance at Yaoyao beside him. Truthfully speaking, he would not have been able to neutralize the Devil Miasma Poison without her guidance.Hence, Zhou Yuan was now even more in admiration of Yaoyao's attainments in Genesis Runes. The method of utilising eight grade 1 Genesis Runes and a grade 2 Genesis Rune in unison was no less effective than a true grade 3 Genesis Rune.\"Please sit your highness. I understand that your goal for coming to Canglan County is the ruins in Blackwater, right?\" Wei Canglan smiled.Zhou Yuan nodded, his expression solemn as he replied, \"The Fire Spirit Grain is of paramount importance to Great Zhou and we have to obtain it. Or else, it will become an extremely huge threat if it falls into anyone else's hands.\"He stared at Wei Canglan as he spoke. A grade 4 Genesis Food like the Fire Spirit Grain was just too great of a strategic resource. Hence, Zhou Yuan could not be sure if Wei Canglan harbored any thoughts about it.After all, Wei Canglan's faction would be able to rapidly grow if he were to obtain it.Wei Canglan cast a glance at Zhou Yuan. An experienced and shrewd man like him was naturally able to decipherl the meaning behind Zhou Yuan's gaze. With a soft laugh, Wei Canglan said, \"Don't worry your highness, I do not have much ambitions and only want to safeguard the peace of my family.\"Zhou Yuan answered, \"I hope that you are not overly offended by my suspicions with regards your intentions.\"Although he uttered these words, his expression did not change. It was after all necessary to probe Wei Canglan's intentions.Wei Canglan waved his hand, indicating that he did not mind. \"Since your highness is here for the treasures within the ruins, do you know of the details concerning it?\"Zhou Yuan shook his head. His knowledge was very limited due to being pressed for time. Thus, he had planned on collecting information after arriving at Canglan County.Wei Canglan slowly said, \"Blackwater is extremely vast and to be honest, the Blackwater we currently know of is only the outer area. It is said that countless powerful Genesis Beasts occupy the deepest areas and even grade 4 Genesis Beasts are a common sight there.\"\"Long long ago, many powerful factions existed in Blackwater, but they gradually disappeared as time pa.s.sed. As such, Blackwater slowly became the deserted forbidden danger zone it is today.\"\"From the information we have gathered, the ruins that have appeared this time are likely left behind by a faction that once existed in Blackwater, an ancient faction known as the Battle Puppet Sect.\"\"Battle Puppet Sect?\" Surprise colored Zhou Yuan's face. It was evident that he never imagined that the ruins would have such an origin.\"It is rumored that this ancient faction specialized in creating extremely powerful battle puppets. Therefore, there will likely be various kinds of battle puppets in the ruins, making it very dangerous.\" Wei Canglan's expression was grave as he continued, \"The biggest problem however is the presence of an extremely formidable battle puppet, a giant python battle puppet that uses a grade 4 python-type Genesis Beast spirit as its core. It will be very difficult for even an Alpha-Origin stage expert to face it.\"At this point, Zhou Yuan's expression suddenly changed as he interjected, \"Grade 4 python-type Genesis Beast spirit?\"Wei Canglan nodded.\"Never imagined that I would encounter a grade 4 python-type Genesis Beast Spirit here.\" Zhou Yuan was pleasantly surprised, but soon after, he let out a bitter laugh. To obtain the beast spirit, he would have to first eliminate the battle puppet that comparable to an Alpha-Origin stage expert.For someone like himself, it was a task as difficult as ascending the heavens.\"What a headache.\" Zhou Yuan shook his head. It seems that learning the first level Omni Python Qi was truly an uphill task.\"Also\u2026 besides the dangers of the ruins, there are other things that must not be overlooked.\" Wei Canglan's voice was a little heavy.Zhou Yuan asked, \"Is great general referring to the factions in Blackwater?\"\"All of the Blackwater factions are nothing to worry, with one single exception, which is also our most formidable foe!\" At this point, cold light flashed in Wei Canglan's eyes.\"The Black Venom King.\" Zhou Yuan's eyes also became grave.Wei Canglan slowly nodded. \"The Black Venom King has reigned like a tyrant in Blackwater for many years and Black Venom City is currently the strongest faction in Blackwater. Someone as ambitious as the Black Venom King definitely will not miss out on the Fire Spirit Grain.\"Zhou Yuan nodded. He clearly understood the strategic value the Fire Spirit Grain had to any faction. The Black Venom King would never give up on such an item as long as there was even a tiny trace of ambition in his heart.Therefore, it was a must to guard against the Black Venom King.\"There is one other factions besides the Black Venom King\u2026\" Zhou Yuan paused.Wei Canglan shot a look at Zhou Yuan and nodded in agreement. \"Indeed, Qi Manor has been watching the situation like a tiger, but king Qi is likewise being kept in check by Zhou Qing in Great Zhou City, making it impossible for him to rush over. It will be difficult for Qi Hao to stir up anything alone.\"Zhou Yuan softly said, \"It will still be best to be a little cautious.\"Wei Canglan fell into thought for a moment before beckoning to a guard with a wave of his hand. \"Send some soldiers to the manor Qi Hao is staying at and blockade it off. No one will be allowed to leave.\"The guard hesitated for a moment upon hearing this before replying in a low voice, \"Great general, there is something I have to report beforehand. Qi Hao has already left the city with his men two hours ago. We do not know where he has went.\"Wei Canglan frowned. \"This brat is a sharp one, to think that he escaped so quickly.\"Zhou Yuan was likewise a little amazed by how fast Qi Hao had ran, however, there was nothing they could do now that he was gone. At very least, he had gained the upper hand in their previous clash and won the aid of the powerful Wei Canglan.Zhou Yuan asked, \"General Wei, when shall we set off?\"Wei Canglan answered, \"The various factions are currently mobilizing their manpower, however, the ruins are layered with danger and an army loses its effectiveness there. Hence, we should send a group of elites.\"Zhou Yuan nodded in agreement. The Canglan army would not be very useful in such a place even if they managed to squeeze all of them in. In fact, it would probably increase the number of casualties instead.Wei Canglan smiled and declared, \"I will personally be leading a group this time. There are eight Heaven Gate stage experts in the Canglan army. Three will be left to defend the city, while the other five will follow me into the ruins. In addition, there will also be an elite squad of Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng experts joining us. We will set out in five days and head into Blackwater.\"This group was practically the strongest force the Canglan army had to offer. Wei Canglan was clearly a man of his word. Since he had promised to help Zhou Yuan, he would naturally do everything he could.An understanding Zhou Yuan immediately cupped his fists and thanked, \"Then I'll have to give my thanks to the great general.\"Zhou Yuan and his group left after discussing some other details.Wei Canglan leaned against his seat, watching Zhou Yuan's leaving figure as he lightly tapped the tabletop and sighed, \"I never imagined that the frail little boy from so many years ago would grow into such a promising young man. His majesty is truly fortunate.\"By the side, Wei Qingqing gave a slight nod as she said, \"His talent in Genesis Runes is indeed amazing, however, his strength is still a little lacking. He hasn't even reached the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage.\"Wei Canglan could not help but chuckle. \"You would not say such a thing if you knew that he was not even able to find his eight meridian channels half a year ago, making him incapable to beginning channel opening cultivation.\"\"Half a year ago?\" Wei Qingqing was stunned. She seemed to vaguely recall that Zhou Yuan had been unable to locate his meridian channels in the past, but she never knew that his rise had happened over such a short period.After all, even she had spent two years to reach the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage. On the other hand, Zhou Yuan would likely unblock his eighth meridian channel in less than a month.Wei Canglan sighed softly, pity in his eyes as he gazed at Zhou Yuan's leaving figure.\"It's such a pity. Our prince originally possessed the sacred dragon blessings. If not for Great Wu's python and sparrow stealing his blessings, who knows what kind achievements his highness would have attained by now.\"\"In all likelihood, even I would not dare to b.u.t.t heads with him and can only choose to yield.\"Wei Qingqing's face changed slightly when she heard the respected Wei Canglan speak such words. She raised her head, looking in the direction that Zhou Yuan had left in as she gently bit her red lips, admiration rippling in her eyes.The young prince whom she had first viewed to be a player was obviously not as simple as she had thought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72 Black Venom KingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn a certain serene courtyard.Su Youwei was silently seated on a boulder. Her back was straight, the curves on her chest faintly visible, while her supple and slender waist really made one have to impulse to hook an arm around it.Genesis Qi flowed around her body, thread after thread converging towards her from the surroundings and ultimately pouring into her body.Meanwhile, the faint rumble of thunder seemed to echo from within her body.Su Youwei suddenly opened her clear as water eyes and a flash of scarlet-red lightning seemed to flit across them. In the next instant, she reached out a hand and gently grasped.Rumble!Scarlet-red Genesis Qi rose from her right hand. It seemed as if lightning was dancing and fire burning inside as a domineering aura spread.She extended her left hand and ice-blue Genesis Qi rose from it. This Genesis Qi gave off an extremely cold aura, freezing even the air itself as it ascended towards the sky.Grade 4 Genesis Qi, Flame-Thunder Qi!Grade 4 Genesis Qi, Niflheim Qi!The Flame-Thunder mantra and the Niflheim sutra had finally been simultaneously mastered by Su Youwei.Su Youwei's bright eyes were filled with joy, emotion skipping across her face as she observed the two different attribute Genesis Qi surging on her hands. She could clearly feel that her strength had rose sharply after mastering these two types of Genesis Qi.Although she had previously reached the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage, the Genesis Qi in her body had remained at the most basic attributeless state because she had not learnt any Qi cultivation methods. This naturally meant that her attacks did not have any special effects and was much weaker than others.*Clap clap!*While Su Youwei was happily watching the two types of Genesis Qi, applause was suddenly heard. She lifted her head to look and found Zhou Yuan standing nearby, a huge grin on his face as he clapped.\"Your highness.\" Su Youwei revealed a faint smile.\"Congratulations. Now that you've mastered these divine techniques, unifying the world is just around the corner!\" Zhou Yuan teased.Su Youwei's gaze were somewhat charming as she rolled her eyes at him. She then raised her hand and let out a soft snort. \"Want to test its power?\"Zhou Yuan's smile twisted awkwardly. Su Youwei's battle power had undoubtedly soared after successfully learning the two grade 4 Genesis Qi. She may only be at the initial Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage, but in a real fight, it was likely that even an advance Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage expert would find it difficult to beat her.After all, wielding two types of Genesis Qi was enough to give her opponents a huge headache.Zhou Yuan was confident that he was not weaker than the Su Youwei when she had initially stepped into the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage. But now, it was likely that he was no longer Su Youwei's match. He would have to reach the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage and borrow the powers of Genesis Runes to have any chance of matching the current Su Youwei.Of course, that was under the precondition that he had not learnt the first level of the Ancestral Dragon Scripture and obtained the Omni Python Qi.\"The Ancestral Dragon Scripture is really difficult.\" As these thoughts churned his head, Zhou Yuan involuntarily let out a sigh. In Su Youwei's case, although many Genesis resources were needed to learn the Flame-Thunder mantra and the Niflheim sutra, these resources could be bought with Genesis crystals. This was how Su Youwei was able to successfully master them with her talent in about ten days.In contrast, he had yet to even gather the Genesis resources he needed, a comparison that really made him want to cry.Fortunately, his eighth meridian channel was growing increasingly loose due to his efforts. It would not be long before it was completely unblocked.\"Let's go, we will be heading to Blackwater today.\" Zhou Yuan withdrew his frustrations and smiled towards Su Youwei.Su Youwei gave a small nod in response and followed Zhou Yuan out of the general's residence after tidying up a little.Wei Canglan was already waiting outside the residence. Beside him was a slender and elegant figure clothed in red soft-armor, battle skirt and battle boots, Wei Qingqing.Her slightly high battle boots really emphasized those unreasonable pair of fair, long and slender legs. Even Zhou Yuan could not help but cast them a second glance.Wei Qingqing might not be able to match Su Youwei's and Yaoyao's peerless looks, but her impressive long legs were a huge boost to her points and made one unable to forget them.Behind Wei Canglan and Wei Qingqing were five figures. Powerful Genesis Qi surged around them, evidence that they were experts of the Heaven Gate stage.Even further behind was a squad of roughly a dozen elites. Every single one of them had the strength of the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage.This group was probably the most powerful force in Canglan County.Beside Wei Canglan's group was the squad from the imperial guards. Lu Tieshan led the group of three Heaven Gate stage experts and twelve Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage pract.i.tioners.The combination of both line-ups was pretty grand indeed.\"Are you ready your highness?\" Wei Canglan smiled upon seeing Zhou Yuan emerge.Zhou Yuan nodded.Wei Canglan was a swift and decisive individual. With a wave of his hand, he yelled, \"Then let us set off.\"As his shout rang out, the two groups began to move. They surged out of the city like a flood, speeding towards Blackwater.\u2026Blackwater, Black Venom City, residence of the city lord.A familiar figure was seated in the guest room. It was Qi Hao, who had slipped away from Canglan County some time ago.\"Oh? Qi Manor wants to cooperate with me?\"A raspy voice echoed in the guest room. If one turned to look, one would find a middle-aged man dressed in a black robe wearing a superficial smile on his face. His nose was sharp and black specks dotted his face. Wisps of black Qi rose around him, spreading a faint stench.This middle-aged man in black robes was the infamous lord of Black Venom City, the Black Venm King!Facing the infamous Black Venom King caused cold sweat to emerge on Qi Hao's forehead. However, he was able to maintain his bearings as he nodded and cupped his fists together. \"With regards to the ruins that have appeared in Blackwater this time, the Great Zhou royal clan and Wei Canglan have already joined forces. Although Black Venom City can be said to be the overlord of Blackwater, as the saying goes, a single tree cannot support an entire forest. If you cooperate with Qi Manor, we will definitely be able to cause them heavy losses.\"\"I do not fear Wei Canglan.\" The Black Venom King chuckled, his expression eerie as he stared at Qi Hao. \"Moreover, do you really believe I do not know that Zhou Qing has not come. Without another Alpha-Origina stage expert like him, Wei Canglan will not be able to handle me.\"\"Therefore, I conclude that you've come with the hopes of borrowing my power to deal with Wei Canglan.\"\"Since that is so, show me your sincerity, or else\u2026\"The rising black Qi around the Black Venom King caused Qi Hao to freeze for a second. Soon after, he said in a low voice, \"Black Venom King should know that Wei Canglan views you as a giant thorn in his side and seeks to eliminate you at all times.\"\"I believe that you too wish to eliminate this huge danger, am I right?\"The Black Venom King's eyes narrowed slightly. Wei Canglan had stationed himself in Canglan County, carefully observing every single movement from Black Venom City. The moment they made a move, Wei Canglan would immediately react and stop them, causing numerous problems for the Black Venom King over the past few years. Hence, the Black Venom King similarly viewed Wei Canglan as a huge problem that needed to be solved.\"As long as Black Venom King helps Qi Manor obtain the Fire Spirit Grain, when we finally overthrow the royal clan, Canglan County will belong to Black Venom City.\"\"Oh?\" The Black Venom King raised an eyebrow. \"So certain that you will be able to overthrow the royal clan?\"Qi Hao laughed coldly. \"Qi Manor has the backing of the Great Wu Empire. Does Black Venom King believe that a pitifully struggling Great Zhou royal clan will be able to match the Great Wu Empire?\"The Black Venom King was silent for some time, before he slowly said, \"A treasure like the Fire Spirit Grain is very valuable to Black Venom City.\"Qi Hao flatly replied, \"But Black Venom City will not be able to obtain it. If you do, Qi Manor will not let this matter rest, nor will the Great Wu Empire behind us allow it.\"The Black Venom King snorted disdainfully when he heard the front half of Qi Hao's words, but the former's expression changed upon hearing Great Wu Empire as fear flitted across his eyes.After all, the current Grea Wu Empire was nothing like Great Zhou. Great Wu was a flouris.h.i.+ng nation that had numerous experts, an existence that greatly exceeded his Black Venom City. If they offended Great Wu, he, the Black Venom King, would end up a stray dog.What the Black Venom King did not know however, was that Great Wu was currently warring against two other empires, and did not have any attention to spare to a remote place such as Blackwater.The Black Venom King's eyes flickered with thought. A long while later, he slowly said, \"I can cooperate with you.\"Joy immediately lit up Qi Hao's face.\"However\u2026\" The Venom King paused before he coldly said, \"Canglan County alone isn't enough to move me, I will need the two other cities neighbouring Blackwater.\"Qi Hao's expression instantly changed when he heard this. There were only thirteen cities in the entire Great Zhou Empire and the Black Venom King planned to swallow three of them, including Canglan County. This was practically a quarter of Great Zhou's land. Such an appet.i.te could only be described as enormous.The Black Venom King said in an indifferent voice, \"If you do not agree, please return to where you came from.\"The expression in Qi Hao's eyes fluctuated rapidly, before he eventually gritted his teeth and gave his answer. \"Alright. As long as you aid us in obtaining the Fire Spirit Grain, those three cities will belong to Black Venom City in future!\"A smile finally appeared on the Black Venom King's sinister-looking face when he heard these words.\"Since that is so, Black Venom City will accept this transaction.\"Qi Hao secretly sighed in relief. As he raised his head, a vicious look flitted across his eyes as he looked towards the distant Canglan County.Zhou Yuan, don't be so happy just because you managed to win over Wei Canglan. The victor in this battle for the ruins has yet to be decided!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 Into BlackwaterPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBlackwater, a land fraught with danger.But at the same time, a place that was overflowing with opportunity.In the far past, numerous powerful factions existed within Blackwater. Every one of these factions was stronger than the empires currently bordering Blackwater. Due to some unknown reason, the factions within Blackwater disappeared one after another, allowing more and more Genesis Beasts to flood Blackwater, transforming it into the Genesis Beast heaven it is today.However, although these ancient factions had disappeared, some things would ultimately be left behind, things that made countless Genesis Masters madly scramble towards them.In Blackwater, luck would occasionally favor certain fortunate souls, allowing them to ascend to the skies in a single step and let their names echo loudly across the land.Over time, more and more Genesis Masters swarmed towards this place, risking all sorts of dangers as they searched for opportunities in hopes of becoming the next individual to earn luck's blessings.But the ones who are graced by luck are ultimately few in number, and majority end up as part of the piles of bones buried under this b.l.o.o.d.y and chaotic land.\u2026Blackwater was a place of chaos and killing, a place where the strong preyed on the weak.However, Zhou Yuan's group was obviously not weak prey. Thus, although they drew countless eyes wherever they went in Blackwater, no one dared to make any moves against them.Many factions of various sizes existed within Blackwater, each king of their own territories. The pa.s.sing of Zhou Yuan, Wei Canglan and the rest of the group would cause these factions to be on high alert.After all, anyone who spent most of their time in Blackwater knew that there were two factions that could not be offended. One was the infamous Black Venom King, and the other was great general Wei Canglan of Canglan County.Zhou Yuan's group may be few in number, but all of them were elites. Moreover, there was an Alpha-Origin expert with them, Wei Canglan. This line-up was enough to easily sweep away any faction with the exception of Black Venom City.Hence, upon seeing Zhou Yuan's group, the Blackwater factions would fall into a state of panic, afraid that this terrifying party would pounce on them in the next moment.However, Zhou Yuan and the rest obviously paid no attention to these factions. As long as they did not obstruct the former, Zhou Yuan and gang would quickly pa.s.s through.This situation continued for several days as Zhou Yuan and the rest gradually approached their destination\u2026Devil Prison City, the city closest to the ruins. The city lord was an advance Heaven Gate stage expert and was rather famous in Blackwater. He was after all capable enough to govern a city here.Although Devil Prison City was normally a rather bustling place, ever since news of the ruins had spread, the city had immediately become a lodging point for the numerous factions that had come in search of treasures. Thus causing the population of the city to rise dramatically.Countless people journeyed to the ruins every day, though none dared to venture too deep. After all, there were all kinds of bizarre battle puppets inside, which would potentially become a th.o.r.n.y problem if one caught their attention. Yet, there were also some fortunate fellows who stumbled into certain places and brought out several strange 'toys'. Such items were very popular and sold for handsome sums of Genesis crystals, allowing these lucky fellows to earn a small fortune\u2026None of the city guards dared to stop Zhou Yuan, Wei Canglan and the rest when they entered Devil Prison City, allowing the latters to do as they pleased.In Devil Prison City, Zhou Yuan and gang booked an entire inn, settling everyone's accommodations.After helping everyone settle down, Wei Canglan found Zhou Yuan and suggested, \"Your highness, this is the closest city to the Battle Puppet Sect ruins and quite a number of people have already made their way to the ruins from here. We should be able to obtain information regarding the ruins here so I suggest that we take a look.\"Zhou Yuan was pretty much fine with anything. Their non-stop travels over the past few days had been exceptionally dull. Did no one else see the looks of interest on Su Youwei's, Wei Qingqing's and even Yaoyao's faces when they heard Wei Canglan make his proposal?Therefore, after tidying up a little, the group left the inn along with a few bodyguards.Devil Prison City was not as grand as Great Zhou City or Canglan County, the former gave off a rather simplistic feeling and was filled with disorder.Two waves of men would clash from time to time on the streets, every strike from each individual fatal in nature. This resulted in still warm bodies being thrown out occasionally, causing the entire city to be blanketed in an aura of cruelness.Zhou Yuan and his group drew several gazes as they walked in the city. Of course, the majority of these gazes were aimed at Yaoyao, Su Youwei and the long-legged Wei Qingqing.Beauties of such calibre were clearly very rare in such a place.However, those that could survive till now in Blackwater were at least somewhat discerning. Hence, no one dared to come forward although the gazes filled with various intentions continued to size-up the three girls.After a few turns, Zhou Yuan and the rest eventually arrived at a comparatively cleaner street, a street overflowing with people and clearly much busier and exciting than everywhere else.Stores filled the street. The dazzling goods on display very attention grabbing.\"Come, come and take a look. We have newly arrived stock from the ruins. All kinds of treasures can be found here so be sure not to miss out!\"Zhou Yuan and gang followed the shouting and arrived at the biggest store, where an a.s.sortment of objects in various states of disrepair were on display inside a crystal cabinet. Every item gave off an ancient aura as if they had just been excavated.\"Have a look everyone, this is a Genesis Weapon we uncovered from the Battle Puppet Sect. It likely used to be a Black tier Genesis Weapon and we're offering it at a hugely discounted price. Just one thousand nine hundred Genesis crystals and you'll be able to take it away!\" Someone yelled from inside the store.Zhou Yuan turned to see a long bronze spear in the man's hands. Its body was quite damaged, and it gave off a dim Genesis Qi pulse. Let alone a Black tier Genesis Weapon, it was likely that it would not even match a Normal mid grade Genesis Weapon.But this was only logical. If it was truly a Black tier Genesis Weapon, it would cost at least ten thousand Genesis crystals, not a measly thousand nine hundred.Few responded to the spear and only a scattering called out their bids. In the end, it was sold for two thousand five hundred Genesis crystals and it could be a.s.sumed that the buyer had purchased it with the mentality of hoping to find a treasured pearl under the dust.Several broken-looking items appeared in succession, each one likely obtained from the Battle Puppet Sect ruins. Zhou Yuan took a look, but nothing piqued his interest. With his Spirit perception, he could sense that these items were indeed completely damaged and no longer had any value.After a while, Zhou Yuan intended to leave with everyone.Just as he turned his body, Yaoyao suddenly pulled him, her snow-white chin indicating towards crystal display cabinet. \"Buy the item at the bottom left corner.\"Zhou Yuan was stunned. His gaze s.h.i.+fted, only to find an object that resembled a black jade tile. The surface of the jade tile was mottled, and several cracks could be seen, but a faint pattern was barely visible.Zhou Yuan was somewhat confused, because he could sense that there was not even the slightest trace of Genesis Qi from the black jade tile.\"What is it?\" He asked in a low voice.Yaoyao smiled faintly as she said, \"The jade tile itself is not worth anything, but there seems to be a rather peculiar incomplete Genesis Rune on it. Something that can give me such a feeling should be rather special to the Battle Puppet Sect.\"The corner's of Zhou Yuan's mouth twitched for a moment. You're pretty arrogant little miss, I won't possibly dare to refute your reasoning.As he shook his head inside his heart, Zhou Yuan did not probe any further and pointed at the jade tile and asked directly, \"How much?\"The seller's lips puckered slightly like a monkey. A single look was all it took to know that this was a shrewd man. Although he too did not know the function of this black jade tile, when he saw Zhou Yuan ask for a price, his eyes seemed to rotate in thought as his mouth opened, intending to ask for a very generous sum.\"My money is not so easily scammed. Are you certain that the ones behind you will be able to swallow it?\" An indifferent voice emerged from Zhou Yuan's lips.The man's mouth immediately closed. He had seen Wei Canglan turned towards him with an apathetic look. The pressure from an Alpha-Origin expert made the man understand that the person before him could not be offended.\"Hehe, the one who put it up for sale is only asking for two thousand Genesis crystals.\" It was a rather indignant reply.Zhou Yuan nodded, not wanting to needlessly waste any more time. \"Alright, I'll take it for two thousand Genesis crystals.\"With a wave of his hand, Liu Tieshan fished out the Genesis crystals and prepared to make payment.\"Wait, I offer three thousand for the jade tile.\" However, a chuckle was suddenly heard at this moment.Zhou Yuan's eyes narrowed as he turned his head slightly, only to see the crowd part for a group of people. At the very front, a familiar figure entered Zhou Yuan's eyes.\"Qi Hao?\"An icy look immediately flitted across Zhou Yuan's eyes when he saw this figure. To think that he was hiding in Blackwater.Qi Hao grinned at Zhou Yuan before pointing at the black jade tile as he lazily said, \"I'll take three thousand for it.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 The Black Jade TilePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQi Hao's sudden appearance instantly caused the atmosphere to become rather tense. Behind Zhou Yuan, Genesis Qi surged around Lu Tieshan and the rest, their eyes like an eagle's as they locked onto the former.Wei Canglan frowned slightly, staring at Qi Hao as he faintly said, \"Qi Hao, there should be no need for Qi Manor to interfere in such a matter. It will be better for you to return.\"\"I'm afraid that a single sentence from general Wei is not enough to deter Qi Manor.\" Qi Hao laughed, his tone filled with mockery.He had previously been courteous to Wei Canglan because Qi Manor wanted to draw the great general to their side. Since Wei Canglan had now chosen to help Zhou Yuan, Qi Hao naturally would not give the former any face.\"Oh?\"Wei Canglan's eyes opened slightly wider as an astonis.h.i.+ng pressure spread from his body, directed straight at Qi Hao.In the face of an Alpha-Origin stage expert's pressure, Qi Hao's body immediately stiffened.\"Hehe, Wei Canglan, you are still so easily irritable even after so many years.\" However, a raspy voice was heard the moment Wei Canglan's pressure spread. A figure in black robes slowly walked out from behind Qi Hao as black Qi rose, completely blocking Wei Canglan's aura.\"That's the Black Venom King!\"The emergence of the black robed figure immediately drew cries of horror from the surroundings. The crowd noisily withdrew, eyes filled with terror. It was clear to see how infamous the Black Venom King was in Blackwater.\"Black Venom King!\"Wei Canglan was first stunned by the appearance of the middle-aged man in black robes, but his expression quickly darkened. Intense killing intent surged out of his body, causing the surrounding Genesis Qi to rebel.\"Oh? Wei Canglan, do you plan on having another bout with me here? Could it be that you have forgotten the suffering I dished out back then?\" The Black Venom King let out a sinister laughter, the black Qi around his body churning as a horrible stench spread.Two gazes clashed, hatred and biting-cold murder raging within them.\"Honoured ones, this little city of mine will not be able to survive a battle between the both of you. With the Battle Puppet ruins right before our eyes, this is no place for the both of you to fight or others will take advantage!\" As the auras of both individuals grew stronger and stronger, a loud voice suddenly rang out as a figure flew over from far away and landed nearby.It was the city lord of Devil Prison City, an individual with the strength of the advance Heaven Gate stage.Like everyone else, he did not dare to interfere directly in the clash of two Alpha-Origin stage experts. Fortunately, his quick-wittedness with words made Wei Canglan's and the Black Venom King's eyes flash and their astonis.h.i.+ng auras slowly receded.Neither party was stronger than the other. If they were to fight and end up injured, it would instead present an opportunity to others.Wei Canglan icily said, \"Humph, if I see you in the ruins, I will definitely kill you!\"\"Hehe, it is more likely that you will not be able to leave Blackwater this time.\" The Black Venom King matched the former word for word.After seeing both of them back down, Zhou Yuan's gaze turned towards the seller of the store who currently had an agonized look on his face. Neither side was going to be accommodating, and he did not dare to offend either one.\"Five thousand Genesis crystals.\" Zhou Yuan did not waste his breath and flatly gave his offer.\"Six thousand.\" Qi Hao immediately responded. Although he did not know what use the black jade tile would be, he was h.e.l.l bent on making things difficult for Zhou Yuan.\"Ten thousand.\" Zhou Yuan's voice remained emotionless.Qi Hao's eyes flashed. \"Fifteen thousand.\"\"Twenty thousand.\"An uproar broke out around them, everyone secretly licking their lips. No one could have imagined that such a seemingly worthless object would cause such a crazy bidding war. Of course, from what they could see, Zhou Yuan was purely unwilling to back down due to pride.Qi Hao was likewise somewhat stunned. He stared at the black jade tile for a long time, but was unable to discover anything. Not even the tiniest wisp of Genesis Qi could be detected from the black jade tile.Hence, he laughed and said, \"Your highness is truly generous. As the saying goes, a gentleman should not take what another wants. I'll yield this item to you.\"There was a trace of mockery on his lips as he spoke. The original price of two thousand Genesis crystals had been raised to twenty thousand by him, a fact that was enough to screw Zhou Yuan over this time.As such, Qi Hao's pent up frustration due to the previous incident had finally been let out.The surrounding onlookers looked at Zhou Yuan as if he was a fool. This was not a small sum, spending twenty thousand Genesis crystals to buy a useless black jade tile was really somewhat dumb.It was obvious that prince Zhou Yuan had been tricked by Qi Hao.Zhou Yuan ignored the surrounding gazes and instructed Lu Tieshan to pay as he grabbed the black jade tile. He did not sense anything even after some observation and thus pa.s.sed it to Yaoyao as he softly muttered, \"It is worth it?\"The truth was, even he himself felt a little foolish, but he still bought it because he trusted Yaoyao's judgement.Twenty thousand Genesis crystals was no small amount. The Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage Genesis Masters present who possessed ten to twenty thousand Genesis crystals after toiling for many years were already considered rather rich.As for prince Zhou Yuan, his many years of savings only equated to about fifty thousand Genesis crystals, almost half of which had been spent in the past few minutes.Yaoyao gently felt the jade tile with her hand as she observed the ancient patterns on it. With a sudden laugh, she replied, \"You'll know later on whether it's worth it or not.\"Zhou Yuan could only helplessly shake his head.At this moment, the Black Venom King walked over, his eyes fixed on Zhou Yuan as black Qi surged around his body.Wei Canglan took half a step forward, his eyes vigilant as he stared at the Black Venom King.The Black Venom King glanced at Wei Canglan before turning towards Zhou Yuan as his raspy voice sounded, \"Hehe, are you the prince of the Great Zhou Empire? I've heard that you managed to neutralize my Devil Miasma Poison.\"Evidently, he had found out from Qi Hao that Zhou Yuan had neutralized the poison in Wei Bin's body.\"The Devil Miasma Poison is not that great, neutralizing it is nothing strange.\" Zhou Yuan's expression was calm.The Black Venom King's eyes opened slightly wider. \"What an arrogant little brat!\"With a sinister smile, he said, \"Do not feel so confident just because Wei Canglan is protecting you.\"He cast a sideways glance at Wei Canglan as he continued, \"Even he suffered quite a bit at my hands. I'm afraid that you've bet wrongly this time.\"Wei Canglan's face turned black with anger. The Devil Miasma Qi of the Black Venom King was extremely difficult to deal with. Due to its poisonous nature, it had indeed caused him much suffering and even affected Wei Bin.The Black Venom King smiled. \"Kid, Qi Manor promised to give me three cities after completing this task, if you give me six cities, I will help you instead.\"Upon hearing this offer, fury flashed in Zhou Yuan's eyes, A chilling look appeared in his eyes as he looked towards Qi Hao. To think that this b.a.s.t.a.r.d actually dared to do a transaction with Great Zhou's land and citizens.However, Qi Hao merely smiled nonchalantly in response.Zhou Yuan withdrew his gaze and said in a calm voice, \"It's enough that general Wei is with me. As for the Great Zhou Empire's land, anyone who dares to hope for a share shall be killed.\"The Black Venom King was taken aback. Soon after, he laughed and pointed at Zhou Yuan.\"What a charismatic kid. Excellent. Pray hard that you will never land in my hands, because I really want to have a taste of what it will be like to boil the prince of Great Zhou.\"\"I will not even bother to boil you. A single chop to remove your dog-head is all that is needed.\" Zhou Yuan revealed an icy smile. He had intense hate for someone who repeatedly infringed on Great Zhou's borders and slaughtered her citizens.By the side, Qi Hao let out a mocking laugh and prepared to speak.\"Qi Ritian , your fate will be the same if you land in my hands.\" Before Qi Hao could speak however, Zhou Yuan's cold gaze swept over. The fact that this son of a b.i.t.c.h used Great Zhou's land in a transaction infuriated the former even more. Zhou Yuan would not be merciful if Qi Hao landed in his hands.\"Qi Ritian?\" Qi Hao was stunned. Soon after, he burst into rage as he frostily said, \"Zhou Yuan, you dare to humiliate me?!\"Zhou Yuan retorted, \"The only thing in your family's bones is rebellion, so what if I humiliate you?\"Qi Hao smiled angrily. \"You think you are so great. You've not even reached the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage and yet you dare to speak to me in such a manner. If no one was protecting you, I would have killed you where you stand.\"He was a true-blue advance Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage pract.i.tioner, while Zhou Yuan had only unblocked seven meridian channels. It would be easy to slay Zhou Yuan in a direct clash.\"You will have your chance. When the time comes, we will see exactly who will be killing who.\" Zhou Yuan's voice was emotionless. Once he reached the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage, even without the first level of the Ancestral Dragon Scripture, the Omni Python Qi, he may not necessarily fear Qi Hao if he were to utilise the power of his Spirit and Genesis Runes.Qi Hao's expression darkened after being smothered by Zhou Yuan's words. The former knew that there was not much point in continuing to compare whose tongue was sharper. Therefore, he shot a eerily cold glance at Zhou Yuan, before waving his hand as he turned and left with the Black Venom King and the rest of the party.Zhou Yuan watched them leave as his expression became grave. Although it had been easy beat them with words, he did not dare to underestimate them in the slightest.\"Our most troublesome foe is the Black Venom King that even general Wei will not have much of an advantage over in a fight. Looks like we have to think of a way to deal with the Black Venom King's Devil Miasma Poison, or the situation will become extremely unfavorable to us if anything unfortunate befalls general Wei\u2026\"Zhou Yuan's eyes flickered in thought. In the end, he looked towards Yaoyao as a smile emerged on his lips. The twenty thousand Genesis crystals must not be spent in vain.[1] *\u9f50\u660a &amp; \u9f50\u65e5\u5929The 'Hao' (\u660a ) character from Qi Hao's name is made up of two characters, 'Ri' (\u65e5) and 'Tian' (\u5929)Hence, Zhou Yuan is making mockery of Qi Hao's name by calling him Qi Ritian.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 The Eighth Meridian ChannelPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the inn.After what had happened previously, everyone's expression had become a little grave. They understood that the collaboration between Qi Manor and Black Venom City would undoubtedly become their biggest obstruction.Zhou Yuan wore a serious expression as he looked towards Wei Canglan and inquired, \"General Wei, what are you chances of winning against the Black Venom King?\"Wei Canglan hesitated for a moment before he slowly answered, \"There are nine levels to the Alpha-Origin stage and both the Black Venom King and myself are at the second level. Neither of us should be able to gain the upper hand if we go at it for real\u2026 but the Black Venom King has the Devil Miasma Qi, a top-tier grade 4 Genesis Qi. It is an overbearing poison Qi that can easily infect an opponent in a fight without him knowing, hence why I suffered at its hands back then.\"\"This Devil Miasma Qi is a huge headache.\"Afraid that their morale will suffer, Wei Canglan hastily added in. \"Although I am wary of the Devil Miasma Poison, I will definitely be able to stall the Black Venom King when the time comes.\"Zhou Yaun had a look of complentation on his face. This was no insurance at all. If anything unexpected happened, the situation would become far too unfavorable for them.After some thought, he suddenly cast his gaze at Yaoyao, smiling as he asked, \"Big sis Yaoyao, could you think of something?\"Yaoyao currently had her head lowered as she studied the black jade list while carrying Tuntun. She lifted her head, showing her pretty face as she glared at Zhou Yuan. \"I just knew that you were going to ask me.\"On the way back, she had felt Zhou Yuan look towards her from to time to time.However, she also knew that this was a matter of paramount importance. Hence, after glaring at Zhou Yuan, her hand reached towards the Universe bag on her hip and retrieved a green scroll which she then placed on the table. \"This is known as the Thousand Wood Poison Safeguard Rune, a top-tier grade 3 Genesis Rune. When activated, it will be able to guard against all kinds of poisons and the Devil Miasma Poison should be unable to break its defences.\"\"A top-tier grade 3 Genesis Rune?\" Wei Canglan, Wei Qingqing and the rest stared in amazement at Yaoyao. Was this young lady before them, who did not give off even the slightest Genesis Qi undulation, really have such high mastery in the art of Genesis Runes?Such a Genesis Rune stood at the pinnacle even in the entire Great Zhou Empire.Only now did Wei Qingqing realise why Zhou Yuan always insisted on having this seemingly burdensome girl at his side.\"Great! With the aid of this Genesis Rune, the Black Venom King will no longer pose any threat towards me. I will be able to attack without worry and thoroughly suppress him. In fact, I may even find a chance to kill him!\" As Wei Canglan grasped the scroll, his face turned slightly red due to intense emotions.His hatred towards the Black Venom King had long seeped deep into his bones, and he had tried everything he could to eliminate the latter. Unfortunately, his fear of the Devil Miasma Poison had ultimately made him lose out in their previous exchanges.Now that he had this top-tier grade 3 Genesis Rune, the Thousand Wood Poison Safeguard Rune, the Black Venom King's greatest weapon no longer posed any threat towards him.Everyone in the room gave a slight sigh of relief after hearing Wei Canglan's confident declaration.Zhou Yuan also smiled and nodded. \"I'm relieved that general Wei is confident. Since our information gathering is almost complete, we shall move out tomorrow and enter the Battle Puppet Sect ruins.\"No one had any objections.\u2026Night fell. The gates of Devil Prison City were tightly shut, while countless Genesis Beast howls resounded in the mountain forests outside the city. Blackwater was even more dangerous at night.In one of the rooms in the inn, Zhou Yuan was seated on the bed, his eyes tightly shut and his body faintly trembling. The faint roar of a dragon could be heard as Genesis Qi pulsed around his body, transforming into white threads that flowed into his body through his nose.After meeting Qi Hao and the Black Venom King today, Zhou Yuan now felt a sliver of danger. Although he had the protection of a group of elites, the most dependable thing after all was one's own strength.Hence, his seven channel strength had began to feel rather lacking in Blackwater. It was time for him to advance to the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage.Zhou Yuan's chest rose and fell in cycles as Genesis Qi surged within his meridian channels, continuously attacking the increasingly loosening eighth meridian channel. After these past few days of dogged daily training, he could sense that unblocking the eighth meridian channel was just around the corner\u2026Genesis Qi continuously surged within the meridian channels inside his body.Suddenly, Zhou Yuan's body violently jerked, activating the Dragon Breath technique as another stream of Genesis Qi was absorbed into his body. Like a wave, it ferociously slammed into the final bit of obstruction in the eighth meridian channel.Pop!A faint sound was heard, as if a membrane had been broken.Zhou Yuan opened his eyes and lowered his head to look at his hands. He could feel a feeling of transparency and lightness flood his body.It was as if he had suddenly broken free of chains and shackles.The surrounding Genesis Qi voluntarily surged towards his body as the quality of his body swiftly rose.The eighth meridian channel had finally been unblocked!Zhou Yuan's body shook as an indescribable feeling rose in his heart. After half a year of hard work, he had finally unblocked all eight meridian channels.Eight meridian channels were fully opened once again after over a dozen years.Zhou Yuan violently sucked in two breaths of air, allowing himself to regain his cool before closing his eyes. Now that all eight meridian channels had been unblocked, it was time to open his Qi Dwelling.Only after opening the Qi Dwelling would one be considered to have truly stepped into the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage.\"Come!\"Zhou Yuan's eyes burned with excitement and antic.i.p.ation. He had waited far too long for this day to come.An almost inaudible dragon roar echoed from within Zhou Yuan's body. This time, the output from activating Dragon Breath had increased drastically. The Genesis Qi in the room shuddered violently, transforming into much thicker white threads that were ultimately swallowed into Zhou Yuan's body with a single gulp.The Genesis Qi in his body swiftly converged towards his lower abdomen, transforming into a swirling vortex.When the rotation of the vortex reached its peak, Zhou Yuan suddenly felt a dot appear at the center of the vortex. The inside of this Genesis dot seemed akin to a mysterious domain, sometimes present yet sometimes not.Infinitely small, yet also infinitely ma.s.sive.The moment this Genesis dot appeared, the flowing Genesis Qi in his body seemed to have been given a sudden tug. Genesis Qi surged inside his channels, pouring into the Genesis dot.Following the influx of Genesis Qi, it was as if life had emerged from the formless ma.s.s of creation inside the Genesis dot. s.p.a.ce began to develop, forming the Qi Dwelling.It was at this very moment that the Qi Dwelling in Zhou Yuan's body was finally created. At long last, the Genesis Qi he absorbed during his daily training now had a place to be stored, allowing it to gradually grow stronger. It would be nothing like the past, where the majority of the absorbed Genesis Qi would subsequently fade after improving the quality of his body.Zhou Yuan's Spirit entered the Qi Dwelling and a unique domain entered his eyes where Genesis Qi flowed in an endless cycle. Subsequently, he saw green light begin to blossom, dying the entire Qi Dwelling green.A newly created Qi Dwelling was cla.s.sified into four different ranks based on one's talent and the innate potential of the body. These four ranks were denoted by color: colorless, green, purple and gold.Zhou Yuan's Spirit nervously watched the transformation of the Qi Dwelling.Although he knew that the rank of the Qi Dwelling was not an absolute representation of one's future accomplishments, it could not be denied that the higher rank the Qi Dwelling, the greater the advantage.Green light grew richer and deeper until a speck of purple light began to emerge within it. Purple light spread, giving the Qi Dwelling a new color.\"Purple Qi Dwelling.\"Upon seeing his Qi Dwelling turn purple, Zhou Yuan finally nodded, clearly very satisfied with this outcome.The Qi Dwelling seemed to stabilize at purple, causing Zhou Yuan to breathe a sigh of relief as he began to leave the Qi Dwelling.Rumble!At this moment however, the Qi Dwelling suddenly began to shake. Zhou Yuan abruptly sensed a clearly very foreign, yet extremely familiar Genesis Qi surge out from the depths of the Qi Dwelling.The purity level of this new Genesis Qi shocked Zhou Yuan. Moreover, it gave off a very faint primal aura, as if it was origin of all life, the very first breath of Source Genesis Qi predating the formless ma.s.s of creation.\"What is going on?!\" However, Zhou Yuan was even more shocked by the origin of this mysterious Genesis Qi. He could clearly sense that it had not come from his training.But why, why was there a familiar feeling?As millions of thoughts flickered across Zhou Yuan's mind, a flash of understanding suddenly struck him, causing him to blurt out in astonishment, \"Could it be\u2026 when I was born and my eight meridian channels connected to the Qi Dwelling, this Genesis Qi had hidden itself in the depths of my Qi Dwelling?\"Zhou Yuan's eight meridian channels were naturally open when he was born. Logically speaking, the opening of his Qi Dwelling should naturally followed. However, due to the unforeseen calamity that struck, a wisp of Source Genesis Qi had hidden in the deepest recesses of his uncomplete Qi Dwelling. Now that Zhou Yuan had successfully opened his Qi Dwelling again, the Source Genesis Qi that had hidden for fourteen years had once again emerged upon sensing his presence.A dazed Zhou Yuan felt the pure Genesis Qi as complicated feelings churned in his heart.Meanwhile, the Source Genesis Qi surged into his Qi Dwelling and Zhou Yuan was shocked once again as he watched a trace of gold slowly blossomed like a rising sun within the deep purple light.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76 Opening the Qi DwellingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayGolden light emerged like a rising run and immediately spread, causing the purple light to recede as it was replaced by gold that now filled the entire Qi Dwelling.Thus, the Qi Dwelling became a resplendent gold, an impressive look indeed.\"It's\u2026 it's a gold Qi Dwelling?!\"Zhou Yuan blankly stared at the resplendent gold Qi Dwelling. Such an outcome had never occurred even in his wildest dreams!He had originally hoped for a purple Qi Dwelling, satisfied as long as he could reach the same level as Su Youwei.Yet, he would never have expected that the breath of Source Genesis Qi in the depths of his Qi Dwelling would cause the rank of his Qi Dwelling to rise a level.Zhou Yuan's heart overflowed with joy and excitement. The rank of a Qi Dwelling not only determined its potential growth, but was also able to raise the quality of his Genesis Qi.For someone with a gold Qi Dwelling, even if he were to cultivate grade 2 Genesis Qi, his output power would be greater than someone with a green Qi Dwelling and grade 3 Genesis Qi.Zhou Yuan mumbled to himself in surprise, \"I never imagined that I will open a golden Qi Dwelling.\"Gold light swam in the Qi Dwelling. Under its s.h.i.+ne, the flowing Genesis Qi grew more compact and powerful.While Zhou Yuan was immersed in joy due to the golden Qi Dwelling, he did not realise that the lump of blood-red Dragon's Resentment Poison on his palm had suddenly began to squirm.Hss hss!A strange sound echoed within the golden Qi Dwelling as wisps of blood mist emerged from an unknown place and began to flood into the Qi DwellingIt was then that Zhou Yuan finally realised what was happening. His heart shook when he saw the invading blood mist as a horrified cry rang out in his heart.\"This\u2026 it's the Dragon's Resentment Poison?!\"A dragon roar filled with bitter resentment spread from within the blood mist as blood colored light surged out. Like a virus, it swiftly spread across the golden Qi Dwelling.Zhou Yuan was horrified by this sudden turn of events.Never would he have expected that the almost six months dormant Dragon's Resentment Poison in his body would suddenly emerge and slip into his Qi Dwelling when it was formed.Zhou Yuan anxiously watched the inside of the Qi Dwelling.As the blood light spread, the golden light in the Qi Dwelling began to fade as it gradually fused with the blood light. In the end, the entire Qi Dwelling had become bright red.Bizarre and mysterious.Zhou Yuan was taken aback once again. A blood-red Qi Dwelling?What the heck was this? I've never heard of such a thing!\"That blasted Dragon's Resentment Poison!\" Zhou Yuan howled in his heart. Just a touch from that blasted Dragon's Resentment Poison had turned his beloved golden Qi dwelling into this blood-red Qi Dwelling which he had never heard of before.In the room, Zhou Yuan opened his eyes, his face an ugly greenish-white.He deeply breathed in, pus.h.i.+ng down the rage in his heart as he began to very carefully inspect the Qi Dwelling in his body. If there were any problems with it, it would undoubtedly become a huge hindrance to his cultivation.Fortunately, he did not find anything wrong. In fact, the amount of Genesis Qi the Qi Dwelling could hold seemed to have risen somewhat compared to when it was gold in color.However, Zhou Yuan did not dare to relax. His frowned deeply as he summoned Genesis Qi from his hand with a thought.Normally speaking, the Genesis Qi of those who had yet to learn any Qi cultivation methods was as clear as water. Yet, when Zhou Yuan's Genesis Qi came surging out, he discovered a faint strand of blood-red flowing within it.The strand of blood-red was very familiar to Zhou Yuan. It was the Dragon's Resentment Poison.The Dragon's Resentment Poison had been fused into his Genesis Qi? What the heck was this? Dragon poison Qi?\"Unbelievable!\" Zhou Yuan was at a complete loss, evidently unable to understand why such a change had occurred. Although he did know if this was detrimental for the time being, at the very least\u2026 he could feel that the Genesis Qi that had now been tinged with a hint of Dragon's Resentment Poison seemed to have become much fiercer in nature.Zhou Yuan had after all personally experienced how domineering the Dragon's Resentment Poison was.Zhou Yuan felt really weary inside.This new Qi Dwelling had given him three waves of surprise. First it was purple, then gold and now a blood-red color he had never encountered before\u2026\"I'll ask big sis Yaoyao tomorrow\u2026\"Unable to come to a conclusion, Zhou Yuan could only release a pained sigh.\u2026The next day.Everyone was stunned when Zhou Yuan walked out of the inn. They could clearly feel that the Genesis Qi undulations surrounding Zhou Yuan's body had become far stronger than yesterday.Wei Canglan asked in surprise, \"Your highness has broken through to the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage?\"Wei Qingqing also looked towards Zhou Yuan in amazement.\"I had a breakthrough yesterday.\" Zhou Yuan smiled and nodded.Su Youwei's eyes were filled with astonishment as she said, \"Your highness is truly impressive. In less than a year, you grew from someone who was unable to find his meridian channels to the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage. In fact, you're practically at my heels.\"In contrast, Yaoyao took another look at Zhou Yuan as a puzzled look flitted across her clear eyes.Because there were to many people present, Zhou Yuan did not approach her with his problem. Instead, he faced everyone and said, \"If all the preparations are done, let's move out.\"The group nodded and quickly mounted their horses, subsequently transforming into a flood as they surged out Devil Prison City, heading in the direction of the Battle Puppet Sect ruins.Along the way, Zhou Yuan found a chance to secretly pull Yaoyao to one side and explain in detail what had happened with an agonized face.\"Blood-red Qi Dwelling?\" Yaoyao was stunned after hearing the details. It was obvious that she too had never heard of such a thing.\"It should be because of the Dragon's Resentment Poison, but this may not be a bad thing. Your Qi Dwelling is still basically a golden Qi Dwelling, and was only transformed into such a state because the Dragon's Resentment Poison mixed itself in.\"\"As for whether there will be any problems, I cannot say for sure. You can only try to pay extra attention in future.\"In response to her answer, there was nothing Zhou Yuan could do but nod his head.\"I guess that's the only thing to do.\"\u2026While Zhou Yuan's group was rus.h.i.+ng towards the Battle Puppet Sect ruins, in Devil Prison City, Qi Hao, the Black Venom King and the rest of the group were ready to set off. Genesis Qi churned around the over hundred men group, testament to their eliteness.After listening to a report, Qi Hao sad to the Black Venom King, \"Zhou Yuan has already left earlier.\"The Black Venom King nonchalantly replied, \"The ruins are layered in danger and there is no advantage for them even if they arrive first. Why not let them help us clear the path.\"He paused for a moment, staring at Qi Hao as he continued, \"On another note, you mentioned that you prepared a little special something for this mission, exactly what did you prepare?\"Qi Hao smiled faintly. \"You'll find out when the time comes. Don't worry, with us joining hands, Zhou Yuan and Wei Canglan will not be able to leave Blackwater.\"The smile on his lips gradually turned malicious.\"The only thing that awaits them is death!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 Jade Infant FruiPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Battle Puppet Sect ruins was about two hundred miles from Devil Prison City. Zhou Yuan and his group managed to reach their destination in two hours.Zhou Yuan and the rest stood on a hill, their gazes fixed to their front where a forest of giant trees stood. White fog lingered in the depths of the forest, revealing only the faint silhouettes of various dilapidated buildings.Light seemed to flicker in the sky above the ruins as a feeling of unknown danger spread.Yaoyao took one look at the flickering light and said, \"There is a Genesis Rune boundary above the ruins.\"A Genesis Rune boundary was a more complex and large-scale way to utilise Genesis Runes, somewhat akin to a formation or array.This Genesis Rune boundary was likely the sect protecting boundary used by the Battle Puppet Sect while it still existed in Blackwater. Following the disappearance of the sect, the sect protecting boundary had faded due to the lack of Genesis Qi, though it was clear that some part still remained. Casually entering through the sky would very likely result in an encounter with the remnant boundary, something that even an Alpha-Origin stage expert would not be able to handle.After all, the power of a sect protecting boundary was nothing to scoff at.\"It seems that we can only enter on foot.\" Wei Canglan looked towards Zhou Yuan and continued, \"Your highness, according to the information we gathered, there are numerous abandoned buildings in the ruins which may contain treasures, how shall we proceed?\"Zhou Yuan did not hesitate at all and replied, \"We will first head to the area where the Jade Infant Fruit is located.\"His most important goal was the Jade Infant Fruit and the Fire Spirit Grain. Since the Fire Spirit Grain was in the deepest part of the ruins, it would naturally make sense to obtain the Jade Infant Fruit first.Wei Qingqing leaned her hand against the longsword on her waist as she said, \"The Jade Infant Fruit is located in the southwest sector of the ruins. Several people have went there, but none were able to obtain it.\"\"We must obtain it no matter what.\" The resolution in Zhou Yuan's voice was firm. His mother's lifespan had been cut substantially. How could he possibly be at ease unless he found her one of those treasures that could supplement one's life span?\"First the Jade Infant Fruit, then the Fire Spirit Grain. As for other treasures, there is no need to concern ourselves with them for the time being!\" Zhou Yuan decisively declared. The treasures in the ruins may be rare, but one should not be too greedy and instead understand what to prioritise.\"Let's go.\"Zhou Yuan looked towards Wei Canglan and the latter responded with a nod. With a wave of his hand, the hundred man group transformed into a flood, surging into the ruins under the wary gazes from the surrounding groups.\u2026Not long after Zhou Yuan and his group entered the ruins, another group swiftly approached. It was Qi Hao and the Black Venom King's group.A figure quickly rushed over from nearby.\"They've entered?\" Asked Qi Hao in a flat voice. He had stationed some men around the vicinity of the ruins in advance to keep track of the movements of Zhou Yuan's group..\"Yes, we have sent someone to follow them. They seem to be heading towards the Jade Infant Fruit location.\" The figure immediately answered.\"Jade Infant Fruit?\" Qi Hao's eyes narrowed slightly.\"The Jade Infant Fruit is a quality item. It can prolong one's lifespan and is extremely valued.\" A look of greed surfaced in the Black Venom King's eyes.\"Zhou Yuan has likely gone searching for the Jade Infant Fruit because of his mother.\" Qi Hao coldly chuckled. He had a clear grasp of the royal clan's situation.\"Humph Zhou Yuan, you've repeatedly foiled my plans, this time, I will make sure that you will not have your way! I'm really interested to see how fl.u.s.tered you will become when the Jade Spirit Fruit lands in my hands.\" A vicious look flitted across Qi Hao's eyes. Soon after, he waved his hand and commanded, \"Let's go and catch up to them.\"\u2026Fog filled the ruins. Crumbling walls could be seen wherever one looked, a rather desolate sight indeed.However, Zhou Yuan's group did not dare to tarry, maintaining their formation as they slowly pushed forward. The surrounding mists grew increasingly thicker, so thick that even Spirit perception was affected.Zhou Yuan's footsteps suddenly paused. \"Careful, something is approaching.\"Although his Spirit perception had been affected, his senses were still much sharper than an ordinary person's.Wei Canglan nodded, evidently having also sensed something.He immediately waved his hand and the surrounding guards immediately began to prepare themselves as Genesis Qi began to surge around their bodies.The white fog gently rippled.A dull red light seemed to appear within the white fog, accompanied by faint noises as a dozen of shadows emerged from within the mist, forming a wall in front of Zhou Yuan's group.Zhou Yuan and the rest looked over and focused.The black shadows were revealed to be night-black wild beasts, but on closer inspection, one would realise that their bodies were akin to black metal, gleaming with black light, while the red glow in their eyes lacked any sort of intelligence. These dozen shadows were battle beast puppets.\"So these are battle puppets?\" Zhou Yuan stared at them in wonder. The Genesis Qi that faintly pulsed from the battle beast puppet bodies showed that they were comparable to Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage experts.Wei Canglan responded, \"It is said that at their peak, the Battle Puppet Sect possessed a hundred thousand strong battle puppet army. An army that was practically invincible and unstoppable.\"Zhou Yuan clicked his tongue. A hundred thousand strong battle puppet army. If they were all at the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage, it was likely that no empire would be able to match them. Yet, why had these ancient factions of Blackwater ultimately disappeared?Wei Canglan waved his hand and twenty figures shot forward, heading straight for the dozen battle beast puppets that were blocking their way.Thump thud!Genesis Qi erupted the moment both parties clashed. Wei Canglan had sent out Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage pract.i.tioners, but the dozen battle beast puppets knew neither fear nor death, hence, the fighting was exceptionally intense.The battle lasted for several minutes, before it gradually came to a close.The dozen battle beast puppets had been dismembered, but five of the twenty Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage guards had also been injured. It was clear that these tireless and fearless battle beast puppets were rather troublesome opponents.Yaoyao walked over with some interest while carrying Tuntun and began inspecting the dismembered battle beast puppets. Her fair slender finger gently traced the now dim runes as she mumbled to herself, \"Powered by Genesis Runes\u2026\"After some examination, she stood up and walked back to the group.Zhou Yuan then nodded to Wei Canglan and they began to advance once again.In the following period of time, they encountered wave after wave of battle beast puppets. Fortunately, Zhou Yuan's group was a strong well trained force, and they were able to cleanly sweep away all resistance they encountered.As such, they arrived at a lake half an hour later.Other human figures were already present by the lakeside, likely other treasure seekers that had rushed here. The fact that they had been able to arrive here was testament to their strength.These people also sensed the arrival of Zhou Yuan's group and their eyes immediately filled with wariness.Wei Canglan took one quick look at the surroundings and pointed towards the middle of the lake. \"The Jade Infant Fruit is at the center of the lake.\"Zhou Yuan lifted his head to look, and saw fog drifting over the surface of the lake. At the very center of the lake was a small island where a giant jade-green tree stood at the middle.Zhou Yuan's gaze locked onto the tree from which two crystal-like fruits hung. The fruits were shaped like a rather adorable newborn baby and gave off a sweet and enticing fragrance.His heartbeat quickened as he observed the fruit that was seemingly made from crystal.\"Jade Infant Fruit, I've finally found you!\"Not long after Zhou Yuan's group arrived at the lake, some noise was heard from another direction and everyone watched as another group emerged from the mists.\"Qi Hao.\"A frosty look flitted across Zhou Yuan's eyes when he saw the familiar figure leading the group.Qi Hao and the Black Venom King arrived at the lakeside and shot a look in Zhou Yuan's direction. The corners the former's mouth immediately lifted as he pointed at the center of the lake and displayed a playful smile at Zhou Yuan.\"Zhou Yuan, if you want the Jade Infant Fruit, you'll have to first ask me if I agree or not.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78 Method to Reach the IslandPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAlthough Zhou Yuan remained expressionless after hearing Qi Hao's words, intense killing intent emerged within the former's eyes. The Jade Spirit Fruit was connected to the matter of his mother's lifespan. He would not let anyone s.n.a.t.c.h it away no matter what methods he had to use.It was at this moment that Wei Canglan suddenly remarked, \"Your highness, there is something strange about this lake.\"Zhou Yuan withdrew his gaze. He had similarly sensed that something was amiss. So many people had arrived here before them, but all of them only waited at the lakeside, not daring to enter the lake and seize the Jade Infant Fruit. It was obvious that they were afraid of something.Yaoyao cast a glance at the air above the lake and said, \"There is a damaged Genesis Rune boundary above the lake.\"Wei Canglan nodded in agreement. The damaged Genesis Rune boundary made even someone like himself feel threatened, and he did not dare to carelessly enter. This place was evidently rather important to the Battle Puppet Sect.\"Can we cross by walking across the water?\" Asked Zhou Yuan.Yaoyao shook her head. \"There is something strange about the water. It seems that the stronger one's Genesis Qi, the more easily one will sink\u2026\"Wei Canglan was a little taken aback. He quickly waved his hand, indicating for some of his men to confirm. Sure enough, they discovered that those with stronger Genesis Qi would sink more easily, as if the lakewater was unable to support them.\"It will be difficult for even a Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage expert to walk across the water.\" Wei Canglan frowned. If so, won't an Alpha-Origin stage expert like himself sink straight to the bottom?He could feel danger from the bottom of the lake. It was highly likely that portions of the damaged Genesis Rune boundary had fallen into the lake, making it extremely dangerous.Yaoyao's mouth opened slightly as she said, \"It seems that this place does not welcome Genesis Qi users\u2026 likely a precautionary method of sorts. With such a precaution in place, they would only need a few disciples to protect the Jade Infant Tree.\"Su Youwei curiously asked, \"How would one cross the water without Genesis Qi?\"Zhou Yuan's eyes flickered in thought for a moment, before turning to meet Yaoyao's gaze as he slowly said, \"Spirit.\"Spirit power was completely different from Genesis Qi. Moreover, Zhou Yuan had discovered that the Spirit that had originally been suppressed in the fog had turned lively again after reaching the lake.\"Let me try.\" Zhou Yuan walked forward and placed a foot onto the water, the Spirit between his brows flickering as Spirit power surged out and covered his legs. The body that had originally sunk slightly into the water immediately stabilized.\"As expected, the power of the Spirit can be used here.\" A look of glee flitted across Zhou Yuan's eyes.\"So you have to rely on the Spirit\u2026\"Nearby, Qi Hao raised an eyebrow as he watched. Soon after, he waved his hand and a man immediately walked forward from behind.This man's complexion was rather pale, and his lips were as thin as the edge of a blade. The Genesis Qi undulations around him were quite weak, but light flickered indeterminately between his brows.He was clearly a Spirit pract.i.tioner.\"Zhao Qingfeng, your teacher master Ying was framed by this brat, causing him to fall into the hands of the great general's faction. This is the best opportunity for you to take revenge.\" Qi Hao smiled at the man.Iciness flashed in the pale man's eyes when he heard this. He looked towards Zhou Yuan and said, \"How can a kid like him possibly be my master's match?\"\"He is after all the prince of Great Zhou and naturally has his ways.\" Qi Hao smiled faintly as he continued, \"As long as you are able to seize the Jade Infant Fruit, not only will I guarantee your master's safety, you will become a valued guest of Qi Manor in future and we will provide you all of the cultivation resources you need.\"Desire flashed in the eyes of the man called Zhao Qingfeng as he nodded and said with a cold smile, \"Don't worry, if we compete in Spirit, dealing with him will not be difficult.\"His tone was filled with pride. Though he had only trained under master Ying for three years, his Spirit had already reached the mid Illusory stage, and even his master often praised his talent. Thus, he did not believe that a much younger Zhou Yuan would be able to match him in Spirit.After leaving these words behind, Zhao Qingfeng flew forward and landed on the water.Spirit power shook as his sole touched the water's surface without sinking.A mocking smile formed on his lips as he looked towards Zhou Yuan.While the two stood on the water, the other factions also came to the same realization. Hence, after some activity, another dozen figures appeared on the surface of the water, each individual clearly a Spirit pract.i.tioner.Wei Canglan shot a look in Zhao Qingfeng's direction and remarked, \"That person's Spirit is not weak.\"\"If only Spirit can be used here, I may be able to help you.\" Yaoyao's bright eyes seem to swirl. Given her Spirit level, no one here would be able to contend with her.Zhou Yuan pondered for a moment after hearing this, but he ultimately shook his head. \"The situation is complicated and no one knows if there will be other hidden dangers. It is not ideal for you to go.\"Although Yaoyao's Spirit was powerful, she was unable to utilise Genesis Qi, resulting in an extremely frail body. If anything unexpected happened, the probability of Yaoyao being seriously injured was high.Therefore, while Yaoyao was very powerful, she was also very weak.Back then, master Cang Yuan had solemnly entrusted him with Yaoyao's safety. Hence, he did not dare to let Yaoyao take such a risk.Zhou Yuan said, \"Observe first, if anything happens to me, at least there will be the great general and you to save me.\"Yaoyao did not persist after hearing this and her sharp snow-white chin gave a tiny nod.Atop the lake, Zhou Yuan calmly cast a glance at the nearby Zhao Qingfeng. Undisguised hostility burned in the latter's eyes, but it did not matter to Zhou Yuan. No one would be able to stop him from obtaining the Jade Infant Fruit today.The lake water under his feet rippled as he took in a deep breath and looked towards the small island at the center of the lake. He then took a step forward, beginning his step by step advance on the lake surface.The others also started to very cautiously walk forward.Around the lake, no one dared to blink at they watched the figures walking on the water. It was completely silent.Several minutes later, Zhou Yuan and the rest gradually approached the area within a hundred feet of the small island. The lake was still calm and no one had encountered any obstructions.When the crowd by the lakeside saw this, they could not help but murmur in bewilderment, \"So simple?\"Under those puzzled gazes, Zhou Yuan and the rest stepped into the area within a hundred feet of the island.Buzz!A buzzing sound seemed to emerge from the small island at this moment, and everyone watched as dazzling jade light was released from the Jade Infant tree at the center of the island.Plop!The jade light seemed to sway as countless barely discernible specks of light shot out from within. Like a storm, they began to engulf the ones who had stepped into the hundred feet perimeter around the island.\"It's a Spirit attack!\"Zhou Yuan focused on the barely visible specks of light. These light dots contained Spirit power.He did not dare to delay a moment longer and the Spirit between his brows began to flicker. If one looked, one would be able to see a blurry silhouette seated in a cross-legged position. An invisible ripple pulsed outwards as Zhou Yuan's hand pulled out the Heavenly Yuan Brush at his waist.The tip of the brush rapidly moved across the air, leaving behind almost visible strokes.\"Grade 1 Genesis Rune, Spirit s.h.i.+eld!\"The completed Genesis Rune immediately transformed into partly transparent s.h.i.+eld of light. The Genesis Qi ripples from the light s.h.i.+eld were extremely weak because the s.h.i.+eld was mainly composed of Spirit power.Plop plop!Jade light rained down from the sky, falling upon the transparent light s.h.i.+eld, causing it to ripple violently.Ah!Blood-curdling screeches began to ring out. Several individuals were unable to guard in time, and were immediately shot full of holes by the jade light, their bodies crumpling before sinking into the water.As these individuals fell into the water, berserk undulations exploded within the lake. b.l.o.o.d.y water quickly rose and spread across the lake surface.The ones that had fallen into the waters had been instantly blasted to pieces.This sight caused the hearts of Zhou Yuan, Zhao Qingfeng and the other fortunate survivors to s.h.i.+ver. It seems that the waters below were indeed filled with danger, ensuring certain death if one was to fall into them.Looks like reaching the small island at the heart of the lake and retrieving the Jade Infant Fruit not going to be as easy as expected.These ruins were abundant with death traps.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 FearPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the a round of jade light bombardment, almost half of the individual's standing on the lake surface had been wiped out. Of course, the ones that were left naturally had some ability. In front of each of them stood a flickering translucent light s.h.i.+eld similar to Zhou Yuan's, that fully protected their bodies.With their bodies protected by Spirit s.h.i.+elds, the footsteps of Zhou Yuan and the rest did not stop as they continued their cautious advance towards the small island.As they approached, the Jade Infant Tree sent out another two waves of jade light bombardments, shattering the s.h.i.+elds of several individuals, causing them to fall into the water and transform into pools of blood.By this time, Zhou Yuan and several others were only twenty feet from the island, practically moments away from reaching it.At the lakeside, everyone held their breath in silence as they watched.Zhou Yuan's eyes were tightly fixed on the small island. The nearer he got, the more tense he became. He had a feeling that the obstruction from the island was not merely limited to its earlier antics\u2026Step by step, Zhou Yuan and the rest approached the island and soon reached the distance of only ten feet from its sh.o.r.e.Bang!It was at this moment that jade light once again exploded from the Jade Infant Tree on the island, sweeping outwards in a circular fas.h.i.+on.Zhou Yuan and the rest were immediately engulfed by the light.Buzz!A buzzing noise immediately rose in the heads of Zhou Yuan and the rest as the scenery before their eyes faded into darkness. A wasteland quickly appeared before them. Only one thing stood on this barren land, a giant jade colored tree.Tiny as ants before this giant tree, an indescribable pressure swallowed them, causing them to feel intense fear. Fear that made one's Spirit tremble so hard that it began to show signs of dissipating.By the lakeside, Su Youwei gazed upon the surface of the lake where Zhou Yuan, Zhao Qingfeng and the rest had stopped moving, their bodies now completely still. She immediately sensed that there was something wrong, worry flas.h.i.+ng in her eyes as she turned towards Yaoyao and asked, \"Big sis Yaoyao, what is going on?\"Yaoyao frowned a little. \"It's Spirit pressure. They've been caught by a certain type of Spirit attack and if they are unable to endure, even their Spirit will be crushed to pieces.\"The expressions of Wei Canglan, Wei Qingqing, Lu Tieshan and the others changed. If the Spirit was shattered, one would become a vegetable. In other words, the consequences were extremely serious.Wei Canglan declared in a low voice, \"We must save his highness.\"Yaoyao shook her head as she softly said, \"Don't worry, he is not so easily defeated.\"If it was anyone else, Yaoyao would not have spoken with such confidence, but since it was only a Spirit attack, hurting Zhou Yuan who had learnt the Primal Chaos Divine Grindstone Visualisation Method was practically impossible.While they were conversing, the remaining figures on the lake began to fall one by one. The eyes of each one becoming hollow as if their minds had been wiped clean.Splash.Their bodies fell into the water, sinking to the bottom of the lake where they were ripped to shreds by the damaged Genesis Rune boundary before rising again as pools of blood.In the short span of a few breaths, only two figures were left atop the lake.Zhou Yuan and Zhao Qingfeng....The colossal jade tree towered before the eyes of two individuals as waves of pressure swept over them.\"Spirit pressure huh\u2026\"Zhou Yuan stared at the incomparably gargantuan jade tree. Although his Spirit was trembling due to the overwhelming pressure of the tree, he did not crumble in fear.After all, the terror he had experienced before was far greater than anything this jade tree could produce.\"Let me show you the meaning of true terror.\"With a thought, formless and primal chaos began to descend from outside the barren land. From within the void emerged a mottled divine grindstone as a seemingly infinite shadow slowly descended.A slowly turning divine grindstone evaporated everything into nothingness.The giant jade tree was already frozen with shock. Before the mottled divine grindstone, the former was extremely small and tiny.The divine grindstone slowly approached and the jade tree together with the barren land were turned into nothingness\u2026On the lake, Zhou Yuan's tightly shut eyes suddenly opened. The life flowing within them made it clear that his Spirit had not been destroyed by the Spirit pressure.He turned his head and waved towards the anxious Su Youwei and the rest on the bank, indicating that there was no need for them to worry.Wei Canglan, Su Youwei and the rest breathed a sigh of relief when they saw this.After freeing himself from the Spirit pressure of the Jade Infant Tree, Zhou Yuan walked forward once again, and soon stepped foot onto the small island. He did not face any obstructions this time.When Zhou Yuan stepped onto the small island, Zhao Qingfeng's body shook and his tightly shut eyes slowly opened, fear flas.h.i.+ng within them.The giant jade tree had previously immobilized him with fear. Fortunately for him however, he had managed to endure till the bitter end.\"How the h.e.l.l does this Jade Infant Tree possess such a powerful Spirit pressure? Thank G.o.d my Spirit is strong. I should be the first to have broken free.\"Zhao Qingfeng wiped away the cold sweat on his brows as he mumbled to himself. He then lifted his head, only to see Zhou Yuan stepping onto the island, a sight that made the former's expression abruptly change.Zhao Qingfeng cried out in alarm, \"How?!\"Angry white and green interlaced on his face. He had originally believed that his mid Illusory stage Spirit was enough for him to turn his nose up on everyone else here. Yet, how could he have imagined that the youth that looked even younger than himself be freed from the Spirit pressure before him.The fluctuating emotions within Zhao Qingfeng's eyes ultimately culminated into a flash of viciousness.As someone who had already aligned himself with Qi Manor, if he failed here, his value in Qi Hao's heart would surely fall, something that was undoubtedly extremely disadvantageous to him.Hence, he had to obtain the Jade Infant Fruit.As this thought flashed in his mind, Zhao Qingfeng's Genesis Rune Brush abruptly streaked across the air, the Spirit between his brows flickering. A Genesis Rune was completed a split second later.\"Grade 2 Genesis Rune, Ghost Face Spirit Devouring Rune!\"In the wake of Zhao Qingfeng's final stroke, light exploded from the Genesis Rune, transforming into a ray of greyish-black that shot towards Zhou Yuan's back.The expressions of Su Youwei and the rest instantly changed upon seeing this as they anxiously shouted, \"Careful your highness!\"A piercing noise rang out as the greyish-black light shot through the air. If one was struck by this Spirit attack, the body would be fine, but one's Spirit would definitely be gravely injured, an outcome that was even worse than losing a limb.From this, one could see just how malicious Zhao Qingfeng's attack was.As the greyish-black light whistled towards Zhou Yuan, he too sensed something and abruptly turned his head. Murder flitted across his eyes as the view of the attack and Zhao Qingfeng entered his eyes.\"I originally planned to ignore you, but since you want to die so badly, I'll just have to grant your wis.h.!.+\"Light flickered between Zhou Yuan's brows as a rune of light slowly emerged. It was a Genesis Rune that had been prepared in advance.\"Grade 2 Genesis Rune, Spirit Severing Rune!\"With a swish, the rune turned into a ray of invisible light as it shot forth. Like a blade made of Spirit, it powerfully slashed downwards at the incoming greyish-black light.Zhou Yuan had made use of the time while they were journeying towards Blackwater to learn several grade 2 Genesis Runes from Yaoyao. The Spirit Severing Rune was one of them and utilised Spirit power to attack.He had originally planned on saving this rune for Qi Hao. Who could have expected that he would end up using it at this juncture.Ch!A faint 'ch' sound was heard as the greyish-black ray was split into two.Zhao Qingfeng's pupils shrank as he involuntarily cried out, \"What?!\"His grade 2 Genesis Rune had actually been sliced into half by Zhou Yuan?\"Mid Illusory stage. So you too are at the mid Illusory stage!\" It was at this same moment that Zhao Qingfeng finally sensed Zhou Yuan's Spirit undulations, Spirit undulations that were the same mid Illusory stage as himself.Zhou Yuan's eyes were cold. The Spirit between his brows flashed as a blurry silhouette shot out. A second later, it appeared in front of Zhao Qingfeng and rushed towards his forehead.\"Since the jade tree was unable to satisfy your craving for fear, let me send you another helping!\"As Zhou Yuan's icy voice faded, the scenery before Zhao Qingfeng's eyes began to ripple. This time however, instead of a barren wasteland, it was a formless void.Rumble!A loud sound was suddenly heard. Zhao Qingfeng raised his head and quickly saw the endless giant shadow of a divine grindstone slowly looming towards him.Before the divine grindstone, the towering jade tree from earlier now seemed so insignificant in comparison.An indescribable feeling of dread surged in Zhao Qingfeng's heart as his Spirit began to tremble uncontrollably. A faint breaking sound was heard as cracks started to surface on Zhao Qingfeng's spirit.AAHHH!Zhao Qingfeng let out a blood-curdling scream as his eyes rapidly became hollow and blank. His Spirit had crumbled on the spot, unable to withstand the fear of the divine grindstone.Splas.h.!.+His body fell into the water, ultimately transforming into a pool of blood.The lake bank was completely silent as everyone watched this scene in shock. Though a bout of Spirit power was not visible, everyone clearly understood just how dangerous it was.However, none of them had expected the one to make the first move, Zhao Qingfeng, would suffer such a pathetic defeat mere moments later\u2026This was clear evidence of just how powerful prince Zhou Yuan's Spirit was!\"Useless!\" A terrifyingly icy voice escaped from between the teeth of a stormy-faced Qi Hao as he watched this scene. Zhao Qingfeng had bragged of how great of a genius he was in front them earlier. Yet, this very same 'genius' had turned out to be such weakling in front of Zhou Yuan and was defeated after a single exchange.On the small island, Zhou Yuan cast an indifferent glance at the body that had fallen into the lake. Without further ado, he turned around and walked towards the Jade Infant Tree at the center of the island.As he raised his head to gaze at the two crystal infant-shaped fruits hanging on the tree, a look of excitement surged in his eyes.\"Eh?\"However, just as he was about to pluck the Jade Infant Fruit, he suddenly turned towards one of the branches where a dull silver ring was hanging.A faint but peculiar ripple pulsed from the ring.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 Treasure ObtainedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"What is this?\"Under the jade glow, Zhao Yuan blankly stared at the flickering silver ring. The undulations from the silver light felt a little familiar to him.He hesitated slightly as the Heavenly Yuan Brush in his hand suddenly grew, transforming into its martial form. With a gentle flick of the brush tip, he retrieved the ring from the branch.Zhou Yuan reached out and grabbed the ring as a cold sensation entering his hand. At closer inspection, he realised that there were some ancient-looking patterns on the ring which gave off a strange aura.Moreover, while he was holding the ring, Zhou Yuan felt the Spirit between his brows stir restlessly as if its power was being amplified.\"This ring can strengthen one's Spirit?\" A thought flashed in Zhou Yuan's mind as he raised his head and looked at the Jade Infant Tree. the Spirit undulations from the Jade Infant Tree had weakened after removing the ring from the branch.\"The earlier Spirit attacks were the Jade Spirit Tree's instinctive protective measures, but how can a Jade Infant Tree have such a powerful Spirit?\" Zhou Yuan's eyes flickered with thought before he turned once again to stare at the dull silver ring in his hand.Could it be\u2026 that this ring was the reason why the Jade Infant Tree's Spirit had been strengthened, giving it the power to protect itself.After mulling over it for some time, Zhou Yuan decided to give up for the time being and let Yaoyao take a look later. She would likely know the ring's function.Zhou Yuan kept the ring and retrieved two jade boxes from his Universe bag. The tip of his foot pushed off the ground as he flew up towards the Jade Infant Tree. Light flashed at his fingertips and the two Jade Infant Fruits on the tree fell into the boxes.Zhou Yuan immediately closed the boxes so as to prevent better preserve the effects of the Jade Infant Fruit ,before very carefully returning them to inside his Universe bag.\"Finally got them.\"Zhou Yuan's entire body relaxed as if a great burden had been lifted from his shoulders. Now that he had obtained the Jade Infant Fruit, he would be able to help his mother regain her lost lifespan. Then, he would no longer have to worry about Qin Yu's ten year life expectancy......By the lakeside, Qi Hao expression was rather ugly as he watched Zhou Yuan collect the treasures on the island.There was a mysterious expression in the Black Venom King's eyes as he remarked, \"Prince Zhou Yuan does indeed have some skills.\"Qi Hao's expression was as dark as a storm as he flatly said, \"Let him be happy a little while longer. Don't worry, whatever he obtains now will ultimately fall into our hands.\"\"The current him is merely akin to the dowry of a bride.\"\"It's going to be interesting to see what kind of expression he will have when all of the treasures he so painstakingly collected ends up in our hands.\"After speaking, Qi Hao could no longer be bothered with this area and stormed off.Nearby, Wei Canglan and the rest finally began to relax upon seeing the Qi Hao's group depart. The former had been closely watching the latter since the beginning.Wei Canglan and the rest understood that it was not because Qi Hao's group had given up, but because they did not want to start a fight with the former here.After all, the most important Fire Spirit Grain had yet to be seen.Zhou Yuan inspected the entirety of the small island. Only after ascertaining that there was nothing else was he satisfied. He then proceeded to return with the two Jade Infant Fruits and the dull silver ring.Wei Canglan smiled and cupped his fists together towards Zhou Yuan who had just reached the lake bank. \"Congratulations on successfully obtaining the treasures your highness.\"Zhou Yuan chuckled, his eyes narrowing as he shot a glance in the direction Qi Hao had left in. He knew that this was only a tiny setback to the latter, and the real battle would only begin when they found the Fire Spirit Grain.There were still several factions around the lake watching Zhou Yuan with greed-filled eyes. The allure of the Jade Infant Fruit was not small after all.However, due to the strength of Zhou Yuan's party and the Alpha-Origin stage Wei Canglan, all of these groups had no choice but to restrain the greed in their hearts as they regretfully withdrew, turning towards other places in the ruins to see if they would be luckier there.Zhou Yuan did not intend to waste any more time and said, \"Qi Hao's group has already headed towards the depths of the ruins where the Fire Spirit Grain is located. We cannot tarry any further, let us prepare to move.\"The Fire Spirit Grain was too important and could not be allowed to fall into Qi Manor's hands or their strength would definitely soar.Everyone nodded upon hearing this.Hence, the party swiftly began their preparations before heading towards the depths of the ruins.Along the way, Zhou Yuan found a chance to pa.s.s the dull silver ring to Yaoyao and let her have a look.\"This ring is a treasure\u2026 it should be a Genesis artifact.\" There seemed to be some interest in Yaoyao's voice as she continued to inspect it. \"It seems to have the function of strengthening and nouris.h.i.+ng one's Spirit and is very beneficial for Spirit cultivation. The Spirit attacks from the tree were probably only possible through the help of this artifact.\"\"But\u2026 it seems to be broken.\"Yaoyao pointed at the faded ancient rune on the dull silver ring. It seemed that it had been damaged because the Jade Infant Tree had used too much of the ring's power.\"If this artifact is repaired, it may be able to temporarily amplify one's Spirit to a pretty astonis.h.i.+ng level.\"Zhou Yuan scratched his head. \"Is there anyone who can repair it?\"With his mastery of Genesis Runes, he could not even identify the Genesis Rune on the ring, let alone repair it.\"Who else do you know besides me?\" Yaoyao laughed softly.Only then did Zhou Yuan chuckle. \"Then I'll have to trouble big sis Yaoyao.\"...The group no longer made any pit stops on their way to the deepest part of the ruins. Every obstruction they encountered was completely swept away by their full power.They would occasionally pa.s.s by several locations leaking the light of treasures that drew over numerous factions. But Zhou Yuan decisively chose to turn a blind eye and continue towards the depths of the ruins.The Fire Spirit Grain was the most important thing for now.After an hour of their full speed travelling, they began to sense the surrounding ruins grow increasingly cl.u.s.tered and grand. The battle puppets that appeared were also growing stronger and stronger, so strong that even an elite party like theirs suffered several injuries.Rumble!A berserk wave of Qi exploded from a particular area in the ruins, shattering the surrounding rocks.Atop a boulder, Zhou Yuan's expression was grave as he observed the battle field in front of him where eight Heaven Gate level battle puppets had appeared. As such, even Lu Tieshan and the other Heaven Gate experts had been forced into action this time.\"It is fortunate that we managed to win general Wei to our side. I really cannot imagine how great of a price we would have to pay to enter the deepest part of the ruins without him.\" Zhou Yuan sighed in his heart.As he sighed, the intense battle drew to a close. Lu Tieshan and the rest gradually defeated the battle puppets with their superiority in numbers.However, their side had also suffered injuries. The only silver lining was that no one had died yet.Zhou Yuan gazed at Lu Tieshan and the other fighters as he smiled and said, \"It's been hard on all of you.\"\"Your highness, the Fire Spirit Grain is likely right ahead.\" Wei Canglan suddenly interjected. He had sensed that the Genesis Qi some distance to their front was extremely abundant and vigorous.Zhou Yuan nodded as his eyes seemed to burn.\"Go!\"The party proceeded onwards with a wave from Zhou Yuan after Lu Tieshan and the other fighters rested for a while. A flurry of figures shot forth as the sounds of shuttling wind rang out.The group swiftly ascended a hill as the view before them suddenly opened up and a desolate valley appeared before their eyes.Another group was standing on one side of the valley. It was Qi Hao and the Black Venom King.They had also sensed the arrival of Zhou Yuan's group, but only gave the latter a glance before turning their heads away, their burning gazes staring into the valley.Zhou Yuan and the rest stopped on another side of the valley and looked down. They immediately saw dazzling fiery-red plant gently swaying at the bottom of the valley.The plant was entirely red, as if flames were burning on it. A wave of pure Genesis Qi pulsed from it along with a faint fragrance.The eyes of Zhou Yuan and his group could not longer s.h.i.+ft away after seeing the fiery-red plant.Zhou Yuan licked his lips, his eyes burning with excitement.\"Is this the grade 4 Genesis Food, Fire Spirit Grain?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81 Great Battle in the ValleyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA scarlet glow was emitted from the Fire Spirit Grain at the bottom of the valley like a small sun, drawing the attention of the two groups at the top of the valley. Everyone's eyes were filled with longing and excitement.Qi Hao withdrew his gaze with some difficulty, the unconcealable greed pulsing in his eyes turning to a dark look as he turned towards the other side of the valley where Zhou Yuan's group was.\"Zhou Yuan, I advise you to leave now or it will soon be too late for regrets.\" Qi Hao's tone was intimidating.Zhou Yuan was expressionless as he shot a glance at Qi Hao. The former really could not be bothered with the latter's rubbish.Upon seeing that Zhou Yuan was ignoring him, iciness flashed within Qi Hao's eyes as he said, \"Since you are so insisted on seeking death, I will grant your wish today!\"\"City lord Black, it is time for you to act.\" Qi Hao looked towards the Black Venom King.The Black Venom King let out two piercing laughs as his grating voice sounded, \"Since you've paid the price of three cities, I will naturally lend my aid till the end.\"As his words faded, the Black Venom King's body jolted and boundless black Qi poured out from the top of his head, covering the sky above like ominous black clouds.An appalling stench spread from the black clouds, an indication of the strong poison contained within.This was the Black Venom King's Genesis Qi, the grade 4 Devil Miasma Qi.The Devil Miasma Qi was obtained by the Black Venom King through a fortunate encounter. Not only had it enabled him to reach the Alpha-Origin stage, it had even given him to power to tower above the numerous experts of Blackwater.So much power that even Wei Canglan had repeatedly suffered at the former's hands.While the Black Venom King was displaying his might, Wei Canglan also took a step forward, his frosty gaze fixed on the Black Venom King as similarly vigorous Genesis Qi poured out from the top of his head.Wei Canglan's Genesis Qi had a dark gold l.u.s.tre. It gave a strong military aura and was filled with deadly killing intent.This Gold Militant Qi was likewise a grade 4 Genesis Qi. It felt as sharp as a blade and was rather domineering.\"Wei Canglan, who would have expected someone like you, who has repeatedly suffered at my hands, to still have the courage to fight. I truly admire your bravery!\" The Black Venom King smiled coldly.Murder flashed in Wei Canglan's eyes. \"This time, I will kill you to repay all the torture you've inflicted on me over the years!\"\"Haha, I'm afraid that you don't have the capability!\" The Black Venom King laughed loudly. Soon after, the swirling Devil Miasma Qi in the sky descended and wrapped around his body, bringing him into the air.He stood on the Devil Miasma Qi as black Qi roared behind him, a dreadful sight akin to seeing a demon.\"Your highness, I will go deal with that poison b.a.s.t.a.r.d. Everything else will be left to the rest of you.\" After leaving behind these words, dark gold Qi whizzed over as he stepped onto it and rose into the sky.Two Alpha-Origin stage experts faced each other in the sky, their powerful auras clas.h.i.+ng.Buzz!Wei Canglan was the first to make his move. With a grasp of his hand, the dark gold Genesis Qi around his body surged forth, piercing through the air like a golden lance as it shot towards the Black Venom King.\"Keh keh.\"The Black Venom King let out a strange laugh as his hands joined together. Black Qi began to spin, forming a black tornado that bounced away the incoming dark gold Genesis Qi.On two different sides of the valley, Zhou Yuan, Qi Hao and the rest of the two parties watched the battle in the sky with grave expressions.\"Come Wei Canglan, have a taste of my Devil Miasma Prison!\"The Black Venom King's sleeves fluttered as two streams of black Genesis Qi flew out. The Genesis Qi swiftly descended from the sky, like a rapidly shrinking cage with Wei Canglan at its center.As the black prison grew smaller and smaller, the churning toxic black Qi within it enclosed around Wei Canglan.\"Golden Broadsword Slas.h.!.+\"Wei Canglan's face was ice-cold as he made a grabbing motion with his hand and a giant broadsword appeared within it. Runes covered the entire broadsword as a powerful aura pulsed from it.It was a Black tier Genesis Weapon.Broadsword in hand, Wei Canglan powerfully slashed downwards.Pch!A hundred feet long golden blade of light shot out and ripped through the air, breaking the shrinking cage in a single strike.Swis.h.!.+After the cage was sliced apart, black Qi suddenly appeared behind Wei Canglan. The Black Venom King appeared and sent a palm strike flying towards Wei Canglan's back.Black Qi swirled around the palm, showing that the attack contained a powerful venom.As a stench rushed towards Wei Canglan from behind, he throw a fist behind him. A golden glow surrounded his fist as rays of golden light shot forth, rays as sharp as swords.Bang!Fist and palm collided.The surrounding air exploded as a piercing explosion rang out together with a wave of Qi that could be seen with the naked eye.Two figures shot backwards from the collision.A slightly twisted expression could be seen on the Black Venom King's face as he steadied his body while fresh blood dripped continuously from his hand. Wei Canglan's Gold Militant Qi was just too domineering and had pierced the former's hand in their previous clash.However, although his hand had been pierced, a sinister look glowed within the Black Venom King's eyes as he stared at Wei Canglan and said in a frosty voice, \"Wei Canglan, you really do not learn do you. To think that you would clash directly with my Devil Miasma Qi. Have you really forgotten what it tastes like when my poison invades your body?\"Though the Black Venom King's palm had been pierced in the previous clash, he had similarly managed to send some Devil Miasma Qi into Wei Canglan's body.However, the Black Venom King was somewhat surprised to see Wei Canglan's expression remain indifferent. The latter slowly lifted his hand as a faint green rune of light emerged. The Black Venom King's expression turned ugly as he watched the green light rune slowly expel a wisp of black Qi.His Devil Miasma Qi had been expelled!\"Do you really believe that I would allow your poison to enter my body?\" Mocked Wei Canglan. The green light rune was naturally the Thousand Wood Poison Safeguard Rune.When activated, it would protect one's body and prevent any poison from entering.The Black Venom King's expression turned as dark as a bottomless well. It turns out that he was the one who had suffered instead, his palm pierced by Wei Canglan.On one side of the valley, Wei Qingqing happily blurted out when she saw this, \"Father has taken the upper hand!\"Zhou Yuan breathed a tiny sigh of relief. It was fortunate that he had made preparations in advance or it would likely be very difficult for Wei Canglan to gain the upper hand.In contrast, the atmosphere on Qi Hao's side grew rather tense as he frowned. It was obvious that he had not expected the Black Venom King to suffer such a big loss.Qi Ling said in a low voice, \"First young master, I'm afraid that the Black Venom King will not be able to win and will at best only manage to delay Wei Canglan.\"Qi Hao's expression grew icy. His eyes flickered in thought for a moment before he coldly said, \"No problem, delaying Wei Canglan is fine. Next, it is time for us to show our hand.\"He raised his head and looked towards Zhou Yuan as the corners of his mouth lifted to form a mocking smile.\"It seems that they believe victory is already theirs. Since that is so, let us send them a little gift\u2026\"As his words faded, the ground suddenly began to shake. The valley was abruptly torn open, dust rising into the air as an enormous creature slowly emerged.The pupils of Zhou Yuan and his group shrank when they saw the giant silhouette that had suddenly appeared.Light s.h.i.+ned down upon a giant black python that was several dozens of feet long. Its serpent eyes were entirely red, and numerous runes had been inscribed on its body. A ferocious without equal aura swept outwards from it.Zhou Yuan's expression became extremely grave as he gazed at the giant python.Had the protector of the ruins finally appeared?He raised his head, frowning as his gaze swept towards Qi Hao's group which was nearer to the giant python. The former did not see any worry on the latter's face. Instead, Qi Hao was looking at the giant battle puppet python with eyes filled with both excitement and antic.i.p.ation.\"What's going on?\" Zhou Yuan's eyes narrowed slightly.As if sensing Zhou Yuan's gaze, Qi Hao turned his head and displayed a strange smile to the former. At the same time, a chilling voice drifted over from the distance.\"Zhou Yuan, I advised you to leave earlier, now\u2026 all of you will die here!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82 Tuntun\u2019s Show of PowerPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQi Hao's cold mockery-filled voice echoed in the valley, sounding as if victory was already his.Zhou Yuan's eyes narrowed slightly. Qi Hao's seemingly blind confidence made the former feel a trace of danger. The latter should also understand that the strengths of both parties were currently equal.Zhou Yuan slowly said, \"I'm afraid that your group cannot take down the giant battle puppet python alone.\"Qi Hao laughed, a strange smile on his lips as he replied, \"I feel that you are the ones who should worry about this problem.\"Su Youwei, Wei Qingqing and the rest exchanged a look, confusion in their eyes. Was Qi Hao so certain that the giant battle puppet python would not attack his party?Qi Hao merely smiled when he saw their expressions. With a grasp of his hand, a black flute appeared within it.The flute gave off a faint glow and one could barely make out runes flowing on its surface. It was an exceptionally mysterious sight.\"This is the spirit controlling flute. It is specially made to control beast spirits\u2026\" Qi Hao softly chuckled before he continued, \"Although this giant battle puppet python is a puppet, its core is a grade 4 python-type Genesis beast spirit. What do you think will happen when I control its beast spirit?\"The expressions of Zhou Yuan, Wei Qingqing, Lu Tieshan and the rest finally changed. They never imagined that Qi Hao would have such a treasure in his possession.An item that could temporarily control a grade 4 Genesis Beast spirit was certainly invaluable.Qi Hao spun the black flute as he grinned. \"Truthfully, it is all thanks to your highness' rising reputation that increased the support provided to us by the Great Wu Empire, thus enabling such a treasure to fall into our hands.\"\"So I really have to thank you for this.\"Zhou Yuan frowned deeply as he gazed at Qi Hao's superficial smile. If Qi Hao was truly able to temporarily control the giant battle puppet python, the balance between their parties would be broken.A single giant battle puppet python was enough to tie up all of them, while Qi Hao could take the chance to retrieve the Fire Spirit Grain without any obstructions.Woowoo!While Zhou Yuan was thinking of a way to save the situation, Qi Hao had already began to blow the black flute. A faint but peculiar 'woowoo' sound rang out, echoing around the valley.The red eyes of the giant battle puppet python gradually brightened as if awakening. Soon after, its red eyes turned in the direction of Zhou Yuan's group.Swis.h.!.+The giant battle puppet python swung its tail, causing the ground below to crumble as its body transformed into a series of after-images, darting towards Zhou Yuan's group like lightning. It was a very intimidating sight.In the sky, Wei Canglan's expression changed when he saw this and quickly moved to try and save them.\"Heh, your opponent is me. Stop being distracted!\" However, a stream of black Genesis Qi shot over at this moment, bringing with it an appalling stench.Wei Canglan had no choice but to throw a strike with the back of his palm, dispersing the black Genesis Qi. However, his window of opportunity was already gone.\"Protect his highness!\"Lu Tieshan yelled with a grave expression. Eight Heaven Gate experts attacked together, each throwing a punch as eight jets of Genesis Qi shot forth, slamming into the body of the incoming giant battle puppet python.Bang!A loud sound was heard as the giant battle puppet python's charge was finally stopped. However, its tail suddenly shot forward, blasting apart the air and leaving behind numerous after images as it descended from the sky.Boom!An entire section of the valley ridge was hacked open by the tail, scattering rocks everywhere. Lu Tieshan and the seven Heaven Gate experts could only scatter as they miserably tried to evade.Although they had the advantage in numbers, it was obviously not that easy to match an Alpha-Origin giant battle puppet python.Zhou Yuan's eyebrows furrowed as he watched Lu Tieshan and the rest continuously try to dodge the giant battle puppet python's attacks. This turn of events had already surpa.s.sed his expectations.\"Your highness, what do we do?\" Wei Qingqing looked towards Zhou Yuan, worry flas.h.i.+ng in her eyes.Zhou Yuan shook his head and soothed her a little. Although his expression was grim, there was not much panic to be seen. Qi Hao may have a trump card, but Zhou Yuan similarly had his own.His trump card was Yaoyao.Long before they had entered the ruins, Zhou Yuan had told Yaoyao that he hoped she would be able to act if the situation became unfavorable and she had naturally agreed.Zhou Yuan had tried his best to control the situation since the beginning such that he would not need to borrow Yaoyao's power. However, now that the odds were beginning to fall completely in Qi Hao's favor, Zhou Yuan had no choice but to ask the little lady to act.The intense battle continued.The combined efforts of Lu Tieshan and the seven Heaven Gate experts were still not enough against the giant battle puppet python. All they could do was bitterly endure.As Qi Hao watched from far away, the smile on his face grew wider and wider.Boom!Yet another ferocious attack sent eight figures flying backwards, leaving behind several sets of deep imprints on the ground. Their clothes were in tatters, making them appear extremely ragged.Lu Tieshan said with an ashamed tone, \"Your highness, we cannot stop the battle puppet.\"Zhou Yuan nodded. He looked towards the slithering giant body that was beginning to approach, before turning his head to Yaoyao. \"Big sis Yaoyao, is there any way to deal with this giant battle puppet python?\"Yaoyao c.o.c.ked her head slightly and thought for a bit. Soon after, she let out a soft laugh. \"There is naturally a way.\"\"Eh? Big sis Yaoyao is going?\"Yaoyao shot a glance at the ugly head of the giant battle puppet python, her nose scrunching up in dislike as she shook her head. She then threw Tuntun at Zhou Yuan.\"This fellow has eaten so much of your Genesis Beast meat, it is time for it to do some work.\"Zhou Yuan was somewhat stunned at he caught Tuntun. The latter innocently stared at him with its intelligent beast eyes, causing the corners of his mouth to twitch. Allow it to go deal with that giant battle puppet python?Although he was utterly confused, due to his trust in Yaoyao, Zhou Yuan rubbed Tuntun's head and gently said, \"Good Tuntun, I'll prepare ten plates of dried Genesis Beast meat for you if you finish off that big guy!\"Having lived with Tuntun for so long, Zhou Yuan understood how to motivate this lazy little fellow.Sure enough, the moment Zhou Yuan spoke, Tuntun's laziness filled eyes immediately brightened.Hss hss!The giant battle puppet python hissed as it charged towards them. Everything in its path was crushed to pieces.Under the stupefied looks of Su Youwei, Wei Qingqing and the rest, Zhou Yuan threw Tuntun forward. The little creature somersaulted in the air and landed on the ground.\"Your highness, are you really going to let Tuntun fight that big guy?\" Su Youwei's lips were pursed as she shot a look at Zhou Yuan, eyes filled with doubt. Tuntun might be very adorable, but could it really use that adorableness to defeat the giant battle puppet python?Wei Qingqing's look was practically screaming 'how cruel'.Zhou Yuan laughed awkwardly. The only thing he knew about Tuntun was its insatiable appet.i.te. He too was unaware of how powerful it was.\"Throwing out a little beast? Are they completely out of moves?\" Qi Hao and his group were first stunned by Zhou Yuan's actions, before involuntarily bursting out into laughter.Tuntun was just too adorable and not the least bit intimidating.Rumble!However, the giant battle puppet python did not show any mercy. It ferociously rushed forward as its giant python tail slammed downwards. The astonis.h.i.+ng power contained within blowing away the air as it viciously swatted towards at Tuntun.This swat was enough to level a mountain.Su Youwei and Wei Qingqing were unable to continue watching.Boom!The python tail smashed into the ground, causing the surrounding area to collapse. Giant rocks flew outwards as cracks continuously extended.However, a sky-shaking howl suddenly rang out at this moment, shaking the surrounding trees.Bang!Everyone watched as the python's t.i.tanic body was suddenly sent flying as if it had been struck by a heavy blow.Cras.h.!.+The giant python smashed into a wall of the valley and was buried in the rubble.This abrupt scene caused everyone's faces to be filled with shock, Su Youwei's and Wei Qingqing's mouths hanging slightly open.Swis.h.!.+Every gaze in the place converged towards the spot where Tuntun was at this moment, only to see dust filling the air.Scarlet light seemed to emerge from within the dust and everyone watched in astonishment as an approximately ten feet tall beast slowly walked out from within, its heavy footsteps pounding on the ground.The giant beast's entire body was scarlet-red and covered in fiery-red scales. Its eyes looked like burning flames, and there seemed to be black light in its mouth, light that could devour all things.An alarming aura gradually spread from its body, causing the entire mountain forest to fall silent.It was as if a mysterious ferocious beast had walked out from an ancient primal era.Mysterious and ferocious.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 ContesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEveryone was stupefied as they stared at the mysterious beast that had stepped out from the smoke. Even Zhou Yuan himself was dumbstruck.Su Youwei covered her little mouth as she asked in disbelief, \"Is\u2026 is that Tuntun?\"Zhou Yuan hesitated for a moment before nodding. \"It should be.\"Although it was a little unbelievable for him to relate this mysterious and ferocious creature to the usually lazy Tuntun that did nothing but eat, his rationality told him that the intimidating beast before their eyes was indeed Tuntun\u2026Wei Qingqing mumbled in shock, \"It possess also Alpha-Origin strength\u2026\"\"Tuntun is still a child.\" Yaoyao smiled faintly.These words caused everyone to be stupefied once again. The corners of Wei Qingqing's little red mouth twitched as her heartbeat quickened. Already possessing the strength of the Alpha-Origin stage as a child?What kind of terrifying Genesis Beast was this?!Just how frightening would Tuntun become once it reached maturity?Zhou Yuan involuntarily wet his lips. Although he had known all along that Tuntun was not of ordinary origin, never in his wildest dreams would he have imagined that it would reach the Alpha-Origin stage as a child. Such a thought was just too terrifying.While Zhou Yuan's group was stunned by Tuntun's battle form, opposite them, the expressions of Qi Hao's group turned extremely ugly.\"Where did Zhou Yuan find an Alpha-Origin Genesis Beast?\" Qi Hao's voice was filled with shock. One must know that although he could control the grade 4 python-type battle puppet, it was only for a short period of time, and he could not bring the battle puppet away.In contrast, the giant beast that had appeared on Zhou Yuan's side could listen to one's commands.\"Could this be a hidden trump card of the royal clan?\" Qi Hao's eyes flickered in thought.\"Hss!\"While these thoughts churned in Qi Hao's mind, the giant battle puppet python freed itself from the rubble and hissed at Tuntun as the ancient runes on its night-black body began to glow.With a fling of its tail, a good chunk of the valley collapsed. Boulders tumbled down and were catapulted towards Tuntun with a follow-up swipe of the python's tail.As the boulders arrived, Tuntun's sharp claws swiped across the air.Chla!Cold light seemed to flash past as five scars were torn open in the air. The boulders disintegrated in the air before they could come anywhere near Tuntun.Tuntun stood on one side of the valley, its scarlet-red eyes seemingly filled with disdain as it stared at the python-type battle puppet.Roar!Tuntun roared deeply, like a king whose might was being challenged. One of its paws slammed into the ground and everyone watched as the surrounding ground swiftly began to crack and crumble.Swis.h.!.+Tuntun's figure shot forth like a flash of scarlet-red light, fast as thunder, intimidating and ferocious.The giant battle puppet python hissed and opened its huge mouth. One could only watch as a thick pillar of red Genesis Qi shot out. The Genesis Qi was fiery and berserk in nature, leaving behind black scorch marks on the ground below.The power of this Genesis Qi was enough to insta-kill any Heaven Gate stage expert.Swoos.h.!.+However, Tuntun did not slow down at all. Instead, it opened its large mouth, revealing a mysterious flickering black light within as it chomped down on the pillar of red Genesis Qi.After devouring the red Genesis Qi in a single gulp, Tuntun's figure appeared directly in front of the python-type battle puppet. Faint black light glimmered between the former's claws as it violently slashed downwards.Scree!Claw-light swept over the python-type battle puppet's enormous body as a screeching noise sounded. Next, everyone watched in astonishment as the giant battle puppet python's tail was split into two\u2026There were even five seemingly bottomless claw marks on the ground.The sharpness of Tuntun's claws was practically comparable to a high tier Black Genesis WeaponThe giant battle puppet python hissed crazily as its forked-tongue darted about madly, wildly spewing out red Genesis Qi.Tuntun fearlessly pounced forward in the face of the now out-of-control giant battle puppet python. Two t.i.tans tangled together, causing landslide after landslide in the valley.Qi Hao's expression grew exceptionally stormy when he saw this. He could naturally see that the giant battle puppet python was being suppressed by the mysterious beast, and was likely not be able to endure much longer.\"G.o.d d.a.m.nit!\"Qi Hao could not help but curse out loud. He had originally believed that the giant battle puppet python would be enough for him to control the situation, making sure that Zhou Yuan and his group would never leave this place. Who could have expected that Zhou Yuan would also have something similar up his sleeves.Qi Hao said in a low voice, \"This cannot be allowed to continue, we have to seize the Fire Spirit Grain!\"Now that the situation had spun out of his control, he had to quickly take the Fire Spirit Grain. It would be their victory once they obtained it.\"Go!\"Qi Hao delayed no further and led the charge into the valley. A large group closely followed, protecting him at the center.\"Qi Hao has made his move, we'll move out too!\" Zhou Yuan had his eyes fixed on Qi Hao since the start. Hence, the former immediately detected the latter's movement.Su Youwei, Wei Qingqing, Lu Tieshan and the rest nodded in acknowledgement.Both sides had shown all their cards. All that was left was a head-on clash.Zhou Yuan looked towards Yaoyao and said, \"Big sis Yaoyao, keep an eye on the outside of the valley and don't let anyone take advantage.\"Quite a number of factions had already gathered outside the valley, but none dared to make any moves due to the intense battle between Wei Canglan and the Black Venom King in the sky and the two giant creatures on one the side of the valley. However, they were clearly waiting for a chance, and there was no choice but to guard against them.Yaoyao gave a slight nod.Upon seeing this, Zhou Yuan led the group forward with a wave of his hand.Somewhere deeper into the valley, Qi Hao and his group had raised their speeds to the limit. With a sideway glance, he saw the closely following Zhou Yuan's group, causing the former's eyes to grow increasingly dark.\"Stop them!\"Several Heaven Gate experts led by Qi Ling immediately shot out.\"Captain Lu!\" Zhou Yuan instantly responded.\"Understood your highness!\" Lu Tieshan nodded and led several Heaven Gate experts to stop the them.The two forces clashed, Genesis Qi devastating the surrounding area, turning the valley become even more chaotic.Two parties swiftly advanced while trying to delay the other.As the core member of their groups, Zhou Yuan and Qi Hao rushed towards the bottom of the valley without pause, while the number of guards around them continuously dropped as they were dispatched to slow the other group.Soon after, only Su Youwei and Wei Qingqing were left at Zhou Yuan's side, while Qi Hao had four Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage guards.Qi Hao darkly glanced at Zhou Yuan and gave a small nod.The four Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage experts immediately moved, creating an encirclement around Zhou Yuan's three man group.\"Your highness, I will only be able to deal with two of them.\" Genesis Qi began to surge out from Wei Qingqing's body as her cold gaze locked onto two figures, an advance and initial Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage expert.\"Your highness, go get the Fire Spirit Grain. I will stop the other two.\" Su Youwei looked towards the remaining two. Both had the strength of the mid Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage.\"Will you be okay?\" Zhou Yuan hesitated for a moment. Su Youwei was only at the initial Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage, while her opponents were mid Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage experts.Su Youwei merely smiled upon hearing this and did not reply. Flame-Thunder and Niflheim Qi slowly rose from her fair hands, the glows from the two different attribute Genesis Qi giving a certain charm to her pretty face.Wei Qingqing spoke up at this moment, \"Your highness, you only need to delay Qi Hao. We will come to your aid after dealing with our opponents.\"From what she could tell, Zhou Yuan was only at the initial Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage, while Qi Hao was had already reached the advance Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage. Their fighting strength was clearly not equal.Zhou Yuan smiled, not say anything in response as he decisively shot forward.Qi Hao and Zhou Yuan were now alone, one in front, the other behind, as they charged towards the bottom of the valley.Atop the slopes of the valley, the various factions secretly shook their heads upon seeing this. Prince Zhou Yuan was really overestimating himself by chasing Qi Hao alone.An abandoned herb cultivation area lay at the bottom of the valley, where the scarlet-red flame-like Fire Spirit Grain gently swayed as it gave off a sweet fragrance.Qi Hao's figure stopped some distance away from the Fire Spirit Grain and slowly turned around, his frosty gaze locking onto Zhou Yuan as a sinister smile emerged on his face.\"Pretty brave of you to follow me without anyone's protection.\"\"Looks like no one will be able to save you today.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If the former had not opened his Qi Dwelling and advanced to the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage, it was likely that he would not be the latter's match.Unfortunately for Qi Hao, Zhou Yuan had formally stepped into the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng realm before entering the ruins, and even opened a blood colored Qi Dwelling.\"Relying on words alone, you are really deserving of your name Qi Ritian.\" Zhou Yuan chuckled.Qi Hao's face turned black with rage, his eyes overflowing with killing intent as he angrily clenched his jaw. \"Little piece of trash, just wait till I cut off your tongue when you fall into my hands later.\"\"Your younger brother Qi Hao said the same thing, but it he ended up having an arm taken away by me and now cowers in Qi Manor, too afraid to come out.\" Zhou Yuan's eyelids raised.\"Hahhaha.\"Qi Hao's intense rage turned to laughter as the killing intent in his eyes surged to even greater heights. Without further ado, his five fingers clenched into a fist as Genesis Qi began gus.h.i.+ng out from his body and covering him.The Genesis Qi around Qi Hao had a golden hue and gave off a domineering and forceful aura. It was the strongest Genesis Qi of Qi manor, grade 4 Genesis Qi, Primal Metal Qi.Although Qi Hao was rather loathsome, the strength he possessed was the real deal.With the Primal Metal Qi, he would be considered top tier amongst those of the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage.With a thought, Genesis Qi also began to gush out of Zhou Yuan's Qi Dwelling and swirled around his body.His Genesis Qi was translucent, but slivers of blood-red could be seen swimming within it.On the ridges of the valley, gaze after gaze converged on the two individuals facing each other at the bottom. When they saw the two different Genesis Qi, whispers began to spread.\"That Qi Hao should be at the advance Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage right? He's even cultivated Qi Manor's top tier Genesis Qi, the Primal Metal Qi. His battle power will definitely be very impressive.\"\"Prince Zhou Yuan's Genesis Qi\u2026 he hasn't even learnt any Qi cultivation methods?\"\"Truly akin to a young calf being unafraid of a tiger. However, it never ends up well when a calf challenge a tiger.\"\"Heh heh, if prince Zhou Yuan dies here, the Great Zhou Empire is going to become very messy.\"\"Messy is great. Only then will we from Blackwater have a better chance of plundering in the Great Zhou Empire.\"\"......\"While they whispered, a mix between gloating and pity was present in their eyes as they looked towards Zhou Yuan's figure. It was clear that they had already deemed him dead since he was facing a much stronger Qi Hao.At the bottom of the valley, Qi Hao was stunned slightly when he saw the Genesis Qi surging from Zhou Yuan's body before he sneered, \"So you've already stepped into the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage, no wonder you dare to face me alone.\"Even if Zhou Yuan had advanced to the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage, he would merely be at the initial stage, while Qi Hao was already at the advance stage.\"Moreover, this Genesis Qi of yours... could it be that you have yet to even learn a Qi cultivation method?\"\"Won't you find out once you have a taste?\" Zhou Yuan's voice was emotionless.\"Bluffing won't save you!\" Qi Hao laughed chillingly. Iciness flashed in his eyes as he pushed off the ground with the tip of his foot. Cracks spread as his figure swiftly shot towards Zhou Yuan like a flash of golden light.Qi Hao had made his move.A sparkling gold silhouette rapidly expanded in Zhou Yuan's eyes. However, the only response to Qi Hao's ferocity was a faint glimmer in Zhou Yuan's eyes. He did not chose to avoid the attack, his body remaining on the spot as the pulsations from Genesis Qi around him grew more and more violent.\"Fool, you're courting death!\"Upon seeing Zhou Yuan's lack of movement, a cold look flashed in Qi Hao's eyes. He was an advance Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage expert, and had even cultivated a grade 4 Genesis Qi, facts granting him practically complete superiority over Zhou Yuan. Hence, facing Qi Hao in a head-on clash was akin to courting death for Zhou Yuan.Boom!Qi Hao threw a punch, fist-winds rumbling like thunder as golden Genesis Qi shuddered, while the sound of metal clanging against metal seemed to echo. The punch screamed of unyielding forcefulness, and even a boulder would be shattered to dust by it.Zhou Yuan took in a deep breath, iciness flitting across his eyes as his five fingers curled and a fist was thrown forward.He wanted to test just how powerful his Dragon's Resentment Poison laced Geness Qi was.Bang!The fists of both individuals collided as a shockwave swept outwards, blowing up the dust on the ground.They were only locked in place for a few breaths, before Zhou Yuan's body was jerked backwards, his soles stepping several times on the ground before managing to forcibly steady his body. However, the Qi and blood in his body continued to churn violently.\"Advance Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage with grade 4 Genesis Qi is indeed formidable.\"Zhou Yuan's five fingers unfurled, as pain faintly echoed throughout his arm, a sign that he had been hurt. It was obvious that he had somewhat underestimated Qi Hao's power.However\u2026Zhou Yuan raised his head and looked towards Qi Hao, who was a dozen steps away. The latter should not be feeling too good either because a wisp of blood in Zhou Yuan's Genesis Qi had taken the opportunity to enter Qi Hao's body in their earlier clash.\"Truly reckless.\" Outside the valley, numerous people secretly shook their heads as they watched. An initial Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage clas.h.i.+ng directly with an advance Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage, Zhou Yuan did not seem to know how the word death was written.\"But why has Qi Hao not pressed the advantage and continue attacking?\" Someone suddenly asked in a puzzled voice. Qi Hao had not moved from the spot and showed no signs of chasing Zhou Yuan.Someone else asked, \"Could he have been injured in their earlier clash?\"Another person immediately snorted disdainfully, \"How can that be. Qi Hao is at the advance Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage and has even cultivated a grade 4 Genesis Qi. Zhou Yuan is already very lucky to survived after one punch.\"While they discussed, at the bottom of the valley, Qi Hao's body faintly trembled as golden light and a blood-red hue continuously interchanged on his face.A dozen breaths later, his body violently jerked as he spit out a mouthful of blood.Urgh!The blood landed on the ground and began to corrode it.*Uproar*!His actions naturally landed in eyes of the numerous observing parties, causing them to burst out into an uproar. Everyone was stupefied by this scene.It was suppose to have been completely one-sided, so why had Qi Hao suddenly vomited a mouthful of blood?!What exactly was going on?Qi Hao's expression was stormy as he wiped off the blood at the corner of his mouth. He looked towards Zhou Yuan and bellowed through gritted teeth. \"There's poison in your Genesis Qi?!\"Moreover, a poison so tyrannical that it made his heart s.h.i.+ver in fear. Both of them had only been in contact for a very brief moment earlier and Zhou Yuan's Genesis Qi had indeed been forcefully dispersed by Qi Hao, but at the same moment that Zhou Yuan's Genesis Qi was dispersed, a sliver of strange blood-red poison Qi had invaded Qi Hao's body.The blood-red poison Qi had immediately began to manically devour his essence blood, scaring Qi Hao silly as he frantically tried to suppress it and was eventually able to expel the poison Qi from his body.Zhou Yuan's eyes brightened a little when he saw the now somewhat disorderly state of Qi Hao's Genesis Qi. It seemed that the Dragon's Resentment Poison within his Genesis Qi was much more domineering than expected.Only a wisp had been able to invade earlier, if there was a little more, Qi Hao would probably have been killed off by the Dragon's Resentment Poison without additional help from Zhou Yuan.\"Don't you enjoy a good head-on clash? Come on, let's have another go.\" Zhou Yuan grinned.Fear flashed in Qi Hao's eyes. Zhou Yuan's Genesis Qi was no threat to the former, but the wisps of dreadful poison Qi within were extremely frightening.Qi Hao took in a deep breath, suppressing the oppressed feeling in his heart. With a grasp, a golden long spear appeared in his hand. It glowed brightly and was evidently a high tier Genesis Weapon.It was obvious that he no longer dared to clash directly against Zhou Yuan with his body, so as to safeguard against being invaded by that terrifying poison Qi.Golden long spear in hand, Qi Hao's eyes turned cold and serious as he slowly pointed the tip of the spear at Zhou Yuan.Upon seeing that Qi Hao had become cautious, a grave expression gradually surfaced on Zhou Yuan's face. He knew that a terrible battle was unavoidable if he wanted to obtain the Fire Spirit Grain today.Since that was so, let us see exactly who will kill who!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His aura rose steadily as a a suffocating pressure spread.Zhou Yuan did not underestimate the now fully serious Qi Hao and retrieved the Heavenly Yuan Brush at his waist.\"Martial form.\"Light surged on the Heavenly Yuan Brush as it transformed into a man-sized giant black brush. The hairs of the snow-white brush tip tightly bunched together, forming a flower bud shaped spear tip which gleamed coldly.Zhou Yuan wielded the Heavenly Yuan Brush, its tip pointed towards the ground at an angle as his eyes gradually turned icy.The swirling translucent Genesis Qi around his body gradually converged towards the Heavenly Yuan Brush, forming an exceptionally sharp blade at the brush tip through the amplification of the brush.Two gazes met in the air, each surging with killing intent.Bang!In the next instant, the two figures shot forward at practically the same time, colliding on the empty ground several breaths later.Clang!A golden spear and a black brush were filled with power, tearing through the air as blow after blow was exchanged, each clash accompanied by loud 'clangs'.Swis.h.!.+ Swis.h.!.+Both individuals had pushed their Genesis Qi to the limits, and every attack was filled with savageness. Spear and brush were followed by numerous after images, swift as lightning as they met again and again.In less than a minute, the two had already fought over a dozen rounds.However, anyone could tell that Qi Hao clearly had the upper hand in their exchanges. After all, he had the strength of the advance Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage and had cultivated the grade 4 Genesis Qi, Primal Metal Qi.On the other hand, Zhou Yuan was only at the initial Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage, and had yet to learn a Qi cultivation method, resulting in a less power. The fact that he could fight Qi Hao to such an extent was already pretty unimaginable.A golden spear swept forth, surging with Genesis Qi, blasting away the air around it.Clang!The spear slammed into a black brush, causing sparks to fly. The powerful force made Zhou Yuan retreat several steps as the Heavenly Yuan Brush in his hand drew a deep scar on the ground.Huu.Zhou Yuan steadied himself and breathed out deeply. The Qi and blood in his body was still violently churning after the previous clash, a feeling that made his expression grow increasingly grave.He now clearly understood that his opponent was indeed a whole lot stronger himself. Without the advantage his Qi Dwelling provided, it was likely that he would have lost long ago.Moreover, Qi Hao no longer dared to have any physical contact after having a taste of the Dragon's Resentment Poison earlier. Instead, he used the power of his Genesis Weapon to attack, giving the Dragon's Resent Poison no chance to affect him.\"If I had cultivated the Omni Python Qi from the first level of the Ancestral Dragon Scripture, I should be able to beat him even at the initial Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage.\" Zhou Yuan felt a little regret. Unfortunately for him, the grade 4 python-type Genesis beast spirit he needed was still inside the battle puppet's body.Qi Hao proudly stood with his spear as he said in a cold voice, \"To have lasted so long against me as an initial Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage that has yet to practice any Qi cultivation method is truly testament of your abilities.\"While Zhou Yuan was inwardly sighing in regret, Qi Hao was secretly astonished. Logically speaking, their cultivation levels were completely incomparable, and killing Zhou Yuan should not take more than a few rounds.Yet, Zhou Yuan had not even been heavily injured even after so many rounds. It was simply unbelievable.However, this also made Qi Hao even more certain that he had to kill Zhou Yuan. The latter was already such a problem at the initial Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage. If Zhou Yuan was allowed to reach the advance stage and practice a Qi cultivation method, Qi Hao would likely not even have the qualifications to fight the former.\"This is the best chance for me to eliminate him. I will make this valley his grave!\" Murder surged in Qi Hao's eyes as the golden long spear in his hand emitted a sharp flash.His figure shot forward once again, his spear das.h.i.+ng forward like a ray of golden light as it headed straight for Zhou Yuan.Qi Hao's attacks had grown fiercer and anyone could clearly see his intent to kill.\"Qi Hao is going to kill him.\"\"I'm afraid that prince Zhou Yuan's life is in danger.\"\"...\"Whispers broke out when the numerous parties outside the valley saw this change. Zhou Yuan had already been completely suppressed in the earlier exchanges. Now that Qi Hao's attacks had grown even fiercer, it was likely that Zhou Yuan's defeat was near.Zhou Yuan raised his head at this moment, his gaze falling upon the golden spear that was rapidly closing in on him as cold light surged in his eyes. He breathed in deeply as a glow emerged under his clothes.\"Gold Ape Moves the Mountain Rune!\"A low shout echoed in Zhou Yuan's heart as a complicated rune began to surface on his skin.Zhou Yuan's body began to shake. He could feel an astonis.h.i.+ng power explode within his body and spread to his limbs.As the power surged within him, his body seemed to grow a little bigger.Five fingers tightened around the Heavenly Yuan Brush as his foot stamped on the ground. Cracks spread as his body shot forward in a perfectly straight line, the Heavenly Yuan Brush thrusting forward, clas.h.i.+ng once again with the golden spear.Clang!Brush and spear tips ferociously collided.A ripple that could be seen with the naked eyes swept outwards, sweeping away all the loose rocks on the ground, even turning a quite a few to dust.Bang!Zhou Yuan's and Qi Hao's bodies jerked slightly at this moment, each feeling an astonis.h.i.+ng force surge towards them. The force destabilized their bodies, causing them to take a dozen shaky steps backwards.*Uproar*!This scene caused an uproar to emerge from the numerous onlookers.Because neither party had gained the upper hand in this clas.h.!.+\"How is this possible?!\" Shock surfaced in Qi Hao's eyes. He had practically gone all out in his previous attack with the intention of overwhelming Zhou Yuan. Who could have imagined that it would lead to such a result.Zhou Yuan steadied himself. In contrast to Qi Hao's shock, the former was much calmer. The Gold Ape Moves the Mountain Rune was a grade 2 Genesis Rune, and granted its user a tremendous amount of power. With this power, he was finally able to match the advance Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage Qi Hao.\"Finally filled the gap...\"Zhou Yuan gripped the Heavenly Yuan Brush as he looked towards Qi Hao and grinned. \"Let's have a good fight.\"The brush tip shook as green light suddenly poured out. The light extended a whole ten inches as its color grew deeper and deeper. It was the Auraflare technique.Qi Hao expression grew even darker as he gazed upon the flickering green light at the tip of Zhou Yuan's brush. With a jerk of the golden spear, a sharp without equal green light also surged out.Qi Hao frostily said, \"Using your Auraflare technique before me is truly reckless!\"Swis.h.!.+A chill surged through the air as their gazes met, before they both shot forward a split second later.Bang! Bang!At the bottom of the valley, two figures criss-crossed at lightning speed, spear and brush clas.h.i.+ng time after time as the aftershocks of their attacks devastated the area. Deep scars decorated the ground wherever they pa.s.sed.Both individuals had pushed themselves to their limits.Numerous gazes were gathered on the fight. The ruthlessness and viciousness of the two made several expressions change.No one had expected that the one whom they had originally thought would be easily crushed, Zhou Yuan, would be able to go so far in a direct clash against Qi Hao.\"Prince Zhou Yuan is actually rather capable.\"\"Who ends up winning or losing is really up in the air now\u2026\"\"But Qi Hao still has a greater chance at victory. After all, the Genesis Qi of an advance Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage expert is both more abundant and stronger than an initial stage pract.i.tioner like Zhou Yuan. Such a pity, such a pity indeed\u2026\"...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A clear 'clang' sound resonated from the point of contact as a shockwave swept outwards.Zhou Yuan's and Qi Hao's figures were blown backwards.Both individuals wore frosty expressions as Genesis Qi churned around their bodies. Traces of blood was visible on their skin, evidence that blood had been drawn in the intense clash earlier.From this, one could see just how desperate the battle was.Qi Hao looked at the wounds on his body and coldly chuckled. He slammed the bottom of his spear on the ground as he said in a low voice, \"Unbreakable Metal!\"As his shout faded, gold light suddenly flooded out from under his skin and gradually dyed Qi Hao's skin gold, making it look as if it was made from gold.At the same time, his wounds completely faded away.Mid grade Black Genesis Technique, Unbreakable Metal!Zhou Yuan's eyes widened when he saw this. Unbreakable Metal was a Genesis Technique that was paired with Primal Metal Qi and boasted extremely strong defensive powers.Qi Hao's trump cards were being revealed one by one as they fought.Rumble!Qi Hao's body glowed with golden light as he charged forward once again, his spear akin to a cold glittering star as it rapidly thrust at Zhou Yuan's vitals.Zhou Yuan feet performed Dragon Step, avoiding the thrusts while the brush in his hand darted towards Qi Hao's shoulder, leaving behind a streak of green light in its wake.Clang!However, a clear 'clang' rang out as the brush tip sc.r.a.ped across Qi Hao's shoulder, leaving behind a tiny red mark. The brush tip had only managed to penetrate half a fingernail before being stopped by gold light.Thud!Qi Hao laughed sinisterly as the golden long spear in his hand swept forth, slamming into Zhou Yuan's chest. The powerful force sent Zhou Yuan flying backwards into a boulder, causing cracks to grow on it.\"What a difficult opponent.\"Pain pulsed from Zhou Yuan's back as he frowned deeply. With Unbreakable Metal, Qi Hao's defence had reached an astonis.h.i.+ng level and even the Auraflare technique was unable to breakthrough.\"You really surprise me. To think that a mere initial Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage pract.i.tioner can last so long against me without exhausting your Genesis Qi.\" Qi Hao's tone was rather chilling as killing intent overflowed from his eyes.Zhou Yuan rubbed his chest. If not for his strong body, his chest would have been caved in by the earlier spear sweep.Zhou Yuan said, \"You are a little harder to deal with than expected.\"\"You should stop being so sharp-tongued when your death is so near.\" Qi Hao let out an icy chuckle. Golden Genesis Qi surged on his body as he lifted the long spear in his hand, pointed it at Zhou Yuan and said in a voice dripping with killing intent, \"You will no longer be capable of speaking next time.\"Swis.h.!.+Qi Hao's figure shot forward the moment he finished speaking, the long spear in his hand dragging across the ground, leaving a deep scar and a trial of sparks.\"Mid grade Genesis Technique, Heavenly Gold Genesis Splitter Spear!\"The killing intent in Qi Hao's eyes soared as his spear stabbed forward. The golden light on the spear flared as an extremely sharp aura condensed at its tip, an aura so sharp that the air at the spear tip could clearly been seen splitting apart.Numerous deep scars were also etched into the ground below.It was a breathtaking spear attack and was clearly Qi Hao's strongest move.Outside the valley. The expressions of the onlookers changed at this moment, evidently having felt the power of Qi Hao's spear attack. It was likely that no one amongst the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage would be able to directly receive this attack.It seemed that Qi Hao had been angered and intended to end this match with this deadly blow.\"Prince Zhou Yuan is dead meat.\" Said one of the onlookers. Qi Hao's defence was too overwhelming, allowing him to be unafraid of Zhou Yuan's attacks. In addition, Qi Hao's attacks were both ruthless and fierce. How would Zhou Yuan be able to withstand them?Numerous others nodded in complete agreement.In the valley. Zhou Yuan's expression grew increasingly grave. He breathed in deeply as the Genesis Qi in his body began to churn.In the next instant, the brush tip of the Heavenly Yuan Brush began to dance as Genesis Qi pulsed from it.Vigorous Genesis Qi poured out of Zhou Yuan's body, gathering at the tip of the brush.\"Die!\" Yelled Qi Hao as a golden spear rapidly expanded in Zhou Yuan's eyes.The c.u.mulation of Genesis Qi at the brush tip finally reached its peak. With a jerk of his arm, Zhou Yaun roared in his heart, \"Emperor Extreme Seal!\"Buzz!The brush tip trembled as the gathered Genesis Qi transformed into a dazzling ray of light, light that gave off an extremely tyrannical aura.This was the Emperor Extreme Seal that Zhou Yuan had learnt. It was also a mid grade Black Genesis Technique and boasted impressive power.Two attacks containing the full power of two individuals finally collided under the watching eyes of the many onlookers.Boom!The moment of collision was akin to a storm devastating the area. The ground below both individuals' feet was sc.r.a.ped away layer by layer, while the surrounding boulders were disintegrated to dust.\"What a crazy clash. I would never have imagined that a fight between an initial Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage and advance Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage would reach such levels.\" Numerous onlookers lamented.Bang!A shockwave filled with berserk energies exploded at the bottom of the valley, tearing open deep gorges in the ground. Zhou Yuan and Qi Hao practically received the full brunt of the impact and were sent flying as if struck by a powerful blow, before cras.h.i.+ng into the sides of the valley.Blood appeared at the corner of Zhou Yuan's mouth. He was currently in a rather miserable state with wounds all over his body, but his eyes remained cold as he looked towards his front.There, Qi Hao's figure was also embedded into the side of the valley, but he very quickly freed himself. In comparison to Zhou Yuan, the golden glow on Qi Hao's body had only dimmed substantially. It was clear that the defensive power of Unbreaker Metal had made it such that he was in a far better state than Zhou Yuan.Qi Hao suppressed the churning Qi and blood in his body before shooting a sinister gaze at Zhou Yuan.\"You're truly tenacious\u2026 to think that even this has not killed you.\"Qi Hao let out an evil laugh before continuing, \"But it seems that your injuries are pretty serious, no?\"\"Looks like you've lost. With Unbreakable Metal, my defensive capabilities far surpa.s.s your own. Hence, the one who remains standing at the end will always be me!\"Qi Hao gripped his long spear as he walked towards Zhou Yuan, the killing intent in his eyes growing greater with every step.Many inwardly shook their heads as they watched. Looks like it was over. Although Zhou Yuan's performance was perfect, it was obviously not enough against the far stronger Qi Hao.With his strong defensive ability, Qi Hao was the one who had remained standing in the end.\"What a pity\u2026\"Qi Hao slowly approached Zhou Yuan. The former could feel that the Genesis Qi in the latter's body had become much weaker. This was the best chance to kill Zhou Yuan.There was unexpectedly neither panic or fear on Zhou Yuan's face as he watched Qi Hao slowly walk towards him.Qi Hao's icy voice sounded, \"I did not expect you to have such an expression before your death. How loathsome.\"\"I just feel that you are very pitiful\u2026\" There was a faint smile on Zhou Yuan's lips.Qi Hao's pupils suddenly shrank.\"Because you still do not know who has won or lost\u2026\" Zhou Yuan's smile seemed to become somewhat strange.Qi Hao chillingly said, \"Still trying to bluff, die!\"Without any hesitation, the long spear in his hand gleamed with cold light as it mercilessly thrust towards Zhou Yuan's heart.However, Zhou Yuan showed no signs of stopping the fatal attack, his face impa.s.sive.Ch!The sharp spear tip suddenly stopped an inch away from Zhou Yuan's heart.Qi Hao's pupils frantically shrank as terror and shock emerged on his face. He had suddenly lost control of his body.\"You, what did you do?!\" Qi Hao was horrified.Zhou Yuan looked at the wounds on his body as he indifferently said, \"Do you really think that I am so stupid. I clearly knew that your defensive abilities had been boosted by Unbreakable Metal, yet why did I still choose to exchange blow after blow with you?\"Zhou Yuan gripped the Heavenly Yuan Brush beside him and slowly lifted it, pointing its sharp tip at Qi Hao.Light suddenly appeared below the Martial and Culture Rune on the mottled body of the brush as an ancient rune slowly became clear\u2026The second rune of the Heavenly Yuan Brush, Erode.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 KillPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Erode.\"Zhou Yuan stared at the second rune on the Heavenly Yuan Brush as he mumbled. Soon after, he laughed. \"Truly formidable, as expected of the Heavenly Yuan Brush.\"It had been several months since the first rune of the Heavenly Yuan Brush had been awakened. Over this period of time, Zhou Yuan had not stopped feeding it Genesis Beast spirits. Even so, the second rune had only awakened on the fifth day after entering Blackwater.The awakened rune was called Erode.Qi Hao's face was filled with terror as he howled in disbelief, \"What have you done to me?!\"Zhou Yuan glanced at him as the Heavenly Yuan Brush in his hand suddenly vibrated. One could only watch as the brush tip made a beckoning motion and Qi Hao's body began to shake violently. A miserable scream rang out from his mouth as snow-white hairs so thin that they were barely visible began to tunnel out from his pores.The hairs sparkled as if they had absorbed a large amount of Genesis Qi. Like a flock of birds returning to the nest, the hairs flew towards the tip of the Heavenly Yuan Brush.As the hairs returned, Zhou Yuan immediately felt the Genesis Qi in the Heavenly Yuan Brush begin to rise rapidly, while the flickering green light at its tip grew even sharper.Zhou Yuan looked towards Qi Hao. The latter wore an expression of horror as the golden light on his body swiftly receded. Unbreakable Metal had been dispelled.What terrified him the most however, was that the Genesis Qi in his body seemed to have been eroded and stolen away by something and was rapidly depleting.Qi Hao regained control of his body, but the fear on his face remained.Due to having his Genesis Qi depleted, a sour feeling of powerlessness began to spread within his body.Zhou Yuan gave the Heavenly Yuan Brush a little shake as he smiled, \"Every time my Heavenly Yuan Brush pierced your skin, a hair invisible to the naked eye would enter your body.\"\"These hairs concealed themselves in your blood and flesh as they secretly eroded away your Genesis Qi, seizing it as their own. They will ultimately leave with the Genesis Qi and provide it to the Heavenly Yuan Brush.\"At this point, Zhou Yuan could not help but sigh. This ability was just too frightening. The slightest negligence would result in the hairs secretly entering one's body without notice and erode away one's Genesis Qi.Most importantly, these hairs were even able to return to the Heavenly Yuan Brush and pa.s.s the stolen Genesis Qi to it, practically allowing the brush to maintain its power indefinitely.In other words, the current Heavenly Yuan Brush would still be able to display its power without any consumption of Zhou Yuan's Genesis Qi.\"It really lives up to having once been a Sacred Genesis Weapon.\" Zhou Yuan exclaimed in his heart. Although the first awakened rune was pretty unique, Zhou Yuan had not felt that the brush was truly amazing.However, now that the second rune had been awakened, the Heavenly Yuan Brush had finally began to slowly reveal how extraordinary it was.\"I wonder what kind of abilities the subsequent seven runes will possess.\" Zhou Yuan's eyes were filled with expectation. Given how out of this world the second rune was, it was difficult to imagine the power of the Heavenly Yuan Brush when it recovered all of its abilities.\"Do you understand now?\" There was a faint grin on Zhou Yuan's lips as he gazed at the terrified Qi Hao.Qi Hao's face was deathly pale. It was only at this point did he understand why Zhou Yuan had continued to exchange injuries with him even after he had brought out Unbreakable Metal. He had previously believed that Zhou Yuan was a fool, and it was only now that he realised that it had all been part of Zhou Yuan's plan.It had been for the sake of allowing the brush hairs to invade his body.No matter how strong his defences were with Unbreakable Metal, it could not defend against attacks from the inside.Zhou Yuan slowly lifted the Heavenly Yuan Brush, light pulsing at the brush tip as it pointed at Qi Hao.Fear flooded Qi Hao's face. How could he have imagined such a turn of events. He should have been able to stably maintain the upper hand, eventually crush Zhou Yuan under his heel and slowly torment the latter.Due to fear, Qi Hao no longer cared about anything else and quickly turned around, the little Genesis Qi he had frantically circulating to help him escape.Sch!However, he had only managed to take a few steps before a piercing sound rang out behind him. Qi Hao's body suddenly became rigid as he slowly lowered his head, only to find a spear tip made of snow-white brush hairs protruding from his chest\u2026The fresh blood that flowed along the snow-white hairs quickly dripped off, allowing the hairs to maintain their pristine white appearance.\"In your next life, use your head a little when you fight with others. Being overjoyed because of a small advantage will only lead to one's death.\" A cold voice echoed from behind him. In the end, Qi Hao vomited a mouthful of fresh blood, the scene before his eyes gradually turning to darkness as his body crumpled to the ground.Outside the valley, everyone fell silent at this moment. It was a long while later before a loud uproar erupted.\"Qi Hao has died?!\"\"How is this possible?! The advantage had been his all along, how was he defeated all of a sudden?!\"\"What happened?\"\".....\"Everyone was stupefied as if they had seen a ghost. A minute ago, they had been pitying Zhou Yuan because they felt he would die at Qi Hao's hands, an outcome that was reversed a minute later.\"Something seemed to have come out from Qi Hao's body earlier.\" Some of the individuals with better eyesight had managed to catch sight of some clues.\"It was likely some trick of Zhou Yuan's and Qi Hao unknowingly fell prey to it.\"These people looked to each other and ultimately gasped in surprise. No matter what trick Zhou Yuan had used, he was the ultimate victor.\"It's really hard to believe that he killed the advance Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage Qi Hao with his initial Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage strength!\"\"More importantly, he hasn't even learnt a Qi cultivation method!\"\"What a monster!\"\"To think that the Great Zhou Empire would have such an abnormal prince\u2026 looks like we have to be more careful in future.\"\"......\"Meanwhile, near the bottom of the valley, Wei Qingqing and Su Youwei had begun to dominate their fights and eventually ended them. The moment they were done, both girls simultaneously shot towards the bottom of the valley.It was clear that they were both worried about Zhou Yuan.However, when they reached the bottom of the valley, they were just in time to see Qi Hao's figure slowly fall to the ground.Behind Qi Hao was the slender figure of a handsome youth wielding the Heavenly Yuan Brush.\"Qi Hao\u2026 is dead?\" Wei Qingqing's mouth hung slightly open, disbelief all over her face as she stared at Zhou Yuan. She clearly understood just how powerful Qi Hao was, and even she herself only had a fifty percent chance of victory against him.Yet, a foe that even she had difficulty facing had died at the hands of the initial Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage Zhou Yuan?\"Your highness is truly too amazing.\" Su Youwei was not surprised at all and openly exclaimed in praise. For her, it would always make sense no matter how unbelievable a feat Zhou Yuan had accomplished.Wei Qingqing was speechless. How was this amazing, it was more apt to call it monstrous, right?Just how exactly had Zhou Yuan killed Qi Hao?While the two girls blankly stared at this scene, Zhou Yuan turned his head and grinned at them. Soon after, he involuntarily grimaced in pain due to the injuries on his body.The Heavenly Yuan Brush in his hands rapidly shrunk before being stuffed back into Zhou Yuan's waistband. He then lifted his head, looking towards the fire-like Fire Spirit Grain as he breathed a sigh of relief as if a heavy burden had been removed from his shoulders.The Fire Spirit Grain had finally been obtained.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88 Fire Spirit Grain ObtainedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAt the bottom of the valley, Zhou Yuan's eyes were filled with excitement as he stared at the gently swaying Fire Spirit Grain. Moments later, he pushed down the intense emotions in his heart and quickly walked forward.He retrieved a man-sized jade pot from his Universe bag which had several Genesis Qi preservation runes inscribed upon it.Next, he retrieved a shovel and very carefully began to transfer the dirt around the Fire Spirit Grain into the jade pot. He did not dare to make any big motions, afraid that he might damage its roots.Under Zhou Yuan's meticulous work, the soil around the Fire Spirit Grain was cleaned out. He then very carefully lifted the plant and placed it into the jade pot, before filling the rest of the pot with the dirt from before.Zhou Yuan was already perspiring profusely by the time he was done. It felt even more exhausting than the intense battle against Qi Hao.Zhou Yuan gazed at the Fire Spirit Grain in the pot, the plump Fire Spirit kernels on it glowing faintly. Although there was only one stalk, it could be replanted to obtain more seeds.However, it was said that a special method was required to grow new seeds for a Genesis Food of this rank which needed to be planted within a certain radius of the original Fire Spirit Grain. Any new seeds that left this radius would wither and die, making it unable to be harvested.\"Is this the Fire Spirit Grain?\" Wei Qingqing and Su Youwei crowded over, their curious eyes locking onto the fiery-red plant swaying in the jade pot.Zhou Yuan grinned and nodded. \"The general's faction has done a great service this time. When the Fire Spirit Grain matures in future, there will definitely be a share for you guys.\"Wei Qingqing smiled. \"Then I shall give my thanks your highness first. I've actually never eaten a grade 4 Genesis Food before and I imagine that its effect will be rather special.\"When Zhou Yuan saw that Su Youwei was still fixed on the Fire Spirit Grain, he chuckled and said, \"Don't worry, you will also have a share.\"Su Youwei blushed slightly and hastily tried to explain, \"I, I was just wondering how it will taste, I don't really need a share.\"While they were conversing, the numerous factions outside the valley could not help but grow somewhat restless upon seeing Zhou Yuan collect the Fire Spirit Grain. After all, everyone knew its value. Even if not used by oneself, it could be sold for an unimaginable price. In fact, any faction that had ambition would be willing to sell off everything they had in order to purchase it.Hence, some of the stronger pract.i.tioners began to stir as Genesis Qi rose around their bodies.This was the time when Zhou Yuan's party was at its weakest. If one was able to enter, one would definitely be able to seize the treasure and run off.However, while these thoughts churned in these individuals' minds, Yaoyao's indifferent gaze swept over from the top of the valley. With a grasp of her fair hand, a scroll appeared within it.The scroll slowly unfurled, revealing a complicated Genesis Rune. The surrounding Genesis Qi frantically began to gather towards the scroll as if drawn in by something.Yaoyao's fair hand trembled as the scroll was sent flying and a dazzling radiance soon exploded.Rumble!The Genesis Qi collected by the rune transformed into a black cloud. Lightning flashed within the billowing black cloud as a suffocating pressure spread.Outside the valley, the expressions of the now restless experts immediately changed when they saw this as they cried out in horror, \"Grade 4 Genesis Rune?!\"It was definitely a grade 4 Genesis Rune or it would not give off such an alarming pressure.Gaze after gaze was filled with terror as they turned towards the breathtakingly beautiful young girl in green atop the valley. No one would have ever imagined that the girl from which they could not feel even the slightest Genesis Qi undulations would have such terrifying mastery over Genesis Runes.The black cloud hung over the valley, thunder rumbling. It intimidated all of the experts from the various factions, causing them to not dare to try anything funny. They knew that the black cloud would blast them with lightning if they took even a single step forward.In the face of such attacks, even Heaven Gate experts would be easily struck down one by one regardless of how many were sent.At the bottom of the valley, Zhou Yuan also detected the disturbance outside the valley and coldly snorted. He swiftly kept the jade pot in his Universe bag and said, \"Let's go have a look at the situation.\"His figure took the lead, das.h.i.+ng forward and eventually arriving at one side of the valley.Zhou Yuan's gaze first turned towards Tuntun's battlefield where the activity was the greatest.However, he was immediately startled by what he saw. Amongst the rubble, there was only ten feet left of the battle puppet python's originally t.i.tanic body. A good half of its body had already been torn away.The only saving grace was that it was a battle puppet that was unable to feel any pain, or it would have long died to the pain.On the other hand, the current Tuntun resembled a cat toying with a mouse, slapping the giant battle python puppet around as if it was a ball. The battle puppet python was sent flying towards the sides of the valley time and time again, a sight that made one involuntarily s.h.i.+ver in fear.\"Tuntun is really frightening!\" Su Youwei could not help but utter when she was this scene. To think that the normally lazy and extremely adorable little creature would become so savage in its battle form.The corners of Zhou Yuan's mouth twitched. He was feeling a little insecure as he recalled the times when he had reduced the portions of Tuntun's meals. Would he not be filled with grievance if by some chance the little beast was angered, grew big and swatted him to death with a single swipe?\"Looks like I can't cut its food portions in future.\" Zhou Yuan sighed.By this time, Tuntun seemed to have grown bored of playing. Black light swirled around its claws as it suddenly slashed downwards, tearing open the giant battle puppet python's head with a piercing noise.The giant battle puppet python finally fell to the ground. Tuntun's large claw pushed open its head, revealing a human head sized sparkling crystal. The silhouette of a giant python could be seen inside this crystal.It was its beast spirit.Tuntun stared at the beast spirit crystal, clearly desiring to devour it.When Zhou Yuan saw this, he was immediately spooked out of his mind and loudly yelled, \"May your mouth have mercy!\"His figure quickly shot forward and landed at Tuntun's side.Tuntun jumped a little in fright and surprise due to Zhou Yuan's sudden yell. The latter took the opportunity to swiftly dash to the beast spirit crystal and keep it into his Universe bag.Obtaining the grade 4 python-type beast spirit had been one of his objectives for entering Blackwater. Now that it had been obtained after much difficulty, he would be truly dumbfounded if he were to allow Tuntun to swallow it.Just imagine how much time would be wasted if he had to find a second grade 4 python-type beast spirit.Tuntun lowered its head and was immediately enraged when it saw that the beast spirit crystal had been taken by Zhou Yuan. It roared at Zhou Yuan. To think that this fellow dared to s.n.a.t.c.h away its food.\"One hundred plates of meat!\"Zhou Yuan immediately shouted In response to Tuntun's angry roar.Tuntun's roaring stopped as its eyes seemed to flicker with thought. It began to calculate how much meat a hundred plates was worth and eventually nodded its head, indicating that it had agreed to this transaction.Zhou Yuan breathed a sigh of relief and patted Tuntun's paw in satisfaction. Now that the grade 4 python-type Genesis Beast spirit had been obtained, he could finally begin to cultivate the first level of the Ancestral Dragon Scripture, the Omni Python Qi.Once he succeeded, his battle power would undoubtedly soar, making it difficult to find a worthy opponent amongst those of the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage.After the battle between Tuntun and the giant battle puppet python ended, the situation was now completely in Zhou Yuan's favor. It was also at this time that Qi Ling discovered the cruel reality that Qi Hao had been killed by Zhou Yuan.Qi Ling's eyes turned completely red, but he still decisively waved his hand and shouted, \"Retreat!\"The moment his voice rang out, acrid smoke exploded from under the entire group's legs and their figures swiftly vanished.Zhou Yuan was indifferent towards their escape. His gaze was fixed onto a certain individual in the distant sky who was still stuck in a battle with a relentless Wei Canglan.The Black Venom King was a malignant tumor to the Great Zhou Empire, often infringing upon their borders to plunder and kill. Who knew just how many of the Great Zhou Empire's citizens had died at his hands.This was the best chance to eliminate him and bring peace to the Great Zhou Empire's borders.Iciness flashed in Zhou Yuan's eyes before he patted Tuntun's paw, pointed towards the Black Venom King and slowly said, \"Tuntun, he's worth two hundred plates of meat!\"Dazzling light instantly blossomed in Tuntun's eyes when it heard this. It immediately locked onto the rapidly s.h.i.+fting figure of the Black Venom King in the air as if it was looking at plates of meat dancing in the sky.Roar!Tuntun let out a roar towards the sky as its paw pushed off the ground, transforming into a flash of fiery light as it soared into the air....Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89 SurrenderPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRoar!Scarlet-red Genesis Qi rose below Tuntun's feet. The scarlet-red Genesis Qi seemed to be tinged with patches of black light, making it appear rather mystical.The vigorous Genesis Qi under Tuntun's four paws lifted it into the air as it transformed into a flash of scarlet light that shot straight towards the Black Venom King.Such aggressiveness was naturally detected straight away by the Black Venom King. His gaze swept over and was narrowly shocked out of his body. His battle was Wei Canglan was currently in a stalemate, hence the addition of an even more ferocious Genesis Beast would cause him to be at a complete disadvantage.Although he had previously been locked in battle with Wei Canglan, he had seen how the giant battle puppet python had been torn apart. Thus, he clearly understood just now terrifying this mysterious Genesis Beast was.\"You dare to let yourself be distracted in a battle with me?!\" However, while the Black Venom King's heart churned, Wei Canglan's icy chuckle cut through the air as a fist filled with sharp golden Genesis Qi viciously punched towards the former's fatal spots.Buzz!The Black Venom King's sleeve jerked as black Genesis Qi came pouring out, blocking the golden Genesis Qi. However, his body was also pushed backwards.\"Why the need to be so hostile general Wei, all of this is part of Qi Manor's scheme!\" The Black Venom King hurriedly said. His tone was one of submission, evidently already well aware of how terrible his current situation was.\"Heh, tell that to the big guy behind you!\" A smile was revealed on Wei Canglan's face.The Black Venom King's heart s.h.i.+vered, immediately sensing the foul smell that was a.s.saulting his back. He hastily turned around, his palms seemingly dancing as vigorous Genesis Qi gathering towards them and a strike was sent flying, \"Poison Devil Palm!\"Bang!Claws suffused with black light swung towards the palm containing powerful poison, both forces slamming into each other.Boom!A loud noise resounded in the air as the Black Venom King's body was sent flying like a cannonball. He crashed into a hill, causing the entire head of the hill to collapse.In the air, Tuntun was also pushed half a step back. Foul-smelling black Qi twined around its paw as if attempting to burrow into its body.*Cough*The Black Venom King slowly rose from the rubble. There were five deep and b.l.o.o.d.y gorges on his chest, proof that he had been injured by Tuntun. A venomous look was revealed in his eyes as he looked towards Tuntun.\"What a brainless brute, to think that it dares to allow my poison touch its body!\"However, as this thought flashed in his head, Tuntun suddenly lowered its head, opened its mouth and sucked, swallowing the black poison Qi on its paw into its body.Huu.Tuntun shook its head, black mist spewing from its nose as it roared in anger, evidently very unhappy with the poison Qi's smell.The venomous look on the Black Venom King's face instantly froze as he stared in disbelief at Tuntun. He never imagined that his invincible Devil Miasma Poison would have no effect on Tuntun.Evidently, Tuntun's poison resistance far surpa.s.sed his expectations.Roar!However, Tuntun had already been infuriated by the bad tasting poison Qi and its scarlet-red eyes quickly locked onto the Black Venom King. It rode on its scarlet-red Genesis Qi as it shot forward once again, pouncing towards the Black Venom King.Wei Canglan took this opportunity to beat a dog while it was drowning, golden Genesis Qi whizzing forth as he began to seal off all the Black Venom King's escape routes.In the sky, the Black Venom King miserably fled and dodged, while Tuntun and Wei Canglan blocked off the former's escape routes one by one, slowly forcing him into a dead end.\"Your highness, I admit defeat. As long as you let me leave, I will restrict the many factions of Blackwater and ensure that none of them even dream about infringing the Great Zhou Empire's borders!\" Death imminent, fear finally began to bubble in the Black Venom King as he hurriedly shouted in Zhou Yuan's direction.The numerous factions outside the valley kept silent out of fear when they saw the Black Venom King, who was practically unstoppable in Blackwater, being pushed so far. No one dared to harbour even the slightest ill-intent.Those that were originally wondering if it was possible to steal the Fire Spirit Grain also rationally dispelled such thoughts.Zhou Yuan's expression was cold and indifferent. The Black Venom King had done so much harm to the Great Zhou Empire, how could Zhou Yuan let the latter off so easily?Thus, he did not stop Wei Canglan and Tuntun.As if sensing Zhou Yuan's intent to kill him, the Black Venom King's fear intensified. He threw away all other thoughts and hurriedly said, \"Your highness, I am willing to submit to the royal clan and work for them!\"Only then did Zhou Yuan's indifferent expression ripple slightly. The Black Venom King was after all an Alpha-Origin expert. If he sided with the royal clan, it would undoubtedly be a huge boost to their power.Wei Qingqing earnestly reminded when she heard this.\"Your highness, that fiend is vicious and cunning. Be careful of being betrayed.\"The general's faction had fought far too many times with the Black Venom King and knew just how sly he could be.Zhou Yuan nodded in acknowledgement. He was naturally aware of this. Hence, he moved to Yaoyao's side and asked, \"Big sis Yaoyao, is there any way to control him such that he will not harbour any thoughts of backstabbing in future?\"Yaoyao pondered for a while, before her snow-white chin gently nodded. \"There naturally is, but the precondition is that the Black Venom King cannot put up even the slightest resistance, or the method will not succeed.\"Zhou Yuan nodded, lifted his head towards the Black Venom King and said in a cold voice, \"If you really mean it, give up on all resistance and allow me to deal with you.\"The Black Venom King's eyes flashed as hesitation flitted across his face. Abandoning all resistance was akin to putting his life in Zhou Yuan's hands.\"It seems that you are not willing. Since that is so, go accompany the slaughtered citizens of Great Zhou.\" Iciness flowed in Zhou Yuan's eyes.Tuntun's and Wei Canglan's attacks immediately grew increasingly ferocious.The Black Venom King was steadily forced into a corner, the smell of death growing increasingly closer in his heart. In the end, he gritted his teeth and yelled, \"Your highness, I submit!\"The moment he said these words, the Genesis Qi around him rapidly receded into his body.Swis.h.!.+Wei Canglan's figure appeared in front of the Black Venom King as a palm strike was sent flying towards his chest.Urgh.The Black Venom King vomited a mouthful of fresh blood as his body fell from the sky, cras.h.i.+ng into the ground in front of Zhou Yuan and the rest. The former's face was deathly pale, showing that he had been seriously injured.The Black Venom King ignored the intense pain from his body and hurriedly said, \"Your highness, your highness, I submit!\"Wei Canglan landed beside Zhou Yuan, a guarded look on his face as he stared at the Black Venom King.Tuntun also descended as its giant body rapidly began to shrink. It eventually returned its usual appearance and jumped into Yaoyao's arms.However, it was obvious that no one dared to underestimate it even in this form. Even Wei Canglan's gaze was filled with wariness when he looked at it.\"If you intend to submit, I will do something to you such that you will no longer be able to entertain any thoughts of rebelling.\" Zhou Yuan's tone was indifferent as he stared at the Black Venom King.Upon hearing these words, the Black Venom King's heart jumped as unease rose within him. However, under Wei Canglan's and Tuntun's watching eyes, the former ultimately forced himself to nod. At the end of the day, preserving his life was the best course of action.\"Restrain the Genesis Qi in your body and do not circulate it. Also, make sure that you have no thoughts of resistance.\" Zhou Yuan's tone was cold as he continued, \"This technique can only be used once. If it does not succeed\u2026 you will die.\"The Black Venom King s.h.i.+vered as he listened to Zhou Yuan's murder-laced words.Zhou Yuan then looked towards Yaoyao and saw her give a slight nod before she slowly walked forward, jade-green Genesis Brush in hand. The brush tip stopped three inches before the spot between the Black Venom King's brows and began to draw. An extremely complex Genesis Rune began to slowly take shape.A long time later, the completed Genesis Rune slowly descended, landing between the Black Venom King's brows. It slowly submerged into his skin, leaving behind a green rune.Yaoyao glanced at the Black Venom King and said, \"This is known as the Spirit Locking Son-Mother Rune. If you have any thoughts of rebelling, activating the mother rune will instantly destroy your Spirit.\"The Black Venom King was ashen-faced. He had evidently sensed something lock onto his Spirit.Yaoyao pa.s.sed a piece of jade to Zhou Yuan on which an even more complicated Genesis Rune was carved. \"This is the mother rune. If you find any disloyalty in him, shatter the jade and he will die.\"Zhou Yuan felt a little happy as he grasped the jade. He looked towards the Black Venom King and said, \"Since that is so, you will work for the Great Zhou Empire in future. This may also be considered a form of atonement for the numerous innocents that died at your hands.\"The Black Venom King's expression was a mix between crying and smiling when he heard this. In the end, he could only nod. As the saying went, better a bad life than a good death, living was still better than dying.\"Understood your highness!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90 Left Behind TreasuresPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe great battle in the valley had finally ended with the surrender of the Black Venom King. The Great Zhou royal clan Zhou Yuan represented was clearly the biggest winner of this affair.Outside the valley, the other factions tactfully withdrew one after another upon seeing this. After all, Qi Manor had been defeated and even the Black Venom King had submitted.The royal clan's power will definitely soar to astonis.h.i.+ng levels after this event.In the face of such a powerful royal clan, there were no longer any factions in Blackwater that could match the former.\"Congratulations your highness.\" Wei Canglan withdrew his Genesis Qi and cupped his fists together towards Zhou Yuan.It was clear that Zhou Yuan had grown even more important in Wei Canglan's eyes, and there was even a trace of respect in his tone. After all, besides the mysterious giant beast and grade 4 Genesis Rune proficient Yaoyao, there was now an additional Black Venom King at Zhou Yuan's side.These three were comparable to Alpha-Origin experts.Such strength could easily subdue the entire Great Zhou Empire. The truth was, the most important reason why Wei Canglan had been able to ignore the imperial edicts was because the royal clan only had one Alpha-Origin expert, Zhou Qing.This number had now shot up to four.Hence, if the royal clan wanted to, the great general's faction could be easily disappear.The balance of power between both parties was no longer equal, and Wei Canglan was naturally not foolish enough to treat Zhou Yuan in the same manner as before.\"Great general's help was paramount to the success in obtaining the Fire Spirit Grain. After I return, I will make sure that your service will not be forgotten. When the Fire Spirit Grain is cultivated in future, great general's residence will definitely have a share.\" Zhou Yuan cupped his fists together towards Wei Canglan.\"Then I'll take this chance to thank your highness first.\"Wei Canglan chuckled. Soon after, his expression grew solemn as he said, \"However, due to Qi Manor's failure and the fact that Qi Hao has been killed by your highness, Qi Manor will not take this lying down.\"Zhou Yuan let out an icy chuckle. \"The ones that will not let this matter rest should be us.\"Previously, Zhou Qing had been very patient and accommodating because the royal clan's power was equal to Qi Manor's. If they clashed, it would be a huge blow to the Great Zhou Empire. However, after the events of Blackwater, the royal clan's power would undoubtedly rise sharply, making it the best opportunity for them to completely eradicate this malignant tumor of the Great Zhou Empire.Wei Canglan's heart s.h.i.+vered slightly at the coldness in Zhou Yuan's tone. He knew that the royal clan would soon begin hostilities against Qi Manor.\"Great general, Qi Manor has been harbouring thoughts of rebelling. If a war breaks out, I hope that you will be able to lend us your aid.\" Zhou Yuan's expression was earnest as he looked towards Wei Canglan.Wei Canglan hesitated for a split second. In the past, he had refused to interfere in the struggle between the royal clan and Qi Manor. However, this hesitation quickly faded. Since he had already helped Zhou Yuan in the contest for the Fire Spirit Grain, it was likely that Qi Manor already viewed him as part of the royal clan's camp, making him a thorn in their side. Therefore, why not fully side with the royal clan and aid them in eliminating the threat known as Qi Manor.Wei Canglan replied in a solemn voice, \"Don't worry your highness, if it is needed, the great general's residence will do all we can to exterminate the rebels.\"Zhou Yuan sighed in relief upon hearing Wei Canglan's promise. With his aid, the royal clan's power would rise once again.Zhou Yuan looked towards the rest and smiled, \"The Fire Spirit Grain is already ours, let's leave.\"Everyone nodded. Yaoyao however cast her gaze towards the bottom of the valley and suddenly asked, \"Have you collected all of the treasure?\"Zhou Yuan was taken aback. \"The Fire Spirit Grain is already in our hands.\"Yaoyao gently stroked Tuntun's fur as her red lips parted slightly, \"The Battle Puppet Sect is a rather decent sect, their ruins are likely not as simple as your imagine.\"Zhou Yuan was utterly confused. However, he seemed to have caught a hold something amongst Yaoyao's words and probed, \"Are there other undiscovered treasures here?\"Surprise surfaced in the eyes of everyone else.Yaoyao said, \"You'll know once you have a look.\"After which, she walked forward towards the bottom of the valley. Zhou Yuan and the rest looked to each other before quickly following.'The group advanced towards the bottom of the valley.Their footsteps eventually came to a stop just outside the abandoned herb cultivation field where Zhou Yuan had dug up the Fire Spirit Grain.Zhou Yuan's eyes darted everywhere, but all he found were the rather desolate bare walls of the valley. There were no traces of anything out of the ordinary.Wei Canglan's gaze also scanned the area and was likewise unable to discover anything. Thus, they could only turn their doubtful gazes towards Yaoyao.\"Are there really other treasures here?\" Zhou Yuan was a little skeptical.Yaoyao ignored him as she walked forward into the abandoned herb cultivation field. She squatted down and gently rubbed the ground as she closed her eyes.Upon seeing this, no one dared to make any noise.Several minutes later, Yaoyao opened her eyes and pointed towards the large hole that had been left behind after Zhou Yuan had dug out the Fire Spirit Grain earlier and said, \"Continue digging there.\"Zhou Yuan was somewhat puzzled. He was the one who had dug that hole, and had not felt any peculiar undulations from below. However, he still nodded towards Lu Tieshan and the rest due to his trust in Yaoyao.Thus, Lu Tieshan and a few Heaven Gate experts moved forward began to circulate their Genesis Qi, sending waves of Genesis Qi into the hole to dig deeper and deeper.Layers of soil were sent flying and the originally six feet deep hole very quickly became over thirty feet deep. If one looked in, all one would see was pitch-black darkness.Buzz!As one of the Heaven Gate experts shot out another stream of Genesis Qi into the soil, a sound was heard as something had been struck. Light suddenly emerged from the depths of the hole, blasting away the Heaven Gate expert with a 'bang', causing him to slam into one of the valley walls.This sudden turn of events stunned everyone.\"It's a Genesis Rune boundary!\" Zhou Yuan's eyes flickered brightly as he stared at the bottom of the pitch-black hole. When the light appeared earlier, he had sensed a very faint pulse from inside.\"Let's go down and take a look.\"Everyone carefully descended into the pit. They quickly discovered a barrier stretching over one corner of the pit where a bronze door stood.Wei Canglan uttered in astonishment, \"I never imagined that there would be such a thing below the herb cultivation field.\"Zhou Yuan also gasped in surprise. The barrier outside of the bronze door was a Genesis Rune boundary that both protected and sealed off any undulations. No wonder he was unable to detect it before.Thank G.o.d for Yaoyao's powerful Spirit perception, or no one would have realised that there were still treasures under the herb cultivation field.\"This Genesis Rune boundary seems to be very powerful.\" Wei Canglan's expression was grave as he stared at the barrier. Even someone as powerful as himself could feel an extremely fatal sensation from it.Yaoyao observed the barrier as she explained, \"This is a special Genesis Rune boundary, and a very specific Genesis Rune is needed to open it. Forcibly opening it would cause it to self-destruct, turning the trespa.s.ser and the treasures inside to nothingness.\"\"If it self-destructs, I'm afraid that nothing within a hundred mile radius will survive.\"Upon hearing her words, everyone's hearts trembled as they involuntarily took several steps backwards. Even Zhou Yuan was a little frightened.\"Looks like it's hopeless for us.\" Zhou Yuan smiled bitterly. It was likely that only the most high-ranking members of the Battle Puppet Sect knew of the special Genesis Rune, let alone people like themselves.Without the special Genesis Rune, they would not be able to open the barrier regardless of how capable they were.Everyone else nodded in agreement as feelings of regret rose within them. A treasure mountain stood before their eyes, but none of them could enter.However, while everyone was feeling regret, Yaoyao suddenly grinned.\"That may not be so\u2026\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 Underground PalacePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"That may not be so\u2026\"The moment these words left Yaoyao's mouth, Zhou Yuan, Su Youwei, Wei Canglan and the rest immediately cast their gazes towards her, looks of bewilderment on their faces. Could it be that Yaoyao was able to decipher even a Genesis Rune boundary like this?As if she could read their minds, Yaoyao shook her head and said, \"One needs to have at the minimum mastered grade 5 Genesis Runes to attempt deciphering this Genesis Rune boundary. The current me is unable to do so.\"Everyone was even more confused after hearing this. Since she was unable to decipher it, what other method was there?Yaoyao said in an offhand manner, \"Won't we be able to open it as long as we have that special rune?\"Everyone forced a smile and shook their heads. Why would they be standing around if they knew the special rune?However, Su Youwei's eyes glimmered at this moment as she asked, \"Does big sis Yaoyao know the special rune?\"Yaoyao carefully inspected the runes on the Genesis Rune boundary. A while later, she finally nodded. \"It seems that I was correct.\"As she spoke, she tapped the Universe bag at her waist and a black jade tile appeared in her hand.Zhou Yuan was taken aback when he saw the black jade tile. It was the item he had payed an unfair price of twenty thousand Genesis crystals previously in Devil Prison City.He looked towards Yaoyao in disbelief. \"Is the Genesis Rune on the black jade tile the key to open this Genesis Rune boundary?\"If so, his twenty thousand Genesis crystals were very well spent indeed.\"It should be.\" Yaoyao touched the somewhat faded Genesis Rune on the jade tile. \"I shall give it a try.\"She turned her head slightly and looked towards the others as she said, \"All of you withdraw from the ruins first such as to prevent the worst case scenario. I'm unsure of what changes have occurred to the Genesis Rune boundary after so many years have pa.s.sed, so I cannot ascertain if anything unexpected will happen.\"After hearing this, even Wei Canglan felt that he should comply. After all, the dangerous sensation from the Genesis Rune boundary was just a little too overwhelming.Zhou Yuan opened his mouth and said with a smile, \"You guys wait outside the ruins. I will stay here.\"Lu Tieshan hastily spoke up upon hearing this, \"Your highness.\"Zhou Yuan waved his hand before looking towards Yaoyao. \"I believe in big sis Yaoyao's ability.\"Yaoyao cast a glance at him, her eyebrows curling as she teased, \"More like you're afraid that I will secretly take all the treasures.\"Zhou Yuan rolled his eyes in response.\"I will also stay behind.\" Su Youwei lifted a fair little hand. No fear could be seen on her small and pretty face.Zhou Yuan did not object and looked towards the rest to urge them to leave. Wei Canglan and the rest ceased resisting and withdrew from the pit one by one.After everyone left, Yaoyao grasped her jade-green Genesis Rune Brush as her expression turned serious. She stared at the glowing Genesis Rune boundary before her for a few seconds, before the tip of her brush suddenly descended.The brush tip flowed like water as stroke after stroke emerged in a unique rhythm.Zhou Yuan and Su Youwei stood behind her, their expressions grave, heartbeat quickening as they watched the complicated Genesis Rune slowly take shape.After all, a single mistake might cause the Genesis Rune boundary to go haywire, which would undoubtedly be a disaster for all of them.The atmosphere in the deep pit was suffocatingly silent. The only noise that could be heard was the very soft movement of Yaoyao's Genesis Rune Brush.This silence lasted for a long time before the Genesis Rune was finally completed. The extremely complicated rune slowly descended and eventually came into contact with the Genesis Rune boundary.Zhou Yuan, Yaoyao and Su Youwei did not dare to blink as they stared at the Genesis Rune boundary.Buzz buzz!Under their gazes, the Genesis Rune boundary soon began to ripple violently, waves of berserk undulations pulsing. This caused Zhou Yuan's expression to change slightly, under the impression that the boundary was about to explode.Fortunately, this only continued for a dozen breaths before gradually calming down.Next, the trio watched in joy and surprise as the Genesis Rune boundary slowly began to part, revealing a way through.Su Youwei joyfully blurted out, \"It worked!\"Yaoyao gently stroked her fair cheek as a faint smile rose on her lips.\"Awesome!\" Zhou Yuan gave a thumbs-up to Yaoyao.\"Go open the door.\" Yaoyao hoisted her sharp little chin.Zhou Yuan walked forward, placed his hand on the ice-cold bronze door and gave a little push. A creaking sound could be heard as the bronze door that had been tightly shut for many many years slowly cracked open.As the bronze door was pushed open, dusky yellow light peered through.The trio cautiously walked in.Behind the door was what appeared to be a s.p.a.cious underground palace. Though it had been sealed for a long time, there was still fresh air flowing through. The first sight that greeted them was the countless silhouettes silently seated within.\"Are all of these\u2026 battle puppets?!\" Zhou Yuan's expression immediately changed. He had discovered that these battle puppets were similar to those they had encountered before, only they appeared even more high-cla.s.s.\"No need to panic, the cores of these battle puppets are in a dormant state. Moreover, they have not been given any commands. In other words, they are masterless puppets.\" A single look was all that was needed for Yaoyao understand the state of the battle puppets here.Zhou Yuan gasped upon hearing this. All masterless puppets? Did this not mean that the royal clan had a chance to control them?\"There are no less than ten thousand battle puppets here!\" Zhou Yuan's eyes widened in shock. If the royal clan possessed an army of ten thousand battle puppets, their power would undoubtedly soar.Yaoyao said, \"However, you won't be able to gain control of them in the short term. Several experts proficient in Genesis Runes will be required to personally activate them one by one. Thus, a tremendous amount of time is needed to gain control of this army.\"Zhou Yuan regretfully shook his head after hearing this. If the royal clan could swiftly gain control over this battle puppet army, sweeping away Qi Manor would be too easy.However, he could still inform his father about this matter, letting the latter secretly send some people to take charge of this task and eventually take full control of the battle puppet army.While the trio were conversing, they pa.s.sed through the underground palace and arrived at the front of the battle puppet army where a stone platform stood. On the stone platform were three jade cases.Zhou Yuan cautiously walked forward and carefully lifted open one of the cases.Buzz!A flash of light immediately escaped from the case, revealing itself to be a crystal. The crystal emitted rays of light that gathered into a screen if light before them.On the light screen was a ten thousand mile long mountain range where an endless procession of buildings stood.Countless battle puppets could be seen amongst the structures, while numerous figures busily shuttled around. It was clearly a scene from the time when the Battle Puppet Sect still existed. Such grandness and magnificence proved just how powerful the sect had been.Rumble!The scene suddenly changed. It was as if all color had faded from the world as s.p.a.ce was torn open high up in the sky and a dazzling figure slowly flew out.The body of this figure was suffused with sacred and holy light. His eyes were completely void of any emotion, while a vertical blood red scar was embedded between his brows.The moment this figure appeared, a terrifying pressure seemed to descend from the sky, causing the many mountain peaks to crumble while drawing countless fear-filled gazes.The figure indifferently looked down from high up in the sky as an emotionless voice resounded across the land.\"The prides of our Sacred race have died here. I declare this place a sinful land that shall receive holy punishment. All life within an eighty thousand mile radius shall be destroyed.\"The voice was full of destruction. As it faded, endless heavenly lightning fell from the sky causing the entire place to swiftly disintegrate.It was a bombardment nearly akin to punishment from the heavens. The only fate for the Battle Puppet Sect was to be turned to ashes.Heavenly lightning descended, leaving only death within an eighty thousand mile radius.Zhou Yuan watched in horror as his heart violently shuddered. The scenes depicted were very likely what had happened many years ago in Blackwater. Was this how the numerous ancient factions of that era had been annihilated?Why was the human figure that glowed with sacred light so terrifying? A single sentence was all it took to destroy every living creature within an eighty thousand mile radius.Could it be? Just because a few talented geniuses of this so-called Sacred race had died here, all life had been sentenced to death in punishment?While Zhou Yuan and Su Youwei were in shock, neither saw the icy coldness that even Yaoyao herself did not detect flit across her eyes as she stared at the glowing figure.She suddenly reached out a head as a nine-color lotus flower jade pendant appeared within it.Light seemed to flash across the usually dormant nine-color jade pendant at this moment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Only when the light screen faded a long time later did they finally return to their senses.\"What a cruel punishment. To think that he would annihilate all life within an eighty thousand mile radius.\" Zhou Yuan's voice was somewhat downcast.\"All because geniuses from their Sacred race died here.\" Su Youwei's face had turned a little pale. The actions of this so-called Sacred race were just too tyrannical and heartless.Zhou Yuan had a grim expression as he slowly mumbled, \"Just what exactly is the Sacred race. To think that they have the power to wipe out all life within eighty thousand miles with a few simple words.\"This world was too vast and there were still too many things he did not know.As he sighed in his heart, Zhou Yuan looked towards Yaoyao and was immediately taken aback. The latter's bright eyes seemed to be filled with a chillingly cold aura at this moment.\"Big sis Yaoyao?\" Zhou Yuan hurriedly called out to her.Upon hearing Zhou Yuan's voice, Yaoyao seemed to come back to her senses. The iciness in her eyes faded, replaced by confusion as she looked towards Zhou Yuan and asked, \"What is it?\"Zhou Yuan awkwardly scratched his head in response. Had his eyes been playing tricks on him earlier?\"It seems that the images in the crystal were recorded when the Battle Puppet Sect was wiped out.\" Zhou Yuan decided not to overthink things as his gaze quickly turned towards the other two jade cases.\"These two cases shouldn't contain recording stones too right?\"Muttered Zhou Yuan before he once again carefully opened the second jade case.Swis.h.!.+The instant he opened the case, a flash of black-white light suddenly shot out, its speed akin to lightning.This sudden turn of events startled Zhou Yuan. The Heavenly Yuan Brush in his hand rapidly grew as the brush tip stabbed at the black-white light with formidable sharpness.Clang!The collision shook Zhou Yuan's hand and the black-white light was catapulted away. However, it suddenly turned, trembling faintly as it shot towards Su Youwei instead.Zhou Yuan was greatly alarmed and hurriedly shouted, \"Careful Youwei!\"Unfortunately, the black-white light's speed was too quick. Su Youwei was barely able to respond when the black-white light arrived and flew into the spot between her brows.The sight of this caused Zhou Yuan's eyes to almost burst open in rage, turning entirely red as he rushed towards Su Youwei.Meanwhile, Su Youwei's body trembled a little as she felt the area between her brows with her hand and hurriedly said, \"I'm fine your highness!\"Zhou Yuan quickly arrived at her side and looked at the spot between her brows, \"What was that thing earlier? Are you sure you are alright?\"\"I don't know what happened either.\" Su Youwei's eyebrows knitted together.Yaoyao also walked over at this moment and observed Su Youwei for a while, before she spoke, \"Check your Qi Dwelling.\"Su Youwei nodded. She closed her eyes as her mind sunk into her Qi Dwelling. After a while, she finally sensed something different.A black-white glimmer floated within her Qi Dwelling. At closer inspection, one would discover a silhouette of a sword within the black-white light. On the sword were two barely discernible ancient words.\"Yangming Sword.\"The sword silhouette vibrated as an astonis.h.i.+ng aura pulsed from it. However, the entire sword was dim as if its energy had been completely depleted.Su Youwei opened her eyes and said in an amazed voice, \"A sword has appeared in my Qi Dwelling.\"Zhou Yuan was stunned.Yaoyao thought for a bit and said, \"An object capable of being kept into the Qi Dwelling is likely a Heaven tier Genesis Weapon.\"\"Heaven tier Genesis Weapon?\" Su Youwei's little mouth hung slightly open. One would not be able to find a single Genesis Weapon of this tier even in the entire Great Zhou Empire. Yet, such an object had somehow burrowed into her Qi Dwelling?After being shocked for a while, Su Youwei nervously looked towards Zhou Yuan and said, \"Your highness, maybe I should try to expel it?\"Such a precious treasure would likely be a huge help to Zhou Yuan.Yaoyao let out a soft chuckle. \"Genesis Weapons that have reached the Heaven level have a consciousness of their own and will chose their own masters. This Yangming Sword has likely chosen you as its host due to its Yin Yang attribute.\"\"Even if you manage to retrieve it from your Qi Dwelling, Zhou Yuan will not be able to subdue it. Forcing it to submit will do no good.\"Zhou Yuan's lips cracked open into a grin as he said, \"This is your blessing, there is no need to force it out.\"Although a Heaven Genesis Weapon was rare, there was no regret in Zhou Yuan. As the saying went, only what suited oneself was the most powerful after all. Moreover, the fact that Su Youwei had been able to chosen by a Heaven Genesis Weapon was something that made him rather happy.After all, landing in Su Youwei's hands was countless times better than landing in the hands of an enemy.\"Can you summon the Yangming Sword for us to see?\" Zhou Yuan was instead more interested in the strength of this Heaven Genesis Weapon. Although his Heavenly Yuan Brush used to be a Sacred Genesis Weapon, only its second rune had been awakened. Hence, it had only reached the low grade Black Genesis Weapon level.In comparison, if news of such a Heaven Genesis Weapon spread, let alone the Alpha-Origin experts of the Great Zhou Empire, even the experts from other empires would flood towards this place. After all, a Heaven Genesis Weapon would raise one's battle power to an astonis.h.i.+ng level.Su Youwei tried for a while, but ultimately shook her head. \"The sword seems to have fallen into dormant state and cannot be summoned for now.\"Zhou Yuan felt some regret after hearing this, but did not insist. Instead, his gaze turned towards the third jade case.\"I wonder what kind of treasure is in this last case.\"This time, Zhou Yuan was even more careful. Genesis Qi circulated within him and he prepared the best he could before very carefully lifting the lid of the third jade case.Unexpectedly, nothing happened when the jade case was opened. Only when the case was fully open did the trio finally see a silver ball lying within it.After closer inspection, the trio realised that this round silver ball was made from a silver liquid which flowed continuously as if it had a mind of its own.Zhou Yuan curiously asked, \"What is this?\"Yaoyao a.n.a.lyzed it as interest emerged in her eyes. \"What a marvelous thing. There seem to be many Genesis Runes within the liquid.\"\"Eh?\" Zhou Yuan was taken aback. Genesis Qi surged in his eyes as he too discovered the extremely tiny Genesis Runes within the silver liquid.\"Inscribe Genesis Runes on liquid?\" Su Youwei was likewise full of amazement. Just how good did one need to be to achieve such a feat?Zhou Yuan asked in bewilderment, \"Then\u2026 what's the function of this thing?\"Yaoyao was silent for a moment before she said, \"Drip a drop of blood on it and see what happens?\"Zhou Yuan hesitated a little. He then gritted his teeth and bit open a tiny hole at the tip of his finger. A drop of fresh blood fell and landed on the ball made from silver liquid.The trio's eyes were tightly fixed onto the ball as the drop of blood swiftly fused into the silver liquid.Buzz!Light suddenly surged within the silver liquid as it slowly rose into the air. Silver water flowed downwards and gradually transformed into a set of silver battle armor that covered every part of the body.Genesis Runes flickered on the battle armor, making it appear rather mysterious.A flabbergasted Zhou Yuan stared at the silver battle armor. It gave off a formidable and cold aura, every part seemingly filled with killing intent, while a faint pressure spread, causing one's heart to beat a little faster.\"What the h.e.l.l is this thing?\"\"A transforming battle armor?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93 Silver ShadowPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShock was present on Zhou Yuan's and Su Youwei's faces as they stared at the silver battle armor before them. There was also some amazement in Yaoyao's pretty eyes as she observed the armor for a while before she said, \"This is not a battle armor, but a battle puppet.\"\"Battle puppet?\" Zhou Yuan was taken aback.\"The Battle Puppet Sect does have some ability. To think that they managed to create a battle puppet of this level.\" There was some admiration in Yaoyao's voice.\"If I am not wrong, this battle puppet does not function independently, but fuses with a person and operates as a support of sorts, giving the wielder astonis.h.i.+ng power.\"\"To fuse human and battle puppet, tch tch, this Battle Puppet Sect really dares to innovate.\"\"Fusion with a human?\" Zhou Yuan frowned, evidently unable to comprehend.Yaoyao instructed, \"Touch it with your hand.\"Zhou Yuan hesitated a little before reaching out, his finger very cautiously touching the silver battle armor in front him.Rumble!The moment Zhou Yuan's finger came into contact with the battle armor, the latter swiftly began to dissolve, transforming into silver liquid that began to flow along Zhou Yuan's finger towards his arm.In a short span of a few breaths, the silver liquid had completely covered Zhou Yuan's entire body.After covering his body, the silver liquid began to solidify and the silver armor from before swiftly emerged on his body.The tightly shut eyes of the silver battle armor suddenly opened. Silver light seemed to flow within them as a cry of surprise emerged from its mouth, \"What a magical battle puppet!\"Although the voice was a little different, it had clearly originated from Zhou Yuan.\"I feel that I've become terrifying powerful.\" Zhou Yuan was very surprised. The silver battle armor was tightly wrapped around his body, and he could control this battle puppet as if it were his own body.The two had truly fused together and were in perfect harmony.The most shocking thing for Zhou Yuan however, was that he now seemed to have become overwhelmingly powerful.The silver battle armor had bestowed an astonis.h.i.+ng amount of power unto him.As he felt the violently surging power, Zhou Yuan could not help but want to give it a try. Hence, he suddenly clenched his hand and the silver battle armor's sharp hand also closed immediately.Zhou Yuan went down on one knee and sent a fierce punch at the ground below.Boom!This punch caused the entire underground palace to shake violently. Next, Zhou Yuan watched in shock as a giant crack grew on the ground in front of him, extending to multiple cracks akin to the sh.e.l.l of a tortoise.Zhou Yuan joyfully cried out, \"Such power. This punch is comparable to the attack of an Alpha-Origin expert!\"However, the moment his voice faded, an intense pain suddenly emerged between his brows as the scene before his eyes rapidly darkened.The silver battle armor abruptly retracted, returning to the form of a silver ball as it hovered in front of him. Zhou Yuan tumbled out from the armor, falling head first to the ground. His eyes closed in grimace while his face had become rather pale.\"Your highness?!\" Su Youwei's expression immediately changed when she saw this and hastily rushed forward to support him.Su Youwei worriedly asked, \"Big sis Yaoyao, what happened to him?\"Yaoyao also walked forward and took a look. \"He's fine, it's just that he exhausted his spirit. He'll slowly recover after some rest.\"Su Youwei breathed a sigh of relief. Her fair and slender fingers reached out and gently ma.s.saged Zhou Yuan's temples.Zhou Yuan's coma lasted for almost an hour before he groggily came back to his senses. The first thing he did was grab his head with both hands, a head that felt as if it was about to explode.Quite some time later, the pain finally subsided somewhat, but his face was still deathly pale. He looked towards Yaoyao, heart thudding loudly as he inquired, \"What happened to me?\"Yaoyao irritably rolled her eyes at him and said in a displeased voice, \"Who asked you to use such power so carelessly.\"\"This battle puppet will link to your Spirit after fusion and is powered by your Spirit. Have a good look at what level your Spirit is currently at, do you really believe that you can easily utilise a battle puppet that possesses power akin to the Alpha-Origin stage?\"\"The consequence of forcibly using such power will be the exhaustion of your Spirit. Fortunately, you were pretty lucky this time and did not use too much power, or your Spirit would have been sucked dry.\"Horror surfaced on Zhou Yuan's face.It was clear that he had never expected such dangers when using the battle puppet.\"Why didn't you tell me earlier!\" Lamented Zhou Yuan. How could he possibly have known?There was some lingering fear together with feelings of regret in his heart as he looked at the floating silver ball again. He had previously believed that he would be able to match Alpha-Origin experts with the battle puppet, but he now realised that he had been far too naive. There was indeed no such thing as power that came without any price in this world.Zhou Yuan ma.s.saged the spot between his brows as he said, \"Big sis Yaoyao, you should take this puppet, it suits you.\"\"So self-aware?\" Yaoyao playfully smiled, but shook her head soon after.\"Your blood has already fused with it earlier and I do not know the reversal procedure. I'm afraid that no one else besides yourself will be able to use this silver battle puppet.\"\"Uh\u2026\"Zhou Yuan awkwardly scratched his head, he had evidently not expected that the drop of blood from before had already caused the battle puppet to acknowledge him as its master.Yaoyao said with some interest, \"However, you can pa.s.s it to me to study for the time being. If I manage to gather enough material in future, I may try to create one.\"Zhou Yuan naturally nodded.\"Looks like I have to at least raise the level of my Spirit to the Corporeal realm to properly bring out the power of this battle puppet.\" Zhou Yuan felt that it was such a pity. He was currently at the mid Illusory stage and G.o.d knows just how long it would take to reach the Corporeal stage.\"Keep dreaming, this battle puppet is likely the best masterpiece of the Battle Puppet Sect. Think about it, fusion of human and battle puppet such that even one's Genesis skills and techniques can be used through borrowing the power of the battle puppet. It's hard to imagine how they managed to implement such a bold idea.\"\"Moreover, if you become more proficient in Genesis Runes in future, you may even make it even stronger.\"Yaoyao stared at the silver ball as she sighed in admiration, \"It possess the ability to grow, a trait that other battle puppets are unable to match. This is why I said that the Battle Puppet Sect does have some ability.\"After hearing Yaoyao's evaluation, Zhou Yuan was at last able to comprehend just how awesome the silver battle armor was, causing him to grin involuntarily. This battle puppet was indeed a real treasure. Even if he was unable to utilise it for the time being, it may become a huge aid to him in future.\"I'll call you Silver Shadow.\" Zhou Yuan smiled at the silver ball. A unique existence such as itself deserved a proper name.As if hearing Zhou Yuan's words, a silver glow emerged from the silver ball.Zhou Yuan returned the silver ball back into the jade case, before very carefully keeping it in his Universe bag.Subsequently, they searched the underground palace again, but did not find anything else. Though this was the case, Zhou Yuan and Su Youwei were already very satisfied with their haul, while Yaoyao did not really care at all.Since they had already obtained the treasures of the underground palace, Zhou Yuan smiled and said, \"Let's go.\"The trio left the underground palace, the bronze doors closing behind them as the Genesis Rune boundary was gradually restored. Zhou Yuan gazed at the boundary that had closed itself once again as worry faded from his heart. When they returned to Great Zhou City, he would tell Zhou Qing to send men to manage this place. Once they were able to take control of these battle puppets, the power of the Great Zhou royal clan would definitely soar.This underground palace was the beginning of hope for the Great Zhou Empire....Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 Qi Manor\u2019s RebellionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Zhou Yuan trio exited the underground palace and met up with Wei Canglan and the rest outside the ruins.Upon seeing that the trio were safe and sound, Wei Canglan, Lu Tieshan and the rest breathed a sigh of relief. Only the Black Venom King felt that it was rather unfortunate, but did not dare to show his true feelings.\"Black Venom King, you should have some influence in Blackwater, right?\" Zhou Yuan was all smiles as he stared at the respectful face of the Black Venom King. Zhou Yuan was aware that the latter was a ruthless character and would not be submit to him willingly, but he did not mind. As long as the Spirit Locking Rune jade was in his hands, there was nothing that the Black Venom King could do.The Black Venom King hastily responded, \"Is there anything your highness needs me to do? There are few who dare to challenge my authority in Black Venom City.\"Zhou Yuan chuckled. \"Since that is so, send some men to the valley from earlier and make sure no one enters.\"There were an enormous number of battle puppets in the underground palace. This was an extremely formidable force. Although the Genesis Rune boundary could stop intruders, Zhou Yuan still wanted to have some people around as insurance.Moreover, in the chaotic Blackwater, the influence of Black Venom City was obviously greater than the Great Zhou Empire.Zhou Yuan then looked towards Wei Canglan and said, \"Great general, now that the Fire Spirit Grain has landed in the hands of the royal clan, Qi Manor will definitely not let this matter rest. I'm afraid that Qi Manor will begin their rebellion soon.\"Wei Canglan's heart s.h.i.+vered when he heard these words. If Qi Manor were to rebel, the Great Zhou Empire would definitely descend into chaos.However, he knew the situation Zhou Yuan spoke of would likely occur. After all, the Fire Spirit Grain was far too important, and the royal clan's power would only grow stronger and stronger once they began to cultivate it until the day came where they would easily suppress Qi Manor.Therefore, there was no way that Qi Yuan would just sit and wait for death.Zhou Yuan stared at Wei Canglan and slowly said, \"I hope that great general will be able to help us eliminate Qi Manor.\"Not only was Wei Canglan an Alpha-Origin expert, he also controlled the Canglan Army, a powerful and influential force in the Great Zhou Empire. His aid would make a great difference against Qi Manor.Wei Canglan was silent for a while. Just some time back, he would have chosen to watch from the sidelines if the royal clan and Qi Manor were to go to war. However, the current situation was different from before.The originally waning royal clan seemed to have suddenly become rather powerful.For example, the girl in green and the seemingly cute little creature in her arms were equal to two Alpha-Origin experts.What's more, Zhou Yuan had forced the Black Venom King into submission.As such, the royal clan now possessed the power of four Alpha-Origin stage experts.Such power far surpa.s.sed Qi Manor and his own faction.At this point, Wei Canglan suddenly felt a little frightened. The eyes that now looked towards the faintly smiling young man before him had now become somewhat different. It seemed that all of the odds had begun to fall in the royal clan's favor ever since this youngster had arrived at Canglan County.The current royal clan was nothing compared to before. The seemingly ever waning existence in everyone's eyes had started to change after the appearance of this young prince\u2026Respect emerged on Wei Canglan's solemn face as he looked at Zhou Yuan and declared in a solemn voice, \"Don't worry your highness, as the great general of the Great Zhou Empire, it is my duty to put down all rebels!\"Lu Tieshan and the rest were overjoyed when they heard Wei Canglan state his position. When they looked towards Zhou Yuan again, their eyes were filled with both admiration and reverence. His majesty had been unable to solve the Wei Canglan issue even after so many years, but who could have imagined that Zhou Yuan would earn the full support of the great general mere months after arriving at Canglan County.Zhou Yuan cupped his fists together and smiled, \"Then I'll have to thank great general.\"Zhou Yuan was not surprised by Wei Canglan's decision. The past royal clan had been in the decline and relied solely on Zhou Qing to uphold the situation. Unfortunately, he was kept in check by Qi Yuan at all times, allowing Wei Canglan to reign freely over Canglan County. Things however had now begun to change and Zhou Yuan clearly understood the power he currently possessed at his side, power that Wei Canglan also knew very well now.Such power was enough to threaten the great general's faction.Dignity originated from power. Since the royal clan possessed power again, dignity would naturally follow suit. As long as Wei Canglan was not a fool, he should understand his status and what he should do.The future Great Zhou Empire would likely no longer permit the great general to ignore royal decrees.Wei Canglan said, \"Your highness, I will follow you back to Great Zhou City and have an audience with his majesty, while Qingqing will reorganize the Canglan Army. If Qi Manor tries anything funny, the Canglan Army will move out immediately.\"\"Nothing will be better.\" Zhou Yuan smiled and nodded. The act of following him to Great Zhou City alone was in itself a display of Wei Canglan's current stance.\"Then I will stay behind in Blackwater to help your highness keep an eye on the other factions here, so as to prevent them from causing additional trouble if the Great Zhou Empire falls into chaos.\"Zhou Yuan smiled thinly as he looked towards the Black Venom King. \"Given your strength, it would be a waste of talent for you to stay behind in Blackwater. So you will also follow me to Great Zhou City.\"If Qi Manor started a rebellion, it would definitely be a world-shaking affair. Hence, Zhou Yuan would never allow an Alpha-Origin expert such as the Black Venom King to hide in Blackwater.The Black Venom King had a pained look on his face. How could he not know that following Zhou Yuan to Great Zhou City most likely meant that he would surely be dispatched to the risky vanguard once the fighting started.However, Zhou Yuan possessed the Spirit Locking jade, thus the Black Venom King could not object.\"Let's go, there is no time to lose. Quickly return to Great Zhou City!\"Zhou Yuan raised his head and looked towards the direction of Great Zhou City as iciness surged in his eyes.Qi Manor, you've acted so arrogantly for so many years. Now, it is time for me to properly punish you lot!...Several days later.Great Zhou City, Qi Manor.Cras.h.!.+A teacup smashed into the ground and shattered to pieces as Qi Yuan abruptly stood up. His expression was twisted in rage as he stared at the kneeling Qi Ling before him and howled in disbelief, \"What did you say?! Qi Hao was killed by Zhou Yuan?! And the Fire Spirit Grain was taken by them?!\"By the side stood an one-arm Qi Yue who mumbled to himself, \"How can this be possible?! Elder brother's strength is at the advance Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage. Won't killing Zhou Yuan be as easy as a flip of his palm?!\"An ashen face Qi Ling trembled as he spoke, \"Your servant does not know how Zhou Yuan did it, but first young master has indeed died at his hands.\"\"Although we managed to get the Black Venom King on our side, Zhou Yuan managed to obtain Wei Canglan's support.\"Qi Yuan's face was twisted, no longer having any sign of the calmness he usually had as he roared, \"Didn't you have the spirit controlling flute? Wasn't it able to control the giant python-type battle puppet?\"Qi Ling was almost crying as he responded, \"But Zhou Yuan had a little beast at his side that had the strength of the Alpha-Origin stage, and even the giant battle puppet python was destroyed by it.\"\"What?!\" Qi Yuan's pupils shrank. He had not heard this information before.\"Moreover, the girl in green at Zhou Yuan's side is extremely proficient in the art of Genesis Runes and can draw grade 4 Genesis Runes!\"Qi Yuan's five fingers tightly clenched into a fist as his complexion turned ashen. \"Impossible! If the royal clan possessed such power, they would have taken action against Qi Manor long ago!\"Qi Ling hastily said, \"Everything your servant has said is true!\"Qi Yuan's expression fluctuated indeterminately. He knew that there was no need for Qi Ling to lie about such things, as such, they were likely true.But this only confused Qi Yuan even more. After all, he had been closely monitoring the royal clan all this time, and clearly understood just how much power they had. How did an Alpha-Origin Genesis Beast and a master proficient in grade 4 Genesis Runes suddenly appear?Qi Ling urgently said, \"My lord, the royal clan's power has risen dramatically and even Wei Canglan has sided with them. If we wait till they arrive at Great Zhou City, they will surely link up with Zhou Qing and attack you. We need to think of a countermeasure as soon as possible!\"Qi Yuan's expression turned stormy. He slowly sat down as a vicious look flashed across his face.\"It seems that I have indeed underestimated Zhou Qing. I originally believed that the only route left for the royal clan was to slowly die off. Who could have imagined that he would actually be able to create such a reversal!\"Qi Yuan's voice was chillingly cold. \"However, such power might have been able to threaten me a year ago. But now, it won't be so easy for them.\"\"Fortunately for us, thanks to that little b.a.s.t.a.r.ds deeds, his reputation has already spread to the ears of the Great Wu Empire's crown prince. The n.o.ble prince dislikes such news to sully his ears and has increased the support given to us, clearly intending on using us to eliminate that little b.a.s.t.a.r.d.\"Cold light flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes, his hand slamming onto the table as he decisively said, \"We'll leave Great Zhou City and head back to Qi County. I originally planned on allowing Zhou Qing to enjoy some peace for a few years, but since they are so intent on courting death, I will grant them their wis.h.!.+\"He stood up, his eyes dripping with venom, his expression turning sinister as a demon as he turned towards the direction of the royal palace.\"Little brat Zhou Yuan, since you dare to kill my son, I will make sure your entire family is buried together with you!\"As his words faded, he had already walked out of the room, Qi Yue and Qi Ling following behind....The next day. Zhou Yuan and his group finally arrived at Great Zhou City after travelling at full speed.However, the moment they entered the city, a short message spread from Qi Manor.\"Qi Manor seeks independence to establish the Great Qi Empire. Hence, we announce our withdrawal from the Great Zhou Empire.\"\"King Zhou's mediocrity has caused the Great Zhou Empire to become fractured and broken, its citizens forced into suffering. The Great Qi Empire seeks to follow the will of heaven and replace the Great Zhou Empire.\"Thus, the entire Great Zhou Empire was shocked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95 DisputePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Rebellion!\"In the royal palace. Zhou Qing's face was white with rage, his fists hammering the table thunderously, while his eyes overflowed with chilling murder. It was obvious that the message from Qi Manor had already spread to his ears.There were also numerous military leaders and ministers in the large hall whose expressions were currently fluctuating indeterminately. Practically everyone knew that king Qi had harboured thoughts of rebelling for the past few years, but no one had expected him to go all the way today.\"King Qi has already revolted, what do all of you think we should do?\" Zhou Qing's gaze swept downwards, his penetrating eyes locking onto the group of ministers below.He knew that due to the decline of the royal clan over the years, it was inevitable that some of these ministers and military leaders would be swayed by Qi Manor, their stances shaken. After all, everyone knew that the Great Wu Empire was backing Qi Manor.Qi Manor's decision to become independent may even have happened due to the support from the Great Wu Empire. If the royal clan was overthrown by Qi Manor, the fates of those who went against Qi Manor now would not be pleasant.Thus, the great hall became somewhat silent for a time.A voice suddenly rang out at this moment, \"Your majesty, Qi Manor has already grown too powerful and is a difficult force to match. I suggest we allow Qi County to separate themselves from the empire and try our best to negotiate peace with them such as to prevent any conflicts.\"Everyone looked over, only to find that the one who had spoken was Liu Hou.Liu Hou was Liu Xi's father, and had grown very close to Qi Manor over the past few years.Zhou Qing's expression turned extremely dark when he heard this. The corners of his mouth raised to form a mocking smile as he stared at Liu Hou and said, \"So Liu Hou means that not only should I restrain from sending any military force to curb this rebellion, but also give them control of their land and beg for peace?\"Liu Hou had a fair complexion and no beard. He expression remained unchanged as he faced Zhou Qing's man-eating gaze and said, \"Then may I ask if his majesty has any confidence in eliminating king Qi?\"Zhou Qing's five fingers clenched tightly as cracking noises were emitted. Qi Manor had already grown strong, and had the support of the Great Wu Empire. Hence, this rebellion was definitely not on a whim. Even Zhou Qing himself did not dare to affirm that he would be able to suppress king Qi.Zhou Qing's shut his eyes and took in several deep breaths, controlling the emotions in his heart. When he gradually opened his eyes again, they were filled a chilling coldness. \"I will no longer compromise even if it means battling to the death.\"The hearts of everyone present s.h.i.+vered when they heard the icy killing intent in Zhou Qing's voice. It seemed that a life and death battle between the royal clan and Qi Manor was unavoidable.Liu Hou indifferently said, \"Your majesty's decision will put the Great Zhou Empire in huge danger.\"\"Does your majesty still not understand how much power the current Great Zhou Empire has? The empire's strength is at most only equal to Qi Manor's. In addition, the great general, Wei Canglan, does not follow any of the royal commands and instead holes himself up in Canglan County, refusing to leave. It is likely that he will ignore Qi Manor's rebellion.\"\"Therefore, a forceful approach will instead cause the Great Zhou Empire to fall into a state of near destruction.\"Liu Hou's words resounded in the hall, causing the faces of the many ministers and military leaders to turn gloomy. Some of the originally somewhat spirited military officers had lost their morale due to having truly understood the crisis they potentially faced.Zhou Qing's complexion turned ashen when he saw the fallen morale in the hall.\"Liu Hou's words are laughable. If we give in and seek peace, Qi Yuan will definitely press us harder and harder until the day our Great Zhou Empire ends up fully devoured. From what I can see, Liu Hou's advise will only lead to death!\"While the hall was silent, an icy laugh suddenly rang out.The sudden voice caused the numerous ministers and military leaders in the hall to be taken aback. They quickly turn their heads and found a slim youth walking in from the entrance.\"Prince Zhou Yuan?\"Upon seeing who it was, everyone was stunned.Liu Hou merely glanced at Zhou Yuan and sneered, \"Your highness is still too young and naturally will not consider the consequences. Given the Great Zhou Empire's current strength, what confidence do we have in a direct clash against Qi Manor?\"\"I feel that your highness should go wait in the rear hall. This is a place to discuss official matters, not a place for you to say whatever you want.\"Zhou Yuan's expression was indifferent as he replied, \"Liu Hou, looks like Qi Yuan did not tell you everything.\"Liu Hou's eyes narrowed. \"What are you trying to say?!\"Zhou Yuan's frosty gaze locked onto the former as a mocking smile rose on his lips, \"Aren't you interested to know why Qi Yuan was in such a rush to escape from Great Zhou City, not daring to stay even a moment longer in is his own Qi manor?\"Liu Hou sneered. \"Oh? Might it have something to do with your highness?\"His tone was filled with mockery but who could have expected that Zhou Yuan would actually nod in response. \"Looks like your brain is still functional. Qi Yuan was indeed afraid that I would come back ahead of time, giving him no chance to even escape from Great Zhou City.\"The moment these words were said, the numerous ministers and military officers in the great hall looked to each other in disbelief, evidently unable to take his highness words seriously. How could a mere Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage kid like you possibly scare Qi Yuan so much that he did not even dare to stay a moment longer in Great Zhou City? This was practically the biggest joke of the century.\"Nonsense.\" Liu Hou sneered.Zhou Qing frowned. Zhou Yuan's words were indeed rather arrogant, but they did confuse the former. After all, given Zhou Yuan's character, it was very unlikely that he would brag in such a senseless manner.If so, why had Zhou Yuan said such things?Zhou Yuan ignored everyone's gazes and merely turned his body to the side as his gaze looked outside of the hall.Upon seeing his actions, everyone in the hall, including Zhou Qing, also cast their puzzled gazes at the entrance.As everyone watched with rapt attention, the sound of heavy armor clinking was suddenly heard, and everyone soon saw a well-built figure wearing heavy armor walk into hall. The figure came to a stop at the center of the hall and knelt on one knee.He slowly removed his helmet as a low voice resounded across the hall.\"General Wei Canglan greets his majesty!\"*Uproar!*Every person in the hall stared at the figure in shock, and even Zhou Qing abruptly stood up as he gazed at Wei Canglan's figure in disbelief.Ever since the Black Venom King attacked Canglan County many years ago, great general Wei Canglan had never taken a single step into Great Zhou City and not responded to a single one of the imperial edicts.Hence, everyone believed that he would continue to be independent. No one would have even dreamt that on the same day Qi Manor announced its rebellion, he would once again come to Great Zhou City and display a posture of servitude.Liu Hou's expression changed. Wei Canglan would undoubtedly be a huge aid if he chose to side with the Great Zhou royal clan.However, he could not fathom why Wei Canglan would make such a decision after ignoring the royal command for so many years.Wei Canglan said in a low voice, \"I've stubbornly persisted in my wrong doings for far too long, and it was only thanks to his highness that I was recently enlightened. I am deeply ashamed of my past actions and hope that your majesty can send me to deal with the rebels!\"Everyone had a strange look in their eyes as they turned towards Zhou Yuan, even Zhou Qing was rather bewildered. They did not understand what Zhou Yuan had done to bring about such a change in Wei Canglan's att.i.tude.Zhou Yuan merely smiled in response to the puzzled gazes before he looked towards Zhou Qing and said, \"Father need not worry about those Qi Manor rebels.\"Next, he extended both hands and clapped softly.Under everyone's watching eyes, a black robed figure walked in from outside the hall. The figure also stopped at the center of the hall and knelt on one knee as his raspy voice sounded out, \"I am the lord of Black Venom City and have long heard of the mighty Great Zhou Empire. I have specially made a visit today to submit to the empire and am willing to do all I can for the empire!\"The lord of Black Venom City? The Black Venom King?!The moment these words were said, an uproar arose in the hall as a portion of the crowd pulled back in fear. Everyone was dumbstruck as they stared at the Black Venom King, evidently no stranger to his name.However, after fright came utter confusion. The situation was now a little beyond their comprehension.The Black Venom King was a tyrant in Blackwater and had the strength of the Alpha-Origin stage. No one would believe that such a ferocious individual would submit to the empire after hearing of its might.Thus, the corners of Zhou Qing's lips twitched slightly. Who better knew the Great Zhou Empire's might than himself? Wanting an Alpha-Origin experts to join them after hearing of their might was practically a pipe dream.Hence, after a long silence, everyone in the hall turned towards Zhou Yuan.He was clearly the one behind this.However, Zhou Yuan ignored these gazes and looked towards the now pale faced Liu Hou as an indifferent voice echoed in the hall.This time however, no one dared to look down on the young man's words.\"Does Liu Hou still feel that the Great Zhou Empire needs to give in and beg for peace?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 FivePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs Zhou Yuan's voice resounded within the great hall, Liu Hou became ashen faced and unable to speak for some time. After all, no one would have imagined that Zhou Yuan would actually obtain the support of Wei Canglan and the Black Venom King.A flash of understanding struck everyone as they recalled Zhou Yuan's earlier words. No wonder Qi Yuan did not dare to linger in Great Zhou City, he had already known all of this information regarding Zhou Yuan.It was indeed true that Wei Canglan and the Black Venom King working together was enough to ensure Qi Yuan was unable to leave the city.Zhou Yuan calmly said, \"In Blackwater, Qi Yuan sent Qi Hao to vie with me for the Fire Spirit Grain. They ultimately failed, Qi Hao lost his life at my hands, and I obtained the support of general Wei and the Black Venom King. Qi Yuan was forced to rebel because he knew this.\"Everyone was dumbstruck. After all that had happened, it turned out that king Qi had been forced into rebelling by Zhou Yuan.But this made sense once one started to think about it. With the aid of Wei Canglan and the Black Venom King, the royal clan's power had practically multiplied and there was no way that they would continue to tolerate Qi Manor's existence. If king Qi did not want to sit and wait for death, the only option he had was rebellion.\"But\u2026 just how did he do it?\"The hearts of the many ministers and military leaders shook as they looked towards Zhou Yuan's rather young face. To think that the Wei Canglan issue that had troubled Zhou Qing for numerous years had been so easily resolved by Zhou Yuan.It was really inconceivable.Liu Hou's heart was akin to a churning sea as he gazed at the calm face of the young man. A sliver of regret suddenly arose within him, regret due to the marriage Zhou Qing had proposed between Zhou Yuan and his daughter Liu Xi.Though nothing had come out of it due to Liu Xi's vehement disagreement, it must be said that at that point in time, Liu Hou himself was not optimistic about the future of the royal clan and Zhou Yuan.Thus, he ultimately allowed and made use of Liu Xi's objection to refuse the marriage.Yet, the one whom they had not been optimistic about had undergone an almost magical transformation in less than a year. Not only had he defeated Qi Yue, taking the number one spot in the Great Zhou Inst.i.tute's cla.s.s ranking exam, he had now even managed to gain the support of Wei Canglan and the Black Venom King through some unknown method.How could an ordinary person achieve such feats?In the great hall, Zhou Qing finally returned to his senses after a period of shock. He immediately looked towards Wei Canglan and the Black Venom King and said, \"Please rise. With your help, the Great Zhou Empire will definitely eliminate the rebels!\"The originally low morale that had blanketed the hall soared at this moment as the many military officers began to volunteer themselves one after another. It seemed that their morale would be rather high for some time.With the support of great general Wei Canglan and the Black Venom King, the Great Zhou Empire's power now surpa.s.sed Qi Manor.Upon seeing that the morale had recovered, Zhou Qing's face looked much better. His gaze swept across the great hall as a strong voice rang out, \"From today onwards, the Great Zhou Empire begin to prepare for war. The imperial guard will take charge of Great Zhou City and send out scouts to observe every movement of those rebels Qi Manor!\"His eyes fell upon Liu Hou before he continued in an icy voice, \"As for Liu Hou, you will not be allowed to leave your residence over this period of time.\"It was obvious that he intended to confine Liu Hou. Moreover, it was easy to imagine how Zhou Qing would begin to purge the Great Zhou Empire of Qi Manor's spies, some of whom were currently present and would likely not be able to escape.Liu Hou's face was deathly pale. He knew that it was all over for the Liu family.Zhou Qing's decisiveness and ruthlessness caused the atmosphere in the great hall to become somewhat heavy.\"All other military officers will guard their current allocated areas. We will not allow the Great Zhou Empire's land to be taken!\" Zhou Qing's solemn voice boomed in the hall.\"Understood!\"A series of respectful responses emerged within the hall.After he had given his instructions, Zhou Qing allowed everyone to leave while making sure to send someone to prepare accomodations for Wei Canglan and the Black Venom King.The hall suddenly became rather empty. Zhou Qing and Zhou Yuan were the only ones who remained.Zhou Qing looked at the slender youth in the hall, happiness overflowing in his eyes. He walked towards Zhou Yuan and gently patted the latter's shoulders. \"Yuan'er, I really have to thank you this time.\"If Zhou Yuan had not gained the support of Wei Canglan and the Black Venom King, the only option left would be a battle to the death with king Qi.Zhou Yuan grinned. \"Father has shouldered such a huge burden for so many years, it is only right for me to help ease it a little.\"How could he not know Zhou Qing's pains. The Great Wu Empire's rebellion from many years ago had shattered the dignity of the royal clan. Even though they had managed to painstakingly preserve the Great Zhou Empire, it was not so easy to recover the lost dignity.In such a situation, the royal clan would naturally fall into a decline. If it was not for Zhou Qing's bitter persistence, their clan would have disappeared long ago.For the sake of the Great Zhou Empire's safety, he had given in time and time again to the unreasonable Qi Manor, swallowing all the terrible resultant feelings into the pits of his stomach without even the slightest grumble.As he gazed at Zhou Yuan, even the eyes of someone like Zhou Qing could not help but turn a little red as he mumbled. \"Yuan'er has finally grown up.\"\"Father, since Qi Yuan still dares to rebel even after finding out that I have gained the support of Wei Canglan and the Black Venom King, it is likely that he has something to fall back on. We must take precautions against this.\" Zhou Yuan expression turned a little grave as he cautioned.Zhou Qing nodded. \"If I am not wrong, I'm afraid that the Great Wu Empire has given him a tremendous amount of support.\"Zhou Yuan's eyes seemed to turn as deep as the night. \"I've heard that news of my performance during the cla.s.s ranking exam has reached the ears of the Great Wu Empire's crown prince. It is because he cannot be bothered to personally deal with this that he seeks to borrow king Qi's hand to eliminate me.\"Zhou Qing gnashed his teeth as murder flashed in his eyes. \"Don't worry Yuan'er. With Wei Canglan and the Black Venom King on our side, the royal clan now possess three Alpha-Origin experts, a force powerful enough to control the situation.\"Zhou Yuan chuckled upon hearing this. \"It is more accurate to say five.\"Zhou Qing was taken aback.Thus, Zhou Yuan told Zhou Qing about Yaoyao and Tuntun.\"If not for Yaoyao and Tuntun, I'm afraid that we will not have been able to subdue the Black Venom King and even Wei Canglan might not have bothered with this rebellion.\"Truthfully speaking, subjugating Wei Canglan and the Black Venom King had been done through force. The only difference was that Wei Canglan's situation had been gentler, while the Black Venom King's direct and rough.Zhou Qing sighed. \"Yaoyao is truly the benefactor of our Zhou clan. I really do not know how we will be able to repay her.\"Zhou Yuan smiled. \"If father wishes to thank big sis Yaoyao, give her all of the good alcohol you have been saving. I'm sure that she will be very happy.\"A small smile emerged on Zhou Qing's lips. \"Okay, they will be given to her.\"Father and son exchanged a look and burst out into laughter.After laughing for a while, Zhou Yuan raised his head and looked outside the hall into the distance, where black clouds seemed to be gathering as he slowly said, \"Don't worry father, the Great Zhou Empire will be fine.\"\"I was too young back then, and could only allow both of you to protect me without being able to do anything myself. But it's different now\u2026\"\"Now, if they still dare to do anything, they will have to first ask if I agree.\"The smile on Zhou Yuan's face seemed to contain an endless frostiness.\"All that they've taken away will sooner or later be taken back by us\u2026\"\"And now, we will begin with Qi Manor\u2026\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Everyone feared that the events from many years ago would replay once again. For a time, everyone's hearts were shrouded in trepidation.Qi Manor's rebellion together with their declaration to establish the Great Qi Empire undoubtedly set off towering waves that swept across the entire Great Zhou Empire. Everyone feared that the events from many years ago would replay once again. For a time, everyone's hearts were shrouded in trepidation.It was at this time however that Wei Canglan appeared in Great Zhou City and announced with his status as the great general of the Great Zhou Empire that Qi Manor were rebels and will be dealt with using force.Wei Canglan was a well known and respected figure in the Great Zhou Empire. It was only because he had not left Canglan County for the past few years that rumours that he and the royal clan were at odds had spread. His appearance immediately dispelled these rumours, while also slightly easing the troubled hearts of the citizens.After Wei Canglan, the Black Venom King also made an appearance and proclaimed that Black Venom City had submitted to the Great Zhou Empire.News of this caused wave after wave of uproar to spread. Who did not know of the infamous Black Venom City that constantly infringed on Great Zhou borders, but who could have imagined that such a ferocious character would chose to submit to Great Zhou at this juncture.Although the news stupefied countless people, it also gave everyone a little more confidence in the Great Zhou royal clan. Hence, the people's hearts were put at ease.While the addition of Wei Canglan and the Black Venom King bolstered the Great Zhou Empire's might and reputation, there was not even the slightest hint of any response from Qi Manor. They latter merely continued to train their forces as if completely unaffected.King Qi, Qi Yuan, even sent out a declaration of war.\"Our troops will arrive at Great Zhou City after ten days.\"This declaration immediately caused countless uproars. From the looks of it, Qi Yuan intended to tackle the root of the problem. Once Great Zhou City was breached, it was easy to imagine the fate of the royal clan.Great Zhou would be overthrown.The only thing that everyone did not understand was that since there were now three Alpha-Origin experts stationed in Great Zhou City, just where did Qi Yuan find the confidence to make such a declaration of war?...\"Troops will arrive at Great Zhou City after ten days\u2026\"In a certain courtyard, Zhou Yuan gazed at the declaration of war in his hands as a look of thought flitted across his eyes. This declaration clearly represented Qi Yuan's confidence.Without this confidence, Qi Yuan the declaration would instead become a huge blow to his reputation if he ended up failing.\"Looks like he has obtained a tremendous amount of support from the Great Wu Empire.\"Zhou Yuan's eyes flashed coldly as he mumbled to himself in a hair raising voice, \"The crown prince of Great Wu that stole my blessing seems to really dislike me having peaceful days.\"Regardless of the support king Qi had obtained, the only choice they had was to respond with force and counter each move as it came.Zhou Yuan breathed in deeply, suppressing the feelings in his heart. The most important thing he had to do now was to learn the first level of the Ancestral Dragon Scripture and cultivate the Omni Python Qi.Once he cultivated this Genesis Qi, he would have truly stepped into the the realm of the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage.He did not have the time to do so previously because he had been rus.h.i.+ng back to Great Zhou City, so the current moment was the most opportune.\"Are you ready?\" A melodious voice was transmitted from the side. Yaoyao was seated to one side, carrying Tuntun as she stared at Zhou Yuan.Zhou Yuan solemnly nodded. Without further ado, he gently patted his Universe bag and several flashes of light flew out, landing on the stone table before him.Heavenly Gold Marrow.Nine Underworld Black Spring Crystal.Genesis Swallowing Rock.Grade 4 python-type beast spirit.Zhou Yuan could not help but breath a sigh of relief as he admired the four Genesis materials before him. He had finally gathered everything after investing so much effort and time.Excitement gradually gushed out in his eyes together with antic.i.p.ation.This was a day Zhou Yuan had been looking forward to ever since he obtained the Ancestral Dragon Scripture.He looked towards Yaoyao and gave her a slight nod, before his expression grew solemn. With a pat of his Universe bag, a mysterious mottled bone piece appeared in his hand.An indescribable presence spread from the bone piece.Growl!Tuntun suddenly jumped out of Yaoyao's arms and emitted a low growl. Faint scarlet light seemed to flow on its now rigidly raised fur as if it was about to transform into battle mode.Even though Tuntun had encountered the bone piece previously, it still displayed a deep wariness at the mysterious bone piece.Zhou Yuan glanced at the clearly agitated Tuntun. Even a mysterious Genesis Beast like it was so wary of the Ancestral Dragon bone piece. One could imagine just how powerful the legendary Ancestral Dragon was.\"To obtain the Ancestral Dragon Scripture within the Ancestral Dragon bone, one needs to use a dragon type blessing as the key\u2026\"Zhou Yuan was somewhat nervous as he raised the hand on which the Dragon's Resentment Poison had entrenched itself. The sacred dragon blessing that originally belonged to him had been stolen by Great Wu's python and sparrow. The current him could only try to use the Dragon's Resentment Poison as the key. If he failed, it could be said that the paths of himself and the Ancestral Dragon Scripture were not fated to meet.Upon seeing the nervousness in his eyes, Yaoyao frowned a little and said, \"Don't worry. Since I've said it will work, it will definitely work!\"Zhou Yuan let out an awkward laugh. Soon after, he began gathering his concentration. Without further ado, the hand that contained the Dragon's Resentment Poison slowly tightened around the Ancestral Dragon bone piece.The moment the Ancestral Dragon bone piece came into contact with the Dragon's Resentment Poison on his palm, Zhou Yuan immediately sensed faint runes of light emerge on the mottled bone piece.These runes seemed breathe, pulsing between strong and weak.The blood-red Dragon's Resentment Poison on Zhou Yuan's palm began to squirm as if it had been attracted by something. Strands of blood-red tunnelled out from his palm and poured into the Ancestral Dragon bone.The runes on the Ancestral Dragon bone grew even brighter as an extremely ancient dragon roar seemed to cross time and s.p.a.ce, echoing from the dragon bone.All noise began to fade from the courtyard.The Ancestral Dragon bone shook violently at this moment. A split second later, a mysterious light shot out from within, flas.h.i.+ng through the air as it shot into the spot between Zhou Yuan's brows.Boom!A deep booming sound resounded within Zhou Yuan's mind.Zhou Yuan's Spirit trembled as if it had now arrived at the formless ma.s.s that existed before creation itself, a time when the heavens and earth had yet to be born. All of a sudden, a life form was born within the primal chaos, its body tremendous beyond imagination.It was the Ancestral Dragon!The Ancestral Dragon roared, blasting apart the primal chaos, an act akin to the creation of a new world.It slowly lifted its head, t.i.tanic eyes flickering with the glow of primal chaos as it seemingly caught sight of Zhou Yuan. In the next instant, the light of primal chaos shot out from its eyes and headed straight for the latter.Boom!The light of primal chaos instantly scattered Zhou Yuan's Spirit.Zhou Yuan's tightly shut eyes abruptly opened at this moment, sweat dripping from his body. Although he did not know if what his Spirit had seen earlier was real, the pressure he had felt had almost destroyed him.If he had not constantly practiced the Primal Chaos Divine Grindstone Visualisation Method that honed his will to overcome great terror and tempered himself, it was likely that his Spirit would have dispersed the moment the Ancestral Dragon looked at him.However\u2026 he had managed to withstand its gaze.Zhou Yuan extended a faintly trembling finger and gently felt the area between his brows as a smile of uncontrollable excitement emerged from the corners of his lips.A certain Qi cultivation method was currently flowing within his mind. It was the Qi cultivation method for the Omni Python Qi.At long last, he had finally obtained the Ancestral Dragon Scripture.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, it was clear from the look in his eyes that his resolve had not been shaken. Instead, the flames of determination burned even stronger.\"There are far too many dangers in this world. Without sufficient power\u2026 I may one day come to share the fate of the Battle Puppet Sect, just a random one of the many life forms within an eighty thousand mile radius that can be easily destroyed with a flip of someone else's hand.\"\"I do not like such an outcome, nor do I want to see such a calamity strike those at my side. Thus\u2026 I need to become strong, strong enough to resist any such calamity!\"Yaoyao gazed at Zhou Yuan's eyes that flickered with unwavering determination and ultimately gave a gentle nod of approval with her pointed snow-white chin.\"Since you've made your resolve, you should begin. I will protect you during the process.\"Zhou Yuan solemnly nodded. Without anymore hesitation, his eyes closed as he meticulously savoured the Omni Python Qi cultivation method in his head. It was two hours later before he opened his eyes again.Roar!Zhou Yuan's body jerked slightly, his back arched over, while his bones vibrated as if a dragon roar was echoing within his body. It was the Dragon Breathing method.The Dragon Breathing method currently used by Zhou Yuan no longer required him to open his mouth. As he breathed, the surrounding Genesis Qi transformed into strings of white as they endlessly surged over, tunnelling into his body through his nose in sync with his breathing.This showed that he had obtained a certain level of mastery over Dragon Breathing and was capable of using Dragon Breathing while he breathed to take in the surrounding Genesis Qi.However, Zhou Yuan's mastery had yet to reach the level where he could maintain this state for a long period of time. If he were to polish it till the point of perfection in future, even his daily ordinary breathing would allow him to take in the surrounding Genesis Qi and cultivate continuously.Genesis Qi circulated within Zhou Yuan's body, flowing through his eight meridian channels before ultimately pouring into his Qi Dwelling.In his Qi Dwelling, Genesis Qi as pure as crystal floated about like the mist.With a thought, the Genesis Qi in his Qi Dwelling began to vibrate, slowly turning into a whirlpool as if being pulled towards something.Genesis Qi began to be gradually compressed in this manner.While the Genesis Qi in his Qi Dwelling began to swirl, Zhou Yuan made a grabbing motion at the Heavenly Gold Marrow, sucking it into his hand like a drop of dazzling golden liquid.The moment it landed on his palm, Genesis Qi swiftly wrapped around it and brought it into his body. It shuttled through Zhou Yuan's meridian channels and entered his Qi Dwelling.The Heavenly Gold Marrow was soon cast into the vortex formed from Genesis Qi, immediately turning into countless golden specks of light.Thus, the originally pure Genesis Qi turned dazzling gold as a faint but sharp aura gradually emerged.\"Nine Underworld Black Spring Crystal!\"Without pause, Zhou Yuan grabbed the Nine Underworld Black Spring Crystal. Genesis Qi surged as his hand closed around it, crus.h.i.+ng the crystal into tiny pieces.Wisps of black cold Qi was bundled up by Genesis Qi and brought into Zhou Yuan's body, ending up in his Qi Dwelling before being poured into the spinning golden vortex.Wisps of black light now swam within the golden vortex.\"Genesis Swallowing Rock!\"Zhou Yuan's movements were now more practiced. The Genesis Swallowing Rock was swiftly crushed into powder when it entered his hand and wisps of night-black Qi was sent into his Qi Dwelling.After sending these three Genesis materials into his Qi Dwelling, Zhou Yuan's gaze turned towards the final ingredient.The Grade 4 python type Genesis beast spirit.At this moment, Yaoyao suddenly cautioned, \"You need to be more careful when you fuse this material. A Genesis beast spirit is extremely savage in nature and the slightest mishap might result in your Spirit being devoured.\"This step was undoubtedly several times more dangerous compared to adding the previous three Genesis materials.Zhou Yuan merely smiled confidently in response. \"I might fear it if it still had its physical body, but a mere beast spirit is no threat to me.\"The moment his words faded, both his palms suddenly swung towards the crystal, shattering it as a savage hiss rang out. A flash of night-black light immediately shot towards the spot between Zhou Yuan's brows.It was the grade 4 python type Genesis beast spirit.\"Hss hss!\"The night-black light that contained the silhouette of a python zipped straight towards the cross-legged illusory figure the moment it entered Zhou Yuan's head. Its mouth opened wide with the intent of swallowing the latter.\"You don't have the qualifications to do as you please here!\"Zhou Yuan's Spirit let out an icy chuckle as it glimmered and faded away. The formless ma.s.s of creation quickly descended as an endless Primal Chaos Divine Grindstone slowly fell from the sky.The python silhouette was instantly horrified out of its soul by this scene. It could clearly feel an endless amount of fear from the seemingly infinite Primal Chaos Divine Grindstone. After a loud hiss of terror, it turned around and fled without the slightest hesitation.However, the mottled divine grindstone was capable of travelling through s.p.a.ce. Oddly enough, the python silhouette appeared in front of the grindstone as it descended, grinding the python into oblivion.Zhou Yuan's Spirit revealed itself at this moment and made a grabbing motion as countless fragments of night-black light gathered towards him, transforming into a blurry python silhouette in his palm. There was no longer any ferocity in the newly formed python silhouette, its snake eyes lifeless and dull as if its mind had been stripped away and destroyed.Zhou Yuan's Spirit swung its hand, casting the blurry python silhouette at his Qi Dwelling and into the swirling Genesis Qi vortex.All four Genesis materials were now present.Zhou Yuan concentrated and began to spin the Genesis Qi vortex according to the Omni Python Qi cultivation method, slowly fusing and tempering.In the blink of an eye, seven days pa.s.sed by.During these seven days, Zhou Yuan's body was as still as a rock and even his breathing had become much lighter. Meanwhile, a dark golden glow would flicker on the surface of his body from time to time.It seemed as if a unique aura was brewing within his body.During these seven days, Zhou Qing, Qin Yu and Su Youwei came by to see Zhou Yuan but did not dare to disturb him upon seeing that he was at a critical juncture.When the first rays of the sun sprinkled down onto Zhou Yuan's body on the eighth day, his unmoving body finally jerked.Hss!The hiss of a great python seemed to emerge from within his body, causing his Qi and blood to boil and tremble.Swis.h.!.+Zhou Yuan's tightly shut eyes opened at this moment, golden light spouting from within as wisps of dark gold Genesis Qi surged out from his body and began swirling around him.While the dark gold Genesis Qi rose, a golden python Qi body emerged from the top of Zhou Yuan's head, hissing at the heavens like a clap of thunder.On this day, the first level of the Ancestral Dragon Scripture, the Omni Python Qi had finally been cultivated by Zhou Yuan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 King Qi Besieges the CityPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRumble!The entire courtyard shuddered at this moment.Dark gold Genesis Qi curled around Zhou Yuan's body. Within the Genesis Qi, one could barely make out the figure of a giant golden python hissing at the heavens as an astonis.h.i.+ng pressure unfurled from Zhou Yuan's body.Crack!Cracks gradually grew on the stone pavilion he was in due to the pressure from the dark gold Genesis Qi.This pressure continued for quite some time before gradually receding. Zhou Yuan slowly lowered his head, blankly staring at his palms as he felt the power that was currently surging in his body.Such power was incomparable to before.With a thought, he submerged himself into his Qi Dwelling, only to see that the originally pure Genesis Qi within had now completely transformed into dark gold Genesis Qi. As the dark gold Genesis Qi flowed, one could faintly make out the silhouette of a golden python.His blood-red Qi Dwelling emitted rays of light that constantly tempered and refined the dark gold Genesis Qi.\"This is the Omni Python Qi?\"Zhou Yuan lowered his head as dark gold Genesis Qi swirled on his hand. He could feel that the power of his Genesis Qi was several times greater than before he had learnt any Qi cultivation method.Zhou Yuan was confident that if he fought Qi Hao now, he would not even need to use the Heavenly Yuan Brush to easily suppress the latter.Confidence surged in Zhou Yuan's eyes as he mumbled to himself, \"I'm practically invincible amongst the Qi Nouris.h.i.+ng stage.\"Yaoyao carried Tuntun as she walked over from the side, her clear eyes focusing on Zhou Yuan. It was a long while later before she slowly said, \"Starting now, you have truly become a pract.i.tioner of the Ancestral Dragon Scripture.\"Now that the first level of the Ancestral Dragon Scripture had been learnt, it was no longer possible to reverse the process.Zhou Yuan's expression was solemn as he nodded. \"Big sis Yaoyao, when will I be able to cultivate the second level of the Ancestral Dragon Scripture?\"The first level Omni Python Qi was a grade 5 Genesis Qi. It may be top-tier in the Great Zhou Empire, but Zhou Yuan's sights were set on a much further place, where the advantage of a grade 5 Genesis Qi would perhaps be much less apparent.If Zhou Yuan was able to cultivate the second level of the Ancestral Dragon Scripture, the grade 7 World Subduing Heavenly Serpent Qi, he would truly possess the qualifications to stand proud in this world.Even in this huge world, Grade 7 Genesis Qi could be considered the apex.Yaoyao stroked Tuntun as her red lips parted slightly. \"The Ancestral Dragon Scripture is not as easy you think. The first level is the most basic and the second will be over a dozen times more difficult.\"Zhou Yuan's heart shook slightly. He had already gone through all kinds of complications and difficulties for the first level. If the second level was even harder, who knew just when he would be able to access it.\"Since time immemorial, only one person has managed to practice the third level of the Ancestral Dragon Scripture.\"The expression in Zhou Yuan's eyes turned grave. The third level of the Ancestral Dragon Scripture was the grade 9 Galaxy Sacred Dragon Qi. Grade 9\u2026 he really wondered just what kind of amazing genius had achieved such heights.Such a person would have surely awed the entire world, right?\"Truthfully speaking, I do not know how the Ancestral Dragon Scripture will level up, but it seems to be related to one's strength.\" Yaoyao seemed to think for a while before she slowly said, \"I believe that there may also be an important juncture of sorts.\"\"What kind of important juncture?\"Yaoyao was silent for some time, before she answered, \"The day you take back the sacred dragon blessing that once belonged to you.\"She stared at Zhou Yuan as she continued, \"This may be the path that you will have to step on once again, a path that belongs to you, the path of the sacred dragon!\"Zhou Yuan's heart churned violently as his five fingers slowly closed. With a deep breath, he gave a little nod. \"I understand.\"As he suppressed the intense emotions in his heart, he said, \"I will personally take back all that I've lost!\"He then raised his head and gazed into the distance, a fire now burning within his eyes.Clap clap!Clapping suddenly sounded at this moment. Zhou Yuan lifted his head and looked over, only to see Zhou Qing and Qin Yu standing just outside the door looking at him in with joy on their faces.They had evidently rushed over after sensing the disturbance caused by Zhou Yuan's Genesis Qi earlier.\"Father, mother.\" Zhou Yuan quelled his emotions as he smiled at the two.\"Is this the grade 5 Genesis Qi you cultivated? It is indeed extraordinary.\" Zhou Qing quickly walked over as he observed the surging dark gold Genesis Qi around Zhou Yuan. The former could sense the amazing power within.It was clear that this Genesis Qi of Zhou Yuan's was even stronger than their royal clan's Flame-Thunder Qi.\"Yuan'er is amazing.\" Qin Yu stroked Zhou Yuan's hair, her expression a mixture of tenderness and pride.When Zhou Yuan returned to Great Zhou City, he had pa.s.sed a Jade Infant Fruit to Qin Yu for her to consume. Thus, her complexion was much better than before, her cheeks now a healthy rosy color. The life force she had used up previously had also gradually began to recover.\"Now that you've cultivated a Genesis Qi, you will be able to rely on your own abilities to suppress the Dragon's Resentment Poison if an outbreak occurs in future. Our hearts can finally be at ease.\" As she spoke, Qin Yu's eyes turned a little red.Zhou Yuan's Dragon's Resentment Poison had been akin to a festering wound in their hearts for a dozen years.Fortunately, the current Zhou Yuan had finally overcome the most difficult period.Zhou Yuan grasped Qin Yu's hands and consoled her with a smile.\"Father, has there been any movement from king Qi recently?\" Zhou Yuan's expression turned serious as he looked towards Zhou Qing. Although he really wanted to immediately take back the sacred dragon blessing, he understood that he had to take things one step at a time. The calamity that had befallen them so many years ago had already caused him to lag behind others. Therefore, what he needed to do now was to unrelentlessly give chase and close the gap between them.Of course, if he was unable to even resolve king Qi's rebellion, there might not even be a future for him.Zhou Qing frowned when he heard this. \"Qi Manor is still rather quiet, and the only thing king Qi has been doing is continuing to gather his troops. I'm afraid that it was be as he has declared, their army will arrive at Great Zhou City after two days.\"King Qi clearly knew that they had over three Alpha-Origin experts stationed in the city. Yet he still dared to openly make a declaration of war. Such actions made Zhou Qing feel that something was amiss.Zhou Yuan slowly said, \"It seems that Great Wu has given king Qi an insane amount of support. We have to be more cautious.\"Zhou Qing nodded as chillingly cold light surged within his eyes. \"No matter how much support king Qi has obtained, we have no other path left to take.\"Zhou Qing had already gone through the destruction of an empire once, and did not plan on repeating this experience. Thus, he would not let such events happen again regardless of the price.If all else failed, he was even willing to die together with king Qi after ensuring that Zhou Yuan had escaped.Zhou Yuan nodded as murder also rose in his eyes. This time, he would definitely eliminate the cancer-like king Qi and allow peace to return to Great Zhou. Or else, a Great Zhou plagued by inner turmoil will never be able to match the Great Wu Empire.No matter what, king Qi must die!...In the following two days, countless gazes from the entire Great Zhou Empire were concentrated on king Qi. Under their attention, king Qi finally moved on the ninth day.Just as he had said in his declaration of war, king Qi did not attack any other location. His great army swarmed straight towards Great Zhou City.On the other side, many soldiers had gathered in Great Zhou City, forming a practically impenetrable fortress in preparation for the upcoming battle.In addition, the three Alpha-Origin experts, Zhou Qing, Wei Canglan and the Black Venom King personally took to the field to calm to hearts of the people.Every pair of eyes in the entire Great Zhou had converged on Great Zhou City.Under their attention, the tenth day arrived. Everyone could feel the land tremble as a black ma.s.s of troops that extended to the end of one's sights flood towards Great Zhou City.Killing intent enveloped the entire city.King Qi's attack had finally come just as he had declared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 Seven Alpha-OriginsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDong! Dong!The sound of battle drums thundered across the land as a seemingly endless army flooded over from the ends of one's sights. They eventually came to a halt several miles from Great Zhou City. The sight of each black ma.s.s after black ma.s.s of formations made one feel an immense amount of pressure as suffocating killing intent spread.Countless people trembled in fear as they watched this scene. The more senior occupants of Great Zhou City in particular were reminded of the events from over a dozen years ago.That day had been just like this one. A huge army had surrounded the city, causing the city to fall into despair and terror due to their eminent destruction.On the city walls, Zhou Qing gazed at the black sprawling ma.s.s of soldiers. Although there was no change in his facial expression, cracks had begun to grow from the hands that had been placed on the city wall.It was clear that the view before his eyes had also made him recall the humiliation from over a dozen years ago.It was then that the once highly ambitious king of Great Zhou was thoroughly beaten by the cruelness of reality. Ever since then, he had been trapped in the current Great Zhou like a ferocious tiger in a cage.Beside Zhou Qing, Zhou Yuan also observed the suffocating black ma.s.s of troops several miles away as cold light flickered within his eyes.Zhou Qing took in a deep breath, looked towards Zhou Yuan and pointed outside the city. \"Yuan'er, it was a similar scene back then. At that time, you were born inside the city with the blessing of the sacred dragon.\"\"Outside the city, king Wu's son and daughter were born with the blessing of the python and the sparrow.\"At this point, pain flashed in Zhou Qing's eyes as he continued, \"But your father was useless and incapable of protecting you, or your current accomplishments would have been far beyond what they are now.\"\"You were originally destined to soar straight into the sky, standing tall above the rest of the world and looking down upon the geniuses of other countries. But because of me, your wings were ripped from you, causing you to flail about in the mud and even narrowly die a premature death.\"Seeing the remorse in Zhou Qing's eyes, Zhou Yuan reached out and gently patted the former's arm as he softly said, \"Father should not blame himself, experiencing hards.h.i.+p may not be a bad thing.\"\"A smooth sailing path straight into the sky may not be a good thing either.\"Zhou Yuan smiled, a smile filled with a chilling iciness that was sharp as the edge of a blade.\"Moreover\u2026 if the sacred dragon blessing truly belongs to me, I will ultimately be able to take it back.\"Zhou Qing looked at the youth before him. Though there was still some immaturity on the youth's face, there was also a resolve that those at the same age did not possess. This made him blame himself a little less. Perhaps it was truly as Zhou Yuan had said, hards.h.i.+p may be the whetstone on which one grinds one's blade.But Yuan'er, father does not plan to experience the events from back then a second time. I only tolerated the disgrace for so many years in order to give you time to grow. Now that you're all grown up, for the sake of protecting this country, I will no longer give in even if I have to give up my life.The expression in Zhou Qing's eyes gradually turned sharp as he cast his gaze towards the seemingly endless army in the distance.Dong!Another beat from the battle drum rang out as a figure on a black horse slowly trotted out from within king Qi's giant army. The figure was dressed in a full set of battle armor, and wore a cold and stern expression. It was king Qi, Qi Yuan.Countless gazes from both inside and outside the city converged onto him.Zhou Qing's chillingly icy gaze immediately locked onto Qi Yuan as he said in a frosty voice, \"Qi Yuan you rebel! You still dare to show yourself before me?!\"Qi Yuan mere laughed upon hearing this and replied, \"Useless Zhou Qing, you are the main reason why Great Zhou has fallen into such a state. I advise you to open your city gates and surrender so I may grant give the royal clan their final respect. Or else, once the city is breached, I will surely slaughter the royal clan and burn the royal tomb!\"Towards the end, Qi Yuan's voice was filled with venom, clearly displaying his intense hatred.Zhou Qing turned white with anger, his voice ice-cold as he retorted, \"After quelling this rebellion, every member of your entire Qi clan will be slaughtered!\"Qi Yuan let out a mocking laugh. \"I'm afraid that a dog like you does not have the ability!\"\"Qi Yuan you traitor, if you continue to be so pigheaded, today will be your last!\" Wei Canglan's voice thundered across the land.Zhou Yuan's gaze swept towards the Black Venom King. The latter sighed helplessly before he also stepped forward and darkly said, \"Just a single Alpha-Origin expert and you dare to attack Great Zhou City, I'm afraid that you won't even know how you will die!\"\"The troops of Black Venom City are already prepared to cut off your retreat at any time.\"Wei Canglan's and the Black Venom King's appearance undoubtedly shook those on Qi Manor's side. After all, Alpha-Origin experts were just too powerful a force and were at times enough to decide the tide of the battle.Great Zhou had three Alpha-Origin experts, while Qi Manor only had king Qi.The top-tier battle power of both camps was evidently very uneven.However, Qi Yuan's expression remained unchanged. He stared at the three Alpha-Origin experts atop the city walls as the corners of his mouth rose to form a mocking smile. \"Three Alpha-Origin experts, what a formidable line-up.\"\"Since that is so, let me show the reason behind my confidence today!\"The mockery on Qi Yuan's lips grew even greater.\"My companions, please come out and greet your old friends.\"As Qi Yuan's words faded, the army suddenly parted and six figures slowly walked out.The instant these six figures appeared, powerful Genesis Qi whizzed out from the top of their heads. The Genesis Qi filled the area, bringing along with it an astonis.h.i.+ng pressure.Every one of these six figures were Alpha-Origin experts!*Uproar*!An earth-shaking uproar immediately erupted from Great Zhou City as countless individuals watched this scene in horror.No one had expected six Alpha-Origin experts to appear on Qi Yuan's side! Zhou Yuan's pupils also shrank slightly. Was this the support the Great Wu Empire had given?Zhou Qing's gaze was glued to the six figure that had emerged. His expression became extremely twisted as his hands directly crushed a portion of the city wall.It was as if he had just seen a hated foe.\"Hehe, it's been many years since we last met your majesty, we hope that you have been well.\" In response to Zhou Qing's man-eating gaze, the six figures raised their heads and grinned at the former.\"Zhao Tianlun\u2026\"\"Lin Nian\u2026\"\"w.a.n.g Caotian\u2026\"\"......\"Each name was slowly spit out from between the gaps of Zhou Qing's teeth, his voice seething with hatred.Wei Canglan also stared at the six figures as he icily said through gnashed teeth, \"To think that it would be those six betrayers!\"He turned to look at the somewhat confused Zhou Yuan and said in a low voice, \"These six used to be ministers of the Great Zhou Empire over a dozen years ago. During king Wu's rebellion, they stabbed us in the back, launching sneak attacks on us. This resulted in the belly of our army being open to the enemy, leaving us no choice but to flee.\"\"Each of them have been conferred the t.i.tle of king by the Great Wu Empire and rule over their respective territories. I never imagined that Qi Yuan would obtain their help this time.\"At this point, Wei Canglan's expression had already become rather grim. The appearance of these six individuals had instantly blown away any advantage Great Zhou had. Adding in Qi Yuan, the number of Alpha-Origin experts on Qi Manor's side was now seven!Zhou Yuan frowned. No wonder Qi Yuan dared to declare war. It turns out that he had obtained a tremendous amount of support. Looks like a certain individual from the Great Wu Empire really intended to wipe out Great Zhou.Zhou Qing asked in a hair-raising voice, \"So Great Wu has already decided to take action?\"One of the six Alpha-Origin experts smiled faintly as he replied, \"King Wu is a man of his word. Since he made a vow that Great Wu will not step into Great Zhou for a hundred years, he will naturally abide by it.\"\"As for us six\u2026\" At this point, a toying smile emerged on his lips as he continued, \"Several days ago, we announced that we have left the Great Wu Empire and joined Great Qi. In other words\u2026 we are not members of Great Wu and king Wu has naturally not gone back on his vow.\"Crack!Zhou Qing's fists clenched tightly as cracking noises emerged. It was obvious that he was fuming inside.Qi Yuan smiled mockingly as he stared at Zhou Qing. Subsequently, the former's voice was projected to every person in Great Zhou City with the aid of powerful Genesis Qi.\"Zhou Qing, I will give you half a day to make your decision. After half a day, I will attack the city. When that time comes, any and all resistance will be slaughtered!\"His murderous voice caused countless individuals to s.h.i.+ver as fear flooded their hearts.Were the events from a dozen years ago really going to play out once again in Great Zhou City?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
