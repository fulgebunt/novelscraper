The subject lasted for two minutes and forty-five seconds after the administration of Valkyrie. Time of death: 4.22 AM.\u201dI should be the only one at home. Who\u2019s talking?Han Xiao opened his eyes, only to be blinded by light. The familiar hatch of his VR-capsule was no longer there\u2014instead, he was facing a white ceiling. The walls that surrounded him were also white and reminiscent of cold, hard metal. They felt like something straight out of science fiction. The room resembled an intensive care unit, and Han Xiao lay atop a cold metal table, bare-chested and wired to all sorts of machines. His back was freezing.Han Xiao noticed that there was a group of people in white coats surrounding him, and they were looking at him as though they had just seen a ghost.I thought I just accepted a leveling request? Where am I?Suddenly, Han Xiao felt as though a large amount of data was being transmitted into his mind, causing his head to throb painfully. The last thing he could remember was accepting a leveling a.s.signment. He was in the midst of creating a new character in \u2018Galaxy\u2019 when he seemingly started to smell burnt eggs\u2026\u201cQuickly, let Ms. Hila know! The test subject has come back to life!\u201d\u201cCall the guards!\u201dAs the researchers started a commotion, Han Xiao realized that he could understand them, even though they were speaking in a language he had never heard before. \u2018Test subject\u2019, \u2018back to life\u2019, and \u2018guards\u2019\u2014these terms unnerved him. Soon, he could hear the sound of rus.h.i.+ng footsteps coming from outside.Should I make a run for it or just lie still? Han Xiao decided on the former in a split second; he was not the kind of person to just lie around waiting. He abruptly sprang up, ripping the wires off him, and made a clumsy beeline for the door. The researchers did not attempt to stop him, instead, they backed off hastily to avoid being knocked into.Cras.h.!.+He pushed his way out into a white corridor, only to be greeted by a dozen or so guards suited in black and armed with electric batons advancing upon him from both sides.Han Xiao gasped at the sight of the crest on their uniforms. It depicted half a plant.The Germinal Organization from Planet Aquamarine back in version one? Weren\u2019t they eliminated\u203dSuddenly, a guard swung his electric baton at Han Xiao and Han Xiao unconsciously raised a hand to block it. The ensuing current caused his whole body to spasm in pain. It felt like his bones were about to split and his entire body turned numb.Is the pain calibration at 100%\u203dGalaxy\u2019s pain calibration was restricted to a maximum of 40% because any higher setting could potentially cause nerve damage to players. The VR-capsule was also supposed to monitor the player\u2019s vitals to prevent this, but it was currently malfunctioning.It\u2019s only been seven years and the capsule is having problems? d.a.m.n it! The repairman I paid $300 to a few days ago told me that it would still be good for another six months! I want a refund!The guards yanked him up and took him to a small room where they locked him up alone in pitch black darkness.Han Xiao grimaced in pain as he ma.s.saged his wrist. His head continued to throb as more information poured in.It took Han Xiao a moment to reconcile the facts and make sense of what had happened to him.I\u2019ve\u2026 transmigrated into Galaxy?His eyes widened with amazement.Galaxy was a fully immersive virtual reality game that ran servers worldwide and boasted a peak concurrent player count of almost 60 million.The game was set in a vast universe with a world map and landscapes that were procedurally generated using the latest generation of quantum computers. The scale of its world was ma.s.sive, and it was said to be able to run smoothly even with a billion concurrent players. There existed many organizations and companies that specialized in farming gold and running dungeons, and the best pieces of gear could even go for ridiculous prices of up to a million US dollars.Being an extremely popular game, good balance was of the utmost important. While big spenders did have certain advantages, it was not so unfair to the extent that it displeased the casual players. Maintaining compet.i.tiveness and improving skills were key factors towards game balance, and Galaxy did a good job in these areas, facilitating its strong allure as an e-sport.Although Han Xiao did indeed make a living out of playing the game, the term \u2018professional gamer\u2019 didn\u2019t fit him well. He was, instead, one of the despised power levelers and preferred to work solo.Han Xiao had been playing the game since its very inception, and through the numerous patches, he had made a name for himself. In the last annual top 100 rankings, he placed 47th. He definitely had what it took to try his hand at going pro, but what he enjoyed most about the game was the leveling experience.\u201cThe Germinal Organization originates from one of the beginner planets new characters were sent to back in Version 1 of Galaxy: Planet Aquamarine,\u201d mumbled Han Xiao.Before transmigrating, Galaxy had already been operating for over a decade. Version 1.0 was ancient history.\u201cHave I time traveled too?\u201d Han Xiao\u2019s expression darkened.\u201cDoes that mean I won\u2019t be getting my three hundred dollars back\u203d\u201cAm I stupid\u203d That\u2019s the least of my concerns!\u201d Han Xiao slapped himself.His memories were still jumbled up, and he could not recall anything about his original life\u2014not even his name. All that he could recall were details regarding this world, such as its present era. He was currently in the year 687 of the Galaxy calendar, a year behind the updated timeline.In Version 1, there were three universal powers that were upholding a peace that had lasted for ten thousand years, since the era of exploration. They were the Commonwealth of Light, the Crimson Dynasty, and the Arcane Church. The Silver Revolutionary Army had yet to be formed, the one responsible for the Supernatural Disaster was still fighting for dear life on some desolate planet, the World of Light had not come into existence, the civilization of the World Tree had not yet invaded from the beyond, and the Shattered Belt that contained Planet Aquamarine was still budding inconspicuously along the fringes of the explored universe.In order to ensure that the game remained attractive, Galaxy borrowed and implemented ideas from its predecessors, such as \u2018WoW\u2019, where each version update revolved around a disaster or some major event. While Han Xiao enjoyed the game, now that he had transmigrated over\u2026\u201cGet me out!\u201dWhile the Germinal Organization was small fry compared to the interstellar powers introduced in later updates, to the currently powerless Han Xiao, it was an entirely different story.\u201cPlanet Aquamarine was modeled after Earth, and the Germinal Organization\u2019s aim is to overthrow this planet\u2019s government. If I\u2019m not wrong, Valkyrie test subjects are brainwashed to serve as cannon fodder.\u201dThe body he currently possessed had experienced a memory wipe. Apart from some general knowledge, all that remained were fragmented memories of captivity and experimentation.It seemed to be roughly twenty years old and bore a slight semblance to his original self. However, its state of health was as yet uncertain. He had heard the researchers mention that he had been injected with Valkyrie, one of the Germinal\u2019s gene altering drugs that was used to strengthen the brain. Valkyrie had a survival rate of only 30%, but this body had reacted positively to it.Suddenly, a glowing line of blue text blue appeared before his eyes._____________________You have been injected with Valkyrie!+1 EnduranceYou have learnt a new ability: ConcentrationYou have learnt a new ability: Low Level Willpower\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u201cVirtual interface!\u201d Han Xiao jumped for joy._____________________Name: Han XiaoRace: Human/Carbon-based (Yellow)Model: NPC (Countdown to Version 1.0 launch: 358 days 11 hours 03 minutes)Level: 1Experience: 0Main Cla.s.s: N.A.Sub-cla.s.s: Civilian Lv. 1 (0/50)Attributes: Strength 2, Dexterity 2, Endurance 3, Intelligence 3, Mystery 1, Charm 2, Luck 1Una.s.signed Stats: 0Energy: 0 (Lv. 0)Energy Rank: 1~2Grade: F (Mortal)[Piece of trash with a combat strength of 5; pick any NPC out from the streets and he will wipe the floor with you a hundred times!

Countdown timer?Han Xiao furrowed his brows as he organized his thoughts.First of all, although he had no idea how the interface had transmigrated together with him, he had to treat this world as his new reality, meaning that if he died, he could not bank on being able to resp.a.w.n like in a game.Secondly, he could still access the system\u2019s interface despite being cla.s.sified as an NPC. This suggested that he could still level up like a player, which was good news.Thirdly, if the countdown timer confirmed his suspicions that he had indeed traveled back in time to before the game\u2019s launch, did it mean that \u2018real\u2019 players would soon appear?Lastly, and most important of all, he was currently in grave danger!Han Xiao felt indignant. Didn\u2019t people who transmigrated normally receive perks such as resources, companions, or\u2026 at least an ex-girlfriend? At the very least, he should have started out in a safe location! The war hadn\u2019t even begun, and he was already a lone hero deep behind enemy lines. A single slip could prove fatal; he could very well end up in the Hall of Heroes\u2026 if such a place existed.Han Xiao only had one life here. If he died then that would be the end of it. It would be a pity.Yes, Han Xiao only felt that it would be \u2018a pity\u2019. \u2018I want to survive!\u2019 would be a more normal line of thought. As for variations such as \u2018My fate is not for the heavens to decide; if the heavens want to erase me, then I will erase the heavens!\u2019 or \u2018Swallow an aurous core to transcend life and death\u2019, such ramblings were exclusive to people with second-grade syndrome.\u201cWhat the h.e.l.l, why am I the only one SAO-ed?\u201d Han Xiao lamented.And while his senses confirmed that this was indeed reality, he started to wonder\u2026What exactly am I now? Am I an actual life-form, or am I just a bunch of data? Did my soul transmigrate, or is it something else entirely?He sighed. I guess I\u2019ll just have to make the best out of the situation and take it one step at a time.The essential thing was to survive.With a year to go before launch, he had enough time to get prepared; this was the sole glimmer of promise that he could cling on to.Clank!Suddenly, the door opened, and several people walked in. As he could only make out their silhouettes due to the light streaming in from outside, Han Xiao could not see their faces clearly. However, he could make out from their outlines that one of them was a woman with a fiery figure.\u201cThe subject\u2019s condition?\u201dSaid woman spoke to her subordinate in a voice that was smooth, yet intertwined with an ever-so-faint rasp, reminiscent of a cup of rich coffee.\u201cIt appears that the test subject has calmed down.\u201dThe experiment leader, Lin Wei Xian, answered the woman as he stared at Han Xiao pa.s.sionately, as though he were looking at a prized possession.\u201cWho are you people?\u201d Han Xiao asked hoa.r.s.ely.\u201cHmm? Amnesia\u2026?\u201d The woman\u2019s eye twitched.\u201cValkyrie stimulates the brain, so memory loss is not unexpected,\u201d replied Lin Wei Xian, squinting.When Han Xiao\u2019s eyes had finally adjusted to the light, he was stunned by the sight of the woman.Boasting a headful of luscious, burgundy hair that concealed part of her face, the woman wore a tight-fitting, jet black bodysuit from which her curvaceous figure threatened to burst out at any time.Her features were telling of her Western descent, but they were also composed of a certain softness that was characteristic of Eastern women; perhaps it was her mixed heritage that blessed her with such beauty and charm. In a different world, she could have been easily mistaken for a beautiful snake demoness.If Da Ji had possessed such beauty, then King Zhou did not die in vain! <sup>1</sup> thought Han Xiao.\u201cI am Hila, the commander here,\u201d said the red haired woman as she looked at Han Xiao. She waved a hand and ordered, \u201cConduct a blood test. I want to see the report ASAP.\u201dTwo stone-faced guards walked forward to yank him away. Their ma.s.sive bodies and the fact that they were carrying guns dispelled any notion that Han Xiao had of resisting.He recognized the \u2018Crimson Snake\u2019, Hila, and that this was one of the playable scenarios on Planet Aquamarine, Valkyrie Experiment Lab, located in a key base of Germinal.During Version 1, Hila was a boss who had caused beginners on Aquamarine much grief. She had many nicknames, one of which was the \u2018G.o.ddess of Death\u2019. She would eventually attain \u2018Celestial\u2019 cla.s.s strength and rise to prominence in the Cotton Cl.u.s.ter.Han Xiao laughed bitterly on the inside. The situation was bleak!Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

We will need to open the head up for a.s.sessment.\u201dOpen the head up? snapped Han Xiao inwardly. Open the head up\u203dHila waved a hand in dismissal of the idea.\u201cHe is the only subject to have ever survived the experiment. We\u2019ll leave that option out for now.\u201dHan Xiao\u2019s eyes lit up as he realized that his current status was somewhat advantageous for him.Lin Wei Xian was not pleased by Hila\u2019s decision, but he made no fuss about it.\u201cIn that case, we\u2019ll observe him for the time being to see if anything has changed.\u201d\u201cProceed with the brainwas.h.i.+ng,\u201d ordered Hila suddenly.Brainwas.h.i.+ng?Han Xiao\u2019s heart sank. Brainwas.h.i.+ng was a common method of subordination, and while in the game, a brainwashed character would simply become an ally of the faction, it was completely different now! Losing his sense of self was the worst-case scenario.No way!The good news was that memory altering technology available on the planet was still under-developed, so the organization\u2019s methods were very primitive; they made use of sensory stimuli to re-calibrate the subject. A character with at least ten points in Intelligence would be immune to the effects of the brainwash.Valkyrie had given Han Xiao a +1 boost to the growth potential of his Endurance. Growth potential was an innate stat that affected the growth rate of the affected stat. Different races had differing starting potentials in each stat, and in the entire world of Galaxy, humans generally had a mediocre growth rate. They did, however, boast the highest Intelligence potential. As they also possessed the lowest Health, this single point in Endurance growth potential was nice to have.[Concentration] gave him a 10% increase in mastery and crafting speeds, also increasing their success rates.[Low Level Willpower] gave him three points of Willpower, which subst.i.tuted for three points of Intelligence, so he still lacked three more Intelligence to survive the brainwash.Leveling the Civilian cla.s.s will boost a random stat by one, and also give me one una.s.signed stat point\u2026 but the chance for Intelligence to be boosted is extremely low\u2026Han Xiao knew that he could not rely on luck. In fact, he had always suspected that he was cursed. If a G.o.d or G.o.ddess did smile upon him, it would have to be the G.o.ddess of disaster. Rather than rely on luck, finding some way to learn a new cla.s.s was a more reliable idea.Although Han Xiao was incapable of moving freely, there had to be a way! After all, it was a scenario, wasn\u2019t it?Suddenly, he thought of something.If I\u2019m an NPC\u2026 I should be protected by the system\u2026 right?\u201cTake him,\u201d ordered Hila.Han Xiao was yanked away once again and brought to another room.Han Xiao noticed that there was a bookshelf in this room.< <tom>></tom>< >< <randt>></randt>\u2026They were all reference books.Hold on, there\u2019s a cla.s.s book there! rejoiced Han Xiao.Han Xiao disregarded the two guards behind him as he stood up to walk towards the shelf.His actions startled everyone, and instantly, the two guards were pointing guns at him.However, Han Xiao steeled his nerves and continued to approach the bookshelf.You\u2019d better not fire! he prayed. I\u2019m a valuable test subject!\u201cHold your fire! Let\u2019s see what he\u2019s up to,\u201d shouted Lin Wei Xian all of a sudden.The two guards hesitantly lowered their guns.Han Xiao heaved a sigh of relief. He had been banking everything on his status as the first successful subject.< <tom>></tom>This was the book that had caught Han Xiao\u2019s eye. He picked it out from the shelf and started flipping through.Although the long paragraphs of texts and complex diagrams were hard for Han Xiao to comprehend, he patiently read on. After twenty seconds or so, the interface lit up._____________________You have completed one session of self-learning in basic machinery knowledge![Basic a.s.sembly] has progressed by 2.0% (based on your Intelligence).(+0.2% from Concentration)\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afAs I expected!

It also gave a bonus to ranged attacks.Endurance increased Health and Energy. 1 Endurance gave 10 HP and 10 Energy. Endurance also affected some abilities and skills and increased HP and Energy recovery rates.All actions depleted Energy, be it attacking, blocking, walking, running, swimming, crafting, etc.Endurance also affected physical defense. There were many formulas contributing to the calculation of defense. For example, even if two characters\u2019 defense stats were equal, one of them might not be wearing metal armor, so they would take more damage from a bullet than the other character.Other factors that affected damage taken included Energy, range, bullet type, racial characteristics, and equipment material. All of these factors were taken into consideration when calculated by the quantum computer that the servers were run on. It was impossible for players to accurately optimize defense, but this wasn\u2019t that big of a deal, as having more defense could only be a good thing.Intelligence affected growth rates and Willpower. A character with higher Intelligence could master their skills faster. It also increased mastery and crafting speeds, and it could affect the quality of any machinery crafted by a Mechanic, making it the most important stat for the cla.s.s.Mystery affected a character\u2019s talent for supernatural powers, and it affected psychic powers and magic abilities, like how Strength or Dexterity affected physical abilities.Charm was useful when improving relations.h.i.+ps with different NPCs and Factions. It even enabled characters to enjoy discounts with certain sellers.Luck affected judgement and item drop rates.These were the seven main attributes that stat points could be added to.Then, there was also Energy, a core component of the game that functions as \u2018Mana\u2019 for superpowers. It could only be increased through leveling or by acquiring certain skills, and it was described as \u2018a manifestation of the dormant power that lies in living cells\u2019. Energy was a requirement to unlocking superpowers, as well as latent awakening.A character would also receive bonus stats based on their Energy level. Lv. 1 Energy was reached at 10 points, Lv. 2 at 50 points, and Lv. 3 at 100 points. Each Energy level would give random stats according to the character\u2019s cla.s.s, and a character with a higher level cla.s.s would benefit more from this. This bonus worked retroactively.Energy was also the mana for superpowers, and the additional stats received from Energy were lost when the amount of Energy remaining dropped below its tier.For example, Lv. 1 stat bonuses would be lost when Energy dropped below 10 points; the character would become fatigued after exhausting power, and this affected their combat ability. This mechanic made micromanagement in combat important.Energy recovered automatically but at a slow rate. However, Stamina could be used to recover Energy faster. Also, when using Superpowers without sufficient Energy, Stamina could be used as a subst.i.tute, and when there was both insufficient Energy and Stamina, Health could be used. Many players ended up dying carelessly by sucking themselves dry this way.A character\u2019s grade reflected their combat strength. Characters were ranked according to their grade. The standard unit of measurement for Energy was the Ona.Superhumans were graded A, B, C, D, or E, based on their Ona levels.An E-grade superhuman, such as the present-day Hila, possessed 100 Ouna.A Celestial-cla.s.s superhuman would fall under grade A. Grade A superhumans were capable of planetary-scale destruction.Of course, grade A wasn\u2019t the limit. Han Xiao knew this, having transcended grade A himself. However, then was then and now is now.Having gained two una.s.signed stat points from unlocking the Mechanic cla.s.s, Han Xiao still needed one more Intelligence in order to endure the brainwash.Apart from leveling up, there did not seem to be a way for him to obtain it. How was he supposed to gain experience? He obviously couldn\u2019t hunt monsters now or complete quests!d.a.m.n it, is there no way?Suddenly, an idea occurred to Han Xiao.He abruptly tossed the book to a side and proceeded to stare at the gun on the guard\u2019s waist with a blank expression.Hila frowned but did not act. Everyone looked on to see what Han Xiao was up to.Han Xiao walked rigidly towards the guard. As if to make his intentions extremely clear, he reached out exaggeratedly for the gun.The guard instinctively drew his gun, and although Han Xiao did not seem to have any intention of s.n.a.t.c.hing it, he tightened his grip.As Han Xiao was moving extremely slowly, the guard did not see a need to fire.\u201cUnload the gun and let him have it,\u201d ordered Hila.She was keen to know Han Xiao\u2019s motives.The guard obliged and proceeded to do so.Upon receiving the gun, some information popped up on Han Xiao\u2019s interface._____________________73-WASP (Small Caliber Handgun)Grade: GreyDamage: 28 -35Fire Rate: 1.1/sPower Output: 13Key components: Spring, Slide, Firing pin, Magazine (missing)\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af[Basic a.s.sembly] automatically gave Han Xiao knowledge about many types of machines, and the blueprints for a 73-WASP appeared in his mind.Instantly, Han Xiao understood how to a.s.semble it. While in the game he simply needed to \u2018load\u2019 the gun after \u2018learning\u2019 it, he now had to perform some more technical procedures.Everything was truly far more immersive than it had been in the game, confirming his suspicion that he had transmigrated to an actual \u2018reality\u2019.Han Xiao began to strip the handgun and rea.s.semble it.The skill icon for [Basic a.s.sembly] lit up.After 40 seconds, he finished the task.To a specialist, 40 seconds was nothing. However, Han Xiao was a complete newbie!He had only spent 10 minutes on a book!Everyone was shocked.Is this the effect of Valkyrie\u203dLin Wei Xian started speaking excitedly. \u201cSuch learning prowess!

It began to display all kinds of geometric shapes and patterns that morphed continuously. The vivid, rapidly changing colors and harshly alternating music caused Han Xiao much discomfort. While he wanted to close his eyes badly, he was unable to, and soon, his eyeb.a.l.l.s turned bloodshot and swollen.Ah! This is so uncomfortable!It was a primitive method of brainwas.h.i.+ng. The theory behind it was to overwhelm and distort the subject\u2019s thoughts to make it easier to feed messages into their mind.It did, however, have the advantage of not causing permanent damage to the brain, which both Han Xiao and Lin Wei Xian could appreciate.The depraved expression on Lin Wei Xian\u2019s face enraged Han Xiao.

The boss had a.s.signed her the task of brainwas.h.i.+ng Han Xiao, so she had to ensure that everything went smoothly.She undid Han Xiao\u2019s shackles, revealing bruises on his limbs. Although Han Xiao was still hurting, he continued to look at the screen blankly in order to act the part.Hila suddenly bent forward, and her face came to within two inches of his. Her moist breath fell upon his lips, but Han Xiao was far too concerned with his predicament to be distracted.Perfume filled up his nostrils, tickling him, and it took great effort on his part to resist the urge to sneeze.\u201cWho are you?\u201d asked Hila in a soft, hypnotic voice.Han Xiao decided to twitch his face instead of replying.Although Han Xiao had never been a good actor, it wasn\u2019t too hard to act like an idiot.Suddenly, Hila began to whisper into his ear. As her hair tickled Han Xiao\u2019s throat, two snowy mountains came into his view through the window of her collar. He steeled his heart with a prayer.Between the mountains is a valley, empty like the void.Atop the seas stands an island, straight as a tree.I, who have seen over a hundred gourds, will not fall for your bait!\u201cFrom today onward, your name is Zero. The Germinal Organization is your home, your country, and your everything. You will forever be loyal to the organization and will forever strive to help the organization achieve its goals. You will neither hide anything from nor betray the organization. You will carry out your orders faithfully, and you will sacrifice yourself for the greater good when the time comes!\u201dLin Wei Xian broke out in manic laughter.\u201cYour life belongs to the organization. You will do whatever you are ordered to do,\u201d he added.\u201cWho are you?\u201d re-questioned Hila.This time, Han Xiao knew that he had to reply. However, he did not reply immediately.Hila shot a frown towards Lin Wei Xian.\u201cI followed the procedure! It\u2019s not my fault\u2014\u201dSuddenly, Han Xiao began to speak.\u201cI\u2026 am\u2026 Zero\u2026\u201dLin Wei Xian\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cValkyrie strengthened Zero\u2019s learning ability. However, as a side effect, it impaired his speech.\u201dHila thought back to Zero\u2019s earlier behavior. He had indeed responded slowly to his surroundings.\u201cSeems like the experiment was not perfect after all.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. This is perfection! He does not need emotions.\u201d\u201c\u2026Take him to recover, I will report to the boss.\u201dI\u2019m safe now!Han Xiao could finally relax. He had come up with the idea of acting slow to lower their guard during the procedure.Although I didn\u2019t transmigrate to an ideal location, at least it\u2019s not so bad time-wise.The Valkyrie experiment was the prototype of a later supersoldier project that implemented microchips into test subjects in order to ensure loyalty.Transmigrating to then would have been way worse. They would have been able to blow him up anytime.At least Lady Luck is smiling upon me in one regard!\u2026Hila made a call through an encrypted line.\u201cBoss, the situation has stabilized.\u201d\u201cIs the brainwas.h.i.+ng complete?\u201dThe man\u2019s voice was hoa.r.s.e.\u201cI oversaw the procedure. There was no issue.

Don\u2019t cross the line.\u201dHila clenched her fists.\u2026The interior of the underground Valkyrie lab was almost entirely white. Guards constantly patrolled the grounds.After a night\u2019s rest, Han Xiao was brought to an isolated training field where Hila awaited.While he was not too sure of what arrangements the organization had for him, he was certain that they would value his \u2018learning ability\u2019, meaning he would definitely get the chance to level up his Mechanic abilities.It was virtually impossible to escape from such a tightly guarded fortress, so Han Xiao had steeled himself for the long haul.\u201cZero, you will undergo daily combat and shooting practice from today onward.\u201dHila tossed a suit to him.\u201cPut it on.\u201dHan Xiao quickly wore it.As soon as he put the suit on, Hila attacked, launching a vicious kick at chest level.Bang!Too fast!Han Xiao was unable to react, and the kick cracked his ribs through armour. He staggered back over a dozen paces and clutched onto his chest, coughing.As expected of a superhuman.Although she was obviously not going all out, she was still several times faster than an ordinary person.\u201c30 seconds of rest,\u201d she stated blandly.Combat training was tough, but straightforward. No words were exchanged between the pair.They continued like this for two hours, by the end of which Han Xiao was completely exhausted and covered in bruises. He also now suspected that Hila had m.a.s.o.c.h.i.s.tic tendencies.\u2018Are all ice queen types like this?\u2019 he wondered._____________________Hila (Lv. 30) has taught you [Basic Combat]Progress Rate: 5%\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afHila left wordlessly.A stout, burly man arrived to yank Han Xiao to the target practice field.\u201cI am your shooting trainer, and one of the vice-managers of this base, Baltar,\u201d introduced the scary looking man with a hideous knife scar across his forehead.He pushed a 73-WASP into Han Xiao\u2019s hands and said, \u201cThere\u2019s ten bullets, hit the bullseye with all of them.\u201dHan Xiao frowned. How could a beginner who had never touched a gun in real life before hit the bullseye\u203d Moreover, the target was a moving dummy 30 metres away.\u201cI\u2019m no Olympic champion!\u201dHan Xiao shrugged his shoulders and raised the gun with his aching arms.Bang, bang, bang\u2026!After ten shots, Han Xiao took a look at the scoreboard.

It was only with great restraint that he did not scream out.He turned around, only to see a frenzied Baltar licking blood off a black tactical knife.\u201cContinue. One miss, one cut.

Although it healed his wounds, the pain from the cuts still lingered.There was an unused machinery tuning room in the base, and as Han Xiao had demonstrated some talent with machines, he was arranged to reside there. In the room were materials, tools, and a vehicle bench that he was given free rein to use. There were also shelves of books lined against the wall. Although there was a surveillance camera in a corner of the room, Han Xiao paid no heed to it\u2014he had expected to be monitored 24/7.In the present year 687, Aquamarine was still a relatively new planet in the grand scheme of things. The planet was in the midst of a transition towards a \u2018new era\u2019, hence its technologies were still quite far behind for a sci-fi game, similar to that of Earth.Mechanic talents were split into three trees. Each talent tree had over 20 talents that were divided into the five levels of basic, intermediate, advanced, expert, and master. Talents formed the core of a character\u2019s cla.s.s.Learning a cla.s.s unlocks the first talent, and subsequent talents require talent points.There are three ways to obtain talent points: through leveling, special quests, or mastering a skill.Han Xiao decided to hold on to his two talent points. Talents were not yet a major concern for him. Many new players spent them as soon as they got them, but talent points actually became harder to come by in the later stages of the game. They were to be used wisely.Outside of training, Han Xiao was basically free to do whatever he could, and he spent all his time on machinery in order to acc.u.mulate as much experience as possible to escape this prison.\u2026Time went by quickly.Han Xiao continued to a.s.semble and enhance machines to gain experience, and as he improved, his perfection rate in a.s.sembly consistently hit over 90%. This gave him a lot of bonus experience.Although a.s.sembling the same kind of machine too many times gradually decreased the experience gained\u2014up to a point where it would not yield any experience at all\u2014there was an armory in the base that was essentially a gold mine of machines, providing Han Xiao with all the resources he needed to gain experience through a.s.sembly.Han Xiao kept a low profile and continued to remain quiet and docile. Gradually, the organization also stopped monitoring him so closely.Although the organization had high hopes for him, he knew that standing out would only be disadvantageous, so he chose to acc.u.mulate experience instead of leveling up when he could.Very soon, the research team lost interest in him. The degree of skill that he displayed in a.s.sembly was easily attainable by trained logistics personnel, and he simply did not fulfill their expectations.They continued observing him for another month before writing him off as a failure. Instead of wasting more time on him, they chose to devote their efforts elsewhere and ceased the 24/7 surveillance.This allowed Han Xiao to relax a little.As the organization\u2019s attention gradually s.h.i.+fted away from him, eventually, only Lin Wei Xian and Baltar continued to keep tabs on him.Although Lin Wei Xian\u2019s continued requests to dissect Han Xiao for research were still being rejected, Han Xiao knew that it was only a matter of time before they would be approved. There was not much time left for him.As for Baltar, Han Xiao had become the sole target of his affection. As recovery pills were readily available, and the researchers believed that torture could stimulate growth, Baltar was allowed to indulge in his s.a.d.i.s.tic ways.Han Xiao gradually grew numb to the pain.With nothing much to do and no one to converse to, Han Xiao channeled his focus and thoughts into studying machinery. He found solace in the sense of accomplishment that crafting brought him.\u2026One day, a number of armored guards came to the tuning room to move a large portion of Han Xiao\u2019s resources away. As Han Xiao watched them quietly, a person walked up to him.\u201cYou have let the organization down. From today onward, your resources will be cut by 80%.\u201dThe person who spoke to Han Xiao was test subject No. 1.\u201cI heard that you are my predecessor. With so many resources, is all you can make garbage like this?\u201cYou are a failure, and I have been chosen to replace you.\u201dFor some reason, the sight of Han Xiao irked No. 1. Han Xiao remained silent.The organization prioritized results. Since Han Xiao was not giving them results, he was being stripped of his privileges. They planned to devote their resources to grooming the more promising No. 1.As the research lab did not have any maintenance personnel for machinery, Han Xiao still got to keep the tuning room for himself. He was now a.s.signed to perform maintenance and repairs.\u201cTsk tsk, sad rats.\u201dA few guards who saw the pair conversed among themselves.\u201cBrainwashed lab rats. Fated to be sacrificed.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d rather die than end up like that.\u201d\u201cShh, they can hear us.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter does it? They\u2019ve already been brainwashed anyway.\u201dTo them, test subjects were less than animals.Han Xiao walked away silently.\u2026Half a year pa.s.sed.In this period of time, Han Xiao managed to figure out the layout of the entire facility and the routines of the staff.The Valkyrie Laboratory, commanded by Hila, was an underground facility that comprised of three floors. Because it was a secret base, it wasn\u2019t built to be very big, and was concealed within an uninhabited forest. Its supplies were delivered by airdrop.A total of 60 armored guards patrolled the facility. Every now and then, the organization would send a batch of test subjects who had had their memories wiped here for experimentation.Although there were a dozen so other Valkyrie laboratories, this base was the main one. After Han Xiao and No. 1, the Germinal Organization had managed to produce another 76 successful test subjects.While most of them had already been transferred to other facilities, No. 1 and nine other exceptional test subjects were chosen to form a squad, and they were still awaiting orders here.Han Xiao had grown accustomed to his life here. Aside from training, he spent all his time working with machines in the tuning room. The room had become a haven of sorts for him.The guards gradually began to ignore his presence and when he pa.s.sed by, they would simply gloss over him as though he were invisible.This was extremely advantageous for Han Xiao, who was tirelessly gaining as much experience as he could. He also tried to memorize as many blueprints as he could.The experience that a.s.sembly and enhancement rewarded were separate. When Han Xiao could no longer gain experience from a.s.sembling a certain machine, he would proceed to work on enhancing it. He was always careful to revert the machinery back to its original state after enhancing so as to keep his abilities a secret.After many hours of training, Han Xiao also managed to master the two skills of [Basic Combat] and [Basic Shooting] and unexpectedly unlocked a pa.s.sive ability called [Grinder], which gave him +100 Health.He also unlocked the sub-cla.s.s of [Agent], and was now at a character level of 4.After his continued efforts, [Basic a.s.sembly] and [Basic Enhancement] reached Lv. 4, while [Basic Combat] and [Basic Shooting] reached Lv. 2.Mechanics required substantial amounts of resources and currency for growth, and while this would normally be a limitation to the cla.s.s, Han Xiao had access to free materials from the organization.He had used up almost 90% of the machines in the armory, acc.u.mulating a total of 600,00 experience!Without monsters or missions, only mechanics could earn so much experience in such a short amount of time.\u2026\u201cGive Lin Wei Xian the green light. He has asked repeatedly. He may dissect Zero,\u201d ordered the boss over the line.Hila frowned.\u201cYou rejected him repeatedly.\u201d\u201cThe organization has devoted so much resources to him already. We must gain something in return,\u201d said the boss plainly. \u201cThe only worth that trash has is in being recycled. That, is Zero\u2019s fate.\u201dHila bit her lip.\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\u201cWhat are the results of No. 1 and his team\u2019s training?\u201d continued the boss.\u201cVery promising. I see potential in them.\u201d\u201cVery good. Send them to the Night Owl base for training, I have already sent the Night Owl squad to receive them. They will arrive in two or three days.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the day I visit my sister!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to follow them.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With a mighty twist, he threw Hila over his shoulder.However, it was ineffective. Hila effortlessly nullified the shoulder throw by performing a flip.Han Xiao paused to rub his chest.\u201cIs that all that you are capable of?\u201d Hila was visibly upset.Han Xiao remained silent. He had expected the organization to have given up on him with what little progress he had shown, but for the past six months, Hila had dutifully trained with him every single day. For some reason, though, she was going especially hard on him today.Although Hila was the commander of this base, she did not have much work to do. Training Han Xiao was actually one of the few things that she had to look forward to. When she had learnt of the boss\u2019s intention to hand him to Lin Wei Xian, it had upset her.Although they had never actually conversed before, it was 6 months of accompaniment regardless. A person could even develop feelings for an object if he or she spent that much time with it! Perhaps, due to having grown used to seeing Han Xiao everyday, Hila was a bit reluctant to hand him over.\u201cHow many times has it been?\u201d she wondered. \u201cAll those people\u2026 all those faces\u2026\u201dThe organization\u2019s cruel methods had not only caused her to lose many of her friends\u2014she had also lost her sister.The reason she had pushed Han Xiao harder today was to try and stimulate him. She had hoped to be able to draw out any latent talent in him.However, it had clearly been too much to ask for.\u201cThe boss has approved of Lin Wei Xian\u2019s request to dissect you\u2026\u201d She sighed.Strictly speaking, this was the first time she had ever spoken of anything outside of training to Han Xiao.Han Xiao\u2019s eyes flashed.Finally\u2026Although Han Xiao had been antic.i.p.ating this from the moment he decided to lie low, he did not regret doing so\u2014his background made it impossible for him to rise up through the ranks, which meant that he would only be able to continue on as a henchman. Either way, Han Xiao did not wish to work for the organization.Suddenly, Han Xiao noticed a photograph on the ground. It seemed to have fallen out of Hila\u2019s pocket during their fight. Han Xiao bent down to pick it up.It was a group photo set in front of a vast, blue sea that was basking under a setting sun.Two girls stood side by side in the center. One of them was Hila, who was smiling radiantly. The other girl had snow-white hair and seemed to resemble Hila somewhat. She looked both clever and gentle.Hila\u2019s face changed upon realizing that she had dropped the photo. She immediately bent down to s.n.a.t.c.h for it. When she saw that it was undamaged, she let out a sigh of relief. As she pocketed it, she took a final, probing look at Han Xiao before turning around to leave.The interface suddenly lit up with a message._____________________You have initiated a D-Cla.s.s Quest:[Night Owl Plans]Accept / Decline\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afHan Xiao\u2019s eyes lit up. My first mission in six months\u203dAccept!_____________________Quest Synopsis:The dark and blood-stained advent of the Germinal Organization has always been a great mystery to the Six Nations of Planet Aquamarine. Hila has a secret past that no one knows about. Where do her loyalties truly lie? You now hold one of the clues to this mystery. Will you seek to uncover the truth?(You may choose to pa.s.s this clue on to someone else for a small reward.)\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afThe quest had obviously been initiated by the photo.Han Xiao knew who the white-haired girl was. She was none other than Hila\u2019s younger sister, Aurora.While the sisters both possessed supernatural powers, their powers were of two extremes.Aurora\u2019s blood possessed mysterious healing properties that could extend life or even bring back the dead. She had been brainwashed, and was now being controlled by the Germinal. Not only were they taking advantage of her powers, they were also using her as leverage to make Hila do their bidding.Hila only cared for one person, and that was Aurora.The war between the six countries and the Germinal Organization reached a climax at the conclusion of Version 1.0.As a last resort, the Germinal Organization used Aurora\u2019s flesh and blood to create an endless supply of miracle drugs that won them the war. Hila, who had been at the front lines at the time, only learnt of what had happened a few months later.Losing her sister tore her apart, and the Germinal Organization took advantage of her moment of weakness to capture and imprison her.After her escape, she became cold-blooded and ruthless, going so far as to sacrifice countless of lives in order to awaken her latent powers.She turned to the dark side and stopped at nothing to gain power, eventually coming to be known as the \u2018G.o.ddess of Death\u2019 whose very name spread fear throughout the Shattered Belt.Although the present Hila was cold, compared to the future G.o.ddess of Death who wielded the power to wipe out entire civilizations, she was a billion times nicer.If he had the chance, Han Xiao would definitely do his best to alter her tragic fate \u2013 not out of pity, but to prevent her from destroying his fleet of s.p.a.ces.h.i.+ps. However, he was still far too weak to do anything. Escaping the base was his primary goal.Han Xiao knew from Hila\u2019s routine the past six months that she would leave the lab in two days.That would be the perfect chance.Han Xiao returned to the tuning room and summoned the interface. He currently possessed two sub-cla.s.ses, and one main cla.s.s: Civilian, Agent, and Mechanic (Novice).Of the five main cla.s.ses, Mechanics were weaker in the early stages of the game. They were also more intended to be a support cla.s.s early on. In Version 3.0, however, they would receive new talents that greatly buffed their combat capabilities to become one of the more popular cla.s.ses.In the later stages of the game, a high-level Mechanic was akin to an entire galactic fleet.Mechanics were well known for having many skills. Each blueprint itself could be seen as a skill, and since there were thousands of blueprints of machines, Mechanics could be played in any number of ways. The slew of skills at their disposal made them adept at all sorts of tactics and warfare.Nevertheless, they had a glaring weakness\u2014they needed more experience than other cla.s.ses to level up.Han Xiao contemplated for a moment before dumping all the experience he could into [Mechanic], initiating a leveling frenzy._____________________Engineer (Novice) has been raised to Lv. 3+ 10 Energy, + 1 INT, + 1 END+ 2 una.s.signed stat points+ 1 talent point\u2026Engineer (Novice) has been raised to Lv. 10 (max)+ 30 Energy, + 1 INT, + 1 END+ 2 una.s.signed stat points+ 1 talent point\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afIt took 130,000 experience to level Lv. 2 Mechanic (Novice) to Lv. 10. As a result, Han Xiao gained 8 Endurance, 8 Intelligence, 100 Energy, 16 stat points, 8 talent points, and was now Lv. 12.It was usually more cost-effective to raise the level of the main cla.s.s first as it gave more Energy.As Han Xiao did not meet the requirement for cla.s.s advancement yet, he could not level [Mechanic] up any further.Most cla.s.ses had a starting level cap of Lv. 10 that could only be exceeded after performing an advancement.Han Xiao continued to use 80,000 experience to level up [Agent] to Lv. 9. He gained +12 Strength, +9 Dexterity, +3 Charm, 9 talent points, and 9 points of una.s.signed stats from this, and hit Lv. 20.While a character could have any number of cla.s.ses, Lv. 20 was the maximum character level before completing the special advancement mission. In the game, the maximum level was usually raised every major update. In Version 1.0, it was Lv. 60.Galaxy had hundreds of cla.s.ses and this gave players unlimited combinations to play around with. It made it common for a character to have individualized skill-sets. As there was no fixed strategy in particular, each and every character could be skilled uniquely. This was one of the game\u2019s strong points.Han Xiao discovered an anomaly! His interface did not display a maximum level! This could mean that he was allowed to exceed the limits of a regular character!The gameplay of Version 1.0 and Version 2.0 was mostly based around the beginner planets. Although the stronger civilizations in the universe were already implemented from the start, players were unable to interact with them. Han Xiao wondered if his NPC status would have any impact on this._____________________Lv. 20 Advancement Mission:Learn an advanced Mechanic skill.\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afAs one of the requirements to learning an advanced Mechanic skill was to gain advanced knowledge, Han Xiao had no way to proceed with the advancement.He used another 150,000 experience to raise [Basic a.s.sembly] and [Basic Enhancement] to their Lv. 10 each, thereby gaining two talent points.He then used 10,000 experience to raise the level of his [Machinery Affinity (Novice)] to Lv. 3.After some calculations, Han Xiao proceeded to use 60,000 experience to reach Lv. 6 in both [Basic Combat] and [Basic Shooting], and this unlocked [Grappling] and [Precise Aim].He intended to use the remaining 170,000 experience to do some \u2018blueprint gambling\u2019.Blueprints were an important feature of the Mechanic cla.s.s. The first method of obtaining them would be through leveling talents.The second method would be through completing missions\u2014some missions rewarded blueprints.The third way through perform reverse engineering, done by disa.s.sembling machinery. However, on top of certain conditions and requirements, this method expended experience points.The fourth way\u2014and the most important one\u2014was through combining talents. This method also expended experience points.As there were 60 talents, and the same type of combination could yield different kinds of blueprints, the possibilities were endless. Some blueprints even had hidden prerequisites, making it hard to determine exactly how many blueprints could be derived from a certain combination.The experience needed to perform talent combination also increased with each attempt, and if the player received the same blueprint again, the experience expended would not be compensated. This it is why talent combination was widely known as \u2018blueprint gambling\u2019.As useful as it was, it did consume a lot of experience.Back to before he had transmigrated, players had discovered and researched thousands of combinations, and Han Xiao was familiar with many of them! As a Mechanic, he would be able to overcome the early weaknesses of the cla.s.s as there were a few rare blueprints of G.o.dly equipment that could be crafted by a Novice Engineer!Besides the four methods of obtaining blueprints above, there was also a lesser used method known as \u2018free creation\u2019, where players were allowed to freely create machines that they conceptualized. However, this method had an abysmal success rate.The success rate of free creation depends on various factors such as the viability of the concept itself, the quality of the materials, the character\u2019s level in knowledge, certain abilities, tools used, and so on. Before Han Xiao transmigrated, players still had not managed to figure out the exact science behind it. It was simply too hard to succeed at this method, causing it to be largely viewed as a waste of time and effort.As Han Xiao had gained 19 talent points from leveling his cla.s.ses, and 2 points from maxing two of his skills, he now had a total of 21 talent points.Han Xiao proceeded to pick out two books from the shelf before summoning the interface._____________________Use 1 talent point to unlock the Weaponry branch talent: [Basic Mechanical Engineering].

This continued for ten minutes.When he was done, he used another two talent points to raise them to Lv. 2, increasing his degree of comprehension for them.\u201cCombining these two Lv. 2 talents can yield 6 types of blueprints. Each combination will double the required experience for the next. The first combination requires 10,000 experience, so 170,000 experience will allow me to combine 4 times.

It had proven harder to craft than expected. In the game, blueprint crafting was guided\u2014the player simply needed to input the materials and follow a few simplified steps. Now, however, Han Xiao had to do everything manually. It wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing though, as it did give him the freedom to make small modifications.Although the organization had taken away most of Han Xiao resources, there was still enough left for him to work with. He had primarily used manganese, a tough alloy well suited for making weapons and armour.While the design of the Lightweight Mecha Arm was very basic, it would have to suffice.Han Xiao put down the wrench in his hand. The Lightweight Mecha Arm was now complete._____________________Lightweight Mecha Arm (Left)Quality: AverageBasic Stats\u2013 Damage: 35~58\u2013 Defense: 13~17\u2013 Power Level: 38\u2013 Durability: 270/270Equip Requirement: 25 STRStat Bonus: -3 SpeedLength: 0.51 mWeight: 14.7 kgAdditional Bonus: +10 STR\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afHan Xiao gained 3000 experience points from crafting the arm. Crafting generally rewarded more experience than a.s.sembly or enhancement.Han Xiao currently had 21 STR, so he needed to spend another 4 stat points to equip the mecha arm.After crafting the mecha arm, Han Xiao crafted a 73-WASP and enhanced it to 38-47 damage. He also forged a 10 damage carbide tactical knife.He hid the Lightweight Mecha Arm and the enhanced 73-WASP before heading out to the canteen.The canteen was like a recreation room of sorts for the staff in the facility. They would come here to relax and while away the time. Han Xiao had learnt a lot of information from eavesdropping on their conversations.A groups of guards were chatting nosily.\u201cI want to go outside too! Being confined for so long is getting on my nerves.\u201d\u201cWell, Hila\u2019s an officer. Her status is much higher than ours.\u201d\u201cMan, I\u2019d do anything to spend a night with her.\u201d\u201cHey, watch your mouth. Do you know why she\u2019s an officer?\u201d\u201cBecause\u2026 she\u2019s a superhuman?\u201d\u201cOf course she is!\u201dHan Xiao rejoiced at the confirmation of Hila\u2019s absence.\u201cLooks like today is the day,\u201d he murmured to himself.Han Xiao got up and headed to bas.e.m.e.nt 3. His target was the surveillance room.There were two guards stationed outside the surveillance room. Before entering the corridor, Han Xiao slapped a piece of half-chewed bread onto the surveillance camera.He had learnt that the guards did not take their s.h.i.+fts seriously, and true enough, nothing happened even after a while.After composing himself, Han Xiao entered the corridor and approached the two guards.\u201cNo unauthorized personnel,\u201d warned the first guard.\u201cIt\u2019s Zero. Just shoo him away,\u201d laughed the second.The first guard nodded. He was about to push Han Xiao away when, suddenly, Han Xiao grabbed hold of his wrist and stabbed the second guard in the chin with a knife. The knife pierced all the way into the guard\u2019s brain.Han Xiao then immediately maneuvered around the first guard to perform a chokehold on him.Crack!Han Xiao had dispatched of both guards in an instant!_____________________You have dealt a fatal blow!You have dealt a fatal blow!\u201c-162\u201d\u201c-171\u201dYou have killed a Guard of the Germinal Organization, gaining 360 experience!You have killed a Guard of the Germinal Organization, gaining 360 experience!\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afHan Xiao carefully placed the guard on the ground before checking their stats._____________________Lv. 7 Agent10 STR, 15 END150 Health\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af_____________________You have acquired 4 bullets.\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afHan Xiao re-equipped the dagger before slowly pus.h.i.+ng the door open.A jaw-dropping sight greeted him.Two guards were pressed together in an extremely compromising position.

Should I just pretend like nothing happened and step out? wondered Han Xiao.Han Xiao did not have anything in particular against any group of people. He respected people\u2019s hobbies and interests. These two men before him were simply two lonely hearts who had had no way of releasing their pent-up frustrations. Over time, their common bond developed into something special\u2026It\u2019s not your fault! It\u2019s Tokiomi\u2019s <sup>1</sup> \u2014I mean\u2014it\u2019s just how things ended up!Although Han Xiao\u2019s mind was dulled with such thoughts, his body was quick to act. Reversing his grip on his knife, he rushed forward to attack the closer guard.The guard was unable to react in time, and as he fumbled to draw his gun, Han Xiao went in for the kill.Unfortunately, the second guard kicked him to safety.Han Xiao\u2019s surprise attack had failed, but he was not disheartened. Twirling the knife in his hand, he switched back to a standard grip and stabbed the second guard in his abdomen, followed by striking his neck with his free hand. The guard collapsed to the ground._____________________Overwhelming Force!You have 25 Strength.

Their skills had the coolest names, such as \u2018Inferno Quake\u2019, \u2018Devil\u2019s Beam\u2019, or \u2018Star Breaker\u2019. Of course, many skills were not actually as powerful as their names suggested, but the point is that they sounded cool!Shouting out the skill\u2019s name as you used it also always seemed to make it stronger. Although most players weren\u2019t thick skinned enough to do so, Han Xiao enjoyed it.Pugilists were also a much simpler cla.s.s to play \u2013 basically, just keep on hitting the enemy. Compared to the most demanding cla.s.s to play, the Mechanic, the difference was night and day.Han Xiao used his knife to finish the two unconscious guards. He looted four magazines of bullets from them.He then moved the bodies of the other two guards into the room, cleaned up the bloodstains in the corridor, and smashed up all the security monitors. After confirming that he had not missed anything, Han Xiao emerged from the room with his usual blank expression on once more.Eliminating the surveillance room was important to Han Xiao\u2019s escape \u2013 it allowed him to move freely.Han Xiao returned to the second floor where a guard suddenly stopped him.\u201cMr. Lin Wei Xian wants to see you.\u201dHan Xiao\u2019s eyes flashed.Lin Wei Xian was one of the few people in the base who possessed a security pa.s.s that could access the main gate. He was saving Han Xiao the trouble of looking for him.Han Xiao followed the guard to Lin Wei Xian\u2019s private laboratory. It was a dimly lit room. The walls were lined with shelves of specimen jars filled with organs \u2013 almost like the private collection of a homicidal murderer.\u201cThe organization has finally let me have you. If I dissect you, I will be able to find out the difference between you and the other test subjects. After extracting all the valuable information your body has to offer, I will preserve your corpse as a specimen. You will be fondly remembered as the first test subject.\u201dHan Xiao remained silent in the dark.\u201cYou there, secure him tightly and don\u2019t let him struggle. It\u2019ll ruin my experiment,\u201d ordered Lin Wei Xian.He then proceeded to turn around to retrieve his toolbox of oddly-shaped surgical knifes and scalpels. Before Han Xiao, how many had fallen prey to them?Suddenly, Lin Wei Xian heard a dull thud from behind. He turned around, only to discover that Han Xiao was standing right behind him.Before he could react, Lin Wei Xian felt a pain in his chest. Looking down blankly, he saw that a knife was stabbed directly into his heart.His eyes widened with shock as he dropped the surgical knife he was holdingHe could see the motionless guard lying on the floor behind Han Xiao, as well as the coldness in Han Xiao\u2019s eyes.Right! This room is under surveillance!Han Xiao seemed to have read his mind. \u201cGive up. I\u2019ve already cleaned the surveillance room.\u201dThat tone\u2026 is this really that dim-witted Zero?Lin Wei Xian shuddered as the color in his face drained quickly.\u201cHalf\u2026 half a year\u2026 you\u2019ve been faking it all along?\u201dHan Xiao nodded.\u201cHow is that possible\u2026 You\u2019ve fooled everyone!\u201d Lin Wei Xian wondered aloud, incredulous.\u201cNothing is impossible in this world.\u201d Han Xiao twisted the knife viciously.Lin Wei Xian crumpled to the ground, wide-eyed in indignation and terror.\u201cI\u2026 am your\u2026 creator\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There were usually four people in the base that he had to watch out for \u2013 Hila, No. 1, Lin Wei Xian, and Baltar. As Hila was not in, No. 1 had left, and Lin Wei Xian was a non-factor now, Han Xiao\u2019s escape would proceed smoothly as long as he did not encounter Baltar.The main gate to the base was a reinforced steel door almost one metre thick. Even if Han Xiao used all the explosives in the armory, it would still not be enough to blast it open. The only way to escape would be through unlocking it, and only three people possessed the security pa.s.s to do so. One of them was none other than Lin Wei Xian, and, naturally, Han Xiao had already acquired his pa.s.s.However, as the main gate was heavily manned, and everyone knew exactly who possessed a pa.s.s, escaping was not that straightforward.If Han Xiao so much as appeared at the main gate, he would be surrounded by heavy fire in mere seconds. One bullet would do only 10 damage to him, but add them all up and he would be lucky to last for even a second.Mm, not a bad way to go, he thought, but I think I\u2019ll come up with a better idea.Han Xiao\u2019s plan was to cripple their communications in order to gain a few hours of time. This was the safest option. Currently, he was heading back to the tuning room to retrieve the mecha arm first.As the tuning room came into sight, Han Xiao was suddenly pushed from the side. To his horror, the person who had pushed him was none other than Baltar.Why am I so unlucky\u203d he groaned inwardly.\u201cWhich squad are you from?\u201d questioned Baltar. \u201cWhy have I never seen you before?\u201dHan Xiao lowered his head and pushed his cap down.\u201cI\u2019m new here. I\u2019m from squad B.\u201d\u201cWhy was I not informed of new guards? Hold on, your voice sounds familiar. Raise your head and show me your face.\u201dHan Xiao noticed that Baltar was slowly reaching for his handgun. Three guards nearby had also sensed that something was amiss.What should I do now?If Han Xiao were exposed now, Baltar would definitely send guards to look for Lin Wei Xian. That would be disastrous.\u201cThis is a problem\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to have to resort to plan B\u2026\u201d muttered Han Xiao.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201dSuddenly, Han Xiao raised his head to reveal his face to Baltar.\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to tell you this: go see a shrink, psycho!\u201d\u201cZero\u203d\u201dHan Xiao took advantage of his confusion and thrust his knife into Baltar\u2019s chest.Unfortunately, Baltar dodged on reflex, and Han Xiao\u2019s knife only grazed his chin.\u201cFire!\u201dThe three guards hastily reached out to draw their guns. Unfortunately, they were too close to Han Xiao, and Han Xiao managed to close in on them before they could fire. He sent a fist smas.h.i.+ng into the nearest guard\u2019s face.-48!The punch sent the guard flying backwards into his comrades.Han Xiao gritted his teeth as he turned around to make a dash for the tuning room.Baltar\u2019s face darkened as he felt his chin. As he gave chase, he shouted into the transmitter on his collar, \u201cAll agents, listen up! Come to the tuning room on the second floor at once! Test subject Zero has gone rogue!\u201dAll the guards who heard the news were stunned.\u201cZero? Gone rogue? Are you sure\u203d\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t he brainwashed?\u201d\u201cIs this a drill?\u201d\u201cAre you dumb? Didn\u2019t you hear the gunshots\u203d\u201dHan Xiao became strangely calm under the a.s.sault of Baltar\u2019s gunfire. As his brain began to process all the variables and data in his surroundings, the world before him astonis.h.i.+ngly changed. Han Xiao\u2019s surroundings began to be reduced to 3D lines, as though his mind were filtering out all the clutter \u2013 making everything look clear to him. Somehow, he had entered a state of mind in which all his brain\u2019s functions were heightened.\u201c2.0 seconds to reach the tuning room. 3.7 seconds for Baltar to catch up. The three guards will not pose any threat for another 4.2 seconds. Roughly 30.0 seconds before reinforcements arrive\u2026\u201dHan Xiao had been through countless battles before. Although they were all from his time in the game, it was still experience. And it was precisely experience that enabled him to tap into this special state.He started to run in an irregular pattern to dodge the bullets.\u201cInteresting. The toy wants to resist,\u201d mused a frenzied Baltar. \u201cYou asked for it!\u201dBaltar was an elite agent with over 20 years of experience. No matter how terrifying Han Xiao\u2019s learning capability was, he had essentially trained for only 6 months. To him, the outcome was already decided.As soon as Han Xiao neared the tuning room, he jumped inside and locked the door.Baltar burst out in maniacal laughter as he paused to reload his gun.\u201cHiding in a room? You have sealed your fate!\u201dSuddenly, the door was blasted into smithereens by what appeared to be a gigantic mecha arm that appeared out of nowhere. It followed through to smash into Baltar\u2019s chest.-95!Baltar was sent flying into the wall. 4 or 5 of his ribs were broken by the force of the impact. As he got up, he coughed a mouthful of blood and looked at the newly emerged Han Xiao in disbelief.\u201cWhat the h.e.l.l is that\u203d\u201d Baltar stared in shock at the gigantic mecha arm that was enshrouded by the black smoke it was pumping out.The three guards raised their guns to fire, but Han Xiao was a step quicker. With his right hand, he drew his enhanced 73-WASP and fired two consecutive shots.With the accuracy bonus provided from his skills and DEX, Han Xiao\u2019s current shooting abilities were extremely frightening. Each bullet hit either guard squarely in the throat.The third guard opened fire, but Han Xiao simply raised the mecha arm.Clank!The bullet deflected._____________________Lightweight Mechanical Arm (Left) has lost 8 durability.\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afHan Xiao fired another shot.The guard collapsed to his knees with an expression of disbelief.The corridor quietened down. Han Xiao and Baltar faced each other off.\u201cThe nearest guard will take another thirty seconds to arrive,\u201d calculated Han Xiao.Han Xiao flexed his mecha arm tauntingly.\u201cI really feel like crus.h.i.+ng your throat with my bare hands to thank you for all four hundred and twenty cuts.\u201dBaltor furiously spat out some blood and laughed coldly as he unsheathed a dagger that had been concealed within his boots.\u201cThat was quite a punch, but don\u2019t think that you can defeat me with a piece of junk like that!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\u201cI can kill you ten times in thirty seconds!\u201d howled Baltar as he suddenly pounced forward.Han Xiao charged forward to meet him.Sparks flew as Baltar\u2019s knife clashed with Han Xiao\u2019s mecha arm.In the moment that they pa.s.sed each other, Baltar bent down and aimed a kick at Han Xiao\u2019s knee with his foot. To trip the enemy from behind was an extremely effective tactic that Han Xiao had learnt from Hila, and, unfortunately for Baltar, Han Xiao had antic.i.p.ated the move. Seemingly with superhuman reflexes, Han Xiao swung the entire mecha arm back to smash into Baltar\u2019s foot.Baltar\u2019s foot was fractured by the blow. He crumpled to the gruond.-87!The Mechanical Arm had a power level of 38. Added onto Han Xiao\u2019s own power level, the might of blow was already at the level of an E-grade Superhuman. It had essentially doubled Han Xiao\u2019s damage.Han Xiao estimated Baltar to have a max HP of 300. Coupled with that destructive blow from earlier on, Han Xiao knew that he was probably at half health already.Baltar was indeed extremely weakened. However, he endured the pain and continued to attack. Unfortunately, his actions had grown dull, and Han Xiao easily caught his arm.\u201cImpossible\u2026 How could I\u2026 You\u2026\u201dBaltar howled indignantly as he struggled to break free from the grip of the mecha arm.Suddenly, the world before him darkened as Han Xiao wrapped the mecha arm around his head and slammed him into the wall.Splat!Baltar was no more.Han Xiao dragged the already unrecognizable Baltar against the wall.\u201cSorry, I lied. I didn\u2019t crush your throat. Why don\u2019t you get up so I can do it properly?\u201dBaltar did not reply, not that he could._____________________You have killed Baltar, Vice-commander of the Valkyrie Lab, gaining 1,500 experience!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Now, go!\u201dThe Team A leader rose up to the occasion to give the orders.There were a total of sixty guards in the base grouped into four teams. Usually, they were scattered, but this was an emergency.Unfortunately, Han Xiao was reading them like a book.Bang!A loud crash came from above, and the entire facility started to tremble.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on\u203d\u201d asked the panicked Team A leader through his intercom.The sound of gunfire intermixed with panicked yelling could be heard from the other end.\u201cTeam C has encountered the enemy in the lab. I repeat, Team C has encountered the enemy in the lab. d.a.m.n it! Zero set the lab on fire with a grenade!\u201d\u201cWhere did he get the grenade from\u203d\u201dThe Team A leader was both enraged and horrified. His team had been standing guard outside the armory, but they had seen no one the entire time.\u201cSend reinforcements quickly! Which team is nearest?\u201d\u201cTeam B is also at bas.e.m.e.nt 3. The surveillance room has been wiped. We\u2019re coming over right now!\u201d\u2026In Bas.e.m.e.nt 3, Han Xiao was hiding behind a corner near the laboratory while the fire raged within. He had used three hand grenades to set the lab on fire. Presently, there were a dozen guards from Team C that had suspected his presence and were advancing on him.After his battle with Baltar, Han Xiao had not headed for the main gate immediately. Instead, he had gone back down to bas.e.m.e.nt 3, predicting that the guards would conduct a sweep of the facility from the top.Since it was no longer possible to sneak out as he had planned, Han Xiao had to change his tactics. Here in the laboratory at bas.e.m.e.nt 3 was where all the Valkyrie data was stored, making it one of the key areas of the entire facility. He knew that setting it ablaze would cause the enemy to panic.I still have 77 bullets and 5 custom grenades.Han Xiao reevaluated his inventory before peeking out from the corner for just an instant. Bullets were fired almost instantly.Twelve guards. Three N9 submachine guns, Nine 73-WASP handguns. I\u2019m outcla.s.sed in firepower.Han Xiao\u2019s mind raced. It had been a minute since he set the laboratory on fire. Team B would arrive within three minutes, so he did not have much time left. Han Xiao knew all of this because he had been eavesdropping on a stolen intercom.Everything had happened so suddenly that the guards did not stop to consider this possibility.Han Xiao tossed out a grenade, causing the Team C guards to frantically jump for cover.Bang!Han Xiao used the smoke of the blast to sneak up onto the nearest guard. He gave him a mecha punch in the stomach, crippling him.\u201cShoot! Quickly! Shoot!\u201dThe other guards resumed shooting. Han Xiao yanked the poor guard up to use as a s.h.i.+eld, and while this did not stop them from shooting, Han Xiao was able to close the distance, and he swiftly dispatched of another three guards.The remaining Team C guards scattered further back to pull apart from him. Han Xiao rolled and ducked as he closed in on them. The mecha arm\u2019s durability plummeted as bullets rained upon it. As Han Xiao evaded, he pulled out his handgun to return fire and scored three more kills.Suddenly, Han Xiao grimaced._____________________You have been shot in your right arm by a 73-WASP! 17 damage taken!You have been inflicted with a gun wound!

He growled it off and proceeded with his onslaught.One minute later, Team C no longer existed. Han Xiao proceeded to bandage his wounds. He had lost 110 HP \u2013 more than a third of his max HP.\u201cA head-on a.s.sault is too costly. If only I had active skills\u2026\u201d\u201cTeam C, Team C, please respond. What\u2019s the situation?\u201d asked a guard over the intercom.Han Xiao pinched his throat and replied, \u201cCough, cough. Team C has suffered heavy losses. We have trapped the target inside the lab. The target has been shot. Please send reinforcements quickly!\u201dHe then picked a submachine gun on the floor and casually sprayed it to create the illusion of a fierce battle.\u201cRoger that. Please hold on. Team B is on the way!\u201dThe guard did not doubt him at all. As Han Xiao\u2019s silent act was deeply ingrained in their minds, the idea that he could employ such tactics simply did not occur to them.Han Xiao proceeded to tie his three remaining hand grenades together and hung them on the door of the laboratory. He then hid behind a desk and loaded three submachine guns before firing his handgun multiple times to create the illusion of a crossfire.Footsteps approached and the door was kicked opened.Kaboom!As soon as the guards began to scream, Han Xiao rushed forward under the cover of the smoke and stuck two SMGs out of the door to open fire onto either side. Although vision was limited, Han Xiao could hear his shots landing, and when he had emptied his clip, the guards were no longer making any sound.The standard tactic to attack a room was for one person to kick the door while the others hid on either side. As the guards in the base were not an elite squad, Han Xiao had known that they would employ this tactic. Although most of Team B had been lucky to survive the first round of grenades, they were unable to hide from the ensuing storm of bullets.His interface lit up like crazy.When the smoke cleared, Han Xiao saw that three guards remained. When they saw Han Xiao emerge from the room, their eyes grew wide with shock and fear.Is this really that dim-witted Zero\u203dHan Xiao fired three consecutive shots to finish them off.\u201cWhat was that explosion? What\u2019s going on\u203d\u201d Team A\u2019s leader shouted through the intercom.Han Xiao randomly picked up several scattered guns and fired them around casually.\u201cTeam B is under ambus.h.!.+ We are engaged with the enemy in the experiment lab. Requesting a.s.sistance! Requesting a.s.sistance!\u201d\u201cTeam A is coming right now!\u201d Something seemed off about the entire situation to him, but he could not figure out what.It was only when they reached bas.e.m.e.nt 3 did the Team A leader finally realize what was bothering him, and he hurriedly ordered, \u201cAll guards, listen up. Zero might have infiltrated our comms. From now on, only take orders from me!\u201dIt suddenly became apparent that Zero could be baiting them. After all, they hadn\u2019t heard of any other Team B member speaking since then.An unbelievable notion occurred to the Team A leader; did Zero already wipe out both Team B and Team C?The notion caused him to s.h.i.+ver.If that was what had happened, it would mean that Zero had wiped out over half of the entire base\u2019s guards alone! Although he was unwilling to believe the idea, everything pointed to the fact that it indeed what had happened!Was Zero baiting them? Or was he trying to divide them while he made a run for the main gate?\u201cTeam D, any abnormalities at the main gate?\u201d he asked through the intercom.\u201cNone yet.\u201dThe Team A leader sighed a breath of relief. He couldn\u2019t let Zero play them for a fool any longer. The situation at present was already extremely bad. He knew that hoping to kill Zero now was no longer realistic, and that he had to inform Hila ASAP.\u201cTeam A, listen up. Return to the main gate right now!\u201dHe decided it would be better to gather all the remaining people to fortify the main gate. There, they could simply wait for reinforcements. This was the plan that appeared safest and surest to him.No matter what Zero\u2019s aim was, his fate would be sealed as long as he had nowhere to run!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019m going to call for reinforcements. Guard the exit.\u201dThe Team A leader glanced at the present members.There were 31 of them. With 31 guns directed at the corridor, the second Zero appeared he would be torn to shreds.However, he suddenly realized that something was off\u2026 Hold on a second, shouldn\u2019t there only be 30 of us?Beep beep!The security panel flashed green as the gates suddenly opened.As the guards turned back to look, their jaws dropped. There was a man who was wearing the same uniform as them at the gate. The man began to whistle as he pushed his cap up with a finger to reveal his face. It was none other than Han Xiao.\u201cBye bye.\u201d He waved before abruptly pulling the manual lever and rolling out as the gate clamped down.The guards continued staring at the gate in disbelief.The veins on Team A\u2019s leader\u2019s temples bulged.\u201cWhen did Zero blend in with us\u203d\u201dOn the other side, Han Xiao rejoiced.I\u2019ve finally escaped!Han Xiao stretched as he basked in the sunlight. The sight of the clear sky seemed to evaporate all his worries. It was roughly 4 or 5 in the afternoon, and Han Xiao could discern the silhouettes of several moons in the sky. Some of them were even close enough for their craters to be observed!Han Xiao took a deep breath. The crisp air was reinvigorating.Since the start, Han Xiao had never planned on taking all the guards head-on. Even though the guards had already been weakened, it might not even matter if he were able to kill them all since they could put the entire facility in lockdown at any point!Then, his expression would not be that much different from the guards on the other side of the gate.After impersonating a Team B member to bait out Team A, Han Xiao had searched around for a relatively clean set of uniform to change into before concealing himself underneath the stairway.The guards had failed to notice him joining their ranks as they had been panicking.As such, Han Xiao was safely \u2018escorted\u2019 to the entrance where, while they let their guard down, he had crept towards the gate, and the rest is now history.It had been a huge gamble. If anything had gone awry, he would have been torn to shreds by dozens of guns. Han Xiao would rather not have had to rely on this risky plan. However, Baltar had ruined his original plan, leaving him with no choice but to do so. It was a 50/50 all-in gamble, but there was no other choice.Han Xiao found himself in the middle of an abandoned farm. He noticed the trails of several vehicles and traced them back to a garage where there were several all-terrain vehicles. Conveniently, their keys were all slotted in.Reinforcements might appear any moment. I need to leave ASAP.His escape was far from over. The Organization definitely would not let him off so easily.Han Xiao threw his backpack into the pa.s.senger seat and got into the driver\u2019s seat.He ignited the engine and stepped on the gas pedal, intending to leave immediately. He ran the vehicle over the electric fence and headed into the forest.As Han Xiao knew nothing about the geography of the area, he would have to bet it all on following one direction.\u2026On the Black Harrier helicopter, Hila noticed her phone ringing.\u201cWho?\u201d she answered, irritated.\u201cCommander Hila, there\u2019s a situation. Zero has gone rogue. He\u2019s killed Vice-commander Baltar, Professor Lin Wei Xian, and over 30 guards. He\u2019s also destroyed all the Valkyrie records in the base\u2026\u201dThe Team A leader was dispirited. They were definitely going to be punished for having been useless\u2014that went without saying. However, he still had to swallow the bitter pill and contact the commander as they were all trapped and needed someone to deactivate the lockdown.Hila frowned.\u201cAre you kidding me? I personally conducted his brainwas.h.i.+ng! How could he have survived the procedure? Has he been fooling even me?\u201d she wondered.Hila immediately contacted the boss to relay the news.\u201cTurn back right now and give chase,\u201d ordered the boss, enraged.\u201cBut my sister\u2014\u201d Hila began to argue.\u201cShut up. You have no right to bargain with me.\u201dHila glowered as she reluctantly ordered the pilot, \u201cReturn to base!\u201d\u201cCommander Hila, the helicopter needs to land to refuel first.\u201d\u201cStep on it.\u201dThe Night Owl Squad had also received the order to return.No. 1 was livid with rage at the guards\u2019 pitiful appearances.\u201cThere are sixty of you and you can\u2019t even stop one person! Are there spies here\u203d\u201dHe was unable to believe that Han Xiao could have escaped alone, not when it was impossible for himself.The guards were terrified by his accusation. No one dared to betray the organization, and for good reason. However, they were demoralized and unable to talk back. They did secretly hope that Han Xiao could escape as it would help their case.\u201cThat\u2019s enough. The boss ordered us to hunt him down,\u201d interrupted Silver Blade coldly.\u201cHold on, the test subject team will follow,\u201dNo. 1 was now rattled by Han Xiao\u2019s combat prowess, and this frustrated him. He felt like he needed to defeat Han Xiao in order to prove his worth to the organization.\u2026Night had fallen, and the night sky was decorated by numerous blue moons.Each planet in Galaxy had a different kind of landscape and environment. In Han Xiao\u2019s previous life, there existed players who specialized in galactic tourism. They would sell alb.u.ms of beautiful scenery and landscape from across the universe.Unfortunately, the thick canopy blocked out nearly all the moonlight, making it hard for Han Xiao to see, much less enjoy the night view.Han Xiao drove carefully, fearful of cras.h.i.+ng into a tree. The darkness was extremely disadvantageous for him. Not only was he unable to move quickly, the sound of his engine could also expose his location.It\u2019s really bad to drive at night. I\u2019d better walk.He stopped the car and turned off the engine, deciding to abandon it.The silence in the forest began to set in, and he noticed that the shadows around him resembled ghostly figures._____________________You have obtained Combat Biscuit x5, Mineral Water x3.\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afHan Xiao found some ration and water in the boot of the car. He stored them inside his bag and continued on foot. As he was unable to do anything about the trail that his car had left, he could only change his direction slightly to throw off any pursuers.The night was his cloak.Although Han Xiao was completely exhausted, and his stamina was almost depleted, he did not dare to stop for a break.Suddenly, Han Xiao heard the sound of engines coming from behind. He instantly sought for shelter behind a tree before peeking out to see 3 sets of flickering headlights about 300 meters away.He was about to creep towards a safer location when suddenly, a gunshot pierced the night.Han Xiao\u2019s danger sense tingled, and he threw himself onto the ground. Something grazed past his shoulder. He turned to see that the bullet had narrowly missed him to pierce a tree ten meters away.The three vehicles stopped, and 6 men alighted. They were were none other than Night Owl Squad 3. The person who had fired was Silver Blade.Six Cyclopes\u203d Han Xiao was momentarily taken aback by their appearance. Those are night vision goggles!Han Xiao cursed his luck._____________________You have been grazed by an SWP sniper rifle! 18 damage taken!\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afHoly cow.

He was essentially outmatched in terms of equipment.Bang!The sniper rifle was fired again. The bullet pierced through the tree he was hiding behind, narrowly missing him. Han Xiao groaned. While the enemy had night-vision, he could only attempt to make out their position from the muzzle flashes.The sniper rifle was too powerful. With his current health, it would probably take only 3 shots to kill him. Han Xiao decided to put the 18 una.s.signed stat points at his disposal to use. He added 14 points into END for additional health and 4 into STR to bolster his STR advantage. Engaging in a shootout would only be disadvantageous, so even though close combat was risky, he had to take the chance. It was virtually impossible to run away since the enemy had night vision. The only way to make it out now was to kill them all!With the +10 bonus from the Mechanical Arm on top of his 29 STR, Han Xiao had enough STR to ensure that his blows would proc \u2018overwhelming blows\u2019. With 36 points in END, he now had a max HP of 460. He had instantly gained 140 HP from adding END, which was crucial as Han Xiao was already low on health. His current HP was now close to 400, which was much more optimistic than before.The agents were fanning out to surround him, and Han Xiao noticed that they were not very closely coordinated.He estimated that it would take around 5 to 8 seconds for them to reach each other to help.In other words, Han Xiao had to be sure to finish off his target in this short amount of time.Having killed over 30 guards in the Valkyrie base, Han Xiao was now sitting on 116,000 experience points.He dumped all of it into his combat skills._____________________[Grappling] has been raised to Lv. 5+7% Counter, +10% Damage (bare-handed)[Basic Combat] has been raised to Lv. 8+8% Damage (bare-handed)As [Basic Combat] has reached Lv. 8 and [Submission] has reached Lv. 3, you may learn one of these three advanced skills:[Special Ops Combat][Jiu-jitsu][Iron Fist]\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afSpecial Ops focused on explosiveness, a.s.sa.s.sination, and usage of tools; Jiu-jitsu focused on grappling and submission; Iron Fist focused on strengthening the limbs and improving one\u2019s tolerance to taking damage.

Not only did he feel much stronger than before, he had a mysterious feeling that he had somehow acquired mastery over several fighting styles.It\u2019s a pity that I still don\u2019t have any active energy-based combat skills, thought Han Xiao. As Mechanics had very few active skills in their earlier levels, they couldn\u2019t make much use of their Energy.Han Xiao put on the Lightweight Mecha Arm and crouched down. He took a few moments to regulate his breathing and optimize his oxygen flow before suddenly springing forward and charging towards the agent closest to him on the flank. As soon as Han Xiao showed himself, the 6 agents opened fire.With the mecha arm as his s.h.i.+eld, Han Xiao weaved through the trees to evade the rain of metal while returning fire with the SMG in his other hand. The smell of gunpowder was overbearing.In 3 seconds, Han Xiao came within range of his target. He threw the SMG at the agent\u2019s gun hand as a distraction before swinging the mighty mecha arm at him. The agent raised his arms in reflex to block the blow and endured the pain to draw his handgun. He aimed at Han Xiao\u2019s head and fired, but Han Xiao\u2019s DEX was not just for show. With seemingly inhuman reflexes, Han Xiao clipped his arm over the agent\u2019s gun hand and tugged down to make him lose balance and buckle forward before proceeding to ruthlessly smash his knee up into his groin._____________________You have dealt a fatal blow! 2x Critical Hit!

Han Xiao took advantage of his temporary immobility to knee him again and again.Thud! Thud! Thud!-78! -81! -84!Sorry brother, I know it must hurt a lot, but I\u2019m not the one who decided not to include groin protection in your armour!The agent\u2019s HP plummeted and Han Xiao finished him off by ripping into his throat with the Mechanical Arm. Before Han Xiao could celebrate his first kill, he felt a sharp pain in his back. He hurriedly dropped to the ground and dragged the agent\u2019s body over him as a s.h.i.+eld while he crawled towards a tree for cover._____________________You have been shot by an SWP Sniper Rifle! 68 Damage taken!You have been shot by a high caliber bullet!

Just a single shot had taken out one whole chunk of his health bar. Unfortunately, he could not afford the time to bandage the wound.\u201cd.a.m.n it!\u201d The remaining five Night Owl agents were enraged that Han Xiao had killed their comrade. They rapidly closed in as they fired, cornering Han Xiao.Han Xiao quickly searched through the agent\u2019s body and put on his Kevlar Vest. It would do well to block one or two shots. More importantly, however, he found three G-fragment grenades, one of which he immediately tossed out.Kaboom!The agents had to stop shooting as they frantically ducked for cover.\u201cShoot more, a.s.sholes!\u201d yelled Han Xiao furiously as he threw out a second grenade, causing the five agents to scramble back to the ground just as they were about to get up.After the blast, a third black object was flung out in the air, and the five agents subconsciously crouched down once more. However, when there was no explosion after two seconds had pa.s.sed, they looked up to see that it was just a piece of rock.Meanwhile, Han Xiao was already charging towards the next agent while firing his a.s.sault rifle wildly. Although Han Xiao managed to kill the agent who was seeking cover in the gra.s.s, he was now out of ammo.Han Xiao tossed the rifle away and threw the third grenade, buying himself some time to get in range. As he rammed into the third agent, knocking him down, a shot from Silver Blade\u2019s a.s.sault rifle clipped him in the calf.Han Xiao grimaced. The calf injury affected his movement speed, so Han Xiao decided to jump into the agent he had knocked down, causing them to tumble together out of the other agents\u2019 line of sight where he made short work of him behind a tree. The agents simply stood no chance against him at close combat.But there were still three agents left! Although the odds were against him and he had lost half of his HP, Han Xiao remained calm and spent some time to plan his next move.\u201cThe enemy will probably\u2026\u201dMeanwhile, Silver Blade was in complete disbelief.

He was heavily injured, bleeding, and almost out of stamina. Fatigue was setting in, and it was taking him all the willpower and focus that he could muster just to keep his eyes open.He had managed to survive the previous blast with 50 HP left by using the agent\u2019s corpse as a meat s.h.i.+eld, after which he had dressed the corpse in his clothes and planted the grenades. Only Silver Blade had been vigilant enough to escape his trap.Han Xiao limbs were shaking uncontrollably, and he couldn\u2019t even see properly due to the blood blurring his vision.Suddenly, a black figure darted towards him.\u201cYou asked for it!\u201d howled an enraged Silver Blade as he thrust a knife forward.\u2026The searchlight from a Black Harrier helicopter was illuminating the forest. Hila jumped down from the aircraft into what seemed like the aftermath of a fierce battle.The test subject squad had already arrived and were collecting blood samples. No. 1 was standing silently with clenched fists.The sight of the six agents\u2019 bodies stunned Hila for a few moments.As unbelievable as it seemed, Zero had eliminated Night Owl Squad 3 and escaped!She crouched down to examine the bodies, and was able to deduce that one had died by gunshot, two by explosion, and three in melee combat.Silver Blade\u2019s entire lower body had been pulverized, and there were shards of gla.s.s from his night vision goggles embedded in his eyes. He had clearly been done in by someone much more powerful than him!How could Zero have become so strong all of a sudden? Even if he had been hiding his true capabilities the entire time, Zero had only been training for at most half a year! It was simply inconceivable that he could take on the Night Owl Squad that comprised of veteran elite agents.\u201cCould he have awoken superpowers like I did?\u201dHila regretted not having kept a closer eye on Han Xiao. Perhaps, she thought, she could have prevented all of this.Also, Zero had chosen to escape on the same day that she had happened to be away. Was it luck, or had he planned it all?\u201cTheir equipment is missing, but we managed to find this,\u201d reported one of the agents as he showed the mecha arm to Hila.The mecha arm was drenched in blood, and there was a knife sticking out of its engine.\u201cBring it back.\u201d\u2026One day later, a large number of Germinal personnel arrived at the Valkyrie base to salvage any remaining surveillance footage and gather clues. The boss himself also came.The boss of the Germinal Organization wore a black coat, black mask, black gloves\u2026 well, he was essentially covered in black from head to toe, and looked like he had come right out of \u2018Detective Conan\u2019. Only five people in the entire organization had ever seen his face.\u201cWhere is Zero?\u201d he asked plainly.\u201cWe failed to track him,\u201d answered No. 1 through clenched teeth. \u201cIf I have more time\u2026\u201dThe boss abruptly raised a hand in dismissal. No. 1 immediately stopped blabbering.The boss was in an extremely bad mood. Just a few days ago, he had dismissed Zero as a piece of trash, and this \u2018piece of trash\u2019 had managed to escape while taking out so many of his men.\u201cThirty armed guards killed, all the research destroyed, and one elite squad wiped. On top of that, he killed Lin Wei Xian and escaped? Are you kidding me\u203d\u201d he yelled at his men.\u201cI want to know when he turned and how he got so strong.\u201dA researcher hastily replied, \u201cWe have come up with a theory after going through his records.\u201d\u201cGo on.\u201d\u201cZero\u2019s behavior and actions before and after the experiment are strikingly different. According to the original reports from his capture, Zero\u2019s original ident.i.ty was Xiao Han, the third son of the Alumera family\u2019s second-in-charge.\u201dThis was shocking news even to the boss himself. The Alumera family were a powerful warring clan allied with the country of Theus.Test subjects captured for experimentation were usually criminals or stragglers. How did someone with such background end up in their hands?\u201cThe son of the Alumera\u2019s second-in-charge? How?\u201d\u201cAccording to our investigations, Xiao Han was the most ungifted among his siblings. Not only was he unable to awaken any energy, he was extremely incapable at leaders.h.i.+p and weak-minded,\u201d answered the researcher as he flipped through his report. \u201cOur agents stumbled across him in the wreckage of a battle. He had been following his elder brother, Xiao Hai, on a transport mission when they were ambushed by an enemy.\u201d\u201cContinue.\u201d\u201cAt the time, Xiao Hai was in command of the team, and the a.s.sailants\u2019 true aim was not the goods that they were transporting, but he himself. He was the most promising of his siblings, and was more or less guaranteed to succeed his father\u2019s position. According to our intel, the ambush was an inside job. Someone within the family wanted to get rid of him.\u201d\u201cDuring the ambush, Xiao Hai forced Xiao Han to swap clothes with him and he used him as bait. In the end, while Xiao Han was. .h.i.t by a cannon, Xiao Hai managed to escape to safety.\u201d\u201cSince when was our network that well-informed?\u201d frowned the boss.\u201cErm\u2026 Xiao Hai did not bother to hide the truth, including the fact that he used Xiao Han as bait.\u201d\u201cThe circ.u.mstances of Xiao Han\u2019s death did not hurt Xiao Hai\u2019s standing in the family. At the time, the second-in-charge even said that Xiao Hai had done well. As you know, the Alumera family values power above all. A burden like Xiao Han meant nothing to them. Even his siblings did not mourn his death.\u201dHan Xiao\u2019s past existence was like a roadside flower that everyone trampled over without notice.The boss laughed coldly.\u201cThe weak do indeed deserve no sympathy. Enough of his past. Tell me what happened during the 6 months.\u201d\u201cWe think that the Valkyrie experiment triggered a change within his body\u2014a change greater than we could have imagined. It did not just unlock his talent for machinery; what it did was enhance his intelligence. We think that he has been planning his escape from the very start!\u201d\u201cAre you saying that the brainwash did not work on him?\u201d interrupted Hila.\u201cYes, I\u2019m afraid so.\u201dHila frowned.The researcher continued, \u201cHow is it possible for a subject with no memories to develop his own will? The only explanation seems to be that Valkyrie helped him to regain his memories. However, since he was never a gifted person to begin with, Valykrie must have also awakened some kind of hidden strength within him.\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d asked the leader coldly.\u201cNot absolutely\u2026\u201d admitted the researcher. It was simply conjecture after all. Who the h.e.l.l could be sure.No. 1 couldn\u2019t help but b.u.t.t in. \u201cWas he just luck\u2014\u201dThe boss instantly silenced him with a stare.\u201cOh right. The guards also brought back this mecha arm that he used,\u201d added the researcher. \u201cAlthough the craftsmans.h.i.+p of the arm itself is not very refined, I must say that it is quite a revolutionary concept. It seems like this mecha arm played a huge part in his escape. The weapons development department would like to replicate this model for development.\u201dFinally, thought the boss, something good to hear.\u201cFunds are not an issue. I just want results.\u201dThe researcher nodded, continuing. \u201cNo matter what, Zero\u2019s cunning and talents make him a dangerous person. He has high research value. Whether dead or alive, obtaining his body will undoubtedly help us in perfecting Valkyrie.\u201dWhile the researchers were all terrified of Han Xiao as he could have killed them anytime he wanted, they were, after all, men of science.No. 1 frowned.From the moment that he was created, he knew that he had a predecessor. This fact alone caused him to identify Han Xiao as an enemy. However, just when he thought that he had surpa.s.sed Han Xiao, reality hit him like a truck.\u201cBefore determining the exact factor behind the drug\u2019s effects, cease all experimentation. Round up all the test subjects once more for another round of brainwas.h.i.+ng. I don\u2019t want another Zero to appear,\u201d ordered the boss.No. 1\u2019s eyes widened in disbelief. He felt that his loyalty to the organization was being doubted.\u201cI wish to lead a team to pursue Zero!\u201d he burst out.The boss looked at No. 1 as he contemplated. He did indeed have high expectations for the test subject squad.\u201cCan you do it?\u201d\u201cI will definitely succeed!\u201d declared No. 1.\u201cFine. Bring Zero back\u2014dead or alive!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His backpack was bulging but only with equipment.Seven days ago, he had defeated Silver Blade with relative ease by sacrificing the mecha arm.Losing it was not that big of a deal though, as Han Xiao still had the blueprints and could always craft another.Although the forest was not an ideal place for recovery, Han Xiao\u2019s high END gave him resistance to wound infection. Still, he did have to withstand the pain of digging out the bullets inside him. The pain from extracting the sniper bullet lodged in his shoulder blade, in particular, had been so excruciating that it had immobilized Han Xiao for almost an hour.At the very least, he was lucky to have not encountered any wild beasts, although he did catch a few hares. The wild beasts on Planet Aquamarine were extremely ferocious, and some of them were even intelligent. In Galaxy, they occasionally attacked human cities. Some beasts, like the amphibious orca elephant, were so ma.s.sive that conventional weaponry was completely ineffective against them.Although Han Xiao knew the geography of Planet Aquamarine well, it wasn\u2019t really of much use to him when he did not know where exactly he was. Han Xiao would sleep on top of trees at night, and if the past seven nights had taught him anything, it was that mosquitoes were the most detestable creatures in the world.Will I ever get out of this forest?As if in answer to his prayers, a wanderers\u2019 encampment soon appeared in Han Xiao\u2019s sights.Suddenly, Han Xiao\u2019s expression changed and he jumped backwards abruptly. In the same instant that he had reacted, a huge net sprung up from beneath the sand. It was embedded with shards of metal.\u201cThe b.a.s.t.a.r.d dodged!\u201dA long-haired young man carrying a shotgun walked out from behind a tree. His clothes were ragged and patched with animal skin.\u201cStand still!\u201d he shouted.The young man was most likely one of the residents from the encampment, and Han Xiao, not wis.h.i.+ng to create unnecessary trouble, held his hands up above his head.\u201cI\u2019m just a pa.s.serby.\u201d\u201cA pa.s.serby?\u201dHan Xiao\u2019s bulging backpack caught the young man\u2019s eye.\u201cWhat\u2019s in the bag? Take everything out! \u201dHan Xiao sighed. No wonder the trap was so big; it was precisely meant to catch people. Morals are always blurred in times of trouble. Most wanderers were surviving citizens of the old countries who opted not to join the Six Nations. As life in the wild was harsh, killing and stealing might have been frowned upon, but they were inevitable occurrences.\u201cAre you deaf? I said, take everything out!\u201d yelled the long-haired young man as he walked forward to hit Han Xiao on the forehead with the b.u.t.t of his shotgun.Han Xiao was exasperated. The only contents in his backpack were guns, ammo, and equipment that belonged to the Germinal Organisation. How was he going to explain that?\u201cDo you not understand me? Want me to screw you up\u203d\u201dThe long-haired young man c.o.c.ked the shotgun threateningly.Suddenly, Han Xiao threw an elbow into the chest of the unsuspecting young man, sending him flying back in shock. Han Xiao grabbed the shotgun from him out of mid-air.The young man landed heavily on the ground, and he clutched his chest in terror as he scrambled to crawl away.Han Xiao cut out some rope from the trap and tied the whimpering young man to a tree.When he examined the shotgun, he realized that its barrel was outright crooked and shook his head. At the very least, it implied that the young man had never killed before and that he had only been acting.Nonetheless, the young man was so terrified that when he saw it in Han Xiao\u2019s hand, he panicked even more.\u201cBig brother, please spare me! Forgive me for not recognizing Mt. Tai.\u201dHan Xiao slapped him squarely on the face, reprimanding, \u201cSo, you know that you were wrong\u203d\u201d\u201cI was wrong. I was wrong,\u201d blurted the young man shamelessly.\u201cWhy?\u201dThe young man thought for a moment before carefully answering, \u201cI\u2026 should have brought one more gun?\u201dHan Xiao burst into laughter.\u201cYou\u2019re a funny one, eh?\u201d\u201cPlease show me mercy, Mr. Saint. Just let me go as if you\u2019re pa.s.sing wind,\u201d sobbed the young man with dripping tears.\u201cGet lost! I\u2019ve never pa.s.sed such a big wind before.\u201dHan Xiao raised the shotgun and struck the young man across his face to knock him out cold. At the end of the day, the young man was most likely a resident of the encampment, and Han Xiao still needed to obtain food and water from them.\u201cCount yourself lucky.\u201dHalf an hour later, Han Xiao finally reached the encampment. His appearance seemed to unsettle the wanderers.Life in the wild was full of perils, and wanderers were often unwelcoming to outsiders. Their way of life was similar to that of the gypsies, and they were frequently on the go. There were pick-up trucks lined up outside the tent. Most of them were rusty and some didn\u2019t even have exteriors.Han Xiao noticed that there were only a few dozen tents, making this community a relatively small one. Nevertheless, it was a miniature society in its own, and Han Xiao located the camp\u2019s merchant: a bearded westerner who conducted his business by his pick-up truck.\u201cOutsider?\u201d The bearded man raised an eyebrow.\u201cDo you know the rules?\u201d he asked.\u201cWhat rules?\u201d\u201cBarter trading only.\u201dWell, that\u2019s just fine , thought Han Xiao, since I don\u2019t have a single penny.\u201cI want a map, three buckets of water, and five kilos of food. Bread or dried meat will do.\u201d said Han Xiao as he retrieved a handful of bullets from his bag and put them on the truck.\u201cI\u2019ll pay with this.\u201d\u201cGunpowder?\u201dThe bearded merchant\u2019s eyes flashed with greed.Gunpowder was extremely valuable among wanderers as hunting was a key source of food.\u201c150 bullets,\u201d stated the bearded merchant.Han Xiao\u2019s face darkened.Daylight robbery!The items he had asked for were basic necessities. There was no way that they could be worth so much.Han Xiao\u2019s bronze bullets were high-quality bullets that could easily go for $10 apiece, yet the merchant was asking for 150 of them, equivalent to $1,500!\u201cUp to you,\u201d added the merchant nonchalantly as he turned his attention to his fingernails.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Such scary eyes. Do you want to kill me or something? Quickly, people, come and see! This man wants to kill me!\u201dDozens of wanderers gathered around in an instant. Some of them even came with sticks and bats.\u201cThis is our territory. Are you trying to be funny kid?\u201d\u201cOkay, okay. 180 bullets. f.u.c.k me.\u201dHan Xiao hastily threw out more bullets in case he jacked the price up further.The merchant laughed shrewdly and sent someone to fetch the goods.After confirming the items, Han Xiao raised a middle finger at the merchant before turning around.Suddenly, the merchant spoke.\u201cHey, are you planning to walk out of the forest?\u201d\u201cWhy, you have a problem with that?\u201d\u201cI have an old pickup. Want it?\u201d asked the bearded merchant nicely.\u201cNot as though I can afford your price.\u201d Han Xiao shot back.\u201cOh, I think you can,\u201d said the merchant as he pointed towards Han Xiao\u2019s bag. \u201cYou have so many bullets. You must have many guns too.\u201dHan Xiao\u2019s bag was indeed full of guns\u2014high quality ones at that. He had looted from the Night Owl Squad. He even had the sniper rifle and some Kevlar vests. He could easily afford an old pickup.However, Han Xiao shook his head.A car would leave a trail. Han Xiao would rather not try racing a helicopter. Walking was safer.Furthermore, if the Germinal Organization\u2019s agents discovered their guns here, it would be disastrous not only for Han Xiao, but for the wanderers here as well. In some sense, it would be dishonest of him to sell them.Although Han Xiao had recently killed a big number of people, it was not out of perverseness. It was to survive.The merchant, however, was not an easily dissuaded person.He was about to speak again when, suddenly, a man\u2019s voice boomed out. \u201cKai Luo! You\u2019re taking advantage of outsiders again!\u201dA well-built man clad in hunter\u2019s clothes patched with animal skins appeared behind the crowd. As he strode forward to the centre of the crowd, everyone s.h.i.+fted to make way for him. The man seemed to command respect.The big bearded merchant groaned.\u201cHu Xuan Jun, I just painstakingly closed a deal. Don\u2019t come and interfere!\u201dHu Xuan Jun grabbed the bullets on the truck up and pushed them back into Han Xiao.\u201cThe stuff you want isn\u2019t actually worth much. Treat it as a gift. Here, take these back.\u201dHan Xiao was stunned by the man\u2019s chivalry and stared at him in disbelief. The man was an extremely muscular Mongolian with white hair on the sides of his head, and his eyes were as sharp as an eagle. He looked very much the part of a righteous man, and Han Xiao instantly warmed up to him.\u201cHey, what about me?\u201d interrupted Kai Luo.\u201cIsn\u2019t it just some food? I\u2019ll give you more tomorrow,\u201d replied Hu Xuan Jun casually.Kai Luo was frustrated. It wasn\u2019t every day that a foreigner came by for him to make a quick buck.\u201cHe who comes from afar is a guest. You look too frail to be travelling alone. Why not recuperate over at my house?\u201dHan Xiao hesitated. He did indeed need a proper place to recuperate. In any case, Hu Xuan Jun had given him a very good first impression, so he nodded.As Han Xiao followed Hu Xuan Jun, the crowd scattered. Kai Luo fumed, but there was nothing that he could do. He did not dare to offend Hu Xuan Jun.Hu Xuan Jun led Han Xiao to his tent. As he entered the tent, he shouted, \u201cAn, we have a guest today. Cook more.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d replied a woman\u2019s voice..Han Xiao followed behind Hu Xuan Jun into the tent. An was a woman who looked rather ordinary and wore a simple waist skirt. Han Xiao noticed that she was blind.\u201cThis is my wife,\u201d introduced Hu Xuan Jun with a smile.\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d greeted An as she faced the entrance. She then turned back to pick up crockery, dried meat, and wild vegetables and arranged them inside a simple clay oven in the center of the tent.Han Xiao and Hu Xuan Jun sat down and chatted away.After a while, Han Xiao became certain that Hu Xuan Jun did not have any ulterior motives; he was simply an extremely nice person.\u201cI noticed earlier that most of the people in your community are white. How did you end up with them?\u201d asked Han Xiao.There were four races of humans on Aquamarine: black, white, yellow, and shanu.\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any special reason for it. It just happened to be a chaotic time. I met some travelers by chance and decided to stay with them as An was sick at the time. Although we come from different countries and are of different races, we are all remnants of the old era, and have all experienced the loss of our countries. There isn\u2019t a need for distinction. We are all human after all.\u201dSome of those who had lost their countries chose to join the Six Nations. Others opted to join the Germinal Organization. The rest could only become wanderers. Wanderers made up a third of the planet\u2019s population.Aquamarine used to have over a hundred nations, but that all changed when an advanced civilization came into contact with the planet. The idea of advancing humanity and stepping out into s.p.a.ce sparked a movement for sustainability, and the idea of unifying countries gained some popularity. While it was indeed far-fetched to think that that alone could change the face of the entire planet, there were people in power who supported the idea and conspired behind the scenes to make it happen. Long story short, after numerous wars, negotiations, and all kinds of peaceful and non-peaceful efforts, all the countries were united into the Six Nations in the span of a few decades.Many things that people had once thought to be irreplaceable were simply shove aside by the unstoppable tides of change, and many lives were sacrificed in the process.Such is civilization. People are like the sediments in the river, destined to go with the flow.While maintaining the status quo is always easy, revolution always comes with pain and suffering. When comparing individual gain to societal improvement, it is natural for people to favor the former. Truly selfless people are rare creatures, otherwise selflessness would not be seen as a virtue. Statements such as 'see, there are still good people in the world\u201d are sad to hear.Nevertheless, change had come too soon to Aquamarine.\u201cThe Battle of Andrea was the nail in the coffin. Sometimes, I think about the way we took our lives for granted. I miss how life was peaceful back then. Who would have thought that change could come so suddenly? I mean, even if the planet\u2019s resources do end up being depleted, wouldn\u2019t that be in a few hundred years from now? Why do we have to answer for something like that?\u201d lamented Hu Xuan Jun.Han Xiao sighed empathetically.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Societal strife was destined to reach a boiling point. Maybe short-term pain is better than long-term suffering.\u201d Han Xiao shrugged.The Battle of Andrea set the post-unification landscape of the planet in stone.Andrea was the name of a continent, once home to several nations. As the war developed, Andrea had, for some reason, became the proxy of the conflict. It was as though all the countries had agreed to settle things there once and for all, as though they were trying to contain the scale of damage inflicted onto the planet. However, billions of lives were lost as a result.By the time the war ended, all that remained of Andrea was a desolate land of scorched earth and withered trees. Its rivers were left blighted, and the once fertile, lush landscape was no more. The Six Nations simply packed up and left as soon as the battle ended, ignoring the destruction that they had caused.Han Xiao noticed an old blister on Hu Xuan Jun\u2019s palm.\u201cYou used to be a soldier?\u201d he asked.\u201cYes, for over ten years.\u201d\u201cI thought that remnants like yourself would choose to join the Germinal Organization.\u201dHu Xuan Jun shook his head.\u201cMy home country was peacefully annexed by Stardragon. Soldiers like me didn\u2019t have any say. We simply follow the decision that our leaders made. I do detest the Six Nations, but the Germinal Organization is no better. They popped out of nowhere to take advantage of our hatred for the Six Nations. Sigh\u2026 I\u2019m a simple man. All I want is to escape war.\u201d\u201cWar is cruel. My eyes were blinded by a flash grenade. My husband and I fled tirelessly before settling here. Even though life as a wanderer is not easy, it is better than war,\u201d An chimed in.As she finished speaking, the smell of meat filled up the tent, causing Han Xiao\u2019s mouth to water.\u201cHow do you cook without being able to see?\u201d he asked.An puffed her cheeks.\u201cDon\u2019t look down on me! I might be blind, but I can still smell, hear, and feel! It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t have any limbs.\u201dHu Xuan Jun smiled.\u201cShe has a strong character. Won\u2019t even let me take care of her.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to be your baggage,\u201d responded An meekly, prompting Hu Xuan Jun to scratch his head in embarra.s.sment. He hurriedly changed the subject.\u201cOh right, I\u2019ll let you take a look at my baby.\u201dHu Xuan Jun opened a storage box beside him to retrieve an old-fas.h.i.+oned gun.\u201cLet\u2019s see if you know your guns,\u201d he said proudly._____________________Bayonet Musket (Old Era)Grade: AverageBase Stats:Damage: 38-40Fire Rate: 0.9/sMagazine Capacity: 20Range: 200m RangePower Output: 25Durability: 5/300Stat Bonus: +1 DexterityLength: 0.77mWeight: 7.1kgAdditional Effects: AccurateRemarks: This weapon has accompanied its master through countless battles._____________________\u201cIt is a fine gun,\u201d praised Han Xiao. \u201cEven though it has been used for so long, you still keep it well polished. The barrel is perfect. Truly a well-made gun.\u201d\u201cThis gun is my partner. He\u2019s been with me for close to ten years,\u201d laughed Hu Xuan Jun. \u201cIt only looks new because I frequently oil it. The truth is that its workings have aged. It can\u2019t be used anymore.\u201dThe pair continued to chat until the sky darkened and An had finished cooking.An had cooked a gigantic pot of creamy soup filled with tender meat and wild vegetables. Not only was it extremely fragrant and flavorful, it was also visually appetizing, and Han Xiao couldn\u2019t help but drool.Han Xiao gulped at the sight of the meat. He had had nothing good to eat for the past seven days! His closeness with Hu Jun Xuan was skyrocketing on the spot. +1! +1! +1!After dinner, Hu Xuan Jun asked Han Xiao to stay for the night.Han Xiao decided to stay since he did not intend to travel at night anyway. They laid a mattress for him and set up a part.i.tion.\u201cYour bag is too big. I\u2019ll put it outside,\u201d said An.\u201cI\u2019ll do it myself.\u201dBefore bringing his bag out, Han Xiao dismantled all the guns in his backpack to take out their triggers. He wrapped them in some animal skin that he got from Hu Jun Xuan and set the package in a corner.Han Xiao also loaded up his 73-WASP and placed it under his pillow. Of course, he was not being weary of his warm hosts or anything like that. It was simply important always to be prepared and alert.As soon as Han Xiao\u2019s head hit the pillow, he instantly fell asleep.His snoring could be heard through the curtain. Hu Xuan Jun laughed as he shook his head.\u201cLooks like he\u2019s beat. Let\u2019s not disturb him.\u201dAn nodded and proceeded to take the cutlery outside to wash.\u201cUncle, uncle! I\u2019m famished!\u201dSuddenly, a disheveled young man entered the tent. His entire face was covered in mud, and there was a swollen b.u.mp on his head. It was none other than the young man that Han Xiao had encountered this afternoon.He was Hu Xuan Jun\u2019s nephew, Hu Fei.\u201cWhere have you been all day? I didn\u2019t see you at all,\u201d questioned Hu Xuan Jun.\u201cI\u2014 I went out hunting,\u201d stammered Hu Fei.Hu Xuan Jun could tell that his nephew was lying. He pulled Hu Fei\u2019s ear and began to scold him in a strict but soft voice, \u201cAre you up to your pranks again\u203d I told you that I would f.u.c.king chop them off if you took that broken shotgun to scare people again, didn\u2019t I?\u201dTears began to flow out of Hu Fei\u2019s eyes as he filled up with indignance and pain. \u201cYour nephew not only got bullied today, he was even tied to a tree for the entire day! I\u2019m so tired and hungry, uncle, give me a break,\u201d he thought.\u201cPlease, uncle, don\u2019t chop them off,\u201d he bawled.\u201cWhich leg do you want me to chop?\u201d\u201cJ-just don\u2019t chop off my b.a.l.l.s\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou and your dirty mind! Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll chop them off for you since that\u2019s what you want!\u201dHu Xuan Jun was about to raise a hand to slap Hu Fei when he remembered that Han Xiao was sleeping. He let Hu Fei off with a warning.Noticing that there was someone else in the tent, Hu Fei peered beyond the part.i.tion to see who it was. When he saw Han Xiao, his jaw dropped.\u2018Isn\u2019t that the devil from this afternoon\u203d\u2019\u201cWhat are you looking at? Tonight, you sleep outside,\u201d Hu Xuan Jun suddenly whispered from his side.Hu Fei gave a start and fell backwards. He quickly scrambled out of the tent on all fours, leaving Hu Xuan Jun bewildered.\u2018Is my face that hideous?\u2019\u2026\u201cWhy am I running away from my own home? This is the perfect chance to get my revenge!\u201d realized Hu Fei as he stopped in his tracks.He proceeded to turn back to return to the tent, instantly changed his mind at the thought of Han Xiao\u2019s scary face.\u201cHu Fei, ah, Hu Fei, show some guts!\u201dAs he began to formulate a plan he recalled that there was a package in the tent that he had never seen before.\u201cIt must be his!\u201d\u2026Hu Fei waited until midnight, when everyone had gone to bed. He tiptoed into his own house and picked up the package.\u201cHehe. What do we have here?\u201dWhen Hu Fei unfolded the package, his eyes widened in disbelief.Guns!High quality guns!\u201cI can\u2019t take them all\u2026\u201dHu Fei picked out two 73-WASPs.\u201cForget it. Since my uncle is playing host to you, I\u2019ll only take two as compensation!\u201dHe wrapped the remaining guns up and returned the package to its original position.\u201cIt\u2019s only two guns. He probably won\u2019t notice.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Unfortunately, I need to leave now. I will repay you in the future.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve made some pancakes; you can eat them while traveling,\u201d said An as she handed a small package over to Han Xiao.The warmth from the pancakes flowed into Han Xiao\u2019s hands, resonating with his heart.\u201cI slept well last night. Thank you for everything.\u201d\u201cHa ha. Don\u2019t mention it. Just helping a brother in need,\u201d replied Hu Xuan Jun sincerely.Han Xiao went to gather his belongings. When he went to fetch the bundle of guns, he noticed that the leaf he had placed on it the night before had fallen off.\u201cSomeone has touched my stuff.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not possible!\u201d Hu Xuan Jun was alarmed. \u201cAn and I didn\u2019t\u2014hold on! Hu Fei! Get your a.s.s over here right now!\u201dHu Fei, who had been eavesdropping from behind the tent, walked out.\u201cYou again?\u201dHu Fei averted his eyes to the ground.Hu Xuan Jun kicked his nephew in the b.u.t.t.\u201cDid you steal again? Hand it back right now!\u201dHu Fei bit his lips and grudgingly took out a 73-WASP handgun from his clothes.\u201cBrother Han, do as you deem fit! This kid deserves a beating.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Everything is fine as long as I get the gun back. My guns will bring you misfortune,\u201d Han Xiao sighed a breath of relief.\u201cMay we be fated to meet again. Farewell,\u201d bid Han Xiao.\u201cTake care,\u201d nodded Hu Xuan Jun.Han Xiao picked up his backpack and departed.\u201cI will never forget this kindness,\u201d he thought to himself.\u201cb.a.s.t.a.r.d\u2019s finally gone,\u201d rejoiced Hu Fei. \u201cHehe, he didn\u2019t realize that I stole two guns.\u201dHe slipped to the back of the tent where he had hidden the other handgun in a box.\u201cEven if he comes back, I just have to deny that I have it.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 why does this gun have no trigger?\u201d\u2026The map that Han Xiao had obtained had been crudely drawn. However, Han Xiao was able to learn his current position from it and that sufficed.He was currently in the country of Stardragon, and by his estimations, it would take him just three more days to reach the main road. There, he could hitch a ride to the city.In the afternoon, Han Xiao found a spot to eat and replenish his stamina.As he unpacked his guns to return them to his backpack, he suddenly discovered that something was amiss.There seems to be a missing gun.Han Xiao recounted to confirm his suspicions. He immediately dispelled any thoughts of lunch and hastily packed up to retrieve it.\u2026No. 1 and his men arrived at the encampment right after Han Xiao had left. They rounded up the wanderers and were holding them at gunpoint.\u201cHas anyone seen this man?\u201dNo. 1 projected a holographic face in mid-air using a device on his wrist.It was none other than Han Xiao.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cNever seen him before.\u201dEveryone denied seeing him.They knew that the Germinal Organization would not dare to do anything to them.Wanderers were a neutral faction, and both the Six Nations and the Germinal Organization were always trying to win their support.Only one wanderer was trembling uncontrollably for some reason.No. 1 was in a foul mood, having been in pursuit of Han Xiao for 7 days before arriving at this encampment. If the people here had not seen Han Xiao, it meant that he had gone in the completely wrong direction.\u201cWithdraw!\u201d ordered No. 1. However, just as he was about to board the car, he noticed the shaking Hu Fei.\u201cBring that kid here!\u201dHu Fei was dragged to No. 1.No. 1 squinted at him and asked, \u201cDo you know this person?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d Hu Fei shook his head repeatedly.No. 1 noticed an out-of-place outline in his clothes and ordered, \u201cSearch his body!\u201dHu Fei was pressed to the ground and watched in horror as the 73-WASP was taken from him.\u201cThis is one of our guns!\u201d exclaimed No. 1. He held the gun up to the crowd and shouted, \u201cZero has obviously been here. How dare you all try and lie! Do you want to die\u203d\u201d\u201cSpeak! Where has he gone!\u201dThe terrified wanderers began to turn their eyes to the person who had first spoken to Han Xiao, Kai Luo.Kai Luo was squatting in the corner like an ostrich.\u201cWhat are you guys looking at me for? All I did was sell him some stuff. Ask Hu Xuan Jun! He definitely knows!\u201dHu Xuan Jun stood up slowly in the crowd.\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he declared.Kai Luo, wanting to cast away the suspicion on him, retorted, \u201cHow can you not know? You let him spend the night at your house!\u201dNo. 1\u2019s face darkened.The other wanderers began to urge Hu Xuan Jun to say the truth.\u201cHurry up and say what you know!\u201d\u201cDo you want us to die because of some outsider?\u201dHu Xuan Jun cursed Kai Luo under his breath before taking a deep breath to compose himself.\u201cThat person went in that direction,\u201d he said, pointing to the opposite of where Han Xiao had headed.\u201cYou\u2019re very good, you.\u201dBang!A hole appeared in Hu Xuan Jun\u2019s forehead. He fell back and landed on the ground with a loud thud.Hu Fei shrieked at the sight of his lifeless body.Just\u2026 just like that\u203dNo. 1 stared at the Hu Xuan Jun\u2019s dead body. He would not hesitate to kill anyone who helped Han Xiao.\u201cOld Hu?\u201d An couldn\u2019t see, but she could hear exactly what had transpired. She stood up from the crowd and attempted to locate her husband.Bang!Her head exploded.An\u2019s body crumpled to the ground, landing an arm\u2019s length away from her husband.No. 1 sneered.\u201cAsked for it.\u201dHu Fei was torn with regret.His one moment of greed had caused all of this.All the wanderers were stunned, unable to comprehend what had just happened.Suddenly, No. 1\u2019s transmitter lit up, projecting a holograph of the boss\u2019s face.\u201cWhat the h.e.l.l are you doing? Who gave you permission to kill?\u201dNo. 1 instantly shrunk in fear. He hastily began to explain, \u201cThese wanderers lied to us, so I was just trying to teach them a lesson. We\u2019ll depart right now.\u201d\u201cForget it. Since you\u2019ve already started it, end it properly. Don\u2019t let news of this get out.\u201dNo. 1 nodded and gave a signal.\u2026Dusk had fallen.Han Xiao was finally reaching the encampment. Suddenly, the smell of blood filled his nose, causing his heart to sink.\u201cI\u2019m too late.\u201dHan Xiao entered the encampment to a gruesome sight. It was the aftermath of a bloodbath.He spotted Hu Xuan Jun and An\u2019s lifeless bodies, causing him to shake with rage.Suddenly, a figure began got up from the ground. It was the big bearded merchant who had attempted to scam Han Xiao.Kai Luo had fainted at the start of the ma.s.sacre, and it ended up saving his life. Before he could rejoice, however, he noticed that there was someone looking at him. When he saw that it was Han Xiao, he began to tremble in fear.Han Xiao walked over to him and grabbed his collar.\u201cTell me what happened here!\u201d\u201cIt was the Germinal Organization! The Germinal Organization! They killed us because we wouldn\u2019t tell them where you went! Ah! They ma.s.sacred us!

He followed the sound and found Hu Fei, who was riddled with 5 or 6 bullet holes. He was on the brink of death.When he saw the handgun clutched in Hu Fei\u2019s hand, Han Xiao understood exactly what had transpired. Mixed emotions filled him.\u201cI told you the gun was dangerous\u2026 but you didn\u2019t listen\u2026\u201dHu Fei clutched onto Han Xiao\u2019s pants with a shaking hand.

A hole appeared in his head.Kai Luo\u2019s body collapsed to its knees.\u201cEveryone is dead. You should join them, too.\u201dHan Xiao closed his eyes tightly.Although Han Xiao\u2019s killing intent was skyrocketing, it was being restrained by his logic, much like a caged tiger. The cooler he appeared, the hotter he would erupt.Han Xiao walked over to Hu Xuan Jun\u2019s body. His finger was still outstretched, pointing towards some car trails.The exact opposite of where he had headed to!Hu Xuan Jun had not sold him out.Han Xiao\u2019s heart ached.Even until the end, Hu Xuan Jun had looked out for him, an outsider._____________________You have activated a Cla.s.s-E Quest[Revenge]Quest Hint: Eliminate the Test Subject SquadQuest Reward: 15,000 Experience\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afHan Xiao left the couple\u2019s side and walked into the tent to retrieve Hu Xuan Jun\u2019s prized bayonet musket. For a second, it seemed to glow and call out to Han Xiao.\u201cYou want to avenge your partner, right?\u201dHan Xiao took all the guns in his bag and lay them beside the bayonet musket. He began to dismantle them and use their parts to remodel the bayonet musket.Han Xiao\u2019s Basic a.s.sembly and Basic Enhancement were both Lv. 10.

There were 25, all looted from Silver Blade.As there seemed to have only been two cars, there was probably not more than twelve enemies.Han Xiao began to give chase into the forest.He knew that it would be impossible to catch up with a car, but that was not Han Xiao\u2019s intention at all.There was a high chance that they would realize they had been lied to and head back. Hence, Han Xiao planned to ambush them when they inevitably retraced their steps.Although if Han Xiao fled in the opposite direction he would be able to shake them off once and for all, an inner voice told him that he would regret it.The quest itself was irrelevant. This was personal.\u201cGerminal!\u201d spat Han Xiao hatefully.\u2026The forest was pitch black at night, making it hard to even see one\u2019s fingers. Wolves howled in the distance.Han Xiao had been lying in wait for almost three hours.Suddenly, the sound of engines approached. Han Xiao\u2019s face twitched. Four headlights appeared in the distance.\u201cFinally\u2026\u201d mumbled Han Xiao calmly.He put on one of the Night Owl Squad\u2019s night vision goggles and spotted the outline of two cars.He then c.o.c.ked the rifle and held his breath to aim.After eight seconds, he pulled the trigger.In an instant, the sniper bullet travelled across hundreds of meters to strike a tyre on the front car, causing it to explode.The car crashed into a tree.\u201cDo you even know how to drive\u203d\u201d cursed a dazed No. 1.\u201cLeader, the tire exploded.\u201d\u201cHow can a low-pressure tyre explode\u203d\u201dOne of the squad members knelt down to investigate the tyre.\u201cThere\u2019s a bullet lodged in here!\u201d he suddenly exclaimed.\u201cAmbus.h.!.+\u201dSuddenly, the agent closest to No. 1 was blown up in the head by a sniper bullet. His blood splattered all over No. 1.\u201cGet down!\u201d he yelled.The agents hurriedly dropped to the ground. A suffocating silence ensued. They were all terrified. Only No. 1 was able to contain his nerves and he immediately called for reinforcements.The Test Subject Squad was pinned. None of them dared to move.\u201cWho is ambus.h.i.+ng us?\u201d\u201cNo idea!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so dark here.

The enemy is one, why are we so afraid of him? What will the Organization think of us?\u201dThe faces of his teammates instantly changed.\u201cIt\u2019s just one enemy! We have cars, guns, and the advantage in numbers. How can we lose?\u201d No. 1 added.\u201cRight\u2026! We need to counterattack!\u201d\u201cAscertain the sniper\u2019s position!\u201dOne squad member plucked up the courage to reveal himself, hoping to bait the sniper into revealing his location. However, the sniper was faster than he could imagine. He was instantly shot. The force of the impact alone caused his body to fly back several metres.No. 1 felt a chill run down his spine. Who is this G.o.dlike sniper\u203dThe agent\u2019s death had not been in vain. One squad member was able to catch the muzzle flash of Han Xiao\u2019s rifle.\u201cI\u2019ve found him! 300 meters south!\u201d\u201cGet in the car!\u201dHan Xiao could see them get up and run towards the other vehicle. He instantly understood their plan.There were seven enemies displayed on the thermal imaging. They seemed to be betting on the slow firing rate of a sniper, and were willing to sacrifice one or two to get to the vehicle.Han Xiao decided not to rush. He calmly fired two more shots to kill two more of them before the rest hopped onto the vehicle. The vehicle\u2019s engine roared as it charged towards him.All of a sudden, Han Xiao\u2019s situation seemed to turn for the worse. However, he still appeared calm.The best tactic, he mused, is also the most predictable one.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The two trees were almost uprooted by the force of the crash, and, the agents in the vehicle were tossed around like rag dolls.Immediately after, the grenades exploded, setting the night ablaze. The bulletproof winds.h.i.+eld was heavily cracked by the shrapnel.It was a simple, yet devastating trap.Han Xiao tossed the night-vision goggles away as soon as the grenades exploded. The fire from the blast gave him all the vision that he needed. He began to fire. The rifle was so powerful that each shot caused Han Xiao\u2019s entire upper body to shudder in recoil.Han Xiao was firing at the windscreen, and from the pattern that the windscreen cracked, it was clear that Han Xiao was aiming for the driver, No. 1.No. 1 gritted his teeth and yanked the person next to him up to use as a s.h.i.+eld. In the next instant, the windscreen shattered, and the poor guy\u2019s brains blew up in his face.\u201cGet out of the car!\u201dThe remaining agents hastily jumped out of the car. In his rage, No. 1 began to spray wildly with a submachine gun. His teammates blindly followed suit.Han Xiao ceased shooting to reload.Bullets whizzed past in Han Xiao\u2019s surroundings, but Han Xiao knew that they did not know his exact location. They were simply panicking. He patiently waited for them to reload.The agents soon realized that they had acted too rashly, but it was too late \u2013 Han Xiao now had the initiative.Bang! Bang! Bang!There was a strangely beautiful rhythm to Han Xiao\u2019s shots.As his comrades began to fall one after another, No. 1 started to tremble. As he wildly fired, he screamed, \u201cWho the h.e.l.l are you! Show yourself!\u201dHis confidence had been completely and utterly destroyed.Click click click\u2026He ran out of ammo once more.\u201cShow yourself!\u201dSuddenly, Han Xiao walked out into the clearing.No. 1\u2019s eyes widened in shock\u201cH-h-how can it be!\u201dNever in his wildest dreams would he have expected Han Xiao to counterattack. He had, in his hubris, thought for sure that Han Xiao was fleeing for dear life. Despite all the facts proving otherwise, he had stubbornly refused to believe that Han Xiao was better than him. Now, it finally dawned upon him.Zero was way stronger than him.His false sense of superiority was instantly replaced by jealousy.\u201cI am the better test subject! You are the failure! A failure!\u201dHe pulled a handgun out and attempted to shoot, but Han Xiao was faster. A sniper bullet tore through No. 1\u2019s entire right arm.As No. 1 slowly turned to look at the right side of his body in horror.Han Xiao fired again, this time at No. 1\u2019s leg, causing him to collapse to the ground. He then took his time to reload before continuing to maim his remaining limbs.No. 1 lay helplessly on the ground as he stared at Han Xiao hatefully.\u201cZERO!\u201d he screamed hoa.r.s.ely, like a wounded beast.\u201cKeep quiet.\u201dHan Xiao strode forward to No. 1 to give him a vicious kick in his jaw.\u201cWanna know why I left you for last? Because I don\u2019t want you to enjoy a quick death.\u201dNo. 1 was writhing on the ground, unable to reply. Blood was continuously spurting out of his wounds.Suddenly, the communication device on his severed arm lit up. A holograph of the leader appeared in mid-air.\u201cZero, that\u2019s enough,\u201d he said.Han Xiao frowned.\u201cI am the leader of the Germinal Organization,\u201d he introduced.\u201cDo you think you can truly escape from us? No matter where you go, the Germinal Organization will find you. However, I can give you a chance to live.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d asked Han Xiao plainly.\u201cReturn to the organization obediently. I will allow you to retain your memories. You will be given a position you deserve,\u201d answered the boss. He was truly fascinated by Han Xiao\u2019s strength.No. 1\u2019s face grew livid at his leader\u2019s words. How could he treat Zero so well after all the men that he had killed?Han Xiao glanced at No. 1 and replied tauntingly, \u201cYou want to rope me in even after I\u2019ve killed so many of your people?\u201d\u201cA bunch of failures. Their deaths are not worth mourning,\u201d the boss replied instantly.No. 1 shuddered.\u201cWhat makes you think I want to work under you?\u201d\u201cWe are destined to accomplish greater things. Join us. What\u2019s there to hesitate? Oh, I know. Is it because you are still unhappy with how we treated you before? Don\u2019t be so petty, think of the bigger picture. Such things are trivial when compared to our ultimate goal.\u201dHan Xiao replied coldly, \u201cI have no interest whatsoever in your ideology. You killed my friends, so you are my enemy. That is all.\u201d\u201cIf you refuse to join us, there will not be a place for you in this world!\u201d threatened the boss.\u201cI will destroy you all,\u201d Han Xiao declared.It was the only solution.The boss burst out in laughter.\u201cDestroy us? What do you think you are? You are just a small, pitiful ant that we can squash whenever we want. Did killing a few lowly grunts make you think that you are invincible now? Childis.h.!.+\u201d\u201cWait and see then. The world is bigger than you can imagine.\u201dHan Xiao shook his head and raised his gun. He fired three shots aimed at No. 1\u2019s heart.The test subject squad no longer existed!The boss\u2019s mask could not conceal his fury.\u201cYou\u2019ll regret this,\u201d he coldly warned before ending the transmission._____________________You have killed the No. 1, the Valkyrie Experiment Test Subject, gaining 900 experience.You have completed [Revenge], gaining 15,000 experience.\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afCrack!Suddenly, the bayonet rifle came apart.The SWP sniper rifle that Han Xiao retrieved from the test subject squad had the prerequisite of the [Sniper] ability, so Han Xiao dismantled it to fix the bayonet rifle.Han Xiao had gained a total of 20,000 experience tonight.As the Germinal Organization would surely come for him, Han Xiao needed to find a hiding place. He was indeed still too weak to take them head-on. The wealth of information that he carried over from the game was his trump card.In order to make good use of it, Han Xiao needed to seek the aid of a power as mighty as the Organization.The Six Nations!Stardragon, Maple, Theseus, Raylen, Hesla, and Ordina.Since he was already in Stardragon, and they were the most peaceful of the six nations, there could be no better choice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If he is killed, then dissect his body to figure it out!\u201d\u201cWhat about those people?\u201d asked the researcher as he pointed towards the corpses.The boss was about to order them to be disposed of when a thought crossed his mind.\u201cHow\u2019s the preparation for the super soldier project?\u201d he asked.\u201cThe basic theory has been perfected. We are about to proceed with cell and animal testing. We should be able to remove any side effects and carry out human experimentation in eight months\u2014\u201d\u201cSkip the testing. Proceed with human experimentation immediately,\u201d interrupted the boss.\u201cErm\u2026 the risks are too huge. Only Valkyrie test subjects can endure the procedure, and there aren\u2019t many of them. Rus.h.i.+ng things might be unproductive.\u201d\u201cExperimentation can only create cannon fodder. Only vengeance can create true monsters,\u201d he replied enigmatically.\u201cHe is the perfect subject,\u201d he added, pointing at No. 1. \u201cHatred will fuel him. No pain will stop him from his desire for revenge.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dThe researcher nodded.\u201cSummon his soul,\u201d the boss ordered Hila.Hila exhaled deeply before raising her hands in the air. They began to glow in a grayish light as the surrounding temperature instantly dropped.Suddenly, ghostly wailing resonated in their surroundings, and No. 1\u2019s body seemed to respond to the cries.A gray, misty cloud of fog began to materialize above No. 1 before flowing into his orifices.The boss unfurled his jacket to retrieve a vial of crimson red fluid. Hila\u2019s expression changed when she saw the red fluid. Her eyes flickered with killing intent for a moment. She had to force herself to surpress her emotions.Aurora Reviving Drug.An extremely powerful healing drug made from her sister\u2019s bone marrow extract!The boss poured the fluid over No. 1.The fluid seeped into his body, and what followed next could only be called miraculous. No. 1 began to regain his color, and his wounds started to regenerate. The damage to his jaw was reversed, and limbs began to form out of his stumps.No. 1 suddenly opened his eyes. His face was twisted in agony.\u201d Zero! \u201d_____________________You have unlocked reputation with the Germinal Organization faction!Your reputation with the Germinal Organization has dropped by 1000!Germinal Organization: Hated (Traitor)_____________________You have triggered the Cla.s.s A quest, [A Seedling in the Dirt].Quest Synopsis: Freedom is priceless, and you have risked your life to earn it, but your troubles are not over yet.

In Version 1.0, the key event on Planet Aquamarine was the clash between the Six Nations and the Germinal Organization, and players were allowed a choice of ally.From Han Xiao\u2019s memory, there had been quite a number of players who had allied with the Germinal Organization. This meant that he would have to face up against them eventually.Although the Germinal Organization neither won nor lost, they did suffer huge losses. Han Xiao realized that he would have to watch out for compet.i.tors \u2013 there were many factions fighting against the Germinal Organization.Han Xiao felt that having to contribute 20% of the total damage done was asking too much. Nevertheless, he accepted the quest without hesitation\u2014there was no harm in trying.This is the main quest line.In Version 1.0, the events of Aquamarine were heavily centered around the Germinal Organization. Since Han Xiao would have get stronger on the planet anyway, he would definitely become involved in the war.During the character creation process of Galaxy, the system would ask the player to input his preferences, such as the type of planet or cla.s.s they would enjoy. From their answers, they would be sent to a planet that suited them. This was a key feature of the game and attracted many players. Some people simply liked exploring the universe and experiencing different kinds of civilizations. Aquamarine was a more \u2018realistic\u2019 science-fiction city-style planet modeled after Earth itself.The truth was that Han Xiao could just hide himself in the wilderness and wait until the Germinal Organization weakened. However, while this ensured his safety, he wouldn\u2019t be able to get stronger.When the main plot of the planet unfolded, there would be an influx of quests and missions. With Han Xiao\u2019s knowledge of the game gave him an unfair advantage.3 days later, Han Xiao finally emerged from the forest. The forest was situated within Stardragon territory, which made the fact that the Germinal Organization dared to setup a base here quite surprising. Perhaps, the safest place is where the enemy least expects them to be.Han Xiao walked for a while more before seeing railway tracks. He hopped onto a freight train that was on its way to deliver livestock to the Western Capital.As the wilderness was fraught with danger, and war seemed like it would break out at any moment, most of the public roads connecting Stardragon\u2019s cities had been blockaded. Resources were transported mainly by freight.Stardragon\u2019s cities were all enclosed in giant electric metal fences.Two days later, Han Xiao could spot the giant enclosure through the windon in his carriage.He swept aside the hens jumping around him to make s.p.a.ce to stand up and take a better look.Stardragon, Western Capital. Division 13, here I come!\u201cc.o.c.k-a-doodle-doo\u2014\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The majority of Stardragon\u2019s population was comprised of yellow people, and its national symbol was a celestial dragon.The bad blood between Stardragon and the Germinal Organization can be traced back to the Battle of Andrea, where the Germinal Organization had colluded with other enemies of Stardragon to launch large-scale a.s.saults on its cities during the crucial period of the war. Casualties numbered in the hundreds of thousands, and Stardragon had been forced to recall all its forces. Back then, it had severely weakened their status as one of the Six Nations.All of Stardragon\u2019s cities were barricaded by great electric fences of barbed wire, and the only way to enter any city was through a main gate.The freight train arrived at the open-air train station connected to the entrance of the city. The area was like a military base \u2013 there were bunkers and watchtowers guarded by the army. Troops were stationed in every corner.Over a thousand wanderers alighted onto to the station square. They began to queue up for the inspection. Only those confirmed not to possess weaponry or carry infectious diseases were permitted to enter.The Six Nations all welcomed wanderers. The war had caused a lack of manpower and talent.Han Xiao needed to find a way to evade inspection. The Germinal Organization had offered a bounty for him, so things could go awry if he were to be recognized. While his aim was to get in touch with Division 13, he could not risk being exposed before then.Fortunately, there existed a way.Back in the game, players that were wanted by a country simply had to pay a smuggler NPC a fee to be sneaked in.There was a very inconspicuous man in a corner of the station. He was neither queuing up to enter, nor seemed to be waiting for anything in particular.This man was the ringleader of the smuggling business, and normally, he would only serve people who were trusted in their network.Suddenly, he noticed a frail-looking man coming up to him. It was none other than Han Xiao.\u201cIs it safe?\u201d he asked.The ringleader looked up at Han Xiao. It was a face he did not recognize.\u201cSafe?\u201d the ringleader played dumb.\u201cI\u2019ll pay with these \u2013 enough?\u201dHan Xiao tossed his backpack to the ringleader. He opened the bag up to take a look inside.Holy s.h.i.+t! So many guns! Which syndicate is this young master the boss of?As guns were prohibited in the western capital, Han Xiao had to dispose of them one way or the other.\u201cEnough, definitely enough.\u201d\u201cWhere did you learn about my business?\u201d he curiously asked.\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201dThe ringleader took no offence to Han Xiao. He knew that he had been too inquisitive in his excitement. He got up and asked Han Xiao to follow.Han Xiao was led to a van parked outside the station. There were already a few pa.s.sengers on board, and when he arrived, he became the center of attention. Han Xiao found a spot and sat down quietly.The windows of the van were plastered with black tape. The van would bring them to a secret military side-entrance. As long as the price was right, the officer in charge would turn a blind eye.A short young man was sitting beside Han Xiao. Bored, and seeing that Han Xiao seemed like an easygoing person, the young man spoke to him.\u201cLittle brother, your first time to the western capital?\u201dHan Xiao glanced at him and replied, \u201cYeah, it is. How should I address you?\u201d\u201cMa Jie, you?\u201d\u201cHan Xiao.\u201d\u201cHannie, since it\u2019s your first time to the Western Capital, I shall introduce you to the city. The Western Capital is divided into eight districts. District 1 is the seat of the government, and where the officials reside. No one is allowed to enter there. The other seven districts each have their own attractions, but they are all secretly controlled by big shots in the underworld. Remember, never offend any of them, or else you might lose your life.\u201dHan Xiao sighed inwardly. The underworld referred to illegal operations like drugs, prost.i.tution, trafficking, and mercenaries. These \u2018big shots\u2019 that Ma Jie mentioned were actually just small-time hoodlums. Ma Jie was clearly trying to brag.\u201cWhat about the army?\u201d asked Han Xiao.\u201cHeh, what can they do? Do you expect them to raid the districts? My cousin is the right-hand man of one of the bosses in the underworld. I came here to seek\u2014cough\u2014help him,\u201d boasted Ma Jie.\u201cWow, you\u2019re so cool,\u201d replied Han Xiao.Being praised sent Ma Jie over the moon.\u201cOf course! My cousin is quite the figure in western capital. Have you ever heard of his great name, The Leopard? Oh, right, it\u2019s your first time here. Are you here to seek refuge with relatives?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ve come to find a job and settle down,\u201d Han Xiao chose a random answer.\u201cWhat do you say\u2014wanna come with me? Follow my brother and you will have a bright future!\u201dMa Jie suddenly became animated.Han Xiao rejected his offer, but Ma Jie was not easily dissuaded.\u201cLet me tell you what ordinary life is like in the city. Two words \u2013 poverty and sadness! Do you want to eat spoilt food everyday? The Six Nations are just putting on a show to welcome wanderers like you. The truth is that they could hardly give a d.a.m.n about you! If you follow me, I can guarantee that you\u2019ll be fed well for the rest of your life!\u201d\u201cNo thanks.\u201dHan Xiao\u2019s repeated refusals clearly upset Ma Jie.\u201cFool! You\u2019ll regret this. Don\u2019t come crying to me in the future.\u201dHan Xiao ignored the idiot and turned away. Ma Jie glared at him.\u2026A while later, the van stopped in front of what seemed to be a closed tunnel.There was an officer waiting for them on the other side of the fence in the tunnel. He opened the pa.s.sageway to let them in upon receiving payment from the ringleader.\u201cFollow the officer, he will bring you to the outskirts of the city.\u201dThe officer silently led them through the compound. When they finally stepped out into the sun, they were greeted by a line of skysc.r.a.pers in the distance.As the group scattered, Ma Jie glared at Han Xiao one more time before going on his way.As Han Xiao walked on the streets, he noticed that his tattered clothes were gaining a lot of attention. Without any money to quench his thirst, he had to look for a public water dispensary. All he had to his name was a seven-day stench.Of course, none of it actually posed a problem to him.\u2026Half an hour later, Han Xiao emerged from a shopping mall dressed in a white s.h.i.+rt and black pants. There was a cigarette in his mouth._____________________You have unlocked a new ability: Lv. 1 [Steal]![Steal]: Increases your success rate when stealing\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afIn his previous life, many real life skills had practical use in the game.

Joining the Six Nations would solve this problem.Han Xiao already had a plan in mind.In Galaxy, there was known to be a secret encounter hidden in the Western Capital.Han Xiao arrived at the gates of a workshop concealed inside an inconspicuous alley. The workshop was nameless, but it had a spanner for a logo.The secret encounter will be mine in this life!There was a chess table set up at the entrance of the workshop. Two elderly men were currently engaged in a game.Their appearances were in stark contrast to one another. The shorter elderly man was bearded and had long, unkempt hair, while the taller old man was prim and proper. Both of them were staring at the chess board intently.Han Xiao noticed that the tall old man had a missing arm.Both of them paid little heed to Han Xiao as he stepped into the workshop.Han Xiao took a look at the chess board. They seemed to be playing playing an intense game of Go.Suddenly, Han Xiao realized that it was not Go at all! It was Five in a Row!What the h.e.l.l are you guys looking so serious for\u203dA woman appeared from within the workshop. \u201cDo you need something repaired?\u201dShe had a fair complexion, rosy cheeks, and was around 1.65m tall. Her hair was clipped behind with a black pin, and she was wearing a black vest on top of denim shorts. Although Han Xiao wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call her a stunning beauty, she did have an extremely pleasant-looking face. She was very much the proverbial girl-next-door who had gentle eyes and a warm smile. She seemed to be in her mid-twenties\u2014Han Xiao\u2019s personal preference.Women at twenty can be compared to peaches\u2014good to look at but not yet ripe.Women at thirty, on the other hand, are like ripe grapes.Of course, these things are always a matter of taste.As for women at forty\u2026Huh, what about fifty?Fifty-year-old women cannot be described as fruits anymore! They are potatoes!\u201cMay I know if this place needs an apprentice?\u201d Han Xiao asked.For some reason, the woman was overjoyed to hear his words. She hastily grabbed Han Xiao\u2019s eblow and pulled him in, as though afraid that he would change his mind.\u201cCome in, quickly! You might catch a cold.\u201dHan Xiao looked up at the blazing sun and wondered, Is catching a cold the dialect here for heat stroke?The workshop was largely coloured in black and white, and there was a second floor.The first floor was the working area, and it was a fairly s.p.a.cious area. There were a number of vehicle platforms and workbenches equipped with various tools and machinery. Han Xiao could tell from the blemishes on the workbenches that they were relatively old. There was also quite a number of metal shelves lined up against the wall that were stacked with all sorts of metals and spare parts.\u201cMy name is Lu Qian. I\u2019m the boss here. You can call me Sister Qian,\u201d introduced the woman.\u201cSister Qian,\u201d Han Xiao greeted. He then inquired, \u201cI wish to take up apprentices.h.i.+p here. Are there any requirements?\u201d\u201cTell me your situation,\u201d replied Lu Qian. Her first impression of Han Xiao was quite favorable. She particularly liked the dead look in his eyes\u2014they made Han Xiao look like he was a b.u.m.He will probably be content with a low wage, she thought to herself.\u201cI come from afar. My name is Han Xiao. I\u2019m 21 years old, and I have some basic mechanic skills. You can call me Technician Han.\u201dTechnician Han? A puzzled look appeared on Lu Qian\u2019s face.\u201cFrom afar\u2026 meaning you\u2019re not a student of the Western Capital School?\u201dThe Western Capital School was an elite school that only a select few could enroll in. It followed a special syllabus based on the knowledge given to Aquamarine by the galactic civilization. There, students were taught Pugilist and Mechanic knowledge. Many of its graduates went on to become important figures in Stardragon.However, as less than 1 in 10,000 people possessed superpowers, having guidance did not make it easier to awaken them.\u201cI\u2019ve only learnt some basic Mechanic theory,\u201d Han Xiao replied humbly.\u201cThat\u2019s a pity\u2026\u201d bemoaned Lu Qian.\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean it that way,\u201d she hastily added.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cAnyway, I still need to test you. I do need a helper, but you will have to meet my criteria first.\u201dLu Qian went to fetch a faulty household appliance back to test Han Xiao. Before Han Xiao could begin, the shorter old man at the chess board suddenly spoke. \u201cKid, why did you come here?\u201dLu Qian frowned in puzzlement. Wasn\u2019t it just to find work?Han Xiao looked at the old man and replied, \u201cI\u2019m just looking for a job.\u201dFor some reason, his reply upset the old man, and he flipped the chessboard.\u201cI am the owner of this shop. Pa.s.s my test, and I will allow you to stay.\u201d\u201cOi, Old Man Lu, you\u2019re being a sore loser again,\u201d erupted the tall old man.\u201cI have something important to do,\u201d stated Old Man Lu matter-of-factly.\u201cShameless,\u201d replied the tall old man exasperatedly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This old man was an important figure in Stardragon, and Han Xiao knew that there was no point in trying to hide his ident.i.ty from him.Han Xiao\u2019s original plan had been to gain Division 13\u2019s trust before revealing himself. He intended to do so by feeding them with anonymous intel on the Germinal Organization. However, that was no longer possible.To have to reveal himself to Division 13 so soon had certainly not been a part of Han Xiao\u2019s calculations, but Han Xiao was not rigid in his thinking.Since remaining hidden was no longer an option, he might as well reveal himself and demonstrate his value to them. Like they say, the enemy of an enemy is a friend; Han Xiao and Stardragon shared common ground.Fortunately, he was now in the city; if he had been exposed before entering, it would have put himself in an unfavorable position to negotiate.Furthermore, the unexpected turn of events might prove to be a good thing instead. The tall old man was extremely influential, so gaining his trust would give him quite the head start.\u201cWhat test?\u201d he asked Old Man Lu in response.Old Man Lu looked around as he tried to come up with something. Suddenly, his eyes lit up. Pointing towards the tall old man\u2019s missing arm, he said, \u201cMake him a prosthetic limb. If it satisfies him, you pa.s.s.\u201d\u201cWhy drag me into this?\u201d The tall old man was confused, but he quickly understood Old Man Lu\u2019s intentions from his subtle winks.\u201cGrandpa, you\u2019re too much! What if you scare him away? Every day, all you do is drink, play chess, and go for strolls. When was the last time you actually bothered to help out with the business? Can\u2019t I even get a helper?\u201dLu Qian was disgruntled, but her words fell on deaf ears. Old Man Lu ignored her as he looked at Han Xiao for a reply.For some reason though, Han Xiao seemed amused.\u201cAre you sure you want me to make a prosthetic arm that satisfies him?\u201d he asked to clarify.\u201cIf you\u2019re scared then leave!\u201d\u201cI accept,\u201d Han Xiao happily agreed to the task.He still had the [Bionic Arm] blueprints that sat gathering dust in his inventory! Not only was Old Man Lu\u2019s request too simple for Han Xiao, it even presented him with the opportunity to curry favor with the tall old man! For some reason, everything seemed to be going well for Han Xiao, as though someone was looking out for him.\u201cYou only have three hours; I don\u2019t have the time to wait an entire day,\u201d Old Man Lu snorted.\u201cGrandpa!\u201d Lu Qian exclaimed in protest.Creating a bionic limb was not a straightforward task. Measurements first had to be taken, followed by designing, and lastly crafting. Designing alone would take hours, and while using a workbench would speed up much of the crafting process, that would still take another two hours! It was completely unfair!However, Han Xiao, was not fl.u.s.tered at all. He whipped out a measuring tape and asked the tall old man politely, \u201cSenior, may I?\u201dThe tall old man removed his outerwear without fuss. He observed Han Xiao thoughtfully as his measurements were taken. To remain calm and confident despite being pressed so was praiseworthy, he thought.\u2018But why would the Germinal Organization lay a million dollar bounty on him?\u2019Yes, the tall old man indeed recognized Han Xiao. The Germinal Organization\u2019s issuing of a bounty had caused a huge commotion in the underworld and this resulted in Han Xiao\u2019s face becoming well known. Such news did not escape his ears.\u2018Looks like there\u2019s some corrupt guards again,\u2019 he concluded from Han Xiao\u2019s presence here in the city.\u2018Why did Han Xiao come to the Western Capital?\u2018Does he pose a threat to Stardragon?\u2019These were the questions on the tall old man\u2019s mind. He decided to continue observing Han Xiao for now.While Old Man Lu did not know anything about the infamous Zero, he had his reason for wanting to chase Han Xiao away. A seasoned veteran himself, he was able to sense that Han Xiao had killed before. He simply wanted to avoid trouble where he could.\u201cLooks like Old Lu is leaving it to me,\u201d thought the tall old man as the pair exchanged glances.As soon as Han Xiao finished taking measurements, Lu Qian offered him her help.\u201cTell me your concept. We can draw up the plans together to save time.\u201d\u201cNo need, I already have the perfect design,\u201d declined Han Xiao unexpectedly.\u201cOnly two minutes?\u201dLu Qian\u2019s eyes were wide with disbelief.\u201cYour bragging might even reach the moon!\u201dOld Man Lu burst out in laughter. To come up with a complete blueprint in just two minutes was an impossible task even for him, what more a kid like Han Xiao?Han Xiao pa.s.sed a list of the materials and tools he needed to Lu Qian, who swiftly went to fetch everything. However, she did not hold much hope for Han Xiao as the test was simply absurd and unfair.Han Xiao started to use the pressing machine to shape metals into shapes and parts. He planned to use an aluminum alloy as the core material of the arm as aluminum alloys were light, yet st.u.r.dy, but also easy to shape. Having parts like screws, rivets, and chains readily provided saved him a lot of time.[Basic Machinery Affinity] gave Han Xiao keen intuition for the composition of machines. For a second, it seemed to him like the parts themselves came to life, as though they were excited at the prospect of being a.s.sembled into a machine. A mechanic\u2019s affinity and skills with machines was extremely important. Each level in [Basic Machinery Affinity] improved production quant.i.ty as well as crafting speed by 1%.A top-cla.s.s bionic limb could be operated simply by thought, and would be functionally indiscernible from a real limb. The prosthetic arm of the Winter Soldier was a strengthened version of such a limb. However, the installation of such a prosthetic would require surgery, as well as the \u2018Control\u2019 talents of [Basic Electromagnetism] and [Nerve Integration].With cybernetics, it was possible to replace any part of the body, except the brain, with machines to turn a person into a cyborg that relies not on physical stamina and bio-energy, but modular upgrades and replacements instead. Although a cyborg wouldn\u2019t need to eat or drink to survive, and could live much longer than a normal human, the loss of one\u2019s human senses would gradually make a cyborg susceptible to manipulation and eventually cause them to lose their sense of self. While this could be prevented by implementing thought programming and logic parameters to immunize one against external influences, they would then lose their freedom of thought instead. More advanced civilizations used this method to produce cannon fodder.A voice-controlled prosthetic could also be made with the \u2018Control\u2019 talent, [Basic Acoustics]. Mechanics were a multi-layered cla.s.s that was able to utilize all sorts of knowledge to create different versions of tools for the same purpose.Presently, though, Han Xiao was not that far advanced as a mechanic, and his concept was very simple; he was using the Lightweight Mechanical Arm as a model for his prosthetic. He planned to incorporate its dynamics and chains into his prosthetic for realistic movement. Unlike the Lightweight Mechanical Arm, however, it would run on clean batteries instead of smoke-causing fuel.Old Man Lu watched Han Xiao as he enjoyed a bottle of beer.

The others were surprised by the fact that Han Xiao did not create any excess parts. He had been thoroughly efficient from the start, which proved that he had actually planned everything out.\u201cMy G.o.d, he won\u2019t actually succeed, will he?\u201d muttered Old Man Lu, causing Lu Qian to glare at him. What a sly grandpa!Seeing them look so amazed almost caused Han Xiao to burst out in laughter. How could he possibly fail when he already had the blueprint in his memory?_____________________You have created [Bionic Arm \u2013 Left (Mechanical Version)], giving you 2000 exp![Bionic Arm \u2013 Left (Mechanical Version)]Special ItemA very realistic prosthetic created using the principles of machine dynamics and suspension.

One look at its structure and everyone present could tell that it was an extremely functional prosthetic.Everyone was shocked!He really made it!As Lu Qian covered her mouth in disbelief, a single thought came to her mind. I\u2019ve struck gold!\u201cThis prosthetic will look realistic if you cover it with\u2014\u201d\u201cSave the bulls.h.i.+t, let\u2019s test it now,\u201d interrupted Old Man Lu as he swallowed his saliva. Although Han Xiao had truly exceeded his expectations, his mind was still unchanged.The tall old man rolled his eyes at Old Man Lu and picked the prosthetic up to examine it. He instantly fell in love with it. It fit onto his stump extremely comfortably, unlike other prosthetics that had nonadjustable, rigid attachments. The reason that he did not like to wear a prosthetic arm was that they always got in the way of his movement. However, Han Xiao\u2019s creation did not give him this problem. It felt so realistic that when he moved it, it felt like he had grown back an arm! The elastic suspension enabled him to effortlessly make simple movements.Perfection!This was the only word that could describe how he felt about it.\u201cWhat do you think? Satisfactory?\u201d asked Old Man Lu coolly as he sipped on his beer.Lu Qian looked anxiously at the tall old man.The tall old man found himself in a tight spot. Should he help his friend? Or should he say his true feelings? Which was more important?\u201cThis thing is excellent. I\u2019m satisfied!\u201dOld Man Lu spat out his beer and glared at the tall old man as he coughed continuously.Weren\u2019t we allies\u203d We had a plan!\u201cSince you like it, you can have it.\u201d Han Xiao was not surprised at all.The tall old man nodded his head and replied, \u201cI will remember this favor.\u201dOld Man Lu was flabbergasted. The arm was made with my materials! Did you ask for my permission\u203d\u201cThen, can I stay?\u201d Han Xiao turned to Old Man Lu and asked, his lips curling.Old Man Lu\u2019s shock immediately turned into embarra.s.sment. As he turned around to head upstairs, he reluctantly replied, \u201cWhatever, if you want to stay, then stay. Let\u2019s see how long you\u2019ll last.\u201dLu Qian shook her fists in celebration.The tall old man smiled at Han Xiao before leaving the workshop. After walking out of the alley, he entered a black sedan car that had been waiting for him.The chauffeur respectfully pa.s.sed a mobile phone to him. As the tall old man picked up the phone, his entire demeanor completely changed. He now looked extremely stern, a totally different person from the genial old man from before.\u201cThe Germinal Organization fugitive has snuck into the Western Capital. These are the coordinates\u2026\u201d he spoke in a deep voice. \u201cHave the intelligence department monitor him for now. I have come into contact with the target, and will slowly find out his intentions. Unless necessary, do not act.\u201dDeserters of the Germinal Organization were highly valued by the Six Nations as they sometimes held valuable information. Unfortunately, most of the deserters were usually small fry. Han Xiao, on the other hand, was the first person to have a bounty issued for on him; it followed that it was highly likely that he possessed crucial information.In the workshop, Han Xiao turned his eyes back from where the tall old man had left.His performance should have let the tall old man know that he was not hostile, and laid the groundwork for a better relations.h.i.+p.There were three things for Han Xiao to gain from coming to the workshop. The first was that Old Man Lu kept a very comprehensive collection of Mechanic-related basic knowledge.The second was that this workshop was a good place to hide from the Germinal Organization. While the Germinal Organization had spies across the Six Nations, they did not know every single nook and cranny. This workshop was one of the few places that they were not aware of. And even if they found it, there was Old Man Lu. Old Man Lu was far stronger than the current Hila. Although he appeared like some carefree good-for-nothing, he was actually one of the few Cla.s.s-D superhumans on the planet. On beginner planets in Version 1.0, the strongest superhumans were only Cla.s.s-C.There was a lot of discussion regarding why Mechanics were a superhuman cla.s.s, such as: \u2018If Mechanics were limited to a normal human\u2019s standards, it would restrict their inventions by over 90%\u2019, and \u2018Only a superhuman can use some of the stronger machines they make.\u2019 At higher levels, there were stricter requirements for using the machines that Mechanics made. Some of them were even not usable by the other four cla.s.ses, but only by Mechanics.Mechanics were not all about big guns and giant robots! A high level mechanic could specialize in one of many things. They might prefer to wield swords, specialize in a.s.sa.s.sination, or even pilot mobile suits! These were but a few of the endless possibilities that the cla.s.s had to offer.The official information described the cla.s.s as such: \u201cMasters of combat machinery and compaction. Well balanced.\u201dAfter learning [Compression Technology] and [Spatial Technology], mechanics would be able to disa.s.semble and compress huge machinery into small capsules that they could activate whenever they wanted to rea.s.semble them instantaneously!After learning certain skills like [Rapid a.s.sembly], Mechanics with a large amount of energy would be able to create machines on the fly without the need for tools or equipment. All they needed was sufficient energy and necessary materials, and they would be able to bypa.s.s the creation process and instantaneously create whatever they needed.Player inventories were weight-realistic, and with these abilities, mechanics were the only cla.s.s\u2014apart from Mages and telekinetic ESPers\u2014to be able to disregard weight constraints.The third reason that Han Xiao had come to the workshop was the most important one, for the secret story line! Its rewards were some blueprints of early level G.o.dly equipment!In the future, Old Man Lu would leave the workshop and leave behind a digital safe that contained these blueprints. He would instruct Lu Qian to pa.s.s it to her father, Lu Cheng, who was a warlord amongst the wanderers. He and his father, Old Man Lu, were always on bad terms.Back in the game, a player managed to complete the tedious quest line and obtain the pa.s.sword to the safe. He then had to painstakingly search for the necessary materials to craft those equipment. However, it all proved worth it. With just that equipment, he was able to dominate the PVP arena and set the highest record of 38 continuous victories!While all that time and effort was certainly worth it for that player, Han Xiao didn\u2019t have to go through the entire quest line as he already knew the pa.s.sword!Although the secret quest line was a compet.i.tive quest, and only one person could complete it, other players that attempted it also learnt the pa.s.sword to the safe. Since it was not a big deal, the pa.s.sword was posted alongside information to the quest line in various forums.Still, the story line only occurred after release, so there was still plenty of time before then. Han Xiao intended to foster a good relations.h.i.+p with them first.For the G.o.dly equipment!\u201cI\u2019ll explain your apprentices.h.i.+p. Your meals and accommodation will be provided for; there is an unused room on the second floor. Your job scope will consist of helping out with maintenance work, as well as orders. I\u2019ll pay you $1000 a month, is that fine?\u201dLu Qian looked at Han Xiao nervously. She knew that he was skilled, but she truly did not have the money to offer him a higher salary.\u201cI accept!\u201d said Han Xiao without hesitation, at which she rejoiced.On the second floor was a full apartment complete with a living room, a kitchen, and several bedrooms.Lu Qian brought Han Xiao to his bedroom. It was furnished simply with a wooden bed, a wardrobe, a book shelf, and a small work s.p.a.ce.\u201cThis is now your room,\u201d said Lu Qian happily as she pa.s.sed the key to Han Xiao and began to dust the area.She really couldn\u2019t be any happier. A thousand dollars was a very small amount of money, not even enough for an average person\u2019s monthly meal expenses! Han Xiao was a steal!I must treat this kid well so he won\u2019t run away! she thought to herself.Han Xiao didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. Shouldn\u2019t the job applicant be the nervous one, instead of the boss?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Now, he had to wait for Division 13 to approach him.\u201cI am not strong enough yet.\u201dHan Xiao understood that he couldn\u2019t just rely on Stardragon to deal with the Germinal Organization. He had to become much stronger in order to be able to take matters into his own hands. In any case, for now, he also had to be strong enough to gain Division 13\u2019s special attention.Since there were neither quests to do nor monsters to hunt, the only way to get stronger now was through crafting. Han Xiao would need money to make machines, so he planned to find some way to make extra income. The city provided him with many opportunities. His long journey had only just begun.With only six months left to launch, he had to treasure the remaining time.After resting for a while, Han Xiao returned downstairs. Lu Qian was working on a household appliance at the workbench. Her denim shorts truly accentuated her perky curves, and Han Xiao couldn\u2019t help but steal glances at those slender, long legs of hers.\u201cThe orders are in the drawer,\u201d she said to Han Xiao as she wiped her sweat with a towel.The workshop didn\u2019t see much business and most of the orders were advance orders. Han Xiao picked out a few easy ones and began working.At 7 PM, they closed for the day.Lu Qian changed into a comfy white dress and let her hair down, giving her the air of a kind, beautiful sister. There were patches sewn onto her dress, implying that they weren\u2019t doing so well financially. Han Xiao wondered if the reason she wore so little during work was if she was saving fabric.Old Man Lu finally showed his face for dinner.\u201cLet\u2019s eat.\u201dOld Man Lu with his long and, messy hair certainly did not seem the type of person to do household ch.o.r.es. Their meals were, indeed, always prepared by Lu Qian.Han Xiao picked up a piece of char siu <sup>1</sup> with his chopsticks and placed it in his mouth. It was fatty but not oily, and was extremely tasteful. Han Xiao was visibly delighted.\u201cDelicious, right?\u201d smiled Lu Qian in glee.Now this\u2014this is proper food! What the h.e.l.l have I been eating for the past 6 months?\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot, so eat slowly,\u201d she added, pleased by the sight of his voracious appet.i.te.As they continued eating, Old Man Lu suddenly asked, \u201cWho exactly are you?\u201dHan Xiao, stopping his chopsticks in mid-air, replied, \u201cI\u2019m just an ordinary person.\u201d\u201cDo you think you can deceive me with such a blatant lie, kid? Tell me the truth,\u201d the old man snorted.Han Xiao\u2019s eye twitched.\u201cAnd what if I don\u2019t want to?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t want to?\u201dSuddenly, Old Man Lu tilted his head back as he began to release a domineering aura of strange, wild melancholy that threatened to engulf Han Xiao.A look of seriousness appeared on Han Xiao\u2019s face. Twisting, he leapt backwards five meters, raising his arms in a cross-shaped guard to defend himself.Old Man Lu\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201cI have a skill that can kill the target\u2019s very soul in an instant. Do you want to test it?\u201d he asked.\u201cDoes such a G.o.dly skill really exist?\u201d Han Xiao\u2019s face began to pale.\u201cThe level of strength I have attained cannot be comprehended by the likes of you!\u201d Old Man Lu snorted in reply.Suddenly, a black, stormy cloud arose from behind Lu Qian. Lightning crackled and thunder roared. Wearing the same usual smile that she always displayed, she tapped the table with her chopsticks and ordered plainly, \u201cSit down and eat.\u201dThe duo instantly returned to their original positions and continued eating, as though nothing had happened at all.The Western Capital was vast, comprising of eight districts and three citadels interconnected by military roads.District 1 was the central district and the Western Capital\u2019s seat of government. Regular citizens were not allowed inside.Although the Six Nations were united against the Germinal Organization, they still remained compet.i.tive with one another. After all, alliances were only temporary. The a.s.sa.s.sination of important figures occurred frequently amongst the Six Nations, and although they would always blame these incidents on the Germinal Organization or other dangerous individuals, the governments knew that 70% of them were each other\u2019s doing.The Germinal Organization, the wanderer\u2019s army, intelligence agencies and brokers, illegal arms dealers, individual criminals, mercenary a.s.sa.s.sins, hackers, and other kinds of shady groups comprised the planet\u2019s underworld.Dragonhorn Tower was the central building of the government, where the top bra.s.s operated from. Its walls were reputed to be strong enough to repel intercontinental missiles.The headquarters of a secret department was situated below Dragonhorn Tower.Beneath Dragonhorn Tower, at an undisclosed bas.e.m.e.nt level was the Stardragon Strategic Defense Division.Dozens of screens hung from the wall, displaying countless data and information. Intelligence agents typed away at their keyboards while even more bustled around. This place was the central network of the government, where information was filtered and channeled.Division 13 served not only as Stardragon\u2019s ears and eyes, but also as a hidden knife.\u201cReporting: \u2018Zero\u2019 has been located.\u201dA gentle-looking bespectacled female secretary hastily knocked open the office door of the department\u2019s director. A stern-faced man was seated behind the desk. Drool could be seen on the corner of his mouth.\u201cSpeak,\u201d he said in a low voice.\u201cDirector, were you secretly taking a nap again?\u201d The bespectacled secretary squinted at him.\u201cCut the c.r.a.p!\u201d The intelligence director glared back. \u201cTalk.\u201d\u201cZero is currently hiding in a machinery maintenance shop in district 7.\u201dThe director swiveled away from his secretary and she could hear him sigh in contemplation with his back faced towards her. After a moment, he turned around to face her again and said, \u201cThe higher-ups want to adopt a friendly approach.\u201d\u201cYou just turned back to wipe your drool, right?\u201d\u201cI really regret promoting you\u2026\u201dThe secretary pushed her gla.s.ses up and ignored him. \u201cHow exactly should we proceed?\u201d\u201cSince Zero came to the Western Capital alone, he must want to cooperate\u2026 Activate protection protocol immediately. We must not let Germinal\u2019s agents learn of his presence here. Have the hackers intercept any news of his trail and prevent leaks. Also, send an undercover agent to check him out; he might just be a spy they sent. Get confirmation before making direct contact.\u201d\u201cA traitor worth a one million dollar bounty. There are two possibilities: either he possesses important information, or he possesses great power. For now, we are unable to ascertain how dangerous he might be, so proceed with utmost caution. I don\u2019t want a repeat of what happened with Black Spider. Two streets bombed yet we failed to apprehend him.

Here, endless piles of trash were sorted out everyday.This place fell under the territory of an underworld boss known as Big Racc.o.o.n. Where there is light, there will be shadows\u2014such is society\u2014and this holds all the more true in times of chaos.Although the Western Capital was the main capital of Stardragon, it was certainly not a holy sanctuary for the law-abiding. It was infiltrated with spies from other nations, and plagued by criminal networks and illegal businesses. Small-time bosses like Big Racc.o.o.n may have been infamous, but they were certainly not the key players.As Han Xiao entered the junkyard with a dust mask on, he was stopped by a few vicious-looking thugs.\u201cKid, you\u2019re in the wrong neighborhood.\u201dA bald, muscular thug blocked Han Xiao\u2019s path as he stared him down. To them, Han Xiao, with his small frame, looked like an easy target to bully.Han Xiao, unfazed, spoke. \u201cI want to see Racc.o.o.n.\u201dThe thugs instantly burst out in laughter.\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to play with you, kid. Run home to mummy, or I\u2019ll break your legs,\u201d threatened the bald thug.\u201cIs that what Racc.o.o.n teaches his dogs to say?\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d The bald thug was enraged. He began to grab Han Xiao by the collar.Han Xiao looked back at the thug calmly as he squeezed his wrist.The pain caused the thug to let go of his grip, and when he looked at his wrist, he found that there were already bruise marks on them.\u201cFriend, which gang are you from?\u201d The bald thug\u2019s expression had changed to one of caution.Suddenly, he paused to listen to his receiver and stepped away from Han Xiao\u2019s path, saying, \u201cThe boss wants to see you.\u201dHan Xiao followed the bald thug and was brought to a resting area inside the junkyard where a thin man sat cross-legged on a sofa as he enjoyed a gla.s.s of red wine. From his appearance alone it was hard to believe that this man was the infamous Racc.o.o.n who ruled the District 7 underworld.\u201cI heard that you want to see me. What\u2019s your name?\u201d he casually asked.\u201cTechnician Han,\u201d answered Han Xiao.The Racc.o.o.n sneered.\u201cYou should know what will happen to you if you\u2019re just wasting my time.\u201dThe reason why he had agreed to letting Han Xiao in was that he was curious to see what business a snotty-looking brat had with him.Suddenly, Han Xiao reached out to steal the bald thug\u2019s gun. The bald thug felt a tug at his waist and turned around, but it was too late.The grunts behind Racc.o.o.n hastily drew their guns.\u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201d he asked nervously. The bald thug was one of his most trusted subordinates, and he was strong enough to take on ten people at the same time. Yet, he wasn\u2019t able to react to Han Xiao\u2019s speed! Who the h.e.l.l is this kid?Unexpectedly, Han Xiao began to disa.s.semble the gun, but it wasn\u2019t a simple disa.s.sembly. The gun unraveled almost instantaneously, as if Han Xiao were performing some kind of magic; the disa.s.sembled parts fell and scattered onto the floor.\u201cFirearms are a sure-profit. I can help you manufacture them in exchange for a little bit of compensation.\u201dThis kid can make guns!Firearms were hot in demand in the black market. Using a gun and making a gun were two completely separate concepts. Mechanics who knew how to create guns were rare and highly esteemed. Even though Racc.o.o.n was the leader of a gang, they were just small-time hoodlums. To be able to find a mechanic willing to make guns for them was inconceivable; yet, here Han Xiao was. \u2018This is my chance!\u2019 thought Racc.o.o.n.\u201cWhat arrangements do you have in mind?\u201d\u201cI will make a list of materials and parts for you to gather. Manufacturing and a.s.sembly will all be done by me. I\u2019ll come here to work for two hours every morning. I want $1500 per gun, and freedom to take anything I want from this junkyard.\u201dHan Xiao had already thoroughly a.n.a.lyzed the Germinal Organization\u2019s guns. He was now able to easily make simple guns.\u201cSince I\u2019m providing the materials, $1000,\u201d negotiated Racc.o.o.n.Han Xiao instantly turned around and began to walk away.This caused Racc.o.o.n to become fl.u.s.tered. He had only been trying to test out Han Xiao, and did not expect such a big reaction.\u201cWait wait wait\u2014we\u2019ll follow your charges,\u201d he hastily said.One handgun was worth $3,000 to $4,000 on the black market. Han Xiao\u2019s asking fee was still quite reasonable.\u201cGet a workbench ready, along with the materials. I will come from tomorrow onwards. I\u2019ll go check the junkyard out now.\u201dA skilled craftsman always retained the power to dictate his terms. Han Xiao knew full well his own value. Furthermore, his true strength and ident.i.ty was a mystery to them. This gave him the complete upper hand.\u2026Han Xiao salvaged quite a number of parts from the junkyard before leaving. As he left, he noticed that someone was following him. Clearly, Racc.o.o.n was trying to find out more information about him. However, for Han Xiao, shaking him off the thug was an easy task.Division 13 will learn of my mechanic skills\u2026 thought Han Xiao to himself. The fact that he was working with Racc.o.o.n would definitely be found out by them. In any case, it was a way to demonstrate his abilities to them, plus he also needed the opportunity to craft machinery for experience.The reason he had chosen Racc.o.o.n was due to the junkyard\u2019s proximity.\u2026When he returned to the workshop, Lu Qian questioned his whereabouts.\u201cI went to the junkyard,\u201d said Han Xiao, pointing to the big bag of spare parts in his hand.\u201cThe junkyard? That place is not safe. Don\u2019t go there in the future.\u201dLu Qian wasn\u2019t really concerned with what Han Xiao did in his free time as long as his did his job right. In fact, she had a soft spot for people who did not demand high pay.Han Xiao put the spare parts aside and summoned the interface. He still had a lot of unused talent points, and he decided he would dump all of them into the two unlocked \u2018Arms\u2019 talents.This workshop was a treasure trove of Mechanic knowledge. It was one of the best places to level up as a mechanic. Han Xiao went to look for Old Man Lu to borrow some of his books. He found him cooped up in his room as he expected.\u201cI wish to borrow some Mechanic knowledge books.\u201d\u201cGo away, you! There\u2019s not a single book for you here.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be so petty! Think of it as investing into a promising young man and nurturing him.\u201d\u201c\u2026It seems like you are more thick-skinned than me. However, I simply don\u2019t want to lend you my books. What can you do about it?\u201dWhat, indeed, could Han Xiao do about it?\u2026The following day, Lu Qian entered Old Man Lu\u2019s room with a spare key and stole some books for Han Xiao. Old Man Lu was infuriated.\u201cWhy do I have such a disloyal granddaughter\u203d\u201cJust you wait! I will make you leave this workshop!\u201d\u2026In Galaxy, each player\u2019s advancement mission was not always the same. Han Xiao\u2019s Lv. 20 advancement mission could be counted as one of the harder ones as advancement knowledge was extremely rare on beginner planets. In fact, his advancement difficulty was actually comparable to a Lv. 40 one.Most Lv. 20 characters were usually unable to find basic knowledge for even one talent tree. Some unlucky ones would not even have a main cla.s.s.Since there wasn\u2019t any advancement knowledge in the workshop, Han Xiao could only learn more basic knowledge. However, Han Xiao was content with this. Finding knowledge books was a common problem for players. Some players weren\u2019t even able to learn all their cla.s.s\u2019s basic knowledge by Lv. 40 or even Lv. 50!Fortunately for Han Xiao, the workshop contained a complete set of basic Mechanic knowledge, which more than gave him a head start\u2014it was an expressway to the finish line!Inter-galactic Contact Law (7th Edition).\u201cWhen coming into contact with new civilizations, these 127 intrusive actions are to be avoided: war, gene manipulation\u2026\u201dThis was why Planet Aquamarine had not been given any cutting-edge technology. Advanced knowledge was the best that the planet had to offer, and even that itself was heavily controlled and treated as a top secret._____________________Add 1 talent point into [Basic Weaponry]?

Both were Common materials.[Overload] \u2013 Active SkillDrains Energy to temporarily increase the output of Machinery by 30-50% at the cost of durability. If Han Xiao activated this skill together with his Lightweight Mechanical Arm, its damage and defense would both be significantly boosted. However, with only 120 Energy, he would only be able to maintain the skill for 10 seconds or so.I\u2019ve finally unlocked an active skill! rejoiced Han Xiao. Mechanics had so few active skills in their early levels that it was quite sad. His escape from the Germinal would have been much, much easier had he possessed this active skill back then.The [Robot \u2013 Rover] blueprint was an easy-to-obtain, early level robot blueprint. It was a low level utility robot that could be equipped with weapons and armor for combat, scouting, and defense purposes, and was also able to self-destruct. It wasn\u2019t created for a specific purpose, but could be modified and improved. They were widely used for prospecting and mining.Gaining so much from just two talent points, a bargain!Suddenly, he noticed Old Man Lu creeping up towards him.\u201cWhat are you looking so excited all of a sudden?\u201dHan Xiao rolled his eyes at him, replying, \u201cAren\u2019t you being a little too nosy?\u201d\u201cNosy? Why?\u201d Old Man Lu took a moment to inspect himself.\u201cIt\u2019s working hours. If you\u2019re not helping then go away!\u201d interrupted Lu Qian as she slammed her welding torch down. Her face was flushed and dripping with sweat under the protective goggles she was wearing.\u201cLittle brat,\u201d grumbled Old Man Lu as he carried his bottle of beer outside for a walk.\u201cShop owner, is this a repair shop?\u201dA customer arrived as soon as he left. It was a middle-aged man.Han Xiao turned to look at the guest, and he noticed the man was looking at him. The man immediately averted his gaze.Suspicious, thought Han Xiao. When he further noticed his above average sense of balance and solid footing, he realized that the man was most likely an agent from Division 13 who had been sent to test him.Lu Qian walked forward to receive him with a polite smile.\u201cWelcome. What is it that you need repaired?\u201d\u201cMy car broke down,\u201d replied the middle-aged man as he watched Han Xiao. \u201cIt\u2019s outside.\u201d\u201cAlright, no problem.\u201dJust as Lu Qian was about to pick up her toolkit, the middle-aged man suddenly pointed at Han Xiao and said, \u201cI want this little brother to repair my car.\u201dLu Qian was stunned. Do I not look capable enough? You\u2019re being s.e.xist!\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d agreed Han Xiao as he took the toolkit from his dejected boss.The pair came out of the alley into the main street, where an old sedan car was stopped by the roadside.\u201cThis is the car.\u201dHan Xiao lifted the bonnet, inspected the interior, and swiftly began to perform repairs.As Han Xiao worked on the car, the middle-aged man tried to strike a conversation.\u201cKid, you\u2019re quite young, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m 30.\u201d30? Do you think I\u2019m blind or what\u203d The middle-aged man nearly choked.\u201cHow should I address you?\u201d he asked.\u201cYou should show some sincerity when asking for a person\u2019s name,\u201d replied Han Xiao without looking at him.\u201cI\u2019m Feng Jun,\u201d answered the middle-aged man awkwardly.\u201cThat\u2019s a nice name,\u201d complimented Han Xiao, except that he didn\u2019t sound the least bit sincere, leaving the middle aged speechless.\u201d But you misunderstand; I just want a cigarette,\u201d he added.Feng Jun uncomfortably took out his cigarette pack and pa.s.sed one to Han Xiao.\u201cYou can call me Han Xiao,\u201d introduced Han Xiao as he took a puff and returned to the task at hand.Feng Jun continued to probe. \u201cHan Xiao? You\u2019re not a local, are you? Where are\u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d Han Xiao suddenly interrupted, cutting his words off.What the h.e.l.l? I\u2019ve only just started to probe you! Can you not be so quick?Han Xiao expressionlessly stretched out a hand, saying, \u201cA pipe was broken. I\u2019ll charge you $60. Pay up.\u201dOf course I know the pipe is broken, d.a.m.n it! I broke it on purpose!Feng Jun smiled as he took out his wallet and slowly fiddled around in an attempt to buy more time.\u201cYou have pretty good skills. Where did you acquire them?\u201d\u201cNatural talent.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s amazing. Where are you from?\u201d\u201cFrom the countryside.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHan Xiao raised an eyebrow.\u201cAre you trying to get a discount out of me?\u201dAt his wits end, Feng Jun coughed dryly before finally pulling out the money to pay up.Will the department reimburse me for this? he wondered.Han Xiao sneered. \u201cI thought it would take you another hour to find your money. How big is your wallet?\u201dAs he whistled whimsically, he proceeded to pack up and headed back to the workshop.When he left, Feng Jun cheerlessly made a phone call.\u201cInitial observation concluded. The target is a mechanic and his threat level is still an uncertainty. Duration of contact was 4 minutes and 38 seconds. The target named himself as Han Xiao. I suggest proceeding with more testing, and to avoid direct confrontation.\u201cMy a.n.a.lysis of his character? Hmm\u2026 yes\u2026 extremely annoying!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Han Xiao\u2019s daily routine now included going to the junkyard every morning to produce guns. He was paid in cash daily after each session, and was able to salvage a number of spare parts for creating the rover. He had already begun to craft some of its parts, but was holding back on a.s.sembling it.Old Man Lu would occasionally lurk around to spy on Han Xiao as he worked. He was trying to figure out Han Xiao\u2019s background from his craftsmans.h.i.+p. However, because Han Xiao was self-taught, his efforts were in vain.The tall old man frequently came over to compete with Old Man Lu at 5 in a Row, which Han Xiao found hard to understand. Is 5 in a Row that fun? The tall old man also gradually began to converse with Han Xiao more, and Han Xiao was more than happy to entertain him. Everything was going according to plan.For Mechanics, crafting rewarded the most experience, followed by enhancement, repairing, and lastly, a.s.sembly.As Han Xiao had no way of acquiring advanced knowledge for now, he decided to use his acc.u.mulated experience points to raise the 3 skills of [Beginner Machinery Affinity Lv. 3], [Basic Combat Lv. 8], and [Basic Shooting Lv. 6] to close to max level, and he gained quite a number of talent points from this.The prerequisite for advancing to a [Trainee Mechanic] happened to be unlocking [Intermediate Machinery Affinity], which required Lv. 5 in [Beginner Machinery Affinity]. Machinery Affinity was one of the common prerequisites for many blueprints and skills.Although Han Xiao now had a whopping 15 talent points, which seemed a lot, it was always better to save some for rainy days. This was something that he had learned the hard way.To think I actually had to spend over tens of millions of Enas (universal currency) just to buy Water of Lethe to reset my talent points back then!At Kero Junkyard, Han Xiao had been busily producing guns all morning.When he was about to leave, Racc.o.o.n pa.s.sed him a stash of money that he pocketed without counting.\u201cThat should be enough for today. I\u2019ll make a move first,\u201d said Han Xiao.\u201cThank you for your contribution. We don\u2019t need any more guns for the time being. However, our deal is still valid. You can continue to salvage any junk parts.\u201dNow that Han Xiao had served his purpose, Racc.o.o.n planned to get rid of him. However, it was not time yet. Racc.o.o.n was an extremely cautious person.\u201cFine by me,\u201d replied Han Xiao, who saw through his intentions.He left the junkyard, remembering to make a few extra turns to shake off his tail before coming to a large mechanic market.This market was popular among students from the Western Capital School and the Mechanic School due to the variety of machine parts and metals it offered.Han Xiao spent all of the 70,000 Aquamarine Dollars that he had earned to buy the remaining materials that he needed for both the rover, as well as another Lightweight Mechanical Arm.After obtaining the materials, he returned to his room to continue working on them.\u2026A few days later, Han Xiao had finished crafting all of the rover\u2019s parts, and he was now a.s.sembling the robot in his room.1.2 meters tall and armor-plated to protect its interior. Its top half was the shape of a person, except that it didn\u2019t have a neck. It ran on a basic integrated circuit.It had two sectioned mechanical arms that could bend and rotate like a person\u2019s, and its fingers were remodeled by Han Xiao into guns. Its torso could also rotate 90 degrees, and was inlaid with magazine compartments.Instead of legs, it moved on tank tracks.The system prompted Han Xiao to name his creation. Adopting his past naming style, he named it \u201cRover 1\u201d._____________________Rover 1 (Tank-style)Type: RobotGrade: CommonBasic Stats: 800/800 Durability, 18 Defense, 59 Power Output, 23 Max Speed, 120/120 EnergyHeight: 1.18mWeight: 64.8kgMode of Control: Remote (Electrical Signal)Control Radius: 50mEnergy Source: Battery UnitEnergy Usage: 8/minPower Capacity: 36/80 OnaRight Arm Module: Small Caliber Machine Gun \u2013 35-40 Dmg, 4 Firing Speed (Max 7 \u2013 for 10 seconds), 30 Magazine Capacity (+60 Belt Capacity), 40 Power Output, 18% AccuracyLeft Arm Module: Small Caliber Machine Gun \u2013 35-40 Dmg, 4 Firing Speed (Max 7 \u2013 for 10 seconds), 30 Magazine Capacity (+60 Belt Capacity), 40 Power Output, 18% AccuracySkills:\u2013 Self-destruct: Self-destruct to inflict 280-430 explosion damage in a 30m radius.\u2013 Metal Armor: Reduces damage taken by 8% (except penetrative attacks).Note: Don\u2019t underestimate this little fella just because he looks stupid.The name [Rover] is not exclusive to one type of robot.\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afThe key materials used to craft Rover 1 were two common materials: steel and plastic resin. If Han Xiao had used a higher quality steel alloy, Rover 1 would have higher durability and defense. Nevertheless, he would be able to update or upgrade the rover with better parts when he got them to keep it relevant. This was a selling point of Mechanics.The number of modules that could be installed on robots, vehicles, and mobile suits, was limited by their \u2018Energy Capacity\u2019. Beside the quality of the energy source itself, \u2018Energy Capacity\u2019 could be upgraded by \u2018Energy\u2019 talents. Rover 1\u2019s energy source was a standard battery unit, so its Energy Capacity was low.Completing the rover rewarded Han Xiao with 24,000 exp.The following day, Han Xiao finished crafting the Lightweight Mechanical Arm._____________________You have crafted Lightweight Mechanical Arm (Left), gaining 2,500 exp.\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afHis second Lightweight Mechanical Arm was still a left arm, like before.

Han Xiao did not intend to walk down this path as it was long-ranged capabilities that Mechanics truly excelled in, after all. However, since Mecha-warriors was the style that offered low level Mechanics the highest combat prowess, it would have to do for now.Han Xiao hid the Lightweight Mechanical Arm before heading downstairs. Lu Qian was engaged in a conversation with a customer who kept on glancing at Han Xiao when he appeared. He was clearly yet another agent from Division 13.Division 13 had, over the past few days, sent many undercover agents to spy on Han Xiao, but since Han Xiao was a tough nut to crack, they were now attacking from a different angle.\u201cWhy are there so many people asking about you?\u201d asked a puzzled Lu Qian when the agent left.\u201cWell, I\u2019m popular.\u201d\u201cBut they\u2019re all guys.\u201dHan Xiao froze up.\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think-\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry! I won\u2019t judge you,\u201d replied Lu Qian as she started giggling.Why are you giggling like that!Suddenly, Han Xiao\u2019s turned serious.

Han Xiao put the clues together and conjectured that Division 13 could have leaked intel on him in an elaborate set-up to test his combat strength. However, if that were the case, the people after him must not be too strong. After all, Division 13 wouldn\u2019t risk things blowing up in the city.Although Han Xiao wasn\u2019t interested in typical Cla.s.s-E mission rewards, the bonus reward caught his eye. A Skill Level-up Card was certainly something handy to have.If a mission had a bonus reward, it meant that there was a secret condition to fulfill. Han Xiao guessed that this mission\u2019s secret condition was most likely to kill all of his a.s.sailants.\u201cSince the enemy could appear at any moment, I\u2019d better not stay in the workshop.\u201dHan Xiao didn\u2019t want to rely on Old Man Lu.

Han Xiao planned to kill two birds with one stone. He put down his tools and called out to Lu Qian with a request.\u201cI wish to take the day off.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d replied Lu Qian, blinking. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d\u201cNo, why?\u201d Han Xiao paused.Han Xiao always looked lethargic and bored, and Lu Qian, being the observant woman that she was, had noticed the sudden change in air about him. If she had to describe the kind of feeling Han Xiao was giving her now, for some reason, dangerous was the word that came to mind.\u201cIf you\u2019re facing any difficulties, I\u2019ll definitely help you,\u201d she said in a serious tone.Not knowing what to say, Han Xiao stared at her, which caused her to s.h.i.+ft about uncomfortably. She turned away from Han Xiao and twirled her hair, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t you know its rude to stare?\u201dHan Xiao turned away too and replied, \u201cI won\u2019t be back for dinner.\u201d\u201cI was actually thinking of letting you try my latest creation, black pepper pineapple baked ribs stew with parsley,\u201d responded Lu Qian dejectedly.Han Xiao shuddered. What kind of cuisine from h.e.l.l is that?Han Xiao returned to his room to get ready. After a short while, he headed out with a backpack and a trolley.\u2026\u201cBoss, is that kid the target?\u201dA man wearing shades was tailing Han Xiao. Every time Han Xiao turned back, he would instantly vanish by making use of his surroundings, be it a public phone booth or a magazine stand. He was clearly a professional. He was using the mini receiver in his ear to communicate with his partner who was hiding in an old van two streets away. There was a total of five masked men in the van. They were none other than Han Xiao\u2019s a.s.sailants.They were the Bee Sting Squad, a group of mercenaries who specialized in hunting bounties. They were decently well-known in underground networks, having successfully completed numerous missions. They had by chance \u2018stumbled\u2019 upon Han Xiao\u2019s trail.For them, this mission was more important than any that they had ever taken on before. Bounty aside, they were hoping to gain favor with the Germinal Organization and earn their backing.\u201cHow could this kid be worth one million? He looks so ordinary! This will be a piece of cake,\u201d said the number two of the squad, full of confidence.\u201cDon\u2019t forget that we are deep in Stardragon territory. Act swiftly,\u201d reminded the leader, Kelly, as he inspected his gun.\u2026\u201cThe target is on the move.\u201dA black, plateless Jeep was following Han Xiao from afar. Inside the Jeep was a team of Division 13 field agents, led by their mission captain, Li Hui. Besides him were 8 other fully equipped agents and Feng Jun, who was acting as an advisor. They were armed with tranquilizer guns.Just as Han Xiao had expected, his a.s.sailants, the Bee Sting Squad, were indeed being used by Division 13 to test him, and these agents were, in fact, tasked to play the role of hero.Feng Jun brought up a video feed of Han Xiao.\u201cThe target seems to be headed to the District 7\u2019s Kero Junkyard. The Bee Sting Squad is following him. It would be ideal if the battle took place inside the junkyard.\u201d\u2026Han Xiao arrived at the Junkyard, to Racc.o.o.n\u2019s surprise.Why is he here?\u201cI\u2019ve come to find some spare parts,\u201d Han Xiao casually lied. It was a reasonably convincing excuse.Racc.o.o.n then invited Han Xiao for lunch, a.s.suming he would decline, but unexpectedly, Han Xiao agreed, causing him to be visibly caught off-guard.Han Xiao took his dust mask off, revealing his face to Racc.o.o.n. Racc.o.o.n found his face strangely familiar, but wrote it off.Although Han Xiao was unquestionably famous in the criminal world, small-time crooks like Racc.o.o.n were, for the most part, largely irrelevant. Hence, they were often not privy to, or bothered with, the latest ongoings.Although Han Xiao had been wearing the mask to keep his ident.i.ty a secret, it didn\u2019t matter anymore.A banquet table was set up by Racc.o.o.n\u2019s men. Han Xiao and Racc.o.o.n sat on opposite sides, facing each other as they conversed.\u201cHow was the last batch of guns?\u201d\u201cThe 73-WASP is an excellent gun. Even the Six Nations\u2019 armies are using it. One of them is worth six to seven thousand on the black market. I\u2019ve earned a lot thanks to you,\u201d answered Racc.o.o.n, as he puffed on a cigar. \u201cAnd the quality of your guns is way better than those s.h.i.+tty second-hand guns on the market.\u201dAlthough a batch of ma.s.s-produced guns wouldn\u2019t vary too much in quality, there would always be minor differences from gun to gun. These differences arose from the innate composition of the materials, but they could be minimized by a skilled mechanic. A gun expert would be able to tell a hand-made gun from a ma.s.s-produced one.\u201cWhat\u2019s in there?\u201d asked Racc.o.o.n, pointing towards the stuffed bag and the push trolley.\u201cSome spare parts,\u201d replied Han Xiao. Racc.o.o.n was satisfied with the answer.They continued chatting until dusk arrived, and the sky had transformed into a gorgeous hue of orange and indigo.One of Racc.o.o.n\u2019s thugs suddenly ran into the room, saying, \u201cBoss, someone is looking for you.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you see I\u2019m with a guest?\u201d replied an irritated Racc.o.o.n.The thug whispered a few words into Racc.o.o.n\u2019s ear that made him look at Han Xiao contemplatively. He then got up from his seat and smiled at Han Xiao.\u201cPlease excuse me for a moment,\u201d he said before leaving.Han Xiao narrowed his eyes. Something\u2019s up.\u2026Half an hour ago.\u201cCousin, I travelled all the way here just so I could enjoy a good life under your care. Please don\u2019t abandon me!\u201d pleaded Ma Jie as he chased after a young man.He had come to the Western Capital intending to join his cousin\u2019s gang, but his cousin had deemed him unworthy and given him a janitor\u2019s position. Obviously, Ma Jie wouldn\u2019t settle for it, but what else could he do but beg?\u201cI\u2019ve told you before, don\u2019t call me your cousin!\u201d barked the irritated young man.\u201cOf course, of course. My bad. I\u2019ll slap myself,\u201d replied Ma Jie, after which he actually slapped himself.\u201cJust look at how pathetic you are. I let you watch the door precisely because we are relatives! Do you know how many wanderers out there have only spoilt food to eat? I\u2019m going to see a big shot now; don\u2019t follow me!\u201d\u201cBig shot?\u201d Ma Jie\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cWho?\u201d\u201cThe boss of District 7, Mr. Racc.o.o.n! Each district other than District 1 has an underworld boss. Do you know how powerful they are?\u201d\u2026Before the pair realized, they had arrived at the entrance of the Junkyard. Ma Jie tried to follow him in, but the young man glared at him, causing him to give up. Just as Ma Jie was about to leave, he looked beyond the gates and noticed Han Xiao being welcomed. What the heck?\u201cIsn\u2019t that the kid who sneaked in with me?\u201dA thug stopped the young man.\u201cDon\u2019t loiter here,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019m also one of the boss\u2019s men,\u201d replied the young man respectfully. \u201cI\u2019ve come to make a report.\u201dSuddenly, Ma Jie interrupted them.\u201cWho is that guy?\u201d he asked, pointing at Han Xiao.\u201cWho gave you the right to talk\u203d\u201d snapped his infuriated cousin who motioned to slap him. However, the thug stopped him.\u201cThat person is an important guest of the boss,\u201d he answered.An important guest? Ma Jie was shocked, but his shock was immediately replaced by jealousy and bitterness. This is unfair! Why is that ignorant brat having it so much better than me\u203dScenes from their conversation replayed in his mind, causing him to feel embarra.s.sed.\u201cYou know Technician Han?\u201d\u201cNot really, but we did talk a bit when we were being smuggled in.\u201dThe thug\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up.\u201cFollow me!

That guy is a mechanic who knows how to make guns and our boss has been thinking of making a move on him for a while, but since we aren\u2019t sure of his background, we haven\u2019t acted yet. I just want to know everything you know about him.\u201dMa Jie\u2019s eyes lit up at the thought of being able to gain the boss\u2019 favor. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that could allow him to surpa.s.s his cousin! He sneered and shot a scornful look at his cousin.Who cares what happens to that b.a.s.t.a.r.d Han Xiao?After waiting for about half an hour, Racc.o.o.n came to meet them. When he arrived, both Ma Jie and his cousin hastily arose to greet him. Ma Jie was so tense that he even knocked his own chair down.\u201cYou know Technician Han\u2019s background?\u201d asked Racc.o.o.n.\u201cHis name is Han Xiao. He\u2019s a wanderer who snuck into the city with me. It was his first time coming here; he has no relatives.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Racc.o.o.n\u2019s eyes twitched.The sight of the boss\u2019 displeasure made Ma Jie think harder to recall something.\u201cOh right, he was empty-handed when he came here. His clothes were also extremely tattered, and he looked like a n.o.body.\u201d\u201cVery good.\u201dRacc.o.o.n turned around and left.\u201cAnything for you, boss,\u201d cried out Ma Jie after him.Racc.o.o.n paused and turned around to look at him.\u201cI like you. Join my gang.\u201dMa Jie\u2019s eyes widened with joy.I\u2019ve hit the jackpot!After Racc.o.o.n left, Huang Mao began to fawn all over Ma Jie. Their roles were now reversed.\u201cMa Jie, please take good care of me in the future.\u201d\u201cWhat did you just call me?\u201d scoffed Ma Jie.\u201cCou- cousin.\u201dBoth of them sure were shamelessly quick to adapt. Ma Jie put his arm around Huang Mao\u2019s shoulders gleefully.\u201cBrother, may I know what boss intends to do with Han Xiao?\u201d he asked the thug.\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? We\u2019ll force him to spill out the blueprints for the guns before silencing him!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good then,\u201d replied a relieved Ma Jie.\u2026Less than three minutes later, Racc.o.o.n returned to the banquet hall. Han Xiao had left all the dishes untouched. Racc.o.o.n smiled.\u201cHan Xiao\u2026 right?\u201d\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve found out my name.\u201dSensing the calm before the storm, Han Xiao stealthily reached for the Lightweight Mechanical Arm in his backpack.Click!He equipped it. Although he had already intended to do battle from the start, Han Xiao still remained as vigilant as ever. He had learnt the importance of vigilance the hard way back in Galaxy, but that\u2019s a story for another time.Racc.o.o.n began tapping his fingers on the table.\u201cHehe. I\u2019ve always been curious about your true ident.i.ty, but it turns out that you\u2019re just a wanderer! I must say, you have indeed been very cautious all this time.\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201dRacc.o.o.n\u2019s face darkened.\u201cDo you understand the situation you\u2019re in? Hand over everything you know about making guns!\u201d\u201cWhy so cold?\u201d\u201cCold? We were nothing more than business partners!\u201d\u201cWould you believe me if I said that I can slaughter all of you if I wanted to?\u201d Han Xiao smiled tauntingly.Racc.o.o.n snapped his fingers as he sneered. In an instant, the four thugs around him were pointing their guns at Han Xiao.\u201cDid you think that I wouldn\u2019t be prepared? What a joke! All of these guns being pointed at you were created by yourself!\u201dOther than Racc.o.o.n and the four thugs across the table, there were two more men standing guard outside the room, and there was little s.p.a.ce for Han Xiao to maneuver in the compact room.\u201cEven if I tell you, you will still silence me.\u201dRacc.o.o.n laughed coldly. It was exactly as Han Xiao said.\u201cI do hope that you cooperate though. At least it will save you some suffering.\u201d\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t?\u201d\u201cI have some men who are good at things like torture. You will talk eventually.\u201dSuddenly, the air about Han Xiao changed as he decided to drop the facade.\u201cDo you actually think that you have me cornered?\u201dThe sudden change alarmed Racc.o.o.n, but he shook his head.\u201cEven if you do have some kind of trump card in that bag of yours, do you actually think you can move faster than a bullet?\u201d\u201cWhat if I told you that there\u2019s powerful explosives in here?\u201dRacc.o.o.n laughed. Ma Jie\u2019s appearance had been, without a doubt, a coincidence. How could Han Xiao have made preparations? Who was he trying to fool?\u201cI don\u2019t know who the person who told you about me is, but he obviously knows very little. Why don\u2019t you try checking the underworld network to see the latest bounties?\u201dRacc.o.o.n frowned. How could Han Xiao remain so calm, and what was he playing at?Although Racc.o.o.n did have some power in the Western Capital, he was actually just a small-time hoodlum in the grand scheme of things \u2013 too insignificant to partake in the matters of the underworld. Hence, he paid little attention to such matters.He must just be trying to buy more time! Why should I even listen to him?\u201cSince you don\u2019t believe me, wanna bet? Life is always full of surprises anyway. Now that I noticed, this room is pretty small, isn\u2019t it? Perfect for an explosion. First comes the blast, followed by the shrapnel. Then, this entire place will be razed to the ground. But I guess that\u2019s fine, since we\u2019d all have died in the initial shrapnel\u2026\u201d\u201cEnough! I have no time for jokes. Stand up, or I\u2019ll fill you up with holes!\u201dHan Xiao shrugged his shoulders, sighing, \u201cCan\u2019t we talk things through? Fine, I\u2019ll give-\u201dSuddenly, as the last rays of sunlight dissipated, darkness descended.Han Xiao had been waiting for this!Vroom!The mechanical arm roared to life, shredding the backpack apart! Han Xiao flipped the dining table, sending pots and plates smas.h.i.+ng into Racc.o.o.n and the four thugs.Talk things through? Ha! As if!There were four thugs in front of him, and two behind. Han Xiao knew exactly what he had to do. He picked the table up to use as a screen and charged forward like an unstoppable juggernaut, holding the mechanical arm up in front of him.Cras.h.!.+The four thugs were knocked aside like flies.\u201cFire!\u201d screamed an enraged, b.l.o.o.d.y-faced Racc.o.o.n.The two remaining guards began to fire.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A bullet found its mark, hitting Han Xiao in his shoulder and doing 16 damage, dying his s.h.i.+rt with blood. However, all it did was give Han Xiao an itch. Han Xiao\u2019s pain tolerance was extremely high, and his solid muscles halted the bullet.Han Xiao smashed the mechanical arm into one of the thugs\u2019 chest. One loud thud, and he exploded on the spot. He then proceeded to yank the other poor thug up to use as a meat s.h.i.+eld against the four thugs who had gotten back up and were firing at him.Gathering all his strength, Han Xiao ripped out the door from its bolts and threw it at them before running out.\u201cChase!\u201d barked Racc.o.o.n.Dozens of thugs throughout the entire Junkyard were alerted by the gunshots and they were rus.h.i.+ng over to help.Kero Junkyard was Racc.o.o.n\u2019s main base, and Han Xiao had to tread carefully to avoid being surrounded. He looted a gun from one of the thugs he encountered which made things easier for him.With his fast reflexes, as well as [Basic Shooting] and [Precise Aim] to help auto-correct his shots, Han Xiao was able to always have the edge against the thugs in the battle of guns. If he encountered a group of them, he would tumble and duck and fire lethal shots as he evaded. The only limitation that he faced was ammo, so he would loot their magazines after each wave. The trail that Han Xiao left behind was b.l.o.o.d.y and littered with corpses, and Racc.o.o.n could hardly believe what he was seeing. Han Xiao had effortlessly taken out over 20 of his men single-handedly!However, there were indeed way too many thugs converging on Han Xiao, making it hard for him to take the initiative.Han Xiao hid behind the vehicle frame of a sc.r.a.pped sedan as dozens of guns were fired in his direction, their muzzle flashes lighting up the night. The bullet storm was deafening, making it hard for Han Xiao to even hear his own breath, and it was extremely difficult to return fire.\u201cGood thing that this is my territory. No matter what, he can\u2019t possibly make it out of this alone!\u201dRacc.o.o.n was seething with rage.\u201cI will make him regret ever being born!\u201dSuddenly, something unexpected occurred.Bang-bang-bang-bang-bang!A submachine gun was being fired from the side of the battlefield! The thugs began dropping in numbers as their screams filled the air.Bee Sting Squad was entering the fray! Under the guise of nightfall, they instantly overwhelmed Racc.o.o.n\u2019s inexperienced thugs.\u201cWhere did these mercenaries come from\u203d\u201dRacc.o.o.n was scared s.h.i.+tless. Are they after me\u203dHowever, the mercenaries suddenly changed direction and advanced towards Han Xiao instead, ignoring him.These mercenaries are after him\u203dRacc.o.o.n stared at the unfolding events in disbelief.As a villain himself, he understood the simple fact that the stronger a person was, the stronger his enemies. The fact that these mercenaries were willing to risk exposing themselves in the capital to go after Han Xiao meant that Han Xiao must not have been an ordinary person!He thought back to Han Xiao\u2019s words. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try checking the underworld network to see the latest bounties?\u201dHe wasn\u2019t just talking big\u203dWho exactly is he?\u2026\u201cThat\u2019s the sound of submachine guns.\u201dHis mission target had appeared! Han Xiao was able to sniff out the Bee Sting Squad\u2019s location from their muzzle flashes.\u201c300m to the west: six people, six submachine guns.\u201dHan Xiao rapidly performed calculations in his head. The enemy\u2019s firepower was overwhelming. It would be unwise to meet them head on.Lucky, I came prepared with my trusty Rover. Han Xiao sighed in relief. He whipped out the touchscreen remote control that he had created for Rover 1.When activated, the rover\u2019s visual feed would appear on the screen. However, the display was currently reading \u201cOut of Range\u201d. Han Xiao had to get to within 50m of the rover to activate it!Steeling himself, Han Xiao stood up and began to run back along his original path. He was instantly a.s.saulted by submachine gun fire.Han Xiao made use of the heaps of sc.r.a.p and junk to duck and take cover, advancing through the rain of bullets.\u201cd.a.m.n it! There\u2019s so much cover for him here,\u201d cursed a long-haired Bee Sting Squad member as he reloaded. \u201cHe\u2019s faster than a b.l.o.o.d.y rabbit!\u201dAlthough their original plan had been to a.s.sa.s.sinate Han Xiao, they had decided to take advantage of the ongoing fight between him and Racc.o.o.n to mask their intentions.\u201cHe\u2019s already exhausted! Go in for the kill!\u201d Kelly shouted out.After the earlier bloodbath, all of Racc.o.o.n\u2019s men were either dead or had lost all morale and were unable to fight. Seeing Han Xiao running so desperately emboldened the Bee Sting Squad, and they gave chase.While he ran, Han Xiao suddenly sensed danger and ducked down. A bullet narrowly missed him, severing a strand of his hair.After sliding under two more sc.r.a.p cars, he finally came in range with the rover!Connection successful!\u201cActivate!\u201dIn the resting area, amidst debris and dust, the cloth cover on the push trolley suddenly began to vibrate, and two red lights appeared from beneath it!The rover\u2019s eyes!The rover\u2019s engine started to whirl, and its wheels began to rotate as Han Xiao piloted it out of the resting area.At this point of time, the Bee Sting Squad had come extremely close to Han Xiao. Rover 1\u2019s defenses were not strong enough to take on the collective fire of six submachine guns, so it would be too risky to send him in head-on. The sole edge that Han Xiao had over them was the element of surprise, as they would never imagine him to have a robot as a reinforcement.Han Xiao surveyed his surroundings to find a suitable spot for an ambush.He found two sc.r.a.p cars along the Bee Sting Squad\u2019s path that were angled in a such a way that the bend they formed provided a spot of concealment! Han Xiao piloted the rover to hide inside the bend.The noise from Rover 1\u2019s engine was masked by the ongoing chaos, and only Kelly suspected that something was off. The instinct that he had acquired from surviving through numerous life-and-death encounters told him so. Pausing, he said to his team, \u201cSomething doesn\u2019t feel right here.\u201d\u201cWhat did you find?\u201d asked the long-haired man.\u201cThat\u2019s the thing; I don\u2019t see anything.\u201d\u201cWell, it can\u2019t be. The target is already cornered. He\u2019s dead meat.\u201dAt this exact moment, his squad entered Rover 1\u2019s shooting range, and Han Xiao was quick with the command.Du-du-du-du-du-du\u2026!h.e.l.l rained upon them from Rover 1\u2019s fingers!The entire squad was wiped out on the spot._____________________Your machine, Rover 1 (Tank-style) has killed a mercenary!

Let\u2019s go.\u201dHowever, right as they were about to flee, the rover suddenly started to charge towards them as it began to glow!Self-destruction!The deafening explosion set the night ablaze, engulfing the trio.About 50 meters away, Li Hui and his agents were shocked by the ma.s.sive explosion.\u201cd.a.m.n it,\u201d cursed Feng Jun, \u201cthis was supposed to be a covert operation!\u201dHe could already imagine tomorrow\u2019s headlines.From the moment that the battle between Han Xiao and Racc.o.o.n had begun, the situation had already gone out of control; the gunshots alone had already caught the attention of many civilians. However, as they were ordered to act only after the Bee Sting Squad appeared, they could only continue waiting in anguish, and it was now too late.Han Xiao got to his feet and brushed the sand off his hair. Things were not over yet.Although the other two mercenaries were not as fortunate, Kai Li had managed to escape the blast in time. He hastily scrambled to his feet to make a run for it when, suddenly, someone other than Han Xiao begun to open fire on him! The shooter was none other than Li Hui!\u201cWant to steal my kill?\u201d Han Xiao frowned. He had to be the one to finish Kai Li off for the bonus reward!Han Xiao began to give chase, and he managed to intercept him effortlessly from the side.Kai Li looked at the man who appeared before him with trepidation. The current Han Xiao felt like a completely different person than before.\u201cDie!\u201dKai Li gritted his teeth and raised his gun to fire. However, before he could pull the trigger, Han Xiao suddenly began to sway from side to side as he closed in on him like a veteran boxer!Fl.u.s.tered, Kai Li fired multiple shots, but they were all either evaded or blocked by the mechanical arm.\u201cNot even a single one hit\u203d\u201dKai Li was completely overwhelmed. By his estimations, no matter how strong Han Xiao was, he would at best be at the level of an elite mercenary. Only a superhuman could possibly move faster than a bullet! However, what Han Xiao was doing was equally frightening and hard to believe; he was predicting the trajectory of his shots from just the angle of the gun! It was a feat that only the most experienced of veterans could perform, and even throughout the entire mercenary world, there were only two he knew of that were capable of it.The look of disbelief on Kai Li\u2019s face amused Han Xiao. Compared to that time he piloted a mobile suit through the crossfire of entire fleets, this was just a piece of cake.Click!Kai Li inevitably ran out of bullets and he fumbled to reload. However, it was too late as Han Xiao had closed the gap, suddenly appearing in front of him.Paralyzed with fear, Kai Li could only watch on in horror. He could hear Han Xiao\u2019s muscles bulge as he stretched his left arm back to prepare for a mighty swing.Han Xiao twisted powerfully, transferring all the force and momentum in his body into his left arm as he unleashed a devastating hook, simultaneously shouting, \u201cOverload!\u201dBlack smoked billowed out as the engine of the Lightweight Mechanical Arm blared loudly, sending its gears and piston into overdrive. Its power was boosted by 30%.And Han Xiao smashed it directly into Kai Li\u2019s face.Critical Hit!Crus.h.i.+ng Blow!Blood splattered everywhere.Kai Li may have survived a number of close calls, but he never stood a chance against this one.When Li Hui and his team arrived, they were greeted by a blood-curdling scene.Kai Li\u2019s corpse lay limp on the ground beside a blood-soaked, expressionless Han Xiao, whose mechanical arm was covered in pieces of flesh. Half of his face was illuminated by the fire while the other half was grimly enshrouded in darkness.As experienced as these agents were, they were unable to remain calm._____________________You have completed the E-Cla.s.s Quest [Hunted!], gaining 10,000 experience.You have completed the bonus condition: Kill all 6 a.s.sailants.You have gained a Skill Level-up Card (Basic).

Although he couldn\u2019t see, he could sense that they were on their toes.Although one or two things didn\u2019t go exactly as planned, everything was still within Han Xiao\u2019s expectations.It was a quiet ride. The atmosphere amongst the agents was extremely tense, and only the sound of driving could be heard. They had been ordered not to converse with Han Xiao. On the contrary, Han Xiao had looked calm from the very moment that they appeared, which bewildered them. It almost seemed like he had expected them.\u2026Racc.o.o.n\u2019s face darkened as he looked at the aftermath of the battle.\u201cBring me a laptop!\u201d he barked.As soon as he logged in to the underground network and clicked on bounties, he was greeted by Han Xiao\u2019s face.\u201cZero, 1 million bounty.

It\u2019s all your fault! I will make you pay for this!\u201dMa Jie clutched his stomach in pain as he s.h.i.+vered helplessly on the ground. What did I do now?Suddenly, Racc.o.o.n heard the blaring of sirens and he turned to see seven or eight police cars arriving at the entrance.\u201cHmph, the ever late police.\u201dRacc.o.o.n tidied himself a little bit before going up to receive them. He was not the least bit fl.u.s.tered by their appearance as, from his perspective, he was a victim and he also had connections with them.But before he could say a word, the fully-armed officer pressed him to the ground to handcuff him.Racc.o.o.n panicked, and as he struggled to break free he shouted, \u201cWhat are you guys doing to me!

Both his expression and his manner of speech were stone cold.Stardragon\u2019s Strategic Defense Division consisted of 13 sections in total and was referred to as Division 13.\u201cShould we call you Han Xiao, or Zero?\u201d Feng Jun asked.\u201cWhatever you like.\u201d\u201cCut the c.r.a.p,\u201d interrupted Li Hui. \u201cExplain why the Germinal Organization has a million dollar bounty on you and tell us everything you know.\u201d\u201cWhy should I tell you?\u201d asked a bemused Han Xiao.Li Hui laughed coldly in response.\u201cWhat do you think this place is? If we want you to talk, you have to talk!\u201d\u201cSo what if I don\u2019t?\u201d taunted Han Xiao. \u201cShoot me?\u201d\u201cDo you think I wouldn\u2019t dare?\u201d barked Li Hui.\u201cEnough, enough! Calm down. Han Xiao, you should know we are with the government. If you cooperate, we won\u2019t treat you badly.\u201dHan Xiao smiled and s.h.i.+fted in his seat to adopt a more comfortable posture before replying. \u201cGood cop, bad cop. How outdated is this tactic? Can you at least try something different? I, for one, have a thing for pretty girls. Having to talk to two stern old man is such a turn off. Service with a smile, understand? Come on, smile.\u201dHan Xiao hit the nail on the spot, taking Feng Jun aback. Feng Jun coughed dryly and communicated with Li Hui through a glance, who understood the message. He abruptly stood up in an act of anger and pointed at Han Xiao as he shouted, \u201cThis is not a place for you to try and act funny! I have the power to imprison you for as long as I want!\u201d\u201cHow scary,\u201d mocked Han Xiao before suddenly wiping the smile off his face and adding, \u201cI\u2019m from the Germinal Organization. Threats? Do you think such things will work on me? Come on, you\u2019re making fools out of yourselves. If you want us to cooperate, sure! Show me your sincerity! Get someone qualified enough to speak to me. You two aren\u2019t!\u201d As Han Xiao finished his sentence, he tugged onto his restraints, slamming the chair so loudly that it echoed out in the tiny room.Feng Jun and Li Hui looked at each other. Their task was only to get a grasp on Han Xiao\u2019s position, and Han Xiao knew this well, which was why he was acting fearless on purpose to declare that he still had something up his sleeve.Suddenly, a deep voice was transmitted through the speaker in the interrogation room. \u201cAs you wish, I will talk with you.\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201d asked Han Xiao as he turned to the obvious one-way mirror.\u201cDivision 13, intelligence director. Do I qualify to speak to you?\u201d\u201cI guess you will do,\u201d Han Xiao nonchalantly replied.Both Li Hui and Feng Jun\u2019s eyes twitched. What a shameless person!The intelligence director let it slide and started to ask, \u201cYou just said that you are from the Germinal Organization\u2014\u201d\u201cI was.\u201d Han Xiao corrected him mid-speech.\u201cSo, you have deserted?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat was your position?\u201d\u201cA logistics research personnel.\u201d\u201cWhat did you research?\u201d\u201cMachinery and weapons.\u201d\u201cYou are lying,\u201d cut the intelligence director. \u201cHow can that explain your million dollar bounty?\u201dHan Xiao smiled \u2013 he had expected this very question.\u201cRather than call me a liar, haven\u2019t you guys already a.s.sumed that I possess some kind of valuable intel? Isn\u2019t that why you\u2019ve been investigating me from a distance?\u201d he replied. \u201cIntel can indeed be used as a weapon \u2013 but only in the right hands. I left my trail exposed to prove my willingness to cooperate. I am not your enemy. The Germinal Organization is. And they are my enemy too.\u201d\u201cWhy should we even bother to cooperate with you?\u201d asked the intelligence director in reply. \u201cLook around you \u2013 you are in our territory. We have all sorts of tools to make you talk!\u201dHan Xiao paused to smile calmly for a moment before suddenly saying, \u201cMessage log: Galaxy Calendar Year 687, 14th of June. Signal location: Planet Aquamarine. Destination: Planet Blackstar\u2019s 8th base. The contents of this message are top secret.\u201dThe intelligence director remained silent for a full ten minutes.Li Hui and Feng Jun gave a start when they realized that although what Han Xiao had spoken of made no sense to them, it was clearly valuable intel to the director who in turn had to go relay the information to the top bra.s.s for further instruction.After the long wait, the intelligence director spoke through the speaker again. This time though, he sounded extremely serious.\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asked directly.\u201cHow would I know of Blackstar otherwise?\u201d\u201c\u2026Fine.\u201dThe intelligence director was wearing a grave expression. If the intel that Han Xiao had given him was actually true, it was extremely crucial to not only Stardragon, but the entire planet.Han Xiao smirked. He had obviously come well-prepared.In the exploration era, there existed three galactic powers who had been warring for tens of thousands of year. Although it took a long time, the three powers eventually came to an agreement and ceased their fighting. They agreed to work together for peace, order, and advancement.The universe was extremely vast; it was filled with countless stars and far more life-forms that thrived in every corner. Large amounts of data and information were constantly being broadcast throughout the universe via technology, and the amalgamation of the thoughts and wills of all life in the universe gave rise to a phenomenon known as \u2018the whispers of the universe\u2019.Although the universe did appear calm and static on the surface, it was, in fact, bustling with activity.All kinds of civilizations underwent the same phase \u2013 from admiring s.p.a.ce to wondering if they were the only ones. In their hubris, they would conquer their respective galaxies before entering the vast universe, thinking that they were the destined ones \u2013 only to find that they were not alone, and definitely not special at all.The explored universe could be seen as divided into numerous sectors. For example: the Shattered Belt, the Ancient Starfield, the Silver Spiral, and the Sea of Purity. A sector comprised of dozens of star cl.u.s.ters, each containing numerous galaxies that in turn housed planetary systems or star systems that were number-coded, homes to the innumerable planets. Together, they formed the thrilling universal landscape of the game \u2018Galaxy\u2019.Shattered Belt \u2013 Colton Group \u2013 The Garden \u2013 9th System \u2013 Planet Aquamarine. This was basically Aquamarine\u2019s place in the vast universe. Its precise coordinates would take a combination of words and numbers derived using complex math to describe.The interstellar power that had come into contact with Aquamarine was an advanced civilization of The Garden, the Kedolas. The \u2018Blackstar\u2019 that Han Xiao referred to was originally a part of the Kedolas, but they broke away in an attempt to seize power and were now bitter enemies.The world of \u2018Galaxy\u2019 was ma.s.sive, and many powers and civilizations were constantly at odds with one other. A civilization\u2019s degree of advancement largely depended on its s.p.a.ce travel capabilities. As the Kedolas could freely travel between systems without relying on wormholes or stargates created by even advanced civilizations, they were considered a galactic civilization \u2013 a few levels higher than Planet Aquamarine.If the Germinal Organization had actually come into contact with Blackstar and gained their support, things would be extremely grim for the Six Nations. An evil power like them paid no heed to the exploration rules laid down by the Three Powers: The Universal Treaty (currently in its 7th revised edition).The fact that Aquamarine had been contacted by an interstellar power was top secret information withheld by the Six Nations. Hence, the intelligence director believed Han Xiao to be speaking the truth, and this was what made him extremely nervous.However, the truth was that the Germinal Organization had made no such contact with Blackstar. Han Xiao simply made it up because it was impossible to verify anyway. It was a sly tactic to get them to not only value him, but also take action against the Germinal Organization. Furthermore, it would help him complete his main quest, so why not?All the beginner planets were situated quite far away from each other. However, there were specialized galactic tourism services that one could get in touch with as long as he had a device capable of interstellar transmission. They would automatically locate the transmission and come to the buyer. As long as one had enough money, even having a full tour across the entire universe was not impossible. After all, if players on different planets weren\u2019t able to come together, how would compet.i.tions and tournaments be held in Galaxy? Most game events were held on neutral or uninhabited planets.\u201cGet me a map of Stardragon and a pen,\u201d asked Han Xiao suddenly.Feng Jun went to fetch the items and put them on the table. Han Xiao picked up the pen and circled three locations on the map, saying briefly, \u201cThese are three of the Germinal Organization\u2019s secret bases in Stardragon. Treat it as my proof of sincerity.\u201d\u201cYou only know 3?\u201dHan Xiao rolled his eyes inwardly.\u201cOf course not. But you can go check these ones out first. We can talk more after.\u201d\u201cWhat are your conditions?\u201d asked the intelligence director at long last. Feng Jun and Li Hui closely watched Han Xiao in antic.i.p.ation.\u201cI just want us to work together against Germinal,\u201d replied Han Xiao with a mysterious smile.That\u2019s all? thought the director to himself.\u201cI will relay our conversation to the higher-ups. Sorry, but you\u2019ll have to continue staying here for the time being.\u201dClick!The mic was turned off.Han Xiao frowned as he shook around his handcuffs.\u201cDon\u2019t take too long. I only have a day off.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With his help, we will be able to launch precise attacks on the Germinal Organization\u2019s bases. He is a mechanic, and has demonstrated combat ability on par with elite agents. He is willing to cooperate\u2026\u201d read the intelligence head from a compiled report.\u201cI believe that we can put some trust in him and work together,\u201d he added.After a few seconds of uncertain silence, the Internal Affairs Minister was the first to raise his objection.\u201cNo way. What if the intel he gives us is false?\u201dDivision 13 was split into two factions: the hardliners, led by the Internal Affairs Minister, and the conservatives, led by the Intelligence Minister.The two factions sat separately.\u201cThat is very unlikely,\u201d answered the Intelligence Minister. \u201cHe is a deserter of the Germinal Organization, and only stands a chance to live if he gains our protection. There is no reason to doubt his willingness to cooperate.\u201d\u201cFor all you know, it could just be an elaborate act!\u201d The Internal Affairs Ministers shot back. \u201cI suggest we detain him and extract the intel from him by force! Division 13 doesn\u2019t need to negotiate with anyone.\u201d\u201cYou are being ridiculous! Such measures are uncalled for! Han Xiao has already demonstrated his sincerity to us, what we should be doing is accepting it and working together against the common enemy!\u201d\u201cThat is what a coward would do!\u201d\u201cYou are the definition of brainless!\u201dUnder the leaders.h.i.+p of their respective spokesmen, the other members from the two factions began to engage in an exchange of insults. Although both factions valued the intel that Han Xiao possessed, one faction wanted to befriend him and work together, while the other faction saw him as a potential threat. The squabble looked like it was almost about to escalate into a brawl.The director and vice-director simply watched on. The director was the person with the most power in Division 13, while the vice-director was actually a bureaucrat tasked by the higher-ups to perform supervision. He was also referred to as the administrative director.It wouldn\u2019t be unusual for there to be power struggles for the director position in an inst.i.tution like Division 13, but the vice-director actually couldn\u2019t be bothered with much at all. Take now for example: he had been sitting still from the start without uttering a single word, as though his spirit had left his body and was on a tour of the world. He was probably even more concerned with what he would have for dinner later on. Well, if you consider that his ambitious predecessor had ended up mysteriously charged with treason, wanting to maintain a low profile was understandable.The director, on the other hand, was a dignified-looking man who commanded respect. He contemplated for a moment before speaking his mind, \u201cSince you want to both cooperate with him and control him, isn\u2019t there a perfect solution? Let\u2019s recruit him to the department.\u201dThe bickering crowd instantly broke up; silence ensued. The hardliners stared at the director blankly.What the heck\u203d\u201cAbsolutely no way!\u201d\u201cWhat if Han Xiao\u2019s motive was precisely to infiltrate us\u203d\u201d\u201cThat goes against our secrecy policy!\u201dThe director suddenly bellowed, \u201cWe\u2019ll settle it the way we always do; we\u2019ll have a vote!\u201dThe conservatives rejoiced. Aside from the one neutral minister, each faction had exactly 6 people. With the director\u2019s vote, they would most likely win it. On the other hand, the hardliners were panicking.Suddenly, the Internal Affairs Ministers spoke, \u201cI think that the logistics department will suit him well. Not only will it maximize his usefulness as a mechanic, we will be able to keep him under close watch since he will be inside the headquarters.\u201dHe had already resigned himself to the inevitable.For once, the conservatives agreed with him. The logistics department was indeed the best option as Han Xiao would be confined to the HQ.However, the director suddenly cut in, \u201cSince we are going to make use of his talents anyway, might as well a.s.sign him to the covert ops department!\u201dThe atmosphere in the conference room suddenly froze. All the ministers turned and looked towards the neutral minister \u2013 the covert ops minister who had been in the middle of yawning.\u201cAhhh\u2014 eh, what? Me?\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s settled!\u201d decided the director as he slammed the table. \u201cWords and actions may be deceiving, but motives are not. We\u2019ll let him join the covert ops department after verifying the locations he\u2019s disclosed.\u201dThe ministers all face-palmed themselves. Whatever makes you happy, boss.The vice-director yawned to break the silence.\u201cTime to finish up already? What\u2019s on the canteen menu today?\u201d\u2026After the conference, the intelligence minister and the logistics minister proceeded to the logistics department together to examine the Lightweight Mechanical Arm.They were interested to see Han Xiao\u2019s craftsmans.h.i.+p to gain insight on him.The personnel they had tasked with conducting the examination was Luo Xuan, the \u2018ace\u2019 of the logistics department. He was the top machinery studies student of his year at the Western Capital University, and had been recruited directly into Division 13, where his continued excellence earned him the favor of his higher-ups. There were plans to transfer him to the covert ops department.He was flawless \u2013 apart from being too arrogant.\u201cBegin.\u201dLuo Xuan began to get to work with the Lightweight Mechanical Arm, but he suddenly stopped and reported, \u201cIt\u2019s encrypted.\u201dMachines were commonly installed with encryption to prevent unauthorized disa.s.sembly and reverse engineering. The [Basic a.s.sembly] knowledge that Han Xiao possessed came with the method to install such encryption. The encryption that he had installed would take an E-cla.s.s mechanic to crack. Evidently, Han Xiao had antic.i.p.ated this series of events.Rover One was also encrypted\u2014not that it mattered, since it had self-destructed.\u201cCan you crack it?\u201d asked the intelligence director.\u201cNo problem,\u201d replied the confident Luo Xuan. He didn\u2019t think that it was possible for an unknown mechanic to make a lock that he, a genius, couldn\u2019t crack.Twenty minutes later, however, he had not made any progress, and was sweating profusely. \u201cFour-layered encryption\u203d Is the b.a.s.t.a.r.d who made this machine crazy or something?\u201dA four-layered encryption was extremely complex to crack as the slightest error would cause the machine\u2019s internals to disintegrate, rendering it useless. Luo Xuan was at a loss of how to proceed.The intelligence director\u2019s face had long since darkened.\u201cCan you crack it or not? Don\u2019t waste my time.\u201dLuo Xuan suppressed his irritation and, through gritted teeth, replied, \u201cThis encryption is too complex. I\u2014 I need more time.\u201d\u201cEnough. I don\u2019t have the time to wait for you. Just tell me your thoughts on the arm.\u201dLuo Xuan face darkened in displeasure and he replied, frustrated, \u201cThe craftsmans.h.i.+p itself is nothing special. Only the encryption was well made. Feels like the creator is some b.u.mpkin who treats garbage like treasure.\u201dThe intelligence director\u2019s eyes twitched, but he left without saying anything else. His men retrieved the Lightweight Mechanical Arm. His next plan was to perform actual combat testing at the Germinal bases that Han Xiao had revealed to them.He was actually more interested in the rover; it was a shame it was burnt beyond recognition.Division 13 may have been powerful and mighty, but one could never have enough new weapons.\u201cThe research department is always allocated with the largest cut of the budget, yet those useless fools only know how to create useless c.r.a.p like double-sided sticky bombs, curved guns that don\u2019t work at all, and fake nipples to hide poison needles! They even have male and female versions!\u201dThe covert ops department had borne a grudge against the research team ever since two of their agents were self-poisoned due to a \u2018wardrobe malfunction\u2019.\u2026Meanwhile, the director was making a phone call to the tall old man.\u201cI have ensured that Han Xiao will join the covert ops team.\u201d\u201cGood work. Thank you.\u201d\u201cOld man, is he really worth doing all this for?\u201d asked the director curiously.\u201cHeh heh. Intel is not all he has to offer. I have a feeling that he will play a crucial role in the battle against the Germinal Organization.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Below, the streets were cold and empty, and fragments of broken gla.s.s littered the line of stores. The stores were in an utter mess; clearly, they had been plundered.A piece of yellowed newspaper from who knows what year danced about on the streets, carried by the faint wind.Moonlight filtered through the thick cloud of dust to lend the city some of its l.u.s.ter\u2014the city\u2019s only source of light.This was an abandoned city. It had once belonged to a great nation, but even this great nation no longer existed, and its people had moved to other places. The living conditions here were so poor that even wanderers avoided this place.Countless other cities had been similarly abandoned over the last few decades of change. As soon as the people left though, these forsaken jungles of concrete and steel became flouris.h.i.+ng grounds for vegetation.According to Han Xiao\u2019s intel, the Germinal Organization had three bases within Stardragon territory. One of them was located here. The nation\u2019s top bra.s.s had been both shocked and angered to learn of the presence of Germinal bases in the country. Within 24 hours, troops had been dispatched from the nearest military bases to attack.Currently, the city was being bombarded. Over a dozen armored military vehicles had entered the city, and the sound of gunfire and cannon fire was incessant. Screams filled the night.However, the surface battle was just a diversion.3 covert ops agents had been tasked to infiltrate the base. They\u2019d just arrived at a side entrance.Li Ya Lin was an agent with level 4 clearance. A beautiful, young woman with extremely fair skin, she wore a yellow hoodie on top of black compression tights that accentuated her s.e.xy, nose-bleed-inducing body. She had an athletic build.Li Ya Lin held her hands up in the air as she stretched her back, demonstrating impressive flexibility in the beautifully arced, well-proportioned body of hers. She was clearly the most carefree and energetic of the trio.She stopped chewing on her bubblegum to complain, \u201cI was finally able to take a break because of my leader\u2019s injury, but they call me back so suddenly for an emergency mission. Are agents not humans?\u201dLambert continued to polish his dagger silently. Lambert was the \u2018ace\u2019 of a top-secret, unofficial squad during his time in the military, and he had been secretly transferred to the covert ops department after his \u2018discharge\u2019. He wore a military-style uniform, and on top of the dozen or so daggers strapped across his waist, there was a black sniper rifle across his back.\u201cThis\u2026 this mission\u2026 seems to be very important,\u201d stammered Li Yao, a 1.7 meters tall man who looked extremely young. He was the hacker of this three man cell, and carried a bag filled with the team\u2019s tools. He was in the midst of hacking the door. It didn\u2019t take him too long.The trio exchanged glances before entering.Li Ya Lin led the front while Lambert took the rear. They hacked through numerous high tech gates effortlessly as they made their way to the server room.The Germinal Organization was very careful with its information. Once a base was compromised, they would cut off its access to their network, delete all traces of data, and activate an EMP blast to destroy the hardware. Hence, they had always remained elusive to the Six Nations \u2013 until Han Xiao arrived.The trio swiftly arrived at Bas.e.m.e.nt 2, where the server room was located. Suddenly, Lin Yao, who was monitoring the hacked feed, began to exclaim, \u201cThere are guards approaching from behind the\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish his sentence, a team of guards appeared in their sights!Li Ya Lin was the quickest to react. She burst forward so quickly that the guards weren\u2019t even able to draw their guns in time. Leaping gracefully into the air, Lin Ya Lin performed a mid-air split to kick the front two guards in their heads, snapping their necks instantly.Her power was just as impressive as her flexibility.She landed on her hands and used them as a pivot to spin her entire body. Her legs began to glow yellow as she extended them while spinning, easily sweeping through the crowd of guards.\u201cPugilist!\u201dThe last remaining guard was about to call for reinforcements when a streak of silver flashed across the corridor. A dagger pierced his throat, ending his life.Lin Ya Lin and Lambert had effortlessly eliminated the fully-equipped squad of guards.Suddenly, the lights in the corridor turned red as sirens began to wail.\u201cWe\u2019ve been discovered! There is a large number of guards heading towards us. The base is being locked down!\u201d exclaimed Lin Yao.\u201cHurry up and hack the server room\u2019s doors!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m already on it! I need at least three minutes, but the guards will arrive in less than a minute! I can\u2019t bypa.s.s the firewall in such a short time. Sor-sorry\u2026\u201d replied a profusely sweating Lin Yao as he frantically typed away at an unbelievable speed.Very soon, they could hear the sound of footsteps coming from both ends of the corridor. There was no place to hide in the corridor. Although Li Ya Lin and Lambert were confident of killing their way out, the mission seemed like a lost cause.\u201cOh right! Didn\u2019t they give us some new equipment\u203d\u201d recalled Li Ya Lin suddenly. She hastily retrieved a long black case from Lin Yao\u2019s bag and opened it to reveal a metallic mechanical arm.The Lightweight Mechanical Arm!\u201cHow is this thing supposed to be used? Did you guys read the manual?\u201d\u201cSlide your left arm through it and activate it with your thumb!\u201d replied Lin Yao hastily. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it will explode though\u2026 I mean, it is the research department\u2026\u201dIt was well known throughout Division 13 that anything the research department produced was risky to use.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a choice!\u201d Li Ya Lin gritted her teeth as she slid her hand into the mechanical arm.The mechanical arm started to whirl!\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d she rejoiced, a look of amazement on her face.She smashed the mechanical arm into the steel door and discovered to her surprise that it had caused a huge dent, so she continued to throw punches at it.Twenty seconds later, right as the guards arrived, the door was blasted open.The trio hurriedly entered the room.\u201cThat was close.\u201dLi Yao immediately got to work. Digital lockdown was 57% complete. If he were fast enough, he would not only be able to make a backup of the base\u2019s data, but also use its access to hack directly into Germinal Organization\u2019s vaults.With the room acting as a fort, Lin Ya Lin and Lambert were able to put their fearsome combat abilities to full use.Li Yan Lin glowed with a yellow aura as she swiftly and gracefully dispatched of the invading guards with a metal baton on top of the Lightweight Mechanical Arm. Her blows were so powerful that they shattered the guards\u2019 bones through their bullet-proof armor.Meanwhile, Lambert was throwing his daggers out from inside the room. They rebounded to find their marks with frightening accuracy.The pair was causing a ma.s.sive number of casualties. Although the guards numbered over a hundred, they were unable to do anything.Suddenly, the network access and power supply were cut off, and the whole place turned dark.\u201cCharge out!\u201d yelled Li Ya Lin.Lambert and Lin Yao followed closely as they battled their way out.Screams filled the base.When they finally escaped, Lin Yao collapsed feebly to the ground, still shaking in fear. Li Ya Lin and Lambert seemed accustomed to the sight.Li Ya Lin fiddled around with the Lightweight Mechanic Arm. She had grown fond of it.\u201cI wonder who invented this mechanical arm. Could it be that Luo Xuan?\u201d she wondered aloud.\u201cWho knows, but I did hear that he is slated to join covert-ops. It\u2019s possible,\u201d conjectured Lin Yao as Li Yan Lin gazed lovingly upon it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The top bra.s.s in Division 13 were pleased, and it wouldn\u2019t have been possible without Han Xiao\u2019s intel.However, Han Xiao\u2019s past and the Blackstar issue remained a mystery as the information that Lin Yao had collected naturally had no mention of them\u2014the Blackstar message log was fabricated, while the Valkyrie experiments were top secret.Back at headquarters, Li Ya Lin reluctantly returned the Lightweight Mechanical Arm.\u201cWas the mechanical arm useful?\u201d her superior asked.Li Ya Lin nodded.\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to it that our mission was a success. Who created it?\u201d\u201cThat, I can\u2019t tell you.\u201dYa Lin\u2019s eyes sparkled.\u201cThat will depend on the higher-ups.\u201dLi Ya Lin gave up with hara.s.sing her tight-lipped superior and headed to the logistics department to look for Luo Xuan.The covert-ops insignia on her chest ensured her smooth pa.s.sage, ignoring the ongoing commotion caused by her very presence.Although all the departments in Division 13 were equal in status, the covert-ops department was full of beautiful wom\u2014cough\u2014elite agents, so they were looked up to by all the other departments.Li Ya Lin suddenly turned around to the crowd following her and loudly declared, \u201cI\u2019m looking for Luo Xuan.\u201dEveryone looked towards Luo Xuan enviously, singling him out.Is secret-ops here to recruit me? he wondered.Suppressing his excitement, he answered, \u201cI am Luo Xuan. How should I address you?\u201d\u201cLi Ya Lin.\u201d\u201cWhat can I help you with?\u201d asked Luo Xuan.\u201cAre you the one who invented that mechanical arm?\u201dMechanical arm? Luo Xuan immediately thought of the Lightweight Mechanical Arm that had caused him to lose face.Could it have malfunctioned? Luo Xuan celebrated inwardly.\u201cWas there some kind of problem?\u201d he asked with a straight face.\u201cNothing like that. I just found it very useful. I want to make a personal order.\u201dLuo Xuan froze in embarra.s.sment as snickers broke out in the crowd\u2014he had been ranting loudly about how worthless he thought the mechanical arm was to the whole department.\u201cI didn\u2019t invent it,\u201d he replied with a forced smile.\u201cThen say so earlier! What a waste of my time.\u201dLuo Xuan\u2019s face darkened.Suddenly, Feng Jun, who had been pa.s.sing by, came over and said, \u201cThe inventor\u2019s ident.i.ty is top secret. Please refrain from guessing or discussing it.\u201dLi Yan Lin was startled. Top secret?As the crowd dispersed, all Luo Xuan could think about was the threat that this mysterious mechanic posed to him.\u201cI will not let him have a good time if he joins the logistics department!\u201d\u2026Elsewhere in a secret facility.\u201cBoss, base 45 has been destroyed.\u201d\u201cBy whom?\u201d\u201cStardragon.\u201d\u201cHow did they learn of our base\u203d\u201d\u201cNot sure.\u201dThe Germinal Organization\u2019s bases were scattered all across the globe. However, only a few of them were situated within the territory of the six nations, and those key bases virtually hibernated all year round to prevent detection!\u201cHow could they have discovered our base? Is there a spy amongst us?\u201dOnly a handful of higher-ups in the organization knew the locations of their secret bases. It would be devastating if any of them turned traitor.The boss decided that he would have to conduct a purge.Of course, Han Xiao did come to his mind. However, he ruled him out as it didn\u2019t seem possible for Han Xiao to have accessed top secret information as a lowly test subject.Still, the thought of Han Xiao caused his blood to boil. It had been a while since the bounty was issued, yet there was still no news of him.\u201cYou sure can run fast, but I\u2019ll squash you sooner or later. Enjoy your remaining days while you can.\u201dThe boss laughed coldly.\u2026\u201cHan Xiao has been missing for three days now. Where did he go?\u201dLu Qian was anxiously pacing up and down.\u201cDid he lose his way? It\u2019s all my fault! I should have gotten him a mobile phone. You said he\u2019s a foreigner, right? He doesn\u2019t even know this place well! What should I do!\u201d\u201cBe optimistic. Maybe he just died,\u201d consoled Old Man Lu.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cGrandpa! Why are you so biased against him?\u201dOld Man Lu continued picking his nose leisurely.An idea crossed Lu Qian\u2019s mind.\u201cGrandpa! Help me ask someone to look for him!\u201d she pleaded.\u201cYou wish,\u201d snorted her grandpa. \u201cHa! When you stole my books, did you remember that I am your grandpa?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not important at all! I\u2019m sorry. Forgive me?\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201d\u201cYou really won\u2019t help?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t help!\u201dSuddenly, Lu Qian smiled shrewdly.\u201cThen I\u2019ll help you sell all the fine wine that you\u2019ve been hiding underneath the floor in your bedroom!\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? Is your grandpa such a petty person? You just want to find him, right? I\u2019ll do it, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Old Man Lu instantly changed his tune.\u201cThank you, grandpa,\u201d replied Lu Qian with the widest smile.Old Man Lu sighed. He proceeded to make a phone call to the tall, old man.\u201cOi, old man, was Han Xiao taken away by you guys?\u201d\u201c\u2026You guessed?\u201d\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything; we just want to work with him.\u201d\u201cIf he didn\u2019t do anything, then let him go right now, or else my granddaughter is going to ruin my wine collection!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t. It\u2019s against the rules.\u201d\u201cCut the bulls.h.i.+t! You are the one who sets the rules. You still owe me one for the last time, remember? I don\u2019t care! Just release Han Xiao now!\u201dThe tall, old man rolled his eyes in exasperation.\u201cAlright, alright. I got it.\u201dOld Man Lu unhappily put the phone down.\u201cWhy do I have to help that b.u.g.g.e.r?\u201d he sighed, reminded of his own past.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He didn\u2019t seem the least bit worried about his situation; instead, he was more concerned with getting stronger.He was currently consulting the interface. Having acc.u.mulated a total of 90,000 experience recently, he decided to level Basic Combat (Lv. 8) to Lv. 9 before redeeming the Skill Level-up Card.A glowing bronze card appeared in Han Xiao\u2019s hand. With a thought, it dissipated into countless light particles that entered his forehead.Han Xiao shuddered as a surge of energy welled up from within.

[High-Explosive Gunpowder] was one of the better discoveries possible. Not only were its applications manifold, it was not hard to craft at all with the required knowledge. It had been one of the most traded goods back in the game.The [Foldable Machete], on the other hand, was a disappointing discovery. As its name suggested, it was simply a machete with a foldable blade. It was clearly a weapon for beginners, and Han Xiao could have easily come up with something like this even without the blueprint!If only I had discovered some long-range weapon instead of this\u2026 At least I got something decent.Nevertheless, as it was something new to Aquamarine, it was not completely worthless. Just because all Mechanics learnt the same knowledge did not mean that they would create the same things. Before Han Xiao had transmigrated, tons of discoveries and inventions were still being made on a regular basis. Granted, not all of them were practical, but they at least gave rise to possibilities.Han Xiao would have to make do and work with these two blueprints. During his time in the Germinal Organization, he had managed to acc.u.mulate 60,000 experience. He would definitely be able to earn much more here in Stardragon after joining Division 13.Suddenly, the interface lit up._____________________Cla.s.s-A Mission: [Fall of the Germinal]Progress Rate: 1.6%\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afLooks like Division 13 has made their move!Han Xiao was surprised by the number. Logically speaking\u2014with how ma.s.sive and powerful the Germinal Organization was\u2014even destroying one of their bases shouldn\u2019t have that much of an impact on them as a whole.In the game, the war between the Germinal Organization and the Six Nations had mostly been a back and forth, with neither side being able to hold a clear advantage. There was, however, a point of time in which the Six Nations were able to corner the Germinal Organization, and victory seemed all but a.s.sured. Yet, they were unable to end the war as the Germinal Organization had a trump card up its sleeve: Protocol Doomsday.Hence, completing the mission would be impossible\u2026 unless Han Xiao could somehow shut the protocol down.The doomsday protocol was a last resort, and although it saved the organization from destruction, many Germinal members were disillusioned and swayed as a result. Most of the people who join the Germinal Organization are people who hold a grudge against the Six Nations, and believe in the promise of a new government. However, none of them would truly want to see the world burn. If I could expose the truth\u2026Han Xiao shook his head. It was way too early for him to be thinking of such things.\u2026A few moments later, Feng Jun finally returned. He brought Han Xiao back to the interrogation room where the intelligence minister came to talk with him again.\u201cThe locations of the bases have been confirmed. We believe in your sincerity now. The higher-ups have decided to make you a member of Division 13!\u201dI did it! Inwardly, Han Xiao sighed in relief.Looks like getting on good terms with the tall oldie has paid off, he thought to himself. He knew that the tall old man definitely had a hand in this.\u201c\u2026And the department has decided that you will join covert-ops. You will be a.s.signed to a squad.\u201dWhat\u203d Han Xiao\u2019s expression spoke of his grievances.The dawn of the new era had seen the loss of countless lives, resulting in a lack of manpower and talent. While this resulted in the Six Nations having to loosen their recruitment criteria across the board, the covert-ops department could never be compromised!This definitely has to be the tall old man\u2019s doing! thought Han Xiao. Does he like me that much?Of course, being able to join covert-ops was a good thing. Not only would Han Xiao be able to get to know stronger, more influential people, he would also be able to directly partake in key events that would occur in Stardragon!The interface lit up._____________________You have unlocked reputation with a new faction!Your reputation with Stardragon Strategic Defense Division has increased by 300!Stardragon Strategic Defense Division (Division 13): Neutral (300/1000) \u2013 Level 1 Clearance\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afThere were 8 levels of reputation: Hated, Hostile, Opposed, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Honored, and Revered.300 Reputation was \u2018Netural\u2019. Most factions required a \u2018Friendly\u2019 reputation to access contribution benefits.Feng Jun pa.s.sed a black mobile phone to Han Xiao as he coughed, saying, \u201cFrom today onwards, I will be your liaison. Never turn this off.\u201d\u201cOh, okay. It\u2019s not actually important, right?\u201d remarked Han Xiao aloofly.\u201cWhy are you always so unpleasant to talk to\u203d\u201dIt was a plain looking phone with a plain looking interface, and was only capable of making calls and sending messages. Han Xiao played with the phone in his hands as he asked, \u201cIt\u2019s secure, right?\u201d\u201cRest a.s.sured. It\u2019s encrypted.\u201cOne more thing,\u201d interjected the intelligence minister. \u201cI hope that you can give us your machinery blueprints, including the ones for the Lightweight Mechanical Arm and that rover you used.\u201dAlthough giving them the blueprints would earn him contribution points, it would also result in him losing monopoly over them. Division 13 would definitely ma.s.s produce them.Han Xiao shook his head in refusal, and the minister simply shrugged.At the end of the day, what they truly valued was the intel that Han Xiao possessed. If he was unwilling to give them the blueprints, then so be it.\u201cOh right. What if an agent makes a private order with me?\u201d he asked.\u201cWe have no rules against that,\u201d answered the minister, to Han Xiao\u2019s delight.Feng Jun proceeded to pull a black bag over Han Xiao\u2019s head once more.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When the car began to speed off, Han Xiao removed the black bag to find himself a few streets away from the workshop.When he looked up, he could see several glistening moons in the night sky.\u201cTsk. Why all the secrecy?\u201d he muttered to himself.Nevertheless, Han Xiao was feeling quite pleased for having accomplished his goal. He hummed merrily as he made his way back to the workshop. It was only when he reached the entrance that it dawned on him that going missing for 3 days would be hard to explain.Han Xiao stepped inside the workshop to see an anxious Lu Qian pacing back and forth.For some reason, she became enraged at the sight of him.\u201cWhy did you only come back now\u203d Do you know how worried I\u2019ve been? You\u2019re a foreigner! I thought something might have happened to you!\u201dHan Xiao put on his \u2018huh, did something happen?\u2019 expression and stared at her blankly.\u201cWhat exactly were you doing?\u201d\u201cTaking a stroll.\u201d\u201cCan you at least try to come up with a better excuse\u203d\u201d\u201cI thought\u2026 it\u2019s quite a good excuse?\u201d\u201cA gunfight at the junkyard was reported on the news yesterday. I thought you got caught in it or something and\u2026\u201d Lu Qian began nagging.Being nagged at did not irritate Han Xiao at all; on the contrary, it gave him a warm and fuzzy feeling.However, Old Man Lu appeared to ruin the moment.\u201cYou came back alive? How disappointing.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll get you a mobile phone over the next few days. The cost will be deducted from your salary,\u201d said Lu Qian.\u201cThere\u2019s no need. I already have one,\u201d replied Han Xiao as he whipped the black mobile phone out.Although they had told him not to share the number with anyone else, screw Division 13!When he saw the black phone, Old Man Lu gave a start. He pulled Han Xiao away to a corner.\u201cThis is a Division 13 phone. You joined Division 13?\u201d\u201cSo you know what this is.\u201d\u201cHmph. Since you\u2019ve joined Division 13\u2026 get the h.e.l.l out of my workshop!\u201d\u201cYou can leave if you want to; I\u2019m not leaving.\u201d\u201cHow dare you talk to me like that\u203d Why would you even want to-\u201dOld Man Lu suddenly paused.\u201cAre you\u2026 trying to woo my granddaughter?\u201d He glowered.\u201cNo!\u201d Han Xiao hastily answered.Suddenly, however, Old Man Lu\u2019s expression grew strange.\u201cHey Little Han, now that I think about it\u2026 my granddaughter is not that young anymore. What do you think about her?\u201dHan Xiao immediately stiffened up.\u201cOld Lu, as the saying goes, a stolen melon is not sweet!\u201d\u201cBut at least you would have a melon! Besides, we need a boy to carry on the family name.\u201dWe\u203d Don\u2019t drag me into your family tree!\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHeh heh. Strike while the iron is hot! There is only so much I can help you with,\u201d he added while patting Han Xiao on the shoulder before heading upstairs, leaving Han Xiao utterly bewildered.Old people who want descendants are scary!Han Xiao turned around, and to his horror, Lu Qian had been standing behind him the entire time. She stared at Han Xiao with big, bright eyes that seemed to be on the verge of tears.\u201cThis is a misunderstanding!\u201d\u201cJ-jerk!\u201d Lu Qian covered her blus.h.i.+ng face and ran upstairs.\u201cIt\u2019s not like that\u2026\u201d\u2026For Luo Xuan, the next few days were restless ones. He was afraid that Han Xiao would join the logistics department and steal the limelight from him.When it finally got to his head, he went to find a director to ask about Han Xiao.\u201cHis information is cla.s.sified,\u201d the big-bellied logistics director, who always wore a smile on his face, said when he asked. \u201cAll I can tell you is that he\u2019s joined Division 13.\u201dLuo Xuan\u2019s heart sank when he heard the news.\u201cWill he join logistics, or research?\u201dThe director shook his head.\u201cNeither. He\u2019s joined covert-ops. He\u2019ll start in a few days.\u201dThe news stunned Luo Xuan.How could some unknown guy who popped out of nowhere be directly recruited into secret ops? I\u2019ve worked my a.s.s for so many years, yet I\u2019m still in research?This is unfair!\u2026One week after the junkyard incident, the underworld bosses of the six other districts gathered together to discuss an important issue, the disappearance of Racc.o.o.n.Through piecing together bits of the puzzle, they were able to uncover that Division 13 had a hand in it, and this shocked all of them.What exactly did Racc.o.o.n do to incur the wrath of the mighty lion?\u201cRacc.o.o.n must have offended Division 13 somehow. He is probably dead already,\u201d declared the boss of District 2, who had initiated the meeting.All of the bosses present had grave expressions. Although they usually acted high and mighty in front of their subordinates, they all knew that Division 13 could easily wipe any one of them out. They were really just small-time hoodlums.After all, the Western Capital was the seat of the government, and they were just sewer rats hiding around. In fact, they could not even be compared to the intelligence and firearms brokers in the slums! At least those people had powerful backers.\u201cWho wants to take over District 7?\u201d asked the District 2 boss.Everyone remained silent.\u201cNo one?\u201dAlthough the bosses usually fought amongst one another for territory, none of them dared to take over District 7 without understanding why Division 13 had taken action.\u201cFine, then we will leave it open to new blood.\u201dNow that Racc.o.o.n was removed from the picture, there would definitely be ambitious people in his gang rising up to seize power. Of course, it was not that they were willing to let a new rival emerge. Instead, as the situation in District 7 was still unclear, they were just waiting to see what would happen. It would not be too late to get rid of the new boss as soon as everything stabilized.\u2026Han Xiao\u2019s life in the workshop returned to normal. After a few days, he asked for an advance of his first month\u2019s pay to order some materials from Division 13.At present, he was examining a dark red bullet lying on his palm.

They would explode immediately upon coming into contact with air, and the bullet itself would also be consumed in the explosion, leaving nothing behind.The method to craft the incendiary agents was described in detail in the blueprint, and although Han Xiao was not able to understand it well, as he had not learnt [Basic Chemistry] yet, he was still able to craft it by following the instructions.From handgun bullets to sniper bullets, over the next few days, Han Xiao crafted dozens of high-explosive bullets.He also used some good quality metal to craft a 2.5kg, 0.65m Foldable Knife with 13-19 Damage. It was an entirely black knife with a triangular-tipped edge, and while it was not really ideal for combat, it did have some practical uses.Han Xiao used the experience he gained from crafting the high-explosives and the foldable knife to raise [Machinery Affinity (Novice)] to Lv. 4.[Machinery Affinity (Novice)] had a level cap of 5, which would take Han Xiao 15,000 experience. His [Basic Shooting] was now Lv. 8, and that would take another 45,000 experience to level up. In all, Han Xiao just needed 60,000 more experience to gain 2 more talent points.Each of the Six Nations possessed different types of advanced knowledge that they used to entice powerful people to work for them. On Planet Aquamarine, there was only advanced knowledge for three of the five main cla.s.ses: Pugilist, Mechanic, and Esper.While no beginner planet possessed advanced knowledge of all 5 main cla.s.ses, newcomers were always sent to planets based on their inputted preferences.While Division 13 possessed advanced Mechanic knowledge, it was only accessible to \u2018revered\u2019 allies.There was still a long way to go before Han Xiao became revered with Division 13.Ever since the night that Han Xiao returned to the workshop, Lu Qian had not once looked at him directly in the eye, and would blush and run away from him after just a few sentences, making Han Xiao feel extremely irked. It did not help that Old Man Lu would pop up from time to time to give him knowing looks.As for Lu Qian herself, she actually had mixed feelings about Han Xiao.Of course, she did not hate Han Xiao. However, it was not like she liked him either.Instead, she was more worried that Han Xiao would pack up and leave if she rejected him. After all, where else would she able to find such a good (cheap) employee?Suddenly, Han Xiao\u2019s mobile phone lit up.The message read: \u2018The paperwork has been completed. Report today. \u2013 Feng Jun.\u2019\u201cFinally.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The inside of the tower was like a maze. Han Xiao followed Feng Jun through pa.s.sageways and tunnels for half an hour before finally reaching the HQ. This time, he wasn\u2019t blindfolded.\u201cThis place is so d.a.m.n hard to access,\u201d complained Han Xiao.\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s safe,\u201d replied Feng Jun as he swiped his security pa.s.s over the sensor to unlock the giant automatic gate.Han Xiao stepped through the gate into an extremely s.p.a.cious hall bustling with people. To his surprise, despite being underground, Division 13 HQ was both well-lit and well-ventilated.Feng Jun handed Han Xiao his security pa.s.s and a mouth mask.\u201cIt\u2019s better not to reveal your face to too many people. Wear this.\u201dHan Xiao was about to put it on when he noticed that there was a picture of a naked bodybuilder printed on it. He frowned and turned to see Feng Jun stifling his laughter.\u201cWhy are you looking at me? Put it on quickly!\u201d\u201cHmph.\u201dHan Xiao suddenly yanked Feng Jun\u2019s arm to rip out a piece of fabric from his sleeve.\u201cThis thing suits you better,\u201d he casually said as he tied it over his face and threw the custom mask back at him.Feng Jun almost broke out into tears.\u201cThis is my newly issued uniform\u2026\u201dSuddenly, Han Xiao felt someone watching him. He looked around to find an unfamiliar young man wearing a white coat glaring at him hatefully.\u201cWhat\u2019s he so angry about?\u201d asked Han Xiao, bewildered.Feng Jun laughed bitterly.\u201cHe\u2026 just ignore him.\u201dLuo Xuan had never seen Han Xiao\u2019s face before, but he knew for certain that the person beside Feng Jun was him.\u2026The covert-ops department had a single floor all to themselves. It was noticeably less crowded than the other departments.Feng Jun brought Han Xiao to a meeting room before leaving.Han Xiao stepped through the door to see that there were already three people seated inside. They were none other than Li Ya Lin, Lambert, and Li Yao.\u201cYou\u2019re the logistics guy that the director gave special permission to join our team?\u201dLi Ya Lin rose up to circle around Han Xiao as she examined him.Han Xiao raised an eyebrow. Special permission? Logistics guy? Suddenly, he noticed that the woman who had spoken to him was not only slender and perky, but extremely pretty. In Han Xiao\u2019s books, she was easily up there with Hila. She was wearing a yellow sports-style jacket on top of black tights.\u201cI am Han Xiao, a mechanic.\u201dLi Yao abruptly stood up, knocking his chair down in the process.\u201cNi-ni-nice to meet you. I am Li Yao, the team\u2019s hacker,\u201d he introduced, stretching out a hand.\u201cI am the sniper, Lambert,\u201d introduced Lambert plainly without getting up.Han Xiao shook Li Yao\u2019s hand and casually acknowledged Lambert with a nod. He was obviously the silent type.\u201cHey, why are you wearing a mask?\u201d asked Li Ya Lin with big, bright, curious eyes as she reached out to pull Han Xiao\u2019s mask off.Han Xiao dodged.\u201cWhy are you hiding your face! Don\u2019t you trust us?\u201d Li Ya Lin questioned unhappily.\u201cMy ident.i.ty is top-secret,\u201d Han Xiao replied.Although being a.s.signed to this team would have to mean that these people were trustworthy, Han Xiao still felt that not revealing his face would save him some trouble. He could imagine the questions they would have for him after learning of his face\u2026\u201cAren\u2019t you that wanted fugitive?\u201d\u201cWhy would Division 13 want you?\u201d\u201cWhat did you do to the Germinal Organization?\u201dAnswering all those questions would be a real headache.Besides, Han Xiao did not plan to stay in Division 13 for too long.\u201cYour ident.i.ty is top-secret? Hold on\u2026\u201d Li Ya Lin seemed to recall something, and she jumped in front of Han Xiao, asking, \u201cWere you the one who made the Lightweight Mechanical Arm?\u201dHan Xiao gave a start.\u201cHow do you know\u203d\u201d\u201cHa ha! So it\u2019s you!\u201d Li Ya Lin jumped about excitedly before slinging an arm over Han Xiao\u2019s shoulder. \u201cMake another one for me!\u201dHan Xiao\u2019s mouth twitched.\u201cIt won\u2019t be free.\u201dLi Ya Lin laughed loudly before asking softly, \u201cCan I have a discount?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cYou miser!\u201d\u201cI still don\u2019t know your name.\u201d This overly friendly pretty lady was giving him quite a headache.\u201cLi Ya Lin, in charge of close combat,\u201d she reluctantly answered.\u201cSo the four of us are a team?\u201d\u201cNo, there\u2019s still our leader.\u201d\u201cWhere is he?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not here. He\u2019s recovering from an injury.\u201d\u201cEven the leader gets injured. Covert-ops must be some dangerous work,\u201d remarked Han Xiao.The trio exchanged awkward glances.\u201cThe leader is sick from food poisoning,\u201d explained Li Yao.\u201c\u2026\u201dHan Xiao was speechless.Li Yao coughed dryly.\u201cThe covert-ops department takes on special high difficulty missions. Each team contains 4-7 people, and other than completing the missions a.s.signed to us each month, we are basically free to do whatever we want in our free time,\u201d he began to explain.\u201cCovert-ops personnel are the cream of the crop. Some of us, like Uncle Lambert, are recruited from other organizations. He was recruited in from a special forces squad. Your designation is field support. You will be in charge of equipment, scheduling, and, during operations, gathering and organizing intel. You\u2019ll be our eyes and ears from now on.\u201dThat\u2019s nice and all\u2026 thought Han Xiao, but I want to hunt monsters!Nevertheless, he could understand why Division 13 arranged things like this \u2013 they would rather not put a valuable a.s.set like him in the face of danger.Well, at the end of the day, Han Xiao not only gained their protection, but also a platform to make some money, so he was satisfied.Mechanics were really too weak early on compared to pugilists or espers, so crafting was much more efficient for them to earn experience.\u201cDoes our team have a name?\u201d asked Han Xiao.\u201cTeam name? What use would that have?\u201d replied a still displeased Li Ya Lin.\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026\u201d muttered Han Xiao.Suddenly, Li Yao interrupted, \u201cWe were just issued a mission to take in Black Spider. Apparently, he\u2019s still hiding here in the Western Capital.\u201dHan Xiao raised an eyebrow. The timing of the mission was too sudden. It was probably deliberately a.s.signed by the higher-ups.\u201cBlack Spider?\u201d Li Ya Lin wondered aloud. \u201cI know him. He\u2019s infamous for being a solo bounty hunter. The last time those field agents tried to bring him in he blew up two whole streets. Why would he still hide here in the capital?\u201d\u201cWhen will we depart?\u201d Lambert asked.\u201cThere\u2019s no rush. Since they\u2019ve already confirmed his location, let\u2019s just act at night.\u201d\u201cSince this is your first mission, just familiarize yourself with the logistics preparation.\u201dAlthough it was their first meeting, the trio did not inquire too much about Han Xiao\u2019s ident.i.ty. To be a.s.signed to covert-ops already meant that the higher-ups trusted him, and that was enough._____________________[You have triggered the Cla.s.s-E mission, [Black Spider].

    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39 - First Operation (Part 1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 39: First Operation (Part 1)Translator: MJ_ Editor: Millman97Black Spider? Isn\u2019t that a mini-boss? thought Han Xiao to himself.Black Spider was an Esper who was regarded as one of the \u2018Hardest Bosses to Kill in Version 1.0\u2019.Normally, a mini-boss quest at Han Xiao\u2019s current level would be at least Cla.s.s-D, and reward way more experience. However, in Galaxy, quests rewards were automatically adjusted according to character level and roles.Generally, in a party quest, players who contributed the most damage or healing would earn the most experience. It was a system that prevented experience leeching.I guess it\u2019s still better than nothing, Han Xiao consoled himself.From what Han Xiao knew about Black Spider, this mission would be a piece of cake for his team. However, the bonus reward was a different question. Han Xiao knew for sure that the condition for the bonus reward would be to take Black Spider in alive, but it could prove difficult to accomplish as Black Spider was in fact a superhuman, and his abilities made him much harder to catch than to defeat. As of now, only Han Xiao knew about the fact that he was a superhuman. In the game, it would only be revealed later on after launch.On the other hand, since Han Xiao had a complete understanding of the extent of Black Spider\u2019s abilities, it was still possible to catch him.\u201cHow much will you charge me?\u201d asked Li Ya Lin all of a sudden. She was clearly still hung up on the Lightweight Mecha Arm.\u201cOne Lightweight Mecha Arm will cost 20,000. 10,000 upfront, plus materials, and I\u2019ll make you one in two days.\u201dLi Ya Lin pouted. Although it was almost a month of her wage, she was still bent on having it.\u201cDo you have anything else for now?\u201dHan Xiao pondered for a moment before whipping out what seemed to be a 10 centimeter black knife handle without a blade.\u201cWhat\u2019s this for?\u201d asked Li Ya Lin uncertainly.Han Xiao chuckled and pressed a small switch on the handle. Instantly, a blade shot out from within it, transforming the stick into a 70 centimeter sharp knife.\u201cThis is a retractable knife.\u201dFor Li Ya Lin, it was love at first sight. The reason she favored her baton was due to its portability, and the retractable knife took it one step further. It was as concealable, yet stronger. Just as she was about to grab it out of Han Xiao\u2019s hands, Han Xiao dodged.\u201c1,000 for one,\u201d he stated with a straight face. In truth, it had only costed him 300 to make.\u201cYou stingy miser! Money-face!\u201d Li Ya Lin scolded as she forked out the money.As she started to play around with the knife, Lambert suddenly spoke.\u201cI want ten but shorter. Around 30 cm.\u201dHan Xiao was overjoyed.\u201cNo problem!\u201d\u201cI want them ready for tonight.\u201d\u201cAs long as I have the materials.\u201d\u201cI want one, too!\u201d Lin Yao exclaimed, to Han Xiao\u2019s surprise. For some reason, this beginner weapon was turning out to be quite the hot item.What Han Xiao did not know was that innovation was stifled in Division 13 \u2013 and it probably had something to do with the research department. Furthermore, the type of complex missions that secret-ops typically performed restricted their choice of equipment.Most agents\u2019 preferred weapon of choice for close combat was the dagger, so Han Xiao\u2019s retractable knife was quite a game changer. Imagine if, during a mission, your enemy whipped out his 10 cm dagger, and you whipped out your meter long knife.Longer is always more impressive.\u2026After acquiring the materials from Lambert and Li Yao, Han Xiao headed over to the private workshop at the logistics department to get the knives crafted.In one afternoon, Han Xiao earned 11,000 Aquamarine Dollars and even earned quite a bit of experience in the process: 8,000 in total.\u201cNot bad at all. Looks like Division 13 will be the goldmine that I expected it to be.\u201dAfter getting suited up, the trio departed for the city to hunt Black Spider. Han Xiao, though, stayed behind in the HQ to provide support, intel, and instructions.Li Ya Lin, Lambert, and Li Yao all had cameras and mics attached to them, and their feeds were directly wired to Han Xiao. He could clearly see whatever they were seeing, and in some sense, his job was to act as a director of sorts.Of course, as Han Xiao was new to the squad, he did not expect them to fully trust his judgement. Furthermore, it was an easy mission that all of them knew the higher-ups meant as a trial. While they did not object to Han Xiao playing captain, whether they would listen to him was another matter. They would still follow their own judgement no matter what, and Han Xiao fully knew this.Nonetheless, Han Xiao was not only quite experienced as a captain \u2013 having led 50 men raids back in Galaxy \u2013 he was basically omniscient, and this alone made him the best person for the job.\u2026Night had fallen.Three people arrived at the dirty, wet streets of District 8. As it was night, the streets were empty, and the streetlights flickered ominously.District 8 was vastly different from the other districts. The buildings here were shabby, and some did not even have proper roofs \u2013 instead, metal sheets and cloth could be seen covering the houses. Laundry was hanging up all over the place, and the streets were uncleaned and full of litter. This was a place that could hardly be called safe. Drug dealers and the like all thrived in this district, and it was to no one\u2019s surprise that Black Spider would hide here.The trio were fully equipped \u2013 even Li Yao. Although he was a hacker \u2013 and also a coward \u2013 he was still able to wield a gun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He should be on the third floor. We need to approach silently,\u201d said Li Ya Lin to Lambert and Li Yan.\u201cThere\u2019s no point in acting stealthy,\u201d interrupted Han Xiao through the intercom. \u201cBlack Spider has already discovered you all.\u201d\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Li Ya Lin frowned.Suddenly, gunfire pierced the silence of the night as a storm of bullets rained upon the trio. They immediately jumped into the nearest alley to seek cover.The trio exchanged serious looks as they leaned against the wall.Since when did he notice us\u203dWhile a simple ambush like that would never have been enough to do them in, they would not have been able to react so fast without Han Xiao\u2019s warning. Li Ya Lin put her game face on and clamped her earpiece tighter.There was a man standing on top of the tall building from where the shots had come from smiling frenziedly upon the trio\u2019s location with an a.s.sault rifle in his hands. On the left side of his face was a tattoo of a black spider. With a wave of his hand, ten masked men armed with guns suddenly jumped out of their hiding spots in the nearby streets and alleys to converge on the alley that the trio was in.\u201cOur intel was wrong! Wasn\u2019t he alone\u203d\u201d Lin Yao\u2019s eyes were wide with disbelief.Li Ya Lin\u2019s heart sunk.Black Spider began to laugh coldly.\u201cDid you think that I would continue staying here if I was not prepared? You guys got me good the other time, but now that you have all kindly offered yourselves up, I shall have my revenge!\u201dBlack Spider was widely known to be an independent bounty hunter, and his modus operandi was to set up traps before the battle even broke out. The trio were akin to prey stepping into a spider\u2019s web.Li Ya Lin suddenly turned to face the wall and, as her leg began to glow yellow, smashed it down with a powerful kick to obstruct the enemy\u2019s vision.Low level pugilists relied mainly on their abnormally huge power. Li Ya Lin was a Lv. 25 E-cla.s.s superhuman with over 300 ona.Black Spider and his agents suppressed the trio with overwhelming gunfire as they converged onto the alleyway.Li Ya Lin and Lambert dragged Lin Yao with them as they made use of their surroundings to evade the gunfire. While they were able to dodge all the bullets, they soon found themselves cornered in a dead end; Black Spider and his men had sealed off the alley.Black Spider closed his eyes and took a deep breath.\u201cMy insects, you must be trembling with fear now,\u201d he said frenziedly.\u201cDo you think you\u2019ve won?\u201d replied Li Ya Lin tauntingly as she shot a glance at Lambert.Black Spider turned around to face his men as he opened up his arms.\u201cI just need to say give the order and you will become minced meat in an instant. I do think I\u2019ve won, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cThen what are you waiting for?\u201d glowered Li Ya Lin.Black Spider waved a finger.\u201cKilling you all will do me no good. I\u2019ll ransom you for a tidy sum!\u201d he proudly declared, knowing full well that Division 13 could hear him through the trio\u2019s intercom.\u201cBut only one of you is enough!\u201d he suddenly broke out in maniacal laughter.Just as he was about to give the order to fire, Li Ya Lin jumped onto the wall, and, as her legs began to glow yellow, she sprung forward, soaring in the air like a graceful swallow to close in on Black Spider and his men.\u201cKill her!\u201d Black Spider frantically ordered. His men began to fire at Li Ya Lin, and while a few bullets managed to find their mark despite her being fast to the point of becoming a blur, they simply flattened into metal pancakes upon hitting her clothes.Not only was the fabric of Li Ya Lin\u2019s bodysuit weaved with bulletproof ceramic fiber, her own body itself was tough enough to deflect bullets. From the start, the trio had only been fleeing to bait in Black Spider and all of his men.As Li Ya Lin distracted them, Lambert whipped out two knives with each hand and threw them out, killing four men instantly.Li Ya Lin drew the sheathed retractable knife from her waist and slashed at the nearest agent. The agent threw his head back slightly, thinking that it would be enough to dodge, but, suddenly, a 10 cm blade extended out to rip his throat open.\u201cExcellent weapon!\u201d remarked Li Ya Lin with s.h.i.+ning eyes.What happens when a gunman comes into the range of a pugilist goes without saying. Thirty seconds later, there was blood splattered everywhere, and only Black Spider, with both hands chopped off, remained.Li Ya Lin exhaled as she sheathed the retractable knife. She clearly looked pleased with it.\u201cWell done,\u201d praised Han Xiao. He had chosen to remain silent during the fight so as not to bother them.\u201cThank\u2014 thank you,\u201d Li Yao stammered.\u201cNot you.\u201dLi Yao lowered his head in depression. He had truly not contributed anything at all during the fight.The heavily wounded Black Spider began to laugh hoa.r.s.ely as he glared at Li Ya Lin without a single trace of fear in his eyes.\u201cLittle brat, you guys can\u2019t kill me,\u201d he taunted.Suddenly, Lambert whipped out his gun to shoot Black Spider in the head. Blood splattered across the floor as Black Spider\u2019s body collapsed to the ground.Li Ya Lin and Li Yao turned to look at him speechlessly.\u201cCan\u2019t know until you try,\u201d he stated plainly.\u201cAy\u2026 whatever. They didn\u2019t tell us to take him in alive anyway,\u201d said Li Ya Lin as she lazily stretched her back. \u201cAh! I want to go back to take a shower! All of this blood is so smelly.\u201dSuddenly, however, Han Xiao spoke.\u201cDon\u2019t let your guard down. He\u2019s not dead yet.\u201dLi Ya Lin almost stumbled backwards in her stretch.\u201cHow can he be alive?\u201d she fumed as she pointed at what remained of Black Spider\u2019s head.\u201cHe is a superhuman with some tricky abilities. Unmask the corpse next to him. You will understand,\u201d replied Han Xiao calmly.\u201cBut there isn\u2019t any piece of news on the dark web that says Black Spider is a superhuman,\u201d hesitated Li Yao. \u201cYou might be mistaken.\u201d\u201cNot might, he is definitely mistaken,\u201d added a disgruntled Li Ya Lin. \u201cHey, newbie, I know you want to earn some credit, but don\u2019t make these kind of things up!\u201dHan Xiao was speechless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

To their alarm, the man did not have a face, or rather, he did not have any facial features.\u201cWhat\u2014 what is this\u203d\u201dLi Yao was horror-struck. They proceeded to unmask the remaining 9 men, and they were all faceless!Suddenly, a change occurred in the first man that Han Xiao had asked them to unmask. As the mark of a black spider slowly appeared on his face, facial features also began to form, and it soon became clear that it looked exactly like Black Spider\u2019s face. Next, the wounds on this person actually began to heal up, and after a while, this \u2018corpse\u2019s\u2019 eyelids began to move!\u201cBlow his brains up!\u201d Han Xiao instructed firmly.Lambert fired without hesitation.They proceeded to listen to Han Xiao and repeat the same procedure one by one on whichever faceless man the same signs next appeared on. Li Ya Lin and Li Yao were thoroughly shocked by what was happening, but they suppressed their doubts and carried out Han Xiao\u2019s instructions.Although they had no idea how Han Xiao knew of Black Spider\u2019s secret; he, without a doubt, knew his stuff.When there was only one faceless man left, Han Xiao stopped them.\u201cDon\u2019t kill him. Just cripple him.\u201dWhen the mark of the black spider and Black Spider\u2019s face formed completely on the faceless man, he opened his eyes in horror and shouted, \u201cHow do you all know my superpowers\u203d\u201dThe name of his ability was [Parasitic Copy].It allowed him to create a faceless copy out of himself after a certain period of time. The copy did not possess intelligence and could only operate and follow simple instructions within a fixed radius of himself.Each copy that Black Spider had was like an extra life, and he could reincarnate indefinitely as long as a copy still existed. In this manner, he was virtually immortal.While this ability did not have any direct offensive use, what it did was alter Black Spider\u2019s very life-form and free him from the restraints of flesh and blood, turning him into a force of consciousness that could reside in any of his copies.As long as a copy existed, he was invincible!It was his greatest secret, and one that he would never divulge to anyone.How could anyone have figured it out\u203dHan Xiao laughed at the sight of Black Spider\u2019s dumbfounded and horrified face on the feed. If it had been some other mini-boss, he might not have been able to recall their abilities, but Black Spider had been a headache for countless players in the game, so he left a lasting impression.At present, Black Spider had actually not even mastered his power, making it the perfect time to deal with him. Nonetheless, it was a superpower with extremely high potential. Who knows what someone who had mastered it would be capable of. Not even Han Xiao knew, as Black Spider had died early in the game as well\u2014not this early though, of course.How did he die?Black Spider\u2019s power might have been tricky to deal with, but there were still ways to deal with it. Since he had transcended flesh to become purely \u2018soul\u2019, one could simply damage his soul directly to cripple his wings. Still, superhumans with soul-damaging abilities were far and few in Galaxy, so most players remained incapable of killing him easily. This was why he was considered one of the \u2018Hardest Bosses to Kill\u201d in Version 1.0.And of course, Black Spider considered himself so as well\u2026 until he met Hila.Out of all the cla.s.ses, Espers were the ones who possessed all sorts of extraordinary abilities. Unlike the other four superhuman cla.s.ses, Espers only needed to consume gene awakening drugs instead of learning knowledge in order to unlock their abilities. Each character in Galaxy was given one chance to take the gene awakening drug, and if it failed, that character would never be able to switch cla.s.ses to become an Esper again.The success rate would depend on the type of gene awakening drug used, and as you might have guessed, this was indeed a pay-to-win feature.Even the lowest grade gene awakening drugs went for as high as 398 dollars, and the [Ultra-Perfect-Deluxe Gene Awakening Elixir], the awakening drug with the highest success rate, was worth well over 5,000 dollars despite it only having an 18% success rate without guarantees.It was truly a money spinner for the game\u2019s company.Previously, Han Xiao had also tried his hand at switching to an Esper. Unfortunately, the only result that he arrived at was that Esper players were all filthy rich.Black Spider quickly calmed down and threatened, \u201cI have unlimited copies. Even if you destroy this body, you won\u2019t be able to kill me! Mark my words! I will definitely hunt you down for the rest of your lives!\u201dLambert was about to raise his gun when Han Xiao hurriedly stopped him.\u201cFollow my instructions\u2026\u201dAs Li Ya Lin listened to Han Xiao, she suddenly began to act high and all-knowing as she replied to Black Spider, \u201cUnlimited copies? Stop trying to scare people. You can have at most have 50 bodies! Apart from the 10 here, the rest are scattered across the globe!\u201dBlack Spider\u2019s eyes grew wide with disbelief. Figuring out the nature of his powers was one thing, but to actually know such secret information? How was that possible\u203d Black Spider\u2019s mind was racing.Someone knows everything about my powers!Who? Who could it be?Could it be\u2026 an Esper who can read minds?Li Ya Lin continued, \u201cAs long as we don\u2019t kill this copy of you, we can lock you up for as long as we want!\u201dBlack Spider\u2019s face changed, and he immediately attempted to bite his own tongue off to avoid his impending fate. Unfortunately, Lambert was a step faster, and he managed to restrain him.Unable to even end his own life, Black Spider could only glare hatefully at Li Ya Lin.At this point in time, the trio had the same questions in their mind.Who exactly is Han Xiao?Why does Division 13 treat his ident.i.ty with such secrecy?How does he possess such secretive information?\u2026A cleanup crew soon arrived to put a straitjacket over Black Spider and take him back.At the same time, Han Xiao, who was relaxing in the faraway base, received a mission completion notification._____________________You have completed the E-Cla.s.s mission, \u2018Black Spider\u2019, earning 5,000 experience.You have fulfilled the secret condition: \u201cTake Black Spider in Alive\u201d, earning 40,000 experience or a Soul Stabilizer.\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afThe Soul Stabilizer had the effect of raising spiritual resistance, granting the user immunity to mental and spiritual attacks. It was a piece of equipment that was particularly useful against magic users.As there were no mages or psychics on Aquamarine, the Soul Stabilizer was not really of much use to Han Xiao for now, so he naturally selected the more practical reward of 40,000 experience.What about Hila, you ask? That would still be thinking too far ahead.Not bad at all. Han Xiao smiled to himself.\u2026The trio finally arrived back at the secret-ops HQ. Li Ya Lin rushed into the room and asked Han Xiao with wide, curious eyes, \u201cHow did you know that Black Spider was a superhuman?\u201dHan Xiao laughed enigmatically.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you for one million dollars,\u201d he offered, frustrating Li Ya Lin.\u201cWhatever. Oh right, what are we going to do about him?\u201dLi Yao shook his head.\u201cI heard that the higher-ups want to send him to Death\u2019s Door Island and lock him up forever.\u201dDeath\u2019s Door Island was a maximum security prison that the Six Nations established together. It was located in the middle of an ocean, making it impossible to escape from. Only those that the Six Nations deemed the most dangerous were sent there\u2014evil individuals, warlords of the Wanderers Army, and other important figureheads.Death\u2019s Door Island was so named as a sentence to the island was essentially a death sentence, except that it was worse\u2014death would actually be an escape.Han Xiao was pleased with the arrangement, as there was truly no other way to keep him from coming after them for revenge.At the end of the day, the team\u2019s first operation together was a perfect success, and after tidying up, everyone made their own way home.Han Xiao, too, was about to leave when, suddenly, Feng Jun came up to him with a worried look.\u201cInternal affairs wants to ask you a few questions.\u201d\u201cHaven\u2019t I proved my trustworthiness?\u201d asked Han Xiao.\u201cThe internal affairs department appealed for a second interrogation. As it is within reason for them to do so, the higher-ups did not object. As you know, your previous ident.i.ty is a sensitive topic.\u201d\u201cThe higher-ups are split in two on the matter of yourself,\u201d he added softly. \u201cWhile departments like intelligence and logistics think a friendly relations.h.i.+p is more beneficial, the hardliners led by internal affairs think otherwise.\u201dHan Xiao sighed. Where there is people there will be conflict.\u2026At internal affairs, Han Xiao had his height and weight taken again before being brought to an interrogation room, where a sole investigator awaited him.\u201cName.\u201d\u201cHan Xiao.\u201d\u201cGender.\u201d\u201cFemale.\u201dThe veins on the investigator\u2019s temple bulged.\u201cAge.\u201d\u201c30\u2026 no, I mean 31.\u201dBang!The investigator slammed the table.\u201cStop playing a fool!\u201d\u201cWhy ask all these pointless things? Can we just go straight to the point?\u201d\u201cContinue. Family relations.h.i.+ps,\u201d the investigator continued through gritted teeth.\u201cI\u2019m an orphan. No relatives.\u201d\u201cWhere were you born?\u201d\u201cMt. Buzhou.\u201d\u201cNonsense! We didn\u2019t find any record of your birth!\u201d\u201cGo ask your superior,\u201d Han Xiao replied plainly.Obviously, the higher-ups would not divulge Han Xiao\u2019s information to a normal member of staff. This interrogation was simply the internal affairs department\u2019s idea of giving him a warning.The investigator was being given instructions through his earpiece, and he suppressed his anger to proceed with the psychological a.s.sessment.The investigator gave Han Xiao a number of hypothetical scenarios for him to say what he would do in each of them. Han Xiao, however, was not cooperative and gave random answers.\u2026Finally, the interrogation ended.As the investigator sealed the compiled information in an envelope, he coldly told Han Xiao, \u201cThe internal affairs department is always watching you. Pray we don\u2019t find anything on you.\u201d\u201cSo you mean you currently have nothing, and can\u2019t take any action against me?\u201d taunted Han Xiao, before leaving the room in high spirits.The investigator\u2019s face instantly darkened, and his hands shook with fury as he clutched the envelope.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42 - The Research Department's GreedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 42: The Research Department\u2019s GreedTranslator: MJ_ Editor: Millman97On his way back to the workshop, Han Xiao thought about how to go about starting his business in Division 13.The first thing he would need to do was to get his name out there. Pulling out his phone, he made a call to Li Ya Lin to ask for her help. After some negotiation, she agreed to help him out on the condition of a lifetime 20% discount.However, there was still a problem\u2014the workshop was not well equipped for Han Xiao\u2019s plans, so he would not be able to carry out ma.s.s production. After thinking things through, he decided that he had no choice but to speak to Lu Qian directly.\u2026\u201cSister Qian, I have something to say.\u201dLu Qian s.h.i.+vered.\u2018It was unavoidable all along,\u2019 she thought to herself, \u2018but now I am mentally prepared!\u2019\u201cThere\u2019s something I want to tell you,\u201d continued Han Xiao. \u201cActually, I-\u201dSuddenly, Lu Qian turned to face him and bowed resolutely.\u201cS-sorry, but I have to reject you. Please don\u2019t get me wrong, you are a good person.\u201dThe atmosphere instantly stiffened.Han Xiao\u2019s eyelids twitched. Although he actually did not even have any intention of wooing her, being rejected in such a manner still left a bad taste in his mouth.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou misunderstand. I just want to refit the workshop and install an independent workroom for my own use. My friend has lent me the money. What do you think? It\u2019s like a small upgrade.\u201dLu Qian gave a start and started to blush. She felt like she was about to die from embarra.s.sment.\u201cOkay, fine. I agree,\u201d she replied before running upstairs.\u201cAhhhh! That was so embarra.s.sing!\u201dHan Xiao rolled his eyes. He suspected that she probably did not even hear him clearly.\u2026Han Xiao drew up a proposal for his upgrades and pa.s.sed it to Feng Jun to get it approved by the higher-ups.As Division 13 valued Han Xiao highly, and it was a perfectly reasonable request, it was immediately pa.s.sed, and construction workers soon arrived at the workshop.Two days later, there was now a new mini workshop right next to the main building. As Division 13 had fully paid for it, it would be more accurate to say that Han Xiao was borrowing it, and under his request, they had also built an underground s.p.a.ce for his convenience.Over the next few days, Han Xiao received many orders for the Retractable Knife.Although all of his clients were Division 13 agents, Han Xiao preferred not to meet with any of them directly just in case. He instead relied on Li Ya Lin to act as a middleman.The materials were sent directly to Han Xiao\u2019s workshop, and he crafted dozens of Retractable Knives over the next few days, earning him quite a lot of experience, some of which he used to raise Mechanic Affinity to the highest level, thereby gaining another talent point.Back in Division 13, word that Li Ya Lin\u2019s team had acquired a mechanic named Han Xiao\u2014and that he was open to private orders\u2014spread like wildfire.As a result, the amount of orders he received skyrocketed, and Han Xiao found himself barely able to meet the demand. Nonetheless, thanks to this, he was able to earn tons of experience each day.Unlike in his previous life, there were no compet.i.tors, so Han Xiao had the entire market to himself.Han Xiao only intended to take orders for both the Retractable Knife, and High-explosive Gunpowder, but he made an exception to craft a Lightweight Mecha Arm for Li Ya Lin.While the Retractable Knife was indeed selling like hot pancakes, Han Xiao knew that its popularity would soon fizzle out. After all, most people were only buying it for its novelty. Moreover, as its design wasn\u2019t really that complex at all, it wouldn\u2019t be strange for imitations and similar products to appear in the near future.As such, Han Xiao had planned all along to only use it to earn a quick buck. Comparatively, the [High-explosive Gunpowder] had more promising potential. Not only was it inexpensive, it was extremely useful, and being a consumable, clients would keep on returning for more.Furthermore, unlike the retractable knife, [High Explosive Gunpowder] would not be easily replicated\u2014as soon as the bullet cap was opened, the gunpowder would react with air to combust and leave no trace. It was essentially impossible to craft without the blueprints and manufacturing process for the planet\u2019s current technology.Han Xiao used the money he earned from the Retractable Knife each day to purchase large quant.i.ties of materials for making [High-explosive Gunpowder]. He only planned to push it out into the market after acc.u.mulating a stockpile.\u2026One day, when Old Lu and the tall old man were having one of their \u2018chess sessions\u2019, Han Xiao saw the tall old man and came up to him.\u201cIs the prosthetic good to use?\u201d he asked, smiling.\u201cNot bad,\u201d the tall old man laughed and rolled up his sleeve. The prosthetic arm had been fitted with a layer of artificial skin, making it seem extremely realistic.\u201cAs long as you like it. If it needs maintenance, feel free to come to me.\u201dThe tall old man nodded and asked, \u201cI heard from Old Lu that you joined Division 13?\u201d\u201cYes, I did.\u201d\u201cWhat a promising young lad. Do your best for the country,\u201d he applauded.Han Xiao smirked inwardly. The tall old man did not know that he knew who he was.Working for Division 13 was not a huge secret to keep. After all, the division had a front cover. Ordinary people had heard of a Division 13, but they simply knew it as a company.As they conversed, Han Xiao wondered when the tall old man would come clean with him and if he should act surprised when he did.Suddenly, Feng Jun entered the workshop in a hurry and said to Han Xiao with a grave expression, \u201cLet\u2019s go outside for a talk.\u201dAs Han Xiao\u2019s caretaker, Feng Jun always kept a small team around the compound to monitor the workshop, mainly to keep an eye out for any Germinal Organization operatives.As they stepped outside, the tall old man wondered what had happened.\u201cThe research department has their eyes on you!\u201dHan Xiao narrowed his eyes.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThe research department is tasked with inventing new weapons and equipment. They have the power to perform risk a.s.sessment on any equipment we use. Using the claim that your Retractable Knife is dangerous to use, they are demanding that you cough up the blueprints! As they have the right to do so, the other departments are unable to interfere.\u201d\u2018So they want my blueprints!\u2018Risk a.s.sessment? What a joke!\u2019Han Xiao snorted coldly. If he handed them the blueprints for the Retractable Knife, they would immediately begin ma.s.s production of it!Feng Jun proceeded to enlighten Han Xiao on the internal strife in Division 13. The research department and internal affairs were both on the side of the hardliners, and essentially hostile towards him.As the research department had not produced many results over the past few years, their budget was continuously slashed every year. In Division 13, their standing was even lower than that of the logistics department, which was why they were now targeting Han Xiao\u2019s blueprints. They were truly desperate.\u201cAnd what if I refuse?\u201d\u201cYou will be blacklisted by them, and it will reflect on your record. The good thing is that you are not an ordinary agent, and the Division values your intel highly, so it should not cause you many problems; after all, the research department can\u2019t really force you due to your position.\u201d\u201cThen that\u2019s fine. I won\u2019t give them the blueprints,\u201d said Han Xiao as he shook his head.Feng Jun laughed bitterly. He had come knowing that Han Xiao would most likely refuse.Although the Retractable Knife would end up being over-saturated in the market, it was still earning him a lot for the time being. Naturally, Han Xiao would not give it up.The tall old man made a phone call to someone in Division 13. When he learnt of what had transpired, his face darkened.\u201cA bunch of greedy imbeciles! All they do is stir up nonsense!\u201dThat Han Xiao was able to achieve an amicable relations.h.i.+p with Division 13 was something that the tall old man had played a huge role in. Now, however, there were people within the division itself who were clumsily undermining his efforts! What if Han Xiao became averse to the division and decided to pack up and leave\u203d Then, all of his thoughts and efforts would have been in vain.\u201cThe gall of them!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Don\u2019t say that kind of thing!\u201d\u201cWell, that seems like one way to solve things\u2026\u201d mumbled Li Ya Lin in deep thought, sending Li Yao to the verge of tears.Even if you guys don\u2019t want to live, I still want to live! he thought to himself.Although Han Xiao had only joined them a few days ago, after the Black Spider operation, the trio had fully accepted him as their comrade. Naturally, they were displeased to hear of his predicament.\u201cWhy not ask for his opinion directly?\u201d asked Li Yao.\u201cHis address is top secret, and his phone is always off!\u201d scowled Li Ya Lin. \u201cWho knows where he could be\u2026\u201d\u201cThen what should we do? How can we just watch him suffer at the hands of the research department?\u201d\u201cWait,\u201d Lambert abruptly interjected.Footsteps could be heard, and a few seconds later, a woman appeared at the door.\u201cHey, Lin Lin, I heard that your new teammate is quite the troublemaker.\u201dThe woman was short-haired, and a beauty in her own right. However, her voice was derisive, and she looked down on the trio antagonistically as she leaned against the door with folded arms.The woman\u2019s skin was extremely fair, and her lips were exceedingly red, as though the petals of a rose. She possessed a flirtatious temperament, and although she was tall, the strength of her aura did not seem to pale against Li Ya Lin\u2019s. Although Li Ya Lin was unquestionably prettier, the woman was, without a doubt, more of a head turner than her.Li Ya Lin\u2019s face immediately darkened at the sight of her.\u201cVixen Su,\u201d she growled through gritted teeth, \u201care you looking for a fight?\u201dDi Su Su giggled tauntingly.\u201cIf you dare.\u201dDi Su Su and Li Ya Lin were well known to be hated rivals. The bad blood between them could be traced all the way back to when they were fellow disciples of a dojo in their childhood. While Di Su Su always excelled in each of their tests and fights, Li Ya Lin\u2019s performance was always average, and she was always easily defeated by her.Even until this day, Li Ya Lin would sometimes be reminded of the way that she would put on a pretense in front of everyone and act nice to her despite them detesting each other. While everyone would praise Di Su Su and offer her guidance, Li Ya Lin\u2019s conversations with their master always end in a few sentences, and he would always just ask her to follow Di Su Su\u2019s example.Recalling those events always dampened Li Ya Lin\u2019s mood. Her master essentially treated her like an abandoned dog in the rain.The two would eventually both end up joining Division 13, but only for history to repeat itself. Di Su Su\u2019s always outperformed Li Ya Lin\u2019s team, and her team became the ace of secret ops. What Li Ya Lin hated most was how Di Su Su would frequently come over to mock her, and the way she called her \u2018Lin Lin\u2019!b.i.t.c.h! Since when were we close?Di Su Su was obviously doing it on purpose, and while Li Ya Lin knew this, it still got on her nerves.\u201cHehe,\u201d Di Su Su laughed softly. \u201cI heard that you guys have a new addition, so I came specially to look for him. Where is he? He can\u2019t have gone to hide, right?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not here,\u201d replied Li Ya Lin coldly. \u201cGet lost.\u201d\u201cLooks like I\u2019ve made a wasted trip, but I guess that\u2019s understandable, since he\u2019s busy being destroyed by the research department.\u201dLi Ya Lin stared at her.\u201cHurry up and get lost!\u201d\u201cHow heartless.\u201d Di Su Su pouted. \u201cWe\u2019re childhood sweethearts, after all.\u201dShe shot a look towards Li Yao before sauntering off.Li Ya Lin was already frustrated, but when she turned around to see Li Yao all intoxicated, her anger swelled. She stood up abruptly to grab Li Yao by his collar.\u201cIs this beautiful woman right beside you not enough\u203d\u201d she yelled. \u201cWhy are you looking at that vixen\u203d\u201d\u201cB-b-but,\u201d stammered Li Yao, 'she smiled at me\u2026\u201d\u201cYou had better give me a good answer: is she more beautiful or am I?\u201d she asked threateningly.For some reason, Li Yao still had to take a moment to think before he replied, \u201cI think\u2026 that Sister Su Su is gentler than you\u2026\u201d\u201cHumph, Li Yao! I think that your brain needs some adjustment!\u201cReverse-avalanche-bridge-breaking suplex!\u201dAs Lambert casually sipped on the cup of water in his hand, he picked his phone up to make a call.\u201cGet a doctor over here\u2014a bone specialist, preferably.\u201d\u2026The research department had expected Han Xiao to refuse their demands.To mechanics, blueprints were like their lifeline.They did not care about Han Xiao\u2019s personal gain, or rather, that was to be expected, as the hardliners were hostile to him from the very start. In their eyes, giving Han Xiao the chance to cooperate was a soft move, and he should have been locked up and controlled instead.On the other hand, the conservatives thought exactly the opposite. They were willing to give Han Xiao the benefit of the doubt as he seemed trustworthy and was cooperative. Why cause unrest and animosity over a simple beginner equipment blueprint?What if he wasn\u2019t scared of torture?Division 13 had tried all sorts of methods on captured Germinal members before, but torture seldom worked, and nine out of ten would give false intel that was harmful instead of beneficial.Besides, Han Xiao was a truly unique case.As such, the conservatives, too, were outraged at the pressure that the hardliners were trying to put on Han Xiao. They saw them as a bunch of outdated, old farts. Times had changed, and talent was in high demand\u2014Division 13 should have been treasuring him, not pressuring him.Weren\u2019t there other mechanics in the division too? Stealing Han Xiao\u2019s work would reflect poorly on the division.What year was it? All the talk about loyalty and what not would only serve to chase away prospects and talents seeking refuge. Don\u2019t forget that the Six Nations was the main culprit for the destruction of all the other countries! It would not be surprising if these foreign talents just up and rebelled!Unfortunately, as Division 13 was extremely compartmentalized, only the top bra.s.s would be able to interfere with the research department\u2019s actions, but they seemed to only be interested in continuing to observe for now.The research department was offering high amounts of cash to the agents for the Retractable Knives that they had bought from Han Xiao, which everyone saw through as a low move.As most of the agents did not know of Han Xiao\u2019s special status, most felt that it was unreasonable to bully an ordinary mechanic so, and they decided not to turn in the knives. Doing so would also be, in some sense, disrespectful to Han Xiao.However, there were still some who turned them in for the money.Korat was the first agent to strike a deal with the research department. He asked for 30,000 dollars\u2014thirty times more than the opening offer\u2014and the research department relented.His reasoning was simple\u2014it was simply worth the money. While most of the agents held on to their morals, he laughed at them for being fools to pa.s.s up the opportunity.It\u2019s just a small-time mechanic anyway, who even cares? Just wait till the research department ma.s.s produces it if you really want it.\u2026In the research department, Luo Xuan and the head secretary were examining the retractable knife.\u201cLuo Xuan, can you reproduce it?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This thing isn\u2019t even well made; plus, it\u2019s not encrypted.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll leave it to you. If you can figure out the blueprints, I\u2019ll pull you over into our department. Of course, your position will be higher.\u201dLuo Xuan\u2019s eyes lit up. Since his debacle over the mecha arm, he had started to feel that he did not have a future in logistics.If he could gain the favor of the higher-ups again, he would definitely be able to surpa.s.s that blasted Han Xiao!\u2026Back at the workshop, Han Xiao had moved into the new building for convenience sake.The arrangement brought Lu Qian some relief as things were still awkward between the pair.\u201cWhoosh.\u201dHot steam gushed out as Han Xiao, who was wearing a heat-resistant suit, opened the furnace lid. He proceeded to use a pair of iron tongs to pick up a piece of glowing hot metal from within.For now, there were two options available to Han Xiao for making the Retractable Knives\u2014molding or stamping.While both methods had their own advantages, the latter allowed for ma.s.s production with a higher success rate, so Han Xiao favored it.The selling point of the Retractable Knife was its concealability. Since practicality was more important than the quality of craftsmans.h.i.+p, Han Xiao did not bother to put much detail into making them.The metal sheets that he used for stamping were provided by Division 13, so they were top grade. Han Xiao had polished the metal sheet with a chemical spray before putting it into the furnace. After taking it out of the furnace, he set it under the stamping machine. Of course, he still had to carry out a few more steps before the knives were complete.Each Retractable Knife gave him 100-200 experience, and the level of the blueprint itself had been increased to Lv. 2, giving the final product a slightly higher quality.When he was done, Han Xiao stepped out of the heat-resistant suit and wiped the sweat off his brow. After examining the newly made knives, he proceeded to work on some workshop orders.Midway, Han Xiao\u2019s phone rang. He picked up his phone to see that it was Li Ya Lin.\u201cSomething bad has happened! All the agents want to cancel their orders!\u201d\u201cWhat happened\u203d\u201d Han Xiao was shocked by the news.\u201cThe research department has reverse-engineered the Retractable Knife, and they announced that they will proceed with ma.s.s production very soon and make it available to everyone!\u201dAlthough everyone could see how blatantly underhanded the research department was being, since they were going to be provided with free Retractable Knives, it was only natural for them to want to cancel their orders with Han Xiao.The Retractable Knife\u2019s profitability had run its course.Han Xiao sat in deep thought. He had not expected the research department to be so brazen. Although Han Xiao had already known that something like this would happen, he did not expect them to take action so fast.While giving up the blueprints voluntarily would earn him some faction reputation, he would not be able to earn any experience.In any case, they were putting a dent in Han Xiao plans to get stronger.Han Xiao picked up his phone to make a call to Feng Jun.\u201cI a.s.sume you\u2019ve heard?\u201d he asked in a low voice.Feng Jun sighed.\u201cThe research department is really too much. The higher-ups haven\u2019t even given them permission, and they\u2019ve already leaked that they will ma.s.s produce the Retractable Knife.\u201dHan Xiao frowned.\u201cFill me in on the details.\u201dFeng Jun proceeded to tell Han Xiao about Korat and Luo Xuan.\u201cHas the research department given an official statement?\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201dHan Xiao\u2019s face darkened. Looks like the research department did not even intend to give him an explanation.How the research department dared to act was one thing, but the higher-ups definitely understood exactly what was going on. Han Xiao speculated that the reason they had not granted or denied the research department permission yet was to test how he would react. If he let the research department trample over him, it could be the green light for them to stop playing nice with him.Of course, that was an extreme line of thought.The top bra.s.s definitely won\u2019t side with either faction. As long as I don\u2019t push things too far, they will have to act accordingly and compensate me.A thought suddenly occurred to Han Xiao. This could be my chance to obtain advancement knowledge!However, as advancement knowledge was top secret, it would not be so simple to just mention it casually.A plan began to formulate in Han Xiao\u2019s mind.Rob me in broad daylight? I\u2019ll teach you all that I\u2019m not that easy to bully!\u2026In the Research Department\u2026\u201cHeh heh. Well done, well done.\u201d The research department\u2019s head secretary was full of praise for Luo Xuan.Luo Xuan smiled plainly, but in truth he was suppressing his delight.\u201cThe department head thinks highly of you. We\u2019ve already requested all the necessary information and doc.u.ments from the logistics department. You can already be counted as our staff.\u201d\u201cWhat about the\u2026 promotion?\u201d\u201cThe department head specifically instructed that you will lead your own team. Your clearance will also be raised. Keep up the good work and there will be nothing to worry about.\u201dLuo Xuan\u2019s smile widened.\u201cI heard that Han Xiao is valued highly by the higher-ups. Will there be any problem?\u201d he asked.\u201cRelax, I have inside information. There is nothing he can do.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As everyone thought Han Xiao to be an ordinary mechanic, the outcome seemed obvious.Over the next few days, Han Xiao showed no signs of action, so it became apparent that he had, as expected, decided to swallow it.Nonetheless, it still remained a mystery as to why the research department would pick on a normal staff member so much.Li Ya Lin also suffered from the incident due to her involvement with Han Xiao, and while she kept on trying to call Han Xiao to speak to him, the line always failed to get through.Of course, Han Xiao was not going to let things end like that. While he had not made his move yet, that was because his preparations were not complete.Han Xiao had previously made about $100,000 from selling the Retractable Knives, $30,000 of which was used to purchase materials for High-explosive Gunpowder.Over the last few days, he had used another $30,000 of materials to make a huge batch of Retractable Knives\u2014100 in total.\u201cThat should be enough.\u201dHan Xiao had just finished with the hundredth knife, and he went to look for a crate to store them all in before leaving Division 13.As the threat of war loomed, guns were heavily regulated in the Six Nations. It was in fact illegal for civilians to possess any, which was why Han Xiao had gotten rid of his guns before entering the city.Nonetheless, there were illegal arms dealers situated all across the Six Nations. Neutral vendors such as these were implemented in Galaxy as a way for players to purchase equipment and intel as they carried out infiltration and a.s.sa.s.sination missions in enemy nations.Naturally, Han Xiao knew exactly where these vendors were located.Han Xiao was headed to District 8 to look for an arms dealer named Ma Xiu Si. Ma Xiu Si was an operative for the Fabian Company, a global powerhouse in the arms market who sold everything from guns to jets. Under the table, they even did business with the Six Nations themselves and the Revolutionary Army.\u2026Han Xiao easily found Ma Xiu Si, who was more than happy to entertain him when Han Xiao opened up the crate of Retractable Knives before him and began to explain their usage.Ma Xiu Si was experienced in the black market, so he instantly recognized the Retractable Knife\u2019s worth. While conventional melee weapons were not much of a money spinner, the Retractable Knife\u2019s concealability and element of surprise would definitely be favored by many.Han Xiao expressed his wish to sell the whole crate.\u201cCan you supply them long-term?\u201d asked Ma Xiu Si.Han Xiao chuckled.\u201cWould you be interested in the blueprint?\u201dMa Xiu Si\u2019s eyes widened. Blueprints were extremely important items to mechanics. They essentially gave their owners monopoly over their inventions. It was extremely rare that a mechanic would offer to sell one of his blueprints, so Ma Xiu Si was not only shocked but overjoyed.As he was a veteran salesman, however, he suppressed the excitement boiling within.\u201cName your price,\u201d he asked casually.\u201cThere\u2019s a hundred here. 5,000 each, and I\u2019ll sell you the blueprint for a million.\u201dMa Xiu Si gasped lightly. \u20185,000 each? A million for the blueprint? Just rob me, will you\u203d\u2019\u201cNo bargaining.\u201dHan Xiao was confident that Ma Xiu Si would agree to his terms.Ma Xiu Si frowned, but after a while of contemplation, he relented.\u201cDeal!\u201dBeing able to obtain the blueprint was far too lucrative a chance to miss.As the banks of each of the Six Nations were not connected to one another, dark web banking was the primary method of transaction in the underworld. Not only was it accessible worldwide, it was also extremely secure.Han Xiao performed fingerprint verification for the account on the spot.\u201cI look forward to doing more business with you. This is a VIP card.\u201dHan Xiao took the card from Ma Xiu Si and kept it.Fostering good relations with these arms dealers would prove useful in the long run as he did not plan to stay in Division 13 forever.\u2026Back in Division 13, the research director encountered the intelligence director in the hallway.\u201cLooks like you guys have chosen to support a good-for-nothing,\u201d mocked the research director. \u201cHe caved in so easily to a little bit of pressure. Take my advice\u2014stop playing nice with him.\u201dFor some reason, the intelligence director was not enraged by his words. He simply smiled back.\u201cGood luck,\u201d he replied plainly as he patted the research director on the shoulder.The research director was confused. \u2018Good luck? What do you mean?\u2019Suddenly, his phone rang. The division chief was looking for him. He hastily b.u.mbled his way to the chief\u2019s office.\u201cChief, you called?\u201d\u201cYour plans were approved yesterday. The Retractable Knife will be credited to your department.\u201dThe research director was overjoyed to hear the news.\u201cThank you for your trust, chief.\u201dThe chief chuckled.\u201cDon\u2019t be happy so soon.\u201dThe research director furrowed his brows.\u201cWhat happened? If it\u2019s about Han Xiao, there won\u2019t be a problem. There\u2019s nothing he can do.\u201d\u201cOh, you think so?\u201d questioned the chief.The research director nodded.\u201cGood\u2026\u201dSuddenly, the chief picked up a folder and threw it in the research director\u2019s face.\u201cTo think that you would abuse your power to sell the division\u2019s technology for personal gain! How disappointing.\u201dWhat\u203dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He hastily scrambled to pick up the doc.u.ment on the floor, and as he went through it, he began to tremble.The report stated that the blueprint for the Retractable Knife had been leaked, and that, naturally, the \u2018inventor\u2019 of the Retractable Knife would have to take responsibility for it.\u201cT-t-this is not my fault!\u201d he cried out. \u201cIt must be that brat, Han Xiao! He is obviously trying to frame me! Everyone knows that the blueprint belonged to him, please help me clear my name, Chief!\u201d\u201cThe report clearly states that the research department invented the Retractable Knife,\u201d replied the chief coolly. \u201cIt is your responsibility.\u201dThe research director felt a chill run down his spine as he suddenly realized what was going on.The top bra.s.s had chosen to back up Han Xiao!The reason why the verdict on their proposal was delayed for so long was simply that the higher-ups wanted to wait and see what Han Xiao would do.And Han Xiao had managed to play everyone.By leaking the blueprint, he was asking the higher ups, \u2018Here is the excuse you need. Do you want to help me or not?\u2019While they had not expected Han Xiao to come up with such a brilliant comeback to frame the research department, they were more than willing to help him out to appease him. After all, they did want to continue having his cooperation.Originally, Han Xiao\u2019s Retractable Knife would have been exclusive to Division 13, even if it meant that he himself had the monopoly over it, but thanks to the research department\u2019s greed, the Retractable Knife would now appear in the hands of others too.While Han Xiao\u2019s actions might have been a little bit extreme, the higher-ups were willing to overlook it. The blueprint was rightfully his anyway.Of course, if it had been a normal agent, they would without a doubt send him to court martial and expel him from Division 13. It was Han Xiao\u2019s unique ident.i.ty that stopped them from doing so. The intel he possessed was truly far too valuable. In any case, he had not stepped entirely out of line yet.Furthermore, it was important to display the Division\u2019s fairness to everyone.At this point, the research director\u2019s face had turned completely pale. He deeply regretted having tried to pick on Han Xiao.While the \u2018crime\u2019 itself was not grave to the point of a death sentence, his career was essentially over.Han Xiao, you b.a.s.t.a.r.d! he screamed inwardly.\u2026When news of the research director being charged with selling weapons illegally broke out, all the agents in Division 13 were filled with disbelief.The fact that he was not immediately sentenced heavily hinted that there was more to the entire incident than met the eye.It did not take long for the agents to put two and two together and arrive at the unbelievable conclusion that Han Xiao had orchestrated it all.Previously, they thought that Han Xiao had kept quiet due to caving in, but in retrospect, it was simply the calm before the storm.\u201cDid he actually frame the research director?\u201d\u201cThe gall of him!\u201d\u201cBut doesn\u2019t that mean that the higher-ups are supporting him\u203d\u201dWhat everyone found hardest to believe was that Han Xiao actually got off scot-free. This caused a lot of speculation regarding his true ident.i.ty to arise.And the person happiest to hear the news was none other than Li Ya Lin, who was vindicated from all the odd looks that people had been giving here due to her connection to Han Xiao. The first thing that she did was look for Di Su Su and gloat in front of her. However, Di Su Su was not the least angered by her. Instead, she was more preoccupied with her newly found interest in Han Xiao.\u201cWho exactly is Lin Lin\u2019s new teammate?\u201d\u2026The research director was only given a strict warning for now, and, unable to touch Han Xiao, his men suffered the brunt of his rage. Of course, Luo Xuan was not spared. Instead of his promised promotion, what he earned was a demotion to the position of an ordinary staff member.\u201cd.a.m.n it!\u201d cursed Luo Xuan.If he had known things would turn out like this, he would have obediently continued on in the logistics department. It was also now too late, as the logistics director was not even willing to grant him an audience.This is unfair!Why do they want to protect Han Xiao?How is he better than me\u203dLuo Xuan was blinded with rage.\u2026The next day, Han Xiao received word from Feng Jun that the higher-ups wanted to discuss the matter of settlement with him.Finally, the chance for Han Xiao to negotiate had come. Han Xiao knew that in the future, the hardliners would not carelessly take action against him again, so it was probably the one time that he would be able to acquire advancement knowledge.Han Xiao arrived at the HQ with his mask on as usual to meet with Feng Jun. Feng Jun led him to the chief\u2019s office where three people waited: the chief himself, the research director, and an old man who was faced against the gla.s.s window.\u201cGu Hui, Stardragon Strategic Defense Chief,\u201d introduced the chief.Han Xiao squinted. It was a familiar name, but he could not recall where he had heard it.\u201cSomeone wants to see you,\u201d Gu Hui continued in a low voice.The old man turned around and smiled at Han Xiao.Han Xiao\u2019s acting skills immediately kicked in.\u201cTall, old man\u203d\u201dThe tall old man chuckled.\u201cIt must be quite a surprise.\u201d\u201cWho exactly are you?\u201d asked Han Xiao as he nodded blankly, similar to how he had once acted back in the Germinal Organization.\u201cAll you need to know is that I have some power in Division 13.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHeh. Don\u2019t be so nervous. I\u2019ve already noticed you from back then. You gave me quite a favorable impression.\u201dMission accomplished!As Han Xiao wiped the confusion off his face, the tall old man scrutinized him for a second before slowly saying, \u201cTell me, how do you want this matter resolved?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And if you had even tried asking nicely, I might have even sold it to the division! But ask yourself \u2013 did you?\u201dThe research director could not retort.\u201cWhat kind of compensation do you want?\u201d asked Gu Hui.Han Xiao faked a sigh and pretended to contemplate for a moment before replying, \u201cI don\u2019t want something like this to happen again.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s for sure.\u201dIn any case, even if Han Xiao only chose to sell his goods privately, he would still only be selling to Division 13\u2019s own agents. While the quant.i.ty would not be as much as if they were ma.s.s produced, they still only benefited the division. Furthermore\u2026 what if more valuable blueprints ended up \u2018leaking\u2019?\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d continued Han Xiao as he rubbed his chin. \u201cI want to have a look at advanced mechanic knowledge.\u201dThe tall old man furrowed his brows. Was it a coincidence, or had Han Xiao planned to ask for it from the very start?Advanced mechanic knowledge was top-secret in Stardragon, and only accessible with a level 5 or higher clearance. In Galaxy, the equivalent requirement was an \u2018honored\u2019 reputation. Each of the Six Nations and the Germinal Organization possessed different kinds of advanced knowledge, but only the most trusted and deserving would have a chance to obtain them.Although Han Xiao appeared calm and firm on the outside, he was actually extremely nervous. Such a request would normally be impossible to ask of. Now, it all depended on the tall, old man.\u201cWhy advanced knowledge?\u201d\u201cJust curious.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter five minutes of tense silence, the tall old man made up his mind. As he looked deeply into Han Xiao\u2019s eyes, he slowly spoke, \u201cFine, I will allow it.\u201dHan Xiao was instantly overcome with relief and joy, but he suppressed his emotions.Suddenly, the research director interrupted, \u201cHold on! Advanced knowledge requires a level 5 clearance. This is against the rules!\u201dHan Xiao\u2019s mouth twitched.If this b.a.s.t.a.r.d dares to spoil my plans, I\u2019ll beat him into a pulp!\u201cWhat do you suggest then?\u201d Gu Hui asked unhappily.\u201cRules are rules. Although you, senior, are okay with it, I hardly think that the others will agree.\u201dThe tall old man smirked.\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare,\u201d answered the research director matter-of-factly.There were two levels of hierarchy in Division 13. Besides the thirteen section heads, there existed a higher committee comprised of the chief himself and other high-ranking officials who wielded enormous influence in Stardragon.The tall, old man was none other than one of the higher-ranking members, and he was the leader of the conservatives. Naturally, the hardliners had an equally powerful backer, which was why the research head dared to speak up.\u201cMy word alone will suffice,\u201d declared the tall old man plainly.The research head gritted his teeth. Suddenly, his eyes lit up.\u201cThen, I suggest granting him only half an hour of browsing. He doesn\u2019t even have the proper clearance anyway.\u201dGu Hui and the tall old man exchanged looks. This was a fair suggestion. Besides, Han Xiao himself had only asked to \u2018take a look\u2019.\u201cWe\u2019ll give you one hour!\u201d declared Gu Hui.The research head rejoiced secretly. Even an hour would not be enough time to look through a third of the advanced knowledge.Deep down, however, Han Xiao was laughing.One hour? Watch me take one minute with my talent points!He had to bite his lip to stop himself from grinning.Calm down\u2026 calm down\u2026\u2026The advanced knowledge was protected with an extremely secure multi-layered encryption. The code to unlocking it was a combined series of over a hundred 48-digit strings that were refreshed constantly.The contents itself were only able to be browsed by using a special terminal.Han Xiao was brought by Gu Hui to take an elevator to a secret bas.e.m.e.nt. When the lift doors opened, Han Xiao was greeted by the sight of a brightly lit metallic hallway lined throughout with surveillance cameras on either side. While there were no guards, the corridor was full of metal detectors and red lasers, and there were guns concealed behind the walls. They would activate automatically upon unauthorized entry.It was a fortress in its own right.\u201cHow much did you guys spend on this corridor?\u201d\u201cA few billion,\u201d Gu Hui calmly answered.Han Xiao let out a soft snort.The terminal was Stardragon\u2019s most advanced computer. The amount of data that it could process in just one second alone could overload a regular computer. It contained all of the nation\u2019s top secrets.Han Xiao guessed that even if he maxed his \u2018Computing\u2019 talent, it would not be enough to hack through the terminal\u2019s firewall.It took an entire five minutes to walk across the entire stretch of the hallway, and, as they approached the end, a spherical room appeared in Han Xiao\u2019s view. A transparent pa.s.sageway connected the hallway to the center of the sphere where a screen could be seen. There was also a panel connected with a mouse and a keyboard. This was the interface of the terminal.As they stepped into the room, Han Xiao noticed that there were actually countless optical fibers and advanced looking computer parts laid inside the gla.s.s \u2013 the entire room was actually the terminal!Han Xiao, however, was not impressed.\u201cWhy is the air here so stale? Did you guys forget the ventilation or something?\u201dGu Hui\u2019s eye twitched.He calmed himself down and replied, \u201cThat is the interface. The preparations have been made. You will not be able to access any other information apart from the advanced knowledge. For the sake of protocol, I will remind you that we will be watching, and you had better not try anything funny.\u201dGot it, I won\u2019t make you laugh.Han Xiao nodded and proceeded to walk to the panel.The terminal prompted him for a search input, so he typed in \u201cadvancement knowledge\u201d, and several results appeared on the screen:Esper Advanced Knowledge: [DNA \u2013 Strengthened Energy Level]Esper Advanced Knowledge: [DNA \u2013 Strengthened Control]Pugilist Advanced Knowledge: [Shockwave Burst]Pugilist Advanced Knowledge: [Wave Control]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Some of their skills included [Energy Burst], which is self-explanatory, and [Wavedash], which allowed instantaneous dodging of attacks.Although Pugilists across the universe practiced and employed different kinds of teachings and techniques, all of them were centered around the use of qi.Espers were far more unique, as each of them possessed different kinds of supernatural powers. An Esper\u2019s strength was determined by their DNA growth. Through leveling up their talents, their control over their powers would increase: power, speed, control, etc. For example, Magneto, when he was young, could only exert control over small objects like coins. However, as his powers developed, he became able to move entire stadiums and ultimately even control the very earth\u2019s magnetic field. With sufficient time, an Esper\u2019s potential could be said to be unlimited.Of course, two Espers with the same superpower might not necessarily use them in the same ways. For example, not all electricity users would be able to emulate each other\u2019s feats and applications of electricity manipulation.

At higher levels, they possessed frightening firepower. It was commonly known in Galaxy that the key to winning or losing against Cannonmasters lay in range.If the enemy Cannonmaster is within 100m, don\u2019t hesitate\u2014charge him down!However, if he is over 1,000m away, it would be wise to proceed with caution.And if he is 3,000m away\u2026 well, that won\u2019t be the end of the world just yet, but any further and good luck, buddy.Warmachines, on the other hand, employed technologically advanced combat weapons to fight at close range. From bio-armor to mobile suits, there were many ways for Warmachines to quench their thirst for melee combat.Yet, when compared to the Technician, both of these paths steered away from the true essence of a Mechanic\u2014invention.Over 80% of blueprints were exclusive to Technicians, so choosing either path would mean forfeiting the ability to create many higher-level gear and machines.The trade-off was that they were superior to Technicians in combat and, to most, more fun to play.

    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 - Squad Leader's ReturnPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 49: Squad Leader\u2019s ReturnTranslator: MJ_ Editor: Millman97180,000 experience\u201445,000 from the Black Spider mission, and the rest mostly acc.u.mulated from Han Xiao\u2019s efforts in tirelessly crafting Retractable Knives and Highly Explosive Gunpowder. Currently, both blueprints were at Lv. 2 and Lv. 3 respectively. As they were cheap and easy to craft, they were much easier to level up in contrast to other blueprints like the Lightweight Mecha Arm, or the Rover.A month had pa.s.sed since Han Xiao arrived at the Western Capital. Since then, Han Xiao had earned an overall amount of 200,000 experience, which was equal to a third of what he had earned back in his 6-month stint with the Germinal Organization. Now, with over $1,500,000 in his possession, finances were the least of Han Xiao\u2019s concern.The first-cla.s.s advancement was the biggest game changer as it granted the player an energy attribute.Han Xiao lightly pressed his thumb towards his index finger. As soon as he did so, his index was enveloped by a sort of invisible air. It felt similar to a weak current, and Han Xiao could discern that it was magnetism. Magnetism was one of the attributes that a Mechanic could specialize in. Combat-wise, it was not as powerful as the destructive attributes of fire or lightning. Instead, its main use was in strengthening the Machinery Affinity of a Mechanic. It would eventually allow for automated crafting.Energy Attributes were not limited to just the natural elements. Instead, they could be thought of more as \u2018concepts\u2019 of how each cla.s.s uses energy. For example, the energy attribute for Psychics is [Spirit]. Furthermore, energy attributes could also be nurtured and changed. For example, a Pugilist who cultivated various techniques would be able to grasp the speed of wind, power of fire, or hardness of iron, etc.[Abstract Thinking] and [Intermediate Machinery Affinity] were self-explanatory, while [Strafe] was an active defensive skill.If Han Xiao had chosen the path of Cannonmaster, he would have gained three new skills. However, he only gained one: [Strafe], a defensive skill. Han Xiao was by no means a coward who did not dare to face the enemy head-on, but he did indeed prefer a dual-natured skill like this that could be used both offensively and defensively to other flashy and high-damage ones. Furthermore, gaining unlimited ammo, even if temporary, could prove to be useful.[Energy Training Technique] was a common skill acquired after the first advancement.It was a special type of \u2018growth\u2019 skill that did not have a level system. Instead, its effects could be improved through repeated usage/practice that expended experience, and each use increased the character\u2019s energy, up until the skill\u2019s set usage limit. The user\u2019s energy attribute played an important part in the training effectiveness.Most energy-related training techniques utilized such a growth system.Energy was indeed an integral part of Superhumans. It largely decided a character\u2019s grade and power level. The early levels of energy stages are as follows:Lv. 1 -10Lv. 2 \u2013 50Lv. 3 \u2013 100Lv. 4 \u2013 200Lv. 5 \u2013 400Lv. 6 \u2013 1000\u2026Not only did reaching the next energy level give each player bonus stats, there were also extra benefits that could be unlocked upon reaching certain levels.Lv. 1 was the bare benchmark, and while Hila was only Lv. 30, her energy level had already reached 500 ouna, roughly five times more than Han Xiao\u2019s. One of the reasons for this was the Energy Training Technique system.Platinum Alloy was a new material-type blueprint acquired through [Advanced Material Composition]. The alloy itself was green in color, and it was well-suited for making armor due to its st.u.r.diness. Its crafting requirement was Lv. 5 Novice Refining.Of the 180,000 experience at hand, Han Xiao decided to spend 25,000 to reach Lv. 10 Agent. This gave him a number of stats (+2 STR, +2 DEX, +3 END, +1 CHA), as well as 1 talent point and 1 a.s.signable stat point.____________________Advancement detected!

It functioned as a tutorial cla.s.s that could be deleted upon the first advancement. The experience that a player put into the [Civilian] cla.s.s would be refunded upon deletion, unless the unknowing player had maxed it out.\u201cDelete, I guess,\u201d mumbled Han Xiao to himself. There was nothing to lose from deleting it.The [Civilian] cla.s.s subsequently disappeared from the information window, leaving it to reflect only a max level [Agent], as well as Han Xiao\u2019s character level of 21.Next, Han Xiao inputted another 45,000 experience points to raise [Basic Shooting] to Lv. 10, which gave him 10% Accuracy, +2 DEX, and another talent point.In short, Han Xiao had just spent 70,000 experience points, but he still needed to save 64,000 for the [Energy Training Technique], leaving him with\u2026 yup, give me a second\u202647,000 more experience points!\u201cI\u2019ll keep them for now,\u201d muttered Han Xiao, lamenting how quickly the experience points vanished.Fortunately for him, there was still the High-explosive Gunpowder that he had been stocking up on. It would ensure a steady stream of experience ahead.\u2026When the time was up, Gu Hui promptly escorted Han Xiao back upstairs, where Feng Jun had been waiting.Suddenly, Han Xiao remembered something.\u201cOh right. I heard that it was a guy called Korat who stirred up this incident. Help me get word out that I won\u2019t be selling anything to this person.\u201dFeng Jun grimaced.\u201cDo you think I\u2019m a messenger or something?\u201dHan Xiao raised an eyebrow.\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201dFeng Jun opened his mouth, but no words came out.\u201cFine,\u201d he groaned.\u2026\u201cHe says he\u2019s blacklisted me?\u201dKorat laughed coldly, seemingly unfazed.All along, he had only been concerned with personal gain, and he did not see how Han Xiao could ever pose a threat to him.\u2026With the resolution of the incident, Han Xiao returned to the workshop, where three days went by peacefully.Having just advanced, Han Xiao spent the time adjusting to his newly upgraded body. With his past life\u2019s experience, he quickly got in sync and began to train with the [Energy Training Technique]. Each training expended experience points, as well as stamina. As stamina recovery rate was limited, and Han Xiao had to continue with manufacturing, he could only train up to two times a day.____________________You have trained with [Energy Training Technique] once.Mastery: 81%Stamina: +3\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afTraining effectiveness depended on the main stat of one\u2019s cla.s.s. The main stat for Mechanics was INT, so he devoted four una.s.signed points into INT, raising its total to 36. Previously, Han Xiao had needed to put quite a few points into STR and END, but that was only for the purpose of escaping the Germinal facility. From now on, he could focus solely on INT.The effectiveness of [Energy Training Technique] was divided into three stages:+1 Stamina for lower than 40% Mastery+2 Stamina for 40%-80% Mastery+3 Stamina for 80% and above MasteryHan Xiao was right on Stage 3.As Han Xiao had no other outlet to sell the Retractable Knife for now, and a few days had already gone by, he felt that it was about time to release the gunpowder. By now, he had produced thousands of bullets.He was just about to ring Li Ya Lin up when she beat him to it.\u201cLeader is out of the hospital. He\u2019s called us up.\u201d\u2026Han Xiao found himself the last to arrive at the secret ops team meeting room, where, other than the trio, was another man. The man\u2019s face was extremely square, and he seemed both righteous and stern. He looked extremely reliable and currently had his lips pursed.\u201cSo, you are Han Xiao?\u201dThe team leader\u2019s eyes were filled with both unhappiness and caution as he examined Han Xiao.Han Xiao was caught off guard by him. Suddenly, Li Yao tugged on his sleeve and muttered to him, \u201cHe has the final say in who can join secret ops, but since your case was special, and you had the approval from the higher ups without going through him, he\u2019s a bit\u2014uh\u2014unhappy. But don\u2019t worry. Leader might be strict, but he\u2019s not a bad person.\u201dThat explained things.Han Xiao was given a second shock when he turned to look at Li Yao. Li Yao\u2019s entire body was wrapped in bandages, and he looked very much like a giant rice dumpling, with only his eyes and mouth revealed. It was an extremely pitiful state.\u201cWho beat you up?\u201d asked a bewildered Han Xiao.Suddenly, Li Ya Lin coughed.Li Yao looked as though he was about to say something but changed his words. \u201cI\u2014 I fell down.\u201dHan Xiao gave him a weird look. His injuries were so serious, if he really fell, he must have done the \u2018fall a hundred times if you\u2019re a man\u2019 challenge.\u201cLet me introduce myself,\u201d interrupted the leader.\u201cI am the team\u2019s leader, Zhang Wei,\u201d he introduced, shocking Han Xiao a third time.\u201cHow casual is your parents\u2019 naming sense\u203d I think only Ye Qiu or Ye Fan could be worse!\u201dHan Xiao\u2019s response, for some reason, caused Zhang Wei to look confused.\u201cYou know Ye Fan from Hai Xia\u2019s military affairs? Middle\u2014cough\u2014I mean, I worked with him a few times back in the hostel.\u201dHeavens! There really exists someone with such a G.o.dly name? That guy\u2019s rank must be S+!\u201cAnyway,\u201d continued Zhang Wei sternly. \u201cWith your inclusion, our team is back to being a five man cell. Although your position is in the backline, I still have to say this: as your background is a complete mystery, and I don\u2019t trust your ability yet, I will continue to observe you for now. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s some high-level agent who a.s.signed you here. If you fail to meet my expectations, I will kick you out of the squad.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Naturally, Han Xiao was not offended at all.However, the chances of him being kicked out were nonexistent\u2014after all, the top bra.s.s had decided things.Zhang Wei himself understood this fact, but, as the leader of a squad, he could not just instantly accept someone whose background was a complete mystery\u2014the higher-ups had not provided him with any information regarding Han Xiao.Furthermore, in his eyes, Han Xiao was still new, and it remained to be seen if he was truly capable. In their field of work, the slightest mistake could result in the gravest of consequences, so being a.s.signed a new guy all of a sudden was not a laughing matter.Of course, it was not that Zhang Wei looked down on newbies. However, he believed that any new agent should have to go through two or three years of training before earning the right to even be considered for secret ops.Who the h.e.l.l threw this guy to us? Do they think that we\u2019re babysitters\u203dThey\u2019re taking this far too lightly! d.a.m.n you all!As Zhang Wei continued to examine Han Xiao, he made up his mind to ignore the repercussions and kick Han Xiao to another team if he proved unable to gel with the squad.Meanwhile, Han Xiao did not know what was going through his mind, but he found that Zhang Wei\u2019s eyes were slowly filling up with animosity.Suddenly, Li Yao\u2019s laptop flashed, prompting him to turn his neck around with much effort. His expression changed as he yelled, \u201cThere\u2019s an urgent mission! They want us to depart now!\u201d\u201cDetails?\u201d asked Zhang Wei sternly.\u201cMa Qing Yang\u2019s team was ambushed during their mission to a.s.sault a Germinal base. The higher-ups want us to provide a.s.sistance immediately. They\u2019ll fill us in on the plane.\u201d\u201ca.s.saulting a Germinal base?\u201d wondered Han Xiao. He could guess roughly what had occurred, having previously given Division 13 info on three of their bases.All three bases were situated within Stardragon territory, which was why Stardragon had been able to immediately mobilize its troops to destroy two of them. The destruction of these two bases had increased Han Xiao\u2019s achievement progress rate to 2.0%. However, the Germinal were no fools and had clearly antic.i.p.ated that the third base would be attacked as well. They had clearly set up a trap.Zhang Wei promptly headed for the door. When he pa.s.sed Han Xiao, he paused for a moment and frowned before instructing, \u201cLi Yao, you will stay behind to provide support. Han Xiao, you are new, so this is a good chance for you. Stay with Li Yao and learn well if you want to become useful.\u201dLi Yao was about to say something, but he hesitated. Han Xiao smiled and simply replied, \u201cFine.\u201dAs Zhang Wei did not partic.i.p.ate in the Black Spider mission and had only received a flowery description of events from Li Ya Lin; he did not trust in Han Xiao\u2019s ability yet. Han Xiao sighed inwardly. He understood this well.Han Xiao pondered for a moment before holding Li Ya Lin back to pa.s.s her four magazines of High-explosive ammo.\u201cConsider it a gift from a friend.\u201dLi Ya Lin\u2019s eyes lit up upon seeing them.\u201cIs this your new invention?\u201dHan Xiao chuckled.\u201cDon\u2019t squander them\u2014they can start quite a fire.\u201d\u2026_____________________You have triggered the E-cla.s.s mission: [Rescue!]Mission Description: Provide a.s.sistance to the secret-ops team being chased by the enemy.

From the first-person footage on the screen, they could see that the trio had already boarded the aircraft.Beneath HQ was a special railway used to quickly transport agents and staff to a landing site.On the jet followed another team of twelve secret-ops agents, and on the way, Han Xiao, Li Ya Lin, and Li Yao made small talk, while Zhang Wei and Lambert closed their eyes in rest.An hour later, the jet arrived at their destination.It was a cold desert filled with long stretches of dunes, and a bright, scorching sun was hanging in the azure sky, the intense heat of which caused the air to s.h.i.+mmer and the ground to simmer. Upon contact with the sand, the agents\u2019 boots instantly gave off a burnt smell.\u201cWe have arrived,\u201d reported Zhang Wei in a deep voice.The trio were fully-equipped. Li Ya Lin, still with that yellow hoodie and black bodysuit, had a retractable knife by her waist, and a black bag over her back that contained the Lightweight Mecha Arm; Lambert carried ten modified Retractable Daggers and a huge, large caliber rifle; and Zhang Wei, whose equipment gave even Han Xiao a shock.It was a powered armor suit!Zhang Wei\u2019s entire body was covered inside a st.u.r.dy, grayish suit of armor that spotted a few scars of battle. The helmet would have fit right in with the Middle Ages, and only had openings for vision, but the arms were modified and fitted two thick-barreled machine guns. The ammo belt was concealed within the amour, but the reload chamber was located near the thighs. On the back of the suit hung a hexagon s.h.i.+eld of steel, reminiscent of a tortoise, and overall, the suit made Zhang Wei look like an incomparably heavy, giant clunk of iron that was designed for show.It spurred Han Xiao\u2019s interest.This is the prototype for the [Combatant Armored Suit], one of the few suits available back in Version 1.0.As the Six Nations each possessed different kinds of advanced knowledge, the suits that they engineered differed from one another.Theseus was the nation that initiated development of the armored suit, and, sometime after the game\u2019s launch, they made the [Combatant Armored Suit], a mini modular mobile suit\u2014the first of its kind on Planet Aquamarine. At present, it was probably still under development, but although what Zhang Wei was wearing was just a prototype, Han Xiao wondered how Division 13 were able to acquire Theseusian technology.In Galaxy, players who were \u2018Exalted\u2019 with Theseus could purchase the [Combatant Armored Suit] from them. They were extremely pricey, and even routine maintenance and repairs cost well over tens of thousands. It was not something that most players could afford.As a back-line support, Han Xiao\u2019s duty included maintenance of equipment, so Zhang Wei\u2019s armored suit would probably fall into his charge as well.Without encryption measures in place, Technicians were able to reverse engineer blueprints.If the Technician already possessed the required knowledge, it would make the process faster, but even without any, it was still possible to reverse engineer a piece of machinery or technology\u2014just that it would take much more time and require astronomically larger amounts of experience. Furthermore, the results would often come out as \u2018Incomplete\u2019.The required knowledge for crafting the [Combatant Armored Suit] was an advanced weaponry knowledge possessed by Theseus.Han Xiao bit his finger. If he could reverse-engineer the blueprints of the armored suit, then even if incomplete, they would still provide him with a new means of combat and boost his combat power. However, when he thought of how he could better spend the experience on the other more valuable and useful blueprints in his memory, he gave up the idea.Li Yao spoke into the intercom. \u201cMa Qing Yang\u2019s squad is about 13km away. There are 15 armored cars and one Black Harrier helicopter in pursuit. The meeting point is set on a hill 3km away. The objective will be to slow down the enemy and link up with the Ma Qing Yang\u2019s squad. Do not engage the enemy excessively. I have already sent them the coordinates. Now, get ready.\u201dHis instructions were clear, as befitting of a back-line supporter, functioning as a third eye to provide precise coordination and tactical advice.The trio and the field team swiftly arrived at the hill, where they lay in wait for the enemy.Soon after, the sound of engines began to approach, and on the vast desert plains appeared a single vehicle being chased by over a dozen others. The sound of gunfire was incessant, and behind the fleeing car was a continuous trail of smoke and blasts.Aboard were none other than Ma Qing Yang\u2019s squad.\u201cReady!\u201d ordered Zhang Wei sternly as he closely waited for the Germinal vehicles to come in range. \u201cFire!\u201dSuddenly, from behind the hill, a rain of metal dense enough to cover the sky descended upon the surprised Germinal agents. Bullets rang and clattered non-stop as they hit the armored vehicles.Upon the sudden ambush, the leading Germinal vehicle immediately spun around to avoid direct hits, almost overturning as it skidded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Within the s.p.a.ce of a few seconds, the two cars exploded into b.a.l.l.s of flames.Meanwhile, Lambert was showcasing his skill with the rifle. He remained still as he fired shot after shot of steel core bullets with 100% accuracy to halt the enemy\u2019s advance.\u201cThe reinforcements are here!\u201dAboard the fleeing car, Ma Qing Yang and his teammates rejoiced. Almost the entire team had sustained injuries and were lying down.As they neared the hill, Ma Qing Yang stuck his head out from the window of the driver seat and yelled, \u201cOld Zhang, there\u2019s too many of them! Quickly flee!\u201dRight at this moment, a strange gale of wind suddenly descended upon the rescue team\u2019s location. The dancing sand began to form the image of a ghostly face. The sight of it was both unnerving and ominous.\u201cDuck!\u201d bellowed Zhang Wei as he hurriedly dropped to the ground to roll away. As the armored suit was too heavy, he did not have many other choices of movement. Li Ya Lin and Lambert were the quickest to react, and they managed to duck to a side.As the gale crashed onto the ground, the blast sent a number of field agents flying.Zhang Wei suddenly felt a sharp pain throughout his mind, and his nose started to bleed. As he looked around, to his horror, the other field agents who had not been able to run away in time were all bleeding profusely from their orifices as they twitched uncontrollably.\u201cMental attack!\u201d yelled a shocked Zhang Wei. \u201cThe enemy is a superhuman!\u201dAs he looked towards the enemy fleet to find the source of the attack, he noticed the hood of one of the cars open up, and a slender woman in a jet-black leather suit jumped out and started running towards them at an incredible speed. Her headful of red hair floated behind her, making her seem like some kind of red and black flash of lightning.Hila\u2019s eyes were emotionless. With a wave of a hand, another ghostly face appeared in mid-air in front of Zhang Wei. The wind wailed horrifyingly.No, that\u2019s not the wind!That is the screaming of souls!Necromastery! This was indeed Hila\u2019s ability.Zhang Wei\u2019s consciousness began to grow blurry, causing him to crumple to the ground. If it were not for his strong physique, he would probably have died on the spot.Back at Division 13, Han Xiao furrowed his brows. Pus.h.i.+ng Li Yao to take command, he barked, \u201cShe is the Germinal\u2019s combat commander! Quickly flee!\u201dZhang Wei was about to reprimand Han Xiao for s.n.a.t.c.hing command when, to his surprise, he discovered that Li Ya Lin and Lambert were unhesitatingly retreating. It appeared as though they fully trusted in Han Xiao\u2019s judgement!\u2018Is the new guy that reliable?\u2019Suppressing his shock, Zhang Wei gritted his teeth and stood up to activate the thrusters by his legs, allowing him to jump 5 to 6 meters a leap. As he bounded after the pair, he continued to fire cover shots towards Hila to slow her down.Hila reached the hilltop in no time, and with another wave of her hand, a gray light flashed across the entire area. The remaining field agents instantly collapsed to the ground. There was no apparent injury on their bodies, yet all of them had ceased breathing.Han Xiao\u2019s expression was extremely grave. He had known all along of Hila\u2019s true strength. It was a thing of fortune that he had not needed to face her during his escape. In Galaxy, her powers were cla.s.sified as having the exceedingly rare potential of S-Cla.s.s, surpa.s.sing the Heavenly level.At present, Hila\u2019s power was still but a fraction of what she would eventually become capable of, yet even this bit was still too overwhelming.\u201cShe\u2019s too fast! Li Ya Lin, it\u2019s up to you!\u201dWithout a moment\u2019s hesitation, Li Ya Lin turned around to face the incoming Hila. As she kicked towards her direction, a yellow burst of energy shot out that managed to push Hila back a few steps.\u201cPugilist?\u201d Hila squinted at Li Ya Lin as she clasped both hands together, conjuring an even larger ghostly face that smashed towards her.Maintaining her composure, Li Ya Lin ducked underneath the ghostly face with a slide and managed to avoid a direct hit. As she approached Hila, she whipped out the Retractable Knife by her waist and gave a mighty cleave.Hila\u2019s eyes widened at the suddenness of her blow, and she did a tumble on the ground to evade.Seizing the initiative, Li Ya Lin followed up with a series of powerful strikes with her legs: a stamp, a smash, a sweep, and a kick \u2013 the string of attacks flowing beautifully like a dancing swallow. Fast enough to create afterimages, but Li Ya Lin was certainly not just about speed. The force of her blows backed her killing intent.Swallow Style!On the receiving end, Hila wrapped her arms with a gray aura to strengthen them, allowing her to block each blow with them. The fact that Hila did not seem to be receiving any damage at all only went to show how far apart they were in terms of strength \u2013 Li Ya Lin specialized in close combat yet could not overwhelm her.The exchange lasted for only a few seconds, but anything could have happened in that short span of time.\u201cUse the mecha arm! It\u2019ll let you help Lambert get a chance to snipe her!\u201dBiting her lip, Li Ya Lin quickly inserted her left arm into the bag and pulled it out with the Lightweight Mechanical Arm equipped. With a powerful strike combining her own power with that of the mecha arm, she finally managed to break through Hila\u2019s defenses by blowing her arms away, leaving her chest exposed.The mecha arm followed through into her fles.h.!.+A direct hit!Hila\u2019s face flashed red momentarily, and with a low harrumph brought her palms together and rubbed them slowly, and as soon as she did so, the gray aura wrapping her arms began to revolve faster and faster. Next, she threw down both arms \u2013 palms facing the ground \u2013 and, from where she stood, powerful winds began to arise, a.s.saulting the entire surrounding!Li Ya Lin hastily retreated backwards, but even so, her mind was still struck by the mental attack, causing her soul to feel like it was being torn apart. The pain was indescribable, and two streams of blood trickled down from Li Ya Lin\u2019s nose as her vision seemed to turn upside-down, causing her to nearly lose her balance and fall over.As Hila examined the familiar visage of the Lightweight Mecha Arm, she yelled in rage and shock, \u201cHow are you related to Zero\u203d\u201d\u2018Zero? Who?\u2019 Li Ya Lin was bewildered.Right at this moment, Lambert saw his opportunity and fired a shot! Hila\u2019s expression changed at the sound of the sniper rifle, and she immediately lunged sideways to dodge while enveloping her entire body with her gray aura. The large caliber sniper rifle bullet hit her on the shoulder, sending her spinning backwards in the air \u2013 as though hit by a train at full speed.\u201cZhang Wei, quickly take Li Ya Lin and run!\u201dZhang Wei did not take offense at being directly called by name. It was with Han Xiao\u2019s direction that Li Ya Lin and Lambert had managed to injure the scary woman, and he now had some trust in Han Xiao\u2019s judgement. He hurriedly lifted Li Ya Lin in his hands and turned around to leap towards Ma Qing Yang\u2019s vehicle.As they retreated, the remainder of the Germinal fleet arrived at the foot of the hill, and they began to open fire. Sparks flew as the bullets deflected off Zhang Wei\u2019s armored suit, only leaving dents and marks. Zhang Wei did not even bother to take a look behind him. All that was going through his head was that the armored suit was truly his lucky charm this day. In the past, he had always had grievances over it being too heavy, but now, it was proving to be extremely reliable.\u201cGet in the car!\u201d yelled an anxious Ma Qing Yang as he hurriedly slowed down for them.The trio managed to board the vehicle, but it was a close shave. The concentrated fire was nearly enough to penetrate it.Now that they were in the clear, Zhang Wei finally had time to a.s.sess the enemy\u2019s status: their fleet was not fast enough to catch up with them, and that powerful superhuman had not gotten up yet. As long as they made it to the aircraft, everything would be fine.\u201cWe\u2019re safe now!\u201dZhang Wei let out a sigh of relief.Unfortunately, Han Xiao had bad news for him.\u201cLook out above.\u201dAbove?Zhang Wei gave a start.Right, they still have a helicopter!The Black Harrier finally made its appearance and began to shoot down at their car.\u201cWe have to take that out somehow!\u201d a.s.sessed Zhang Wei immediately. \u201cIf not, our own aircraft will be in danger. Lambert, it\u2019s up to you and your sniper rifle!\u201dLambert shook his head plainly.\u201cI\u2019m all out of armor-piercing sh.e.l.ls. Standard bullets won\u2019t do against the Black Harrier\u2019s thick armor. Even if I had some left, it would take more than 7 shots.\u201d\u201cAre we really going to die here?\u201dDespair was written all over Ma Qing Yan\u2019s face. They were only a kilometer away from their escape plan\u2019s extraction point, but it did not seem like they would make it.Suddenly, Han Xiao spoke, \u201cDid you forget my present?\u201dLi Ya Lin gave a start and hurriedly took out the four magazines. One of them was filled with rifle bullets.\u201cWhat does this do?\u201d\u201cSee for yourself.\u201dLambert quickly took the magazine from Li Ya Lin and loaded his sniper rifle.As he readied to fire the shot, everyone watched on in antic.i.p.ation.This single bullet was their final hope.In this critical moment, time seemed to slow down for all of them.As soon as Lambert pulled the trigger, a bra.s.s sh.e.l.l flew out from the chamber, and the crimson bullet was ignited as it accelerated out of the barrel spinning. Whirling, it landed directly on the helicopter\u2019s bullet-proof gla.s.s.Suddenly, the crimson bullet opened up like a blooming flower to expose its explosive contents to the air.\u201cKaboom!\u201dThe entire helicopter was instantly engulfed in a giant ball of flames. On closer inspection, the fire was actually burning off on the very armor itself \u2013 as though it had actually been ignited!The helicopter began to spin out on control mid-air. The pilot \u2013 in his panic \u2013 decided to abandon s.h.i.+p.On board the car, everyone was completely stunned by what they had just witnessed. Slowly, their attention turned towards the magazines that were full of the magic ammo.Even reinforced armor was ignited!What the h.e.l.l is this ammo\u203d\u201cWho got their hands on such good treasure?\u201d asked a stupefied Ma Qing Yang.Li Ya Lin\u2019s eyes began to s.h.i.+ne. \u201cThis stuff is good!\u201dShe immediately loaded up her handgun with one of the magazines and fired a few shots. The pursuing enemy vehicles similarly went up in b.a.l.l.s of flames, and even the missed shots were setting the ground ablaze.As the vehicles\u2019 armor heated up, their interiors soon turned into furnaces, and the heat was even causing the engine and other key parts to overheat, putting a halt to their pursuit.As the gang\u2019s car charged into the aircraft hangar, the pilot who had been anxiously observing the situation immediately took flight, and they were soon gone with the wind.Back on the ground, Hila\u2019s face was pale. Where she had been shot at on her shoulder was only a shallow wound. She was using her gray aura to heal it up. As she grudgingly watched the aircraft leave, she made a call to the boss and said through gritted teeth, \u201cWe\u2019ve found Zero\u2019s trail!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Today, we only made it out alive thanks to your guidance and your equipment. Welcome to the team.\u201dA late welcome was better than none.Han Xiao chuckled.\u201cNo need to apologize over such trivial matters \u2013 I\u2019m a gracious man.\u201dZhang Wei felt a s.h.i.+ver down his spine. Han Xiao\u2019s words sounded odd to him.\u201cOh right,\u201d continued Han Xiao, \u201cwho made your armored suit?\u201d\u201cOh, this is just a prototype of the [Combatant Powered Armor]. It was among the spoils of war during the battle with Theseus a few years back. Presently, it\u2019s the only functional one we have. They tried to reverse engineer it, but as progress was too slow and maintenance proved troublesome as well, it was handed to me.\u201dThe [Combatant Armored Suit]\u2019s crafting prerequisite was the advanced weaponry talent [Large-scale Remodeling], which was also required to craft many other power suits, machine frames, and other larger combat machinery. If Theseus had only just created the prototype, then Stardragon would definitely be much further behind.Han Xiao saw his chance.\u201cYou can leave the maintenance to me.\u201d\u201cSure!\u201d rejoiced Zhang Wei. He now trusted Han Xiao\u2019s ability.\u201cIs this special bullet a new invention of yours?\u201d interrupted Li Ya Lin excitedly.Han Xiao proceeded to fully explain the use of the High-explosive Gunpowder.Regular incendiary ammunition required a flammable target to work effectively, but the High-explosive Gunpowder contained a special chemical that could activate upon simply coming into contact with the air and \u2018light up\u2019 anything that it came into contact with. It\u2019s temperature and power were comparable to a Molotov, but what made it scary was that this power could be harnessed within bullets! Everyone could see how this was a game-changer.\u201cAre you selling this?\u201d asked Ma Qing Yang animatedly.\u201cOf course \u2013 50 a bullet.\u201dNow that they had proved effective, it was a good time to release them.\u201cI want 200!\u201d replied Ma Qing Yang immediately. \u201c20 handgun bullets, 150 submachine gun bullets, and 30 sniper rifle bullets.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d answered Han Xiao. \u201cYou can collect them in a day.\u201d\u201cYou can start to collect orders,\u201d he instructed Li Ya Lin privately. \u201cLike before, I\u2019ll give you a 20% discount.\u201dLi Ya Lin\u2019s lips curled into a grin.\u2026News of how the mission unfolded spread like wildfire in Division 13. Naturally, the incendiary bullets became the talk of the town.\u201cHan Xiao\u2019s new product?\u201d\u201cI heard that that\u2019s what saved their lives!\u201dThe Retractable Knife incident had already garnered Han Xiao a lot of attention. Upon Ma Qing Yang\u2019s order of the bullets becoming public knowledge, many agents came forward to inquire about them. As a way of repaying Han Xiao\u2019s team for rescuing them, Ma Qing Yang held a live demonstration in the practice field.Everyone was stunned by the power of the incendiary bullets, and the first thing they did after the demonstration was look for Li Ya Lin to place orders. Everything was going according to Han Xiao\u2019s plan.It was a revolutionary invention, and this time, the top bra.s.s knew they had to make sure that things would not end up like the previous fiasco.They even brought the Research Director in for a warning before he even did anything.The division offered Han Xiao numerous terms to provide both field-ops and special-ops with the new bullets, and he agreed to sell them at a slightly lower price of $20,000 for 500 bullets.In just the first day alone, Han Xiao\u2019s stockpile of a few thousand bullets was sold out, earning him $200,000. Coupled with the $1,500,000 that he had earned from the underground network, his savings were not small.After the cla.s.s advancement, Han Xiao\u2019s production speed was raised considerably, and he focused solely on producing the gunpowder. As a show of support, Division 13 decided to provide him with cartridges and sh.e.l.ls, which greatly sped up the process. Each batch yielded around 300 bullets, and Han Xiao was able to produce over 10 such batches a day. Crafting a bullet gave Han Xiao 5 to 10 experience points, so he was able to earn up to 30,000 experience in just a single day.It was probably the fastest experience growth ever by a Mechanic of his level.\u2026\u201cNot selling to me?\u201dKorat was fuming. Initially, he had thought that a simple apology would resolve the grudge between him and Han Xiao \u2013 after all, money was money. However, Li Ya Lin actually shut the door tight on him.\u201cHan Xiao said that you\u2019re on his blacklist, and he instructed me not to take either your money nor your apology.\u201dThe other agents who had initially thought of reporting the Retractable Knife had Korat to thank for taking the initiative back then. Or else, they would be in the same predicament as him now.When Korat offered to buy the bullets from his colleagues at a higher price, he found out that none of them were willing to. Even when he set his price at 200 a bullet, no one agreed \u2013 not even his closest colleagues.He was clearly being ostracized, but he could not understand why \u2013 until one of his old friends told him, \u201cSelling to you would offend Han Xiao. No one would want to risk being blacklisted by him, seeing as to how he probably will come up with more good stuff. Who would help you at their own expense?\u201dHis words served a wake-up call to Korat. To think that it was the complete opposite back then \u2013 for money, he chose to trample over Han Xiao.Unfortunately, it was too late for regrets now.\u2026Meanwhile, in a workroom, Luo Xuan opened up a box before him to reveal 20 incendiary bullets. He had gotten someone to help him acquire them.Han Xiao had only blacklisted Korat and his team, not Luo Xuan. In Han Xiao\u2019s eyes, Luo Xuan had simply been doing his job as part of the research department in trying to reverse engineer his blueprints. At the very least, he did not seem as vile to Han Xiao as Korat did. Now that the research department was being kept under watch, there was no need for Han Xiao to worry about them.Moreover, Luo Xuan was also just support staff like him.However, this inexplicably caused Luo Xuan to become resentful of Han Xiao.\u201cd.a.m.n you, Han Xiao! Do you look down on me so much that you ignore me\u203d\u201dWhat he did not realize was that Han Xiao did not look down on him \u2013 instead, Han Xiao had never even seen him before.To avoid offending Han Xiao, the research director lay down an order preventing anyone from researching Han Xiao\u2019s bullets, but Luo Xuan naturally did not care, and he still thought of himself as superior to Han Xiao, and that he could easily reproduce the bullets \u2013 like with the Retractable Knife.\u201cIf I succeed, the higher-ups will definitely value me even more! I cannot afford to fail!\u201d The more Luo Xuan thought about it, the more perfect his plan seemed to himself.Taking a deep breath to prepare himself, Luo Xuan began to work at opening the bullet up. What he needed to do was examine the properties of the incendiary agent inside.Clank!Luo Xuan managed to extract the bullet case.The next step would be to open it up and extract the contents with a special suction tube to prevent friction.Carefully, he opened the bullet case.\u201cSuccess! Now I will just have to a.n.a.lyze-\u201dSuddenly, a blazing light filled up his entire vision.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Thick, black smoke filled up the entire research department as the research staff headed for safety.The sprinklers quickly put a stop to the spreading fire, but many doc.u.ments were ruined, and sparks were flying out of some computers and machines. The walls and ceiling were filled with black burn marks.\u201cWhat could have caused the fire?\u201d wondered the heartbroken research director aloud as he looked at the ruins.Security soon arrived to begin inspection.\u201cThe fire started from the workshop!\u201dLuo Xuan \u2013 his entire body soaking wet, and his entire face black \u2013 was supported out by the guards. All his hair had been burnt off, including his eyebrows, and he looked just like a soy egg \u2013 or rather, a century egg.Being able to react quickly, in addition to having a fire extinguisher nearby, saved him from further disfigurement.He had not expected the incendiary agent to be gaseous. It combusted the very second it came into contact with the atmosphere.Luo Xuan had clearly overestimated himself.\u201cI\u2019ve lost\u2026\u201d he grudgingly admitted.\u201cWhat have you done\u203d\u201d yelled the research director.One of the security guards opened his hand to reveal a few bullet cases. Although they were blackened, they were clearly crimson before.\u201cThis is the bullet case of the High-explosive Gunpowder. Your man was trying to a.n.a.lyze it.\u201dThe research director was instantly livid. Speechless, he could only point a finger at Luo Xuan in his rage.\u2018Are my orders something to be taken lightly of\u203d\u2018When the higher-ups investigate, this will all fall onto me again!\u2018You b.a.s.t.a.r.ds!\u2019Gu Hui also arrived at the scene. His face darkened upon seeing the wreckage.\u201cExplain yourself.\u201dThe research director yanked Luo Xuan before him and said through gritted teeth, \u201cHe did this all by himself!\u201dGu Hui looked at Luo Xuan plainly.\u201cDo you have anything to say for yourself?\u201dLuo Xuan lowered his head. He had thought that he would succeed and earn merit, but instead, he had now ended up disobeying orders on top of causing damages to the headquarters. This was probably the end of his career.\u201cYou will go back to logistics,\u201d stated Gu Hui coldly before turning around to leave.Luo Xuan shuddered. Before, he had left the logistics department on bad terms. A return did not bode well for him.True enough, when he arrived at the logistics department, his past colleagues all ignored him when they saw him. Even the logistics director, who had had high hopes for him in the past, was unwilling to see him. He only sent a secretary to inform Luo Xuan of his new position in a small team.If only he had not been so narrow-minded and full of himself, he would not have lost his path and ended up like this.Although he deeply regretted his actions now, it was too late.\u201cI was immature\u2026\u201d lamented a bitter Luo Xuan.\u2026Han Xiao was shocked to hear of what Luo Xuan had done from Feng Jun \u2013 not even he, the creator himself, would dare to mess around and open up a completed incendiary bullet.\u2018That guy\u2019s got some b.a.l.l.s.\u2019However, the matter was inconsequential to him. All along, Luo Xuan had just been a name in the back of his mind.Soon after, Zhang Wei\u2019s armored suit was delivered to his workroom. Upon observation, it was a truly crude prototype._____________________Combatant Armored Suit (Prototype)Type: Modular Mini-Power SuitGrade: WhiteStats: 682/1400 Durability, 35 DefensePower Level: 86Energy Level: 250/250Prerequisite(s): 42 STR, 48 ENDBonus Stats: -10 DEXHeight: 1.95mWeight: 370kgControl Method: Manual (Full)Energy Source: ElectricityCombat Consumption Rate: 5 energy/minCore Power: 125/130_____________________Frame Module:Spring-piston Absorber (reduces load by 65%)Power: 20_____________________Right Arm Module: Large Caliber Tri-barreled Machine GunDamage: 105-125Firing Rate: 5 shots/second (per barrel)Maximum Firing Rate: 8 shots/second for 5 seconds (per barrel)Magazine Capacity: 30 (+120 in the ammo belt)Power Level: 75Power: 35_____________________Left Arm Module: Large Caliber Tri-barreled Machine Gun_____________________Right Wrist Module: KnifeDamage: 12-15Power Level: 9Power: 5_____________________Leg Modules: Spring Boosters+15 SpeedConsumes 1 energy/minute when active.Power: 30_____________________Attachment: Infrared VisionPower: N/AAttachment: Six-tipped s.h.i.+eld (reduces incoming damage by 12%)Power: N/A_____________________Tooltip: This abomination is a disgrace to all armored suits in the world!\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afHan Xiao had to agree. It was indeed an ugly piece of work \u2013 it looked like someone had just decided to weld a few sheets of metal together.Low power aside, it did not even run on an integrated circuit! No wonder Zhang Wei always fired volleys instead of precise shots \u2013 there was no aiming system in place! An armored suit with an integrated circuit would be able to receive and transmit crucial information to its user during a fight.Also, the only automated part of the suit was its legs! Other than the legs, the entire suit\u2019s framework had to be operated manually, which explained why Zhang Wei had not used the s.h.i.+eld \u2013 he wasn\u2019t able to at all!\u201cCome on, even though it\u2019s a prototype, at least show it some love, you a.s.sholes!\u201dAs Han Xiao examined the suit with crossed arms, numerous ideas began to pop up. However, it was still too soon to rush upgrades. Some of the tweaks he wanted to make required knowledge that he did not currently possess. Hence, after performing just some simple maintenance, Han Xiao got Feng Jun to help him return it to Zhang Wei.Currently, Han Xiao\u2019s primary concern was regarding the three successfully destroyed Germinal bases, and what information he should disclose to Stardragon next.The three captured bases were indeed the only ones located within Stardragon. If Stardragon wanted to continue its a.s.sault on the Germinal Organization, they would have to take the fight to a foreign nation. While relations among the Six Nations were truly not that amicable, no one really wanted to continue fighting since a lot of resources had already been depleted during the transition to the new era. Each nation was still counting their losses.Hence, Stardragon would have to seek the cooperation of the other nations, and that would be complicated to accomplish. Han Xiao himself would also have to be directly involved as he was the key source of information.The question was whether the higher-ups would let Han Xiao leave the Western Capital.Suddenly, the phone rang. It was Feng Jun, who said gravely, \u201cHan Xiao, Germinal operatives are on the move. They seem to know that you are with us and are trying to track you down.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dHan Xiao had expected this. He had instructed Li Ya Lin to use the mecha arm while knowing that Hila would recognize it.\u201cRest a.s.sured. There will be men keeping watch around you 24/7.\u201dThe Western Capital was Division 13\u2019s territory. Even if the Germinal Organization were to find out Han Xiao\u2019s exact location, they would probably not be able to touch him \u2013 not easily, at least.Still, as there were several superhuman a.s.sa.s.sins amongst their ranks, Han Xiao knew that he could not afford to let his guard down.\u2018Looks like I should prepare some defensive measures.\u2019\u201cHelp me draw two Berserk Eagle handguns from the armory.\u201dThe Berserk Eagle was a close-range, large-caliber handgun. It had an effective range of 30m, where its power was comparable to that of a sniper rifle.It would work wonders with Han Xiao\u2019s [Strafe].However, Han Xiao would need more.Over the past three days, Han Xiao had gained 100,000 experience points from crafting gunpowder. He decided to spend 40,000 to raise [Basic Refining] to Lv. 5, fulfilling the requirements for crafting the [Platinum Alloy].\u201cIt\u2019s time for upgrades.\u201d\u2026A few days ago, upon learning of the appearance of the mecha arm in the hands of a Stardragon agent, the boss came to the conclusion that it must have been Zero who leaked information on their three bases to Stardragon.\u201cIs he a psychic?\u201dThe boss found it hard to explain how Zero could have accessed top secret information. In fact, he had not once suspected Zero. Instead, he had mistakenly a.s.sumed that there was a traitor amongst his ranks. As a result, he had even wrongly killed one commander.His mind flashed back to a month ago, where Zero had declared his intention to destroy them.The boss clenched his fist.\u201cI may have underestimated you, but you are still a n.o.body \u2013 I don\u2019t believe that you possess more intel.\u201cPa.s.s down my order: recruit some wanderers to investigate Zero\u2019s trail in Stardragon. The Germinal Organization will reward those who find him!\u201cIf found, send Rosa to finish him off.\u201dRosa, like Hila, was a Germinal commander. She was an a.s.sa.s.sin.Each commander had their own specialty, but no one knew exactly how many commanders there were \u2013 not even most Germinal agents themselves.The boss gazed into the distance.\u2018Did you think that gaining Stardragon\u2019s protection would keep you safe?\u2018Naive!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Han Xiao had to spend quite a sum of money to purchase enough of them.After making the alloy, Han Xiao used it to craft a Retractable Knife and another Lightweight Mecha Arm.

The Berserk Eagle had a slight longer barrel than the average handgun, and it was much more destructive at close range. Upon testing, they proved capable of blowing a chunk out of a test dummy\u2019s head. The recoil was also extremely powerful, but Han Xiao possessed enough strength to tame the beasts.They would serve as his protection against a.s.sa.s.sinations alongside the Platinum Retractable Knife. Han Xiao also altered his clothes to conceal several magazines \u2013 two magazines of incendiary ammo and four regular ones. For regular ammo, Han Xiao chose to use steel core bullets as their penetrative power suited the Berserk Eagle well.Han Xiao brought up the information tab to check his remaining experience points. He currently had close to 200,000.In Version 1.0 Galaxy, it was thought for a while that investing experience points into skills instead of leveling was optimal.The reasoning for this was that, since the death cost was low around Lv. 20 to 30, it was an optimal level range to grind PVP. Unfortunately, it had all been someone\u2019s ploy.When the system congratulatory message popped up to celebrate the first Lv. 60 player in Version 1.0, the entire server was first stunned, then outraged. It was none other than the same guy who had advocated the theory of self-capping one\u2019s level.Han Xiao decided to spend 180,000 experience points to level up three times._____________________[Novice Technician] has leveled up! +30 Energy, +1 DEX, +1 END, +1 INT, +3 una.s.signed stat points, + 1 talent point.[Novice Technician] has leveled up! +30 Energy, +1 DEX, +1 END, +1 INT, +3 una.s.signed stat points, + 1 talent point.[Novice Technician] has leveled up! +30 Energy, +1 DEX, +1 END, +1 INT, +3 una.s.signed stat points, + 1 talent point.\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afBesides these newly acquired stats, Han Xiao had also gained 30 Energy from regular use of the [Energy Training Technique] over the past few days, so his Energy was now Lv. 4 at a total of 280._____________________Lv. 4 Energy (200):+3 STR, +4 DEX, +5 END, +4 INT, + 150 Max Stamina, +4% Crafting Speed, +4% Machinery Power\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afIn total, Han Xiao gained +10 STR, +10 DEX, +14 END, +8 INT, +320 Max Stamina, +10% Crafting Speed, and +10% Machinery Power from Energy bonuses, which made up nearly a third of his total stats.Initially, Han Xiao had invested quite a number of points into STR and END in order to ensure his survival during his escape from the Germinal laboratory, but now, as he could focus solely on INT, which was all that a Technician needed, he immediately spent all 9 una.s.signed stat points on INT, reaching a total of 58 points.Now Lv. 24, and also a Lv. 4 Novice Technician, Han Xiao\u2019s combat power was at 160 ona.\u201cAt this rate I should be able to remain much stronger than the first batch of players for a while\u2026\u201dSuddenly, a notification sound played.When Han Xiao opened up the notification, he received a huge shock._____________________Beta testing has been scheduledRetrieving Information\u2026Retrieval CompleteBeta Test Period: 12 Days\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u201cBeta testing\u203d\u201cI completely forgot about that!\u201dHan Xiao vaguely remembered that the beta test had been a two-day event. As time was accelerated by six times in Galaxy, that translated to exactly 12 days.The beta test period was extremely short, and only had 30,000 slots. Most of them were taken up by big corporations and gaming organizations, leaving only a fraction to be distributed through a lottery system. Han Xiao was not lucky enough to win a slot.From his memory, the beta test was held only a week before official launch, translating to about over a month inside the game. Yet, on the system information interface the countdown still displayed 130 days!\u201cCould it be that the in-game clock runs differently when service is down? That must be it! Each version update takes two or three days to go live, but between updates years could have pa.s.sed by in-game. It makes sense!\u201dHan Xiao rubbed his chin with his fingers and realized that a beard was growing. He had been in Galaxy for over half a year. He suddenly remembered a controversial version update from his past life \u2013 \u2018The Chosen Ones\u2019. This version update was unlike any other. Other updates typically came with world-changing events and incidents, but this one had completely lacked a theme. No one could make sense of the version\u2019s t.i.tle, nor its contents.Suddenly, the interface lit up, giving Han Xiao a start._____________________NPC functions unlocked!Discussion board unlocked!\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u201cNPC functions? What\u2019s this?\u201dAs it did not come with any further information, it seemed that Han Xiao would have to figure it out on his own. In any case, it was likely to do with the ways that NPCs interacted with players, such as handing out quests, buying and selling goods, and imparting skills.In the beta test, the 30,000 players were distributed across over a dozen planets. Han Xiao was not too concerned over this, as one or two thousand players per planet would not really have much of an impact. Official release would be when all h.e.l.l broke loose.Nonetheless, interacting with some of them would be a good opportunity to learn more about his NPC functions.The discussion board, on the other hand, was something that Han Xiao was already familiar with. It was an internal forum that players frequented a lot \u2013 especially while waiting to revive.\u201cTo think that we would meet again. It\u2019s probably only unlocked now due to the time being synced up.\u201dThe b.u.t.ton for the discussion board was located on a corner of the interface. Upon opening it up, Han Xiao was greeted by an empty forum. The account name on the top right of the window indicated \u2018Guest\u2019, and the registration b.u.t.ton was grayed out.Han Xiao clicked it out of curiosity._____________________Attempting to Connect to the Dive-capsule\u2026No Player DetectedRegistration Failed\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afIt took a few moments for Han Xiao to understand why \u2013 accounts for the discussion board could only be created with the unique ID of the user\u2019s dive-capsule. This rule was implemented as a measure against trolls.\u201cWell, I can\u2019t create a forum account, but at least I can access the forum for reading!\u201dThere were a million questions on Han Xiao\u2019s mind regarding the state of his existence.

The warmth of the sun felt just like it was real and so too did the earthly smell of the soil. When he looked down to see his two arms, he was shocked by how realistic they looked and felt.It was a small field, and Frenzied Sword noticed that there were hundreds of other players around him; they, too, were curiously examining their \u2018bodies\u2019. Each player\u2019s name was displayed on the top of his head.Following the mini-guide shown during character creation, Frenzied Sword opened up the character information window. It displayed that he was Lv. 1 and also showed the default starting equipment that he was equipped with: a s.h.i.+rt, a pair of pants, and a pair of shoes. They did not come with any stat bonuses.\u201cd.a.m.n it, I can\u2019t strip!\u201dA fellow player nearby was causing a commotion. He appeared to be trying to remove his pants unsuccessfully.\u2018What the h.e.l.l are you even trying to do that for?\u2019The alarmed Frenzied Sword decided that moving away would be a good idea.Frenzied Sword was a professional gamer, albeit not so well known. Aspiring professional gamer would be more accurate. He had only recently joined the scene, so he was, by all counts, a newcomer. He had been keeping a close eye on Galaxy ever since learning of its promising e-sports prospects, so when the beta test was announced, he immediately asked his a.s.sociation for a slot.As the saying goes, the early bird gets the worm. Frenzied Sword was determined to succeed in this new game.Conversation broke out amongst the crowd.\u201cThis is so realistic!\u201d\u201cWhat should we do now?\u201d\u201cAny hints?\u201dSuddenly, a white-bearded, fearsome looking white elderly man appeared before the crowd and bellowed, \u201cAll of you outsiders! If you want to eat, then find yourself a job! Loafers are not welcome in our village! The crops in our farms need picking, and the shops to the south need workers! As long as you work hard, you will have food to eat!\u201dBeside the players\u2019 health bars were two other bars for hunger and thirst. Upon reaching 0, the player would gain a [Hungry] or [Thirsty] debuff that would cause their health to drop.Frenzied Sword \u2018examined\u2019 the old man._____________________Based on your level, you acquired the following information:Xander \u2013 Big Horn Mountain Village ChiefLevel: ?Stats: ?[I am your village chief now.]Danger Level: Middle\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afPlayers had an \u2018examine\u2019 function that allowed them to learn an NPC\u2019s name and information. However, the amount of information obtained differed based on their level difference.\u201cThe weapons store sells guns, bullets, and other weapons, the marketplace is where people sell food and water, and the amphitheater is where you will find mounts to rent. If you wish to leave, there is a train station several kilometers north of here. If you wish to learn a craft, the blacksmith\u2019s or the tailor\u2019s are good choices\u2026\u201dXander\u2019s explanation filled in the new players on their situation. There were only a few sub-cla.s.ses and one combat cla.s.s \u2013 [Novice Hunter] \u2013 available in this village, and they cost money to learn.Frenzied Sword opened up the map to find it mostly shrouded in fog. Before he explored the planet, he would have to first earn money.\u201cIs it possible to take on hunting quests straight away?\u201dFrenzied Sword recognized the man, SliceYouUp, as the guild leader of the guild \u2018Kill-all\u2019. His IGN was telling of his personality.Upon hearing his question, Xander burst out into laughter.\u201cYou weaklings think that you stand a chance against wild beasts? See those mountains over there? If you are not afraid to die then by all means try, but it looks to me like none of you are even strong enough to even take on a Silver Hyena.\u201dThe players looked towards where the old man pointed to see a range of forested mountains in the distance. Some of the mountains stood so tall that the clouds seemed to encircle them like huge, coiling pythons, creating an extremely scenic view that stole the breaths of the players. The graphics were incredibly life-like. Galaxy was clearly ahead of the compet.i.tion.Refusing to believe the old man, SliceYouUp took his party to purchase some basic equipment with the starting money of $100 and headed for the mountains.It did not take long for them to return.SliceYouUp, in particular, was shaken up quite badly. The first beast that he had encountered was a gorilla larger than an adult man. As soon as he raised his dagger, the gorilla threw its excrement at him, the force of which blew up his head. And it only got better. He resp.a.w.ned in the middle of a stampede.\u2018Why the h.e.l.l would that freaking monkey know how to throw its excrement\u203d Must everything be so realistic\u203d\u2019For some reason, the foul smell still lingered around even after resp.a.w.ning. The developers were definitely trolling when they decided to add in this smell.\u201cWTF, aren\u2019t those monsters too strong?\u201d\u201cThey didn\u2019t even stand a chance!\u201d\u201cHe only managed to do 1 damage!!\u201d\u201cd.a.m.n it, I dropped the knife I just bought!\u201dThe amount of experience lost upon death depended on the character level. The resp.a.w.n time also increased with each death. For the first death, resp.a.w.ning only took 10 seconds, but it would take a minute for the second, five for the third, and half an hour for the fourth, increasing up to a whopping six days.Death was very costly in the Galaxy. Each character could also only die up to 10 times every day (6 days in-game). Reaching this limit would result in a character lock until the next day. It was an anti-addiction system that proved to be more effective than the \u2018exhaustion system\u2019 of certain mobile games.The Kill-all party\u2019s sad state immediately deterred the other players from thinking of hunting monsters. They quickly dispersed to find work to do.As Xander watched over the buzz, he stroked his beard with a smile.\u201cThe reward is so low! I only got $50!\u201d\u201cLeveling is so slow! It took me half an hour of quests just to earn enough experience to level up!\u201d\u201cEverything feels so real!\u201d\u201cI hit myself to test, and blood actually came out! Amazing!\u201d\u201cSomething is wrong with you dude.\u201dThe start was not as easy as the players had expected; everyone was at least put on a level playing field. Furthermore, there was an extremely high degree of freedom for them to choose what they wanted to do. As the players went about their quests, many started to find themselves enjoying the game. Quests were tiring yet felt so fulfilling.\u2018Today is a blessed day!\u2019\u2026\u201cAre you a pro gamer, too?\u201dFrenzied Sword recognized the trio walking towards him. They were also famous pros: Twinkle Fried Rice, a genius lauded for his mechanical skills, Sleepy Winter, a super veteran of e-sports, and Rainy Kim, a female idol gamer with tens of millions of fans.In the face of these big G.o.ds of the gaming world, Frenzied Sword felt as though he had shrunk a few feet.\u201cIs something the matter?\u201dSleepy Winter laughed, replying, \u201cI was wondering \u2013 did you notice that the map sold in this town costs $3000?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The first group were casual gamers who won their spots from the lottery system, while the second group were professional gamers or prolific personalities for whom a certain number of spots were reserved for. As for the third group of beta testers, they bought their accounts from resellers.The casual gamer would only be interested in checking out the game, but the latter two shared the same reason for playing the beta: to get a head start.\u201cThis beta test will only last for twelve days in terms of game time. It\u2019s quite obvious that doing the beginner quests here is a waste of time, but you should have noticed that we are not forced to do them at all. What we should do is to take advantage of our head start and start exploring this world! We can be the first to discover all of this planet\u2019s secrets and treasures.\u201dFrenzied Sword nodded slowly.As time was indeed limited, to dawdle around in a beginner zone did seem like a waste of precious time. Questing here would certainly give them a level advantage over the newer players, but that would be all.In contrast, exploring seemed like a more promising \u2013 and definitely more fun \u2013 option!\u201cBut why would you tell me all this?\u201d he asked.Sleepy Winter laughed.\u201cThose big guilds will definitely realize this soon enough. The problem is that they have the advantage in numbers, so they will easily be able to buy the map. What do you say to joining our party? It will definitely make things easier.\u201dFrenzied Sword accepted the invitation without hesitation.\u201cHow are we splitting the cost?\u201d asked Twinkle Fried Rice.\u201cSince I suggested it, I\u2019ll contribute more,\u201d replied Sleepy Winter.\u201cI don\u2019t like to owe people, so I\u2019ll contribute a thousand,\u201d added Rainy Kim coldly. \u201cMy part\u2019s settled.\u201dShe immediately turned around and left to earn money from quests.Sleepy Winter rubbed his nose bitterly.\u2018We\u2019ve known each other for a few years already, why won\u2019t you give me a chance\u2026\u2019\u2026With the money they earned from questing, the four of them were able to procure the map the following day. Obtaining it cleared some of the fog on their maps, and it also provided basic information on the planet\u2019s current situation. They learnt of the Six Nations, the Germinal Organization, and the Revolutionary Army, amongst other factions.\u201cAccording to this, the two biggest powers are the Six Nations and the Germinal Organization. The Six Nations seem to have quite a number of training schools and academies. It\u2019ll probably be easier to learn a main cla.s.s there. Let\u2019s see\u2026 seems like Stardragon isn\u2019t a bad choice.\u201dBig Horn Mountain was situated in Stardragon, and the public train station was not too far away.Sleepy Winter nodded.\u201cWe don\u2019t have much time. It\u2019ll take about 3 days for us to reach the capital.\u201dFrenzied Sword groaned inwardly. He was starting to regret having joined the party. However, he knew that it was too late for him to chicken out.\u2026The journey could not be skipped, so the party had to sit through the entire 3 days. There were some quests available on the train, but overall, it was not a pleasant trip at all. They did, however, have the forums to stifle their boredom. On the forums, players were posting about their experiences on the different starting zones.It provided them with much amus.e.m.e.nt \u2013 except for Frenzied Sword, who could not stop worrying about the pa.s.sing time.After three days, the train arrived at the Western Capital.Upon arriving at the great metal fences, each of them received a system message, alerting them of a new explored location.\u201cSo, discovering places gives experience too, huh?\u201d\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d gasped Twinkle Fried Rice as he looked around.Everything was extremely realistic \u2013 down to the way that people were casting him strange looks.The group proceeded to the security checkpoint where they were scanned for weapons.After pa.s.sing the check, the guard gave them each a temporary ID card, and they received a system message notifying them that they had unlocked reputation with Stardragon._____________________StardragonReputation: 0Current Relations.h.i.+p: Neutral (Temporary Citizen)\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u201cShall we continue as a group or go our own ways?\u201d asked Sleepy Winter.\u201cI\u2019ll follow you,\u201d replied Twinkle Fried Rice immediately with a grin.

They exchanged a few more lines before Sleepy Winter finally turned to Frenzied Sword and asked, \u201cWhat about you?\u201dFrenzied Sword was furious at being so blatantly overlooked, but he understood that there was no point in forcing himself to tag along.\u201cNo- no need.\u201d He waved his hand and stammered, \u201cI prefer playing alone.\u201d\u201cAlright then, good luck!\u201dAs Frenzied Sword watched the trio of G.o.ds depart, he mumbled to himself, \u201cSooner or later, I\u2019ll become popular too!\u201dThe Western Capital was obviously a first-cla.s.s city. Here, there would definitely be plenty of opportunities for him to surpa.s.s them and become number one!Renewed with ambition, Frenzied Sword began to head off in another direction.Suddenly, he noticed a masked man watching him.Something about the way the man was looking at him seemed odd. As Frenzied Sword felt a chill run down his spine, he instinctively used the examine function._____________________Name: Han Xiao (?)Level: ?Stats: ????Danger Level: FatalPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even the armored security guard just now only had a \u2018high\u2019 danger level. This was his most dangerous encounter yet. Who exactly was this guy whose information was full of question marks\u203d\u201cShouldn\u2019t it be safe in the city? Will today be the first time that I die?\u201dSuddenly, the man spoke.\u201cExamining someone you just met? That\u2019s not very polite.\u201dFrenzied Sword gave a start.According to the official information, an NPC would know if it had been examined if it was over 30 levels higher than the player using the function.Han Xiao chuckled to himself. He had simply predicted Frenzied Sword\u2019s course of action.After learning of the beta test, Han Xiao had taken note of all the nearby starting zones on his map. The closest one was none other than Big Horn Mountain Village. It was only three days away, but Han Xiao did not want to leave the Western Capital as Germinal was actively looking for him.While keeping track of the influx of posts on the forums, Han Xiao came across a thread created by a player called Sleepy Winter. It was a post about the benefits of exploration.Han Xiao knew who Sleepy Winter was \u2013 a legendary pro gamer who was quite active in public forums. He liked to discuss strategies and create guides. He was a good man, handsome (beside the point), and naturally had a huge fan base. In the Chinese server, he had ranked consistently amongst the top 30. Han Xiao himself had only ever peaked at 47th, and during a period of time, he even fell out of the top 100. That lesson that he had learnt then was to stay away from girls (if you want to succeed).Once, he had shared his thoughts regarding this with the 28-year-old owner of the convenience store below his apartment building who he was on friendly terms with. The bachelor had laughed him off.\u201cCool story bro,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019d rather have a girl.\u201dTo which Han Xiao had replied, \u201cBut which girl would have you?\u201dThat was the day that Han Xiao lost his special discount at that store.The rankings were not based purely on combat. In Galaxy, there were all kinds of compet.i.tions apart from fighting \u2013 from treasure hunts to monster killing, and even races! As Han Xiao had taken on a number of revenge a.s.signments from other players, his combat ability was quite polished. Unfortunately, he had lacked in other areas \u2013 such as trash talking. He never forgot to practice it though.After reading the thread, Han Xiao had guessed that there would probably be a few players who would make it to the Western Capital. As such, over the past few days, he had spent some time keeping an eye out for any at the city entrance. He was able to spot the party of four easily as their names were \u2013 to Han Xiao\u2019s surprise \u2013 clearly displayed over their heads. Furthermore, three of their names were those of famous people.Han Xiao was not sure if the reason he could see their names was that he, too, had an interface.Nevertheless, it was a good thing. Just like how players could see the names of NPCs, Han Xiao could recognize them on sight.The reason that he had decided to make direct contact with a player was to test out his NPC functions.\u201cBrave adventurer, do you have time to help me?\u201dA standard line for a quest-giver.Frenzied Sword\u2019s eyes widened.\u2018To think that I\u2019d get the chance to interact with a high-level NPC this soon! This place is the best!\u2019He replied, as calmly as he could, \u201cI am willing to help.\u201d\u201cI need a loaf of bread. Can you find one?\u201dA confirmation window popped up as soon as Han Xiao asked the question._____________________Do you wish to issue a quest to Frenzied Sword?Y/N\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u2018It really works!\u2018Hold on, why are there automated prompts for an NPC function?

Now was not the time to worry about those questions.\u201cYes.\u201dA window appeared, along with some messages._____________________Please set the requirements and rewards for the mission.

On the left side was a drop-down menu that allowed Han Xiao to select the quest type. There were a ton of quest types to choose from.On the right side was for inputting the rewards. There were two lines: \u201cMaximum Reward\u201d, and \u201cDaily Reward Limit\u201d.The Maximum Reward was currently set to 11,600 experience points. It also seemed to be provided by the system, meaning that Han Xiao would not have need to fork any out of his own pocket.Daily Reward Limit referred to the amount of experience reward that Han Xiao could issue out in a day. Currently, it was fixed at five times the Maximum Reward (5 x 11600 = 58,000)._____________________Maximum Reward: 11600 expLevel: 24 (7200 exp)Rank: E (300 exp)Faction(s):Germinal \u2013 Hated (1000 exp)Division 13 \u2013 Neutral (400 exp)Myth Level: 0\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afAs Han Xiao tested the settings out, he discovered a limitation \u2013 if the current Maximum Reward did not meet the minimum amount required for a quest, he would not be able to issue it \u2013 a Rank A quest such as destroying the Germinal Organization would require a Rank A reward.Han Xiao\u2019s maximum reward of 11,600 meant that he could only issue E-rank quests. D-rank quests required a reward of at least 30,000 exp. The reward criteria also seemed to differ among the different quest types. No further messages popped up to explain this, so it seemed like Han Xiao would have to figure it out on his own through trial and error.Han Xiao tried to issue himself a quest, but it failed.\u201cIf only I could have some of that sweet experience\u2026\u201dAlthough he now had the ability to hand out experience like water, he himself was only earning about 20,000 to 30,000 exp a day. Of course, there was no way that he would help someone else.\u201cSeems like I could use this to my advantage though\u2026\u201d Han Xiao\u2019s eyes began to twinkle. It was possible to use this function to manipulate players into doing his bidding. After all, players would do any quest if the reward was high enough.Han Xiao suddenly had an epiphany. \u201cI have to increase my maximum reward!\u201dIn most games, it was the key, high-level NPCs who gave the hardest missions and the highest rewards. The quest function\u2019s system made perfect sense.Han Xiao issued a regular mission to Frenzied Sword.Frenzied Sword stared at the mission window with his mouth agape.\u2018What kind of high level NPC would ask for a loaf of bread and reward only $1\u203d\u2019\u201cHold on\u2026 he could just be testing me!\u201dFrenzied Sword recalled that in some of the games he had played before, there were indeed quests like this.The more he thought about it, the more likely it seemed to him, so Frenzied Sword whipped out all seven of the bread loaves he had in his possession and put them into Han Xiao\u2019s hands.\u201cThis is all the bread I have,\u201d he added sincerely.Han Xiao was stunned.\u2018What\u2019s going on? Are gamers these days so excessive with doing quests?\u2019Nonetheless, a completion dialogue popped up when Han Xiao received the bread.There were too many quest types to test out, so Han Xiao decided to try out the other NPC functions.There was an icon in the shape of a person beside Frenzied Sword\u2019s name above his head. When Han Xiao focused on it, an RPG-style meter bar popped out. The bar was half red, half green, and with a needle at the center.[Do you want to adjust Favorability with Frenzied Sword?]\u201cI can even do this\u203d\u201d Han Xiao was a bit scared to try. What if changing this also adjusted his thoughts?\u201cIf I set favorability to maximum, will I\u2026 turn gay on the spot?\u201cNo no no no no \u2013 I can\u2019t risk that.\u201dHan Xiao decided to test it by moving the needle slightly left to reduce favorability by five.

To him, all of these were \u2018G.o.dly equips\u2019 that would allow him to surpa.s.s any other player!However, his expression changed when he looked at their price tags. It was as if someone had poured a bucket of cold water over him.Even the cheapest of them, the [Incendiary Bullets], cost a hundred dollars each, while the [Lightweight Mecha Arm] required 10 favorability!\u2018This is daylight robbery! And how am I supposed to gain favorability with this NPC when completing his quests reduces it instead\u203d\u2018No wonder this NPC\u2019s danger level is so high. It\u2019s definitely still too early to interact with him.\u2019But Frenzied Sword only knew true pain when he took a look at the Skill Shop.[Basic Combat], [Basic Shooting], [Submission]\u2026 the sight of these skills caused Frenzied Sword to start drooling\u2026 until he saw their prices.There was also a [Mechanic Cla.s.s Change Tome], and an array of Mechanic skills, but none of them were as eye-catching as the [Energy Training Technique]!\u201cG.o.dly skill!\u201dHan Xiao shook his head upon seeing Frenzied Sword\u2019s reaction.\u201cYou aren\u2019t a Technician, so you are unable to learn it.\u201dBy now, Han Xiao had already been solidified as a Secret NPC in Frenzied Sword\u2019s mind.\u2018If I can make him my teacher, I will definitely become rank 1 in no time!\u2018But\u2026 I really wanted to be a Pugilist\u2026\u2019That much was obvious from his in-game name.\u2018d.a.m.n it!

He obviously did not know that the skill was automatically given to all characters after the first advancement at Lv. 20.It wasn\u2019t that Han Xiao was trying to scam him, though. On the contrary, he had purposely set its cost at a whopping 10,000 exp and $3,000 just to make the shop look \u2018nicer\u2019. He had also placed a requirement of 10 favorability on it.\u201cOh right!\u201d Han Xiao quickly reverted Frenzied Sword\u2019s favorability back to 0, which caused him to immediately have the wrong idea.\u2018I must buy more things from him in order to increase favorability!\u2019Suddenly, the NPC began to walk away.\u201cWhere can I find you\u203d\u201d yelled a fl.u.s.tered Frenzied Sword after him.Han Xiao thought for a moment before handing him a piece of paper with the workshop\u2019s address on it.As Frenzied Sword watched him leave, he began to grow excited.\u2018This is my chance!\u2018With those skills and equips, I will definitely be able to climb to the top!\u2019Suddenly, his expression froze.\u2018I cannot let anyone find this Secret NPC!\u2019\u2026To a city as big as the Western Capital, a few beta testers were truly insignificant. For now, Han Xiao did not have any interest in them. The only reason he had come into contact with one was to test the NPC functions, and they certainly did not disappoint. Han Xiao was already thinking up ways to use them for scamming players.\u2018Frenzied Sword\u2026\u2019As Han Xiao thought back to the player from before, scenes from another lifetime began to play out in his mind.In his previous life, Frenzied Sword had been part of the first batch of professional \u2018Galaxy\u2019 players. As a Pugilist, he had taken the first compet.i.tive season by storm and won one of twenty-four spots to represent China internationally. This honor alone had cemented his status as a legend.Unfortunately, this future Pugilist legend was now a Mechanic.Han Xiao did not know exactly how Frenzied Sword\u2019s fortunes would play out in this timeline, but he did know one thing for sure: there would be no Frenzied Sword representing China in the near future.The only reason Han Xiao dared to choose the Mechanic cla.s.s was that he knew it would eventually become the strongest cla.s.s. However, this was something that no other player could know. In fact, the cla.s.s seemed so bad from the start that in Han Xiao\u2019s past life, numerous gamers, including pros, who chose the Mechanic cla.s.s would give up their characters and restart in another cla.s.s.\u2018I feel like I scammed him big time or something\u2026\u2019Han Xiao shook his head.\u2018Scam? Nah. He made the decision himself. On the contrary, if he can endure a few patches then he\u2019ll have me to thank\u2026 yeah\u2026\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even just by walking on the streets and interacting with NPCs, there were plenty of quests waiting to be triggered. From the money that they earned from these common quests such as \u201cFind the Missing Purse\u201d, \u201cRescue the Cat Stuck on the Tree\u201d, and other collection missions, it became clear to Sleepy Winter that exploring had been the right thing to do.Of course, as the Western Capital was a high-level zone, there were many places that the trio found inaccessible at their current level. Rainy Kim had been rejected at the gates of the Western Capital Academy while Twinkle Fried Rice had been held at gunpoint when he\u2019d tried to enter District 1, almost giving away his first death.The day after, the trio enlisted in the Stardragon Army, thereby gaining their first combat cla.s.s: [Recruit]. After a couple of training quests, their Faction changed from [Stardragon] to [Stardragon Army], and they earned the rank of [Private].Out of goodwill, Sleepy Winter messaged Frenzied Sword to let him know about being able to join the army, but Frenzied Sword only replied briefly in acknowledgement. For some reason, he seemed uninterested.What Sleepy Winter did not know was that Frenzied Sword was preoccupied with trying to win Han Xiao\u2019s favor.In order to test out the limitations of the quest function, Han Xiao entertained Frenzied Sword and issued him with all sorts of strange quests, such as [Kick Ten People in the a.s.s], [Strip a Patrolling Officer of His Shorts], [Remain in a Ballerina Pose for Five Minutes], and many more.From these tests, Han Xiao learned that as long as the maximum reward was able to match the quest\u2019s difficulty, he would be able to choose any type of quest scenario that he wanted.Meanwhile, things were a bit different on the receiving end. Frenzied Sword, who found himself only being a.s.signed crude and twisted quests, gradually began to develop a sense of fear toward Han Xiao.Nonetheless, he religiously completed all of the quests as the experience that Han Xiao rewarded him with was several times more than the standard reward. That alone was enough for him to ignore his own morals.The quests allowed him to level up rapidly, and he used the earnings themself to learn more basic skills from Han Xiao.The beta test might have been unexpected for Han Xiao, but overall, it did not do much to disrupt his plans. The beta players were simply too scattered and few in number to have much influence on their respective starting planets. Twelve days was not enough time for them to level up significantly.It would take longer for a breeze to develop into a storm.In the long haul, however, the influx of players would be like a gold mine to Han Xiao.Helping to strengthen Frenzied Sword was only the first step. Soon, his progress would definitely catch the attention of the other players and his own a.s.sociation. His a.s.sociation would certainly capitalize on it and release information on this \u2018secret NPC\u2019 in order to gain popularity. That was when the money and experience would start pouring in for Han Xiao. Frenzied Sword might have thought he was hogging Han Xiao to himself, but he was actually dancing in the palm of his hand.\u2026[Official Launch Countdown: 126 Days 11 Hours 32 Minutes]Aside from crafting [Incendiary Bullets], Han Xiao spent most of his free time browsing the forums.Although it was usually buzzing with discussion and players would frequent it while their characters were dead or had set up shop, there were only beta players posting now.\u201cThe women on Aquamarine are so beautiful!\u201d\u201cUrgently looking for party members to fight the Sand Bandits.

Some parties also used the forums as a means to record and share their progress.There were over a dozen beginner planets of various civilizations available in the beta\u2014magical civilizations, scientific civilizations, and religious civilizations, to name a few. The societal structure of each planet also varied.The most popular planet seemed to be Planet Winterfrost, which was ruled by the void demon race. The planet also served as an outpost for the Destruction Army, whose aim was to \u2018destroy all civilizations\u2019. In Han Xiao\u2019s past life, they were an enemy who had given him quite a headache.As Han Xiao refreshed the forum page, a new thread caught his attention.\u201cFirst B-cla.s.s quest!\u201dHan Xiao narrowed his eyes. He recalled that the first B-cla.s.s mission had only appeared after the official launch. How could someone have unlocked such a high cla.s.s mission during the beta test?Curious, he entered the thread to see that it was already erupting with discussion.\u201cWho are you trying to fool?

Why is there only a quest name but no quest information?\u201d\u201cNice try, clown. Who would want to share their quest information with you.\u201d\u201cIt must be super hard. I\u2019m still at the beginner zone. Does anyone know how to get out?\u201d\u201cThe poster is the official account of the Throne of G.o.ds guild. They\u2019re legit. It should be true.\u201d\u201cDoes anyone know which planet this is?\u201d\u201cAll of you are noobs.\u201d\u201cSorry, my dog ran over my keyboard.\u201d\u2026Han Xiao chuckled. In his nostalgia, he continued reading through all the banter before finally checking out the contents of the original post. There was only a cropped screenshot of a quest name._____________________B-cla.s.s Quest: [Investigate Zero]\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afHan Xiao scrolled up to check the poster\u2019s name.\u2018Throne of G.o.ds?\u2019The Throne of G.o.ds was a prestigious guild that boasted a line-up of renowned gamers. They were so big that they even had their own line of goods.In his previous life, Han Xiao had once taken up an a.s.signment to strip their leader and take pictures of him in various embarra.s.sing poses. He had then posted them on the forums with the t.i.tle: \u201cShocking! Why would the leader of the Throne of G.o.ds\u2026\u201d and charged a fee for viewing. While Han Xiao had earned his money, he had also ended up being chased around by the entire guild for an entire month.\u2018Ah, I miss player killing\u2026\u2019 Han Xiao sighed as he turned around to look at Frenzied Sword, causing him to freeze up.Han Xiao shook his head.If things went as they had previously, the Throne of G.o.ds would join the Germinal faction to become the biggest player guild on their side. It was already looking likely.Germinal must be h.e.l.lbent on getting him this time, for even beta players to be able to acquire the mission to look for him.For the average player, it would be impossible to evade the notice of Division 13 while trying to locate Han Xiao by themselves. Normally, it would take a large amount of people to even have a chance of succeeding. However, the Throne of G.o.ds did not seem to lack manpower.As he considered the situation, Han Xiao finally decided on which Germinal base to act upon next.\u2026The Throne of G.o.ds guild had 15 players in the beta test. It was a team of core members led by both the leader and the vice-leader. Before the beta test started, they had already decided to list science as a preference.Their reasoning was simple\u2014since the world of Galaxy had a \u2018galactic\u2019 setting, science would definitely be a core driving force of the game. As such, they were all able to start together on Aquamarine and had also quickly purchased a map to begin exploring.The leader, Jupiter, was the one who decided to join the Germinal Organization. Their starting zone had also been close to a Germinal base.Jupiter thought that the Germinal Organization was probably the strongest faction on the planet as they able to stand strong against all of the nations on their own. Choosing them had nothing to do with favoring their ideology or anything like that. After all, their only priority was to get stronger.And reality did not betray their expectations. After joining Germinal, they were brought to the Dark Crow Valley Base where they underwent tough training to become low level grunts.The biggest gain that they received there, however, was none other than the B-cla.s.s quest, [Investigate Zero].The only information provided by the quest was that the target, Zero, was currently residing within Stardragon.At present, the 15 members were having a top-secret meeting to discuss how they would complete the quest.\u201cThis is our first B-cla.s.s quest,\u201d said Jupiter in a low voice. \u201cAs there doesn\u2019t seem to be fighting involved, with our level, we have a good chance of succeeding. The rewards are extremely good. With them, we will definitely be able to become the number one guild!\u201d\u201cAll we know is that Zero is in the country, but Stardragon is just too big,\u201d added Poseidon, a core member of the guild. \u201cThe beta test period is too short, so I think that we should only aim to complete the quest after official launch. Now, we should just do some preliminary investigation.\u201dEveryone nodded in agreement.\u201cThe quest information only tells us that Zero is an enemy of the Germinal Organization. If we manage to kill him, will there be a bonus reward?\u201d\u201cNice thinking, as expected of our leader.\u201d\u201cBut that would most likely be A-cla.s.s difficulty,\u201d pointed out Poseidon.\u201cThere\u2019s no impossible quest in a game. We just have to find the way,\u201d answered Jupiter matter-of-factly. \u201cThe official launch is one week after the end of this beta test. During this period of time, we will also have to discuss the matter with the rest of the guild.\u201d\u201cIn any case,\u201d added s.h.i.+va, the vice-leader, \u201cwith the backing of our gaming organization, we are the ones with the highest chance of completing this quest.\u201d\u201cThat is true,\u201d agreed Jupiter.\u201cIt would be faster if we made use of the other players,\u201d suggested Poseidon.Jupiter\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cGood idea. Let\u2019s release Zero\u2019s face and put up a reward for any valuable leads.\u201dRich guilds had their way of doing things.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If only I could find Zero\u2026\u2019The reward on Zero\u2019s wanted poster was extremely alluring, but Frenzied Sword knew that as he was operating alone, it would be like trying to search for a needle in a haystack.While it might have been a pity, it did not bother him too much. Frenzied Sword\u2019s eyes filled up with fire as he took another look at Han Xiao.\u2018As long as I latch onto this guy, I will level up faster than anyone!\u2019Initially, performing all the strange quests that Han Xiao gave him did give him a sense of aversion. However, he gradually discovered that they not were that bad after all\u2014at the very least, they were interesting to do. Compared to hunting monsters, running around to carry out these \u2018errands\u2019 was much simpler. Of course, this came at the expense of his morality.One day, he realized that his mind was becoming more open, and he had an epiphany: \u2018shame is but an obstacle to human evolution!\u2019\u2018Me, a pervert? No no no, I have simply transcended! I have found the way!\u2019\u201cDoes that guy like you or something?\u201d asked a bemused Lu Qian as she pointed at Frenzied Sword. He was staring at Han Xiao dreamily from the entrance of the workshop.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHe seems pretty sincere. Why don\u2019t you give him a chance?\u201d she teased, giggling.It was the first time that she had spoken normally to Han Xiao since the misunderstanding.Han Xiao rolled his eyes and reached out to tickle her, causing her to yell out and dodge, startled. Hugging her sides with crossed arms, Lu Qian watched Han Xiao closely with puppy eyes in antic.i.p.ation of his next attack.Her grandfather\u2019s attempts at playing matchmaker had initially caused her much headache. However, she soon discovered that there was no cause for concern as Han Xiao was not particularly interested in her. To be more specific, he did not even seem to be interested in women at all! Although this eased her worries, it also raised other concerns.A woman\u2019s heart is unfathomable. Pay her attention and she might become wary of you, but neglecting her won\u2019t do either.Unfortunately, one\u2019s looks also play an important factor. If you are good looking enough, you won\u2019t have to worry about it.Lu Qian\u2019s casual attire was revealing a tantalizing view of her front, but it did nothing to stir Han Xiao\u2019s heart. Having been working for up to 15 hours almost every day recently, crafting had become the only thing that he could think about.Sometimes, he even found himself designing guns and weapons in his dreams! And the scary part was that once, when he woke up, he realized that the designs were all practical! This served as a wake-up call to Han Xiao, and he would think back to fond times with Mei Mei, Mei Mei, Mei Mei, and a dozen or so more ex-girlfriends to regain his senses. (These names all sound the same, but they are different characters in Chinese)A man may die, but he must go down with his bird.Han Xiao ignored Frenzied Sword. By his calculations, the beta test would end in a day. The only reason Han Xiao had chosen to make contact with a player was to test the NPC functions.Suddenly, the interface lit up._____________________You have triggered the sudden quest: [a.s.sa.s.sination]!Quest Hint: The a.s.sa.s.sin is closing in!Completion Requirement: Survive the encounter.Quest Reward: Unknown\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afHan Xiao\u2019s face stiffened.The attack could happen at any moment!\u201cd.a.m.n it! Old Lu is not home now!\u201dFor the quest to have triggered despite Feng Jun and his men keeping watch in the neighborhood meant that the enemy definitely had some kind of special ability to invade without getting detected! There was a high chance that it was a superhuman!Han Xiao immediately dashed into his room to retrieve his equipment. It was vital to avoid dragging Old Lu and Lu Qian into the mix as it could jeopardize his plans to unlock the hidden scenario that he had come here for all along.Facing his attacker head-on was also more of his style.Frenzied Sword chased after Han Xiao.As they ran, Han Xiao began to feel like someone was watching him.The temperature of the air suddenly began to drop, causing Frenzied Sword to rub his arms in fear. Even he could feel the murderous intent in the air.As they walked down an alley, Han Xiao\u2019s sense of danger began to escalate from a tingle into an alarm.Darkness was already creeping upon the unknowing pair. Before they realized it, they were transported into a world devoid of sight and sound. Strangely, however, this pitch-black darkness made Han Xiao feel extremely safe and comfortable, as though he were back in his mother\u2019s womb. All that remained was an overwhelming allure to fall into eternal slumber.An illusion!Han Xiao forced his eyes open._____________________You are under the attack of an illusion. As your INT is higher than 50, you are able to resist its effects.\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afThe darkness around Han Xiao began to shatter as the effects of the illusion faded.As Han Xiao regained his senses, he discovered that there was a man standing five meters away with a gun pointed directly at him. The a.s.sa.s.sin was wearing a victorious smirk.Click.He pulled the trigger.Han Xiao\u2019s eyes widened.\u2018How am I supposed to dodge a shot at point blank range\u203d\u2019People often say that time slows down in the face of danger. What happened next was on a whole new level.In the face of imminent death, the world around Han Xiao suddenly began to slow down. The expression of panic on Han Xiao\u2019s face was replaced by a look of absolute coolness as his mind cast aside all unnecessary thoughts and emotions in order to process the situation.\u2018It\u2019s not over yet!\u2019The flow of time resumed.In the very instant that the bullet left the barrel, Han Xiao activated [Strafe], causing his entire body to seemingly fade and reappear.[Strafe]\u2019s effect allowed the user to move anywhere within a three-meter radius, but it was not exactly \u2018instant\u2019. While any movement using [Strafe] would seem extremely fast, moving a shorter distance would be even faster. Han Xiao was able to dodge the fatal shot by moving just 2 inches.The bullet grazed past the side of his face; all it caused was a searing sensation.The a.s.sa.s.sin\u2019s expression changed.\u2018How could he have dodged my sure-kill shot\u203d\u2019With his illusory powers, Norsa had successfully carried out over a hundred a.s.sa.s.sinations for the Germinal Organization. So far, it had not mattered whether his targets also had superpowers. However, according to the intel given to him, Zero should at most be at the level of an elite agent! How could someone who relied on machinery to fight be able to break free of his illusion\u203dThe intel was completely off the mark!As Han Xiao dodged, he whipped out both Berserk Eagles from his waist and activated [Overload] as he fired a volley of deafening shots. The recoil from the shots was so powerful that it caused his hands to shake.Bang! Bang! Bang!All of the shots found their mark on Norsa\u2019s chest.A perfect counterattack. Han Xiao\u2019s skillful usage of the Strafe might not have seemed difficult, but it would not have been possible to pull off without the wealth of combat experience that he possessed.Norsa began to stagger backwards. He had used energy to protect his body\u2014otherwise he would have been shredded to bits. Coughing up a mouthful of blood, he immediately summoned whatever energy he had left to back up and flee.Han Xiao narrowed his eyes and gave pursuit as he loaded a gun up with [Incendiary Ammo] to fire a shot in the direction of Norsa\u2019s escape.The ensuing sea of fire forced Norsa to stop in his tracks. Gritting his teeth, he turned around to face Han Xiao.Norsa\u2019s eyes began to glow with a mysterious seven-colored aura._____________________You are under the attack of an illusion.

Why is he unaffected\u203d\u2019Han Xiao strode forward to smack Norsa onto the ground with both guns. He then pressed them against his chest, pinning him to the ground.Bang!The sound of the shot was dull.As the incendiary bullet penetrated Norsa\u2019s body, his internal organs were immediately set ablaze. He began to flail his limbs wildly\u2014but only for a moment._____________________You have killed the Germinal Organization Executor, Norsa (Lv. 25 Superhuman), earning 7,500 exp.You have completed the sudden quest, [a.s.sa.s.sination].

Although not Han Xiao\u2019s style, it was always better to have more tools at one\u2019s disposal.Fortunately, Han Xiao had a.s.signed all his stat points to INT beforehand, otherwise things would have played out very differently.\u2018Germinal Organization, thanks for the gift!\u2019_____________________Do you wish to accept your reward now?Y/N\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u2018Yes.\u2019It was a \u2018use\u2019 item that could be stored within the interface, allowing Han Xiao to pull it out whenever he needed it.Meanwhile, Frenzied Sword was still trying to comprehend the situation. When he used the examine function to learn that these mysterious men in black were aligned with the \u2018Stardragon Strategic Defense Initiative\u2019, he couldn\u2019t help but look toward Han Xiao in wonderment.\u201cYou know this guy?\u201d Feng Jun asked Han Xiao curiously as he pointed at Frenzied Sword.\u201cJust ignore him.\u201dAs Han Xiao wiped the blood of his face with a handkerchief that Feng Jun pa.s.sed to him, he frowned.\u201cIf Norsa has found me, then it means the Germinal Organization must know exactly where I am.\u201d\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d replied Feng Jun. \u201cThe intelligence department has the network locked down.

He must have pa.s.sed the intel on to Germinal spies hiding within the capital. It\u2019ll probably be a matter of time before they relay the information.\u201dHan Xiao abruptly started to run out of the alley.\u201cHey, where are you going?\u201d called out Feng Jun hastily. \u201cI still have to take you back to HQ for debriefing!\u201d\u201cNo time to explain! Quickly request for permission to seal all of the city\u2019s exits!\u201dIt was possible that Norsa had learned of his whereabouts from the spies in the city, and that he had come straight for him right after. In that case, it was not too late to take action!Han Xiao knew exactly who the head honcho of the spy network was. The reason he had not taken action against him so far was that the Germinal would simply send a replacement to take over. On the contrary, leaving him alive had its advantages.Norsa\u2019s death would confirm Han Xiao\u2019s presence in the Western Capital, but if he could stop the intel from getting out, the Germinal would not be able to pinpoint his location.Of course, all of this was simply guesswork; it was possible that a spy had already left the city to deliver the intel. Nevertheless, it was worth a shot.\u201cLi Ya Lin, tell the others to meet up with me at District 8. These are the coordinates\u2026 Remember to drive a car!\u201d\u201cOf all places, the slums\u203d I was expecting at least a fancy restaurant!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no time, just do as I asked!\u201dAfter hanging up, Han Xiao smashed the window of the nearest car by the roadside and jumped in.The owner was making a phone call right beside his car when the sudden sound of shattering gla.s.s gave him a fright. He immediately ran over to the driver side and grabbed Han Xiao by the collar.\u201cYou! Get out now!\u201dThe next second, he found himself yanked halfway into the car with his head pinned against the steering wheel, causing the car horn to bellow noisily.\u201cNice timing!\u201dHan Xiao immediately began to search the poor car owner\u2019s body for the car keys. Upon finding them, he ungraciously shoved him out of the window and sped off into the distance.As the car owner sat dazed on the floor with a big bruise on his face, he wondered aloud, \u201cd.a.m.n, since when were car thieves this brazen?\u201d\u2026As Han Xiao weaved through traffic at high speed, he soon noticed the wail of a police siren.\u201cThe car in front, stop right now!\u201d yelled the traffic police officer on his motorbike.Han Xiao tossed the car owner\u2019s driving license out of the window and yelled back, \u201cDeduct as many points as you like!\u201dThe officer ended up tailing Han Xiao all the way to District 8, where Han Xiao quickly got off and began to stride off in big steps. The persistent police officer ran up to him to block his path.\u201cYou! Stop right now!\u201dHan Xiao rolled his eyes in exasperation. With a quick chop that the police officer could never have seen coming, he knocked him out cold.Through a series of twisting alleys\u2014in the process, disposing of three muggers\u2014Han Xiao soon arrived at a small, dilapidated church building. It was now used as a means of shelter by some homeless people.In the warring period of the old era, religion had served as a means of mental support for many. At one point, this church in particular had managed to ama.s.s millions of believers.However, the \u2018savior\u2019 that they believed in never appeared, so eventually, people stopped believing.There were a number of vagrants in the building, but when Han Xiao could not see the one that he was looking for, he abruptly grabbed the nearest one up and questioned, \u201cHave you seen a tall, bearded man with the tattoo of a red wolf on the back of his hand?\u201dThe vagrant s.h.i.+vered at the sight of the blood covering Han Xiao.\u201cYou mean Lu Gao En?\u201d he answered meekly. \u201cWe call him \u2018Tongueless\u2019 because he never seems to speak. I think he went somewhere in the afternoon.\u201dAfternoon?Even regular citizens needed to go through lengthy checks at one of the three guard post in order to leave the Western Capital. As it was currently only 2PM, there was still a chance for Han Xiao to stop him.He could not count on Division 13 to pa.s.s a restriction order. Even if they were willing to, it would take some time for them to come to the decision. By then, Lu Gao En would most likely have left the capital.Han Xiao furrowed his brows.

Lu Gao En would definitely not have expected Han Xiao to know of him, so he would not see a need to deliver the intel with haste. Under such circ.u.mstances, the city pa.s.s that he would use would most likely be the one nearest to him\u2014the Northwest Pa.s.s.However, it was still possible that he would choose to use either of the further pa.s.ses.There was no way to tell.\u201cAy, Han Xiao, we\u2019re here. What did you call us here for?\u201dLi Ya Lin, Zhang Wei, and Lambert arrived. They had managed to come on time thanks to Li Ya Lin\u2019s ride, a yellow convertible sports car.\u201cAn emergency mission. One of Germinal\u2019s spies here acquired some important information. There\u2019s a chance that he hasn\u2019t left the city yet, but he could be at any of the three pa.s.ses.\u201dLi Ya Lin wiped the playful smile off her face upon hearing the severity of the situation.\u201cDo you have a picture of him?\u201d she asked.Han Xiao picked up some sc.r.a.ps of newspaper around him and began to draw out a rough image of Lu Gao En from his faded memory. He then yanked the homeless guy from earlier on up and barked, \u201cLook at this, does it look like Lu Gao En?\u201d\u201cThe eyes should be lower\u2026 his nose is a little crooked\u2026 hair is shorter\u2026\u201dWith the man\u2019s help, Han Xiao was able to produce sketches of Lu Gao En with a 70 or 80 percent resemblance. He then pa.s.sed them to the trio and instructed, \u201cLet\u2019s split up and get the security officers to keep an eye out for this person. Li Ya Lin and I will take her car to the furthest city entrance, while each of you will go to the other two.\u201dZhang Wei\u2019s face twitched as Han Xiao gave them the orders. \u2018Am I still the leader of this team?\u2019Nonetheless, he let it slide as it was an emergency.As they set off, Han Xiao immediately hopped into the driver\u2019s seat of Li Ya Lin\u2019s car.\u201cHey, it\u2019s my car!\u201d grumbled Li Ya Lin immediately. \u201cI\u2019ll drive.\u201d\u201cYou drive too slow.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t trust the driving skills of a top agent\u203d\u201d Li Ya Lin was so outraged that her eyebrows were almost contorted upside-down. Unfortunately, she knew that there was no time to argue, so she grudgingly got into the pa.s.senger\u2019s seat.\u201cTighten your seatbelt,\u201d reminded Han Xiao.Li Ya Lin rolled her eyes at him, replying, \u201cYou must be joking. I\u2019m a pugilist; I\u2019ll be fine no matter how fast you go.\u201d\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d replied Han Xiao with a plain nod as he stamped on the accelerator.\u2026Half an hour later, a yellow sports car appeared at the South Entrance. Spinning almost full-circle, the car left four sizzling, black tire marks on the road as it came to an abrupt stop.\u201cBleargh\u2014\u201d\u201cHey, hey, I thought you were a pugilist?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 don\u2019t talk to me n\u2014 bleeaarrgh\u2014\u201dLi Ya Lin puked non-stop as she leaned on the car door.\u201cHalf an hour, and 27 car accidents\u2026 or was it 28? My head\u2019s spinning so much that I can\u2019t even count.\u201cWho taught you to drive?\u201dHan Xiao raised an eyebrow.\u201cDoes driving have to be taught?\u201d\u201cD-doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cThe first driver didn\u2019t have anyone to teach him, did he?\u201dLi Ya Lin gaped in the face of Han Xiao\u2019s perfect logic. She was about to shoot back at him when, suddenly, the urge to vomit kicked in again, causing her to throw her head back to the side.\u201cReally? I only drove a little fast, that\u2019s all.\u201d\u201cA little fast? I doubt the word \u2018brake\u2019 even exists in your vocabulary!\u201d\u201cFine, fine, let\u2019s stop wasting time.\u201dAs Li Ya Lin tried to get back on her feet, she lost balance and almost tripped into her own pile of vomit. Fortunately, Han Xiao was able to provide support in time. Shaking his head, he began to drag her along with him toward the sentry post.As they neared the post, the stationed troop yelled out, \u201cStop! Show your ID!\u201dAs Han Xiao reached into his pockets to take out his ID card, his expression froze as he realized that he had forgotten to bring them along. Without asking, he directly reached into Li Ya Lin\u2019s pockets to find hers.Top pockets\u2026 none.Bottom pockets\u2026 none.\u201cWhere\u2019s your pa.s.s?\u201d he asked.As Li Ya Lin still seemed too dizzy to think straight, Han Xiao continued feeling around that dynamite body of hers for it.\u2018I\u2014 I\u2019m being taken advantage of\u203d\u2019\u201cAh! I found it,\u201d rejoiced Han Xiao. He then held the pa.s.s up toward the guard, who had been gulping at the show.\u201cOh, you guys are agents. Come on in.\u201dAs Han Xiao took a few steps forward, he discovered that Li Ya Lin was still rooted to the spot, giving him a deathly stare.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Hurry up.\u201dLi Ya Lin took a deep breath to compose herself.\u201cGive me my ID back,\u201d she said stiffly.\u201cWhy so fussy?\u201d replied Han Xiao impatiently. He then casually walked back toward her and slotted the pa.s.s back into her rear pocket.Li Ya Lin\u2019s eyes widened.\u2018I\u2014 I\u2019m being taken advantage of again\u203d\u2019Han Xiao then strode toward the sentry post to give the military officer in charge of security the sketch of Lu Gao En.\u201cPlease wait a moment as the system performs a footage scan.\u201dLi Ya Lin entered the sentry post still biting her lips. The way that Han Xiao had felt her up did not seem to contain any ill-intentions at all. As such, she was having a hard time even getting angry at him. She was just very unhappy, for some reason, and she continued glaring at him.\u2026Lu Gao En worked for an intelligence organization known as Storm Eye, one of the many sub-groups that were secretly under the wing of the Germinal Organization.In most cities, Storm Eye had one \u2018head contact\u2019 in charge of relaying information back to the Germinal Organization, as well as a few covert agents who gathered intel and only reported back to the head contact.One of Lu Gao En\u2019s agents had reported seeing someone matching Zero\u2019s description in District 7. While at first unclear of Han Xiao\u2019s location, Lu Gao En had discovered, after repeated investigations, that there was an area in District 7 that seemed to be cordoned off and watched closely by Division 13. It was most likely where Zero was hiding.Upon finding out that transmissions leaving the city were being blocked, he realized that Division 13 must have gotten wind of him somehow. Hence, he decided to go offline and take his computer apart in order to prevent being traced before heading toward the city entrance to leave.At present, Lu Gao En was blended in with a crowd of people approaching one of the city\u2019s entrances.\u2018Norsa must have completed the a.s.sa.s.sination by now.\u2019Suddenly, the great metal-fenced gate before him closed up.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cWhy are we being stopped?\u201d\u201cWe have orders to temporarily seal the exits,\u201d announced a soldier, starting a commotion among the crowd.\u2018Why would they close the gates\u203d\u2019 Lu Gao En was shocked. \u2018Did Norsa fail?\u2019Still, as he had been extremely careful for the past two to three years, he was not worried of being discovered.\u201cHe\u2019s the one!\u201dThe sudden shout from behind caused Lu Gao En to turn around. There was a bunch of troops walking menacingly in his direction. They were obviously after him.\u2018Impossible!\u2019Lu Gao En immediately looked around him to find an escape path, but it was too late. Not only was he surrounded by the crowd, there were simply way too many troops in the vicinity. As despair filled him, he allowed a soldier to pin him onto the ground without resistance.As Han Xiao appeared at the scene, he sighed a breath of relief.\u201cWe made it in time.\u201d\u201cYou really did!\u201d Li Ya Lin was amazed.\u201cHow did you guys know it was me?\u201d asked Lu Gao En as he raised his head to look up at Han Xiao.Han Xiao looked back at him plainly. In Galaxy, Lu Gao En was the primary contact for all Germinal-allied players in the Western Capital.As Lu Gao En resigned to his fate, he decided to activate the poison sac stored in his tooth. He would rather die than divulge any information regarding the organization that he had dedicated his whole life to.Suddenly, Han Xiao pulled out his handgun to fire a shot at Lu Gao En\u2019s head, sending a trail of blood and brain matter spurting out._____________________You have killed Lu Gao En (Lv.12), gaining 3,500 experience.\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afHan Xiao raised his gun up to blow off the smoke from its barrel.\u2018If you want to die, at least give me the experience.\u2019\u201cWhy did you kill him?\u201dLi Ya Lin was stunned by Han Xiao\u2019s sudden action. Division 13 could obviously have extracted a lot of vital information from him.\u201cThere\u2019s poison stored in his teeth, his nails, and he even has some needles concealed in his clothes. We wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop him from killing himself.\u201dHan Xiao shook his head.In any case, Lu Gao En\u2019s death was truly insignificant to him; he already possessed all the information that he needed. Nonetheless, things were getting a bit dicey.\u2018Looks like I\u2019d better speed things up,\u2019 he thought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As the other beta testers were all preoccupied with leveling up, their call for information had gone unanswered. Just as Jupiter was fuming over what to do, someone shouted, \u201cLeader! The quest hint changed!\u201dJupiter gave a start. Upon checking the quest tab, he discovered that the quest location had actually been updated. It now stated that Zero was inside the Western Capital.\u201cThe mission was updated\u203d\u201dJupiter scratched his head. However, while he was confused, he was not upset. It was the 12th and last day of the beta test, and they had barely made any progress thus far.\u201cWe\u2019ll send members to search the Western Capital after the official launch.\u201dOnce the game launched, the guild would be able to make full use of its advantage in numbers. With so many members, there was no way that they would not be able to find him.Jupiter clenched his fists.\u201cThis B-cla.s.s quest is ours for the taking!\u201dThis was their chance to take a step ahead of their rivals.\u2026In Germinal\u2019s headquarters, a report was being read out to the boss.\u201cCommander Rosa was last heard from in the Western Capital. Another man also disappeared along with him: Lu Gao En, our head contact in Storm Eye. Li Ruo has said that he will find a replacement for him immediately\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Zero,\u201d said the boss abruptly. \u201cHe silenced Rosa and Lu Gao En in order to keep his exact location a secret. Humph, so you are in the Western Capital. Stardragon\u2019s Division 13 must be keeping him under their protection!\u201dRosa was the ace a.s.sa.s.sin of the Germinal Organization, while even Lu Gao En had given the boss a favorable impression. It was a huge loss.That blasted Zero!The boss was furious.\u2018Zero\u2026 did you think that you would be safe as long as you found protection?\u2019While he had at first belittled Han Xiao, over time, he had come to recognize the threat that he posed.According to the a.n.a.lysis of the security footage from the Valkyrie Laboratory, Zero had never displayed any unusual behavior. Where he had gotten hold on their intel from remained a complete mystery.\u201cOrder Storm Eye to pinpoint Zero\u2019s location. I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s hiding within Division 13\u2019s HQ, find him no matter what it takes!\u201dThe boss\u2019 voice was filled with murderous intent.As there was no way to know exactly what other vital information Zero possessed, getting rid of him before he caused further damage was the only option.\u201cGet five commanders and two hundred Night Owls ready to take action as soon as he is found. I will permit the use of guided missiles.\u201cZero, you\u2019re dead meat!\u201d\u2026\u2018The beta test is ending.\u201900:00:00:30Frenzied Sword sighed as he watched the countdown timer. If only he could have just a bit more time to train.Of course, he was overall still quite happy with the progress that he had made. Han Xiao\u2019s quests might have been very unseemly, but they sure did give a ton of experience. Furthermore, all the equipment that he had purchased from him helped to boost his combat power significantly.Although the skill set of the Mechanic cla.s.s revolved largely around crafting, which he disliked, seeing Han Xiao\u2019s strength had given Frenzied Sword all the affirmation that he needed.\u2018I, too, will gradually become that strong!\u2018There will be a spot among the pros for me!\u2019\u2026_____________________Beta Test Concluded. Countdown to Game\u2019s Launch: 122 Days, 1 Hour, 23 Mins.\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afHan Xiao shook his head upon discovering that the discussion board b.u.t.ton had been grayed out.\u2018Looks like I was right, the amount of time between version changes in the real-world is not synced with my current time.\u2019\u201cWhy are you shaking your head?\u201d asked Gu Hui suddenly. \u201cI wonder what other information you possess.\u201dHan Xiao was currently inside a conference room back at Division 13\u2019s headquarters. There were three big shots seated in front of him: Gu Hui, the Division Director, as well as the two heads of the Intelligence Department and the Secret Ops department.Division 13 had known all along that Han Xiao must possess some degree of combat ability, but he had completely exceeded their wildest imaginations. Yet, what was more perplexing was the degree of ease at which he had been able to single out Lu Gao En.Lu Gao En had been operating from within the city for over two years without ever leaving a trace. Division 13 had attempted to look for him many times, but they had all ended up in failure. The fact that Han Xiao could so easily locate him served as solid proof that he knew way more than even they themselves.And so, this meeting had begun. Simply put, Gu Hui wanted to learn more of Han Xiao\u2019s intel.Breaking out of his daze, Han Xiao stroked his chin as he evaded the question. \u201cMy location is now exposed. Germinal might not know exactly where I live, but they will definitely send even more killers into the city.\u201dGu Hui furrowed his brows. Although unsatisfied with Han Xiao\u2019s reply, he followed Han Xiao\u2019s lead.\u201cThen what do you intend to do?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no more need for hide-and-seek. I want to partic.i.p.ate in the next operation.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous!\u201d protested a livid Gu Hui. \u201cIf you show yourself, that will only give them the chance to take action.\u201dHan Xiao faked a cough.\u201cCan we talk alone?\u201dThe two department heads exchanged exasperated glances. \u2018Do we seem that untrustworthy?\u2019Han Xiao glanced at his surroundings before whispering, \u201cI can change my appearance.\u201dGu Hui was visibly shocked.\u201cYou have superpowers\u203d\u201dHan Xiao shook his head.\u201cI can create a gadget that allows me to alter my looks, so there\u2019s no way that they will be able to find me.\u201d\u2018A skin mask? Not a bad idea,\u2019 thought Gu Hui. However, Han Xiao sounded as though he meant something more advanced than a simple skin mask that Division 13 already employed.\u201cEven if you use a mask, it\u2019s still too risky. You will have to take it off eventually.\u201dThe corner of Han Xiao\u2019s lips curled up.\u201cMy mask is more convenient than that.\u201d\u201cAlright, then show it to me before I approve.\u201dThere were two reasons behind why Han Xiao wanted in on the action. The first was, of course, for the experience. The second was that he did not want to remain cooped up inside the Western Capital. This was the only way that he would be able to partic.i.p.ate in more incidents.Ever since the a.s.sa.s.sination attempt, Han Xiao had been spending a lot of time thinking about his next move.The Black Raven Valley Base was situated near the border of Hesla, one of the Six Nations. It was a major base on a completely different scale from the three sites that Division 13 had taken action on previously. Not only were the security and defenses extremely tight, the commander of the base was a superhuman! He was known as the Sword Phantom, Pan Kuang, a Pugilist close to reaching D-level.Near Black Raven Valley was a gathering spot for many wanderers known as Black Raven Village Town. It was a beginner starting zone.Han Xiao planned to destroy Black Raven Valley Base as it would prevent a substantial number of new players from joining the Germinal Organization simply because of the base\u2019s proximity. This idea had occurred to him upon discovering the Throne of G.o.d\u2019s post, after which he had given it some proper thought and became fond of it.It was not only an act of revenge toward the Germinal boss, but it was also a preemptive strike that would have unseen but deadly impacts.Han Xiao grinned with glee at the prospect.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Because of that, I had to endure a yelling from my superior.\u201d\u201cWhy would I inform you? It\u2019s not like you could have helped,\u201d teased Han Xiao, causing Feng Jun to become enraged.\u201cWe might be buddies, but I\u2019ll still get angry if you insult me!\u201dHan Xiao smirked.\u201cPerhaps I should have a talk with the director over how my location got exposed\u2026\u201d\u201cOh you\u2014hahahaha\u2014you little devil. I was just kidding.\u201dHan Xiao rolled his eyes.Under Feng Jun\u2019s subservient escort, Han Xiao left the headquarters to return to the workshop.Altering his appearance was an idea that he had thought up a long time ago. He had known all along that the Germinal would resort to drastic measures against him once his location was discovered.As it was more likely than not that the operation would be pa.s.sed, Han Xiao also needed to prepare new equipment. The mecha arm and the retractable knife would not allow him to keep up with the level of the opponents they were about to face. It would also be nice if his current team was able to partic.i.p.ate in the operation.Thinking about his team reminded Han Xiao of the need to upgrade Zhang Wei\u2019s power suit.The cost of the upgrade would not come cheap.As Han Xiao stroked his eyebrows, he searched through his memories for blueprints suitable for this mission.\u201cLooks like it\u2019s time to learn a bunch more stuff.\u201dSuddenly, someone knocked the door. It was Old Lu, with a chicken leg in one hand and beer in the other.\u201cLittle brat, what are you doing here?\u201d\u201cI want to borrow a few mechanic knowledge books,\u201d replied Han Xiao as he turned his attention back to the bookshelf, expecting Old Lu to chase him out.To his surprise, he instead said, \u201cThe key is in the drawer. Just remember to return it when you\u2019re done.\u201dHan Xiao\u2019s jaw almost dropped.\u201cYou actually agree\u203d\u201dSince when had they been on such good terms\u203dOld Man Lu put down the chicken leg in his mouth and snorted. \u201cTreat it as a show of thanks.\u201d\u2018Thanks?\u2019 Han Xiao frowned.\u201cAre you still trying to promote your granddaughter to me?\u201dOld Lu\u2019s face immediately stiffened. \u2018What\u2019s so bad about my granddaughter that\u2019s stopping you from falling for her\u203d\u2019But that wasn\u2019t why he wanted to thank Han Xiao. Instead, it was because the tall old man had told him that back then, Han Xiao had lured the a.s.sa.s.sin away from the workshop in order to prevent Lu Qian from getting involved. This alone had changed Old Lu\u2019s impression of Han Xiao considerably.\u201cNot bad, kid,\u201d praised Old Lu with a satisfied smile. He gave Han Xiao a pat on the shoulder before leaving him to his own devices.As he left, Han Xiao noticed an oily handprint on his shoulder.\u201cThat old imp.\u201dHe proceeded to unlock the cabinet with the key in the drawer, picked out seven books, and headed back to his room.Back in his room, Han Xiao took a deep breath as he prepared to \u2018learn\u2019 all of them at once._____________________Do you wish to spend one talent point to learn the Energy Talent, [Basic Energy Theory]?\u2026 Energy Talent, [Basic Biochemistry]?\u2026 Energy Talent, [Basic Optics]?\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u201cYes!\u201dLarge streams of information began to fill up Han Xiao\u2019s mind, causing him to feel like his head was about to explode.

However, the cost for adding additional talents was extremely high; adding a third would only cost 5,000 experience, but the cost of subsequent ones increased exponentially. A fourth one would cost 40,000 experience.Generally, lower leveled Mechanics would perform talent fusion with only two talents because fusing more was not guaranteed to give better results.However, some blueprints, like the one that Han Xiao was aiming for now, could be crafted easily with the correct talents._____________________Fusion successful!

    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65 - Smart Meta-Optical MaskPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 65: Smart Meta-Optical MaskTranslator: MJ_ Editor: Millman97Han Xiao pa.s.sed a list of items to Feng Jun.\u201cOh my G.o.d! BOK-recombiner, Farer IV Solvent, and 12 microchips\u203d Do you know how expensive these things are?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m paying,\u201d replied Han Xiao plainly, instantly reminding Feng Jun that they were not on the same pay scale.One hour later, he arrived at Han Xiao\u2019s workshop with three briefcases in hand.The first briefcase contained three ten-centimeter-long transparent tubes that were filled with an opaque white, sticky fluid. This was the BOK-recombiner.The second briefcase contained a small vial of pale blue solution. This was the Farer IV Solvent.These two materials could only be made within an equipped laboratory and were extremely valuable. These two tiny vials had cost Han Xiao $120,000.The third briefcase contained the 12 microchips. Each one was only about the size of a fingernail, and they were extremely thin. Upon closer observation, one would find that they were jam packed with circuit lines. They were commonly used for small and complex gadgets, and the set of 12 cost $60,000.Han Xiao immediately began working on the mask.He started by opening holes on the thin plastic mask for his eyes, nose, and mouth. Then, he carved out 12 small holes on various locations of the mask for embedding the microchips in.Before putting the microchips in, Han Xiao uploaded the data from a scan of his own face to his computer. Using a library of over thousands of faces, he then spent two to three hours linking them up to a simple facial recognition and projection program on his computer.When he was done, Han Xiao retrieved some laboratory apparatus and began to work at mixing the BOK-Recombiner and the Farer IV Solvent together. After some time, he managed to produce a composite material that was neither white nor blue like its const.i.tuents, but instead, the color of flesh.This was the key material for making the Smart Meta-Optical Mask. Not only did it possess some of the useful properties of the BOK-recombiner and the Farer IV Solvent, it had, most importantly, good conductivity.Han Xiao proceeded to embed the microchips beneath the mask before pouring the flesh-colored mixture over it. After a few more finis.h.i.+ng touches, he left it to set within a special freezer.A short while later, Han Xiao opened the freezer and reached in to retrieve the mask. Apart from where the microchips were located, the mask was extremely smooth. On its thin surface, Han Xiao had installed an advanced crystal display that, upon being pressed, caused a spectrum of colors to appear on the spot._____________________You have crafted [Smart Meta-Optical Mask], gaining 5,000 exp!_____________________[Smart Meta-Optical Mask] \u2013 Face EquipmentAllows the user to change the appearance of his face when worn, concealing his ident.i.ty.

A cool sensation enveloped his face when he put it on, and he pressed gently onto the micro-chip on the cheek area to activate it. The appearance of his face immediately transformed, and it continued to change into a different face with each press.This was by no means an ordinary mask of disguise! It was a G.o.dly piece of equipment that allowed the user to change his appearance at will!The [Smart Meta-Optical Mask] would only \u2018transform\u2019 into the faces of humans, as Han Xiao had only fed the program data of human faces. Apart from randomly changing, it was also able to store up to three different faces for the user to access and could revert back to the last three faces used. It also had an additional function that allowed it to scan a target\u2019s face and transform to it with a 70-80% accuracy.After playing with the mask a bit more, Han Xiao removed it and headed back to headquarters to look for Gu Hui.\u201cYou\u2019ve created your mask?\u201d asked Gu Hui.Han Xiao smiled and put the mask on.As Han Xiao did not intend to reveal the mask\u2019s transformation capabilities just yet, he had prepared it to display the face of an ordinary-looking young man beforehand.To Gu Hui, it simply looked like an extremely realistic mask. However, while Division 13 could already make such masks, none of them were as realistic as Han Xiao\u2019s. Furthermore, not only did it seem to be extremely portable, it was clearly very easy to wear.\u201cInterested in selling the blueprints to us?\u201dHan Xiao faked a burst of laughter.\u201cIt\u2019s just a simple mask, why would I need a blueprint to make it? You guys can make them too, right?\u201d\u2018That\u2019s true,\u2019 thought Gu Hui to himself.Inwardly, Han Xiao let out a breath of relief upon seeing Gu Hui give up the idea.\u2018I managed to fool him!\u2019\u201cThen,\u201d continued Han Xiao, \u201ccan I join the operation?\u201dGu Hui thought for a moment before nodding.\u201cThe Hesla Intelligence Service has decided to join us for this operation. You will come along with your team.\u201dHan Xiao had known that Hesla would agree to taking action. It was the Germinal Organization, after all.Suppressing the excitement in his heart, Han Xiao asked, \u201cWhen do we depart?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no rush. It will take some time to arrange our forces, plus, we will both have to work on a proper strategy first. It\u2019ll most likely be half a month before deployment.\u201d\u2018Half a month,\u2019 thought Han Xiao. \u2018That will be enough time for me to finish up my equipment.\u2019\u2026Back in his workshop, Han Xiao wrote his goals down on paper.One, to obtain even more rare blueprints.Two, to purchase a vehicle for his team. As a logistics personnel, a vehicle equipped with all the maintenance and crafting tools he needed would be invaluable.Three, to upgrade the [Fighter Suit].\u201cAh, so much to do. One at a time, I guess.\u201dHan Xiao shook his head.The most important thing was still to raise his own combat ability. There were a few ways to do this.The first and most important way, in Han Xiao\u2019s opinion, would be to improve his defensive capabilities. After all, survival was key.The second was to enhance his long-ranged offensive capabilities. For this, Han Xiao planned to enhance his Berserk Eagles.While Han Xiao did prefer fighting from a distance, close-combat ability was still important on the battlefield, so he also planned to upgrade the Mecha Arm.As for mobility, the Swallow Gliders that had been collecting dust in his inventory were finally going to see use. As the terrain around the Black Raven Valley Base was extremely rough, they might end up proving invaluable to have.Han Xiao also decided to prepare a little something in the event that the battle did not go their way, a little something explosive.After giving it quick thought, Han Xiao scribbled down another list of materials for Feng Jun to help him procure. The total cost of the items on the list cost around another $300,000.Feng Jun found himself growing more and more exasperated at Han Xiao, but fortunately for him, the higher-ups had known before that Han Xiao would be a pain to deal with, so they had given him a raise. For the sake of his $25,000 monthly wage, plus insurance, he relented to act as Han Xiao\u2019s errand boy.Feng Jun sighed as he looked up to the sky dramatically.\u2018With great power comes great responsibility, I guess.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He joked that he would shower him with a pennant, among other rewards, causing Feng Jun to roll his eyes. After teasing him, Han Xiao returned to his workroom to begin work on his equipment.Having leveled up both [Basic Weaponry] and [Basic Mechanical Engineering], the effectiveness of Han Xiao\u2019s enhancement was now much higher than before. He took out the two Berserk Eagles and began to perform modifications on them, upgrading them with better materials and spare parts.\u2018My days of poverty are long gone; I\u2019m a rich man now!\u2019With Han Xiao\u2019s proficiency in modifications, the process was completed in no time._____________________Berserk Eagle (Enhanced)Grade: UncommonBase Stats:Damage: 74-87Fire Rate: 1.5/sMagazine Capacity: 8Range: 50mPower Output: 45Prerequisite(s): Lv. 3 Precise ShotStat Bonus: +2 DexterityLength: 0.21mWeight: 1.9kgAdditional Effect: Backfire \u2013 The recoil of this gun is extremely powerful, requiring 30 STR to overcome.Additional Effect: High Impact \u2013 When attacking, 10% chance to deal bonus 15 damage if the target is within effective range.Additional Effect: Dual-shot \u2013 This gun has been modified with the capability to fire up to 2 bullets per shot (20% damage penalty).Tooltip: Come on, we all know what gun this is based on.

Although Han Xiao was now the proud owner of two uncommon guns, they came with the prerequisite of Lv. 3 Precise Shot. Even though this prerequisite did not prevent Han Xiao from wielding them, it would cause their effectiveness to be greatly diminished.Shaking his head in exasperation, Han Xiao inputted some experience to raise Precise Shot to Lv. 3, which gave him an additional 3% Accuracy and 4% Critical Chance._____________________As you have achieved Lv. 8 in Basic Shooting and Lv. 3 in Precise Shot, you may learn one of the following three advanced skills:SnipingGunfightingSuppression\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afFor the first time, Han Xiao found himself in a dilemma over which skill to pick.Although shooting skills were essential to Cannon Masters, they were also important for Technicians. The three abilities displayed before Han Xiao clearly represented different styles of combat.As the Berserk Eagle was made for close-combat, Gunfighting would make for a logical choice. However, Han Xiao also needed to think further ahead.At end game, Technicians were strongest at long-ranged combat, so they rarely had use for risky, close-combat skills. Suppression would aid in sieging or holding forts, but it would only be effective with a partner to provide tactical support. In contrast to these two skills, Sniping was far better suited for solo action.Han Xiao scratched his head as he thought about it.\u2018I\u2019ll have to work alone sooner or later anyway, plus it\u2019s better for me to keep myself far from danger, unlike a player who doesn\u2019t have to worry about his life. For me, sniping is the best option!\u2019In Han Xiao\u2019s previous life, the dazzling and breathtaking style of Gunfighting was a popular choice among players, and even professional Cannon Masters would learn it just for the cool factor.However, as a pragmatist, Han Xiao could hardly give two hoots.\u2018Who cares about looking good during combat! It\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing this to see the stream chat praise me.\u2019At this thought, the Great Technician Han finally made his decision._____________________You have learned an advanced skill:Sniping (Lv. 1)+4% Fatal Shot+5% Shooting Range\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afHan Xiao nodded in satisfaction. Done!Next, Han Xiao crafted the Swallow Gliders, earning 1,500 experience in the process. He also modified them to give them the \u2018retractability\u2019 of the Retractable Knife. Indeed, the good thing about being able to actually learn knowledge in this life was that Han Xiao could implement concepts and technology from his blueprints into other inventions.With the added retractability, they could now be worn on the back like a parachute before deployment. Once activated, the two 1.2m long \u2018wings\u2019 would extend out to allow the user to freely glide in the air.After the gliders, Han Xiao proceeded to work on his close combat gear. The Mecha Arm actually formed a set with the Mecha Leg, and their blueprints were obtainable through the same combination of talents. They were also necessary parts for creating an Exoframe. However, that would require advanced knowledge, and Han Xiao did not even have the necessary skills to craft a proper Mecha Leg yet. At best, he would be able to craft one that could travel long distances, but it would lack the mechanisms that allowed for nimble movements.Han Xiao planned to upgrade the Mecha Arm by making it lighter and smaller. While making it smaller would cause it to lose some power, Han Xiao had something in mind to compensate for it._____________________Do you wish to proceed with talent fusion?(Lv. 3 Basic Weaponry + Lv. 2 Basic a.s.sembly + Lv. 2 Basic Mechanics)This fusion will cost you 15,000 experience._____________________Fusion Success!Congratulations, you have discovered [Air Motor]!\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u201cWow, first try!\u201dHan Xiao rejoiced.

He refitted it to slim it down but also lengthened it to cover the entire arm.

If even higher leveled talents were to be used, the fusion costs would skyrocket further.\u201cConfirm!\u201dHan Xiao stared at the fusion window with bated breath._____________________Fusion success!Congratulations, you have discovered [Magnetism Armor]!\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afHan Xiao jumped up with joy.This was the blueprint that he had been aiming to get, and it was actually something that a player at Han Xiao\u2019s current level should not be able to possess. Indeed, it was a high-level piece of armor! This would help to guarantee his safety!Of the $300,000 that Han Xiao had spent on upgrade materials, $250,000 alone went into the making this armor.As it was an advanced blueprint, it was much more complex to craft than a basic one, so even Han Xiao, who possessed the required knowledge to craft it, needed to spend an entire hour just to fully understand the blueprint\u2019s contents. After learning it, Han Xiao lifted his head to reveal a bitter smile; by his estimations, it would take at least three days of non-stop work to craft it.He quickly got started.\u2026Three days later, the doors to Han Xiao\u2019s workroom opened. Out came a tired Han Xiao with listless eyes and dark bags under his eyes. He looked as though he were in a daze, as if he didn\u2019t even know who, or even where, he was. In fact, looking at him, one might wonder if he had just woken up from a beating.Han Xiao received a call as soon as he turned on his phone. It was Li Ya Lin, and she did not sound pleased at all.\u201cHan Xiao, why were you unreachable for the past few days? You have dozens of overdue orders! You\u2019d better not take the cash and run away when I\u2019m putting my own reputation on the line for your business! Also, don\u2019t forget that you promised to make a set of specially tailored equipment! Oh, right, we\u2019ve been given a mission! We have to leave for Hesla in ten days. Leader is furious that you didn\u2019t show up for the meeting yesterday, so you\u2019d better keep that in mind\u2026\u201dHan Xiao could barely open his eyes. Ignoring her as she rambled on, he climbed into his bed and curled up under his blanket to fall asleep instantly.\u201cHey, hey, hey\u2014 why are you not saying anything? Urgh, don\u2019t think I\u2019ve forgotten how you took advantage of me the other day\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2018What\u2019s the first thing you do when you get out of bed?\u2018Open your eyes?\u2019When Han Xiao finally woke up, the first thing he did was to make his way to the toilet in his dreamlike stupor. After was.h.i.+ng his hands, he stretched, yawned, and proceeded to brush his teeth.Afterwards, with eyes still half-closed, Han Xiao went over to the kitchen in the main workshop where he pushed Lu Qian off her seat at the dining table with his b.u.t.t and helped himself to the remainder of her breakfast, all the while ignoring her feeble protests.When he was done, he simply cast her an unapologetic glance before strolling out as though nothing had happened.\u201cAh, such carefreeness reminds me of when I was young,\u201d reminisced Old Lu aloud as he stroked his head.\u201cAhhhhh! I want to change the keys\u2026\u201d\u201cPerhaps this is love,\u201d remarked Old Lu with a profound look on his face.\u201cIt is not!\u201d Lu Qian yelled out in exasperation.\u2026Back in his workroom, Han Xiao opened up a small box. Inside were the fruits of his labor, what appeared to be numerous thin scales of metal. They looked black, but on closer observation, they were actually an extremely deep shade of blue. Although they resembled nothing like \u2018armor\u2019, these tiny pieces of metal were, without a doubt, the Magnetic Armor\u2014well, una.s.sembled, and still quite incomplete, to be exact.Han Xiao took a deep breath before placing his hand an inch above the case. He then began to summon the energy of magnetism within his body toward his arm.What happened next was quite a sight to behold.The metal scales began vibrating in response to Han Xiao\u2019s magnetism, and in the next second, they actually started flying toward his palm as though they were being sucked in! Upon coming into contact with Han Xiao\u2019s skin, they seemed to come alive and began dancing up and around his arm energetically, as though they were live fish.\u201cForm,\u201d commanded Han Xiao, and the metallic scales instantly spread along his arm to form a thin, scale-patterned sleeve of armor. It was perfectly smooth and uniform.The armor appeared to be skin-tight, but as it was controlled by magnetism, there was actually a gap of a few millimeters, allowing its user complete freedom of movement.Han Xiao drew his Platinum Retractable Knife out and viciously slashed upon the sleeve. It produced a crisp ring, but there were no sparks, and the armor was completely undamaged.\u201cGood defense!\u201d exclaimed a jubilant Han Xiao._____________________Magnetism Armor (Incomplete)Type: Armor (Bulletproof)Grade: Uncommon (Green)Base Stats:\u2013 Defense: 75\u2013 Durability: 1600/1600Requirement(s): Magnetism-affinity Energy, Intermediate Machinery AffinityAbility: Can be controlled by magnetism to move across the user\u2019s body and transform into armor.

Not even Division 13 possessed much of it in their inventory, and $250,000 was only enough for Han Xiao to make a partial version that could at best cover his entire back.Nevertheless, although the theory behind the Magnetic Armor was simple, crafting it was an entirely different matter. Even if Han Xiao did possess enough resources, he would still not be able to craft the complete version, not with his current level of expertise in both knowledge and skill.In spite of that, crafting the incomplete version earned Han Xiao 40,000 experience, even more than when he had crafted Rover 1.Han Xiao proceeded to test his control over the armor.While such high-level Superhuman Equipment would usually take a low-level player quite some time to get used to, Han Xiao, with his years of experience, was able to quickly get the hang of it.With this armor, Han Xiao now felt much safer than before.It was both inconspicuous and highly portable, and Han Xiao thought of it as a trump card. He planned to keep the armor a secret from everyone, including his allies. After all, who could say for sure that today\u2019s friend wouldn\u2019t become tomorrow\u2019s enemy?Now that he had addressed the issues of mobility, defense, as well as both melee and ranged combat, all that was left for Han Xiao to do was to prepare some art.As Han Xiao was already quite satisfied with the bombs provided by Division 13, he only planned to make some simple modifications, nothing too fancy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68 - Upgrades (Part 3)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 68: Upgrades (Part 3)Translator: MJ_, Chocolion Editor: Millman97Sixty black, glossy, round-shaped objects lay neatly within the two cases before Han Xiao. These were the \u2018Highly Explosive Delay-action Shrapnel Bombs\u2019, known as time bombs for short, that he had purchased from Division 13, and their unnecessarily long name, if anything, was telling of their destructive capabilities.\u201cEach bomb costs $800, so sixty of them amount to $48,000. Hmm, yep\u2026 this calculation should be right.\u201dAlthough the bombs were ready-to-use, Han Xiao decided to perform some modifications on them. With [Basic Mechanical Engineering], he made them flight-capable by installing mini-propellers on them, along with power supplies. This greatly improved their range of attack.The only downside to this modification was that it made them look\u2026 rather comical. They now almost seemed like the kind of gadget that a certain likable, blue, robotic cat (A Doraemon reference) would pull out from his pouch.With the additions of the enhanced Facial Simulator, Desert Eagle, Lightweight Mechanical Arm, Foldable Machete, Sky Swallow Gliders, Magnetically-controlled Armor, and last but not least, these flight-capable bombs to his a.r.s.enal, Han Xiao had finally finished with all his upgrades. Although Division 13 would definitely still provide them with more equipment, at Han Xiao\u2019s current level, his gear could be said to be semi-G.o.dly already. He was currently\u2014without a doubt\u2014the strongest person in his level range.\u201cThis equipment will suffice.\u201dHan Xiao crossed out \u2018Personal Upgrades\u2019 on his to-do list. The next line read \u2018Transport Vehicles\u2019.Creating an entire vehicle from scratch would take too much time, so it was better for Han Xiao to directly purchase one from Division 13 and then perform modifications on it.Quality-wise, Division 13 would definitely not disappoint. After spending some time looking at the available options, Han Xiao decided that a detachable cargo truck would best suit their needs. It would act as a mobile warehouse and a workshop\u2014a logistics vehicle for the team.Han Xiao could buy the truck with either money or exchange reputation points for it, which was essentially requesting that Division 13 give him the truck.Currently, he had a whopping $2.8m to spare. Already, the money-spending ability of the Mechanic cla.s.s was starting to s.h.i.+ne through. Of course, none of this would have been possible without Han Xiao\u2019s prior experience that helped him in acc.u.mulating money.Without happily spending all their money and getting used to living paycheck to paycheck, one could never become an excellent Mechanic.Nonetheless, he decided to pay with reputation points; that\u2019s what they were meant for, after all. In comparison, paying with money would set him back an unnecessary $800,000. Han Xiao rang Feng Jun up.\u2026\u201cGive me the vehicle. How long will it take for you to deliver it to my place?\u201d\u201cI will need to pick it up from the military factory. About two hours.\u201dFeng Jun\u2019s punctuality was proven time and again; exactly two hours later, Feng Jun arrived at Han Xiao\u2019s doorstep in the very truck.A problem immediately presented itself: the truck was too big to enter the garage.Han Xiao and Feng Jun stared at each other, dumbfounded. They had carefully accounted for every single detail except for this issue.\u201cWhat now?\u201d\u201cHow about you guys expand the garage for me?\u201d\u201cCome on, do you think that Engineering Department staff have that much free time to spare?\u201dAs Han Xiao rubbed his chin, his eyes suddenly lit up.\u201cDidn\u2019t you bring in an undercover squad to watch over this district? Where are they now?\u201d\u201cBe more rational jacka.s.s! Don\u2019t you think we are grabbing too much attention!\u201dHan Xiao looked away from Feng Jun and began to size up the military truck. It was 4 meters tall, 3.5 meters wide, and attached with an 11 meters long container that extended beyond the width of the front of the truck itself.\u201cWhat attention-grabbing? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Han Xiao was not at all fl.u.s.tered when bulls.h.i.+tting.\u201cOnly the blind would not see such a huge truck!\u201d Feng Jun basically spouted saliva all over Han Xiao\u2019s face.\u201cWhat is with the saliva-spitting when you speak?\u201d Han Xiao grabbed Feng Jun\u2019s sleeve, wiped his face, and said with a look of disdain, \u201cNot that I am criticizing you, but the volume of saliva that came out of your mouth is huge.\u201dOld Man Lu walked out at this moment and exclaimed, \u201cWhat a huge truck.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just demolish the whole garage?\u201d Han Xiao\u2019s eyes glittered.\u201cGet lost,\u201d Old Man Lu scolded sulkily. He then rubbed the bald area on his head and pondered for a moment before he dug out a key from his pocket and threw it to Han Xiao.\u201cI have a garage a few blocks away. I will lend it to you.\u201dHan Xiao was utterly shocked. \u201cSo generous! Old Man Lu, are you on wrong medicine today?\u201d\u201cGet lost!\u201d Old Man Lu was swearing again. He then pushed them away as they were blocking his way, and he walked out for a leisurely stroll.\u2026Han Xiao drove the truck and arrived at the garage ten minutes later.\u201cBleurgh\u2014\u201d\u201ch.e.l.lo. Do you really have to do that?\u2019Feng Jun\u2019s face was as pale as a sheet as he leaned out the car window. He waved his hands hysterically while he continued vomiting.Han Xiao could not understand what Feng Jun was trying to convey. Does he mean that he will not sit in my car every again, or is he saying that I don\u2019t have to care how he feels?Han Xiao shook his head and threw the unimportant question to the back of his head. After he sent the nauseated Feng Jun away, he began modifying the heavy military truck.He checked every inch of the truck and found no hidden cameras or bugs.Products made by the military factory were of excellent quality. The truck was equipped with numerous parts, including ten cylinders and turbochargers, which enhanced its horsepower. It could move at a top-speed of 135km/hr. The truck had five heavy-duty, slip-free tires on each side. The cargo compartment was large, and it could contain quite a few pieces of equipment. Han Xiao wanted to modify it into a small workshop, so he needed to move the workshop equipment up.The base plate of the truck was modified for multi-terrain use, with parts like spring suspension and air damping suspension, which allowed the truck to move smoothly on bad terrain. The truck was also equipped with an anti-sliding gadget, which would prevent small vehicles from sliding under the truck. The movie scenes of protagonists driving sportscar under the villain\u2019s car to fight would never happen with this truck. Hold on\u2026 why am I naturally picturing myself as the villain?The driving cabin was not at all small\u2014it could easily fit six people. It was equipped with a ten-gear gears.h.i.+ft, so there was a suitable gear for any type of movement.Han Xiao checked the air bags. There were eight of them. As long as the pa.s.senger did not fly out of the vehicle upon collision, they would definitely not be injured. Plus, this pa.s.senger could enjoy the pleasure of being squashed in between a big \u2018chest\u2019.Speaking of car collisions, the front of the truck was not strengthened with a front b.u.mper. Han Xiao needed to add it himself. He then looked at the truck windows\u2014they were bullet-proof. Division 13 did not cut corners.Overall, the truck was up to standard; it did not need any major modification. Han Xiao decided to add a few nitro-boost cylinders to the truck for additional thrust. The thought of having a nitro boost for the truck already excited Han Xiao greatly. His truck could be the ultimate king of the road.Han Xiao started modifying the truck.The inside of the cargo compartment was made into a small-scale workshop. Han Xiao also strengthened the base plate and the front b.u.mper\u2014the thick and heavy armor looked rather st.u.r.dy. Four nitro-boost cylinders were installed in the truck for additional thrust during crucial moments. Furthermore, Han Xiao bought spare tires, and he installed a radar with an antenna for receiving radio signals and sending wi-fi signals.With these numerous upgrades, Han Xiao spent more than 10,000 dollars. He could not help but shake his head. Upgrades sure were costly.Gazing upon the black truck before him, he rubbed his chin as the idea of giving it a name suddenly occurred to him.Han Xiao decided to go with the simplest and most obvious one.\u201cBig Black!\u201dHmm, not a bad name at all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They climbed all over the heavy truck. As Lambert was particularly interested in the engine, he opened the car hood to admire it.\u201cThank you,\u201d said Zhang Wei solemnly to Xiao Han.A logistical vehicle was a very luxurious item for a team like them. Zhang Wei felt embarra.s.sed that Xiao Han had bought it with his own money.Xiao Han laughed it off. \u201cHehe. Just treat it as my way of helping impoverished teammates.\u201dZhang Wei\u2019s mouth started twitching as he was lost for words. Although Xiao Han was saying the truth, it was still agitating for Zhang Wei.\u201cI wracked my brain to come up with a name for this truck.\u201dZhang Wei listened expectantly.Xiao Han cleared his throat and said in a serious tone, \u201cBig Black.\u201dZhang Wei\u2019s body jerked upon hearing the ridiculous name. He gave an unwilling half-smile. \u201cNice\u2026 what a nice name.\u201d\u201cOh. You think so too? This name is very catchy and concise. I am quite proud of myself for coming up with this name,\u201d Xiao Han said in a satisfied tone.\u201cI\u2019m glad you are happy with the name.\u201d\u201cWow. The driving s.p.a.ce is huge.\u201d Li Ya Lin was having a lot of fun when she suddenly thought of something. \u201cwho is going to drive the car?\u201d\u201cThis is my truck. Obviously, I will be driving it,\u201d Xiao Han said.Immediately, Li Ya Lin\u2019s face paled, and her body started trembling. \u201cCan\u2026 can I not travel in the car?\u201dZhang Wei frowned and reprimanded her. \u201cXiao Han spent so much money to let us enjoy some comfort and convenience. How can you reject this?\u201dLi Ya Lin\u2019s face was now as pale as a sheet. She felt that nothing was more horrifying than this.\u201cYou guys will regret this,\u201d she mumbled.Regret? Zhang Wei was puzzled. Is Xiao Han a terrible driver?Then it\u2019s nothing serious. How bad can his driving be? Everyone here is a well-trained agent in excellent physical condition. n.o.body gets dizzy on roller-coasters. There\u2019s nothing to fear about this, Zhang Wei thought to himself.\u201cOh yeah. Our boss told us that we will be moving out in four days,\u201d Lin Yao said suddenly.Xiao Han\u2019s eyes lit up. He had spent about ten days giving the truck an overhaul. He still wanted to install heavy firepower on truck. He had already mastered the knowledge required, but there was simply not enough time. He thought for a while and said to Zhang Wei, \u201cBring the Combatant Armored Suit to me. I will help you improve it.\u201dZhang Wei\u2019s eyes lit up. He had confidence in Xiao Han\u2019s mechanic skills.Li Ya Lin overheard their conversation. She jumped at Xiao Han and nudged his shoulder. \u201cWhat about me! What about me! You promised to customize some equipment for me!\u201d\u201cYou have to wait till I have some inspiration.\u201dAs a Pugilist, you should focus on using your fists to punch people. Why are you always eyeing my mechanic equipment? Xiao Han pushed the noisy Lin Ya Lin aside.The original Combatant Armored Suit was brought out right away by a staff member from the logistics department. Just like the armor exhibited in museums, it was propped up with a plastic skeleton and stored in a human-height metal box.\u201cSince time is running out, I will have to focus on the most essential modification. Firstly, I will increase the energy capacity. Then, work on the structure will begin to reduce the weight and upgrade the skeleton of the mechanical parts. This will help to improve your overall movement.\u201d\u201cThat will be great!\u201d Zhang Wei\u2019s face brightened with happiness. The suit was extremely heavy for him. After every use, his whole body would ache badly, worse than after running ten kilometers.\u201cNext, I will modify the sensing system. I will fit a simple chip onto the suit to survey the situation outside, and I will personally donate a firepower control system, which will give your long-range weapons an auto-aiming ability.\u201cLastly, if time permits, I will also add a simple close-combat weapon.\u201d\u201cSounds great!\u201d Zhang Wei was exhilarated.But suddenly, Xiao Han changed his tone. \u201cAnd, of course, all of these things are chargeable. The total cost will be $360,000.\u201d\u201cHow\u2026 how much\u203d\u201dZhang Wei stared him, his mouth agape in disbelief. His total saving had not even reached a million dollars.\u201cDo you think this is too pricey?\u201d Xiao Han narrowed his eyes at Zhang Wei.\u201cAre your parents still alive?\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking about them? They have already pa.s.sed on.\u201d Zhang Wei was startled by the strange question.\u201cDo you have any siblings?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m their only child.\u201d\u201cDo you have a wife or a girlfriend?\u201d\u201cN\u2026No. I\u2019m all alone.\u201dXiao Han shook his head with a perplexed expression. \u201cThen what\u2019s the point in saving so much money?\u201dThe comment shot right to his heart!\u201cFine. Fine\u2026 Stop talking. I will pay!\u201d Zhang Wei gripped his chest in pain. He felt like his heart was being stomped on by a thousand rhinos.\u2026Like an unscrupulous business man, Xiao Han received the payment from Zhang Wei\u2019s trembling hand before he commenced the modification of the suit.[Basic Energy Theory] Lv. 3 had given Xiao Han the ability to strengthen energy mechanics. However, he didn\u2019t want to give Zhang Wei\u2019s suit a mighty modification, so there was no need for a new energy blueprint. Good stuff had to be kept for personal use.To build in a weight-bearing mechanical skeleton and a sensing chip, one could actually use blueprints. These two were rather common._____________________Do you wish to proceed with talent fusion?(Lv. 1 Basic Spatial Sensing + Lv. 1 Basic Virtual Electrical Engineering)This fusion will cost you 10,000 EXP._____________________Do you wish to proceed with talent fusion?(Lv. 2 Basic Dynamics Principle + Lv. 4 Basic Mechanical Engineering)This fusion will cost you 10,000 EXP._____________________Fusion Success!Congratulations, you have discovered [Low Level Smart Chip]!_____________________Fusion Success!Congratulations, you have discovered [K600-type Mechanical Skeletal System]!\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afThese two were common mechanical blueprints, so most Mechanics would have them. Xiao Han achieved fusion success on his first try without any hiccups.[Low Level Smart Chip] was also sold on the market. However, by unlocking the blueprint, Xiao Han could tweak it by writing his own code. The words \u2018low level\u2019 indicated that there would be more advance versions of it, such as highly intelligent Al for large robots or even intelligent system control for huge s.p.a.ce vehicles and war machines.On the other hand, [K600-type Mechanical Skeletal System] was one of the basic models of inner mechanical skeletal systems.The outer mechanical skeletal systems were worn directly on the body, while the inner type fitted the whole body seamlessly, hidden inside of the external armor. It retained the same functions as the external skeletal system but provided extra mechanical power. The inner skeletal system was a must for making a Mechanical Armored Suit. Needless to say, the more advanced versions were applied to small, medium, large, and extremely large armored suits.Xiao Han removed the exterior of the combat suit, exposing the intricate parts in the interior. Xiao Han observed for a moment before he began his work.First, he increased the energy capacity, then he added in the skeletal system and the smart chip, and lastly, he purchased some imaging devices, cameras, and infrared sensor for the sensing equipment.On dawn of the fourth day, he finally finished upgrading the Combatant Armored Suit.Despite the same old, black, and heavy primitive suit exterior, the inside of the suit had been changed tremendously. It finally resembled a powerful and advance mechanical armored suit.But time constraints did not allow Xiao Han to add a close-combat weapon. Xiao Han was not bothered by it. Not delivering the promised product after payment was not new to him; he had already delayed the delivery of a High-Explosive Gunpowder for more than half a month.Xiao Han yawned and looked at his interface.[Combatant Armored Suit: Deriving progress 2%]Retro-derivation of equipment was one of the methods for Mechanics to obtain blueprints. The requirements were very stringent because the progress would usually halt when they could not fulfil the pre-set conditions. Sometimes, just as the progress reached 30%, it would sometimes ask for INT to reach XX before it could continue the derivation. Furthermore, even when the progress reached 100%, a huge amount of EXP would have to be consumed in order to officially master the blueprint.The core of the [Combatant Armored Suit] was part of the Advanced Mechanic Knowledge [Heavy Machine Modification]. When the progress bar reached 50%, it looked like this knowledge would be required. Since the blueprint for the suit was not essential for Xiao Han, he was not bothered with that.It was move-out day. The team of four gathered in the garage. Lin Yao looked at the computer screen and said suddenly, \u201cThe department has gathered. The gathering point is the East Sentry Post.\u201d\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s board the truck!\u201d Zhang Wei said solemnly.As soon as he gave the instruction, Li Ya Lin moved rapidly onto the driver\u2019s seat and stared at Xiao Han anxiously. \u201cCan\u2026 Can I drive the truck?\u201dXiao Han rubbed his eyes. He had been burning the mid-night oil for the past few days, so he was sleepy beyond measure. Thus, he did not insist on driving. He told her to drive steadily before moving to the back of the truck. He used a few backpacks as blanket and lay on the floor to sleep.Li Ya Lin sighed in relief at once. She felt as if she had just escaped death narrowly. She didn\u2019t even have the energy to point out the irony in Xiao Han\u2019s words \u201cdrive steadily.\u201dUpon seeing that Xiao Han wanted a good sleep, the rest all sat in the driving s.p.a.ce to avoid disturbing him.\u2026West Capital, East Sentry Post, Military Train Station.The superiors highly valued this attack on the base at Dark Crow Valley. Division 13 sent three covert ops teams to take part in this large-scale mission.The first was Zhang Wei\u2019s team, and the other was Ma Qing Yang\u2019s team, the one that saved Zhang Wei\u2019s team.The last team was Covert Ops\u2019 ace team, led by the team leader, Di Su Su.The two ops teams were waiting at the train station, accompanied by an officer from the Staff Department. His role was to give advice and supervise the operations in order to keep the agents in check.There were instances in the past where every team had a strong-opinionated elite agent, resulting in many differing opinions that led to poor teamwork and caused many hiccups to their missions. To counter this problem, Division 13 had modified their mission procedure: when there were multiple teams working together, a staff officer would be the overall brain of the mission.Officers from the Staff department learned how to command on various battle situations all year round. Before the mission, they would study each and every agent from the respective teams to better evaluate mission plans. Although the agents all believed that the staff officers only knew how to write mission report and take responsibility, they had to obey orders from the superior. As long as the staff officer didn\u2019t control them too much, everyone would be at peace with him.\u201cWhy is Zhang Wei still not here? He\u2019s very late.\u201dMa Qing Yang looked at the Sun and took a puff on his cigarette. He was quite good friends with Zhang Wei, and their teammates had friendly relations.h.i.+ps, too.Di Su Su and her team waited on the other side. She was playing with a coin in her hand. The coin, reflecting beams of sunlight, was turning and moving rapidly under her agile hand. She was eager and excited to meet Li Ya Lin because it meant that she would get to bully and tease her again. Plus, she was quite intrigued by her new teammate, Xiao Han.The leading staff officer, Qi Bai Jia, rubbed his good-looking brows. His eyes were irritated by the flickering reflections of sunlight from the coin. He had no choice but to turn his face toward the other side.A loud engine sound travelled from afar. Everyone could hear the huge horsepower of the incoming vehicle. They felt the floor shaking as the vehicle got closer. Qi Bai Jia looked up at the source of the sound and saw a gigantic and ferocious military truck approaching.Ma Qing Yang flicked his cigarette b.u.t.t off and crushed it with his heel.Di Su Su clenched her fingers tight, gripping the coin in her palm.Qi Bai Jia adjusted his collar.\u201cThey are here.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zhang Wei and his team alighted from the front of the vehicle.Qi Bai Jia saluted and introduced himself. \u201cI am Qi Bai Jia, the staff officer who will be leading this mission.\u201d\u201cGreetings. Happy to be working with you.\u201d Zhang Wei nodded. Then he turned his head and smiled at Ma Qing Yang heartily while giving Ma Qing Yang a big hug.On the other side, Lin Yao\u2019s eyes glittered upon seeing Di Su Su, his gaze tightly locked onto her. He waved his arm shyly. \u201ch.e.l.lo, Su Su Jie.\u201d\u201cLittle Lin Lin.\u201d Di Su Su just ignored Lin Yao and walked past him toward Li Ya Lin while he was still mesmerized by her. She pinched Li Ya Lin\u2019s cheeks. \u201cTsk tsk. You have grown prettier since the last time I saw you.\u201d\u201cScrew off. We are not that close.\u201d Li Ya Lin frowned and shoved Di Su Su\u2019s annoying hand away.Di Su Su was not bothered by it. She scanned around and asked curiously, \u201cWhere is your Mechanic? Where is he hiding?\u201dLi Ya Lin crossed her arms in front of her chest. She gave a cold look and refused to answer.Zhang Wei answered, \u201cHe\u2019s a little tired, so he is still sleeping on the truck.\u201d\u201cThis truck is\u2026.?\u201dZhang Wei stood upright and said with a face full of pride, \u201cOur logistical support vehicle.\u201dJealousy filled Ma Qing Yang and Di Su Su\u2019s teams. They gave their team leaders a bitter look.\u201cWe want our own logistical support vehicle, too.\u201dQi Bai Jia clapped his hand. \u201cOkay. Time is running out. Let\u2019s move out.\u201dA military-use train was parked at the station. Instead of transporting the items using airplanes or regular cars, forty well-trained field personnel are loading boxes of firearms and ammunition onto the train.Since the major expressways were destroyed, the Six Nations had focused on the development of railway to connect various destinations. Military-use trains ran designated military railways, which made them faster than civilian trains. Three days was all that was required for the train to reach its destination.The first five carriages comprised of the driving cabin, two bedrooms, the restaurant, and firearm storage respectively. The last few carriages were open air \u2013 specially made for carrying other vehicles. Li Ya Lin drove Big Black up onto the carriage. The field personnel locked it in place tightly and covered the truck with a dust-sheet.Once everyone had boarded the train, it moved off. The train radiated under the fierce sunlight and drove into the dangerous and treacherous forested fields.\u2026.Han Xiao woke up soon after he felt the vibration of the train.The ceiling of the carriage was installed with lamps that illuminated the room under a soft white light. The carriage was filled with lifeless, ice-cold machines and mechanical weapons, but they actually gave him a sense of security.Han Xiao rubbed his eyes forcefully before he got his full concentration back. He opened the carriage door only to realize that he was on a high-speed train that was already on the move. The wild wind gushed toward his face, blowing his messy hair all around. The floor was vibrating non-stop and the riotous sound of the train movement rushed into his ears. The train moved smoothly along the rail toward their destination.A galaxy of stars illuminated the dark sky.Mountains could be seen on the distant horizon.Have I slept for the entire day?For a while, Han Xiao was slightly startled. He then put on his Facial Simulator and adjusted his face to that of a regular man from his memory. After which, he placed a mask over the Facial Simulator. He had always been this careful. Afterwards, he followed the trail of light and entered the carriage from the front.The sound from the wind disappeared the moment he entered the carriage; noisy chatter filled his ears instead. He felt as if he had just transmigrated from the stone age to a modern civilization.As soon as Han Xiao walked in, everyone stopped talking. Every pair of eyes was fixated on Han Xiao. They scanned him with curiosity.Di Su Su was the first person to stand up. She moved her beautiful waist and moved seductively toward Han Xiao.\u201cSo, you are Han Xiao?\u201d she asked curiously.\u201cI think you\u2019ve got the wrong person,\u201d Han Xiao replied nonchalantly. Han Xiao knew that he would lose a lot of face if he answered all the questions directed at him truthfully.Everyone\u2019s face stiffened. What a blatant lie! Everyone was here in the cabin. Who else could he be\u203dLi Ya Lin was instantly delighted as she saw the scheming Di Su Su getting rejected. She waved at Han Xiao. \u201cXiao Ge, come here and sit.\u201dHan Xiao nodded and moved beside Zhang Wei and the others. Li Ya Lin whispered to Han Xiao, \u201cGreat job! You just embarra.s.sed that scheming Di Su Su.\u201d\u201cScheming?\u201d Han Xiao was surprised by her description.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Di Su Su is a scheming, cunning, and sly snake!\u201d Li Ya Lin said with a mouth full of detest.Han Xiao squinted. \u201cAre you describing yourself?\u201dLin Yao could not agree more. However, he dared not add anything for fear being beaten up by Li Ya Lin. He secretly looked at Han Xiao with respect. That\u2019s my Xiao Ge\u2014full of b.a.l.l.s\u2014a courageous man who never filters his words.When Di Su Su saw Li Ya Lin and Han Xiao\u2019s intimate gestures, her face turned black. Traces of angered flashed in her eyes.On the other side, Ma Qing Yang extended his hand and smiled. \u201cHey, brother. Nice to meet you. I\u2019m Ma Qing Yang.\u201dHan Xiao shook his hand as he held back the enraged Lin Ya Lin, unfl.u.s.tered. \u201cTechnically, we never met.\u201dMa Qing Yang was dumbfounded. He surveyed around Han Xiao\u2019s mask, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. \u201cOh. You are right.\u201dQi Bai Jia clapped his hand. \u201cSince everyone is here, I will now explain the details of this mission. Field personnel please take your leave.\u201dField personnel knew that this was the rule, so they left this carriage without hesitation. The place immediately quieted, as only the three covert ops teams and Qi Bai Jia were left inside.\u201cThis is a joint mission between Hesla\u2019s Intelligence Department and us. Hesla\u2019s troops are stationed at the border, and they could move out at any moment. Our job here is to infiltrate the enemy base to gather information about their defenses so that we can provide the troops with intelligence support.\u201cHesla has sent us a map of the Dark Crow Valley. This place is easy to hold but hard to attack, and with deep forests, we will not be able to locate the coordinates of the base with our satellites. We have zero information about their troop number and location. We can only attack from land.\u201dEveryone was very serious when it came to their mission. Di Su Su scratched her forehead and frowned. \u201cThis sounds like a heavily-guarded best. Is it possible for Hesla\u2019s troops to storm the base on the ground?\u201d\u201cThey refused.\u201d Qi Bai Jia shook his head.Everyone understood the reason; as long as Hesla could take down the enemy with two thirds of their effort, they would never deploy their full strength. Furthermore, when there was too little information about enemy\u2019s power and location, Hesla would not allow its troops to go in prematurely for fear of suffering too many casualties. The Covert Ops department would be brought in to do the dirty work like such an infiltration.Li Ya Lin grumbled, \u201cThen where is the infiltrating point?\u201dQi Bai Jia pointed at a spot on the map. \u201cOn the west side of the valley, there is a large town called Crow\u2019s Forest. The fact that they have the courage to build a town near a base of the Germinal Organization suggests that the two parties are colluding. Therefore, there must be a few scouts from the valley base stationed in the town. This is our opportunity to obtain crucial intelligence.\u201cAnd according to intelligence from the higher ups, there are three noteworthy enemies from the Dark Crow Valley base.\u201dQi Bai Jia gave out a folder of information sheets to everyone. As everyone was reading through the sheets, he summarized the gist of the information. \u201cPan Kuang\u2014head of the base, 35 years-old, Asian, E+ Pugilist\u2014is one of the Germinal Organization\u2019s executive officers. His weapon is a blade, nicknamed Blade-soul. His last recorded feat was three years ago, when he defeated twelve Theseus agents at the border alone. Four of them were superhumans.\u201dThe page showed an emotionless man. He looked like any ordinary man but gave off an extremely fierce vibe.\u201cJi Jie, deputy head, male, 29 years-old, mixed Asian and Caucasian, limited information. We only know that he seems to be a relative of the leader of the Wind Eye Organization, Ji Nuo.\u201cDormund, captain of the security force, 43, from Raylen. He specializes in different firearms, and he is an extremely elite special agent. He used to lead a whole Night Owl squad.\u201dDoubt filled Ma Qing Yang\u2019s face. \u201cI thought we did not have much information regarding the internal situation of the base? Where did all this detailed information come from?\u201dEveryone was wondering the same thing.Qi Bai Jia shook his head. \u201cNot sure. The higher ups said it was cla.s.sified.\u201dEverybody stopped their questioning.Han Xiao p.r.i.c.ked up his ears slightly. The source of this intel is sitting right beside you guys.Qi Bai Jia added more pointers for everyone to take note. Suddenly, his tone changed. \u201cFor this combined exercise, Hesla will be sending teams of agents from the intelligence department. They will move with us when we meet at the rendezvous point.\u201dZhang Wei\u2019s expression became unnatural, and he questioned, \u201cAgents from two countries working on this mission together?\u201dQi Bai Jia was feeling embarra.s.sed and coughed. \u201cYes.\u201dThat was just courting trouble!Hesla was unsatisfied with the intel from Stardragon. Also, they didn\u2019t want to expend much of their own force, so they requested that Division 13 deploy manpower for this mission.The agents looked at one another with unease. The relations.h.i.+p between the two countries were rather stale. The agents even seemed hostile toward one another. It seemed like the mission would turn out to be a flop.None of this intel was useful for Han Xiao. He yawned and looked out of the window. He squinted after he caught sight of something. He immediately interrupted the discussion and shouted, \u201cWe are under attack by beasts!\u201dEveryone was stunned and could not react. The train vibrated violently, causing the agent to almost fall. At the same time, there was a loud and horrible cry from the field personnel in the back carriage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The shaking came from the last carriage of the train. The Covert Ops agents, who were trying hard to maintain their footings, peeked out of the windows, and the sight in front of them was shocking.Under the cover of darkness, a gargantuan black worm was coiled up around the last carriage. The worm\u2019s body spanned over tens of meters, and it had a glossy, black exoskeleton that was composed of chitin, reflecting the moonlight.The creature looked hideous. The head of the worm housed its gigantic mouth, with sharp teeth that continued way down into its throat. The worm was chewing on the metallic exterior of the train carriage, perforating the carriage\u2019s exterior. An unfortunate agent ended up in the worm\u2019s mouth, and in a brief moment, the screaming ended as the victim turned into minced meat.Xiao Han felt a cold s.h.i.+ver. The bold ideas he previously had vanished instantly.\u201cIt is the Dark Earthly Worm!\u201d One could see the fear on Qi Bai Jia\u2019s face.Xiao Han drew his Berserk Eagle out from the holster and fired a shot at the worm. He tensed up the moment the stats of the worm flashed on the screen before his eyes._____________________The Dark Earthly WormLevel: 48(Infant stage) Lv. 10, (Adolescent stage) Lv. 10, (Adult stage) Lv. 10, (Mating stage) lv10, (???)

The gunshots were deafening. However, the bullets merely grazed the thick exoskeleton of the worm, causing almost no harm to it.The wilderness of Aquamarine was especially dangerous. All sorts of ghastly creatures roamed in it. There were many cases from the past where these creatures brutally slaughtered towns and cities. Humans had to rely on their collective intelligence and wisdom to counter these creatures in order to stay at the top of the food-chain.The Dark Earthly Worm had a long lifespan. Its length increased proportionately with its age. Under normal circ.u.mstances, it peacefully resided in darkness with little activity. However, it would be awakened by violent vibrations in the ground.It became clear to the folks that the worm had been woken up by the noise of the pa.s.sing train.To prevent encounters with wild creatures, every rail line had maintenance personnel who would inspect the infrastructure and survey the traffic, which also included surveying the underground for signs of life. If the worm had come before the last survey, it meant that the personnel in charge had slacked and failed to inspect the ground thoroughly.The agents, who were considered prey by the worm, reacted to the situation with shock by firing their pistols. However, the smaller bullets form the pistol dealt almost zero damage to the worm, whose defense points were way above one hundred.All the explosives and Gatling guns were in the store carriage. However, the agents were unable to obtain these weapons. Their access to the store carriage was blocked by the worm. The situation was not optimistic for the agents.Amidst the chaos, a strong gust of wind buffeted the carriage. Random items fell out and started drifting in the wind. The train tilted at an angle of fifteen degrees as sparks flew out from the base of the train screeching against the track. The carriage looked as if it would be flipped by the ma.s.sive body of the worm at any moment.\u201cMove aside!\u201d Li Ya Lin shouted as she leapt forward with the foldable machete in her hand. She channeled the flames of yellow energy and hacked hard into the worm\u2019s exoskeleton. A crack was heard, and a distinct cut appeared on the worm\u2019s body.It was useful!Pugilists could channel their internal energy to deal astonis.h.i.+ng damage. In this case, the punches and kicks had immense power and worked effectively.After a quick glance, Di Su Su also went forward. With the foldable machete in her hand, channeling the flames of green energy, she hacked hard and fast, like streaks of lightning. A small piece of exoskeleton fell off the worm, and a faint glow of green could be seen.The worm showed no signs of apprehension. It had its thick flesh and armor for protection and was, therefore, especially calm. It subsequently shrank its body to give the carriage a harder squeeze.The monsters on Aquamarine were ferocious, and many had stacked abilities that made them especially hardy. The worm was evidently a wild BOSS level creature, and without the firepower of the modern military, it would be difficult to slaughter the monster. The worm was a creature that required at least fifty players of the same level to defeat. However, there were some instances where the monster was defeated by solo players.In two gulps, another two agents were swallowed by the worm. The flesh of humans tasted much better than that of the sandworms underground. The Dark Earthly Worm ground its teeth as if it had enjoyed the meal.The agents were s.h.i.+vering, and the brutality of the predator caused many to almost collapse to the ground. At that instant, it seemed like humans had lost their intelligence and had been reduced to prey waiting for their fateful moments to arrive.\u201cUse fire, the worm is afraid of fire!\u201d Di Su Su yelled.The worm had poor eyesight and was especially sensitive to heat and sparkles of ember, which had a similar effect on the worm to flashbangs on humans.The agents realized that if the situation remained stagnant for much longer, the train would be destroyed. The only solution was to use flames to push the worm back. Zhang Wei immediately took out the magazine housing the High-Explosive ammunition.Bang!Instantly, the impregnable exoskeleton of the worm started burning. The worm lost its composure and started wriggling violently. The flames and the temperature made it especially uncomfortable. It became as agitated as a restless baboon.Xiao Han stood there steadily like a nail in a plank. The increasing magnitude of the jolts made him worry about the carriage flipping. Almost all of Division 13\u2019s agents had purchased the High-Explosive rounds, so he was confident that they could handle the situation effectively without him getting involved.The fire started growing on the worm, and in less than a moment\u2019s time, the worm could no longer withstand the glaring ember. It gave a shriek and loosened its grip on the carriage. Following that, it tunneled into the ground. In a matter of seconds, it was deep in the ground, leaving only piles of dirt.The agents that managed to escape the wrath of the monster were still feeling shocked and fearful. They collapsed onto the ground.\u201cWe are saved!\u201d\u201cWe are not dead yet, not dead yet\u2026\u201d\u201cMama, I miss you!\u201dAlthough the worm only appeared for a few minutes, the damage it had caused was immense. There were holes everywhere on the carriage. It was in a shambles. If the worm had not been chased away, the train along with its pa.s.sengers would have\u2026 well, maybe not all of the pa.s.sengers would have perished, but the train was definitely going to have been delayed.Luckily, there was the High-Explosive ammunition. The folk all looked toward Xiao Han. One could sense the appreciation in their eyes.Zhang Wei patted on Xiao Han\u2019s shoulder. No words could describe his grat.i.tude.\u201cIf you want to thank me, just say it. I can\u2019t really read minds.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dEveryone was speechless.Xiao Han\u2019s words completely destroyed the atmosphere.The agents rested for a moment and started clearing up the mess.The attack by the Dark Earthly Worm was ultimately a one-time incident, and the fact that only one of such accidents had occurred proved that the military rail line was safest.The scenery outside the train\u2019s windows was mainly mountains, dense forests, and loess plains, which gradually became boring.Along the way, Xiao Han stationed himself in the large black carriage, practicing his energy training technique and machine manufacturing skill.Three days later, the train arrived at the Hesla Border station.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72 - The Camp-Destroyer MissionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 72: The Camp-Destroyer MissionTranslator: Chocolion Editor: Millman97Hesla and Stardragon belonged to the same continent. The more liberal culture on Hesla was perhaps due to the hot and humid climate. Even outside of the beaches, bikini girls and topless guys could be seen walking on the streets.The train pulled in to the military train station. Looking through the window, a man in shades wearing a loose-fitting flowery s.h.i.+rt could be seen standing on the platform. He was probably the next point of contact.Han Xiao alighted from the train together with the rest as Qi Bai Jia led the way. Qi Bai Jia walked up to the man and introduced himself. \u201cI am Qi Bai Jia from the Stardragon\u2019s Division 13.\u201dThe man laughed and removed his shades. He had unshaven stubble and looked unkempt, as if he was a fishmonger from the market.\u201cI am Ye Fan from the Hesla Intelligence Department.\u201dHan Xiao was in disbelief.Ye Fan\u203dWhich Ye Fan was he?What exactly happened!The man looked nothing like the das.h.i.+ng and cool Ye Fan that Han Xiao pictured in his mind.Ye Fan saw the hole-studded train carriage and immediately asked, \u201cYou guys encountered a monster?\u201d\u201cIt was just a small worm, no real threat.\u201dQi Bai Jia gave a dry cough. Despite of the danger caused by the worm, there was no way he would admit that the situation had been greatly perilous. He needed to maintain the reputation of the Stardragon agents and wanted the folks on Hesla to believe that they were strong.\u201cIt must have been really fortunate for you guys to arrive safely.\u201d Ye Fan laughed. He did not further probe into Qi Bai Jia\u2019s words.Ye Fan put his shades back on and said, \u201cLet us quickly head to the command center and report in. Our administrative procedures here are less complicated than those in Maple, at least 90% less.\u201dSome agents chuckled to themselves. Maple was known for its inflexible system. Apparently when the Shanuks from Theseus and Maple collaborated to wipe out the Vagrant Warlords, the short-tempered Shanuks were so frustrated with the elaborate reporting procedures of Maple that they almost fought with the officials at the Maple Intelligence Unit\u2019s Caroma headquarters.The administrative pre-requisite for this joint operation required the commanders to submit their operation plans before the actual execution of the mission.For this operation, the Hesla military was delegated to be the offensive force. The agents were in charge of reconnaissance missions to uncover the enemy\u2019s defense blueprints at the Dark Crow Valley Base.Along the way, one could see the brand-new bulletproof jeeps and small tanks parked in garages. There were also honeycomb missile-launchers and groups of soldiers transporting ammunition.Zhang Wei, Di Su Su, and Ma Qing Yang became really quiet, a stark contrast from their usual chatty behavior. It was their nationalistic sentiments affecting them. Han Xiao realized that he should not do anything overboard at that point in time.The commanding officer was a muscular Caucasian man by the name of Colonel Carl. Colonel Carl was studying the operation plan hanging on the wall. Upon hearing the door creak, Colonel Carl, who thought that it was his a.s.sistant officer entering the room, blurted out, \u201cDo not disturb me when I am thinking!\u201dYe Fan coughed and said, \u201cColonel, the agents from Stardragon are here to submit their report.\u201dColonel Carl turned his head to face Ye Fan. The tension on his face relieved immediately. He squinted his eyes and stared coldly at the Stardragon agents with distrust. He took out a doc.u.ment from his drawer.\u201cTake them down to rest, we will set off together in an hour,\u201d he ordered.Carl seemed unfriendly to the agents of Division 13. Ye Fan took the agents to a room and asked them to stay put at the location since they would be moving out shortly.After Ye Fan left, the agents were left alone. Lin Yao finally dared to speak and asked softly, \u201cWhy do I get the feeling that the Hesla soldiers, especially the commanding officer, seem to not like us?\u201dMa Qing Yang gave a sarcastic grin and said, \u201cIn the past, there were wars between Stardragon and Hesla. Therefore, the people of Hesla are unfriendly toward us. It is really frustrating that we have to face such situations even when we are on a collaborative mission with them. Colonel Carl definitely doesn\u2019t look like an easy figure to appease.\u201dThe different cliques within Division 13 was not unique to Stardragon. In fact, many countries faced such situations. Maple and Ordina were more conservative. Raylen and Theseus were more a.s.sertive. Stardragon and Hesla were more neutral.Lin Yao remarked in disbelief, \u201cWhy did the department send us to Hesla then? What if they make us the sacrificial objects for the mission?\u201d\u201cn.o.body knows what the higher-ups have in mind. I guess we have to count on ourselves to stay safe.\u201dMa Qing Yang, being a seasoned member of the department, was no longer surprised or shocked by such arrangements.Qi Bai Jia explained, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, every command given to you guys has to gain my approval.\u201dThe agents fell silent after a series of discussions to get into the mode for the mission.\u201cI am going out to take a puff.\u201dHan Xiao stood up and walked out of the room. He lighted his cigarette and took a deep puff, which went all the way down to his lungs, then out of his nostrils in two trails of smoke. He felt a sense of relief.He ignored the unfriendly stares from the Hesla soldiers and diverted his attention to the mission plan on the screen of the tablet._____________________You have activated [Operation Dark Crow Valley Base].Mission Brief: This is a small-scale military operation.

There were also additional rewards based on one\u2019s individual performance.As Han Xiao was smoking, a lady with short red hair approached him and asked, \u201cAre you from Stardragon?\u201dStaring at her in the eye, Han Xiao nodded. \u201cI suppose so.\u201dImmediately, the lady drew a knife from her waist and stabbed toward the neck of Han Xiao!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 - Acing the TestPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 73: Acing the TestTranslator: chickenpau Editor: Millman97Han Xiao stared at the red-haired woman without flinching.The knife was only three centimeters from his main artery when it stopped and turned away, displaying the woman\u2019s strong skill wielding her weapon. The woman gave a fierce look. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you dodging?\u201d\u201cWhy should I dodge?\u201d\u201cSo, you think I do not dare stab you?\u201d\u201cYou can try.\u201dHan Xiao\u2019s face did not change one bit. Somewhere beneath his clothes, the magnetic-controlled extendable suit had already inched near his collar. He could protect his neck at a moment\u2019s notice, and therefore, he was fearless.Furthermore, since she was able to move freely in the military campsite, she had to be a Hesla agent. She would not really harm him like this. This would most likely be a test of his ability or to instill fear in him. However, how dare they picked him as the target! Han Xiao was slightly irritated. His eyes turned ice-cold.The red-haired woman suddenly felt a s.h.i.+ver down her back and did not realize where it came from. She collected her mind, and harrumphed. \u201cWinna, agent from Hesla Intelligence Department.\u201dShe had just finished talking when she felt something pus.h.i.+ng onto her stomach. She looked down; a large caliber pistol was pointing right at her stomach.Only then did Han Xiao laugh and say, \u201cHan Xiao.\u201dThat was fast! I didn\u2019t even see how he drew his gun!Her pupil constricted. She put away her knife. Han Xiao withdrew his gun, too.\u201cI will remember that.\u201dWinna turned around and left.Han Xiao narrowed his eyes. \u201cHesla personnel sure are hostile toward us. They\u2019d better not drag me down.\u201d\u2026.After Winna walked some distance away, she gave a sigh of relief. She realized cold sweat was dripping down her hairline and became serious.That Stardragon agent gave her\u2026 an extremely dangerous vibe.Winna returned to the lounge to look for the rest of the Hesla agents. Ye Fan smiled and asked, \u201cDiscover anything?\u201dWinna took a sip of water to sooth her parched throat and replied in a serious tone, \u201cThat Han Xiao is likely very dangerous.\u201d\u201cHan Xiao?\u201dYe Fan thought of something based on the physical description of him.That guy had been very low profile ever since they alighted the train. He only gave a weird look when someone called his name.\u201cA strange person,\u201d Ye Fan concluded.\u2026Han Xiao finished smoking and stepped on the cigarette b.u.t.t. He walked back into the lounge.Qi Bai Jia looked over and asked abruptly, \u201cNothing happened, right?\u201d\u201cSomething happened. I saw a female pig falling into a ditch.\u201dQi Bai Jia felt slightly awkward. \u201cCan you be more serious?\u201d\u201cIn that case, there was nothing,\u201d replied Han Xiao nonchalantly. Since it was only a test meant to scare him, he did not want everyone to hear about it. Firstly, it was to protect the mission. And secondly, he didn\u2019t think he wanted to be strayed by emotions.In his mind, they were three types of enemies. The first type p.i.s.sed him off or violated his interests. The second type wanted him dead or endangered his life. The last type was his nemesis. There was also the type that not only had mutual hatred but also conflicting interests. One example would be the Germinal Organization. This was the enemy that was top priority for Han Xiao. The first kind was too mild for him to care about.Qi Bai Jia gave Han Xiao a complicated look. He was sitting by the window and had seen the whole incident unfold. He had gone on a lot of field missions before, and he knew that the other country\u2019s agents would surely test their ability and show off their own prowess. This was a covert rule. All the agents were proud and arrogant. They would not get respect and power without showing off their ability. If anyone were to complain to their superior, they would actually be laughed at.Qi Bai Jia greatly approved of what Han Xiao had done. He did not let Stardragon\u2019s reputation down, and he was glad that Han Xiao had kept his mouth shut. This guy\u2019s ability is good, and he understands the bigger picture.\u2026\u201cThey didn\u2019t fight?\u201dCarl nodded his head in satisfaction after he heard his deputy\u2019s report.\u201cGood. Seems like those Stardragon people know their place on our territory.\u201d\u2026.Soon, it was time for them to depart. Everyone gathered at the border exit. Ye Fan, together with Winna, brought a dozen agents, armed and ready to go.The first stop of the mission was a position far away from the Crow Valley Town. There was an abandoned secret hideout of Hesla\u2019s. They would be using it as their temporary base.Division 13 transported the land rovers using the train. They were just regular all-terrain cars. Only Han Xiao\u2019s Big Black was unique. He drove his team off amid loud revving of the engine.This time, he drove steadily and comfortably. Li Ya Lin was almost moved to tears. The other three teammates, cramped in the other seats, were puzzled. They didn\u2019t understand Li Ya Lin\u2019s big reaction to all this.It was half a day\u2019s ride. Hesla\u2019s motorcade was leading, and Division 13 followed.Suddenly, Hesla\u2019s motorcade sped up, gradually increasing the distance between the two parties. Di Su Su and Ma Qing Yang accelerated when they realized it.Only Han Xiao, driving Big Black, followed slowly at the back.\u201cXiao Ge, we need to catch up with them!\u201d Lin Yao said anxiously.Han Xiao\u2019s had one hand on the steering wheel while the other one was out of the window and enjoying the wind. \u201cWhy do we need to catch up? No matter how fast they drive now, they will have to wait for us later.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 you are right when you put it that way.\u201dSuddenly, Di Su Su\u2019s laughter came from the radio. \u201cLittle Lin Lin, how come you guys are so slow. Hurry and catch up with us. Unless Han Xiao\u2019s skills are not up to par?\u201d\u201cI do not want to waste my petrol,\u201d Han Xiao replied briefly.Di Su Su was instantly stunned. This was the first time she heard such a unique excuse. Agents like us need to worry about paying for petrol?Ma Qing Yang chimed in on the radio. \u201cZhang Wei, this is Hesla\u2019s agents showing off. We must not lose to them.\u201dZhang Wei pondered for a few seconds, and he patted on Han Xiao\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s catch up with them.\u201dLi Ya Lin\u2019s face immediately turned pale. She grabbed Zhang Wei\u2019s sleeve hurriedly and urged, \u201cPlease don\u2019t. This speed is great!\u201d\u201cWhat exactly do you fear?\u201d Zhang Wei was really puzzled.\u201cCaptain, is it not good to be alive?\u201d Li Ya Lin said in a trembling and sobbing tone.Zhang Wei was extremely baffled.Han Xiao raised his eyebrow. \u201cYou really want to pursue them?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zhang Wei nodded his head.Han Xiao sighed and changed the gear with ease. \u201cOkay then. You guys had better hold on tight.\u201dLi Ya Lin was deeply fearful. She held onto the car door as tightly as she could and clenched her jaw.\u201cYou\u2026 you guys will definitely regret this.\u201d\u2026In the afternoon, everyone arrived at the destination.As soon as they alighted their vehicles, they all looked at the big black truck with shock, horror, and disbelief. Cold chills ran down their spine whenever they thought of the scene from before.Even though they were experienced agents who had seen many things, such as \u201cS\u201d and \u201cZ\u201d shape movements, this was the first time they had seen an \u201c&amp;\u201d shape movement! And it was faster than anyone else!This could not even be counted as drifting\u2026 more like flying!The truck driver must have been heavily under the influence!Zhang Wei, Lin Yao, and Li Ya Lin fumbled out of the vehicle, held onto a tree at the side, and started vomiting everything they had inside them. At that moment, they felt like they\u2019d be better off dead.\u201cBlargh\u2014\u201d\u201cOh my G.o.d\u2026 I feel like I\u2019m dying. Blargh\u2014\u201d\u201cTold you that you would regret this. Blargh\u2014\u201dHan Xiao strolled down from the car and clamped a cigarette comfortably in his mouth. He smirked and said, \u201cWell, you guys told me to chase.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 Do you specialize in driving b.u.mper cars\u203d\u201dHan Xiao curled his lips. b.u.mper cars? Don\u2019t look down on me. I used to drive Mechas!Lambert got out of the car with st.u.r.dy steps, as if nothing had happened to him. Han Xiao\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cSee? There is someone normal enough to enjoy my driving.\u201dJust as Lambert opened his mouth to speak, vomit came out like waterfall. Only after everything was vomited out did Lambert commented with a poker face, \u201cIf you ever touch the steering wheel again, I will just jump out of the car.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After everyone moved their equipment into the secret base, they began their pre-mission briefing.\u201cWe have two operations. Firstly, disguise as wanderers and blend into Dark Crow Forest Town to gather intel; secondly, search for sentry guards from the Germinal Organization that are left alone and force information about their base out of them.\u201cWe will handle the sentries, your people can go to the Dark Crow Forest Town,\u201d Winna immediately stated.Di Su Su frowned. There would mostly likely be spies hidden in the town. If they attempted to blend in, they might be exposed and be put in dire danger. If so, they would not achieve anything. Searching for sentries would be much safer and easier to accomplish.Hesla just could not wait to throw all the dangerous and tough jobs to Division 13. This att.i.tude annoyed them greatly, but someone had to do the missions after all. If it was not going to be Hesla then it had to be Division 13. As such, no one voiced any objection.\u201cTo infiltrate the town, we must first disguise ourselves as wanderers and then find an opportunity to gather intel covertly. We must not act rashly and alert the enemy,\u201d said Qi Bai Jia.After some discussion, it was decided that some people would stay at the base as backup. Four people stayed behind: Lin Yao, Qi Bai Jia, Ma Qing Yang, and Han Xiao.Hesla also left some personnel to guard the base. Han Xiao only knew Ye Fan from their group.It was only the afternoon. The Hesla agents decided to take a rest first. They would wait till dawn, when enemy\u2019s alertness would be at its lowest, to move off to find enemy sentry guards. They had brought infrared imaging devices, so the darkness actually provided them with an advantage. Also, they secretly wanted Division 13 to be the guinea pig to sweep away some danger first.Once the mission plan was finalized, those Division 13 agents who were going in mixed together to form a team with Di Su Su as the leader. They were disguised in wanderer\u2019s clothes and looked travel-worn and weary. They hunched their backs to look as if they were being weighed down by stress. They carried giant backpacks and looked exactly like those real wanderers. They then headed toward the Dark Crow Forest Town on foot.The secret base was equipped with many computer screens that were connected to agents\u2019 camera and earphones. Han Xiao, Lin Yao, and Qi Bai Jia would rotate to monitor the situation.Di Su Su\u2019s team soon arrived at the crowded town, which was displayed on the screens. There were many different types of buildings, and despite the housing being simple and crude, there were many people there, making it look like a marketplace. Although the town was small in area, it had everything, even hotels for guests.\u201cLet\u2019s look for a place to stay first.\u201dDi Su Su and the gang were questioned by the locals, but she answered perfectly. They were just \u2018wanderers that were migrating\u2019 and \u2018wanted to rest here for a while before moving off.\u2019 Afterwards, they successfully checked in at one of the hotels in the town.As soon as they entered the room, they immediately swept for monitoring cameras and bugs professionally. They started discussing their next steps after they made sure the room was safe.\u201cHow should we proceed now?\u201d Li Ya Lin curled her lips and gave Di Su Su a cold look.Di Su Su was not in the mood to banter with Li Ya Lin. Her brows knitted together as she said in a serious tone, \u201cPeople in the town are still suspicious of our ident.i.ty. I think we should stay put.\u201dHan Xiao suddenly chimed in through the earpieces. \u201cYou guys had better act today.\u201d\u201cGive me a good reason.\u201d Di Su Su was slightly provoked.\u201cYou guys are now foreign wanderers, so you should act your part. It is only normal to gather information about this place. It will actually look strange if you purposefully conceal yourselves, making others feel that you have an ulterior motive.\u201dEveryone looked at one another. \u201cThat seems like a good point.\u201d\u201c\u2026Let\u2019s do what Han Xiao suggested.\u201dThe town had many amenities, including entertainment facilities, casinos, a pharmacy, restaurants, and even places for one to release. As night fell, the team moved out in different groups and pretended to spend money, probe for intel, and gather information. However, they did not achieve any substantial success. The locals there were mostly ordinary wanderers, and they did not spot any people of interest.\u201cOur enemies must be hiding deeply. We probably won\u2019t get anything through this method.\u201d Qi Bai Jia\u2019s expression was grave.\u201cActually, I know a way.\u201d Han Xiao smiled. He knew the specific spy that was station at this town. After \u2018real\u2019 players earned enough reputation from missions, they could choose to join the Germinal Organization through this NPC. By catching this NPC, they could get quite a lot of intel.Han Xiao knew the exact coordinates of the Dark Crow Valley Base, but he was unsure of the specific military strength and defenses of the base. After ten long years, he only remembered a little information about the place. Furthermore, they were at the different point in time, so the changes would be different. It was essential for them to gather intel from the NPC.\u201cYou guys should go to the southern part of town, where you will see a casino. There should be a bald-headed dude who knows the intel about the base.\u201d Han Xiao was describing the spy from the Germinal Organization stationed at the town. Those \u2018real\u2019 players who were born at Dark Crow Forest Town could only join the Germinal Organization through this guy.Everyone was shocked. Di Su Su frowned. \u201cWhere did you get this information from?\u201d\u201cI have my ways.\u201d\u201cWhat if the information is incorrect?\u201d Di Su Su was adamant.\u201cListen to him.\u201d Qi Bai Jia spoke up for Han Xiao. Before the mission, higher ups had told him to trust his intel. This showed that the higher ups valued Han Xiao highly.Di Su Su had to repress her suspicion and follow to the order. She took some agents to the small casino and looked for the person quietly. Without fail, they found the bald-headed guy, who was the banker of the casino.\u201cWhat should we do now? If we act rashly, we could alarm our enemies. He might have companions from the organization around him,\u201d asked Di Su Su.Han Xiao was speechless. \u201cWe\u2019ve already found our target. Can\u2019t you just be professional and do what you usually do?\u201dDi Su Su felt her chest tighten, enraged by his comment. But at the same time, she realized that she had asked a dumb question. She gathered her teammates to secretly surround the guy.Han Xiao looked at the time. He got up and let Lin Yao take over his duty. He did not feel that he needed to supervise the actual execution. If they could not even catch the guy, those agents should just knock themselves out with a piece of tofu.At the same time, Winna and her team of Hesla agents left for their objective after she gave Han Xiao a fierce glare.Han Xiao did not plan to rest at the secret base. He went into the trunk of Big Black and started a.s.sessing the situation. Both operations are team-based. They will most likely complete them without any hiccups. I should be more concerned with my personal mission. I will need some handy tools in order to a.s.sa.s.sinate the sentry guards in the forest.Han Xiao took out some spare parts and began working on his interface._____________________Do you wish to proceed with talent fusion?(Basic Spatial Sensing + Basic Bio-engineering + Basic Mechanical Engineering)This fusion will cost you 15,000 EXP._____________________Fusion Success!Congratulations, you have invented [Miniature Biological Sensor (Spider)]!\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u2026Winna\u2019s team sneaked among the trees silently as if they were hunters searching for prey in the dark forest. They were wearing camouflage suits and night-vision goggles.The sentry guards were stationed right outside the base. One of the team members was a master in investigating trails. He could deduce the number of people that had walked past a location a day before based on the minimal evidence left behind.He was called Magarnu, a tall Sharnuk. He was built like a small mountain, which made it hard to believe that he was extremely meticulous. He rubbed the soil between his fingertips, smelt it, and pondered for a few moments. \u201cThere was a man, weighing around 180 pounds, who walked past here in a northwestern direction seven hours ago.\u201dWinna did not doubt Magarnu\u2019s deduction. She and her team walked carefully in that direction. Suddenly, they came to a halt. Night vision goggles showed a living ent.i.ty on tree three hundred meters out.\u201cSearch the surroundings!\u201dWinna kept a cool head and did not act prematurely. She instructed her team to search for any other sentry guards or surveillance devices in the surroundings. After about twenty minutes, they confirmed that they were safe.Ye Fan gave the order through the radio. \u201cTake him down!\u201dWinna activated her power, and immediately, a maroon energy trail flashed under her feet. She moved swiftly and quietly within a hundred-meter radius from the enemy. She always stayed in the blind spots of the enemy by using the trees to hide her body like a master-level a.s.sa.s.sin. She hopped onto a tree in a cat-like manner before summoning her maroon-colored energy. The energy allowed her to stick onto the tree branches, and she jumped constantly from tree to tree, quickly approaching the enemy.The Germinal sentry guard felt a sudden gust of wind over his head. He looked up and saw a dark shadow accelerating toward him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The level of defense gradually increases from the innermost to the outermost sectors. We are currently at the outermost region.\u201cEvery high-alert region will have a sentry post manned by an officer and his troops. Based on our previous interrogation, officers have access to the intranet of the military base. Therefore, as long as we can arrive at the sentry post, we will be able to access the intranet and gather intelligence using the officer\u2019s computer.\u201cThis sentry guard revealed the exact position of the post. Let\u2019s move out immediately!\u201dYe Fan knew that even the slightest delay would change the outcome of the operation. There was a series of protocols to follow for the s.h.i.+ft-changing of the sentry guards in the next few hours; by then, other soldiers would discover the disappearance of the sentry guard who had been killed. However, their first priority was still to gather sufficient intelligence even if that risked revealing their positions, since ultimately, the enemy would realize the impending invasion by the Hesla military. They needed to find out the military strength and defenses at the Dark Crow Valley base.If Winna managed to succeed, the agents of Division 13 hiding in Dark Crow Forest Town would fall into the precarious situation of revealing their positions to the enemy. The agents might even be caught before they made their moves.Ye Fan a.n.a.lyzed the situation rationally and made the decision.\u201cOperation approved! Immediately head out to the enemy base.\u201dWinna nodded and disposed of the sentry guard\u2019s body. She then led her teammates into the enemy base.Ye Fan heaved a sigh of relief, and his eyes moved away from the screen. He glanced at the operations\u2019 office of Division 13 and shook his head slightly. He did not know what his decision would bring, but he wanted the best for the mission. He would inform the department afterwards.There were times when one had to take a leap of faith.\u2026Before twilight, Winna and her team found the sentry post.It was a shed camouflaged deep in the vegetation used by the hunters.Quietly, the team moved closer to their target. Magarnu grabbed the sound-wave detector from his haversack and scanned the interior of the shed from outside. The results returned revealed three human targets: one lying on the sofa and two who seemed to be consuming their supper at the table.Winna raised her hand and started the count.Three, two, one! Winna leapt forward into the shed through the window. Her teammates followed behind.The three enemy soldiers were shocked by the unexpected attack, and before they could retaliate, they were shot with the tranquilizers by the Hesla agents and collapsed onto the ground.The Hesla agents then searched the shed and the clothing of the unconscious soldiers. They uncovered a hidden compartment behind the wall. The agents discovered that out of the three soldiers, one of them was an officer based on the ident.i.ty card he carried.\u201cThis is our target.\u201d Winna grinned to herself. This officer by the name of Roman seemed to be the one in charge of the sentry post.The agents tied Roman up and gave him an injection to wake him up. Magarnu then slapped Roman repeatedly to speed up the process. \u201cTell us the pa.s.sword to the safe if you want to live!\u201dRoman was scared to death by the troop of heavily armed agents and immediately confessed the pa.s.sword without any sign of hesitance.After entering the pa.s.sword, the safe successfully opened, and a laptop could be seen. After turning on the laptop, a sign-in page appeared on the screen, and both the ident.i.ty card and a verbal pa.s.sword were required to access the portal.Roman was very cooperative, and the agents managed to access the portal with his account. Following the jingle, the words \u2018Dang Dang Dang the Germinal a.s.sistant is at your service.\u2019 flashed on the screen.Startled, Ye Fan choked on his coffee.All the agents had confused looks on their faces. No one could have imagined that the portal\u2019s interface would look like that.Ye Fan didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cWhat a cute portal\u2026\u201dA couple of menus appeared on the server, and due to the low rank of Roman, he could only access a few of them. Winnie found the page that displayed the daily activity log for the military base, and the team became really excited.There must be important information hidden in the daily logs.\u201cLet me do it.\u201d Ye Fan instructed Magarnu to plug the chip into the computer, which allowed Ye Fan\u2019s computer to also access the server.There was a look of seriousness on Ye Fan\u2019s face, and his fingers started to punch the keyboard and input the codes like a b.u.t.terfly dancing in the air.Level 1 Firewall, hacked!Level 2 Firewall, hacked!Level 3 Firewall, hacked!One-time-pa.s.sword, hacked!Rights restrictions, hacked!Ye Fan gave a slight smile. He was a seasoned hacker in Hesla with hundreds of viruses and bugs in his a.r.s.enal. Except for certain servers on the dark web, there was practically no server that could escape his attacks.In less than three minutes, all the encrypted doc.u.ments were decoded. At that point, the enemy technicians realized what was happening and started deleting the doc.u.ments frantically while Ye Fan was copying the files.In a brief moment, all the doc.u.ments were deleted. Ye Fan\u2019s computer was too slow and only managed to copy 28% of the doc.u.ments. The more confidential doc.u.ments were deleted first.However, the copied doc.u.ments contained sufficient intelligence, including defense blueprints, internal structure information, and the military strength of the base.Ye Fan felt relieved. \u201cGood job and well done! Now it\u2019s time to return.\u201dThe attempt to steal sensitive information about the Dark Crow Valley base would definitely heighten the security of the enemy. However, it was all worth it for the intelligence reports.But despite the success, there was still a sense of unease in Ye Fan.It seemed a little\u2026 too easy.\u2026A member of staff from the central control room of the Dark Crow Valley base reported, \u201cSir, our external server was hacked.\u201dThe a.s.sistant director of the military base was Ji Jie. He was a tall, lanky man with a sly appearance. He proceeded calmly to the screened and asked, \u201cWhat data was stolen?\u201d\u201cThe daily activity logs, internal structure of the military base, the coordinates of the base, the sentry logs for the base\u2026\u201dEven though so much critical information had been stolen by the hackers, there was no sign of panic within the base.\u201cWere the hackers actually from Hesla?\u201d\u201cThe bait is set; now, we are just waiting for the fish.\u201d Ji Jie gave an eerie grin. He was like a hunter, excited to see the prey he had managed to trap.Ji Jie went into the director\u2019s office and reported the situation to Pan Kuang.\u201cOur external deceptive server was hacked. I presume the hackers to be from Hesla, and they will probably launch a military invasion soon.\u201dPan Kuang was polis.h.i.+ng his dark, long machete with his handkerchief. The machete had an icy cold blade and a thick body with its handle wrapped with strips of cloth. There were clear spots of dried blood on the cloth. The machete had been used to slay many enemies throughout the years.Pan Kuang was fixated on polis.h.i.+ng his blade. He then asked calmly, \u201cWhat do you think we should do?\u201dJi Jie cleared his throat and said, \u201cAlthough the information stolen by the enemy is false, we have unfortunately revealed the existence of the base. Therefore, I hope that the chief can evacuate the base and bring along all necessary equipment and information. In addition, I also recommend that we deal a hard and decisive blow to the existing enemy forces.\u201d\u201dOk, just tell me when you need me to fight,\u201d Pan Kuang replied.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He looked out of the car\u2019s window to see it was twilight, and the sky was a grayish blue hue and was gradually getting brighter.The previous night, Han Xiao had been busy creating new machines and only had two hours of sleep. He took out his water bottle and splashed the water onto his face. The cooling splashes refreshed his senses. Then, he went out of the storage and headed for the base.Lin Yao had worked throughout the night, and she was exhausted. Qi Bai Jia was next in line for the s.h.i.+ft, and he woke up from his nap on the couch.\u201cHow was last night\u2019s operation?\u201d Han Xiao asked.Lin Yao replied with fatigue, \u201cThe bald guy revealed the positions of his comrades to us in the forest, and we managed to apprehend them. Also, we discovered the exact location of the Dark Crow Valley base from the captives\u2019 statements. However, our prisoners are low-ranking personnel, and therefore, they do not have the authority to access confidential files.\u201dHan Xiao nodded to himself. The outcome was what he expected.\u201cIs the operation team still in action?\u201d\u201cYes, the agents are all still hidden in the forest, waiting for new orders.\u201d\u201cThere is no point waiting in the forest. The agents should return,\u201d said Han Xiao.Qi Bai Jia, who was munching on his breakfast rations, blurted out, \u201cHey, I am supposed to be in-charge here.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you in-charge because you are supposed to take the blame for all of us?\u201d Han Xiao questioned.Qi Bai Jia choked on his rations. He wanted to rebut Han Xiao but was interrupted by Ye Fan.\u201cFellow agents of Division 13, our guys have successfully obtained critical intelligence of the Dark Crow Valley base.\u201dQi Bai Jia was puzzled. In less than a day, the Hesla agents had managed to complete the mission. Their efficiency seemed too impressive to be true!\u201cYou guys really secured information about the base?\u201dYe Fan nodded in affirmation. \u201cWinna captured an enemy officer. Our operation is done, and we are getting our agents back. After which, we will compile the gathered intelligence and pa.s.s the critical information to the military.\u201dAlthough it was claimed that the mission was completed, Han Xiao\u2019s tablet indicated that [Reconnaissance 2] was not completed. He frowned and then questioned, \u201cCan you ensure that the information we obtained is accurate and not fake. Also, can you explain the flow of events to us?\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d Ye Fan and Winna briefly described the completed operation.\u201cDon\u2019t you think the mission seemed to be too smooth-sailing?\u201d muttered Han Xiao.\u201cThe mission was indeed easy, but there is nothing especially suspicious. Perhaps, it was a result of the enemy letting their guard down. Also, our mission this time was supposed to be a covert a.s.sault.\u201d\u201cI have second thoughts to the reliability of the information obtained.\u201d\u201cIn our line of work, we must not be too trusting, but you must also back your word with evidence.\u201d The frustrated Ye Fan frowned even harder and ordered, \u201cIn any case, we will move out at dawn tomorrow.\u201dLooking at the Ye Fan\u2019s back as he left, Han Xiao\u2019s face dimmed. He could confirm with hundred-percent certainty that there was something wrong with the intelligence gathered by Ye Fan.Han Xiao started thinking about the events that Ye Fan had described. Although Winna and her fellow agents were a little too brash with their actions, they had not made any critical mistakes. Therefore, the only possibility was that Dark Crow Valley contained hidden traps that outsiders were unaware of.Han Xiao unfortunately had no evidence, and even if he voiced his opinions, n.o.body would believe him.A mere speculation was insufficient to convince anybody.\u201cLooks like I have to go and take a look at it myself.\u201dIn the morning, Di Su Su and Winna returned back to the base. Both brought with them their prisoners. Since Roman was an officer, his value exceeded that of all the prisoners brought in by Di Su Su.Winna beamed with pride like a victor. In her opinion, the operation was likened to a battle between the two countries of agents. It was exhilarating for her that the agents from Hesla had trumped the agents from Stardragon.The agents from Division 13 were irritated by the arrogance of the agents from Hesla. Li Ya Lin remarked, \u201cIf we were the ones in charge of your mission, we would have been winners ourselves.\u201dWinna smirked. \u201cAccept the sad truth that you guys lost.\u201dHan Xiao went forward and said, \u201cThe information you guys obtained might be fake.\u201dEven if the agents from Hesla did not believe him, Han Xiao still felt the obligation to voice that fact.Winna\u2019s face instantly slumped and questioned, \u201cAny evidence?\u201d\u201cMy intuition.\u201dEveryone was astonished by the answer.Winna laughed. \u201cThen I guess you have to shut up. Who do you think you are?\u201dHan Xiao calmly replied, \u201cDo you have any evidence then?\u201dWinna patted on the s.h.i.+vering Roman and said, \u201cHe is my evidence.\u201dHan Xiao squatted down and gave Roman a thorough scan. It seemed like the Dark Crow Valley base had a master of deception.Roman did seem to be genuinely frightened, and this showed that he was not providing fake information to the agents on purpose. Therefore, the only reasonable deduction was that the higher-ups of the enemy base had never intended to reveal genuine military information to their lower ranking officials. The sentry guards on the outer circ.u.mference of the base were merely posted as bait.The information obtained by Ye Fan was highly likely to be deceptive.To uncover the truth, Han Xiao needed to go deeper into the Dark Crow Valley base.A plan started formulating in Han Xiao\u2019s mind. However, he needed to wait till nightfall to execute the plan.All the other agents were busy interrogating the prisoners and consolidating the intelligence report. They would leave the next morning. Therefore, he could carry out his plan at night.\u2026Night arrived, and the bright moon masked the twinkle of the stars.Han Xiao told his fellow agents that he wanted to be in the truck.n.o.body replied. The agents of Hesla could not be bothered with him, and the agents from Division 13 were too lazy to say no. Only Zhang Wei said, \u201cGo if you really want to, n.o.body\u2019s stopping you.\u201dHan Xiao nodded. After which he proceeded out of the camp. He went into the container and equipped himself with Lambert\u2019s sniper-rifle. He also took other necessary equipment. After a few quick glances, he realized no one was present around the camp. Han Xiao sneaked out into the woodsHe did not plan to inform his teammates. Qi Bai Jia would surely not approve of his actions, and this would only create more trouble.After hours of trekking, he finally reached the stipulated location.Equipped with his thermo-tracking night vision goggles and camouflage suit, after confirming that there were no enemies around him, he started digging a trench deep enough to fit himself.After which, Han Xiao took out a small mechanical spider from his toolbox. The mechanical spider was the size of his palm. He flicked the switched, and the mechanical spider immediately stoop up before his eyes as if it was awaiting orders from its master.[Miniature biological sensor (Spider): Miniature bug-like sensor]This was the latest creation by Han Xiao. It was a practical tool due to its size, ability to camouflage, and ability to be remotely controlled. It also had thermo-sensors that enabled it to avoid other animals. It was like a walking surveillance camera. Han Xiao was not required to move up close to the sentry, and therefore, he was also less likely to be caught.Han Xiao took out his tablet computer to remotely control the spiders. He was able to locate the positions of several sentries and most of them were hidden beside trees. Han Xiao pictured the location of the sentries in his mind so that he could come up with an optimal route for the a.s.sa.s.sination he was going to carry out.Han Xiao carried the heavy sniper-rifle and trudged through the condensed vegetation. The target was now within the range of the rifle.Lambert\u2019s rifle had a silencer that allowed it to fire out a large beam of energy at a sound that was as light as a finger knocking on wood. In this dark and condensed vegetation, a seasoned agent would able to spot the any slight movement within the range of one hundred meters. However, Lambert\u2019s rifle could be operated from a distance of eight hundred meters. It was also the main reason that compelled Han Xiao to select this weapon for the mission, which offered greater safety and convenience.Han Xiao looked into the scope with great concentration and held his breath. The distance somehow did not matter, and Han Xiao could feel the adrenaline rus.h.i.+ng through him.The target was the enemy\u2019s head!The wind was blowing in 8 o\u2019clock direction!Wind-speed at 1.3 m/s with a 43 mm inaccuracy!All the corrections and modifications were completed.Han Xiao pulled the trigger. His body absorbed all the recoil coming from the b.u.t.t of the rifle, and his hands gripped the rifle to stabilize it.Through the thermo-sensing scope, Han Xiao could see that the bullet had managed to hit the target. The target had instantly lost his head, and blood was spurting out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Like a watermelon pounded by a hammer, the head disintegrated into bits and pieces.Through the video feed transmitted from the spider, Han Xiao adjusted his position and stabilized himself again, before firing a shot at another sentry guard. One shot after another, the sentry guards were eliminated. The interface flashed with each successful kill made by Han Xiao._____________________The sudden blast is charged up to 200% and ready to be deployed.The enemy has been successfully eliminated by the fatal blast.

Their fighting abilities were similar to those of the guards back at the lab where Han Xiao had once been held captive. Han Xiao had no issues wiping out the lab guards back then. Likewise, he had no problems now.One after another, the sentry guards were killed, and Han Xiao gained 18,000 EXP from the kills.[Forest a.s.sa.s.sin mission completed, you gained 18,000 EXP.]The mission proceeded smoothly. After killing so many sentry guards, reinforcements were bound to arrive\u2026 and there they came!The Spider detected three fully-armed quick-response teams approaching in their jeeps. After the jeeps pulled up, the team members hopped down and started conducting thorough searches.The sentry guards had their earpieces, which enabled them to connect main communications network. If a sentry guard was killed, their radio channel would fall silent. If a large number of channels operated by the sentry guards fell silent, it would raise suspicions at the Dark Crow Valley Base, which would dispatch quick-response teams to the field to investigate the situation in response.Han Xiao predicted that once the quick-response teams discovered the murdered sentry-guards, they would start searching intensely. Through the \u2018eyes\u2019 of the Spider, which he s.h.i.+fted up the tree, he could observe that the troopers were equipped with Jackson machine guns, high-explosive grenades, and RPG rocket launchers. Instantly, Han Xiao called off the plan of challenging these heavily armed troopersIt was the perfect time for Han Xiao to flee.Han Xiao disa.s.sembled the heavy sniper and lugged it onto his shoulders. Clad in his camouflage suit, he sneakily shuffled to the trench he had dug. He transferred all the unnecessary accessories into the toolbox and then dumped both his sniper rifle and toolbox into the trench.At that instant, the search-teams discovered the headless sentry guards. The armed troopers immediately started searching warily, using the torchlights on their machine guns.The tree beside the trench was Han Xiao\u2019s hiding spot. The spot had been carefully selected by Han Xiao. It was at the edge of the high-alert sector. The further away from the enemy base, the more dispersed the enemy troopers would be. It was likely that the troopers would search the area alone.The rays of a torchlight flashed beside the tree. Han Xiao gradually lowered his body and held the thin metal wires tightly. He concentrated all the energy in his legs and was preparing to launch himself forward like a mantis.The moment the trooper\u2019s foot crossed the tree\u2019s body, Han Xiao moved his body like a phantom and instantly went behind the sentry guard. Although the enemy had already detected Han Xiao\u2019s movement and had intended to fire at him and call for help, Han Xiao reacted faster and managed to strangle the trooper by coiling the metal cables around the trooper\u2019s neck.Han Xiao then kicked the trooper\u2019s machine gun to one side. After which, he wrestled the trooper to the ground. The trooper\u2019s entire upper body was resting beneath his knees.The suffocation caused the trooper\u2019s face to turn purple. It was as if the blood was going to burst out of the vessels. At this point in time, the metal cables had already pierced into the flesh of the trooper. The trooper waved his hands hysterically, trying to grab Han Xiao by any means, but it was to no avail. The trooper\u2019s eyes also flipped upwards.Han Xiao maintained the tension until the interface indicated that the trooper was dead.Throughout the entire process, he had managed to keep the struggling trooper silent.Han Xiao quickly changed into the trooper\u2019s uniform. The trooper was a Caucasian of similar height to himself. He quickly used his pocket knife to trim his hair. After which, he straightened his collar and pulled the sleeves tight to ensure none of his skin was showing, since he was of a different skin tone from the trooper. He then used his finger to tap his forehead to activate the face scanner. A light beam emerged from his forehead and scanned the dead trooper\u2019s face.Replicate the scan!Almost immediately, Han Xiao\u2019s face morphed into that of the trooper!That was the trump card to be used in his successful infiltration.He dumped the dead trooper\u2019s body and the unwanted accessories into a hole and buried the contents. He then marked out the area. Han Xiao, clad in a trooper\u2019s uniform, made his way forward blatantly. He could also clearly hear the conversations on the enemy\u2019s communication channel.\u201cThis is H103 reporting. Everything is fine in the northwest sector.\u201d\u201cThis is H141 reporting. Everything is fine in the southeast sector.\u201dThe call-sign of the trooper that Han Xiao had killed was H223. Han Xiao made his report in a similar fas.h.i.+on using his suppressed voice.\u201cH223, what happened to your voice?\u201d A man that seemed to be his captain spoke.\u201cI have a sore throat.\u201dAfter \u2018searching\u2019 the area for a while, Han Xiao was recalled. More than twenty troopers gathered at the jeep, and Han Xiao had not yet raised any suspicions.The captain asked, \u201cNone of you found anything?\u201d\u201cNo sir,\u201d the troopers replied.The captain frowned and said, \u201cGet in the car. Let\u2019s head back to base.\u201dHan Xiao squinted. He had managed to infiltrate the team, and it was all part of his plan to enter the Dark Crow Valley base.\u2026The car drove into a cave, and three minutes later, an unexpected sight appeared before Han Xiao\u2019s eyes.There was something special about the cave; it was actually a mini car-park.The jeep pulled over, and the troopers alighted from it. Han Xiao tagged along with the team and came before a wall of rocks. The captain pulled out a rock that was actually a modified metal casing that contained a card-scanner.The captain scanned his ident.i.ty card, and following a boom, the rock wall split open. At this point, Han Xiao realized that the rock wall was a metal gate in disguise. The gate was sprayed with a greyish paint, and it looked very much like a rock. One would be unable to tell the difference if he or she did not examine the wall closely.How strange. This looks exactly like what the agents from Hesla reported.Han Xiao was confused. All of this had actually been detailed in Ye Fan\u2019s intelligence reports. It was all accurate information. However, why did the interface claim that \u2018Reconnaissance 2\u2019 was not yet completed?What was the problem exactly? Could it be something to do with the time? Perhaps the base appeared differently at different times of the day?Han Xiao proceeded together with the rest, and they came upon a gantry. After scanning his ident.i.ty card, he was finally into the base.The base was hidden deep in the ground. It was supported by metallic structure, which added a cool greyish tone everywhere. There were winding corridors and many rooms. The troopers were busy transporting containers of items.Han Xiao lifted his head, and he could see a surveillance camera positioned at the corner of the ceiling. He retracted his neck instinctively.Going behind enemy lines alone was tough, and Han Xiao prayed for the success of his operation.So, now that I am in the base, what shall I do next? Hang around aimlessly or chat someone up\u2026 better not. Chatting with someone will likely reveal my ident.i.ty. What information am I hunting for exactly? Since for \u2018Reconnaissance 2\u2019, I am supposed to uncover critical intelligence with regards to the Dark Crow Valley base, there must be some loopholes here! Since the low-ranking officers serve merely as bait, most of the people are not likely to have access to important information. I need to find someone that looks and acts differently from the rest.Once this thought flashed in Han Xiao\u2019s mind, he started wandering about the base, carefully examining every inch.\u2026\u201c13 sentry guards were killed?\u201dJi Jie frowned in disbelief. Based on his prediction, since the enemy agents had obtained the necessary intelligence, they would not kill any sentry guards. Unless, they were suspicious of the information they stole.It appeared that these invaders were indeed meticulous and careful with their actions.Ji Jie shook his head and said proudly, \u201cBut they are still greenhorns.\u201dThe double-server network was the best trap Ji Jie had ever planted during his stint as the a.s.sistant officer in-charge of the base. Its sole purpose was to prevent invaders from attacking, and now, the security network\u2019s effect was finally showing.If only false information was planted, it would only raise the suspicions of the invading agents. Therefore, to deceive his enemies, Ji Jie was willing to risk his life and included some true information in the bait. The information included were the exact location of the base, the deployment of the sentry guards, and defense mechanisms in the third and sixth high-alert sectors. To successfully trick the enemies, a certain degree of true information needed to be weaved in with the false. The final two sectors had defense mechanisms with firepower that was more than ten times stronger than the rest. There was also another trump card.\u201cThe chief has approved the path of the retreat. Reinforcements will arrive in five days. That will also be the day for the retreat. For now, let\u2019s deliver a huge present to Hesla.\u201dThe main forces of the Germinal organization were concentrated on the continent of Andrea. The Germinal Organization had also covertly extended its influence to the other continents through setting up secret facilities and bases. These bases remained hidden, and if they were discovered, the Germinal Organization would order the retreat as it was impossible for a single facility to withstand the raids from the military forces of the six nations.Ji Jie was highly confident of his trap. He was not afraid to expose real information and the location of the base. He had one trump card in his hand. All the other troopers, and even the base itself, could be sacrificed in order to deal a strategic and painful blow to Hesla.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Han Xiao had many experiences infiltrating enemy bases. Thus, he was very calm and walked as fast as blowing wind, without alarming anyone.He gradually understood more about the base after exploring it for a while. The base was hidden at the hill side, and it was about five to six times larger than the laboratory that he used to stay in. The base had two exits: one was the entrance that he took; the other was a side gate for the individual personnel to access the outside world conveniently.Not knowing why, Han Xiao felt that some places in the base were unusual. However, he could not pinpoint the exact reasons.Most of the personnel had a serious face, as if they were expecting an incoming storm. They were loading up important supplies hurriedly.\u201cHave you heard? The higher ups want us to evacuate the base. It seems like Hesla\u2019s agents have found us.\u201d\u201cThey mentioned that the spy stationed at Crow Forest Town lost contact. I think a battle is going to happen soon.\u201dHan Xiao heard some voices as he turned a corner. A few armed guards were gathered together and having a discussion. They looked worried. As they saw Han Xiao, one of the guards shouted, \u201cHey Mandela, did you guys find anything from the search inside?\u201dMandela was H223\u2019s real name. He was a Caucasian. Han Xiao covered his skins fully with his uniform so that the rest would not get suspicious.These few guards seemed to be acquainted with Mandela. \u201cThe sentry guards outside were all shot in the head by a sniper. We still haven\u2019t uncovered the enemy. I bet it was done by the Hesla agents,\u201d lied Han Xiao while innocently blinking.The guards looked troubled. They were all armed personnel, so if the enemy were to strike, they had to be at the frontline to defend the base.\u201cI am so jealous of the non-military personnel. They get to evacuate the base first.\u201d One of the guards was disgruntled with his circ.u.mstances.Light flashed in Han Xiao\u2019s eyes. Since they were up against an army from Hesla, it was predicted that the enemy was going to evacuate the base. Furthermore, this was only a supplemental base, not a main one; it was impossible for everyone to stay back and fight to their death.However, evacuation was not an easy feat; too many people leaving at the same time risked leaving trails in the forest for the Hesla army to track. So, it was essential to leave some military personnel to stay behind and cover their tracks, while the officers and non-military personnel leave first with important supplies, which were more valuable than those armed guards. They would only get to leave after the more important personnel had evacuated safely.The final Camp-Destroyer mission was to destroy the entire base, which included their personnel. If they only took hold of an empty base, the completion rating of the mission would be really low.A thought suddenly occurred in Han Xiao\u2019s mind. They already know Hesla is going to attack the base; they should have evacuated by now. Ye Fan\u2019s team infiltrated the base last night, which was twenty-four hours ago. They should have had enough time to leave. This is strange.A muscular-looking guy walked over and shouted, \u201cWhat are you idling here for\u203d Don\u2019t you have things to carry\u203d\u201dThe guards apologized in great trepidation. It was the captain of the base\u2019s security team, Dormund, a buff Sharnuk.A core member like him would definitely know the secrets about this base.Dormund left after some reprimanding, and Han Xiao followed from a distance behind. After turning a few corners, Han Xiao was dumbfounded. He barely looked away for two seconds, and Dormund was already missing from his sight.There was no one on the walkway, only a storage room.Han Xiao walked over to the room and turned the k.n.o.b. It was not locked.He pushed the door open and walked inside. The room was about a hundred square meters, and it was filled with miscellaneous items, with no one else inside. The lamp was not switched on, and the light from the walkway s.h.i.+ned through gap beneath the door.Han Xiao knitted his brows as he suddenly realized something unusual.The room was spotless, and the floor was clear of any footprints.Normally, very few individuals would go into the storage room. Even five-star hotels would not send people to clean their storage unit like this, so it was impossible for the Germinal Organization to keep an ordinary storage room as immaculate as this.There must be a secret door somewhere here. Otherwise, Dormund would not have disappeared so quickly. But Han Xiao could not locate the door.What would be behind the secret door?All of a sudden, Han Xiao pretended to cough while bending his back. He took this chance to take out the Spider from his pocket. He then threw it into the corner silently before leaving the room immediately. He took out his tablet in a spot that was hidden from the surveillance cameras, switched the Spider on, and stared at the storage room.It took Han Xiao two hours of high intensity monitoring, during which he started to become quite weary, before that was some movement in the storage room.One of the walls creaked open, and a secret metal door was shown. Two people, unarmed, walked out. They seemed to be technical staff.There is my secret door.As the two personnel left the room hurriedly, Han Xiao followed behind quietly. He suddenly sped up to b.u.mp onto the staff from the back. Three of them almost fell.\u201cSorry. Sorry. I am really sorry about this,\u201d Han Xiao apologized as he stabilized the two staff with his hands.They did not make a fuss over it and left.Han Xiao turned around to continue following them. However, this time round, he had gotten a white card. It was an access card from the pocket of one of the two staff.His stealing skill had come in really handy.This card had no noticeable difference from the ordinary ident.i.ty card from the base. However, Han Xiao believed that the chip inside should be different; it should have access to the secret door.He followed the two staff for a while and arrived at the side gate of the base. The two greeted the door guard and left through the gate.All of a sudden, Han Xiao realized what was wrong with the base.Atmosphere!Although most people were worried sick over the incoming Hesla attack, a small group of personnel still held on to their posts without any anxiety. They seemed to have some backup plans and were as calm as the sea\u2014greatly contrasting the first group of personnel.Han Xiao squinted and soon arrived at a reasonable deduction. However, he still needed some evidence to confirm his thought. He went forth toward the side gate before the door guard stopped him.\u201cYou are not allowed to enter or leave the base without a mission.\u201dHan Xiao took out the access card he had stolen and said, \u201cI b.u.mped into those two people just now, and they dropped this card. I want to return it to them before they walk away.\u201dThe door guard nodded his head before allowing Han Xiao to go.Han Xiao walked out of the gate and saw a forested valley; it was already past midnight. The two staff were few hundred meters away, so one could only see their tiny back view. He chased them up quickly.The staff turned around as they heard footsteps coming from behind and looked guarded.\u201cYou dropped your access card.\u201dAs Han Xiao walked near, they realized that he was the colleague that they b.u.mped into in the base beforehand. They let down their guard. One of the duo searched his pockets and exclaim, \u201cWhere did I drop the card\u203d Thank you very much.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me. We are all comrades of the Germinal Organization, working hard to build a new tomorrow. This is just a part of my job.\u201dHan Xiao smiled as he walked closer to them.\u201cYou are quite an interesting guy.\u201dThe person laughed while he moved his hand over to grab the card. Han Xiao\u2019s face instantly turned serious, and he launched his attack all of a sudden. His fist punched hard onto the person\u2019s stomach, injuring the internal organs with its shear force. The person stared with astonishment, as his vomited. The other person almost screamed before Han Xiao quickly grabbed his neck to choke him. He them slammed his head onto the floor and slapped them as hard as could, knocking them out.Han Xiao took off his belt to tie the two personnel. He dragged them behind him while taking a big detour to avoid all the sentry posts. As soon as he had moved far enough away from the base, he slapped the two awake.They woke up with faces full of horror. \u201cYou\u2026you are not from the base!\u201dHan Xiao took out his foldable machete and rubbed its blade. He was clearly threatening them. He said in an ice-cold voice, \u201cI know the two of you know something that the ordinary members are kept in the dark about. You\u2019d better tell me honestly now.\u201dThey gulped in fear and stuttered, \u201cWe are just low-ranking members who do not know anything.\u201d\u201cLow-ranking?\u201d Han Xiao laughed before he moved his knife swiftly toward one man\u2019s crotch.\u201cAhhhh\u2026\u201dThe person screamed as if his soul was tearing apart, like a pig that was being butchered. But he suddenly realized he was not in pain. He looked down and saw the s.h.i.+ny blade had grazed past his inner thigh and cut into the soil beneath. It was only three centimeters from his genitalia. His crouch could feel the chill from the cold metal blade.\u201cI know that is a secret door in the storage room. Tell me everything you know, or I will make you the first eunuch in the Germinal Organization,\u201d Han Xiao said in a murderous tone.Although they did not know what a eunuch was, Han Xiao\u2019s action was quite telling. They were badly shaken up immediately.\u201cHow\u2026 how did you learn about the secret door\u203d\u201d\u201cI am the one asking questions.\u201d Han Xiao lifted his machete to brush his genitalia gently, as if he would just lop it off at any moment. He was so frightened that he almost peed his pants and\u2026 He really peed his pants? d.a.m.n\u2026 my machete!The two staff looked crestfallen. Since the secret was out, there was no point in hiding. They spilled the intel as they trembled in fear.After ten minutes\u2026Han Xiao\u2019s brows were knitted tightly together.\u201cNo wonder\u2026\u201d[Reconnaissance 2 completed.

Where are you?\u201d Lin Yao slapped on the door of the truck\u2019s container. He looked frustrated. He had been trying to find Han Xiao for the past fifteen minutes, but his efforts had been futile. The rest of the agents from Division 13 were running out of patience.\u201cHe is not in the truck. Where could he possibly have gone?\u201d Li Ya Lin was puzzled.Everyone looked at one another and did not have a single clue.Last night, Han Xiao had mentioned that he wanted to stay on the truck, but now, he was not there. What exactly did he do last night?\u201cWhat is your team\u2019s plan?\u201d Qi Bai Jia said to Zhang Wei\u2019s team.\u201cWe are going to stay back to wait for his return,\u201d Zhang Wei replied.\u201cIs there a need to do so?\u201d Di Su Su was rather surprised.\u201cBecause the truck key is with him!\u201d Zhang Wei was gnas.h.i.+ng his teeth in great anger, and the vein on his forehead was about to pop at any moment.Everyone was rendered speechless, not sure whether they were lucky or unlucky to have such a member on their team.Qi Bai Jia was very displeased as he hated any unexpected changes during a mission. Just when he thought Han Xiao had a clear understanding of the big picture, he caused trouble like this.I must be blind! Any team member who acts on their own accord without following any order is a rascal!If something went haywire, Qi Bai Jia would have to a.s.sume the responsibility!Han Xiao was such a jacka.s.s!\u2026The Hesla agents stationed on the other side discovered Division 13\u2019s unusual behavior, and they started discussing secretly.\u201cSome of the Division 13\u2019s agents are intending to stay behind.\u201d\u201cI thought we agreed to move together?\u201d Ye Fan frowned. He went to find Qi Bai Jia to get an answer on this. After which, he came back and explained the reason to the Hesla agents.\u201cWho is the agent missing?\u201d\u201cIt was the agent that was wearing the mask; his name is Han Xiao.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s him.\u201d Winna\u2019s face suddenly tensed up, and said, \u201cLast night, when we received the intel, Han Xiao rejected it without any supporting evidence, and then he was gone for the whole night without leaving a message. This seems quite suspicious. Is it possible that he is a\u2026 spy?\u201dAll the Hesla agents startled.\u201cBe careful of your words.\u201d Ye Fan frowned. He did not buy that deduction, but Han Xiao\u2019s actions definitely aroused his suspicion. \u201cWe will report all the facts to the commanding officer when we get back to the army camp.\u201d\u2026.After all the other agents left, Zhang Wei and the other three teammates stayed back at the base.Lin Yao could not help asking, \u201cWhere did Han Xiao go and what is he going to do exactly?\u201d\u201cHow would I know? He did not say anything to me last night.\u201d Li Ya Lin rolled her eyes.Zhang Wei shook his head as he felt irritated; that guy had zero respect for his team leader!\u2026The other agents arrived at the border several hours later.Winna and Ye Fan went to report to Colonel Carl immediately.\u201cA Division 13 agent was missing for the entire night?\u201d Colonel Carl walked back and forth, and his brows furrowed.\u201cIs this 100% true?\u201d he asked.Winna nodded. \u201cHe left last night without telling anyone, and it was right after we uncovered the intel about the Dark Crow Valley base.\u201d\u201cAlthough it seems suspicious, this does not mean that he is a spy,\u201d Ye Fan added.Colonel Carl nodded slowly. \u201cI will go and clarify this with Stardragon a while later. Now, tell me more about the intel.\u201d\u201cThe captive that we brought in pa.s.sed our lie detector test, which means that everything he said was true. Furthermore, Ye Fan personally hacked their network to gather all this intel. We can guarantee its authenticity!\u201d said Winna.Colonel Carl\u2019s eyes turned sharp as he said decisively, \u201cThen let\u2019s attack immediately before anything changes!\u201dYe Fan was hesitant. \u201cThe Division 13 agents left at the secret base will be in danger if the army attacks now.\u201d\u201cTo achieve our strategic objective, it is reasonable to sacrifice one or two people from Stardragon. Since they are not from our country, we need not care so much.\u201d Colonel Carl did not give it a second thought.At the same time, after taking a long, indirect route, Han Xiao finally brought the two captives to where he had hidden his toolbox, bypa.s.sing all the detectors and sentry posts. The whole journey had been arduous and onerous; he was so tired by then that he almost wanted to puke blood. The captives were not wearing camouflage suits, so he\u2019d had to spend hours to bypa.s.s the alert areas.Fortunately, they were the technical staff in charge of the testing detectors and landmines, so they provided much valuable information. Otherwise, he would not have left without alerting anyone.However, the captives had tried to lure him into a high-alert area to expose him once, but he\u2019d realized immediately. He had punished them harshly before they cooperated fully with him.The Sun was s.h.i.+ning brightly above the sky. Han Xiao calculated the time and sighed. \u201cc.r.a.p, I went beyond the stipulated time. I guess all the other agents have already left.\u201dHe dug out his toolbox and took out his radio equipment to contact Zhang Wei.\u201ch.e.l.lo. h.e.l.lo. Yangtze River. Yangtze River. This is Yellow River. Please reply if you can hear me.\u201d\u201cYellow your head!\u201d Zhang Wei\u2019s fury could be heard through the earpiece. \u201cWhere exactly did you go? You were missing for the whole night, and all the other agents left. We could only stay at the base and wait for you!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019d better make up for this. I want new equipment!\u201d Li Ya Lin chimed in on the radio channel. One could hear the annoyance in her voice and imagine her pouting; it was actually a little cute.Han Xiao shook his head and started acting more seriously. \u201cI infiltrated the Dark Crow Valley base and discovered top-cla.s.sified intel!\u201d\u201cLet me get Officer Qi for you,\u201d Zhang Wei said with a look of solemnity.\u2026Qi Bai Jia received the radio message at the border army camp.\u201cZhang Wei, what are you calling me for? Is Han Xiao back?\u201d he asked.\u201cHe wants to speak with you.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019d better cook up a good explanation for his actions.\u201d Qi Bai Jia was clearly displeased.After Han Xiao was connected to the channel, he said, \u201cI just received the intel saying that the Dark Crow Valley base has two sectors: the outer sector and the inner sector. The outer sector is where all the low-ranking personnel work, while the inner sector is where the core members stationed themselves. The inner sector is hidden deeper in the mountainous valley, and the low-ranking personnel outside are not even aware of its existence. The information about the inner sector is cla.s.sified for all the low-ranking personnel, and the path connecting the two sectors is always blocked\u2026\u201dThe two captives had told him that the base was divided into two sectors. The inner sector was hidden deeper in the mountains, where all the important supplies were stored. It was the real core of the base. The higher ups in the base did not tell the periphery personnel anything about the inner base. So, it was a secret to many of the Germinal Organization personnel. In their previous lives, the \u2018real\u2019 players did not even know the existence of the inner base.The inner base had many evacuation routes. The core members could leave without leaving a trace. They were very cunning in the sense that each of these roads was cla.s.sified. n.o.body knew which path they would take before the actual evacuation was decided by the top leaders.h.i.+p of the base.Qi Bai Jia understood the importance of this information immediately. If Hesla did not know about the existence of the inner sector of the base and the army went ahead to attack the outer base, they would simply retreat when they took down the outer base, declaring it a military success. In that case, the core force of the enemy would be entirely unharmed, and the inner base would remain safe. The enemy could move back secretly in the future, ensuring that hideout was secure from the enemies.Qi Bai Jia was dumbfounded. He could not believe that Han Xiao\u2019s solo act could bear such critical intel!\u201cCough, cough. Even though it was a move well played, I still have to emphasize that it is unacceptable to act on your own without any orders.\u201cHold on for a while. I will report this to the commanding officer immediately!\u201dQi Bai Jia was stopped by the deputy officer when he requested to meet Colonel Carl. He waited anxiously for five minutes before was allowed to go into the office. He realized Ye Fan and Winna were there too.Colonel Carl looked at Qi Bai Jia and asked, \u201cWhat do you have for me?\u201d\u201cOne of my team members just discovered some critical information that needs to be reported to you.\u201d\u201cHan Xiao?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dQi Bai Jia nodded, but he did not realize that the other three started having a weird look.Colonel Carl\u2019s eyes flickered. \u201cSpeak.\u201dHan Xiao repeated what he said before, and at the end, he added, \u201cIf we attack brashly, we will only take down an empty sh.e.l.l. I hope we can pause the operation until our guys get hold of the enemy\u2019s evacuation time, evacuation route, and the detailed structure of the inner base. By doing so, we can directly kill their evacuating troops and prevent a direct attack against their fortification. This will greatly reduce our casualties.\u201dColonel Carl was expressionless after he heard everything.\u201cWhere did you get this intel from?\u201d he suddenly asked.\u201cI infiltrated the base by disguising my face, and I managed to capture two personnel from the inner base\u2026\u201dAll of a sudden, Colonel Carl yelled, \u201cYou are lying!\u201dTo Colonel Carl, it was impossible for Han Xiao to infiltrate, even if he said he could disguise his face. It would take at least tens of minutes to make a legitimate face mask. During that time frame, Han Xiao would have faced all kinds of danger. At the same time, he could not predict which enemy he would encounter next, so it was impossible for him to make the face mask beforehand. So, it was an impossible situation that Han Xiao could never achieve.Han Xiao was startled. He realized that these people did not know the capability of his Facial Simulator.The function of the Facial Simulator was his trump card. He would not divulge such information. However, without exposing it, he could not explain the details of his infiltration.\u201cI have the capability to do so.\u201d Han Xiao had to give an ambiguous answer.\u201cUnless you can demonstrate, there is no way we can believe you.\u201dColonel Carl was still expressionless, but he was more untrusting of Han Xiao\u2019s words.This person\u2026 is really suspicious!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, Hesla had a different position. Both parties were mutually untrusting toward each other.Han Xiao paused and said, \u201cI have two captives with me. You can test them with a lie detector to confirm that I am not lying.\u201dColonel Carl squinted. \u201cWell then, you can bring them over.\u201dQi Bai Jia heaved a sigh of relief. Although he was skeptical of how Han Xiao had managed to infiltrate the base, he chose to believe that Han Xiao had his own ways.Fortunately, he had captives to prove to them that what he said was true.However, after the radio connection was cut off, Colonel Carl told his deputy, \u201cOrder the troops to move out. Our target will be the Dark Crow Valley.\u201dQi Bai Jia was stunned\u2014it was the complete opposite of what was previously promised.Colonel Carl was reluctant to explain his rationale. It would take Han Xiao a few hours to bring the so-called captives in, and if Han Xiao was to play tricks and delay further, the enemies from the Dark Crow Valley base might seize the opportunity to evacuate completely before his troops could reach the target. As the commanding officer, he would not simply alter his decision based on certain unverified intel.He was more inclined to trust Ye Fan\u2019s intel; it had witnesses, evidence, and originated from reliable sources.Colonel Carl believed that he would not risk any damage for moving out earlier even if Han Xiao was right. Han Xiao could still bring the captives to him. The only difference was that the base would be on high alert earlier, and that would cause danger to Han Xiao\u2019s team.But, he didn\u2019t care about the lives of a bunch of Stardragon agents. Even if they were killed, the Hesla top-level officers would not look into it. Someone from Hesla would naturally block the protests from Division 13.Furthermore, Han Xiao had already provided the information about the inner base. Colonel Carl did not give a hoot whether or not Han Xiao could prove his story. He could verify this information himself after he took down the base.\u201cMy men are still stationed near the base. Your rash attack will put them in great danger!\u201d Qi Bai Jia was clearly enraged.\u201cSuch a great opportunity may pa.s.s at any moment. We cannot risk a delay because of one or two agents. Since they are agents themselves, I am sure they can understand the bigger picture,\u201d Carl replied calmly.\u201cObjection!\u201dQi Bai Jia\u2019s face was filled with anger.\u201cIt\u2019s not your place to disagree.\u201d Carl pressed on an electric bell to summon a section of troopers; they pointed their rifles at Qi Bai Jia. \u201cSend our \u2018friends\u2019 from Stardragon to the vehicles. We will move out together later. I do not want them to communicate with anyone else as that may leak our plan, so remove all of their communication devices.\u201dCarl emphasized the word \u2018friends\u2019 to stress his point.Qi Bai Jia was so furious that his body started shaking vigorously.\u201cSigh. How did things come to this stage?\u201d Ye Fan was bereft of words. Han Xiao had suggested a conservative method, while Carl was more radical. Neither was wrong, but Carl was the commanding officer, and Han Xiao was only a subordinate. Furthermore, they were not from Hesla.Winna watched coldly from the side.\u2026.After the connection was cut off, Han Xiao\u2019s face blackened.He had a hunch; Carl was a radical commanding officer, so he would most likely attack in advance.This guy is eager for a quick success. Han Xiao was clearly irked. It seemed like he had to complete the mission by himself since time was running out.However, he only knew about the existence of inner base but not the enemy\u2019s evacuation route and time. He needed to infiltrate again to gather more information.This time, Han Xiao did not plan to accomplish it himself. To achieve his plan, infiltrating alone was not the optimal option.The best option for a partner was actually Lin Yao, a hacker that could be planted inside the base. Like a computer virus, he could cut the enemy\u2019s communication network at the critical junctures, rendering them blind and deaf.Therefore, he had to make two facial masks based on the two captives. There were molds and make-up tools in the truck storage. Thus, he could craft the masks in an hour or so.Han Xiao forced his mind to focus and used his remaining energy to drag the two captives toward their secret base. He reached it in the afternoon, and his teammates came out to welcome him.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Lin Yao quickly came forward to support the exhausted Han Xiao.Han Xiao shook his head and said, \u201cThere is not much time left. We need to make two facial masks based on the captives. Lin Yao and Lambert will use their ident.i.ty cards to infiltrate the inner base. I will explain the details later.\u201d\u201cBrother Xiao\u2026Brother Xiao, I have no experience in spying. Can you give the job to another person? \u201d Lin Yao\u2019s face turned pale due to the overwhelming fear.\u201cYou are our only hacker, so it has got to be you.\u201dLin Yao looked petrified.\u201cI will take the other slot.\u201d Li Ya Lin volunteered herself.Han Xiao peeked at her and shook his head without any hesitation.\u201cWhat are you trying imply? Are you looking down on me?\u201d Li Ya Lin was infuriated.\u201cThese things are too big, making them hard to conceal.\u201d Han Xiao pointed at her b.r.e.a.s.t.s.Li Ya Lin was speechless.Lin Yao anxiously grabbed onto Han Xiao\u2019s sleeve and said in a hopeful voice, \u201cBrother Xiao, are you going in with me then?\u201d\u201cNah. I won\u2019t. This mission is too dange\u2026 cough\u2026 too simple for me. It is not challenging enough for me!\u201dYou definitely said something fishy there! Lin Yao and Li Ya Lin were screaming in their hearts.\u201cI shall do it then,\u201d Zhang Wei said.Han Xiao shook his head again. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t. No one else can operate the armored suit. And, you are the team leader.\u201d\u201d Oh , so you still know that I\u2019m the team leader?\u201d Zhang Wei gave a bitter smile. Ever since the appearance of Han Xiao, he had become a mere figurehead.There was only one possible candidate left.\u201cIt has been decided that it will be you!\u201d Han Xiao pointed at Lambert.\u201c\u2026\u201d Lambert.\u201cOh my G.o.d. I am definitely going to die.\u201d Lin Yao was exasperated.Lambert slapped the back of Lin Yao\u2019s head with an expressionless look as he was unhappy with Lin Yao\u2019s att.i.tude at the decision; he made it seem so much worse than choosing Han Xiao.\u2026One of the team members drove the truck closer toward Dark Crow Valley so that they didn\u2019t need to walk so far, while the rest were busy putting on make-up to disguise the two unlucky souls. They parked the truck right outside the alert zone.After more than an hour, Lambert and Lin Yao\u2019s disguises were completed. They looked exactly like the two captives. After putting on micro-earphones, they held the access cards and entered the Dark Crow Valley base from the side gate.\u201cBrother Xiao, how concrete is this plan?\u201d Lin Yao asked Han Xiao softly.\u201cIf you dream of its success with sincerity, you will make it.\u201dLin Yao felt a clot of blood stuck in his throat as he was made speechless by that answer. He turned to Lambert for more a.s.surance.\u201cAre you not afraid?\u201d Lin Yao asked Lambert in a quiet voice.\u201cTo accomplish the mission, we must try even if there was only a slight possibility of success,\u201d Lambert said calmly.\u201cWell said. You seem to be very dedicated to the mission.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lambert.Soon, the two of them arrived at the gate. Lin Yao was so nervous that his jaw was trembling.\u201cWill we get exposed?\u201d\u201cThe more nervous you appear, the easier it will be for you to be exposed.\u201d Lambert patted Lin Yao\u2019s shoulder and rea.s.sured him.Lin Yao took out his access card after he had gathered his senses.The security guards checked the access cards, and shortly after, they opened the gate for them.They then walked to the storage room under Han Xiao\u2019s instruction. They found the access card reader and successfully opened the secret door using the two captives\u2019 access cards. A metal pathway appeared before them.The pathway was long; it took them ten minutes to reach the inner base.The defenses were much tighter in the inner base, and many computer screens were seen hung on the walls. The enemy personnel were busy moving supplies and data.Lambert and Lin Yao looked each other in the eye.Now, they were really deep inside the enemy\u2019s base!All of a sudden, a screeching alarm was heard in the base, and the lights turned red.Lin Yao was scared to death as he thought that they had been discovered. Lambert frowned slightly and held onto Lin Yao.\u201cCalm down. The alarm was not triggered by us,\u201d he said softly.The personnel in the base were whispering to one another.\u201cWhat is happening?\u201d\u201cIs the enemy invading us?\u201dJi Jie walked out calmly and updated everyone, \u201cBe quiet. Hesla\u2019s border troops are advancing toward the base. The military personnel in the outer base have already set up the necessary defenses. They will be able to hold our enemy back long enough for us to get ready to evacuate.Lin Yao\u2019s expression changed, and he whispered anxiously over the radio, \u201cYou guys must leave now!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It took Han Xiao so much effort to obtain the critical intelligence, but now this lot are going to leave us in the lurch!\u201dSuch a scenario had been predicted by Han Xiao, and therefore, he looked rather calm. The rest were puzzled when they saw Han Xiao being so composed. Through the communication set, he ordered Lin Yao and Lambert, \u201cYou guys remain undercover. Always keep your safety at the front of your mind. We are going to retreat soon.\u201d\u201cCopy that!\u201dThere was an air of uneasiness around Zhang Wei and Li Ya. The truck was parked not far away from the Dark Crow Valley base, and once the base entered the battle mode, more enemy troopers would be deployed. The tracks of the truck would definitely be discovered quickly.There was no time to waste.\u201cLi Ya Lin, you are in charge of driving the truck!\u201dLi Ya Lin was a pugilist, and she would not be able to launch attacks while they were driving anyway. Therefore, she did not disagree with Han Xiao\u2019s decision.Han Xiao and Zhang Wei stayed in the container, where they were able to carry out their strikes at the enemy.Li Ya Lin stepped hard on the accelerator, making no effort to cover their tracks. The engine of the truck blared, and the tires started to spray the mud and soil from the ground. The truck moved forward loudly.In a while, the sounds of approaching vehicles could be heard. The retreating party could feel the heavy beating of their hearts. Through the window, Han Xiao could see a large group of armored jeeps chasing behind their truck. The headlights of these jeeps could be seen flas.h.i.+ng around the truck. There were more than ten jeeps around, and each had a heavy machine gun attached.\u201cWe have been discovered.\u201d Zhang Wei\u2019s heart sank.Han Xiao was not affected by the heavy rocking of the moving truck. He started preparing the weapons to be used for the impending battle.\u201cDrive fast, Ya Lin!\u201d Zhang Wei yelled.\u201cI know!\u201d Li Ya Lin replied, biting her lips. She was trying to change gear to speed up even more. The full power of the truck\u2019s engine was unleashed, and it growled like an enraged beast. The anti-slip tires left deep marks in the moist ground. The uneven, hilly terrain and winding paths caused the truck\u2019s body to spring away from its tires as a result of the shock absorbance effect created by the vehicle\u2019s suspension. Even with the suspension working well, the truck rocked violently.Han Xiao peeked out of the window in the container and saw the enemy\u2019s jeeps closing in.\u201cCan\u2019t you go faster?\u201d Zhang Wei shouted.\u201cThis is a truck, not a sports car!\u201d Li Ya Lin was evidently irritated by Zhang Wei\u2019s comments.\u201cThe four b.u.t.tons beside the gear lever can be used to activate the nitro boost,\u201d Han Xiao said.\u201cYou added nitro boost to the truck\u203d\u201d Li Ya Lin was shocked yet excited to try it out.\u201cDo not activate the boost now. We are still travelling through dense vegetation, and you may destroy the truck with it. Use this to pick up more speed once we reach the plains!\u201dDa da da da\u2026The enemy troopers from the jeeps started firing their machine guns. Thick smoke emerged from the guns\u2019 barrels. Countless enemy bullets were sprayed at them. However, the shots fired from further away were largely inaccurate. The firing encompa.s.sed a huge radius, and trees along the way were getting destroyed. Some bullets also managed to sc.r.a.pe the surface of the container, and sparks were created from friction.Li Ya Lin glanced at the rear mirror, and the next moment, the rear mirror was destroyed by a bullet. She cursed in silence. The heavy truck was difficult to control; it rocked violently as she tried to evade the oncoming trees that were obstructing the path. She could feel the pain in her b.u.t.t due to all the incessant vibrations of the vehicle. The contents of the truck were flying all around, and Han Xiao had to use locks to fasten the weapons and machinery in place.The two prisoners were sitting at the corner of the container, trembling profusely.The Sun was setting, and it looked as if the skies had been stained red with blood.Dozens of armored jeeps were engaged in the intense pursuit of the fleeing truck. The enemy troopers were fast approaching, and bullets were fired everywhere; gunshots could be heard all over the forest. The blares of the engines sounded like the roars of a wild dragon. The Wanderers who were at Crow Forest Town could hear the sounds of battle and started to search for the source of the faint sounds.Closer and closer\u2026 closer and closer!Suddenly, a truck emerged from the forest and entered Crow Forest Town like an uncontrollable rhinoceros. It crashed into a building, which instantly crumbled under the huge impact. The shape of the crash barrier at the head of the truck became warped.The truck sped past the streets.The Wanderers on the streets were shocked and quickly searched for shelters to hide. Only after confirming that the truck had driven past did they come out of hiding. Many of them were confused and astonished. Before they could even calm down, the armored jeeps entered the town, driving recklessly. Many buildings were destroyed, and it was a complete mess.It was raining bullets, and many Wanderers were shot by stray bullets. Screams of pain could be heard all around, and the ground was drenched with blood.The final rays of light from the sun disappeared, and night fell. The truck was finally at the edge of the forest, and the obstacle-free plains appeared before it. The headlights from the armored jeeps illuminated the darkness like a Light Dragon.There was no obstacle blocking the way on the plains, so it was easier for the armored jeeps to close the gap.Nearer and near they came. Six hundred, five hundred, four hundred meters!\u201cZhang Wei, change into your armor!\u201dZhang Wei felt a surge of adrenaline. Even before the command, he had prepared for the moment of his \u2018suit up\u2019. Upon activating the armor, he noticed an immediate difference. The internal skeletal system provided power for all movements, and therefore, there was no need for his own strength to be used. His vision was also enhanced with the a.n.a.lysis interface. Chains of battle data flashed on the display. There was even an enhanced scope that offered greater shot accuracy.Zhang Wei widened his eyes in disbelief.\u201cIt is so powerful!\u201dHan Xiao loaded the high-explosive rounds into his sniper rifle and replied confidently, \u201cThis is only a simple modification.\u201dIt was right to have spent the $36,000 on the suit.Ding ding dang dang!The clanging of the bullets that were cras.h.i.+ng against armor became denser!\u201cRetaliate now!\u201d Han Xiao growled, and following that, Zhang Wei kicked open the door of the container. He had a clear vision of what was in front of him. The head armor covered the fury in his eyes. He lifted the triple barrel machine gun and started firing.\u201cTu tu tu tu\u2013\u2013\u201dThe high frequency gunshots created thunderous blasts. Thick ember emerged from the wild firing formed around the gun\u2019s barrel. Sh.e.l.ls were spat out of the gun and fell to the ground. The large, long bullets coupled with traces of ember were directed at the armored jeeps.Boom! The bulletproof windows of two jeeps were shattered, and the pa.s.sengers of the jeep were crushed.Zhang Wei held two chains of bullets tightly. The chains extended all the way behind his back and led to a box. The box contained the ammunition that Han Xiao prepared; Zhang Wei had sufficient ammunition to spray to his heart\u2019s content.The dozens of armored jeeps dispersed from their formation to evade the shots from Zhang Xiao. The enemy troopers fired back using the machine guns mounted on the jeeps.Zhang Wei was standing right at the opening of the container wearing his armor. The exterior of the suit was made up of the Platinum Alloy. Zhang Wei mounted the hexagonal s.h.i.+eld before his body to s.h.i.+eld himself from the bullets. Most of the bullets were blocked by the thick armor.Han Xiao raised the sniper rifle and started firing the high-explosive rounds. The rounds set the jeeps aflame. The enemy drivers started panicking, and once the flames reached the jeeps\u2019 engines, they were forced to stop.However, more jeeps were approaching, and bullet holes could be seen on the external armor of the truck.The distance was sufficient!Han Xiao put aside his sniper rifle and grabbed the mechanical dragonfly explosives from the box. He threw them forward as if they were free of charge. The mechanical dragonflies glided close to the ground, and they were detonated once they reached the jeeps.Boom!The armored jeeps were overturned by the explosions, and the momentum from the blast resulted in the jeeps tumbling in midair before landing. Once the flames reached the fuel tanks of the jeeps, it resulted in a second explosion that caused more deaths.The never-ending death toll started flas.h.i.+ng on the tablet\u2019s interface.Every delayed explosion caused by the mechanical dragonfly could kill four to eight enemy troopers in the jeep. In addition to the kills, EXP was also awarded for the destruction of the vehicle. Therefore, every jeep destroyed generated 5,000 to 7,000 EXP for Han Xiao. The rewards motivated Han Xiao greatly, and he strove to cause greater damage with the explosives.[Direct Conflict completed. You gained 35,000 EXP!]\u201cAh!\u201dHysterical screams were heard. Han Xiao turned back his head only to realize that the two enemy troopers who were held captive had been killed by the flying bullets. Instantly, Han Xiao\u2019s heart sank.\u201cThe prisoners are dead!\u201dThe firepower coming from the jeep started to lessen; the enemy troopers were afraid of the attacking abilities of the truckA single truck had managed to destroy twenty armored jeeps. It was definitely a scary fact for the enemies.\u201cI can see the military forces of Hesla!\u201d Li Ya Lin screamed in excitement.Han Xiao looked ahead and saw the army of vehicles operated by the Hesla military.\u2026\u201cCommander, there seem to be skirmishes ahead of us!\u2019Carl looked at the video feed on the operation vehicle and was thoroughly shocked.More than twenty armored jeeps were chasing after the bullet-hole-riddled heavy-duty truck. He then saw the trail of overturned jeeps that had been set ablaze.Carl was suspicious of the situation.These agents from Division 13 really had a substantial and fierce firepower.There were not many operation teams that had such strong fighting abilities that could rival with those of modern militaries. A smaller team enabled greater flexibility in operations. Usually, such operation teams were considered the best of their kind. He suppressed his initial shock. Following that, he squinted and started looking back and forth.Winna and Ye Fan were also astonished by the sight before their eyes.A single truck had managed to survive the attack of an army of armored jeeps. Also, it had managed to wipe out half of the total enemy count.\u201cIt\u2019s surprising that the truck can still move after withstanding a thousand shots!\u201dEven though the truck was almost wrecked, it could still travel freely like a wild dog on steroids. The truck had undergone some sort of modification. A grenade exploded on the armor of the truck, yet the explosion only caused minor change, barely denting the armor. In the same situation, a normal vehicle would have been blasted into multiple pieces.What sort of metal was it made of\u203dToo strong!Even the agents for Division 13 were confused.Since when did Zhang Wei\u2019s team possess such powerful fighting capabilities?Could a mechanic really elevate the firepower of a team so much?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was shocked but still carried out the order. The area of attack was locked in.The team of vehicles equipped with missile launchers moved forward, and in an instant, the rockets were launched.The truck fell inside the radius of the missile strike!The agents from Division 13 were sharp-eyed and figured out what Carl was trying to do. They were enraged and astonished.The a.s.sistant officer explained, \u201cd.a.m.n it, we miscalculated the radius of the attack.\u201dSuch words were only sufficient to fool little kids. The agents from Division 13 were not convinced, and the enraged Qi Bai Jia shouted, \u201cCarl, what do you think you are doing\u203d\u201dCarl did not reply. His face was expressionless, and his eyes were cold as ice.Too bad! You guys do not belong to Hesla.Li Ya Lin could clearly see the flaming exhaust of the rockets, which also signified the impending destruction their team was going to face. She screamed, \u201cThey want to send us up to heaven too!\u201d\u201cHesla\u2019s commanders did it on purpose!\u201d Zhang Wei was furious.Even though tension was bound to occur during joint operations involving different countries, n.o.body expected the commanding officer from Hesla to make such a brutal move. Also, he could s.h.i.+rk off the responsibility by conveniently claiming that it was an accident.Only radicals would result to such despicable measures\u2014the killing of their allies and the neglecting of consequences!The Germinal Organization was a common enemy of the Six Nations. All the parties agreed on counter-terrorism efforts. However, the different parties involved were not allies, and some even had conflicts with one another. The higher-ups of the nations were pretentious and hypocritical. They were also willing to sacrifice those beneath them to attain their goals.Han Xiao focused and shouted, \u201cNitro boost!\u201dLi Ya Lin immediately pressed the b.u.t.ton. Blue flames emerged from the exhaust of the truck. The acceleration of the truck was exponentially increased, charging forward like a wild rhinoceros. Li Ya Lin was pressed hard onto her seat by the surging momentum.The rockets began to descend quickly. Three hundred, two hundred, one hundred, fifty meters.Boom!Finally, the blast arrived and created a wave of heat that resulted in a mushroom cloud of dust. The flaming smoke rose on the plains. At that instant, everyone lost their senses. The sound of the blast exceeded the audible range of the human ear. It was as if the whole world had fallen silent. All that was left was a rising glow, which illuminated the night sky.Everything within the radius of the strike, regardless of vehicles or humans, had been demolished.After three seconds, an incessant ringing became audible.Rage and fury were written on the faces of the agents from Division 13.Grief could be observed from the killer eyes of Di Su Su; a green flame was burning silently in her heart.Whoos.h.!.+The wind started howling.The heavy-duty truck emerged out of the thick dark smoke. Only a small section of the container had been blown apart. Some of the machinery and accessories had been reduced to sc.r.a.p metal.\u201cThey are still alive!\u201dThe agents from Division 13 were surprised. Li Ya Lin was not yet out of her state of shock. It had really just been a matter of a few meters. They were really lucky to have escaped the radius of the strike in time. If not for the nitro boost, all of them would have vanished into thin air.Han Xiao coughed out the blood from his throat. He\u2019d suffered from injuries due to the shockwave of the blast. Almost 200 HP had been lost due to the blast. The second blast had sent him cras.h.i.+ng into the hard wall of the container, costing him another 50 HP. Han Xiao was still feeling giddy from the aftershock of the blast.After the nitro boost, the engine was overheating, but it still managed move forward till it reached the Hesla soldiers.After seeing countless bullet holes on the container, the soldiers of Hesla could feel the chills up their spines.What a tough battle they\u2019d had.\u201cWhat a pity. They managed to survive.\u201d Carl frowned in disappointment.After Han Xiao alighted from the truck, the agents from Division 13 started to crowd before him. Qi Bai Jia, who broke out into cold sweat, heaved a sigh of relief upon seeing that Han Xiao was alive and well.Carl walked toward the agents.Instantly, the agents from Division 13 glowered furiously at him. Zhang Wei, clad in his armor, gritted his teeth and moved toward Carl. The soldiers at the side immediately raised their weapon and pointed at the agents. The a.s.sistant officer bellowed, \u201cWhat do you want? Back off!\u201d\u201cI want an explanation!\u201d Zhang Wei yelled.Explanation? How childish.Carl ignored Zhang Wei and glanced at Han Xiao. He asked flippantly, \u201cWhere are the captured enemies?\u201d\u201c\u2026Dead.\u201dCarl\u2019s order to strike ahead of the stipulated time had caused immense danger for them. The two captured enemies had also been killed. More importantly, Carl had tried to kill them. It was obvious that he had done these things on purpose.Han Xiao shut his eyes to conceal the ice-cold chill in them.\u201cNo more evidence, I suppose?\u201d Carl frowned with a look of discontent. His poor att.i.tude angered the agents from Division 13 even more. However, they were rational enough to keep their cool as they were, ultimately, in a foreign land surrounded by soldiers from Hesla.Qi Bai Jia could not contain his anger and lashed out, \u201cPrepare to be questioned by Division 13!\u201dCarl couldn\u2019t care less. Division 13 had no jurisdiction over him. Moreover, what happened just was an \u2018accident\u2019; there was no evidence to justify that he had done it on purpose. At most, he would be reprimanded by the foreign diplomats. He would not have to face any real punishment.If he managed to destroy the Dark Crow Valley base, it would truly be a great achievement. With the help of his backers, he was highly likely to be promoted to the leading figure for the radicals in the government. No matter how Division 13 complained about him, the higher-ups in Hesla would be there to fend off these complaints.Carl thought to himself. After which he pointed at Han Xiao and said, \u201cTake him to the medic. Let them check his injuries.\u201dHan Xiao had no expression on his face. He followed the medic to the logistics vehicle. All his injuries were due to the shock on his soft body. With his endurance, he would recover quickly with a sufficient amount of rest. Therefore, he dismissed the medic.The logistics vehicle started its engine. Hesla\u2019s troops continued their advance.Han Xiao shook his head, closed his eyes, and then proceeded to lie on his bed.He had not slept since yesterday. Now was the right time for him to catch up on his sleep.\u2026The sounds of gunshots could be heard. Han Xiao was a light sleeper, and he opened his eyes. He alighted from the vehicle and realized it was midnight, around 3 to 4 am.At this point of time, Hesla\u2019s troops had arrived at the border of the high-alert sectors of the Dark Crow Valley base. The six high-alert sectors comprised not only of sentry guards and patrolling troopers, there were also large defense mechanisms put in place like ramparts and guardhouses that were fortified with enemy troops. In the event of war, Hesla\u2019s army would have to go past the six high-alert sectors before they closed in on the actual base itself.Han Xiao, who was now with the logistics division, was far from the battlefront.Han Xiao asked the two soldiers guarding by his side, \u201cWhat\u2019s the situation of the battlefront?\u201dOne of the soldiers replied, \u201cEverything is proceeding smoothly. Our troops have successfully reached the fourth sector.\u201dHan Xiao nodded, and just when he was about to proceed out, the two soldiers blocked his path.\u201cThe Colonel wants you to rest and recover from your injuries here.\u201dUpon hearing that, Han Xiao realized that he had been intentionally imprisoned here by the Colonel. Han Xiao frowned and asked, \u201cWhere are my friends?\u201d\u201cYour officer also tasked us to look after you and ensure that you have sufficient rest.\u201dHan Xiao understood the intentions of Qi Bai Jia. He did not want Han Xiao to risk his life anymore. Ultimately, Han Xiao had almost been killed by the flaming missiles. Qi Bai Jia wanted to keep Han Xiao away from the battlefront.Such a move is better for my plan, Han Xiao thought.Han Xiao turned his head and saw the truck being towed away. The escape mission had almost destroyed the entire truck. Without a full repair, the truck would surely be not usable.Han Xiao\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up before he proceeded toward the heavy-duty truck.The two soldiers guarding him allowed him to do so. Han Xiao was free to go anywhere as long as he stayed away from the battlefront in the logistics zone.He entered the container and discovered that all the important equipment was still around. Only the bodies of the two captured soldiers had been disposed of. Han Xiao took out the communication set from the box and adjusted it to Lin Yao\u2019s frequency.\u201cLin Yao, are you still alive?\u201d\u201cOf course, I am, but don\u2019t jinx it! \u201d Lin Yao\u2019s unfriendly voice blared out from the earpiece.\u201cWhat\u2019s the situation now?\u201d\u201cWe are preparing for the retreat. Apparently, according to the higher-ups in the base, the troops stationed around the base were all deployed to fight Hesla\u2019s army. I have yet to discover their path of retreat. Seems like I\u2019ll have to follow the order to locate the exact route. Oh, I also managed to find out the false information that Ye Fan collected. The defense mechanism and deployment between the third and sixth sectors were true. However, the first and second sectors were different. If Hesla\u2019s troops attack according to the information Ye Fan provided, they are bound to suffer heavy losses.\u201d\u201cHave you told them yet?\u201d\u201cNope, you are the first guy that contacted me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good. Don\u2019t tell that to Hesla\u2019s people.\u201dLin Yao was confused and asked, \u201cWhy so?\u201dHan Xiao told him the series of events that had happened previously. Upon hearing the incident of the misfire of the missiles, Lin Yao\u2019s blood started boiling with rage. \u201cThat is just too much!\u201dCarl revealed his intention to wipe out his allies, so it was no longer logical for Division 13 to continue a.s.sisting him in the operation and minimize his losses.The intelligence that Han Xiao provided was all aimed at eliminating Pan Kuang and Ji Jie, who were high-value members of the Germinal Organization. Only the successful elimination of them would ensure the mission\u2019s success. Carl treated them like they were merely tools. Now it was time for Han Xiao to reciprocate. They wanted his intelligence reports, and he wanted their troops. Both parties were merely using each other to their advantage.As long as Hesla\u2019s army accomplished the mission using his intelligence, he could not have cared less about the number of troops they lost.What Han Xiao had not expected was Carl\u2019s intention to kill them.\u201cIt is time for a change of plan.\u201dHan Xiao\u2019s eyes sparkled brightly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Likewise, morning was also the best time to fight a battle.The previous night, the Hesla troops had managed to clear the fourth high-alert sector. Carl had ordered his troops to rest for an hour before continuing their advancement at first light. They wanted to reach the base in one final attack.As the sun rose, the Hesla troops were fighting the enemies at the third high-alert sector.Boom, boom, boom!The endless blasts were thunderous, and the enshrouded the battleground in smoke. The entire forest was wrecked by the hail of bullets and artillery strikes, the used sh.e.l.ls of which were littered everywhere.The soldiers from Hesla, coupled with the armored vehicles, managed to take down the defense mechanisms in place. One after another, fortresses, sentry-posts, and trenches were destroyed. The information Ye Fan had obtained was of great use. The enemy\u2019s defense mechanisms were practically useless against the attacks. The troops managed to secure their objectives with minimal losses. The soldiers were elated because their victories had never been so comfortable before.\u201cContinue to advance. Let\u2019s take down the two remaining high alert sectors in one shot!\u201dCarl was overwhelmed with excitement.Once the confident troops entered the second high-alert sector, the favorable situation started to turn around.Not long after stepping foot into the second high-alert sector, the Hesla troops faced their first enemy ambush. Two armored vehicles and dozens of soldiers were wiped out by well-hidden mines. And that was, in fact, just an appetizer. The Hesla soldiers were soon completely devastated. The death toll was rising steadily, and there were traps and ambushes everywhere.Ye Fan\u2019s intelligence was practically useless at this stage. Following the false information provided led to even greater losses. The various platoons were at a complete loss.The intelligence about the first four high-alert selectors had allowed Hesla\u2019s military to successfully penetrate deep and eventually enter the ambush zone that Ji Jie had marked out.The casualties were increasing exponentially.Carl experienced a mix of shock and fury.The expression on Winna\u2019s face changed. Indeed, the information they had obtained was only bait; Han Xiao\u2019s predictions were right. They were indeed responsible for the huge losses.Ye Fan shook his head and said, \u201cThe enemies are too cunning and ruthless. They were willing to sacrifice the lives of their own comrades to lure us in. It was almost impossible to see through their plot. Perhaps, that\u2019s the advantage of being on the defensive side. The Germinal Organization is not afraid to go all out. However, such a measure is not feasible for our side. Carl\u2019s moves were too radical; he should have listened to Han Xiao and been less brash with his deployments.\u201dHe looked at his remorseful teammates and sighed.At this point, Carl saw his soldiers falling one after another. He had an uncomfortable expression. What was supposed to be a smooth-sailing situation had flipped around. The \u2018easy-win\u2019 had reversed, becoming a complete disaster. Even if they managed to prevail in the battle, it was going to be a costly victory.The Hesla troops, who were facing head-on defeats, were suffering heavy losses, and their advancement proceeded at a snail\u2019s pace.Suddenly, a grim-looking man who held a long machete in his hand emerged from the enemy side. He was surrounded by cold and transparent waves of energy that bore similarity to flames. The air beside him distorted as he dashed toward Hesla\u2019s army. The soldiers immediately started firing their rifles, but the man span as he ran and speedily slashed his machete. The approaching bullets were disintegrated by the slashes and fell to the ground.\u201cPugilist!\u201dWhile the soldiers were still in shock, the man barged into the crowd. Within seconds, the combo of powerful slashes from the s.h.i.+ny machete diced numerous Hesla soldiers into many bits. Blood sprayed everywhere, and broken limbs, heads, and torsos could be seen all over the ground.The man stood with conviction amid the sea of red.\u201cPan Kuang!\u201dThe agents were all astonished.Pan Kuang was the man in charge of the Dark Crow Valley base and the executive officer of the Germinal Organization. In addition, he had managed to kill many powerful individuals and had a glorious battle record on the Dark Net.Based on his battle record on the Dark Net, Pan Kuang was highly adept with his machete. His fighting style originated from that of Rui Lan, and he was becoming known as the \u2018Soul of the Blade\u2019.The light reflected by his s.h.i.+ny blade was usually the last thing his slain enemies saw.The armored vehicle adjusted its position. Larger bullets were fired out from the re-adjusted barrel at Pan Kuang. Pan Kuang started leaping with unbelievably fast movements and dodged the incoming shots by ducking behind the trees. It was impossible for ordinary solider to accurately trace the position of Pan Kuang. More often than not, in the blink of an eye, Pan Kuang would disappear without any trace, and the fired shots would all miss.Pan Kuang was able to move around the battleground with ease and without any substantial obstruction.Like a life-claiming reaper, Pan Kuang slew one soldier after another. He even managed to slashed open a couple of heavily armored trucks and kill the soldiers inside the vehicles.As long as there were shelters that offered protection against the bullets, a Superhuman could unleash his extensive power and cause immense damage. The energy he possessed protected his body, and ordinary gunpowder and bullets were unable to cause any significant harm.A D-cla.s.s Superhuman could battle a platoon on their own and escape with ease after the fight.A C-cla.s.s Superhuman had colossal strength and an iron body that could withstand the attacks of guns and canons. They could cause substantial damage on all terrains and could tear down a building with their bare hands easily. A C-cla.s.s Superhuman was of the lowest-level in the galaxy. It also had the t.i.tle of \u2018Basic Cosmic Warrior\u2019. Different planets in the galaxy had different gravitational fields and atmospheric conditions. A C-cla.s.s Superhuman would be able to set foot on most planets. It was normal for certain species that lived in harsher galactic conditions to possess C-cla.s.s Superhuman bodies from birth.However, there were very few C-cla.s.s Superhumans on Aquamarine. The Superhumans on this planet were low-ranked ones.Pan Kuang\u2019s Superhuman cla.s.s was E+, one level away from becoming D-cla.s.s. He was able to easily defeat groups of Hesla soldiers in the complicated forested terrain. A Superhuman possessed a powerful solo-fighting capability, and they would often swipe in to kill the highest-ranking commander of the troops or infiltrate the enemy to sabotage operations.Soldiers in the way were being killed by the advancing Pan Kuang. It was obvious that Pan Kuang was travelling in the direction of Carl!Carl had made it onto the radar of Pan Kuang\u2019s killer instincts, which made Carl feel very uneasy. He had no sense of security even when he was protected tightly by his troops, so he immediately commanded, \u201cLaunch the thermo-tracing rockets!\u201dAn armored vehicle equipped with missile launchers arrived, and multiple rockets that were locked onto Pan Kuang were fired.Pan Kuang was circling the forest speedily, and the rockets crashed into the trees. The last rocket managed to go through the gaps between the tree trunks and headed for Pan Kuang.With a tight frown, Pan Kuang halted in his steps. He scooped up some soil and held the machete with both of his hands. There was an invisible wave of energy surrounding the blade. He slashed the machete at the rocket.The quick slash managed to hit the side of the rocket at the right time. The force from the strike changed the course of the rocket, and its path was altered. The rocket crashed into a large tree that was twenty meters away and burst into flames. Pan Kuang was slightly disorientated by the shockwave of the explosion. If Han Xiao were there, he would have seen that the damage was more than twenty health points.After realizing that even the rockets were useless against Pan Kuang, Carl looked at his agents. Carl\u2019s intention of deploying the agents to protect himself was clear.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Winna yelled, and Hesla\u2019s agents moved forward together with her.The agents from Division 13 were observing from one side. The joint operation no longer made sense after what Carl had done; therefore, they were not going to help.After finding out that the agents from Hesla had entered the battle, Pan Kuang immediately sheathed his machete and retreated. He did not want to be held up by the agents.Gunshots echoed through the forest as bullets were fired out of the agents\u2019 guns.The s.h.i.+ny blade slashed past. Light was reflected off the surface of the blade. A bullet fired at Pan Kuang was cut in half. Although Pan Kuang operated at a lower speed than the flying bullet, he had managed to antic.i.p.ate the path of the bullet and position his machete at the perfect spot. His reflexes were rapid.Pan Kuang remained expressionless as he turned away and disappeared into the forest.In this attack, Pan Kuang had managed to kill hundreds of enemy soldiers and destroy a couple of armored vehicles. The morale of Hesla\u2019s soldiers was at its lowest. They had suffered heavy casualties, and the initial fatigue acc.u.mulated from the attacks on the previous four sectors was beginning to take its toll. The situation forced Carl to slow down the attack even though he was unwilling to do so.Ji Jie was observing the situation at the frontline from his monitor. The second high-alert sector was down, and Hesla\u2019s troops were moving toward the final sector. Even if Hesla\u2019s army suffered great losses, they still had an upper hand over the armed security guards of the base.However, everything was under control.After Pan Kuang returned, Ji Jie locked the doors leading to the base. Even if the enemy managed to take down the external base, they would be unable to locate the internal base. Furthermore, Ji Jie was also preparing to give a \u2018big gift\u2019 to the Hesla soldiers outside the internal base.\u201ca.s.sistant Director, when are we going to retreat?\u201d\u201cNow,\u201d Ji Jie said.The staff of the inner base gathered at the doorstep of the third secret pa.s.sageway. Lin Yao and Lambert were furthest away from the rest. When n.o.body was looking, they would inform each other of critical intelligence. Strangers would think that they were just making casual conversation.\u2026Boom!The final fortress was blasted into pieces by the cannon of a mini-tank. The remaining armed guards only had one choice\u2014retreat into the base.All the defense lines crumbled, and Carl finally loosened up from the tension.The final two sectors had cost seventy percent more losses than expected. Carl\u2019s superiors would definitely be less impressed when they saw the battle report.\u201cThe enemies are left with the final base, and they have nowhere to retreat to. Are we going to let the troops rest for a while?\u201d the a.s.sistant officer asked.Carl was sat in deep thought, and he suddenly remembered Han Xiao\u2019s intelligence report. It mentioned that there was an inner base and also a secret escape pa.s.sageway. Instantly, he felt that it was an opportunity for him to improve his battle record. He did not want to waste a single moment so as to reduce the enemies\u2019 chance of escape. Therefore, he issued an order with conviction.\u201cStart the attack immediately. Remember to search thoroughly in the facility, especially the storerooms. There must be some hidden door somewhere that can lead us to the enemy\u2019s inner base.\u201dThe order was confirmed, and the soldiers who had still not yet recovered from the shock of the previous battle regained their spirits and entered the base to wipe out the remaining enemies. The base was very small, and the fighting took place in the narrow alleys. Endless gunshots could be heard throughout the drawn-out battle.\u201cWe found the storeroom, but no hidden doors can be seen. There are only solid concrete walls. We also tested our explosives on the walls.\u201d\u201cMaybe there is something wrong with the intelligence report?\u201d Carl frowned hard. He summoned his a.s.sistant and said, \u201cBring the agents from Division 13 here. Also, get me Han Xiao. I want to ask them about the intelligence report they submitted.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Compared to those battles, the current one, a low-level battle fought on the ground, gave Han Xiao a greater adrenaline rush. The sound of gunshots and scent of gunpowder gave a better display of the brutality and the atmosphere of war compared to those battles Han Xiao had previously witnessed, which had only involved silent energy beams and plasma canons.Han Xiao sat in the container of the truck, while the two sentry guards were still guarding the vehicle tightly. They were highly suspicious that Han Xiao was intending to escape.Lin Yao\u2019s voice could be heard from Han Xiao\u2019s earpiece.\u201cBrother Xiao, we are going to retreat together with the core team of the enemy. I have planted the virus in their system, so we can now jam their communications any time.\u201d\u201cGood job.\u201d\u201cOh, Uncle Lambert made a new discovery. The internal structure of the base is very strong, and it is probably explosion-proof.\u201dHan Xiao frowned, and after piecing together the bits of information, he suddenly realized that the external base was disguised as the bait, or more accurately, a graveyard. There were probably heaps of explosives hidden, and once the invaders stepped into it, the explosives would be triggered to kill all of them. Also, the explosions would be strong enough to demolish the external base and bury everything in it, thereby making the internal base more discrete.\u201d\u201cWhat an ingenious plan.\u201d Han Xiao sighed. Even if he were to report the situation now, it would be too late. Also, Han Xiao did not have any intention of doing so.He had finally reached the final stage of his plan.Han Xiao rose up and began to pack his belongings. He transferred all the accessories and important mechanical components from the container into his bag. The bag was completely filled. Han Xiao then said to the two sentry guards, \u201cCould you guys help me carry some of these items? They are pretty heavy.\u201dThe two troops went up the truck unknowingly to help Han Xiao carry his bag.The moment they bent their bodies, Han Xiao took action. With two solid punches to the necks of the soldiers, both of them collapsed to the ground without making a sound.Han Xiao closed the door of the container, and he secretly changed into the trooper\u2019s attire and removed the mask he was wearing. After which, he activated the mask and used it to change his appearance. He carried the bag and walked out confidently. He was able to blend into the logistics team without anyone noticing.\u2026Carl\u2019s a.s.sistant soon rushed back.\u201cEveryone from Division 13, except for Han Xiao, was present,\u201d he said.Carl was shocked. \u201cHe disappeared\u203d\u201d\u201cThe two sentry guards that were supposed to look after him were found unconscious. I asked the logistics team, and n.o.body saw Han Xiao around.\u201dCarl wanted to continue the conversation, but there a thunderous boom in the air, which made him jump up on reflex. He immediately started scouting for the source of the sound.The mountain was moving, and it was as if an earthquake had struck. Everyone was terrified!The Dark Crow Valley base had detonated!The entire base crumbled, and the main entrance was completed sealed by the falling rocks. Hundreds of elite soldiers were buried!The turn of events obviously infuriated Carl.The troops had fallen into the enemy\u2019s trap just as victory was in sight. Countless lives were claimed, and the base was also destroyed. This greatly depreciated the value of the victory.Carl knew that, as the commander of the forces, he would face a lot of backlash.Carl had a gloomy look, and he thought of Han Xiao\u2019s advice. If he had heeded the advice, he could have prevented the heavy losses. But even if he had the opportunity to choose again, Carl felt that he would still make the same choice. He was completely frustrated and vented that frustration on the wall of the commander\u2019s vehicle.The army had suffered heavy losses, and Carl could feel the pain in his heart. He then gave several orders to raise the morale of the dejected troops.After the agents from Division 13 arrived, Carl said with a gloomy face, \u201cYour teammate disappeared. What is going on exactly?\u201d\u201cHan Xiao vanished again\u203d\u201d One could clearly see the change in expression on the agents\u2019 faces.Why the word \u2018again\u2019?Qi Bai Jia felt a blank in his mind.G.o.ddammit, Han Xiao always did such things.Zhang Wei and Li Ya Lin were very calm. It was as if they had gotten used to it.It was really the norm for Han Xiao to carry out tasks at his own will without seeking any approval. One just had to get used to it. He was probably on his way to create some new trouble.\u201cIf Han Xiao did not obtain the critical intelligence, you would have foolishly thought that you have successfully destroyed the base, when in actual fact, you have only managed to destroy the outer region. You would not even be aware that the enemies have escaped!\u201dCarl pondered, and indeed, he would have thought that his operation was a complete success, and if the Dark Crow Valley base managed to reinstate itself in the future, he would the first to be held responsible.\u201cWhat other information can you guys offer?\u201d Carl asked anxiously.Zhang Wei, who was trying hard to suppress his detest for Carl, bellowed, \u201cTwo of our companions retreated together with the enemy. Once they confirm the enemy\u2019s path of retreat, they will send it to us.\u201dCarl\u2019s eyes lit up and said immediately, \u201cInform me as soon as you receive any news.\u201dHe had not expected that Han Xiao would accomplish so much in his operation. His troops had suffered way too many losses in the previous battle, so he needed to atone for his mistakes by successfully eliminating the core of the enemy\u2019s retreating force.\u2026There was a region away from everyone\u2019s attention at the outskirts ten kilometers away from the Dark Crow Valley base. Pan Kuang, Ji Jie, and over two hundred core members were exiting the secret pa.s.sageway via their vehicles. The vehicles carried huge amounts of logistical items and also contained precious information about the base.\u201cI suppose Hesla think that they have won the battle?\u201d Ji Jie let out uncontrollable laughter.Pan Kuang looked and him and said, \u201cDon\u2019t let your guard down.\u201dJi Jie nodded and ordered the teams to advance faster.They needed to travel for another two hours to reach a secret hangar that housed several Black Harrier helicopters and a small cargo-plane.Lin Yao and Lambert received Zhang Wei\u2019s orders from their earpieces. They looked at each other and knew it was time for them to strike.Lin Yao took out a tablet and activated the dormant virus planted in the enemy communication network.Sheela!Everyone was shocked by the piercing shrieks in their earpieces. They immediately removed them from their ears.Ji Jie was disgruntled. Just as he was about the order the vehicle-fleet to stop and inspect on the communication set, he heard a series of engine-hums approaching from all directions.\u201cp.r.o.ne!\u201d Pan Kuang expression immediately changed. He pushed Ji Jie, who had yet to react, to the ground. After Pan Kuang completed these actions, there was a wave of gunshots.Bullets rained on the fleet from all directions. The exploding grenades overturned the vehicles of the fleet. Flames and glaring light could be seen.Lambert dragged Lin Yao off the vehicle. They rolled toward the vegetation at the side to avoid the direct attack.Ji Jie could not believe that his trap had been discovered by the invaders. Who had leaked the information?\u201cRun!\u201dThere was no time for any disappointment. Ji Jie was dragged toward the forest swiftly by Pan Kuang.\u2026Carl, who was commanding his troops from the forest, felt a great sense of excitement. His troops had encircled the core of the retreating enemy, and he knew it was a golden opportunity for him to turn things around.A distance away, Han Xiao, who had changed his appearance, was driving the jeep alone. He held a thermo-sensor in his hand and was searching the battle zone. He quickly discovered his targets: Pan Kuang and Ji Jie, who had managed to escape the heavy encirclements. Troops who managed to catch up with Pan Kuang were mercilessly destroyed by his powerful fighting abilities.Han Xiao was tailing both of them from a hundred meters away with the help of with his thermo-sensor.\u201cA jeep is approaching.\u201d Pan Kuang looked behind. He could barely see the jeep that was following them in the dense forest, and the faint sound of the jeep\u2019s engine could be heard.Pan Kuang wanted to destroy the jeep. However, every time his distance from the jeep shortened, Han Xiao would change course and increase the distance between them again. The jeep was just like an irritant.Pan Kuang thought Han Xiao was operating a reconnaissance jeep that reported their location back to the enemy. Also, they expected the entire army to be following them, and therefore, they were afraid to stop moving. Pan Kuang, who was dragging Ji Jie in his escape, could feel the quick depletion of his energy.\u201cWe just need to reach the hangar. The helicopter will help us with the escape.\u201d Pan Kuang knew that was his only way to escape. Although Pan Kuang was a Superhuman himself, his fear of being surrounded by a gargantuan enemy force prompted him to increase his speed. He failed to realize that Ji Jie was deeply fatigued.After chasing for about twenty minutes, both parties were far from the frontline.\u201cThe time is right.\u201d Han Xiao could feel a sense of determination. He changed his course and went in front of his targets with the help of a map he had stolen from the logistics department. The jeep travelled at a very high speed, and Han Xiao drove up a ten-meter high cliff that was two kilometers away, which his targets were sure to pa.s.s by. The engine stopped, and Han Xiao took out all his gear.He slotted his left arm into the modified light-weight mechanical arm and attached the box housing the magnetically-controlled retractable armor to his waist. He stuck his Berserk Eagle into its case and then buried ten delayed-explosion explosives in the shape of a circle with a radius of five meters. A thin thread was lined through the safety rings of the delayed-explosion explosives, so a slight pull would activate them all.Han Xiao grabbed a sniper rifle he had sourced from the logistics team and lay p.r.o.ne on a rock. He had a clear view of the valley and aimed his rifle in the direction his targets were expected to arrive in. He held his breath and focused hard.\u2026Ji Jie was panting heavily. His face was all pale from the running. He was not a Superhuman, so he had limited stamina. If it wasn\u2019t for Pan Kuang, he would have collapsed long ago.Pan Kuang shouted emotionlessly, \u201cDon\u2019t stop, the enemy could approach at any moment. We need to reach the hangar as soon as possible.\u201dThe two of them came out of the forest quickly. The mountains lay ahead of them.Ji Jie felt his legs wobble before he fell to the ground. Breathlessly, he said, \u201cI can\u2019t run anymore.\u201dPan Kuang frowned. He was slightly irritated, but he knew he could not leave Ji Jie behind. Ji Jie\u2019s sister was the in-charge of the entire intelligence network of the Germinal Organization.\u201cCarry me on your back, it is\u2026\u201dJi Jie was halfway through his sentence when a gun shot rang in the air.Pan Kuang reacted quickly and ducked backwards.However, he was not the target of the shot.Ji Jie\u2019s head was thrust backwards as if a punch had been thrown at him. There was a b.l.o.o.d.y hole on his left cheek. The hole was so big that it allowed the bullet to tumble in Ji Jie\u2019s skull, crus.h.i.+ng his left cheek. Blood and flesh splattered everywhere. Ji Jie\u2019s expression froze as he collapsed to the ground. He showed no signs of life anymore.[a.s.sa.s.sination 2 completed. 100% of energy expended. You gained 4,000 EXP!]Pan Kuang\u2019s pupils constricted. He drew out his machete and dashed toward the source of the shot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Han Xiao spammed the trigger of the rifle. Chains of bullets skipped out of the barrel and pierced through the air, heading in the direction of the target. It was as if Pan Kuang had the danger-sensing ability of a beast. He always changed his position before Han Xiao fired the shots. Han Xiao fired a total of thirteen shots, and Pan Kuang dodged nine of them. The remaining four bullets lost their momentum after hitting the blade. The bullets were reflected by Pan Kuang\u2019s protective energy, and their total damage was merely 80 HP.A high cla.s.s Superhuman would have a stronger defensive capability. Ordinary weapons and ammunition were useless against Pan Kuang.The firepower of an ordinary weapon from a place indicated the general level of civilization of that place. With the opening up of higher versions and more maps, the upgrading of the ordinary weapons would follow. However, it was evident that such a day had yet come.The distance between Pan Kuang and Han Xiao was shrinking rapid, and Han Xiao could see the deathly chill in Pan Kuang\u2019s eyes.\u201cd.a.m.n it, he\u2019s quick.\u201dHan Xiao cursed softly and threw his rifle to the side. He tugged the thread in his hands and activated the delayed-explosion explosives then pretended fleeing.Pan Kuang was much faster and went up the cliff in a few steps. He stepped into the ambush circle and sensed something was off. His face changed, and he leapt into the air. His s.h.i.+ny blade was spinning beneath his torso. It was as if he was riding a hurricane, pus.h.i.+ng him up the skies.BOOM!The ten explosives detonated together, and Pan Kuang was engulfed by the flames!_____________________Your delayed-explosion explosives dealt a damage of 34 HP to Pan Kuang.(Damage protection is taken into account.)Your delayed-explosion explosives dealt a damage of 37 HP to Pan Kuang.Pan Kuang is slightly torched!\u2026\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afTen messages appeared on the interface, and after a quick glance, Han Xiao confirmed that the series of explosions had dealt more than 400 HP damage to Pan Kuang._____________________Due to your level, you gained some information about the enemy!Name: Pan KuangLevel: 38Cla.s.s: [Agent] LV10, [Amateur Pugilist] LV10, [Stormblader] LV10, ??Attributes: 65 STR, ??

Also, much of the information was unknown. However, Han Xiao was not completely reliant on hard statistics. From the performance of Pan Kuang, it was evident that he had high attacking power and agility, and his weak side would be his limited health. It was certain that the explosion had taken away 20% of Pan Kuang\u2019s initial health. Furthermore, Pan Kuang had faced tough battles previously and spent an hour on the run from his enemies; therefore, he was not in his best condition for a fight.I have a higher probability of winning!Han Xiao looked at the experience that he had acc.u.mulated on the interface, and it was as high as 520,000 points. He channeled all the experience points into raising his levels! Like a rocket, Han Xiao rapidly gained four levels.His HP was raised to 985, almost exceeding 1,000!He had practiced the Energy Training Technique 48 times, and his energy had managed to hit 390 points. He just needed a little more to gain four continuous level-ups and raise his energy to 540 points, which exceeded the Lv.5 benchmark of 400 points. That would allow for new increases in all his other attributes. His strength, endurance, agility, and intelligence were increased by approximately 10% each.The rest of the experience points were channeled into [Continuous Gliding Shots]._____________________Level 2: a slight increase in the effect of the ability.\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afWoos.h.!.+Pan Kuang emerged from the flames, and he was charred from head to toe. He looked battered, and his eyes were locked on to Han Xiao like an exasperated wolf. He growled and s.h.i.+fted his feet as if he was gliding. In the blink of an eye, he slashed his blade with fury in an attempt to disintegrate the scoundrel who had ambushed him!The light from the blade flashed, and Han Xiao retreated three steps. Han Xiao\u2019s speed shocked Pan Kuang.Han Xiao dodged the slashes from Pan Kuang and took out his Berserk Eagles. With his increased attack-speed, he fired the pistols. The bullets, which had ferrous cores, went straight toward Pan Kuang\u2019s chest.Pan Kuang moved his machete back and forth, and the bullets were slashed apart. Only one bullet managed to hit his chest, but Pan Kuang\u2019s immense energy lowered the bullet\u2019s momentum. The bullet was stuck between his muscles.Han Xiao realized that ordinary bullets were of little use. He immediately switched the magazine for high-explosive rounds.Pan Kuang made use of this moment to approach closer.\u201cHow dare you switch magazines right before my eyes! Are you tired of living?\u201dChanging magazine in front of a Pugilist was a sign of insufficient battle experience! Pan Kuang, with a sinister look on his face, slashed toward Han Xiao\u2019s throat. He tried to pierce through Han Xiao\u2019s neck as if it just was a piece of meat on the skewer.Pan Kuang could tell that Han Xiao could not dodge his hack!\u201cDing \u2013\u2013\u201dThe edge of the blade managed to touch Han Xiao\u2019s throat, but it was blocked by metallic scales!Pan Kuang\u2019s pupils constricted. When did this armor appear\u203dHan Xiao felt a little suffocated. Although the magnetically-controlled retractable armor could withstand the shock, there was still some leftover force that landed on his body. He raised the pistol and started firing continuously. Pan Kuang blocked the bullets with his blade again. This time, the high explosive rounds detonated the moment the blade touched its tip, and the flames enshrouded Pan Kuang\u2019s body and burnt him.What the h.e.l.l is this bullet? Pan Kuang\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He channeled his energy to shake off the flames but to no avail. The orange flames could not be shaken off, and his skin burned harshly. He could only retract his energy to protect his body. That resulted in a huge amount of energy being expended.The high-explosive rounds were highly adhesive. Therefore, they were able to cause substantial, continuous damage. Pan Kuang had a high defense, so his HP was falling at a very slow rate. However, using the high-explosive rounds was still more effective than normal rounds. At least, the former was causing a decrease in Pan Kuang\u2019s HP.The Berserk Eagles were spitting out rounds from slanted positions. When there was a final bullet left, Han Xiao used it to initiate the continuous gliding shots. At that point in time, Pan Kuang\u2019s clothing was burnt completely, and his hair also started burning. The price Han Xiao had to pay was the endurance of the magnetic armor, which fell after the relentless, powerful slashes by Pan Kuang.Han Xiao focused hard. At the cost of taking another powerful blow, he put away the Berserk Eagles and took out the retractable machete. He held the machete in his right hand and the mechanical arm in his left. It was as if a barbarian had taken over his body; he had the courage of a beast that was unafraid of death. He was ready to give Pan Kuang a hard fight, which was also likely to be a b.l.o.o.d.y one.The three items that Han Xiao was equipped with could all be used as s.h.i.+elds, and in comparison, Pan Kuang was heavily disadvantaged since he could only use his body to defend Han Xiao\u2019s strikes.However, in reality, Pan Kuang was steadily gaining ground. For most of the time, Han Xiao could only make a strike at Pan Kuang after receiving seven slashes. The fighting abilities of the two individuals were too far apart. Pan Kuang was a legitimate pugilist, and his fighting technique was stronger than that of Han Xiao by leaps and bounds. Han Xiao\u2019s close-range combat technique was considered a joke by Pan Kuang. If not for the gear he was equipped with, Pan Kuang would be unscathed by Han Xiao\u2019s attacks.\u201cYou want to fight me up close? Don\u2019t you think that you are courting death?\u201d Pan Kuang could not understand how Han Xiao had the courage to challenge a pugilist in close-quarters. In his mind, he considered such an act to be extremely arrogant. Han Xiao was challenging Pan Kuang\u2019s greatest strength with his greatest weakness.A slash toward Han Xiao\u2019s face resulted in a deep cut that bled profusely.Han Xiao had taken off his mask before the battle as he had been afraid that it would be destroyed in the battle. He revealed his genuine appearance, and Pan Kuang recognized him. Han Xiao was the traitor that escaped from the organization not long ago\u2014Zero.Why did Number Zero attack him here? Pan Kuang did not know, and he did not care. He only knew that the man before him was an enemy, and all Pan Kuang wanted to do was to hack him to death!The force from the slashes shocked Han Xiao\u2019s body a few times. His HP decreased, but he remained calm.The reason he dared to fight Pan Kuang close up was because he had faith in himself. The previous shots, explosions, and strikes had managed to lower Pan Kuang\u2019s HP by 700 to 800 points.Under the protection of the magnetically-controlled retractable armor, his HP only fell by 300 points. The armor managed to prevent a total damage of at least 150 points of HP.The armor was not even meant to be worn by Han Xiao at his current level. The armor had a defense of 75 points. It was strong and useful even until higher levels of 40-50. Han Xiao depended greatly on the armor!With the armor, he had the ability to fight opponents of much higher levels!Han Xiao locked his hand and grabbed hard on Pan Kuang blade-wielding hand. Pan Kuang was not afraid. He twisted his arm flexibly and broke free; at the same time, he gave Han Xiao another slash, which landed on the lightweight mechanical arm. If not for the platinum alloy, the mechanical arm would have long disintegrated into pieces and shards.Han Xiao attentively discovered that Pan Kuang had a brief moment after every strike when he slowed down. Pan Kuang was instinctively trying to conserve his energy.He is starting to feel tired. He used up too much of his energy and lost his additional attributes. He is no longer sharp!Han Xiao eyes started flas.h.i.+ng, and his sharp ac.u.men allowed him to discover Pan Kuang weakness; the moment that he was waiting for had arrived. He selected an option on his interface.A new character\u2014Norsa Connor!_____________________The summon card for character has been used. 1/1 card used.

Therefore, it was almost impossible for his intelligence to exceed 50. If Han Xiao was really that unlucky and Pan Kuang did have higher than expected intelligence, Han Xiao would have had choice but to resign to his fate.The illusion confused Pan Kuang, who was totally unprepared for it. All the attacks from the illusion could deal real damage to Pan Kuang, but ultimately, Pan Kuang had a relatively high level, so he would not be defeated if Han Xiao relied on the illusion alone.Without hesitation, Han Xiao\u2019s lightweight mechanical arm headed for Pan Kuang crotch, which housed his most vulnerable body part!\u201cMega-load!\u201dThe power of the mechanical increased by 30% instantly, and the punch landed right on the target.Pan Kuang\u2019s wiener exploded!Han Xiao had learned this move after observing a series of tapes. He had derived this legendary move from \u201cThe Faraway Home of the Warrior \u2013 The Third Twilight\u201d. Once the move was activated, even the skies would tremble.Han Xiao had no time to look at the messages on the interface. He needed to make use of the period when Pan Kuang was distracted by the illusion to deal as much damage as he could.Han Xiao immediately activated the pressure compressor in the palm of the mechanical arm. His palm went through a sudden vibration, and a shockwave was sent out. Blood seeped out of Pan Kuang skin, and a blood red triangle could be seen on Pan Kuang\u2019s crouch.Of course, Han Xiao\u2019s right hand was also put to use. Using the machete held in his right hand, Han Xiao stabbed hard into Pan Kuang\u2019s chest without any hesitation. Pan Kuang was still affected by the illusion, and thus, the protective energy s.h.i.+elding his body was non-existent. The stab successfully pierced through Pan Kuang.Han Xiao then reached out for his Berserk Eagles and stuck the barrels of the pistols right where Pan Kuang\u2019s heart was. He used his wind-gliding steps to drag Pan Kuang backwards together with him. Han Xiao fired the shots continuously, and all the bullets went into Pan Kuang\u2019s body.Blood spurted out. There was a burning sound of the scorching ember sizzling human flesh.Ka, Ka, Ka\u2013\u2013All the bullets in the magazine were expended, and Pan Kuang was finally awake. The sharp pain sent Pan Kuang into thunderous fury, and his face twisted in agony. He slashed hard at Han Xiao\u2019s abdomen.It seemed Pan Kuang wanted an eye for an eye.Han Xiao used his energy to control the magnetic retractable armor to s.h.i.+eld himself from the strike. Although he was protected, the shock from the strike still made Han Xiao pale. He could sense a chilly wave of energy going all the way up to his forehead via his spine.Enduring the pain, Han Xiao expanded the reach of the mechanical arm to press hard onto Pan Kuang\u2019s head. Pan Kuang was hurled to the ground back and forth. The back of Pan Kuang\u2019s head, after coming into contact with the ground so many times, started bleeding profusely, forming a puddle of blood on the ground. Coupled with growls of agony, Pan Kuang was desperately trying to retaliate by slas.h.i.+ng his machete hysterically. The slashes landed on Han Xiao\u2019s armor, and his HP was steadily decreasing.\u201cThe crack of a hundred winds!\u201d Pan Kuang yelled manically before his blade suddenly let out a blinding glare.Han Xiao was alarmed and moved backward immediately. At this of time, explosions of light emerged from the Wind-slicing Blade. They surrounded Pan Kuang like a tornado. Countless slash marks could be seen on the surrounding ground. Han Xiao suffered a head-on attack, and his armor was losing endurance. This move had a damage-radius that was too large for the armor to offer complete protection. Every part not protected by the armor turned b.l.o.o.d.y. There was a series of damage inflicted on Han Xiao, and each amounted to 40 points.The light from blade continued to glare for about three seconds before disappearing. Han Xiao retreated about ten meters. He took a deep breath. Droplets containing blood and sweat were dripping down as he stared at Pan Kuang. The previous attack must have consumed much of Pan Kuang\u2019s energy. Also, the cool down period for the move was definitely long; therefore, Pan Kuang would not be able to use it anytime soon!Pan Kuang supported his body using the blade and stood up. He looked ghastly, and his lower body was in a b.l.o.o.d.y mess. There were charred bullet marks in his chest, and the ember was still scorching his body, giving out a smell of burnt charcoal. The burning and bleeding were dealing him continuous damage, and one could not imagine how his damaged body looked from the inside. The retractable machete was still stuck in his chest. His face looked even more horrifying. His nose had broken and was dented inward, and his skull was exposed from the back of his head. He looked like a savage ghost.A savage ghost!The savage ghost stared hard at Han Xiao.Han Xiao looked alarmed. He was prepared to use all his additional points to increase his endurance. That was another trump card he held.The howling wind brought the sand along while, at the same time, seemingly bringing away the murderous atmosphere.Pan Kuang\u2019s head drooped down, and he stopped breathing.The final sign of life was decimated by the scorching burn. Pan Kuang was like a camel that was knocked to the ground by a piece of gra.s.s._____________________You killed Pan Kuang (Lv 38), 21,000 EXP gained.The enemy killed was ten levels above you. You gained an additional 280% experience worth 58,800 points. Your individual contribution rate was 99%.You gained an additional 58,212 (99%) points of EXP.[a.s.sa.s.sination III] completed.

The additional EXP was in accordance to the respective contribution rates of the member of a team since most missions were team challenges. If any member of the team failed to meet the criteria mentioned, the entire team would be deprived of the additional rewards. Such a measure highlighted the importance of good cooperation, and cheating from the players was prevented. It also prevented the occurrence of free-loaders that leeched onto the efforts of others.Han Xiao finally relaxed and sat on the ground. He then lay down, allowing the rays of sunlight to hit his face. He closed his eyes in peace and enjoyed the calm and silence after the battle, as if all the damage and destruction did not exist.A thought suddenly flashed in his mind, and he immediately jumped up and checked his pants. The little Han Xiao in his pants was all good. He heaved a sigh of relief. Luckily, the sleeping dragon in his pants had not been damaged at all.After a short rest, Han Xiao started to check on the damage. The endurance levels for all his equipment had dropped drastically. The delayed-explosion explosives had all been used. His HP had started to recover, and the overall damage was within his expectations.Han Xiao walked to Pan Kuang\u2019s dead body, which was still in an upright position. He searched for any loot and found a hard object in Pan Kuang\u2019s pocket. He took it out and discovered that it was a communication device from the Germinal Organization.Han Xiao thought for a moment and decided to activate the device. Ten seconds later, a virtual image of the chief of the Germinal Organization appeared.\u201cJi Jie, have you guys retreated successfully\u2026\u201d The chief was halfway through his words when he realized that something was amiss with the image transmitted over from the other side.It was Han Xiao. The chief changed his expression immediately and glared at Han Xiao.\u201cWhy are you here\u203d\u201dZero was using Ji Jie\u2019s communication device, and it was apparent that the base had been completely destroyed. It was also highly likely that Pan Kuang was dead.\u201cYou have the audacity to contact me?\u201d the enraged chief exclaimed.\u201cYo, haven\u2019t seen you for a long time.\u201d Han Xiao laughedIf felt weird that Han Xiao was talking to him like a long-lost friend. The chief could not think of a reply immediately, so he paused for a moment. The chief then questioned, \u201cWhere did you obtain the confidential information?\u201dThat was the greatest puzzle in the chief\u2019s mind.\u201cWhy do you think I will tell you the answer?\u201d Han Xiao replied sn.o.bbishly.\u201cDo you think you can damage the power of the organization with such means? What a fool!\u201d the chief yelled back.\u201cI sabotaged four of your bases.\u201cI can destroy you easily with my hands!\u201cI sabotaged four of your bases.\u201cThere are many executive officers in the organization. You won\u2019t be out there for long!\u201cI sabotaged four of your bases.\u201dAhhh! Too angry!From the tone of the chief\u2019s words, it sounded as if he was chewing on metal and every word was filled with the utmost determination to kill Han Xiao. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that you will be able to escape from our clutches by pledging your allegiance to Stardragon. My guys will disintegrate every bone and tendon in you once they catch you!\u201dHan Xiao started laughing. Following that, he blew a kiss at the chief.\u201cCome and find me if you can? Hahaha\u2026\u201dThe chief was completely enraged upon hearing Han Xiao\u2019s words of contempt. He wanted to say something, but before he could, Han Xiao destroyed the communication device. The screen blacked out.The chief\u2019s words of fury were stuck in his throat. He was shaking in anger.\u201cIncrease the bounty on Zero to five million dollars!\u201dThe bounty increased by five times!\u2026Han Xiao wiped his smile away. Teasing the chief was not just a random act of entertainment.The Germinal Organization was bound to send members to the West Capital to find him. They would not rest until he was dead.The situation seemed disadvantageous to him, but in actual fact, it was not.Because\u2026Han Xiao never wanted to return to Stardragon!This was his real plan!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 - The Real Plan!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 87: The Real Plan!Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas StudiosInitially, Han Xiao turned to Stardragon to seek temporary asylum from the Germinal Organization and had the motive of advancing skills. He had long planned to use his Facial Simulator as a way to escape.Once he had the Facial Simulator, it was almost impossible for the Germinal Organization to locate him. He no longer had to worry about being discovered and captured, which meant that he could go anywhere he wanted. He did not want to be restricted to an area where there was always a risk of angering the head of state. Furthermore, he could mislead the Germinal Organization with regards to his whereabouts. For them to focus all their attention on Stardragon\u2026that was definitely not fun for Han Xiao! Definitely not!Even if he wanted to borrow Stardragon\u2019s strength and resources to crush the Germinal Organization, he no longer needed to put himself under the government\u2019s control. Naturally, Stardragon did not fully trust him despite its amicable treatment of him. They had planted an extremely discrete GPS locator in his encrypted phone, which he had discovered long ago. It was finally the time for him to disarm it.It was last three months before the open beta. He needed to level up quickly and acc.u.mulate more resources. There were countless missions on the planet, and he treasured every one of them greatly.He had acc.u.mulated sufficient resources while working with Division 13. It was now time to drop his pretense of sincerity toward Stardragon and go solo.He could now go anywhere he wanted on the vast planet.His plans were meticulous and closely-linked.In Han Xiao\u2019s eyes, his pleasant relations.h.i.+p with Stardragon was not enough to convince him to stay in a place that lacked the potential to become more powerful. Furthermore, once they reached Version 2.0, even the Six nations and the Germinal Organization would become feeble.These ent.i.ties were now powerful and stable and could fight with one another through both open and secret means. However, the moment a planetary-grade disaster swept the planet, they would realize that their individual interests were hollow and meaningless compared to the survival of the whole civilization. Their statuses now were like colorful bubbles flying under the Sunlight\u2014they could easily burst with a slight poke.Version 1.0 hasn\u2019t started. It will last for seven months in real life, which translates to about three and a half years in game time. Additionally, the time, in game, between the version updates will last for a year. This means that I am still five years away from the Undead Crisis.The Undead Crisis was a huge disaster. It will be better for me to avoid the beginning of it at the start of Version 2.0, which will be the most dangerous and chaotic period. This means that in these five years, I will have to dig out all the things are useful for me on this planet and then find a way to leave this planet for a while.Han Xiao was in deep thought.Suddenly, a new message was shown on the Interface._____________________[Camp mission: Destroy Dark Crow Valley Base] Completion Rate 100%.

He would only have gotten a completion rate of forty to fifty percent if he did not kill Pan Kuang and gang. It had been worth the trouble to infiltrate alone and plant two spies in the base, which allowed him to monitor the enemy\u2019s movements the whole time. This was the reason he had received such a high contribution rate and reward._____________________Camp-Destroyer Mission [Dark Crow Valley Base] has been completed.

Seems like I\u2019m quite lucky this time. Han Xiao was delighted. Large-scale missions and serial missions would release performance ratings upon completion. The probability of an excellent rating triggering a random award was only thirty percent, so it was rather uncommon. The system would decide first which type of random reward the player would receive\u2014it could be anything, such as EXP, equipment, skills, stat points, or talent points. Then, the player could select the choices provided under the reward._____________________You received the Random Reward Type: [Innate Ability]Randomizing\u2026 Randomization complete.

[Strengthened Body] increased health points, so it was more suited for tank players. Usually, he employed long-range attacks, and he still had a magnetic suit to protect his body, so he did not require the additional HP for now.[Quick Paced] seemed decent. Agility affected many different aspects of a long-range attacks, including accuracy, critical rate, and movement speed etc. This ability could potentially increase his attack output by eight to ten percent.[Strengthened Spirit] was only useful for Mages and Psychics.Han Xiao thus opted for [Quick Paced]._____________________You gained an innate ability [Quick Paced].\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304Han Xiao looked at his interface. He still had 12 Una.s.signed Stats that he had gained from levelling-up. He then added them all into Intelligence. His Intelligence was now his highest stat, standing at 88 points.There was an increase of 1.8% on the A-cla.s.s Quest [Fall of the Germinal]. Although it did not look like a significant increase for now, Xiao Han knew that the future potential gains would be much greater\u2014at least ten to fifteen percent more. Because Dark Crow Valley Base was the nearest point of contact for future players to join the Germinal Organization. Without it, many \u2018real\u2019 players would join a camp that was nearer and more convenient for them. This would greatly contain the rate of expansion of the Germinal Organization in the near future.The head of Germinal still did not realize the importance of this base; he was only dismayed by the loss of an ordinary large base.Intel from Han Xiao allowed other powers an opportunity to attack the Germinal Organization. The mission progress he received from such events was less than a direct a.s.sault by himself based on the calculation of contribution rating. But if he were to insist on attacking the organization personally, the individual damage he could deal would not be sufficient to keep up with organization\u2019s rate of expansion. Naturally, his best option was to ma.s.s distribute intel that could harm the organization.The minimum progress needed for the Camp Destroyer mission was only twenty percent. It was not required for him to chase after perfection lest he risked losing out on other missions.It is time to change the method of supplying intel. Han Xiao squinted.After completing the mission, it was time for him to work on other important things.Han Xiao went onto the radio and spoke to Lin Yao.\u201cHow is the situation now?\u201d\u201cBrother Xiao! The Heslean Army has seized all the supplies in Dark Crow Valley Base. They also captured a few hundred of their members, including Dormund. Unfortunately, the two directors, Pan Kuang and Ji Jie, got away.\u201d\u201cWhere is the army now?\u201d\u201cThey are still sweeping the battleground. They will probably retreat to the border tomorrow.\u201d\u201cOkay. Message received.\u201d\u2026After the Heslean army finished sweeping the battleground, they set up camp on site and prepared for a withdrawal the next day.Lin Yao and Lambert went on to meet up with the rest, and the Division 13 agents gathered to commend them for their excellent intel work.\u201cThe younger generation of agents is very capable,\u201d Ma Qing Yang commented.\u201cXiao Lin Lin, your teammates have done a great job,\u201d said Di Su Su.The rest chimed in. \u201cYou guys did an excellent job. Really commendable.\u201d\u201cWe acted under the directions given by Brother Xiao.\u201d Lin Yao was feeling slightly uneasy with all the praise.The fellow Division 13 agents realized that it was Han Xiao who deserved all the recognition.Qi Bai Jia decided to praise Han Xiao\u2019s contribution strongly in his report. However, he realized that Han Xiao was still not back.\u201cHey, where is he?\u201d\u201cHe is probably delayed by certain things.\u201dAs the sky turned dark, Han Xiao was still nowhere to be seen.\u201cHow is he still not back?\u201d Li Ya Lin was puzzled, so she nudged Lin Yao to prompt him to contact Han Xiao.\u201cI tried to communicate with him more than forty times, but he still hasn\u2019t answered.\u201d Lin Yao was out of options.It was dawn. The Heslean army was ready to move back to the border, but Han Xiao was still missing. Division 13 agents started imagining the possibilities for such an odd happening.Zhang Wei had a sudden thought. \u201cIs it possible that Han Xiao has already moved back to the border?\u201d\u201cThis is possible. Han Xiao has always moved around on his own. He may think that it is not necessary for him to meet up with them now.\u201d Everyone pondered over this possibility.All the agents followed the army back while this worry lingered in their minds.\u2026The Hesla troops looked relaxed and were rather undisciplined on the way back.In the middle of the troops, Colonel Carl was sitting in the command vehicle. He was deliberating over a very grave problem.In this mission, he did not have an outstanding performance. Instead, he made a critical error in his decision, which resulted in unnecessary casualties. This would most definitely lead to a poor evaluation of his ability by the higher ups.He had to artificially raise his significance in this mission to obtain more merits for this attack.If I could take credit for Division 13\u2019s contribution\u2026Carl had an idea. He could perhaps write on the report that it was him who instructed Han Xiao to take his two teammates to spy in the base that gave them critical intel. In this scenario, his significance as a commanding office would be greatly elevated.This can work.Division 13 will leave as soon as the mission is completed. They can\u2019t possibly come to Hesla and expose me. Furthermore, my report to the higher-ups will be kept secret from everyone else.All of a sudden, there was a commotion coming from the outside of the vehicle, and Carl realized that the troops had stopped moving.\u201cColonel, there are two corpses in front of us. They seem to be Pan Kuang and Ji Jie.\u201dCarl was in shock. He left the vehicle quickly to check out the bodies. It was really the two directors of the base.The troops were astonished, and they started chattering. They remembered how strong these two directors had been just few days ago, but they had been killed just like this.\u201cWho did this! Who left the bodies here?\u201d Carl shouted.n.o.body had an answer as the troops looked at one another. They had just discovered the bodies.Division 13 soon arrived at the scene upon hearing the commotion. They were too dumbfounded.\u201cIt must be Han Xiao\u2019s doing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that he actually succeeded!\u201d\u201cBut why did he place the bodies on the road? This is just giving free credit to the Hesleans.\u201dCarl was beaming joyously; he could claim credit for killing the directors. He waved at his troops to wrap up the bodies and take them back to camp.Just as the troops moved the bodies, the sound of landmines being activated was heard.The troops were terrified, and they quickly jumped away in different directions.Carl was caught off guard. He only had the time to drop on the floor.However, there was no explosion after seconds had pa.s.sed. A brave soldier stood up and went to dig out the landmines. He weighed it in his hand and realized that it was very light.\u201cThis is not a real mine. They are all empty.\u201dThe troops were infuriated by the prank.\u201cThis is not funny at all.\u201d\u201cWhat a wretched move!\u201d\u201cI just peed in my pants!\u201dDivision 13 agents had a weird look their faces\u2014they did not know whether to laugh at what they saw.\u201cThis seems like something Han Xiao would do,\u201d Li Ya Lin mumbled.Carl stood up with a fl.u.s.tered look on his face. His clean and well-pressed officer uniform was now covered in mud and gra.s.s.He was now livid. He knew it was Xiao Han who did it. He wanted to ruffle him with a prank like this.\u201cWhat a childish play!\u201d he said in anger.Bang!A faint gunshot was heard faraway.The bullet pierced through Carl\u2019s temple, and it brought a dash of blood out of his head.Carl\u2019s eyes were still wide open. He was unable to comprehend what had just transpired, totally caught unaware. His eyes were filled with the longing for life and a pinch of disbelief. His body wobbled before it landed flat on the floor.Just a moment ago, he had been dreaming of his military success and his bright future. He could not believe that he had been killed on the way back to claim credit for his success in the mission!At this moment, everyone, including the Division 13 agents and the troops, was sh.e.l.l-shocked.They could not believe what had just happened before their eyes!\u2026..On a faraway cliff top, Han Xiao raised his head from the scope of a sniper. He was looking relaxed.What goes around comes around.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88 - InfluencePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 88: InfluenceTranslator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas StudiosHan Xiao had gone to the road the night before when the troops were camping at the battleground. He had planted a trap using the corpses of Pan Kuang and Ji Jie to lure Colonel Carl out of his vehicle. The moment Carl stepped out of his command vehicle, Han Xiao had the opportunity to snipe him down.Additionally, he had placed a blank landmine beneath the bodies to scare the troops out of their formation so that he could get a better shot at Colonel Carl from the distant cliff.Killing a high-ranking Hesla officer in front of everybody was bound to raise suspicion from the Hesleans. They could probably deduce that it was Han Xiao who did it based on the use of the two bodies, but Han Xiao was not at all worried. They had no concrete evidence to proof that he was guilty. As long as Division 13 denied it, all Hesla could do was protest diplomatically. They could never hold Han Xiao accountable.Just like Carl did not care if the enemy killed them, Zhang Wei\u2019s team could also push the blame to the escaped personnel from the Dark Crow Valley Base.I can be just as devious as you, Carl.Han Xiao c.o.c.ked the barrel, and the smoky bullet cartridge fell out. He conveniently tossed it into his pocket, leaving no trace behind.Carl\u2019s order had almost taken his life. He was bound to take revenge after the mission was completed. Han Xiao had once been a \u2018real\u2019 player who had always taken revenge when someone, regardless of who they were, harmed him. And he would avenge himself in all sorts of ways without saying much.Han Xiao saw that the Hesla troops were in a mess through his scope. Some of the troops were furious. They boarded their vehicles and moved rapidly toward the source of the fire.He calmly stowed the dissembled sniper into his backpack. He had handpicked the position for an easy escape after the a.s.sa.s.sination.After turning around, he jumped off the cliff, and a feeling of freefall hit him immediately. He smacked the b.u.t.ton on his back, and two fine, foldable metal wings expanded. He was then gliding in the air toward the forest beneath the cliff.Sky Swallow Gliders!When the Hesla troops arrived at the cliff, all they could see was a nimble shadow rapidly disappearing before their eyes.\u2026..Division 13 agents were still dumbfounded. They could not believe that Han Xiao had the guts to kill a commanding officer from Hesla.It was a definitely a good way to vent one\u2019s anger, but there would be dire consequences. Nothing was worse than killing a Hesla high-ranking military officer right on their land! It seemed that Han Xiao had the b.a.l.l.s of steel!Qi Bai Jia was greatly anxious, but when he saw that the Hesla troops had not caught anyone, he was relieved.Thank goodness he got away. In this case, they cannot prove that he is guilty. We can still argue our case.Wait! If Han Xiao disappears, are we going to take his place in the trials\u203dEveryone\u2019s eyes were wide open. They felt it was something that Han Xiao would definitely do.How can he just push all the troubles to us! He is such a master at s.h.i.+rking responsibility!The surrounding Hesla troops raised their rifles in anger and pointed them at the Division 13 agents. They were arrested, locked up in the cars, and escorted back to the border camp. As soon as deputy officer reported the incident, Hesla\u2019s government was furious.Hesla\u2019s agents had to interrogate Division 13 as they were the prime suspect.However, they soon became frustrated. Division 13 insisted that they did not know anything about the incident. Winna felt a sense of defeat.Everyone knew that Han Xiao had done it, but no one had any evidence to proof that it was him. They could not even find the cartridge, which meant the only thing they could do was interrogate Division 13 over and over again. Since they could not use torturous methods to extort information because they were up against the Stardragon agents, their efforts were in vain. Moreover, the condemnation from the higher-ups of Hesla was met with empty excuses from Division 13.The head of Intelligence in Division 13 took a private jet to quickly arrive at the Hesla border in order to rescue his agents. Without any concrete evidence, Hesla had to release the Division 13 agents.The head of Intelligence brought everyone out of the interrogation room and back to the jet. He ordered Qi Bai Jia to report on the details of the incident after he was certain that there was no Hesla personnel around.\u201cHe is such a trouble-maker. Fortunately, he did not leave any trace. Otherwise, Hesla would not have rested until they found him,\u201d he said.Qi Bai Jia was feeling embarra.s.sed and dared not reply. Ultimately, he had to take the full responsibility as the Stardragon leader of this mission.The head of Intelligence looked at him without saying a word. He reflected on the reaction of the higher ups in Division 13 upon hearing this news. They believed that Carl\u2019s orders were authorized by the high-ranking officials in Hesla. It was the only reasonable conclusion to explain why Hesla purposefully sent a radical officer to helm this mission. They were displeased with Hesla\u2019s insidious acts. It was actually quite a good ending. After all, Hesla failed in causing any harm to Stardragon agents, and yet, they lost a high-ranking officer. They even had to swallow the loss without catching the culprit.\u201cThis fellow did an excellent job.\u201d The Head of Intelligence nodded quietly. This time, even the hawks in the department had nothing critical to say about this incident. In fact, they loved what Han Xiao did. If one had the audacity to plot against Stardragon, the retaliation would be swift and deadly.Despite the appreciation, the heads of the Department unanimously agreed in the previous internal meeting that they had to impose greater control on Han Xiao and not let him escape their surveillance. As their source of valuable intel, Han Xiao was far too important to warrant any accidents or mishaps.Because of Han Xiao\u2019s cooperative att.i.tude, they had been too lenient with his actions, but since the incident from the joint mission, they became deeply alarmed. They came to the consensus to reject any of Han Xiao\u2019s future mission requests.This motion was pa.s.sed without any objection, even from the conservatives in the Division 13. The department was still willing to cooperate with Han Xiao, but before divulging all the intel he had, he would not leave the headquarters\u2019 surveillance.The Head of Intelligence finished contemplating and looked at the team of agents. He then looked at his watch and said in a puzzled tone, \u201cWhy is Han Xiao still not back?\u201d\u201cI have no idea.\u201d Qi Bai Jia shook his head.\u201cHan Xiao just contacted me.\u201d Lin Yao suddenly pressed his headphone as he became overly-excited. But the next second, his expression changed drastically.\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d The Head of Intelligence had a bad hunch.\u201cBrother Xiao said\u2026 he is going to lie low until the dust settles,\u201d Lin Yao stammered.\u201cLie low until the dust settles? This means\u2026.\u201d The Head of Intelligence was slow to process the meaning of this message. Then, he quickly realized what it meant. \u201cHe is not coming back\u203d\u201dHis expression turned ghastly.Zhang Wei looked sh.e.l.l-shocked. Li Ya Lin was wide-eyed. Lambert was in disbelief.Everyone was utterly shocked.It looked as if he was really going solo!There was really nothing he was afraid to do!\u2026Twenty minutes later in Division 13\u2019s headquarters, Gu Hui called for an emergency meeting. The directors who were not stationed at the headquarters joined the video conference. Everyone had a solemn look.\u201cHan Xiao ran away,\u201d Gu Hui said in a sobering tone.Everyone gasped.\u201cIs he defecting?\u201d\u201cUnclear. Before this, he sniped a Heslean military officer. It is possible that he is afraid of the consequences, so he escaped. But this possibility is not high,\u201d the Head of Intelligence replied.The other heads were irritated. That reason was highly improbable, unless Han Xiao believed that Stardragon was incapable of protecting him, which also meant that Han Xiao looked down at their abilities.\u201cWhat about the GPS tracker that we planted in his phone?\u201d\u201cThe tracker has not moved in the last twenty-four hours. Han Xiao discovered and removed it.\u201d\u201cHe is going to defect. He must be still near us and heading toward the wilderness. We have to bring him back!\u201d the Head of Internal Affairs thundered.\u201cWe cannot be certain that he is defecting.\u201d Gu Hui waved his hands disapprovingly.All the heads simmered silently. They had been planning to restrict him in the West Capital the moment he was back, but his sudden escape had ruined all their plans.Was it a pre-meditated move, or was it just a spur of the moment decision?Was it defection, or was it something else?Standard protocol indicated that when an agent broke contact, and when the exact cause behind the disappearance was inconclusive, the first thing they needed to do was send people to track the agent down. Then, they would contact the agent to make a judgement based on their reaction for the subsequent course of actions.If the agent resisted the capture or continued to run, they would have no choice but to hunt the agent down globally.If the agent had a good reason, the protocol ensured that a misunderstanding and manslaughter were avoided.\u201cThis is just in. The Germinal Organization has increased the reward for capturing or killing Han Xiao by five times to five million on the dark net,\u201d the Head of Intelligence said all of a sudden.Everyone was utterly surprised. This mission had been announced as a joint exercise between the two countries. How did the Germinal Organization know that Han Xiao was the main catalyst? Was there a mole within them?The increase in reward implied that the Germinal Organization was determined to kill Han Xiao more than ever. Furthermore, the organization had already located Han Xiao to be in the West Capital. Could that have been the reason for Han Xiao\u2019s departure?Was he not afraid of being located by the organization in the wilderness and slaughtered? The Germinal Organization was way more unhinged in the wilderness. They could very well fire missiles to bombard the whole area.\u201cHe came to Stardragon to seek protection in the first place. How did he suddenly have the guts to leave?\u201dThis question lingered in everyone\u2019s mind.Gu Hui knocked on table and concluded the meeting. \u201cWe will continue to keep his ident.i.ty as our agent and file him under missing personnel. The Intelligence Department will collect the surveillance tapes, migration records, and transport records from everywhere to try and contact him. We will also send out search teams to find him. We must get hold of him first before any subsequent action!\u201d\u201cSeconded.\u201d\u201cSeconded.\u201d\u201cSeconded.\u201d\u2026On the private jet back, the Division 13 agents constantly peeked at the corner, where Zhang Wei\u2019s team was. It was like the center of a high-pressure vortex.Zhang Wei pinched the bridge of his nose with a look of seriousness. The veins on his forehead were showing clearly.Lambert was wiping his knife in silence.Li Ya Lin was constantly shaking her legs with a look of indignation and anxiousness. Her tight black body suit outlined her beautiful and seductive long legs.Lin Yao was sitting at the side, frightened.He wanted to get away from his raging teammates but was afraid of doing so. He trembled in fear.\u201cThis is too much! He just left without saying anything to us. He clearly does not treat us as his teammates!\u201d Li Ya Lin slammed hard on the table. The thundery sound spooked all the other agents that were eavesdropping in the surrounding.Zhang Wei\u2019s hands held onto half of his face, and he looked as if he had nothing to live for.\u201cHe modified my armored suit\u2026 and no one else knows how to repair it,\u201d he mumbled.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was such a tragedy. The other agents did not know how to console Zhang Wei.\u201cHe asked me to take business orders for him, and he already collected the deposit for a few dozen orders. What do I do now\u203d\u201d Li Ya Lin clenched her teeth in rage.The other agents were startled. They realized that they had also made some orders\u2026c.r.a.p!Our deposits!\u201cI used my reputation to guarantee to his business. He totally ruined my reputation!\u201d Li Ya Lin now sounded like a grudging wife who was being cheated on. She pinched Lin Yao\u2019s arm in an attempt to release her anger.Lin Yao felt an immense pain. He immediately jumped far away and said hastily, \u201cCalm down\u2026 Calm down\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you know his real ident.i.ty?\u201d Lambert suddenly commented.The three of them were startled.They were unaware of his real ident.i.ty even after being on the same team for so long. Han Xiao had always been rather mysterious, and he had never divulged any information related to his real ident.i.ty. Even the higher ups had refused to tell the team.At this moment, everyone was dispirited.\u201cWhen I find him, I will definitely beat the c.r.a.p out of him,\u201d Li Ya Lin said in an infuriated voice as she cracked her knuckles loudly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89 - Three Months to Open BetaPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 89: Three Months to Open BetaTranslator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas StudiosTwo days later in Hesla\u2019s Morning Wind City\u2026A coastal city near the border, Morning Wind City had a ma.s.sive seaport that handled a ma.s.sive volume of transcontinental s.h.i.+ps. The city was a metropolis with many high-rise buildings.Hesla had the strongest maritime force among the Six Nations\u2014it focused on developing its navy to protect its numerous coastal cities. There were four continents on Aquamarine. They were separated from one another by the ma.s.sive oceans.There was an old saying\u2014he who controls the sea controls everything.There were tons of resources beneath the seafloor, including petroleum and natural ga.s.ses. Extraction of fossil fuels from the sea was the main pillar of Hesla\u2019s economy.Han Xiao remembered that Hesla had a secret military strategy called \u2018The Forth Contingency Plan Against Great Crisis\u2019. The plan was to produce many thousand-meter-long mothers.h.i.+ps in preparation for the scenario that the country suffered from ma.s.sive calamities, such as nuclear world war. They could transition into a drifting nation on the sea and preserve their population.Although this strategy eventually paved way for others, their spirit of preparing for the worst in times of peace was worth emulating. As the saying went, one who prospers in worries and hards.h.i.+ps perishes in ease and comfort. It meant that if one did not create some sort of trouble, one might as well not live.Wait. That does not sound right\u2026 Well, it\u2019s not important.Now, Han Xiao, with a new face, was waiting at the branch of Fabian Company in the city. He had used the black gold card from Matthews to receive VIP treatment at the place. It was his temporary rest stop.There were three months to open beta, and moving around on his own would yield him the greatest amount of benefits. He could use Fabian Company\u2019s channels to purchase mechanical parts with the huge amount of cash that he had acc.u.mulated to make more machinery. He could then earn a lot of EXP from this and even sell his products for more cash.Old Man Lu\u2019s secret quest would only be triggered after the open beta. He had established a good relations.h.i.+p with him, so he was in no rush to continue this mission.Han Xiao wrote down the key points for personal development for this last period of time before the open beta.\u2013 Trigger all the high-reward quests, and subsequently obtain rare skills and abilities to improve my power.\u2013 Obtain stable supply channels for mechanical parts so as to allow myself to make machinery during the course of my quests and earn more EXP.\u2013 Continue to cause destruction for the Germinal Organization.\u2013 Increase my personal mission issuance\u2019s reward limit in preparation for the open betaThese are roughly the points of focus.Han Xiao put down his pen and began thinking carefully. The first point was easy since he remembered many large-scale quests. Also, supply channels could simply be obtained from the Fabian Company with the help of the black gold VIP card.Destroying the Germinal Organization was his A-cla.s.s quest. He had some initial thoughts on how he could maximize his large reservoir of intel\u2014he could utilize the help from all the powers that were hostile toward the organization.As for his personal mission reward limit, Han Xiao\u2019s goal was to increase his Universal Reputation. Because there were two types of reward limits\u2014daily limit and individual quest limit\u2014he could increase both by improving his Universal Reputation. This was the most cost-effective method.His Universal Reputation was now zero, but that was okay. Han Xiao would definitely increase it in due time.There were three ways to obtain Universal Reputation. The first method was by achieving high contribution ratings in advanced and rare quests. Normally, only a planet\u2019s main quest line would reward Universal Reputation\u2014his A-cla.s.s quest [Fall of the Germinal] was one of them.Every planet, not only limited to novice planets, had at least one or more major storylines that linked to the respective main quests. For example, in Planet Aquamarine Version 1.0, there were two main storylines and one hidden storyline. The conflict between the Six Nations and the Germinal Organization was one of the main storylines; the others would only appear in the open beta. On the other hand, the hidden storyline could only be discovered by luck.That method of obtaining Universal Reputation was highly difficult and time-consuming\u2014he could not achieve it in a short timeframe.The second method was rather random. It involved doing things related to one\u2019s reputation with a camp that could potentially become well-known; the things could be very varied and circ.u.mstantial. n.o.body had a clear idea of how to do it, and it was quite unreliable.Han Xiao was keen on applying the third method\u2014getting on top of some ranking lists\u2014the easiest way to obtain Universal Reputation.Some factions had created publicly-recognized rankings. By climbing to the top of rankings, he could easily obtain Universal Reputation. However, if some new guys were to push him down the ranking, his Universal Reputation would decrease, making this method unreliable. That was the method employed by most \u2018real\u2019 players. Universal Reputation quickly helped one acc.u.mulated camp reputation, which in turn, gave players discounts on NPC items and provided opportunities to trigger rare quests.Han Xiao\u2019s fingers on one hand tapped the table surface as he continued to contemplate on this, and with his other hand, he picked his nose.Well, before I make a move, let me get rid all the burdens (EXP) I have now.He looked at his Character Interface, which showed a grand total of 720,000 EXP. He directly channeled all the EXP into levelling his character to thirty. His stats consequently increased.Mechanic (Novice) reached the maximum level. The last level-up always gave players the greatest stats increase. This time he received a ninety-point increase in his energy between levels nine and ten.He then threw all six una.s.signed stats into his Intelligence, making it one hundred.His mind instantly became much clearer, and he felt more at ease controlling all the machinery. Intelligence affected many different areas of a Mechanic, including production speed, production quality, and the damage bonuses when using Mechanic weapons. For example, when a Mechanic used a pistol that normally dealt twenty damage points, the pistol would deal more damage due to the Mechanic\u2019s damage bonus. As such, even though other cla.s.ses of players could still use Mechanic weapons, the damage would be lower._____________________[Mechanic (Novice)] has reached the maximum level. To advance, learn 20 blueprints.\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304This randomized requirement for advancing cla.s.s is quite simple.Han Xiao was delighted, and he counted the blueprints that he had learned so far. He was only short of eight.He did not want to produce useless blueprints through random fusions. I should make full use of the EXP I have. Anyway, all the EXP is stored in the Interface, so there is no rush to advance my cla.s.s.\u2026At Fabian Company\u2019s Morning Wind City branch, the man in charge, Antonio, was smoking a cigar. He was built like a mountain, filling the entire s.p.a.ce on the sofa. He exhaled a puff out and looked Han Xiao, who was sitting at the sofa across, up and down to size him up.Han Xiao was wearing a black jacket, and his Facial Simulator simulated an ordinary unemployed, middle-age male who looked rather una.s.suming. This was the face that he had prepared for his new ident.i.ty.Han Xiao took out a shopping list for supplies and said slowly, \u201cI want all the items on this list.\u201dAntonio took the list and looked over it. \u201cThe total cost will be $100,000. After the twenty percent discount from your Black Gold Card, it will cost $80,000.\u201d\u201cAlso, I want to buy an entry pa.s.s for The Dark Net\u2019s Blood Pact Society\u201d\u201c$20,000.\u201d Antonio\u2019s eyes narrowed.The Dark Net was the hub of all intelligence related to the underworld. It was fully controlled by the Dark Net Organization, a neutral faction that strictly followed the principles of not getting involved in conflicts and developing peacefully. Many factions were business partners with the Dark Net Organization. They provided people from the underworld many kinds of services, including, but not limited to, smuggled firearms, package transfers, safehouses, hired a.s.sa.s.sins, mercenaries, and intelligence.The Blood Pact Society was the organization for hired a.s.sa.s.sins under the Dark Net Organization. Using the entry pa.s.s, Han Xiao could become a contracted a.s.sa.s.sin under the organization and enjoy all the services provided by the Dark Net. This meant that Han Xiao could unlock his relations.h.i.+p with the Dark Net just from using the pa.s.s.Although Blood Pact Society was a lousy name, it had another world-famous name.The a.s.sa.s.sin Union!Of course, one could also call it the a.s.sa.s.sin social club, which instantly degraded its cla.s.s.A player had to go through a series of complicated quests to join the Dark Net Organization. However, time was of the essence for Han Xiao, so he would rather used extra money to buy the pa.s.s instead of spending a few dozen days fulfilling the entry requirement. Although $20,000 was a big sum of money to \u2018real\u2019 players, it was considered peanuts to him.\u201cWho says money can\u2019t buy happiness?\u201d Han Xiao muttered. When he was still a \u2018real\u2019 player, he had needed to be stingy and calculative about every single purchase. He had never felt the pleasure of having so much money to spend before this.The mechanical supplies were soon transported to the private workshop that Antonio arranged for him. Han Xiao went on to repair all the equipment that was damaged during the fight against Pan Kuang.The mechanical parts left were meant for the new machinery.I will be moving alone without any team support. Thus, my fighting style should focus more on minimizing danger. Sniping better suits me temporarily. I need to develop more powerful snipers and new types of bullets. Also, I will need some explosives, b.o.o.by-traps, and anti-vehicle weapons. Lastly, I will probably need machinery that enables me to engage in close-quarter fights, such as tiny and covert weapons that can deal maximum damage\u2026Han Xiao contemplated for a while before he drew out his Interface to start his talent fusion. He decided to start with new bullets._____________________Do you wish to proceed with talent fusion?(Lv. 3 Basic Weaponry + Lv. 3 Basic Material Science + Lv.2 Basic Dynamics Principle)This fusion will cost you 15,000 EXP!_____________________Fusion Success!Congratulations, you have discovered [Spindle-Shaped Penetration Bullet]!_____________________Do you wish to proceed with talent fusion?(Lv. 3 Basic Weaponry + Lv. 3 Basic Material Science + Lv.1 Basic Biology)This fusion will cost you 15,000 EXP!_____________________Fusion Success!Congratulations, you have discovered [Hayme Bullet]!_____________________Do you wish to proceed with talent fusion?(Lv. 3 Basic Weaponry + Lv. 3 Basic Material Science + Lv. 2 Basic Optics)This fusion will cost you 15,000 EXP!_____________________Fusion Success!Congratulations, you have discovered [Flash Bullet]!\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304I still have over 20,000 EXP left, and my sniping capability is not yet up to standard. Let\u2019s continue.Han Xiao pondered for a moment before he decided to raise the core skill [Snipe] to Lv.5, which increased his accuracy and sniping range.He had stolen the sniper rifle named Red-Falcon from the Hesla army logistics team. The rifle was black and only a gray-grade weapon. It had mediocre quality. He soon started upgrading the weapon.Han Xiao focused on increasing the power of the sniper rifle during this series of upgrades. The damage was increased to 92 ~ 103; the rate of fire was two rounds per second; the range was 600 meters. But with [Machinery Affinity] and [Sniping], his range could reach up to 750 meters, which was sufficient for his use.Han Xiao was still left with tens of thousands of EXP, but he decided to hold onto it first. He started the production of the three bullets that he had previously discovered\u2026Soon, batches of new bullets were produced.Fabian Company\u2019s private workshop was primarily adapted for making firearms and ammunition, which saved Han Xiao a fair bit of time for the whole production. This also reminded Han Xiao of something.Should I make some robot a.s.sistants to help me with the production of mechanical parts?He already had the blueprint for smart chips and other necessary parts for the robot. All he needed to do was upgrade his [Basic Programming] before he could produce a simple robot rover that could act as his a.s.sistant. However, since he did not have a fixed base for now, it was not appropriate for him to produce the robots yet.Antonio\u2019s footsteps were heard. Soon, he entered the workshop. He placed an intricately designed dark gold coin onto the table and said, \u201cThis is your members.h.i.+p pa.s.s.\u201dHan Xiao was delighted._____________________You have unlocked a new Camp Reputation!Blood Pact Society: Cold (0/300) \u2013 [Reserve-level a.s.sa.s.sin]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was owned by the Dark Net Organization, and it only permitted members of the organization to stay. The hotel would use the excuse of \u2018no available rooms\u2019 to deny normal people from staying in the place. While it acted as a safehouse for the members, it was also the transaction hall for people from different camps. No fighting was allowed in this place, and anyone who broke the rule would receive endless a.s.sa.s.sinations.After obtaining the pa.s.s, Han Xiao went to Hotel Victoria. It had a cla.s.sic interior, with various types of aged dark-brown wooden furniture, which had a beautiful l.u.s.ter. A sense of serenity was overflowing in every corner of the hotel.Han Xiao came forward to the front desk before revealing his Blood Pact Society coin. Then he was brought to the 23rd floor by a servant.23rd to 25th floors belonged to the Blood Pact Society. The 23rd floor was the resting and transaction areas for all the a.s.sa.s.sins\u2014they would get employed or paid here. The floor also had numerous entertainment facilities such as a bar, caf\u00e9, and restaurants.After he handed his dark golden coin to the receptionist on the 23rd floor, another server wearing a white glove came to receive Han Xiao. They sat down at a semi-private table in the corner. The server took out a notebook with black leather covers and started recording the personal information of this new member.\u201cWhat will your code name be?\u201dHan Xiao thought for a moment, and he decided to use an enchanting name, which might help his Universal Reputation in some ways.\u201cApostle-level Observer No. 9527 from the Crimson Dynasty stationed in Couton Group.\u201dThe server was stupefied.a.s.sa.s.sins usually had minimalist names like \u2018Silver Fox\u2019, \u2018Devil Snake\u2019, or \u2018Ghost\u2019, the kind that was more appreciated in the age when reduced attention spans were the norm. Such a \u2018unique\u2019 name would really intrigue employers, but it way too long.The server coughed. \u201cCan you shorten the name?\u201dWhat? I\u2019ve only ever heard of others complaining about short names. I didn\u2019t know people would dislike name for being too long.Han Xiao pondered for a while before he came up with another name. \u201cBlack.\u201dThe server was briefly rendered speechless.\u201cYour name is too short now. A single-world code name is permissible, but code names that are just colors have long been taken by other a.s.sa.s.sins. All the names like \u2018Red\u2019, \u2018Blue\u2019, \u2018Orange\u2019, and so on were mostly names of the honored a.s.sa.s.sins of the previous generation who have pa.s.sed away. The organization will not allow someone else to reuse their code names.\u201dHan Xiao smacked his lips in irritation. It seemed him to him that naming was a troublesome affair anywhere he went. He then came up with the final name. \u201cMr. Black.\u201d\u201cMr. Black\u2026 Alright.\u201dThis name was much more ordinary. The server quickly recorded it.\u201cYou are now a Reserve-level a.s.sa.s.sin with a blank resume. You can only rise to Scorpion-level upon the completion of your first a.s.signment. Employers will usually pick from our whole list of a.s.sa.s.sins. If someone chooses you, we will contact you. Until then, you can take up a.s.signments that are open to everybody on the market or a.s.sa.s.sinate wanted personnel.\u201cOf course, you can also accept private jobs. We do not have any hard requirements for our a.s.sa.s.sins, but we will take five percent of the reward as our commission. If you have any questions in the future, you can always call up our reception at Hotel Victoria.\u201cSounds reasonable.\u201d Han Xiao nodded his head.There were two reasons for him joining the Blood Pact Society. First, he wanted to take on all the wanted personnel that warranted high bounties, and these missions would trigger high-reward quests. Secondly, he could earn some Universal Reputation by becoming one of the top ten ranked a.s.sa.s.sins on the Dark Net.There were only three months till the open beta. He needed to acc.u.mulate a large base of resources using the remaining time he had.\u201cAll of these are \u2018wanted\u2019 a.s.signments.\u201dThe servant took out a tablet and opened a page on the Dark Net before pa.s.sing it to Han Xiao.Han Xiao instantly saw the most popular personnel on the list\u2014himself.\u201cZero. Five Million Dollars Reward. Dead or Alive. Location: West Capital, Stardragon. All the best.\u201dIf he had returned to the West Capital, his movements would have been heavily restrained. Fortunately, he had escaped early. Han Xiao sn.i.g.g.e.red. It would take a long time for the Germinal Organization to realize their efforts were all in vain.He was the most popular target on the wanted list as the Germinal Organization had spent a lot of effort in chasing him down and hunting him recently, but he was not the most wanted. Some of the acc.u.mulated prices had even reached tens of millions\u2014they were mostly impossible a.s.signments such as stealing top-secret intelligence from a certain country. Based on the security and defense around Division 13\u2019s underground database, this mission\u2019s success rate could go as low as 0.001%, with the probability of death being 99.999%. This a.s.signment only looked good on the list; no one would really attempt to do it.Han Xiao scanned further down the list. He soon settled on a wanted a.s.signment.\u201cTake down the Rose Militant, a group of mercenaries active in the Somar Desert, in the Southern Land.\u201dThe Southern Land was where Hesla was located, and it was also called the South Continent. It had a vast land area and tropical climate. The other continents were the North Continent, West Continent, and the Andrea Continent, which located in the middle of the other three.Han Xiao picked this mission due its close proximity. Just as he was about to accept the a.s.signment, the server suddenly jolted and said, \u201cMr. Black, you have a new personal a.s.signment.\u201dHan Xiao was pleasantly surprised. He received an a.s.signment within five minutes of uploading his particulars onto the net.\u201cThis organization\u2019s business is really thriving,\u201d Han Xiao remarked sincerely.The server was puzzled himself. \u201cSuch happenings are actually quite rare.\u201d\u201cThe employer hopes to speak with you personally.\u201d The server looked at the screen and continued. \u201cTake a seat first. He will arrive in about ten minutes.\u201dHan Xiao complied.Ten minutes later, a middle-aged man walked in hastily. He had a head full of white hair, which made him look much older than his real age, and his expression was one of exasperation. He walked into the hall and looked left and right before he came forward to Han Xiao. \u201cI am Cheng Shan Shui.\u201dBefore an a.s.signment was officially accepted, the employer would not divulge the target\u2019s real name. a.s.sa.s.sins could only ask for other basic information. \u201cWhat will the bounty for this a.s.signment be? And tell me more about the target\u2019s protection and location.\u201d\u201c12 to 20 body guards. The location is right in this city. The remuneration will be $10,000.\u201d\u201cOnly $10,000?\u201d Han Xiao frowned slightly.That price was insufficient to employ an a.s.sa.s.sin.Cheng Shan Shui nodded anxiously. He had immediately been turned down by other a.s.sa.s.sins when they heard the price. He lacked enough money to pay for the usual price, so he had decided to try his luck on new a.s.sa.s.sins like Han Xiao.\u201cI will take it,\u201d Han Xiao agreed.Cheng Shan Shui cheered inwardly. He took out a stack of doc.u.ments and pa.s.sed them to Han Xiao. \u201cYue You Zu, located right in Morning Wing City.\u201dYue You Zu was a mafioso in Hesla who was always accompanied by 12 to 16 bodyguards that were made up of retired army reconnaissance soldiers. Recently, he had expanded his influence into the territory of Morning Wind City, which belonged to the local mafia head, Cheng Shan Shui. He could not guard against Yue You Zu\u2019s invasion, and so his mafia gang had disbanded. He was now left all alone and wanted to hire a.s.sa.s.sin to avenge him.Han Xiao signed the contract after he finished reading the information._____________________You have triggered an E-level Quest [a.s.sa.s.sination a.s.signment (Cheng Shan Shui).\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304Han Xiao already knew the quest requirement. He went on to look at the reward of the quest, and it was not much, only 5,000 EXP.\u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d Han Xiao stood up and prepared to leave.Cheng Shan Shui quickly stopped Han Xiao from going and asked, \u201cHow long will you need to finish this job?\u201dHan Xiao paused. He looked out the window and saw that it just reached noon. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you haven\u2019t had lunch, right?\u201dCheng Shan Shui was startled, not understanding what Han Xiao was trying to say.Han Xiao turned his head and gave him an aloof look. \u201cHe will be gone by the time you finish your lunch.\u201dCheng Shan Shui\u2019s heart skipped a beat.Based on his impression, a.s.sa.s.sins would normally do some pre-a.s.signment preparations, such as reconnaissance and escape route planning.Was this Mr. Black really that powerful, or was he just being arrogant?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He raised his head and saw that it was the man, code-named Lawson, who had previously turned down his a.s.signment. He was a Scorpion-level a.s.sa.s.sin.\u201cOh. It\u2019s you. How are you doing?\u201d\u201cI have some free time for now. I can take your a.s.signment,\u201d Lawson said coolly.Cheng Shan Shui\u2019s eyes glimmered for a moment before they became gloomy again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. My a.s.signment has already been accepted by someone else.\u201dCheng Shan Shui gave a bitter smile.The Blood Pact Society\u2019s rule dictated that once a contract had been established, no one could alter it.Lawson was slightly disappointed upon hearing his words.He had come all the way from Red Maple to visit a friend in Hesla, and he was taking the opportunity to travel around Hesla, so he had no intention of doing any a.s.signment on this trip. When Cheng Shan Shui approached him with his a.s.signment, he had given an outright rejection because the reward for the mission was too low.But now, Lawson was feeling bored from the idling the past few days. Thus, he wanted to do some simple a.s.signments, and he had planned to take up Cheng Shan Shui\u2019s mission. He was surprised that someone else had already accepted the a.s.signment in just one day.Lawson was annoyed at the situation, but he knew that he could not break the society\u2019s rule. He had no choice but to give up on this. He then walked toward the bar and ordered a drink.After taking two sips from his drink, his phone suddenly rang. He looked at the incoming call\u2014it was from an old client of his, Yue You Zu.\u201cHey, Lawson.\u201d A man\u2019s voice was heard on the phone.\u201cYes, it\u2019s me. How can I help you, Mr. Yue?\u201d Lawson said nonchalantly.\u201cI have a job that I hope you can help with.\u201d\u201cTell me more about it.\u201d Lawson\u2019s eyes suddenly turned sharp.\u201cI want you to help me get rid of someone.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cI have sent the details to you.\u201dThe rule of confidentiality did not apply here since it was a private job.Lawson took out his tablet and looked over the information. He then raised his head suddenly and looked at Cheng Shan Shui \u2013 he was the target!\u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d Yue You Zu asked. A group of people could be heard going down the stairs from the phone.\u201cI will take it,\u201d Lawson replied confidently.\u201cGreat. I will ask my guy to transfer the deposit to\u2026\u201dBoom!Suddenly, the sound of someone dropping onto the floor was heard through the phone. A gunshot was heard from a distance, and Lawson\u2019s body stiffened. He recognized the sound\u2014it was a gunshot from a sniper rile. Soon after, he heard people shouting and screaming in panic. He did not bother to speak as he knew Yue You Zu had just been killed by someone.\u201cThis sniper killed the target, who was surrounded by a dozen bodyguards, with just one shot. He\u2019s a fine sniper.\u201d Lawson\u2019s face tensed up as he immediately deduced the whole sequence of events\u2014Cheng Shan Shui\u2019s a.s.signment was to kill Yue You Zu. After all, they were enemies.Cheng Shan Shui must be waiting for the sniper. Let me see who the a.s.sa.s.sin is. Lawson\u2019s eyes flashed.\u2026Using the information provided by Cheng Shan Shui, Han Xiao stationed himself on top of a high-rise building a few hundred meters away from Yue You Zu\u2019s base in advance. He aimed his sniper from a high vantage point and wanted to snipe Yue You Zu through the window. However, Yue You Zu walked out of the main gate, which made Han Xiao\u2019s job much easier.Even though he was surrounded tightly by a dozen bodyguards, they were no use in defending Han Xiao\u2019s shot.His newly-produced [Spindle-Shaped Penetration Bullet] was strong enough to penetrate any non-metal object easily. The bullet pierced through a bodyguard\u2019s body and with no sign of slowing down, it went right into Yue You Zu\u2019s heart.One shot one kill.a.s.sa.s.sinating a regular person was too simple for Han Xiao. He finished the job without any hiccups.Han Xiao\u2019s Facial Simulator was an extremely useful tool for an escape. He changed his look and ran away easily before the commotion attracted the police.\u2026..As soon as Han Xiao was back in Hotel Victoria, the troubled Cheng Shan Shui stood up with a look of anxiousness.\u201cThe job is done.\u201dCheng Shan Shui\u2019s body loosened up instantly. He subconsciously looked at his watch, and he realized that Han Xiao had only spent forty-five minutes between leaving this place and coming back, which meant he had taken less than ten mins for the actual a.s.sa.s.sination after subtracting the travelling time.That was too fast!\u201cIt\u2019s for you to pay me.\u201d\u201cYep. Okay. Okay.\u201d Cheng Shan Shui was in reverence. He took out a suitcase containing $10,000 and handed it to Han Xiao._____________________[a.s.sa.s.sination a.s.signment (Cheng Shan Shui)] completed.

Suddenly, he was aware of something, and he turned around.\u201cSomeone is watching me?\u201dA man, sitting at the bar, looked at him as if he was sizing him up. Han Xiao did not recognize him, but the man clearly showed a hint of provocation.Han Xiao narrowed his eyes, not afraid at all, but he did not want anyone to give casual provoking looks at him. He gathered his power and threw a freezing stare toward the man to send a universal message.What are you looking at!Lawson\u2019s whole body turned rigid as if he was being locked onto by a menacing sense of hostility. The feeling of danger was. .h.i.tting his mind in waves. He hurriedly moved his eye sight away from Han Xiao, and the ill feeling finally disappeared.In just a few short seconds, Lawson\u2019s forehead had become covered in cold sweat.What a terrifying feeling. I should never provoke this guy again!Lawson quickly gave up on his previous scheming thoughts and left hastily after paying the bill, refusing to stay a moment longer.\u2026.\u201cWe meet again.\u201dHan Xiao smiled gently at the servant.It was the first time the servant had encountered a newbie who ranked up to an official member of the Society so quickly. He was left in wonder. \u201cNow you are officially a Scorpion-level a.s.sa.s.sin. Higher tiers of benefits will be available to you. Additionally, you will receive primary VIP benefits in Hotel Victoria in other cities.\u201d\u201cWhat is my current ranking on the Dark Net a.s.sa.s.sin\u2019s ranking list?\u201d Han Xiao suddenly asked.The servant was dumbfounded by question. \u201cOnly the top-ranking a.s.sa.s.sins will appear on the list. You are at least more than a thousand over rankings away.\u201dAfter speaking, he took out his tablet and opened the ranking list for Han Xiao to see.Han Xiao quietly nodded after scanning through the list. Right now, the top ten a.s.sa.s.sins were on average at level forty. They were not of top-notch capability. Only the top three a.s.sa.s.sins were more terrifying as their powers were near the upper-limit of Version 1.0. This ranking list was determined by the number of completed a.s.signments and other related achievements. \u2018Real\u2019 players could only get on the ranking list by competing missions. The same rule applied for the ranking list of hired mercenaries.Planet Aquamarine did not have many powerful Superhumans. Before the open beta, players could hardly meet any Superhumans above level forty. Furthermore, those powerful individuals who were level fifty to sixty had the highest combat powers on this planet. They were generally leaders of large organizations, secret weapons, recluses, or super criminals and formed their own social circles. Thus, they were hardly present before the normal people and players.Players would only meet them through missions or by getting more powerful themselves.After these thoughts flashed through Han Xiao\u2019s mind, he opened the wanted list and pointed at one of the a.s.signment. \u201cI want to take the a.s.signment to eliminate the Rose Militant.\u201d\u201cAlright. Your request is now being process. Please give us a few moments.\u201dThe servant wrote down the request on some paper before placing it in a specially-made metal tube. He went forward to the reception desk and stuck the tube into a metal pipeline, which fitted the metal tube perfectly.Swoosh.The tube was sucked into the pipeline.The tube travelled rapidly through the pipeline, bypa.s.sing numerous openings and other similar tubes, before coming to its new exit.It was a s.p.a.cious room decorated like a customer service room. Rows of tables were lined up neatly with a few computers on top of them. The administrative staff were busying processing the doc.u.ments on their computers, and every table was connected to the pipeline.An administrative worker dressed in an all-black suit took out the paper from the metal tube and started typing furiously on the keyboard to upload the information.\u201cWanted Target: The Rose Militant (Mercenary)\u201cRequirement: Complete Annihilation\u201cInitiator: Rothschild Family\u201cLocation: Somar Desert\u201cInitiated Date: Year 685, 17 November\u201cWanted Amount: $3,000,000\u201cDifficulty a.s.sessment: Hard\u201ca.s.signment Record:\u2013 685.11.27, Code name \u2013 Hall (Dark-level) [Killed in action]\u2013 685.12.11, Code name \u2013 b.l.o.o.d.y Hand (Dark-level) [Killed in action]\u2013 685.3.10, Code name \u2013 Magic Flower (Dark-level), Freeman (Dark-level) [Killed in action]\u201d\u2026\u201ca.s.signment Info Update: The strength of the militia is currently between 80 to 120 people, including four superhumans, leader Luo (Esper), instructor Dorothy (Pugilist), instructor Ghostly Fox (Pugilist), and unknown (suspected to be a Mechanic).

They were in a base camp of the Fabian company.Antonio was slightly shocked.\u201cWe only use the military cargo plane for large scale transactions. Even if you are a Black-Gold VIP, you are still required to pay the stipulated charges,\u201d Antonio stuttered.\u201cOk, got it.\u201d\u201cWell, how many guys you want to transport. When will they leave?\u201d\u201cJust myself. I\u2019m leaving immediately.\u201dAntonio\u2019s chubby face was shaking like waves of water. He paused for quite a while and eventually said, \u201cWhat a waste.\u201dThe military cargo plane was able to reach the destination in around a day\u2019s time. There was a simple garage available on the plane, and Han Xiao was able to create new machinery and gain experience during the trip on the plane.\u201cA trip by the plane cost $50,000. Are you serious?\u201d\u201cWhen can I board the plane?\u201d Han Xiao took out a large stash of cash from his briefcase that contained a hundred thousand dollars.\u201cOne hour.\u201dThe Fabian Organization rented a stretch of runway at the Morning Wind City\u2019s airport. There were a couple of large olive-green cargo planes parked. Han Xiao brought along all his gear and materials and boarded one of the planes. Soon, he could sense the vibrations. The plane started to accelerate and took off into the clouds.Once the plane regained its stability in the skies after the take-off, Han Xiao was able to start his creations.\u2026The glaring sun was s.h.i.+ning brightly on the endless desert. The yellow sand was heated to a temperature unbearable for the human body.A group of twenty was trudging through the desert.They were clad in torn and tattered gray robes. Their robes had not been cleaned for G.o.d knew how long. Their robes were drenched in sweat, releasing a disgusting stench, and they stuck to their wet bodies. They lips were cracking, and their eyes draped down. Their fatigue was evident from the look on their faces. They were moving shakily, and it was as if they were going to collapse at any moment. The horses that they brought along also looked sick and skinny.The Somar desert had once had an oasis. The country was rich, and its citizens lived happily. But after a war, the entire country had perished. The oasis had been destroyed by the battles and blended into the surrounding desert. The people walking in desert were the citizens of the country that had vanished.A legend of the old nation said that ruins of over a million years old were hidden deep in the Somar desert. Beneath the ruins, there was a hidden treasure that held the power to control the entire desert!In the wars that happened decades ago, the desert had undergone a series of abnormal changes. The sand behaved like water and transformed into a whirlpool. The whirlpool moved around the desert as if it was being controlled by someone. The whirlpool then vanished after seven days. The records of the eerie incident disappeared with the destruction of the country. Many citizens of the old nation believed that the treasure could revive their country, and they searched long and hard for it.The Wanderers active along the border of the Somar desert were also known also as the pilgrims.That group of twenty was the last batch of pilgrims.\u201cThe ruins of Felonia, the power of the magic, they are sure to exist,\u201d the eldest of the pilgrims mumbled to himself.\u2026A fleet of vehicles returned to the desert to defend the boundaries.\u201cDorothy! Nothing again this trip?\u201d Luo Qing, the chief of the Rose Militants, questioned.\u201cThis time, we searched in sectors E4, E5, and D4. There are still no signs of Felonia,\u201d Dorothy replied with frustration. She was a strong black lady. Her face was disfigured by a long scar that looked like a centipede. Her strong muscular arms had tattoos that were hard to see due to her dark complexion.Rose Militant was a mercenary organization made up entirely of female members. They were active in the Somar desert and had been searching for Felonia for years.There were two trainers in the organization. The other trainer, nicknamed Ghostly Fox, was a pet.i.te white lady and a brilliant a.s.sa.s.sin.\u201cIn this search, our members came into contact with the Coutonians. Wen Li and Cecil died in battle.\u201dAll the returning members of the militia suffered from injuries. Their bulletproof vests had many holes, and the ceramic tiles housed in the vests were also shattered.Luo Qing gave a cold glance and said, \u201cBe more careful in the next search. The Coutonians are funded by the Rothschild family, who have always wanted to wipe us out.\u201dAll the military groups active in the Somar desert had their sponsors. They all had the mission of finding Felonia. Therefore, battles between the different groups were very common. Most mercenary soldiers had at least ten lives on their hands. They were all ruthless individuals.\u2026Han Xiao felt a shake in the plane. The huge force pressed his body hard on the seat. Gradually, that force pus.h.i.+ng him disappeared.\u201cThe plane has landed,\u201d the pilot shouted through the speakers.Han Xiao brought his briefcase down, and he could feel a wave of heat once he alighted from the plane.The landing site was a warehouse surround by barbed wire. There were many militias patrolling the area. It was the branch of the Fabian organization in the Somar desert. The Fabian organization was a global arms-dealing organization that had branches everywhere for more convenient business dealings.\u201cWelcome to Somar desert.\u201d Antonio descended from the plane. His white s.h.i.+rt was stretched tightly by his fat body. The chunk of meat could be seen clearly as if he was topless.\u201cWhy did you follow?\u201d\u201cHaha, the chief in charge of the Somar branch was killed in a recent battle. Therefore, I am here to take care of some administrative matters. Also, it has been a long while since I travelled.\u201dHan Xiao nodded. He was not shy at all and asked, \u201cI need a map indicating the different military groups that are active. Also, can you lend me a desert jeep?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll get someone to make the arrangements.\u201dSomar desert spanned a large area. Even if he drove the jeep continuously without sleeping and followed the correct route, he would need at least ten day to travel across the desert. Since it was hard to navigate through a desert, a radar was definitely required to accurately tell the direction. Furthermore, there were many military groups active in the region.Han Xiao felt confused as he could not understand what the different groups of forces were fighting for in the barren terrain.\u201cTo find Felonia.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Han Xiao was very curious. He did not have any recollection about that word. It was probably a hidden mission that had not been activated in his past life.Antonio yawned. \u201cI am equally clueless.\u201dHan Xiao realized that Antonio was trying to hide something from him. He raised his brows, collected his gear, and walked toward to jeep without saying another word. He was ready to check out the active areas of Rose Militant.\u201cBon voyage.\u201d Antonio waved lazily at Han Xiao to bid farewell.Han Xiao drove the jeep into the desert through an opening in the barbed wires.\u2026Through the information on the radar, Han Xiao managed to reach a location, quite a distance away from the area occupied by Rose Militant, where he could observe the activities of the member of the organization using a telescope.The campsite of Rose Militant was heavily guarded. It had concrete walls and barbed wire on the walls. The metal gate was the sole entrance and exit to the base.Within the base, there was a tall sentry post. The sentry guard on the post observed the surroundings while the sentry post was also equipped with a huge search light that would be switched on at night.Han Xiao came to a conclusion\u2014unless he could burrow into the sand and dig a tunnel into the base, it was almost impossible for him to infiltrate the base.Furthermore, Rose Militant consisted only of women. They had big b.r.e.a.s.t.s and perky a.s.ses. Han Xiao had a perky a.s.s, but he could not squeeze out any b.r.e.a.s.t.s. Even if he could disguise himself as a woman, it was highly likely that he would be discovered.The infiltration was bound to fail.Han Xiao glanced at the weapons on the sentry post. There were several grenade launchers and dozens of heavy machine guns in addition to the tough concrete walls encircling the base.An a.s.sault of the base was also bound to fail.It seems like the only way to achieve success for the mission is to lure the snake out. I need to employ traps in my upcoming battles. I need to create some new items, Han Xiao thought to himself as he left.He started his journey back to the Somar headquarters of the Fabian company. He wanted to ask Antonio if he could use the garage.There were still seven remaining potential points. He raised [Basic Electromagnetism] to level four and [Basic Spatial Sensing] to level three, using a total of four points._____________________Do you wish to proceed with talent fusion?(Lv. 4 Basic Electromagnetism + Lv. 3 Basic Energy Theory + Lv. 3 Basic Spatial Sensing)This fusion will cost you 15,000 EXP!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The product from the fusion was not what he had antic.i.p.ated. However, the visor was of great use to a sniper since it offered greater accuracy compared to using the thermo-scope. The new visor enabled vision through the internal compartment of concrete walls. If it was mounted onto the scope, it would allow for more accurate shots through the concrete walls at the stipulated target.Let me try it again._____________________\u2026This fusion will cost you 30,000 EXP!_____________________FusionSuccess!Congratulations, you have discovered [Electromagnetic Pulse Interference Machine]!\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304That\u2019s the one. Han Xiao nodded.The EMP Interference Machine was a common blueprint. It was very likely to appear, and other than the EMP Interference Machine, there were a couple of other machinery blueprints that could meet his expectations. In fact, he had actually set aside sufficient EXP for a third fusion. However, he was no longer required to use the additional EXP and could save it for future tasks.The powers of the EMP Interference Machine were known far and wide.There was no shortage of vehicles available in the desert. However, since Han Xiao was a sniper, maintaining the distance between the target was of the utmost importance, and he needed to have some distractions for vehicles if they approached.He was still short of some highly destructive explosives, mines, and traps.He touched his chin, and his eyes suddenly lit up. He had a new idea.I guess I can try creating the items and skip the fusion process!Previously, the players could hardly utilize self-creation skills. However, they were able to absorb the knowledge from the other blueprints and fuse their knowledge and the information from the other blueprints together to create new ones. They were able use their knowledge gained to add on to the details of their concepts. Through self-creation, they were able to skip the arduous research and development process of the new machinery, and they could even create powerful new machinery ahead of the expected progression.The core concept behind the highly explosive rounds was flammable gas. By compressing flammable gas into a container, its power would be escalated to an extent that was no lesser than the Mines of Shattering Shards.Since he needed to create an explosive mine, he needed additional gunpowder and ball bearings. He started to consider the use of flammable gas.He decided to split the explosive round into different sections. The flammable gas became less reactive upon coming into contact with the atmospheric gases, and they were sealed up. There was a switch in the round that also acted as a timer. Once the time was up, the switch would click, and as the flammable gases came into contact with the gunpowder, an explosion would be triggered.Since he was going to utilize his prototyping skills, Han Xiao felt that it was a good opportunity to increase the power of his product by equipping it with additional effects. Therefore, he decided to incorporate the theory behind the Hayme bullet into his new creation.Han Xiao quickly finalized the blueprint in his mind and started crafting the new equipment with his hands. A prototype was required to be tested in order to determine whether the new creation was a success or not. Most players employed the creation process\u2014they merely set the blueprint and selected the materials and tools required. They did not partic.i.p.ate in the manufacturing process, and the success of the creation depended a lot on luck.However, Han Xiao was involved in every phase of the production process, including the hands-on manufacturing. Hence, he was able to fine tune the steps in each stage of the production, and that greatly increased the success rate of his creation.After a while, a circular mine with a thirty-millimeter diameter emerged from Han Xiao\u2019s production. He operated the interface and did an automatic scan to determine if his creation was successful._____________________Scanning to determine success of product\u2026Failure!\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304It failed? Han Xiao raised his brows and frowned.The reason behind the failure had to be due to the fact that the mechanical components were unable to attain the projected effects, or there were some obvious loopholes.He found a spot to test out the power of his new creation, and he discovered that the ignition process involving the highly flammable gas, gunpowder, and the poisonous gas was awry. Although an explosion still took place, the damage caused was far below what was projected, and modifications were required.The gases were very hard to control. A slight mistake meant that the entire process had to be repeated and modifications of the mechanical parts had to be made. The weapons-testing area of the Fabian Organization\u2019s camp was completed charred, and venomous gases were everywhere. Han Xiao had to vacate the ground, else he would suffer continuous deductions of his HP.Finally, after thirteen failures, an angelic line emerged on the interface._____________________Success!You have successfully created a new prototype blueprint!\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304A new explosive\u2019s blueprint emerged in his mind, and the interface recorded all the theories behind the machinery. After witnessing the effects of this new weapon, Han Xiao whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s too conventional to call the explosive the Highly-Flammable, Poisonous, Delayed-Explosion Mine. I shall call the mine \u2018Flaming Poison\u2019.\u201d_____________________The naming is successful.You have gained the blueprint of the new creation [Flaming Poison Mine]!\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304After the newly-created blueprint was recognized by the interface, the usage of the explosive became a skill, and EXP could be utilized to increase the level of the explosive. Furthermore, the various requirements to create the explosive were also recorded on the interface, and by referring to the interface during the creation process, the manufacturing of the explosive could take place at a faster rate.Han Xiao\u2019s eyes lit up brightly. Indeed, just as I expected, the self-creation blueprints can meet my needs for adaptable weapons during battle situations, and there is a huge potential in this area that has yet to be unraveled.The next step will be to create a sufficient inventory of explosives.\u2026Night soon fell.Han Xiao drove his jeep into an empty and s.p.a.cious sector. He then arranged rows of fireworks on the ground and put them on delayed ignition. After that, he prepared the Flaming Venoms and EMP Interference Machine along the path that Rose Militant had to take in order to reach the specified sector.How did Han Xiao predict the route that Rose Militant would take?It was based on the shortest distance between the two points.Obviously, one could not eliminate the possibility that the enemy would take a longer path instead of the predicted one. However, it was not much of a worry as there was always another opportunity to ambush the enemy.The EMP Interference Machine was a circular piece of equipment with a base. Han Xiao had created a portable version with a height of merely one meter and a radiation radius of 300 meters that released high frequency wave signals. The machine could interfere with the abilities of other precision electronics such as communication devices, remotely-controlled electronics, and search radars. It was especially effective against vehicles and could paralyze their communications, signal receptors, controllers, and even their movements.Although Han Xiao did not expect the vehicles operated by the Rose Militants to be equipped with anti-interference machines, he adjusted the interference machinery to a frequency that had the highest likelihood for success. As long as there was a slight opening in the vehicle that was not equipped with anti-interference metal, the vehicle would succ.u.mb to the effects of the interference.The drawback of such a method was that it was very draining on the battery of the machine. However, it was not much of an issue as the machine was not required to release constant interference. As long as there was one successful penetration, the vehicle would be paralyzed.After setting up the trap, Han Xiao parked his jeep at a sand dune that was around four hundred meters away from the ambush. He then silently lay p.r.o.ne on ground and looked through his scope like a patient hunter waiting for his kill.At night, the temperature of the desert plunged, and the cold gusts of wind blew the sand into the air. Han Xiao was wearing a windbreaker and had thick leather gloves on his hands to prevent the freezing cold from immobilizing his hands and thus his accuracy.Boom!The fireworks shot up into the sky in the marked-out sector. The fireworks were especially glaring in the dark of the night. They could be seen clearly from even tens of kilometers away.\u2026\u201cThere\u2019s a problem!\u201dIn the base of the Rose Militants, the sentry guards saw the booming fireworks in the sky and immediately reported the situation to Luo Qing.\u201cDorothy, take your troops and check out the situations. Be careful of the other militias around and request for reinforcements immediately if you guys engage enemies,\u201d Luo Qing quickly ordered.Dorothy nodded. She selected twenty troops. They suited up, equipping themselves with a plethora of magazine cartridges and grenades. They then rode out in four desert jeeps.In the Coutonian base-camp, Couton, who was the chief, also saw the fireworks and ordered his men, \u201cBring your troops and check out the situation. A fight is likely to take place.\u201dA couple of the armed jeeps drove out of the Couton base-camp into the wild.The same scene also played out in a couple of other militant-camps.\u2026The jeeps of Rose Militant were speeding through the desert. The rotating tires threw the sand into the air, and a long \u2018dragon\u2019 of dust trailed behind the vehicles.\u201cDorothy, is this the appearance of Felonia?\u201d a female trooper asked Dorothy.Dorothy had a ferocious look. When she squeezed her lips, she looked like a black tigress that devoured anything in her way. She replied coldly, \u201cIf Felonia could be discovered so easily, I wouldn\u2019t have wasted two years here. This is probably some smokescreen created by others. Everyone, stay on high alert. This is probably another trap the Coutonians planted!\u201dHum\u2013\u2013Once Dorothy\u2019s sentence ended, an eerie sound of electricity could be heard in the air. Dorothy and five other troops could sense that there was a special wave that originated from somewhere not far away.Simultaneously, all the meters on the cars cracked, and the four Jeeps instantly lost control and collided into one another like drunkards. No matter how much the drivers stepped on the pedals, the jeeps were still out of their control.\u201cEnemy ambus.h.!.+\u201d Dorothy was shocked and started to scan the surroundings alertly.What was the cause of the paralysis of the vehicles? Could it have been an EMP\u203dThe troops searched around, and they could only see the yellowish sand in the darkness. There was nothing strange.The desert was s.p.a.cious, and stars of the galaxy could also be seen in the night sky. The cold wind of the night howled.The troops could feel the gooseb.u.mps on their arms. It was as if they were being choked by a gigantic hand and could hardly breathe.Boom!A Rose Militant was flung into the air by a large shockwave and landed hard onto the sand. She no longer had any breath, and there was a b.l.o.o.d.y hole in her body that looked ghastly.\u201cThere\u2019s a sniper. Hide behind the vehicle!\u201d Dorothy was shocked and angry. She immediately gathered her teammates to move behind the vehicle and requested for reinforcements by shooting the flare into the air.Rose Militant felt a small sense of security as their base was relatively close to their current position. Within fifteen minutes, their reinforcements would arrive!Han Xiao, who was lying p.r.o.ne on the sand, saw the flare and muttered to himself, \u201cThis arrow into the clouds will bring tens of thousands of enemy troops.\u201dHe then changed to the highly flammable magazine and fired a shot at the trap lined with the Flaming Poison Mines. Fire started burning at the point the bullet landed and ignited the Faming Poison Mines.Boom!After a thunderous sound, a sea of flames emerged, and it resulted in a chain reaction that lit up the other mines, causing continuous explosions!The merciless flames swallowed four jeeps, and the poisonous gas was released everywhere. The damage to the enemies caused by the poison and burns appeared on the interface.The Hayme Bullet was a poisonous bullet also known as \u2018The Bullet of Justice\u2019. The effect of the damage was much greater when the theory behind the Hayme Bullet was applied to the Flaming Poison Mines.Coughs were heard everywhere. Dorothy felt nauseous, and her teammates looked as if they were suffering worse. Their heads were spinning, and they were vomiting uncontrollably.If all of them continued to remain at their current position, they were bound to die from either the flames or the poisonous gas.What a sly b.a.s.t.a.r.d! Dorothy tired hard to overcome the nauseating sensation in her chest and yelled, \u201cCharge toward the sniper and kill him. That\u2019s the only way we can survive!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The venomous gas had infiltrated their bodies, and they were clearly poisoned. Only Dorothy, who had the physical attributes of a pugilist, was able to withstand the poison. She led the troops in the charge.Han Xiao calmly switched to the cartridge with the spindle-shaped penetration bullets. He fired the sniper, and the gunshots sounded as if they followed a steady tempo. Shot by shot, he wiped out the militants one by one. The bulletproof vests were unable to withstand the power of the penetration bullets. Coupled with Han Xiao\u2019s personal attribute, a shot fired by Han Xiao could deal a theoretical damage of around 130 damage points. Moreover, the normal troops ranged from level five to level eight. They possessed around 150 points of HP. Therefore, a single shot was enough to kill them with the damage dealt by the poison and flames. A second shot was not even needed to kill the troops. The efficiency of wiping out the enemy was especially high.Han Xiao deliberately made Dorothy the sole survivor of his attacks. Firstly, he killed all of Dorothy\u2019s a.s.sistants, and he was only left with the strongest of them all, Dorothy, to fight.After Han Xiao killed the last of the ordinary militants, Dorothy finally got close to him. She raised her modified machine gun and started firing hysterically at him.Han Xiao ducked, and the bullets struck the sand dunes, spraying sand into the air.Dorothy was running and firing her weapon ferociously at the same time. She finally came before Han Xiao after she exhausted the bullets of her magazine. She appeared to be brutal killer.The sniper was bound to be dead if a pugilist managed to get close to the sniper.Dorothy could not wait to smash Han Xiao\u2019s skull into pieces, just as she had done to a couple of her other enemies.\u201cHunting-tiger Axe!\u201dDorothy wielded her axe and slashed it at Han Xiao\u2019s head. The sound of the axe slicing the wind could be heard. She was confident that her strike was powerful enough to wreck Han Xiao\u2019s brain into pieces.Han Xiao dodged the strike and slide backward three steps like a mudskipper. Dorothy missed her strike.\u201cStrafe!\u201dLike a phantom, Han Xiao drew the Berserk Eagles from his waist. The continuous firing by Han Xiao instantly led to countless penetration bullets piercing Dorothy\u2019s body.Dorothy shrieked in pain. However, her eyes revealed a tinge of arrogance. She took out a shotgun from her back and fired at Han Xiao.\u201cShotgun bullets are the deadliest close range. It is a sure kill\u2014you\u2019re a dead man!\u201dDorothy expected Han Xiao to be dead, but the next moment astonished her.The scale-like armor covered Han Xiao upper body, and the bullets from the shotgun struck the hard surface of the armor, resulting in sparks. With his current skills, Han Xiao was able to create a magnetically-controlled retractable armor that covered his entire upper body.\u201cI have armor, you fool!\u201dHan Xiao then fired all the bullets in his magazine at Dorothy\u2019s body. A pugilist that reached Pan Kuang\u2019s level was able to withstand the penetration by the bullets only if he focused hard.Compared to Pan Kuang, Dorothy was much weaker, and it was impossible for her to withstand the penetration by the high-caliber bullets. Blood spurted out from her mouth, and her bloodshot eyes stared hard at Han Xiao. She was mumbling, as if she wanted to say something.Boom! Han Xiao blasted Dorothy\u2019s head with his pistol._____________________You killed Dorothy (Lv. 25).You gained 7,500 EXP.\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304In the earlier stages, snipers possessed strong long-range combat power, and they were able to conveniently strike their targets from afar. However, snipers were trained solely by the Union. This was because of the fact that it was too expensive to train snipers. Even the lousiest sniper would require at least $10,000 of investment. Sniper bullets were expensive; every shot fried was liked to money being used up.Furthermore, ordinary snipers did not possess the magnetically-controlled retractable armor; therefore, they were easily killed when their enemies moved up close to them.Han Xiao search Dorothy\u2019s body and discovered that her gun was modified. From the modifications, it seemed like Rose Militant had a skillful mechanic.After wiping out this group of enemies, Han Xiao had gained 10,000 EXP. The endless flames from the Flaming Poison Mines would soon attract more enemies.Han Xiao retrieved the EMP Interference Machine and returned to his jeep, quickly leaving the site.A while after Han Xiao left, a group of Couton troops arrive at the scene. They were shocked by the sight before their eyes.\u201cThey are from Rose Militant.\u201d\u201cWho ambushed them?\u201dThe Couton troops were just about to check out the scene when the reinforcements led by Luo Qing also arrived. They saw their comrades lying dead on the ground and the Couton troops standing over their bodies.\u201cFire!\u201dThe two groups had been in conflict for quite a while. Upon seeing their enemies, Rose Militant was instantly angered, and they started firing. Any form of explanation to prevent the fight was futile.Luo Qing ordered the attack without hesitation. The Couton troops retaliated upon realizing the situation they were about to face. Instantly, a fierce battle took place, and the gunshots and explosions lit up the night sky.Other militias also arrived at the scene. Upon seeing the ongoing battle between the Couton troops and the Rose Militants, they wanted a piece of the cake and joined in the fight. It turned into a complete chaos.Even more militias that had bases further away from the site arrived, and they joined in the fun and started stirring more chaos before even finding out the reason behind the fight.The fight went for almost half of the night. All the respective militias suffered damage. They retreated to their bases and started to count their losses. The last few militias that arrived at the scene did not even know why they had been fighting.The Rose Militants brought back twenty bodies of their dead comrades. These bodies had grievous wounds created by the bullets of a sniper.\u201cLooks like Dorothy and the others were not ambushed by the Coutonians. They were killed by a sniper,\u201d Ghostly Fox said.Luo Qing\u2019s face sank as she started thinking hard about the culprit behind the attack. Their enemies were all from the Somar Desert, and even if there was conflict, it was more likely to be a direct battle rather than an ambush. She immediately thought of the incident that had happened two years back. When the Rothschild family first put a bounty on their heads, many lone a.s.sa.s.sins had taken up the challenge and tried to kill them.\u201cAnother bounty-hunter?\u201d Luo Qing frowned. Rose Militant had not been approached by a.s.sa.s.sins for almost a year.Perhaps after a year, some rash youngster had forgotten about the painful lesson the Rose Militants had taught the a.s.sa.s.sins.Dorothy had suffered a painful death. She was murdered at a close range. This indicated that the sniper possessed some close-combat abilities.A pet.i.te woman approached. She was wearing an oil-stained coat and said, \u201cI found the killer\u2019s vehicle tacks. He headed toward the southeast. There are three distinct camps based there, and the nearest one belongs to the Fabian Organization.\u201d\u201cGood job, Su Li.\u201dSu Li was the mechanic of the Rose Militants, and she was in charge of maintaining and modifying the guns, vehicles, and defensive gear.\u201cI found some shards of the exploded mines at the site, and I presume the incident was a well-planned ambush. The outer sh.e.l.ls of the mine belonged to the Fabian Organization. It is highly likely that the killer is residing in the camp of the Fabian Organization. I tried to piece back the mine that was used, and it seems like a new type of explosive. The explosion involved the use of several gases.\u201dLuo Qing squinted. They had met a tough foe this time, but she was determined to take revenge. She made an encrypted phone call to their secret sponsor.\u201cMr. Sebastian, a team of twenty of our troops were hunted down by an unknown a.s.sa.s.sin.\u201dAn old raspy voice emerged from the other side of the line. \u201cI will send someone to handle it.\u201dEvery time an a.s.sa.s.sin emerged, the sponsor behind the Rose Militants would send out other \u2018Professional a.s.sa.s.sins\u2019 to punish the culprit. That was the reason Rose Militant had managed to wipe out so many a.s.sa.s.sins in the Somar Desert.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Three cold-looking men alighted from the helicopter. They seemed to possess an air of mystery that prevented others from wanting to go near them. Furthermore, they looked almost the same, like they were made from the same mold.Code 3, Code 5, and Code 9 were all the a.s.sa.s.sins trained in the same training camp.\u201cHow\u2019s the situation?\u201d Code 3, who was the captain of the team, asked directly.Luo Qing gave him a brief of the events that had occurred.Code 3 squinted and said, \u201cThe enemy is a sniper, and his ambush on your men was to scout on your abilities. He wanted to lure all of you out. The enemy possesses detailed information about you guys, and based on the latest information provided, the enemy is probably residing in the camp of the Fabian Organization. However, the Fabian Organization is not a party you want to mess with. We are unable to conduct a.s.sa.s.sinations in their territory.\u201d\u201cWhat are you guys planning to do then?\u201d Luo Qing asked.\u201cYou guys are the target of the killer. Therefore, we are going to use you as bait to lure him out. After that, the three of us will ambush him and secure the kill.\u201d\u201cGhostly Fox, you will be responsible for taking our teams out over the upcoming few days,\u201d Luo Qing ordered.Ghostly Fox nodded.\u2026In the Fabian Organization\u2019s campsite, Han Xiao was scratching the unshaven stubble on his chin in his room. He was still puzzled.It seems like Rose Militant can no longer fight as well as they did in the past\u2026The combat skills of Dorothy made him feel strange. If that was what Rose Militant was capable of, there was no reason the bounty had yet to be collected.Once again, the suspicion in Han Xiao was activated, and he felt like he was missing some critical information. He then went to find Antonio to clear his queries.Han Xiao knocked on the door of Antonio\u2019s office and looked into the room from the tiny available gap. Antonio was looking through files on his study table.\u201cWhat are you here for?\u201d Antonio laughed.Han Xiao sat in front of Antonio and faced him directly. Han Xiao then asked, \u201cI want to know more about the different militias active in the Somar Desert.\u201d\u201cI pa.s.sed you the report previously. You can find all strengths and territories of these militias on it.\u201d\u201cI want something not on the report.\u201d Han Xiao raised his brows and said, \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201dAntonio lit a cigar and laughed. \u201cI guess you realized it. All these militias are merely tools used by the rich families who act as their funders. They sponsor these militants to help them search for Felonia. If these backers are not wiped out, there will only be endless streams of militants pouring into the desert.\u201d\u201cThe troops of Couton are sponsored by the Rothschild family, who put up your bounty. Haha, don\u2019t be too surprised, the bounties for the Rose Militants are all public.\u201dHan Xiao was not surprised. If that was the case, in order for him to complete his mission, he had to wipe out all of Rose Militant, especially their chief, Luo Qing.Antonio took a puff and said calmly, \u201cRose Militant is funded by the Ordifina Organization. The organization controls various political lobbying groups. It also manages secret facilities to train mercenaries and a.s.sa.s.sins. It is headquartered in the Western Continent, which is relatively less powerful in the Southern Continent. However, it is definitely not a small organization to be trifled with.\u201dHan Xiao had a sudden realization. No wonder all the Dark Net a.s.sa.s.sins sent to kill the militants did not return. Rose Militant had a powerful supporter that provided them with reinforcements.\u201cWhat\u2019s so special about Felonia? How can it draw the attention of so many different forces?\u201d Han Xiao felt that the mystery of Felonia had something to do with the rewards of his a.s.sa.s.sination mission.Since a large number of reinforcements was expected to arrive, Han Xiao had to plan out his next steps carefully.At first, Han Xiao had two ideas in mind. The first was to wait for the target to arrive at his doorstep, and the second was to lure the enemies out of their camp. Both methods required Rose Militant to leave their base. The reinforcements sent by the enemies were bound work out the tactics he was going to employ. Therefore, it was highly likely that they had ordered the Rose Militants to move out of their base to lure Han Xiao out and eventually ambush him.What shall I do? Perhaps take an unexpected path?Han Xiao ma.s.saged his temples as he contemplated his options. What if he set up a trap somewhere then acted as if he did not know about the enemy ambush? Once contacted, Han Xiao would lure the enemies into his trap and turn the situation around to his advantage.I will need more weapons.\u2026Ghostly Fox took her team out for their third patrol. They were wandering aimlessly in the desert. She felt a tinge of frustration and asked through the communication line, \u201cWhy is the a.s.sa.s.sin not appearing? Is he afraid or what?\u201dFrom the other side of the line, Code 3 replied, \u201ca.s.sa.s.sins are meticulous individuals. The successful ambush means that he will wait to observe your movements before making the next move.\u201d\u2026It was night again. Recently, Han Xiao had often been busy at night.He hauled the new equipment that he had created into the jeep before he drove out of the camp to the site where he would set up his tap.The jeep moved out of the gates of the camp. The light emitted by the jeep dimmed as the vehicle moved deeper into the desert.\u2026At the same time, there was a telescope that could be seen far away from the scene.On the sand dune a kilometer away, Code 9, who was clad in yellow cloth, was observing the movement of the jeep with his telescope. He broke into a cold grin.\u201cThe target has left the camp. He is heading north. I suppose he wants to set up his trap. He has probably discovered our existence and wants to employ reverse psychology to lure us into his trap instead.\u201dSince they knew that Han Xiao was hiding in Fabian Organization\u2019s camp, they were naturally spying on him.\u201cThe enemy is pretty amateur.\u201d Code 3 looked confident. He expected the upcoming mission to be an easy one since everything was under their control.\u2026At dawn, Han Xiao back to the base and went to look for Antonio.\u201cYou want me to help you drive?\u201d Antonio looked shocked.\u201cYes, I need you to drive since my hands will be tied up with firing the shots.\u201d\u201cWait\u2026 This is your mission; how does it concern me? Why must I help you?\u201d Antonio was puzzled.\u201cIt is rare for you venture out, so how can you just stay here and do nothing? Come out with me and experience the beauty of nature.\u201dAntonio pointed to the barren desert and asked, \u201cWhat nature is there to see here?\u201d\u201cThis is all just on the surface. Maybe we will see a magnificent mirage? Maybe there will be hidden mountains and rivers? The desert is very big; I am sure these sights can be discovered if you explore the area with a devout heart.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think we are close enough to travel together,\u201d Antonio replied in an awkward manner.\u201cThen give me a chance to be friends with you.\u201d Han Xiao laughed out loud.\u201c\u2026 Did anyone ever tell you that you are very thick-skinned?\u201dHan Xiao touched his face mask. He was obviously thick-skinned. His mask alone was two layers thick.Although Antonio looked obese, Han Xiao could sense the immense combat power that he possessed. Han Xiao had selected Antonio to be his driver as he knew that Antonio would be unlikely to commit any screw-ups or die so easily.If it was an ordinary driver, the driver would die almost instantly upon contact with the enemy, and he would be left to fend for himself.Antonio thought for a moment and said, \u201cIf you want me to partic.i.p.ate in the mission, I want a share of your earnings.\u201d\u201cHow about five percent?\u201d\u201cNo way! That\u2019s too little.\u201d Antonio shook his head.\u201cDon\u2019t argue with me. You are just going with me to drive the vehicle. Five percent is already a generous offer.\u201d\u201cIf we meet any enemies, the driver will surely be the first target. At least twenty percent.\u201dHan Xiao widened his eyes in disbelief. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just go and rob someone?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s precisely what I\u2019m doing now.\u201d There was a hint of cheekiness in Antonio\u2019s tiny eyes.After arguing for quite some time, Han Xiao finally decided to appease Antonio with $20,000. Paying Antonio with hard cash was more reliable that just making a verbal contract. The collaboration between the two became an employment contract. $20,000 for a one-time driver was no doubt an extravagant spend.Antonio squeezed his fat body into the driver\u2019s seat while Han Xiao sat at the back of the jeep. He then handed the radar coordinates to Antonio and briefed him on the plan.Antonio chuckled after he heard the plan.\u201cInteresting.\u201d\u2026It was late in the morning. The sun was scorching, and mirages started forming under the intense heat of the desert.The team that Ghostly Fox was leading only operated two jeeps. They were wandering around the desert and searching the surroundings.\u201cA jeep is approaching!\u201d a trooper exclaimed.An armored jeep appeared at the sand dune not far from their position. The jeep was travelling in parallel to their jeeps. It was the jeep with Han Xiao and Antonio.\u201cEnemy is approaching!\u201d Ghostly Fox was delighted.An eerie voice sounded from the communication device. The voice was cold and had the vibes of a killer. \u201cThe prey is finally in the trap!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A high-explosive bullet spun out of the chamber and reached accurately on one of Rose Militant\u2019s jeeps. The bullet exploded, engulfing the car in ma.s.sive flames.However, all these desert jeeps had a specially-made protective exterior that offered protection against the high heat. The destruction caused by the high-explosive bullet was limited. Han Xiao a.s.sessed the situation before he decisively changed to the penetration bullets and fired them at the bullet-proof windows of those vehicles, causing numerous cracks.\u201cSurround it!\u201d Ghostly Fox\u2019s team turned around immediately, and two other vehicles followed to encircle the place.\u201cWhere is the ambush?\u201dSince Han Xiao was undeterred by the dangers ahead, he was naturally vigilant about his situation. All of a sudden, he covered his face with his magnetic armor, and it deflected a sniper round that was aimed at his forehead. He raised his eyes and saw a new enemy jeep charging toward him from the side. On the back of the vehicle, a foreign enemy was operating a sniper rifle. A person who could fire such an accurate round on a fast-moving vehicle had the thirty percent chance of being a Mechanic or a sixty percent chance of being a sniper-type a.s.sa.s.sin. The last ten percent accounted for the possibility of it being sheer luck.The shot had come from Code 3. He was slightly surprised by the fact that he did not succeed. \u201cThe target has a special protective method\u2014could be an Esper power or machinery,\u201d he uttered in a low voice.Han Xiao believed that there were more to this ambush. He slapped on the back of the front chair and said, \u201cGo faster, don\u2019t slow down. Drive to our destination.\u201dAntonio skillfully changed gear and stomped on the accelerator. The car drifted before it changed direction and sped to escape.All of a sudden, another jeep, as if it had been waiting in place for days, appeared right in the direction of their new escape route. This time, it was driven by Code 5. He fired his bazooka at them.The anti-tank war head, driven by the flaming rocket propeller, approached them rapidly.Antonio\u2019s face slightly paled, and he immediately turned the steering wheel forcefully to make a sharp turn. The rocket brushed past the rear end of the car and landed on the sandy ground.A loud blast was heard, and sand was flying all over the air.The shockwave smashed onto the back of the vehicle, tilting it thirty degrees upward before it fell hard onto the ground. Han Xiao, who was sitting on the backseats, was b.u.mped up and down heavily. His b.u.t.t was in great pain as a result.\u201cEh. They dodged it.\u201d Code 3 squinted and said, \u201cCode 9 is waiting for them in front on Thorns.\u201dThorns was an armored battle vehicle modified by Su Li. It had extremely strong firepower, ma.s.sive horsepower, and an ultra-thick armored exterior. It was the perfect fusion of a tank\u2019s attack and defense capability and a jeep\u2019s mobility.Last night, Code 9 had discovered Han Xiao\u2019s tracks, and they had set up the ambush with the three a.s.sa.s.sins. Code 9 was their final insurance. He drove Thorns in the direction that Han Xiao placed his trap. They had even discovered the rough coordinates of the trap, so it was impossible for them to fall into it. They then purposefully waited in the direction of Han Xiao\u2019s escape to dash the little hope he had when he so desperately tried to escape!\u201cHe is already dead,\u201d Code 3 whispered.The battle caused many explosions on the road; countless bullets and rockets were chasing Han Xiao\u2019s vehicle wantonly. Han Xiao fired back as many times as he could, barely slowing the four jeeps\u2019 pursuit. The Red-Falcon sniper rifle complemented the powerful spindle bullet, causing a substantial threat to the Rose Militant. But as his vehicle was now scrambling to escape from the scene, coupled with Code 3 and Code 5\u2019s suppression, his shooting accuracy was undermined to a great extent.Ohmmm\u2026A distinct engine sound thundered on the battlefield, like a tiger roaring in rage.Han Xiao felt his heart tighten, and he quickly looked forward.A modified battle jeep was blocking their way. Its armored exterior, thick and bulky, was covered with sharp spikes like a hedgehog.Different kinds of large-caliber barrels were sticking out from the sides of the vehicle. Based on the sizes of the barrels, they were grenade launchers and small missile launchers. On the roof, there was a four-barreled rotating Gatling machine gun\u2014 oh wait, it must be a Gatling-type canon with that kind of caliber \u2014powerful enough to be used on air fleets.Thorns!The battle jeep was right in front of their final path, circling them with the other four cars. They had no way to escape!\u201cWe definitely cannot withstand the firepower from that d.a.m.n thing.\u201d Antonio had a grievous look.They were blocked by the enemies from all sides and surrounded. They were on the brink of death.\u201cDrive south. You don\u2019t have to worry about the firepower from that vehicle. I will handle it,\u201d Han Xiao said solemnly.There was only Code 3, armed with a sniper rifle, on the southern path. He was the lowest threat.Antonio had no choice but to have faith in Han Xiao, and he quickly turned the steering wheel to run Code 3 down.\u201cToo late.\u201dCode 9\u2019s expression was icy cold, and he was about to fire the canon on Thorns to blow Han Xiao\u2019s jeep up in the air. Suddenly, Han Xiao turned around and fire a shot in his direction. The round hit the gla.s.s window and instantly flashed a blazing light.Code 9\u2019s eyes were blinded by the light and started tearing. He shut his eyes in the moment of pain.Flash Bullet!Hoommmmmm\u2026A ma.s.sive volume of flames and smoke was coming out of the Gatling canon on Thorns, but it was fired in the wrong direction. The explosive rounds landed more than ten meters away from Han Xiao\u2019s jeep.\u201cc.r.a.p. How did Code 9 flounder that shot\u203d\u201d Code 3 was dumbfounded, and he quickly ordered the driver to block Han Xiao\u2019s vehicle.Antonio was fearless. He stomped on the accelerator, and the vehicle collided with the side of Code 3\u2019s jeep front unyieldingly.Both vehicles vibrated violently. However, Antonio chose an excellent angle of collision\u2014he was able to force a path out, creating an opening for them to escape the encirclement.\u201cPursue them!\u201dAs they had fallen short of success at the last moment, Code 3 was infuriated. However, as he rea.s.sessed the situation, his mood eased up again.They still had the upper hand in the current situation, so he had nothing to worry about. Although Han Xiao was running away frantically from the ambush that they had laid, they would soon catch up with him and blow his vehicle up with Thorns\u2019 firepower and horsepower!Han Xiao looked behind the vehicle through the gla.s.s window\u2014the Rose Militant motorcade was chasing them relentlessly. They were merely two hundred meters apart, and both parties were driving more than a hundred miles an hour. Additionally, Thorns was firing nonstop, erupting waves and waves of sand behind his car. The aftereffect of the Flash Bullet was still being felt by Code 9. His eyes were red and sore, and his vision was blurred. As a result, his shots had zero accuracy.Han Xiao was not at all fl.u.s.tered. He peeked at his coordinates on the radar and said with great composure, \u201cAntonio, start the nitro boost in 48 seconds.\u201d\u201c47\u2026 30\u2026 16\u2026 3, 2, 1!\u201dWhen the moment arrived, Antonio opened a small cover beside the gears.h.i.+ft, which exposed the b.u.t.ton for the nitro boost. He then pressed hard on the b.u.t.ton.Blue flames were gus.h.i.+ng out of the exhaust pipe at the back of the jeep, and its speed soared, pulling their distance apart rapidly. The resultant force pushed the two in the vehicle into the back of their seat, restricting their movement.\u201cA futile struggle.\u201d Code 3 thought nothing of it. He believed that the nitro boost would run out sooner or later. It was just a last-ditch effort to extend their lives. They would eventually be caught up by Thorns and be blown up.The nitro boost was exhausted when the distance between the two parties extended to four hundred meters.\u201cThey are slowing down.\u201dCode 5 loaded a new rocket, and he stood up through the roof window and aimed at Han Xiao\u2019s jeep from a distance.All of a sudden, his car braked at once. The sudden momentum threw Code 5 into the backseat.\u201cWhat the h.e.l.l\u203d\u201dCode 5 was shouting when he saw the driver changing gears frantically. However, the vehicle was not responding at all. His heart sank, and he turned around and looked out the window. All their jeeps had stopped moving, including Thorns. They had all lost their driving power.\u201cAll the cars are paralyzed!\u201d\u201cWhat is happening?\u201dEveryone from Rose Militant was frightened. They were like lambs waiting to be slaughtered now that they had lost control of their vehicles. Han Xiao\u2019s jeep parked a distance away.Ghostly Fox wanted to contact the base for backup only to realize that their communication devices were malfunctioning.\u201cThis is the effect of EMP!\u201d she screamed.Ghostly Fox felt a chill down her spine as she recalled how Dorothy had died.\u201cRun!\u201dThe next moment, a high-explosive sniper round flew over from a distance, targeting an area beneath Code 3\u2019s feet. Then, the landmines buried underneath the ground exploded. This time, the explosives included not just the toxic explosive mines but also the good-quality ordinary landmines from Fabian Company\u2019s warehouse.The blaring sound of the blast was heard nonstop. Glaring flames shot up into the air, creating a dazzling mixture of orange, red, and white in Han Xiao\u2019s eyes. Flames and explosions engulfed the whole hundred-meter radius of Rose Militant. There was not a single figure in sight.Han Xiao lifted his sniper rifle on his shoulder and gave an evil chuckle. \u201cAre you surprised? Are you shocked?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He lit a cigar and took a puff before he chuckled heartily. \u201cIt has been a while since I last saw such beautiful scenery. I almost forgot what an explosion looks like after sitting in the office for so long.\u201d\u201cGo ahead and enjoy the scenery.\u201dHan Xiao stretched his neck to relieve some of the fatigue as a result of the pursuit.The flames eventually diminished. Antonio and Han Xiao cautiously approached the scene of explosion. A pungent stench, created by the mixture of smells from burning bodies and toxic gas, blew toward them.c.r.a.p. I forgot that there is some toxic gas remaining!Han Xiao was dumbfounded as he watched his HP drop on the Interface. He had no choice but to retreat the place, and he could only go back to sweep the battlefield after the toxic gas dispersed.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d A faint moan was heard on the battlefield. It came from Code 3, who was already half-dead. His four limbs had been shattered in the explosion, and his body was covered in red and dark burn marks. He raised his head laboriously and leveled Han Xiao a deadly gaze.\u201cYou\u2026 Why\u2026.\u201dHan Xiao gave him a glance and used his Berserk Eagle to silence him before he could even finish his sentence.Good guys could win battles with their words, and bad guys would always lose and die because they talked too much. There were countless similar lessons in the past. Han Xiao had wanted to try and talk to Code 3, but he believed that he did not belong to the good-guy category, so he had killed Code 3 without saying a word.This kill has given me quite a lot of EXP. Code 3\u2026 what kind of lousy name is that?Han Xiao looked at his interface while insulting the enemy\u2019s name.Hold on. There seems to be an enemy missing from my kill history.Han Xiao\u2019s eyes flashed and immediately surveyed his surroundings. He suddenly fired at the ground twenty meters away.Fwoosh.A shadow jumped out from beneath the sand\u2014Ghostly Fox. She dashed rapidly and stabbed her dagger swiftly toward the nearest person, Antonio.Her Pugilist training had taught her simple ground tunneling techniques. She had escaped the devastating explosion by tunneling into the sand the instant before the explosion. She had intended to continue hiding until all the enemies were gone, but since she had been spotted by Han Xiao, she had to fight for her life.Sunlight was reflected off the surface of the dagger, emitting an icy glare. Antonio\u2019s eyes narrowed, and he slammed his ma.s.sive arms rapidly toward Ghostly Fox. His palms were almost as large as those of bears.Ghostly Fox ducked as her pet.i.te build allowed her to do so easily. She circled to the back of Antonio and stabbed her dagger toward his heart. Suddenly, a dark shadow zoomed in before her eyes, and a bear-like palm followed and grabbed her head. The palm was so large that it almost wrapped around her entire skull.Antonio threw her more than ten meters away as if he was shot-putting. The sheer amount of force created wave-like tracks around her on the ground. She was badly injured from the throw. However, she gritted her teeth hard and dived toward Antonio again. With Han Xiao watching on the side, she would be sniped down if she attempted to run away. She had no choice but to continue the fight.Poomb. Poomb. Poomb.Antonio was about to strike back when Han Xiao fired a few rounds with his double pistols, which turned her into a sieve.[You killed Ghostly Fox (LV29). You have gained 9,400 EXP.]Eh. Her level was quite high. Why was she so weak? Han Xiao looked at the battle info and realized the reason: Ghostly Fox\u2019s main job was only Lv.8, and the rest of her levels were in her secondary jobs, which were mostly useless.\u201cYou should have given me the opportunity to exercise my rusty body,\u201d Antonio groused.\u201cThe body is still warm. You can use it for some exercise.\u201d Han Xiao nonchalantly picked his nose.\u201cYou really are a jerk.\u201dOnce the toxic gas dispersed, Han Xiao stepped into the explosion site to retrieve his EMP Disruptor.Han Xiao had been unaware that Code 3 knew his whereabouts, but he was used to making multiple plans at once. He had planted not just one but four traps that night, each on a different position of the road that he was circling. Unless the enemy did not pursue him, they would have fallen into at least one of the traps.As long as you dare chase me, I will eventually kill you.After collecting his EMP Disruptor, Han Xiao started scavenging loot from the bodies. He found a substantial number of firearms and ammunition, which could be sold for a handsome amount of money. However, his greatest loot was the modified battle vehicle\u2014Thorns. He would be able to use it after he fixed its internal electronic components.Next, it is time to borrow some help.\u2026\u201cGhostly Fox lost contact\u203d\u201dThey had three a.s.sa.s.sins ambus.h.i.+ng and better intelligence, yet they fell into the enemy\u2019s trap!Luo was heavy-hearted. She had just lost two teams and the modified battle vehicle, Thorns. Now, the base was void of any defense, which was another huge loss.She contacted her secret sponsor again and explained the situation.\u201cYou guys retreat first,\u201d the person said slowly over the phone.\u201c\u2026 Understood.\u201dAfter hanging up the phone, Luo immediately organized her troops to load all the valuable a.s.sets onto vehicles in preparation of discarding the base and retreating temporarily. It was not the first time Rose Militant had faced a crisis of this magnitude. All they needed to do was seek shelter somewhere else for a few days before their secret sponsor sent down more personnel. They would gain a firm foothold again by then.However, only half of the a.s.sets were loaded up when a blaring alarm was heard all over the base.\u201cEnemy attack!\u201dThe sentry was shouting as loud as she could. Luo was astounded. She quickly climbed up the sentry post and looked far ahead, and that was when he saw a wave of sand inching closer. It was a motorcade of the Coutons approaching menacingly.\u201cd.a.m.n it. They are here too soon!\u201dRose Militant had suffered great losses, so they were bound to fall prey to other powerful factions at this opportune time, and the Coutons were the prime candidate. The primary purpose of discarding the base was to avoid the hostility from other factions. However, the Coutons came too quickly. Someone must had had tipped them off.Luo was enraged. Those Coutonian mercenaries were attacking the base from the frontline. If they were to brashly attempt to escape with their vehicles, it would surely become a battle in pursuit, which would make it all the more dangerous for them.They were in a dilemma!\u201cCommander, what should we do now?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s strike back. Strike them hard!\u201d Luo said unyieldingly.The militants dropped the supplies in their hand and quickly got back into their defense positions. They began bombarding the Coutonian motorcade with machine guns and grenade launchers. However, the mercenaries were undeterred and struck back.One could only see rounds flying back and forth between the two sides, forming a curtain of death.Countless cartridges fell into the yellow sand, and the grenades left numerous darkened sand craters on the ground, making the place resemble the surface of the Moon. Rose Militant had excellent defenses in the base; they shouldered the attack even with insufficient manpower.Behind the four walls of the base, Luo was seen commanding the militants tirelessly. Su Li walked over and whispered into her ears, \u201cDue to insufficient manpower, one-quarter of our defense system is unmanned. Furthermore, as we are walled inside the base, we will face serious danger if other factions decide to b.u.t.t in.\u201dAs soon as she finished her sentence, a roaring engine sound was heard from a distance. Luo and Su Li\u2019s hearts both jolted. They recognized that distinct engine hum.On the other side of the battlefield, Han Xiao was driving the ferocious Thorns. The car jumped down from the sand-hill like a fearsome tiger, drawing a parabolic path on the sky. The repaired exterior reflected a glaring beam of sunlight, and the vehicle\u2019s tires sped furiously.The vehicle smashed onto the ground, splas.h.i.+ng heaps of sand to the side before it charged furious toward the base. It was unstoppable.Don\u2019t the Thorns only belong to Rose Militant?Couton\u2019s eyes narrowed, and he quickly ordered his subordinates to pull back their positions. He thought that the Thorns operator was from the enemy side, and he was well aware of the firepower of the vehicle. Thus, he wanted to prepare his defense before the enemy was able to destroy them from their flanks.He did not know that Rose Militant was even more anxious than him. They were even clearer about the real firing capability of Thorns.\u201cQuickly stop him. We cannot let Thorns near the base!\u201d Su Li screamed.Luo was wailing in her heart. Thorns used to be their trump card, and now, it had been taken and was being used against them. What a despicable act!It was like having your girl s.n.a.t.c.hed by another guy, and he still dared to bring your girl\u2026 ex-girlfriend\u2026 to show off in front of you. How could anyone endure such humiliation?Luo could never tolerate such an act. She hated the killer so much that she wished that she could grind him into sand!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He then shouted, \u201cAll vehicles on the flank, make a path for the unexpected guest!\u201dThe Coutonian motorcade changed its formation, emptying a path on its flank that led directly to the front gate of the base, which allowed Thorns to conveniently charge forward.Han Xiao was alone in Thorns. After they killed Ghostly Fox\u2019s team, they had gone back and repaired Thorns at the Fabian base. This time, he came alone. Other factions in the Somar Desert would not allow such a great opportunity to pa.s.s. The main fighting force of Rose Militant had been wiped out. Han Xiao pa.s.sed this piece of information to them. It gave him the ability to fish in the troubled waters.The grenade launchers, heavy machine guns, and small-scale missile launchers had to be controlled manually using the aiming system beside the speedometer. An automated firepower control system was not installed in the vehicle.There were many incoming rounds. Han Xiao managed to escape some, and the armored exterior absorbed the impact of the rest. He then aimed one of the cannons at the wall of the base and fired. As the vehicle vibrated violently, a few small-scale missiles and grenade explosives blasted promptly on the wall, triggering a glaring flame.The canon exploded into thousand pieces, lingering in the air.Inside the base, Luo was livid. She had a hunch that they would not be able to guard the base. She called in Su Li and gave her an orderly softly. \u201cWe will give up the base and evacuate using the secret pa.s.sageway. Bring five people with us.\u201dSu Li nodded her head, agreeing with the plan.The mercenaries left guarding the base would be the sacrificial lambs while they quietly evacuated the base using the pa.s.sageway. As long as they survived, they could get as many mercenaries as they wanted from their secret sponsor.The Rose Militant mercenaries who were defending against the incoming attack did not know that they had been abandoned. They were still operating the canons a.s.siduously to defend again the Coutonians and Thorns. The blasting sounds of canons filled their ears; smoke and flames engulfed their sight. They could not hear a word from one another. Everyone was fighting as if they were the only reef there against the ocean wave, fighting a lone battle.Hoooomm\u2026After more than ten rocket rounds were fired at the scarred metal gate, it finally gave in and blew up. The gate was open!\u201cCharge!\u201d Couton was overjoyed.The motorcade entered in a single file. Following which, the Coutonians, equipped with automatic rifles, swept through the entire base. The mercenaries from Rose Militant could not set up an effective counterattack the moment the enemies charged into the base. They were shot into sieves when they tried to escape from the canon emplacements.Han Xiao drove Thorns in. He took out his two Berserk Eagles and acted independently. The Coutonians gave him a glance him but did not hold him back.Han Xiao\u2019s movement was as swift as could be, his black windbreaker flying like a cape. He was like a dark specter scouring the battlefield. Soon, he finished searching the entire base. In the process, he encountered two mercenaries from Rose Militant, who he pre-emptively shot in the head. One of them was rather beautiful\u2014she would have turned many heads if she wore a bikini and walked on the beach. Han Xiao secretly regretted his decision to shoot her in the head.After a round of searching, Han Xiao did not spot the leader of Rose Militant. His brows knitted as he knew the whole situation was not so simple.There must be a secret pa.s.sageway.Wars were daily affairs in the Somar Desert. It would not be surprising if the Rose Militant kept a secret pa.s.sageway for their evacuation.Han Xiao soon discovered their tracks. Luo and her gang had left in a hurry; thus, they had left some footprints behind. He followed the trail of the footsteps and entered a hidden cellar beneath the ground. The cellar was dark and filled with a moist, humid smell.A secret underground river?Han Xiao ignited a fire pack before he threw it down. The depth was about five meters. He ensured that it was safe before he jumped down.Beneath the base was a rocky mountain, and the cellar was actually a path dug within it. Like the pa.s.sageway in a regularly mine, the walls of the path were held up by wooden frames. It was completely dark at the front of the path as there was not a single source of light. There were clear footprints in the soil.Han Xiao raised his hand to feel the rocky walls, and he felt a patch of moisture. He suspected that there might be a secret underground river nearby.The situation of the path ahead was uncertain. Han Xiao pondered for a moment. He then took out his spider detector and laid it on the floor. The mechanical spider stood at attention like a soldier awaiting orders as Han Xiao started controlling it with his tablet.I will call you Spider No.1.After coming up with an amazing name as usual, Han Xiao quickly controlled Spider No.1 to move further into the path. The vision of its camera was shown on the tablet\u2014Spider No.1 was equipped with a night-vision camera.After moving for a while, Spider No.1 suddenly ran into a rocky wall; it had reached the end of the path.As the path was clear of danger, Han Xiao took out his torchlight and walked briskly to the end of the pa.s.sageway. Unsurprisingly, he spotted a secret door on the ceiling. Heaps of sand fell as he opened the door.Han Xiao stuck his head out of the opening, and he looked out of the cellar\u2014it was a slanted cave. Sunlight was s.h.i.+ning in through the opening of the cave along the slope, and the ground was covered in tire tracks.Han Xiao swiftly moved out of the cave, and his view suddenly brightened. The place was a complex of weathered rocks. The silhouette of the base could be seen from a distance. A vehicles\u2019 tracks had been left in the desert, heading away from the base.The remaining members of Rose Militant escaped using the vehicle. I\u2019d better chase them quickly.Han Xiao retrieved Spider No.1 and went back to the base hastily. He prepared to chase them using Thorns.The Coutonians had eradicated Rose Militant\u2019s presence within the base. They were now unloading all the supplies to take them away. They slowed down their movement and focused all their attention on Han Xiao as he walked out. They were looking at him warily. Han Xiao\u2019s heart sank.Couton brought a bunch of mercenaries and surrounded Thorns. Han Xiao touched his gun in secret before he walked over to them and said, \u201cMove away.\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201d Couton looked Han Xiao up and down, thinking about something.\u201cNot important. Please get away from my car.\u201d\u201cYour car?\u201dCouton glanced at Thorns before a wicked smile appeared on his face. He gave his men a signal, and they quietly surrounded Han Xiao, ready to draw out their guns anytime.\u201cAre you sure this is your car?\u201d Couton stared at Han Xiao and chuckled.He was clearly threatening Han Xiao.If Han Xiao\u2019s answer was not to his liking, he would have his whole gang of men beat him up.Phew.Han Xiao attacked without saying a word. He swiftly dashed three meters forward, and his Berserk Eagles were already pointing at Couton\u2019s forehead, like an unsheathed sword. His movement was as fast as that of a fox, and his gun moved rapidly like lightning.\u201cThat was too fast!\u201d The surrounding mercenaries were shocked. They then hurriedly raised their guns and aimed at Han Xiao. Han Xiao\u2019s sudden specter-like movement made them extremely nervous. Furthermore, their boss\u2019s head was right against Han Xiao\u2019s pistol, so they did not dare fire at him. They were in a deadlock.Although there was a gun to his forehead, Couton was surprisingly calm and unafraid\u2014he had always been living his life on edge.\u201cIf you want to threaten me to disarm my men, you can save yourself the effort.\u201d He smiled coldly.\u201cYou know who I am. Your master would not want his people to fight against each other,\u201d Han Xiao replied calmly. He seemed oblivious to all the guns pointing directly at him.Couton\u2019s expression turned gloomy. He frowned and pondered for nearly one minute, the tension on the ground increasing all the while, before he suddenly waved his arms to ask his men to drop their guns down. He gave a half-hearted smile and said, \u201cIt seems like it is really your car.\u201dHan Xiao held his Berserk Eagle up and remained unmoved.Couton moved sideways to open a path for Han Xiao.Only then did Han Xiao start moving. He brushed past Couton before going up to the Thorns and saying in a hostile manner, \u201cGood try.\u201dHe then stepped on the accelerator and drove away.The smile on Couton\u2019s face disappeared as he watched the car vanish in the distance. He turned around and realized that his men were all watching him.\u201cWhat are you guys looking at\u203d Hurry up and carry the items away,\u201d he shouted snappily.Although he was eyeing Thorns, he did not want to bear the possibility of infuriating his master. Couton reckoned that Han Xiao was an a.s.sa.s.sin hired by his master, so he was on his side. Thus, after Han Xiao pointed this fact out, he could no longer provoke him. If he messed up his master\u2019s plan, he would suffer dire consequences.Furthermore, Han Xiao was an a.s.sa.s.sin that he did not know enough background information about. So, after some consideration, he decided to control his greed and made peace with Han Xiao.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 - FeloniaPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 99: FeloniaTranslator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas StudiosThe vehicle tracks left behind on the vast desert by Luo and her gang were like creases on a piece of white paper\u2014they were as conspicuous as could be. Han Xiao followed the tracks without stopping.His position was continuously shown on the radar coordinates in order for him remain on course in the boundless desert. He was now heading toward the outer edge of the Somar Desert. It was indicated on the weather calendar data that a sandstorm had just occurred in this place.The plain and unchanging sight of the desert was making Han Xiao feel mentally tired. After half an hour of pursuit, a roving jeep suddenly appeared in the distance.I am finally catching up! Han Xiao\u2019s psyche was rejuvenated instantly.Just as Han Xiao spotted the jeep, the members of the Rose Militant on the jeep also caught sight of Han Xiao.\u201cIt\u2019s Thorns!\u201d Su Li cried out.Luo\u2019s face tensed up before she anxiously surveyed the surrounding and realized that the pursuing force consisted of only a single vehicle. She was immediately incensed.How dare you pursue us alone? Do you really think we are this easy to defeat\u203d\u201cMake a u-turn\u2026\u201dHooommm\u2026Thorns was firing at its maximum firepower\u2014grenades and missiles were chasing and bombing after Luo\u2019s vehicle.Luo was intimidated. \u201cCough. Cough. Let\u2019s run until he finishes his ammunition!\u201dShe was slightly embarra.s.sed.The two vehicles were in a high-speed pursuit as they drove past sand dune after sand dune, scorched sand marking the course of their chase.\u2026Raggedly-dressed pilgrims were seen gruelingly trekking through the desert. The leader of the group, an elderly pilgrim, was panting intensively, and his clothes were drenched in his sweat. He unloaded a water bottle from the packhorse and gulped one sip with his trembling hand, but somehow, he could not relieve his exhaustion and thirst.The elderly pilgrim turned around and glanced at the group\u2014everyone else was in low spirits. He then thought back to the times when he was younger. There had once been tens of thousands of compatriots who escaped from the same conquered country and embarked on this journey together. However, after years of hards.h.i.+ps, there were only two dozen people left. Some people had died on the journey, and some had given up half way through. This small group of people were the last pilgrims.At times, the elderly pilgrim could not help but become skeptical about the existence of Felonia. However, if he gave up, it would render his years of perseverance meaningless.An engine sound was heard from a distance\u2014Han Xiao and Rose Militant\u2019s cars appeared in their view, and mounds of sands thrown into the air by the vehicles.The pilgrims were not at all shocked as such a scene was commonplace on this desert. As soon as they confirmed that the violent vehicles were not moving toward them, they released their worry. They stood at their position and waited for the two vehicles to leave.At this point in time, a small-scale missile flew in the sky and landed on then sand.Suddenly, something unexpected happened!The ground vibrated abruptly, and sand fell downwards at the position where the missile exploded. As more sand fell downward, a pitch-black hole appeared in front of everyone. The hole expanded continuously, like a gigantic mouth being opened!The appearance of the running sand implied that there was a huge, empty s.p.a.ce beneath this desert!\u2026_____________________You discovered a hidden location [Felonia \u2013 08]. You received 1,000 Exploration EXP.Bounty Hunter (Rose Militant)] Hidden requirement completed.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Eh? Han Xiao was so surprised that he almost overturned his car.What the h.e.l.l?I completed the mission by accident. Am I that lucky\u203dBut how can I use my luck on this kind place? This is such a waste!The sand hole was still expanding. Han Xiao reasoned that the sandstorm that had happened a few days ago must have changed the structure of the sand layers in this area. Following which, his explosions triggered a chain reaction that resulted in this opening.Although he was very curious about what Felonia was exactly, his hunt for Rose Militant was more important at this juncture.After he left the coordinates of this place on his radar, he continued to chase after Rose Militant.The two vehicles soon drove into the distance.The elderly pilgrim\u2019s hands were trembling relentlessly. With a look of exhilaration, he called out to his peers who were stunned behind him.\u201cThis\u2026 this must be Felonia. We have to go there quickly!\u201dThe pilgrims were enlivened. They rushed toward the hole in the ground anxiously.\u201cFelonia\u2019s treasures\u2026 Felonia\u2019s treasures\u2026\u201d the elderly pilgrim could not stop mumbling to himself. Tears trailed down his cheeks as he believed that he was finally getting rewarded for all those years of determination and perseverance.\u2026After a few kilometers of pursuit, Thorns eventually ran out of ammunition, an inevitability no matter how strong its firepower was. Yet, Han Xiao sighed in relief. He was glad that this straining pursuit battle was finally coming to an end.This bunch of sissies should stop any minute now. If they don\u2019t even stop running and strike back, they must be really cowardly.\u201cThis guy finally finished his rounds!\u201dSu Li was the first person who spotted Thorns\u2019 abnormal situation. She was the creator of Thorns.Luo was immediately relieved. She then said ruthlessly, \u201cTurn around!\u201dThe two vehicles were four hundred meters apart. Han Xiao already stopped his vehicle. When he saw the jeep turn around decisively, he gave a sly smiled and started point firing with his sniper rifle.A distance of four hundred meters allowed him eight to ten shots.It took him four spindle bullets to shatter the bullet-proof window. The fifth shot flew directly at the driver.Luo, sitting on the front pa.s.senger seat, suddenly raised her hand and s.h.i.+elded the driver. The bullet, as if it had hit an invincible wall, generated a wave of reflective white light before it was squashed into a metal cake by the deflecting force and was left levitating in the air.An Esper with forcefield type ability. Han Xiao narrowed his eyes as he felt that the situation had become more difficult to handle.Espers had all kinds of abilities, but some of them would awaken with similar or even the same abilities. Forcefield was a major type of ability for Espers. Other common types included molecular control, strengthened body, and transfiguration.The forcefield-related abilities included remote manipulation of objects, invincible walls, and invincible strikes. It was the natural counter to gun-fighting abilities.As he finished his thought, Han Xiao quickly stuffed Hayme bullets into his gun and fired again. Luo deflected the bullet again with her forcefield. However, as the bullet was being compressed, it released a light green poisonous gas. Everyone in the vehicle was instantly poisoned. They started feeling dizzy, their chests tightened, and their HP dropped continually.From the battle data, Han Xiao knew that Luo was the same level as him\u2014level 30\u2014so she had not mastered the skill to manipulate gases.Han Xiao then fired a high-explosive bullet, which ignited the interior of the jeep. However, the fire was quickly put out by fire extinguishers. The vehicle was chiefly used for evacuation, so it was equipped with fire extinguishers to prevent fires from breaking out.Han Xiao had no choice but to discard his initial plan to force his enemy to abandon their vehicle. Yet, he showed no signs of being discouraged. He fired two Hayme bullets again, and now, the jeep was engulfed by concentrated green poisonous gas as if the vehicle was consumed by a plague.After these few rounds of fire, the distance from the enemy was only hundred meters.Han Xiao put aside his sniper rifle and stomped hard on the accelerator. He was fearlessly trying to collide with the jeep head-on!Su Li expression changed, and she anxiously instructed the driver, \u201cQuickly dodge. The armored exterior on Thorns is extremely thick. We cannot best it.\u201dThe driver quickly turned the steering wheel upon hearing the instruction and wanted to brush past Thorns. Upon seeing this, Han Xiao turned his vehicle in the same direction, but he was too slow; he only brushed past the rear of the jeep. He wanted to ruin the enemy\u2019s jeep by smas.h.i.+ng into it. If he had succeeded, he could then have used Thorns to hit the enemy and run. However, Rose Militant reacted too quickly and dodged the attack.Luo just realized that even when Thorns ran out of ammunition, it was not a vehicle to be reckoned with easily. She had no choice but to suppress the anger in her heart. \u201cNever mind. Let\u2019s not be badgered by him.\u201dThe jeep turned around and drove for tens of meters before Luo realized that Thorns did not chase them. As she believed, for a moment, that Han Xiao had given up, she heaved a sigh of relief. She then gnashed his teeth in anger.I will let you go for now. Your time will come once our backup is here!Just as she finished this thought, an invisible wave travelled from Thorns in a circular motion. Their jeep suddenly lost all its power, and the vehicle skidded a few dozen meters due to the remaining momentum before ground to a halt, paralyzed. The people in the vehicle were all thrown out of their seats.In the backseat of Thorns, Han Xiao had started his EMP Disruptor, meaning that Thorns had also lost its power.Han Xiao sighed. That was the last resort to prevent the enemy from running away, which he did not intend to use, but he realized that Luo did not have the guts to stay and battle it out. Thus, he had been forced to resort to such a mutually-destructive method. Even if he attempted to fix Thorns, it would take him more than ten minutes.Next, it would be human versus human!\u201cEMP Wave! The car is wrecked!\u201d Luo was dumbfounded. After being repeatedly plotted against, she could no longer contain her rage. She walked out of jeep and started the forcefield under her feet, which allowed her to move a few meters with a single step. She charged toward Han Xiao rapidly like an incoming missile, and the forcefield around her was rather erratic.\u201cAre you so eager to die\u203d\u201dBefore Luo even reached Han Xiao, her ravings thundered in Han Xiao\u2019s ears.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 - BattlePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 100: BattleTranslator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas StudiosHan Xiao turned around and started to fall back. He repeatedly fired Hayme bullets at Luo in an attempt to lure her closer.Luo raised her hands and started pus.h.i.+ng to release an energy s.h.i.+eld in front of her body. The bullets were blocked by the s.h.i.+eld, and as they collided with the s.h.i.+eld, there were beams of white light.Superhumans of the \u2018Fortified Type\u2019 possessed the innate ability to counter the powers of a sniper. However, the poisonous gases emitted by the Hayme bullets were depleting Luo\u2019s HP. Furthermore, the impact from the collisions onto the energy s.h.i.+eld also impacted Luo\u2019s body and decreased her health. However, the impact was relatively low after a reduction of 95%.Luo could sense the fury building up in her body. The killer in her was overflowing like water from a fountain.After Han Xiao fired the thirteenth shot, Luo moved closer toward him. The shots fired along the way managed to reduce Luo\u2019s HP by 100 points.If the superhumans did not possess the special defensive powers, they would have been very brittle to the attacks. The force that Luo possessed granted her the ability to both attack and defend. However, when challenging hardy magnetically-controlled retractable armor, Luo\u2019s body would be wrecked from the battle.Once they started fighting, Luo realized the weakness of her physical body.Han Xiao suddenly drew out his retractable machete. He held the blade in his right hand and wielded the mechanical arm in his left hand. He was unafraid of fighting Luo head-on. Luo focused on using all her strength to smash Han Xiao\u2019s head; however, she realized that Han Xiao was clad in a think metallic armor.At that instant, Han Xiao\u2019s retractable armor extended to up to his head, protecting his face and skull. Han Xiao moved his head back slightly, and with the help of the armor, he managed to withstand the shock from Luo\u2019s strike. Han Xiao used his machete and mechanical arm to continuously penetrate the energy s.h.i.+eld of Luo. The battle was fierce, and white sparks were emitted with each contact made.Pan Kuang, who was Level 40, had problems defeating Han Xiao in close-range combat; therefore, Luo\u2019s close combat powers were not much of a concern for Han Xiao.Instead, the abilities she possessed as a \u2018Fortified Type\u2019 superhuman were greater threats to Han Xiao. Luo was able strike suddenly at the target from almost all angles, and therefore, her attacks often disrupted the flow of Han Xiao\u2019s attack.\u201cForce pus.h.!.+\u201dHan Xiao could feel an invisible impact to his knees.Luo made use of the opportunity to pull backward and created more s.p.a.ce. She could feel tightness in her chest, as if her lungs were being scorched. The high-intensity combat had taken its toll on her body. Her stamina was running low. Superhuman abilities often required the use of huge amounts of energy. In order to replenish her energy, Luo exhausted her stamina. She was deeply fatigued and looked at Han Xiao in disbelief and shock.How on earth is this sniper so powerful? He can fight better than pugilists!Tu tu tu!The last few remnants of Rose Militant finally were finally approaching Han Xiao. They immediately concentrated all their firepower on him. To retaliate, Han Xiao fired his Berserk Eagles wildly, and the militants bled uncontrollably as they collapsed to the ground.Su Li was the only one that managed to dodge Han Xiao\u2019s attacks. She was nimble and swift. She had the swag of a pugilist. She was wearing a pair of special gloves. There were a couple of circuits on the gloves, and the gloves emitted blue light. Han Xiao sensed impending danger.Mechanical pugilist!Su Li was approaching at high speed. Her hand pushed toward Han Xiao. It seemed like her push was weak and flimsy, but Han Xiao focused his attention and managed to recognize the gloves Su Li was wearing. The level of threat of Su Li increased, and Han Xiao quickly rotated his body to dodge Su Li\u2019s attack. It was unwise to fight Su Li head-on. Han Xiao decided to use the firepower of his pistols to suppress Su Li. However, Luo came toward and managed to repel the bullets with her energy s.h.i.+eld.The three were engaged in an intense battle. The pair of gloves that Su Li was wearing managed to suppress Han Xiao\u2019s power. Han Xiao was at a loss how to counter them. The two ladies realized that and made use of the opportunity to gain the upper hand in the battle. The situation gradually turned disadvantageous for Han Xiao.If I don\u2019t make some sacrifices, it will be almost impossible for me to kill both of them.With a look of determination of his face, Han Xiao approached Su Li suddenly and pressed his body had on her gloves. The sudden collision shocked Su Li. The gloves were touching Han Xiao\u2019s armor. An uncontrollable current was flowing through the scorching hot armor!The endurance of the armor depleted exponentially. It reduced by almost 100 points. In fact, it was the first time the endurance of the armor had faced such a huge reduction!Han Xiao felt a burn to his chest. The high temperature exceeded the threshold of the armor, and the heat scorched his body. Han Xiao had no time to look at the new messages that were flas.h.i.+ng on the interface. He employed the wind-slicing slash and stabbed the machete hard into Su Li chest. An eye for an eye!Su Li\u2019s eyes expanded in astonishment. Han Xiao pressed the Berserk Eagles to her forehead and started firing hysterically. A Mechanic without any form of armor was very vulnerable.Boom boom boom!\u201cKill the enemy!\u201d Luo yelled in anger and attacked Han Xiao back while he was busy taking of Su Li.There was a sharp pain in Han Xiao\u2019s spine. He could feel his back shattering. Han Xiao endured the pain and glided forward. He turned around and fired the last of the remaining bullets. Han Xiao focused his attention on Luo\u2019s legs.Luo used too much of her stamina in her ambush on Han Xiao. She forced her last bit of energy, but she no longer had the energy maintain the energy s.h.i.+eld that protected her from the bullets. A bullet penetrated her knee.There was a change in the Luo\u2019s expressions. She understood the fact that she was facing a sniper, and the reduction in her mobility would lead to fatal consequences. In her state of panic, she wanted to use all her energy and deliver one final blow to Han Xiao.She was attempting to paralyze Han Xiao\u2019s movement by blowing up his legs!Once Han Xiao succeeded in his attacks, he quickly pulled away from the two of them. As the energy s.h.i.+eld collapsed, it created an explosion that resulted in a huge crater at his original position!Luo\u2019s heart sank. Her legs went limp, and now she really was reduced to sitting duck for Han Xiao\u2019s attacks. Han Xiao fired his shots from afar, and all she could to was forcefully repel the bullets. Her energy was on the verge of depleting completely, and desperation filled her heart.Sh*t! I\u2019m done!Boom! Boom! Boom!Han Xiao, who had retreated quite some distance, fired his rifle on a stable platform and expended all of Luo\u2019s energy. Finally, a bullet pierced through her head. She collapsed with fury and unwillingness in her eyes._____________________You killed Luo (LVL 30).You gained 12,000 EXP.\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304\u0304Han Xiao heaved a sigh of relief. He could finally relax his senses. He did not have time whine about the pain from his burns. He immediately moved toward Su Li\u2019s body and retrieved the pair of black gloves form her hands._____________________You have gained two [Thermo-electrical Incisor Gloves].\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014The functioning of the gloves was based the theory of [Basic Thermodynamics], which Han Xiao had not yet mastered. There was a \u2018micro electricity to heat transformer\u2019 embedded within the gloves. The power source of the gloves was a high voltage battery since the gloves needed a huge amount of electricity to be powered. The gloves had immense power and was able to deal multiplied damage to metals.Han Xiao held onto the gloves for his own use in the future. Speaking of that, Su Li was his first enemy from the mechanic cla.s.s. It was also the first time he had revealed his gear to his mechanic counterparts.Mechanical Pugilists made use of one type or a few types of close-combat machinery. They were able to add special effects and abilities to their machines. From the fighting style of Su Li, Han Xiao could infer that she was a mechanical pugilist of a lower level that relied solely on the performance of her equipment.Some mechanical pugilists also possessed weapons that had special abilities themselves. Once they met the prerequisites, they were able to activate the use of such weapons. Out of the four machine blueprints that Old Man Lu had created, one of the blueprints created a machine that had innate abilities.With the mission finally complete, it was time to return and collect his rewards.The image of Felonia suddenly flashed in Han Xiao\u2019s mind, and he decided to take a closer look at Felonia before returning. Han Xiao switched off the EMP interference machine. He did a rough check of the broken components of his vehicle and estimated that the repairs would take him fifteen minutes. He started the repair job immediately.There was a bunch of wanderers near Felonia just now. I wonder how they\u2019re doing, Han Xiao thought to himself.\u2026Half an hour ago\u2026The entrance to Felonia was a crack in the cliff. The pilgrims scaled the cliff and managed to reach the crack. It was pitch dark in the crack, but it seemed like the crack had a pa.s.sageway that lead somewhere.A young pilgrim switched on his torch and s.h.i.+ned the light into the alley. The scene before their eyes shocked all of them. Their mouths collapsed in disbelief, and all of them were dumbfounded.\u201cThis\u2026 this is\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
