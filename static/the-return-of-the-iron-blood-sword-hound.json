He crossed over 500 big and small lines for his family, but luck abandoned him in the end.The moment when he was accused of being a spy of the demon tribe and was executed with an unfair accusation.He thought intensely.want to liveI want to live again.______________________________~Awi Awi AiiiiiiiiiThe cry of a baby echoes throughout the large room.Dozens of slopes overlapped with the Baskerville family, the iron-blooded swordsman.The owner, Marquis Hugo Baskerville, lifted his indifferent eyes and scanned the children born this year.\u201cThey don't seem worthwhile.\"It was quite harsh for a father's first evaluation of his children born this yea\"..\".at that time.Hugo's feet stopped at one point as they passed the cradles in the nursery.Vikir Van Baskerville.An illegitimate child who doesn't even deserve to be here.Unlike the other brothers who have reached the age of 6 or 8 months, he has only just completed 100 days of being born and has barely entered this room.The baby was not crying.He just closed his eyes and lay still, as if dead.Hugo looked at Vikir like that and softened his complexion a little.It's not that he was happy because Vikir's qualities were superior to those of the other children.However, he was thinking that if there was only garbage lying around, a less noisy garbage would be better.Before long, Hugo spoke to the dozens of nannies behind .\"Move the children to the 'Cradle of Swords\"Children of the Baskervilles was put to the test from the moment they was born until the time they die.From cradle to grave.The first of these tests has just begun.\".. ... What is the Cradle of Swords?\u201dIt is a unique rite of passage for the Baskervilles.Countless knives were placed on a round hill like a maze, and a baby was dropped in the middle.The baby is trapped and wanders in the maze created by the blade.A situation in which even if he moves, the blade will cut the body and injure.In this environment, the baby has to crawl on the floor and escape through a maze of stingers.The real Baskerville becomes the true meaning of Baskerville only when you immerse yourself in the 'Styx', a river that flows round the outside of the maze.Hugo Baskerville thought.'The Styx River only works for children less than a year old. If they immerse themselves in this river, their body will become as hard as steel.\"Of course, the power of this river is not infinite.When one baby absorbs the maximum amount of power, the other baby has no choice but to absorb relatively little of the remaining power in the river.It's like a mother's milk line.The children of the Baskervilles was now thrown into the cradle of the sword.Who gets out of this labyrinth first and jumps into the river first? That will determine the future of these children.Thirty-two children born this year, including the son of the family, as well as cousins, brothers and sisters, compete against each other in the middle of the cradle of Kalchim.The blades, which were tightly inserted in the snail shell pattern, were leading the children as far and sharp as possible on a thorny path.~Awww Aww AwiiiiiThe one who cries while looking for the nanny, the one who is already craw ling with agility, the one who bleeds on the edge of the knife, the one who lays down and sucks his finger to see if he has no intention of escaping yet... ... Babies were usually like that.In fact, since they were babies less than a year old, it is a natural result if it is taken for granted.However,\"The insignificant things.\"Hugo Baskerville's evaluation was terribly cold.A small, fragile creature. Creatures that cannot survive without the help of others.There was contempt in Hugo's gaze at the human body.Even if it is his own child, there is no exception.The swordsman who ranks among the seventh on the continent, he was famous for being an iron man from the time he was born.\"Only in this way will I be able to fight the demons of the demon realm.?\"Hugo stood high and lamented as he watched the river Styx flow around the cradle of the sword.The secret river, which flows only in the holy land of the Baskervilles across all continents, has the effect of increasing mana just by soaking it, making the aurora pure, and making the body tough and hard like steel.If it hadn't been for children under one year old, they would have soaked the body right away.When Hugo is looking at the river with a sad expression on his face.\"... ... Me, over there!\"\"Ah, this can't be!\"\"Nonsense!\"Disappointment erupted everywhere.What is it that the guardian knights of a family who was not shaken by anything should be astonished?Hugo shook his head with a puzzled expression.And that moment.His eyes, which had been filled with only bitter boredom, contempt, impatience, and disappointment, had a little gleam in his eyes.Cradle of Swords.It was because a child was going straight through this dense, cutting-edge forest into the River Styx.The child's body was already covered in blood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No strength.\"Did I fall into hell?\"But it's not.This place is... too barren to be called hell.It's a place far worst than hell.It's the Baskerville family.There is no way that he didn't know the air from where he had lived as a hunting dog for the past 30 years.The smell of blood, pus, and everything that has died dirty.Vikir van Baskerville had an intuition.That he returned to not long after he was born.\"What should I do now?\"A body that has just lived for about 100 days. There is not much he can do.Just flipping over and sending a signal to the nanny in the shared childcare room to get wet?Right then.\u2018There are no guys that look useful.\u2019He heard a familiar voice.Marquis Hugo Baskerville was seen standing in the center of the childcare room.As soon as he heard his voice, Vikir almost stood up quickly and repented according to his lifetime habits.Fortunately, it was impossible because it was the body of a newborn baby.When he saw\u00a0\u00a0the main culprit who executed him after falsely accusing, his teeth automatically grind.However, there was no sound because the body had not yet teeth.\u2018Let's calm down.\u2019Days of revenge and misogyny that have been struggling to become part of the Baskerville family, to be recognized by the father, and to pretend to be an illegitimate child.He said goodbye to the past life, in which he used to be like inferior blood and dried blood.\u2018I will live differently in this life.\u2019Right then,There was an opportunity to make Vikir's resolution stronger.\"Move the children to the cradle of sharp needle.\"Hugo's words were heard.As he was lifted out by the nanny's hand, Vikir thought.\u2018Is it the first rite of passage?\u2019The cradle of the sword is a journey to the Styx River that winds around a small hill.The moment you soak yourself in the Styx River over a wall made of knives, the children of the Baskerville family are reborn as warriors.Of course, the lifeline of this Styx River does not give everyone abundant strength.Survival of the fittest.It is the same from birth that a strong man eats a lot.The children of the Baskerville family have to get out of the cradle of knife saliva as soon as possible and soak in the river for as long as possible to gain an advantage over their brothers.So Vikir moved as soon as he was thrown into the center of the cot of the knife sting....push!Twist the blade with your cute hands and press it.Children from some prestigious families hold one thing or another to help the future at their first birthday, but children from the Baskerville family must hold blades that threaten the future from the first birthday.Spit- Pod- Crunch- Crunch-The blade ova the whole body.Whenever he squeezed through the blade with force, burning pain was pouring through his whole body.But it doesn't matter.This degree of pain has already been familiar while being a hunting dog for the past decades.When someone is scratched, bitten, photographed, and pressed, they have already endured hundreds of times as a reaction.Furthermore, the deeper the wound, the better to allow the water from the Styx River to get into the body better.'Vikir knew all of the secrets, legends, myths, and ghost stories of the Baskerville family.Therefore, he also know how to make the most of the Styx River.Crawl... Crawl... Crawling...The child's soft body is guided to hell by the tough soul of the hound.A blood path, a red road.The blood flowing out of the body and going down the ramp showed the shortest distance, the straight route to move forward.Vikir continued to crawl in the direction indicated by his drops of blood.Soon after, he reached the Holy Land of Baskerville.The Styx River that flows through the swamp.When you soak in here, your body becomes as hard as steel and your soul becomes clearer.Vikir threw himself into the river in the pose of a fetus....splash!It was heavy. It was painful as if it had entered the boiling metal.It can't be painful because he fell into this place with countless knife needles all over his body.However, Vikir endured the boiling pain. And he waited.Styx river seeps in with cuts, tears, and bursting wounds.In a little while,Tsutsu Tsutsu.The body began to change.The water of the Styx, which permeated the wound and entered the bones and intestines, was changing Vikir's body from one to ten.\u2018It's definitely different.\u2019Vikir was surprised that getting off to a good start could make such a dramatic difference.The body of the previous life was tough and skillful, but it was small and thin.Since the bones themselves were weak, there was a limit to attaching muscles, and because of the narrow mana pain, there were clear restrictions on burning up the aura.But the brothers were different from him.Tall, thick bones, wide manatons.It is different from talent, qualities, and starting line.In his previous life, Vikir had graduated from the tower of swords almost at the bottom.So he really didn\u2019t enjoy the effects of the Styx River.This is because all the brothers have already sucked in that power.Since then, due to the background of being an illegitimate child and poor talent, he has been discarded by the family.When others eat clean things, wear clean things, sleep in a clean place, and do clean work.He ate dirty things, wore dirty things, slept in dirty places, and had to did only dirty things.The achievements that have been achieved so far have become those of different brothers every time.The same was true for the war against the Demons.No matter how many devils and demons have been killed, his achievements always belong to the father or half-brothers.There was little such thing as compensation.It was not only the Demons that had to be killed, but also the enemies and humans of the father.He had to actively travel back and forth from the entire seven families and engage in spy, assassination, intelligence, ambush, and intimidation activities, thereby putting Baskerville in the best position among the seven families........ But what was the result?Traitor.When the rabbit disappears and the hunting is over, the hound is boiled and eaten because there is no need.On charges of communicating with the Demons, Vikir was executed while carrying all the dirty charges of Hugo.His sin was only one.Knowing too much.\u201cEwwwink.\u201dVikir grinded his teeth.Teeth that have suddenly begun to grow into the mouth collide fiercely.The Styx River has been pushed into the bone marrow with anger and soon changes the bone to thicker, tougher, and wider the manatong.Of course, burning pain continued to flood in, but it doesn't matter.Vikir began to inhale water.It was intended to clearly strengthen the intestines.He was recalling an old legend handed down to the Baskerville family.A long time ago, there was an invincible warrior in Baskerville.'The strongest censorship that didn't leave any scratches on the skin, let alone bones, even if it was hit by an axe.But his end was truly absurd.An arrow shot by another family's rival with poison was hit by the heel and died of the aftereffects.This is because, when he was a baby, a nanny grabbed his ankles and immersed them upside down in the river Styx, because the nanny's palms created relatively weak areas where the river did not reach.'It shouldn't happen.\u2019Vikir did his best to stir himself in the river.He twists his body as best as he can so that there are no parts that are less exposed to the water.In the meantime, the wound opened up, but it was even better.Because water can seep into the body properly.And he sobbed his soul to pull out of the blood.The blood drains, and the mind wanders.He was out of breath and wanted to get up to the surface quickly.But it can't be.River Styx does not accept a child who once left her arms.If only the head is exposed to breathe, only the head can no longer receive protection.So, Vikir desperately held on to the stone in the river.He continued to stir his arm so that the river water reached the palm of his hand that was holding the stone.at that time.The faint voices heard in his ears.\"young master! You must come out!\"\u201cIf you dive more than that, you will die!\u201d\"Oh my gosh! Maybe like this!\"\u201cGet it! You must get it out!\"There seems to be a riot from above. Well, that's the way it should be.Excessive greed is poison. It's good to strengthen the body, but shouldn't you die from suffocation?even.\u201cSon. Come on up now.\"Hugo Baskerville's voice is also heard.But that voice only fuels Vikir's coming.BoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooVikir got up.But he didn't just wake up.gulp gulp gulp -Breathe in the water of the River Styx into your mouth. until the very end.and,\u201cPuha~\u201dAs soon as he ascends, he breathes in the air to his heart's content.Vikir with his mouth wide open to breathe.Hugo Baskerville sees him, and\u00a0\u00a0smiles brightly.\u201cHahaha, can you see this guy?

What came back was the false accusation and accusation that he had sided with the demons. And it was a guillotine blade.WoooshOnce again, the hatred for Hugo Baskerville comes to the fore.When Vikir gritted his teeth, the nanny was startled and pulled him out of her arms.\"Ahh, the master sometimes grinds his teeth like this.\"She laid Vikir on the cradle and got up.Now that the shift is over, it's time to shift with the other nanny.But.ughThe nanny, who should normally go out through the door, looks around and then goes to the bed across from her.\"Come on, you bastards. Drink milk.\"The nanny started breastfeeding some of the children she had previously breastfed separately.Baskerville's children are co-parented in one room.To bring up all children equally.But which mother would treat her child and half child the same?Some mothers have memorized the characteristics of their children, and then told the nanny to give longer breastfeeding.Of course, it was difficult to expect a request for Vikir who did not know who his mother was, so he had no choice but to put all expectations aside.At least until you can get your own food and eat it, you need to grow up to be able to do anything quickly.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dright thenA somewhat unexpected thing happened.The nanny, who looked around, came to the cradle of Vikir again.\"Ugh. Madam too. What is this, please bring it to Master Vikir to the cradle.\"Madam? There are very few beings in this family who can be called madam.And there is even less reason for such a being to come to him.The nanny pulled out a fairly large box from her bosom, and he didn't even know what was inside.ThudThe nanny tilted her head a few times as she placed the box in Vikir's cradleThen, with a gunshot, she left the nursery.Vikir looked at the box next to him silently.\u2018Did I have any memories like this before returning?\u2019there was nothing.He lifted his head laboriously and looked out of the cradle.Vikir's cradle is quite far from the other cradles.He didn't feel good about something.And his ominous premonitions always come true.beep-jizzAfter a while, something squeezed the box and stuck its head out.A gift for a newborn child.snake.Two snakes with black triangular heads were exposed outside the box.Bloody Mamba.It is also called the Seven Deadly Deaths because if bitten, one will die before taking seven steps.It is a rare species that is rarely found in the public.Vikir was dumbfounded and half opened his mouth.Who released this snake here?It seems that the nanny went back without knowing what she had done.Vikir, who was stunned for a moment, soon understood the situation.\"Come to think of it, there were often cases where babies suddenly died in the nursery.\"Children with outstanding abilities and extraordinary abilities from birth were more likely to die prematurely.Up until now, he had thought that it was a different world than his own, and that it was just an accidental death, an assassination from an enemy, or bad luck.But looking at it now, the situation is not very good.The black hand that was aiming at the nursery was clearly reaching out from within the family.shhhTwo bloody mambas are approaching this way.Its reddish brown mouth seemed to be already covered in blood.Otherwise, all the children in this nursery could be slaughtered.If that happens, a\u00a0\u00a0catastrophe unprecedented in the history of the Baskervilles will occur.\u2018.... ... Well, that's not bad either.'There is no such thing as attachment to the family.But if the ruin begins with you, it becomes a problem.Vikir stretched out his hand.Going through the era of destruction, the demons have been attacked and killed countless times.He had dealt with reptilian-type monsters, especially those in the shape of snakes, and, of course, he was well aware of its weaknesses.Even the body of a newborn baby was enough.... Kwok!Vikir reached out and grabbed one viper each hand.The place where he caught was exactly near the nape of the neck.Where the snake's teeth do not reach.Rather, the snakes that have been pre-attacked struggle with confusion.They tried with their sharp scales to pierce him, but Vikir's body was already hardened by the protection of the Styx River, so it was no big deal.Even if it's teeth, scales don't cause a single scratch.At the same time. Vikir used the mana of his whole body.The mana barrel, which had been empty since birth, had filled up quite a bit.It was the result of breathing in the river Styx to the limit.... Brrrr!Both fists began to emit twinkling lights.The babies in the nursery gathered here can only reach it in the next 8 years.That's what Vikir did when he was less than eight months old.Tsutsutsutsutsutsu...The bodies of the two vipers stiffen.It is the providence of the wild that the body becomes dull when it encounters a higher predator.The two vipers felt an unprecedented fear from the milking child in front of them, and they stiffened their scales.Before long, Vikir's mana-infused hand violently twisted the necks of the t wo vipers.... Boooooo!The skin and the flesh underneath were still intact, but the bones supporting them were broken.The two vipers each opened their mouths wide.The pressure caused their eyeballs and their tongue to stick out.The two vipers with broken necks trembled at that moment and died pouring out dung and urine.Poisonous poison was dripping from the tip of the exposed fangs.next day.At the sound of the first nanny to came to work, all the guards in the family gathered in the common nursery room.Two broken-necked vipers were held in Vikir's hands, while he was smiling brightly.When the Guardian Knights saw that it was the bloody mamba, the infamous poison of the 'Red and Black' mountain, they were astonished to the point that their eyes popped out.Even though it was a snake with its fangs being pulled out, it is still a great tragedy that such a monster was found in the nursery.Within a few minutes, the incident reached Hugo, who was at his hometown, and he ran straight to the parenting department that way.Afterwards, all the nanny who stood on the night shift were tortured and executed, and strict vigilance was established in the nursery.The culprit that released the poison was never found.But only one person.A young hound, who could only speak, saw through all the truth.A legendary child who slipped through the cradle of the stinger in the shortest time since he was born, and swam in the Styx River for the longest time.Vikir Van Baskerville.He just sits quietly in his cradle, waiting for his time.A moment to pay off the debt, a time for revenge.--...And 8 years have passed since then.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How did you say that the status of a swordsman was distinguished?\"Vikir answered with a calm expression.\"Regardless of the proficiency of swordsmanship, 'Sword Beginner' is a swordsman who does not know how to put mana on a sword, 'Sword Expert', who knows how to put mana on the tip of a sword, but the aura that he created by doing this is as fragile as a plane. The state where the aura that rises from the sword becomes sticky and dense like a liquid is called a 'sword graduator',and the state where the aura becomes hard like a solid and can change its shape at the will of the caster is called a 'sword master'.\"Of course, all of these are separated for convenience.Basically, combat is affected by numerous factors such as health, terrain, climate, humidity, gravity, experience, and mana density in the atmosphere.You can calculate it, but when you do the calculation, the result will already be different.But the calculations for 8-year-olds aren't that complicated yet.When Vikir answered without interruption, the other children around them raised their hands as if competing, shouting beep beep.\"If a beginner and an expert fight, the expert wins!\"\"If you fight an expert and a graduator, the graduator wins!\"\"Master is stronger than Graduator!\"\"And the Lord is the Master!\"Vikir was silently listening to the children around him.The words of one of the guys stabbed in the chest.\"The Lord is the Master!\"Hugo Les Baskerville, head of the Baskervilles.As a wizard, he possesses a whopping 7 circles of mana.However, as a master of swordsmanship, he replaced mana with an aura and used it on a sword, and it is said that the realm of it is reached in the world-renowned sword master.said the tutor.\"good. Hugo, the supreme member of the Baskerville family, is a sword master. This is a level that only seven people have reached in this country, and the heads of each of the seven generations correspond to this.\"Of course, this is a fact that Vikir already knew.He even knew that there were several more powerful Sword masters both inside and outside the Empire.This is information that no one knows at this point.Vikir was thinking hard on something by himself.The tutor's gaze had been on Vikir like that from before.\"He is a great man.\u201dTruly an overwhelming talent, almost violent at this point.It remains a small legend for the family to dive for more than 7 minutes in the River Styx as a child who was only 100 days old.But not only the body is superiorAlthough it was covered by the extraordinary of his body, his brain was also so bright that there was no rival among his peers in the family.Dare to say, 'it is a talent that can awaken a hundred''The Lord must be happy today.'He was going to report all this to Hugo.It is Hugo who is not interested in the rest of the children unless it is the el dest son and the second son.Hugo, who just stopped by occasionally like a livestock wholesaler and acted as if he was recording the growth and value of livestock he has been interested in the Castle over the past few years.Of course, because of Vikir.It was extremely unusual for Hugo to come to this infant castle, a place where only children under the age of 10 are brought together to raise children together.\"Thank you, Master. I will assist him with all my might.'Thanks to Vikir, the budget increased a lot, and his position compared to other knights in the family increased, so everyone was looking at Vikir with favorable eyes.Of course, Vikir himself was not interested, though.After class, the children were going back to their rooms all over the castle.Vikir was now looking back at himself.\u2018Hugo is a Master, right?'Unfortunately, that's true.Its density and rigidity were different from the 'solid aura' that only the master could express, and the 'sticky liquid' aura he had as a senior graduator.ughGrid his teeth.\u2018 In this life, I will never live or die so meanly.\u2019\u2018At least before the coming-of-age ceremony, he will recover all his power\u2019He is currently 8 years old.The state of Vikir had reached the advanced level of Sword Expert without anyone knowing.In the previous life, it was a level that he had barely achieved when he was 20 year s old.Before returning, it was said that he had risen to the advanced level of Sword Expert at the age of the terms.In fact, by the standards of the public, this was a great thing that could be called a genius but within the Baskervilles, it was average or slightly less than that.Usually, children of the Baskervilles knock on the door of the Sword Expert by the age of 20, and the Graduator by the age of 30.If you can put\u00a0\u00a0the 'liquid aura\u2019 on the tip of the sword in that way, you will rise to the position of an executive from here.Even the elites of the Baskerville family, who are said to be geniuses among geniuses, reached it at the age of 20, the threshold of the advanced level of Sword Expert.But Vikir was stepping on it now at the age of eight.At an age when he had never felt mana for the first time in his previous life.This is a level that even the super elite within the family would not dare to teach.When Vikir is feeling a new emotion.\"Hey.\"He heard a call from behind.Looking for the source, he turned his head to see three children from the 9-yea r-old class.Hiro Re Baskerville, Viro Re Baskerville, Loro Re Baskerville.The middle name of 'Re' received by a boy of direct lineage, and the middle name of 'Ra' received by a girl.So the three there were direct descendants of the Baskervilles.The pedigree is very clear.Quite clich\u00e9dly, the eldest Hiro, who was at the forefront, started coming towards Vikir.\"Half garbage, where are you going?\"\"Where are you going?\"\"Where are you going?\"If the guy in front spears, the two guys in the back spear.It was truly a nine-year-old quarrel.Well, anyway, since the Baskervilles are thorough talent-oriented and skillful, this won't happen when you get a little older.However, the reason why Vikir was paying close attention to the triplets in front of him was another.\u2018........ Hugo Baskerville's trident.'In 10 more years, they will grow into quite troublesome enemies.In fact, before returning, there are three hunting dogs who relentlessly pursued Vikir, who escaped through the siege, and laid out their stings.'By the way, these guys have been tormenting me a lot since I was a kid.'The growth rate of Vikir as a child was very slow because he was robbed of his meals.During various evaluations, he secretly walked on his feet or wielded a blind sword, and he also performed a lot of evil.As a result, he was slightly limp and almost died on various missions.... flash!A ghastly color of blood leaked from Vikir's eyes.Whether you know it or not, the triplets, just nine years old, giggled at Vikir.\"Hey crap, you said you were submerged for seven minutes in the River Styx? And strangled two vipers in the cradle? What a bluff. Where does an eight-year-old lie!\"\"lie!\"\"lie!\"The most vicious of the three, took a step forward.\"Can you do this?\"At the same time, a small sphere glows faintly on its palm.Children of the Baskerville family are exceptional in mana sensitivity and operational ability.It is already possible to collect mana in a circle.It seemed that they could not put it on the sword yet, but this was enough to be praised as a genius in the world.Of course, even within the Baskervilles, they can be praised for being quite talented.\"If it's a talent, then this is a talent. Hurry up you too! Let's see how many mana chunks you make.\"\u201cLook!\"\"Look!\"The triplets continued to push Vikir.Vikir looked at the lump of mana that Loro had made.A sphere of mana the size of a child's fist.Yeah, at that age, it was good at that level.But Vikir did that at the age of eight months.When he strangled two vipers in his cradle.Since the mana proficiency of 8 years after the regression has been added t o the 30 years before the regression, where does the state reach?Vikir looked around once.There is not much to worry about in this 'Little Canine Castle', where only children live.The few guardian knights and tutors are all out to the outer castle now.... Pot!Vikir manifested his power.Vikir raises his palms high and gathers mana.Seeing this, the triplets' faces turned into astonishment.Nothing was created on Vikir's palm.The triplets looked dazed for a moment, then began to laugh loudly.\"Ahahahaha, you idiot! Could it be that you didn't even respond to mana until you were that old?\"\"Didn't you?\"\"Didn't you?\"The guys are so engrossed in ridicule that they even shed tears...... But.At the same time, the watchtower not far from the infant castle.One of the guards, who was on guard duty, was bewildered by the unexpected incident that he saw out the window.\"What, what?

Follow me.\u201d\u201cFollow me.\u201d\u201cFollow me.\u201dThe 9-year-old triplets of Baskerville, Hiro, Viro, and Loro, had always had a low-key argument with the 8-year-old Vikir, who always listened to their words with his mouth shut.In his childhood before he returned, meeting these guys was as scary as meeting a grim reaper.These guys were also involved in the deaths that caused decades of turmoil in the continent, and above all, they are the warriors who will become so outstanding that they will be 'Hugo Baskerville's triplets' in a few decades.\u2018I guess they'll make a lot of great contributions to the Baskerville family in the future, So it is necessary to step on the bud in advance, to eat up the Baskerville in the future.\u2019\u201c...I'm sorry\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\"Vikir looked at them while crying like a poor child, and spoke to the triplets, who were standing there with pride.\u201cDo you want me to kick your ass here or would you rather want us to hit you where there is no one?\u201dThe triplets giggled.\u201cBut you should remember that it will be an honor for you to get beaten by us.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026. Yes.\u201dIt will be troublesome even for the triplets to beat someone in the presence of others.They twisted Vikir's arm and dragged him into a secluded place with his mouth closed.Infant Palace was a castle that had been built a long time ago, so the buildings were built in the old architectural style, and there were many remote and secluded spaces.Crossing the basement entrance, they passed between an abandoned food warehouse that had cracks.The triplets dragged Vikir into a secluded room in the no-man hallway.The leader of the triplet, Hiro, spoke with a smile.\u201cIf you scream, I will cut your throat. But, If you can hold it till the end, we will take you to the nurse's office after beating you up. What\u2019s your choice?\u201d\u201cI can hold\u2026..I\u2019ll hold it in.\u201dIt was hard to believe that he is a nine years old child after witnessing his shady smile along with a dagger in his waist.Young children are always so cruel.Laughing while taking off the heads or wings of bugs and stomping them to death.They say that children can be the cruelest creatures alive.It goes without saying for the children of the Baskerville family.The three little devils surrounded Vikir and spoke.\u201cI heard that you held your breath in the Styx river for seven minutes. When I heard that from my nanny, I laughed a lot.\u201d\u201cI laughed too.\u201d\u201cI laughed as well.\u201dHiro gave a signal to his youngest brother, Loro, who was next to him.Loro grinned when he saw the signal.He nodded his head, went behind Vikir, and covered his nose and mouth with both of his hands.Hiro looked at Vikir's face and laughed meanly.\u201cSeven minutes? If you can hold on to your breath for at least three minutes, we will admit our loss.\"\u201cAdmit loss!\u201d\u201cAdmit loss!\u201dLoro tightly closed Vikir\u2019s nose and mouth with his hands.Malice intent could be felt from the hands.It was as if he would never allow him to breathe.Hiro and Viro smiled with their hands tightly clasped together.It was as if they were going to subdue Vikir if he tried to move.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026?\u201dBut the triplets turned their heads in wonder.Because Vikir stood still and looked at the triplets without moving at all.The triplets stared at each other with a puzzled expression, because Vikir stood still and looked at the triplets without moving.\u201cHehehe, you're having a hard time holding your breath, aren't you? You have a lot of spirit. But let's see how long it can last.\u201d\u201cLet's see.\u201d\u201cLet's see.\u201dThe triplets tightened their hands even more.A minute passed just like that.As a child, Vikir should have been out of breath since he hasn\u2019t even reached the stage of sensing Mana.But Vikir stood there with calm eyes just like the first time,\u201c ...you punk\u2026.You are really good at enduring.\u201d\u201cYou punk.\u201d\u201cYou punk.\u201dThe triplets were busy tightening their hands, not knowing that the smiles hanging on their mouths were slowly starting to fade.More than two minutes.The triplets were a little dumbfounded.A long time has passed since they surrounded Vikir, who was still standing without breathing.\u201c What's wrong with him? Is he breathing?\u201d\u201cIs he breathing?!\u201d\u201cIs he breathing?!'\u201dHearing Hiro\u2019s suspension, Loro jumped up to check the situation and soon he shook his head.The breathing organs were clearly blocked.And soon 3 minutes passed.4 minutes.5 minutes.6 minutes.7 minutes.8 minutes.9 minutes.10 minutes.Vikir was still standing without breathing.In the meantime, there was a chilling silence in the room.At this point, the backs of the triplets, who started the bullying, were now completely drenched in cold sweat.All this time, Vikir had been staring at the triplets, without blinking his eyes nor changing his composure.There was nothing but grave silenceAfter a while, Hiro spoke to Loro with a forced smile.\u201c Jeeez, It's not fun at all. Untie him.\u201d\u201cUntie him.\u201d\u201cUntie him.\u201dJust as Loro was about to take his hands off Vickiard's mouth.\u201cArghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201dA sudden scream was heard.It wasn't the breathtaking sound of Vikir, nor was it the sound of struggle.Blood started to pour out from Loro's index finger.\u201c.......\u201dVikir spat out a finger from his mouth.And he grinned at the triplets in front of him.\u201c I'm going to have a stomach ache due to the finger?\u201dSeeing Vikir smiling bashfully with a lot of thick blood on his lips, the faces of the triplets turned pale in an instant.\u201cThen, Hiro chewed out.\u201d\u201c...Hmph! That's not scary at all!\u201d\u201c...I'm not scared!\u201d\u201c...I'm scared!\u201dThe last comment was not in sync like usual.As Hiro and Viro turned their heads, Loro lifted his palm and sniffled.\u201cIt was my fingers that got bitten!\u201dThe triplets began to get flustered.Seeing blood is familiar to the children of Baskerville.However, the story is a little different when it comes to flesh that has been ripped off, along with broken bone fragments.The guys who were always in sync began to move out of sync.The eldest, Hiro, comforted the youngest, Loro.\u201cGeez, calm down, bro, let's go to the nurse's office and ask her to put the finger back.\u201d\u201cLet's do it.\"\u201cAhhhh... OK. Quick, quick!\u201dViro carried Loro.When Hiro quickly reached out and was about to open the door.\u201cWho said you could leave?\u201dVikir blocked their path.Hiro's grim expression got distorted.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dOf course, the distorted expression never stayed for long.WAJAKBecause Vikir's fist flew in and broke all his nose bones and teeth.Hiro lay on the floor with his hands wrapped around his face.Viro just stood there with a blank expression on his face, but soon turned his chin immediately at Vikir's incoming kick.\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cArgh!\u201d\u201cUuuuuu\u2026\u201d\u201cUaaaa\u2026\u201dAll three of them screamed, groaned, and cried in different sounds.Vikir said, slithering in front of the door.\u201cYou will be crippled for the rest of your life if you don't get proper treatment within the next hour. But I don't think you'll be able to get out of this room today.\u201d\u201cYou will always remember my name when your teeth, jaws, and fingers start to ache.\u201dThe triplets stared at Vikir with fear.'The brutal nature of the past nine years in Baskerville has not gone anywhere\u2026\u2026But they're still children.\u2019Vikir grinned.If there is a person who doesn't listen to the winner, he\u2019s no different than a corpse.This was Hugo Baskerville's view of parenting, and furthermore, it was the code of conduct for the entire Baskerville family.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201dHiro, the eldest brother, mustered up his courage and rushed towards Vikir, with a dagger in his hand.However,PUCK!Hiro's dagger was not able to draw a single drop of blood, even though it properly pierced into Vikir's body.\u201c ...uh?\u201dHiro had a blank expression on his face.Vikir's chest, which had touched the dagger, seemed to have turned black, but soon it returned back to its normal skin color.Due to the protection of the Styx, Vikir's body has reached a level of indestructibility at the age of only 8.PUCKThe sound was similar to when the dagger was pierced earlier, but the result was completely different.Hiro sat down feeling that all his remaining teeth were completely broken.It happened in just two punches.Whoooooooooooo.The clattering sounds of tears, runny nose, saliva, blood, air bubbles, and teeth within the mouth could be heard.A dark shadow of Viktor was cast upon the three trembling twins who were clutching their faces, jaws, and fingers.TARING!A dagger was thrown in front of the shaking triplets.But no one had any thought about it.Instinctively everyone knew that if they grab it, their situation will get even worse.The triplets kneeled on the floor without even raising their heads and were only dripping blood, tears, saliva, and cold sweat.All three seem to have wet their pants from pain and fear.At that time, Vikir said.\u201cThere is only one brother who can get out of this room alive.\u201dThe expressions of the triplets suddenly changed as they found a strand of hope, so they urgently asked.\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cWho?\u201dVikir's answer to that was simple.\u201cFrom now on, you guys have to decide on it.\u201dAt the same moment, the eyes of the triplets converged on the dagger in the center.Baskerville's triplets began to split from the inside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I am here to give today's report.\u201dA middle-aged man with a cold expression stood in front of John Barrymore.The man had a sharp nose, a thick beard, and cold eyes.Hugo Les Baskerville, master of the Baskerville family, was an iron-blooded swordsman and one of the Seven Pillars of the Empire.He looked at John Barrymore with an expressionless face.\u201cThe first report. It is about the bloodshed within the 'Morg' family of the ruby mine in Red Awl Mountain...\"The Morg family, known for their magic, is one of the seven noble families along with the Baskerville family.The Baskerville family was having a territorial dispute with the Morg family recently, and the area for the dispute was the ruby mine in the west, which is subtly located at the edge of each other's estates.Eventually, at the end of the report, Hugo's mouth opened.\u201cWe will soon have a chance to discuss this problem. Someone from the Morg's side will come to visit us.\"John Barrymore continued to speak as Hugo waved his hand.After a quick glance, John continued his report.The report was not much of an interest to Hugo as he listened uninterestedly.Occasionally, he frowned as an expression of frustration.His face only displayed that expression.For the first time, Hugo's expression changed for a report.\"...So, the 1st place for the mid-term infantile evaluation is secured by Vikir.\"After hearing Butler John's words, Hugo gently stroked his chin.John knew it was Hugo's habit to stroke his chin when he was pleased.It's rare for Hugo to remember the names of the children in the family, so John's expression also brightened.Soon, Hugo asked.\"Butler, when is the practical test for the children who entered the infant castle?\"\u201cIt will be soon. It starts five days from now. Most of the guardian knights of the young masters have already gone out on business trips to prepare.\u201d\u201cThen the infant castle will become empty.\u201dJohn's expression changed to one of excitement at the words.\u201cAnyway, the next news I will report is from the infant castle, my Lord.\u201d\"What is it?\"\u201cThat\u2026 there is good news and bad news.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s listen to the good news first.\u201dAs Hugo showed interest, John's voice grew a little stronger.\u201cThere was a phenomenon of two suns rising in the sky above the infant castle.\"\u201cTwo suns?\u201dHearing that, Hugo's eyes widened slightly.The Baskervilles have always believed in superstitions\u201cIs this an auspicious sign?\"\u201cThere is also a rumor among the Gasols that a little sun has been born to assist the deficit.\u201d\u201c......hmmm. Someone was playing with mana, right?\u201d\"At this moment, all those who are talented enough to pull off such pranks are away on business trips to prepare for the practical tests for the young masters.\"\u201cWell, that\u2019s not a bad sign then. Another sun, huh?\"Hugo quietly nodded his head.Originally, the rise of two suns had been regarded as a good sign.\u201cWhen the sun appears above the clouds, something good always happens to the family. I don't know what's going to happen in the Infant castle.\"Then John's expression darkened.\u201cIt was not going to happen\u2026 it has already happened.\u201d\u201cIs this the bad news you mentioned earlier? Tell me.\u201dAt Hugo's words, John continued the report with a gloomy complexion.\u201cThere had been a big fight between the young masters.\u201dAt those words, Hugo's expression changed completely.\u201cA big fight? How many died?\u201d\u201c\u2026No one has died, but all of the young master's teeth were damaged, the jawbone of young master Viro has been dented, and the index finger of young master Loro\u2019s right hand was amputated. Of course, Now, everyone has been treated and returned to their original health.\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s just a small fight. Siblings usually grow up by arguing and fighting.\u201dHugo reassured himself and leaned back on the chair.Then he murmured something as he turned over the reports on the triplets.\u201cThey\u2019re so close to each other, there\u2019s no way they would have fought each other, right?\u201d\"You're right, sir. They were in conflict with another young master.\u201d\u201cThese foolish things. Did they pick a fight with someone older than them? Of course, they will naturally be stronger. Even a blind man can judge which ones are stronger and weaker before they fight.\u201dHugo clicked his tongue, while John corrected him.\u201cThat\u2026. The young master who made Master Hiro, Viro, and Loro like this was way younger than them.\u201d\u201cWhat? Did the whole 8-year-old class kids gang upon them?\u201d\"No. Only one.\u201dAt those words, Hugo's eyes lit up again.\u201cHe is the one I mentioned earlier, the one who got first place in the test, Young Master Vikir.\u201d\u23e9\u00a0\u23e9\u00a0\u23e9\u00a0\u23e9\u00a0\u23e9\u00a0\u23e9Vikir van Baskerville.8 years old this year.He was summoned by the governor and headed to the chamber of secret, which was located in the depths of the palace.He opened the door and walked in.There he saw the gigantic figure of Hugo Les Baskerville.\u201cSit down.\u201dAlthough he did not show any particular aura, the mana emanating from him was heavy.Vikir moved carefully so that the mana hidden in his body would not be discovered.He was confident in hiding his manaThe warriors who have gone through a long period of confrontation with the demons and experienced the era of destruction are well-versed in concealing their mana.This way to completely hide mana can not be performed by those who had not experienced the era of destruction.It wasn't a matter of strength, it was a matter of skill.However, there is a limit to that, too.If he concealed too much of his mana, then that will inevitably stand out in Hugo's eyes.'I'll have to find a way out of this soon.'Vikir thought to himself and sat down on the small chair in front of him.Hugo opened his mouth.\u201cYou\u2019ve grown a lot while I haven\u2019t seen you.\u201dHearing this, Vikir was a little surprised.His voice, which had always been forged like a knife that can cut others just by hearing, was quite dull today.And the lines he uttered were also quite surprising.'The piglets are big, so why are they always so weak and dirty every time I see them?'Before returning, Hugo, who found the childish nature of the kids, used to say it all the time.He watched the growth of his children as livestock and always looked at them like a butcher who was impatient to sell the livestock quickly, but today his eyes were strangely warm.It was as if he was expecting something.\u201cGreetings, my Lord.\u201dVikir gave a bright greeting.However, Hugo, who has been called 'Lord', doesn't seem to like it.\u201cLord? yes. I am the Lord.\u201dHe thought about something for a while and then changed the topic as if it had never happened.\"I was told that you had crippled the triplets.\"Vikir replied.\u201cAs far as I know, the older brothers have received appropriate treatment immediately afterward. Hence there seem to be no physical disabilities.\u201dHugo frowned.\u201cThe thing you crippled was their hearts?\u201d\u201cSince that day, I\u2019ve been told that they ate separately, slept separately, and did not mix well with each other. The three of them were excellent at combination skills, but now they have lost their advantage completely due to their bad relationship.\u201dWas that the end?No.These days, all three of them end up peeing just by making eye contact with each other.A dog that has lost its fighting spirit is useless for eternity.However, Vikir did not dare to speak these words out of his mouth.However, he still boldly made a statement.\u201cIt\u2019s heavy and useless to carry three sloppy knives at once, right? It would be better to carry a famous sword that was forged carefully by the craftsman.\u201dAt those words, Hugo's eyes widened.\u201c\u2026That\u2019s right.\u201dHe sweeps his chin and looks down at the 8-year-old kid in front of him.\u201cBut don\u2019t you think it was wrong to beat up your own brothers?\u201dAt Hugo's words, Vikir questioned, while seemingly puzzled.\"My fault? What did I do wrong?\"\u201cWhat? I am talking about you beating your brothers to pieces.\"At Hugo's question, Vickir tilted his head as if he couldn\u2019t comprehend his words.\u201cWhy is that wrong? I am stronger.\u201d\"....what?\"Vikir thrust a wedge towards Hugo, who had a blank expression on his face.\u201cHow can the strong do something wrong?\u201dThe strong should be respected, while the weak are sinful.That is the motto of Baskerville.Soon, the corners of Hugo Les Baskerville's lips began to twitch.It was as if the small, bold guy in front of him looked so cute.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 8": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Return of the Iron-blood Sword HoundCH 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBikir knows Hugo\u2019s personality well.\u2018\u2026 \u2026 Lizard.\u2019A cold-blooded human with blood so cold that one might wonder if he was a reptile.Basically, he was a being who was only interested in the future of his family and his own actions.He is a human being who thinks of everyone but himself as a tool, especially as a weapon.Weapons basically exist to harm others, and it is unimaginable that weapons independently show mercy or hesitate.It is also natural that the more poison he harbors, the better his weapon becomes.So it was quite possible that Hugo\u2019s gaze at Bikir was gradually smiled with satisfaction.\u201cokay. Do you think you are innocent?\u201d\u201cYes. Rather, my brothers were wrong.\u201d\u201cWhat did they are wrong?\u201d\u201cBeing weak is a fault.\u201dStrong self-esteem. A world where weakness is sin.Wouldn\u2019t that be Baskerville?Bikir\u2019s words ran right through this core family motto of the Baskervilles.It is not a sin for a lion to eat a deer.It is the providence of nature that the strong beat the weak, and insisting that it should be divided into crime and punishment is just foolishness.It was Hugo\u2019s teaching behind the tutors who stuck in his ears like nails during his childhood.\u2018\u2026 \u2026 So the older brothers bullied me first! Even if I try to whine, it\u2019s useless.\u2019Before his return, Bikir explained his innocence and the sins of his brothers, as his normal children usually do, but Hugo only expressed contempt with an even more frowning expression.\u2026 \u2026 \u2026 And those eyes were the same until the last moment when he knelt on the guillotine at the execution site.Meanwhile.Hugo Le Baskerville.He clasped his hands together and covered his mouth.And he said in a low, subdued voice.\u201cYour brothers were here before you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cThey say they forgive you like an elder.\u201dBikir didn\u2019t bother to answer.You can tell that he has the experience of keeping Hugo\u2019s side for a long time.Perhaps the triplets did not give Hugo an answer to their liking, and instead annoyed him.\u2018I must have been very intimidated. And what about forgiveness?Bikir replied in an emotionless voice.\u201cIt\u2019s okay to eat for free.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dHugo paused for a moment.Finally, Hugo let out a faint laugh.\u201cHa. That\u2019s right. When I wanted to became the head of household, I had to work hard to become the succsessor.\u201dIt was quite an unfamiliar sight for Hugo.\u2018By the way, he had to become the successor? Is he saying that by working hard you could become the successor?\u2019Birkir, who was worried for a while at the first sound he heard, soon understood his meaning.Hugo had risen to the position of head of the household by killing all of his older brothers.\u2018Right. He only heard that the eldest son is unconditionally the one who inherits the family. So even the successor title can become acquired.\u2019It was the moment when I realized the true nature of the Baskervilles again.Hugo asked again.\u201cWhatever. The older brothers reached out first to forgive you. Do you still feel guilty?\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dBikir looked at Hugo in silence for a moment.The warm eyes of his father, which he had never received in his previous life.However, the already salty and cold frozen heart can never be melted with such feeble warmth.\u2026 \u2026 When was it before returning?The last daughter of a family destroyed by the Baskerville once visited Hugo in person.After a long time, she became a nun and gave a Mass saying, \u201cI forgive you.\u201dAnd Hugo, who heard the contents of the mass, said this.\u201cWouldn\u2019t forgiveness be just an excuse for the weak?\u201dExcluding the honorifics, the lines are exactly the same as Hugo\u2019s at the time.In an instant, Hugo\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cHahahahahaha-\u201dOnly then did the sound of laughter so loud that the windows trembled resounded throughout the room.Hugo leaned back in his chair with a look of supreme satisfaction.\u201cThis is how my child should be.\u201dIt was the first time Bikir had ever seen him express his emotions to this extent towards his son.The conversation with Hugo ended here.\u201cBarrymore.\u201dHugo, who had summoned the butler, had returned with an expressionless face before he knew it.But the warmth of the embers still lingers in the voice that comes out of his mouth.\u201cGive Bikir the key to the food storage.\u201dHearing this, Barrymore\u2019s eyes widened.Children in the Baskervilles always eat the same food until they are 15 years old.Water and Haggis.It is a dough made by mashing together the meat and intestines of all kinds of animals and a little bit of vegetables.The amount of food is provided in an unlimited amount and managed in a very hygienic manner, but there is no taste at all.So, the children of the Baskerville family are crazy about sweets, candy, and chocolate that sometimes fall out when they get good grades in basic education.It is a system that can inspire children\u2019s learning motivation at a very low price, cultivate a sense of competition, and further develop them into great members of Baskerville.Knowing that, Hugo asked Bikir.\u201cDo you have any snacks you want to eat?\u201dThen Bikir answered with an innocent smile typical of an 8-year-old child.\u201cChocolate!\u201dHugo looked at him and nodded his head.You must be thinking to the extent of \u2018I even have a cuteness suitable for my age\u2019.Barrymore also smiles heartily as if a child is a child.Hugo beckoned Barrymore.\u201cGo to the food pantry and take out as much chocolate as you want. But, don\u2019t be too greedy. Just enough to carry.\u201d\u201cYes, my lord.\u201dBarrymore took Bikir\u2019s hand and headed for the door.at that time.said Hugo, turning around with his back to the door.\u201cPerform well during the evaluation.\u201dIt is unusual to receive such encouragement.But what followed was even more unusual.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 Don\u2019t lose to your direct descendants.\u201dAt those words, Bikir\u2019s eyes began to emit red light.like two suns.* * *\u201cI greet Young Master.\u201dBarrymore took Bikir to the kitchen outside the little fang castle.A few chefs followed suit, politely presenting themselves.The food storage deep underground is always cool.The cold air blowing through the cracks in the stones met with the warm air that came in when the door opened, creating condensation.Barrymore held up her lamp to light the inside of the warehouse.It\u2019s just a matter of managing mana, but it\u2019s not something that makes you feel embarrassed when the old butler does it this far.Bikir went inside.It can be seen that the ingredients eaten by the guardian knights in the family, family members over the age of 15, and other servants are neatly arranged.\u201cCandies and jellies are here. If there is a menu you would like to cook separately, I will ask the chefs to prepare it.\u201dAt Barrymore\u2019s kind invitation, Bikir shook his head.\u201cJust chocolate.\u201dAt that, Barrymore looked down at Bikir with a slightly sorrowful look.How much chocolate do you want to eat?\u201cIf you\u2019re over 15, you\u2019ll be able to eat as much as you want.\u201dIt was a sincere consolation.The chefs in the back took out the finest chocolates from the shelf while paying attention to the butler.\u201cThis is the finest chocolate that the women of the House of Morgue who are reputed to be gourmets enjoy eating. This time, we also got a few cans from our side. It is said that the flavor becomes more intense if you add nuts from the south and honey from the west.\u201dBut Bikir shook his head.\u201cI don\u2019t need anything processed.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 yes?\u201dTowards Barrymore and her chefs, who looked puzzled, Bikir opened her mouth.\u201cI need cacao beans. A species with a very strong flavor.\u201dHearing that, Barrymore tilted her head.The raw material of chocolate is cacao beans.However, unprocessed cacao beans are bitter and astringent rather than sweet.It was clear that even a paper with a strong flavor would only taste bitter.After a while, after hearing the chefs\u2019 report, Barrymore said.\u201cUgh. If it\u2019s paper with a strong flavor\u2026 \u2026 It is said that there is. In the past, the family lord personally led the senators in the family to subdue the barbarians on the western front of the territory and cultivated the vast jungles of the area as farmland. It is said that one grain of \u2018Bloody Bean\u2019, a local specialty, can make 100 liters of chocolate.\u201d\u201cGood. bring it.\u201d\u201cHow much should I bring?\u201d\u201cAs it is.\u201dAt Bikir\u2019s command, the chefs moved.Before long, one of the chefs came with a small leather pouch in his hand.The pouch, barely big enough for two fists, was filled with bright red beans.It looks like more than 100 grains.This is Bloody Bean. One bean has a consistency comparable to 100 liters of chocolate.Bikir tried chewing a bean.\u2026 Knock!Reaction comes right in the mouth.It was astringent and bitter enough to tingle your entire tongue.Bikir spat out the peas and nodded in satisfaction.Barrymore nodded his head.\u2018You really like chocolate.\u2019Anyway, Hugo told Bikir to give him as much food as he wanted, so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem even if he took all these cocoa beans.However, this single cacao bean is the amount that can produce 10,000 liters of chocolate.Barrymore admired the 8-year-old\u2019s greed and wisdom.Maybe Bikir will gorge on his favorite chocolate for the rest of his life.\u201cyoung master. Shall I process this and bring it to your room?\u201d\u2026 \u2026 however.Bikir gave an answer that made everyone wonder.\u201cNo processing required. This is enough.\u201dApparently, he didn\u2019t ask for the beans to eat them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As soon as you leave this place, you can steal each other\u2019s badges. If you steal the other person\u2019s badge, you get extra points.\u201d\u201cEven if you hunt monsters, bonus points are given. However, points are deducted if you are fatally injured. In case of death, all points are lost. Well, at the time of death, the score is already not a problem.\u201d\u201cWe do not recommend going outside the restricted area. You must only move within the space we have subdued over the past few days. This is because there are still many undiscovered areas in Le Rogue Mountain.\u201dThe Guardian Knights explained other intricate rules.But to Bikir, it\u2019s just annoying nagging.\u2018It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen you.\u2019He, too, has often been to Le Rouge Mountain.As a student in his childhood and as an instructor in his old age, the places he frequently visited were Le Rouge mountains.It was a strange and scary place when he was a student, but when he came as an instructor\u2026 \u2026 .\u2018It\u2019s an even more scary and unfamiliar place.\u2019Because he had to search outside of his comfort zone.The area where the children of the Baskerville family survive is actually more like a cozy cradle.The real danger is the area outside the boundary guarded by the Guardian Knight instructors.Forbidden zone.Outside the ridge called \u2018Cradle\u2019, and beyond a few mountain ranges, powerful monsters and barbarians swarm.Since the Baskervilles declared this place as their territory, they have steadily pioneered the fights against enemies beyond the Le Rouge Mountains.It was also because there was the emperor\u2019s order and full support.The expansion of the territory of the Baskerville family was the expansion of the territory of the empire, and for this, various tax benefits and autonomy of military facilities were guaranteed.Before regression. Bikir also spent a very long time here in the Le Rouge mountains, passing through his days as an examinee, his days as an instructor, and his days as a hunting dog.So the environment here was very familiar to him.Not to mention it was not in the \u2018Undiscovered Zone\u2019 beyond the ridge, nor in the \u2018Cradle\u2019.\u2026 \u2026 but. Most children seem to feel unfamiliarity and fear in the environment they are seeing for the first time.The dry, crumbling dirt cliffs, the pungent wind blowing from the burned forest, the dry ashes, the unpleasant eyes and cries that can be felt from somewhere.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 Ugh, this is the first time I\u2019ve ever been in such a bad weather.\u201d\u201cIt has become more barren than when I came last year.\u201d\u201cYou want me to stay here for a month!?\u201d8-year-olds cry.The 9-year-olds are pretending to be indifferent, but their expressions are not good, perhaps because of bad memories from last year.In fact, this test is a battle between 8-year-olds who want to keep the badge and 9-year-olds who want to steal it.For today\u2019s 8-year-olds, who will turn 9 next year, this experience will be very important.And in this situation, 8-year-old Bikir stood still, waiting for the bell to signal the start of his exam.Nearby, 9-year-old children aiming for Bikir\u2019s badge were laughing sinisterly.\u201cIs that child? A seven-minute dive in the River Styx.\u201d\u201cDoes that make sense? Well, rumor has it that he strangled two poisonous snakes while he was in the cradle.\u201d\u201cYou say that the guy with the perfect writing score? Let\u2019s see if I can do well.\u201dA buzzing sound all around.But there is one strange thing.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dThe three strongest and fiercest 9-year-olds in the class, Hivero, Mivero, and Lovero, are somehow silent.The other 9-year-olds just tilted their heads as they were always eager to show Bikir a lesson.Soon, some of the children who were noticing came forward and began to quarrel with Bikir.\u201cYou cheeky bastard. As soon as the practical evaluation begins, I will stone you to death.\u201d\u201cA guy who isn\u2019t so great gets smug.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going to feel like hell here for the next month.\u201dThen Bikir finally responded.\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m great. Not really great.\u201dUnexpected humility makes 9-year-old children look puzzled.However, Bikir\u2019s words soon made the guys\u2019 faces frown.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 You guys are just too low level.\u201dImmediately after that, fresh curse words flew in and stuck.\u201cYou, you, I\u2019m the real fighter here!\u201d\u201cCome to the place where the old tree is later in the evening, you son of a bitch!\u201d\u201cGet out of the way! I\u2019ll beat that bastard! Even if I die, I won\u2019t know!\u201dThe children of the Baskervilles are easily drawn into even low-level provocations.Small puppies that hadn\u2019t been weaned were baring their fangs that weren\u2019t ripe yet.As an old dog who has gone through all of the prenatal battles, he doesn\u2019t even smile, so he\u2019s just indifferent.Right then.Ding-Pavlov van Baskerville, a guardian knight and instructor in charge of the \u201cleading dog,\u201d rang the bell.The practical test has begun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Baskerville, practical tests are frequent, several times a day.Most of the brothers fight each other to determine superiority.Ding-The young hounds of the Baskerville, who were nervous in the unfamiliar environment, immediately came to their senses at the sound of a familiar bell.And as it has been learned in the meantime, it reveals speculation like instinct.A young Baskerville from the nine-year-old class quickly ran across the wasteland.He was the guy who benefited quite a bit last year by occupying the advantageous terrain first.But he was intelligent enough to remember last year\u2019s points, but he\u2019s not intelligent enough to keep his eyes open.The quick-witted 8-year-olds chased after him.Bikir didn\u2019t know what it is, but he had a planed to get what he came here for.Clever guys pretended they knoe something, to attract competitors.And lure them into dangerous pits or swamps and get rid of annoying flying flies all at once.The triplets, Hivero, Mivero, and Lovero, were such cunning guys.\u201cOccupy from there.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t give orders.\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019re doing well on your own, you guys do well.\u201d9-year-olds who are already showing their prominence.They used the same method last year when they were 8-year-olds to eliminate a lot of upperclassmen.Within hours of the bell ringing, dropouts began to appear one after another.From shock and fainting, from rolling down a steep slope, or from falling into a swamp, from being stabbed or cut.The reasons were varied, but the root cause was one.It was at the hands of other brothers.\u2026 kang!You can also hear the sound of metal pieces colliding with each other throughout the forest.As soon as the competition began, the children of the Baskerville were fighting each other.A dull sword whose blade is not sharpened so that it cannot kill.Killing opponents is not encouraged in this tournament.It is not prohibited, but it stops at a level that is not recommended.If you kill the other person, points are deducted\u2026 \u2026 This score range was quite large, so the children did their best not to kill the other person \u2018by hand\u2019 if possible.Of course, it doesn\u2019t matter if your skills are good enough to take a deduction and you have enough points accumulated, or if you can kill your opponent secretly enough to be unnoticed by the leader dogs.Well, even though the guardian knights who act as guide dogs keep their eyes open 24 hours a day, mysterious deaths and accidental deaths occur frequently during the practical evaluation, so this opportunity may be used to eliminate a rival or a nusance.\u2026 \u2026 but.Bikir wasn\u2019t in this fierce competition.He acted like he had no interest in scoring from the start.All he did was, as soon as the bell struck, to move swiftly out of the reservation and settle down in the wasteland outside the boundary bordering the Unsea Zone.\u2018\u2026 \u2026 Was it like this?\u2019Bikir was reminiscing about his days as a student before returning and his days as an instructor.If you go straight this way, there is a wasteland that is narrowly inside the border area.There, an old dead tree stands tall, but the roots that extend deep into the ground are soft and rotten, so the whole ground is soft.Before long, Bikir found the land he was aiming for.Unlike other places, the soil there is exceptionally reddish.Bikir broke a branch and began digging and poking the ground.While the other brothers fought in the distance, winning and losing points, Bikir silently dug the ground.The guide dog guardians kept observing Bikir while hiding in a secret place.However, even after several days, Bikir continued to be seen digging a pit.\u2018Looks like he\u2019s just hiding there to kill time.\u2019\u2018It\u2019s a little disappointing?\u2019\u2018There\u2019s no need to keep watching.\u2019Since he was a Bikir who had been prominent since his childhood, the Guardian Knights had high hopes for him, but this was quite disappointing.Digging and hiding in pits was typical behavior of cowards, low-ranking and insignificant children.In the end, the Guardian Knights who couldn\u2019t keep an eye on him began to take their eyes off Bikir one by one.And began to pay attention to the fights between the children.* * *\u201cThis place is still like a cradle.\u201dBikir.He was sitting at the bottom of the pit and having a good time.Le Rogue Mountain, which I came back to again, were such a comfortable and cozy place.Outside, the Guardian Knights stand guard instead, and competitors do not come to these outskirts.If you are thirsty, you can collect dew that has formed overnight on a large leaf hung on the wall of the pit, and if you are hungry, you can catch a passing snake or mole and roast it.Rather, it was much more delicious than haggis or preserved food that was provided.Even the bed that he made for himself was more cozy.The beds for traniees were made of monster skins or thorns, so they are very hard and rough.But here in the pit, well-dried straw, sawdust, and burnt ashes are softly laid out, so it\u2019s very warm and comfortable.Bikir closed his eyes for a moment while roasting a rat he had caught the night before.<The rat \u2018Norvegicus\u2019>Hazard Class: FSize: 50cmFound in: all continents\u2013 A mouse that has been stricken with demonic energy and has turned ugly.A grown-up adult has the intelligence and size of a small dog, so it is an object of disgust for women and girls.After removing the intestines, it is surprisingly edible if you bake it well over a fire or boil it well in water.When it comes to information about monsters, no matter how low they are, Bikir had clearly memorized them all.It was thanks to the monster encyclopedia that Bikir had memorized before returning.Of course, Bikir wasn\u2019t the only one who memorized all the monster books in the world before returning.In the Age of Destruction, everyone was a hunter.\u2018\u2026 \u2026 But now I\u2019m the only one right now.\u2019Maybe it is closer to a hounds than hunter.But that could make the hunter even more miserable.\u201cWhat could be more ironic than a hunter who died from being bitten on the neck by his dog?\u201dSuddenly, I recall the conversation I had with Hugo before returning.This happened shortly before being executed.\u2018When you train a dog, you have to risk dying. Usually two out of three die. Do you think it\u2019s heartless?\u2019\u2018no.\u2019\u2018Of course not. Because the owner also trains with the preparedness to die from being bitten by a dog. Owners should always be prepared. You never know when you\u2019ll die from being bitten by hidden teeth.\u2019It was a fact that Hugo himself was aware of.Maybe that\u2019s why Hugo didn\u2019t trust anyone in this world. Even himself.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dBikir shook his head to clear his thoughts.Then he took one of his beans from a sack hanging from his waist.Blood Bean. Dark red soybean with a huge cocoa concentration.Bikir tossed a pea into the fire.The stinky and other odors are removed from the plump fat rat meat, and the faint scent of cacao permeates.\u2018Cacao beans, especially thick blood beans, are the best for removing meat odor!\u2019It was a recipe learned from a late sergeant in the same platoon when he was drafted into the war against the demons.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 Camping makes me think a lot about the past.\u201dBikir looked around him.All the eyes that had been watching were now gone.Perhaps the guide dogs, who found their behavior uninteresting, moved elsewhere.\u2026 \u2026 If so, now is the time.Bikir reached out to the pile of firewood.Then he took out a dagger from his waistband and started cutting down trees.wooden spear.Bikir began planting these pointed wooden spears upside down all over the pit floor.The tips soared high as if to pierce the sky.Dozens or hundreds of them are embedded in the bottom of the pit.Like the lower jaw of a beast with fangs.Even Bikir himself hadn\u2019t thought about what these teeth would bite into.Outside the boundary between the Le Rogue, in the Forbidden Zone, there are monsters that are so big and powerful that people in this world can\u2019t even imagine.\u2026 \u2026 Well, most of them were familiar to Bikir who had passed through the age of destruction.\u201cThe tree has fallen.\u201dBikir discovered that all the trees he had cut were exhausted.It was not enough to sharpen a wooden spear or toss it into a bonfire.Bikir moved his body out of the pit to fetch the wood.The gaze of the Guardian Knights has also disappeared, so now you can cross over to the forbidden land and cut down trees.Before long, Bikir crossed the border with a stealthy spirit and entered the forbidden zone.* * *The sea of red and black trees is incredibly dense.The stems and roots that grow horizontally and vertically made the entire forest into a huge labyrinth, a jungle-gym.If you look at the dark caves poking through the roots of trees that have been burned by the forest fire, you might doubt that they are passages leading to hell.Any normal young hound of the Baskervilles would avoid this gloomy and foreboding place without saying anything, but Bikir rather walked straigh in.\u2018Let\u2019s see. I guess this was the right habitat?\u2019Bikir wandered through the sea for a long time.When he was an instructor or skirmisher, he roamed around this place as if he were eating, so his eyes were clear as if he was going in and out of his house.yet.Bikir found something.Sizzle sizzle\u2026 \u2026It\u2019s the sound of a ember burning in the ashes.After following the smell of something burning, I finally found what I was looking for.It was a pile of shit.A fire that has not yet been extinguished burns in the blackened pile of dung.As far as Bikir knows, there is only one monster that matched.He lifted his head and moved a little further through the the trees, and before long he saw the owner of the dung.A large body, sharp teeth and claws, and two eyes that glow like phosphorus.<Hell Hound>Grade: B+Size: 3mDiscovery Location: Le Rogue Mountains Ridge-Aka \u2018the dog from hell\u2019.It is a being that unconditionally brings a terrible disaster to those it encounters, and if they are ever bitten they can never survive.The bright fire spewing out from the eyes and mouth comes from the embers of the depths of hell, and does not go out until the life force is used as firewood and is completely burned away.Even in the encyclopedia, there was not much information about this dangerous monster.However, Bikir has faced quite a few monsters of this type through the age of destruction.\u201cFinally found you.\u201dThe reason he had come to Le Rogue Mountain is to meet these fuckers.Bikir turned quickly.As soon as the Hellhound saw Bikir, and attacked.kong! kong! kong!The roar of a hound pursuing closely behind.As soon as he got out of the way, he threw himself into a burrow on the side.Chow ah-Hellhound took several vain steps, unable to stop.\u201cAs expected, you\u2019re an idiot who only knows how to go straight.\u201dMost beings who have climbed up from hell can do nothing but go straight.Even elite monsters like Hellhound show weakness in such a sudden change of directions.Grrrrr\u2026 \u2026The hellhound turned around and started pursuing.Bikir prepared the following pattern.Chow ah-Drinking water made by collecting two days of dew was sprayed and drew a long line on the floor.\u2026 flinch!Hellhound came to a sudden stop with the same momentum as it was running.This hellhounds do not usually, cross water spots.No matter how thin and shallow the water is, that is the case.Since it is a monster that is not good at anything other than running in a straight line, it had to stop water spots scattered on the ground and go around.It is a fact known to all hunters who have passed through the era of extinction, but it is a habit that is not well known in this world due to lack of research.\u2018Well, it will inevitably come to light later when the Pandemonium Gate opened and Hellhounds swarmed all over the continent.\u2019Bikir faced the hellhound.Although the speed of the Hellhound running back from the water station has decreased, it is still terrifying.The hellhound is a monster that even knights of expert level or higher have a hard time fighting it.Even before returning it was also a monster so powerful that he was able to catch it alone only when he was 18 years old.But.Bikir did not come all this way without taking any measures.\u201cCanine monsters always open their mouths when running.\u201dLike any seasoned hunter who had lived through the era of destruction, he brought out a secret weapon prepared for this situation.The most effective weapon for catching canine monsters.\u2026 har!The sound of beans hitting each other in my hands.Blood Bean Cocoa Beans.It was chocolate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let him enter the food storage and take out as many chocolates as he likes. Just enough to carry.\u2019At that time, Bikir had been handed over the key to the food warehouse.In the cellar following Barrymore, Bikir obtained a bag of chocolate beans.\u2018In the past, the Lord personally led the senators in the family to subjugate the savages on the western front of the territory and reclaimed the vast jungles of the area as farmland. It is said that one grain of \u2018bloody bean\u2019 beans, a local speciality, can make 100 litres of chocolate.\u2019Bloody Bean. A magical bean that boasts a rich flavour that one bean can make 100 litres of chocolate.Bikir took out a single bloody bean from the sack he was wearing around his waist.And he looked at the hellhound, which had been very slow going around the water, and had opened its mouth in the middle of its run.The way it approached heading straight with its mouth wide open is as if he is asking for something to be thrown into his mouth.In the eyes of Bikir, an experienced hunter, it looked like that.\u2026 flick!A bloody bean that Bikir flicked with his thumb went right into the hellhound\u2019s mouth.And the response came right away.\u2026 Yelp!A hellhound swallowed something that flew into its mouth.The canine started to get affected immeditely.Cahang! Crack! acck!The hound started frothing from its mouth as it started to vomit, saliva, mucus, coming out of its mouth.It started shaking and convulsing as it fell downIts heart beat increased as if it was going to explode, and blood burst out of its eyes as a result.\u2018As expected.\u2019Bikir nodded his head.He was a fact known to all hunters who had gone through the era of destruction.That is the fact that canine monsters are weak to chocolate.The substances in chocolate beans are like poison to canine monsters.Even if it was a hound from hell, this was similar.\u201cLet\u2019s see. How were your symptoms? Vomiting of mucus, difficulty breathing, incontinence, diarrhea, increased body temperature, increased heart rate, loss of appetite, convulsions, seizures, severe agitation\u2026 \u2026 And death?\u201dBikir grabbed a blunt shortsword that day.Then, he walked towards the hellhound as the trees seemed to loom over it.\u201cThe blow to the stomach and heart must have come first. The liver is next.\u201dHowever, a hellhound\u2019s stomach, heart and liver are protected by ribs that are harder than steel.Bikir couldn\u2019t squeeze through that gap with the blunt shortsword that he currently had.In that case, it is best to aim for a place that is slightly off the ribs and still weakened by the chocolate.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 The answer is here.\u201dThe lower abdomen, which the hellhound\u2019s ribs can\u2019t cover, and the kidneys, which are overworked by the toxin from the chocolate,and were vulnerable.Bikir laid his shortsword vertcally and stabbed it hard.His blade was blunt, so he couldn\u2019t cut or penetrate, but it was enough to stab damage to hide, muscle, and kidneys beneath the flesh.Kang! I\u2019m sorry\u2026 \u2026The more the shock comes upon the kidney, the weaker the kidney and the stronger the toxin.Bikir cut off the last breath of the hellhound, which had become irresistible.Hellhounds are monsters of the canine family, and at the same time, they are monsters of the hell who roam around with the hellfire of the oil pits swallowed in their stomachs.If you don\u2019t kill it, you don\u2019t know when its vitality will become a threat again, like an ember reviving from the ashes.\u201cI\u2019ll have to look at the lights that went out again.\u201dBikir raised his shortsword and completely extinguished the hellhound\u2019s last spark of life.puck! puck! puck! Wow!With his blunt shortsword, there was no answer other than to beat it.yet.An amazing thing happened.Tsutsutsutsutsu\u2026 \u2026When the hellhound died, an intangible aura escaped from its corpse and settled in Bikir\u2019s body.What many people call \u201cexperience,\u201d or \u201ckarma\u201d,When this mysterious and magical energy obtained by killing monsters accumulates in the body, it leads to strengthening of the body.Bikir single-handedly defeated a high-ranking monster that children of his age could not dare imagine, and as a result, his body became even more powerful.In addition to the blessing of the Styx River, the experience gained from killing a hellhound was added.Bikir\u2019s body is now impervious to any amount of poison, magic, or other physical force.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 hmm. Are my bones thicker? I seem to have grown taller.\u201dThe shortsword in my hand became much lighter than before.Since the weight of the sword could not suddenly decrease, it must be said that his strength had increased.boom- boom-Other 8-9 year olds handle the swords as if wielding it with one hand, which is difficult to wield with both hands.However, there is still a long way to go before he regains his former strength.\u2018At this pace, I\u2019ll be able to recover all my strength before the coming-of-age ceremony.\u2019Bikir is only 8 years old now. The level is Sword Expert.The other Baskervilles are on the verge of becoming visible only after the coming-of-age ceremony.After the next seven years had passed, he was more than confident enough to regain the power of his previous life.\u2018Right now, if I get first place in the practical test, there\u2019s a reward.\u2019Bikir looked down at the hellhound\u2019s corpse with a satisfied expression.If the corpse of this monster, which is still hot, is brought to the family, it is a matter of course that it won first place in the practical evaluation.Going out of the boundary area could be a bit of a problem, but it\u2019s a rebuke to the guardian knights in charge of the role of the guide dog, and rather praise from the examinee\u2019s point of view.An 8-year-old child went out of the border area that even young dogs struggle with, and went to the forbidden zone to catch a dangerous grade B+ monster, and that too alone!Hugo\u2019s expression was already expected.\u2026 hehe!Bikir grabbed the hellhound by the tail and began to drag him away.The corpse of a monster is subject to gravity and different laws from the human world because its soul is held as a mortgage in the demon realm.Because of that, Hellhound\u2019s corpse was much heavier than it seemed, but Vikir\u2019s strength was different from that of a normal 8-year-old, so it didn\u2019t matter.Deodeuk-deuk-woodeuk!Bikir continued to move forward.It was an uphill road strewn with thorns, but it felt like a well-paved flower road.Now go down and submit Hellhound\u2019s corpse to the Guardian Knights and take the title of No. 1 in Practical Evaluation.And when he thought of the reward he would get, a smile formed on his lips.Bikir was waiting for a huge reward that he would never have dared to dream of in his lifetime, a treasure that no one even knows the real value of in this day and age.\u2026 \u2026 at that time.One of the factors stopping Bikir\u2019s steps is here. no, severalGrrrrr\u2026 \u2026The cries that flowed from the depths of the sea behind them.The burrow the roots are twisting, the howl coming from deep in the throat is getting closer.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 Oops.\u201dBikir put down the hellhound\u2019s corpse for a moment.He had forgoten.Hellhounds are monsters that live in packs.Yet.Yellow and red sulfur fires began to burn in the darkness of the sea of floods.Eleven Hellhounds came and surrounded Bikir.however.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dBikir just grinned, unfazed in the slightest.Rather, the hellhounds who faced that smile just shrank their bodies low and growled as if they were anxious.Do these dogs recognize a predeator ?It seems that even those who passed through the world of destruction and passed through another round of reincarnation could not wash away the smell of blood that was deeply embedded in their souls.Just like Bloody Mamba, the venomous snake who froze at the sight of Bikir in the cradle, it seems that the enemy and the Hellhounds of Black Mountain do not dare to act carelessly in front of Bikir, who reveals his life in earnest.Before long, Bikir opened his mouth.\u201cCome on guys. There are still a lot of beans left.\u201dBloody bean beans rattle at the waist.Considering the body that became stronger after catching one hellhound, the growth rate when all the hellhounds gathered here were caught\u2026 \u2026 he couldn\u2019t even guess.When the Bikir and the hellhounds were in such a tense confrontation.hehe\u2026 \u2026The ferocious hellhounds suddenly curled their tails between their crotches and began to retreat.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 ?\u201dBikir was a little surprised.A hellhound that once bares its teeth will never show its back, even if it dies.But now, the hellhounds were running away in blatant fear, only their backs were invisible.No matter how heinous the killing spree that Bikir spewed out was, he still had the body of an 8-year-old child, so it wasn\u2019t enough to get more than 10 hellhounds out.What then?What external factors could cause these hellhounds to run away with their tails down?Eventually, Bikir soon learned what it was.Grrrrr\u2026 \u2026The sound of spit and brimstone boiling.The owner of this district who makes all hellhounds out has appeared.Six eyeballs burning in the dark.Three heads poking out of the root hole of the sea.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 Did something like this live here?\u201dA top-notch monster that makes even Bikir look surprised.<Cerberus>Risk level: A+Size: 7mDiscovery Location: Le Rogue 7thridge-Aka \u201cHell\u2019s Guard Dog\u201dIt is not interested in the ghosts who want to enter hell, but the ghosts who want to get out of hell are immediately torn to pieces and made into rags.It lives deep in oil pits of hell where all the ghosts finally head, and leads to the ultimate of monsters of the canine species.The three-headed dog, which symbolizes hell itself, appeared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Has Cerberus already crossed over? Why did a guy who only lived around the 7th ridge come all the way here?\u201dAs the saying goes, the area where Cerberus was first discovered was the highlands of the Red and Black Mountains.But now, Cerberus is down to the lowlands of the first part of the ridge here.I don\u2019t know what brought him here\u2026 \u2026 .[Kreureung!]It was a pretty embarrassing situation for Vikir.\u201cI can\u2019t help it.\u201dVikir decided to flip all of his hidden paddles.There is no room to hide his pre-return skills.Fortunately, I had crossed the border quite a bit, so I didn\u2019t feel any stares around me.He doesn\u2019t even have Young Do Dog Guardian Knights, so he doesn\u2019t even have to fight while hiding his skills.\u2026 Flash!Vikir took out his shortsword and blew mana into it.At the tip of his sword, a gaseous aura that can only be created by those who have reached the advanced level of Sword Expert overflows.Low Expert = Wizard Circle 1Expert Intermediate = Wizard 2nd CircleAdvanced Expert = Mage 3rd CircleLower Grader = Wizard 4th CircleGraduate Intermediate = Wizard 5th CircleAdvanced Graduate = Wizard Circle 6Sword Master = Wizard 7th CircleThis is the general martial law formula.What burns at the tip of 8-year-old Vikir\u2019s sword is a dense gaseous aura that seems to turn into liquid at any moment.It symbolizes an expert advanced level, and it is a skill that corresponds to a whopping 3rd class in terms of magicians.Before he returned, he was about 20 years old.Vikir raised his mana and quickly moved his hand.The shortsword moves while drawing strange scars in the air.A trajectory shaped like a sharp tooth, it looked as if three teeth had been summoned in the air.Baskerville Type 3. A swordsmanship in which three teeth are drawn with a sword and driven into the opponent\u2019s neck.Vikir in his previous life had mastered this Baskerville formula up to the 4th formula, and was originally able to create four teeth.On top of that, he had even the mana and aura of a high-level Duator, so if you compare then and now, the level is shabby.But Vikir has another weapon.His small body and quick mobility, as well as his body hardened by the blessing of the River Styx, are just that.The pros are clear and the cons are clear.Vikir swung his sword and created three teeth.The child\u2019s hands and arms were small and short, so he couldn\u2019t create the \u2018fourth tooth\u2019, which was an organ in his previous life, but nevertheless, the gaseous aura and three teeth clearly extending from the tip of his sword were able to block Cerberus\u2019 claws well.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 ?\u201dVikir felt something strange.It is Cerberus that was too daunting even with the strength before the return, but is it possible to be an opponent with the body of an infant who is far behind the inaction at that time?This means that something is wrong on the Cerberus side as well.indeed.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 !\u201dVikir\u2019s keen eye caught something.If you look closely at the inside of Cerberus\u2019 side, you can see a dent.His movements were a little unnatural, so it was clear that he had several broken ribs.Even in the area where the fur was torn off, clear arrowhead marks were engraved.\u201cWho caught it?\u201dVikir laughed incredulously.Come to think of it, barbarians live on the other side of the red and black mountains.In the meantime, the barbaric tribes that the iron-blooded swordsman Baskerville and the prestigious mage have been harassing Morgue.If he was driven to this place by the backslidings of barbarians, it seems that Cerberus\u2019 situation is not very good.earth! Daang! Kang!Vikir gathered the aura that was scattered like a gas and continued to block Cerberus\u2019 claws and teeth.Every time the sword and teeth clashed, there was a sound of iron and bronze clashing, and sparks flew.[Kreureung! kong! damn!]Cerberus tries to bite Vikir by moving his three heads, but fails every time.\u201cI\u2019m kind of used to fighting triplets.\u201dnot that it isn\u2019t It is true that the three twins Hivero, Middlebro, and Lowbro\u2019s swordsmanship and trident tactics were inspired by Cerberus\u2019 fighting style.I\u2019m used to it because I was terribly bullied by the triplets during numerous performance evaluations in my previous life.Most of the numerous anomalous patterns were familiar.The triplets in the previous life were skilled and smart, so they learned Cerberus\u2019 attack patterns as if they were born with them, and Vikir is reminiscing about those days and dealing with Cerberus.Booung!Baskerville Type 1, sharp teeth bounce off Cerberus\u2019 teeth.kang!Baskerville Type 2, second tooth half lodged in Cerberus\u2019 neck.\u2026 Fu-wook!Baskerville Type 3, the third tooth strikes the second, driving it even deeper into Cerberus\u2019 neck.Vikir\u2019s Baskerville ceremony was clearly similar to the normal Baskerville ceremony, but was subtly different.The swordsmen who have passed through the age of destruction have something that the swordsmen of the previous era cannot copy.Existing swordsmanship theories of the peaceful era were completely reinterpreted through the era of destruction, and unnecessary flab, fat, and grease were drained to the limit.A sword that only moves to kill its opponent.Here, extreme practical experience was added.To put it in an analogy, the swordsmanship of the general world is like beef with good marbling, the swordsmanship of the Baskerville family is tough chicken breast, and the current swordsmanship of Vikir is like dried beef jerky.The essence of the extreme, that is the intention to kill the other person.Vikir\u2019s sword has a clear sense of purpose.\u2026 Fuck!The shortsword hit Cerberus\u2019 side.The gas-like aura exploded and Cerberus let out a scream.However, Cerberus, the guard dog of hell, does not faint at this level.The guy stabbed his claw into the empty part just below the trajectory the shortsword had drawn.Knock!Since I took the bones of my opponent, it is natural for me to sacrifice my own flesh.Vikir\u2019s back snapped.but. Surprisingly, his body, which was almost pickled in the River Styx, withstood Cerberus\u2019 claws.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 But twice would be impossible.\u201dVikir frowned.No gut burst, but several of his ribs were definitely broken.Besides, to make matters worse.Pacan!The short sword that couldn\u2019t withstand Vikir\u2019s aura eventually broke.\u201cthis.\u201dDifficulty. But a seasoned hunter always finds the best route even under these circumstances. that.\u201cIt\u2019s a series of 36 lines.\u201dThirty-six strategies devised by the head of the Leviathan family, who is the most knowledgeable in the art of war among the 7 families.Among them, the 36th is the circumstance sangchaek (\u8d70\u7232\u4e0a\u7b56).Hodak-Vikir quickly turned around and kicked the ground as hard as he could.Then Cerberus, who seized the victory, goes after such a vikir.[\u2026] Kreureung!]Cerberus, who attacked in an instant, would have been caught right away if it hadn\u2019t been for the huge wounds carved on his side.Vikir escaped the floodwaters, deeply grateful to the nameless savage tribe beyond the mountains.yet. You can see the boundary that Vikir has crossed.Unfortunately or fortunately, there were no guide dogs around.Vikir jumped over the barbed wire marking the border and ran.Cerberus smashed the barbed wire and stake right in front of his eyes and smashed them, then thrust three of his heads into Vikir\u2019s back.[Kong! kong! keong!]What could be more powerful than a hound chasing its prey?Cerberus opens his mouth in triumph.The distance now narrowed right in front of him. soon. Soon you will be able to chew the flesh and bite the bones of your prey.\u2026 thump!If only it hadn\u2019t been for the floor that suddenly went down.Pook-Suddenly, the floor collapsed.Cerberus threw himself into a pit covered with dry straw to make it indistinguishable from the plain.Falling into the trap, Cerberus lost his balance, but he landed on the ground and tried to jump back over the pit.\u2026 \u2026 But that was impossible.Fufufufufu!This is because numerous wooden spears stuck upside down on the floor stabbed her body.[Sweet!]A tearing scream erupted from each of Cerberus\u2019 three heads.At the bottom of the pit Vikir had dug, there were countless wooden spears protruding.Of course, most of the wooden spears could not pierce Cerberus\u2019 hard skin and broke, but some wooden spears penetratedCerberus\u2019 body and left fatal wounds.It was the lower abdomen on the inside of the side, where the arrowhead-shaped wound had been deeply dug.\u201cWelcome to the cradle of the sword.\u201dVikir briefly congratulated himself.Originally, this trap was made in preparation for being chased by other monsters such as hellhounds.They were installed just to impede movement or a little.Now I\u2019m making quite an unexpected income.but that\u2019s itBubbly\u2026 \u2026Cerberus snapped and broke the wooden spears stuck in his side and mouth, and his whole body trembled violently.A mad rage, but it was something else that made Cerberus\u2019 body tremble before that.Blood Bean!Vikir boiled the bloodbean beans and soaked the wooden spear in the water so that the energy soaked into the tip of the spear.Cerberus is also a canine monster. A large amount of chocolate energy permeates directly into the body through the blood of the wound.However, like a high-ranking monster, he did not fall down at once.Foam at the mouth, burning excrement dripping from the anus, and the thick smell of chocolate coffee.But even so, the three heads stand upright and stare at Vikir.Vikir shook his sack and took out all the Bloody Beans.Tick! tick tick! sudden!Beans fly towards Cerberus\u2019s three gaping jaws.Most of the beans thrown by Vikir landed in Cerberus\u2019s mouth, which was slowed down by his spear.As a result, Cerberus\u2019 movement gradually slows down.Dduduk! Pop!Eventually, Cerberus broke several wooden spears stuck in his body and drove Vikir to the corner of his pit.It was around the time the sack of Blood Bean Beans was empty.Cerberus has become a wreck, but he still has the strength to bite his prey by the neck with a final leap.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dKnowing that, Vikir, who had been driven to a dead end, looked extremely prudent.Before long, Cerberus moved.Vikir also lunges forward, clutching one of his wooden spears.\u2026 Pod!The wooden spear thrown by the hunter flew through the air and grazed Cerberus\u2019 body.The wooden spear, which seemed to be slightly stuck in the wound on the side, was pulled out helplessly.If it wasn\u2019t for the original arrow mark, it would have bounced off at all.Cerberus bared his teeth at Vikir.Cerberus\u2019 six eyes burned even more intensely at the thought that he would soon see the end of his prey that had been so annoying.\u2026 \u2026 but.Breetle!Cerberus, who was running, staggered his body for an instant.Cerberus, who suddenly lost his balance, panicked, but calmly took a step forward again.stagger-However, the second step was also slightly out of focus.The same goes for the third step. In the fourth step, it even nearly fell over with its legs bent in a strange direction, and in the fifth step fell.And in the sixth step, he dragged his body forward once, and in the seventh step, he fell flat on the floor without even crawling.Only seven times.The number of steps Cerberus took while approaching Vikir.That was his last.\u2026 Cheeky!The three heads, foam bubbling at the corners of their mouths, fell down and never moved again.Only then did Vikir sit down leaning against the cliff.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 There is something worth hiding.\u201dThe hunter\u2019s gaze is directed at the wooden spear he threw earlier.A wooden spear that just grazed Cerberus.However, the wooden spear is a little different from other wooden spears.Attached to the tip of the spear were two small but sharp spikes.At the end of this dry thorn, you can see that there is a dark aura.A snake\u2019s venom that makes it difficult to even walk.The Bloody Mamba\u2019s posion was still flowing through it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It will be discovered in the next 10 years or so.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 But I think it was an empty back then.\u201dBut now it is different.The smell of demons hidden behind the rotten smell.An inexperienced hunter might miss it, but Vikir managed to sense it.\u2026 clattering!Vikir broke the parched mound and slipped down into the crypt.Eventually, you will see a dungeon made of reddish soil and rocks.A vein of ruby protruded out of the mound, as if it was connected to the Le Rogue Mountain, a tributary of the Le Rogue Mountains.As he entered the darkness of the cave, he saw a deep, winding passageway.A place so dark and deep that you have to feel it with your hands.But surprisingly, the inside of the dungeon was wide and bright.There was a fairly spacious stone chamber, and a ruby stone the size of a fist protruded around it, emitting a red light.A stone chamber stained red like blood by the ruby light.Vikir looked at his own shadow that was cast on the wall of the stone chamber.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 Is it a dungeon with nothing?\u201dThe stone chamber was just empty.No, it wasn\u2019t quite empty.At the end of the place where Vikir\u2019s long shadow reached, two skeletons were scattered.A skeleton with cuts all over its body cut and broken as if it had been stabbed by a knife.Looking closely, the inside of the ruby-colored had marks of a fight.Judging by the marks, it must have been a very long time.Yet Vikir found a page of handwriting written on the side of the skeleton.[ First of all, it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t know my name. Just call me \u2018Gain\u2019.Do I really need to stain this paper with my name?After thinking about it several times, I write down a few characters for the purpose of preventingfuture generations from making the same mistake as me. ]It was an unusual diary from the start.Vikir continued to read the text, relying on the red light.After some time, Vikir noticed that these letters were written in a old script descended from the Baskeville family.\u201cIs he the ancestors of Baskeville?\u201dIt was a reasonable inference.[ This stone chamber is an ancient dungeon that has been talked about as a legend within the family.My brother and I found this place by chance, went through countless trials to explore it, andeventually reached this room.It turns out that this dungeon once had a fairly tough difficulty level.Although now it remains only as an empty and lonely crypt.And it is presumed that the person who wrote this memoir and the skeleton scattered here musthave been twin brothers.My brother and I killed countless monsters and arrived at this place.However, the last task we received in this stone chamber kept our brothers on their feet. For awhopping 3 years!Vikir raised his head.What is the \u201ctask\u201d they are talking about?The question was soon resolved.It was because I could see the writings engraved on the stone wall in the direction where the skeleton\u2019s skull was facing.[ One comes in, two come in, and one goes out. ]It was a strange riddle.Vikir looked at the notes again.[ My brother and I pondered over this gloomy phrase for a long time.However, considering that this dungeon has been passed down as a legend in the Baskevillefamily, the meaning is clear.We don\u2019t know what it means only one of us can achieve what he wants from this dungeon?We brothers who entered the dungeon.They were originally one when they were conceived in their mother\u2019s womb, but split into twowhen they came out into the world.And to get what they want out of this dungeon, they must become one again.Realistically, the bodies of the twins could not be joined as one, so they had to kill each other toremain as one. ]It is the custom of the Baskeville family to instigate rivalry between siblings.The two brothers started fighting each other for a long time, and the match ended with the deathof the younger brother.\u201cThen, does the younger brother here become \u2018Abel\u2019?\u201dCain and Abel.The older brother who had to kill his younger brother in order to be \u2018chosen\u2019.Vikir thought as he looked at the skeletons scattered on the floor.A skeleton that was almost weathered even in a windless stone chamber, no matter how long it had been dead.However, the content of the manuscript was quite unexpected.[ I killed my brother after a fierce battle. Now, I am the only one left in this stone chamber.However, despite this, there was no change in the stone chamber.A handwriting that gradually becomes colored with madness.The handwriting also became more and more crooked, and in the end, Vikir had to understand the meaning of the letters at an almost decipherable level.[ Even though it was obviously two to one, I didn\u2019t get anything!You can\u2019t get out without getting anything!nothing! nothing!However, as for the last handwriting, it was returned in a neat handwriting, probably written aftera long time had passed.I\u2019ll stop wasting time.If there are brave descendants who will visit this place in the distant future, I would like toyou to give up.get out of here right nowIt is said that nothing can be obtained in this devil\u2019s den, which only deceives and mocks people. ]In the end, what he wanted to say was clear.He passed through all the barriers and came here, but it was dog hair.And latecomers are also encouraged to go back the way they came from without losing their strength.\u2026 But Vikir thought differently.\u201cI\u2019m not a twin.\u201dDespite the fact that Vikir is not a twin, the content of the assignment is still valid.That means that Cain and Abel, who were here, misinterpreted the contents of the text.\u201cWhen I came in, I was one, but when you came in, there were two, so when you go out, you have to become one again?\u201dBaskeville looked at the cave behind him.It was a jet black without a single strand of light.And in front of it was a stone chamber where there was light.Before long, Vikir turned his head to look at the skull.What hangs over the end of the skull is its own shadow. shadow!\u201c\u2026 \u2026 Right.\u201dVikir raised his fist.Then he smashed the large ruby ore that lit up the stone chamber red with his fist and shattered it.Clink!When the ruby shatters, the faint magic within it also disappears.The inside of the stone chamber was plunged into darkness for an instant.OK.Ku-gu-gu-gu-gu-kwak!A strange thing happened.The stone wall on one side of the stone chamber had collapsed.The wall was so thick that the thickness alone could reach tens of meters.It is so large that you would never think of it as a door.Vikir nodded.The answer to the riddle was simple \u2018shadow\u2019.When you enter, you are completely alone in the passage of darkness, but the moment you enter the stone chamber illuminated by ruby light, the shadows separate.And when the ruby is removed and complete darkness comes, the shadow returns to the body.When they become one, the final stage of the stone chamber will be opened.Vikir cautiously reached out in front of him.Fortunately, the space beyond the stone wall was a flat, single road, and there were no traps.Cain and Abel would have sorted out the swarming monsters long ago, so all that remains is to check the dungeon\u2019s rewards.Before long, something cold touched Vikir\u2019s fingertips.It\u2019s the handle of a sword.The sword was firmly stuck vertically into the rock, and an inscription was inscribed in front of it.Vikir fumbled with his fingertips and read the words.\u2018Only the blood of the Baskevilles is this \u2018\u2026\u2019\u2019Will I be able to pull out.\u2019The text mentions the last name Baskeville and Carl\u2019s first name.And the moment he learned the name of the knife, a shock like a thunderbolt hit Vikir.\u201c\u2026 \u2026Was this an artifact that found here?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It is an old legend that few people believe in now.\u2018But the legend was true, and later this sword would fall into the hands of the demons.\u2019This forgotten artifact suddenly appeared on the battlefield one day and drove countless humans to their deaths.Even among the demons, the owner of this sword continued to change, and perhaps the number of demons far exceeded the number of people killed by this sword.\u2026 But now the situation is a little different.Baalzebub\u2019s artifact came into Vikir\u2019s hands.In my previous life, I was robbed by demons and didn\u2019t even know it was stolen, but that won\u2019t be the case now.buzz buzz buzz-The sword began to resonate with the mana emitted by Vikir. The sound of the wings of a fly is loud in my ears.Vikir stretched out his hand and caressed it, and the sword, Beazelbub, began to be absorbed into the palm of his hand as if it were part of Vikir\u2019s body.\u2026 Pod!As Vikir stretches out his hand for strength, black cracks from the artery side of his wrist.Beazelbub would thus hide quietly inside Vikir\u2019s body, and when he wanted, it would spring out and serve as a spare sword.However.Beazelbub is a strange sword made from the corpse of a demon constellation.This is not the end of this supernatural ability.\u2026 growl!As soon as Baalzebub settled inside Vikir\u2019s suddenly felt very weak.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 what is this.\u201dVikir was a little taken aback.In my previous life, he was used to starving for a week and eating everything in one meal.When he went out into the field, he often stayed in hiding drinking only water for a month.A warrior that has been trained so harshly can endure things like this easily.Even in a body of a child there was no way he would be this weak.\u2026 growl!Once more, his stomach twists as if in a fit of rage.Vikir realized that this extreme hunger was not normal.\u201cAre you asking for something?\u201dThat\u2019s right.Beelzebub agitated Vikir with the buzz of wings.sniff-Perhaps his sense of smell has also become sensitive, and he smells delicious somewhere.It\u2019s the smell of demons. An appetizing smell wafted from outside the dungeon.Vikir crawled out of the dungeon and walked into the forest.As he approached the border area and returns to where he came from, his smell grew stronger.The first thing he encountered was the corpse of a hellhound.Baalzebub didn\u2019t even call, but he stuck out first.As it should be, a hound that exposes its teeth without being ordered by its owner must be punished.But Vikir made an exception this time.Because the hunger he shared with it was so intense.\u2018Looks like he\u2019s starved for a long time.\u2019The corpse on which Baalzebub was embedded and the soil around it were very dry and twisted.No, perhaps it is because of Baalzebub\u2019s mad hunger that the entire Le Rogue Mountains are made up of dead trees and parched soil?Then, how much food did he need to supply to appease this in the future?\u201c\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dVikir shook his head and brushed away his thoughts.Baalzebub\u2019s power was enough to bear the price.yet.The Baalzebub that Vikir knew began to reveal its power.gulp- gulp- gulp- gulp- gulp- gulp-The Hellhound\u2019s corpse, Baalzebub stuck in the neck, began to suck blood at an astounding rate.Blood and gut juices enter Vikir through Baalzebub\u2019s awl pipe.The hungry was filled.\u2026 sparkle!Vikir noticed that one of Baalzebub\u2019s three eyeballs glowed exceptionally red.\u2018I got the skill.\u2019Yes. Vikir\u2019s intuition is correct.Baalzebub, a gluttonous fly, had the power to steal the other person\u2019s unique characteristics or specialties while alive.The width of absorption was close to infinity, and countless people were deprived of all the achievements they had made throughout their lives to Baalzebub and turned into incompetent people.Unfortunately, this is harmful , so there is no such ripple effect.Only 3 skills can be stolen from the opponent.Vikir\u2019s Baalzebub gained a skill by sucking the blood of a hellhound.<Baalzebub, a gluttonous fly>-1 slot: Bleeding \u2013 Hellhound (B+)-2 slot: none-3 slot: noneAn ability that is only manifested by Vikir\u2019s will.Whoever is stung by this awl will feel the full mortal power of the hounds of hell.In general, even shallow and minor wounds that do not bleed will always draw blood over time, and bleeding lasts much longer than normal wounds.Meanwhile.Jagged jagged-Baalzebub sucked the hellhound\u2019s corpse until it was almost mummified before it fell.The skill was taken away right away, but it seemed that he was simply hungry.Vikir also felt his hunger subside somewhat.\u2026 growl!But even so, he was still hungry.The delicious smell that passed my nose was still wafting from far away.Vikir hurriedly got out of the forest.Eventually, a familiar boundary line appears.cradle.You can see the space where the children of the Baskevilles take their exams.When he crossed the border, he saw a hole he had dug under a rock in the distance.Fortunately, it seems that the supervision of the guide dogs has not come yet.Well, no matter how \u2018cradle\u2019 it is, the area is quite large. The supervision of the guide dogs would not have reached all parts of the test site.Furthermore, since he was just sitting in the pit for a long time, it is clear that Vikir was already classified as a safe surveillance target and his surveillance was neglected.Vikir crossed the boundary and went down to the hideout and removed all the soil and fallen leaves that had been lightly covered.Before long, an appetizing piece of meat appears.Cerberus. It was spread out as it was when it died.buzz buzz buzz-Baalzebub, who smells the fat meat, is very fond of it and dies.The sound of the wings of a fly grew louder.Soon after, Baalzebub set his fangs into Cerberus\u2019 corpse and began to gorge himself on meat and organs.But Vikir stopped Baalzebub.\u201cWah- Whoa- This is proof of practical evaluation. If you damage it too much, it will be difficult to explain when you do an autopsy later.\u201dStill, Baalzebub doesn\u2019t care and pushes in from the snout.Vikir\u2019s expression turned grim.\u201cno!\u201dmatch!Vikir hit the back of his hand violently.He hit the back of his own hand.Keeing\u2026 \u2026Baalzebub finally noticed and removed the fangs from Cerberus\u2019 corpse.Vikir saw new blood and abilities running through the arteries on the back of his hand.<Baalzebub, a gluttonous fly> / Awl-1 slot: Burn (Fire) -Cerberus (A+)-2 slot: Bleeding \u2013 Hellhound (B+)-Slot 3: High-speed regeneration -Norbegicus the Rat (F)Is it because Cerberus is a more powerful monster?1 slot was occupied by the blood of Cerberus.Hellhound pushed to 2 slots.And absurdly, the 3rd slot had the blood of a rat.Perhaps under Cerberus\u2019 corpse, the bones and hides of a rat that had been eaten were strewn about.\u2018Looks like I can delete the previous skill if I catch a stronger monster.\u2019Vikir laughed as he saw that among the three arteries that pulsated on his wrist, the artery where the rat\u2019s blood flowed had shrunk in particular.For now, Vikir decided to leave it alone, as it would be better to have something rather than leave it empty.Above all, it was a great harvest to obtain the \u2018Burn\u2019 skill of Cerberus, the guardian of hell.Now, the person stabbed by this will be burned that never heals naturally by the flames of the oil world possessed by the hell watcher Cerberus.Once you get stabbed, you have to live with the burning pain until you die.Considering that one of the worst pains that humans can feel is burning pain, it must have been much worse than the bleeding skill that a hellhound possessed.\u201cNow I have everything I can get on this mountain.\u201dThere\u2019s not much to do now.Just relax like this until the end of the practical evaluation, submit the body of Cerberus to the guide dogs and receive first place evaluation, and that\u2019s it.And perhaps Vikir will be rewarded for this.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dVikir closed his eyes and checked his body.As a wizard, he had already accumulated 4 mana circles.The number of Baskeville teeth that can be drawn with his sword is three. No, maybe four now.This is the stage of looking at the beginning of a graduate from the highest level of sword expert.\u2018If it is evaluated lightly, it is the highest level of expert, and if it is evaluated generously, it is a beginner level graduate.\u2019In practice, it is right to see it as an expert because it is half lower than my ability.In his last life, no matter how much mana he accumulated and how skilled he was in combat, he couldn\u2019t draw more than 4 teeth because of the limitations of the swordsmanship he had learned.For reference, the current Hugo has 7 teeth, and the Hugo before returning knew a swordsmanship that could draw 9 teeth.Baskeville Type 9.This is a swordsmanship that only extends to the family head and his direct descendant, the eldest son who will succeed the family, and the bastard son who will assist him.It was a noble and sophisticated swordsmanship that was on a different level from the 4th formula that Vikir had learned.But now it\u2019s different.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 10 meals.\u201dBaskeville Type 10. ten teeth.The ultimate state that no Baskeville in this world could reach.A legendary swordsmanship textbook that contained the teachings of the first head of the family who were said to have subdued the demonic constellation belonging to the Seven Disasters in the distant past.Vikir knew where the treasure was.\u2018I don\u2019t have to go far.\u2019Unexpectedly, it is rotting in a very close place, among miscellaneous books that are so common and close that anyone can easily read them.who will give it to you?Hugo Le Baskevilles, the head of the Baskeville family.He will hand it over to Vikir himself.He couldn\u2019t even imagine how much the value of the job book he handed over was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Crossed the boundary line and entered the forbidden zone during practical evaluation. Successfully hunted down Cerberus, a monster of danger grade A+. That is all.\u201dIt\u2019s the second time he talking about, but it still sounded ridiculous.An 8-year-old child went out to the forbidden area and came back alive.Actually, this alone is great enough.Just being able to draw a map or listen to testimonies that help them guess the topography and ecosystem outside the Unsealed Zone is a tremendous achievement.However, this unprecedented 8-year-old child went into hell and returned to life unharmed, and even brought back Cerberus, the guard dog of hell!\u201c\u2026 \u2026 Cerberus is a high-ranking monster that even the family guardian knights feel burdened to deal with.\u201dHugo stroked his beard with a puzzled expression.However, the detailed report that followed was even more absurd.Hugo reread the report once and put down his reading glasses.\u201cHe lured Cerberus into a trap and stabbed him with his throat spear? Do you think this makes sense?\u201d\u201cOriginally, it was an object that was injured by barbarians, and there is also information that poison was applied to the throat, Lord.\u201d\u201cNo matter how injured it is, it is the same. What poison was strong enough to send Cerberus away? Where else did he say?\u201d\u201cthat is\u2026 \u2026 Nothing else was recorded in the hunting log. I was going to ask the young master, but he said he was tired and went right back to the dorm.\u201dAt Barrymore\u2019s words, Hugo put on a dazed expression for a moment, then chuckled.\u201cThe young man is already puzzled but information is power, and power is value. Self-worth is what you have to raise and protect.\u201dHugo turned his gaze back to the report.It is admirable that Vikir did not immediately reveal the poison that caught Cerberus, but it is also admirable that he did not take Cerberus\u2019 corpse directly to the guide dogs, but covered it with soil and concealed it until the practical evaluation was over.Deacon Barrymore admired.\u201cHis patience is truly amazing. When I was an eight-year-old, I would do anything to be praised by adults and respected by my siblings. If I had caught Cerberus at the age of 8, I would have turned it over to the Guardian Knights right away. To get praise and attention.\u201d\u201cHa. If I did, I would end up looking like old Santiago.\u201dHugo refering to a fisherman from a legend of the distant past.He went out to sea and caught a huge monster fish, but while he was tying the fish to a boat and dragging it, he met a group of sharks, took all his flesh, and returned home with only a huge bone.\u201cIf Vikir had caught Cerberus and started dragging that huge corpse around, he would have been the target of many brothers. He could have been killed if it wasn\u2019t enough that he was deprived of all his achievements.\u201dAfter hearing Hugo\u2019s words, Barrymore felt a chill running down his spine at the bloody family customs of the Baskevilles.\u201cTo be honest, I was very surprised. It is not a middle name of \u2018le\u2019 or \u2018la\u2019, but a talented person like this is born among the youngsters who have a middle name of Van.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m different from the previous family heads. Bloodline should not be considered important when raising hounds. There are ugly dogs of good blood, and there are good dogs of poor blood. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a son from an imperial woman or a son from a street prostitute. As long as you have enough talent and courage.\u201dHugo\u2019s eyes, muttering in a low voice, are looking out the window at the distant spire.His second son.Barrymore noticed what Hugo was thinking when he looked at the spire, who was in training at the top of the spire.\u201cIt is said that even among dogs of good blood, there are ugly ones. Will you understand?\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201dHugo waved his hand.\u201cIt fine. I\u2019m the only one who loses if I have to be upset because of my stupid son. I just need a diversion.\u201dHis gaze fell out of the window, this time to the report.Barrymore nodded his head when he realized his master\u2019s intentions.\u201cI\u2019ll call the Master Vikir.\u201d* * *It was several hours later that Vikir stood in front of Hugo.Hugo still did not beat around the bush.He just asked it.\u201cHow did you catch Cerberus?\u201d\u201cI put chocolate on his throat.\u201dIt was the same with Vikir.Single sentence and an immediate answer.There was no flab or grease in Hugo\u2019s conversation with Vikir.Hugo\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cIs it chocolate?\u201d\u201cChocolate is poison to canine monsters.\u201d\u201cHuh. Is that why you asked for chocolate the other day?\u201d\u201cyes.\u201dVikir gave a short answer.After thinking for a while, Hugo opened his mouth again.\u201cIf true, the value of the information is quite great. It will be useful when subjugating canine monsters. There will be many advantages in trade with the information guild when raising dispatch results.\u201d\u201cI think so too.\u201dThe corner of Hugo\u2019s mouth went up slightly at Vikir\u2019s nonchalant reply.Hugo asked in a presumably cold voice.He said, \u201cI heard that when the butler asked, he did not answer properly about hunting Cerberus.\u201d\u201cyou\u2019re right. Because he is not my master.\u201d\u201cThen who is your master?\u201dTo Hugo\u2019s question, Vikir answered again calmly.\u201cI belong to a family, so wouldn\u2019t the owner of the family be you?\u201dAt that, Hugo finally nodded his head and smiled contentedly.\u201cYou learned well. As a reward, the carcass of the monster you caught will belong to you in its entirety.\u201dCerberus, a monster of danger grade A+. Its corpse was worth the cost.Teeth and claws were used as weapons, organs and flesh as health food, and bones and hide as armor.There is nothing to throw away from the corpses of high-ranking monsters.It was a great reward to receive all of this in its entirety.Furthermore, Hugo gave Vikir another prize.\u201cSince you ranked first in both writing and practical skills, the expectations of your family are high. If there is anything you want, tell me.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you already hand over the corpse of Cerberus?\u201d\u201cThat is my idea. I want to hear what you want.\u201dVikir opened his eyes a little wide.Hugo\u2019s words were somewhat surprising.This is because he never had a history of asking his children for their thoughts.He just give orders. Who would ask a dogs what they thought?But these variables are always welcome.Thinking it would make things easier, Vikir voiced his opinion.\u201cI want to go into the Inner Library.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 !\u201dAt those words, Hugo\u2019s eyes narrowed.The Inner Library is a huge library located deep inside the fortress of the Baskeville family, and it is large enough to rival the largest library in the world, the House of Morgue.Hugo put his chin on his chin and pondered for a moment. It\u2019s rare for him.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 Hmm. Go all the way. It is a place that only those of the pure blood can enter. Did you know and ask?\u201dAt those words, Vikir widened his eyes.A look that he didn\u2019t know at all.\u2018I didn\u2019t know about it because I didn\u2019t have anything to go into the library in my previous life.\u2019Culture, swordsmanship, and other knowledge were enough to be provided in classes within the family.He lived content with the reality and did not show any desire to learn more.That was the dog\u2019s virtue and was tamed that way.\u2018\u2026 \u2026 I didn\u2019t know. If it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll just do it another way.\u2019Vikir quickly bit his foot. Well, it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s enough to sneak in under cover of night.But things turned out easier than expected.\u201cYou may go.\u201dHugo\u2019s judgment was quick.Before Vikir could put on a dazed expression, Hugo continued.\u201cI can\u2019t give you too much time. Will ten days be enough?\u201d\u201cAll it takes is one day.\u201dThere is no need alert Hugo by staying in the library for a long time.Hugo looked down at Vikir with a faint smile.\u201cWhat book do you want to read in just one day?\u201d\u201cI learned about \u2018family history\u2019 during a liberal arts class and just wanted to know more about it.\u201dHe just mentioned any book in moderation,but Hugo must have liked Vikir\u2019s answer quite a bit.\u201cFamily history. Feel so good. It\u2019s good to be proud by studying the honorable history of your family.\u201dIf you see him talking about pride that he didn\u2019t even mention.Hugo even recommended a book for Vikir to read.\u201cThe depths of the Inner Library , If you look in the middle row of the library in the 6th control area, there is a swordsmanship manual called \u2018Baskeville 6th Form\u2019. Read it.\u201dVikir couldn\u2019t believe his ears when he heard that.The world\u2019s Hugo recommends a swordsmanship textbook?4 forms, which is the limit that Van\u2019s surname can go up to, how many 6 meals?Baskeville sword forms.This swordsmanship, which allowed him to draw six teeth, could only be mastered by the elite among executives and direct descendants within the family.Hugo has now allowed it to Vikir. Even if it\u2019s a very brief reading.Considering that the current Hugo had seven teeth, and the Hugo before the return knew how to produce nine teeth, Hugo\u2019s current treatment was truly unconventional.Compared to the four forms Vikir had learned before returning, 6th was a powerful swordsmanship that was on a different level.But.Vikir, was aiming for something else, would not be very impressed.\u2018\u2026 \u2026 It\u2019s just meat.\u2019A foolish idea that would make others faint if they heard it.But I\u2019m not stupid enough to go out of the way to show it off.\u201cthank you. I will definitely read it and live up to your expectations.\u201dVikir bowed his head and thanked Hugo.He was a very humble and polite greeting, seemingly impeccable.Of course, if he had known what kind of evil lurked inside him, Hugo would have stopped Vikir even if he had to burn the library.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dThinking that he has finished all his business, Hugo just indifferently turned his head away.Having obtained access to the Inner Library, Vikir greeted politely until the end and then turned around and left the room.And.He set out on his way to the most precious treasure in all of the Baskevilles.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After drawing the fourth tooth, I had to break the flow of mana once. That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t create a fifth tooth!\u201dVikir finally felt his thoughts clear up.It took only about 3 hours to understand and memorize the knowledge he had gained.Of course, it was thanks to the experience accumulated over and over while staying on 4 fangs for almost 20 years.Having memorized the entire book, Vikir soon closed it.It\u2019s good that he figured out the way to go over to 4th\u00a0fang and go to 5th and 6th\u00a0fang, but in fact, that\u2019s not the real purpose of being here today.Vikir returned to the very beginning of the Inner Library.It was a space that even knights who stood guard and servants who cleaned the library could pass through.\u201cwhat? young master. Why did you come out again?\u201d\u201cWhat have you forgotten? We will bring it to you.\u201d\u201cIf you are hungry, shall we bring you a meal?Servants come to talk kindly.Judging from the subtle respect and fear imbued in his gaze, it seems that the rumors of this practical skills evaluation have already spread.But Vikir shook his head.\u201cI\u2019m done with my errands.\u201dThe servants were also surprised by those words, and even the guardian knights who were standing guard were surprised.\u201cAlready?\u201d\u201cWatch a little more and then come out.\u201d\u201cDo you still have a lot of time left?\u201dEveryone didn\u2019t say anything, but they looked very sorry.It must be so.To refuse the swordsmanship textbooks that were like treasures stored deep in the Inner Library and to leave them out in a matter of hours.It is understandable that they feel sorry for them, as these are valuable collections that are worth reading even at the risk of their lives.Even if it was Vikir before the return, it would have been the same.But Vikir was unconcerned.\u201cBefore I leave, I plan to read other books as well, so stop worrying and do what you have to do.\u201dat the same time. Vikir headed to the shallowest floor of the Inner Library, where miscellaneous books were collected.Some of the knights, who were shining a watchful eye, whispered while watching such a Vikir.\u201cIf it were me, I would have read the swordsmanship textbooks in the depths. I must have memorized it like crazy.\u201d\u201che is still young and doesn\u2019t know its full value. He would regret it for the rest of your life when you get older.\u201d\u201cI have to tell the others not to worry. It\u2019s because he is reading insignificant miscellaneous books like that.\u201dHowever, if they had seen Vikir\u2019s expression back to them, they wouldn\u2019t have thoughtlessly talked like that.Vikir was rummaging through the books with a zeal.Nobody cared about these books and they were a jumbled mess on this dusty bookshelf.Vikir searched slowly and painstakingly.And he was able to find what he was looking for within a few hours.The edge of the library, a place that everyone could see, but everyone passed by without thinking.There was an old book stuck there.It seems that there is no preservation magic applied because it is quite dusty.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dVikir stood for a long while, staring at the title of the book.<Lurking Ambush>A basic book of type 1 that even the children of the Baskevilles did not care to read.An old book classified as a swordsmanship textbook.But who in this world knew the value of this book?Only Vikir, who had lived through the age of destruction, knew.This book is the Baskerville\u2019s greatest treasure!Vikir pulled out the book.It seemed to have been on the bookshelf for a very long time, and at first it did not come out well.It wasn\u2019t until after I pulled out and put away a few books that were blocking my way that it was pulled out and revealed to the world.\u201c\u2026 A lurking ambush.\u201dHaving succeeded in extracting the book, Vikir carefully swiped it with his hand.And he turned the page.Pararak-He quickly turned through the pages.And soon, the reason why this book was classified as a miscellaneous book was revealed.A torn page can be seen in the middle of the book.A sparse book, as if a few pages had been knocked out.Torn marks are evident on every important page. Of course, the contents were cut off and not connected.Because of this, no one could understand the contents of this book, and as a result, it must have been classified as such an insignificant miscellaneous book.but.\u2018\u2026 \u2026 I know.\u2019Vikir. he memorized what was written on the torn pages of this book.Because the memories of participating in the \u2018Operation to Recapture Torn Pages\u2019 or \u2018Operation to Restore Missing Teeth\u2019 were still clear in his head.At that time, the hound that crossed countless lines and collected all the pages that had been torn and lost was Vikir van Baskeville!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why did he think it was enough at the time?\u201cIt was a stupid \u2026\u2026 life.\u201dBikir gritted his teeth.Before the regression, Hugo had used all these things that Vikir and the hounds had asked for to provide for himself and his two sons.Hugo\u2019s cultivation had risen beyond the seventh degree to the ninth, and the honor of Ironblade Baskerville had soared.The blood of the hounds and the flesh of the dead lay beneath him.\u201cThat will not happen in this life.\u201dVikir closed his eyes and recalled the pages in his mind.Everything that had been written on those lost pages was in his mind.Nevertheless, the reason why the pre-regression Vikir couldn\u2019t go beyond the fourth degree was because he didn\u2019t know the original.The pages he remembered were sparse, only seven pages at most.Without the original, they were useless.\u2026\u2026 But not now.In Vikir\u2019s hands now was the original copy of the \u2018Lurking Ambush\u2019 sword technique!Though seven pages had been torn out, the missing information was still perfectly clear in Vikir\u2019s mind.The experience of fighting through layers of siege, sometimes with no way to keep the pages themselves intact, and carrying them in his mind, shines through.Soon, Bikir began to peruse the book.\u2026\u202610The first foot of the decadal eclipse coincides with the solar eclipse. The moment a sword is drawn and shows aggression in its first trajectory, all swordplay from then on has an inherent limitation\u2026\u2026Indeed.If an uninformed person read this book, they would treat it as a hodgepodge of nonsense.Ten formulas, what the hell does that sound like?But as he recalls the contents of the torn pages and fills in the blanks, what was once a mishmash of bluster and rhetoric becomes the puzzle pieces of a masterpiece.Vikir notices that the gaze of his surroundings has completely disappeared, and he moves his body accordingly.Four teeth, honed to the limit before his regression. After that, the story begins in earnest.The book explained how to reveal the fifth tooth, how to make the sixth tooth, how dangerous the seventh tooth was, when to reveal the eighth tooth, if the ninth tooth actually existed, and what the tenth tooth was.Even though he didn\u2019t have enough mana and his body was immature for an eight-year-old, he would surely be able to recreate all of these things someday.\u2018\u2026\u202615 years old. Within it, you will regain all of your pre-regression powers.\u2019Of course, it doesn\u2019t end there.After that, you will go beyond the fifth degree, to the sixth and seventh degrees, which you were unable to reach before the regression.The stain of the past, the time when you were pushed aside and ignored by your superiors because you didn\u2019t have the aura of a Gradualist, but didn\u2019t have the swordsmanship to match, will never have to happen again.\u201cI\u2019ll start by memorizing the contents of the book.As soon as the memorization is finished, the book will disappear from the world forever.Then Hugo won\u2019t find it, and he won\u2019t have to make nine teeth.Pretty sweet revenge for an eight-year-old, don\u2019t you think?Vikir laughed, albeit dryly.He still had more than twelve hours to go in the Mansang Library, no matter how little time he took.For the children of Baskerville Street, it would not be too difficult to memorize a small book in that time.Half a day from now.Unaware of what she would become afterward, Vikir read the book.\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.And then, at exactly 11 hours and 50 minutes from now.\u2026boom!A small fire broke out in the shallowest part of the Mansang Library, in the compartment where the jobbers were gathered.No injuries. No fatalities.Damage was minimal, with one tome burned to the ground.It was a small enough incident that even the servants shrugged it off.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was the Baskerville Fourth, my specialty before regression.But.\u2026Pot!Vikir\u2019s hand drew one more sharp trajectory, beyond the Baskerville Fourth.The Fifth Tooth. It was a little smaller and blunt, but it was definitely a fifth tooth.Baskerville Fifth.And there it was, unsteadily recreated in Vikir\u2019s hand!\u201c\u2026\u2026in the world.\u201dBikir repeated the gesture he had just made several times.All with success.The trajectory of the sword was not quite right, given the child\u2019s small hands and short arms, but it was there nonetheless.The fifth tooth was growing.\u201c\u2026\u2026 where\u2019s the knife?\u201dIf I had a knife right now, I would have tried to aura it.But it\u2019s unlikely there\u2019s a knife in the closet.But that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t unleash Beelzebub from his slumber in the artery of my wrist.Well, whatever.I was so happy I could cry.Something hot rises up in my chest and kicks me in the throat.Bikir desperately tried to calm this overwhelming feeling.\u201cNow, as long as I have the mana to support me, I can definitely ascend to the level of my previous life.In terms of swordsmanship alone, he had already mastered something much stronger and more refined than his previous life.His swordsmanship was not limited to the fifth level, but could be enhanced to the tenth level, so his future possibilities were endless.Vikir closed his eyes and checked the mana in his body.The mana hall that had been enlarged by the Styx River was still slowly accumulating mana.Although it was impossible to determine the exact level of his cultivation, it was clear that his cultivation had risen to the next level.\u201c\u2026\u2026Graduator!Vikir jumped from Sword Expert to Gradient.With the ability to create a liquid aura at the tip of their blades, Graduates are a far cry from Sword Xperts.Instead of just the tip, graders can envelop the entire blade in an aura that is liquid, dense, and quite malleable in shape.When the liquid aura blade of a Gradient collides with the gaseous aura blade of a Sword Expert, the result is a dominance relationship that is as clear as water vapor colliding with water.Gradients are combatants whose physical prowess exceeds human limits.Their numbers drive the stature of a House and, by extension, the military might of the Empire.Vikir reached this level at the age of 30 before his regression.\u2026\u2026After the regression, Bikir is now only 8 years old.That\u2019s a huge step up from where he was before.A level that most swordsmen can only dream of reaching in their lifetime.As a mage, he\u2019s probably on par with a fourth-circle master.Perhaps in the entirety of the Baskerville family\u2019s nearly one hundred years of existence, there would be no one else of his age who had achieved this level of accomplishment.\u201cIn addition to \u2026\u2026. The atmosphere of swordplay has definitely changed.\u201dThe sword technique that Vikir had been using before was the \u2018Stabbing Fang\u2019 sword technique, which was basically what the hounds of the Baskervilles were trained in.Stabbing Fang Sword Technique. Four of them.Vikir had pierced through countless defenses with his four fangs, which pierced the enemy\u2019s heart like an awl.But the stabbing fangs were dangerous.While you can quickly become strong enough to use in combat, there are clear limits to your growth.In exchange for the certainty of killing your opponent, you\u2019re also taking on a lot of risk.It is this \u2018stabbing fang\u2019 swordplay that could be taught to hounds for use as a discard card.However, there is something different about the swordsmanship Bikir has learned this time.It\u2019s called the Lurking Ambush, and it\u2019s sinister and painful, and it moves slowly, without revealing its power or aggression.The melody of the sword seems graceful and dignified, as if nothing is going on.But underneath it all lies a malicious intent to inflict the worst pain on the opponent.Once you\u2019ve succeeded in stabbing, you\u2019ll be met with an unrelenting barrage of brutal combo attacks that will make you feel like you\u2019d be better off dead.A frenzied onslaught, while still being able to protect oneself, is the perfect swordsmanship of this entire school, the Lurking Ambush.\u201cPerfect for hiding power.\u201dVikir muttered quietly.At first glance, the Dosari Ambush Strike bore a striking resemblance to a stabbing fang.So it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to hide their swordsmanship.After all, it\u2019s called \u2018ambush\u2019 in the first place.Bikir glanced around, making sure that no one was watching.His heart was pounding with the exhilaration of reaching a higher level.Buzzing.The sound of a fly\u2019s wings in his ears.I glance down at my wrist and see Beelzebub pointing the tip of a black awl at me.\u201cGet in there.\u201dBikir rebuked Beelzebub harshly so that he would not dare to show his teeth.On the other hand, he was coldly calculating the extent to which this Beelzebub would affect his current performance.Vikir van Baskerville.Age 8.A swordsmanship that can reliably reveal four teeth, and an aura that has materialized to the level of a dilute liquid.Combine that with the battle-hardened experience of his previous life, the fifth tooth that he can unsteadily draw, and the power of the magic sword Beelzebub, which can absorb the skills of monsters, and he\u2019s more than capable.\u2018If I put my mind to it, I should be able to take on any Gradient intermediate.A 100% chance of assassination, a 50% chance of hand-to-hand combat.\u201c\u2026\u2026The question is, how far do you reveal your skills?\u201dWho\u2019s going to believe you when you say you\u2019re a grader at the age of eight?It would be foolish to show off your skills.In the real world, you\u2019re supposed to keep 30% of your power hidden.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dBikir paused for a moment to consider the appropriate behavior for an eight-year-old child.It didn\u2019t take him long to come up with an answer.Just enough to build up Hugo\u2019s anticipation, but not so much as to put his enemies on edge.You don\u2019t have to hide your power and live in fear.Rather, it\u2019s the right amount of power that gives you a chance to slip under Hugo\u2019s radar.\u201cA provincial assignment, for example, or a place at the Academy.As soon as Vikir leaves the library, he will have to report his findings to Hugo.And he\u2019s already done the math on how to position himself on the proof table.And now.Vikir took a pair of reading glasses from his pocket and stared at the window for a long time.Tsutsutsutsuts\u2026\u2026The cover of the \u2018Lurking Ambush\u2019 swordsmanship manual gradually turned black under the harsh light of the magnifying glass.Crackle!Soon, embers.Vikir stares down at the burning book.With that, the sword book containing the ten Baskerville formulas was gone from this world forever.It remained only in Vikir\u2019s mind.In the distance, he heard servants scurrying about.\u201cWhat is that smell!\u201d\u201cSniff, sniff, it\u2019s Jasser Khan!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not even a preservation spell, ugh!\u201dThe servants rushed over with buckets of water and were met by an apologetic Bikir.\u201cSorry. I left my magnifying glass everywhere\u2026\u2026. If it\u2019s something that must be reported, I\u2019ll be sure to tell the butler.\u201dThe servants waved their hands in dismissal.\u201cAh, well, that\u2019s not something for the Master to apologize for.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s our fault for not keeping you straight.\u201d\u201cAt least it\u2019s a good thing we\u2019re in a place with a bunch of janitors, hehe.\u201dThe servants seemed to take note of the \u2018if it must be reported\u2019 part of Vikir\u2019s words.Vikir looked at the ashes on the floor.\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t worth much, so I suppose it\u2019s better to pretend it never happened, and as you all know, the butler is quite busy these days with the ruby mine dispute with the Morg family, so who has time for such a trivial matter?\u201dThe servants nodded eagerly at that.\u201cAha! Yes, that\u2019s what I thought.\u201d\u201cWell, we lowlifes always want to make our masters feel comfortable.\u201d\u201cAs long as you look the other way, we\u2019re fine.\u201dEven they are glad to be spared the annoying report.\u201cI see. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have a lot of work to do cleaning up the storeroom, but I\u2019ll make sure the burned books are filled with appropriate transcriptions since I remember the contents.\u201dBikir made sure she was finished and turned away.\u201cYou are a good man. You\u2019ve thought of the servants, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll tell the others the story.\u201cHuh! You should tell them about the book!\u201cJust praise her, she\u2019s a good girl and makes a good impression!Your hearing has become more acute as you\u2019ve gotten better.I could hear the servants chattering softly behind me, but I didn\u2019t pay much attention.She needed to practice how to respond to Hugo\u2019s summons as soon as she left the library.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Vikir of his past life had been almost as old as Hugo now.\u201cA little bit.\u201d\u201cHo-ho.\u201dHugo\u2019s eyes light up.He\u2019s only been in the library for a day, and he can\u2019t possibly have gained anything.Most of the other Baskervilles his age are just getting their feet wet with mana and haven\u2019t even had a chance to play a real game yet.Under such circumstances, what could a child of only eight years of age possibly get out of seeing a high-level sword book?But Hugo looked at the son in front of him, who he didn\u2019t even know how many times he\u2019d been born, with an unexplained sense of anticipation that even he didn\u2019t know the source of.\u201cWhat did you feel and understand in the library?\u201d\u201cIt was, um\u2026\u2026 warm, and\u2026\u2026 pointy, and\u2026\u2026 sharp, and\u2026\u2026 squishy, and\u2026\u2026 squishy? Something like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHugo ran a hand through his hair for a moment.A child\u2019s answer is always hard to understand.But could it be the intuition of a master? Hugo suddenly understood something in Vikir\u2019s string of words.\u201c\u2026\u2026No way.\u201dHugo shook his head weakly, even as he muttered to himself.Aura.A sign that one had truly entered the world of swords.A realm that no ordinary swordsman would ever enter, not even in death.A level that even the prodigies of Ironblade Baskerville could only reach at the age of fifteen by training nonstop.That is the realm of the \u2018Sword Expert Beginner\u2019.Hugo frowned once more.A child of only eight years old. What was he expecting now?And yet.Hugo couldn\u2019t take his eyes off his son\u2019s Maalgan face in front of him.What if.The anticipation of what might be made Hugo impatient and forced him to open his mouth.\u201cCan you show this father what \u2026\u2026 it is?\u201dAll humans in Baskerville are reluctant to reveal their true prowess to one another.It\u2019s almost instinctive, even among parents and siblings.That\u2019s why Hugo chooses a cautious tone, even when dealing with his 8-year-old son.But Hugo\u2019s worries are dispersed so easily by Bikir\u2019s cheerful answer.\u201cOf course.\u201d* * *Baskerville Street\u2019s performance hall.A small child stands alone in the center of this wide-open plain, surrounded by a crowd of people.Vikir\u2019s eyes are closed as he holds a short sword long enough to match his size.When Hugo decides to test Bikir\u2019s level, a crowd of people flock to the stage to watch the spectacle.\u201cDid he say he was underwater for seven minutes in the Styx?\u201d\u201cWell, he strangled two venomous snakes in their cradles.\u201d\u201cAnd for this practical, he\u2019s captured a Cerberus.\u201dSurprisingly, Hugo didn\u2019t deter the onlookers.He just stares at Vikir in the center of the stage.Deacon Barrymore, standing beside Hugo, asked.\u201cMy lord. How do you plan to test your master\u2019s skills?\u201d\u201cI plan to pit him against a \u2026\u2026 worthy fiend.\u201dHugo\u2019s eyes were cold.To unleash a demon against a mere eight-year-old.Next. Vikir\u2019s test animal arrived.The creature brought by the Guardian Knights was a large, green-skinned monster.<OrcDanger Rating: CSize: 2 metersFound in: Enemy and Black Mountains LowlandsA species designated as a pseudomorph due to its human-like appearance and intelligence.Due to their strong bodies, low intelligence, and excellent fertility, they live in groups and are no less dangerous than barbarians.Orc. A demonic creature with combat strength comparable to that of four or five unarmed adult men.Their entire bodies are made up of lean muscle, and they are naturally strong, immune, and resilient.Captured alive by Baskerville, this orc was ready to hate and rage against the entire world, as he had once been a member of a warlike tribe.The people around him began to murmur.\u201cHmph. To say the least, an orc is a bit\u2026\u2026. for an 8-year-old.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s an orc, you\u2019d have to be at least 15 years old to deal with it.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure the guardian knights will step in.\u201dEven if they were Ironblooded Baskervillians, most of them didn\u2019t understand this matchup.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dBut Hugo didn\u2019t say anything, and the match went ahead.And then.\u2026Clang!The orc was freed from his restraints and released into the center of the arena.Pushed back by the spears and swords of the Guardian Knights, the orc made his way to the center, drooling, teeth and gums bared.There stood Vikir, sword in hand.[Kaaaah!]The orc lunged at Vikir with both hands outstretched.An eight-year-old toddler, thinking it would be an easy kill, and caught off guard.But Bikir ducks low and avoids the orc\u2019s two hands.It was a skillful move, capitalizing on the difference in weight and height.\u201cHuh?\u201dHugo\u2019s eyes widen in amusement. The other Baskervilles\u2019 gazes were similarly amused.But before the surprise could sink in, Bikir connected with his next move.Bam!He spun around, sword in hand.He may be an 8-year-old child, but he weighs a lot.Vikir\u2019s full weight was on the blade, and it sliced right through the orc\u2019s wrist.[Grrrrr!?]The orc didn\u2019t realize what had happened for a moment.It\u2019s understandable, as the opponent in front of him suddenly disappeared, and his wrist was sliced off.But before he could realize it, the next reality hit him hard.After slashing the orc\u2019s wrists and slipping out from under his groin, Vikir cut the orc\u2019s ankles as well.Thud!By the time the orc realizes that his wrists have been cut off, his ankles have been sliced off and he has fallen to the ground.A hush falls over the area.Everyone in Baskerville stared wide-eyed.\u201c\u2026\u2026 He\u2019s eight years old?\u201d\u201cHow is that physical, he looks like an old man?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe he can do that without raising his mana. What was I doing at that age\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe number of people surrounding the rehearsal hall grows by the hour.Even the guardian knights and servants have come to watch.But.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHugo is the only one who remains speechless.Of course, Vikir understood Hugo\u2019s reaction.\u2018You haven\u2019t shown me what you\u2019ve uncovered in the library yet, I suppose.\u2018What you just did to the orc\u2019s wrists and ankles was really just physical.You haven\u2019t even shown me what you\u2019ve learned in the library yet.And now.Vikir took a deep breath and flicked his sword lightly.It\u2019s a fairly heavy short sword for a child to hold, but in Vikir\u2019s hands, it swings like a puppy grass.As if that weren\u2019t amazing enough, Bikir pulled off another stunning move.\u2026Pow!The tip of the blade glows faintly.Everyone in Baskerville, realizing the identity of the light, gasped in unison.\u201cAura Blade!\u201dThe gaseous aura that symbolized the Sword Expert.It was emanating from the tip of Vikir\u2019s blade like a ghostly fire.The aura crackled as if blood was being burned for firewood.An emblem of the Baskervilles, a concentration of life force.The orc instinctively recoils in fear and backs away.He tries to heal the wounds on his wrists and ankles with the orc\u2019s unique skill, Rapid Regeneration.<Binge Fly \u2018Beelzebub\u2019> / Awl-1 slot: Burn \u2013 Cerberus (A+)-2 slot: Bleed \u2013 Hellhound (B+)Slot -3: Fast Regeneration \u2013 Norvegicus (F)Unfortunately, this was not possible due to the power of Beelzebub in Vikir\u2019s body.The Hellhound\u2019s Bleed skill overpowered the Orc\u2019s Rapid Regeneration skill.Now the Orc would feel the full mortal force of the Hellhound\u2019s teeth.Shallow, minor wounds that would normally not bleed will surely draw blood in time, and will bleed for much longer than normal.If you slit your wrist or ankle, it\u2019s a no-brainer.Gulp\u2026gulp\u2026gulp\u2026gulp\u2026The blood on the shortsword slowly disappears.The Shortsword, imbued with the power of Beelzebub, lusted after the Orc\u2019s blood like a monkfish, and the Orc was forced to offer it up as a tribute over and over again, unable to resist.And in that situation.Boom!Vikir\u2019s sword swung.And all those gathered in the ballroom saw.A single, ghastly fang emerging from thin air.The first ceremony of Baskerville.A single \u2018stabbing fang\u2019 appeared and sank deep into the nape of the orc\u2019s neck.Naturally, the orc\u2019s breathing was instantly cut off.With the agony of burning in hell.Vikir displayed the kind of unfiltered innocence one might expect from a 15-year-old in Baskerville.Naturally, words were spoken around him.\u201cCrazy. I didn\u2019t even feel mana when I was eight.\u201d\u201cI could barely form a ball of mana in the palm of my hand.\u201d\u201cThat kid looks like a perfect Expert Beginner, holy shit, is that even possible?\u201dEight years old, when the youngest Sword Expert ever was 14.This was unheard of even in Baskerville, a place of sword geniuses.Deacon Barrymore said with a mixture of shock and amusement.\u201c\u2026\u2026chu, congratulations, my lord. A rare genius has emerged, a triumph for the family.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Hmm.\u201dHugo nodded, expressionless.But Barrymore looked. The corner of Hugo\u2019s mouth, hidden beneath his mustache, twitched upward.He could never get enough of his children\u2019s praise, so he chimed in a little more.\u201cIt is an orc who can hold his own against four or five full-grown men and not be overpowered. My God, an eight-year-old killing an orc like that with such ease. There will never be another genius like that in any family in the empire\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHmph. Enough, butler.\u201dHugo interrupted Barrymore as if he were a stranger.Then he opened his mouth with an uncomfortable expression.\u201cApparently, the orcs are a little strange.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cOrcs are characterized by their great regenerative powers, but that guy just lost a lot of blood. A sudden loss of blood in large quantities inevitably dulls them. Was that Bikir guy\u2019s sword poisoned or something?\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s unlikely, it\u2019s just an ordinary sword that was checked and handed over by the Guardian Knights.\u201d\u201cHmph. Then the orc must have been weakened a lot.\u201dThe man was never one to take compliments lightly.Barrymore smiled faintly and shrugged.\u201cWhatever. It was true that Baskerville had a rare genius on its hands.A young warrior who, at the tender age of eight, had become a perfect Sword Expert beginner.When everyone, including Hugo, was quite surprised by this accomplishment.\u201cWait a minute.\u201dVikir caught everyone\u2019s attention.Hugo started to turn away, but stopped and looked at Bikir.Their gazes locked together.Vikir spoke in a low voice.\u201cIs there anything bigger than an orc?\u201dHe asks and doubles back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You\u2019re at the age where you need to get your hands dirty.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t the right thing to say to an eight-year-old, but it made sense, at least within Baskerville.Hugo continued.\u201cIt seems that the orcs from far away are not good enough for my son\u2019s castle. Are there higher beasts in your family\u2019s foraging grounds?\u201dYou\u2019d think they\u2019d find a better bug in the bug bowl.But in the Baskervilles\u2019 collection, every single one of them is an abomination.They\u2019re no match for an eight-year-old.Knowing this, no one, including Deacon Barrymore, speaks easily.Hugo, unable to bear the silence, spoke first.\u201cCome to think of it, isn\u2019t there an object that you captured as an experiment when you were exterminating the barbarians?\u201d\u201cYes, \u2026\u2026. There is only one left.\u201dDeacon Barrymore answered matter-of-factly.Hugo smirked.\u201cIt must be weak from not being fed for so long.\u201d\u201cHa, but they\u2019ll be just as fierce, I\u2019m afraid, and not much of an opponent for one who\u2019s just turned eight years old\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWell, if he does, the Guardian Knights will stop him, and that\u2019s the least of the butler\u2019s worries.\u201dHugo waved his hand dismissively at Deacon Barrymore\u2019s concern.His deliberation was brief, his decision even shorter.Soon, the Guardian Knights were pulling Vikir\u2019s opponent from the depths of the cellar.Thump, thump, thump, thump.The earth shook faintly.Then, a gigantic creature began to emerge, wearing a variety of heavy cuffs and restraints.It had a short neck, two arms and legs, grotesquely twisted teeth, weighed over 400 kilograms, and stood four meters tall.<TrollDanger Rating: CSize: 4 metersFound in: Red and Black Mountains, Ridge 2-A cannibal with a massive physique and a vicious mind. They are mostly responsible for the disappearance of Huazhen people who enter the mountains.Possessing inscrutable regenerative powers, they do not understand the concept of mortal wounds and never die unless their throats are completely severed.A green-skinned giant goblin.Sticky saliva oozes from its severed gums, torn lips, and protruding fangs.[Grrrrr-grrrrrr!]The troll rattled the chains and heavy lead weights around his neck, wrists, and ankles.It looked like it had been starving for a very long time.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir squinted at the troll in front of him.Then, as soon as the troll stepped out into the center of the smoke screen. The hunt was on.The pot.Vikir lunged at it, short sword at the ready.Hugo and several of the older Baskervilles looked on in amazement as he showed no sign of fear.And then.Boom.The troll\u2019s arm flailed.Vikir ducked low, dodging the troll\u2019s fist and digging into the blind spot in his side.Time to deliver the killing blow!But.Wham!Vikir didn\u2019t actually stab the troll in the side.He simply walked past him and reset his stance.Hugo smirked.\u201cGood call.\u201dZagoro trolls are highly regenerative, able to heal from wounds to their flanks and stomachs.It\u2019s a waste of energy unless you\u2019re trying to hit them where it\u2019s going to hurt, which is why Vikir didn\u2019t bother trying to pick their holes.Thud, thud, thud, thud.The troll continued to attack Vikir.They pounded the ground with their fists and stomped their feet.Normally, an 8-year-old Baskerville would have been overwhelmed by the sight of these attacks, and would have made a series of mistakes, but\u2026\u2026 Vikir was different.\u201cIt\u2019s slow, so there\u2019s no tension.An old soldier who had spent the last forty years on the battlefield. There\u2019s no way he could lose his composure under this kind of pressure. It\u2019s harder to hold back a yawn.Vikir had been dodging the trolls\u2019 attacks with a relaxed demeanor.In fact, it was the trolls who were losing health with each rampage.The seasoned Baskervilles watched in amazement.\u201cYou\u2019re trying to drain the troll\u2019s strength? That\u2019s amazing.\u201d\u201cIs he really eight years old? I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d\u201cHeh, heh, heh, I never thought I\u2019d see such an ahae in my family. Live long and see.\u201dVikir\u2019s judgment is always spot-on, and he follows the best route.The troll grows increasingly unruly as he struggles with the heavy restraints.But he is rapidly losing his reserves of health.Its attacks became less accurate and its speed even slower. The patterns were becoming simpler and simpler.Vikir watched the troll\u2019s self-destructive demeanor, waiting for the one moment that would decide the game.And then.Grrrrr!The troll began to lunge at him, throwing his whole body at him.Viktor realized it was time to move out of the way and quickly jumped forward.The body of an eight-year-old child can dodge a troll\u2019s attacks, but it can\u2019t kill a troll.Not even a genius.That was common knowledge, and Vikir knew it well.If he unleashed his hidden powers, he might be able to kill a troll, but that would complicate matters greatly.So Vikir had been waiting for this moment to kill the troll, to make it as easy as possible.Quack, quack, quack!The troll lunges, and Vikir uses the momentum to his advantage.Vikir uses the momentum of the troll\u2019s heavy body to thrust his blade in from the opposite direction, cutting through the tough layers of leather and muscle and severing the nerve bundles in its neck.And then.\u2026Whoosh!A faint gaseous aura emanates from the tip of Vikir\u2019s blade.It\u2019s the same one that wowed everyone in the orc battle earlier.Kiririk-Vikir\u2019s aura formed a distinctive tooth-like shape and flew straight for the troll\u2019s throat.Pow!One sharp fang sank deep into the troll\u2019s neck.In the next instant, Vikir twisted his body and slipped through the gap between the troll\u2019s sides, instantly blasting a gaping hole in the troll\u2019s neck.\u201cOooooh!\u201dEveryone watching gasped in amazement.Bikir\u2019s seasoned battlefield experience was disguised as genius here.\u2026\u2026 but.[Grrrrrrrr!]The troll was not dead.He jammed his fist into the hole in his neck and grunted as he tended to the wound.A faint sigh escaped from the onlookers.\u201cOh, no. I guess one baskerville isn\u2019t enough for a troll.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a little harder with a gaseous aura.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a shame, but it\u2019s still a monumental feat for an eight-year-old to have gotten this far.\u201dBaskerville 1 meal. You can\u2019t catch a troll with one tooth.Vikir knew that already.True, with Beelzebub\u2019s ability to bleed, the troll would die a natural death in time, but\u2026\u2026 there was no point in winning that way.\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Any more could be dangerous, so let\u2019s stop here\u2026\u2026.\u201dHugo raised his hand to stop the fight.\u201cRestraints.\u201dVikir opened his mouth.\u201cRelease the restraints.\u201dAt those words, the faces of all the Baskervilles stiffened.Unshackling a troll, at this point?\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAll eyes turned to Vikir and Hugo.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dEven the mighty Hugo was dumbfounded.Then, slowly, his mouth opened.\u201cMy son, you have already proven your worth. It is the mark of a swordsman to walk away when he is satisfied.\u201dThe tone was stern. All of the Baskervilles were surprised by Hugo\u2019s demeanor, something they had never seen before.But the surprise was short-lived, as Vikir\u2019s words drew everyone\u2019s attention back to him.\u201cWe\u2019re almost there, and if I don\u2019t kill you on the next strike, I\u2019ll end it cleanly.\u201dA declaration of war.Vikir\u2019s words startled all the Baskervilles, including Hugo.How on earth were they going to take down this troll whose tenacity was unmatched?\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHugo fell silent. The signal to resume the battle.[Caw! Caw! Caw!]The trolls rampaged.Several of the Guardian Knights stepped out of the way of the troll\u2019s rampage, removed the cuffs and chains, and led him back out into the open.Then. The troll, now completely free, pushed himself to his feet.His eyes, red and bloodshot, no longer even pupils.[He-ahhhhhh!]With a guttural roar, the troll lunged at Vikir with all its might.But Vikir could only stare coldly at the troll.\u201cHow far should I show my power?The question had already been answered earlier in the evening.\u2026Pow!The tip of Vikir\u2019s short sword glows a little brighter than before.Some of the veterans recognized it immediately. The density of Vikir\u2019s aura had changed.But there was no time to wonder about it, as Vikir continued with his next move.Kiririk- Karak!The tip of the blade flashed towards the charging troll. Fangs clearly visible.The troll breaking free of its restraints, running even faster, and the force of the reaction even stronger.And then.\u2026Poof!The troll is faster and stronger than before, and the tip of the blade is thrust back into his body, faster and stronger than before.And then.There were two teeth sinking into the troll\u2019s neck this time.The first tooth ripped a hole in the troll\u2019s neck.And a second tooth, smaller and fainter, but clearly visible, biting ferociously into the side of the troll\u2019s neck.Baskerville Two-Thirds.And Sword Expert Intermediate.\u2026\u2026! \u2026\u2026! \u2026\u2026! \u2026\u2026! \u2026\u2026!All the Baskervilles, including Hugo, stand in place with their mouths agape.\u2026thud!The troll behemoth, decapitated, fell to his knees on the ground.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

None. None. None.For the swordsmanship of the Baskervilles was so great, and the mastery of the four styles was enough to make the world tremble.\u2026\u2026But.There is.Even within the great Baskervilles, there are Irregulars who occasionally deviate from the formula.The bad ones are the hounds that don\u2019t follow the formalized progression and fall through the cracks.These were nothing special, really. They were disposed of on the spot.Those who die in training and disappear into the experience of their brothers, those who die or go missing on a mission and become nothing more than numbers on a damage report, those who are assassinated for family interests, and those who are rarely soldiers\u2026\u2026.The casualties of the Baskervilles are many, but they become fewer with each passing year.The older they get, the more seasoned they become.However.There are few, if any, Irregulars who deviate from the formula in a slightly different sense.Even within the Baskervilles, a family of geniuses, there are those who are recognized as geniuses.Such was the case with Osiris Les Baskervilles, Hugo Les Baskervilles\u2019 eldest son and cattleman.A little sunshine who will lead the Baskervilles in the future. A genius, by all accounts.Until now, Osiris has been the greatest genius in the family.But lately, a rumor has been spreading.A mother-of-pearl cloud floating in the infant star. A tiny sun that floated beneath the sun.Rumors circulated within the family that another genius had emerged to succeed Osiris Baskerville.Vikir van Baskerville. Eight years old.A prodigy who, according to the patriarch himself, Hugo L\u00e9 Baskerville, recently reached the rank of Sword Expert Intermediate.A swordsmanship that could draw two teeth and a mana that would be two circles in mage terms.He has perfected at the tender age of eight what his siblings would have to wait until they were eighteen to accomplish.So much so, that whenever three or more of them got together, even the most disinterested of Baskervilles, they were talking about Vikir.\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes, you mean there\u2019s such a kid?\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s he from? Is it the Barnes surname? Hmm, so we don\u2019t even know where it came from.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s worth keeping, if not, then early\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe listened with interest, or indifference, sometimes weighing his own interests.And with that, Vikir had already bared his sharp fangs.* * *Meanwhile.\u201cAssholes.Bikir himself, the subject of the rumors, didn\u2019t give a damn what anyone thought of him or his reputation.He already knew where the family\u2019s power struggles and dirty tricks were headed.How could he not? He had spent the last few decades as a dog seller, bouncing from one line to another.\u2026Chulpuduk! Chulpuduk!Bikir thought as he watched the haggis fall to the table.\u2018I was only going to show two teeth anyway, I\u2019ve had enough of this.\u2019Now that we\u2019ve clearly exposed the oatmeal, we may be able to utilize some of the family\u2019s infrastructure on our own.As I\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s good to be recognized in moderation if you want to make sure you stay off Hugo\u2019s radar.Vikir sat in the far corner of the dining room and began to munch on his haggis alone.As the salty, fishy gruel slides down his throat, he thinks about many things.First, about her true skill set.\u201cCurrently, my official skills are Baskerville 2nd Class and Sword Expert Intermediate.However, Vikir\u2019s true strength is already at the level of a Gradualist, and in terms of swordsmanship, he\u2019s a Baskerville Fourth Grade.Due to his profound training in the Great Library, he is on the verge of reaching Gradient Intermediate.If he keeps this up, he\u2019ll be able to break through to the fifth level of swordsmanship without difficulty.\u201cI\u2019ll reach the upper Gradient before I turn 17.By then, my swordsmanship will be able to reach the Sixth Form. Unlike before the regression, when you were stuck at just four.What\u2019s more.\u2026Wiggle!The spoon that was unwrapping the haggis suddenly flinched.Beelzebub, lurking in the artery of his right wrist, had moved.<Binge Fly \u2018Beelzebub\u2019> / Awl-1 slot: Burn \u2013 Cerberus (A+)-2 slot: Bleed \u2013 Hellhound (B+)Slot -3: Super Regeneration \u2013 Troll (C+)Beelzebub removes the Rats from slot 3 and fills the void by taking the skills of the recently killed Troll.His opponent bleeds, he regenerates. It was a terrible combination.Add this ability to the mix, and he\u2019d probably be even more formidable than the average Gradient.Bikir thought to himself as he continued to devour the haggis.It was his sixth serving already, and he felt that his appetite had only grown stronger since absorbing Beelzebub.Then.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Hey, hey.\u201dA voice called out from behind him, and Bikir turned his head.\u201c?\u201dUnexpected figures stood behind him.Triplets. Highbrow Les Baskervilles, Middlebrow Les Baskervilles, and Lowbrow Les Baskervilles.The three who would come to be known as the Trident of Baskerville stood behind Vikir.Vikir\u2019s brow furrowed.\u201cLook at these assholes?\u201dWhy bother asking? The harsh words come right out.Bikir narrowed his eyes, and the triplets instinctively reacted with fear.Is there anything in the world easier to handle than a frightened dog?Bikir clutched the spoon he was using to scoop up the haggis, and the triplets immediately waved it away.\u201cOh, no, not that one!\u201d\u201cWe just want\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cThat, that, that, that, that, catching the troll with Cerberus was cool!\u201d\u2026\u2026?Viktor frowned, not realizing what was going on.\u201cIs this a two-faced tactic or some kind of trick?But looking at the trio in front of me, I don\u2019t see any signs of advanced psychological warfare.As I stare at them, I can\u2019t help but feel a chill run down my spine.\u2026Boom!Bikir had just finished preparing to send a spoon flying toward the foreheads of the three puppies.\u201cMaster.\u201dAnother voice came from beside him.He turned to see Butler Barrymore standing at attention.He had appeared out of nowhere and addressed Vikir in his usual polite tone.\u201cMy lord seeks you.\u201d* * *Hugo Les Baskerville.He was now seated on a couch by the window in a state of great irritation.\u201cIs the butler yet?\u201dHugo\u2019s question to Barrymore was answered by the maid, who bowed her head impatiently.\u201cI looked under the window and he was just coming into the lobby on the first floor, with Master Vikir.\u201d\u201cThey should be coming up any minute now.\u201dHugo nodded, then shifted his gaze to the side of the couch.On the couch next to it sat a middle-aged man with a handsome mustache.Morg Adolf.A delegate from House Morg, a martial family known as the rival house of Ironblood Baskerville.The younger brother of Morg Respane, the head of House Morg, he is a key figure in House Morg, always present as the acting head of the house whenever there is an outside event.Adolf lifted the teacup in front of him and drank.Then he looked directly at Hugo with a wry smile.\u201cI hope this year\u2019s annual event goes off without a hitch.\u201dThe annual event Adolf was referring to was the friendly tournament between Baskerville and Morg.The Morg and the Baskervilles train together once a year, in accordance with a decree from the previous Emperor, who said that \u201cmagic and swords are complementary.Though it was only for children between the ages of eight and fifteen, it was a show of force for the imperial family.Even then, the atmosphere was frosty, with Hugo, the current Lord of Baskerville, and Lespane, the current Lord of Morg, at odds over the ownership of a newly discovered ruby mine in the middle of their territory.It was in this atmosphere that Adolf, the younger brother of the Morg family, came to visit.The purpose of the visit is said to be to socialize through an annual event, but\u2026\u2026 it remains to be seen if that\u2019s really the case.Hugo shrugged it off.\u201cIt\u2019s just a joint exercise, it\u2019s always been that way.\u201d\u201cHeh heh heh. Didn\u2019t we have one Baskerville and one Morg child seriously injured last year?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s alive, and the treatment was timely. How can you call that a break?\u201dHugo\u2019s nonchalant remark brought a line of blood to Adolf\u2019s forehead.After a moment\u2019s grimace, he coughed a few times and changed the subject.\u201cHmmm. Hum. So, let\u2019s talk about this joint exercise, shall we? Oh, by the way!\u201dJust as he was about to cut to the chase, Adolf had a sudden thought.\u201cI heard that there\u2019s a supernova over Baskerville, and I\u2019d really like to see it, I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just loading up \u2026\u2026 right now.\u201dHugo replied nonchalantly.But the observant Adolf didn\u2019t miss the ever-so-slight upturning of the corners of Hugo\u2019s mouth.\u201cThat lizard man responds to his child\u2019s praise. That\u2019s unusual.It is a surprise in its own way. Adolf thought for a moment that he should go back and report to Gazoo, but then he continued.\u201cIt is a great blessing for the Empire to have a once-in-a-hundred-years genius in Baskerville.\u201d\u201cI would not go so far as to say that.\u201dHugo bowed, at least formally.However, Adolf\u2019s next words were quite provocative.\u201cWell, it\u2019s a double whammy, actually, because we have a once-in-a-hundred-years genius in the Morg family.\u201dHugo\u2019s eyebrows shot up at that.Adolf smiled politely, then motioned toward the door to the parlor off to one side of the room.\u201cCome in, little camel, and say hello to the head of House Baskerville.\u201dThen, as if by magic, the door opened of its own accord.In walked a small girl, trailed by servants.Her hair flaming red, her eyes sparkling like rubies.A Maalgan face with a small nose, full lips, and white, even teeth.Morg Camu.The girl, who had just turned eight years old, walked over and stood beside Adolf without a trace of embarrassment.Hugo\u2019s brow furrowed slightly.A supernova of the Morg family, born only once every hundred years or so.A girl who could hear the sound of genius even within the prestigious Morgue, where only magical geniuses gathered.Morgue Camille.The sight of her clutching at the hem of her uncle\u2019s cloak, her eyes shining brightly, made even the mighty Hugo soften his expression a little.But cuteness aside, Adolf\u2019s statement was quite provocative.\u201cWe also have an 8-year-old genius. Let\u2019s see your level of eight-year-old genius.The Morg family had come to play.\u2018\u2026\u2026Hung. You\u2019re not worthy of such a flirtatious provocation.Hugo tried to turn his head away as if he wasn\u2019t worth the trouble.The camouflage bombshell pinned his head back.\u201cAre you the thief who stole our ruby mine?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Adolf was the first to realize.\u201cHey, kid, what\u2019s with the sudden rudeness?\u201d\u201cI told you earlier, Uncle, that this man stole our ruby mine.\u201d\u201cHey, hey, hey, boy, when did I!\u201d\u201cBefore you got out of the carriage. Starting this month, the number of research rubies paid to me will be reduced, and it\u2019s all because of that stupid old mustachioed thief.\u201d\u201cHe, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, when?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re asking when, about an hour and forty-two minutes ago? Come on, I heard it clearly\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe camo gets a little sour.At this point, Adolf felt a cold sweat break out.He didn\u2019t have to look away to realize it. The temperature in the room had dropped several degrees.\u201c\u2026\u2026hmm. An unfortunate mustachioed old man, and a thief?\u201dA cold voice came from the front.Hugo turned to look at it, squinting.Adolf pulled out his handkerchief, covered his mouth, and coughed.\u201cHmph. There seems to be a misunderstanding. I\u2019ll be sure to clear that up later.\u201d\u201cWhat does a one-day puppy know, you don\u2019t need to explain to me the state of House Morg\u2019s home education.\u201dHugo\u2019s words were barbed, but he seemed to have already lost his temper.Adolph turned to the camel, thinking it was an accusation.\u201cCamo, what a rude thing to say to an elderly member of a neighboring family.\u201d\u201cBut what my uncle said\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cEven if the servants around you said something bad, you shouldn\u2019t pass it on. There are many things in the rumor mill that are inflated\u2026\u2026 well, there are many things that are diminished.\u201dAdolf and the camel turned to face each other.Suddenly, Hugo was starting to get annoyed with the whole situation.His mind flashed back to Deacon Barrymore\u2019s report the other day.\u201cFirst report. About the bloodshed with House Morg at the ruby mines on Red Awl Mountain\u2026\u2026.\u2019\u2018We\u2019ll have a chance to discuss that soon enough. The Morgans will come to me first.\u2019The ruby mines were actually an old dispute.On the border between Baskerville and Morgue, the so-called \u2018Joint Security Zone\u2019, there is a mine that pumps out high quality rubies.The problem is that the mine\u2019s entrance is above ground on Morg\u2019s territory, while the underground vein runs beneath Baskerville\u2019s territory.Due to the angle of the vein, there is only one mining route that can be accessed from the surface, and that is from the mine on Morg\u2019s estate.However, mining along this vein will inevitably lead to digging beneath the Baskerville estate.<Imaginary view of Camu\u2019s mineAs a result, the Morg have been trying to find a way around this.The most tried and true is to secretly dig a tunnel and mine rubies.But the Baskervilles\u2019 hounds, with their keen sense of smell, picked up on the signs like ghosts and raided the Morg\u2019s mines.There was bloodshed on several occasions, but none of it was reported in public, so relations between the two families remained good on the surface.Even though it was festering on the inside.And so it was that Morg Adolf, who had come to discuss the friendly competition today, was actually here to talk about the ruby mines and the bloodshed.So Hugo was prepared for that, too\u2026\u2026..\u201cI want my rubies back! I can\u2019t do my research because I don\u2019t have enough rubies!\u201dLittle did he know that an 8-year-old girl would be so insistent.Hugo put his hand to his forehead in response to her demand.\u201cEvocio Adolf Gazoo. What kind of disgrace is this on an official visit?\u201d\u201cUh-huh. Hmm. I apologize for this, my lord. But I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m at a loss for words, unless she\u2019s saying something very wrong again.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026what?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to say, isn\u2019t it, though it\u2019s crude coming from a child\u2019s mouth.\u201dHugo and Adolf\u2019s gazes met in unison.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHugo tried to channel the Swordmaster\u2019s superhuman aura to pressure his intestines, but he was distracted by the camouflage of\u2026\u2026 that had just stepped in front of him.He tries to slow his momentum down enough to make the camo back off.\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing to a child, the Sword Star of the Empire persecuting an eight-year-old girl?\u201dThat\u2019s when Adolf\u2019s pinzan comes in.Adolf wraps his cloak around his camouflage.And Hugo with a scowl on his face.It\u2019s embarrassing for an adult to argue with an 8-year-old, but this Adolf guy keeps trying to exploit her innocence for political purposes.It was very annoying for Hugo.Should we reignite the ruby mine issue, which we\u2019ve been silent about?Even agreeing to talks is an embarrassment to Baskerville, and a boon to Morg.In the first place, rubies are more important to the Morg than they are to Baskerville, as they are used as a key ingredient in magical experiments.Hugo is a closed-minded man who doesn\u2019t like to interact with other families, so he just wants to keep his mind off the ruby veins.It was enough to give him a headache training his hounds and navigating the black mountains with his enemies, and he didn\u2019t want to have to deal with a bunch of kids who wanted to play magic with a red stone used for women\u2019s jewelry.\u201cGive me back my ruby mine. Without the rubies from there, it\u2019s hard for me to continue my studies.\u201d\u201cUh-huh, Camo, you\u2019re talking about grown-ups, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.\u201dI can\u2019t even stand to listen to the conversation between the girl named Camo and the guy named Adolf.\u2018No matter how you look at it, this is a political performance\u2026\u2026.\u2019But since the other party is a child, I can\u2019t say anything and can only boil inside.Even if the iron-blooded swordsman, who is in a cognitive position, asks me to go.\u2026\u2026 right then.A voice made Hugo\u2019s ears perk up.\u201cDon\u2019t they teach you not to covet what belongs to others in Morg?\u201dA voice as cheerful and innocent as an 8-year-old camel.It was 8-year-old Vikir.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For now, he\u2019s just an eight-year-old kid.The camel turned to Bikir and asked in an angry voice.\u201cWhy is the ruby mine yours! It\u2019s ours!\u201dAdolf laughed and Hugo frowned at the sight.But Bikir dismissed Camu\u2019s protests with a single word.\u201cYou must have traveled a long way to smoke this.\u201dHugo laughed and Adolf frowned at the sight.Meanwhile.The camel gritted his teeth as he realized that his weapon of choice was a child.So he changed his demeanor and reverted to his logical self.Saaaaaa\u2026\u2026A chill ran through the girl\u2019s body.Dropping her innocent expression, the camel spoke in a cold voice.\u201cSince you seem to dislike tangents, let me logically explain why this ruby mine belongs to Morgue.\u201dCamu took out a map and analyzed the mine\u2019s topography.\u201cThe only surface mines that can produce rubies are within our family, which means that the Baskervilles can\u2019t mine them on their own anyway, and it makes good business sense for the Baskervilles to give us the mining rights to the ruby ore beneath the estate in exchange for a percentage of the estate\u2019s rent.\u201dShe is the only child of a prominent mage family who has never been overcome by logic before.Her logic would make even grown men cringe, much less people her own age.But Camu\u2019s pride was soon challenged.\u201cThe mineral ruby is commonly used in magic. There is no reason for Baskerville to mine them, and it would be a great tragedy for House Morgue to have a fool in our midst who would open up our lands for rent.\u201dCamu stared blankly at Vikir\u2019s rebuttal.For the first time in his life, he had met someone whose logic didn\u2019t make sense to him, and it was someone his own age!Weren\u2019t most men his age dull and stupid? Camu couldn\u2019t help but feel a little confused.\u2026\u2026 Meanwhile.Camu\u2019s and Bikir\u2019s arguments were not those of mere eight-year-olds.Both had a firm grasp on the logic of the Morgans and Baskervilles, and Adolf and Hugo could not help but watch with interest.Camus narrowed his eyes.\u201cWell, that\u2019s interesting. I\u2019ve never met anyone like you before. I don\u2019t know anyone my age who can talk to me.\u201d\u201cI go out a lot.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Excuse me. I\u2019ve been out a lot already, if you mean inspecting the estate. What makes you think you know anything about my life?\u201d\u201cActually, I have no interest in your life, Ruby, that\u2019s the problem. If you want to change the subject, do it alone.\u201dBikir\u2019s nonchalant demeanor is replaced by a glint in Camu\u2019s eye.\u201cYou\u2019re the first guy I\u2019ve ever met who\u2019s been this indifferent to me!\u201d is the classic, clich\u00e9d, yet timeless sentiment.Hagar had every reason to be.She\u2019s a direct descendant of House Morg, and she\u2019s been the recipient of countless favors.Where else would she go to receive such a blatant pat on the back from someone her own age?Moreover, this is a stage he cannot afford to lose, an argument he cannot afford to lose.My pride has never been diminished.Camu asked pointedly.\u201cThe mine is in Morg territory, so the mining rights belong to Morg!\u201d\u201cThe vein runs beneath Baskerville\u2019s territory, so the mining rights belong to Baskerville.\u201d\u201cI thought Baskerville was not interested in rubies!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, they only care about their territory, which is why they don\u2019t want you to come in. Is that hard to understand?\u201dMorg is interested in the ruby, and Baskerville is interested in the territory. With such different points of view, there\u2019s no way they can agree.The adults standing behind the children didn\u2019t see eye to eye with them, so the dispute was far from resolved.Then.Camu\u2019s ruby eyes sparkled.\u201cVery well, I\u2019ll make sure you know where the ruby ore belongs!\u201dThe camel picked up a brush and ink from the desk.He began to draw on the floor.A large circle centered on Bikir, and a larger circle centered on Camu.The two circles were touching each other.Then Camus made a wall of paper to separate the two circles.(The wall of paper was so large that two servants had to hold it up on each side.)Then the camel on the other side of the paper wall said.\u201cThis is your land, and this is my land.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir made no reply.Only Hugo and Adolf watched with interest as the two eight-year-olds argued.Then.\u2026Boom!The wall of paper was torn apart.A camel tore through the paper wall and stuck its arm through.A white, chubby arm broke through the paper wall and entered Vikir\u2019s land.The camel asked Bikir.\u201cNow, whose arm is this?\u201dAdolf\u2019s face lit up when he heard the answer.Hugo\u2019s face crumpled.The camel\u2019s analogy was clear.Even though his arm had crossed the boundary, he still owned it, and so did the ruby vein.It was the wisdom of his ancestors, who, long ago, when the persimmons on their persimmon tree grew over their neighbor\u2019s fence, went to claim them.But.\u201c\u2026\u2026hmm. Who does this arm belong to?\u201dBikir is not a very likable character.Chin!A strong grip that doesn\u2019t look like it belongs to an eight-year-old grabs a white, chubby forearm.Before the camel can squeal, Bikir is the first to speak.\u201cHe\u2019s mine now.\u201dInstantly, an immense sense of power radiates from Vikir.It wasn\u2019t the kind of power that comes from drawing on mana, but the kind of power that comes from being.It was an overwhelming force that only seasoned hunters from the Age of Destruction could exude.It was enough to make even Adolf and Hugo cringe for a moment.Not to mention the camel, who was only eight years old.\u201c\u2026\u2026mu, what?\u201dThe camel tried to swat his hand away, but to no avail.Boom.The wall of paper ripped open, and Bikir yanked Camu by the arm.The distance between them was now close enough for their noses to touch.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dFor a moment, Camu\u2019s gaze wavered.It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s ever seen another child this close. Not of the same sex, but of the opposite sex.On the other side of the wall, the face of the first boy outside of his clan was incredibly familiar and yet strange at the same time.Dark hair, dark eyes, white skin.And a body odor unlike any he\u2019d ever smelled before, and a breath that was almost too quiet to hear.For a moment, Camus felt a jolt that seemed to knock the wind out of him.It was a very foreign experience for the eight-year-old, who hadn\u2019t had much experience wandering outside of the clan.\u201cHe looks cute.Camu thought, momentarily forgetting the gravity of the situation.Is that why?He made the mistake of blushing and backing away from an important meeting.\u201cMy, why am I yours, woo, you\u2019re hilarious!\u201dIt\u2019s hard to tell if the attack landed because he\u2019s looking down at the floor.Adolf and Hugo watched the scene with subtle expressions.\u201cHumph.\u201d\u201cHum, hum.\u201dImportant diplomatic matters mixed with the tender sensibilities of eight-year-olds made for a very awkward atmosphere that was neither theirs nor mine.\u2026\u2026 Just then.Bikir\u2019s words broke the ice.\u201cWho says you\u2019re mine?\u201dAt the same time, Bikir\u2019s grip tightened.The camel was pulled firmly back towards Bikir.Before she could scream in surprise, Bikir\u2019s other hand moved.\u201cYour arm is mine.\u201dAs he spoke, Bikir pulled a lightning bolt from his waistband.It was a sharpened dagger.It was a shocking sight that made Camus, Adolf, and even the ever-poker-faced Hugo hiccup.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No wonder, his arm was about to be cut off.She was screaming and crying at a crisis she had never faced before.Even his uncle, Adolf, had never seen him cry like this before.\u201cThat, stop!\u201dAdolphe involuntarily raised his mana.The mana of a Sixth Circle Master surged out, pressuring Bikir.But.\u2026Sasak.As if he had anticipated it, Vikir immediately let go of Camu\u2019s arm and fell backwards.\u201cAaahhh! Uncle, he took my arm off\u2026\u2026!\u201dCamu cried, running to bury his face in the hem of Adolf\u2019s cloak.Adolf stared at Vikir in disbelief, not even angry, before turning his attention to Hugo.\u201cGo away, what are you doing!\u201dHugo ignored Adolf\u2019s protests. He simply tilted his head at an angle and looked down at Vikir.\u201cSon.\u201dSon, he said, and Vikir answered politely.\u201cYes, father.\u201d\u201cYour prank just now was a bit too much, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\u201cI apologize. It is a common prank among the brothers of the family.\u201dAfter speaking, Vikir took the tip of the dagger in his hand and bent it.Mulung.The knife bent so easily. It\u2019s a fake sword, made of rubber.When Adolf saw it, he exclaimed in disbelief.\u201cNo, no, no, what kind of a toy is this?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve never seen a boy play with a toy sword before, and we Baskervillians play with them from the time they are a year old.\u201dIt was only at Hugo\u2019s words, which seemed to surprise him, that Adolf opened his eyes and saw the sword in Bikir\u2019s hand.It was a crude rubber knife, obviously a fake, the sort of thing that even the average child in the world would play with.My mistake was that I didn\u2019t recognize the quality of the knife in Bikir\u2019s momentary burst of strength.Seeing Adolf, who was known for his meticulousness and composure, stumble in surprise gave Hugo a bit of satisfaction.He quickly forgot his own surprise.\u201cNow, I\u2019ve thought of something about the ruby mine. Maybe the Morg will like it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo let\u2019s just get this friendly competition over with.\u201dHugo\u2019s blatant attempt to sell out.Adolph, looking dumbfounded, tried to protest in Moorish.\u201c\u2026\u2026black, black, chirp, chirp. That bastard, I\u2019m not gonna let him get away with it, you\u2019ll see!\u201dUnfortunately, he didn\u2019t have time for that as he was busy petting the camel, which was blowing its nose against his cloak and whimpering.Thus, an important meeting between the two families was ridiculously interrupted by an eight-year-old squabble.* * *\u2018Magic and the sword are at odds with each other in normal times, but in times of crisis they are a good complement to each other and save the country.\u2019In keeping with the former Emperor\u2019s beliefs, Morg the Mage and Baskerville the Ironblade hold an annual friendly tournament.Children from the ages of eight to fifteen gather to test their skills against one another.By tradition, it is the 15-year-olds who compete in the most intense and high-profile battles with swords and magic, as opposed to the 8-year-olds who compete in theory and mana sensitivity.\u2026\u2026 but.For this year\u2019s friendly competition, all eyes were elsewhere.The 8-year-old class usually gets little attention.The two youngsters standing there were the main protagonists of the day.Vikir van Baskerville, of the iron-blooded House Baskerville.Morg Camus of House Morg, a master mage.At the Morg\u2019s initiative, the eight-year-olds were moved to the side of the field next to the 15-year-old class, where the real action was taking place.They would be fighting just like the 15-year-olds.The contrast between the nonchalant Bikir and the venomous Camu was quite striking.\u201cBrace yourself, boy.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get any breaks once you\u2019re in the ring.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cSay something!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cProfit!\u201dBikir could only yawn.The more he does so, the more he stomps his foot in search of a high.Finally.The bell chimed, signaling the start of the real competition.And with that, the match began.\u201cYaaaaaah!\u201dA loud cheer rang out.Camu immediately drew up his mana and charged at Bikir.A performance that draws all of its power from the start.It\u2019s a great way to get a head start, but in the long run, it\u2019s not a good strategy because it reveals all of your underside.However, Camu\u2019s talent was indeed impressive.Quadra casting!He casts four spells at the same time, when most people can\u2019t even cast two in a row.Even though they were one-circle spells, Fireball, Ice Sphere, Thunder Ring, and Mud Wall, each one of them would be difficult for a 15-year-old Morg teenager.To perform four of them simultaneously is a talent beyond imagination!It was indeed a genius that could only be found once in a hundred years, even in the prestigious Morg.Boom!Fireballs, ice balls, and lightning bolts the size of a child\u2019s fist struck the ground.It actually hurt a little, and Vikir ducked just enough to avoid it.\u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous to look at, but I think you\u2019d be better off sticking to magic for now.\u201d\u201cProfit, what business is it of yours, you magical ignoramus!\u201dCamou was chasing after Vikir, diligently controlling his three offensive magics.It was clear that he was determined to give him a run for his money.But.\u2026Hook!Vikir dodged a barrage (more like three child\u2019s fists) of spells, and instead moved closer to the camo.And then.Puck!Vikir kicked the mud wall that was protecting the camel and shattered it.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe camouflage swallowed hard.It was too close to call in its offensive magic.The base of the mud wall collapsed, and Bikir\u2019s face came into view.Camu felt his heart pounding in his chest.\u201cWe\u2019re down!Camu\u2019s eyes rolled back in his head as Bikir\u2019s palm flew out, blocking his vision.Then, a searing pain shot across his forehead.\u2026Crack!Bam. Camu pulled back, blinking back tears, and looked up.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dHer forehead burned, but that was all.Bikir didn\u2019t do anything, just flicked his finger and made a small bump on the camel\u2019s forehead.\u201cYou, you bastard! Are you kidding me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cGo, go!\u201dThe camel canceled one of the three offensive spells it had cast earlier.Woodshed!Mud Wall, a wall of mud was created in two layers, covering the camel.\u201cHaha, now there\u2019s a double wall! They can\u2019t get through this!\u201dThe problem is, with the double wall, the camel can\u2019t see out of it.But.\u2026Puck!The two layers of mud are as easy to break through as a sheet of paper.It was Bikir\u2019s hand that broke through the wall and stretched out in front of Camu\u2019s face.\u201cWho does this hand belong to?\u201dThe hand that broke through Camu\u2019s wall and into her space.Bikir\u2019s fingers moved quickly while Camu was stunned and unable to find the words to answer.\u201cThe answer is, turn off the stronger one.\u201dAnother snap.Another tear leaked from the camel\u2019s eye.He was hit again.Swat after swat hit the exact same spot, creating a second, smaller bump.To make matters worse, Bikir\u2019s hand slipped away immediately after the second sting.It wasn\u2019t like he was delivering a killer blow, it was just a quick slap.\u201cWho does this thing dare to play with me-aaaaaaaaaaaah!\u201dEight years old, a genius girl who\u2019s spent her entire life growing up like a forbidden jade leaf.Camo screamed at the top of her lungs, unable to contain her rising tantrum.With that, she canceled all of her offensive spells and formed four walls of mud to surround herself.\u201cNow, how about this, no one can break through this, not even you! Ha ha!\u201dThe camo didn\u2019t seem to mind that his vision had gone completely dark.In fact, he was glad that he didn\u2019t have to show his hands rubbing his forehead and his sullen expression.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe paused for a moment, wondering if that little bastard Bikir couldn\u2019t break through the four walls.Camu smiled triumphantly.\u201cHo-ho-ho, loser! He\u2019s a sack of dwarf shit and can\u2019t even break through the walls! Come on, you idiot!\u201dBut still no answer.\u2026\u2026.Some time passed.Trapped in the mud dome, the camel rubbed his forehead and thought to himself.\u201cHuh? But this won\u2019t let me get out, will it?What should I do? My vision is completely blocked and I can\u2019t see what\u2019s going on outside.I can\u2019t even try to do something different, because I\u2019m stuck with four layers of mud.I thought, \u201cHmm. Maybe I can cut a hole and peek out?\u2019With a little effort, the camel cut a small hole in the mud.The moment he stuck his face through the hole to look outside.\u2026Bam!Bikir\u2019s hand swooped in like a ghost and delivered a third blow to the camel\u2019s forehead.\u201cKaaaaaah!\u201dThree lumps!With three small lumps on the same spot on her forehead, Camu writhed in pain and anger.She lifted her burning eyes and quickly canceled all four layers of mud walls.As the mud wall collapsed, she could see the face of the insignificant bastard in the distance.\u201cI\u2019m going to kill him! Aaahhhh!\u201dCamu cried. He was too angry and frustrated to think about his dignity.So he threw away all his defensive spells and cast four offensive spells simultaneously.A firepower that would have been unthinkable in a 15-year-old\u2019s training center!Meanwhile, Vikir faced the camo\u2019s fury and thought.\u201c\u2026\u2026what should I do?If I try to kill it, I can snap its neck in 0.1 seconds. But that\u2019s not the problem right now.Dealing with a child is painful. You don\u2019t know where to draw the line.This is especially true for Vikir, who has spent his entire life on the battlefield.He was too young to be appeased by the younger members of House Morg.Eventually, Vikir made a judgment call.\u201cMorg\u2019s problems are Morg\u2019s problems.It\u2019s always cleaner to do things without getting your hands dirty.Boom!A quick glance to the side reveals an intense battle in progress.A nameless 15-year-old Baskerville and a 15-year-old Morg were engaged in a fierce battle of swordsmanship and magic.Both are so focused that they don\u2019t realize that someone is approaching them.The 15-year-old Morg seems to be practicing a powerful fire explosion spell, and a loud explosion erupts from the training ground.Swoosh-Vikir ducked back and stood as close as he could to the border of the neighboring arena.A very angry Camouflage followed closely behind him.\u201cWell, if there\u2019s any more, the arbiters will step in.Vikir shifted slightly, and the camouflage chased after him, unwilling to let go.And then.\u2026Boom!An explosion. And gasps.\u201cOuch! Camo!\u201d\u201cNo way, Mr. Camo!\u201d\u201cNo! Mr. Camel is\u2026\u2026!\u201dBikir began to draw the picture he wanted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seemed to regain some of the confidence it had lost when it was forced to close in on its prey.However, the three bumps on his forehead made him look anything but cute to others.Vikir raised his palm and tapped his forehead three times as he moved to avoid the magic.The smirk on Bikir\u2019s face made the camel completely lose it.\u201cI\u2019m not going to let you off the hook, you little bastard, not even if you beg!\u201dAs the camel took its final leap, Bikir stopped running.And that\u2019s when Vikir\u2019s clever calculations paid off.\u2026Boom!The 15-year-old Baskerville and Morg, who had been fighting in the next room, clashed ferociously.Swords broke and magic burst, sending shards flying in all directions.The 15-year-old Morg used a massive fire spell that shredded and scattered flames in all directions.Even Vikir and Camu were caught in its path.\u2026Boom!An explosion. And cries of horror.\u201cOuch! It\u2019s a camel!\u201d\u201cOh my God, Mr. Camo!\u201d\u201cNo! It\u2019s \u2026\u2026!\u201dThe mages watching the tournament from the sidelines were stunned.But even if it was an accident, it was a fairly minor one.The flames from the neighboring training grounds didn\u2019t pose much of a threat.However.\u201cGah!\u201dCamu screamed as he looked down to see that most of the hem of his clothes had been consumed.Hastily removing the still-sizzling garment, she became an underwear breeze in the middle of the training grounds.Luckily, the flames, smoke, and dust around her hadn\u2019t yet revealed her nakedness to others, but\u2026\u2026 was sure a gust of wind would do it in a few seconds.Thinking the damage was minor, the guardians outside didn\u2019t barge in.Only a few worried voices could be heard.\u201cOh, no, not at this rate\u2026\u2026!The teary, snotty face is not enough, but the body of the underwear breeze is also displayed in front of everyone. What an embarrassment!\u2018What can I do, what can I do, what can I do\u2026\u2026\u2019If you behave like this, you will lose face in your family.I had once been kicked out of the house, naked, for talking back to my mother, so the trauma was even more intense.\u201cNu, can someone\u2026\u2026 someone come!Camu crouched down, covering his bare skin with his hands as best he could.Worried about the terrible humiliation that would come in a few seconds.But then \u2026\u2026 came along.Flutter!The camel felt the material of the cloth wrapped around his entire body.It was heavy, but soft fabric.Raising his head, he saw a black blood-red robe covering his entire body.\u201cWear that.\u201dBikir said. He stood in a blur of underwear in front of Camu.Camu stuttered.\u201c\u2026\u2026You, too?\u201dAt that, Bikir shrugged.\u201cIt\u2019s a child\u2019s prerogative to be naked for all to see and not be dishonored.The idea that it\u2019s a disgrace to show what\u2019s underneath the clothes is rampant among both sexes, but\u2026\u2026 those are the stories of adults.Little kids running around naked is not a big deal or an emotional flaw. Kids can be kids.\u2026\u2026Of course, the child may have a different opinion, but at least that\u2019s what Bikir thought.After undressing Camu, Bikir stood up.Then.Camu pointed at Bikir\u2019s face and stammered.\u201cYaah\u2026\u2026 you, you bleed, you bleed!\u201dBikir raised his hand and wiped the blood from his forehead.Apparently, when the magic had been dispersed, the shards of the sword had been dispersed as well.It wasn\u2019t a fatal wound, but it was blood nonetheless, and in a fight between eight-year-olds, blood is the difference between victory and defeat.And now.Whirring-!A gust of wind blows in, sweeping away the dust and cannonballs that have risen on the stage.It reveals a dazed Camouflage, covered in Baskerville\u2019s training uniform, and a bleeding, naked Vikir.It\u2019s unclear what happened in the dirt, but everyone could tell that the mood between them was no longer one for fighting.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe look in Camu\u2019s eyes, in particular, tells me that the battle is completely over.That dazed gaze was like a blank slate\u2026\u2026.Meanwhile.The other Baskervilles looked at the younger Baskerville, who stood tall and proud, even naked.\u201cHo-ho, did you lose to the Morg woman, or did you win, I can\u2019t tell.\u201d\u201cBy the way, the young one is very good. Must be the River Styx\u2019s favor.\u201d\u201cOf course, all those lean muscles all over his body. You must be keeping up with your training schedule.\u201dThe fight between the eight-year-olds, which had been impressive in many ways, ended somewhat sourly with the loss of Camu.* * *After the friendly competition was over.Hugo pulled Vikir aside in the corner of the arena.As they walked to the gazoo, Hugo turned to Vikir and asked.\u201cHow was the Morg\u2019s battle with the Lady?\u201d\u201cIt was interesting, and it reminded me of the significance of the event.\u201d\u201cA battle with a wizard is quite different from a battle between swordsmen.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll learn.\u201dHugo and Vikir chatting away.If anyone else in the family had seen this, they would have been quite surprised.Hugo wasn\u2019t the type to talk to his children like this.And Bikir was also feeling quite out of place in this regard.\u201cWhat is this, was he always like this?Hugo doesn\u2019t actually remember much about his childhood.He was always cold, stern, and cruel.Rumor had it that the reason for his fucked up personality was the bitter loss of his first wife and eldest daughter.\u2018\u2026\u2026Well, that\u2019s none of my business now.\u2019While Vikir mulled this over in his mind, Hugo asked his next question in a blunt tone.\u201cWhat do you think of the ruby mine?\u201dHugo\u2019s key question, a continuation of the debate before the friendly competition.At the time, Camu\u2019s logic had been, \u201cWe can\u2019t mine the rubies in Baskerville anyway, so we\u2019ll take the mining rights for pennies on the dollar,\u201d which was also Morg\u2019s demand.Baskerville, then, has no choice but to give a realistic answer.Turning to Hugo, who was looking at him with some anticipation, Vikir replied.\u201cI think it\u2019s better to give it away.\u201dHugo\u2019s eyes widened slightly at that.\u201cYou\u2019re giving away the mining rights to the ruby mine?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cOn what grounds?\u201dHugo asked again, and Bikir answered without hesitation.\u201cThe Red Awl Mountain, through which the ruby mines flow, is the downstream of the Red and Black Mountains. A little further up, powerful demons and barbarians abound, and I know this because I ventured outside the boundaries into the No Harm No Foul territory not long ago on a practical assessment.\u201dVikir said, remembering the arrow marks in Cerberus\u2019 side.Meanwhile, Hugo\u2019s expression was gradually brightening, albeit subtly.\u201cHmm. So?\u201d\u201cAnd the Baskervilles have made it a point to expand their borders by opening up those backwoods. If we can use the Morgas to our advantage, we can minimize the damage to the Baskervilles\u2019 frontier.\u201dHugo\u2019s eyes glowed blue at that.\u201cHoo-hoo-hoo, that\u2019s the answer.\u201dHe understood Vikir\u2019s point.If the ruby mining rights were given away, the Morg would put a significant number of their men downstream in the Red and Black Mountains.Baskerville would then be able to open up the backcountry next to them, and drive the demons and barbarians who lived there back to Morg.When you take territory from demons or barbarians, you must dry up their seeds so that the natives will never seek revenge.Slashing Root.I must kill all the demons and savages in the land, as well as chase down and kill all those who escape, and then I can take full possession of the land.Return to the land.This is because it prevents the departed from gaining strength and returning to take revenge.But it\u2019s a long and painful process to completely exterminate fleeing prey.So Hugo decided to clear the land and drive all the fleeing demons and barbarians to Morg\u2019s ruby mines.\u201cHahaha, the rubies will be even redder with Morg\u2019s blood. You will regret entering our territory, child of Respane.\u201dHugo was pleased with Vikir\u2019s answer.The Morg had gotten the ruby, Baskerville had gotten the territory, and the meeting had ended cordially.\u201cVery well done. A ploy that fits my plan perfectly.\u201dHugo said, stroking Vikir\u2019s head.Bikir thought.\u201cOf course it was. The plan came from your head in the first place.Vikir knew this well, for before the regression, he had served as a hound to drive demons and barbarians toward the Morg.For now, however, he must simply lower his eyes and answer politely.\u201cStill, I think we should carefully monitor the movements of any Morg who have entered our territory, just in case.\u201d\u201cThere is no need to worry about that. I have been slowly increasing the number of hounds I have sent there for some time now.\u201dHugo\u2019s answer came as a surprise. Not that the plan was surprising, but that he\u2019d bothered to tell Bikir about it.Bikir was stunned to realize that Hugo\u2019s gaze had softened to the color of tanned leather.Just as they were about to enter the chamber.\u201cMy Lord.\u201dA voice called out to Hugo from behind.He turned to see Morg Adolf standing there.And beside him stood Camus, his eyes still red.He clutches at the hem of his uncle\u2019s cloak, his gaze shifting away.Hugo narrowed his eyes.\u201cActing Lord Morg, what is it, and do you still have business?\u201d\u201cI have one very important business to attend to.\u201d\u201cWell, let\u2019s go inside and finish it.\u201dHugo unlocked the door and stepped into the chamber.Adolf followed him in and sat down on the couch.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dCamus still didn\u2019t say anything.It merely glanced at Vikir before entering, then dropped its gaze to the floor and glanced aside.He still wore the blood robe Vikir had given him after the duel, wrapped tightly around his body.Adolf said to Hugo.\u201cThe truth is, Morg has been putting a lot of thought into resolving the ruby mine issue amicably, and the rent for the manor is just one of many issues.\u201d\u201cSo what, the price of my opening up the estates.\u201d\u201cWhat about a marriage pact?\u201dHugo\u2019s brow furrowed slightly at Adolf\u2019s offhand remark.But he didn\u2019t say no.Hugo leaned forward and asked.\u201cA marriage potion?\u201d\u201cYes. A marriage between a man and a woman from Morg and Baskerville.\u201dOpening up the lands to another family for money might not look good, so let\u2019s paint a good picture by creating a marriage relationship.But a marriage between Morg and Baskerville, known for their long-standing enmity, is an awkward and outrageous proposition.Hugo chuckled at the unthinkable.\u201cI see. And who does it link to whom?\u201d\u201cHow about this one\u2019s eldest daughter and that one\u2019s eldest son?\u201dAdolf turned his head and looked at the camel.The camel next to him looked up in surprise.It\u2019s a sign of the times.\u201cHe\u2019s my nephew,\u201d he said, \u201cbut he\u2019s a great kid. Beauty for beauty, intelligence for intelligence, strength for strength, nothing is missing, and I think he\u2019d make a good backup for the little sunshine of Baskerville.\u201dBut Hugo didn\u2019t care about any of that.\u201cHmph. My firstborn is twenty this year. I thought there was quite a difference in age?\u201d\u201cEight and twenty. It\u2019s only a seventeen-year difference, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s easily overcome.\u201d\u201cAdolf Gazoo was forty this year, wasn\u2019t he? Would you be able to meet a seventeen-year-old?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAdolf suddenly became very quiet.Hugo threw up his hands.\u201cBesides, my eldest son is already engaged to be married.\u201d\u201cIs that so, and when\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cA prenuptial betrothal, you do not know.\u201dHugo\u2019s answer gave Adolf a troubled look.Just then.The still camel suddenly raised its head and shouted.\u201cI will not marry anyone weaker than my mother!\u201dHer tone was quite confident.Adolf and Hugo\u2019s gazes turned to the camel.They hadn\u2019t even asked for the child\u2019s wishes.Adolf smiled gently and stroked the camel\u2019s head.\u201cMy dear, if you refuse to marry someone weaker than your mother, you will be a virgin for most of your life. Or you\u2019ll have to find a man with a huge age difference.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking at possibilities, and I don\u2019t want a huge age gap. I like people my own age or younger, and there were a lot of people my age in the theater earlier!\u201dAdolf shrugged at Camus\u2019s comment, not really sure what to say.Then Hugo looked at him with a hint of irritation.\u201cKid, this isn\u2019t a buffet.\u201d\u201cI know, and I\u2019m not interested in picking and choosing.\u201dWith that, the camel looks up and stares off into the distance.There, standing in the distance, was Bikir.Hugo is stroking his chin with his hand when he realizes where Camu\u2019s gaze is headed.\u201cNo! You!\u201dAdolf jumped up and covered the camo\u2019s eyes.\u201cYou\u2019ve got half a surname, not Les, and I\u2019m a dragon from the creek, after all!\u201dAdolf whispers in the Camouflage\u2019s ear, but Hugo, now a superhuman, can\u2019t help but hear the whispers.\u201cHmmm. You\u2019re right, but that\u2019s kind of pissing me off.\u201dHugo mumbles a little to himself.Then he turns to Vikir, who is standing next to him.\u201cWell, Zagoro, when it comes to marriage, what you think is what matters most. What about you, my son?\u201dWithout hesitation, Bikir answered.\u201cIf you say so, I will obey.\u201dIt was a loyal answer.Hugo laughed heartily at that, and Adolf\u2019s face contorted in bewilderment.\u201cIf you ask me, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d he said, and Adolf\u2019s expression turned to disbelief.What a disrespectful way to treat Morg\u2019s only child!Hugo was even openly scratching Adolf\u2019s insides.\u201cIn Baskerville, there is no such thing as direct descent. Inferior things come from the family name of Les and superior things come from the family name of Van.\u201d\u201cIs \u2026\u2026 that what the Lord would say, my friend?\u201dAdolf looked down at Vikir with a smile on his face.But the smile was cold and hard.\u201cI didn\u2019t get a good look at you in the rehearsal hall earlier, but would you mind if I took a good look at you?\u201dVikir finally managed to look up at Adolf, who stood before him.Sixth Circle Master. A powerhouse at the very top of the martial arts scene in Morg.A delegate to the Great House and a master of words who is often the go-to person for diplomatic and political matters.\u201cAnd known as a terrible nephew fool.Viktor is alone, recalling his pre-regression personality data.Adolf leaned closer and whispered in Bikir\u2019s ear.\u201cChild, I don\u2019t mean for you to hear this, but\u2026\u2026. To be the husband of our camel, you must be of a certain age. It\u2019s just a matter of opinion within the family, and personally, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re even close to being the right man for Baskerville.\u201dThe words were spoken with a hint of bravado.As is characteristic of politicians, Hugo\u2019s internal fire is quite high for someone who had just taken a jab at Camus.But.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dUnder Adolf\u2019s pressure, Vikir doesn\u2019t move an inch, just stands there with an expressionless face.In fact, Adolf\u2019s brow furrows.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you answer me? Are you listening to me?\u201dFinally, Bikir\u2019s mouth opened.\u201cYou said it wasn\u2019t for me to hear, so I didn\u2019t listen.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Will you allow me to speak with this child for a few moments?\u201dIt was highly unusual for a delegate of House Morg, much less a top member of the Ming Party, to take such an undue interest in a mere eight-year-old.And Hugo didn\u2019t have much to say in response to his opponent\u2019s overreaction.\u201cWhat are you doing with that kid? Is the Mad Star of the Empire persecuting an eight-year-old boy?\u201dHugo hadn\u2019t forgotten what he\u2019d heard before, and he was returning the favor.But Adolf was stubborn.\u201cHehe, isn\u2019t this a child who may one day be my niece\u2019s husband, and I\u2019m asking you this as an uncle, not as the head of Morg\u2019s delegation?\u201d\u201cOh, uncle, it\u2019s not like that!\u201d\u201cUh-huh, leave my nephew alone. This uncle will take care of it. We all have to see this once in a while.\u201dAdolphe says with a stern look on his face as the camouflage speaks up.He nudges Hugo with a sly glance, a nuanced way of asking him to save face.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHugo threw up his hands, thinking that it had been a long time since he\u2019d had to deal with the Morgans.Do as you please.* * *Vikir readily accepted Adolf\u2019s request.Morg Adolf was an absolute powerhouse who had been difficult to deal with even before his regression. At the age of forty, he is already the acting head of the family at official events.The chance to experience a little bit of Adolf\u2019s power was a good one.I\u2019m sure Hugo thought so too, which is why he allowed me to attend.After the annual ceremony, everyone cleared out of the ballroom.Vikir and Adolf stood facing each other in a large clearing.The observers were Hugo le Baskerville and Morg Camus.They stood at a distance from each other, looking at the two men in the center of the arena.Adolf said.\u201cChild of Baskerville, I am about to test your qualities, so show me all that you are.\u201dBikir nodded and thought of something else.\u201cIf I show you all of me, you\u2019ll faint.What would happen if I faced him at his pre-regression peak?Fifty percent in ambush and assassination, ten percent in hand-to-hand combat.But I don\u2019t have all of my pre-regression strength back, and I don\u2019t have to fight to the best of my ability.I just need to fulfill Adolf\u2019s expectations in moderation.\u201cLet\u2019s see what Madocheng can do.It\u2019s said that masters can tell each other\u2019s skill by shaking hands.Viktor thought he\u2019d take this opportunity to see how Morg stacks up against the top players.Then Adolf said.\u201cChild, I give you a handicap.\u201dHe raised his hand and swung it toward the ground.Boom!Mud rose up from the ground and swirled around to form the shape of a jar.Boom!The flames from Adolf\u2019s hand solidified the clay.\u2026\u2026Next, the jar began to fill with water spontaneously.A seemingly simple combination of earth, fire, and water, three magical elements all at once.\u2026just right!Adolf snapped his fingers, and the jar of water slowly rose into the air and landed on top of Adolf\u2019s head.Carrying the jar of water, Adolf looked down at Vikir and said.\u201cI will duel you with this jar full of water on my head. If you can get even one drop of water to flow from the jar on my head, you win.\u201dIn other words, go for it.Vikir gripped his short sword and took up his stance.Adolf crossed his arms and stared at Vikir.And then.\u2026Tadak!Vikir made the first move.Seeing Vikir charging straight at him, the camo cried out in alarm.\u201cUh-uh! You can\u2019t run straight at my uncle!\u201dHearing this, Adolf looks back at the camel with a very regretful expression.\u201cNephew, I don\u2019t want you to tell him that.\u201dAt the same time, a transparent barrier forms in front of Adolf\u2019s eyes.Pow!Vikir is knocked back against the wall as he charges.\u201cShield magic is best when dealing with swordsmen. Even an aura sword will be hard pressed to stop them.\u201dAdolf\u2019s words were true.Adolf, in particular, was a master of shield magic, able to create shields of various sizes, thicknesses, and shapes to suit the time and place.Earlier, he had created a shield just the right size to cover Vikir\u2019s torso to minimize the waste of mana.However, Vikir is no slouch either.\u2026Ta-da!Vikir used the backward bouncing momentum to close the distance, then immediately turned and moved to the side.At the same time.Bam! Bam!Vikir kicked a few cobblestones in the opposite direction of his travels.The stones flew straight toward the water jar.\u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea to aim for the jug.\u201dWithout even looking in the direction the rocks were coming from, Adolf used his hands to create a shield.He summoned another, smaller shield for the incoming Vikir.Vikir bounced back from another blow.Adolf opened his mouth.\u201cFrom now on, I will attack as well.\u201dBefore he can finish his sentence, fire spears are summoned.Fire bolts descend rapidly through the air, each one powerful enough to pierce the solid soil of the smokefield and create a deep pit.Seeing this, the camel cried out.\u201cUncle, that\u2019s not fair, you didn\u2019t even use that kind of magic against me!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my \u2026\u2026 nephew. Whose side are you on now?\u201dAdolf looked bitterly disappointed.But Viktor was frantically dodging the flying fire spears.\u201cHmm. That\u2019s it.Viktor\u2019s familiarity with Adolf\u2019s power hadn\u2019t changed much since then.This level was already familiar.\u2018I see how to deal with him.The seasoned battle experience before the regression, and the innocent face of a child afterward.The combination of the two can catch your opponent off guard and lead to unexpected results.\u2018Or kill them.A ghastly thought crossed my mind, but\u2026\u2026 I didn\u2019t need to make a big deal out of it.Hugo\u2019s eyes were on me, and I needed to get this right.\u201cEight!\u201dVikir moved as if chased by flames.Vikir quickly drew his sword and swung at Adolf.But.\u201cNot a chance.\u201dAdolf\u2019s shield blocks Vikir\u2019s blade.Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!Vikir swung his sword again, but it too was blocked by the shield.Adolf grumbled.\u201cSame thing a hundred times. Your sword can\u2019t pierce the shield.\u201dBut Vikir did not give up.Boom.The sword swings.Boom!And it hits the shield.Vikir kept repeating the same move, and Adolf kept blocking the sword with the same shield.Boom, boom, boom, ground, boom!The sword was hitting the same place over and over again without missing a beat.Bikir\u2019s sword flew with machine-like precision, the same trajectory repeated countless times.At this point, even Adolf realized that something was wrong.\u201c\u2026\u2026hoh.\u201dVikir\u2019s blade was hitting the same spot on the shield over and over again.The shield was getting worn down by the blade.Especially since it was constantly hitting only one part, the magical fatigue level of that part was already quite high.\u201cHahahaha- you\u2019re trying to pierce the shield by hitting the same spot over and over again, what a bold idea. I can\u2019t help but praise your concentration and swordsmanship for being able to target the same spot over and over again without missing a beat.\u201dHowever, Adolf\u2019s eyes immediately turn cold.\u201cBut\u2026 that\u2019s like trying to hit a boulder with an egg, and you\u2019re trying to do that against the durability of my shield and the durability of your sword?\u201dHe was right.Bam! Bam!Vikir\u2019s sword struck Adolf\u2019s shield for the tenth time.\u2026Pow!Vikir\u2019s sword finally shatters and breaks.Vikir was forced to retrieve his broken sword and step back.Hugo stroked his chin and remained speechless, while Camus looked disappointed.Adolf turned to Vikir, who had retreated into the distance.\u201cI admire your stubbornness and willingness to stick to one position, but it\u2019s something you have to do while watching your opponent. You\u2019re a fine young man, but you\u2019re far from qualified to be my nephew\u2019s double\u2026\u2026.\u201dAdolph was about to end the line with an admonition.\u2026\u2026 but.He immediately felt the top of his head grow damp and stopped speaking.\u201cWhat is it?When Adolf realized that something was wrong.Gurgling.A trickle of water dampened his hair and began to run down his face.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dDazed, Adolf looks up and sees a jar of water leaking from his head.\u201c\u2026Boom!The shard of Vikir\u2019s sword that broke and bounced off earlier had stuck into the side of the jar, causing it to leak water.Adolf, soaked from the crown of his head to his chin and even to the nape of his neck, looked on in a daze.Thud, thud, thud, thud.Bikir walked up to him and said.\u201cYou\u2019re full to the brim.\u201dHe was referring to the water in the jar, of course.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thirty-five years old. He\u2019s a seasoned knight in the middle ranks of the Gradient.An outsider, a commoner, not even given the middle name of \u2018half\u2019, let alone \u2018la\u2019, but an upstanding man who had laundered his bloodline by taking the surname of Baskerville for his outstanding qualities and straightforward heart.In particular, his \u201cstabbing fang\u201d swordsmanship is said to have reached the level of the Baskerville Four.Four teeth, drawn to perfection.If he\u2019s this good, he should be able to lead and teach the younger Baskervilles right now.\u201cNow, for the final exercise, practice makes perfect, practice makes perfect, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all well aware!\u201dStaffordshire glanced at the fifteen- and sixteen-year-old Baskervilles in front of him.All looked tired and weary. But the chill and poison in their eyes is growing stronger and stronger.The young Baskervilles here, all fifteen or sixteen years old, are swordsmen who have mastered the Sword Expert junior class, Baskerville 1.Staffordshire checked the trainees\u2019 form, then turned his head again.In the center of the training grounds that surrounded them, a huge bear stood on two paws.Weighing in at 800 kilograms and standing three meters tall, there was something else unusual about this giant bear.It has two sharply curved horns on top of its head.<OxbearDanger rating: ASize: 5 metersFound in: Ridge 7, Red and Black Mountains-A very large bear with two massive horns.A carnivorous bear, the strongest terrestrial predator, and a perfect killing machine, it is considered the strongest and pinnacle of the Red and Black Mountains 7th Ridge ecosystem.A demonic creature with few natural enemies other than its own kind.The bear carries two massive, curved water buffalo horns on its head.Its entire body is covered in thick muscle, fat, and bristly fur.[grrrr\u2026\u2026]The beast currently on the loose in the performance hall appears to be a sub-adult, not yet fully grown.It\u2019s also been in a cage for a long time, so its nutrition is not very good.But that also means it\u2019s aggressive and nervous.Staffordshire swung his sword to intimidate Oxbear, while encouraging the younger Baskervilles behind him.\u201cNow, we just need to do what we\u2019ve been practicing on the demon\u2019s corpse. Last time we practiced on Oxbear\u2019s corpse, you all know how tough his hide is, how tight his muscles are, and which parts of his body contain which entrails.\u201dThe meek-looking Staffordshire was a different man when he stood before Oxbairn.His eyes glowed with life, and the aura emanating from the tip of his sword was like a giant\u2019s grip.Staffordshire exuded such a terrifying aura that it overwhelmed Oxbair, but he never attacked.Because it\u2019s not his place.Next.[Grrrrrr!]Oxbear charged.He charged like a buffalo with his two horns.The young Baskervilles fight back, each according to their own preferences.Some scattered to the left and right to dodge, while others swung their swords in front of them.\u2026BANG!Those who dodge live, and those who meet head-on fall.Staffordshire continued.\u201cIf someone stronger than you is coming at you head-on, it\u2019s natural to dodge. But don\u2019t dodge by putting too much distance between you and them, but sneak around them to the side and get in some small attacks.\u201dThe young hounds\u2019 advice continues.The young hounds\u2019 eyes glowed, sucking them in like water.\u201cDon\u2019t be greedy and go for the kill right from the start. It\u2019s more likely to be countered. Instead, go for the center of gravity of the body, in this case the right hind leg, so that it can\u2019t move or react as quickly.\u201dThe young hounds followed their handler\u2019s instructions and repeatedly attacked the bear\u2019s legs as it stood on its two feet.Continuing to attack only his hind legs, Oxbear was left with a widening wound that left him with little use of one leg.The menacing antler lunge was sealed.By this time, the young baskervilles had bared their teeth in earnest.They were now hunting dogs who could take care of themselves without the guidance of the Staffordshire.Baskerville 1 meal. More than thirty teeth bared, tearing at Oxbear\u2019s body.The most aggressive were the triplets, Highbrow, Middlebrow, and Lowbrow.Quack, quack, quack!They hunted the bear as if they were the boss.They were the boss of the pack, physically shoving aside any cocky siblings who tried to get ahead of them, or any dumb siblings who fell behind their peers.And then.\u2026thud!Oxbear fell to the ground.\u201cWell done.\u201dStaffordshire raised his sword and stepped toward Oxbear\u2019s corpse.Thwack!The bear\u2019s stomach split open, spilling guts and flesh.After four periods of training, lunchtime came naturally.Staffordshire impromptu distributed Oxbear\u2019s guts and flesh to the young hounds.Steaming red chunks of meat.The young baskervilles chewed and gulped down the raw, squeamish flesh.Staffordshire said to the trainees as they ate.\u201cNow, eat and listen. As of this hour, three and a half years of basic training, three and a half years of practical training, are over. Congratulations on your graduation.\u201dSeven years had transformed the snot-nosed children into young warriors.Now everyone here was a young prodigy who could not only load a sword with mana, but also draw a single perfect tooth.But Staffordshire said they were just getting started.\u201cPracticing with captured demons is really just a tutorial that I wouldn\u2019t even call realistic, and now you have to create and build your own experience.\u201dThe advice of an old dog who\u2019s seen it all is always worth heeding.\u201cThe wild beasts of the Red and Black Mountains are not only fit and strong, but also cunning and calm in nature, unlike those that have been left in cages for a long time. Even I can\u2019t compete with the stubborn and old individuals I sometimes see.\u201dThat\u2019s true of the oxbear I just killed.Facing a full-grown wild oxbear\u2019s horns, followed by a series of front paws and head bites, is dangerous enough for any grader.Controlled variables, a safe environment, and set rules.And a wild, unexplored place where you can\u2019t survive on your training alone.That\u2019s where these young hounds have to go from here.The young Baskervilles already knew that.Staffordshire gestured to the countless scars across his face.\u201cYou will have to go through the hell that lies ahead. Either overcome it with the blood you were born with, or overcome it with your own experience. I have nothing more to say to you, that\u2019s all!\u201dWith a brief colossus salute, he relinquished his leadership position.The young Baskervilles put down the flesh and guts they\u2019d been tearing up for a moment.Then they steeled themselves for the next twenty-one months of unexplored territory.Once Staffordshire was out of sight, they gathered in small groups and began to make small talk.\u201cHey, where did you get your knighthood?\u201d\u201cFirst degree, Doberman. Two, a pit bull. And a Rottweiler.\u201d\u201cOh, none of those overlap with me. I like the Knights of the Wolfhound, then the Shepherds and the Bull Mastiffs.\u201dThe Seven Knights of Baskerville Street.Each order was created and operated for a different purpose: vigilance, search, protection, assassination, suppression, and all-out warfare.But the best of the bunch was the Order of the Wolfhound, which symbolized the power of the house.\u201cI want to join the Wolfhounds.\u201d\u201cBut you can\u2019t just go there because you want to, you have to be kicked out.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to be realistic and apply for the Dobermans. That\u2019s practically the only place you can get in, except for the Wolfhounds.\u201d\u201cIf I join the Doberman Knights, I\u2019ll have to watch the castle walls for the rest of my life, and I can\u2019t stand that. I\u2019d rather be a Pit Bull Knight, always on the battlefield.\u201dThe children murmured.And naturally, their eyes slowly began to converge on a single point.\u201c\u2026\u2026But where is he going to go?That was the common question of all the kids here.Even the triplets, who had been the most active in this oxbear hunt, had put down their morsels of meat and were now watching.Vikir Van Baskerville.A child from outside the family, rumored to be Hugo\u2019s illegitimate son.He hadn\u2019t joined the oxbear hunt, but sat alone in a secluded spot in the distance.And at Vikir\u2019s feet, a large oxbear lies dead.A much larger one than the one that had just been killed by the combined efforts of over thirty children.The young Baskervilles stare at Vikir, awe in their eyes.\u201cIs he really 15 years old like us?\u201d\u201cHow does he catch an oxbear by himself?\u201d\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, he\u2019s already a Sword Expert?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s even drawn three teeth.\u201d\u201cCrazy, he can use three Baskerville formulas? That makes him almost a spirit dog!\u201dWorship of the powerful is common in any group, but it\u2019s even more pronounced in the Baskerville family.Bikir himself, however, didn\u2019t pay much attention to the rumors.\u201cSword Expert Advanced.Sword Expert Advanced means that the aura at the tip of a sword has become so dense that it can pass between gas and liquid.The children of Les Baskervilles usually reach this stage between the ages of twenty and twenty-five, but Vikir is rumored to have achieved it at the age of fifteen.\u2026\u2026 but.Vikir\u2019s true hidden power was beyond that of a Gradient Intermediate.It was a full two levels above Sword Expert, and comparable to Staffordshire, who had been his spirit dog.Moreover, considering the protection of the Styx River and the power of the demonic sword Beelzebub, his actual combat power would be even stronger than this.If the world knew, they would be shocked.\u2018\u2026\u2026Currently, I\u2019ve mastered five Baskerville Forms. In terms of swordsmanship alone, he has already surpassed the level before the regression.\u201dHe had never mastered a sword technique above the fourth level in his previous life.Because of this, it would take him a little longer than he had originally planned to become a perfect Gradient Intermediate.Meanwhile, Vikir closed his eyes and recalled the oxbear he had just killed.It had been a close call, but the animal had been weakened by years in captivity, and he\u2019d been able to kill it with his hidden skills.Vikir\u2019s mind raced as he tried to figure out how good he was now, and how much he\u2019d lost in comparison to his pre-reversion skills.He couldn\u2019t be bothered with the chatter of the Baskervilles\u2019 day pups, who were just getting their teeth.Then.A topic of conversation caught the attention of even Vikir, who was lost in thought.A young Baskerville had casually mentioned something.\u201c\u2026\u2026 So, in our line, he\u2019s going to the Academy?\u201dThe Academy \u2018Colosseo\u2019An Imperial compulsory school where the Seven Houses of the Empire send their young heirs to be educated.Due to the academy\u2019s capacity limitations, the number of students admitted is limited to a small number from each family.Naturally, only the most elite young people from each family are allowed to attend, which is something Bikir was interested in.Of course, he doesn\u2019t have the greed for fame or the desire for education that the other kids do.\u201cIt\u2019s a chance to get away from Hugo and improve my skills.Of course, there\u2019s more to it than that. Like paying back a debt from a previous life, or gaining control of a hidden artifact.As Vikir ponders his next move.\u201cMaster.\u201dA voice called to him from behind.An old voice, but still strong. A warm, gentle demeanor.Deacon John Barrymore came to stand at Vikir\u2019s side.He was one of the few people Vikir had ever felt sorry for in his previous life, and Vikir had come to trust him.Then Deacon Barrymore leaned closer to Vikir and whispered.\u201cMy lord wants to see you.\u201dHugo le Baskerville?It was always unusual for him to seek out his children.At Vikir\u2019s puzzled look, Barrymore smirked and continued.\u201cI believe he has decided on your position.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Vikir noticed a single, relatively recent scar across the bridge of Hugo\u2019s nose.It had been there before the regression, but Vikir had no idea how it had come to be, and his eyes lit up.\u201cGreetings.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dHugo answered briefly, then nodded.Vikir continued his casual conversation in a nonchalant tone.When Vikir asked about the scar on the bridge of his nose, Hugo shrugged it off as nothing.\u201cI was struck by an arrow while slaying the enemy and the barbarians of the Black Mountains.\u201dVikir was a little surprised.The mighty Hugo Baskerville could be wounded by an arrow.There was no way a man of Hugo\u2019s stature as a Swordmaster could have been struck by a blind arrow; there must have been a sniper targeting him.Hugo smirked.\u201cThere\u2019s a woman who can shoot a bow.\u201d\u201cDid you catch her?\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. But I did carve one of those same things into the fox thing\u2019s face.\u201dA swordsman of Hugo\u2019s caliber would have been able to scatter the aura of the blade\u2019s tip to intercept even the most distant foe.Hugo touched the bridge of his nose for a moment, feeling the scar across the bridge of his nose still throbbing.He paused for a moment, then spoke.\u201cAnyway. Congratulations on completing your training.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cFrom now on, it\u2019s harder.\u201dAt Hugo\u2019s words, Vikir nodded.As Guardian Knight Staffordshire Baskerville had told her at the end of her training, the real work begins now.Three and a half years of basic training to learn the theory of warfare, build physical strength, and develop an eye for opposition.Another three and a half years of practical training, including combat training against real demons and humans, and wilderness survival skills.But the enemies they\u2019re about to face, and the deep waters of the Black Mountains, are a hell that will negate everything they\u2019ve learned about survival.You can only survive if you have a good bloodline, or if you are willing to die for it.\u2018For the next twenty-one months, we\u2019ll be working with the enemy to open up the Black Mountains.Vikir thought as he recalled his pre-regression memories.If things had gone according to plan, he would have become an apprentice knight of the Pit Bull Knights at this point and been sent to the Red and Black Mountains, crossing countless lines of fire over the next 21 months.He would have been thrown into the fray like a hunting dog to be used a few times and then discarded.\u2026\u2026 But.Hugo has a rather unexpected proposal for Vikir.\u201cYou should be a member of the House of Representatives.\u201dIt was a surprise indeed.Hugo would train Vikir in the ways of the court.Of course, the Baskervilles are a family of seasoned warriors, so being a bard doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t fight.However, it is not uncommon for younger Baskervillians, especially those who are particularly gifted and skilled, to take the path of an unaffiliated warrior after serving as an officer.Hugo\u2019s nemesis and second son were on the same path.\u201cA man must be strong. As with the sword, so with power.\u201dVikir nodded at Hugo\u2019s words.While the other expendables were dying on the battlefield, the elites were learning about politics and administration, both within the family and outside.And when an elderly elite finally draws his sword and goes into battle, he\u2019ll have the seasoned expendables to assist him.The elite may start out a bit late, but he or she will build up his or her skills and accomplishments, and grow into an even bigger giant with the political and administrative experience he or she has learned.\u2018\u2026\u2026And only the elite can learn more than the Baskerville Five.\u2019This is why consumables are not taught higher level swordsmanship beyond Baskerville 5.It\u2019s so that the elites, who are late to the game, can catch up to the expendable hounds with little effort.It\u2019s the same reason why the higher-ups in the country don\u2019t teach the people to write.\u201cAs you say.\u201dVikir bowed respectfully.He\u2019d meant to move away from Hugo\u2019s side, but instead he\u2019d grown closer.It didn\u2019t matter much, though, as he hadn\u2019t yet shown much in the way of hidden skills, and this was good for Vikir in more ways than one, as it allowed him to get closer to the center of power.Hugo explained Vikir\u2019s new position as an MP simply.\u201cThe House of Representatives assists the Baskervilles in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the House of Baskerville\u2019s territory, as well as attracting business for the House and running the affairs of the House, in short.\u201dSuccessful House members are promoted to Senator, which allows them to deal with matters outside of the House, which is not something Vikir is currently interested in.Drac-Hugo opened a drawer and pulled out a few papers.Deacon Barrymore quickly stood beside him with his seal and sigil.\u201cYour new position is Deputy Magistrate of the City of Underdog.\u201dUnderdog City, Vikir knew well.The busiest town in the vast territory ruled by the Baskervilles. No, it was more of a metropolis than a town.The Archon is the one who oversees the legislative and judicial affairs of the city, and the Deputy Archon is responsible for assisting the Archon in various ways.Vikir looked at his appointment letter and said.\u201cSo it\u2019s about making and enforcing laws.\u201d\u201cYes, and there are currently vacancies for both the Archon and Deputy Archon positions.\u201dThere was a reason why the positions of one magistrate and several deputy magistrates were all vacant.Originally, Underdog City\u2019s ruler was Hugo\u2019s second son, and the second son\u2019s relatives who took the Baskerville surname were the deputy rulers.But now Hugo\u2019s second son was long gone, and the deputy magistrates who were supposed to take his place had been fired or suspended en masse for bribery.And Hugo intends to hand over all the powers and duties of those vacant posts to Vikir.\u201cIt\u2019s a city that\u2019s become a state-free zone. Can you do a good job?\u201dVikir nodded.Deputy magistracies are usually held by men in their thirties, but occasionally a prodigy, a genius among geniuses, will hold the position in their early twenties.And it was likely that these young elites would one day take on important positions representing their families.\u2018\u2026\u2026 For example, they would be admitted to the Academy.\u2019And after four years of studying at the academy, they would return to the family and immediately become a magistrate.An elite course for the elite.What Hugo proposed to Vikir was an equally unconventional appointment.\u201cI think you\u2019re giving me too much power.\u201d\u201cAnd a great deal of responsibility.\u201dHugo said with a dry laugh.\u201cYour achievements are at least ten years ahead of the children who are considered geniuses within the family, so I will treat you accordingly.\u201dTreatment includes both rights and duties.The greater the power, the heavier the duty.Or, to put it another way, the heavier the task, the greater the power.\u201cI will endeavor to live up to my lord\u2019s expectations.\u201dHugo nodded wordlessly.And then.\u2026the land!A piece of paper was stamped with Hugo\u2019s seal.With that, Vikir became the deputy magistrate, the de facto magistrate, of a metropolitan underdog with a population of half a million.\u2018This is good.Vikir thought.\u2018If I use the power of the Deputy Magistrate well, I can train my skills much more safely than if I go straight into the fray.His hidden teeth and claws would be sharpened.And then. Vikir opened his mouth.\u201cMy lord.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dHugo looked up.There was a glimmer of warmth in his eyes that had been absent since the end of the mission.Vikir seized on the threadbare warmth.\u201cI\u2019d like to tell you about the ruby mine in Morgawa.\u201dSeven years ago, an eight-year-old Vikir had done something daring against Morg\u2019s envoys that had made Hugo\u2019s stomach turn.Hugo had been so pleased that he had promised Vikir a reward, though he hadn\u2019t asked for exactly what it was.And now, Vikir was asking for a reward for his behavior in a very clear way.\u201cI was wondering if I could borrow \u2026\u2026.\u201dHugo looked a little troubled at that.\u201cHmmm. Yes, I did, and I made it clear then that I would reward you. You said you\u2019d tell me if you wanted something.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to listen if you don\u2019t want to.\u201dHugo\u2019s thick eyebrows arched at that.\u201cIt won\u2019t be difficult.\u201dHe nodded, then pulled another piece of paper from a drawer and stamped it with his lordship\u2019s seal.\u201cI trust you won\u2019t do anything stupid. Son.\u201dNo matter how many times I hear him say \u201cson,\u201d I never get used to it.And in truth, Vikir was more surprised by Hugo\u2019s willingness to grant his request than by the title.\u201cI would never have dared to ask you for a favor before \u2026\u2026.Perhaps things will go more smoothly than I thought.* * *Stepping out of the guest room, Vikir walked down the long hallway.Behind him, Deacon Barrymore smiled gently.\u201cMaster.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cMy lord is very fond of you.\u201dVikir remained silent, not saying anything.Then Deacon Barrymore spoke.\u201cI can see that you\u2019re not going to put him in the field right away, but you\u2019re going to give him the position of de facto ruler. Isn\u2019t that the art of imperialism? You\u2019re going to use him big and heavy.\u201dLiterally, if you\u2019re going to raise a hound to be used and discarded, you should send it out into the battlefield right now to die.While the hounds are seasoned by their encounters with death, their would-be masters are armed with ideas and knowledge from a safe place.And from this foothold, the hounds leap to the heights of the untouchable.In the end, the lower life cannot overcome the higher, even if it dies and rebirths. Neither by words nor by martial arts.It\u2019s a bitter pill to swallow for Vikir, who is feeling it all over again.\u201cThat\u2019s if I do a good job as Deputy Magistrate.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do just fine, Master, and if you do anything more than passably well there, you\u2019ll be the next one to enter the Academy.\u201dDeacon Barrymore had noticed that Vikir was interested in the Academy as well.\u2026\u2026 although he couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on why.Meanwhile.Vikir\u2019s mind was racing with the policies and exploits of the famous bureaucrats he had seen and heard about before his regression.The letter of appointment to the position of Deputy Magistrate, stamped with the seal of Hugo le Baskerville, Lord of Ironblooded Baskerville, slipped deep into the pocket of Vikir\u2019s arm.\u201cYou\u2019ll have to prove yourself quickly.\u201dThere were many ways to prove oneself and move up the ranks in a short period of time.Vikir chose the quickest and most obvious one.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At least I had some hope that Baskerville was from the inside.\u201dI hadn\u2019t gotten my hopes up when the 15-year-old kid said he was coming, but now they were dashed.Even now, the sound of clinking glasses, giggling women, and singing clowns could be heard outside the window.Baskerville, the Chihuahua, twitched his goatee nervously and threw down his filing cabinet.\u201cYeah, damn it, it takes a damned underdog cigar to wake me up and just\u2026\u2026!?\u201dBut he couldn\u2019t get his complaint out.Creak-The door to his office opened, revealing a boy.Vikir Van Baskerville. The new Archon.He was finally officially in the office.\u201cYou\u2019re the head of the office.\u201dThe Chihuahua Baskerville gave Vikir a mock polite look.\u201cYes, sir. I\u2019m Chihuahua Baskerville.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have a middle name.\u201dThe Chihuahua\u2019s expression hardened slightly at Vikir\u2019s words.To not even have a middle name for a half-breed or illegitimate child was to be from outside the family.Usually, those brought in from the outside were indentured servants within the Baskervilles for three years before being given the Baskerville surname and formally admitted into the family, which was exactly what Staffordshire and Chihuahua had done.Strictly speaking, they are not blood relatives, but users.The new deputies would always use this as a way to discriminate against the newcomers.So Chihuahua had to put up with the bitterness of this atmosphere.But.\u201cGood.\u201dVikir\u2019s assessment came as a surprise.As the Chihuahua\u2019s eyes widened, Vikir recalled a memory from the past.\u201cChihuahua Baskerville, yes, I recognize the name.He\u2019s a skinny guy, and his goatee gives him the image of a lowly ganeshin, but he\u2019s surprisingly kind-hearted.And because he was an outsider, he faced a lot of discrimination, and his accomplishments were often labeled as those of a ruler or deputy ruler.This was something that Vikir identified with.Vikir also doesn\u2019t trust his own family members, and outsiders with proven credentials are much more trustworthy.\u201cI took a quick look at your bio on the way in. You\u2019re from Underdog City, right?\u201d\u201cYes? Yes, yes, I\u2019m a native, born and raised here.\u201d\u201cThen you know the lay of the land better than I, a newcomer to the city.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026That\u2019s right.\u201dThe Chihuahua hesitated to answer, then realized he shouldn\u2019t have.He knew from experience that this would be followed by a string of \u201cIf you know so much, why don\u2019t you do it?\u201d, \u201cIf you\u2019re so good, why are you working for me?\u201d, \u201cHow dare you try to boss me around?\u201d, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just do it all?\u201d, and so on.But once again, Vikir\u2019s answer was unexpected.\u201cI know the hard work of the people who actually run on the field, and I have no intention of interfering with their principles, customs, or styles.\u201dThe Chihuahua went blank at that.He hadn\u2019t expected to hear these words from someone from within the family.Naturally, he was expecting a sense of privilege and to tear down all the old customs as bad.\u201cWell, at least you don\u2019t seem to be a carcinogenic character.If it didn\u2019t do any good, at least it wouldn\u2019t do any harm.While the Chihuahua breathed a sigh of relief, Vikir flipped through the papers on his desk.Parallax.The sound of the papers being flipped, and the Chihuahua didn\u2019t expect Vikir to be looking at them.But to his surprise, Vikir was looking at all of them carefully.And then. Closing the papers, Vikir said.\u201cI don\u2019t see anything wrong with the legislative system, but there are a lot of oddities in the judicial system.\u201d\u201cWhat? You\u2019ve seen all that, the bird?\u201dChihuahua asked in amazement. The papers here are hundreds of pages long.But Vikir already knew a lot about the Underdog City.It was one of the more prominent cities in the pre-Reversion spy and planting operations.\u201cThere are illegal gambling houses, brothels, slave auctions, and all sorts of private banking going on in the territory. The underground economy of Underdog City is probably quite substantial.\u201dThe Chihuahua\u2019s eyes narrowed.Vikir continued.\u201cPerhaps these are the factors that led to the departure of the previous deputy magistrates. It will not be easy to break the cycle without some sort of compromise.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAye. What do you think, you underdog native?\u201dVikir asks outright, and the Chihuahua can only twitch his lips.Not only has Vikir grasped all these documents and gotten to the heart of Underdog City\u2019s core issues, but he\u2019s also consulted with her on the most important issues without looking down on her as a subordinate from the outside.And he came to me on his first day, even a day in advance!At this sudden turn of events, which defied common sense, the Chihuahua could only stammer, unable to answer.Vikir smirks.\u201cIt\u2019s actually quite easy to take down an underground economy, you just have to get to the heart of the matter, hidden amongst the dotty remnants of lawlessness.\u201dIn a previous life, Vikir had a long history of battling illegal organizations in the underdog city.As a result, he knew almost everything about who was committing what crimes and where they were hiding.He even knew the locations and identities of the bureaucrats who were taking bribes.\u2018It\u2019s worth it,\u2019 I thought, \u2018to look through the black books left over from the pre-Regression busting of the illegal organizations.It\u2019s the job of a deputy magistrate to make and enforce laws.Vikir got right to work.\u201cI honor all the laws that have come before. I\u2019m just adding one new law to them.\u201d\u201cA new law?\u201d\u201cYes. It won\u2019t be very long, a few lines at most.\u201dVikir\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cWithin a week, we will have dried up the seeds of Underdog City\u2019s underground economy.\u201dShort and bold, he finished and floated off to the Academy.There was a war on crime to come, and some laws that would be necessary.\u201cAnd to create and enforce these laws, we need a rationale.\u201dHearing Vikir murmur, the Chihuahua felt herself slowly being drawn into the strange aura the boy exuded.She couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cWhat\u2019s the point? Why do you want to fight lawlessness\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still young, and above all, am I not a rookie who will be joining the force tomorrow?\u201dVikir looked back at the Chihuahua and smirked.\u201cIsn\u2019t the least you could do is give me a \u2018warning\u2019?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dThe Chihuahua shakes his head, unable to understand Vikir\u2019s words.But Vikir doesn\u2019t bother to explain further.Instead, he strokes his chin as he looks out the window of the ruler\u2019s office and down at the bar.Pour, drink. The gathering to welcome the new Deputy Archon, Vikir, is already large.In fact, the party was going strong even without him.And Vikir, who should be the center of attention, is sitting in the high council chambers right now, planning tomorrow\u2019s events.\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes. You gotta shit to catch shit flies.\u201dVikir\u2019s voice, muttering in a low voice, had an edge to it that didn\u2019t belong to a 15-year-old.And the Chihuahua thought.Maybe this encounter with the boy in front of him would change his entire life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Laws only favor those with power.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all the same to the big guys.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it a world where the law-abiding are the losers?\u201d\u201cThe law is far away, the fist is closer.\u201dThe citizens of Underdog City, which has an unusually high crime rate, scoff at the Manahan Law.They\u2019ve seen it all before, how the bureaucrats from Baskerville, the fat cats, and the second and third generations of Sedoga collude to get their way.The moneyed, the powerful, and the mighty make it work in their favor, interpret it, enforce it, and\u2026\u2026.If you\u2019re broke, poor, and powerless, there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.All they can do is cry, drink, blame themselves for their bad luck, or take out their anger on those less fortunate and weaker than them.Underdog citizens accustomed to this fate are naturally distrustful of the law.\u201cWell, at least the previous deputy magistrates were busted for bribery, so maybe it will make a difference.\u201d\u201cOf course not, the new deputy from Baskerville is 15 years old.\u201d\u201cWhat? Fifteen is the same age as my youngest daughter. What\u2019s a girl like that supposed to do\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Pretty soon she\u2019ll be roasting in the lobby of the local lords.\u201dPublic opinion was not very favorable to the new deputy.Some cite his age, some cite his unwritten laws, some cite his scattered gangs, and some cite the myriad temptations that await the novice bureaucrat.Just then.\u201cHey, guys, come on down to the main square! Big news!\u201dThe already bustling place became even more bustling.People rush to the square to see what\u2019s going on.Thousands and thousands of people.And in the middle of it all, as if a meteorite had fallen, there is an empty spot.A circular space where no one has set foot.In the center of it all, a cold-faced boy stands with a stick.It was Vikir van Baskerville, the newest deputy magistrate, 15 years old.* * *Vikir held a stick in his hand.Seventy centimeters long. A small stake weighing about three kilograms.People crowded around to see the new deputy magistrate, but they never got close.That\u2019s because of the mountainous energy emanating from the boy\u2019s tiny body.Behind this untouchable aura, several government officials stood nervously.They were employees of the Executive Office, including Chihuahua Baskerville.\u201cOh, my God, what is he going to do?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s been standing there since the crack of dawn, do you understand?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people here, wow-\u201dThe citizens and officials alike had no idea what Vikir was trying to do here.Then.\u201cListen.\u201dSeeing that the audience was more or less gathered, Vikir spoke.\u201cI am the new deputy magistrate.\u201dThe murmurs around him grew louder.\u201cHe\u2019s that young?\u201d, \u201cHe looks even younger in person\u201d, \u201cHe\u2019s cute\u201d, \u201cWhat would a kid like that do?\u201d, and other unserious comments.Ignoring the stares and voices, Vikir continued.\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all seen the notice on the north side of the square.\u201dFor a moment, the crowd\u2019s eyes shifted to the north.Sure enough, there it was, a law written on a large banner.<Constitution of the Autonomous Region of Baskerville, Article 00, Section 0.

This is a man from the Baskerville family! Will it take a blade to slice through his throat to get him to come to his senses!\u201dChihuahua\u2019s director is a local official who is well-liked by the citizens.So even the people who were booing him craned their necks in recognition.\u201cChet. Mr. Chihuahua is talking over there, let\u2019s stop.\u201d\u201cGee, I wonder how the director is more charismatic than the deputy director.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d rather have Mr. Chihuahua be the deputy.\u201d\u201cLook at that little guy. He can\u2019t even respond to the boos without Mr. Chihuahua.\u201d\u201cThe law is about to get even more fucked up.\u201dThese are reactions that would have been unthinkable under normal circumstances, but Vikir\u2019s youthfulness, youthful face, and indifference to the reactions around him allowed them to get away with it.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThis time, Vikir didn\u2019t react at all.Even in this atmosphere of being compared to and devalued by his subordinate Chihuahua, Vikir simply stood there with an expressionless face.The city officials, including Chihuahua\u2019s secretary general, blushed and didn\u2019t know what to do.Meanwhile, even the citizens, who were booing at Vikir\u2019s unresponsive behavior, were feeling drained.\u201cMaybe he\u2019s just a kid, but he can\u2019t handle these insults.\u201d\u201cHow can a kid like him be expected to enforce the law?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s just going to let the criminals run rampant \u2026\u2026 for a while.\u201dGazes of abandonment and resignation, mockery and anger, pity and contempt, were being directed at one Vikir.And then.Vikir raised the stick he was holding high.And then.\u2026poof!He drove it straight into the ground.Ten centimeters into the ground.It\u2019s pretty heavy, but it\u2019s only a small stake.A child could easily pull it out.\u2026\u2026?When all the citizens are looking puzzled.Vikir, who had taken a few steps back, spoke up.\u201cI am hereby promulgating a new special law under the legislative authority of the Deputy Magistrate.\u201dArticle 1, Section 1 of the Vikir Special Law.\u201cWhoever pulls this stake will be paid 100 million gold in cash.\u201dIt was as simple as that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

One hundred million gold is four years\u2019 worth of rust rods for ordinary people.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re offering 100 million for a wooden stick?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s this for, a show?\u201dPeople chattered. They all stare at Vikir with unreadable expressions.And that included Chihuahua Baskerville and other officials from the Enforcement Division.The chatter only increased slightly, but when no one stepped forward, Vikir spoke again.\u201cAnyone else?\u201dNo one answered the question.By this time, Vikir had picked up his quill and scribbled a few more words on the notice.-Vikir\u2019s Special Law, Article 1, Section 2-.-The person who pulls this stake (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cstake\u201d) shall be paid an additional 900,000,000 gold, as determined by the Deputy Magistrate, Vikir Van Baskerville.One hundred million gold and nine hundred million more.\u201cWhoever pulls this stake will be paid one billion gold in cash.\u201dA billion gold! That\u2019s a sum of money that no ordinary man can touch until he dies.The people began to laugh.\u201cThis is ridiculous.\u201d\u201cAre you kidding me? What kind of fool would do this?\u201d\u201cHey, kid, don\u2019t play around, let\u2019s go in!\u201d\u201cThis is pretty funny now that I look at it, isn\u2019t it some kind of stand-up comedy?\u201dThe people gathered in the square were stunned by the absurdity of the situation.Some of them even openly call Vikir a clown.But Vikir remains nonchalant.\u201cIs anyone here?\u201dHe asks, and he hears a few laughing responses from around him.The faces of the enforcement officials, including Chihuahua Baskerville, turn bright red.\u201cWhy is the embarrassment on us!The officials in the back are fidgeting, unable to withstand the taunts of the citizens.Vikir nonchalantly raises his brush.-Article 1, paragraph 3 of the Vikir Special Law-.-To the person who pulls this stake (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe stake\u201d), there shall be paid an additional 9,000,000,000 gold, as determined by the Deputy Magistrate, Vikir Van Baskerville.A total of ten billion.At the mention of this sum, the room fell silent at once.A deathly silence.\u201cWhoever pulls this stake will be paid 10 billion gold in cash.\u201dArticle 3 of the Special Law of Vikir was proclaimed.The stares and sneering taunts are gone, and the central square is silent, as if nothing is alive.The absence of sound, despite the huge crowds of people, gave me chills.Chihuahua Baskerville and all the officials of the Executive Office were momentarily overwhelmed by the silence on such a massive scale.But Vikir remained nonchalant.\u201cIs anyone there?\u201dThis time, no one answered the question.The citizens stared, unable to laugh or talk.\u201cWhat, what is this? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cAre you really offering 10 billion? Should we leave?\u201d\u201cAre you crazy? You know what you\u2019ll get if you leave.\u201d\u201cLook at that knife in his waistband. I don\u2019t want to be executed for being a rich bastard.\u201dYou never know.Why is this young deputy magistrate, who has just been appointed, doing this?No one in the room had any idea why anyone would want to burn 10 billion dollars on a stake that anyone could easily pull out.\u201cCould it be that the stake is really heavy, so heavy that a normal person can\u2019t even pull it out?\u201d\u201cNot likely. I\u2019ve seen government employees carrying them around.\u201d\u201cHey, don\u2019t go out there! They\u2019ve got something else up their sleeve!\u201d\u201cIn times like this, it\u2019s best to stay out of it.\u201dIt\u2019s quiet in the square, with only the occasional shouting match.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThen Vikir picked up his brush again.He was about to create Article 4 of the Special Law.\u201cI\u2026\u2026 let me try!\u201dFrom the crowd, a palm the size of a small film rose.It was a girl in shabby clothes, a basket of wilted flowers in her hand.She had a limp, and her face was pockmarked with spots that suggested malnutrition.She raises her hand and steps forward, only to be stopped by a gracious old man.Presumably a neighbour.\u201cHey, Judy, aren\u2019t you Judy! You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing out here!\u201d\u201cGrandpa, I\u2019m fine, my mum\u2019s sick and I\u2019ve got to do something, there\u2019s no flowers for the bullies these days\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou naive boy, you\u2019ll get stabbed if you step in at a time like this! You shouldn\u2019t be so ignorant of the world\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHehe. If anything happens to me, please do me a favour, mum.\u201dJudy stepped out into the square, avoiding the disapproving neighbour\u2019s grandfather.Vikir looked down at Judy with a cold stare.\u201cPull it out.\u201dJudy clutched her hair as tightly as she could.The citizens looked at the little girl with uneasy eyes.Partly pitying, partly mocking, partly intrigued to see what would happen to the poor little thing in the next few seconds.Meanwhile, Judy was breaking out in a cold sweat.\u2018Oh, come on, they\u2019re going to have to kill me,\u2019 she thought, \u2018I\u2019ve been a laughing stock in public like this\u2026\u2026 and they\u2019re going to have to give me a few bucks.\u2019How much would it cost to be a clown in front of so many people?\u2018I hope I can get a basket of flowers for it.\u2019Then I can take a steaming bowl of meat porridge to my sick mum.Judy stretched out her hand under Vikir\u2019s cold gaze.Her trembling little hand gripped the stake.And then.\u2026snap!The stake was pulled out.The stake was light enough to be pulled out with the strength of a girl who hadn\u2019t even eaten blood porridge.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dJudy was baffled by the ease with which the stake was pulled out.So was the crowd watching, and so were the officials from the Enforcement Office.\u201cPulled it.\u201d\u201cI got it.\u201d\u201cPulled it.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s got it.\u201dThe chatter around me grows louder.What will happen to the girl who pulled the stake now?That was the initial concern, the one that had the crowd gathered here on the edge of their seats.And then.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir raised his hand.He moved his hand to his waistband. It was where the hilt of his sword dangled.Seeing it, Judy squeezed her eyes shut.\u201cHe\u2019s being executed.She didn\u2019t know what the crime was, but it was probably some sort of insult to nobility, some sort of insolence, some sort of greed, some sort of vice.In that brief moment, Judy thought of all the people she cared about. Who would take care of her mum if she left like this?Just then.\u201cNo!\u201dA near-terminal scream erupted.A skinny woman burst through the crowd.Her clothes were rags, her body skeletal and skinned, and she looked like she was dying, but somehow she found the strength to pull Judy into her arms and kneel before Vikir.\u201cMy lord, please, please have mercy!\u201dJudy\u2019s mother. She fell at Vikir\u2019s feet with Judy and began to plead.\u201cThe lowly dared to be arrogant, not guessing the intentions of the High. Please forgive me just once, I\u2019m a good\u2026\u2026 child, I\u2019m a good girl, I\u2019ve survived my father\u2019s death, I\u2019ve fed my sick mother, and I\u2019ve been selling flowers on the streets day after day, even though I\u2019m sick\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe mother began to sob uncontrollably.\u201cPlease forgive us\u2026\u2026 lowly things like us don\u2019t even dare to be pressed with the blood of your sword\u2026\u2026 please turn a blind eye just this once, please\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe mother slashed her forehead on the ground, begging for her daughter\u2019s life.At her cries, the crowd began to get angry.\u201c\u2026\u2026ma, that\u2019s good! What did Judy do wrong!\u201d\u201cThere was never another girl in this market as sincere and good as Judy!\u201d\u201cWhat did that mother and daughter do wrong!\u201d\u201cWho are you to persecute Judy when you have the power!\u201dThe atmosphere in the square turned nasty.The crowd, which had been as quiet as death, began to boil.The officials, including Chihuahua, shuffle their feet nervously in what looks like a riot at any moment.\u2026\u2026Then.Vikir reached for Judy.His hand passed over the hilt of his sword and clutched the leather hilt behind it.Tsk-tsk.Vikir thrust the heavy leather sack in front of Judy\u2019s eyes.Judy stares, dumbfounded, at the sack and then at Vikir\u2019s face.Then, with trembling hands, she takes the sack and hands it over.She pulls on the straps of this incredibly heavy leather sack.\u2026Pow!A blindingly bright golden glow emanates from within the sack.Gold coins. Countless, countless, countless.For a moment, the room falls silent again.Judy, her mother, the countless others watching the poor mother and daughter, all fell silent in unison.Vikir spoke.\u201cTen billion gold.\u201dThe words were like some kind of oracle.Judy and her mother were simply kneeling there, dumbfounded, in front of a sum of money they had never seen, heard, or imagined.And it was the same for everyone watching.\u201cThis is how the \u2026\u2026 law works.\u201dBy this time, Vikir had declared to all the citizens filling the square.\u201cIt will be upheld.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It will be upheld.The short speech of the newly appointed young deputy magistrate was on the lips of countless people.Naturally, Vikir\u2019s law, or \u201cVikir\u2019s Special Law,\u201d became even more famous than Baskerville\u2019s self-governance.The gossips were saying.\u201cThe new deputy magistrate is different, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cVikir says that once he says something, he does it no matter what.\u201d\u201cThey say the crime rate in Underdog City has dropped by half since that day.\u201d\u201cIt used to be said that the law was far away and the fist was near, but now the law is near and the fist is far away.\u201dBreak the law and you\u2019re punished; follow the law and you\u2019re rewarded.This simple principle impressed the citizens.A society that stands by its principles.The distrust of the law, which was not being followed, was washed away after that day.The day after the special law was promulgated, illegal activities were noticeably reduced and the crime rate was halved.The darkness that had been so deeply rooted in the underdog city had been cleared by this one performance.* * *Underdog City Hall.The director of Chihuahua Baskerville was smiling and writing on a signboard.<Imokji Shin (\u79fb\u6728\u4e4b\u4fe1)>A banner to be hung in the Governor\u2019s office from this day forward.Vikir stared at it from Chihuahua\u2019s side, then spoke up.\u201cYour handwriting is very good, Chihuahua.\u201d\u201cSure. I\u2019ve never met anyone with better penmanship than me since I was born, and I\u2019ve gotten so good at imitating other people\u2019s handwriting because the Archons always make me sign for them\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Chihuahua didn\u2019t finish his sentence.Vikir had blurted out something unexpected.\u201cCan\u2019t I learn to do that too?\u201dThe Chihuahua\u2019s eyes widened at Vikir\u2019s words.It was the first time a high-snouted member of the Baskerville clan from the main family had ever asked him to do something that wasn\u2019t a command.Moreover, despite being a sword eater, he was interested in brushes.\u201cOf course I can teach you, I\u2019d be honoured!\u201d\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll ask you whenever I have time.\u201dThe Chihuahua hums and teases the brush after hearing the praise.Vikir watched him in wonder.Chihuahua Baskerville.He was an outsider, a commoner who had spent three years as an indentured servant to the Baskervilles before being given the surname of Baskerville and formally integrated into the family.Unlike the swordsmen who become Guardian Knights and are trained in Baskerville-style swordsmanship, administrators are paid less and receive no special training.While swordsmen are motivated to become part of the Baskerville family, as mastery of the Baskerville style of swordsmanship improves their skills by several levels, administrators like Chihuahua have little to attract them other than honour.\u2018As I understand it, \u2026\u2026 he joined Baskerville with the sole intention of serving his homeland.\u2019Vikir had seen the Chihuahua a few times before his regression.A man who, for all that he looked like a ganeshin, had the temper of a high priestess, and who spouted off to the rulers and deputy rulers.And a capable administrator who was relegated to the fringes and never saw the light of day until he was old and dead.Vikir was thinking about the Chihuahua.\u201cBy the way, you\u2019re doing a great job, sir.\u201dThe Chihuahua finished his whistle and looked at Vikir.\u201cWho would have thought you could pull off such an unconventional performance, Chihuahua? I\u2019m truly blown away, and I\u2019ve been here for 20 years, just as a clerk, and I\u2019ve never been so thrilled. I\u2019m still shaking in my boots.\u201dVikir nodded slightly.\u201cThe laws of Baskerville are actually pretty good. But it\u2019s not enough to put a law out there, it\u2019s important that the people believe in it and follow it.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, and you\u2019re absolutely right. But that\u2019s not what the previous Deputy Magistrates thought.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to be angry at the manors for their distrust of the law or their ignorance of it, so I\u2019ve been thinking about how to engage them and make a strong impression on them.\u201dIn fact, this is a performance that Camus of the House of Morg would perform quite some time later.As soon as he ascends to the position of Lord of the Manor, Camus of Morg, who will later be known as the Auspicious Weather, becomes a formidable figure of power and turns his domain into a strong law-and-order region.The lords of the land would not pick up money that fell to the ground, and there were no quarrels among them, so much so that the crime rate dropped to almost zero.\u2018\u2026\u2026 However, his reign of terror did not endear him to the lords.However, in the midst of the war against the demons, Camu\u2019s iron fist was able to increase human survival rates by leaps and bounds, and indeed, even after the Generation of Destruction, Morg\u2019s estate had the largest population of survivors left.\u2026\u2026That was the last thing on his mind right now.\u201cNow it\u2019s about going forward.\u201dVikir said, looking down at the map of Underdog City.\u201cWith 10 billion in prize money, we\u2019re going to have to find a way to fill the hole, right?\u201dWith that, Vikir picked up a pen and began drawing red X\u2019s all over the map.As if he knew exactly where everything was, Vikir drew an X in every nook and cranny.X X X X X X X X X\u2026\u2026In no time at all, the number of X\u2019s on the map rose to over a hundred.\u201cThese are the places where illegal organisations are hiding or will hide in the future. We\u2019re going to crack down on them one by one and return the black money to the treasury.\u201d\u201cUh, how do you know these places are where criminals operate?\u201d\u201cI smell it.\u201dVikir presses his nose to his lips and smirks.Baskerville\u2019s hounds have a keen sense of smell.With the dazed Chihuahua behind him, Vikir continues to recite his plan.\u201cIn military law, the highest form of procurement is from enemy territory. If we rob everything here, we\u2019ll raise a lot of tax revenue. We can use it to bolster the welfare system for the poor.\u201d\u201cYeah. That\u2019s despite the crime rate being cut in half. The performance has reduced the overt crimes, but the ones that remain have become more stealthy and sophisticated.\u201dBut it doesn\u2019t matter.Vikir knew the location of all of these illegal outfits, and the key players at the heart of them.\u201cIt\u2019s an area we patrolled and cracked down on tirelessly before we went back.I still have vivid memories of being a hound dog during the \u2018War on Crime\u2019, frantically biting rats in the back alleys.I also knew the tricks of the trade because some of my close colleagues had been bribed.I know how criminals think and behave, where they hide, what they do, how they operate, and how far they go.I also knew all the channels through which underground money would flow for at least the next 25 years.Whirring, whirring, whirring.Beelzebub, lurking in the artery in my wrist, senses life and begins to twitch slightly.It\u2019s hungry for blood.Just then.\u201cDeputy!\u201dThe door opens and a clerk enters, looking puzzled.\u201cThere\u2019s a request for an interview at \u2026\u2026.\u201dBoth Vicky and Chihuahua turn their heads at the words.Chihuahua asks first.\u201cWho\u2019s requesting an interview on official time? You\u2019ve been here less than two days.\u201d\u201cWell, that is. The Youth Self-Governance Committee of the local government office would like to meet with you once\u2026\u2026.\u201dThen the Chihuahua\u2019s face stiffened.It looked like it had finally arrived.Vikir broke the ice.\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying you want to see the farting bastards in the community?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026That\u2019s right, the youth wing of the Xiangcheng is made up of the second and third generations of the local retainers, especially the influential Sedoga.\u201dHe\u2019s asking to see Vikir among the youth of other smaller families within the Baskervilles\u2019 domain, indigenous families that have long held sway in the area.Most of them have direct or indirect ties to the Baskervilles, often by blood, sometimes by delay, sometimes by marriage.The Chihuahua spoke with an air of disdain in his voice that he could barely conceal, even with a tightly clenched fist.\u201cIt\u2019s the Youth Autonomy Committee of the Mali Township Office, but it\u2019s really just a messy social club. Apparently they have something to say about the \u2018Vikir Special Law\u2019.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026hmm.\u201dHearing that, Vikir leaned back on the couch, chin in hand.\u201cWhen you make a law to root out absurdity, it\u2019s the most corrupt places that make the most noise.The first backlash against Vikir\u2019s special law. Was it coming from the Autonomous Council?Turning to his Chihuahua, who was watching him anxiously, Vikir spoke briefly.\u201cThe dung beetles smelled it first.\u201dHadn\u2019t he been laying out the shit since his first day on the job, knowing that would happen?Now it\u2019s time to get rid of the city-eating pests.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I went to a club in the imperial capital the other day, and it was much more luxurious here.\u201d\u201cBesides, we\u2019re guarded by those Baskervilles. How safe are we?\u201d\u201cGiggle giggle \u2013 aren\u2019t the Baskervilles our hounds at this point?\u201dThe masters were not without their faults.While the Baskervilles were preoccupied with expanding their borders, they were rotting away inside.So where did the money come from to pay for all this luxury and debauchery?The main source of income for local tax collectors is actually quite modest.At best, the water taxes from the reservoirs that water the fields, road use taxes, tolls, and the proceeds from the sale of livestock\u2026\u2026 are just a small amount of money to pay the butlers and serfs.Both the money going out and the money coming in are small, but\u2026\u2026 in fact they had a hidden source of income.Illegal slave auctions.This is the kidnapping, imprisonment, and sale of unauthorised persons into slavery.In recent years, the Baskervilles\u2019 aggressive territorial expansion has displaced an increasing number of barbarian peoples, so they\u2019ve been sneaking around the world, luring them in with tricks or kidnapping them by force to sell them.In other words, they would work for free for the Baskervilles and pick up the crumbs.With no taxes and a steady flow of business, money naturally accumulates.With the black money they earned, the masters were able to spend their youth on fire.They can\u2019t put it in the bank because it\u2019s illegally earned, so they burn it all in cash machines.\u201cThe champagne tower is full! Go let the kids in! Bring in the good ones.\u201dThey sent the waiters away for a while.Then we started chattering amongst ourselves.\u201cBy the way,\u201d I said, \u201cit\u2019s so nice to have an uptight family like the Messinadnaros gone. We can have fun without all the prying eyes.\u201d\u201cActually, that\u2019s the way it should be. We\u2019re playing with our own money.\u201d\u201cGood thing we framed them and sent them packing, huh?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s not let them be members in the future.\u201dThey smoked bubbling hookahs and looked languid.One of them suddenly looked up.\u201cBy the way. By the way, have you guys heard about the new deputy?\u201d\u201cUh, yeah, I put in a request for an interview. He\u2019s got the Barnes surname.\u201d\u201cHmm. Well, if he\u2019s a half-breed, he must be a bastard.\u201d\u201cYou should feel honoured to be called by us.\u201d\u201cCackle, cackle, he\u2019s going to come running.\u201dThey always did something called \u201ctaming the junior bureaucrats\u201d when new deputy commissioners came in.It\u2019s not a big deal, it\u2019s just a little bit of an extravagant party to dazzle them.It was like putting a leash on a dog, saying, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to follow us, you\u2019re going to listen to us.\u201d The masters would chuckle.The masters chuckled.\u201cHis name is Vikir. Have you ever heard of him?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve never heard of him.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s 15. They say this is her first time out of the family.\u201d\u201cWhat? Isn\u2019t she a total brat?\u201d\u201cYeah, he\u2019s a brat. He\u2019s got a huge drinking problem the first time he came to city hall. He must be a bit of a wreck.\u201d\u201cC\u2019mon, if you think he\u2019ll fit in with us.\u201dThen one of the masters had a brilliant idea.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we tease him a little bit, while we\u2019re at it?\u201dHe extended his index finger and explained his plan.\u201cLater, we\u2019ll have a big party and invite him over. We\u2019ll get the best liquor, we\u2019ll get all the girls, and we\u2019ll have a good, old-fashioned fuck.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cAnd then later, after the party, we\u2019ll make him pay for the drinks.\u201dThe masters burst out laughing.\u201cOkay, okay, that sounds like fun.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think his eyes will pop out when he sees you begging?\u201d\u201cYou need to realise that your eldest son is spending this much money to entertain you. If you take it for granted, you\u2019ll go away.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think a 15-year-old civil servant would have the money, and he wouldn\u2019t be able to find a place to get it because he\u2019d be reprimanded if he reported it to his family.\u201d\u201cThen you can say it was a joke and pay him back later.\u201dThe masters had a plan for the new deputy bureaucrat, and how to roast him.Just then.\u201cGentlemen, the girls are here-!\u201dA waiter burst through the door with a huge grin on his face.Soon, numerous women peeked into the club room, amazed at the luxury.Some of them were familiar faces, and the masters waved at them.\u201cHey, you\u2019re back again?\u201d\u201cAfter all that?\u201d\u201cSend him away. We\u2019re happy for you, ugh.\u201d\u201cWhy? I thought she was pretty.\u201d\u201cHey, come over here and sit down this time!\u201dOne by one, the women entered the room.\u2026\u2026See?At the end of the line of girls, there was a strange one.A boy, maybe in his early teens? A very young looking boy.He followed the women into the room from the back of the queue, and it was so natural that the waiters didn\u2019t even bother to stop him.The seven masters scanned the women, cracking crude jokes, and finally spotted the boy.\u201cBut what\u2019s with him? Did you bring a male waiter? Well, he looks cute.\u201d\u201cOh, don\u2019t you know him?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201dThe teachers, the waiters, and the women all look puzzled.What is this kid doing here?One of the waiters raises his eyebrows.\u201cHe walked in so boldly that no one thought anything of it. How dare you, you little shack, tell me where\u2026\u2026!\u201dBut he couldn\u2019t quite reach out to grab the boy by the hair.Oops.The sound of something thick and hard breaking.The waiter suddenly realised that his wrist had been turned in a strange direction.\u201cUgh!\u201dThe boy had just broken a grown man\u2019s thick forearm with sheer brute force.\u201cWhat, what, you!\u201dThree or four waiters pounced at once, but it took less than a second before they were all on the floor.The masters\u2019 faces hardened slightly.\u201cWhat\u2019s with you, kid? What are you doing here? Do you know who your brothers are?\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dThe boy\u2019s voice was devoid of any emotion.\u201cThey\u2019re the idiots from Xiangcheng.\u201dNo respect, no fear, no cowering, not even a hint of contempt.The masters were stunned for a moment.Then, with a single, hearty laugh.\u201cThat\u2019s right. We\u2019re the idiots from Xiangcheng.\u201d\u201cHe must know who we are.\u201d\u201cThen we only need to know who he is.\u201d\u201cKid, who are you?\u201dThe masters were debating whether this was funny or not.But it was.The boy\u2019s next words wiped the smiles off their faces.\u201cVikir.\u201dThe new Deputy Magistrate.Vikir van Baskerville is here.The apprentices slid their feet off the table.Then he rose to his feet and asked.\u201cVice\u2026 Exarch? What brings you here\u2026\u2026.?\u201d\u201cYou called for me.\u201dAt Vikir\u2019s words, the masters exchanged another blank look.Then.\u201cWahahahahaha- this is hot, Deputy! I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d come so soon!\u201dThe mood is not good.Moreover, the masters had just been insulted, and their pride had been bruised.\u201cShall we start taming the new recruits right away?\u201d\u201cSure. Let\u2019s buy some liquor.\u201d\u201cWhat if we roast them, boil them, sit them down, and then ask them to pay for their drinks later at the end of the party\u2026\u2026?\u201dBut\u2026 their cute little plan didn\u2019t quite work out.\u2026Thud!Vikir slammed his hand on the table.And.Tsk, tsk, tsk\u2026\u2026The black aura of the Baskervilles emanated from him.The mana in Vikir\u2019s body radiated through his hand and into the table.A ferocious resonance, a violent vibration.Boom, boom, boom, boom\u2026\u2026On the table, in the glasses, the champagne suddenly began to boil.And then.The great tower of champagne in the centre of the room changed.\u2026Pow!A single glass at the top of the champagne tower suddenly exploded.Numerous glass shards and champagne drops sparkled and scattered below.\u2026Boom!\u2026clink! \u2026clink!\u2026clink! \u2026clink! \u2026clink! \u2026clink!\u2026clink! \u2026clink! \u2026clink! \u2026clink! \u2026clink! \u2026clink!The four glasses that were downstairs,nine glasses downstairs,16 glasses downstairs,and 25 glasses downstairs,36 glasses downstairs,49 glasses downstairs,64 glasses downstairs,81 glasses downstairs,100 glasses below that, all exploding and shattering one after the other.The champagne tower had collapsed.It didn\u2019t collapse from the bottom, it exploded backwards from the top.Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.Countless glass shards and champagne drops rained down on the VVIP room.Under the rain, the masters of Sedoga could only say one thing.\u201cWe were going to pay for the \u2026\u2026.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The realm of the truly badass.There is only one thought on everyone\u2019s minds.\u201cGradient!Monsters who can slice through boulders the size of their fists with their swords and knock down birds in flight with their momentum alone.I wonder if these masters, who are barely above the rank of Expert, are not some vague, untouchable powerhouse.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir\u2019s face remains expressionless.However, the black aura coursing through his shoulders is that of a grim reaper.If death had a tangible form, wouldn\u2019t it look like this?The masters, soaked in a shower of champagne, began to shiver.\u2018He\u2019s crazy, he\u2019s a 15-year-old kid!\u201cDude, you\u2019re an Expert Intermediate, do something!\u201cShut up! You won\u2019t last a second!In the midst of all the urgent exchanges of glances, one of the masters muttered in a dazed voice.\u201c\u2026\u2026That\u2019s right, Vikir, I thought I\u2019d heard of you!\u201dAt that, all eyes snapped to one side.He spoke in a stuttering tone.\u201cVikir van Baskerville. The supernova of House Baskerville! Dived for seven minutes before he was born, strangled two vipers in his cradle, hunted Cerberus at the age of eight, dueled and defeated House Morg\u2019s Madness Castle\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe other masters\u2019 faces change as if they\u2019ve just heard some crazy urban legend.But\u2026\u2026 But what if they were really true?The gazes of the masters now turn to Vikir again.The symbol of the Gradient, the liquid aura.Unless the urban legends are true, there\u2019s no way to explain the deathly aura that radiates from Vikir\u2019s entire body.My God, what other 15-year-old kid in the world is already a Gradient at that age!Even in Baskerville, the home of geniuses, this has never happened before.Perhaps the same could be said for the Coliseum, the Imperial Academy, or even the entire Yellow City.In the end, the masters could only smile awkwardly and say something.\u201cWe tried to pay for the \u2026\u2026.\u201dI wonder if they realise that the grim smile they\u2019ve always seen etched on other people\u2019s faces is now etched on their own?Meanwhile. Vikir, hearing this, replied nonchalantly.\u201cOf course you will pay for the liquor you have consumed.\u201dHearing this, the seven masters closed their mouths in disbelief.\u201cOh, by the way. We haven\u2019t eaten yet.He had inadvertently given away his plan to embarrass them.Still, since I hadn\u2019t met Meg yet, I thought I could make a good excuse and get away with it.\u2026\u2026 If only it weren\u2019t for Vikir.He\u2019s only 15 years old, but his soul is already worn out.Vikir saw right through what the seven masters were trying to do.\u201cWhat, you\u2019re going to play with me and then blame me for the cost of your drinks?\u201dThe seven masters jumped and shook their heads at Vikir\u2019s question, which seemed to pierce their veins like a ghost.\u201cThat, that would be impossible!\u201d\u201cWho would do such an unscrupulous thing!\u201d\u201cHow dare anyone from the Baskerville family ask us to\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe seven masters felt.The other party wasn\u2019t just strong in combat power. Their minds were also unstoppable.In the end, they lowered their tails.They had been arrogant enough to think that Baskerville was their dog, but now that they stood in front of Vikir, they could no longer afford to be so ruthless.Apparently, the Baskervilles\u2019 hounds are not easily baked or boiled.But a certain amount of pride, built up over the years as the second generation of the local holding family, has allowed them to save some dignity for last.\u201cActually, we wanted to test you, Deputy Magistrate.\u201dThe Masters composed themselves and spoke in a polite manner.Vikir remained expressionless.Taking the silence to mean \u2018let\u2019s hear it\u2019, the Masters relaxed and continued in a polite tone.\u201cHonestly, Underdog City is quite corrupt, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re going to purify a city like this, you shouldn\u2019t be able to resist such a temptation.\u201d\u201cYou are indeed worthy to lead us, I will follow.\u201d\u201cOh, let me take this great spirit as a lesson for the rest of my life!\u201d\u201cI will express it to you today, in such a way that you will not be disappointed later.\u201dThey bowed once more to Vikir, and spoke in earnest voices.Some of them even winked at Vikir in an attempt to appear casual.And then.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dOne corner of Vikir\u2019s mouth slowly lifted.A smile.This small change completely changed the mood of the room.Just a moment ago, it had been a creepy, graveyard atmosphere.And that alone had been enough to terrify the Seven Masters.But now?An almost maddening sense of gravity.A suffocating pressure began to weigh down on the seven masters, as if they were being buried alive in an earthen tomb.Unable to breathe properly, they began to shiver, the smiles on their faces completely lost.Vikir walked slowly to the front of the seven masters, who were now cowering like frogs in a snake\u2019s stomach.\u201cA master can test his dog as much as he likes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut not the other way round. A dog can never test his master, under any circumstances.\u201dIt was a moment that reminded her of Hugo\u2019s teaching from long ago.Vikir paced slowly in front of the frozen masters.\u201cYou have all this money and power, so you\u2019re not afraid, are you?\u201d he asked.Unsurprisingly, there was no reply.Vikir continued.\u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019ve never seen anything really scary.\u201dSo how dare you pretend to be expected, to be gentle, to be relaxed.And the price of that \u201cpretence\u201d was heavy.Vikir pulled a flimsy stick from his arm.It was the very same stake that had won the girl a prize of ten billion not long ago.\u2026Billion!A dull noise.The stake bent for a moment, then flew out at a tremendous speed, smashing the face of the master in front of her into a bloody mess.The blow came from nowhere, with no end in sight.Teeth gnashing, spittle, blood, and tears snorting.In the time it took him to blink three times, Vikir struck him seven times across the face, head, neck, and shoulders, and then did the same to the others.The next thing you know, they\u2019re all sprawled flat on the floor of the VVIP room.Puck! Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!Vikir didn\u2019t stop beating them for a long time after that.\u201cDo you know why you were beaten?\u201d\u201cEw! I don\u2019t know! I don\u2019t know! Why are you hitting me all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t know, you must be beaten.\u201dVikir swung the stake in a nonchalant tone.Looking at his expressionless face, the masters thought he might actually die at this rate.\u201cOh, I know, ugh, I think I know why you\u2019re hitting me!\u201dThe dogs begged desperately through their busted lips, torn tongues, and broken teeth.They pleaded with their torn lips, torn tongues, broken teeth, and the red blood that gushed like a fountain from every inch of their heads.But the owner remained unimpressed.\u201cSweeten the deal.\u201dVikir\u2019s flogging doesn\u2019t stop at the red light.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The new magistrate\u2019s personality doesn\u2019t seem normal, so they won\u2019t just be released, will they?\u201d\u201cAye, they\u2019re still the second generation of a native family, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll let them go with a moderate amount of humiliation.\u201dThe crowd naturally turned their heads away.In the northern part of the central square, a banner was still fluttering in the wind.<Article 00, paragraph 0 of the Constitution of the Autonomous Region of Baskerville.

He burned ten billion on a single stake!\u201d\u201cIf you kill those seven bastards, the repercussions will be devastating.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just give them a few good whacks and humiliate them?\u201d\u201cYes. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll get the death penalty, though.\u201dThey all spoke in unison.This is a power game between the new politicians and the indigenous tycoons, and if the latter would just bow out and keep their heads down, everything would be smooth sailing.And just as people thought, Mont Blanc, Pierre, Louis Vuitton, Channel, Ferragamo, Herm\u00e8s, and Prada offered their sincere apologies to the new deputy.The local retainers bowed and entered.The citizens did the same and clicked their tongues when they saw the carriages representing each family, laden with lavish tributes, making their way to City Hall in the dead of night.The seven rascals who had been detained would now be released unharmed and would be given a good shouting match by their landlord father.That was the end of it.The local keepers will either avenge this humiliation in some way, or they will bow down and look the other way, and for a time the seven rascals will do their time and keep quiet.The new, young deputy magistrate has scored a nice victory over the native wealthy.The citizens will be moderately pleased, moderately outraged, and moderately forgetful of this obvious outcome.They will.\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026No, I knew it would happen.Until this morning, when seven heads were hung in the centre of the main square.Seven heads, salted and disembowelled.Bereft of their bodies, their heads were contorted as if they had been in terrible agony on the brink of death.The notices beneath their heads detail the additional punishments they received before they died, before they were executed.<Constitution of the Autonomous Region of Baskerville, Article 00, Section 0.

What did you do to beat them like this?\u201dHe sounded more than a little pleased with himself.Vikir, who had been standing beside him, expressionless, suddenly turned his head.\u201cDo you think what I did to these men was excessive?\u201d\u201cWhat? Oh, yes, of course I do! A fashionista deserves a good beating, and if you turn people into meat patties like this, how are you going to pay for it later\u2026\u2026\u201dVikir smiled wryly.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I haven\u2019t even started yet.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dChihuahua asks, confused.Vikir didn\u2019t answer, but thought about it.Township offices were originally meant to check and supervise local maladministration, edify local society, and coordinate relations with the city hall.But over time, they had become more and more like a red herring, and now they had surpassed even the power of the malevolent Baskervilles.\u201cGamani no dew!\u201d\u201cTwo, leave it!\u201d\u201cHuaangfei\u2019s bastardised family name!\u201dThe way they growled, it was even more so.But Vikir, soaking up their hatred, seemed unperturbed.\u201cI will execute them all at the end of the day.\u201d\u2026\u2026!At those words, the masters in the cage fell silent.Vikir spoke once more.\u201cWhile I\u2019m at it, I\u2019ll exterminate them all, from the babes in the club to the demons in the streets.\u201dThe fearsome words were unmistakably true.Everything would be done according to his word, 100% of the time.A war on crime had been declared.The masters looked dumbfounded for a moment, but now they grabbed the grate and began to shake it.\u201cNow, come on, good boy!\u201d\u201cHaberma! Haberma bazusae!\u201d\u201cGazing all over the place!\u201d\u201c\ubaa9\uc298\ub9dd \uc0ac\ub824\uc96c\uc0c8\u2026\u2026\u201dPeople who usually look at others like bugs crawl on the floor like bugs.At this moment, the Chihuahua was feeling complex emotions.He wondered if he would ever see anything like this in his life.On the other hand, he feared the retaliation of the local indigenous leaders.Their retaliation is both sleepy and deadly.From now on, no spawn would come to any of Vikir\u2019s businesses, and attendance at his events would be very low.The city would be at a disadvantage in trade with other cities, and tax revenues would dwindle.But Vikir was nonchalant.It was as if he had all his bases covered.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about, sir.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026ha, but.\u201d\u201cTheir families won\u2019t be able to protest.\u201d\u201cYes? Why?\u201dVikir answered the Chihuahua\u2019s question with uncharacteristic ease.\u201cThey\u2019re involved with criminal groups large and small in Underdog City.\u201d\u201cWhat? Zee, how does the Archon know that\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir remained silent, not wanting to say he\u2019d seen it before the regression.Then the Chihuahua looked concerned.\u201cBut it\u2019s the proof that counts, isn\u2019t it? And even if we do get proof, what kind of retaliation they\u2019ll do next.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, there are plenty of them.\u201dVikir laughed.We\u2019ll find the evidence. If we don\u2019t find it, we make it.And everything that happened next was beyond Vikir\u2019s concern.For Vikir was already thinking about moving on.\u2018I don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to replace me, but it\u2019s going to be tough.I don\u2019t expect Hugo to stay on as deputy for long.The world was about to change, and there was a good chance that he would be sent into actual combat in the near future.So it didn\u2019t matter much to Vikir\u2019s future if he threw a temper tantrum here and now.He would have to leave as soon as he was accepted into the Academy.\u201cSo, while you\u2019re here as a deputy, you might as well get some discipline.The answer was to prescribe medicines that were highly effective, even if they had some side effects.This would soon become a reputation that would propel Vikir\u2019s career.It didn\u2019t matter who came after him. Vikir hated members of his own Baskerville family the most.\u2026\u2026 But a thousand miles a day.To do that, I need to make these seven sixth formers\u2026\u2026 nay masters in front of me spit out all the evidence of their collaboration with the criminal element, and even their location.Vikir stepped up to the bars and said.\u201cI will tell you what you are accused of.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIllegal kidnapping and imprisonment of women, sexual assault, intimidation, forced administration of illegal drugs, human trafficking, and forcing them into the sex trade, as well as bribes, extortion, blackmail, and murder of government officials\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe masters were outraged.\u201cThat\u2019s the karma of the enemy! We\u2019ll punish you when we have proof!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll punish him when we have the evidence? Are you saying there\u2019s a crime but no evidence?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Gerson\u2026\u2026\u201dThe masters look at each other, puzzled.Then a determined look crosses their faces.\u201cIf I have to die here, I will do so without harming the family name.If we blow it here, we can\u2019t expect revenge.The clan would turn on them, and even if they did, Vikir, given the nature of that psycho, he might go further and use the sit-in system on the clan, tearing them down to the roots.\u2018Never, I\u2019ll never tell!\u2019The seven miscreants shut their mouths, ready to die for their family.\u2026\u2026 but.\u201cOh, now you\u2019re here.\u201dVikir waved towards an entrance in the dungeon corridor.Apparently, he had been standing in front of the grate all this time, waiting for someone.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dThe Seven Masters followed Vikir\u2019s gaze with curiosity and anxiety.And there, walking towards them, was a gaunt old man carrying a large basket.\u201cYour customisation is complete, my lord.\u201dThe old man was a torturer who worked in the basement of City Hall.And then.Vikir overturned the basket and spilled its contents onto the shelf.Clink-clink.What emerged were hundreds of knives.Each one grotesque and hideous, bent, twisted, distorted, blunt, and sharp.The old torturer grinned, showing his yellowed teeth.\u201cWow, I\u2019ve been torturing people for the past 30 years, and I\u2019ve never seen anything like this before. How did you come up with all these creepy devices?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t invent them. They were commonplace where I was.\u201d\u201cWas the place you were before \u2026\u2026 like hell?\u201d\u201cWell, it was close. You want to learn a lesson?\u201dThe instruments were gruesome, even for a torturer who had been doing it for thirty years.Vikir picked them up and walked back to the grate.\u201c\u2026\u2026gain!\u201dInstinctively sensing something, the Seven Masters crawled away from the grate.But just as quickly.\u2026Thud!Vikir brazenly pushed open the door to the cage and stepped inside.Before he regressed, he remembered the faces of his old comrades.\u2018I remember, even demonic prisoners spat out military secrets before their torture techniques.The tortures of the Age of Annihilation made even the demons from hell cry and shit themselves.Vikir, who knows all about the future torture techniques that have improved by leaps and bounds in the short time he\u2019s been dealing with demons, can\u2019t help but find the sandals with their determined expressions cute.\u201cYou\u2019re making faces like you\u2019re never going to blow.\u201dVikir says with a faint smile.\u201c\u2026\u2026Please don\u2019t blow.\u201dThis was genuine.He wanted to keep the memories and nostalgia alive for as long as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The outskirts of Underdog City.For some reason, luxury carriages have gathered in droves in a vacant lot at the back of the city where no one usually comes.Black tents cover the huge clearing.Masked aristocrats and wealthy men stalked into the barracks.Today is the day of the slave auction. Naturally, it is a slave auction that is not officially reported to Baskerville.As such, the slaves being sold here are undeclared goods.There were many people who could not be traded as slaves in the first place.Barbarians displaced from their homes, nobles from distant lands, or commoners kidnapped out of nowhere.They were chained, hawked, or drugged to the point where their will to escape or report was completely broken.Or they were commodities that would be.\u201cWelcome, welcome, welcome. Welcome to tonight\u2019s \u2018freak show\u2019, yes, yes, come, come, come.\u201dA clown dressed as Pierrot welcomes the audience.Next, a middle-aged man walks in front of the clown.The middle-aged man, who has a long goatee and a somewhat scruffy appearance, keeps looking around to see what\u2019s so unsettling.The clown checked the middle-aged man\u2019s credentials.\u201cHmmm hmmm. Mr Montblanc the Chihuahua. Ah, so you\u2019re from the Montblanc family, and your fabulous signature is a Montblanc trademark that no one else can copy. \u2026\u2026?\u201dThe clown grabbed a middle-aged man named Chihuahua Montblanc as he tried to let him pass.The Chihuahua is visibly flustered.The clown squinted at him and said.\u201cI see the purpose of your visit on your certificate says you\u2019re not here to buy slaves, but to sell\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cAh. That\u2019s right. I came to sell them.\u201d\u201cWhat about for sale?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got him tied up in the back there for a while, and I\u2019ve only got one anyway, and he\u2019s a young lad, so he doesn\u2019t take up much room.\u201dThe clown smirked and ducked his head again.\u201cI see,\u201d he said, \u201cthe Montblancs always buy slaves in bulk, and since you\u2019re here to sell this time, I was wondering if you didn\u2019t like the ones you bought last time and wanted to get rid of them.\u201dThe Chihuahua wiped the sweat from his brow with a handkerchief and shook his head.\u201cNo, sir. I\u2019m always satisfied with the quality of the slaves I buy here.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that right? That\u2019s right, we only sell carefully selected slaves. We kidnap barbarian women, commoners, and young noblemen from distant provinces who have lost their families and homes and have nowhere else to go, and we train them like rats and birds. They are obedient and never think of running away or rebelling, and we guarantee their quality.\u201dThe clown turned to the Chihuahua and bowed politely once more.\u201cI would like to extend a hearty welcome to the Freak Show.\u201d* * *There was a strange tension in the auction room.Under a haze of hookah and tobacco smoke, masked men and women sat in a circle around centre stage.Here were all the movers and shakers of the underdog underground economy.A lady in a butterfly mask salivates at the sight of a naked barbarian male slave on stage, while a gentleman in a bat mask salivates at the sight of a mercenary male slave on stage.There was no discernible public for the things that came up on stage at the auction house.There were objects \u2013 old urns, famous works of art, sharp swords \u2013 and there were rare animals and horses, and there were people branded as slaves.But for the wealthy people who gathered here, the distinction was a good one.They\u2019re used to seeing objects, animals, and people as the same thing.The masked dignitaries, their mouths covered by fans, were chatting amongst themselves.\u201cI hear it\u2019s all the rage in the Imperial capital these days to capture and display grotesque-looking slaves?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t pay much attention to fashions like that, I just think a slave should be pretty and handsome, that\u2019s all.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, slaves are supposed to be good at work or good at fighting, aren\u2019t they?\u201d\u201cHahaha, I\u2019m drawn to the tragic past that slaves have, which is why I prefer them to come from fallen nobility or kidnapped nobility.\u201d\u201cWell, whatever. I hope there are plenty of slaves available today.\u201dMost of the attention was on the slaves.The emcee, dressed as a clown, stepped onto the stage and shouted at the top of his lungs.\u201cYes! This sword and shield, surely a relic of an ancient civilisation, has gone for 30 million gold! Any more? All hail the snake-masked man over there who will take home this lucky piece of armour! Now, on to the next item for sale! Everyone, look at this beautiful jewelled crown! It must have been worn by a king of a defunct kingdom somewhere in the history books\u2026\u2026.\u201dThen.The eyes of the crowd, which had been focused on the slaves, suddenly snapped to attention.It wasn\u2019t a human being, but it was enough to focus all the attention in the room for a moment.A black buffalo covered in lean muscle.It has huge horns, a massive body, and three glaring eyes.<Infernal Buffalo \u2018Murcielago\u2019Danger Rating: ASize: 3 metresFound in: Red and Black Mountains, Ridge 2-A type of cattle that inhabits the Oil Realm in the depths of Hell.It is said to have nineteen hearts and will not stop charging until they are all stopped.It was a gigantic beast that inhabited the Enemy and Black Mountains.But the reason why no one runs away when this monster appears on stage is simple.This Murcielago was dead.The emcee shouted.\u201cNow, this sale is a stolen kill from the knights of the Baskervilles, a precious, Danger Rank A beast, with its hide, meat, bones, entrails, and everything else to spare!\u201dThere were nineteen wounds on the Hell Buffalo\u2019s body.Apparently, it had only died after its heart was destroyed.The price of this carcass immediately began to skyrocket.\u201cOne hundred million gold!\u201d\u201c120 million!\u201d\u201c140 million!\u201d\u201c190 million!\u201d\u201c200 million!\u201d\u201c250 million!\u201dThe entire auction house erupts in excitement, even though the human slaves are not.Having sold the carcass of a hell buffalo for a good price, the emcee took the opportunity to lead the auction in earnest.\u201cNow it\u2019s time for the auction for humans and their ilk!\u201dWith that, humans of all kinds began to walk onto the stage.A barbarian man with a dead look in his eyes as if he had given up on everything, a kidnapped noblewoman crying and begging to be sent home, a terrified commoner boy who still had no idea where he was, and a fallen noblewoman screaming that she would rather be killed.\u201cOne hundred million!\u201d\u201cTwo hundred million!\u201d\u201cTwo hundred and fifty thousand!\u201d\u201cTake it and seven thousand more!\u201d\u201cI got that bitch, no one can touch her!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous. Get more money.\u201dThe more they cry and scream and despair, the more the madness of the humans surrounding the stage intensifies.Just then.The emcee, buoyed by the brisk sales, suddenly looks puzzled.\u201c\u2026\u2026? Huh? Huh? You put this one up for sale, too? Huh? G, really? Oh, okay, I\u2019ll see if I can sell it.\u201dHe stutters, as if he\u2019s having trouble communicating with the men behind the scenes.He composes himself and continues.\u201cNow, this next one is a little different, a little more appealing, and still has plenty of room for improvement!\u201dIn other words, even the slave traders aren\u2019t quite in control yet.After the slave was painstakingly wrapped, the emcee dragged it to the centre of the stage.Unlike before, this time the slave was locked in a sturdy metal cage.\u201cKaaaah!\u201dA series of guttural screams erupted.Inside the cage, a barbarian girl with a stern face was rampaging madly.She must have been about 17 years old.She had black hair mixed with silver, triangular pointed ears, and a face that was a dark colour, but it looked like it had been smeared with ash and was normally a light brown.He wore a choker with thorns around his neck, and the animal skins he wore as clothing were little more than rags.Peeking through the rags, its body was toned and lean, but its face was unrecognisable through the ash, and it was snarling and snapping so fiercely that no one bothered to raise a bid.\u201c!\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05dc\u05da. \u05ea\u05e7\u05dc\u05dc \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05da. \u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d4\u05e8\u05d5\u05d2 \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05da\u201dA language I don\u2019t understand at all.Moreover, the stench of animal feces that had been wafting across the stage since earlier, and the body odour that seemed to have not been washed in decades, caused the noblewomen to turn away with frowns on their faces.\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah, who buys this?\u201dIt\u2019s enough to make even a clown talking to himself.Still, he had to sell, so he did his best to make a point.\u201cCome on, come on, slave traders say they\u2019ve picked this one up from the depths of the jungle! Come on, come on, don\u2019t you think a slave this fierce could use some taming? Use him as a night watchman or a gladiator! This is your chance to prove your slave taming skills! I\u2019ll start the bidding at 5 million! Let\u2019s go!\u201d\u2026\u2026.But no one raises their hand.Usually there\u2019s someone who calls out the lowest bid, for the sake of the moderator\u2019s dignity and the atmosphere of the auction house, but\u2026\u2026 this time there wasn\u2019t even that.\u201cEight, then let\u2019s lower the minimum bid a bit, 3 million, anyone got 3 million?\u201d\u2026\u2026.\u201cThen you don\u2019t have it either! Two million! I\u2019ll take it at two million! I\u2019ll say it again, you don\u2019t have it either!\u201d\u2026\u2026.\u201cOkay, okay, okay, one million! I\u2019ll take one million with my eyes closed! Take him and boil him for human consumption! I\u2019ll sell him for nothing more than meat!\u201d\u2026\u2026.But in the end, no one raised their hand.The moderator grunted and waved his hand.\u201cForget it. This isn\u2019t selling. I told you, only put up guaranteed items. Get them backstage, and use a windbag next time, I want.\u201dSoon the slavers were on stage, pulling down the cage that held the barbarian girl.The girl even managed to bite off the finger of the trader holding the cage, cutting it off.The atmosphere in the auction hall became chaotic.The organisers had to control it somehow.So what did they do?The emcee knew it was time to bring out the big guns.\u201cAttention, ladies and gentlemen, jumo~ok, keep your eyes peeled, because I have what I consider to be the best lot of the day right now!\u201dAnd then. A man stepped onto the stage.A boy with handcuffs on his wrists and heavy chains dangling from them.He looked to be about 15 years old.Despite the weight of the restraints, the boy\u2019s gait is effortless.There was a faint murmur of admiration from the audience at his confident and calm demeanour.As he stands at the centre of the stage, the torchlight from above illuminates his face.The boy\u2019s appearance was revealed in a glow of light.And the audience\u2019s jaws dropped in unison.\u201c\u2026\u2026Wow.\u201dThe expressions of all the noblewomen and some of the middle-aged men gathered here had become dazed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Vikir van Baskerville.He was on the stage.The emcee said.\u201cNow, what do you think, this is the last item up for auction, and with the quality of the goods, we can expect a great bidding war!\u201dAlas, there is still silence downstage.Even the barbarian girl in the cage, who had been rampaging on the far side of the stage after winning the auction, had become mesmerized and quiet since Bikir\u2019s appearance.Then.Someone raised a bidding sign.\u201cSix hundred million!\u201dThe lady in the butterfly mask gasps.\u201cSix hundred million, no, sixty-five million!\u201dThen the middle-aged man on the other side of the table jumps to his feet, as if he can\u2019t lose.\u201cEight hundred million!\u201d\u201cWhat the hell!

Numerical prices now began to jump by the billion.Just as the moderator was getting ecstatic, calculating the fees.\u201cSix billion.\u201dThe amount dropped like a bomb.Out of the corner of everyone\u2019s eye, I see a fat man munching on his food.\u201c\u2026\u2026, the author.\u201d\u201cBaron Gambino of the Granary, a rare find.\u201d\u201cCrazy, that\u2019s one big barrel.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard he\u2019s been raking in the dough lately, absorbing underground funds.\u201dThe people around you turn their heads with bitter expressions.Some of the noblewomen, gritting their teeth, tried to scrape together enough money to make a stand, but it was a long shot against Baron Gambino, who was now making a name for himself as the newest rebel in the underworld.Then.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Baron. Wouldn\u2019t that be too much to spend?\u201dThe secretary at Baron Gambino\u2019s side spoke up.Dressed in a greenish-blond short skirt and one-eyed glasses, she looked quite cold and domineering.Baron Gambino frowned slightly at the secretary\u2019s point, then coughed.\u201cWell, a slave that off-white can fetch a much higher price in the Imperial Capital. It\u2019s worth it to buy them and sell them later.\u201d\u201cEven though he\u2019s an off-white boy, six billion seems a bit excessive. Besides, isn\u2019t it the story of the baron who bought him and then left him to fend for himself that makes reselling him questionable?\u201d\u201cHmmm. Hmmm!\u201dBaron Gambino glanced up, seemingly conscious of the stares around him, and then burst out.\u201cShut up, you wench, I gave you something you had no right to have, and now you have the audacity to stand on your master\u2019s head!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI like her, I bought her with my own money\u2026\u2026!\u201dBaron Gambino shouted, and the secretary sighed and shook her head.Then.Baron Gambino, who had paid a hefty sum for the item, smirked and brought Vikir to him.He raised his thick hand and began to cupping Bikir\u2019s ass.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dBikir stared in disbelief, alternating between Baron Gambino and the hand cupping his ass.Baron Gambino chuckled in satisfaction at the look on Vikir\u2019s face, a look that said he\u2019d never seen anything like this before.\u201cWhy, it\u2019s new to you. Get used to it, for it will happen often from now on.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHehehe- don\u2019t worry. To be fair, I\u2019ll let you touch my ass too, later tonight\u2026\u2026.\u201dBaron Gambino said, scanning Bikir\u2019s body with a lecherous expression.The moment.Bikir raised his hands.Not realizing he was asking for his handcuffs to be removed, Baron Gambino smirked and reached for the keys.\u2026Snap, snap, snap!The handcuffs in front of you are ripped off in the blink of an eye.Steel cuffs tearing like paper. And the chains.With the force of his grip, Vikir shatters the restraints on his wrists.Then, at a loss for words, he held out his palms to the dazed Baron Gambino.\u201cOn your ass.\u201dThere was no time to protest, no time to say anything.Vikir rolled over the Gambino baron\u2019s fat body with such ease that he soon had his hands on his fleshy ass.Tsk, tsk, tsk!There was a terrifying sound, and Baron Gambino began to squeal like a pig.\u201cOff!\u201dA gurgling fountain of blood drenched the surroundings.A chorus of screams erupts from the bystanders as they see a man being torn alive.Soon, the mercenaries who had been acting as guards begin to rush over.But.Thud, thud, thud!The necks and torsos of the lunging guards separated at once and rolled separately across the floor.Before he knew it, Vikir had drawn a long, sharp blade that protruded from his wrist.Whirring, whirring, whirring.Beelzebub the Magic Sword began to weep as it drew blood.\u201cStrike, strike! Kill him!\u201dThe nobles called for their personal escorts.Swords drawn, mercenaries and knights charged, their auras rising.\u2026TsutsutsutsutsVikir unleashed his aura as well.The swordsmanship that followed was Baskerville\u2019s Fifth Form.Five of the lurking ambushers flew out at once, biting into the nape of their foes\u2019 necks.Thud, thud, thud, thud, thud.A shower of blood.Headless torsos crumble to their knees.Behind them, the knifemen, who had barely escaped death, could only stare in horror.An aura as red and sticky as blood. Gradient!The ultimate weapon representing a nation\u2019s national power, a killing machine for the sole purpose of killing.For every step Vikir took, he made sure to cut the throat of another.\u4e00\u6b65\u4e00\u6bba. Every step he takes, he kills.Bikir had only traveled a short distance, only a few dozen paces, but already a shower of blood was falling around him.There was only one thought on everyone\u2019s minds.\u201cWe don\u2019t stand a chance against the Graduates!As soon as the swordsmen saw Bikir\u2019s aura dripping like liquid, they gave up the fight and began to withdraw.But.\u201cYou fools, there\u2019s no business in Daguri, even if you\u2019re a grader!\u201d\u201cIf you run away now, you\u2019re all going to slavery!\u201d\u201cYay, so you\u2019re not going to make any money!\u201d\u201cThink of your families!\u201dHere and there, the shouts of nobles and signers turned a few swordsmen on their heels.By now, the chaos in the auction house had subsided somewhat.Heavily armed mercenaries, now numbering in the hundreds, surrounded Vikir.\u201cWhat the hell is that kid?\u201d\u201cHow is he a grader at his age?\u201d\u201cAre you human! What are you!\u201dEveryone is confused, but the enemy is clear.Countless swords, spears, arrows, and magic surrounded Vikir in layers.No matter how strong the Gradient was, there was no way it could survive this onslaught.Even.\u201cYou bastard, drop your sword and surrender this instant, or none of your men will live!\u201dThe clown on the stage was threatening Bikir with a hostage.The clown was holding a knife and about to stab him in the neck.The Chihuahua, with its long goatee, was shaking and looking at Bikir.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dBikir paused and stood.As he does, the mercenaries around him draw their swords and slowly close in on him.Just then.\u201cYour Excellency, I\u2019m fine, please take care of yourself!\u201dThe Chihuahua exclaimed with a determined look.Soon, he grabbed the clown\u2019s arm and began pulling him toward him.The clown was more surprised by the Chihuahua\u2019s behavior than by the fact that he was trying to kill himself by stabbing himself in the neck with someone else\u2019s knife.\u201cYou\u2019re crazy, what are you doing!\u201d\u201cLet go! There is no compromise with injustice in my dictionary! Besides, I\u2019d rather die than get in the way of my superiors!\u201d\u201cWhat kind of a line is that for a face like yours! Get off me!\u201dThe clown and the Chihuahua began to tussle, killing each other.Bikir smiled wryly at the sight.And then.\u2026Bam!With a drop of aura that pierced the clown\u2019s brow, Vikir picked up the falling Chihuahua and dropped all the way down to the stage.All around him, the air is alive with life.Countless mercenaries and knights of the local Sedoga armed with swords, spears, arrows, and magic glared at Vikir and the Chihuahua.\u201cZee, my lord. No matter how good a fighter you are, this number of people is a bit\u2026\u2026 overwhelming, especially with all the baggage I\u2019m carrying.\u201dChihuahua\u2019s concern was justified.But Bikir remained nonchalant.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. When we leave the Baskervilles\u2019 mansion.\u201dHe tore a small slit in the flesh of his thigh and pulled out what he had hidden within.It was a small whistle shaped like a red tooth.\u201cI have a hidden card from the Lord, \u2026\u2026.\u201dAnd then.Vikir brought the blood-red whistle to his mouth and blew.Beep-.A tearing sound echoed high in the air.Those gathered around were tense, unsure of what Vikir was doing, their eyes fixed on the center of the encirclement.But.The real action began on the ceiling of the barracks, where no one was looking.\u2026Tsk tsk!Shadows were tearing through the curtain that had been stretched out like the night sky and entering through the cracks.Countless black blood winds fell from the sky.And then.Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!Wherever they fell, there was always a shower of blood, and people\u2019s heads were torn off.\u201cAaahhh! What are these!\u201d\u201cThere must be over a hundred of them!\u201d\u201cAnd they\u2019re powered by graders!\u201dAll one hundred of them are Graduators. Killing machines, their blades coated in a blood-red aura.They annihilated everyone in front of them in an instant, then went behind Bikir and lined up politely.Only then did those who were spared by their position in the rear realize the nature of Vikir\u2019s group of one hundred Graders.\u201cSeriously, they can\u2019t be\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNo? No. Please, please!\u201d\u201cAh, yes, they\u2019re the only ones using that symbol!\u201dIt was the red, tooth-like badge on his chest patch.A \u2018knightage Pit Bull\u2019 of the Baskerville family.It was the rise of the most ferocious knighthood in not only House Baskerville, but the entire Empire.To these black-cloaked, silent fighting dogs, Vikir gave a brief order.\u201cBite him to death.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My son.\u2019The implications of giving up military power, however limited, were significant.He recognized Vikir as his son and would treat him accordingly.Thus, the Pitbull Knights, one of the pillars of Baskerville\u2019s military might, came under Vikir\u2019s control.For the next six hours, all one hundred of the Graduators, the iron-blooded knights who are known for leaving no survivors behind, will be Vikir\u2019s subjects.And now, Vikir was using them to sweep away the corruption of Underdog City in one fell swoop.\u201cHugo was particularly sensitive to the military. It\u2019s a good thing we got the pit bull back in one piece.Given Hugo\u2019s tendency to be extremely wary of local officials having private soldiers, it was expected that he would not give up his knighthood easily.But Hugo\u2019s trust in Vikir was surprisingly strong, and it made things easier.Vikir glanced at the group of Pit Bull Knights lined up behind him.A Zagoro fighter must never show his teeth.A third-rate fighter believes in his own strength and looks down on his enemies.A second-class fighting dog reacts too quickly to the enemy\u2019s actions.A first-class fighting dog has patience and composure, but not the life in his eyes.And finally, the pinnacle of the fighting dog is as calm as an inanimate object, not reacting at all, no matter how furious or threatening the enemy is.Woody Virtue (\u6728\u9dc4\u4e4b\u5fb7).It\u2019s as if they were carved out of a tree.In that sense, the Pit Bull Knights are a very disciplined group of fighters.They now stood behind Vikir like chunks of wood, waiting for orders.Vikir started the engine.\u201cBite them all to death.\u201dA hundred pit bulls bared their teeth.Vikir shouted at the running dogs.\u201cDon\u2019t kill the ones that stay down. But if they move, kill them without mercy.\u201dIt was a warning.Vikir\u2019s words were loud enough for his enemies to hear.Those who lost the will to fight quickly dropped their weapons, dropped to the ground, and raised their hands and feet upward.The majority, however, could not.\u201cAaaaah!\u201d\u201cAaaah help me!\u201dAs she screamed and writhed, her head was mercilessly sliced off.I could see her fat head rolling around under her fur coat, which was stained red.The fleeing middle-aged man is disemboweled on the spot.Men, women, and children alike were dying as they fled or screamed.\u2026\u2026That didn\u2019t mean that those who stayed down were unharmed.\u201cUgh, let\u2019s just get down. We\u2019ll jump out when it\u2019s a little quieter.\u201dSeveral people lay down on their stomachs on the floor and put their hands and feet up.It was a sign that they were waiting for handcuffs.But.\u201cWe don\u2019t carry handcuffs.\u201dA Pitbull Templar smirked as he stepped in front of them.Just as they were about to ask what they were going to use to bind their hands and feet.\u2026Thud! \u2026Thud!The Pitbull Templar\u2019s sword sliced through their limbs.Wrists and ankles snapped off.\u201cKaaaaaah!\u201d\u201cAaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!\u201dThey crawled across the floor, showing signs of escape, and then quickly dropped like bugs.The Pitbull Knights, of course, are completely unperturbed and launch themselves at the other moving prey.Meanwhile.Beside Vikir, a dark-haired, middle-aged man stands with a thick cigar in his mouth.He is an imposing man with an inverted triangle of muscle, a square jaw, sunken cheeks, sunglasses shading his eyes, and scars all over his face.Count Les Baskervilles, a Boston Terrier, asks Vikir.\u201cNephew, are you satisfied?\u201d\u201cYes uncle.\u201d\u201cHmph, boy. If there\u2019s anything else I can do for you, just say the word.\u201dHe was quite fond of his nephew, Vikir, for no particular reason, just because he liked the way the rice leaves fluttered.The Boston Terrier figured it couldn\u2019t hurt to have a nephew who was also the favorite of his master, Hugo.Vikir didn\u2019t feel bad for the Boston Terrier, who was not interested in power, honor, or political battles, but purely in blood and fight.Just then, the Chihuahua beside him spoke up in a shaky voice.\u201cYour Excellency. But would you mind if I cut off their wrists and ankles like that, even though they\u2019re nobles?\u201d\u201cWhat the hell, they\u2019re about to be executed anyway, and the handcuffs aren\u2019t worth the trouble, just make sure they can\u2019t get away.\u201dHearing Vikir\u2019s answer, the Boston Terrier Count laughed with even more satisfaction.\u201cHmph, nephew, you must join our Pit Bull Knights someday. This uncle will raise you properly.\u201dVikir could only reply with a faint smile.A minute or so later, the Pit Bull Knights stormed in and the situation was over.It was literally over.All the big bads in Underdog City were either dead or captured.Of course, there were some who were casually absent, but that could easily be traced back to their captors\u2019 ledgers and contact records.\u201cThis\u2026\u2026 is the greatest thing since sliced bread! It\u2019s so perfect!\u201dThe Chihuahua shivered with excitement as he watched the criminals being led away in the distance.The war on crime was suddenly declared, and it was over surprisingly quickly.Now we\u2019ll have to clean up the mess, but that will be a piece of cake.Even the indigenous families who lost their sons will not be able to say anything about it.The future of Underdog City was clear, transparent, and bright.\u201cCongratulations, no one will dare to speak against Vikir now, will they\u2026\u2026?\u201dThe Chihuahua jumped for joy.But Vikir, the one who should have heard it, was long gone.* * *\u201cI think it was around \u2026\u2026.Vikir had already returned to the back of the auction house.The slaughter was still going on in front of the stage across the way.By this time, Vikir had slipped through the back unnoticed and made it to the warehouse where the auction items were being stored.The warehouse was piled high with gold and silver treasures.All paid for in cash by nobles visiting the city.\u201c\u2026\u2026The tax revenue must be good.\u201dAll of this would be added to the city\u2019s treasury, and the Baskervilles\u2019 coffers would be even stronger.I didn\u2019t like the idea of Hugo being happy, but it didn\u2019t matter now, so I let it go.Vikir searched the warehouse for a while.Piles of notes and ledgers.He decided to keep all of them, as they would be valuable evidence in his future raids.But there was something else he was really after.Vikir grabbed a white cloth draped over a corner of the warehouse and pulled it open.And there it was.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dWhat Vikir saw was not what he was looking for, but something completely different.A cage, and a barbarian girl imprisoned in it.The same girl who had been rampaging ferociously just moments before, cowering in the corner of the cage.\u201c\u2026\u2026grunt, grunt.\u201dA barbarian girl making painful noises.Upon closer inspection, her entire body shows signs of abuse in addition to malnutrition. It looks like she was whipped outside the cage.\u201cShe must have been corporally punished after biting the traders\u2019 fingers earlier.Vikir clicked his tongue for a moment.Then he reached into his belt and pulled out a potion reserved for the Templars.He opened the door to the cell and sprinkled the potion over the girl\u2019s body.Qi Yi Profit\u2026\u2026With a loud crackling sound, the wounds healed and new flesh sprouted.The groaning girl opened her eyes to see Vikir inside the cage, and angrily hid in a corner.Vikir stared at the barbarian girl.A mixture of black and silver hair. Pointed ears. Charcoal-black makeup smeared across her face.The familiar teeth and claw marks on his forearms and thighs.\u201cCerberus?A memory comes flooding back.During his practical exam at the age of eight, Vikir had crossed the safety boundary and entered the waters of the Black Mountain with an enemy and encountered Cerberus, a Danger Class A+ demon.He remembered that Cerberus\u2019 flanks were covered with arrowhead-shaped scars.\u201cHmm. Could it be that the barbarian tribe that hunted Cerberus back then was\u2026\u2026?\u201dIt was a reasonable guess.Meanwhile, the barbarian girl, now that her wounds had healed somewhat, was crouched in the corner of the cage, glaring at Vikir.Vikir spoke briefly.\u201c\u05dc\u05da\u201dIt means \u2018go.The barbarian girl\u2019s eyes widened at the words.Vikir shrugged his shoulders once.\u2018I can speak basic barbarian.He had fought the enemy and the barbarians of the Black Mountains countless times before his return.\u201c\u05ea\u05d1\u05e8\u05d7\u201dThe barbarian girl\u2019s eyes widen in horror at Vikir\u2019s command to flee.Only when Vikir leaves the vial with the remaining potion on the ground and walks out of the cage does the barbarian girl cower and follow him out of the cage.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dShe glared at Vikir for a few seconds before ripping open the tent and fleeing.She took the vial of potion that Vikir had set on the ground.\u201c\u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 \u05ea\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 \u05e9\u05d5\u05d1\u201dThe barbarian girl said something at the last minute, but she spoke too fast for Vikir to understand.\u201cNow, let\u2019s find what you really want.\u201dVikir turned and went back to his work.Gold and silver treasures, notes and ledgers, checkbooks, antiques, art\u2026\u2026.But there was something else Vikir wanted.\u201cHere it is.\u201dWith that, Vikir pulled aside the red cloth draped over the innermost corner of the auction room.There lay a large, horned beast of burden.<Murcielago, the Infernal Buffalo>.Danger Rating: ASize: 3 metersFound in: Red and Black Mountains, Ridge 2-A type of cattle that inhabits the Oil Realm in the depths of Hell.It is said to have nineteen hearts and will not stop charging until they all stop.Bing-bing-bing.Beelzebub on the wrist was whining that he was hungry.In the distance, the sound of the Pitbull Knights\u2019 swords and the screams of their enemies were getting closer and closer.I had better finish my meal and get going.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Everyone is subject to the law.\u201dThe tone was nonchalant, but the impact was enormous.Public opinion of Bikir was either favorable or extremely favorable.The unfavorable were few and far between.Everyone in the city of Underdog, in groups of three or more, hailed Vikir as a great ruler.Of course, the native families who lost their pampered offspring would not stand idly by.The House of Montblanc, the House of Pierre, the House of Louis Vuitton, the House of Channel, the House of Ferragamo, the House of Herm\u00e8s, and the House of Prada each sent a letter of protest to the Court.But Bikir was adamant.\u201cNot only were they involved in all sorts of crimes, but they were directly involved in the most taboo of imperial crimes, the \u2018illegal slave trade\u2019. There can be no other consequence but death.\u201dThe imperial emperor treated the illegal slave trade as a felony of the highest quality.This was because most of the slaves traded illegally were barbarians from outside the Empire.Of course, this is not because the Emperor is concerned about the human rights of barbarians outside the Empire.He is wary of the phenomenon of privateering, where another war is fought to capture them.In order for local nobles to engage in privateering, they would have to recruit private soldiers, which could be done by treasonous conspiracy.There was a risk that a slave hunt, conducted secretly and out of sight of the imperial court, could turn into a rebellion or coup.Indeed, the fact that several large-scale rebellions of a few years earlier had their roots in troops organized for slave hunting was evidence of this.So the emperor nominally said\u201cIt is inevitable that war will create slaves, but it is not permissible to wage war to create slaves.From then on, illegal slave trade was treated with the same weight as treason, a first-degree felony in the Empire.Bikir cut to the chase.\u201cI have obtained all the notes issued by the seven executed prisoners, all the books they kept, all the cash they spent. These events are being duly investigated by the Baskervilles and will be reported to the Imperial Court.\u201dTo summarize: \u201cYes, if you refute, you are a traitor.After this conversation, the seven families stopped protesting.Now was not the time to sulk with Bikir over their anger and grief at the loss of their son.He couldn\u2019t afford to do that when his family was about to be disgraced.In the end, the heads of the seven haughty families came to the ruler\u2019s office in person, an unprecedented occurrence, kneeling and begging for forgiveness.They were forced to bow down to the man who killed their sons and beg for their family\u2019s survival.This is the price they pay for mis-educating their children.They crouched, foreheads on the marble floor, but\u2026\u2026 Bikir was relentless.\u201cI have already examined all the black ledgers in the Burning Suspension. Those guilty will be summoned soon and their treatment will be determined according to their crimes.\u201dThe results, if written down, would fill countless pages.But here are the key findings.Paragraph 1. All property of the Montblanc, Pierre, Louis Vuitton, Channel, Ferragamo, Hermes, and Prada families shall be confiscated and placed in the treasury.*Only those properties that have been earned through illegal activities should be confiscated, but at this point it is virtually impossible to distinguish between legal and illegal properties, so they are confiscated in full.Section 2. The House of Montblanc, the House of Pierre, the House of Louis Vuitton, the House of Channel, the House of Ferragamo, the House of Hermes, and the House of Prada shall be destroyed for treason.The reference point is the seven people executed on January 0.Section 3. The members of the House of Montblanc, the House of Pierre, the House of Louis Vuitton, the House of Channel, the House of Ferragamo, the House of Hermes, and the House of Prada who are involved in this case shall be punished by double the sentence under the special provisions of the Noblesse Oblige.Paragraphs 1 and 2 do not overlap.It can also be summarized in three short lines.-You.-That\u2019s it.-Fucked.The blood hasn\u2019t dried on the floor of the execution chamber in a while, thanks to the arrival of a new deputy magistrate.The foul blood of the vermin that had been feeding on the city.\u201cThe flower beds will be richer for it.\u201dVikir muttered to himself as he looked at the flowerbeds at the foot of the death chamber and the flowers that bloomed there.The white lilies that the Chihuahua had so carefully tended had turned into red lilies.\u2026\u2026Whatever.The ruling circles in the provincial capitol, who had been dictating policy decisions at every turn, dropped their heads in silence, and the provincial tribesmen, who had been farting around, now shuddered at the mere shadow of a government official.The seven indigenous families who might have been able to play a power game with Bikir were uprooted and effectively exterminated.Moreover, rumors that Vikir held some of the Baskervilles\u2019 military authority had gained traction in other cities.Who in the world wouldn\u2019t hold their breath in the presence of a Baskerville military commander?There were no longer any underdog cities that stood in Vikir\u2019s way.On the contrary, a new group of people was emerging to give him wings.\u201cIndeed, the viciousness of the Seven Native Houses has crossed the line.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re going to accuse the new Deputy of cruelty at the hands of the old, you might as well accuse me first.\u201d\u201cNew flesh does not come from begging and pleading. Rotten flesh must be cut out. You deserved it.\u201dOne after another, clean signers who had been penalized for their honesty, or nobles who had been dismissed for being too clean, or who had been forced to live in foster homes, declared their support for Bikir.They had no power or wealth, but they were honored and trusted by the common people, known as \u201cintellectuals,\u201d \u201cteachers,\u201d and \u201cmentors.Their support for Bikir\u2019s bold reforms grew as more and more Confucian intellectuals followed suit.As a watershed moment, Bikir reinterpreted all past precedents and freed all wrongfully convicted prisoners and prisoners of conscience.As a result of this process, the massive manpower required to uncover the truth of the past led to a massive hiring spree of additional government employees and contractors, which significantly reduced the unemployment rate in the underdog city.The shortfall in the payroll budget was covered by the tax revenues generated by the crackdown on the illegal underground economy.This has prompted the citizens of Underdog City to organize daily mass protests in front of the city hall.<Deputy Mayor Bikir to stay in office permanently!<We strongly urge! Deputy Vikir to stay in the city of Underdog forever!<I love you, Bikir>.It was a protest for the love of it.* * *Mr. Chihuahua\u2019s secretary is single-minded.The distrust and disdain that had greeted Bikir\u2019s arrival had been washed away.\u201cAre you at work, sir? Here\u2019s your coffee.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re the head of the office, mind your own business. You don\u2019t need to bring me coffee.\u201d\u201cThis is a personal thank you. Didn\u2019t you save me from being stabbed by a clown the other day?\u201d\u201cThen a cup of coffee is too salty for a lifesaver.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not too salty, it\u2019s two primes of sugar and ten thousand of water.\u201dThe two have gotten to know each other well enough that they now joke around like this.Bikir is currently teaching the Chihuahua how to write.More precisely, how to mimic different typefaces.With that handwriting, Bikir is creating new laws and updating old ones.Vikir was making new laws and updating old ones: developing the ruby mines with Morg, stabilizing the price of agricultural products, rewarding those who did good work for the fief, giving slaves immunity from taxes when they did good work, developing backward areas equally, institutionally guaranteeing the benefits of following laws with penalties for breaking them, taxing merchants outside the fief, raising taxes on the wealthy, lowering taxes on the poor, dispelling superstitions, nationalizing land, and more\u2026\u2026.Of the laws that would be enacted in the future, Bikir cherry-picked the ones that had worked well and refined them to fit the current social climate.Naturally, the legislators were impressed with Bikir\u2019s knowledge of the law, and scratched their heads even more.The city of Underdog was going from strength to strength.\u201c\u2026\u2026are you really 15 years old?\u201dBikir chewed on the Chihuahua\u2019s question in awe.With that, Bikir began the most important task of the day.\u201cSecretary.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe Chihuahua trotted over and stood beside him.Bikir continued in his nonchalant tone.\u201cIs there any Tio left in the dungeon right now?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Unusually, all of them without a single call.The prisoners have all been executed, pardoned, or transferred, and the area is now completely empty.Vikir made his way to one of the deepest cells.The darkest and most fetid.Solitary.The most secluded of the dungeons, with the only securely locked door.And in this dungeon was the only prisoner left.He was a secretary to Baron Gambino, a major player in the underground economy.A woman with greenish-blond hair cut short, dressed in a prisoner\u2019s uniform and wearing heavy handcuffs, she squatted in the corner of the cell.Vikir pulled up a chair and sat down in front of the bars.Druk-.The sound of the iron chair legs scraping against the stone floor echoed loudly in the empty prison.\u201cYour name is\u2026\u2026 Sen Rose Sindhiwendi. Is that right?\u201dVikir asked, but she didn\u2019t answer.Instead, she stared down at the floor with vacant eyes.\u201cWhy did you keep me alive?\u201dXindiwendi\u2019s question was hollow.The freak show. And the Pit Bull Knights.That night, when everything that moved was dying, Cindy Wendy gritted her teeth and fled.She could never die like this.Even if she didn\u2019t die, her wrists and ankles would be cut off.She had a job to do, and she could never die in a place like this and be a wastrel because of it.Who among the dying was not, or at least Xindiwendi thought she was, far more desperate and needy than the others.But the teeth of the fighting dog before her were cold.One of the Pit Bull Templars stepped in front of her, and it was a death sentence.She gritted her teeth as the jagged blade sank into her throat.But.\u2026Earth!The sound the knife made as it plunged into his throat was a bit unexpected.That\u2019s because the Pitbull Templar\u2019s blade didn\u2019t manage to pierce her throat.Vikir. The new deputy magistrate.He holds up a bundle of chains to block the Pit Bull Templar\u2019s blade.The Pitbull Templar looked very surprised that Vikir had managed to block his blade, but his next words were brief.\u201cThis woman is an exception. Capture her alive without hurting a single finger.\u2019This is how Xin Diwendi has been imprisoned in the dungeon ever since.Vikir stared at her in silence for a while.Finally, he asked.\u201cIf you answer my questions truthfully, I will release you from here.\u201d\u2026\u2026!That made Xin Diwendi\u2019s ears perk up.But soon, Xin Diwendi shook her head and muttered to herself.\u201cI\u2019ve already lost the will to escape from the time I was imprisoned here, and I have no reason to do so now.\u201dLike it or not, Vikir\u2019s questions had already begun.\u201cAre you the reason Baron Gambino, who was nothing more than an insignificant sodomite, has been able to increase his power so dramatically in recent years?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve researched you, and you have a knack for making money, and if that talent had blossomed in a place other than the underworld, you would have made a fine merchant or financier.\u201dXin Diwendi laughed bloodily.It was a mocking laugh that seemed to say, \u201cWhat good is all that now?Vikir looked into her eyes and held them still.Then he spoke in a pleasant voice.\u201cI assure you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cAnswer my question and I\u2019ll let you out of here, but-\u201dVikir trailed off and tilted his head toward the bars, locking eyes with Xindiwendi.Searing red light pierced her green retinas.\u201cIf you do not answer, you will regret this day.\u201dThere was a strange, unknown power in the voice that made the listener feel another kind of intimidation besides fear.Xin Diwendi opened her mouth to speak, not even knowing what she was feeling.\u201cIf it\u2019s something I can answer, I\u2019ll answer it.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dVikir asked, bluntly.\u201cHow does it look to you?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cDo you think I\u2019m doing law enforcement wrong?\u201dXin Diwendi replied in a nonchalant tone.\u201cWho cares about the opinion of a lowly criminal bitch like me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m asking an insignificant criminal bitch like you.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and say it: I think you\u2019re doing it wrong.\u201dAt that, Vikir nodded.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cVirtue is the key virtue of a ruler in all theories of monarchy. A strong rule of law may work to some extent in the beginning, but in the long run, well\u2026\u201d\u201cVirtue, what is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not getting in a cart when you\u2019re tired, not putting a cover on a cart when you\u2019re hot, and not having armed soldiers in procession. It is his virtue that when a ruler dies, all the citizens shed tears, even the children refrain from singing, and even the triggers do not hum.\u201d\u201cIs it a great blemish that I am not virtuous?\u201d\u201cIf it is a great blemish, it is a great blemish, for you will not live long because of it. You may have established your majesty by beating up on cheap scoundrels with the Thrash Furun Law, but in the long run, you will kill and injure many commoners, which will build up resentment and anger.\u201d\u201cDo you think I should fear the resentment and anger of the common people?\u201d\u201cThe commoners won\u2019t like it, but neither will the Baskervilles, and although it\u2019s an underdog city, the citizens will be more afraid of you, the deputy, than they are of the Baskervilles.\u201d\u201cHmm. That\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cThe same will be true when your superior arrives, or when your successor does, and the reason you changed the law is to assert your authority and hasten your accomplishments, which will have many native factions gnashing their teeth. There are plenty of underworlders in other cities, too, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have long to live, considering their sentiments.\u201d\u201cSo what do you think I should do?\u201d\u201cYou are as precarious as dew right now. If you wish to live to see another day, you must resign as Deputy Magistrate, return all your powers to House Baskerville, return the balls here to the Gazoo and the Imperial House, and go to a place befitting your age, such as Yazi in the Red and Black Mountains, or an academy in the center of the empire, and look forward to the future.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cKeep yourself as unnoticed as possible, conceal your strength and cultivate your learning, and suggest to your superiors that you seek out and promote undiscovered talent, honor the elderly, care for orphans, praise the unmerited, and honor the virtuous.\u201d\u201cAnd what will I gain by doing so?\u201d\u201cYour mind will be at ease, for one thing, and by that time the patriarch of House Baskerville will have taken all the blame you deserve; and even if he takes away your immediate credit, you are only fifteen years old anyway. Isn\u2019t that old enough to have a reputation that has spread to the ecliptic, even if it\u2019s only a sham?\u201dAt Xin Di Wendi\u2019s long-winded advice, Vikir smiled a rare smile.Her advice was very much in line with Vikir\u2019s own plans for the future.\u201cGood.\u201dVikir nodded.At the same time.\u2026Clang!The iron gate swung open.Vikir ripped the padlock off with the force of his grip, then removed all of Xindiwendi\u2019s restraints.\u201cAs promised, you are now free.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dXin Di Wendi raised her head and stared at the iron gate in front of her.Then she turned to look at Vikir.\u201cAre you really releasing me?\u201d\u201cI am. I keep my word.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll regret it, won\u2019t you?\u201dA hint of life returned to Xin Diwendi\u2019s eyes.Seeing it, Vikir smiled wryly.\u201cI hope so.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dSindhiwendi tilted her head.Finally, Vikir spoke up.\u201cYou said something nice to me, so I\u2019ll say something nice to you.\u201dSindhiwendi turns to leave the cell, but stops short.With her back to him, Vikir spoke.\u201cThere were seven famous native families in Underdog City. The Montblancs, the Pierres, the Louisvilles, the Channels, the Ferragamos, the Herm\u00e8ses, and the Pradas.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut a few years ago, their number was eight, not seven.\u201dAt that, Vikir didn\u2019t miss the slight shiver that ran down Xin Diwendi\u2019s spine.\u201cOriginally, there was an eighth family called the Messinadna family, the wealthiest of the merchant families.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut they were destroyed overnight, all of their members tragically killed. Do you know why?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThey had stolen the Baskervilles\u2019 sword book, and their eight-year-old son had one day claimed to have learned to be a good swordsman.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe patriarch of the Messinadnaro family threw a big party for his son\u2019s birthday and asked him to demonstrate his newfound sword skills.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026that.\u201dXindiwendi held up a hand to interrupt Vikir.But Vikir was undaunted, and continued.\u201cWith everyone gathered, my son demonstrated his swordsmanship, but everyone there was in for a big surprise, for what he demonstrated was the Baskerville style of swordsmanship, which is only shared in secret among the Baskervilles.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026that, stop.\u201d\u201cThe Baskervilles are terribly protective of their family\u2019s swordsmanship. Believing that a top-secret military secret had been revealed, the Baskerville patriarch unleashed the hounds, and from that day forward, House Messinadnaro would disappear from the face of the earth.\u201d\u201cStop it, you bastard!\u201dXindiwendi shouted sharply.But Vikir didn\u2019t stop.\u201cBut as it turns out, House Messinadnaro was not guilty. It was the children of the other seven houses who lured their son with the promise of a good sword book, and they lured a young boy from Baskerville to take it from them and teach it to the child of House Messinadnaro, and the child demonstrated it in front of a group of adults to prove that it was good. It was by design.\u201d\u201cBut there was one survivor of the Messinadnaro family, all of whom were said to have been wiped out, a little girl of one year old Turl, and the Seven Wretches managed to sneak her out of that massacre.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ewww. Ewww!\u201dXin Di Wendi staggered, then leaned back against the wall.Her eyes were red and bloodshot.Vikir finished.\u201cThat girl had to be subjected to all sorts of cruel, low, and shameful tortures just because she was bright and fair, and the details of those tortures\u2026\u2026 I can\u2019t even begin to tell you.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear any more. Goodbye.\u201dA bloody tear trickled from one of Xin Diwendi\u2019s eyes.She took her back away from the wall and staggered toward the outside.Then.\u201cI told you, if you don\u2019t listen, you\u2019ll regret this day for the rest of your life.\u201dVikir stood in place, unmoving, and continued.\u201cThere\u2019s a sequel to this story.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dXin Di Wendi stopped in her tracks.Vikir shrugged once.\u201cAnd quite a bit of time has passed, and a new deputy magistrate has come to the city.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHe brought out all the old enemies within the city and punished them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAnd the trigger for the event was the seven rascals who drove House Messinadnaro to ruin.\u201dCindywendy turned her head to look at Vikir.Vikir looked him straight in the eye and spoke.\u201cThe new deputy tortured those seven brats to death.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt was such horrible torture that a torturer who had been working at the castle for thirty years vomited up what he had just eaten.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAnd as they lay dying, the seven wretches confessed all the sins they had committed, including those against House Messinadnaro. They admitted and apologized for all their sins.\u201dThen Xindiwendi cried out sharply.\u201cApologize! How dare they apologize to anyone!\u201d\u201cTo \u2026\u2026the sole survivor of House Messinadnaro. To that girl. To the girl who currently goes by the pseudonym \u2018Sen Rose Cindywendy\u2019 and whose real name is \u2018Messinadnaro Sen Cindywendy\u2019.\u201dHearing this, Cindy Wendy staggered back with a dazed look on her face.\u201cEw!\u201dShe vomited out the contents of her stomach.Her vision spun.The darkness of the dungeon was pitch black.The rotten stench that had been hovering in the cell from earlier seemed to be getting stronger and stronger.Xin Diwendi braced herself against the wall with one hand and held her forehead with the other.She spat on the floor and asked.\u201cHow can I believe your words?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHow am I supposed to believe you when you say you caught them, tortured them, got to the bottom of it, and got an apology!\u201dSindhiwendi screamed.There was no answer from Vikir.Only.\u2026snarl!Vikir drew fire from the rod in his hand and lit a torch.Suddenly, the dungeon cell was brightly lit.And then.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dXin Diwendi\u2019s eyes widened to tears.Seven headless corpses were kneeling in the corner of the room.Their fingers were all worn out, and the blood that flowed from them had stained the floor, walls, and even the ceiling.The entire room was stained red with blood.Upon closer inspection, the red color of the floor, ceiling, and walls had been covered over and over again with countless letters.-Please forgive me for my mistake, I deserve to die, I beg you not to touch me as much as my family\u2026\u2026-Meshinadnaro, we are the ones who destroyed the gate, please forgive us for our sins\u2026\u2026-Sincerely apologize to ThindiwendiWe are the ones who have sinned against leather\u2026\u2026-Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong\u2026\u2026-Save me, save me, save me, save me, save me\u2026\u2026-I don\u2019t want to dieI don\u2019t want to die\u2026\u2026-I\u2019m scaredI\u2019m scaredI\u2019m scared\u2026\u2026Corpses that smell rotten.And apologies scrawled across the floor, all ten fingers worn down from when they were alive.The blood that made up the apology stained the entire room red.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dXin Diwendi stood in the center of the red room, looking at Vikir with a puzzled expression.Then Vikir walked in front of her.\u201cBut the vengeance of House Messinadnaro is far from over.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cFor there is still one family left.\u201dVikir\u2019s meaning was clear.That meant their greatest enemy, House Baskerville, remained.Vikir said.\u201cBlame the Baskervilles. You deserve it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAnd apart from that, I speak for all Baskervilles.\u201dVikir\u2019s back bent slowly in front of Cindywendy.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dAnd at the same time.Dip-dip-dip-dip-dip.Tears began to fall from Xindiwendi\u2019s eyes and land on the stone floor.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe two stared at each other for a while, unmoving.Then Cindy Wendy spoke.\u201cSince you are also a Baskerville,\u2026\u2026 why are you helping me?\u201dVikir made no reply.And the sharp-eyed Sindhiwendi understood the meaning of his silence.The dislike and hatred of Baskerville is within and without, but it is the same.In that way, Vikir and Cindywendy understood each other well.And then.Sindhiwendi walked out of the prison.She turned to Vikir, who was still inside, and said in a voice that was uncharacteristically calm.\u201cNo matter what you do in life, I\u2019ll make sure you never run out of money.\u201dVikir had a new sponsor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sun is already up, it\u2019s time for you to go to work\u2026\u2026uhhhhhhhh!?\u201dAfter knocking on the door, the Chihuahua didn\u2019t get to finish his morning greeting before letting out a grotesque scream.There was blood everywhere.Blood, blood, blood, soaking down the white bedspread and staining the marble tiles on the floor in a grid-like pattern.The walls, the ceiling, the bed, all drenched in blood.\u201cAh. Good morning, sir.\u201dVikir gets up from the bed with too much nonchalance.Judging by his sleepy expression, he really was asleep just a moment ago.And on the bed beneath him lies a corpse, head and torso separated.A dagger is clutched in the hand of a black-cloaked man, clearly an assassin.Vikir looked at the assassin\u2019s body on the floor.\u201cHmm?

It\u2019s a lighthearted joke.\u201dVikir tried to make a joke of his own, thinking, \u201cWouldn\u2019t a 15-year-old be this playful?\u201d but the Chihuahua didn\u2019t seem to realize it was a joke in the first place.\u201cSo, Your Excellency\u2026\u2026, what kind of childhood did you have back home?\u201d\u201cWas it not much fun?\u201d\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t a matter of fun\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Chihuahua seemed in many ways at a loss for words.Vikir shook his head in disbelief.\u201cI\u2019ve been getting a lot of these flies lately.\u201dTwo poisoned arrows, four poisoned glasses, six street burying attacks, stabbings, sulfuric acid spraying, sniping, arson, carriage ramming, etc\u2026\u2026..All in the last three days.This was the first assassin to enter his bedroom, but even he was no match for Vikir.Every warrior who had lived through the Age of Destruction had mastered the art of sensing the killing around them in their sleep, and Vikir was no different.\u201cHmph. I guess I should look on the bright side. It means I\u2019m getting noticed, right?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve, man.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re disrespectful to your superiors, sir.\u201dI retorted nonchalantly and turned to put on my robe.The Chihuahua stuck out its tongue as Vikir nonchalantly followed her out of the bedroom.\u201cLooking at you, it\u2019s hard to believe you\u2019re really 15 years old.\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s the blood in that?\u201d\u201cEven if it is Baskerville blood\u2026\u2026 I mean, weren\u2019t the rest of the Baskervilles like this in the first place, and the previous Archon was\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Chihuahua continued to babble, but Vikir was already tuning out his words.Instead, his mind was on the payoff from his last illegal auction house heist.<Binge Fly \u2018Beelzebub\u2019> / Awl-1 slot: Burn \u2013 Cerberus (A+)-2 slot: Choke \u2013 Infernal Buffalo (A)Slot -3: Bleed \u2013 Hellhound (B+)Magic Sword Beelzebub.This strange blade, which drains and absorbs the abilities of those it kills, was sealed with the power of Murcielago the Infernal Buffalo, a beast you met at the auction house some time ago.The troll\u2019s C+-ranked danger ability, Super Rapid Regeneration, was gone, replaced by the infernal buffalo\u2019s Tight Throat Breath.While \u201cSuper Fast Regeneration\u201d is an ability to quickly heal an injured body, \u201cTough Breath\u201d is much more versatile, as it makes the body so tough and hard that it cannot be injured in the first place.In the first place, the Infernal Buffalo was a high-level beast that couldn\u2019t even be compared to a troll, so it was no wonder its effects were superior.\u2018I didn\u2019t know there was a Class A demonic corpse in the auction house, I\u2019m lucky.\u2019After consuming it, he was able to easily defeat the assassin who came yesterday.The assassin who had infiltrated the palace last night was a Gradual.Even though he was only a low ranked Gradual, I remembered that he produced an aura that was as sticky as liquid.It was an unexpected attack, and the dagger slightly pierced my chest.But thanks to a synergistic combination of the protection of the River Styx and the hardiness of the Infernal Buffalo, Vikir\u2019s body was left with only a faint scar.The assassin himself would not have known.\u201cMu, whose body is so hard\u2026\u2026!?Little did he know that this would be his last words.\u201cI\u2019m going to find out who\u2019s behind these assassins and put them out of business.\u201d\u201cThat makes sense.\u201dIn fact, though he hadn\u2019t told the Chihuahua, Vikir was thinking of resigning from his position as deputy magistrate after this job was done.Just like Xindiwendi had told him not long ago.Just then.Something happened to help Vikir\u2019s plans.The call came from Baskerville itself.A huge black carriage stood in front of the city hall.A luxury carriage emblazoned with the Baskervilles\u2019 toothy logo.Visiting the town hall early in the morning was a man Vicky knew well.Deacon John Barrymore, who had come to see Vikir personally.\u201cMaster. Long time no see.\u201d\u201cI see, Deacon. You look better.\u201dDeacon Barrymore beamed at Vikir\u2019s response.\u201cLook at that. Didn\u2019t I tell you when you left the main house that you would do well?\u201dThe rumors of the outside world had reached the main house.They were all about the underdog city\u2019s new deputy magistrate.\u201cLucky in many ways. The timing was right.\u201dBut the rumor-monger himself remains uncharacteristically modest.Deacon Barrymore then revealed the reason for his visit.\u201cMy lord is looking for you. Presumably, he wants an accurate report on this incident.\u201d\u201cIf it was a report, I would have already submitted it in writing.\u201d\u201cHaha, is that the same as having your son come and tell you in person?\u201dAfter speaking, Barrymore stroked his mustache and narrowed his eyes.\u201cYou\u2019re so excited. I\u2019ve never seen you smile like that before.\u201d* * *Hugo Les Baskervilles.He was still sitting at his patriarch\u2019s desk, his face expressionless.But Vikir could sense an alien aura emanating from him.It was.\u201c\u2026\u2026Well done, son.\u201dIt was uncharacteristically warm.Hugo set today\u2019s morning paper down on his desk.<Underdog City\u2019s citizens\u2019 favorite person is Vikir, number one>.<Vikir, the #1 most trusted person by merchants in Underdog City>.<Vikir is the #1 favorite of the peasants of Underdog City.<Vikir is the #1 person that children in Underdog City admire the most>.<Vikir is the #1 favorite of intellectuals in the underdog city>.<Underdog City\u2019s assassins most want to kill, Vikir> ...The results of the popularity poll of the citizens were on the front page of the newspaper.\u201cYou\u2019ve done a great job.\u201d\u201cYou did what you had to do.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of dumbasses out there who can\u2019t do what they\u2019re supposed to do.\u201dHugo looked at Vikir, a faint smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.\u201cIllegal slave trading is a felony punishable by death for both buyer and seller. Your actions have been commended by the Imperial Court.\u201d\u201cI am honored.\u201d\u201cThis is your chance to dispel the myth that Baskervilles are only good with a sword and bad with their heads. You\u2019ve done a great job.\u201dVikir\u2019s special law, his performance in proclaiming it, and his vigorous enforcement of the law set a precedent for all the cities under the Baskervilles\u2019 control, and even the imperial family.Hugo\u2019s unorthodox appointment was rewarded by Vikir\u2019s unorthodox performance.One of the Baskervilles\u2019 customs is to be sure of reward and punishment.If you do well, you get rewarded; if you don\u2019t, you get punished.Vikir had done an outstanding job and should be rewarded accordingly.And today, Hugo had summoned Vikir to the main house to discuss the reward.\u201cAdmission to the Academy.\u201dThe Colosseo, the Imperial Academy, the place where every elite in the world dreamed of entering.Hearing that, Vikir asked.\u201cIsn\u2019t it customary to enter the academy at the age of 20?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re good enough, there\u2019s no age limit. You can be an early adopter or a late adopter, as long as you fulfill the following conditions: no more than 25 years old when you enter and no more than 30 years old when you graduate.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I will live up to your expectations.\u201dVikir interjected with a short testimonial.Hmm?Hugo, who normally would have ended the conversation at this point, showed a rare willingness to continue.\u201cI\u2019m sending a few people, including you, to the Academy, but I haven\u2019t gotten around to organizing the entries yet.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cDo you have any close brothers who would like to go with you?\u201dThe question was completely unexpected. Didn\u2019t it sound like something a father would ask his son?\u201cUh-oh. You\u2019re a father.But then Vikir remembered something he had forgotten himself.He is Hugo\u2019s son, after all.He hadn\u2019t been treated like a son for so long that he had forgotten.Vikir hesitated a moment, then spoke.\u201cI\u2019m best friends with the triplets, Highbrow, Middlebrow, and Lowbrow.\u201dWhat\u2019s the big deal about being best friends, if you want them around, you\u2019re best friends.\u201c\u2026\u2026Is that so?\u201dHugo\u2019s eyes widened a little in surprise, but then he nodded in understanding.\u201cI\u2019ll keep it in mind.\u201dThat was the end of the conversation about the academy.Vikir had just finished his chaplaincy and was about to leave.\u201cOh, by the way. Son, stay a minute.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dVikir stopped in his tracks and turned around, and Hugo rose briefly from his seat.Then he spoke in a low voice.\u201cI\u2019ve been looking over the laws of your underdog city.\u201d\u201cThey are \u2026\u2026 immature.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve made quite a few changes to the agricultural laws. You\u2019ve done a very efficient job.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s very flattering.\u201dVikir had once reorganized the laws governing the large farms on the outskirts of Underdog City, in the area where the Red and Black Mountains met in the lower reaches and wide open plains.In addition to the ruby mines, there are many fields of sugar cane, tobacco, cotton, and other crops.They were mainly worked by savage captives.Is that why? The savages who occasionally raided across the border often targeted farms on the outskirts of Underdog City.Hugo said.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a quick tour of the estate before you enter the Academy? See if the laws you\u2019ve established are being followed. It would be good experience.\u201d\u201cAs you wish.\u201dVikir obeyed, still unwilling to argue.Then.Hugo, who had been watching the scene with satisfaction, suddenly asked.\u201cBy the way, are you going alone?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dVikir scratched his head.So he\u2019s going to go on a territorial tour by himself?When Vikir looked at Hugo with a puzzled expression, he settled back into his chair and spoke in a relaxed voice.\u201cThis is a joint operation.\u201dAt Hugo\u2019s words, Vikir remained silent. It was an indication that he needed a little more explanation.Understanding that, Hugo got down to business.\u201cDo you remember the operation you organized when you were eight years old? Why, the ruby mine.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Of course. I seem to recall that it involved leasing the Ruby Mines area to the Morg and driving the barbarians towards it, keeping the two factions apart untouched.\u201dAka the carnage map.The idea was that if they wanted to expand their borders, they\u2019d have to deal with the barbarians anyway, so they might as well use the Morg to get rid of them.Hugo\u2019s mouth curled into a wry smile.\u201cThe plan worked.\u201d\u201cAnd by worked, you mean\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cThe Morg made the first offer. Very low-key.\u201dHugo hadn\u2019t looked this happy in a long time.He turned to Vikir.\u201cThey\u2019re talking about a joint war of attrition.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He\u2019s also insisted that I do the same.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cTo never let the Wolfhound Knights take him away from me, never!\u201dStaffordshire chuckled as he finished.Vikir nodded in agreement.They led the servants, supplies, and other entourage that followed them to the Red Awl Mountain on the outskirts of the estate.As the name suggests, a red mountain juts out steeply from the ground.At its base was a wide, flat basin that accentuated the mountain\u2019s pointedness.Here, near the trunk of the great tributary to the Red and Black Mountains, the river is rich in sediment and the land is fertile, and farming is quite profitable.Crops of sugar cane, cotton, and tobacco were growing, and these were the main products of Baskerville\u2019s estate.And as you make your way across this vast expanse of farmland, you\u2019ll see strata lined with reddish veins ahead.Here and there in the seismically fractured sections of the strata is a glint of red light: the ruby veins.There, men from the Morg family were digging for rubies.Simple forts of wood and stone rose high above the ground.From now on, the Baskervilles would have to be vigilant, as the Morg had leased the area to them.Vikir\u2019s sharp eyes scanned the farmland to the rear and the mining fields to the front.He didn\u2019t see anything illegal going on.Just the usual scene of slaves tending and harvesting crops, or digging with pickaxes.The Morgas hadn\u2019t violated any treaties, either, perhaps because of the Baskervilles\u2019 emissaries.Staffordshire explained to Vikir in a low voice.\u201cThis mission is nominally an inspection of our lands and goodwill, but\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI know. That it is an outpost for the extermination of the barbarians behind the mountains.\u201dOtherwise, there would be no reason for Baskerville\u2019s knights to be following so closely behind.The Baskervilles had entered Morg\u2019s territory, disguised as a routine manor inspection party.The Morgans, of course, were aware of this.For some time now, Morg\u2019s armed forces have also been gathering here, disguised as miners.Now Morg and Baskerville will join forces to crush the barbarians.The barbarians, unaware that a large force of swordsmen and wizards from both houses has gathered here, will rush in as usual, plundering crops and slaves, and that will be the beginning of the end.Staffordshire said.\u201cI hear that there are one deputy and twelve senators from the Light Party in Morgga, and one deputy and nineteen senators from the Dark Party, and it seems that there are other wizards who are not senators.\u201d\u201cThe Morgas have put their money where their mouth is.\u201dWhile the Morgas have made this much of a commitment, the Baskervilles have, at best, brought a few dozen lay knights, with Vikir, a member of the House of Representatives.It didn\u2019t matter, though, because the real elite of the Baskervilles were lying in ambush on the other side of the mountains, and that had also been agreed upon with Morgue.Vikir was really here to inspect the estate and socialize.\u2018Well, if Hugo\u2019s right, it would be nice to be able to examine the ecology of the barbarians.Soon, the Baskervilles began to traverse the mining district.Everywhere they looked, they saw coal mines, and they saw palisades, stockades, and watchtowers rising high above them.Just then.\u201cHmm?\u201dVikir slowed his horse as he spotted something.His nose caught the scent of burning.The smell of meat roasted to the limit and then charred to blackness.As if on cue, the horses are frightened and hesitate.Ahead of me, I see something perpendicular to the ground.It was long and pointed, sprouting vertically from the ground and reaching for the sky.And in the middle of it was something.Vikir kicked his hesitant horse in the back and pushed forward.The identity of the strange sculptures was now clear.It was a giant skewer of iron.Only one being could have created such a thing, an iron skewer forged from the trace elements of iron contained in the soil.\u201cA mage.\u201dIt\u2019s not surprising to see something like this in the grounds of the Morg family, who are known for their mage sect.However, the things pierced by the skewers and nailed to the ground are quite alien.Skulls. And charred flesh.The bodies impaled on the skewers had all been burned to death.The bodies were mixed and matched, demonic and human alike, and some of them had been burned to the bone, leaving nothing but empty skewers.Whirling.With each gust of wind, the skewered corpses crumble into black powder.\u2026Gross!A lump of charcoal, unknown to the barbarians or the demons, falls from the skewer and scatters ash on the ground.\u201cYou\u2019ve been warned.\u201dStaffordshire said, looking up at all the things that had been impaled on the skewer and burned to death.This must be a warning to the demons and barbarians of Morgoth.And Vikir already knew of one person who did this.\u2018\u2026\u2026You must have grown up, then.Vikir was reminiscing in his mind.\u201cWho\u2019s there!\u201d\u201cStand down!\u201d\u201cIdentify yourself!\u201dAnkaljin shouts came from the watchtower up ahead.Vikir looks up and sees three women descending from the top of the watchtower.Elderly women, treading on thin air as if it were a staircase.Fiery red hair, dresses out of place in a murderous fortress.Viktor already knew their identities from his knowledge before the regression.\u201cHighsis, Middlesis, and Lowsis, triplets of Morgoth.Sixteen wives of the year.Each a master of water, grass, and earth magic, and the synergy of the three of them together?Born on the same day and at the same hour, they were called the Three Flowers of Morgoth.However, the world called them something different.Samhwa (\u4e09\u798d).It means \u201cthree plagues.Each one of them was said to have an insane personality, and together, they were said to be unstoppable.They were notorious in Baskerville for their pride and arrogance.It\u2019s no wonder they\u2019re the ones who ruin the friendly competition every year.To top it all off, they have strong magical skills that make up for their nasty personalities.And here they were, the three sisters of Morgoth, guarding the gateway fortress to Morgoth territory.Vikir stepped forward and spoke.\u201cWe are emissaries of House Baskerville.\u201dHeisis, at the head of the line, smirks.\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cSo, we\u2019re here to inspect the estate and exchange goodwill. Open the gates of the fortress.\u201d\u201cNot now. I\u2019ve sent a report to those in charge, so wait.\u201dThe horse said wait, not wait and see.Vikir asked.\u201cHow long do we have to wait?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe tomorrow? Ho-ho-ho-\u201dIt was more than a plea, it was an argument.Vikir\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201cIn what name are you preventing Baskerville from entering Baskerville\u2019s land? You are arrogant for a tenant.\u201d\u201cWhat? You call me a tenant? Don\u2019t you know the Tenant Protection Act? That\u2019s a law of your own making? Don\u2019t you even know your own family\u2019s laws?\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the law, I\u2019ve already changed it. I\u2019ve already amended it to allow me to evict true tenants.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir urged his horse forward a little more while Hyssis was speechless.\u201cI am the deputy magistrate of the city of Underdog. I am here by appointment, and this is the last time I will speak to you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cOpen the door.\u201dHearing Vikir\u2019s words, the three Morg sisters exchanged glances for a moment.Then the eldest, Hyssis, smirked.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that there\u2019s a younger one in the city of Underdog.\u201d\u201cOh, but what are we going to do about it?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s a young rascal, we\u2019ve had enough of them!\u201dThe three sisters drew mana into their palms.And then.\u2026Quack, quack, quack!Water, grass, and earth magic unfolded, and Baskerville crashed down in front of them.Vikir frowned slightly and reared his horse back.The three sisters\u2019 laughter rang out from beyond the billowing mushroom cloud.\u201cGiggle, giggle-we\u2019ll wait for you, you ignorant swordsmen!\u201d\u201cNot even Baskerville dares to enter Morg\u2019s land!\u201d\u201cShall these sisters see what a supernova a Baskerville is?\u201dThen Staffordshire came to Vikir\u2019s side and said.\u201cI don\u2019t think we should tell them.\u201dVikir was thinking the same thing.Just then.\u201cHow dare you bitches who don\u2019t even know the subject speak in front of anyone!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a fool!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a fool!\u201dThree shouts erupted from the Baskervilles\u2019 emissary.Soon, three familiar faces emerged from the dirt.Highbrow, Middlebrow, and Lowbrow.The Baskervilles\u2019 triplets, who had been at the back of the delegation, stepped forward.They stood side by side, now friendly again, and glared at the three Morg sisters as they descended.They snorted.\u201cDon\u2019t you know the subject?\u201d\u201cSo you guys are higher up than us?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201dBut the three brothers denied their words.\u201cNot us.\u201d\u201cNot us.\u201d\u201cNot us.\u201d\u201cThen who?\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cWho?\u201dThe three siblings turned their heads in unison at the question.\u201cThis is our Baskerville street sign!\u201dThe direction the three brothers stare in awe and fear.That\u2019s where Vikir was standing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He has to pull his weight.\u201d\u201cProtect.\u201d\u201cProtect.\u201dLowbro even turned his head and winked at Vikir.Vikir was even more bewildered.\u201cI just got my finger chopped off, and this is what he\u2019s going to do?But this wasn\u2019t the first time Vikir had encountered this behavior from the triplets.\u201cCertainly, they\u2019ve been noticeably more civilized since the last time they hunted a troll in front of everyone.Maybe even before that. Maybe since he\u2019d killed a Cerberus in his first practical assessment at the age of eight?I knew something was off when I walked up to Vikir while he was scarfing down a haggis and pretended to be friendly.Vikir had spent his entire life avoiding the attention of his siblings.They were too weak and young to be worthy of his attention.But this indifference must have caused a mutation in the triplets\u2019 minds.After all, it was in the Baskervilles\u2019 nature to follow the philosophy of the strongest.What\u2019s more, they seemed to be under a strange illusion.\u201cLeave this place to us, Vikir. We\u2019ll repay you for recommending us to the Academy.\u201d\u201cLeave it to us, Vikir. We\u2019ll repay you.\u201d\u201cLeave it to us, Vikir. We\u2019ll make it up to you.\u201dThe triplets speak with determination.Vikir suddenly remembered his conversation with Hugo not long ago.He had mentioned the triplets without thinking when asked who he was close to, and it had apparently impressed them.Vikir decided to keep his mouth shut.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt\u2019s always cute to see a kid who thinks he\u2019s doing something great.(Plus, these triplets have a fucked-up personality, so that\u2019s one cute thing about them.)Vikir thought for a moment.\u201cThey could be useful.These triplets will surely grow up to be very useful killing machines.They might not have the brains to make their own decisions, but they certainly knew how to do what they were told.They\u2019ve been used for all sorts of sneaky and dirty jobs, so they\u2019ve proven to be both skilled and loyal.Hounds, literally. Fiercely obedient to their master\u2019s command.And that was something Vikir knew all too well, having been bitten by their teeth.Finally, Vikir gritted his teeth in defeat.\u201cI\u2019ll give you a chance, brothers.\u201dThe triplets\u2019 faces lit up.They stood in front of Vikir, looking even more pleased than when they\u2019d received Hugo\u2019s praise at the end-of-the-month review.\u201cWell, if they\u2019re going to go to all that trouble, why shouldn\u2019t I?Vikir decided to stay in the background for now.Next.The three sisters of Morg and the three brothers of Baskerville were about to face off.The three sisters of Morg and the three brothers of Baskerville had already met at several annual events, and they had a reputation for getting along very badly.The three sisters struck first.\u201cWhat a bunch of idiots, all you know how to do is stick together in threes.\u201dLausis was the first to bring her hands to the ground.With her powerful Water Realm magic, she formed countless water droplets and began to shoot them out.Puff-puff-puff!The force of the water droplets flying at high speed was powerful.It was said that falling water could take a long time to pierce through rocks, but the mana-laden droplets she was sending out could pierce through rocks in an instant.The ground is devastated.The droplets of water that Lowsis unleashed pierced countless holes in the ground, drenching the earth with moisture.Middlesea followed suit.She specializes in powerful earth magic, and with a sweep of her hands, she gathers the loose soil together.Crunch, crunch, crunch.At Middlesea\u2019s command, the waterlogged and deformable soil formed an earth wall that surrounded the three sisters.What\u2019s more, sharp rocks protruded from its surface like blades, allowing for both defense and offense.Finally, the eldest sister, Hyssis, stepped forward.Specializing in powerful grass magic, she flicked her hands together and pulled the grass seeds from beneath the ground.Thick plant stalks sprouted and vines grew, feeding on the waters of Lowthis and the soil of Middlethis.Land, water, and plant life worked in synergy to make Morg\u2019s fortifications stronger and stronger, while at the same time putting pressure on their enemies.Indeed, these are the qualities that have earned it the name \u201cThe Three Flowers of Morg.But Baskerville\u2019s three brothers were no slouches either.\u201cHeh, heh, heh, heh, what are we going to do with all that grass and no meat?\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201dHive was the first to jump up.A pale aura of gaseous form drew out a single sharp tooth and slammed it into the dirt wall in front of him.Then.\u2026Pow! Pow!The earthen wall cracked open, revealing the inside.It was only one circle of magic, so its defense was obviously limited.The blades of Middle Bro and Low Bro followed suit, slashing down.The high-speed rotating auras vaporized the flying water droplets and shredded the plant stalks.Clang! Clang! Pow!Sword and magic clashed ferociously.The magic was drawing in more mana, recreating the power of the elements more strongly, and the sword was exploding with firewood from the mana and life force in his body.Which is stronger, magic or sword?It was an ever-present debate between the neighboring realms of Morg and Baskerville.And at the forefront of that debate today stood these three sisters and three brothers.Each of the six was fighting to prove their family\u2019s banner.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dWatching on, Vikir was bored to tears.After all, what tension could there be in a battle between three first-class mages who could only use first-circle magic and three lowly Sword Expert juniors who had just mastered the first form of Baskerville?What\u2019s more, Vikir is a cripple from across the river, with no real attachment or brotherhood to the Baskervilles.\u201cI wish they\u2019d all just die.It\u2019s an extremely cynical attitude.But the other knights of Baskerville, with the exception of Vikir, had a different attitude.They all seemed to be quite excited, even if they didn\u2019t say so.Staffordshire turned to Vikir, who had a sullen expression on his face.\u201cAren\u2019t you having fun?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it a competition of talent and potential among young dreamers who will one day carry the family name in tow?\u201d\u201cIf you put it that way, I\u2019m a dreamer.\u201d\u201cMaster, you\u2019re already\u2026\u2026 and you\u2019re not fit to play in that age group.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a waste of time. I must pass quickly, I have a meeting with the head of the fort to discuss\u2026\u2026.\u201dBut Vikir couldn\u2019t finish his sentence.Quack, quack, quack!A powerful explosion ripped through the area.\u201cKaaaah!\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dThe three sisters of the Morg family and the three brothers of the Baskerville family were all stunned.Flames roared, consuming everything around them.Skewers of steel rose from the ground, turning the area into a field of thorns.Puff, puff, puff!The skewered wall of earth collapses in an instant.The searing heat burned away the water and vegetation before Baskerville pushed back the triplets\u2019 blades and sent them flying.A line of fire and iron, red and black, separates the Morgans from the Baskervilles in an instant.The magic was so powerful that even the other Baskervilles, who had been watching the children\u2019s fight with amusement, half-sheathed their swords in surprise.Crackle, crackle, crackle, crackle!In the blink of an eye, the surrounding cotton fields turned into an inferno.The Baskerville triplets barely made it beyond the wall of fire.But their hair was already charred to a crisp.\u201cHey, what the hell, you almost burned me!\u201d\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201dThe triplets jerked their heads up to protest Morg\u2019s overreach.But Morg\u2019s three sisters on the other side of the room were treated even worse.Not only are they scorched by the flames, but they\u2019ve been skewered, scratched and torn all over.Crawling on the floor, Highsis, Middlesis, and Lowsis had dark horror in their eyes.\u201cHmph, hmph\u2026\u2026 I almost died just now\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf you had dodged a little later, you would have died, hmph-\u201d\u201cSisters- I\u2019m scared-\u201dSeeing them stutter, the Baskerville triplets quickly shut their mouths to protest.Morg was unrelenting, even against his own family.All heads turned toward the direction the fire magic had come from.Then, from beyond the barrier of fire, came a calm voice.\u201c\u2026\u2026 What is this?\u201dA cold voice, but somehow familiar.And with it, an enforcer of iron skewers and hot flames.The distant nickname that would later come to be known as Jian Tian Muhu.Morg\u2019s mistress, who would come to be known as the Queen of Fire and Skewers, or the Queen of Red and Black.\u2018\u2026\u2026 But she is still young.Vikir looked up.An eight-year-old girl in a blur of memories.And now, a fully grown fifteen-year-old girl.Morg Camus.She looked down at him, reunited after seven years.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She stood in an arrogant pose, looking down.Her three sisters, sprawled out on the floor, tremble at the sight of her.\u201cOh, it\u2019s a camel, sisters\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOoohhh, they\u2019re just trying to ward off intruders\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThey started the fight!\u201dHighsis, Middlesis, and Lowsis are a year older than Camu.But they were crushed by the overwhelming force of Camu\u2019s strength, unable to catch their breath.It was an unusual sight for the Morg, a martial arts family where the hierarchy between siblings is strictly based on age and achievement.And then. Camu smiled seductively.\u201cCamu, are you talking to me, sisters?\u201d\u201cHic! Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!\u201d\u201cGet out of the way. If you don\u2019t want to be like that.\u201dThe camel stretches out a finger in annoyance.There, impaled on iron skewers, burned corpses lined the border.It became clear who had created this murderous landscape.\u201cGah!\u201dThe three sisters fled, shaken by the words of their one-year-old brother.An eerie silence falls over the battlefield as they disappear.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dEven the Baskervilles\u2019 triplets, who had just bared their teeth, cowered before the camel.Then the camo reined in his horse and rode toward the Baskervilles.She stopped exactly in front of Vikir, locked eyes with him, and opened her mouth.\u201cWelcome, partner.\u201dShe was referring, of course, to the joint operation against the demons and barbarians that was about to unfold.* * *After seven years, Morg\u2019s straight face had changed quite a bit.The freckles on his face are gone, and his wisdom teeth are gone.Her cheeks were still plump from lack of milk, but she was already showing signs of what she would grow into and how beautiful she would be.Vikir recalled her appearance from a distance a few times before her regression.\u201cShe must have been about thirty, and she was pretty.\u2018Dazzling\u2019 could not have been a more apt description of her beauty, a beauty that even Vikir, who had never cared much for a woman\u2019s appearance, admired.With all the love letters and marriage proposals coming in from Camu, Morgha would have enough firewood for the winter.And the Camoos themselves enjoyed the situation.She had all the ladies by the skirts and was involved in scandals here and there.It was a strategic move, of course.While she despised the men who clung to her beauty, she played with their minds, fomenting rivalries and conflicts between the houses, and absorbing all the byproducts into the Morg\u2019s service.In a highly political move, she refused to give her heart or body to any man until the end, which made all men crave her love all the more.She ruled over countless captive men.She greatly multiplied Morg and revolutionized the war against the demons.\u2026\u2026 but.This was before the regression.In this life, the Camouflage is somehow less scandalous.She is surprisingly quiet, considering that by the time she turned 15, she was already managing fisheries for the imperial family, as well as the other powerful men of the other six families.Rumor has it that she is not seeing a single man, despite her age.\u201cI don\u2019t understand.Vikir reined in his horse with a bit of puzzlement.Beside him, Camus reined in his horse, following closely behind.\u201cSo this is not how things are in Baskerville, \u2026\u2026. The damage done by the barbarian tribes is\u2026\u2026 so we\u2019ve sorted them out, and in Morg, we\u2019ve decided to forge an alliance with Baskerville against them\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe rambled on and on.Vikir didn\u2019t say much, other than a few dry chuckles.Camu turned to Vikir and asked.\u201cApparently, the Baskervilles don\u2019t know much about the enemy and the barbarians of the Black Mountains, do they?\u201d\u201cOf course not. They fight them all the time, and they should know better than you.\u201d\u201cThen why did you send only your own men, all of whom are young and raggedy hounds?\u201dCamouflage had finally realized the quality of Baskerville\u2019s envoys.Vikir was about to reply that they were Moors, but then he shut his mouth.It had already been agreed with Morg that Baskerville\u2019s true \u2018home\u2019 lurked in the mountains on the other side.\u201cWhat do you ask when you know?\u201dThe camo chuckled.\u201cI was just wondering if you knew about it.\u201d\u201cOf course I know, it\u2019s a family affair, and I\u2019m in charge of the mission here.\u201d\u201cIt could have been a scarecrow used as a discard pawn within the House, but I get it now.\u201dCamu urged his horse forward, toward Vikir.He looked back at Vikir and smiled.\u201cThat you are quite trusted within the clan.\u201dThe camo continued with his questions.\u201cDo you know which of the barbarian tribes is the most troublesome?\u201dOf course I don\u2019t. It was one of Vikir\u2019s primary duties to search out and destroy the enemy and the Black Mountains before returning home.\u201cFrom Morg\u2019s perspective, it would be the Balak, a warrior tribe, and the Rokoko, a shaman tribe.\u201dThe Balak are the most common warrior tribe in the Borderlands, and while their numbers are small, each member of the tribe is a powerful warrior, making them a headache for Baskerville.\u201cTheir archery is far more powerful than that of the Empire, and its principles are not well understood.\u201d\u201cHmm. That\u2019s right, they\u2019re a mysterious people.\u201dCamu nodded, then looked back at Vikir, his eyes shining.\u201cYou\u2019re very knowledgeable about the ecology of savage tribes. Eight points.\u201d\u201cHuh.\u201d\u201cOn a scale of one hundred, you\u2019re flunking.\u201dCamu stuck out his tongue, and Vikir frowned slightly.\u201cI answered well, so why is your score like that?\u201d\u201cBecause you answered well.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dWhen Vikir still looked puzzled, the camel grinned, a wry smile curving the corners of his mouth.\u201cWhat\u2019s a man to do with being smart?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like smart men, Zagoro males are supposed to be dumb.\u201dApparently, the mindset that had gripped and shaken so many men before the regression wasn\u2019t going anywhere.Vikir spurred his horse faster, as if he didn\u2019t deserve an answer.But the camouflage followed him, giving him a long list of ratings.\u201cHorsemanship, six. Maybe it\u2019s because you\u2019re shorter than me, but you\u2019re riding a horse that\u2019s too big for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cFashion 4. Your clothes are too drab.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo answer? 1 point for manners.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWell, your face is a 99. You\u2019ve grown up nicely. But I\u2019m deducting one point for not managing your facial expressions.\u201dMy ears began to burn from listening.Vikir cut him off.\u201cStop giving me stupid grades.\u201d\u201cWhy is it useless?\u201d\u201cAnd where is it useful?\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s for our future, isn\u2019t it?\u201dOur future?At Vikir\u2019s incredulous look, Camu shrugged and puffed out his chest.\u201cYou\u2019re my future husband, so I\u2019m going to weigh in.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf I\u2019m flirting with you, then you should evaluate me too, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019d rather be judged, because I need to know what you think of me.\u201dVikir asked in disbelief.\u201cWhy do you think I\u2019m your husband?\u201d\u201cWhy? You passed your uncle\u2019s test the other day.\u201dAs Vikir thought about what he was saying, he remembered a time when he had competed against Morg\u2019s deputy, Adolf.At the time, Adolf the Mad had a jar of water on his head, and Viktor had broken his sword at the end of the duel and used the shards to break the jar, passing Adolf\u2019s test.\u2018\u2026\u2026 But that was already seven years ago.\u2019But now he was saying it as if it had happened yesterday.Camu shuddered and said\u201cHow could my uncle judge my husbandliness by such a crude test! He made that promise in front of everyone, and now I\u2019m a married woman, but what can I do? A promise is a solemn law! I have to obey it, even if I don\u2019t want to. I\u2019ll obey it, I\u2019ll obey it, I\u2019ll obey it\u2026\u2026!\u201dNo one said anything, but he was burning hot.Vikir watched and thought.\u201cWhat an accomplished fire mage.If he had mastered fire magic to the extreme, would he be able to spontaneously combust like that?Vikir was mildly curious.Anyway, that\u2019s that and this is this.It would do no good to go against the wishes of the woman who was to become the head of Morg\u2019s household, so Vikir was considerate of Camu.\u201cForget what happened that day. I\u2019ll pretend it never happened.\u201dFor a moment, the camel stiffened.Vikir watched and thought.\u201cA paralyzing spell? That\u2019s amazing for a moment. But why did he cast it on himself?Sometimes wizards could do things you couldn\u2019t understand.I didn\u2019t really care, but diplomacy dictates that I should at least ask what\u2019s going on.Vikir had just opened his mouth to say.\u201cHey, how do you make something that wasn\u2019t there, make something that was!\u201dCamu suddenly screeched.For the first time since his regression, Vikir panicked.He had just opened his mouth to say something.\u201cI know because I\u2019m a genius and I never forget what I\u2019ve seen!\u201dWith the camo\u2019s shout, something flew into Vikir\u2019s face.A shredded piece of cloth. It was a blood-red robe, the size of an eight-year-old\u2019s.Boldly emblazoned with the Baskervilles\u2019 sigil, it was the cloak Vikir had once used to cover the naked camo.Seven years old, the cloak still smelled faintly of that day\u2019s sweat.Holding it in his hand, Vikir scowled at the camel as it moved away.\u201c\u2026\u2026 You\u2019re giving it away without washing it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They\u2019re taking the slaves not to save their own people, but to sell them as slaves elsewhere.\u201d\u201cExactly. There are many barbarian tribes, and they do not consider each other kin, so they would not hesitate to sell criminals of their own tribe or captives of other tribes into slavery.\u201d\u201cI see, and I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to answer the stupid question of why barbarians fight amongst themselves.\u201dCamu reached out and gestured to the mud wall in front of them.\u201cThese walls were built by Earth and Iron mages for a month.\u201dThe size of the wall was enormous.If ordinary people had built it, it would have taken a year, not a month.It would have taken hundreds of men to build it.Vikir moved closer to the earthen wall.Then he saw something strange.There was a grid of steel beams embedded in the hardened earth wall, but they were only visible to Vikir because of the holes in the wall.The earthen wall was pockmarked with holes that looked like the surface of a biscuit.Hundreds of them.Vikir studied the size of the holes.They looked to be about three centimeters in diameter.\u201c\u2026\u2026The marks of the Balak.\u201dVikir\u2019s sharp eyes were identifying the enemy, the famous barbarian tribe beyond the Black Mountains.Camu nodded.\u201cThe Balak are the most troublesome. Their arrows carry a powerful aura, and many a man has been killed by them while standing guard at night. They can punch through an earthen wall two or three meters thick, so do you have what it takes to defeat them?\u201d\u201cEven shield magic won\u2019t stop it. They fly so fast.\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s why my uncle almost got himself in trouble once, not long ago.\u201dThe camel smirked.Not long ago, he said, he\u2019d been sniped at while searching for Mad King Adolf himself.\u201cI think the arrow pierced his shield, and it freaked him out. He was lucky to escape with his life, but his pride must have been bruised.\u201d\u201cCome to think of it, my lord,\u201d said Vikir, \u201cyou had a similar experience, and I heard that you had a scar on the bridge of your nose.\u201dVikir remembered the scar on the bridge of Hugo\u2019s nose.Wounding Swordmaster Hugo and Class 6 Master Adolf, Balak\u2019s archery was indeed something to be wary of.\u201cIt seems the barbarians have some talent. Who is it?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s a woman, but she\u2019s too far away to make out her identity, and they wear black paint on their faces, so it\u2019s hard to memorize.\u201dCamu threw up his hands in annoyance.\u201cAnyway. The Balak are the most threatening, even though they only number about three hundred, and the next most threatening, the Rococo, are ten times less numerous.\u201dA warlike tribe, the Balak.They are a nomadic, plundering, warlike barbarian people who belong neither here nor there.They have been on the move for unknown reasons in the last seven years, and have come into increasing conflict with Baskerville.The Morg, who have recently leased some of Baskerville\u2019s territory to develop ruby mines, are equally annoyed with Balak.Camu looked out over the water on the distant horizon and spoke.\u201cThe Morg have their fingers crossed, but\u2026\u2026 barbarian raids are so stealthy that it\u2019s hard to detect them. Besides, we have a gap in our vigilance about once a month.\u201d\u201cGaps?\u201dVikir asked, and Camu arched an eyebrow.\u201cThe Morg are a matriarchal society, so women are overwhelmingly in charge. Even the wizards who stand guard are women.\u201d\u201cBut what does that have to do with the gap?\u201d\u201cWell, about once a month, \u2026\u2026. Because there\u2019s magic.\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019re mages, aren\u2019t you?\u201dVikir asked, and the camo opened his mouth for a moment, then chuckled.\u201cYou\u2019ve got a bit of a stupid side to you, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cOkay. I like it. Bonus points for being a man\u2019s man.\u201dIt took Vikir a few slaps on the shoulder before he understood what the camo meant.Just then.\u201cBooyo!\u201dIn the distance, someone was looking for the camo.A female wizard rushed to the cage and bowed before him.\u201cThe hermitage\u2019s search party has captured a barbarian scout alive!\u201dA prisoner had been taken.* * *The one being dragged away in ropes was a man with brown skin and black hair.From the tattoos on his body, Vikir could guess his tribe.\u201cYou\u2019re from the shaman tribe, Rokoko.I don\u2019t know how he ended up here, but his fate is already sealed.Morg Camu.She faced her captive with a fearsome aura.\u201cDid you get any information?\u201dThe mages beside her cringed.\u201cWe\u2019re not talking, for now.\u201d\u201cWhat about mind magic?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work. The powerful spell makes it impossible to read their memories.\u201dThe camouflage turned away.He walked over and stood in front of his captive.\u201cYou raided Morg\u2019s fortress once before and took some slaves.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAmong those slaves was a Morg woman. She is my half-sister. Her name is Rose.\u201dCamu glared at Rococo\u2019s captive with searing eyes.\u201cWhat did you do with her?\u201dThe captive\u2019s tightly closed mouth slowly opened.\u201c\u05dc\u05d4\u05e8\u05d5\u05d2.\u201dAt the word, the camo raised an eyebrow.\u201cInterpretation. Where is the barbarian returnee?\u201dBut no one answered him.They just glanced at each other uneasily.One wizard spoke up apologetically.\u201cThey were all killed or taken away when the barbarians attacked, Vice-Captain.\u201d\u201cThen there is no one to translate his words?\u201d\u201cFor the moment, no.\u201dIt was an awkward moment.Everyone had a puzzled look on their faces.\u201cI speak a little Rococo.\u201dVikir stepped forward.Camu stared at him, wide-eyed.\u201cYou can do that, too? What are you not good at?\u201d\u201cNot very well. I just know the basic vocabulary.\u201dVikir stood in front of Camu.Camu asked.\u201cAsk him where my half-brother is. The girl you kidnapped in the last raid. She has red hair, red eyes, and unusually white skin. She\u2019s about 12 years old.\u201dVikir nodded, then turned to Rococo\u2019s captive in front of him.\u201c\u05de\u05d4 \u05e2\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea \u05e2\u05dd \u05d4\u05d7\u05d8\u05d5\u05e4\u05d4\u201dA short reply came back.\u201c\u05d0\u05db\u05dc\u201dVikir\u2019s expression hardened for a moment.Then he turned to the camel and shook his head.\u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201dAt that, the faces of all the Morg turned grim.He had expected death when he was kidnapped, but hearing it was a different story.Then, Camu stepped forward.She growled in a low voice at her captive.\u201cWhen this war is over, your language will be the language of hell.\u201dThose were the last words the prisoner heard.Camu said.\u201cThe delegate from the Light Party is being treated now. The Delegate of the Dark Party is now inspecting the opposite estate, and I, Morg Camu, a member of the Council and Deputy Fortressmaster, will make the judgment here.\u201dThat was the end of the summary trial.And now.With a flick of his hand, Camu drew a circle of magic in the air.Then.\u2026Poof!A large iron skewer sprouted from the ground.The iron elements hidden among the earth elements came together and exploded, and the skewer that formed impaled Rococo\u2019s prisoner in one fell swoop.From groin to crown.The prisoner struggled, unable to even scream.He was nailed high up in the air, impaled on a metal skewer.Flames began to crackle beneath him.Crackle!The skewer burns. In the blink of an eye, the camouflage had burned Rococo\u2019s captive to death.All the slaves who saw it looked at it in fear.It was the same with the people of Morgue.Purr, purr, purr, purr, purr!The sound of someone being skewered and burned to a crisp.Black powder scattered in the wind along with the smell of burning meat.In front of that terrifying fire, the camel smiled nonchalantly.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dShe grabbed Vikir from beside her and they were out of there in no time.Everyone around them could only stare after them with a faint sense of dread.* * *Meanwhile.Back behind the earthen wall, Vikir was a little surprised.Not that he was surprised to see a man skewered alive and burning.Vikir had spent decades rolling on the battlefields before his return, and had seen much worse.It was the expression on the camo\u2019s face that startled Vikir.\u201c\u2026\u2026Blah, blah, blah!\u201dThe camel had gone to a place where no one was around, and now it was crying.His face contorted, his eyes red, tears streaming down his chubby cheeks.Vikir\u2019s mouth was half open in disbelief.Oh, my God, to see the weather goddess crying.Of course, she had seen it when she was eight years old, but it felt very different now that she was 15.\u2018But I\u2019m still 15,\u2019 I thought.After staring at the crying camel for a while, Vikir finally spoke up.\u201c\u2026\u2026Why are you crying?\u201d\u201cWhy would I cry!\u201dThe camel screeched and looked around for anyone to hear.Vikir closed his mouth for a moment, then opened it again.\u201cYou must have been very close to your brother.\u201d\u201cI was. She was very protective of me, an innocent, good child, not fit for Morg.\u201dAfter speaking, Camu squatted down against the earthen wall.They were about the same height, but somehow she seemed much smaller now.Vikir thought to himself.\u201cDon\u2019t be so sad, he must have gone in peace.\u201dWhen Vikir offered his awkward words of comfort, the camel snapped back.\u201cWho do you think you are?\u201dThe question was a mixture of anger and sadness.Vikir noticed.The camel understood him.\u201cI\u2019m a genius. I can\u2019t talk, so I can\u2019t listen.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cTell me straight. Tell me if I heard right.\u201dVikir could only nod with a heavy expression at Camus\u2019 words.Rococo\u2019s captive\u2019s last words hadn\u2019t been \u201cdead.\u201cEaten.The Rokoko are a tribe of shamans and cannibals.It is their custom to eat their captives.Hearing Vikir\u2019s confirmation, Camu began to tear up again.\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t protect you. I\u2019m sorry for you.\u201dCamu cried and cried.Vikir stood still beside her and remained silent.Surprised that Morg Camu, the queen of red and black, of fire and skewers, would hide such a thing behind her mask.\u2026\u2026And after some time had passed.Camu rose from her seat.She dabbed at her cheeks with her sleeve, wiping away the dried tears.She returned to her original cold expression.She looked at Vikir, who stood off to the side.\u201cThat wasn\u2019t so bad.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cI would have killed him if he\u2019d shown any flimsy sympathy.\u201dThere was no way a lowly threat from a fifteen-year-old girl was going to have any effect on a hundred-year-old man who\u2019d seen it all, but Vikir gave a grim nod anyway.\u2026\u2026Whatever.Sometimes it\u2019s comforting to just be there.Not knowing what to do with a 15-year-old girl who was crying, staying still had paid off this time.Next, Camu patted Vikir on the chest.\u201cNo time to mourn, boy. We need to recover and get revenge as soon as possible.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cCome with me. There\u2019s something we need to do together.\u201dThe camo sounded quite determined.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As you look into the abyss, the abyss looks into you. You must always be careful and cautious because if you look into the depths, you might be eaten by a giant demon.\u201dWhen the children heard the tutor\u2019s words, each of them felt a vague sense of fear and terror.Only one. Camouflage snorted.\u201cNonsense.\u201dThe tutor furrows her brow.\u201cMr. Camouflage, why do you say it\u2019s nonsense?\u201d\u201cYou said that when I look into the abyss, the abyss looks into me. That\u2019s bullshit.\u201dCamouflage gives you a stern look.\u201cThe Abyss of Mado is so wide and deep that no human mind can comprehend it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cBecause I look into the abyss, the abyss looks into me? Nonsense. Just because an ant can see me doesn\u2019t mean I can see the ant, and the abyss doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m looking into it, and it doesn\u2019t care. It doesn\u2019t care, so being afraid of the abyss looking into you is overly self-conscious.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWell, maybe once you get to a certain level, but don\u2019t instill fear in kids who can\u2019t even handle their mana yet.\u201dAt that, the tutor fell silent.The tutor\u2019s jaw dropped.In all the years he\u2019d been able to reach Class 5 and roll five mana circles, he\u2019d never once fallen into the abyss of Mado.Unless, of course, you\u2019re knocking on the door of Class 7, the ultimate in Mado.When the tedious lesson was over, the camel shook himself out of his seat and stood up.\u201cWhat\u2019s my uncle up to?\u201dThe only person in the family who understood his talent and whom he felt comfortable confiding in.Camu favored her younger brother, Morg Adolf, even more than her mother, Morg Respane, the head of the household.Then.Camu overheard her mother, Respane, and her uncle, Adolf, talking in the parlor.\u201cYou say that a ruby vein runs underground on the Baskerville family estate?\u201d\u201cYes, sister. It looks like a collision is inevitable.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a big deal, Hugo, and I don\u2019t want to have to bow down to that bastard\u2026\u2026 Plus, that\u2019s where the barbarians are raging, so does that make it a three-way war?\u201d\u201cWell, for one thing, the lode runs into the Baskervilles\u2019 territory, so we\u2019re at a legal disadvantage. Also, your barbarians are a group that the Baskervilles have been struggling with for years, so a local conflict would be very damaging to the family in more ways than one\u2026\u2026.\u201dRespane and Adolf looked grave.Then Camus stepped forward.\u201cI\u2019ll take a look.\u201dLesparne and Adolf gasped in surprise.\u201cDoes he know what\u2019s wrong with this\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cWait. Sister. Let\u2019s hear what the kid has to say. He\u2019s a genius, you know, and maybe he can point out something the grown-ups don\u2019t see.\u201dThis is why the camel likes his uncle Adolf.Respane and Adolf nodded in disbelief at what the camel was saying.\u201cHmmm. Let\u2019s give it a try, shall we?\u201d\u201cAfter that, let\u2019s solidify our cooperation and push for joint development? Hmm. Not a bad idea.\u201dIt\u2019s hard to believe they came from the mind of an 8-year-old.And then.\u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t it be great if we also discussed the issue of nepotism? I like the idea of in-laws going into business together, rather than just bowing out.\u201dA.k.a. the \u2018prenup strategy\u2019. Camu had another good suggestion.Lespane\u2019s eyes lit up and he asked.\u201cYou mean a pact with the Baskervilles? Who do you think we should send?\u201d\u201cWell, what about the triplets, Highsys, Middlesys, and Lowsys, who are useless to anyone?\u201dCamu answered nonchalantly, not giving it much thought.Morggar immediately begins to negotiate.Adolf took Camu with him to Baskerville, and Camu used his status as a child to talk to Hugo.He used his status as a child to speak to Hugo, comparing the underground veins to his hands and forearms.But. for the first time in his life, Camo had to suffer a bitter defeat.\u2018That one\u2019.From the opposing camp came an eight-year-old kid.I don\u2019t know the logic behind it, but he was definitely outgunned.The camel was so angry that he started crying and almost lost his mind.I\u2019ve never experienced anything like this in my life.No one else, not even his 8-year-old peers, not even teenagers, had ever done this to him.Not even adults.Everything in the world had always gone the way he wanted it to, and he had never been caught off guard.But that day was different.Everything had gone against Camu\u2019s will.And the reason for this was the dark-haired boy she had met that day, \u2018the one\u2019.\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for you\u2026\u2026!So the camel was furious. He wanted to show the first person he\u2019d ever met his true colors.So he challenged him to a fight in the training grounds, where swords and magic clashed.He fought with all his might.But the creature was cowardly and dodged the blows.\u2026Crackle! \u2026Crackle, crackle, crackle!He flicked his fingers at his forehead, as if he was just playing around.And it really hurt, too, as I kept getting hit.His face zoomed in for a close-up.I felt blinded by anger. You feel like it\u2019s just you and him in the world.All I could think about was punching him in the face.\u2026\u2026 Right then.Boom!There was an accident in the next room.There was a huge explosion and my clothes were burned to a crisp.I hastily tried to hide behind the dust and smoke, but it only saved me a few seconds of nakedness.It was only then that she became worried.There are tons of people here besides me and \u2018him\u2019.What an embarrassment!Morg\u2019s supernova, her genius, her next big thing, the person she respected and trusted, all in one moment, naked in front of everyone.Even eight-year-olds have their virginity. He has his pride.Camou fought desperately to keep the tears from falling.He was about to be stripped naked in front of all the kids his age who had always looked down on him.Especially when the sneaky sisters Highsis, Middlesis, and Lowsis were in the next room!I didn\u2019t want to cry naked in front of them. They would make fun of me for the rest of my life.\u2018\u2026\u2026 But what can I do?But there was no way out of this situation.Soon the dust would settle and she would be the laughing stock of the world.\u201cI should die.Camu thought to himself.\u2026\u2026 Just then.Flutter!His vision went black.Something heavy but warm and cozy covered the camel\u2019s naked body.She looked up and saw \u201chim\u201d right in front of her.He had removed his own clothes and covered her, leaving her naked.\u201cIsn\u2019t he ashamed?The camel thought so, but \u2018he\u2019 didn\u2019t seem to think so.He flaunted his nakedness for all to see. Without a trace of shame.The camel felt his heart pound in his chest as he stared at his naked body.The first time he\u2019d ever seen his number, the first time he\u2019d ever suffered a defeat, the first time he\u2019d ever seen a confident demeanor, the first time he\u2019d ever seen the naked body of someone his own age.So many firsts were jumbled together in Camu\u2019s mind.For the first time in her life, her good hair stood on end, and so did the time that flowed around her.For what seemed like an eternity, she stared at him.Secretly thinking to herself that it was a good thing that she had brought out the \u2018marriage pact strategy\u2019 before she left the clan.And then, one after another.He was pitted against his uncle.The camel had always liked and followed his uncle, but for that moment, he thought he was being unfair.\u201cHe\u2019s a grown man, and he\u2019s persecuting a child.She had always been grateful to her uncle for treating her like an adult, but not as much as she was at this moment.What?\u2018The kid\u2019 continued to challenge his uncle.An indomitable spirit that refused to back down in the face of such a stark disparity in skill.Camu felt mixed feelings.He knew of his uncle\u2019s strength and greatness, but he couldn\u2019t stop his gaze from drifting to\u2026\u2026.Inwardly, he was surprised that he was hoping for such a ridiculous situation, that \u2018that guy\u2019 would defeat his uncle.And then.The fantasy became a reality.In a situation that even the strongest camo thought was hopeless, \u2018the one\u2019 surprisingly overcame his uncle.chirp chirp chirp\u2026\u2026A broken water jar, a stream of water, and a dazed uncle.The camo cheered at this shocking outcome.It even jumped up and down in place.Her uncle looked shocked and expressed his disappointment, but it was none of her business.She had always despised the frivolous laughing and jumping of 8-year-olds her age, but before she knew it, she was laughing and jumping like a normal 8-year-old.After the negotiation went well.Arriving home, the camel went to bed.The stuffed animal she always hugged when she went to sleep, she decided to put it aside.\u201cI\u2019m not a child anymore.\u201dInstead, her usual cuddle had changed.Baskerville\u2019s black blood.The cloak that \u201che\u201d had wrapped her in became her first love.Camu slept in it every night, always burying his face in it as he fell asleep.The smell of musty sweat was somehow thought to be a good thing, and I slept better with my nose buried in it.Sometimes my heart would suddenly thump in my chest, other times I would feel a tingling sensation all over my body, and other times I would nibble my collar with my teeth on a sudden impulse.When the nanny would suggest doing the laundry, Camu would raise his hand and firmly stop her.\u201cThese things aren\u2019t worth washing.After that, she never washed it.And so the seasons changed, and a few birthday cakes came and went, and the camel always thought the same thing.\u201cWhere would she be now, what would she be doing, and how tall would she be?And just like that, the little girl became a lady.She went to the ruby mines all the time because she loved rubies, but she never saw \u2018him\u2019.She had only heard rumors on the wind that he had gone on a long training run.And time passed.One day, Camu heard a rumor.There was a fairly large city on the edge of the Baskerville estate, adjacent to the Morg estate.It was rumored that a young deputy had been appointed there.Apparently, he caused several major accidents upon his arrival.Of course, by accidents, I don\u2019t really mean accidents, I mean mega-achievements.Upon hearing that he had burned 10 billion on a single stick, the camel slapped his knee.\u201cYou\u2019ve grown up.She made her way over to Gajusil.\u201cWhat, you want me to send you on a joint operation with the Baskervilles?\u201d\u201cYes, mom. Right now.\u201dCamouflage pawed at her patriarch, Lespane, as they made their way to the Baskervilles\u2019 estate.Before doing so, he made sure to identify the new deputy magistrate of Underdog City as his partner in the joint operation.And a day before the Baskervilles were due to arrive.Camo had made all the arrangements.The fort\u2019s watchtower, with its many beautiful cotton blossoms, was chosen as the meeting place.A little embarrassed, he kept Morg\u2019s prying eyes as far back as possible.There, among the white flowers and their delicate scent, the seven-year wait would end.The camel went to bed with a puffed-up chest.\u2026\u2026And that day.The camel was furious.He had picked an atmospheric spot, but it was already in shambles.His sisters, who had been so disrespectful when he was younger, and who now dared not even breathe in his presence when he was older, had ruined it.\u201cWhat the \u2026\u2026 do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201dCamu asked with infernal fury.The aftermath of Romantic\u2019s destruction was horrifying.Morg\u2019s three sisters sobbed, unable to speak English.\u201cKaa, Camu, my sisters are\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWoohoo, we just wanted to keep the intruders out\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWell, they started the fight!\u201dBut Camu\u2019s mood was already low.The reunion he\u2019d been waiting seven years for had been ruined.\u201cCamo, are you talking to me, sisters?\u201d\u201cHic! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!\u201d\u201cGet out of the way. If you don\u2019t want to be like that.\u201dThe camel didn\u2019t really intend to kill the three sisters, but he did intend to spank them really badly.But he didn\u2019t have to, because they scurried away on their own.Then.Camou reined in his horse and stood in front of \u2018him\u2019.\u201cWelcome, partner.\u201dSeeing him again after seven years, he didn\u2019t look much different than when they first met.He wasn\u2019t much taller than her, as if he was still growing, but his face had changed slightly.His jawline was more defined, and his nose was more prominent.It was better than the version that had been glorified and beautified in Camu\u2019s imagination.\u2018You\u2019ve grown a lot. Mmm. You\u2019ve grown.The camel nodded. His face flushed red of its own accord.Why did the naked body under the blood wind of the eight-year-old suddenly appear in his mind?\u201c\u2026\u2026Mo, has your body changed a lot?It was a camouflage that didn\u2019t use any magic, but it was unnecessarily hot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Here, eat.\u201dVikir pressed a hand to his forehead as the camouflage man practically shoved food at him.They had been in the fort for over ten days now.In that time, the camo had gotten over the grief of his brother\u2019s death.But the way he\u2019d gotten over it was causing Vikir quite a headache, \u2026\u2026 because he\u2019d been coming to the door of his quarters every day, demanding to eat with him.Six times a day!\u201c\u2026\u2026What kind of meals do you eat six times a day?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s healthy to eat small and often.\u201d\u201cI tend to binge eat one meal a day. Maybe I should skip the next meal.\u201d\u201cUh-huh. Don\u2019t you know that starvation leads to loss of combat power? It\u2019s against military law.\u201d\u201cThen you\u2019re not really eating.\u201dAt Vikir\u2019s point, the camo frowned and averted his gaze.He shoves a bit of salad into his mouth and grunts.\u201cI get full just watching you eat.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir chewed her meat and frowned.He couldn\u2019t figure out why a 15-year-old girl from another family he hadn\u2019t seen in seven years was being so hard on him.\u201cIs she trying to arrange a marriage?Before his regression, Camus had discussed strategic marriage with a number of prospects, but none of them had actually gotten married.It would be troubling if he had chosen himself as a candidate for an arranged marriage.\u201cI\u2019m leaving Baskerville.If you leave, I will destroy you.What has been your reward for doing all the dirty work in the house?You must repay me for all the foul and disgusting sensations of that moment when you stood on the gallows waiting for Guillotine.So it\u2019s better not to get involved with Morg\u2019s women.The last thing I need is a scandal or a love triangle later on.This was true not only of Camu, but of any woman in the world.Unaware of Vikir\u2019s thoughts, the camel still looks innocent and asks.\u201cIs there poop in the meat?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou look like you chewed shit.\u201dHearing the camel\u2019s words, Vikir blinked a few times with a nonchalant expression before picking up his fork and eating again.All the while, she never looked up.Meanwhile.Vikir\u2019s cold demeanor was a breath of fresh air for Camu.Usually, when she asks to join her for a meal, everyone is happy to oblige, men and women, young and old.Especially men outside the clan, whose faces were already lit up with anticipation before they even sat down to eat.It was only natural.Camus was young, brilliant, beautiful, and a future ruler.But Vikir\u2019s 15 years of common sense and experience had been thoroughly discredited.\u201cI think we should eat separately from now on.\u201d\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable.\u201dVikir said, slamming his fork down.At that, Camu nodded as if he could agree.He was right, the cafeteria where Vikir ate was almost exclusively filled with women.Women receiving their meals, women serving them. Hardly a man in sight.Camu chuckled.\u201cAlas, what can I say. Morg is a matriarchal society, so most of the fighters are women, and the men do most of the cooking in the kitchen back there.\u201dIt\u2019s not like the Baskervilles, an extreme macho society.Just as males have a slight advantage when it comes to swordsmanship, females have a slight advantage when it comes to magic, so naturally Morg\u2019s army is made up mostly of women.Instead, the men are in charge of supply in the rear, a job that is actually just as important as combat.\u201cMy uncle, who is in charge of supply, is currently ill with chest pains, so we don\u2019t have many supplies. Eat up, though.\u201dCamu ignored Vikir\u2019s offer to eat separately.Instead, he scooped some boiled potatoes onto Vikir\u2019s plate and slyly changed the subject.\u201cYou don\u2019t have this in your house, do you?\u201dThe potatoes were the object of Camu\u2019s shrug.It was a super potato that had been modified by Morg\u2019s plant-based magic, making it far more nutritious and faster to absorb than a normal potato.The downside was that they were so nutritious that they lacked flavor.Camou chewed on the fluffy potato and said.\u201cThe only flaw in the nutritional improvement is the lack of taste, but it\u2019s still better than the haggis you eat back home, right?\u201dVikir looked away from the potato and picked up his fork.Apparently, it\u2019s hard to shoo away a camel that\u2019s been looming over you for a while.This was Morg\u2019s territory, and she was in charge.Vikir decided to go along with the camel\u2019s change of subject for now.\u201cIt\u2019s not bad.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dCamu repeated.Vikir picked up Morg\u2019s potatoes with a serious look on her face.\u201cThey\u2019re not bad. It\u2019s just that you guys cook them badly.\u201d\u201cEh? I\u2019m sorry, but the cook in this fortress used to be a chef in the Imperial City, and I have a picky palate, so he\u2019s specially brought in. If it\u2019s cooked by him and it doesn\u2019t taste good, it\u2019s not there.\u201dVikir shook his head at that.\u201cWell, with the \u2026\u2026 supply disruption, we\u2019ll have to eat this for a while anyway.Vikir picked up the potatoes, stood up, and headed to the kitchen.Using a knife, Vikir cut the potatoes into small pieces and lightly rolled them in salt and vinegar.Then, she added the dried leaves of the mentrake and the juice of the sabik tree to the pot with the potatoes and started steaming.The chef in the kitchen saw Vikir and came over in surprise.\u201cHey, what are you doing\u2026\u2026.\u201dBut the chef is interrupted by a camel that has just entered the kitchen.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dShe\u2019s watching Vikir\u2019s handiwork closely.Next, Vikir holds a lightly steamed potato in front of the chef.\u201cThis will remove the earthy flavor and bring out the sugar, and the texture will be as crisp as a regular potato.\u201dThe chefs in the kitchen let out a collective gasp.\u201cWow, there\u2019s a way to prepare these potatoes like this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, it\u2019s a new breed, how?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true, it doesn\u2019t have an earthy flavor, and the texture is just like a regular potato.\u201dThe chefs immediately put Vikir\u2019s simple recipe into practice.The Morg warriors were also delighted with the change in flavor of the potatoes in their rations.So did Staffordshire and the Highbrow, Middlebrow, and Lowbrow triplets who ate among the Morg.\u201cMaster, how did you know how to eat those potatoes? Apparently the Morg didn\u2019t either.\u201dStaffordshire asked, his eyes wide.Vikir merely looks away, unable to answer.For now, this Morg\u2019s potatoes are new to the market.In a few decades, it will be a battlefield staple.In the Age of Doom, when all supplies were scarce, warriors in the war against demons developed ways to make their limited food supplies as palatable as possible during their countless days in the wilderness.Mercenaries who had been through the wringer had learned to squeeze every last drop of flavor out of the simplest of ingredients, such as those who figured out how to take the astringency and earthy smell out of the potato.Vikir, too, had been in many battles and was naturally familiar with many survivalist dishes.Many of them were learned while being poisoned or maimed, and some of them were truly eye-opening delicacies.Meanwhile.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe camel\u2019s eyes widened as he tasted the newly prepared potatoes.\u201cHey. Do you want to come over and cook?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah. I\u2019ll just take you in.\u201dVikir sighed lightly.The camo still had a twinkle in her eye, though.\u201cSpeaking of which, when do you get into the academy? I\u2019ll match you. I\u2019m probably getting an early entry by a year or two. It would be so much fun if we could be first years together\u2026\u2026.\u201dJust then.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe playful camel\u2019s eyes immediately changed color.She stops talking and closes her mouth.And then.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir\u2019s mouth fell open as well.The air outside the window changed in an instant.They both felt it at the same time. A sense of foreboding that the others hadn\u2019t yet felt.And then.Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle.A loud bell began to ring outside the window.It was the signal for a barbarian attack.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A tribe of brown-skinned savages.They had swords and bows in their hands and were attacking Morg\u2019s fortress.Ping-.An arrow flies, and a soldier is sent tumbling down the ramparts.In the blink of an eye, Balak\u2019s barbarian warriors overturned all the skirmishers and scrambled up the ramparts.Boom, boom, boom!They set fire to the cotton fields below the walls and dragged the barbarian slaves with them.Thump, thump, thump!The barking of dogs everywhere.The Barbarians of Balak rode their great wolves in groups of two or three, and in their hands they carried nooses of strong rope.These were thrown into the air, and a slave, always a woman, a man, and a child, was taken alive.It was like a hunt.The surprise was so swift that the fortress was in an uproar.Flames were everywhere, soldiers were dying, and many slaves were being dragged alive.And in the midst of it all, Vikir descended.Some of the barbarian women\u2019s eyes lit up when they saw him.\u201c\u05d0\u05d9\u05e4\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u201d\u201c\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d6\u05d4 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u201d\u201c\u05d1\u05d5\u05d0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d1\u05d9\u05d7\u05d3 \u05d1\u05d4\u05d2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea\u201dThey tossed the nooses into the air, swung them up, and hurled them at Vikir\u2019s throat in unison.And with that.Tut-tut-tut.The three-strand rope noose snaps around Vikir\u2019s neck.The barbarian warriors kicked at the mounted wolf\u2019s loins, driving it like a horse.But.\u2026Crack!The wolf was forced to stop running.Vikir was standing there, unmoving.Thud.The rope noose tightened around his neck, but Vikir didn\u2019t budge.Next, Vikir twisted the noose with his hands and gave it a firm squeeze.Quack, quack, quack!The wolf and the three barbarian female warriors sprawled across the floor.The faces of the barbarian men around them twisted.They shouted something and pointed their bows at Vikir.Beep, beep, beep.Arrows of incredible speed. In unison, they lunged for Vikir.But Vikir\u2019s hand was much faster.\u2026Whoosh!Vikir quickly drew his longsword and imbued it with an aura.The liquid aura of the Gradient symbolized a single point on the tip of the blade.Papapapap!Vikir drew a figure of eight with the tip of his blade, slicing all the flying arrows in half.The barbarians shrank back in horror at the sight of Vikir\u2019s aura.They couldn\u2019t help but notice. This manipulative power could only be seen by those who touched some singularity.Vikir squinted, taking in the group of Balak before him.Brown skin. Hair of varying shades of silver, gray, and black.Faces painted black, collars with thorns around their necks, riding on the backs of large wolves and using bows as their primary weapons.\u201cJust like I remembered before the regression.I\u2019ve faced Balak\u2019s warriors many times before.They are not only belligerent, but each warrior is highly skilled.It is fortunate that this is a plain with a fortress, for if we turned against them in the middle of a dark jungle, we would have had a hard time.\u2018Before we set out, Hugo assured me that we were not to engage until we were joined by the main body.\u2019This was Baskerville territory, but it was leased to Morg, so Vikir had no reason to risk his life in dispute with them.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir pressed the barbarian warriors with just the right amount of momentum, and they didn\u2019t hesitate to charge at him.They had seen the ghostly swordsmanship Vikir had displayed just moments before.Then.\u2026Boom!There was a loud explosion, followed by searing flames.An earthen wall collapsed, and a girl stepped out from behind it.The one who would one day be called an enemy and the Queen of Black.Morg Camu, she glared at the barbarian warriors of Balak with bloodshot eyes.\u201cDie!\u201dCamu crossed her hands.Quadra-casting, four offensive spells manifested and began to shake the battlefield upside down.Powerful blasts of fire and wind, steel and rock, drove firestorms and rock showers.Balak\u2019s barbarian warriors were biting the wolves back, signaling loudly among themselves.Perhaps it was time to retreat.Camu kept the invaders at bay, but glanced back at Vikir.Her gaze was drawn to the few drops of black liquid on the tip of Vikir\u2019s blade.\u201cYou were a Gradient? That\u2019s amazing.\u201dCamu was genuinely impressed.What kind of mastery was a Gradient?An exalted realm that ordinary people couldn\u2019t reach even after a lifetime of training.Even the people of Baskerville, who were said to be swordsmanship geniuses, could only reach it by the time they were thirty.\u201cI see. You are the only man I can recognize.\u201dCamou smirked and stepped up to Vikir\u2019s side.She had taken a defensive stance, as if she thought Vikir was tired of projecting his aura.\u201cStay back, it\u2019s dangerous.\u201dStepping in front of Vikir, the camo created a wall of steel and rock while summoning icicles of fire and ice to pound the field.Three circles of magic, even a quadruple cast.Truly a Morgue genius, a talent worthy of a kick in the ass at age 15.\u201cI will avenge my brother\u2019s death!\u201dCamu summoned all the mana in his body and hurled it at the barbarians.But.The battlefield is a place where even the most genius of talents can\u2019t let their guard down.\u2026Pow!Camou frowned at the stinging sensation at the nape of his neck.\u201cAn arrow?But if it was an arrow, he would be dead before he had a chance to think about it.He reached up and pulled the thing out of his nape.Something so small and thin it could have slipped through the shields floating in the air.It was a cactus needle.PING-Camu felt his head spin.The thorns must have been laced with paralyzing poison.\u201c\u05e0\u05ea\u05e4\u05e1! \u05d4\u05d9\u05d0 \u05d0\u05e9\u05ea\u05d9 \u05e2\u05db\u05e9\u05d9\u05d5!\u201dI see one of the barbarian warriors pointing at the camel and jumping up and down with glee.Apparently, he was the one who shot the tranquilizer needle.And now.Whirly-lic-The barbarian warrior threw the lasso he was holding at the camel.It looks like he intends to capture the camel alive.But.Jaws-The lasso was intercepted halfway.Vikir reached out and caught the lasso halfway.Kukuk\u2026\u2026The barbarian warrior and Vikir began to struggle.The other man tugged at the noose with all his might, but the already superhuman Vikir was no match for his strength.Boom!The barbarian warrior was thrown off the wolf\u2019s back and sprawled on the ground.\u201cThat\u2019s at least a half-wit.Vikir shook his head as he watched the Balak warrior roll around on his back.Vikir looked back at Camu.\u201cI think we should retreat from here.\u201d\u201cWhat? But the farmlands and the prisoners?\u201d\u201cIt would be better to refrain from engaging them until we have rejoined the main body of the Baskervilles.\u201dThe camo looked conflicted.Rationally, it would be better to back off moderately here.But.She had just lost her beloved half-brother, and in the heat of the moment, her emotions got the better of her judgment.He was taken alive by a savage tribe. He must have suffered terrible pain and terror until the moment of his death.The image of her brother flashed through her mind, and her fists tightened.Just then.PING-!A sharp piercing sound came from somewhere.Vikir instinctively jerked his head back.An arrow whizzes past the nape of his neck, sending him flying into the city wall.Boom!The blow was strong enough to pierce the ear of the rampart.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dVikir jerked his head back.A lone female warrior stared back at him, perched on the back of a large wolf.Black hair mingled with silver, tipped with triangular ears, and a face smeared with ash.She threw her lasso right at Vikir, as if she knew he would dodge it.The snake-like lasso swooped down, aiming for Vikir\u2019s throat at an exquisite angle.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir didn\u2019t react, instead calmly reaching for his sword.The black aura that symbolized the Baskervilles drew four teeth in the air.The noose snapped in half in midair.Just then.\u201cDanger!\u201dThere was a hand on Vikir\u2019s back.He turned his head to see a camouflage of stiffened bodies pushing against Vikir\u2019s back.And behind him, the barbarian man who had fallen off the wolf\u2019s back earlier, tugging at the noose through clenched teeth.I thought he\u2019d be a half-wit, but he\u2019s stronger than I thought.The noose was wrapped tightly around the camel\u2019s waist, and the barbarian took off running with the paralyzing poison.\u2018\u2026\u2026So this is what happens.\u2019Vikir sighed softly.A momentary lapse in judgment is costly.Morg\u2019s next patriarch would learn this the hard way.\u201cEven in her original history, she was kidnapped by barbarian tribes once.Even before the regression.As a young man, Camouflage was captured as a prisoner of war and taken away as a hostage.Of course, it wasn\u2019t long before she returned home, slaughtering barbarian tribes.It was during this time that she became known as the Queen of Enemies and Black.\u201cBut I still have to do my job.Even though it\u2019s not Baskerville\u2019s business, Vikir has formed a strategic alliance with Morg.Vikir quickly unleashes her aura.Ka-ang!The silver-haired female warrior\u2019s weapon blocked Vikir\u2019s path.\u201c\u2026\u2026bow?Vikir\u2019s eyes narrowed as he realized the identity of the thing blocking his sword.The Balak female warrior in front of him had swung her bow with its full length, blocking Vikir\u2019s blade.Then.Vikir locked eyes with the woman before him.A strange sense of disquiet washed over him.\u201cYou look familiar.Just as Vikir was about to rummage through his memory.The warrior spoke up.\u201cYou said you\u2019d see \u2026\u2026 again, didn\u2019t you?\u201dShe spoke in broken Imperial.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 49": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Return of the Iron-blood Sword HoundCH 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 48 \u2013 Revenge of the Iron-Blooded Sword HoundVikir thought.\u201cShe looks familiar.The woman before him must have seen him before.\u2026\u2026 But she didn\u2019t have long to think about it.Pfft.The next moment, the warrior\u2019s long legs flew out and kicked Vikir in the stomach.A tingling sensation down his spine, an unbelievable weight.There was no way she could have pulled off such a move without using her aura.Vikir somersaulted a couple of times in the air before landing on his feet.\u201cMastery.The barbarian warrior before him was no ordinary bet.With the charcoal black paint on her face, it was impossible to make out her features, but she looked to be in her late teens, early twenties at least.It would be difficult to fight her while hiding her skills.Vikir lowered his stance and was about to prepare to fight.The female warrior\u2019s mouth opened.\u201cYou said we\u2019d see each other again, didn\u2019t you?\u201dShe spoke in broken Imperial.Vikir suddenly remembered where he had seen this barbarian warrior before.The girl who had once been kept in a cage like a beast during a raid on an illegal slave auction in Underdog City.She was destined to be turned into flesh by perverted nobles.Vikir had helped her escape by turning the auction house upside down and opening the cage door.He even gave her a potion.\u201cYou return the favor.\u201dThe barbarian girl shook her head at Vikir\u2019s scowl.\u201cMe. A slave, avenging my capture. Morg. Nothing to do with you.\u201dApparently, House Morg had something to do with this barbarian girl\u2019s captivity by the slavers.Not surprising, since the Morg have been at odds with the barbarians over the development of their ruby mines.Perhaps this latest raid was in retaliation for the barbarian girl\u2019s capture by the slavers and her subsequent treatment.Vikir narrowed his eyes.\u201cThat said, she\u2019s a pretty high ranking girl.And then. The barbarian girl jerked her chin at the wolf in the distance.The wolf had a lassoed camel tied around its waist.\u201cFor what you\u2019ve done. We pay him back. We. The woman. The next leader. We take them.\u201dBalak and Morg faced off. The girl swung her bow, knocking the wolves around her back.The signal to retreat.All of Balak\u2019s warriors began to fall back in unison. As if their purpose was over with the capture of the camouflage.The barbarian girl looked slightly troubled, then turned to Vikir.\u201cIf you want your girl back, follow me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Do you speak Imperial?\u201dVikir continued to speak to her, hoping to gather some more clues, to buy a little time.But that was it.As soon as the words were out of her mouth, the barbarian girl turned and disappeared into the jungle.Vikir was about to give chase.Beep, beep, beep.It was impossible because of the countless showers of arrows falling down.\u2018Should I reveal my \u2026\u2026power?If he unleashed all of his hidden power, he might be able to break through that rain of arrows.But.\u201cCamo!\u201dThat was impossible, as Adolf, leading his soldiers, charged into the battlefield.Vikir took a few steps back to avoid the arrows.With so many eyes on him, he couldn\u2019t afford to show his strength.\u201cGive me my nephew!\u201dEnraged, Adolf cast a great spell, turning the earth upside down.But Balak\u2019s warriors were fast and skilled.The vanguard easily sidestepped Adolf\u2019s magic and disappeared over the water, while the laggards scattered in countless directions to confuse the pursuit.In the end, Balak\u2019s raiders fled into the jungle, most of them, leaving only a few casualties behind.\u201cThis, this nonsense\u2026\u2026!\u201dAdolf stood dumbfounded.So did the mages who had brought reinforcements.It took less than three minutes for the Morgans to respond to the emergency signal announcing the invasion, but the Balak assault was so methodical and swift that it would have been all over in that time.The raiders were well organized and caught the inexperienced camo off guard.Slaves and crops would have been one thing, but the kidnapping of the next head of the family was a big deal.\u201cHow can this be good!\u201dAdolf stamped his foot as he watched the sun set over the water.The waters of the Red and Black Mountains were terrifying, but they became even more dangerous after dark.Entering the waters at night was suicide, and even the wizards of Morgoth were not easily pursued.One wrong move could mean annihilation.\u2026\u2026 Just then.\u201cWe can still catch up.\u201dVikir stepped forward.He gazed into the depths of the water.\u201cI\u2019ve been in there when I was a kid.\u201dA lie, of course. He\u2019d only been in there once, briefly, when he was eight years old.But Vikir had searched, scouted, and slaughtered countless times before his return, and he knew most of the geography underwater.Meanwhile, the wizards of Morg were dumbfounded by Vikir\u2019s words.One wizard raised his eyebrows and spoke up.\u201cEntering the Black Mountains with a dark enemy is suicide\u2026\u2026.\u201dBut he didn\u2019t finish his sentence.\u201cThose who won\u2019t go, go. I will not trouble you later.\u201dMorg Adolf, his eyes bloodshot, stood before Vikir.He had recognized Vikir\u2019s extraordinary abilities.With that, Adolph bent down at the waist to be eye level with Vikir.\u2026Boom!Adolf squeezed Vikir\u2019s hand with both of his hands, and he said desperately.\u201cPlease, I beg you. Help me save my niece.\u201dVikir nodded.The raiders from earlier had obviously thrown their nooses at him, and it was the camel who had returned the favor.A debt must be paid, and without another word, Vikir turned and walked into the tangled jungle of roots.\u201cMaybe this is my chance to get out from under Hugo\u2019s control.They say a crisis is an opportunity, and Vikir thought he might be able to use this to his advantage.Dusk fell.The earth spider was losing.* * *The watery terrain between the enemy and the Black Mountains is littered with all manner of fiends, poisonous plants, and traps.Bone-sucking mosquitoes, venomous thorns, spiders that walk without making a sound, narrow, deep cliffs between rocks hidden by fallen leaves.A normal person wouldn\u2019t be able to survive even a few hours in these waters, and the situation isn\u2019t much different for beings who have reached the pinnacle of nothingness.What\u2019s more, the nights are so deep and dark that even barbarians are reluctant to pass through them.All sorts of dangerous things are awakened from their daytime slumber.So it\u2019s no wonder that even the bravest of Morg\u2019s warriors wouldn\u2019t dare venture into the murky waters.\u2026\u2026But.In the jungle, among all these potential killers, there was a being who seemed to be weaving in and out of them with incredible speed.Vikir. Vikir van Baskerville.He burned blades of grass to scare away poisonous insects, crossed cliffs hidden beneath dirt and fallen leaves, and rubbed animal feces on his clothes to hide his scent and creep.All in a series of extremely skillful movements.The Morg and Baskervilles who followed could only hold their tongues.\u201cAre all \u2026\u2026 Baskerville boys like that?\u201d\u201cOf course not, you\u2019re a special case.\u201dStaffordshire shrugged at Adolph\u2019s quizzical look.But Vikir, who is actually leading the way, is nonchalant.\u201cIt was a universal tracking technique in the Age of Destruction.Swordsmen of that era weren\u2019t just good at swordfighting.There was nothing they couldn\u2019t do: foraging, scouting, searching, hiding, ambushing, assassinating, pharmaceutical, healing, and cooking.It was a time of survival.SPOT!Vikir halved a rotting log in his path and stepped through it.The aura of the Gradient, vibrating and spinning at lightning speed at the tip of his blade, sliced through everything in an instant.Everyone was truly in awe of Vikir\u2019s ability to find and remove obstacles, both large and small, single-handedly.Especially the Baskervilles\u2019 triplets, who followed closely behind him.\u201cCool.\u201d\u201cCool.\u201d\u201cDelicious.\u201dThe third one stuttered a bit after his finger was cut off and reattached, but they were all on the same page.Then.\u2026Stop!Vikir, who had been walking ahead, halted.Looking at the bare footprints in the damp mud, Vikir checked the direction of the wind, then ducked low and circled behind a bush.To hide his scent.The warriors of Morg and Baskerville followed Vikir back behind the bushes.Then they saw a faint glimmer of light.Balak\u2019s hunters were gathered around a small campfire.Rustle \u2013 ding \u2013 ding \u2013 dingIn the forest at night, even the smallest sounds of human movement can be as loud as thunder.Furthermore, the Balak hunters had scattered dry leaves and sticks around their makeshift campsite.They had scattered them around their makeshift camp so that they would be heard.Vikir pondered for a moment how to muffle the sound as they approached.Then.\u201c\u2026\u2026Silence.\u201dAdolph chanted the words with a terse syllable.Instantly, a translucent aura enveloped everyone\u2019s feet.Then, to my surprise, there was no sound as they walked.This is magic, and Adolf\u2019s magic specializes in support.Vikir had once been an assassin himself, and he knew what a ridiculously deceptive perk it was to be silent when approaching a target.Soon, the pursuers were close to their target.\u201c\u05dc\u05d0 \u05e7\u05d9\u05d1\u05dc\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d1\u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u201d\u201c\u05d0\u05d4\u05d1\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d3 \u05e9\u05e4\u05d2\u05e9\u05ea\u05d9 \u05dc\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d6\u05de\u05df \u05de\u05d4.\u201d\u201c\u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d9\u05db\u05d5\u05dc \u05dc\u05dc\u05db\u05ea \u05dc\u05ea\u05e4\u05d5\u05e1 \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d5 \u05e9\u05d5\u05d1\u201dThe hunters rested, unaware that they had become the hunted.Vikir picked out his targets by the faint light of the remaining fire.Up ahead, he saw the barbarian girl who had parried his sword and kicked him earlier.She was barking out orders as if she were the leader of the group.The barbarian man who had shot the tranquilizer needle and thrown the lasso earlier grumbles as he follows her instructions.And so on and so forth, until, in the center of the gathering of Balak\u2019s barbarian warriors, the final target was located.Morg Camu.She could be seen kneeling, naked.Her hands and feet are tied to stakes driven into the ground behind her, and a collar is around her neck.The good news is that there are no signs of beatings or other abuse.The camel was cursing something at the barbarians and didn\u2019t seem particularly fazed.Vikir let out a small sigh.\u201cNo wonder he\u2019s naked every time I see him.Just then.\u2026Jaw!Someone touched Vikir\u2019s shoulder.He turned to see Morg Adolf standing there.Immediately, he spoke, his complexion and voice hardened.\u201cI will never forget this favor, nephew.\u201dThe title \u2026\u2026 seemed a little odd, but now was not the time to point it out.No 2 of the Mado Sect.It looks like Mado Star Adolph is about to reveal his true power.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was bound and gagged, glaring at the barbarians of Balak.With her powers of observation and memorization, she had been able to pick up some of the names and ranks of her attackers while being dragged here.Beyond the faint warmth and light of the campfire, she could see the silhouettes of the barbarians.The supposed leader is a girl of about seventeen.Her name is Aiyen.Her hair is a mix of silver and black, her ears are pointed and triangular, and her face is charcoal-black.But one thing is for sure: she\u2019s good.She was powerful enough to hold off Vikir, a lowly Gradient.Beside her, a man grumbled as he added wood to the fire.The man who had shot himself with the tranquilizer needle was named Ahun, and his back was still aching from Vikir\u2019s attack earlier.The other women and men were also there, most of them around 17 or 18 years old.They had not made a large bonfire, but had thrown ashes on top of the fire to make a gentle roaring fire, and were sitting around it in a circle.\u201cI didn\u2019t catch the husband feeling.\u201d\u201cI liked that girl I met earlier.\u201d\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll catch him again someday.\u201dThe three women warriors chattered amongst themselves.Camu could hear, if not speak, the barbarian language, so he could get a sense of what was going on in their conversation.The savages of Balak always go on \u201chusband hunts,\u201d \u201csaxi hunts,\u201d \u201cson-in-law hunts,\u201d and \u201cdaughter-in-law hunts\u201d around this time of year.The targets are other tribes and sometimes even empire borders.The reason for this practice of finding spouses in different areas is simple. To avoid genetic diseases caused by inbreeding and to bring in fresh blood from outside.This is why most warriors who go out to find a mate want a superior seed.Once they\u2019ve kidnapped the right person, if they\u2019re good enough, they\u2019ll start making children, and if they\u2019re not, they\u2019ll enslave or kill them.They especially welcome women, because women are more important than men when it comes to calling the population.Is that why? The savage boy, who goes by the name Ahun, has been staring at the camel for a while now and smiling wickedly.\u201cThe men of the tribe must be happy, having captured such a fine female.\u201dUnderstanding Ahun\u2019s words, Camu gritted his teeth.\u201cYou want me to take the seed of your barbarians? I\u2019ll die for that!\u201dCamu immediately tried to bite her tongue, but Ahun was quicker to gag her.Ahun chuckled and stuck an arrowhead under Camu\u2019s chin.\u201cPerhaps this cheeky slave needs an education.\u201dHe was just about to touch the camel\u2019s body.\u2026Jaw!Someone stepped in front of Ahun.Aiyen. A female warrior leading a young Balak hunting party.She pressed the nock of her bow to Ahun\u2019s sternum.\u201cGet out.\u201dAiyen\u2019s words were short.Ahun\u2019s brow furrowed.\u201cWhat the hell, boss. I got him.\u201d\u201cBullshit. Just a little less.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, I shot the tranquilizer needle and lassoed him!\u201d\u201cWho did that for you?\u201dAi Yan asked coldly, leaving Ah Hoon speechless for a moment.She continued.\u201cYou would have been dead if I hadn\u2019t interrupted that \u2018boy with the sword\u2019 earlier.\u201dShe is referring to Vikir.Ahun began to tremble as Aiyen mentioned the situation earlier.He cried out in frustration.\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying that this female belongs to you?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cThe boss is a woman!\u201d\u201cWhat does it matter?\u201dAt Ai Yan\u2019s retort, Ah Hoon fell silent, as if he were speechless.Then, frosty blue flesh began to erupt from Ai Yan\u2019s entire body.A silvery aura emanated from the bow she was clutching.Upon seeing it, the camel\u2019s eyes widened.That was the liquid aura, the symbol of the Gradient.Although it was faint, it clearly revealed the prowess of a lower-ranked Graduator.A 17-year-old grader. There were geniuses like that in the world besides Vikir and himself.Whether Camu was surprised or not, Aiyen didn\u2019t seem to mind at all.Ahun, meanwhile, bowed low before Aiyen\u2019s power.\u201cCome at me whenever you want. I\u2019ll beat you to a bloody pulp.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026an kouwa.\u201d\u201cNo?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026No. Whatever. I give up. She\u2019s yours.\u201dAhun shook his head, a mixture of anger and bitterness.Aiyen tore her gaze away from Ahun and looked back at Camu.He didn\u2019t particularly feel that she had saved him.Neither did he.\u201cGood eyes, good constitution. You must have good blood.\u201dAiyen looked at the camel with the eyes of a thorough merchant.\u201cI, too, was once captured and sold into slavery by your empire, especially the Morg.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAnd so it will be with you.\u201dAfter speaking, Aiyen closes his eyes for a moment, seemingly remembering someone.\u201cOnly, you will not be as fortunate as I was.\u201dOpening his eyes, Aiyen grits his teeth and stares into Camu\u2019s eyes.\u201cI will take my time, slowly, bone by bone, soul by soul. I will make it a daily routine for you to lick your tongue between my toes\u2026\u2026.\u201dBut Ai Yan was unable to finish her sentence.\u2026Quack!A loud explosion erupted from the bushes behind them.\u201cDie, beastly savages.\u201dThe voice sounded like a death sentence.At the same time, ice picks flew out, piercing through Balak\u2019s hunting birds.In less than a second, three or four of the hunters in the rear were dead.Behind them was Morg Adolf, a reddish mana stalk.Soon, Morg and Baskerville\u2019s pursuers were on the battlefield.\u201cI\u2019ll repay your debt.\u201dBaskerville of Staffordshire and the triplets of the Baskerville family slashed at several Balak hunters with their swords.Morg\u2019s wizards were desperate.Numerous offensive spells were flying, creating a blaze of light and sound.\u2026\u2026?Somehow, the Balak hunters were unable to respond.Despite the vast disparity in power, if they focused on planning and fleeing rather than fighting back, they should be able to minimize the damage.But why?Balak\u2019s hunting party, and the wolves they ride, are greatly perplexed and restless.It was as if they were more worried about Morg and Baskerville\u2019s surprise than they were about the lights and sounds they were creating.\u201cUgh! These lunatics are making such a ruckus in the waters of the night!\u201dAhun jumped back in surprise.His uneasy gaze was fixed not on the swords and magic raging around him, but on the darkness of the water beyond.It was the same for their leader, Aiyen.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAiyen moved quickly.The first thing she did was not to respond to Morg\u2019s magic or Baskerville\u2019s sword, but to kick up sand to extinguish the campfire.Once the faint glow was gone, Balak\u2019s hunting birds made their move.They mounted the wolves\u2019 backs, firing arrows as they retreated deeper into the water.\u201cThey\u2019re fleeing. Don\u2019t leave a single one alive!\u201dStaffordshire shouted to the Baskervilles\u2019 hounds, spurring them on in pursuit.And through the infernal darkness, a shadow approached the camo.Vikir. In a flash, he cut the rope and noose from the stake and freed the camel.The camel, still paralyzed by the paralyzing poison, recognized Vikir\u2019s face.\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026\u2026! It\u2019s you!\u201d\u201cShhh.\u201dIn the blink of an eye, Vikir had the camel in his arms and was falling backwards.No. He tried to pull away.If it weren\u2019t for the silver shadow that appeared out of nowhere.\u201cI knew you\u2019d come, \u2018boy with the sword\u2019.\u201dAiyen was facing Vikir squarely.Her eyes scanned Vikir\u2019s entire body as she spoke.\u201cA strong body to cover such a distance in such a short time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cA strong mind to see through the darkness of the water.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe hot innocence to risk his life to save the woman he loves.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dVikir frowned.Why did he have to listen to this barbarian woman\u2019s assessment of him right now?Vikir was just about to dodge past her to the rear.Aiyen points a finger at the camel in Vikir\u2019s arms.\u201cI will not ask about the past.\u201dThe corners of her mouth curved in a gentle arc.\u201cPass.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How did you stop it!?\u201dAn exclamation of horror echoes across the water.Ahun, hiding beneath the roots of a tree, was panicking, his mouth clamped shut.Vikir debated whether or not to fight back, then withdrew his aura.All that mattered now was getting the camel in his arms to safety, and by extension, erasing his massive debt to the Morgas.\u201cJust be patient, I\u2019ll take you to your uncle soon enough\u2026\u2026?\u201dBut Vikir did not finish his sentence.The camel in his arms was looking up into his face with a blank expression.His complexion was flushed and he was out of breath. His heart was beating too fast.\u201cHas it been poisoned with something other than paralyzing venom?Vikir asked the camel, sensing something was wrong.\u201cPoisoned?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I think so.\u201dIf so, this is bad news.Vikir hurriedly retreated.Aiyen drew his bow with lightning speed, but he couldn\u2019t catch Vikir as he darted backward.Whirligig-!The rope snares fly again.The female warriors of Balak have been relentless in their pursuit of Vikir.But.Kiririk-grrrr!Vikir, too, has unleashed his auras, slicing through the lassos.With so many eyes on him, he was only able to display the swordsmanship and aura of a lower level Gradient, but that was enough to overwhelm the common warriors of Balak.But.Ping-ping!Aiyen\u2019s arrows were so powerful that even Vikir had to be careful.The good news is that Aiyen\u2019s arrows are deflected by Vikir\u2019s rapid fire.Arrows aimed precisely at Vikir\u2019s legs, and the occasional noose flying by.Add to that the fact that Vikir is carrying a camel in his arms, and you\u2019ve got a recipe for trouble.Meanwhile, the camel clutches at the hem of Vikir\u2019s robe in a show of understanding.\u201c\u2026\u2026Ugh, I never thought I\u2019d be an embarrassing heroine who only grabs ankles.\u201d\u201cHeroine, you\u2019re so self-conscious.\u201dVikir scooped the camel up and kept falling backwards.Just then.Quack, quack, quack!A loud explosion puts a giant wall of ice between Balak\u2019s warriors and Vikir.Suddenly, a massive wall of ice surrounded them, trapping them all.Morg Adolf.Morg is a delegate to the Mage Council, leading the great party known as the Ming Party.One of the highest ranking members of the Imperial Magisterium.His power, looking beyond the sixth class to the seventh, was unbridled.\u201cStand down, nephew.\u201dHe drew a number line in the air, calculating complex formulas.The volume of ice, the specific gravity of ice, the latent heat of melting ice, the amount of mana remaining, and the fatigue of magic tools are multiplied and divided.And the results are frightening.Boom, boom, boom!The entire sea of water began to freeze.As if an ice age had come, hail and snowflakes scattered through the air, and the ankles of those fleeing were frozen to the ground.Balak\u2019s barbarian warriors and their wolves were hardy, so their frozen legs would not be cut off.But there was nothing to be done about being pinned to the ground.\u201cBite them all to death.\u201dBaskerville\u2019s hounds\u2019 teeth sank into the defenseless Balak warriors.Morg\u2019s wizards joined in, and screams began to erupt from everywhere.By then, Adolf had taken the camo from Vikir.\u201cMy nephew, are you all right?\u201dAdolf called out anxiously to the camel, who was still covered in Vikir\u2019s blood.At the same time, detoxification magic appeared.\u2026Pow!CURE POISON.It was a very high class magic, and not just anyone could use it.Adolf succeeded in removing some of the paralyzing poison from the camel\u2019s body.\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of paralyzing poison, and it\u2019s going to be hard to get it all out. You\u2019re going to have to lie down for a few months, and when we get back, we\u2019ll start by visiting the Holy House of Quavadis.\u201dEven Adolph\u2019s strength could not remove the poison.Afterward, the camel recovered from the paralyzing poison and leapt to his feet.And then?\u2026boom!He rushed to his less paralyzed leg and hugged Vikir around the neck.\u201cYou saved me again!\u201dAdolf\u2019s expression behind him turned to one of frustration and sullenness.\u201cNephew, here\u2019s your uncle.\u201d\u201cWhy is my uncle here now, I\u2019m going to tell my mom everything!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAt this, Adolf grew even more sullen.At that moment, Vikir pushed the camo away from him and spoke to Adolf.\u201cMy lord. It seems that the camouflage is poisoned with other poisons as well. From what I heard earlier\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHmm? I don\u2019t recall any other poison besides the paralyzing one?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dWhat? I thought it was clear earlier\u2026\u2026.But not if it\u2019s not Adolf.Vikir was just about to turn to look at the camo.Charalak!Another rope lasso flew in.This one wasn\u2019t like the last one.It was much more sophisticated, with a strange, writhing motion. It was like watching a live snake.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dVikir frowned, striking the noose with the back of his sword.Aiyen. Holding the end of the noose, she glared at him with a determined expression.Not at Vikir, to be precise, but at the camo.\u201cYou\u2019d better be caught quietly, we\u2019re running out of time.\u201dSlurred Imperial, Vikir thought, puzzled.\u201cNo time?What does this mean?

Don\u2019t make a sound.\u201dVikir placed his hand over the camel\u2019s lips in his arms and whispered in its ear.\u201cYou may not be able to see very well, but you have sensitive ears and skin, old man.\u201dLight and sound. He\u2019s sensitive to them.Jahak\u2026\u2026 Jaharak\u2026\u2026Beyond the tangled skeins of roots in the floodwaters, a noise sounded otherworldly.It sounded like the uncomfortable groan of an old man, or the last gasp of a drowning man in a swamp.Rustling, rustling, rustling.Soon there was the sound of bristly, dense fur being swept everywhere.From the sound of it, the thing that was now approaching must be of immense size.Even the mighty Morg Adolph was at a loss as to what species this creature lurking in the darkness belonged to.\u201cIt must be a new creature that hasn\u2019t been seen before, but how could such a monster be undiscovered?\u201dAdolf\u2019s questions were legitimate.But Vikir, who knew how large and vast the enemy and the Black Mountain\u2019s waters were, had nothing to say.He merely recited the information from his pre-reversion knowledge, information that had been refined and perfected over the course of several more editions, even in the version Adolph now knew.\u201cMadame Eight-Legged. An annihilation-level demon. One that will grow into an even more terrifying monster in the next decade.Risk Level S.Dangerous enough that a single entity is capable of destroying a nation.If we were to fight it head-on, we would have no chance.Even here, in its home base of Suhai, it\u2019s not even at night!\u2026Gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp.Something sticky is dripping down from above, onto the leaves, fallen branches, and human heads.The drops of slime falling simultaneously from various locations created the illusion of drizzling rain.\u2026\u2026.Static.Perfect static.There hadn\u2019t been a sound of a grasshopper in the water since before.And now this.The veteran swordsmen of Baskerville, the seasoned wizards of Morg, and the fierce barbarian warriors of Balak had all been reduced to nothing more than grasshoppers.All were frozen in place, unable to breathe.Praying that the great nightmare in the sky would pass quickly.Just then.\u201cKaaaaaah!\u201dA tearing scream came from the air.Vikir turned his head quickly.There, standing there, was Camu, his eyes narrowed in horror.\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2026\u2026, is it?\u201dShe made an X with her hands as if to say, \u201cNo more embarrassment.Vikir breathes a sigh of relief.It\u2019s Ahun of Balak who\u2019s letting out a new scream.\u201cMy, my head! Madame\u2019s poison!\u201dAhun was running around, shaking out his hair.Was it because he quickly cut it off with a knife?Tsutsutsutsuts\u2026\u2026On the ground, Ahun\u2019s hair is melting away.But dodging the onrushing water didn\u2019t save him from the tsunami that followed.\u201cIt\u201d began to respond to his screams.A thick darkness descended upon the Balak warriors.Aiyen quickly grabbed Ahun by the back of the neck and ran.\u201cYou fool! If you weren\u2019t the eldest son of a shaman, I\u2019d be all over you!\u201dAhun cowered, unable to utter a word as Iyen growled.Soon, Balak\u2019s warriors began to scatter, spreading out across the water.\u201cLet us run!\u201dAt Adolf\u2019s words, Morg and Baskerville\u2019s pursuers retreated.But there was a slight difference in the way the Balak, Morg, and Baskerville alliance retreated.Balak\u2019s warriors fled individually, with none of them running in the same direction.The Morg and Baskervilles, on the other hand, fled in unison.This slight difference helped determine the \u201cit\u201d factor.Passasasak-The sound of blade-like leaves bending so easily.A huge pile of fur was breaking through the dense foliage and thorns, heading this way.\u2026\u2026 into the room at breakneck speed!Puck! Thump! Thump\u2026Dull noises came from all directions.It was the sound of swordsmen and mages being crushed by an unidentified attack.\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201dAdolph exclaimed as he ran, scooping up his camel.Staffordshire, too, runs forward, carrying the Baskerville triplets in his arms.The triplets, who had just been knocked out by an unknown attacker, were bleeding from the corners of their mouths, their eyes wide open and glaring at the \u201cit\u201d behind them.Just then.\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201dVikir paused.At this rate, we\u2019re all going to die.Whirr-Vikir spins around in his seat.Camu sees him and cries out.\u201cRain, Vikir! What!\u201dShe gasps in surprise.Facing the camel, Vikir doesn\u2019t turn around, but waves his hand briefly.\u201cLet me buy you some time.\u201d\u201cIt\u201d is not an opponent that can be fought by hiding its power.And this crisis was an opportunity, a golden moment to legally slip off Hugo\u2019s radar.Vikir instinctively sensed that the time had come to realize a plan he had long thought of.Death. And camouflage.Once a hound in the field is dead, all surveillance and control over it ceases.In his mind, he had already memorized the theories of the Baskerville Tenth Sword Art. His mana and aura are slowly recovering to the level of his previous life.All she needs is time. A place away from prying eyes.This is the perfect place to hide and improve, so that when the time is right, she can leave and return to her family.\u201cNo! Vikir, please come back!\u201dThe camel cries out.Vikir turns his back on the plaintive cry.In the distant future, when he is no match for Hugo, or at least when he is able to hide and control his skills perfectly, he will return to his family and perhaps be treated as a hero.At least he could claim to have sacrificed himself for the sake of Morg\u2019s feast.Vikir straightened his posture.\u201cDo your best, or die.He had no intention of giving it his all against an opponent who would likely die anyway.It was just a matter of how much she could produce.Vikir stood in front of \u2018It\u2019 in an almost sacrificial manner.\u2018If we go on like this, we\u2019ll all die,\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll stop it for a while, so everyone run away,\u2019 \u2018Tell my family that I was brave at the end,\u2019 \u2026\u2026 and other lines that Vikir didn\u2019t bother to say.They must have gotten through without me.\u201c\u2026\u2026Nephew.\u201dAdolph bit his lip, a grim expression on his face.He bites his lip so tightly that it bleeds from the corner of his mouth, but he must return to his family as soon as possible to save his poisoned niece.\u201cMaster \u2026\u2026.\u201dStaffordshire, also carrying the injured triplets, looked back at Vikir with trembling eyes.Finally, Camus.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dShe stretched out her hands toward Vikir, her face covered in tears and snot, her expression now speechless, her throat hoarse from exhaustion.Only to be blocked from moving forward by Adolf\u2019s strong forearm.\u201cGo.\u201dVikir turned his back on everyone and drew his sword.Then.\u201cDo not let my niece\u2019s sacrifice be in vain!\u201dAdolf cried out, spitting up blood.With that, the survivors of the Morgans and Baskervilles began to run away from \u2018it\u2019.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir watched them all move away.And with that.Passa Passa Passa.The fast-approaching \u2018thing\u2019 broke through the darkness and leaned forward toward Vikir.At the same time.Vikir unleashes all the power he\u2019s been holding back.Mana, fed by the waters of the River Styx.An aura made even more refined by his newfound mastery of Baskerville-style High Swordsmanship.In addition, the rare magic sword Beelzebub pierced my wrist, revealing long teeth.\u2026Puff-puff-puff!A pitch-black aura, red as blood and dark as the abyss, began to rampage like a demon from Beelzebub\u2019s tip.It quickly formed five gigantic teeth and clamped down on \u2018it\u2019.Jaaaahhhhh!The monster let out a startled yell. A scream, tight with pain.Quack, quack, quack!There was a flash of light like a giant sun falling.Vikir\u2019s aura surged with power, forcing dawn into the dark waters.He didn\u2019t see Adolf and Staffordshire, who were concentrating on running forward, but\u2026\u2026 Camus and the triplets, who were being carried by them and looking backward, saw through the exploding beam of light.\u2026Flash!Vikir\u2019s ridiculous power exploding the aura of a Gradual Intermediate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A few wooden supports were the only poles, and the floor was littered with dried leaves.Rustle.A glass vial of some sort was lying in a circle beside him, and upon closer inspection, he realized it was a potion bottle with the sigil of the Baskervilles.The smell of dry earth, fallen leaves, animal fur, and stewing potions mingled in the tent.Vikir crawled like a dog out of the tent.Her whole body burned with each step, but she needed to get a sense of her surroundings.Soon, the landscape outside the tent came into view.Large and small tents made of leather, drums beating everywhere, flames leaping from high piles of wood.A large number of barbarians moved among them.Black or silver hair, brown skin, and well toned muscles in both men and women.Tops made of deer or jaguar skins, bottoms of cloth dyed with acorn juice.Tattooed and scarred, they dismembered the carcass of a demon and skinned its flesh, while children played with birds.The atmosphere was cheerful and lively, but raw, unrefined and unprocessed.Vikir knew instinctively that this was the home of the Balak, a barbarian tribe.In the heart of enemy territory, longtime enemies of the Baskervilles.He should be on his guard, but he was too weak to do so now.Vikir wondered what to do next.Balak\u2019s warriors walked past him, paying him no mind as he stood there alone.The women and children stiffened a little and seemed wary, but that was it.Just then.\u201cQuick, quick, quick, walk!\u201dA nervous shout came from somewhere.Vikir turned his head to see several barbarian warriors dragging rope-bound prisoners.The prisoners, standing in a line and staggering, were of various races.Most were black-haired, brown-skinned men of other tribes.Every single one of them had been tortured and abused in some way.Vikir recognized a few familiar faces among them.Warriors whose names he did not recognize, but who were surely members of House Baskerville and House Morg.Some he\u2019d met in the fortress, others he\u2019d traveled with to this jungle.Their entire bodies hung like fish from ropes, their eyes locked for the briefest of moments with Vikir, who wore only a single dog collar around his neck.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAnd then they walked past each other.Vikir stood silent, watching them.Then the Balak warriors stabbed their captives with the tips of their spears.\u201cClimb up quickly. Unless you want to be mauled to death by wolves.\u201dThey led their captives to a tall tree.It was an impossibly tall pole, covered in thorns that jutted out like blades.Balak\u2019s barbarians forced their captives to climb this bladed tree with their bare bodies.The captives climb this tower of blades until they are covered in blood.If anyone refused to climb, the barbarians would set fire to the base of the tree.The tree was oiled on the trunk, so the flames continued to climb up the tree, faster than most prisoners could climb a tree.Eventually, the prisoners would either bleed to death from being stabbed and cut by the blade-like trunks, burned by the flames from below, or plummet to their deaths on the ground below.Thump, thump, thump!Below the tree, the wolves were howling, pushing their captives up the tree.Some had been impaled by spears or bitten by wolves for refusing to climb the tree of blades.The horrific \u201cTree of Thorns Punishment\u201d was devised by an old Balak shaman.Vikir could only watch this hellish execution.Then.\u201cHoo-hoo, be thankful you don\u2019t look like that.\u201dSomeone says to Vikir.Ahun. It was the barbarian warrior who had shot the camel with the tranquilizer needle the other day.He was giving Vikir a murderous glare, as if he wanted to kill him right now.\u201cIf you weren\u2019t the captain\u2019s pet, I would have boiled you right there.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t just stand there, go find your master!\u201dAhun kicked Vikir hard on the butt with his foot.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir fell to the ground and stared at Ahun.Ahun flinched slightly at the stare.\u201cWhat kind of eyes\u2026\u2026.There was not an ounce of agitation in those serene eyes.Not the horrific deaths of his captives, not the pain of his battered body.Ahun felt a shiver run down his spine as he realized that none of it had stirred Vikir\u2019s soul.Slowly, Vikir rose from his seat and began to follow the rope around his neck.Ahun could only follow behind, unable to keep up with Vikir.* * *\u2018\u2026\u2026The guy from earlier. You said his name was Ahun, didn\u2019t you?\u2019He probably holds a grudge because he hurt his back falling off the wolf\u2019s back the other day.Vikir hadn\u2019t forgotten the face of the man who had just kicked his ass.But he couldn\u2019t do anything about it in his current state, so he\u2019d just have to put up with it for now.Even now, the protection of the Styx River and the regenerative powers of Murcielago are slowly restoring Vikir\u2019s body to its former glory.In the meantime, Vikir has decided to visit the owner of the noose that saved his life.After walking for a while, tugging at the rope around his neck, Vikir finds himself in a remote area far from the village.A small spring fed a pool with a waterfall cascading down through the rocks.A few crayfish could be seen crawling in the clear water.A rope led to it.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dVikir stopped walking for a moment.He\u2019s not sure what to do when he sees that the rope he\u2019s been following leads to the center of the pool and goes under the water.Just then.Boom!There\u2019s a splash and a figure pokes its head out of the water.Water droplets splashing around, hair a mix of silver and black, pointed triangular ears.A girl with brown skin and big eyes walked out of the water, naked.The end of the noose\u2019s rope was tied tightly around her wrists.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir looked straight into the barbarian girl\u2019s face.Dark, half-moon eyebrows, foxlike slant, eyes as clear as the puddle he was in now, red lips on an intelligent nose.The charcoal-black color of his face was gone, but the look in his eyes was unmistakable.She was the barbarian girl I\u2019d met at an illegal slave auction during the cleanup of Underdog City.They were diametrically opposed then. Vikir held her eyes steady.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dA brief silence followed.It was the barbarian girl who broke it first.She tugged at the leash around Vikir\u2019s neck and grinned.\u201cGet down.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We will repay your favor twice and your vengeance tenfold.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou saved me once, so I will save you twice.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI never thought you\u2019d try to fight \u2018her\u2019, I ran away and came back just in case.\u201dCertainly, Vikir would have been killed by Madame Eight-Legged, the Dark One, if the rope Aiyen had thrown hadn\u2019t been caught around his neck in time to pull him back.\u2026\u2026So what is the other time?When Vikir looked at him as if demanding an explanation, the corners of Aiyen\u2019s eyes drew a fox-like arc.\u201cDid you not see it on the way here?\u201dShe pointed beyond the bushes to the acrid column of smoke rising from the village.Vikir thought of the prisoners he\u2019d met along the way.Perhaps she would share a similar fate.Perhaps it was the Aiyen in front of him who had prevented it.If so, that raised a more fundamental question.\u201cWhy did you save me?\u201dWas it simply to repay a favor? If so, there would be no reason for him to throw the noose around his neck in the first place.And Aiyen was not the only one who wanted to put a noose around Vikir\u2019s neck.Every female warrior in Balak that day had her sights set on Vikir\u2019s neck.As Aiyen sliced into the pizza, Vikir asked her bluntly.\u201cIs this some kind of husband hunt or something?\u201d\u201cOh, you must have heard about it somewhere.\u201dIt\u2019s not just the Balak, most savages in the jungle kidnap their spouses from outside the tribe.The idea is to avoid incest and bring in fresh blood.The Balak, of course, are a warrior tribe, so the physical strength of the abductee is a big factor.Aiyen circled around Vikir once.Like an appraiser evaluating a piece of merchandise.In the meantime, Vikir had been thinking a lot.What if they told the Baskervilles that they were alive, and they negotiated a hostage?That would put a damper on their plans.Their plan to stay off Hugo\u2019s radar and build up their strength would be ruined.In order to stop it, you have to escape this place or annihilate all of them\u2026 \u2026 That was impossible with Vikir\u2019s current physical conditionBut Vikir had worried for nothing.They didn\u2019t seem to have any intention of interfering with him.Aiyen glanced at Vikir and said.\u201cDon\u2019t be mistaken. I am not like the other women. I don\u2019t need a husband.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou have been captured to be used as a slave.\u201dShe wondered, but didn\u2019t say it out loud, if it had been necessary to throw the noose so desperately.When Vikir remained still, Aiyen waved the dog collar in his hand.\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to pass for a man with that body anyway, so you might as well get used to life as a slave.\u201dBy nature, Balak women see nothing but breeding in the men they capture from the outside world.If the man fails to fulfill his role as a male, they usually kill him, but fortunately (?) Aiyen doesn\u2019t seem to have the sense to do so.Aiyen tossed his clothes to Vikir at the water\u2019s edge.Vikir catches it, and the collar pulls taut.Aiyen led the way back to the village.\u201cYou will live in front of my house and serve me.\u201dVikir\u2019s entire body screamed with each step, but he kept his mouth shut nonetheless.The good news is that his body is recovering quickly, thanks to the power of Murcielago.To Vikir, Aiyen gave his first order, briefly.\u201cLet\u2019s get our formalities straightened out.\u201dWalking ahead, Aiyen paused at the entrance to the clan and looked back at Vikir.He looked down and narrowed his eyes.\u201cCall me master.\u201d* * * https://pindangscans.comVikir descended again into the village of the Balak.They lived freely in the dense jungle.The concept of personal property seemed remote.If you didn\u2019t have a place to sleep, you slept in a neighbor\u2019s tent, and no one minded.If they were hungry, they ate from people who had plenty of food, and they were happy to share.There seemed to be a shared consciousness that everything comes and goes, so let\u2019s share while we have it.They gathered at a friend\u2019s house with a large tent, played cheerfully, and fell asleep.Firewood, meat, and alcohol were shared generously, and there was no yamcha.Even if they had been kidnapped from the outside, once they were recognized as members of the tribe, they could go anywhere and come anywhere.Overall, a lively and welcoming atmosphere.But the skeletons of captives hanging from the thorn trees at the tribe\u2019s boundary conveyed a different message.This is Balak\u2019s clan, a land that is unforgiving to outsiders but endlessly friendly and free to residents.\u2026\u2026 But within the clan, there is a \u201cdignified zone\u201d where even insiders are not allowed to roam.Vikir\u2019s destination was one of those few places.A large tent in the center of the village.It looked like it could hold up to two dozen people, but even the children playing in front of it were not allowed to approach.Passing warriors always bowed their heads in reverence toward the entrance of this tent.Those grilling meat were careful to keep the smoke from wafting in this direction, and those preparing the entrails of their prey were careful to keep the scent of blood from drifting away.\u201c\u2018\u2026\u2026 Is this the chieftain\u2019s house?Vikir guessed from the size of the tent.Aiyen grabbed the leash around Vikir\u2019s neck and strode inside.\u201cMother.\u201dVikir could see the figure Aiyen sought.Inside the tent, there was a chair with a large eagle carved into it, and a woman sitting cross-legged, reclining at an angle.A grim expression, scars ovipositing all over her body.She wears a cloak and bottoms made of eagle feathers, and a long, large bow rests on a sceptre behind her back.She wore a cloak of eagle feathers, with a long, large bow on her back.Aquila, the current matriarch of the Balak.Vikir knelt silently before her, drawn by Aiyen\u2019s touch.Vikir had already realized that the chieftainess\u2019 real name was Night Fox, as she exuded a heavy presence before him.The woman who had scarred the bridge of Heavenly Sword Saint Hugo\u2019s nose.Even Adolf the Mad had been defeated by her, and had spent some time in the service.Her presence was the reason why Baskerville and the Morg were unable to cross the border between the enemy and the Black Mountain.After all, she had killed 16 Gradient-class swordsmen, 10 fourth-class mages, and 6 fifth-class mages in her short life.All without a single wound!She was also the one who had left arrowhead marks on the faces of her enemies and the Black Mountain Demon Cerberus.\u201cWhat if it was before the regression?If I had been able to unleash the power of my prime, could I have faced this woman?\u2018I would have had a 0% chance in a hand-to-hand fight, a 0% chance by assassination, and a\u2026\u2026 20% chance by running away.\u2019That 20%, of course, is the chance of survival.Vikir\u2019s mind raced as he tried to gauge the woman in front of him.After all, she was up against a Hugo or an Adolf, a top predator that she was no match for right now.Meanwhile, Aquila glared down at Vikir in front of her.\u201cDaughter, is this the Imperial male you\u2019ve been drooling over?\u201d\u201cNo, when did I ever say that much\u2026\u2026 but yes, he is.\u201d\u201cHmm. He\u2019s younger than you, and I recognize his face.\u201dAquila stared at Vikir with narrowed eyes.The gaze was like that of a top predator from a vastly elevated position, scanning the lesser prey below.All Vikir could do was keep his head down and avoid her gaze as much as possible.Fortunately, Aquila didn\u2019t see any sign of Hugo on Vikir.Hugo had strong lines, a square jaw, and a masculine appearance, while Vikir took on more of his mother\u2019s features.Apart from that though, Aquila seemed to have a pretty good idea of Vikir\u2019s physical condition.\u201cI see. What are you doing picking up a wasted man?\u201d\u201cIf you treat him well, he\u2019ll be worth it. He\u2019s the one who jumped on Madame Eightlegs.\u201d\u201cHmph. Yes, but rampaging without knowing your place will only get you in trouble.\u201dAquila said.\u201cSure. It doesn\u2019t matter if the body is broken or not, as long as the seeds are intact\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAah! Mother, that\u2019s not it, he\u2019s going to be used as a slave!\u201d\u201cWhat? But isn\u2019t that the purpose you\u2019ve been telling me all along\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhoa, that\u2019s what it was originally intended for, a slave, I need one to help me hunt!\u201dAiyen quickly waved her hand to stop Aquila\u2019s words.Aquila looked at her daughter with a puzzled expression, then nodded.\u201c\u2026\u2026Well, so be it. It is your freedom to use your slave for whatever purpose you choose.\u201dAs soon as the words were out of her mouth, Aiyen bowed her head and tugged on Vikir\u2019s leash.Once outside the tent, Aiyen\u2019s expression was much stiffer than before.The flustered look on his face before his mother was gone.\u201cFrom now on, I will give you a mission.\u201dAiyen looked down at Vikir, who was only one head shorter than her, and spoke in a high-pitched voice.\u201cIt will be difficult.\u201d\u2026\u2026A pretty tough mission, indeed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The way it is, the ground beneath the center pole of the tent could shake and leak water during the next rainy season. If you give me the order, I will mix the limestone soil down there with stone dust from the hill across the street, make bricks, oil them, bake them, and reinforce them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes, do that. I was just thinking of that myself.\u201dAiyen scratched his head.Vikir had indeed done so.Moving on his limp legs, he scooped up white dirt from the hills behind him and flew in stones from the hill opposite, cracking and breaking them to mix into the soil.Then he added water to make a dough, shaped it into a rectangle, baked it over a fire, and dried the bricks with hyena oil.The bricks were then used to form the base of the tent, making it even stronger.Even Aquila, who was initially annoyed at the extra work, was pleased with the results.\u201cThe ceiling won\u2019t leak anymore. It was annoying that no matter how many leaves or hides I put on the ceiling, it would still leak, but it must have been the foundation.\u201dAquila still didn\u2019t pay much attention to Vikir.He merely ordered him to make his usual rounds around the chieftain\u2019s barracks, observing, maintaining, and repairing the shabby things.Aiyen was unhappy that his slave should spend most of his time maintaining the chieftain\u2019s barracks, but he didn\u2019t protest.He just kept whimpering behind him as Vikir dug drainage ditches around Aquila\u2019s barracks and set up gutters to keep leaves and dirt from piling up on top.\u201cHey, man. Are you okay working alone?\u201dI\u2019d say, and then do some nervous shuffling.\u201cSo, are we gonna do it alone or in a group?\u201dwhich is usually followed by a few unintelligible words.\u201cHmmmm, do you enjoy your job? You\u2019ve been working all day.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the rainy season, you\u2019re already digging gutters.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have this at home, do you? Eat it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 The owner is talking to you, why don\u2019t you answer him?\u201dVikir had been steadily ignoring him as a distraction from his work, but Aiyen continued to hover around him, disappearing for a moment and then reappearing.At this point, it was hard to tell who was master and who was slave.\u2026Puck! \u2026Puck! \u2026Puck! Thud!With lye and a bat, Vikir finished his laundry.He\u2019d been a Pathfinder, a herbalist, a healer, a cook, an assassin, a cleaner, a laundress, a cook, and everything in between from the youngest crawler in the field to a seasoned veteran, and his experience was coming in handy here.\u2018I know I keep using the Age of Destruction excuse, but\u2026\u2026 it was just as fierce.\u2019Bikir took a moment to reminisce about the old days while doing laundry.\u201c\u2026\u2026Khhhh. Hmmm, hmmm.\u201dBeside him, Aiyen, who had stepped forward to give a demonstration, hid her torn leather skirt behind her back as she watched.* * * https://pindangscans.com\u2026\u2026 Meanwhile.Vikir, whose experience of surviving the Age of Destruction has made him good at keeping to himself.But even he, who was quite content with a day in the life of a slave, much more so than he would have been in Baskerville or Underdog City, had one opponent who might be a little embarrassed.\u201cUh, cool.\u201dHer name was Aiyen, princess of the barbarian tribe of Balak.She was peeing in the drainage channel Vikir had dug earlier.\u201cI\u2019ve been holding it in for a long time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cUgh, master, are we supposed to watch you pee like that?\u201dAiyen was peeing with his legs open, right next to where Vikir was working.Vikir was dumbfounded and asked.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cMarking the territory. This is my slave\u2019s house, so it\u2019s also mine.\u201d\u201d \u2026\u2026 doesn\u2019t cover it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s any shame in open excretion. There is no such thing in my tribe.\u201dAiyen lifted her skirt further, as if to show him.Vikir covered her face with her hands and turned away.He remembered seeing a research paper on barbarian tribes once.\u201cThe barbarian tribes of the Red and Black Mountains practice free sexual intercourse among their members. Both men and women have no qualms about exposing their sexual organs to each other, as they must first know if the other person is capable of reproduction and does not carry a sexually transmitted disease before engaging in a relationship.\u201d\u2018Did I mention \u2026\u2026?It was a real thing and a culture with its own reasons, so Vikir tried not to be prejudiced.\u201cBut don\u2019t be cheap, at least around the house.\u201d\u201cWhy, didn\u2019t your empire just throw feces out the window a few hundred years ago, and you wore these things called high heels because the streets were covered in filth, and you sprayed yourself with perfume.\u201dIt was true enough.Vikir didn\u2019t know what else to say, so he kept his mouth shut.As they chatted, the chores were completed.Balak was a very laid-back place when he wasn\u2019t fighting or hunting, and the ever-diligent Vikir couldn\u2019t help but think that life as a slave here was much more comfortable than it would have been in Baskerville or Underdog City, where he had to combine training and work.Aiyen, however, had a strange look on her face.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you want to officially become a member of our tribe as soon as possible?\u201dWhat was he talking about?Vikir frowned, and Aiyen scooted closer to him and sat down.She was still spreading her legs wide enough that he could see through her skirt, so Vikir kept his gaze fixed upward.Aiyen said.\u201cNot bad for a slave, huh?\u201d\u201cNot bad.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re getting a good education in speech, I suppose, though I dare not complain from a slave\u2019s point of view.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026No, it really isn\u2019t that bad.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be bad, for all the hard, dirty work.\u201dAiyen waved her hand in the air, not even wanting to think about cleaning or doing laundry.\u201c\u2018Come on. Come with me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cI will help you. To help you fit in with this tribe.\u201dThere\u2019s no refusal when you\u2019re already enslaved.Aiyen patted the leash still around Vikir\u2019s neck.\u201cIf you\u2019re good, I\u2019ll take this off too.\u201dThe offer is a bit tempting.As if I wasn\u2019t already annoyed by this irritating rope at the corner of my neck.\u201c\u2026\u2026What can I do?\u201dVikir asks, and Aiyen answers with a twinkle in his eye.\u201cHunting.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026hunt?\u201d\u201cThe big one.\u201dApparently, you go hunting and catch big prey.The Hagiya, or Balak, are a tribe that accumulates food primarily through hunting.To feed their nearly 300 members evenly, they need to consume a boar weighing over 200 kilograms a day.That\u2019s if they\u2019re able to supplement it with mushrooms, berries, and edible roots.In recent years, he says, warriors in his tribe have been eating nothing but mushrooms and berries for days at a time because they haven\u2019t been able to find enough meat.\u201cIn times like these, if we can bring back a large chunk of meat, your freedom is not out of the question.\u201dAiyen\u2019s words gave Vikir a strange look.It was a bit ironic to hear the word \u201cfreedom\u201d from a barbarian.But it wasn\u2019t a bad offer.\u201cAll you have to do is assist me. Apparently you don\u2019t have much trouble getting around or carrying light loads.\u201dAiyen said with a gleam in her eye.It was impossible to tell if her intentions were truly to take down the big game, or if that was all she wanted.\u201cAlright. Let\u2019s go.\u201dBut Vikir decided to go along with Aiyen\u2019s suggestion for now.As a slave, he had no other choice.Vikir nodded, and Aiyen spoke immediately.\u201cWe will leave at dawn today.\u201d\u201cI see, but why were you laughing so hard earlier?\u201d\u201cWhat? When did I laugh?\u201dAiyen laughs self-consciously, but when he hears Vikir\u2019s words, he turns serious.\u2026\u2026Something about his attitude was a little suspicious.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 56": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Return of the Iron-blood Sword HoundCH 55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 55 The Hunter and the Hunted (2)The Balak are a very warlike people by nature.It was clear that if you took war and hunting out of their lives, there probably wouldn\u2019t be much left.As Vikir followed Iyen to the entrance of the clan, he reviewed what he knew about the Balak.\u2018Their language has only about three hundred words, and most of them are nouns. Verbs are gestural, and there is no distinction between them and us when it comes to possession. Men are ambo, women are akouati, love is aauki, death is utika\u2026\u2026\u2019The people of Balak viewed the empires as rude, devious, and pretentious.Conversely, the Imperials viewed the Balak as savages who shouted and punched at the slightest hint of anger.The people of Baskerville seemed to be somewhere in the middle, Vikir thought, between the civilized people of the Empire and the savages of the jungle.\u201cI wonder if they\u2019re vaguely resembling both sides of the border, never fully belonging to either.As Vikir pondered this to himself, the hunters of Balak gathered in a circle.Hunters, young and old, gathered in groups of three and four.Several mounted on the backs of wolves, bows and spears dangling.Only Aiyen had no companions, just a wolf to ride and his slave, Vikir.\u201cGather round, hunters, it\u2019s time for the ceremony.\u201dA gnarled old man came forward with a bowl of black charcoal, which he smeared on the faces of the hunter-warriors.A series of tattoos peeked out from beneath his black robes, suggesting he might be a shaman.\u201cGo, all of you, with my blessing, or I will strike you down.\u201dThe old shaman dipped a bowl of tan into the bowl and smeared it over the faces of all the hunters.The hunters of Balak feel guilty about killing their prey.So they smeared their faces with tar before killing, so as not to show their faces to the God of Death.But the younger hunters, including Aiyen, don\u2019t seem to appreciate the ritual.\u201cThere you go again, that pesky nag.\u201d\u201cLeave him alone. The shaman needs to make his mark.\u201d\u201cBy the way, aren\u2019t your fortune-telling skills a little off?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why all they do nowadays are earrings for ears and nose rings for noses.\u201dAll young people, regardless of time and place, dislike and despise old customs and superstitions.With a look of annoyance, Ai Yen stuck out her face and accepted the old shaman\u2019s charcoal-black makeup.The old shaman rubbed the black paint on Aiyen\u2019s face a few times before moving on, which was quite sloppy compared to what he did for the other warriors, and it was clear that he didn\u2019t like her.Next, Aiyen slipped the spiked collar around his neck and handed it to Vikir.\u201cI wear it to keep them from biting my neck.\u201dVikir nodded.One by one, the hunters began to leave the village.Knives sheathed, spears drawn, bows drawn, wolves herded, the tribe\u2019s hunters departed.Vikir, the slave, had made his own preparations.\u201cWhile I\u2019m here, I\u2019ll have to blend in with them.He needed to renew his mindset.Vikir finally felt the urge and pulled down his pants to urinate.He was going to start with something as basic as this and blend into the culture.\u2026\u2026So?When the people of Balak saw Vikir urinating, they began to freak out.The women covered their eyes and watched through their spread fingers, while the men gave him openly competitive glances.Vikir was puzzled and asked.\u201cWhat\u2019s with all the stares? Isn\u2019t everyone doing this?\u201dAnswers came from all over the place.\u201c\u2026\u2026What are you talking about, who urinates in the middle of nowhere like that?\u201d\u201cIs that how they do it in the Empire? That\u2019s barbaric.\u201d\u201cWe use separate restrooms.\u201d\u201cMen over there, women over here.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so ignorant, you should cover up.\u201d\u201cHow barbaric!\u201d\u201cWhat about me?\u201d\u2026\u2026.Vikir turned his head to look at Aiyen.Aiyen smirked, then quickly averted her gaze.* * *Aiyen climbed onto the wolf\u2019s back.\u201cHold on tight.\u201dOn her back, of course, was Vikir.Vikir hesitated for a moment, unsure of where to hold on, then squeezed the wolf\u2019s fur.Then Aiyen reached back and yanked Vikir\u2019s arm out of his grasp, bringing it around her waist.\u201cYou have to hold on here. Tight. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll fall and break your neck.\u201dVikir grasped Aiyen\u2019s pelvis with his hands. It was certainly wide enough to be comfortable to hold.But.\u2026Boom!The wolf took a single leap, and Vikir was sent tumbling to the ground.In agony, Vikir almost screamed.His bones, barely held together by Murcielago\u2019s regenerative powers, twisted again.Riding a wolf was quite different from riding a horse.For one thing, there was no saddle and no stirrups.Furthermore, wolves had a much narrower waist than horses, and they moved more dynamically.Aiyen stopped the wolf and lowered himself to the ground.\u201cTsk, tsk, you should have wrapped your arms around his waist like that and held him with both hands. He\u2019ll fall off if you hold him that gently.\u201dShe smirked and patted her own waist, as if to say, \u201cHow am I supposed to vent without you holding it?Vikir was just about to rise from his seat.\u2026thud!A figure stepped in between Vikir and Aiyen.Ahun. He was riding a wolf, looking down at Vikir.The atmosphere immediately turns chilly.Aiyen crossed her arms in a look of disapproval.Balak\u2019s hunters compete for every moment.Ahun is a warrior who has always been fond of Aiyen, and he will challenge her in this hunt.\u201cThis time,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019ll bring home the bigger game. I\u2019m going to captain the next joint hunt in my grandfather\u2019s honor.\u201d\u201cWhy would you risk your grandfather\u2019s honor on a hunt when all you know how to do is witchcraft? It\u2019s your prerogative to do whatever you want.\u201dAiyen didn\u2019t confront Ahun.He merely jerked his chin toward Vikir across the room, urging him to come quickly.Vikir had just risen from his seat and was about to approach Aiyen.\u2026Puck!Vikir\u2019s head snapped back.Ahun, riding on top of the wolf, had kicked him in the face with his foot.Vikir was still wounded, so he had no choice but to take the kick even though he knew it was coming.Thank goodness it wasn\u2019t an attack of great force.The next moment, Aiyen was furious.\u201cYou bastard, what the\u2026\u2026!?\u201dAi Yan stepped forward, but she froze in place.She glanced back and forth between Vikir, who had fallen to the ground with a strange look in his eyes, and Ahun, who had gained momentum.Ahun flinched for a moment at Aiyen\u2019s reaction, then breathed a sigh of relief.Then he looked at the fallen Vikir and sneered.\u201cYou\u2019re using this weakling as a hunting aid. Get a grip, Captain. You\u2019ll only get yourself in trouble.\u201d\u201cYou should look at your own backside before you say that \u2026\u2026.\u201dAt Aiyen\u2019s sarcastic remark, Ahun looked down at his waist.There was nothing there. Where there should have been a quiver full of arrows.\u201c\u2026\u2026!?\u201dAhun whipped his head around, furious.Vikir had somehow gotten up with his quiver and arrows.He had just swiped it from Ahun before he collapsed.\u201cYou owe the Age of Destruction again.Before his regression, Vikir hadn\u2019t really had a job he hadn\u2019t done.The art of pickpocketing comes in handy, too.\u201cWeapons are like lovers. You use them when they\u2019re taken away.\u201dVikir\u2019s grave comment made Aiyen burst out laughing and Ahun blush.\u201c\u2026\u2026you, you insolent slave!\u201dAhun drew his bowstring and struck Vikir in the shoulder.Boom!With a loud crack, Vikir fell to the ground.As if that wasn\u2019t enough, Ahun climbed off the wolf\u2019s back.Boom!The bowstring swings out once more.\u2026Boom!Ahun\u2019s bow had to stop in midair.Ai Yan had drawn an arrow and blocked Ah Hun\u2019s bowstring.\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Whose slave do you think you\u2019re punishing?\u201dAiyen\u2019s words were as cold and hard as frost.Ah Hun stammered out a retort.\u201cHe\u2019s a slave, how dare he insult a Balak warrior!\u201d\u201cYou showed your pathetic self first.\u201d\u201cNevertheless, he\u2019s a slave, and a slave can never insult a warrior!\u201dAhun protested, citing the rules of the tribe.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAiyen thought for a moment, then nodded.\u201cVery well, a slave is a slave, and if he does something wrong, he must be punished.\u201d\u201cYes, Captain. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.\u201d\u201cBut you have no right to punish him, he\u2019s my slave.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dThe concept of private property is rare on Balak, but when it comes to slaves, the lines of ownership are pretty strict.When Ahun shook his head, Aiyen drove a wedge.\u201cIf there is to be a punishment, it will be mine.\u201dWith that, Aiyen slid off the wolf\u2019s back and stood in front of Vikir.And then.\u2026snap!Aiyen\u2019s hand slapped Vikir across the cheek.As Vikir fell to the ground, Aiyen continued to beat him.His fists curled like snakes, targeting his abdomen, waist, and legs.Vikir crouched down and endured Aiyen\u2019s fists in silence.After a few minutes of this, Aiyen pulled back, breathing heavily.Then he glared at Ahun with a cold stare.\u201cAre we done?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAhun held his breath as if he was embarrassed by Aiyen\u2019s spanking, then nodded in disbelief.Aiyen looked Ahun straight in the eyes.\u201cI know you have a lot of personal grievances with my slave, falling off the wolf\u2019s back, not being able to catch Saxi\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cAfter this time, if you do anything to my slave in private, you will be beaten like this. Do you understand?\u201dBlood drips from Aiyen\u2019s knuckles.His eyes were dark and flesh-colored.Ahun nodded a few times, his expression uncertain, and then looked at Vikir on the floor with a fed-up gaze.Vikir, who hadn\u2019t screamed up until that point, merely squirmed quietly in place.With that, Ahun climbed onto the wolf\u2019s back and quickly disappeared.Only Aiyen and Vikir were left here again.Sigh\u2026Aiyen creeped over and squatted down in front of Vikir.Vikir pushed himself to his feet.He stroked Vikir\u2019s reddened cheeks with an unreadable, complicated gaze.\u201c\u2026\u2026Were you hurt?\u201dHis tone had changed slightly, but maybe it was just his mood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ahun is a small, relentless creature, and this was the only way to stop him from retaliating.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Why aren\u2019t you talking, huh?\u201dAt his master\u2019s continued prodding, Bikir replied tersely.\u201cIt hurts.\u201dAnd it did. The inside of his mouth is covered in crusts of blood, and it hurts just to open it.Then. Aiyen\u2019s body flinched for a moment.She slowly turned her head to look at Vikir.\u201cDoes it hurt a lot?\u201dAiyen looked at Vikir\u2019s neck.The white skin was smeared with red marks from the dog collar.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAiyen stared at the mark for a moment.Then she bent her head toward Vikir and ran her tongue across the scar on his neck.Vikir jerked his head back in disgust, and Aiyen, for a moment, realizing what she had done, backed away in anger.Vikir frowned.\u2018Do barbarians normally lick each other\u2019s wounds?\u2018Animals of the dog family do.Balak\u2019s warriors are friendly with wolves, so this behavior may be commonplace.But Vikir was a civilized man, and it was awkward.\u201cBesides, licking the wound with your tongue is dangerous, as it leaves room for infection.So Bikir was prepared to firmly refuse if Aiyen tried to lick the wound on his neck again.However.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAiyen doesn\u2019t say anything, just tilts her head.For some reason, the tips of his pointed ears were colored bright red.* * * https://pindangscans.comLike all Balak warriors, Aiyen was basically a simple person.Her spirits were quickly lifted when Vikir returned to his usual behavior, save for being less talkative due to his illness.Now in a better mood, Aiyen offered Bikir a gift to apologize for her earlier slap.\u201cIs there anything you want from me, anything I can do for you that\u2019s within my power, just tell me one thing.\u201dBikir didn\u2019t hesitate to answer.\u201cTeach me how to shoot a bow.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026a. Bow.\u201dI wondered if he had something else on his mind. The answer came back a little muffled.Aiyen looked a little disappointed at Bikir\u2019s immediate response.\u201cYeah. Bow is good. Bow\u2026\u2026.\u201dAiyen mumbled for a moment, then a wry smile tugged at the corners of his mouth.\u201cGood. Since we\u2019re out hunting, I\u2019ll teach you how to shoot a bow, too. You\u2019re probably better with a bow than a sword anyway.\u201dWith that, Aiyen moved behind Vikir and hugged him tightly against his chest.Aiyen\u2019s body pressed tightly against his, the weight of it straining Vikir\u2019s spine.Bikir grunted through the pain.\u201cDo I have to learn \u2026\u2026 in this position?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s best to learn everything with your body. Do you have a problem with that?\u201dIt was hard for Bikir, with his broken body, to resist.Then. Aiyen pulled out a spare bow and placed it in Vikir\u2019s hand.The unfamiliar feel of it in his hand brought back memories for a moment.Vikir was quite proficient with a bow, as part of the education of the young hounds of Ironblood Baskerville was an introduction to armory.And the swordsmen of the Age of Destruction actually knew how to use almost every other weapon to some degree, not just swords.Vikir had already mastered the basics of archery.\u2026\u2026A minor, so to speak.\u201cBut not enough to go out and show off.Before his regression, he\u2019d been pretty good with a bow, but not to the point where he could actually use it in combat.At best, he could take down small game that could be cleaned and eaten immediately.But here in Balak, where all the people are masters of the art of archery, he might be able to reach new heights.Is it the desire to take down the big game?Aiyen had been clinging to Bikir since the beginning, eagerly teaching him archery.\u201cWe\u2019ll need the help of a wolf pup for this hunt.\u201dAiyen was eager for this hunt.Balak\u2019s 300 members need at least 200 kilograms of game to survive the day.What\u2019s more, the warriors\u2019 recent hunting performance has been poor, and there are many people in the tribe who are starving.\u201cYour life will be easier if you make your mark here.\u201dAt Aiyen\u2019s words, Vikir nodded.Just then.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dAiyen\u2019s wolf, Baqira, suddenly stopped running.It had spotted its prey.Aiyen bent down and grabbed a handful of dirt from where Vakira was sniffing.A mixture of rotting sawdust and fallen leaves, moss and sand.The soil was slightly damp, and it smelled pungent and rancid.Aiyen said with conviction.\u201cIt must be oxbane.\u201dVikir knew the creature Aiyen spoke of.<Oxbear>.Danger Rating: ASize: 5 metersFound in: Ridge 7, Red and Black Mountains-A very large bear with two huge horns.A carnivorous bear, the strongest terrestrial predator, and a perfect killing machine, it is considered the strongest and pinnacle of the Red and Black Mountains 7th Ridge ecosystem.It has few natural enemies other than its own kind.The bear carries two water buffalo horns on its head.Its entire body is covered in thick muscle, fat, and bristly fur.A monster I had encountered many times before during my training within the clan.However, the ones roaming around here now must possess a different level of strength and life force than the ones that were captured in the cages inside the clan, waiting to be killed.\u201cThis must be their territory from here on out.\u201dAiyen turned his head to follow the direction of the scent.Oxbears deliberately sprayed their poisonous urine to discourage prey and warn rivals.The scent would have sent any lesser predator running for cover, but not Aiyen, the hunting leader of the younger Balak.Vikir, too, had the calm demeanor of the worn and tattered hound he had been before his regression.Aiyen smirked at the sight.\u201cNot scary?\u201d\u201cNot really.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you\u2019ve got some balls for a kid from the Empire. An Oxbear is a threat to even the most seasoned of Balak hunters.\u201dAiyen seemed to like Vikir\u2019s demeanor all the more.Soon, Aiyen and Vikir were facing the wind, tracking the scent.Aiyen stalked his prey with animal instincts.Sometimes he could smell it better than Vakira, the wolf.Vikir, too, was skilled at tracking, but only when it came to fleeing humans.\u201cGood chance.Vikir looked over his shoulder at Aiyen\u2019s seasoned demon tracking skills.And then.It wasn\u2019t long before they spotted their target at the top of a rolling hillside lined with tall bushes and short shrubs.I see a large oxbear making its way through the undergrowth.Two fiercely curved horns, fur far thicker and denser than I\u2019d ever known, flesh and muscle clinging together in an impossibly tight knit mass.The oxbear, which appeared to be very old, stood about eight meters tall, larger than any oxbear Vikir had seen before his regression.\u201c\u2026\u2026 That\u2019s enough to raise my risk rating.\u201dWhen Vikir muttered that, he was done talking.It\u2019s hard to go toe-to-toe with a creature of that size.It would have been better to back off now and move on to other prey.But Aiyen didn\u2019t back down.\u201cLet\u2019s go after it.\u201dShe clung to Bikir\u2019s side.Bikir pushed through the faint pain.\u201cA beast of that size will be hard to deal with. Apparently he\u2019s unusually strong for an oxbear.\u201d\u201cFool. Who said we\u2019d catch him?\u201dVikir looked puzzled at Aiyen\u2019s comment.She replied with a smirk.\u201cIf there\u2019s a sow bear, there\u2019s no shortage of bulls. Look.\u201dBefore she could finish, a response came from beyond the thicket.Another oxbear had approached the original oxbear.Apparently, the giant oxbear that Vikir and Aiyen had first spotted was a female.The new male oxbear was relatively small.It was barely over four meters tall at best, and must have weighed nearly twice as much.Could she be in heat?As she moves her massive body, the male oxbear sneaks up on her and sniffs her fur.Then he starts nuzzling her chest and back.\u201cOkay, that\u2019s the real prey.\u201dAiyen grinned and pressed Vikir\u2019s chest and back against the bush.Vikir watched the grooming of the male and female oxbears and felt the strength of Aiyen\u2019s grip on his arms.Passasac\u2026Hidden in the bushes, Aiyen\u2019s body pressed closer to Vikir\u2019s.Humid, hot breath brushed against his earlobe, crushing it.The skin of every inch of her body, toned and soft, pressed against Vikir\u2019s back.The pounding of her heart against his back makes him tense up like an archer.Naturally, Bikir could only think one thought.\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of weight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He spat once on the ground and crossed his arms with a confident expression.In front of him now was a large dead boar.At first glance, it looked like it weighed over 300 kilograms.The Balak warriors gathered around Ahun and praised his feat with one accord.\u201cWow, a piece of meat this size would feed the entire tribe!\u201d\u201cI only caught three hares.\u201d\u201cAhun\u2019s boar must be the best of the hunt.\u201dThe warriors spoke, each offering up their catch.Ahun\u2019s boar was the largest of the bunch so far.A hunt of this size, with almost every member of the tribe participating, was a game and a contest in itself.And within the village, aside from the chief, the greatest authority goes to the hunter who brings in the biggest and fiercest catch.Ahun shrugged.\u201cEven Captain Aiyen wouldn\u2019t be able to kill something bigger than that.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019ll be the hunting leader from now on?\u201d\u201cHmph. By the rules, I should say.\u201dAhun gave a grim smile and blushed.But the man he was supposed to be bragging about hadn\u2019t returned to town yet.Only Aiyen, the hunting leader of the younger Balak, had not returned.Ahun waved his hand as if there was nothing more to see.\u201cEven a captain can only hunt so much on his own. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be able to catch anything bigger than this.\u201d\u201cBut the captain didn\u2019t go alone, did he take a slave with him, what\u2019s his name?\u201d\u201cYou fool, how is that going to help when he can\u2019t even walk on his own!\u201dAhun snapped at his other friend.His face fell as he remembered the humiliation he had suffered before the hunt.Ahun thumped his fist on his chest, as if to emphasize his point.\u201cI\u2019ll see you later, you won\u2019t catch a single rabbit! That slave bastard will grab you by the ankles!\u201dThe young warriors of Balak stood open-mouthed, nodding at Ahun\u2019s words.Whether he was right or wrong, it didn\u2019t matter.In any case, the man who had brought in the big catch had the last word.* * * https://pindangscans.comMeanwhile.Shoot.A large waterfall cascades down into a gorge.Below it was a sharp rocky, and far below that was a wide expanse of white sand.The water in the valley was crystal clear. If it weren\u2019t for the foam and the sound of the water, you wouldn\u2019t even know there was water there.\u2026Bam!Several fat carp swam up the falls.Unable to overcome the turbulent waters, they plunge downward, impaling themselves on the jagged rocks below.Aiyen and Vikir hid in the bushes by the waterfall and watched the scene unfold.\u201c\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s coming.\u201dAiyen said under his breath.Sure enough, the large female oxbear they had first spotted approached the mouth of the waterfall.Thick horns with countless scars, a thick pelt, and muscles packed to the gills.This is no ordinary oxbear.He is the product of a superior bloodline, one that has survived through countless generations.He doesn\u2019t even bother to hunt, simply pulling fish from the sharp rocks and devouring them in a single bite.He doesn\u2019t drink the water, only the fish.The river\u2019s waters are salty, and much of what accumulates on the white sandbars is salt, which doesn\u2019t suit Oxbear\u2019s taste for freshness.\u201cThis is where the river meets the sea, which is why we have a salt river.\u201dVikir nodded at Aiyen\u2019s words.Now that he thought about it, the crayfish that had been crawling in the stream downstream were unusually large.They were lobsters, not freshwater crayfish.Meanwhile.Even at this moment, the carp wanted to go over the waterfall and into the ocean.\u201cThey say that if a carp succeeds in making it back here, it can evolve into a big beast. That\u2019s what my grandmother said.\u201dAiyen explained again. Vikir merely nodded, not particularly curious or asking.Regardless of whether the legend she told was true or not, the carp, some as big as her forearm, are still working their way up the falls, and most of them fail to make the climb and fall to the bottom.A few lucky ones, even if they fail to climb the falls, are able to land on the surface of the water or on land close to the water as they fall and make their way back to the water, but most of the unlucky ones just get impaled on the sharp rocks and flounder and die.And Oxbear is clever enough to pick out only those carp and eat them.It was as if he didn\u2019t need to move his body to hunt.Maybe it\u2019s because this place is so famous for hunting?In addition to the female oxbear, several other oxbears began to approach.They watch the first female, then settle down at the mouth of the stream to feed on the carp.There were no rocks downstream, so there were no carp stuck to the rocks, so they had to use their bodies to hunt.The giant female oxbear turns her head and looks down at her poor competitors with a pathetic expression.It was a mixture of contempt and superiority.Aiyen glared at the oxbear with a determined expression.He growled lowly to warn off other predators that might approach, but he was exceptionally tolerant of the smallest and youngest members of his species.Several oxbears the size of puppies approach fearlessly and bite the carp on the head before fleeing.The female oxbear glances at the little ones, who she doesn\u2019t recognize, and ignores them.It was Vikir\u2019s first time seeing an oxbear cub, and he was somewhat intrigued.Aiyen quickly realized the object of Vikir\u2019s attention and spoke up.\u201cIs this your first time seeing an Oxbear cub?\u201d\u201cI have. They\u2019re much smaller than I thought.\u201d\u201cNewborn oxbear cubs are even smaller. They\u2019re only mice. They hibernate, so there\u2019s no way to nourish them if they\u2019re too big. She carries them for twelve months and finally gives birth to them at that size.\u201d\u201cThe mother must be terribly protective of her young.\u201d\u201cOf course. Anyone within a hundred-meter radius of the cub will be attacked. Even Balak hunters don\u2019t mess with pregnant females with cubs.\u201dOxbears are heartless creatures who will eat their own kind if they\u2019re hungry, but their maternal instincts are admirable.Then.A male oxbear approached the female.It was a male oxbear, and he was quite large.He wasn\u2019t quite as big as her, but he was well-built for his age.His nostrils flared as he followed her scent.Her ears perked up as he approached, perhaps due to her old age and poor eyesight.Her hearing must be as acute as her eyesight.[croak!]The female oxbear lets out an unexpected roar.The large male, who had been slowly approaching her, was startled and took a few steps backwards, eventually letting go.He didn\u2019t think he could win an all-out battle with a female oxbear.Bikir said, puzzled.\u201cShe keeps refusing to mate?\u201dIn fact, the number of males she\u2019s chased away so far is more than five.Some of them were really big and strong, but none of them seemed to appeal to her.\u201cHow strong are they looking for?\u201dVikir muttered, and Aiyen chuckled.\u201cYou\u2019re thinking about something wrong.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cThat female is not looking for a strong male, quite the contrary.\u201dAiyen was right.Soon enough, a male oxbear began to lumber toward her.He is a small, young male who was the first to approach the female oxbear and was chased away for being too small.She was about 8 meters tall and weighed about 2 tons, while he was about 4 meters tall and barely over a ton.The male sneaks up on her and sniffs her fur. Then he started rubbing her chest and waist.The female oxbear didn\u2019t seem to mind, so she let him smell her.Vikir crossed his arms in confusion.\u201cWhat is it, why did you pick the weakest male?\u201d\u201cBecause he wants a mate he can completely dominate.\u201dAiyen answered.In Oxbear society, strong, older mates are surprisingly unpopular.Strong, experienced males often tried to kill their mates when they became agitated.And the opposite was also true.That\u2019s why oxbears preferred mates that were younger and smaller.That way they wouldn\u2019t be attacked after the mating was over.\u201cOf course, we can\u2019t use someone with poor seeds. Those with good seeds, but still young and small, are the most popular mates. Male or female.\u201dAiyen was right.The female oxbear seemed to like the male oxbear.It was evident by the way she gently gave up her spot at the top of the carp pond.Aiyen smirked at the sight.\u201cBalak\u2019s warriors have a lot in common with the Oxbears when it comes to choosing mates.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cOn that note, do you know what kind of mate is most popular?\u201dVikir wasn\u2019t particularly curious, but Aiyen stuck to his point.\u201cAn individual with excellent seed, but young, and if he is wounded and weak, all the better.\u201dThis was why when Balak\u2019s warriors went out hunting for husbands and wives, they would often leave the other half dead and hanging in a rope.Once you\u2019ve created an idiot, they can\u2019t run away and they can\u2019t fight back, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re going to have reproductive problems.In short, just pull the seeds out.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir was silent for a moment.Believing that the sparkle in Aiyen\u2019s eyes staring back at him must be a mood thing.Just then.[grrr\u2026\u2026]A strange sound came from the falls.Aiyen and Vikir quickly turned their heads.The female oxbear was making a strange noise, unlike anything they had ever heard before.The male oxbear stopped eating carp and lunged at her, nuzzling his nose into the back of her neck.She bit down on the nape of his neck, almost dragging him away.With that, the two oxbears left the salted sandbar and began to make their way through the bushes and into the jungle beyond.Aiyen urged Vikir along.\u201cWe should go.\u201dAiyen\u2019s gaze, which had been fixed on the female oxbear, now shifted to the male.Aiyen glanced back at Vikir with an amused smile.\u201cThat male is about to lose a lot of his strength. Then\u2026\u2026.\u201dAiyen picks up his bow and arrows, and Vikir nods in agreement.It would soon be hunting time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were for the oxbears mating in that den.They had been helping the oxbears mate for the past three days.When a hungry female came out to forage for food, Aiyen and Vikir would provide her with these small bits of food so that she could mate as quickly and as often as possible.The female oxbear would carefully examine them for poison, then take them back to the males and feed them to restore their strength.Aiyen smiled wryly.\u201cThose berries and mushrooms are a short-term boost. But in the long run, they\u2019re terrible for you. They raise the body\u2019s heat rapidly and then drop it rapidly again.\u201dVikir knew the benefits of those ingredients.Taking them makes you temporarily stronger, but it saps and burns your life force, which is not good for your health.And the female Oxbear seemed to know this and still take them.The male Oxbear also seems to recognize the benefits of these mushrooms and berries, but he can\u2019t do much to satisfy her needs right now.He can only eat.Sometimes during the feeding, if Vikir accidentally left a scent or a trail, the female oxbear would come out of her den, alert and wary.She was old and had poor eyesight, but her ears seemed to make up for it.[Crouch!]She tore at the thick logs around her with her claws and pulled rocks apart.A giant tree that must have been hundreds of years old was snapped in half, and the rocks that supported the small hill were shattered.After ravaging the area for a while, the female, satisfied that there were no more signs of intruders around her, went back into the den and climbed on top of the exhausted male.Vikir, hiding behind a bush, muttered quietly.\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a warning to the intruder or the male.\u201dSuch a display of strength would scare off the intruder, but it would also make it impossible for a cowardly male to escape.Vikir now understood why Aiyen had chosen a large, powerful female to pursue first.The stronger and larger the female, the more likely she was to be able to keep the male at a distance.Meanwhile.Lurking hunters need to eat, too.Aiyen calculated the direction of the wind and set about making a meal that would not carry the scent to the oxbears.Clear water boiled in a coconut shell with crayfish from the waterfall. The only other additions were a handful of salt and a bunch of dried seaweed.Aiyen offered Vikir some of his clear water.He pushed all the lobsters, even the plump ones, in front of Vikir.It was a sight that made it hard to tell who was the master and who was the slave.\u201cEat a lot, so you can feel better.\u201dAiyen shoved a considerable amount of food in front of Vikir\u2019s nose.Vikir thought she looked a bit like a camel.\u2026Pow!The red lobster\u2019s body snaps in half.The hard shell cracked open, revealing plump white flesh.The yellow and blue guts were steaming hot.Vikir chewed on the crayfish\u2019s head.\u201cBy the way, they mate like crazy.\u201dFor three days, the oxbears barely left their burrows.The constant vibrations of the burrow and the mingled moans of the males and females inside must have been exhausting for those who had been watching for three days.Aiyen\u2019s eyes light up with mischief at Vikir.\u201cIsn\u2019t that what you deserve?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026what?\u201d\u201cI thought all Balak men were supposed to do that, but not Imperial men?\u201dVikir frowned.Aiyen\u2019s words were so unreliable after what had happened.Hadn\u2019t he once taken her word for it and pissed in the middle of nowhere and been humiliated by his tribe?But Aiyen continues to tease Vikir.\u201cYou can\u2019t do that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWell, maybe you can\u2019t because you come from the land of the sandman.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s a sandman.\u201d\u201cThen can you do that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cCan you do it? Can you do it?\u201dAiyen was getting annoying.Vikir knew that getting caught up in her pace would be a headache, so he chose to ignore her completely.What a cheeky slave.\u2026\u2026 Just then.[CRACK!]A cry unlike any other erupted.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe playfulness drained from Aiyen\u2019s face.She bounced to her feet, quickly grabbed her bow and arrow, and began to peer over the bush.The playful seventeen-year-old girl of just moments ago was nowhere to be seen.Only the sharp-shooting hunter remained.[Grrrr\u2026\u2026]Baqira, Aiyen\u2019s partner wolf, had bared her teeth as well.Vikir, too, dropped his lobster claws and rose to his feet, crouching beside Aiyen.A commotion was from the den containing the two oxbears.[Gwooow! Gwooow! Gwooow!]The female, who had been gentle with the male up until this point, gagged a few times and suddenly changed her demeanor.She bared her teeth at him and threatened him with her hidden nails.The male was taken aback by her sudden change in demeanor, but remained lying on the ground, apparently trusting his bond with her.He seems to want to stay in his big, cozy nest for a while longer.But she wasn\u2019t about to let him keep squirming and pressing against her.\u2026Bam!A dull noise.The female slammed her front paw with the force of several tons.Teeth snapped and blood spurted.A slap on the ear jolted the male to his feet.He scrambled out of the den on shaky legs.Aiyen called out in triumph.\u201cLooks like the female is convinced that she\u2019s fertile.\u201dNow that she\u2019s successfully conceived, she doesn\u2019t need to squeeze the male\u2019s seeds.It\u2019s a world of carnivorous bears.After mating, the opposite sex is simply a competing predator that has invaded their territory.[Boom!]The female roared once more at the fleeing male. The male is confused and scrambling for his life.The male scurries away from the female\u2019s lair in a daze.To avoid being eaten, he had to run away as fast as he could while she wasn\u2019t in a bad mood.His legs are shaking and his movements are slurred and slippery.Her fur was matted and had lost much of its shine.His nose and eyes were dry, and all the fat that had once been plump on his back, belly, flanks, and thighs had been burned away.His cheeks were already visibly puffy from the slap he had just received.And at the sight of such a male oxbear, the eyes of Aiyen, the hunter of the Balak, glittered.\u201cFollow me, slave.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAiyen, a male oxbearer, and Vikir, a slave to his mistress.This was the beginning of the real hunt.*** Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version) ***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was evident by the water scattered in his path.\u201cYou have to take advantage of the moment when your target is as weak as possible.\u201dVikir nodded as Aiyen applied frog venom to his arrowhead.\u2026\u2026When is the enemy most fragile?It\u2019s when they\u2019re sleeping, especially after several vigorous copulations.Aiyen looked at the oxbear feces on the floor and nodded.\u201cJudging by the viscosity and consistency, he\u2019s in very bad shape.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019ll probably sleep soundly tonight.\u201d\u201cOf course he will, he hasn\u2019t slept a wink for the past three days and is drained of energy. He\u2019ll probably retreat to a dark, deep corner where he doesn\u2019t normally go.\u201dAiyen was right.The oxbear was aware of its condition, and it was heading deeper and deeper into the dense floodwaters.Dense jungle. Fallen trees hung between the living, creating a maze of trees.The leaves were turning red and yellow, making it difficult to discern direction.Tracking the animals was made even more difficult by the fact that their tracks could be washed away in as little as half a day if it rained.But Aiyen never loses sight of his target.The way the branches bend, the way the grass is trampled, the depth of the soil, the chirping of the grasshoppers around him.To a seasoned hunter, these are all signposts.\u201cWhere an oxbear has passed, you won\u2019t hear a mouse or insect for a while.\u201dAs if in agreement, the wolf Bakira lets out a low howl.Bakira had been tracking a scent from earlier, the faint scent of sweet-smelling berries, a faint scent that the human nose could not detect.The scented berries had been stuffed into the stomachs of carp and salmon by the Aiyen and tossed to Oxbear as food.So that Oxbear would breathe it in and carry it with him everywhere he went.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dMeanwhile, Vikir had watched the Aayen\u2019s skillful tracking from start to finish.Some parts he didn\u2019t know, some parts he did.What he knew, he would review; what he didn\u2019t know, he would learn.Then.Up in the trees, Aiyen looked down at the forest at the bottom of the hill and stretched out a finger.Sure enough, there it was, a male oxbear stumbling along.He could probably catch it if he pounced on it right now, but he was cautious nonetheless.\u201cWell, we\u2019ll have to put off the hunt for a while.\u201d\u201cWhy is that?\u201dVikir asked, and Aiyen grunted and frowned.\u201cThat oxbear has crossed the borders of the swamp. There are scary creatures that live in the swamp, so we can\u2019t go in there.\u201d\u201d Scary creatures?\u201dVikir was about to ask what it was.\u2026Mate!Aiyen\u2019s two palms flew out and slapped Vikir on both cheeks.The cheeks flushed red in an instant. As Vikir stood there dazed, Aiyen smirked.\u201cThis is the creature.\u201dAiyen held out one palm in front of Bikir.In the center of his palm was a dead mosquito.Bakira, the wolf, growled lowly and pawed at the mosquito\u2019s corpse in warning.Aiyen warned with a serious expression.\u201cThere are three types of mosquitoes in that swamp. One is the blood-sucking mosquito. These are not very threatening. But\u2026\u2026 bone-sucking mosquitoes and flesh-sucking mosquitoes, you have to be careful.\u201dThis was something Vikir knew as well.Of all the mosquitoes in the waters of the Red and Black Mountains, the bone-suckers were the most dangerous.They swarm over anything that moves, turning the body of a living creature into a leather bag of blood and guts in an instant.In fact, Vikir had seen what the bone-sucking mosquitoes had done to a colleague a few times before, so he understood the gravity of Aiyen\u2019s situation.\u2026\u2026But there\u2019s one thing he doesn\u2019t understand.\u201cBut. Why won\u2019t you take your hand away from your cheek?\u201dAiyen\u2019s other hand was still on Bikir\u2019s cheek.Aiyen flinched slightly at Bikir\u2019s question, but then answered in a brusque manner.\u201cDo I have to take it off?\u201dAiyen was now openly pinching the flesh of Bikir\u2019s cheek.Bikir frowned.\u201c\u2026\u2026What are you doing?\u201d\u201cWhy, I\u2019m the master. Do you have a problem with me touching mine?\u201dBikir\u2019s mouth was half open in disbelief.But it would be futile to rebel against Aiyen now, not when he was so ill.\u201cYou\u2019re so soft.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dSo I\u2019ll just have to put up with this humiliating childish treatment for a while.* * * https://pindangscans.comOn the night.Aiyen settled down on the cliffside directly overlooking Oxbear\u2019s burrow.\u201cThey\u2019ll strike at first light tomorrow.\u201dOxbear is nocturnal, so fighting him now would be a disadvantage.It was wisest to strike when the sun rose and he fell asleep.Aiyen and Vikir built a simple hut on a solid rocky area.A few branches, a leather cloth, and some broad leaves made a tent large enough for three or four people.Blow into it and white smoke billows out.This is what the indigenous people of Balak call the \u201ccold valley,\u201d a valley where even in May, the snow still hasn\u2019t melted.\u201cIt\u2019s so cold here, even the mosquitoes can\u2019t come.\u201dAiyen climbed into the tent and lay down.He lifted his leathers and turned to Bikir, who stood outside the tent.\u201cCome in here.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dBikir was silent for a moment.He looked around and saw the harshness of the environment.The ground is cold and the soil is bad.Trees couldn\u2019t grow much, so where they had grown and died, only bushes and weeds sprouted in their place.With short shrubs rising up like a grate, it was not a bad place to camp for the night, as long as you were careful of the cold.Rustle\u2026Vikir stepped inside the tent.Aiyen had dug a shallow pit in the new floor and piled leaves and swordfire in it.Crackle!A small fire blossomed.The light from the teepee warmed the confined space.True to its name, the valley became very cold at night.His face and arms were hot in front of the fire, but his back, head, legs, and toes were immediately icy.Beyond the crackling embers, Vikir thought of many things.The friends and companions he\u2019d left behind in the Age of Destruction, all those faces.People he could see again whenever he chose, people he would never see again.Meanwhile, in the sea of fog outside the tent, dead trees, like human bones, rose and sank.Vikir is lost in thought over the dying embers of the fire.\u201cBoom!\u201dA sound breaks his reverie.He turns to find Aiyen buried in Bakira\u2019s fur, inhaling something.It was a strong liquor, so strong that you could tell its strength by the smell alone.From a leather pouch, Aiyen smoked a wide slice of jerky, slathered in white fat, and ate it as a late-night snack.It looked like buttered bread, but the flavor and calorie count would be far different.After a long pause, Aiyen looked back at Vikir.\u201cYou should eat it, it\u2019s good for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t have jerky.\u201dVikir replied, and Aiyen waved his hand dismissively.\u201cOh well. Don\u2019t worry. It is a master\u2019s virtue to provide for his slaves. I\u2019ve even brought you your share.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dVikir cocked his head.Aiyen\u2019s leather pouch had contained only one piece of jerky.It had just gone into her mouth.Just in time.\u2026Jaw!Aiyen cupped both of Vikir\u2019s cheeks in her palms.Then she shoved her face into his.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dVikir didn\u2019t even have time to protest.Aiyen kissed Vikir on the mouth, spilling the liquor and jerky in his mouth.Gulp!Vikir swallowed the liquor and meat in one gulp.\u201cFuha!\u201dOnly then did Aiyen pull her face away from Vikir\u2019s.She stroked his chin with the back of her hand and smirked.\u201cYou can\u2019t chew this jerky with your current jaw. It\u2019s very tough.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m sure it is.\u201dVikir frowns.The jerky that remained in his mouth was so tough that he had to draw on his mana to chew it.With Ahun\u2019s beating, Vikir hadn\u2019t been able to eat anything other than porridge or tree berries, so this was a nice (?) nourishment.Suddenly.Aiyen\u2019s eyes widened.Somehow, she had ended up sitting on top of Vikir.In the cramped confines of the tent, Vikir could do little more than struggle beneath her.Aiyen\u2019s face is flushed red from the firelight.She stares down at Vikir with an oddly heated smile.\u201cYou can\u2019t even rebel, can you?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s heavy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not heavy.\u201d\u201cI said it\u2019s heavy.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not heavy.\u201d\u201cI said I\u2019m heavy.\u201dAiyen was silent for a moment, thinking hard about something, and then he said.\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m heavy, it\u2019s that you\u2019re weak.\u201dWith that, Aiyen smiled a smile that seemed strangely pleased.Vikir saw it and gave up on the conversation.Maybe it\u2019s the language, but he can\u2019t read her emotions right now.\u201cThe first thing I need to do is recover quickly.He had to if he didn\u2019t want to be manipulated.If I could regain my strength, I could easily subdue this little fellow and leave the jungle.And the best way to do that was to sleep.Vikir closed his eyes.Aiyen leaned in close enough to touch his face with the tip of her nose.\u201cAre you itchy? Put your hand here. It\u2019s the place with the most heat. In return, I\u2019ll put my hand on yours\u2026\u2026.\u201dAs Bikir\u2019s hand slid between my chest and armpit, Aiyen paused to drape her body over his.Aiyen\u2019s expression quickly turns to bewilderment.\u201c\u2026\u2026are you asleep?\u201dThe answer came back, too scared to speak.Doron-.Vikir had fallen asleep in that brief moment.He can fall asleep in less than a second when he lies down, a skill that has been practiced by martial artists throughout the Age of Destruction.\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh!\u201dAiyen pouted her lips in disbelief.She slid off Vikir\u2019s body as if offended and lay down beside him.Then she rolled over and crossed her arms, her own hands trapped between his chest and armpits.\u201cHmph. How dare you be insolent. A dull slave, inconsiderate of his master.\u201dAiyen continued to grumble.Only Bakira, the wolf with her ears to the ground, is looking at Aiyen with a pitying gaze.\u201cWhat is it, why are your eyes open like that?\u201d[Grrrr-]\u201cWhat! What! I was just cold, I wasn\u2019t trying to do anything else\u2026\u2026.\u201dJust as Aiyen and Bakira were about to argue.\u2026Bam!Vikir, who thought he was sleeping, instantly jumped up.The momentum was enough to make even Aiyen and Bakira flinch in surprise.\u201cUh, uh, you didn\u2019t sleep\u2026\u2026?\u201dBefore Aiyen could open her mouth, Vikir spoke.\u201cIt\u2019s coming.\u201dSomething clicked in his senses that hadn\u2019t been there for a moment.Suddenly, Aiyen\u2019s and Bakira\u2019s expressions stiffened.Suddenly, an inexplicable wail rips through the night.[Krrrrrr!]The oxbear male had attacked this way first.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 61": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Return of the Iron-blood Sword HoundCH 60Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 60 The Hunter and the Hunted (6)Alas.Vikir scrambled to his feet.His bones screamed at his unhealed joints, but he had no choice.If he didn\u2019t move now, he would be killed.Boom!The tent I had built shredded like tissue paper.It was the Oxbear\u2019s powerful claws that tore through the night.Aiyen chuckled in amusement.\u201cYou were lured, weren\u2019t you, you sneaky thing?\u201dA male oxbear. Even if he was only half the size of the female, he was still a very large carnivore, standing over four meters tall and weighing over a ton.This seasoned beast already knew it was being tracked.That\u2019s why it had waited to strike while it was weak.Aiyen quickly grabbed his bow and arrows and retreated to the outside of the tent.Bakira, the wolf, crouched low beside her master, snarling.Aiyen studied the oxbear before him.\u201cI see you were chosen by the old female for a reason.\u201dThe giant female Oxbear before him had been very picky about her second year, and he was a little puzzled as to why she had chosen this one, who was unusually small among the many males, to be her mate.If it was simply because she didn\u2019t want to be attacked after mating, there were plenty of other smaller males available.But now I understood.She wanted his cunning intelligence to complement her superior physicality.[Grunt!]The oxbear lunged at her with two massive horns and both front paws.Aiyen climbed onto Bakira\u2019s back and quickly nocked an arrow to his bowstring.Ping-!Two arrows fly, aiming for the Oxbear\u2019s face.The oxbear ducked his head and lifted his horns up, so they couldn\u2019t hit him in the face.The arrows then deflected in midair as if they were alive, striking Oxbear in both shoulders.Indeed, Balak\u2019s archery was the best on the continent, and Aiyen\u2019s was the best of all.Karak- Karak- Karak- KarakAiyen strung multiple arrows from a single bow.Unusually, Balak\u2019s bow has multiple nocks.The arrows on each of these nocks can be staggered and fired back-to-back, or they can be fired all at once.Puff, puff, puff!Ai Yan fired arrow after arrow, barely pausing to breathe.The time it took for the first arrow to fly, followed by the second, third, fourth, fifth, and so on, was a blink of an eye.A truly monstrous rate of fire.Of course, pulling five arrows at once requires a ridiculous amount of arm strength.The enormous tension required was covered by Aiyen\u2019s low-level Gradient mana.[Grrrr!]The rain of arrows slowed Oxbear\u2019s charge.Each of Aiyen\u2019s arrows was so powerful that even the oxbear\u2019s thick muscles and furry hide could not defend against them.What\u2019s more, Aiyen\u2019s arrows didn\u2019t just travel in a straight line.She shot them upward, sideways, and sometimes even backward.Arrows that went up would fall in a parabolic arc and hit the top of the head, while those that went sideways would curve back and hit the side.Arrows that flew backwards even hit trees and rocks, sending grenades flying.Moreover, the arrows carried a powerful aura.Oxbear had no idea how troublesome this aura would be.\u2026Puck! Puck!Oxbear ducked behind a bush to avoid the flying arrow.The brambles were quite thick, and he thought they would block the arrows.But.\u201cA good arrow will pierce steel if it wants to, but it will not pierce a leaf if it does not want to.\u201dAiyen recalled a lesson she had heard from her mother and chief, Aquila.Next, she let loose an arrow, which struck the high bush where the oxbear was hiding.Poof!Surprisingly, the arrow, traveling at such high speeds, didn\u2019t hit the bramble and bounce back.Instead, the arrow\u2019s aura left the arrowhead and soaked into the brush.And then.Boom!The oxbear hiding behind the bramble spewed blood from its neck.[Crunch!]Penetration.The intangible energy from the arrowhead went beyond the barren tree and gouged into the oxbear\u2019s body behind it.Vikir gasped at the sight.\u201cIndeed, that is the archery of the Balak!A ridiculous archery skill, capable of killing even an enemy behind cover.But the skilled hunters of Balak actually do it.Vikir had moved mana to shatter a table and the glasses on it without destroying it, but he didn\u2019t know if it could be applied to flying arrows.\u201cIf it can be done\u2026\u2026 it would allow for more precise aura control.Vikir lifted his head again and looked at Aiyen.Seventeen years old and a Gradient junior.Even in Baskerville, where only geniuses live, I\u2019ve never seen a prodigy this young.In terms of talent alone, he could probably rival or surpass even Morg\u2019s camo.\u2026\u2026But.It was the oxbear that made even Aiyen nervous.An immature, small male, weak after a prolonged mating.But even so, the Danger Rank A beast was strong.Aiyen gritted her teeth as she realized she was almost out of arrows.Vakira, the wolf who had been his steady companion, was also exhausted.It\u2019s cold, the terrain is simple, and it\u2019s a moonless night, making visibility difficult.Now, with all the advantage, Oxbear is ready for the final blow.The oxbear\u2019s typical attack pattern consists of a horn charge followed by a large swing of its front paws.But it\u2019s the tooth attack that follows these two moves that really makes the difference.[He-aaaah!]The oxbear charged with all its might, opening its wide arms to embrace both Aiyen and Bakira at once.Its dagger-like jaws were lined with teeth, ready to rip Aiyen\u2019s head off.\u201cWhat do we do, we\u2019re running out of arrows, do we retreat, or do we make one last gamble\u2026\u2026?As Aiyen contemplated his next move.Something happened that neither Aiyen, Vakira, nor even Oxbear saw coming.\u201cMove.\u201dVikir. He had appeared.Vikir, an unwelcome intruder into the battle.He was perched on top of a tall branch.Then Vikir kicked off the branch and leaped, falling straight down to Oxbear.\u201cOw! What are you doing!\u201dAiyen was horrified. What Vikir was doing seemed to her to be nothing less than suicide.But then.As Vikir leapt from the tree, he clutched a handful of arrows.And surprisingly, Oxbear didn\u2019t react much to the sight of Vikir falling.That\u2019s because Bikir\u2019s jump was to the left.Not long before, the male Oxbear had received a slap on the cheek while moping around in the female\u2019s den after mating, and his left eye was swollen shut.It was an exquisite dig to fill the blind spot.And then.\u2026Poof!Several arrows in Vikir\u2019s grasp pierced Oxbear\u2019s left eye at once.Chiiiit-The sound of fat boiling, the smell of burning meat was unmistakable.The arrowheads had been loaded with Aiyen\u2019s mana not long ago, and were heated to the limit.The hot shards of iron tore through the oxbear male\u2019s swollen snowball flesh, popping his tender eyeball and sending the bundle of nerves inside scrambling.[Aaahhhhhh!]Oxbear\u2019s scream changed slightly.Its roar, once a mixture of hatred and contempt, was now tinged with fear.Vikir snatched the arrows out of her hand and dropped to the ground.\u201c\u2026\u2026thud!\u201dThe mere act of landing on the ground seems to shatter his entire body.The oxbear loomed in front of him, its enormous body looming over him.Aiyen gasped in horror.\u201cNo!\u201dShe quickly fired an arrow, but it only pierced some of the oxbear\u2019s strong back muscles.Vakira the wolf lunged and bit her hind paws, but Oxbear was unperturbed.[Argh!]Blinded by rage and fear, Oxbear opened his mouth in a guttural roar.No horns, no front paws, just teeth! The Oxbear\u2019s true breath attack flew toward Vikir.And the expression on Vikir\u2019s face as he faced it could not have been more serene.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThis is not a death wish.He\u2019s gauging whether his body can handle the technique he\u2019s about to use.\u201cCome out.\u201dBikir ordered in a low voice, and the faithful hound bared its teeth.\u2026Poof!A black awl pierced the artery in Vikir\u2019s wrist.The magic sword, Beelzebub, had been unleashed!Whirring.With the sound of a fly\u2019s wings, Beelzebub revealed his appetite for the giant hunk of meat in front of him.And with that, one of the powerful forces trapped within Beelzebub\u2019s three orbs exploded through the tip of his sword.<The Gluttonous Fly \u2018Beelzebub\u2019> / Awl-1 slot: Burn \u2013 Cerberus(A+)Cerberus. The three-headed dog that symbolizes Hell itself.Roar!The oil-based flames, which could not be extinguished by water, combined with the aura of Beelzebub\u2019s blade and exploded.Fueled by the oils of hell, the flames burned endlessly unless their master\u2019s will was extinguished.The fiery hound\u2019s teeth sank back into Oxbear\u2019s gaping mouth.[Cackle!?]Oxbear stopped charging.His eyes, blinded by rage and fear, finally opened to the reality of the situation.\u2026\u2026What the hell is that?I thought it was just some human blood, but it wasn\u2019t.What you see before you is a gigantic apex predator, the presence of a high-ranking demon that you dare not compare to, the fangs of a monster that belongs in the deepest hells of the Netherworld.Wherever it has been lying in ambush, the creature that has just bared its teeth is upon you, bringing untold pain and terror.\u2026Quack!A short, guttural sound.The awl that sprouted from Vikir\u2019s wrist shot out and pierced the oxbear\u2019s mouth.First, it pierced the hanging tongue, then the gums, then the palate, and finally the brain in the skull.To make matters worse, the tip of the awl emitted a terrifying flame.The most terrible pain in the world: burning pain.It was boiling the brains in Oxbear\u2019s skull to a crisp.[Gah!]Oxbear let out a near-terminal scream.Vikir\u2019s attack was short, but intense.The oxbear was still clinging to life with its characteristic toughness and regenerative powers, but that was all.No, that wasn\u2019t all.In the last moments of its life, Oxbear leaned its massive body toward Vikir.Vikir struggled to move from the pain he felt throughout his body.Even in death, Oxbear intended to use his massive body to crush Vikir to death.But.Pow!At that moment, Aiyen threw his whole body and grabbed Vikir.Bakira the wolf scooped up Aiyen and Vikir with her fluffy back and stepped back.\u201cAre you okay!?\u201dAiyen\u2019s eyes widened, scanning Vikir\u2019s entire body.Vikir nodded with difficulty.At the same time.\u2026thud!The Oxbear giant\u2019s head slammed into the ground.The last words of a male who, only moments before, had been frantically mating with a female in the cozy confines of his den, could he have imagined such an end?In the jungle, where looting, death, and love mixed together.\u2026The downfall!Aiyen pulled Vikir into a hug.She hastily tore off the few strips of cloth that covered them, shouting, \u201cTell me!\u201cTell me if you\u2019re going to die! We need to get the seeds out of \u2026\u2026!\u201dVikir couldn\u2019t help but sigh at the success of the hunt.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They\u2019re strong and fierce, but they\u2019re also intelligent, unlike boars, whose eyes are dark, whose movements are slow and simple, and who are so scared they shit and scream when they run.\u201dAiyen shouted as loudly as he could, hoping someone would hear him.Then he heard grunting and grunting from beyond the campfire where the meat was roasting.It was Ahun, who had killed a fairly large boar.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Holy sh*t. I don\u2019t know how a dying creature could have gotten away with this. He must have gotten incredibly lucky.\u201dAhun spat once on the ground and glared at Vikir.Then Ahun picked up his knife and cut the oxbear\u2019s meat into small pieces.The entrails and blood are perishable, so he immediately puts them in a pot of water to boil, and the flesh is cut into small pieces for fair distribution.Ahun then handed the meat to the villagers lined up in a row, and then to Vikir, who stood behind him.\u2026\u2026?Vikir\u2019s expression frowned slightly as he accepted the meat.The size and weight of the pieces of meat given to Vikir were dwarfed by those given to the others.Even less than what the frail old men and sniveling children had received.Vikir raised his head to protest.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dThen Ahun looked up, annoyed. A puzzled look on his face.Rather disgusted, he retorted.\u201cWhat are you talking about, you slave?\u201d\u201cWhy is my meat so little?\u201d\u201cWhat? No wonder. Because your honor is so high!\u201dAhun bellowed.Vikir gave him a puzzled look, and Aiyen, beside him, broke out into a wide grin.\u201cIt is a Balak tradition. The one who contributes the most to the hunt takes the least. In return, he receives an amount of honor equal to the lesser meat. If you can trade honor for meat, you have a great deal.\u201dAhun nodded in agreement.\u201cDamn. Part of me wants to give you a lot of meat, too! But you gotta give credit where credit is due.\u201dJudging by his grumbling, he really does want to give Vikir a lot of meat.Well, the less meat he gets, the more honorable he is.Vikir decided that meat was better than honor that was worthless, but for now he could only nod.\u2018It doesn\u2019t really matter.Though the meat was scarce, there was enough food to fill his stomach if he so desired.In fact, the real harvest of this hunt was not meat.<Gluttonous Fly \u2018Beelzebub\u2019> / Awl-1 slot: Burn \u2013 Cerberus (A+)Slot -2: Sacral Spine \u2013 Oxbear (A)Slot -3: Tight Throat \u2013 Infernal Buffalo(A)New skills gained from capturing Oxbear.One of the three orbs of the magic sword Beelzebub is imbued with the hardy soul of the male Oxbear you killed last night.The Hellhound\u2019s soul is gone, and the spirit of the stronger, higher-ranked Oxbear is Vikir\u2019s new slave.The skill of Sacral Spine was simple and effective.By holding your breath, you could increase your weight by nearly a thousand pounds (600 kilograms) in that time.It\u2019s a pretty versatile skill for close combat.Not only that, but the karma from killing the Oxbear was infused into his body, restoring a significant amount of health to his entire body.Skills and experience.Vikir was mentally calculating the results of this hunt.\u201cC\u2019mon, Ahun. That\u2019s quite a kill, don\u2019t you think?\u201dAiyen broke Vikir\u2019s reverie.She had brought several kilograms of foreleg meat, a jar of blood, and the heart, liver, and gallbladder that were Vikir\u2019s share of the bounty, reserved for the best hunters.Aiyen lifted the meat and waved it in front of Vikir\u2019s eyes.Narrowing her eyes, she spoke with a burdened air.\u201cJust as important as the hunt is the preparation and preservation of the kill.\u201dAiyen wanted to use the grooming as an excuse to stick close to Vikir and interfere.But there was one thing she didn\u2019t know.Vikir had slaughtered countless demonic carcasses during the Age of Destruction, and his skill at removing their entrails, flesh, bones, and skins to preserve and cook them was almost masterful.Chuckle, chuckle, chuckle, chuckle\u2026\u2026Vikir soaked the hides in water in a wide bamboo vat and scraped away the fat behind them with a sharp stone knife.The hides, which came off without a scratch, were set aside for tanning.When dry, the hides were as hard as planks, but softened after a few beats with oil squeezed from the scaffolding.The oxbear\u2019s flesh, guts, and blood were boiled in a pot, and the oils that floated to the top were skimmed off and used to light the lanterns.The bones, claws, and teeth were used to make weapons and jewelry.Meat as a whole was cooked in a variety of ways.Some cuts were made into jerky, some were boiled into soup, some were boiled into tang, some were lightly poached, some were smoked over charcoal, and some were hung to dry in nodal\u2026\u2026.Vikir was particularly good at smoking large pieces of meat whole.Some of the people who watched Vikir work on the meat were dumbfounded and left their meat to him.Among them was Aiyen, who had come to learn how to handle the meat.Vikir tied the large chunks of meat to salted rope and hung them from a branch.He then dug a pit and let the meat dangle in the center of the pit, and at the bottom of the pit he piled pine needles and oak and apple wood and lit a fire.Once the fire was blazing, Bikir gathered branches, leaves, and mud to seal the opening of the pit.After a while, he broke the mud lid, which had hardened under the fire, and pulled the rope to reveal a browned, smoky chunk of meat.A whole oxbear hind leg was roasted.The Balak people raved about the deliciously smoked hind leg barbecue.Aiyen\u2019s eyes widened in amazement as he cut into the meat.\u201cWhat the hell can\u2019t you do?\u201dNothing too extraordinary, given the age of the soul, but certainly surprising, given that the body was no more than fifteen years old.Vikir watched the younger children eagerly pick at the chunks of meat, blowing on them.The exuberance of young children is something that puts a smile on anyone\u2019s face, regardless of age.Vikir watched as the people ate the meat he had roasted.There was a slight quirk in the way the people of Balak shared their meat.Those with bad eyes ate the eyes of an oxbear.Those with bad lungs ate the lungs of the oxbear.Those with bad legs ate oxblood legs.Those with bad pancreas ate the pancreas of the oxberry.The tribesmen seemed to believe that they could cure their ailments by eating the parts of their prey.\u201cStrange superstition.\u201dVikir thought to himself.\u201cHey, slave.\u201dVikir hears a voice calling to him from the side.Aiyen, who had slipped away after the dismemberment had begun, was standing behind him when he reappeared.Cheeks burning, a large bowl of coconut in his hand.The steaming bowl was filled with a hot, bubbling broth of oil.Inside was a large chunk of meat, elongated and thick, making it hard to tell what it was.\u201cOrgan?I asked, though I couldn\u2019t tell exactly what it was because it was floating in a cloud of grease.Aiyen snorted and said.\u201cI\u2019ve taken what the shaman covets with the authority of a hunter, and this is for you to eat, by all means!\u201d\u201cI have already received a piece of meat, a jar of blood, and some entrails.\u201d\u201cNo, no, no, this is for you to eat!\u201dAiyen insisted on feeding Hansako Vikir the meat soup.Her logic was adamant.\u201cIf your eyes are bad, eat the eyes of your prey; if your heart is bad, eat the heart of your prey; if your hands or feet are bad, eat the forelegs and hind legs of your prey!\u201d\u201cWhat part of the oxbear is this?\u201dWhen Vikir asked about the identity of the long, thick chunks of meat in the bath, Aiyen only coughed and offered no explanation.\u201cHmph, seeing as how you\u2019ve been sleeping around in the cold, you\u2019ll definitely need this, eat some\u2026\u2026!\u201dAiyen mumbled the last part and swallowed it whole.Reaction erupted around him instead.\u201cWoooo- Captain, you\u2019re already taking what\u2019s yours(?)!\u201d\u201cWho gives that to a slave for his own good!\u201d\u201cHo-ho, the season of long nights is coming soon.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too blatant! It\u2019s obvious what he\u2019s up to!\u201dThe young women of the village booed Aiyen in unison.\u201cShut up, girls! If you\u2019re not happy, you can go out with your lasso and get him!\u201dAiyen raises her fist, her eyes glowing, and the heckling dies down.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir frowned, not quite sure what to make of that.Well, I\u2019ll take what I can get.Vikir gulped down the hot broth.He chewed and swallowed every last bit of the coarse meat that had sunk into his stomach as Aiyen kept urging him on.\u201cThis is so tough.\u201dThe texture itself was similar to the haggis she was used to eating in Baskerville, but it was much more savory and chewy than that.\u2026Gulp!Bikir\u2019s throat gurgled loudly once.Only then did Aiyen\u2019s expression soften.\u201cI see. Now you\u2019re going to give me an excuse.\u201dVikir frowned slightly once more.\u201cI think I\u2019ve already given you more than your fair share of hunting.He couldn\u2019t quite figure out what more she wanted here.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A creature of untold horror that no man could survive.The barbarians of Balak seemed to use parts of their dead prey, or the bodies of their prisoners of war, as sacrifices, nailed to high trees.Surprisingly, no creatures were interested in the meat the Balak men hung from the tree.Hyenas, eagles, and even the odd insect were not attracted to the meat.They didn\u2019t dare touch it because they knew who it belonged to.\u201cI wonder if the warriors of Baskerville and Morg were also sacrificed to Madame Eight-Legged once upon a time?It seemed likely, given the non-cannibalistic culture of the Balak.* * * https://pindangscans.comThe next day at dawn.Vikir awoke early and padded out of his tent.Along the way, he saw a group of drunken Balak warriors sleeping in the early morning dew.Vikir was careful not to step on them, and soon he was walking toward the outskirts of town.His body was healing faster with each passing day.And he would need more food if he wanted to recover faster.The meat, blood, and entrails of the oxbear were not enough, so Vikir traveled to the outskirts of the village to find food for himself.As a slave, he didn\u2019t expect to be allowed to leave the village, but the guards at the entrance were surprisingly willing to let him go.\u201cWhat are you, a slave, wandering around all by yourself because you did well in the hunt?\u201dThe sentry, Ahun, frowned at Vikir\u2019s arrogance, but didn\u2019t restrain him.\u201cYou don\u2019t think you\u2019re scared of the jungle just because you\u2019ve killed a dying bear, Kek, get out and die.\u201dAhun waved him off and Vikir walked out into the jungle, pacing.After a while, Vikir reached the tall tree where he had hung his offering last night.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dVikir\u2019s eyes widened slightly.Sure enough, the hundred kilograms of meat that he had hung on the high tree was gone.The disappearance of the meat meant that its owner had come and gone, even though the wild animals, flying beasts, and insects that roamed nearby had not dared to approach it.The area was filled with white, dried slime and charred, dead grass.\u201c\u2026\u2026That\u2019s a nasty demon.\u201dVikir turned away from the spot and headed for a stream a short distance away.A river of muddy water.There was no boundary between water and ground.Only overgrown vines and thorny leaves marked the river\u2019s boundaries.Vikir climbed a high branch and stretched out his line.He pulled out the longest, toughest strand of Oxbear\u2019s fur and used it as a fishing line.At the end of it was a hook carved from the oxbear\u2019s scavenged bones.Vikir bit the tip of his finger lightly to draw blood and sprinkled it into the river.The reaction was immediate.Bubbling, bubbling, bubbling\u2026\u2026Judging by the bubbling bubbles on the surface of the tan water, it had worked.Vikir threaded a frog that had been wandering nearby onto a fishing hook and cast it into the center of the foam.The bite was immediate.\u2026 Tsk!A fish with teeth as sharp as saw blades snapped off the line.<Piranha Natteri>.Danger rating (single individual) : DDanger rating (group) : ASize : 30cmFound in: Ridge 6, Black and Red Mountains-Travels in herds of at least a few thousand individuals.When alone, they are cowardly and shy, but in a group, they will charge at even the largest of enemies.They are sensitive to the smell of blood and will swarm in deep pools in rivers, and when they catch the scent of their prey, they will swarm away, leaving only the bones behind.The frog used as bait was torn to shreds, but the oxbear\u2019s fur and bones were intact, as were the line and hook.A fish with a black body and a red belly.As soon as Vikir caught it, he threaded it onto a spiky branch.The next bait was a small piece of flesh from the fish he had just caught.The Nateri are even more eager now that they are using meat from their own kind as bait.One, two, three, four\u2026\u2026 fish kept coming.Some were over 70 centimeters long, with black or white bodies and red eyes.\u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be hard to catch.\u201dVikir muttered as he looked down at the natteri, their gills pierced by long reeds.They were originally sensitive only to human blood and the flesh of their kind.Human blood, especially if it has been imbued with some degree of mana, is a favorite.The hunters of Balak don\u2019t seem to realize this, so Vikir simply stacks up the food in silence.Vikir then roasted the nateri over a low fire of fallen leaves and sticks.He ate some, smoked some, and used them to make fish balls.By the time he\u2019d caught the freshwater crabs and zaras that crawled along the banks of the river and stocked up on food, the morning sun had risen.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dAs I returned to the village with a sack full of food made of leaves, I saw a strange sight.In the center of town, in front of Chief Aquila\u2019s barracks, there was a long line of people.\u201cWhat was that?\u201dVikir scratched his head.There were at least thirty people lined up in front of the chieftain\u2019s barracks.Unusually, all thirty were young women.\u201cIs this some kind of ceremony?\u201dTo get to the barracks, I have to pass by this line anyway.Unaware of Vikir\u2019s approach from behind, the young women chatter amongst themselves.\u201cI\u2019ve been in line since the crack of dawn, thank God I\u2019m in the front of the line.\u201d\u201cI actually spent the night here!\u201d\u201cToo bad. I should have gotten up a little earlier.\u201dVikir listened, wondering what was going on.There was something off about their conversation.\u201cGiven your performance at yesterday\u2019s hunting festival, you\u2019re probably going to get off scot-free, right?\u201d\u201cThen surely you\u2019ll take a woman in the village as a saxi?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll talk to the chief and make sure I\u2019m the first to apply.\u201d\u201cI saw you cutting up the meat yesterday, and it was so hearty.\u201d\u201cYou must be strong enough to hunt down an oxbear.\u201d\u201cWhat a handsome thing.\u201dVikir shuffled away.\u201c????\u201dAn instinctive warning goes through me before I can fully comprehend what\u2019s going on.Vikir is just about to turn away.\u201cThese are real!\u201dI hear a shrill cry.Thirty or so women back away, furious.Where their gazes were directed, Aiyen stood, his eyes glowing.She was carrying three freshly killed roe deer.She threw them to the ground and announced to the women of the village.\u201c\u2018What nonsense,\u2019 she said to the women, \u2018I fed you yesterday to the point of decoction, and now you\u2019re trying to steal from me at the last minute!'\u201dThen one of the women mustered up the courage to speak up.\u201cThen use it first (?) and then hand it over!\u201d\u201cShut up, you\u2019re talking to a kid who\u2019s not even a slave anymore!\u201d\u201cMonopolies are vile!\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re so unjust, go out there with a noose and get him!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been out many times and there\u2019s never been a kid like that!\u201d\u201cHow far have you been out?\u201d\u201cThe borders of the empire!\u201d\u201cYou could go out to hell and back and find him!\u201dAiyen exclaimed, pulling his dagger from his inner thigh.Then the women in the line slipped backward.Even the bravest of Balak\u2019s women are afraid of Aiyen, the hunting leader.No wonder, since quarrels with her go beyond hair-pulling and nail-clawing.Watching the women slink away, Aiyen snorted hard.\u201cSh*t. At this rate, someone\u2019s going to pick it up while I\u2019m waiting for them to recover. I can\u2019t trust a bitch like Sagal. I need to get her well soon so she can give me an excuse\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dShe turned away, muttering something to herself.Aiyen and Vikir\u2019s gazes met.Vikir, who had been unintentionally hiding behind the tent, panicked.He hadn\u2019t done anything wrong, but he had been seen.But it was Aiyen who was more flustered than Vikir.\u201c\u2026\u2026. Look, did you see that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHmmm. No.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Khhhh.\u201dAn awkward silence fell between them.Finally, Aiyen scratched her neck and strode over.She\u2019s nearly a foot taller than Vikir.Aiyen stepped closer and looked down at Vikir.When she opened her mouth, he could smell the sweet scent of tree berries mingled with her warm breath.\u201cLast night, Mother called a meeting of the Elders.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAmong the many items on the agenda was your story.\u201dFrom what she\u2019d told me before, it was traditionally reserved for those who caught and submitted the largest game in the hunting system to be freed from slavery.But now, it seems, the reward is more than just a piece of cotton cloth.\u201cListen, you can ask my mother for something. As an honorable hunter of yesterday\u2019s slaughter.\u201dAiyen turned to Vikir.\u201cShe will probably try to match you with a mate.\u201dAn outsider, a bonded slave.The only way to keep such a useful person in the tribe is to know who they will be paired with.\u201c\u2026\u2026I wonder if that\u2019s why those women were lined up all morning.\u201dVikir sighed softly.Meanwhile, Aiyen narrowed her eyes and asked in a low voice.\u201cYou. Do you have a mate in mind in this tribe?\u201d\u2026\u2026 There can\u2019t be.His body is broken, and he\u2019s adrift in the middle of enemy territory, and he\u2019s been fighting dangerous creatures all this time.As Vikir shook his head emphatically, Aiyen\u2019s expression became subtle.It was a mixture of anger and helplessness, of relief and misgivings.\u2026 Tuck!Aiyen threw his arms around Vikir\u2019s shoulders.Her momentum was strong, but she gently lowered her hands when they reached Vikir\u2019s shoulders.Aiyen leaned close to Vikir\u2019s ear and spoke in a low voice.\u201cLater, when my mother calls for you, I will decide what you will ask of her.\u201dHer eyes sparkled.\u201cWhat shall I ask for\u2026\u2026\u201dShe looked as if she was planning some sort of trick.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The chieftain called me, I have to get going.* * * https://pindangscans.comEven the warriors of Balak, who roam freely in all parts of the jungle, are not allowed to act recklessly, especially in the presence of the chieftain Aquila.Vikir enters through the curtain and immediately sees a mounted eagle at the far end of the barracks.Beneath it, in a large chair, sat Chieftain Aquila.A stern-looking woman, scars scattered across her face.She\u2019s not very tall, but her rich eagle-feathered cloak and the sense of power she exudes make you think you\u2019re facing a giant.In particular, the large scar over one of her eyes made the audience feel intimidated.Nicknamed the Night Fox, she is the current leader of the Balak and their strongest warrior.She has won back-to-back victories over Hugo Les Baskervilles, patriarch and swordmaster of House Baskerville, and Morg Adolf, deputy and sixth-class master of House Morg.It is because of her that the Balak, who total only about three hundred in number, are feared by the empires and are known as the strongest warrior tribe in the jungle.\u201cChieftain.\u201dVikir dropped to one knee and bowed his head in the manner of his training.Aquila, the Night Fox, the greatest archer said to have ever lived since Adonai, the legendary archer who led the Balak at their height centuries ago.She lifted her one and only eye and gazed upon Vikir with admiration.Unlike Imperial speech, which circles around its purpose in greetings and praise, Balak\u2019s is straightforward and raw.\u201cI see you caught an oxbear this time. Thanks to you, we have delicious meat.\u201dAquila spoke with a gentle smile that belied her first impression.His voice was as regal as Hugo\u2019s, but without the edge, and instead warm and gentle.\u201cNo, Chief. I was only doing what I was supposed to do.\u201d\u201cThere is no need to be humble. A job well done is a job well done.\u201dAquila smiled even more warmly at Vikir\u2019s modesty.Vikir was genuinely surprised that the terrifying night fox was capable of such a smile.Finally, Aquila spoke.\u201cIn recognition of your deeds of yesterday, I am relieving you of your status. You are no longer a slave, but a member of our family.\u201dFrom this moment on, Vikir was no longer a slave, but officially a member of the Balak family.Then.\u201c\u2026\u2026cough.\u201dA sound of hollow coughing filled with disgust.Vikir glanced sideways to see a grizzled old man glaring at him with his mouth clamped shut.\u201cYou must be the old man who used to smear ash on the faces of young hunters.Ahmen, the shaman of Balak.He was the most powerful man in the village, except for the chief, Aquila.He is not well-liked by the young, who dislike old traditions and superstitions, but all the older, more seasoned hunters put their trust in him.The saying \u201cThere are no atheists in the trenches\u201d is true.People who have been through the storms of life are always looking for something to lean on spiritually, and Ahmen understood exactly that.\u201cBy the way, did I mention\u2026\u2026 Ahun was the son of that old man?Ahun, the young hunter who always wears his heart on his sleeve, looks uncomfortable over there, and I can see Ahmen\u2019s feelings echoed in his face.Apparently, he doesn\u2019t like Aquila\u2019s recognition of Vikir.And there\u2019s no way Aquila doesn\u2019t know that Vikir has noticed.\u201cHey, shaman.\u201dAquila turned his head to look at Ahman.\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes, Chief.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t like that I\u2019ve accepted that boy as a member of the tribe?\u201dAquila asked bluntly.Ahmen may be powerful in the tribe, but a chieftain\u2019s authority is absolute.He immediately recognizes the hint of vulnerability in Aquila\u2019s words and bows his head deeply.\u201cOf course not, it\u2019s just that I\u2019m a little concerned about blood of Imperial origin being transfused within the tribe.\u201d\u201cThat is not for a shaman to worry about. All you have to do is make sure the rains are good when they come, the prayers are good when the warriors go hunting, the fires are good when there\u2019s a war, the memorials are good when there\u2019s a death, and the wards are good when there\u2019s a plague.\u201dAt Aquila\u2019s cut-and-dried words, Ahmen bowed his head deeply.Behind him, he could see Aiyen clucking his tongue.Well, whatever.Aquila recognized Vikir\u2019s contributions to the hunting frestival and raised his status to official tribe member.Aquila glanced down at Vikir\u2019s limp body.\u201cYou seem to have recovered quite a bit, I can\u2019t believe how quickly.\u201d\u201cThanks to your care.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s done. I didn\u2019t take care of anything. If I have any virtue, it\u2019s in my daughter.\u201dAquila glanced away and looked at Aiyen, who stood against the wall.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAiyen glanced away from her mother\u2019s gaze and whispered something else.Finally, Aquila spoke up.\u201cNow that you are officially a member of the Balak, tell me what you want. You are one of my own, and I have not been able to give birth to and raise you, so I will give you something in return.\u201dWhen she had finished, Aquila spoke softly.\u201cThere are many eligible young women in the village. If you wish, I will find one of them and claim her as your mate. Or a slave, if that\u2019s not what you need. I have quite a few girls from other tribes that I\u2019ve captured as prisoners of war.\u201dThere was a brief murmur from outside the tent.It was the chatter of the village women who had been lined up outside the chieftain\u2019s barracks since dawn.But Vikir shook his head.\u201cI appreciate the offer, but the mate is fine.\u201dWives and female slaves alike were being offered to increase birth rates, a ploy to capitalize on the human tendency to settle where children are born.When Vikir rejected the offer, Aquila seemed to consider for a moment.\u201cHmm. You don\u2019t want a woman, do you? That\u2019s unusual. Most of the men among the outsiders want women.\u201dIn truth, most of Balak\u2019s people were good-looking and beautiful.Their bodies were built for hunting and training, and their eyes and hair were unusually healthy and vibrant, unlike those of other tribes.The warriors of the Balak are unusually attractive compared to the other tribes of the Barbarian.Thanks to the occasional transfusions of blood from the outside world, they\u2019ve never developed inbreeding diseases.Perhaps that\u2019s why invaders from the outside often targeted Balak maidens.Of course, almost all of them are reduced to wolf\u2019s food by her arrows. \u2026\u2026Meanwhile, Aquila wrinkled the corners of her nose a little. She seemed to be thinking.\u201cSo, what do you want me to give you, half of the oxbear hide you caught?\u201dOxbear hides are a very valuable treasure.Vikir almost jumped out of his skin when he heard the offer to cut it in half.Cutting an animal\u2019s hide in half reduces its value to one-tenth of what it is worth, and as someone who knows value, that\u2019s not something I want to see.Just then.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dVikir felt a gaze shoot to his side.Aiyen was glaring at him intently.\u201cYou didn\u2019t forget what I told you, did you?That look, the look that spoke with her eyes.Aquila glanced sideways at her daughter, as if she were not used to seeing her like that.Aiyen is still furiously sending signals to Vikir, unaware that Aquila has seen her.Eventually, Vikir speaks up, as Aiyen had urged him to before.\u201cMaterial rewards are fine. However, I was wondering if you would be willing to take a bath in the Fountain of Valor?\u201dBefore answering Aquila\u2019s call, Aiyen had insisted that Vikir mention this as his desired reward.For the first time, Aquila frowned.\u201c\u2026\u2026hmm.\u201dIf even Aquila, who was quite friendly with Vikir, could react like this, what about the others?Most of the old men swallowed their grunts in disgust.Shaman Ahheman, who was in the front row, snapped.\u201cYou fool! Who are you to speak in front of me?\u201dAs if he couldn\u2019t take it anymore, Ahheman strode forward and knelt before Aquila.\u201cChieftain! For generations, it has been only the proud warriors of Balak who have been allowed to bathe in the Fountain of Valor!\u201dThe murmuring around them grew louder.Ahun, standing at the entrance to the barracks, spoke sarcastically.\u201cThe Fountain of Valor is only for those who have proven their strength. How dare you.\u201dAiyen, standing on the other side, spoke up.\u201cVikir has already proven his strength. He captured an oxbear and submitted it to this hunting festival!\u201d\u201cHmph. I guess I was just throwing rocks at him from behind when he was hunting.\u201d\u201cAnd you have a back like that from being hit by a rock?\u201dAhun\u2019s body began to shake as Aiyen gestured to the bandages and casts wrapped around his waist.At Aquila\u2019s question, Vikir thought for a moment, then nodded.\u201c\u2026.The Fountain of Valor. Do you know what it is?\u201dIt is a small spring that flows deep beneath the waters of Balak\u2019s holiest site, the Tomb of the Champions, where only the bravest and strongest of Balak\u2019s greatest warriors are buried.It was said to be blessed by the great ancestors and to cure all internal wounds and traumas by simply taking a dip.However, the water level is very low, the water takes a long time to collect, and the effects are halved if too many people enter, so the Balak only allow access to warriors who have earned special recognition from generation to generation.\u201cPatriarch, that\u2019s too much to ask for, how can you allow an outsider who\u2019s only just arrived to enter the holy grounds\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cStill, he\u2019s quite the prospect, having captured an oxbear, so it might not be a bad idea to motivate him for once.\u201d\u201cNonsense! Since when did the Fountain of Valor become a place where anyone can soak in it!\u201d\u201cHeh, but he doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s even grown up, so we should be nice to him since he\u2019s part of the family.\u201dThe elders around him are also arguing.Some looked favorably on the capture of the oxbear at a time of need for the entire tribe, while others did not.Aquila was secretly tempted to grant Vikir\u2019s request, but she was certainly a little too weak to use the oxbear hunt as a justification.Some, including Aheman, were less than enthusiastic about having Vikir as a member of the family in the first place, and were even more adamantly opposed to the Fountain of Valor.Aquila wanted to grant her daughter\u2019s petition if she could, but it was a bit of a dilemma with the shaman and his unfriendly forces so strongly opposed.Just then.Ding, ding, ding, ding.A loud bell suddenly rang out from the top of the watchtower that stood on the border of the clan\u2019s enclosure, the village.At the same time, a watchman shouted.\u201cThe outsiders have arrived!\u201dSomething had happened in the village.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No one would challenge Balak to a fight unless they were a high level demon.Outside the borders, there was no one who could stand up to Balak, except perhaps the Baskervilles or the Morgans.Even the cannibalistic Lokoro tribe was no match for Balak.How could a tribe of only 300 people declare war on the Empire, much less their neighbors?It would not be an exaggeration to say that Balak had no one to look out for in the continent, except for \u2018Madame Eight Legs\u2019, who reigned as a local nightmare.\u201c\u2026\u2026Then who is the intruder?\u201dVikir asked, and Aiyen rose from his seat and drew back the curtain at the entrance.\u201cIt would be quicker to see with your own eyes.\u201dAs she spoke, Vikir turned his gaze toward the outside of the barracks.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dThere was a rather unexpected sight.White-skinned, blond, jet-black, and blue-haired people.All dressed in clean clothes and speaking in a familiar language, they were clearly Imperials.\u201c\u2026\u2026Houses of Bourgeois.Vikir frowned, though only slightly.The Seven Houses of the Empire.The Baskervilles, represented by swords, the Morg, represented by magic, and the other five are the Seven Pillars of the Old Country, sworn to the Emperor\u2019s service.The Bourgeois family was a tycoon family that had amassed a great deal of capital through trade and commerce, and was one of the Seven Families, along with the Holy House of Quavadis and the Poisonous House of Leviathan.Then.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve been here.\u201dAiyen\u2019s blunt words broke Vikir\u2019s reverie.Her expression was a slight frown.Merchants from house of Bourgeois are known for doing whatever pays the bills.They\u2019d probably come this far underborder with supplies to trade with the natives.Aiyen didn\u2019t look too impressed with them.\u201cThis is actually not necessary. they are selling something that is not here, psychologically this makes us feel like we will regret it if we don\u2019t buy it\u2026I\u2019m not suited with those kind of merchants.\u201dAnd to a certain extent, Vikir agreed with her.Before the regression, Hugo had a saying about bourgeois families.\u201cThere are fools who think money is power. They\u2019ve never known what real power is.There was an undisguised contempt and irritation in his voice.He didn\u2019t like the idea of the Bourgeois who proudly boasting in the rich land in the capital of the empire while the Baskervilles were fighting bloody frontier battles with barbarians on on the borders of the empire.What\u2019s more, the fact that he\u2019s sneaking into their territory and trading with their enemies, the barbarians, doesn\u2019t make him look good.The other families were similar in their dislike of the bourgeois, but it was ironic that they had no choice but to do business with them.Diplomacy, trade, commerce, real estate, banking, and all other aspects of the empire\u2019s monetary economy were influenced by the Bourgeois.\u201cBut how did they get here?\u201dVikir looked bewildered.If the Bourgeois were to send merchants this way from their seats on the ecliptic of the Empire, they would essentially have to pass through the territory of the Baskervilles or the Morgans.Especially to reach the depths of these border, they would need to procure large amounts of supplies, and that would be impossible without the help of the locals.There was only one thought in Vikir\u2019s mind.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Smuggling.They had trespassed on the Baskervilles\u2019 property and made their way to the border.And they had most likely smuggled themselves in via Underdog, the city closest to the border.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThey made their way to the center of town and began to unload their cargo while Vikir stood still and watched the merchants of Bourgeois Avenue.\u201cNow, as usual, it\u2019s a five-day market. We came here first, before the other tribes!\u201dThe merchant, who came from a bourgeois family, was a middle-aged man with a long mustache.Sir Smuggler.He had a gentle and kindly appearance, but the greedy gaze in his eyes was unpleasantly scanning the bodies of the young Balak maidens on display.Soon, the merchants began to pull various items from their packs and distribute them to the natives around them.They were cheap glass beads, brooches, whistles, perfumes and cosmetics of shiny materials, and, to my surprise, the Balak warriors accepted them with a twinkle in their eyes.\u201cHere, free, free, try these!\u201dThe merchants gave away all sorts of goodies to the locals.The middle-aged women and older men were especially excited.\u201cHere are some glass beads that you can put in your bed to help you have good dreams, please take one.\u201d\u201cHere are some perfumes, ladies!\u201d\u201cThere are also cosmetics, cosmetics!\u201dThe glass beads not only sparkled, but also gave off a nice scent.Neither did the perfume nor the cosmetics.The natives were accepting them, as well as me, because they are hard to smell in the barren jungle.Soon, the merchants who had attracted people by handing out freebies began to sell their products in earnest.They were mostly grains and vegetables, things that could not be grown in the jungle.The prices the traders demanded from the native Balak, who did not use currency, varied.Animal skins, bones, teeth, rare parts such as gums and antlers, and forest products such as precious mushrooms, spices, and medicinal herbs.Sometimes, gemstones or gold.When Vikir saw it, he thought to himself.\u201cWhat a rip-off.\u201dIndeed, the natives of Balak were trading their diamonds for the merchants\u2019 corn.For the natives of Balak, it was a profitable trade, turning worthless rocks into edible grain, but for Vikir, who knew how much they were worth\u2026\u2026, it was unbelievable.Then.\u201cWait!\u201dAiyen stepped forward.Her eyes flickered between the diamonds and the corn.Then she stood between the girl with the diamonds and the merchant with the corn.\u201cThis is an unfair trade,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s ridiculous to trade a diamond for a kernel of corn.\u201dAs Vikir listened to her, he thought, \u201cRight!Aiyen had some bones to pick, and he should be able to stop this unfair trade.But.\u201c\u2026\u2026You should get at least two bags of corn.\u201dAfter speaking, Aiyen looked back at Vikir and gave him a victory sign with his finger.Vikir sighed lightly.She may be an accomplished warrior, but she knows nothing of the world outside the Empire.The natives of Balak were a bit rough around the edges, trying to devalue the merchants\u2019 wares, but well, \u2026\u2026 Vikir thought.\u201cHmmm. Hmmm. This radish isn\u2019t very sweet. I don\u2019t think I can trade for a pearl clam, at least I\u2019ll take two radishes.\u201d\u201cDamn it, did you bring this cabbage too? It\u2019s wilted and bug-eaten in so many places! This is why I can\u2019t give you a whole pair of antlers. You\u2019ll have to take one!\u201d\u201cDo you know how hard I\u2019ve been drying these otter skins, you should give me at least two more potatoes!\u201dEveryone is a haggler.In the empire, the value of crabs, antlers, otter pelts, pearl shells, diamonds, wolf teeth, and bear bones are traded for sweet potatoes, potatoes, corn, radishes, barley, cabbage, and more.\u201cOh no, we can\u2019t afford to lose to Balak\u2019s warriors.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid you can\u2019t keep raising the price of your goods like this, but I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019ll meet your demands this time, Nene. You\u2019re a good bargainer~\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t have anything to offer, either.\u201dThe merchants quickly take the natives\u2019 goods, even though they are grumbling.Soon enough, the agricultural products-potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, cabbage, radishes, carrots, barley, and rice-are gone, along with cheap glass beads, brooches, and perfume.In their place were deer antlers, mushrooms, sea turtles, ivory, bones and skins of all kinds, peony, reishi, matsutake, jewelry, gold, and the hatchlings and eggs of small and rare beasts.The merchants pretended to be calm as they looked at the goods piled high on their carts, but inwardly they were jumping for joy.I wonder how many tens of thousands of times this is.When the trade was finally over, the merchants\u2019 demeanor became arrogant.They saw more goods than they could carry in their carts, and now they began to accept goods based on their merit.Then.A girl stepped forward.She could not have been more than twelve years old. She was pretty, with dark hair and dark eyes.She carried several plump caterpillars, carefully roasted on twigs.They were a delicious and prized food among the Balak natives.The girl held out the caterpillar skewers and said to the merchants of Bourgeoisie Street.\u201cExcuse me, can I get a glass bead?\u201dBut the merchants\u2019 attitude was cold.\u201cThere\u2019s a glass bead, but what\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cThis is the caterpillar of a sunbeetle.\u201dSeveral of the younger Balak children looked at the skewer of caterpillars the girl was holding and gave her an envious glance.The caterpillar was a rare insect that tasted unusually like a mixture of milk and egg yolk, and it was worth a lot of money.However, the merchants of Bourgeois Avenue looked at the girl\u2019s caterpillar skewer with disdain.\u201c\u2026\u2026Wow, you\u2019re not giving this to me to eat, are you?\u201d\u201cHaha, kid, that\u2019s for you brown-skinned people. White people don\u2019t eat that stuff.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re black as a dung beetle. Hahaha!\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you give me something else instead of that, like showing me up your skirt.\u201dThey taunt, sneer, and sexually harass the girl in an imperial language she can\u2019t understand.Boom!One of the vendors shoves a skewer of caterpillars out of the girl\u2019s hand.She drops the caterpillars to the floor.She couldn\u2019t understand what the merchants were saying, but she could at least guess the meaning of their jeers, scorn, mockery, and lustful glances.Just then.\u2026Jaw!A boy picked up a skewer of caterpillars that had fallen to the floor and devoured them in one bite.Vikir.He stood in front of the merchants, gulping down the caterpillars in his mouth.His face and body were covered in black charcoal dust, as if he had just spent the night in an open fire.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe girl looked up at Vikir, panicking.Vikir patted her on the head, then turned to look at the merchants.He spoke in a fluent Imperial tongue that stunned the merchants in front of him for a moment.\u201cThis trade is invalid.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

These, these words are just\u2026\u2026\u201dAll of the people who were just having a nasty conversation about the color and sexuality of the Balak natives look away.Vikir\u2019s eyes widen as he realizes that if he gets caught talking about the color and sex of the Balak, he\u2019ll be in for a rough ride.Vikir\u2019s expression was nonchalant.\u201cYou mean insulting Balak\u2019s warriors with the color of their skin and sexually harassing a woman?\u201d\u201cHuh! That, that!\u201dThe merchants are flustered.Vikir kept his face expressionless.\u201cNot that it matters now.\u201dIndeed. The merchants were so surprised that Vikir spoke Imperial that they hadn\u2019t thought about what he\u2019d actually said.Void. The whole deal is off.Luckily, the merchants\u2019 goods had all been stacked in one place to be sold, so the natives of Balak could return them to the merchants as they were.The merchants, in turn, can return the piles of forest products to their wagons.Upon hearing Vikir\u2019s words, Aiyen sensed something and stopped all trading.Even the merchants around him looked bewildered.\u201cNo, what\u2019s going on here?\u201d they asked.\u201c\u2018We\u2019re not trading, why do we want to buy and lose money?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t come here every day, how can we\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe merchants protested.Vikir dismissed them quickly.\u201cLosses? Well, if the trade doesn\u2019t happen, who will?\u201dAiyen gave him a puzzled look.She sidled up to Vikir and whispered softly.\u201cLook. There are many people in Balak who are counting down the days until those merchants arrive.\u201dShe was right.Among the natives of Balak, I see a girl crying, an old woman stomping her foot impatiently, middle-aged men and elderly women with wistful looks on their faces.They coveted the merchants and the goods they shared: glass beads, potatoes, corn, and harmonicas, not knowing when they would come again.Aiyen was controlling the trade, as Vikir had said, and they all looked at each other in silent regret.But.\u201cIt\u2019s a good attitude to take care of the villagers, but you need to look out for the other side first.\u201dVikir\u2019s advice continues.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dAiyen\u2019s head snapped up at Vikir\u2019s words, and then.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dAiyen\u2019s expression immediately turned to surprise.While the Balak\u2019s expression was one of lingering disappointment, that of the merchants on the other side was deadly.Extreme nervousness made their hands and legs tremble.Vikir spoke briefly.\u201cAll of your goods are short-lived.\u201dMost of their trade was vegetables and grain.Most of these would spoil or rot on the way back.The Balak, on the other hand, traded medicines, hides, spices, and other things that don\u2019t change in value over time.So if a trade fails, the people of Balak lose very little.The merchants, on the other hand, would have to carry back what they brought, and the value of their goods would have decreased dramatically in the meantime.The merchants shuddered and protested.\u201cIf you do this, we won\u2019t come here anymore!\u201d\u201cBe that as it may. You\u2019re not the only ones who want to come here.\u201dThere was some truth to Vikir\u2019s words.For when he was well enough to return to Baskerville, he would use Sindiwendi to secretly arrange trade with the natives of Balak.The merchants were caught between a rock and a hard place.As they stood there, bewildered, Bikir spoke briefly.\u201cI know how much these goods fetch locally. If you bargain in good faith, we can resume trade.\u201dA glimmer of hope appeared on the merchants\u2019 faces.\u201cHow could a mere child know the local prices?\u201d\u201c\u2018Hah! The Empire\u2019s commercial laws are very strict.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s going to leave a lot of money on the table anyway, so why not leave a little less?\u201dThe merchants chuckle amongst themselves.They decide there\u2019s still room for a few more bargains.\u2026\u2026But.\u201cFour gold.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cFour gold.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s too\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cFour gold.\u201dVikir knew exactly how much the merchants\u2019 goods were worth.He also knew perfectly well what Balak\u2019s goods would eventually fetch if they were to reach the faraway capital of the Empire.He would\u2026\u2026.\u201cI\u2019m the one who set up the underdog city\u2019s commercial code.\u201dVikir had been directly or indirectly involved in countless diplomatic and trade affairs during his time as Deputy Magistrate of the Metropolis.\u201cChess pieces made from the teeth of hellhounds usually fetch around two million gold a piece, with different prices for kings, queens, bishops, and knights, and billiard balls carved from the horns of oxen are all the rage in the ecliptic these days. They fetch five million gold a piece at auction. Natural red ivory, undyed, can\u2019t be had for ten times that price. And then there\u2019s this goblin chanterelle mushroom here, which has recently become a popular ingredient in new medicines and is almost priceless\u2026..\u201dThe merchants just stand there, mouths agape, as Vikir rattles off the exact local price, wholesale price, retail price, distribution margin, etc. of each trade item in fluent Imperial tongue.And then. Vikir finishes his calculations.\u201cI\u2019ll give you a price that\u2019s just right for you, after taking into account transportation, labor, and taxes.\u201dThe asking price is indeed what the consumer wants.Vikir picked up a pair of antlers, a gnome, and a sea god from the pile of Balak trade goods and tossed them into the merchants\u2019 wagon.\u201cThis is as much as you can buy with what you have brought.\u201dOnly a tiny fraction of the pile remained.The merchants\u2019 faces were red with anger, but they had little to argue about.Vikir\u2019s valuation had been accurate, and they\u2019d actually made quite a bit of money.In other words, it was a fair deal, with no one getting the short end of the stick.But for the swindlers, who were expecting to make a fortune, it was a pie in the sky.I can\u2019t help but be upset that the natives of Balak were treated so poorly and only received a fair (?) price.What?It didn\u2019t end there.\u201cOkay, now we need to calculate the damages.\u201dVikir took back the deer antlers, gourds, and sea gods that he had just placed on the merchants\u2019 carts.Then he turned to the merchants and held out his palm.\u201cGive me the money.\u201dAt that, the merchants\u2019 faces went blank.\u2026\u2026Is this a rip-off? look on their faces.But Vikir\u2019s judgment is always based on facts.\u201cI\u2019m asking for severe punitive damages for selling adulterated food and distributing illegal drugs.\u201dThe merchants look stunned.\u201cWhat did we do wrong?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201dVikir stretched out his finger and pointed at the grains and vegetables.Among the piles of produce were pockets of seeds.Vikir reached into the pouch and pulled out the seeds.Thud, thud, thud, thud.Dumping all the seeds on the ground, Vikir picked up a few of them.\u201cYou lightly roasted them to prevent them from sprouting, didn\u2019t you?\u201dSeveral of the merchants turn their heads in surprise.Yes, they didn\u2019t want the natives of Balak to farm and become self-sufficient.They don\u2019t want them to plant seeds and farm for themselves so that they can continue to bring them produce and exploit them.When the natives of Balak realized that these were seeds that wouldn\u2019t sprout, they started coming in droves, looking terrified.Moreover.\u201cAnd you\u2019re distributing cheap drugs that the Empire has labeled illegal. You\u2019re out of your mind.\u201dVikir pulled out the glass beads and brooches the merchants were giving away for free and crushed them in his hands.The glass beads were said to bring good dreams when worn to bed.Passthis\u2026\u2026Inside was a small amount of white powder.It leaked out naturally through the tiny holes on the surface of the glass ball.If you keep it by your side, you will naturally fall asleep and have good dreams.However, it is actually a low-grade narcotic that causes severe damage to the body if left for a long time.The glass beads, brooches, necklaces, perfumes, cosmetics, etc. were all made of similar materials.Vikir\u2019s eyes flashed.\u201cDid the Morg or the Baskervilles tolerate this?It was possible, he thought.It would be good for the Empire in the long run if Balak\u2019s warriors were not only drugged and weakened by cheap drugs, but if they also produced deformed children in the next generation.But Vikir had no intention of acting to benefit the Empire or the Baskervilles.It would be far more beneficial for Vikir to join their side in order to stabilize himself here in Balak\u2019s village and learn archery.Vikir smashed all the glasswork that leaked drugs and picked out all the boiled and roasted seeds.The merchants\u2019 faces grew bluer and bluer with time.Some of the merchants, including Lord Smuggler, were furious.\u201cWho are you to interfere with this? This is a sacred trade, sanctioned by the God of the Forest himself!\u201d\u201cThis is a sacred trade, sanctioned by the God of the Forest!\u201d\u201cEven the shaman of Balak blesses us on behalf of the God of the Forest\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe merchants keep bringing up the forest gods, but that\u2019s only for the natives of Balak, and Vikir\u2019s tan hides his skin color, but he\u2019s still an Imperial, so it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201cIt is not the forest gods who rule here, but the Forest Department of Baskerville.\u201dThe merchants all swallowed hard at Vikir\u2019s nonchalant reply.It was true, but they hadn\u2019t expected to hear it from a native Balak.Vikir poured himself another drink.\u201cIf you continue to whine about your ridiculous superstitions, I will have you brought before the judiciary of Underdog City.\u201dThere is no sound a barbarian can\u2019t make.The merchants retorted, stunned but steadfast.\u201cWe\u2019ve already been inspected for food safety by Underdog City\u2019s Food and Drug Administration!\u201d\u201cThat was done under the previous deputy, and with the new deputy, we\u2019ll have to get the revised laws and go through a new process accordingly. From what I can see, some of the items you\u2019re selling don\u2019t meet the current laws.\u201d\u201cYeah, who the hell do you think you are to tell us what the law is?\u201dThe merchants shouted.Vikir\u2019s eyes widened at that.\u201c\u2026\u2026Do you think I don\u2019t know the laws?\u201d\u201cOf course you don\u2019t! How could you possibly know the new laws that have been added? They are very strict and demanding!\u201dLord Smuggler, the head of the merchants, shouted back at Vikir in a pouty manner.\u201c\u2018What black barbarian knows about the Vikir Special Laws\u2019?\u201dHearing that, Vikir gave a single, dry laugh.But since he couldn\u2019t reveal his identity here, he decided to just assume that his laws were still working just fine.\u201cAnyway, this is the end of this trade. You may consider yourself fortunate that I have not taken your life, and now leave.\u201dIt was Aiyen, not Vikir, who had the last word.She was furious to learn that the secret plague that had been circulating within the village was not a disease, or a genetic disorder, or a curse, but a drug brought in from the outside.Some of the warriors were ready to shoot arrows at a moment\u2019s notice, and the merchants were forced to flee.Naturally, Vikir became the most talked-about man in town for his role in this trade.It was a rare example of a slave turned hero.* * * https://pindangscans.comWhen Vikir returned to his tent after the merchants had scurried away.\u2026Boom!Something flew and landed in front of his tent.It was a smoked boar hind leg.Vikir turned his head toward the direction the meat had come from, curious.There stood an unexpected figure, his face flushed.\u201c\u2026\u2026hmmm. Hmm.\u201dIt was Ahun.He tore his gaze away from Vikir and looked at the distant mountains.\u201cWell, thanks for that. For your help.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dBefore Vikir could respond, Ahun shouted.\u201cHow long is he going to be out of shape? Get well soon, so I can beat the shit out of him\u2026\u2026 or wrestle him!\u201dBy the time he finished, Ahun was red up to his ears.\u201cEat it all and get well soon!\u201dWith that, he turned and walked away.He left behind a large piece of the boar he had killed.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that one?Some mushrooms can cause intense visions and illusions when eaten.If Ahun had eaten it, he might have experienced\u2026\u2026.\u2018Take him somewhere quiet, no mice or birds will know\u2026\u2026.\u2019Vikir was thinking to himself.\u201cHey. Slave.\u201dSomeone taps him on the shoulder.He turns and sees Aiyen standing there with a huge grin on his face.\u201cI\u2019m not a slave anymore.\u201d\u201cNo. You are a slave for life. My slave.\u201dVikir frowns at Aiyen\u2019s insistence.Regardless, Aiyen continued with what he wanted to say.\u201cAhun, that bastard. He\u2019s not the same when it comes to his sister. He\u2019s a nice enough guy for a big brother.\u201d\u2026\u2026Sister?When Bikir gave him a puzzled look, Aiyen explained further.\u201cThe girl you helped today is his sister. Her name is Ahul.\u201dAfter some thought, Vikir remembered a girl named Ahul.The girl in her early teens who had lined up outside the chieftain\u2019s barracks at dawn to become Vikir\u2019s wife.The girl who had been sexually harassed by Merchant when she had brought a sunbeetle larva to trade with the merchants today.Aiyen continued.\u201cAhul has always been weak. I was worried that she was getting weaker and weaker due to an unknown illness, but now that I think about it, it\u2019s probably because of the glass beads brought by those merchants.\u201dHe had a point.If it hadn\u2019t been for Vikir, Ahul would have continued to trade with those merchants, and his body would have gotten worse and worse.She would have become an idler, given birth to a deformed child, or even died.So Vikir\u2019s actions in this trade could be said to have saved all of Balak.\u201cDamn it. I was a fool to let those merchants go. I let them go because it\u2019s a warrior\u2019s shame to kill cowards who don\u2019t resist, but\u2026\u2026 in hindsight, I should have just killed them and gotten rid of them.\u201dAiyen gritted his teeth.Just as Vikir was about to part his lips to say something in Moorish.Hudadak-A Balak warrior rushed over.\u201cA message from the chieftain, all warriors assemble!\u201dThis seems pretty urgent.When Aiyen asked what was going on, the warrior replied.\u201cIt seems that the merchants we chased away during the day are up to something nefarious! They\u2019re coming for us at night!\u201dThen.Aiyen\u2019s expression changed instantly.Vikir hasn\u2019t seen her smile this brightly since he\u2019s been here.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Damn mosquitoes! I\u2019m sick of this damn jungle.\u201dThey grunted in exhaustion.They made their way back to base camp, swatting at the mosquitoes with the palms of their hands as they clung to them with their freakishly long stingers.There, a group of rugged-looking men gathered, waiting for the traders.The furry man in the front row smirked at Lord Smuggler.\u201cBy the looks of your wounds, it didn\u2019t go well, did it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dLord Smuggler didn\u2019t answer, instead shifting his pack nervously.The men nearby chuckled.\u201cSee? The Balak are not to be talked to.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of business is it to trade with such beasts?\u201d\u201cJust kill them and enslave them all. Savages.\u201dThey were a mercenary group of ex-convicts, escaped prisoners, and deserters wanted by the Empire.Lord Smuggler warned the mercenaries.\u201cDon\u2019t take the Balak lightly, they\u2019re not easy to defeat in combat, and you\u2019re new to the region, so you may not realize it\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh never mind, if you\u2019re so scared, why did you bring us here in the first place, didn\u2019t you bring us here to upset the deal if it went bad?\u201d\u201cNo, well, we\u2019ve got escorts from the demons, and we\u2019d rather\u2026\u2026 than go to all-out war with the Balak.\u201dLord Smuggler pursed his lips in concern.But even he, who normally would not have dreamed of an all-out war with the Balak, could not resist the sight of the vast amount of trade goods left behind in the Balak\u2019s village.Even the mercenaries and some of the merchants who were new to the jungle began to raise their voices.\u201cYou can\u2019t just waste money like this! I spent a lot of money in the merchant guild\u2019s auction to participate in this trade!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t we agree to pay for our protection as a percentage of the gross profits of the trade? Do you think I protected you from demons for a pittance like this?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Balak? We ambush them in the dead of night, set them on fire, take their goods, and that\u2019s it!\u201dVeteran merchants who have traded with the Balak a few times know the fears of the Balak warriors.But even they were greedy for the goods they had left behind in Balak\u2019s village.In the end, the vote was close to majority, with a few silent votes in favor.Lord Smuggler spoke, his sword half-sheathed at his waist.\u201cVery well, now that it\u2019s getting dark, let\u2019s go quietly and take inventory, and I don\u2019t think I need to tell you who we\u2019re going to kill first.\u201dThe faces of the mercenaries and merchants around him changed.They see it too. Who ruined their trade today.\u201cYou mean that sneaky little bastard? Okay, we got it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be the first to put a knife in that cocky black kid\u2019s ass.\u201d\u201cBut he didn\u2019t look black to me. His palms were black. Usually black people have white palms, don\u2019t they?\u201d\u201cMaybe he\u2019s from the Empire? That would explain why he spoke Imperial so well.\u201dAll the men, including Lord Smuggler, chimed in at once.Their spears and swords were sharpened, and they were ready to burn everything to the ground.And then.In the darkness, they performed their rituals.Not much of a ritual, really, just a cigarette.Chick.The cigarette was lit.One of the mercenaries takes the cigarette in his mouth and strikes a match to the end of it.Next, the mercenary next to him takes the match and lights a cigarette.Soon, he\u2019s about to blow it out.The third mercenary reaches out and stops him, annoyed.\u201cOh come on, blow out the match, there\u2019s still more to burn.\u201d\u201cCome on, you\u2019re a newbie, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.\u201dThe first mercenary and the second mercenary sneered at the third mercenary.\u201cDon\u2019t you know that there\u2019s a saying in war that a single match shouldn\u2019t be shared by three people?\u201d\u201cWhat? Is there such a thing?\u201d\u201cThere is. A match can only be lit by two people.\u201dThe third mercenary snorted.\u201cI don\u2019t believe in that shit.\u201dHe quickly puts the cigarette in his mouth to the match, fearing it will go out.The next moment, the match that ignited the three cigarettes goes out.\u2026Puck!A dull sound echoed through the darkness.The third mercenary\u2019s cigarette was gone. And his head, too.The first mercenary and the second mercenary stood there, covered in a hot liquid that splashed into their faces.Blood. The blood of their decapitated comrades.Before they could even realize it.\u2026Puck! \u2026Puck!Two more arrows flew by.The arrows were aimed at the cigarettes and struck the mercenaries squarely in the mouths or throats, separating their heads from their bodies.\u201cHic!?\u201dLord Smuggler quickly threw the cigarette to the ground.Then.\u2026Puck!The cigarette on the ground was instantly struck by an arrow.The arrows were powerful enough to blow up the surrounding area upon impact, and they rained down from the darkness of the water like a shower of rain.\u201cCigarettes! Drop the cigarettes!An arrow lodged in the mouth of the mercenary captain, who was shouting instructions.The mercenary captain lost most of his head, saving only his uvula and lower jaw, and collapsed to the bottom of the floodwaters.Anyone else who screamed, even for a moment, at the suddenness of the situation was struck by arrows in the mouth and throat.The mercenaries, who had numbered over a hundred, were quickly cut in half, then in half again.In a matter of seconds.\u2026\u2026 Meanwhile.Beyond the rain of arrows, Balak\u2019s archers grinded their teeth.\u201cFirst cigarette, position, second cigarette, distance, third cigarette.\u201dHuntmaster Aiyen ordered.\u2026Ping!Aiyen, who had just sent an arrow flying, turned his head and smiled.\u201cSo there it is. Crazy bastards trying to fight us first.\u201dThe Balak are basically a fighting people.There\u2019s no way they\u2019re going to avoid a fight on foot when they\u2019re the ones who start it in the first place.Aiyen sniped at the mercenaries and merchants in the distance, looking pleased, refreshed, and exhilarated.They had a knack for picking out the most faint of lights, the faintest of sounds.They had a knack for picking out the faintest of lights, the brightness of a cigarette, and driving their flesh into it.The same was as of sound.Whether the words have left the mouth, are still near the uvula, or have not yet departed the lungs, the arrow will always hit the spot where the sound resides.For a moment, Aiyen fired her bow with joy, but then Vikir tugged on her arm.\u201cEnough.\u201dAiyen\u2019s eyes widened.\u201c\u2026\u2026what?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t kill them all. Spare some of them.\u201d\u201cWhy should I?\u201dAiyen frowned. Then he spoke.\u201cYou don\u2019t mean forgiveness or tolerance, do you? Words like that, from a crumbling empire\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cNot that.\u201dVikir held up a hand, cutting Aiyen off.He stared coldly at the few lights flickering in the darkness.\u201d \u2026\u2026I\u2019m saying that because with a group that size, there\u2019s a good chance there\u2019s a backup group.\u201dVikir had purposely left the survivors behind, planning to map out their escape route.And the location of any base camps that might be in the rear.Aiyen paused slightly at Vikir\u2019s demeanor, which was far harder and sharper than her own.Then, a smile forms at the corners of her mouth.\u201c\u2026\u2026Good, I got in.\u201dI\u2019ve never been able to figure out what she\u2019s giving passing marks for, Vikir thought.* * * https://pindangscans.comVikir\u2019s guess was correct.An arrow pierced his shoulder, and Lord Smuggler scrambled to his feet and made his way through a narrow canyon between rock and boulder.Behind him, in a spacious campsite, were the remnants of the waiting mercenaries.A hundred or so men emerged from the barracks to cover the defeated soldiers.\u201cWe\u2019re confident in a hand-to-hand combat!\u201d\u201cArrows will be useless against our shields!\u201d\u201cAura users, come out!\u201d\u201cMages, assemble! Shields to block the arrows!\u201dThere were many mages among the mercenaries, and soon shields were set up to block the arrows.But.\u2026PING!This time, something rather strange began to fly.Several arrows fell from above in a parabolic arc, with ropes hanging from their nocks.And at the end of each of those ropes was a large wooden barrel.\u201c\u2026\u2026oil?\u201dThe mercenaries muttered in despair.A few arrows join forces and bring the barrels down, one by one.Boom! Boom!As soon as they hit the ground or hit the shields, the barrels shatter, scattering wood splinters and spraying oil everywhere.Then a hail of flames began to ignite the oil.Crackle!In an instant, the inferno had completely surrounded the mercenaries\u2019 base camp.Even if they managed to escape the fire, their food, water, medicines, and weapons were all burning inside the barracks, and it was now impossible to escape the jungle alive.Dead.Those who are unlucky enough to be dead, and those who are even unluckier enough not to be dead already, share the same fate.Lord Smuggler was shaking with rage.\u201cTying a rope to several arrows and sending a barrel of oil flying? Do these bastards have such brains?\u201dLord Smuggler had seen Balak\u2019s archers fight many times, but this was the first time he knew they could fight like this.If only he had known how clever his enemies were, he wouldn\u2019t have picked a fight in the first place.Right then.As Lord Smuggler floundered in the flames, something entered his vision.Vikir.He could be seen standing still beyond the searing flames.Lord Smuggler gritted his teeth.\u201cYou bastard, did you set this up too!\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026\u2026should I say you have a keen eye?\u201dVikir said, looking around.All around them were bodies, flames, death, and explosions.It was a mockery that if he had been quicker, he wouldn\u2019t be in this situation in the first place.Lord Smuggler\u2019s eyes rolled back in his head as he heard the words.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you, you bastard!\u201dAt that moment.Vikir picked up something.It was a bow and arrow.Ping-!The arrow, which flew with some force, stuck into Lord Smuggler\u2019s lower abdomen.\u201cUh-huh!\u201dIt hit him in an obscure spot. A spot that wouldn\u2019t kill him immediately, but would still be quite painful and deadly.\u201c\u2026\u2026Gosh, I wasn\u2019t exactly aiming for that.\u201dVikir cleared his throat apologetically.He\u2019d learned archery from Aiyen, but he still felt he wasn\u2019t good enough.Kirik.Sorry is sorry, and regardless, Vikir draws another shot.Lord Smuggler stretched out his bloodied hand and waved it in anger.\u201cNow, wait a minute, you can\u2019t kill me, or you\u2019ll be terribly sorry! I\u2019m serious!\u201d\u201cWhy is that?\u201dVikir asked, and Lord Smuggler dug into his bosom and pulled out a bloody piece of paper.\u201cThis, this is a prospecting permit from the city of Underdog! It\u2019s real! It\u2019s not a forgery! It has the stamp of the newly appointed Deputy Magistrate! I have the Baskervilles behind me!\u201dLord Smuggler\u2019s words were true, for now.He was one of the researchers officially licensed to explore.Vikir paused for a moment, then said.\u201cBring it over here.\u201dVikir gestured toward Lord Smuggler.Lord Smuggler winced in pain, but took the bloody license and held it out in front of Vikir.With his other hand, he reached for the dagger hidden in his waistband.Just then.Tsk-tsk.Vikir wiped the tan from his face.At that moment, Lord Smuggler\u2019s eyes widened to tears.\u201cDa, are you\u2026\u2026!?\u201dRecognizing Vikir\u2019s identity, Lord Smuggler was so surprised that he dropped his dagger to the ground.Staring at the blade on the ground, Vikir smirked dryly.Then he said.\u201cI take it back.\u201dHe wiped his fingers across his face and drew an X across the stigma on the permit.The permit became legally invalid in real time before Smuggler\u2019s eyes.Having revoked the permit\u2019s authority by tampering with it himself, Vikir finally throws it into the flames and burns it.At the same time.\u2026Puck!An arrow hits Lord Smuggler right in the middle of his forehead.And then.\u2026puck! \u2026puck! \u2026puck! \u2026puck! \u2026puck!Four more arrows lodge in roughly the same place.Lord Smuggler\u2019s skull was split several times, almost beyond recognition.\u201cHe was a sour one.\u201dAiyen snorted, coming to stand beside Vikir.Just then.\u201cCaptain, it\u2019s time to get out!\u201dAhun called from behind the flames.Aiyen quickly picked up Vikir and carried her like a princess.He climbs onto the back of the wolf Bakira, who is waiting behind him, and they are off like the wind.Behind them, the shouts of the surviving mercenaries and merchants echoed in the air.\u201cThe Balak are coming! They don\u2019t seem to be outnumbered! We have a chance if we give chase!\u201d\u201cHahaha! We\u2019re almost out of flames! The fact that they attacked with fire means they\u2019re not confident in their own strength!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re alive! We just need to retrieve the rest of the supplies! We\u2019re going to counterattack the Balak!\u201dHearing that, Aiyen smirked in disbelief.\u201cIdiots. They think we started the fire for them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026You\u2019ll find out soon enough.\u201dVikir replied coldly.And then.Sssssssss\u2026\u2026The water reacted.The sound of leaves in a wide area being swept in one direction in unison.Something huge was coming through the darkness toward them.Tsutsutsutsutsutsutsuts\u2026\u2026A heavy blackness, even heavier than the darkness, casting its shadow across the water.Explosions, bright lights, and high-pitched shouting erupted from all corners of the merchants\u2019 and mercenaries\u2019 base camps.And there is one being here that seems to respond to the untimely commotion they create.The Madam with Eight Legs.A legendary piece of tales. The moment an untold horror takes an interest in this side.\u201cPut out the fire! If you put out the fire, we can turn the tables\u2026\u2026!?\u201d\u201cCounterattack! If we counterattack\u2026\u2026!?\u201d\u201cHuh? Wasn\u2019t there something on the other side, I just saw something big\u2026\u2026!?\u201d\u201cAaaaahhhh help me\u2026\u2026!?\u201dThe screams die down, one by one. Fading away.Aiyen and Vikir clung to Bakira\u2019s back and ran with all their might.\u2026\u2026.Until they could no longer hear anything behind them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I wanted to.\u201dAiyen still smirked in an unintentional way.She opened her mouth again.\u201cWell, while you\u2019re at it, why don\u2019t you say a few words?\u201d\u201cWhat.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m thinking, ahhhhhhh, that guy over there seems to be an imposter.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I just have a hunch.\u201dAiyen\u2019s instincts, honed by hunting, were so sharp that he could sometimes predict outcomes without any evidence or foreshadowing.Vikir agreed with Aiyen.The only difference was that she was able to use her reason, not just her instincts, to spot something fishy about Aheman.He had described the drugs the merchants distributed as a plague, a curse that could only be cured by shamanic rituals.In this way, he established his authority as a shaman and grew his position.This was despite the fact that his granddaughter, Ahul, was suffering from complications from drugs.Also, Vikir still remembered what the merchants had said so casually the last time.\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing! This is a sacred trade!\u201cThis is a sacred trade, bowed to by the God of the Forest!\u2018Even the Shaman of Balak blesses us on behalf of the God of the Forest\u2026\u2026!The last one cut off mid-sentence, but the sharp-eyed Vikir had already gotten a sense of what was going on.Vikir translates the merchants\u2019 words into Imperial, and Aiyen\u2019s eyebrows shoot up in unison.\u201cWe can\u2019t let this bastard get away with this! I treated him like a freebie, and now he\u2019s stuck with a foreign power\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cCalm down. You\u2019re still just mad. You don\u2019t have any hard evidence.\u201d\u201cThen you\u2019re just going to stand by and watch!\u201dAiyen\u2019s heart pounded, and Vikir spoke up after a moment of silence.Vikir spoke in a low voice, and Aiyen\u2019s eyes narrowed as he listened.\u201d \u2026\u2026You want me to do that?\u201d\u201cYes. If we wait a little longer, it will reveal its own tail.\u201d\u201cHmm. That doesn\u2019t sound like a bad plan.\u201dAiyen thought for a moment.But it was not in her nature to think for long.\u201cI see. I suppose nothing is lost by doing as you say. Let\u2019s just focus on what\u2019s important right now.\u201dVikir nodded at Aiyen\u2019s words.As she said, getting her body back on track was the most important thing right now.* * * https://pindangscans.comAfterward.Night came, and a beautiful full moon rose.The jungle seemed to have forgotten yesterday\u2019s bloodshed in a single day.As the bright, round moon rose, Suhai opened his mouth as if to swallow it.Sssssss\u2026\u2026A light breeze rustled the leaves.Then, with a strange shifting of the earth\u2019s crust, the rock cracked and hot water began to bubble up from beneath it.The Fountain of Valor.Blessed by Adonai, the archer god of Balak\u2019s distant past.It is a holy place that few of Balak\u2019s warriors are allowed to enter.Vikir stood alone in front of it.In the depths of the hot, steaming waters, some sulfurous gas seems to be boiling.In the shallows, some small animals were the first to arrive and take a dip.They didn\u2019t move as Vikir approached.There seemed to be an unwritten rule that animals entering the hot springs here, regardless of their food chain, did not bare their teeth to each other.Vikir took off all his clothes.He closed his eyes, pushed aside the rabbits, hares, and hedgehogs that were crowding his body, and sat down.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe effect was truly eye-opening.As I entered the hot spring water, my internal body was quickly stabilizing.\u201cThat old shaman wasn\u2019t fussing for nothing, I guess he wanted to come in.\u201dHis mana became more pure, and the bones and muscles in his body settled into place.Perhaps Baskerville had a similar effect to the River Styx flowing within it.The Spring of the Valor is only slightly less effective than the River Styx, but the better part is that there is no age limit on its use.The only downside is that it\u2019s only available once or twice a year, on full moon nights.As Vikir soaked in the hot springs, he thought about this and that.It had been a while since he\u2019d been here.I wonder how Baskerville is doing without him, how the Underdog City is doing.\u2026\u2026Well, probably very well.\u2018Though Mr. Chihuahua is probably throwing a tantrum.Vikir smirked and turned away.At that moment, something completely unexpected came into view.Something so unexpected that even the mighty Vikir was stunned.\u201cSurprised?\u201dBefore he knew it, Aiyen was soaking in the hot springs beside Vikir.She leaned forward toward Vikir, smiling broadly, not wearing a single thread of silk.Seeing this, Vikir thought to himself.\u2018Even I, who have lived through the Age of Destruction, did not sense her approach. I must learn this stealthy move.It would serve him well in the future.While Vikir mulled over his strategy.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAiyen sighed, disappointed at Vikir\u2019s lack of response.\u201cHave you become such a man that the sight of a woman\u2019s nakedness has no effect on you?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you go around naked all the time?\u201d\u201cNot quite. There\u2019s a difference between naked and barely covered.\u201dWhat\u2019s the difference?Bikir didn\u2019t know what to say in response, so he simply turned his head back in the direction he\u2019d come from.Then, slipping up beside him and leaning back, Aiyen held up a flask and spoke.\u201cGive thanks to Adonai. He found this hot spring.\u201d\u201cAdonai. I recognize him.\u201d\u201cYeah? No wonder. She was the only one who could stand toe-to-toe with the \u2018Madame\u2019. Now that you are a young Balak, you should have respect for him. And be proud to be his descendant.\u201dVikir was struck by the words in two ways.The first was that the Balaks viewed the concept of descendants not in terms of blood, but in terms of spirit.The second was that the archer Adonai was able to take on Madame Eight-Legged.\u201cAn archer who can fight that monster single-handedly.How high a level does one have to be to be able to do that, which is still a long way off for the current Vikir.Then.Aiyen turned her head.The tip of her clever nose was within inches of Vikir\u2019s shoulder.Aiyen spoke, her face flushed with alcohol.\u201cThose merchants.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cI knew they were going on a rampage.\u201dAiyen\u2019s face turned even redder as he remembered bargaining for diamonds and two ears of corn.\u201cI had a vague idea, but it\u2019s nice to get a good kick in the ass this time. I\u2019m not used to getting my ass kicked. Even if you hadn\u2019t told me, I\u2019d have flipped it at some point.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dVikir gave a small laugh.Then Aiyen frowned.\u201cDon\u2019t laugh. I knew it. It\u2019s common knowledge that diamonds cost more than corn in the Empire.\u201d\u201cHow much more expensive do you think it will be?\u201dVikir asked, and Aiyen rolled her eyes for a moment.Then, she spoke, sounding slightly unconfident.\u201cOne diamond\u2026\u2026 is worth at least ten ears of corn, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cOr twenty?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Thirty?Bikir laughed.When he told Aiyen how much a diamond was worth in the empire, and how many ears of corn it was worth, Aiyen was horrified.\u201cYou\u2019re crazy,\u201d he said, \u201ca piece of stone is worth nothing, and corn is edible!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it pretty when it glitters?\u201d\u201cMore sparkling than the dawn dew.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard, so it lasts forever.\u201d\u201cIf you scratch it, it breaks, if you hit it, it splits, if you set it on fire, it burns. What is eternal?\u201dAs Aiyen spoke, even Vikir was at a loss for words.What is it that makes the difference between civilization and barbarism?Vikir pondered for a moment, something he didn\u2019t usually do, on such trivial matters.Meanwhile.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhile Vikir was lost in thought, Aiyen was thinking about something else entirely.In fact, she was going to see this through to the end tonight.It\u2019s a bit of an ego thing to ask someone to pick you as a mate, so I wanted to do something naturally(?) in a natural(?) place and in a natural atmosphere(?)., and just go through the motions.\u2018He\u2019s cleaned up, his reputation in the village is good, he\u2019s not bad for a husband, and he\u2019s going to stay there today and heal his body so that he\u2019s good enough for his family, and then the rest will take care of itself.\u2019Her mother, Aquila, had given her similar advice.So Aiyen had taken the plunge and brought her favorite drink to bathe beside Vikir.But.\u201cBut doesn\u2019t your presence halve the mystical effects of the hot springs? Why did you come in? Surely the chief said only I should come in?\u201dVikir is now sitting there arguing about this.Aiyen blurted out in disbelief.\u201d \u2026\u2026Does it matter now? A true Balak doesn\u2019t argue about such trivialities.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, but I\u2019m just asking, not arguing, but just to be sure. If you don\u2019t want to answer, you don\u2019t have to.\u201dBikir replied with a nonchalant expression, and when he turned away again, Aiyen\u2019s brow rose.\u201d \u2026\u2026Show me what it is to be sure?\u201dA moment.\u2026Boom!There was a splash.Aiyen jumped to his feet and snapped at Vikir.Vikir\u2019s expression was still nonchalant, but his pupils were dilated with a hint of surprise.Seeing that, Aiyen grinned wickedly and climbed on top of Vikir\u2019s body.\u201cYou shall remain still, slave.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThis master will take care of\u2026\u2026.\u201dAt that very moment.A crackle, a crackle, a crackle!A myriad of splashes erupted from beyond the spring.A few shadows begin to creep through the steam.\u201cWow- it\u2019s the Master!\u201d\u201cBrother Vikir!\u201dA group of children began to rush in from nowhere.\u201c????\u201dAiyen looked up, dazed.Vikir, pinned beneath him, turned his head as well.Balak\u2019s children had been swarming into the hot springs for some reason.Each and every one of them was sick from the side effects of the drugs the merchants were selling.Naked, the children scurried toward Aiyen and Vikir.\u201cMaster, let\u2019s play!\u201dAiyen cried out.\u201cHey, you two, you\u2019re halving the mystical effects of the hot springs! Who told you to come in here!\u201d\u201cThe patriarch-oh!When the children replied in a stammering voice, Aiyen slapped her forehead with the palm of her hand.He was being played by his mother.Even by her mother.\u201cYou\u2019re talking differently. You said earlier that a true Balak doesn\u2019t argue about such petty matters\u2026\u2026\u201dVikir pointed out with a serious face.Aiyen sighed deeply.The children were already playing with the rabbits, hedgehogs, and squirrels that had come in earlier.Vikir is soaking in the hot springs, just trying to recover.Aiyen, having given up on everything, opened his arms to Vikir.\u201cWelcome to officially become a member of the Balak.\u201dHe doesn\u2019t know what else to say.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Crazy summer. Winter. Crazy winter.Beyond the vast expanse of water, beyond the forest, the seasons have changed many times.And here, in a quiet meadow at the beginning of the season.\u2026Puck!A dull noise is heard.A Balak warrior, probably in his late teens, winced, clutching his nose.\u201cOh, my nosebone!\u201dHe grunted, his nose dripping with blood. It was Ahun.And in front of him stood an impassive-looking man with an extended fist.Tall, black hair cropped casually, cold eyes, and pale skin.Vikir stared down at Ahun with a grim expression.\u201cThat\u2019s enough hand-to-hand combat.\u201dHis task complete, Vikir turned away without another word.Ahun grabbed his companion\u2019s hand to help him to his feet.As Vikir walked away, Ahun spat at the back of his head.\u201cYou bastard, you\u2019ve become more and more of a monster since you\u2019ve been restored.\u201dThe others around him snickered.\u201cYou used to be a great fighter. Nowadays, your bow skills are amazing. From what I\u2019ve heard, you\u2019re on par with Captain Aiyen.\u201d\u201cOh, I don\u2019t see how I can compare to Captain Aiyen, and judging by his fist just now, he\u2019s not that great.\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah. Ahun\u2019s nose was bleeding, but that\u2019s something I can handle.\u201dAs his coworkers exchanged giggles, Ahun spoke in a low voice.\u201c\u2026\u2026 it didn\u2019t hit.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe fist. I didn\u2019t get hit.\u201dAhun felt a chill run down his spine.Sure enough, Vikir had extended his fist. And stopped in front of his face.The pressure of the wind that followed was enough to make Ahun\u2019s nose bleed and his bones jolt.\u201d \u2026\u2026 You did this with just the wind from your outstretched fist?\u201dThe others\u2019 mouths dropped open in disbelief.They can only stare blankly back at Vikir\u2019s back, now a tiny vanishing point in the distance.* * * https://pindangscans.comVikir just turned seventeen this year.His face has aged a lot.His short stature grew with each passing day, and his chubby cheeks grew thinner.The 24 months in the water did a lot for Bikir.Not only has his body fully recovered, but he is much stronger in body and spirit.Realizing that Ahun and the other warriors his age were no longer glaring at him, Vikir showed his true strength.\u2026Pow!The magic sword Beelzebub pierced through the arteries of his wrist.The blade had grown thicker and longer. Beelzebub could now pull out nearly a meter.Vikir swung it around, testing out slashes and thrusts.\u2026snap! Qua-qua-qua!The boulder in front of him split in two, and the boulder next to him was pierced with a hole.Vikir\u2019s swordsmanship was quite advanced, considering that it was generally more difficult to deliver a slashing blow than a thrusting one.As soon as Vikir destroyed the two boulders, he sent four more flying.A total of six boulders were destroyed almost simultaneously.Torn, cracked, pierced, impaled, sliced, and split.It was the fierce teeth of a hunting dog that destroyed the rocks.\u201cThe sixth teeth.\u201dYou have mastered the Sixth Teeth of Baskerville.The six teeth that had been rampaging just a moment ago sank back into his wrist, and Vikir cooled the sweat that covered his body.The boiling mana in his body is now spinning at high speed in six circles.With this, Vikir had reached the upper levels of the Perfect Gradient.\u2018But I still can\u2019t get past the Master\u2019s wall.Masters are something.Even though I\u2019m a graduate, I\u2019ve only just gotten there, and at this rate, I\u2019m not even close to where I was in my previous life.It was the forty-year-old Vikir, before his regression, who was unable to break through the Master\u2019s barrier and ended up at the very top of the Graduate.It sounds like a pun, but there was definitely a middle wall between the peak of the graduate and the Swordmaster that needed to be crossed.\u201c\u2018Superior Graduate.\u2019The ability to manipulate liquid auras that were so thick and sticky that they felt like solids.Only by reaching this level could one fully regain the power of their previous life. You will also be able to break through the walls of masters.But aside from reaching the peak of the Graduate, Vikir was confident that he could fight and defeat a Graduate in real life.One weight class above. An ability that allowed him to kill stronger opponents.This was thanks to the protection of the River Styx, which made his bones and flesh tough and hard, the magic sword Beelzebub, and the archery and assassination skills he learned from the barbarian warriors of Balak.\u201d \u2026\u2026 to the peak of the graduate at full power?\u201dBut I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m really good at pushing that hard.And since my real goal is Hugo Les Baskervilles, Sword Master of the House of Baskerville, I\u2019ll have to work harder anyway.With that, Vikir returned to the village.At the entrance to the village, young hunters who were about to go out hunting were waiting for the blessing of the shaman Ahheman.They still had dark charcoal dust on their faces.It\u2019s a ritual that prevents the spirits of the prey they kill from remembering their faces.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAhheman stood wordlessly, glaring at Vikir as if he didn\u2019t like the late arrival.But that didn\u2019t stop him from giving his blessing to Vikir, who always performed the best when he was out hunting.Malmanama. If he didn\u2019t bless Vikir, and he performed well on his own, it would only prove that the shaman\u2019s blessing meant nothing.Next, Ahheman quickly dusted Bikir\u2019s face with charcoal powder, which he did so sloppily that Vikir\u2019s white skin showed through in spots.\u201c\u2026\u2026Well, the hunting gods will be with you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Thank you.\u201dVikir didn\u2019t really need Ahheman blessing, either, so they parted on good terms.Meanwhile.Aiyen was receiving reports from the returning shift hunters before they went out on the hunt.She listened quietly, with a rare look of seriousness on her face.Vikir approached Aiyen and asked.\u201cAren\u2019t you going hunting?\u201d\u201cMmm. Maybe later.\u201dIt was unusual for Aiyen to reject Vikir.Usually, she would approach Vikir before he could ask or suggest anything, but today she was serious.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dVikir was a little puzzled, but didn\u2019t press the issue.Soon, armed with a worn longsword, bow, and arrows, Vikir sets off into the depths of the marsh without a single wolf to follow.The other hunters pay him little attention, as his simple attire, equipment, and short stature allow him to outperform most other hunting parties.Except for one, \u2026\u2026Aiyen.\u201cIs he gone?\u201dAiyen turned to see that Vikir had completely disappeared.The subordinate who had been reporting nodded and spoke up again.\u201cShall I report back in detail?\u201d\u201cYes. Do so.\u201dAiyen listened, and the subordinate resumed his report.\u201cTo summarize, four things. First, the rainy season is coming.\u201dEarlier, the search party had passed by a stream and spotted an unusual creature.It was a fish called a \u201clungfish.These fish have lungs that allow them to breathe through their lungs, which allows them to stay out of the water for quite some time.Flapping their fins and crawling through the mud, they sleep in deep wet mud during the dry season, only to wake up as the rainy season approaches and the moisture in the air increases.Balak hunters don\u2019t eat meat without scales because they consider it unclean, so they don\u2019t specifically hunt lungfish, but their presence means that the rainy season is coming.The rainy season brought many bad things, such as flooded rivers and plagues, so they needed to be prepared.\u201cSecondly, we found suspicious strangers.\u201dAiyen narrowed his eyes at the next report.They were white-skinned Imperials.He wondered if they were remnants of the merchant and mercenary groups he\u2019d exterminated two years ago, but of course they weren\u2019t.They came in quietly and went out quietly, and the only thing they did was release something at the river\u2019s source.A red liquid in a glass jar.The suspicious men poured it into the river and then slipped back through the jungle.Balak\u2019s warriors captured one of the dogs, who immediately consumed the poison they had hidden in his mouth and killed himself.All he left behind was a dagger with the markings of a single, large snake on it.Aiyen clutched it in her arms. He would ask Vikir what it was later.If Vikir knew anything, he would surely know about this sigil.\u201cThird, an updated report on the Rococo.\u201dThe subordinate continued his report.The Rococo were a rival tribe to the Balak, and just as all of the Balak were excellent archers, all of the Rococo were shamans.Masters of curses and spells, they went by the name of black magic in the Empire.Aiyen frowned.Reports indicated that the Rococo tribe had made few appearances in Balak territory lately.This was strange, considering they outnumbered the Balak by nearly ten to one.Then came the final report.\u201cFourth, a search party from Morg.\u201dIt was this fourth report that caught Aiyen\u2019s attention the most.\u201cHave they come again?\u201d\u201cYes. They\u2019re more frequent than before.\u201d\u201cAnd their commander? The same?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s \u2018her\u2019 again.\u201dAiyen\u2019s face crumpled at his subordinate\u2019s report.For the past two years, Morg\u2019s search parties had been tirelessly scouring the surface.And the leader of the search party has remained the same.Morg Camus.She was almost there.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Aiyen.\u2018Obvious.\u2019I didn\u2019t have to ask, I could relate to her purpose.She\u2019s looking for a man who disappeared two years ago.Vikir.Aiyen remembered the first time he\u2019d met Vikir.The little boy who had saved her from dying in a cage. She hadn\u2019t forgotten his face since then.But when she saw him again, he had another woman in his arms.The woman in his arms was Camus, and she had not forgotten the boy and had come back to this dreadful watery place.He was determined to find him alive, or at least to retrieve his corpse.She searches for Vikir with a strand of hope, an expectation she can\u2019t let go of, and an unfulfilled lament.Her persistence and determination over the course of two years is something that makes Aiyen\u2019s tongue curl.\u201cIf you came for the rubies, you should go back for the rubies. You\u2019re a pain in the ass.\u201dAiyen crossed his arms and was silent for a moment.He was trying to decide if he should tell Vikir this story or not.* * * https://pindangscans.comIn the jungle. Aiyen retraced Vikir\u2019s steps.She soon found him ahead of her, stalking his prey.Aiyen rode up to Vikir on the back of the wolf Bakira.Bikir was measuring the depth of the muddy marks.\u201cMushuhushu, the water snake. It\u2019s a very old and large one. If we catch it, it will feed the entire village for at least three days.\u201dVikir knew his prey\u2019s size, weight, direction of travel, location, age, health, and even its current mood.All of this he had learned from the hunters of Balak.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAiyen stared at Vikir in disbelief.Vikir had changed a lot in the past two years.He still had his cute face, but his aura was much more commanding.Two years ago, he could still pretend to do anything by himself, but now he was more experienced than ever.As such, the boy was definitely becoming a man.\u2018Indeed, the woman of Morg is unforgettable. What a man he is.Aiyen nodded.As the next leader of the hostile faction, but a woman before that, she could sympathize with her sentiments.Aiyen opened her mouth to speak.She didn\u2019t know why, but there was a slight tremor at the end of her voice.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Look, slave.\u201dShe hadn\u2019t stopped calling Vikir that even after he\u2019d been shaved.Vikir didn\u2019t particularly care, so he answered without looking back.\u201cWhat?\u201dAiyen asked, after a slight hesitation.\u201cWhat was it like where you came from?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dVikir was silent for a moment at Aiyen\u2019s question.Where I used to live.Did he mean Baskerville, or the world before the regression?Vikir answered by blurring the two places together.\u201cHell.\u201dAiyen scratched her head at that answer.Then she asked what she really wanted to ask.\u201cDo you want to go back to where you came from?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAt that, Vikir paused and looked back.At this point, Bikir did a small flinch.\u201cWhy do you ask that, and with such a strange look on your face?\u201dAiyen felt a little embarrassed, not knowing what expression she was making.In fact, even at this moment, she was hesitating.Should she tell the story or not? Should she tell him that the Morgans were looking for Vikir?She hesitated, then closed her eyes tightly.She swallowed hard and said.\u201cI don\u2019t want to lie or hide anything.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2018She\u2019 is looking for you.\u201dI said it, finally.Aiyen balled her fists into tight knots.Hiding things, lying, and being watched were usually her least favorite things.And even more so, she didn\u2019t want to do it to Vikir.As she spoke the words out loud, Aiyen felt a mixture of relief and frustration.What if Vikir told her he was going to leave her? Should he do it by the tribe\u2019s laws? Was it even possible?Thoughts raced through his mind.Then.Vikir\u2019s answer came back.\u201cI\u2019m not going back.\u201dA short answer. With those words, Aiyen felt the power that had been so tightly woven into his body suddenly loosen.A warm glow filled every inch of his body as the energy drained away.\u201c\u2026\u2026You, really?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dVikir nodded.Why would he go back?If he went back, he would have fully regained his former powers.At the very least, it would have to be when he could hide his powers perfectly from Hugo\u2019s notice.\u201c\u2026\u2026And who is she?Vikir frowned for a moment.Was he referring to Morg\u2019s Camus?If so, he should be grateful. She still remembers the grace that saved her life.\u2018She\u2019s more loyal than I thought. Or is this some sort of diplomatic gesture?\u2019Vikir closed his eyes and thought about it.If the Morg were looking for her, it meant they were still within Baskerville\u2019s territory.If the Baskervilles were willing to allow Morg\u2019s search party to enter the depths, it would mean that he had not yet been forgotten by his current family.Furthermore, the alliance between Morg and Baskerville would have been strengthened.Perhaps that\u2019s why they have an annual event where they find themselves, formally or otherwise.He could sense that the situation outside was complicated and tense.Sooner or later, Vikir thought, he would have to sneak out of the depths.Just then, Aiyen spoke up, her voice sounding much lighter.\u201cOh, by the way. I have something else for you.\u201dShe pulled an object from her bosom.It was the dagger left behind by the mysterious intruders mentioned in the last report.\u201cDo you know anything about this sigil?\u201dIt was a dagger with a sigil, large snake on it.Bikir\u2019s eyes narrowed at the sight of it.\u201cI know of it. It\u2019s a famous mark.\u201dIt was the emblem of a certain family in the Empire.\u201cLeviathan, the Extremist.\u201dOne of the seven great houses of the Empire, alongside the Ironblades of Baskerville, the Mages of Morg, the Quavadis of Faith, the Bourgeois of Tycoon, and others.But why would it be found here in the depths at this time of year?Vikir\u2019s head began to spin rapidly.\u201cDo you mind if I keep this?\u201d\u201cWell, do as you please.\u201dAiyen nodded readily.Vikir took the dagger with the snake on it.Just then.[gurgling\u2026\u2026 gurgling!]An unpleasant cry came from somewhere.Vikir and Aiyen turned to find themselves in a muddy mangrove forest.A large mass was crawling through the gnarled roots.A lungfish, a fish that breathed with two lungs.It crawled through the mud, its smooth, scale-free body oozing sticky mucus.It was a fish that wasn\u2019t even considered food because of its enormous size, over eight meters long, unpleasant appearance, and cries.Aiyen frowned in disgust.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely the rainy season, with all those things running around.\u201d\u201cIf there are big ones around, it must mean\u2026\u2026 that this rainy season is long.\u201dVikir nodded in agreement.The muddy ground bore the unmistakable tracks of giant lungfish.Aiyen pointed to a rotting, fallen tree.Dozens of meters up in the air, the tree\u2019s rungs hung with dried aquatic vegetation.\u201cLast year, during the rainy season, the water was up there.\u201d\u201cIt might be higher this time.\u201dWhen it rains, the water rises unimaginably fast.The lungfish know this and crawl out from under the mud in advance.The moment.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe eagle-eyed Aiyen had spotted something.He could see something sticking out of the body of the giant lungfish he had just crawled over.It was a harpoon.\u201c\u2018Look at that?\u201dAiyen moved immediately.She shot an arrow through its head, killing it, and then drew a knife and sliced open its stomach.A half-digested human figure emerged from its stomach.Aiyen\u2019s expression hardened.\u201cThey\u2019re Rococo.\u201dBrave men who live on the blood and milk of bears.They were rivals to the Balak and the second most powerful tribe on the depths.They had a cannibalistic culture, and every tribe in the jungle feared them.Except for the Balak.Bikir spoke bluntly.\u201cDoes the fact that they have entered Balak\u2019s territory mean\u2026\u2026 war?\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think so.\u201dAiyen glanced at the harpoon embedded in the lungfish\u2019s body.The harpoon hadn\u2019t been driven in from the outside, but had protruded from the inside out.In other words, the Rococo hunter wasn\u2019t trying to hunt the lungfish, but the lungfish was trying to hunt the rococo hunter.As it swallowed the hunter, the harpoon the hunter was holding pierced the lungfish\u2019s stomach wall and protruded outside its body.But one question remains.Lungfish are big, but they\u2019re also skinny and slow, so they couldn\u2019t have eaten Rococo\u2019s seasoned hunter.Moreover, the condition of the skeleton suggested that the hunter was a young man, perhaps just entering his twenties.Aiyen set her jaw.\u201cI wonder, why was this guy eaten by a lungfish? Lungfish are basically stupid beasts that pick up dead things and eat them.\u201d\u201cHe must have been weak enough to be eaten by a lungfish.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of creature goes out hunting when it\u2019s that weak?\u201dAiyen\u2019s questions were valid.Vikir had a short answer.\u201cOnly if the tribe\u2019s situation is so bad that a man that weak needs to go hunting.\u201dIt could be a stretch.It could be that the hunter was simply weakened by external factors at the wrong time.But the skeleton didn\u2019t show any signs of trauma.Nail scratches on the inside of its esophagus and stomach wall suggest that it had struggled, but with very little force.\u201cI don\u2019t feel right.\u201dAiyen instinctively sensed something was wrong.Vikir and Aiyen began to search the area.Given the extent to which the body had been digested, and the speed at which lungfish travel, there should still be traces of it around.Soon, they began to find traces of the hunter\u2019s life.When he was alive, he had moved around with an unsteady step.He had no idea that this was Balak\u2019s territory, only that he was moving about in a frenzy of activity.There were signs that he was searching for a small, weak beast, or perhaps a tree fruit.This was a stark contrast to the normally valiant Rococo hunters, who usually hunted large beasts.What could have turned the Rococo\u2019s belligerent hunters into this?Vikir and Aiyen continued to retrace their steps.Eventually, they approached Rokoko\u2019s territory.\u201c\u2026\u2026!?\u201dThey both spotted something.Several of Rokoko\u2019s hunters were gathered in a simple campsite.With ancient dark elf blood in their veins, every member of their tribe is known for their beauty.They are skilled in black magic, witchcraft, curses, and command, and their uncanny beauty gives them a unique and sinister aura.As a result, they were an unusually vulnerable tribe to slave hunting.But it wasn\u2019t their appearance or aura that struck Vikir and Aiyen.\u2026\u2026It was the fact that all of the Rococo hunters were dead.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 71": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Return of the Iron-blood Sword HoundCH 70Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 70 \u2013 Blood Relatives (3)All of Rococo\u2019s hunters were dead.Vikir and Aiyen approached through the foul odor and heat of the corpses.\u201cIs this \u2026\u2026?\u201dAiyen\u2019s eyes narrowed.Rococo\u2019s hunters were talkative, even in death.They were screaming with every fiber of their being why they were dead.There were signs of vomit and diarrhea everywhere, signs that they had tried to warm their chilled bodies with bonfires and fallen leaves, and, crucially, red spots on their skin.Aiyen swallowed hard.\u201cSo this is what warriors look like when they come out to hunt.\u201dOnly the relatively healthy would have gone hunting.He had no idea what the condition of those left behind in the village would be.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dVikir led the way.Vikir and Aiyen walked straight through the channel and into Rococo\u2019s territory.Normally, they claim a large radius as their territory and leave markers along the way.They usually hang skulls or corpses to warn trespassers, but strangely, the markers hadn\u2019t been updated.They had been left up for a long time and were already covered in moss and mold, making them hard to recognize.It was uncharacteristic of the Rococo, who were usually diligent about warning off intruders.\u201cSomething must have happened to the village.\u201dAiyen pushed through the Rokoko\u2019s boundaries and headed for the low-lying hills that were their home.There was no sign of life inside the village.Nor was there any smoke, despite the fact that it was past mealtime.At the entrance to the village, Vikir and Aiyen stopped in their tracks.It wasn\u2019t the lack of guards. There were no people wandering around inside the village at all.The haphazardly constructed barracks were empty, their floors overgrown with weeds.Crude household items lay abandoned on the ground everywhere.\u201cWhere did they all move to?\u201dAiyen frowned and walked into the barracks, pulling on his insignia.The moment.Yue Yue Yue-.A huge swarm of flies burst out of the barracks.The stench of filth and rotting meat was overpowering.Inside the tent lay three small children and a woman.They all looked as if they had died not long ago.Vikir walked past the insignia of the other barracks next door.\u201cThe others are similar.\u201dThe natives of Rococo had been exterminated before they could even get out of their barracks.Most of the bodies were rotting and unrecognizable, but the skin of the few that were still in relatively good shape after their deaths was invariably marked with red spots.\u201cWhat is this, a plague?\u201dAiyen said, shaking off the chills that ran down his spine.Jungle warriors are particularly sensitive to poisonous plagues. No wonder Aiyen was so frightened.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir\u2019s mouth fell open, speechless.Now that he thought about it, he had heard of this event before his regression.\u201c\u2026\u2026The Red Death.\u201dThe memory became clearer the more he stuttered.A dreaded plague called the Red Death had certainly been circulating around this time.A class one plague that killed nearly every barbarian and similar in the jungle.It was so widespread that it even reached the borders of the Empire.Once infected, the victims were crippled, lying helpless and slowly dying.Their metabolism is extremely slow, and it takes a long time to die.Red spots would appear all over the body, vomiting and diarrhea would occur, lethargy and pain would overwhelm them, and they would finally collapse and die.The contagion was so rapid that the savages feared that mere eye contact with a sick person was contagious.\u201cHow did they cure it?\u201dBikir searched his memory a bit more. It was so long ago that it seemed to take a moment to recall.Then.\u201cNo, slave!\u201dA hand tugged at Vikir\u2019s collar.He turned to see Aiyen shouting urgently.\u201cQuickly, we must get out of here!\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWhy? It\u2019s a curse! It\u2019s a curse from the gods!\u201dFor once, she was actually scared.Bikir grinned and grabbed her wrist.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s a plague.\u201d\u201cWhat!? That\u2019s even worse! We have to get out of here! This place is cursed! You Rococo bastards, every time you practice your unholy commands, you end up like this\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cCalm down, it\u2019s not that easily transmitted.\u201dVikir glanced back at Rokoko\u2019s village.Aiyen jumped in surprise, but she didn\u2019t run off on her own.She merely shivered, clinging to Vikir\u2019s collar and following closely behind.\u201cUgh\u2026\u2026 ugh. Aren\u2019t we really being cursed?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re so scared, go back first.\u201d\u201cAnd if you die because you\u2019re cursed?\u201d\u201cIf you die, you die.\u201dVikir answered nonchalantly, and Aiyen, who had been trotting along behind him, shouted.\u201cWho cares!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s me,\u201d Vikir thought, but didn\u2019t bother to say it out loud.Well, whatever.After a quick walk around their village, Vikir realized that the Rococo weren\u2019t wiped out.They just seemed to have moved on, leaving their dead and sick behind.\u201cHmm, well. If there were carriers among the survivors, the outcome would be similar no matter where they fled.Vikir sympathized with the survivors, who had been forced to make a desperate choice.But there was no guarantee that they would be safe from the Red Death.Still, this was a chance to learn more about the mysterious life of the Rococo tribe.Vikir searched the Rococo\u2019s barracks, grabbing a few books and other items that seemed important and stuffing them into a sack.They would one day make a great scholarly contribution to the study of the enemy and the barbarian tribes of the Black Mountains.Just then.I heard Aiyen\u2019s screams from outside the barracks.\u201cKaaaaaah!\u201dIt was an urgent scream, and Vikir quickly ran out of the barracks.Then Aiyen\u2019s terrified screams became more pronounced.\u201cThe curse! Cursed child!\u201dA terrible fear of the plague is characteristic of all the natives of depths.Vikir silently shifts his gaze to look in the direction Aiyen is looking.He saw the child standing on the outskirts of the village, next to the smallest and most shabby barracks.\u201c\u2026\u2026Imperial?Vikir squinted.The child did not appear to be from the Rococo.Could he have just turned five?She had black hair, red eyes, and skin as white as snow.She was standing barefoot next to a crumbling, shabby barracks, and she didn\u2019t seem to want to leave.Behind the barracks rose a crude stone cairn that looked like it hadn\u2019t been built for long.A few purple flowers, apparently freshly plucked, lay haphazardly in front of it.\u201cAaahhhh! It must be a ghost, a cursed child of the forest god! We must flee, Vikir! You go first, I\u2019ll be right behind you! Awww, my legs are weak\u2026\u2026!\u201dAiyen was shaking and sobbing.Vikir smiled wryly at the sight of the child he hadn\u2019t seen in the past two years of living together.But aside from that, she felt like she needed to know who this child was.\u201cI can recognize the last of the Rococo tribe.\u201dVikir walked forward and sat down in front of the child, bringing them to eye level.The girl flinched as if frightened, but she didn\u2019t avoid Bikir\u2019s hand on her head.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.?\u201dVikir asked, but the girl didn\u2019t answer, just shook her head.Vikir asked a few more times, but the child didn\u2019t answer.Instead, it listed a few words in a stuttering tone.\u201cRococo. Slave. Kitchen slave.\u201dThe words were a clumsy mix of rococo and imperial.Vikir couldn\u2019t help but think of context in the string of words.\u201cSo you were a slave in the Rococo. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Pomerian.\u201dBikir nodded at the girl\u2019s answer.\u201cYour mother must have given you an imperial name.Pomerian wasn\u2019t a very common name, but it wasn\u2019t a very difficult one either.Either way, it was clear that the girl was from the Empire.Without further delay, Vikir moved on to the next topic.He was just about to ask what had happened to the Rococo tribe.The next words out of the girl\u2019s mouth stiffened Vikir\u2019s body.\u201c\u2026\u2026 la Baskerville.\u201dThe moment. Bikir\u2019s body froze as if struck by lightning.The Baskervilles\u2019 last name, the middle name \u201cLa,\u201d which is only given to direct female relatives.Not many people in the family have been given the middle names Les or La.Bikir\u2019s eyes widened, and the girl tried to hide behind the barracks\u2019 pillars as if frightened.No sound escaped her throat for a moment.That\u2019s what happens when a person is too surprised.Unable to hide his disbelief, Vikir raised his hand and wiped his face a few times.After drying his face, he regained his composure.\u201cChild, come here.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe girl hid behind a pillar, only peeking her head out.Vikir wondered what he could do to calm her down.Just then, Aiyen, who had been in and out of the barracks, threw something at Vikir.\u201cHey. There\u2019s this inside. Ew, it\u2019s not cursed, is it?\u201dVikir took what Aiyen tossed him.It was a small pendant made of gold.The front of the brooch was embossed with the tooth-like symbol of the Baskervilles.Aiyen remembered the Baskervilles\u2019 emblem from the vial of potion Vikir had given her once.\u201cIsn\u2019t that your family\u2019s symbol?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThat lent a little more credence to what the girl had said.Vikir traced his finger across the Baskerville crest on the pendant.The pendant was made in a style that was quite old, an accessory that could only have been fashionable thirty years ago.\u2026Click!Vikir opened the pendant.Inside was a small portrait drawn with extreme precision.\u201cThis?\u201dVikir squinted at the portrait.It depicted a nameless young woman, a young man, and a girl who appeared to be in her early teens.The young woman had beautiful blonde hair and blue eyes, the young man had the dark hair and red eyes characteristic of the Baskervilles, and the girl in between had dark hair and red eyes as well.Vikir recognized the young man in the portrait at a glance.\u201cHugo le Baskerville! No way!It was definitely Hugo as a young man.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How could you not recognize this face?What is it? Why is Hugo\u2019s portrait here?As Vikir stares in disbelief, Pomerian sneaks up on him and tugs on the pendant\u2019s string.With what little strength he has, the tug seems to be a request for the pendant to be returned.Vikir hands the pendant back to Pomerian and asks.\u201cWho are these people in the painting, and what do they have to do with you?\u201dThe Pomeranian flinched at the stern tone, as if interrogating a criminal.Vikir spoke a little softer, wanting to be gentle.\u201cWho are the people in the picture, and what do they have to do with you?\u201dThe words were different, but the tone was the same.The harshness of the tone made the Pomeranian shiver uneasily.Then Aiyen stepped forward.\u201cIf you ask me like that, the I will not give you a good answer.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026? What did I do?\u201d\u201cYou should ask her with a smile.\u201dAiyen\u2019s point made Bikir pause for a moment.Then a wicked grin spread across his face.\u201cWho are the people in the painting?\u201dThe Pomeranian looked up, looking less frightened than he had earlier.\u201cOh, yes, it\u2019s working. You were right\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir turned his head toward Aiyen.A moment.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dVikir\u2019s eyes caught Aiyen\u2019s blank expression.She stood there for a moment, looking into Vikir\u2019s face, before she snapped out of it.\u201cSlave, did you expect me to laugh so hard?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir immediately frowned.He hadn\u2019t smiled widely since he was born, so it was no wonder he was being teased.Then. The Pomeranian answered.\u201cMama. Grandpa. Grandma.\u201dVikir\u2019s mouth dropped open at the words.His head spun rapidly.A pendant, a faded portrait, decades old. Hugo Les Baskervilles and an unidentified young woman and a little girl. A mother and grandmother and grandfather, the Pomeranian said.\u201c\u2026\u2026What?Vikir had a theory.Hugo in the pendant is young. And the young woman next to him was probably his wife.And the daughter they had together, the first born.What if that eldest daughter was kidnapped by the Rococo tribe, and the child she bore here was a Pomeranian?\u2018Come to think of it, I\u2019ve heard that Hugo\u2019s personality wasn\u2019t always as cold as it is now.\u2019I don\u2019t know much about Hugo Les Baskerville when he was in the ecliptic before he came to the Fringes, as Vikir was not yet born.But I had once heard a rumor from old Deacon Barrymore that Hugo had once been very friendly and homey.\u2018I thought it was nonsense at the time and shrugged it off.Vikir takes a moment to recall the history of the Baskervilles.Once based near the ecliptic, the Baskervilles had moved far to the west of the empire, to the fringes of the Red and Black Mountains, not because of a demotion.Hugo Les Baskerville had gone before the Emperor and requested that the entire House of Baskerville move to the fringes.The reason for this was the death of his first wife in childbirth, and the barbarians who had taken his first daughter, whom he loved dearly.This caused Hugo to hate his enemies and the barbarians beyond the Black Mountains with a passion, and he cared for his wife and children little afterward.After this series of events, he became an extremely cold and calculating killer, living only for the slaughter of demons and barbarians.The Emperor deemed him competent and entrusted him with the task of expanding the empire\u2019s borders, and Hugo threw himself even more into his work to forget everything.That\u2019s how Baskerville, Ironblade, was born.And now. A rejected hound of the Ironborn has found an unexpected ally here.Pomeranian. Pomeranian la Baskerville.Penelope, the daughter of Roxana, the woman Hugo had loved more than anything else in his life.And Penelope\u2019s daughter, Pomerian.This means that, if my guess is correct, the girl in front of me is the direct granddaughter of Hugo Les Baskerville.\u2018\u2026\u2026 That makes me an uncle.\u2019It was a strange feeling.Even now, nieces and nephews were being born somewhere, but none of them were girls.This is a Baskerville family where daughters are extremely rare.Come to think of it, there was not a single daughter in Hugo\u2019s direct bloodline.Not even in the entire family.There are plenty of sons.\u201cAnyway, Hugo, he\u2019s the kind of man who only looks for sons and grandsons because he thinks men are more useful in battle.What do you think Hugo, the extreme warlord, the fighting demon, the man who sees his children as nothing more than tools, would do if he saw this tiny, delicate granddaughter?Vikir shook her head.No matter how I think about it, I can\u2019t think of anything but negativity.And with barbarian blood in the mix, he might not be so pleased.Vikir reached out and placed his hand on top of the Pomeranian\u2019s head.The Pomeranian flinched slightly, but didn\u2019t shy away as he had earlier.Vikir spoke in a low voice.\u201cApparently, the Rococo tribe has not been treated well either.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cCome with me.\u201dIf the Rococo tribe had been devastated by the plague and left, Pomerian could not remain here.But Pomerian stood firm, clinging to the pillars of the barracks.Vikir looked up and saw the reason for the Pomeranian\u2019s reluctance to leave.It was the crude stone tomb behind him.As Vikir pondered what to do, Aiyen stepped forward.She bowed her head once in front of the tomb, then spoke to the Pomeranian.\u201cWhen our ancestors leave this world, they go to heaven and become stars. So will your mother.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat lies here in this stone tomb is only a shell, but your mother\u2019s spirit is a star in the sky, looking down on you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cShe wishes you to leave this dreadful place as soon as possible.\u201dThen the Pomeranian raised his head. He seemed to understand not only the Imperial language, but Balak\u2019s words as well.The Pomerian pondered for a moment, then released his grip on the barracks\u2019 pillars.He takes a step toward Vikir.Black hair, red eyes.Vikir and Pomerian looked exactly alike.Pomerian looked at Vikir and said.\u201cMommy. The hair. Eyes. The color. It\u2019s the same.\u201d\u201cYeah. All Baskerville dogs look alike.\u201dVikir picked up the Pomeranian.It was the first meeting of uncle and nephew.* * * https://pindangscans.comAfterward, Pomerian came to Balak\u2019s village.\u201cUncle. Where are you going?\u201dShe clung to Vikir\u2019s leg, unwilling to pull away, which was quite a challenge for a child who was used to being alone.\u201cUncle has to go to a meeting, the chieftain has summoned him.\u201d\u201cAang. Uncle. I\u2019ll go with you.\u201dPomerian seemed scared to be alone.Now that she had left her mother\u2019s stone tomb, she realized that she was truly alone.That\u2019s why she seemed to rely more on Vikir, who had the same hair color and eye color as her mother.\u201c\u2026\u2026I can\u2019t help it.\u201dVikir quickly picked up the Pomerian and carried him on his back.He looked around for something that could be used as a swaddle, and a thick, coarse pelt caught his eye.It was an oxbear pelt, given to me by the chieftain himself as a reward for our successful trade.He wondered what he was going to use the pelt for, but he realized it was for a swaddling bag.Vikir carried the Pomeranian on his back and went outside.\u201cI\u2019ll have to ask the Chihuahua to do it for me \u2026\u2026 later.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t keep this girl in Balak\u2019s village.Even if he didn\u2019t send her to Hugo, she would have to be raised somewhere out of his sight, at least within the reach of Imperial civilization.Vikir made plans to get out of the water and into the city later.\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll pay a visit to Morg, too.\u201dIt might be worth spying on the alliance with Baskerville to see how it was going.While Vikir pondered this, he soon arrived at the barracks of Chieftain Aquila.Upon entering, he finds Aquila, Aiyen, and the other elders, all wearing serious expressions.Aiyen and Vikir are witnesses to the meeting.Chief Aquila asks.\u201cYes. You mean there\u2019s a plague going around?\u201dAiyen and Vikir nodded.The report went on to detail how the Rococo tribe had been wiped out, and the state of their remaining villages.Other hunters also testified to seeing the bodies of orcs, lizardmen, and other apes lying on the ground with red spots sprouting from them.Aquila stroked his chin, a serious expression on his face.\u201cThe rainy season is coming soon, and we\u2019re in trouble.\u201dIf the plague came, the damage would be even worse. We had to find a way to prepare.Then.\u201cChief, it\u2019s not a plague, it\u2019s a curse!\u201dShaman Ahheman stepped forward.He argued that the Red Death was not a disease, but a form of witchcraft that could be cured through sacrifice.There were a few old elders who agreed with him.They emphasized that this was the time for a great ritual, and it was clear that they intended to take advantage of the occasion to greatly increase the authority and power of the shaman.The young people, on the other hand, said that the Red Death was a plague, not a curse, and that it was time to abandon the village and move on.The old and young debated heatedly between superstition and practical solutions.It didn\u2019t seem like it would be easy to decide who was right.\u201cHmmm. What shall we do?\u201dChieftain Aquila was frowning.Someone silently raised their hand to speak.The one who first coined the phrase \u2018red death\u2019.\u201cI know how to stop this disease.\u201dIt was Vikir.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This migration is ridiculous! We have been here for nearly two hundred years!\u201dThere are more than a hundred ancestors\u2019 remains in the holy sites around the village.How they would be managed and cared for if they were to migrate was a key point of contention for Ahmed.But Aiyen, who represents the younger generation, is not backing down.\u201cWhat if the plague comes back and kills all the children? Who will take care of our future then? Who will take care of the future of the tribe when the seeds of the future are gone when we go to collect the remains of our ancestors?\u201dAs it turns out, Balak children do die.Typically, Balak women start having children at age 14 and give birth to a new child every two years on average, which means they will have about ten to fifteen children in their lifetime.The problem is that more than half of them die within the first month of life. Only about 20% of infants survive beyond three years.Most of the children die from malnutrition, childhood diseases, war, and hunting accidents.Add to that the fact that mothers die during childbirth or from the aftermath of childbirth, and the Balak have a much lower birth rate.Add the Red Death to the mix, and there are no answers. There is only a dark future ahead.Unable to bear the sight of her clanmates in the midst of a generational conflict, Aquila spoke up.\u201cThe question is, what path does the Red Death take?\u201dWhat is the Red Death, and why does it cling to humans?Unless these questions are answered, it\u2019s essentially impossible to do anything about it.To Patriarch Aquila\u2019s anguish, answers came from many quarters.\u201cA curse! It must be a curse!\u201d\u201cWrong, it is a plague transmitted through the gaze!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the spirits of your prey retaliating!\u201d\u201cIt must be because you ate a strange looking mushroom!\u201d\u201cThe ancestors are angry because we have neglected their mausoleum!\u201d\u201cThere must be a poisonous insect!\u201d\u201cThe gods have abandoned us, the forest gods!\u201d\u201cThe imperials have brought the disease with them!\u201dThe people of Balak don\u2019t know, but they don\u2019t often say they don\u2019t know.They make a virtue out of giving crappy answers.It was out of the goodness of his heart that he didn\u2019t want to disappoint the person who had trusted him with the question in the first place, but\u2026\u2026 wasn\u2019t helping much in this situation.\u201c\u2026\u2026Hmm.\u201dAquila\u2019s brow furrowed in confusion.Silently, a hand came up.Vikir\u2019s. His eyes met Aquila\u2019s and he spoke.\u201cIf there is a way to stop the Red Death, I know it.\u201d* * * https://pindangscans.comAbout ten days passed after that.Clatter, clatter, clatter.A demon tied to a rope was struggling.A goblin, the smallest and weakest of the demons classified as similar.It was currently hanging upside down with its arms and legs tied to the ropes, being tortured.[Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!]The goblin was being dipped into a large pot of water, pulled out, and repeated.The goblin had been flailing around for a while, but suddenly it became very calm.Soon, red spots began to appear on the goblin\u2019s skin.The goblin drooled and vomited, and stopped baring its teeth.It slowly shudders in anticipation of its coming death.Meanwhile. Balak\u2019s warriors tossed the red-faced goblin into a pile of oiled pyres and set it on fire.There was no room for pity, as the creature was a foul creature that kidnapped and ate human children.Soon, the goblin with the Red Death burned to death.Then Balak\u2019s warriors turned their attention to the next goblin.Before them stood Aiyen, clutching the goblin\u2019s ropes.\u201cVikir. Is the Red Death really transmitted through water?\u201dAt her question, Vikir, beside her, nodded.\u201cYes, it is. Contaminated water is the main culprit. But as long as you boil the water once, there\u2019s no problem.\u201d\u201cReally? Is that so?\u201dAiyen looked at Bikir with a trusting gaze.Then he took another pot of the same water and dipped another goblin in it for comparison.Then.[Cackle!]The goblin died instantly.Vikir put his hand to his forehead.\u201cWhen the water cools, we\u2019ll put him in.\u201d\u201cUgh.\u201dAiyen also hit his forehead with his hand.Soon, the water in the pot was boiling again.When the bubbling water had cooled completely, Balak\u2019s warriors dipped the goblins into it.Ten days passed, the incubation period for the Red Death, but the goblin did not become ill.Then all the warriors of Balak, including their chieftain Aquila, exclaimed in amazement.\u201cWe have found a way to overcome the Red Death!\u201d they exclaimed.\u201cThe answer was in the water.\u201d\u201cYou mean just boiling water and drinking it will stop the plague?\u201d\u201cVikir, you are a hero of our tribe!\u201dThe praise poured in, the looks of respect and admiration.The old are delighted and the young look on in admiration.By nature, Vikir doesn\u2019t like to be the center of attention.But it is Balak custom to be sure when congratulating or praising, and everyone surrounds him, drooling over him.Vikir responds to their praise and gratitude with a wave of his hand.\u201cAnyway. You have to be careful with the water. It can\u2019t get in your mouth or eyes. It can also be infectious through the respiratory route, so beware of the water mist at dawn.\u201dAlways boil water before drinking. Avoid wetlands as much as possible.By following these simple rules, the incidence of red death is greatly reduced.Avoiding contact with the feces or corpses of the sick is just common sense.\u201cWhat don\u2019t you know?\u201dVikir didn\u2019t say anything in response to Aiyen\u2019s admiring words.Aquila said.\u201cLet the hunting birds spread Vikir\u2019s teachings to the other tribes. Beware of the water.\u201dAt that, everyone nodded. It was good for as many people as possible to know these things.Then Aquila rose from his seat and came to stand before Vikir.Vikir bowed his head in silence.The first time he\u2019d met her, he\u2019d felt a sense of gravity, like a huge mountain range weighing him down.But now he felt nothing of the sort.Instead, I felt a sense of warmth, a sense of home, and a sense of compassion, like a real mother\u2019s greeting.Aquila smiled gently.\u201cThanks to you, I can see a way out of this crisis, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart.\u201dOne would never recognize this woman as the Night Fox from her current expression and voice.In response, Vikir could only bow his head.Then.\u201cWell, the rainy season is coming soon, so how can you go away from the water?\u201dSomeone questioned Vikir.The shaman, Ahheman, stared at Vikir with a stony expression on his face.He had once misdiagnosed a side effect from the drugs the merchants had brought as a curse.When Bikir insisted that the Red Death was not a curse but a plague, and that it could be prevented, he seemed to decide that his position was under threat.But he wasn\u2019t entirely wrong.When the rainy season arrives, the rivers will overflow, and countless rains will pour down.The air would be filled with moisture, and there would be no way to survive the many aquatic creatures that would crawl up to the surface and carry plague.The preventative measures of boiling water for drinking and washing certainly had their limits.Balak\u2019s warriors stirred.Ahheman smiled a smile of conversion as he watched the number of agitated ones grow.\u2026\u2026 but.\u201cThe civil works must be done before the rainy season arrives.\u201dVikir, still looking nonchalant, was steadily taking the next step.Dewatering (flood control).It was necessary for Bikir\u2019s future plans.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This rainy season seemed to be the longest ever.There was record rainfall, the likes of which even the oldest man in the village had never seen.The rivers were overflowing like crazy, and places that had been flat just a few days before were now swamps with raging torrents.Everything in sight was underwater.\u2026\u2026except for Balak\u2019s village!\u201cPull tighter, tie tighter!\u201d\u201cPull up the stanchions!\u201d\u201cTighten it up! It\u2019s going to float away!\u201dThe low-lying village of Balak was now on higher ground.It hadn\u2019t been moved.They simply built floating houses out of planks and logs in the tall trees and between the trees.At least 15 meters above the ground, these wooden houses provided cozy shelter while the world around them was flooded by the river.Vikir was at the forefront of this massive civil engineering project to raise an entire village up in the trees.\u201c\u2026\u2026Luckily, I won\u2019t be swept away.\u201dVikir thought as he looked out at the rising river just a few meters below.Bridges had been built between the tallest trees with ropes, planks, and logs, and the barracks were securely anchored to keep them from being blown away by the wind.And down below, out of sight of the water, drainage ditches had been dug between the trunks and branches of the trees.In some places, rocks and earth had been piled up to create banks that redirected the flow.This allowed Balak\u2019s village to remain relatively safe from the flooding of the river.Some men were putting up a rope bridge made of twisted vines between trees through the rain and wind.They waved to Vikir as he passed by on the plank bridge.\u201cHey, Vikir! Our house is safe thanks to you!\u201d\u201cThank you! I\u2019m glad I listened to you!\u201dBut Vikir didn\u2019t respond to their greetings.Instead, he squinted at the huge shadow that was slowly moving toward them from the water below.\u201cDangerous.\u201dVikir briefly warned the two men who greeted him.Hearing Vikir\u2019s warning, the men looked down at the bridge in alarm.Just three meters below them, in the tawny mud, a giant shadow lurked beneath the surface.And then.\u2026Poof!The surface of the water shattered and something leapt out of the water.It was a catfish with a giant mouth that was more than five meters in diameter!As soon as it broke the surface of the water, it gaped at the two Balak men above.This has often happened since the fire.Energized aquatic creatures would leap at their prey in the trees.But the catfish didn\u2019t get his way.\u201cGet lost!\u201dArrows fell like thunder from the tree trunks.It was Aiyen, protecting the men as they built the bridge.\u2026Thump!Several arrows pierced the catfish\u2019s skull, and it twisted and flopped back into the water.Vikir scrambled across the rope bridge and up into the windswept trees.\u201cCatfish!\u201dHe looked down, but the tawny surface of the water had already been washed away by the raging torrent.Seeing Vikir frown, Aiyen grinned.\u201cThat\u2019s not a catfish.\u201d\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you just see it stick its head out of the water?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I guess you didn\u2019t see the body.\u201dI was afraid to let him finish.Suddenly, the surface of the water on the other side broke and something huge rose up from below.Sure enough, Vikir understood what Aiyen had said.The head was flat and the mouth was abnormally large, so I thought it was a catfish.But that impossibly long body sticking out of the water was no catfish.It was a giant snake.<Monsieur Hushu>Danger rating: A+Size: 32 metersFound in: Ridge 8, Red and Black Mountains-Named \u2018The Full-body Intestine Snake\u2019.A snake whose entire body is made up of intestines.It boasts a large mouth and appetite that can swallow an elephant in one bite, and legend has it that the giant Monsieur Hushu, which has lived since time began, can swallow an entire country.They are notoriously silent when crawling on land or swimming underwater.This giant snake of the Monsieur Hushu species was scaled and hissing as if it were about to swallow all the Balak on the floating house.Aiyen bit her lip.\u201cChet. You\u2019ve got a dangerous one washed up.\u201dThe giant rattlesnake was no match for a species that was naturally fast and strong.Moreover, the one in front of them seems to be quite old and experienced.[Shhhh!]The creature opened its mouth, which was so large that it could have been a catfish, revealing a dense row of teeth that sprawled across its entire mouth.Aiyen quickly fired an arrow at it, but its sleek, hard scales, and the rain that blinded him, made it difficult to get a good hit.Then.\u201cSnakes should be caught up close.\u201dA black shadow hovered like a ghost behind Monsieur Hushu.Vikir. Moving in the darkness, he blazed across the snake\u2019s back, unnoticed by rats and birds alike, and then bared his hidden teeth.He sliced through the artery in his wrist, revealing the magic sword Beelzebub.And the slimy aura of a Superior Gradient settled over it.A Baskervillian carnivore.Six \u2018lurking ambush teeth\u2019 have been released.Intent on inflicting terrible pain on the opponent, and nothing else!The blood-red aura emanating from Vakir\u2019s sword spins at high speed.The hard snake scales shattered in an instant, and the soft flesh underneath exploded and scattered as if it had been blown up.[Kyaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!]The snake screamed.But Vikir was unfazed, grabbing the snake by the tongue and lunging forward, his awl smashing into one of the snake\u2019s eyeballs.The fatal wounds to its back neck and eyeball caused the snake to back away, splattering hot blood. It then ducked its head under the water and began to flee frantically.No, it was more like being swept down the torrent than fleeing.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir briefly considered giving chase, but decided it was too much to ask in this torrential downpour.\u201cIt was a waste.\u201dBefore he knew it, Aiyen was beside him, wrapping a rope around Vikir\u2019s waist.Tugging on the rope around each other\u2019s waists, Vikir and Aiyen made their way back up the branch.Soon, all the villagers were out on the wooden terrace watching the battle.\u201cAwesome! Vikir, you were the best!\u201d\u201cThat big snake is called Ka\u2019ah, and he\u2019s been king around here for decades!\u201d\u201cYou defeated him, that\u2019s great!\u201dThe villagers cheered for Vikir.Then Aiyen snapped.\u201cYou people! Didn\u2019t you see me shoot that arrow! If it wasn\u2019t for me, you\u2019d be\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cOooh-\u201dThe kids booed Aiyen.\u201cUgh, this is why I hate kids.\u201dAiyen grumbles and shakes off the mud and splash that has drenched her body.He looked back at Vikir, who was dripping wet, and asked.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get the red death from getting this wet, are you?\u201d\u201cYou never know. Go to the fire and dry yourself.\u201dVikir strode away, as if the battle that had just occurred had been a minor incident.Seeing that people were cheering or not, Aiyen went on his way, and he said the words he had been saying for the past two years, one more time today.\u201cPass.\u201d* * * https://pindangscans.comVikir walked into the barracks.Outside, the rain and wind were howling, but inside the barracks was bright and warm.The leather hides on the walls were still flapping about, but they were secured with heavy rocks and strong ropes, so the wind wouldn\u2019t blow them away.Vikir\u2019s discovery of a way to prevent the Red Death made him a hero to the Balak, and indeed to all the jungle tribes.\u2026\u2026 But the hero is a troubled man now.It\u2019s a job he\u2019s never had to do before or since his regression.\u201cUncle!\u201dAs soon as Vikir entered the barracks, the Pomerian rushed over and hugged him.Until then, he had been squatting in the corner of the barracks, staring blankly at the portraits of his family.Pomerian avoided everyone else but Vikir, who followed him intensely.She followed him around all day, never wanting to be separated, sleeping, eating, and bathing.\u201d \u2026\u2026I want to eat.\u201dVikir wasn\u2019t sure how to respond to the child.It was all he could say to her.Afterward, Vikir made a simple fire in the corner of the barracks.With snails crawling everywhere in the rainy season, food was easier to come by than before.Vikir simply steamed snail flesh with butter, herbs, and backs made from cow\u2019s milk.He then fried them in a mixture of sugar made from sugarcane and cream made from bird eggs.The rest of the snail flesh was mashed with spicy spices that he had bought from merchants in the past, and when served with vegetables, it became a quite edible dish.\u201cDelicious, Uncle.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that right, your uncle is a good cook.\u201dBeside Pomerian, who was cringing, was Aiyen, who was naturally cringing as well.Pomerian looked to Vikir, then to Aiyen.\u201cMommy. Dad. Same.\u201dPomerian looked back and forth between Vikir and Aiyen and chuckled, and Aiyen rubbed his index finger under his nose.\u201cAs expected, the kids are really nice.\u201d\u201c\u2026I thought you said you didn\u2019t like children \u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhen did I say that.\u201dVikir pressed a hand to his forehead. The barracks were already cramped because of the Pomerians, and now that they\u2019d come to Aiyen, they were even more cramped.\u201cDon\u2019t be too harsh. but at least you can go outside to pee now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir could only sigh at Aiyen\u2019s attitude as she spread her legs again and swished her leather skirt.Just then.Whirring.The tents at the entrance were drawn back, letting in the rain and wind.A heavy stone had been placed on top of the gate, making it impossible for it to be blown away naturally.As if on cue, someone stepped out of the darkness outside the door.It was Ahun.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dVikir and Aiyen frowned at the same time.Ahun had always been an annoyance, and they were already wondering what he was up to this time.But.Ahun\u2019s expression when he entered Vikir\u2019s barracks was unexpected.His blue complexion, contorted face, and the way he looked like he was about to cry.Then, in a desperate voice, Ahun cried out.\u201cPlease help me, Vikir, my sister is\u2026\u2026!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A girl who had just turned fourteen lay there, moaning.A pale spot on her skin, a red death, slowly eating away at her body.Ahul\u2019s brother, Ahun, clung to Vikir with a contemplative look on his face.\u201cPlease, Vikir, please save my sister!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir closed his mouth and walked toward Ahul.Red spots on his skin, uncontrollable bowel movements, soaring body temperature, pain in his joints, swelling in his neck, armpits, and groin.These are all signs of the red death.\u201cWhy did it happen?\u201d\u201cI went to the swamp to cut down trees for civil works and stopped\u2026\u2026.\u201dAhun answered for me.Ahul must have gotten the disease when he went deep into the swamp to cut wood.\u201cWhat shall we do, slave?\u201dAiyen asked, looking worried.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do about it, though, if he\u2019s already fallen ill.\u201dPrevention is something anyone can do, but cure is the domain of the experts.Then.A flutter.The door to the barracks opened.It was none other than the shaman Aheman.As soon as he entered, he looked at Ahul and Ahun and snapped.\u201cYou\u2019re bad, you two, wandering around without listening to your grandfather!\u201dAhheman shouted, splattering spittle over Ahul\u2019s groaning face.\u201cYou deserve this because you were instigated by the words of that imperial spy! What comes to me goes around!\u201d\u201cGrandfather, you speak harshly!\u201dAhun shouted back, rising to his feet.Mate-.But all that came back was a slap on the ear.Ahun sank to his knees, his cheeks reddening, unable to get back to his feet.Achheman looked down at him in disdain as he fell to the ground.\u201cThere is nothing different from my mother-in-law. worthless bastard.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThick tears began to fall from Ahun\u2019s eyes.Aiyen sighs with a \u2018here we go again\u2019 look.\u201cThere is a cure.\u201dVikir spoke up.He snorted, and Ahun\u2019s eyes widened.Ahheman shoved Vikir in the chest and stormed out of the barracks.\u201cThis is a curse from the gods, and the only way to make amends is to make a sacrifice. Now that things have come to this, I\u2019m sure the chieftain will agree.\u201dThe shaman asserted his authority until the end.Whizz, whizz, whizz.The wind and raindrops rush in through the open doorway, soaking everyone.The only ones left in the barracks were Aiyen, Vikir, Ahun, and the sick Ahul.Vikir said to Ahun\u201cFirst, I want you to collect Ahul\u2019s feces. Make sure you don\u2019t come in contact with it. Also, sterilize the used utensils with boiling water, and burn some wormwood in the fire to drive away any mosquitoes, fleas, or bats that might be around the house.\u201d\u201cOh, I see. Is that all I have to do?\u201d\u201cNot just that.\u201dVikir turned his head to look at Aiyen.Then he said what he had originally planned to demand, a little more quickly.\u201cTake me out of the depths.\u201dAiyen\u2019s expression hardened at the words.There is no discrimination for those who have come from outside and become part of the Balak.They are free to go anywhere in the jungle, and inside the village, they are allowed anywhere except the chief\u2019s barracks and the shaman\u2019s festivals.But only one thing.They are strictly forbidden to travel outside of depths.A Balak from outside the city can only leave the city limits if two conditions are met.First.They must have lived in the town for at least two years.Second.They must be in a relationship with a native Balak and have given birth to three or more children.Vikir didn\u2019t meet either of these requirements.But that didn\u2019t stop him from asking to be taken out of the floodwaters.\u201cIf you let me out, I will bring a cure for the plague.\u201dHearing Vikir\u2019s words, Aiyen bit her lip.Would his mother and chieftain, Aquila, allow this exception? Probably not. Aquila was quite the principled woman.\u2018She would most likely abandon him.A small sacrifice for the greater good.But Aiyen didn\u2019t want to do that.She didn\u2019t want to see Ahul, who had always sung in her sweet voice and helped with the laundry and cleaning, dying of vomit and diarrhea.\u2026\u2026 But a more fundamental issue was tearing her apart.Would Vikir ever return?Technically, he was a foreigner who had been taken as a slave.If we set Vikir free and allow him to go outside the depths, will he return?Up until now, Vikir has been able to roam freely on his own, but only within Balak\u2019s territory.If Vikir tried to run away, Balak\u2019s rangers and wolves would find him and bring him to justice that evening when they saw that the camp was empty.Vikir wasn\u2019t stupid enough not to know that.But getting a pass to go outside the wall was a different story.By the time he realized he was on the run, never to return, he would be out of reach forever.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAiyen hesitated.It wasn\u2019t like her to hesitate.In that brief moment, she thought deeply about the psychological factors that made her hesitate, and soon found the reason.Looking into her own mind and discovering something she didn\u2019t even know she had.She looked up.Her eyes were already red, the color of fire. The only difference was that unlike fire, they were moist with water.\u201d \u2026\u2026.Go\u201dThe master\u2019s command fell.* * *Aiyen did not report to Aquila, for it was a given that she would not approve.All responsibility fell to Aiyen.Vikir ran through the night waters with the Pomeranian on his back.\u201cWe can\u2019t completely stop the plague with a flood control anyway.\u201dBesides, what about the other tribes that didn\u2019t build the flood control?A more fundamental solution was needed to prevent the spread of the Red Death, the revival of the empire, and even the Baskerville family.\u2026Tadak!Vikir crossed the river in one swift motion, stepping over logs as they floated downstream.With all the stuff that washed up during the floods, he could run on the river, shortening the distance.Just then.Vikir\u2019s feet came to a screeching halt on the riverbank.Shoot!\u2026\u2026The night was pouring with rain. A shadow streaked across the water.Vikir turned to find Aiyen standing there, soaked to the skin, breathing heavily.\u201cWhy are you following me?\u201dVikir asks, and Aiyen opens his mouth to speak, but stops himself.\u201cI\u2019m following my slave.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t follow me.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cI said don\u2019t follow me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the master!\u201dAiyen shouted in a bitter voice.But Bikir only drew the line once more with a cold glare.\u201cIt\u2019s unusual to say it three times, you know that, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to follow me, don\u2019t follow me.\u201dSeeing the look in Bikir\u2019s eyes, Aiyen froze in place, shocked.\u201cHow can you look at me like that?\u201dShe asked in a sobbing voice.Vikir didn\u2019t answer.Then Aiyen groped for something.And then, after sifting through many things, he spoke.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf you tell me where you\u2019re going, I\u2019ll go.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWhy are you taking Pomeranian?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201d \u2026\u2026Can\u2019t you at least leave him with me?\u201dA sight to behold, not knowing who was master and who was slave.\u2026\u2026No, Aiyen, she knew from the beginning.It was something she\u2019d felt from the very beginning, from the first time she\u2019d seen his gaunt face on stage, when she\u2019d been locked in the cage of the slave traders.That she would spend the rest of her life beneath him.The realization dawned on her as she stood in the pouring rain.She spoke, shivering, her voice damp with moisture.\u201cThen answer me this one question.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026what?\u201dVikir asked, and Aiyen took a long breath before she spoke.\u201cYou\u2019re coming back, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe voice crawled. A tone that hung with anxiety, impatience, and hunger.And for once, Vikir answered quickly.\u201cOf course.\u201dOnly then did Aiyen\u2019s expression soften.She blew out a white breath of relief.\u201c\u2018You keep your word.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201dVikir nodded.And then.The hounds ran through the dawn again.A darkness that swallowed him whole.And there is one master here who stands still and watches its fading back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What is in your wagon?\u201d\u201cOil, as it says on the import permit \u2026\u2026.\u201dThe merchant stroked his mustache and looked back.Sure enough, the wagon\u2019s interior was filled with large tin barrels.The paladins glanced inside.\u201cDo you mind if we check inside?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dThe merchant nodded, and the paladins drew their swords and climbed onto the wagon.The wagon lurched slightly as the three or four heavily armed knights climbed in.The paladins carefully examined the barrels inside the wagon.They were heavy, each with a tightly sealed lid.The paladins rapped the barrels together.\u2026Boom!They could feel that they were filled to the brim with oil. All of the barrels were like that.\u201cCan I not take this one?\u201d\u201cOf course not. There\u2019s more than oil in these barrels.\u201dThe paladins nodded at the merchant\u2019s words.\u201d Pass!\u201dAnd with that, the wagon drove through the gates and into the city.A short time later. The carriage pulled into the outskirts of a deserted street, into a deserted back alley.The merchant checked his surroundings a few times before lifting the lid of the oil barrel.\u2026Poof! Poof!He took a giant crowbar and twisted the lid, and with a loud bang, the barrel popped open.The iron lid, which had been tightly sealed, bent and opened, revealing the oil inside.The merchant called out in an anxious voice.\u201c\u2026\u2026, come out now.\u201dHe did. And then something amazing happened.Pow!The surface of the black oil cracked, revealing a figure inside.It was a man wearing a black hat like a pirate captain, a stork\u2019s beak gas mask like a doctor specializing in infectious diseases, and a thick trench coat.He stepped out of the barrel, covered in black oil, and stood on the floor of the wagon.The merchant began to shudder at the grotesque sight.Then, the stork gas mask man reached into his pocket and handed the merchant something.It was a set of oiled teeth, the fangs of the prized oxbear.\u201cGo, thank you.\u201dThe price he\u2019d agreed to accept in exchange for hiding in the wagon and passing through the gates.The merchant bowed and took the oxbear\u2019s tooth and put it in his pocket.Then, dripping with oil, the man began to walk away down the back alley.At his heels, the merchant stammered, \u201cWho are you?\u201d \u2026\u2026, but who are you?\u201dThe man flicked his stork\u2019s beak and replied in a short, sharp voice.\u201cThe Hound of the Night.\u201dWith that, he melted into the darkness of the alley and disappeared.The merchant, left alone, stared at the bubbling oil in the tin and muttered despairingly.\u201d \u2026\u2026How does a man stay submerged in oil for over two hours?\u201d* * *The Night Hound went back to the back of the dark alley and removed his mask.\u201cPooh!\u201dVikir exclaimed. He shook the oil off his body and breathed heavily.He hadn\u2019t been underwater this long since he\u2019d lasted seven minutes in the Styx River when he was barely a year old.Today, he\u2019d sneaked into the estate of the Quavadis family, a clan of holy men.\u201c\u2026\u2026the hound of the night.\u201dIt\u2019s a reference to the Balak chieftain Aquila\u2019s star sign, \u201cFox of the Night,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t sound quite right.But it was much better than being called the Hound of Baskerville before the regression, Vikir thought.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir took a moment to reminisce.It had taken them exactly four days to get here.Two days to get out of the depths, a day to explore the Baskerville family estate, and another day to infiltrate the territory of the Faithful Quavadis.The depths of the Red and Black Mountains were wide, but the floods helped us escape.The rapids that sprang up everywhere, and the corpses and logs that floated above them, made traveling many times faster.Most of the waterways were covered with dense vines and branches, so even rivers and lakes that had nowhere to go could easily be crossed by climbing over the forest canopy.Of course, there were hungry creatures along the way, but they were no match for the fully-restored Vikir.Giant catfish, old lizards, ferocious bears, ravenous packs of wild dogs, and venomous bats\u2026\u2026 were mere rites of passage for Vikir, who had perfectly adapted to the depth ecosystem over the past two years.\u201c\u2026\u2026No, it was dangerous once.\u201d\u2018I don\u2019t know about the others, but the bone-sucking mosquitoes, they were really dangerous.Undaunted by the fierce rain, they chased Vikir in swarms, and he spent nearly half a day trying to keep them at bay.The weakened Pomeranian caught a cold and struggled for a while.The first thing Vikir did when he emerged from the water was to take Pomerian to the city of Underdog.Mr. Chihuahua, who was sighing at the full moon in the night sky, fainted three times in quick succession when he saw Vikir burst through the window of his small apartment.Vikir had come to City Hall because he was one of the few people in Baskerville who could be trusted with a personality that belied his skinny appearance.\u201c\u2026\u2026, Deputy, are you a ghost? No, I mean, how did you get here?\u201c\u2018Why don\u2019t I know the layout of the place I used to go to work every day?By now, the Chihuahua had come to his senses, and when Vikir told him what had happened, he let out an exclamation of admiration.\u2018You are indeed a great man, Deputy. Only you have a different kind of life. What kind of barbarian tribes do you live with for two years\u2026\u2026\u2019\u201cI\u2019ll be back in full force soon enough, so be ready. And keep everything that happened today a secret.\u2018I see, but who is this child, who looks so much like you, Chief Deputy\u2026\u2026? Is this the child of Chief Deputy, who has been having some sort of affair with a barbarian\u2026\u2026.\u2019\u2018By blood, yes, but not in the way you imagine, so spare me the nonsense.\u2019Vikir trusted the Chihuahua with the Pomeranian.\u2018He is an important person, so don\u2019t ask him anything until I return, and then take great care of him and give him a basic education.The story goes quickly, as the Chihuahua still hasn\u2019t forgotten Vikir, the chief deputy, and his eyes are still red from the occasional glass of wine.Chihuahua quickly summoned a doctor from the city hall, who examined Pomerian and brought him medicine and food.\u201cI will take care of her, with my life, until the deputy returns.The Chihuahua said with determination.After two years, he still looked scrawny, but Vikir knew he was a man of his word.Considering the Chihuahua\u2019s low wages, Vikir handed over Oxbear\u2019s pelt and horns to Pomerian in exchange for child support.\u201cHee hee! What are you giving me for all this?\u201cTo be sold at your pleasure.\u201d\u201cWow, that\u2019s a lot of pelts and horns for a big guy, and if I can sell them properly, they\u2019ll be worth more than ten years of my salary.\u201cMake sure the Pomerian are well provided for.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re very protective of your daughter. You\u2019re a good father. I have three daughters of my own, so I know how you feel.\u201dThe Chihuahua gave me a fatherly smile and a knowing nod.There was a hint of misunderstanding, but Vikir didn\u2019t bother to clarify.Then.\u2018ah! Deputy, this is\u2026\u2026!\u2019As if on cue, Chihuahua quickly opened a cabinet in the corner of the office and pulled out a stack of old papers.Vikir\u2019s eyes lit up when he saw it.It was a file of newspaper clippings from the past two years, detailing Baskerville and Morg\u2019s interactions, current events, and recent issues.\u201cI was prepared just in case the deputy consul might come back.\u2019 !\u201dThe Chihuahua scratched the back of his neck in embarrassment.Vikir was grateful that the Chihuahua hadn\u2019t forgotten him, even in this situation.So Vikir agreed to help solve some of the problems in the city of Underdog, which is currently experiencing a resurgence of criminal activity due to the absence of a magistrate.\u201cIf it interferes with your work, you can find Sindhiwendi in Messinadnaro. She owes me.\u201dVikir told the Chihuahua in a hushed tone.The Chihuahua\u2019s eyes widened.Messinadnaro Sindiwendi was a criminal whom Vikir had freed in a plea bargain two years earlier.\u201cHow do I find her?\u201d\u201cDo you remember the girl I gave 10 billion to when I was deputy chief magistrate?\u201d\u201cSure. Her name was Judy, too.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d probably go looking for her, because it\u2019s hard to make 10 billion, but it\u2019s even harder to keep it. She has nowhere to go and no backup, so she\u2019s easy to get to.\u201dThe Chihuahua nodded silently at Vikir\u2019s words.Fresh out of prison and penniless, finding an investor would be her first priority.She had once gone to Gambino, a poor local baron, and become his investment advisor.\u201cBut if I find her, will she continue to help me? She must have something against the local government.\u201d\u201cTell her you\u2019ll get her some good business.\u201d\u201cAnd by good business, you mean\u2026\u2026?Vikir was kind enough to answer the Chihuahua\u2019s questions.\u201c\u2018I will give you a monopoly on trade with the savage tribes.\u201dThe barbarian tribes of the Sioux River have not traded with the Empire since the conflict with the merchants of Bourgeois Street two years ago.If Vikir, the current hero of Balak, were to step forward, that trade could be reopened, and the merchant who did so would likely find great wealth.Add to that the fact that the underdog city\u2019s crime rate has been on the rise again since Vikir\u2019s death, and her counsel would be invaluable in addressing the many problems and ills of the city.At that, the Chihuahua nodded.Indeed, less than a few hours after Bikir\u2019s return, the problems of the past two years were already showing signs of resolution.The Chihuahua was in awe all over again.\u2026Whoo!Vikir launches himself back over the window sill.The night hound sneaks out of the underdog city.\u2018Deputy Magistrate! Where are you going?With the Chihuahua\u2019s mournful cry behind him, Vikir heads for the land to fulfill his promise to Aiyen.A place where the \u2018red death\u2019 of Ahul could be quickly cured.\u2018\u2026\u2026That can easily be accomplished with a single drop of your family\u2019s holy water.\u2019The Quarvadis, one of the Seven Houses of the Empire, a family of faithful saints.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

One of the central cities directly under the control of House Quarvadis.People walk solemnly and reverently along the white marble paved streets.Whenever a bell rings from the tall clock tower, everyone stops in their tracks and prays to the holy tablet on the roof of the Quavadis\u2019 official residence in the distance.If a gold coin fell to the ground, it was not picked up, and order and security were kept very strictly by the citizens\u2019 own rituals.\u201c\u2026\u2026where would I live suffocated?\u201dVikir stood on the roof of a tall tower and looked down.Women walked around with white cloths wrapped around their bodies, exposing only their eyes. The men did the same.For religious reasons, lust and greed are strictly controlled.No nudity, no fashion, it\u2019s all white and monochromatic.It\u2019s a far different atmosphere from the Balak village, a tribe that lives freely in the jungle with most of their bodies exposed.Having lived there for the past two years, Vikir found the atmosphere of St. Mecca stuffy and uncomfortable.After waiting for darkness to fall, he headed to a slum on the outskirts of the city, far from the center.Broken windows, cracked walls, low-lying areas with stagnant water and steep staircases.Slum scenes are similar everywhere. It\u2019s the same in cities under the power of Quavadis the Faithful.The people here are especially harsh, as Saint Quavadis banishes sinners from the center of the city and sends them to the outskirts.People who hadn\u2019t committed felonies worthy of jail time, but had committed misdemeanors that wouldn\u2019t allow them to enter the center.They were weeded out by the checkpoints and paladins that dotted the city\u2019s pathways.Vikir climbed a steep flight of stairs and entered the slums on the higher ground.It was the most remote and darkest of the slums.Then, from beyond the darkness, the bell rang twelve times, signaling midnight.By this time, few people were passing by, but those who remained in the streets all bowed down to the ground to show their respect to the Quavadis.And when they did, only the Hound of the Night did not.Moving through the noise of the night, Vikir went to the well and pulled out a vial.It was the Red Death, the essence of the plague, drawn from the blood, sweat, and tears of Ahul.Vikir poured the liquid into the well.He released the Red Death into the heart of the Quarvadis.\u201cIt is an extremely infectious plague, and sooner or later there will be a reaction.\u201dThe Red Death has an incubation period of up to ten days and a minimum of one day.Once inside the body, it can take as little as a day to develop, three days if it comes into contact with mucous membranes, and usually a week if it is spread through breathing or skin contact.\u2018It\u2019s the realm of the faithful, so hopefully we can cure it before anyone dies.Vikir thought for a moment about when to move on to the next design.Then.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dVikir made eye contact with a group of children approaching from the other side of the well.They were on their way to catch bugs, and they were carrying buckets, dragonfly traps, and sugar water.The oldest child, the one in front of him, peered over and asked.\u201cIs anyone there?\u201dThe children stopped in front of the well and shouted. They can barely see Vikir, who blends perfectly into the darkness.It\u2019s a dark, moonless night, and Vikir is masked.He\u2019d never be recognized, but he had to be careful.Next, Vikir\u2019s eyes glowed with life.A crimson glow blasted through the gas mask\u2019s glasses.[I will curse this well.]The children shuddered at Vikir\u2019s words and sank to the ground in a heap. They even pissed themselves.Vikir warned them sternly.[Anyone who drinks from this well will surely die].It\u2019s unnecessary, but it\u2019s a consideration.He didn\u2019t want the children to get caught up in it.\u201cHiiiit! It\u2019s a ghost! It\u2019s a demon!\u201d\u201cThe well is cursed!\u201d\u201cEw! I\u2019ll never drink it!\u201dThe children scurried away in a huff.After Vikir checked several times to make sure that all the popular pretenders were gone, he buried something in the dirt near the well.It was a marker left by the intruders who had flooded in some time ago.It was the mark of Leviathan the Extremist.Vikir knew immediately that the Leviathans were responsible for unleashing the Red Death on the surface.\u201cLet\u2019s see you guys fight to the death.\u201dThe religious Quavadis and the ultra-orthodox Leviathan had been at odds for generations.What would happen if the Red Death spread to Quavadisgar\u2019s home base?Since it\u2019s Quavadisgar\u2019s home base, suppressing it would be quick, but after that would be the problem.\u201cWe need to move fast.\u201dI can already see a few people coming up to draw water from the well.We need to get the Quarvadis out before there are any innocent civilian casualties.The sooner I can fulfill my promise to Aiyen.* * * https://pindangscans.comThe Hound of the Night worked diligently, visiting the official residence of the Holy Prophet Quavadis in the heart of Saint Mecca.Despite the late hour, several wagons were parked in front of the compound.It\u2019s true what they say, sickness does not sleep at night.Even at this moment, there were many people who wanted to visit the holy man to heal themselves.Most of them were nobles and wealthy people who had arrived in fancy carriages, and they were all knocking on the saint\u2019s door, their well-groomed clothes contrasting with their sickly faces.\u201cWe heard that you are on retreat here! Please open the door for us, we want to greet you!\u201d\u201cOh saint, I knew you were here, and I have come to ask you to take a look at my illness just once!\u201d\u201cPlease let me see him, saint!\u201dIt seems that word has gotten around that Saint Dolores, the direct descendant of Quavadis and the owner of a small household, is currently here in St. Mecca.Saint Dolores, the pride of the Quavadis family, is currently a sophomore at the Imperial Academy, where she is the Vice President of the Student Council.Rumors that she was resting here during the academy\u2019s vacation period had drawn nobles and noblemen from far and wide.They were all highborn nobles, rich men with lots of money.Over the clamor of knocking and shouting, a voice came from inside the door.\u201c\u2026\u2026Who are you and what brings you to me at this late hour?\u201dThe voice was gentle and feminine, but with a hint of power.The voice of a saint, perhaps.The nobles and the rich were thrilled to hear the voice of the famous Saint Dolores herself.But it doesn\u2019t last long, and they quickly answer.\u201cI am the son-in-law of the House of Alpons, the eldest son of the House of Jonathan, which has produced knights of great distinction from generation to generation, and the son-in-law of the House of Dortmund, and I have the House of Dotte as my brother above, and the House of Franz as my sister below\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cI am the general manager of the Ipsen Guild Union, which is a subcontractor to the Bourgeois family, and I am in my fifth year as president of the Ipsen Town Council, and I am also an honorary knight, having recently been knighted by the Empire and having served for two years as a squire to the prestigious Count Les Baskervilles, a Boston terrier\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cIf I may speak for myself, I am the second son of House Childs, and if you can cure me of my ailments, I can bestow upon you the entirety of the fertile granary lands far from the main house of the Quavadis, as well as a villa on the warm shores of the south and a fleet of private carriages\u2026\u2026!\u201dBut.No man, no matter how powerful, no matter how rich, could open the gates of Quavadisgar.St. Dolores kept the door firmly closed and refused to open it to anyone.\u201cI don\u2019t see how your status and wealth are any reason for me to open the gates to your ambitious vision.\u201dNot the noble, not the rich. They all went home, exhausted, after proclaiming at the top of their lungs how wonderful they were and how much they could pay for a cure.And then, as the night wore on. The line had disappeared and Vikir was the last one standing at the door of the government office.It was so quiet you couldn\u2019t tell if anyone was behind the door.Standing in front of it, Vikir knocked politely.Sure enough, this time he heard the saint\u2019s voice.\u201cWho are you, and what brings you to me at this late hour?\u201dVikir thought for a moment.The men who\u2019d been listing their identities at the top of their lungs just moments before had all come up empty.\u201cThat is not the taste of a saint.\u201dVikir knows who Saint Dolores is.He\u2019d seen her on the front lines, on the bloodiest of battlefields, before he was turned back.The intense look of treating the wounded covered in blood.Her white robes stained with blood, her white holy power bursting from her.The sight, even from a distance, was holy and sublime.Finally, Vikir spoke briefly.\u201c\u2026\u2026It\u2019s just a lost lamb.\u201dFor a moment, there was silence beyond the door.Vikir waited.And then.A click.The door to the Quavadis of the Faithful, which had been firmly closed and opened to no one, opened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s only natural.\u2019Vikir\u2019s outfit now looked suspicious.A large hat, a stork\u2019s beak gas mask, and a black cloak covering his entire body.No wonder the saint wouldn\u2019t meet him in person.Vikir approached the statue and spoke.\u201cI have come to report a plague in the slums.\u201dAs he spoke, Vikir held out a bucket of well water, imbued with the energy of the Red Death.A good cleric would be able to detect the peculiar aura of this water.The moment.[\u2026\u2026.]The voice from the statue cut off.Vikir had a hunch. The saint had stopped sending her voice through the stone.And then.\u2026Tsk!The door behind him slammed shut.It wasn\u2019t the only one.\u2026ding! \u2026ding! \u2026ding! \u2026ding! \u2026ding!The doors on the front and sides began to shut.In an instant, the main lobby was isolated and shaped like a gladiatorial arena.Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha!Out of nowhere, a line of white-armored paladins appeared on the terrace on the second floor.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir took a quick look around.Normally a lobby and parlor, the room was designed to be converted into a battlefield in a pinch.Indeed, with all five doors and corridors blocked, there was no escape in any direction, and above them was a siege network of ever-present paladins.The various statues tucked into the corners provide no concealment, and once trapped, there is nothing to do but wait for judgment.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHowever, Vikir doesn\u2019t react, just stands there in silence.As if he had already anticipated this reaction.Just then.\u201cWho are you?\u201dThe gravelly voice came from among the statues on the first floor.Beyond it, a man walks out into the center of the square.Over two meters tall, with a scarred, shaven head, white armor and cloth wrapped around his entire body.The man has no eyebrows, a noticeably large nose, and a large mouth.His eyes were gently curved as if he were smiling, but the aura he gave off was quite harsh.His arms, thick as logs, cradled a large book, which appeared to be a holy book of some sort.Vikir squinted behind his gas mask.\u2018\u2026\u2026Inquisitor Mozgus. Long time no see.\u2019\u201cMozgus Quavadis. He was a friend of mine before I went back.A man I often trusted with my back in battle against demons.His bulk is like an iron wall, and the holy power he emits can light up a thousand miles.A man who would never compromise with injustice and could be more cruel than the demons themselves when it came to justice.It was refreshing to see an old comrade-in-arms here, who had died so spectacularly during the Demon War, single-handedly facing off against a thousand demons.\u201cCome to think of it, I learned my torture techniques from him.\u201dVikir recalled the memories of torturing the masters of the Seven Families in Underdog City.But those beautiful (?) memories belong to Vikir alone, and in this life, Mozgus is seeing Vikir for the first time.He held up a thick Bible that must have weighed dozens of kilograms and turned to Vikir.\u201cYou are dressed suspiciously for someone who has come to report a plague in the slums, and I will not allow you to see the holy woman until you remove that mask and show some manners.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t remove my gas mask for a reason. My duties are complete at the point of reporting, so I must return.\u201dVikir dropped the bag of red death to the ground and raised his arms in a gesture of non-committal.Then he slowly backed away.\u201cBlasphemer!\u201dMozgus rushed forward.He slammed his Bible, a weapon in its own right, down on Vikir\u2019s head and tried to stamp on him.But Vikir was faster.Vikir took advantage of the gap in the book\u2019s upward motion, and in a flash, he was back through the hollow between Mozgus\u2019s sides.Boom!A deep crack appeared in the floor where Mozgus had struck with the book.Vikir squinted at the white aura emanating from the corners of the pages of Mozgus\u2019s personality book.\u2018A book. You still wield an unusual weapon, and you\u2019re an intermediate to advanced Gradient.\u2019Half as good as he was before his regression.However, given that this was the home of the Quarvadis and that he had the divine power to heal himself, it was almost a tie.As he watched Vikir take up his stance, Mozgus let out a low growl.\u201cI sense an evil energy in the water in that stupid thing. If that is indeed a plague, you must be the one spreading it.\u201d\u201cIf I were the culprit, why would I come to report it?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s a trick, or maybe it\u2019s a ruse to draw you out.\u201dVikir shrugged, because it made sense.\u201cI\u2019m just here to report a suspicious group of people spreading plague in the slums.\u201d\u201cYour outfit is the most suspicious for saying such a thing. We\u2019ll hear your statement later, in jail.\u201dWith that, Mozgus swung the book around.Parallax.The book opened, the white pages inside flipping over with a loud crackle.At the same time, bolts of white aura emanate from the pages, targeting Vikir.\u201cHave you ever been cut by stiff paper? It hurts.\u201dMozgus was performing a strange and unique attack, opening the Bible and slashing with his aura against the sharp edges of the pages.Quack, quack, quack!Hundreds of pages of parchment scattered in all directions.However, with a similarly black ghostly movement, Vikir dodged all of Mozgus\u2019s blows.It was a trick he had learned from the hunters of Balak.At the same time, Vikir drew the magic sword Beelzebub from his wrist.\u2026Blood!The tip of the blade erupted with a sticky aura.\u201cGraduator!\u201dMozgus and the other paladins were stunned.Vikir\u2019s aura, a powerful aura that was no match for Mozgus\u2019s, was now intertwined with Mozgus\u2019s aura, forming a tie.Furthermore.Vikir had even activated Oxbear\u2019s skill, \u201cThousand Muscles,\u201d which was sealed inside Beelzebub.Vikir\u2019s weight swelled to nearly 600 kilograms in an instant.Mozgus looked down on Vikir\u2019s small size and tried to push him with his strength, but when he couldn\u2019t get him to budge, he was extremely puzzled.\u201cIt\u2019s like pushing a boulder! What the\u2026\u2026!?It\u2019s not surprising that Mozgus, no matter how big and strong he is, can\u2019t be as physical as Oxbear.Vikir wielded Beelzebub as he was.A Baskervillian carnivore, a lurking ambusher.It looked nothing like a Baskerville on the outside, but it was a Baskerville on the inside.Its hidden teeth shredded Mozgus\u2019s aura to pieces.It wasn\u2019t a known swordsmanship anyway, so revealing a bit wouldn\u2019t give him away.Vikir drew a long blade from his wrist and formed six teeth.He slashed at Mozgus\u2019s head, neck, both shoulders, and both backs.\u201c\u2026\u2026cough!?\u201dMozgus tried to cover the Bible and hold it up as a shield, but\u2026\u2026 was too late.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to use it as a shield, you should have used it sooner.\u201dVikir slashed the back of Mozgus\u2019s hand as he grabbed the Bible.A moment.\u2026Roar!The breath of Cerberus, the Hound of Hell, blazed hotly from the tip of Beelzebub.The unquenchable flames of the oil field scorched the back of Mozgus\u2019s hand.\u201cAaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201dMozgus rolled on the ground, clutching the back of his burning hand.The fire of Cerberus cannot be extinguished by water or sand.Palak-palak-palak!The torn pages of the holy book were consumed by flames.Vikir looked at the fallen Mozgus and sheathed his sword for a moment. He had not come here to kill him.But.\u201cYou blasphemer! What sorcery are you practicing!\u201dMozgus\u2019s fighting spirit was immense.With a burst of divine power, he grabbed the water flowing down the statue\u2019s mouth and turned it into holy water.Push, push, push!Suddenly, the fire on the back of Mozgus\u2019s hand was extinguished. The fire on the back of his hand was extinguished.But even with the hasty extinguishing of the fire, the battle was already won.Mozgus felt a lump in his throat.He looked up and saw that Vikir had already stepped on the thick holy book and was standing on top of it.\u201cStepping on a holy book is blasphemy!\u201d\u201cBy that measure, your throwing and swinging the holy book is worse.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dMozgus was forced to keep his mouth shut.Vikir spoke, boiling a black aura with the tip of his outstretched awl.\u201cDo you wish to try more?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dMozgus clenched his teeth at the arrogance in his voice.How many other beings in the world were capable of pushing him like this, even though he had reached the upper ranks of the Graduators?Mozgus clenched his fists tightly together and summoned his aura with all his might.Quack, quack, quack!Mana spinning at high speed quickly enveloped his entire forearm.\u201cIyaaab!\u201dMozgus charged with all his might. With enough to blast the opponent in front of him with a single punch.But.Vikir didn\u2019t react.\u2026Thud!He merely kicked the holy book off the ground.Boom!Next, Vikir kicked the Bible into the air.The Bible spun and flew toward Mozgus.Mozgus had just turned his head to dodge it.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dHe had to doubt his eyes.Vikir, the man who had been in front of him until the Bible was a thin straight line across his eyes, disappeared from view in that brief moment when the Bible stood vertically and took up a large area.\u201cWhere?I screamed. A cold sweat runs down my spine.Suddenly, I hear a ghostly whisper in my ear.\u201c\u2026\u2026 looking for me?\u201dIn the fraction of a second it took for the book to fly and spin, Vikir was out of Mozgus\u2019s line of sight and holding onto his back.Mozgus spun around in surprise.\u2026BANG!Vikir\u2019s aura slammed into Mozgus\u2019s entire body.Swung like a hammer, Vikir\u2019s aura shattered Mozgus\u2019s full body armor like grains of sand, and even the chainmail he wore was shattered.Uh-oh! Thud!Mozgus smashed through three statues behind him and fell to the ground.The paladins on the second floor terrace could only gape at the shocking result.They had never seen Mozgus Quavadis, Inquisitor, Archbishop of Quavadis Family, and leader of the Knights of the Inquisition, lose so easily.\u201cAm I dreaming?\u201d\u201cLord Mozgus has been defeated?\u201d\u201cNo way, how could this happen\u2026\u2026!\u201dBut after a moment of confusion, they drew their swords in unison like the elite of the Quarvadis and leapt to the first floor.\u201cGet that blasphemer!\u201dWhite auras rose from everywhere.Vikir adjusted the gas mask that covered his face.\u201cQuite the way to deal with a stray lamb.\u201dThe paladins who had jumped from the second floor now surrounded the front.What\u2019s more.Gurgling.Behind them, among the shattered remains of the statues, Mozgus heaved himself to his feet.He had stripped off all of his shattered and distorted armor and was clutching a large shard of stone with both hands.Blood was dripping from his body, but it didn\u2019t seem to bother him at all.\u201cOnly if you want to see the end.\u201dVikir drew his magic sword, Beelzebub, as long as he could.A sticky liquid aura, a testament to his advanced graduator status, bubbled and boiled at the tip of the blade.All the paladins, including Mozgus, tensed at the overwhelming momentum Vikir exuded, a black ghostly figure.They couldn\u2019t close their eyes, couldn\u2019t swallow their saliva.The slightest slip of the tongue would be enough for that black ghost\u2019s teeth to tear at their throats and hearts.\u201cWhere did this monstrosity come from\u2026\u2026.?Mozgus regretted his rashness and took a stance.One-on-one, a must-lose.Many against one, half and half.The opponent was a creature that could not be completely defeated, even with all of the paladins here, including himself.Normally, he would have taken a step back and formally declared a crusade\u2026\u2026.\u201cThere is a saint here.\u201dThe stakes were too high for him to take any chances.Vikir, Mozgus, and the rest of the paladins stood in a tense confrontation.\u201c\u2026\u2026Stop!\u201dA voice shattered everyone\u2019s concentration.A figure poked its head out from the terrace on the third floor.It was Saint Dolores, and she was here.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That\u2019s a blood-crazed wolf! You need to step back now\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cBring me tea.\u201dDolores raised her hand to stop Mozgus from speaking.Then he said in a very firm tone.\u201cI need to talk to him.\u201d* * * https://pindangscans.comSoon, a small parlor was set up with a table, chairs, and two teacups.Warm, steaming cups of peppermint tea.At the entrance to the parlor, a large Mozgus stood fidgeting.In his hand, he held a small teapot with a floral design that looked like a large ring.A small table was placed in the center of the room, and Bikir and Dolores sat across from each other.Dolores sounded surprised.\u201cWhen I heard that Mr. Mozgus had come out, I was surprised and came to see you, because I thought you were going to get hurt a lot.\u201dMozgus has the temperament and philosophy of an inquisitor. So does his body.So there was no reason for him to take kindly to the suspiciously dressed visitor.But who knew?That the man who was the military backbone of the Quavadis would be defeated so spectacularly.Suddenly, Mozgus spoke up from beside him.\u201cSaintess. I didn\u2019t lose, if it had been a long game, the odds were definitely in my favor\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe mere fact that he says this is a sign of defeat.Dolores thought to herself.\u201cMr. Mozgus was one of the few Graduators in the Empire, and if he can be defeated so easily, I can\u2019t imagine why anyone would want to\u2026\u2026.She stared at Vikir\u2019s mask in front of her.But there was nothing she could read in it.As Vikir stared down at the teacup in front of him, Dolores spoke again.\u201cI don\u2019t think you can drink tea with that gas mask on.\u201dVikir nodded silently.He hadn\u2019t said anything since earlier, so Dolores decided to cut to the chase.\u201cI\u2019ve been under a lot of stress lately.\u201dVikir\u2019s head snapped up at her words.Stressed about what? The studies at the academy? Or a home school class?But Dolores shook her head.\u201cI\u2019m taking a break from the academy and my family\u2019s affairs because it\u2019s vacation time. It\u2019s the nobles and merchants you saw just now who are really bothering me.\u201dThey dragged their sick bodies to the saintess and begged her to heal them.Unwelcome visitors, begging for money or prestige.\u201cThe things they ask me to cure are obvious: erectile dysfunction, sexually transmitted diseases, drug side effects \u2013 nothing really serious.\u201dIf he had the divine power to heal them, Dolores said, he\u2019d rather help people who are really struggling and sick.\u201cJustice, righteousness, charity, equality, and the will of God may be these things\u2026\u2026 but people are too blinded by what\u2019s in front of them.\u201dVikir nodded in agreement.\u201cThis is inevitable, since theology is essentially a process of understanding human beings.\u201dIt was a phrase he\u2019d often heard from her mouth when he\u2019d met Dolores on the front lines of the war before he\u2019d regressed.Vikir had only briefly recalled a memory from long ago, but Dolores\u2019 eyes widened at the sight before him.Even Mozgus, who stood in the doorway.\u201cOld Testament, Azmoth, chapter 6, verse 9. Very philosophical and profound.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe you know these old words. You must be well versed in theology. Are you a member of the Church of the Runes?\u201dVikir was silent for a moment.He didn\u2019t know or care about Runes, the state religion of the Empire, so it seemed like a good time to change the subject.\u201cMore than that. There is a plague in the slums of St. Mecca.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Is that reliable information?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve seen the water in the streets. It comes straight from the wells of the slums.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t have anything to do with it?\u201d\u201cWhy else would I have come here of my own accord?\u201dVikir spoke again.\u201cI hate to see innocent people harmed. Especially since this is my home.\u201d\u201cOh, is this your home? I\u2019m from here, too.\u201dDolores\u2019 eyes twinkled at Vikir\u2019s words.It was the first time she had heard of his homeland, so Vikir simply shook his head.\u201cI believe in absolutes, too. I hope the plague will be eradicated soon.\u201d\u201cA rough soul, but\u2026\u2026 a good one, you are.\u201dDolores turned serious.\u201cYou told Mr. Mozgus earlier that you saw some suspicious people, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes, sir. I saw them pouring liquid in vials all over the wells.\u201d\u201cIf this plague is man-made\u2026\u2026 who spread it and for what purpose?\u201dDolores seemed to be thinking a lot.Plagues are not a simple matter.Once a plague starts to spread, the hardest hit are institutions where many people live in community, usually monasteries and schools.When a plague hits a monastery, the number of priests decreases, and cults, religions, and superstitions begin to flourish, requiring even more priests.In this way, when uneducated and inexperienced priests go out into the field, more heresies, cults, superstitions, and so on are created.Thus, in the event of a plague, the Quavadis would be at a significant political disadvantage.To prevent this from happening, they would have to suppress the Red Death early.Vikir\u2019s answer was brief.\u201cThose who wish for the downfall of House Quavadis, and those who profit from it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026That\u2019s particularly difficult.\u201dDolores furrowed her brow in thought.Even her mind, rumored to be the brightest in the academy, could not predict the future.But Vikir knew what was coming, that\u2019s right, because I\u2019ve experienced all of these things before returning.With that, Vikir drew a map from his bosom.The locations of the Seven Houses, circled around the ecliptic of the Empire.Vikir pointed them out, explaining them to Dolores.\u201cThose who stand to gain the most are the Leviathan and the Bourgeois.\u201dThe extremely poisonous Leviathan will use this opportunity to collect samples from numerous patients, investigate, study, and improve the plague to use as their own weapon.Since they are a family that uses poison and medicine as their main weapons, the fact that a strong plague has spread is a very good thing for them.Furthermore, the fall of their arch-enemy, the Quavadis, would be a blessing in disguise for the Leviathan.In addition, the oligarchic bourgeois were also likely to see significant reflexive gains.Gold and silver treasures do not disappear in a plague.The deaths of the workers would bankrupt the landowners, and their warehouses, gold and silver coins, banknotes, and production facilities would be taken over by the bourgeois.Once the bourgeois has gobbled up the dead and empty factories, farms, stores, guilds, and other real estate capital, they can use their accumulated wealth to start new businesses.Fashion businesses for the newly wealthy, health supplements for those who remember the horrors of the plague, and so on\u2026\u2026 sales will soar like crazy.\u2018Merchants from bourgeois families would visit Balak\u2019s villages and try to buy up antlers and ginseng and things like that, right?\u2019Vikir thought to himself.\u2018The ones spreading the Red Death must have been Leviathans, the extremists.And they probably have a tycoon Bourgeois as an ally.It was highly likely that they were trading information with each other.The religious Quavadis and the natives of the jungle are the scapegoats.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Therefore, for these reasons, I believe they may be intimately involved in the plague. Just a hypothesis, of course.\u201dVikir had actually seen, heard, and experienced the events before his regression, and he was able to flesh them out a bit.What?I don\u2019t feel much of a reaction from the front.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dVikir tilted his head slightly, as if looking for something.Then he sees the faces of Dolores and Mozgus behind the gas masks.Both were frozen in place, their mouths half open.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Who the hell are you?\u201d\u201dDolores asked in an uncertain tone.The being who had suddenly appeared one day and warned him of the misfortune of the Quavadis family.A lonely man, dressed in strange clothes, but with a clear and pure spirit.\u201cWho are you, and how do you know all these things?\u201dDolores\u2019s voice began to tremble.Normally, among the guests who come to the House to feed themselves, there are always those who are well versed in the ways of the world.But few of them could predict the future with such accuracy.Even more so, they have the distinction of being early warners of an epidemic that hasn\u2019t even been reported yet.Naturally, Dolores and Mozgus couldn\u2019t help but wonder about the identity of this strange visitor to the Quavadis family.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 Ooh, great! Doesn\u2019t the saintess ask? Who are you?\u201dMozgus also asks, dangerously fiddling with a small teapot that looks like it will be crumpled at any moment.It\u2019s like he\u2019s pressuring me to respect the saintess\u2019s authority, but he\u2019s really just curious.Dolores and Mozgus both look at Vikir\u2019s face, their eyes shining.In response, Vikir answered briefly.\u201cHound of the Night.\u201dAt that, both priests\u2019 expressions become slightly subtle.\u201c\u2026Night hound. That\u2019s a rather ominous name.\u201d\u201cEven when you give yourself a nickname, you wear it as if it were a piece of clothing. How very blasphemous.\u201dDolores and Mozgus snorted.Vikir remained silent after that, saying nothing else.Naturally, Mozgus hurried things along.\u201c\u2026Whatever is going on\u2026 \u2026\u2026everything he said is possible, Night Hound. We need to investigate the plague as soon as possible, report back to our patriarch, and take measures at the clan level.\u201dThere was a sense of urgency in the chapel.Dolores formally asked Archbishop Mozgus to organize a crusade to relieve the plague.She also formally reported to her biological father, Cardinal Humbert, whose monastery was not far away.Today, Dolores\u2019 decision would reach the ears of Lord Nabokov I, patriarch of the Quavadis and Pope of the Church of Runes.It was a big deal.Mozgus scurried off to tell the saint\u2019s will.Meanwhile, Dolores was staring at Vikir with wide-eyed wonder.Vikir, in turn, met Dolores\u2019s gaze calmly.Vikir did not bother to tell the holy woman the story of House Baskerville and House Morg.To do so would reveal that the Red Death was first released in the waters of the Red and Black Mountains.In fact, the Baskervilles and Morg have the most to gain if the Red Death is released into the waters of the Red and Black Mountains.The barbarian tribes play a crucial role in the Red and Black Mountain ecosystem, and the loss of these largely predatory creatures would cause subordinate demons to overpopulate, leading to monster waves and a spike in civilian casualties.Vikir recalled the past.Before the regression, over 40% of the barbarians had been exterminated as the Red Death gradually spread.This caused the demon population to skyrocket, and the political influence of the Morg and Baskervilles on the border grew.Hugo used this political influence to grow his family\u2019s power even further, and once again, many hounds were lost.Vikir was one of them.Well, whatever.Keeping the Balak alive is all about getting revenge on Leviathan the Extremist and Bourgeois the Tycoon, which in turn is about getting revenge on your comrades who died in Baskerville the Ironblade.It\u2019s a chain of events, by design.Vikir closed his eyes in silence, contemplating what was to come.Meanwhile. Saint Dolores stared at Vikir as he did so.\u201c\u2026\u2026A lost puppy, exhausted and lonely.\u201dWhy do these thoughts come to mind for a man who calls himself a hound?Why did the man who had brought down the mighty Mozgus and the paladins under his control look so small and pitiful?He smelled of blood, of the wailing of a broken soul, and the sound of blood.Sorrow, hatred, and loneliness. And a man walking a thorny ascetic path, carrying all these burdens alone.He had the aura of a prophet or a seeker.Suddenly, I remembered the words he had muttered in his deep throat.\u201cTheology is essentially a process of understanding human beings, so this is inevitable.\u201dThere is no doubt that the person who knows this passage of the old scripture, which even the theology experts do not know well, is not a Rune follower.He must be a follower of the runes, practicing the doctrine on the front lines of suffering, in the lowest, most intense places.\u2018There\u2019s no way he could remember and recite those words otherwise.\u2019At least that\u2019s what Dolores thought.She is a young, immature sixteen-year-old girl with the qualities of a saintess who can read the souls of others.Is that why? Her misconceptions about Vikir were gaining weight.But whether she does or not, Vikir is merely waiting for the appearance of the holy water that can extinguish the Red Death.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dA man and a woman look into each other\u2019s faces with different thoughts.The tea that hadn\u2019t even been touched was quietly cooling down.* * * https://pindangscans.comLater.Vikir hurried to the slums of St. Mecca.Saint Dolores, Inquisitor Mozgus, and dozens of paladins and priests followed.\u201cIs there really a plague in this place?\u201dDolores said, out of breath as she climbed the steep stairs.The paladins escorting her seemed to be in disbelief as well.But there was no hesitation in Vikir\u2019s gait as he ran forward like a scout at the head of the pack.Finally, landing on a high roof high above the city of Dahl, Vikir glanced from chimney to chimney.Despite the fact that the weather wasn\u2019t too cold, the chimneys of several houses were wreathed in smoke from wood-burning stoves.Vikir looked for houses with smoke rising from their chimneys.As it turned out, some of the houses with smoke rising from their chimneys were already experiencing an outbreak of the Red Death.The first symptoms of the Red Death are usually chills and fever.This is followed by intense pain throughout the body, followed by vomiting and diarrhea.Patients shudder at the sight of red spots that slowly appear on their skin.The chills naturally lead them to shove firewood into the chimney.But just because there was no smoke rising from the chimney didn\u2019t mean there were no patients.In the slums, many families didn\u2019t have enough firewood, and most of them were wrapped in dirty blankets to keep the chills at bay.Dolores wept at the sight of their suffering.\u201cAlas, poor people, do not worry. Rune\u2019s great love will heal you.\u201dWithout hesitation, she touched the bodies of the plague victims, saying prayers and blessings.Vikir stood still behind her, assessing their condition.\u201cThank goodness there are no children.\u201dIt was worth it to scare the children at the well. There were no children among the patients.Because Vikir had come in such a hurry, they were all early cases with only mild pain.They were all primary cases, infected by drinking water, and secondary cases, infected by the saliva or feces of primary cases.The disease had to be stopped early, while there were no deaths.Saint Dolores gathered the patients in the central square and prayed to God.[Light of my life, flame of my life, my sins, my soul, look down upon the young and poor gathered here\u2026\u2026]The saint recited the prayer in a clear voice.And then.A single tear fell from Dolores\u2019s eye and rolled down her cheek.She looked so vulnerable, so holy, so somehow sublime.It was the look of a beautiful girl, but without the slightest hint of lust or lustfulness.Soon, a single tear, broken by contact with the floor, began to work miracles.\u2026Pow!It emitted a white, holy light and instantly wiped away the red stains from the bodies of the patients in front of her.With a single drop of her tears and a single line of prayer, five or six patients were freed from the red death.\u201cOooh! Thank you, saint! Thank you!\u201d\u201cYou are my savior.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m healed, I\u2019m cured, my God, it\u2019s a miracle!\u201dThe villagers, who had been shivering with chills and gagging just before, jump up and jump as if they hadn\u2019t suffered from a plague.Dolores smiles as wide as she\u2019s ever cried when she sees her patients regain their strength.And there was a man behind her who stared at her smile.\u201cThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s what I need.It was Vikir, hoping for a miracle from the holy water.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We can\u2019t stop the new patients from coming.That\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t cure the source of the plague.The patients keep showing up because somewhere in this slum, a well is contaminated with the plague.The wells often followed the water table beneath the ground, and as a result, it was impossible to completely eradicate the plague without purifying the water source.\u201cThe number of reported wells in this slum is 42, plus unreported wells dug by the villagers themselves\u2026\u2026.Dolores worried.If this happens, there is no choice but to concentrate the divine power to one well that leads to the deepest place.The essence of pure water.Concentrate and focus the divine power, make it the size of a pill, release it into the water, and it will purify the entire slum along the underground waterways.So the priests of Quavadisgar immediately began clinical trials.Divine Essence to purify the water, clinical trials 1a through 3c.If they all pass, the plague of the slums will be eradicated.While the priests of Quavadis Family gathered their divine powers to create the Essence, Dolores tended to the more pressing cases.\u201cA terrible plague indeed.\u201dThis red death, once contracted and cured, was a disease that could return again and again.The incubation period was extremely short, but the time to death was very long.What\u2019s more, it felt like an artificial compilation of the worst aspects of all the plagues in history.The malice itself.It was an extremely virulent plague that was deliberately created to torment humans, causing the patient as much pain as possible for as long as possible.\u201d \u2026\u2026 This is not the time for this. We need to cure one more person.\u201dEven now, more patients were streaming into the infirmary.Dolores was on her feet within a few minutes of sitting in the chair.A moment.A ping.She stumbled slightly as she stepped onto the floor.It was overwork to the point that she, who was born with mild anemia and full divine power, felt tired.\u201cI can do this, though.\u201dDolores dragged her exhausted body out of the barracks, her holy power slightly restored.She couldn\u2019t wait to comfort the suffering patients as soon as possible.Then.\u201cOuch! A saintess has come out!\u201d\u201cOh, what a holy figure!\u201d\u201cSaintess, we are with you!\u201d\u201cFrom now on, you have nothing to worry about, Runmen!\u201dThere were men following Dolores as she headed toward the slums.High nobles, or the scions of high nobles.They had knocked on the door of the Quarvadis not long ago and had been refused a meeting.\u201c\u2026\u2026What brings you here?\u201dDolores asked.Beautiful blonde hair, clear blue eyes, flawless skin, and a clear voice.Just hearing her voice was enough to make the men in the room shiver.And then the male competition began.\u201cI, too, have followed the saint to this place to offer my services!\u201d\u201cHow could a noble lady be sent to such a filthy, lowly place alone!\u201d\u201cWe brought only three carts filled with donations and relief supplies. Please tell the beggars to gather! hot ha! Today is the day they ride.\u201d\u201cI would go to any place more shabby than this if the saintess was there!\u201dThe young men talked eagerly, each trying to win Dolores\u2019 favor.But the coldness in Dolores\u2019s eyes as she received their envious glances was unbearable.When Dolores walked toward the front without answering, the young men thought they had her permission to follow.\u201cThanks to the saint, I\u2019ve never been to a place like this before. I\u2019ve only seen backward neighborhoods like this in books, but it\u2019s a refreshing experience.\u201d\u201cHaha, I thought that only skinny, dirty people would live in the slums, but there are still people living there. I didn\u2019t realize it. I guess you have to experience things to know them.\u201d\u201cBut looking at the kids walking around, they\u2019re wearing nicer clothes and shoes than I thought. Are they really poor? They don\u2019t look that different from the kids in the middle class neighborhood. Hmm, aren\u2019t they a little too extravagant, these people.\u201d\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m paying too much for this donation. I wonder if these people will lose the will to stand on their own\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dThey had their servants bring in carts full of donations and relief supplies.Eventually, Dolores arrived at the temporary barracks where the patients were gathered.Boldly, she slipped through the curtain and went inside.But the young men following her pause and hesitate.\u201cIs it safe? There must be a lot of plague victims in here.\u201d\u201cUgh. If they move it, I\u2019ll have to\u2026\u2026. I\u2019m a third generation nobles\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, the saint will fix it!\u201d\u201cThe brave get the beautiful! I\u2019m coming!\u201dSome of them turn away in fear.Some took a deep breath and bravely stepped out into the barracks.Those who followed Dolores into the barracks had to cover their noses as they gagged.The smell of sweat, blood, vomit, piss, and shit everywhere, the foul breath and body odor of unwashed patients, and the air unpleasantly warmed by elevated body temperatures.Visions of red death floated like ghosts through the thick vapor of filth.The stench and foul heat, combined with the moans and cries that came from everywhere, made the barracks seem like a living tomb itself.\u201cUh\u2026 \u2026 uh uh uh\u2026 \u2026 \u201dWhere did the second and third generation of nobles, young people who inherited inheritance at a young age and became wealthy, encounter such a terrible and desperate sight?\u2026Chulp!Water poop poured out by the patient next to him fell to the floor.The shards splattered and stuck to their shoes and pants, and they ran out of the barracks, screaming at the top of their lungs.\u201cEw! It stinks! It\u2019s filthy! How dare you\u2026\u2026!?\u201d\u201cHow much do these shoes cost!\u201d\u201cPriests! Priests! Treat me first! Treat me first! Get out! I\u2019m plagued!\u201d\u201cOpen the door! Tell them to get out of the way! I\u2019m getting out of here!\u201dBefore she could take a breath of the air in the barracks, the entire group of young men fled.Saintess Dolores looked at them with a pitying gaze.\u201c\u2026\u2026I knew it.\u201dDolores\u2019 beauty had long been well known.Within her family, outside of it, and at the Academy.Wherever she went, the eyes of men followed.No man dared openly flirt with the noble saintess, but she couldn\u2019t help being the object of his gaze, as if she was always yearning for something.Whenever she went out to volunteer during the academy\u2019s vacations, or during her free time, there were always men like that following her.They were disgusted by the sight of the sick, sometimes openly expressing their contempt and disgust.Sometimes they would secretly turn the sick away behind their backs.So Dolores distrusted the men who followed her because of her beauty.If she were to become ugly, if her body were to be covered in such filth and stench, wouldn\u2019t they evaporate around her?And it is disrespectful to leave it and come to the sacred relief site with a special heart.In the fierce scene of life and death, there should be only one mind, the mind of the patient.Absolute goodness. Pure selflessness. Dogmatic sacrifice and service. Kindness and affection.These are the things closest to the grace and love of God.St. Dolores set her heart on being a martyr and a seeker.She entered the depths of the barracks with an even more reverent attitude.The deeper she went into the barracks, the more foul odors and unclean heat she encountered.Cries and groans of agony mingled with the dancing of the red death, creating a grisly scene.Dolores drew on what little holy power and stamina she had left and made her way to the farthest reaches of the barracks, to the quarantine area where the sickest patients were kept.From here, even veteran priests would struggle.And then.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dDolores\u2019s eyes went wide.The innermost barracks, where he\u2019d expected to find nothing but misery and desolation, was surprisingly alive with activity.Sure, the suffering patients were still there, but\u2026\u2026.\u201cHurry up and get more saline!\u201d\u201cYikes, it seems that divine power isn\u2019t the only skill in the real world, hurry up and get me a scalpel!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ohhh. What a skill.\u201dThe surrounding priests are all admiring with their mouths half open.It was a very different attitude from the overworked and depressed officers in the other barracks.The hardest places bring out the most vibrant life.A man fighting alone in the dirtiest, fiercest, most inhospitable places.Even though he is covered with filth all over his body, he examines the patient\u2019s condition without any hesitation and silently gives first aid despite the curses and curses he spat out carelessly out of pain.The Hound of the Night.He was bustling among the patients, directing the priests.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 82": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Return of the Iron-blood Sword HoundCH 81Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 81 The Saintess (4)When Vikir first came to the barracks where only seriously ill patients were gathered, the priests\u2019 reaction was as follows.\u201cThis is no place for a layman.\u201d\u201cYou could be infected, get out now!\u201d\u201cHelp? We don\u2019t need it, you\u2019re in the way!\u201dBut when Vikir began walking among the patients and blessing them, the priests\u2019 expressions changed.\u201cThat\u2019s not how you bless.\u201dVikir said to the priest who was using holy power on a red spot on a patient\u2019s leg.In general, a priest\u2019s primary ability is to pray to a God to receive a share of his power and to use it to recreate some of the heavenly phenomena on earth.In its simplest form, the priest asks the god to share his power, the god accepts and sends the power, and the priest receives the power to heal the patient.If the patient also believes in the same God, the priest\u2019s request for power from the God becomes a kind of guarantee, and the healing effect is amplified.In short, more divine power is available to the same believer.This is especially true if the priest or patient has a deep connection to the gods, such as through prolonged prayer or evangelizing.This was similar to the correlation between a bank\u2019s credit rating and lending.But.Priests could only use divine power within certain limits.How much piety you\u2019ve had.How celibate, how sacrificial, how much you prayed, how many times you said God\u2019s name, how much you donated, how much you volunteered, and how long you\u2019ve been devoted to God would limit the amount of holy power you could exert.A priest with 1 divine power could perform 1 miracle, and a priest with 10 divine power could perform 10 miracles.This was common sense.But.Vikir knew.How a priest with 1 holy power could perform 10 miracles, and a priest with 10 holy power could perform 100 miracles.\u201d \u2026\u2026 There\u2019s a concept known as short selling.\u201dIt was a deceptive method discovered by priests in the Age of Destruction as they struggled to make up for their ever-increasing lack of divine power.In commerce, short selling means \u201cselling what you don\u2019t have\u201d.In commerce, short selling means \u201cselling something you don\u2019t have,\u201d which means that you don\u2019t have it, but you sell it up front to get the money and then buy it back later to pay for it.When the time of destruction came, many priests despaired in the face of the swarming demons and the even greater number of patients.Their own divine powers were not enough to stop the catastrophe.So the gods of the Rune religion, watching on, came up with a plan.They drastically increased the amount of divine power available to priests who had performed well and consistently.This allowed high-ranking priests to perform far more miracles than usual in times of crisis.But even so, they still didn\u2019t have enough holy power.Demons and beasts that came out of the oil world literally devastated the human world.The gods became even more desperate.It was then that the priests began to awaken.They began to unleash divine powers that would normally have been unthinkable.Even their empty mana vessels were able to exert divine power.Act first, report later. Let\u2019s make a miracle and see what happens.Any divine power that you have saved up in advance can be used later with interest to make up for it or recover it, but you should use all of it that you can draw from right away.The journey of creating and using divine power and then repaying it through faithful activities.Some call it \u2018borrowing holy power\u2019, some call it \u2018shorting holy power\u2019, and some self-helpfully call it \u2018begging for holy power\u2019.Even those who weren\u2019t priests and had killed a lot of demons were allowed to use some holy power, as it was a time when killing demons to earn karma (experience) was considered a religious activity.Vikir had slain countless demons, and the karma had been accumulating nicely, stored in his soul.This was true even after his regression.As such, the current Vikir is the only one who can wield divine power without being a priest.However, there was a slight limitation on the use of holy power without being a member of Rune: it could only be done within a sanctuary.Where Vikir currently stood was the realm of the Faithful Quavadis, and thus a sanctuary.Vikir walked over to the moaning man and reached out.\u2026Pit!A weak stream of holy power began to heal the patient\u2019s body.The priests, wide-eyed at the sight of Vikir\u2019s holy power, rushed over to watch.It was the first time they had ever seen someone who was not a priest of House Quavadis use holy power.Moreover, Vikir was a master at using holy power efficiently.\u201cThat, too, I have learned from surviving the Age of Destruction.\u201dPriests treating a patient in a mad rush. Looking over their shoulders, Vikir learned how to use divine power.It was simple, really.A simple one, in fact: slit the wound with a scalpel and let the holy power seep straight through to the primary injury.A great deal of divine power is wasted in performing miracles by laying on skin, holding hands, or casting blessings from afar.Instead, it was most efficient to channel the divine power concentrated at the source of the pain.Vikir took his scalpel and made small incisions in the reddened spots, channeling holy power through the flowing blood.The sanctuary of the Quavadis was filled with grace, and Vikir was able to draw upon a significant amount of holy power.Of course, since he was not a priest, he could not use it for long.And the priests who had witnessed Vikir\u2019s miracles and performances were beginning to flock to him one by one.Survival skills that could be used by anyone in the Age of Destruction were considered unheard of and unrivaled here.Moreover.The priests\u2019 surprise was not yet over.Vikir has been delaying the spread of patients with a combination of all kinds of herbs he has picked from the waters of the Red and Black Mountains.It was something he had learned from the warriors of Balak during the last two years of living in depth.A medicine that would not stop the plague, but would delay its spread and suffering as long as possible.Made from recipes and ingredients unknown to the empire, it reduced the fevers and groans of the patients, at least a little.Like this. Vikir moved among the patients, taking in their filth and their complaints, and yet calmly and silently tending to them all.This, of course, was done for a reason.First, to give confidence to the priests of Quavadis, second, to take the essence of the holy water to his friends in faraway lands, and third, out of compassion for those who had died the red death because of him.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dEveryone watched Vikir\u2019s miracle with their mouths half open.Then.\u201cAaahhh- Mommy! Mommy!\u201dA child cries, shaking the body of a lying woman.The woman\u2019s body was still pale in color, though a few red spots had sprung up.The problem was that her body was dangerously weak even in this state.Vikir placed his hand on the child\u2019s head.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll cure your mother right away.\u201dAfter saying this, Vikir lifted the disease from the woman\u2019s body.He also grabbed a bunch of gold coins from his pocket and handed them to the child.\u201cSickness is sickness, but you are malnourished. Use this to buy food and firewood to care for your mother.\u201dThe child hangs his head in shame, his face covered in tears and snot.Then, seeing the child receive the money, many sick people rushed to Vikir.They, too, stretch out their hands for money.One of the priests was puzzled and said to Vikir.\u201cNo, no material help, there\u2019s no limit, you\u2019ll have to give them all the money you have!\u201dVikir shrugged it off.\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t there be a limit? There\u2019s definitely a limit to the money in my pocket, and I\u2019ll just have to give it all away.\u201dWith that, Vikir distributed the money to the sick people around him and their families.Vikir then discarded the empty leather pouch without a trace of regret and returned to his work.The priests stood dumbfounded, shocked once more.St. Dolores was one of them.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dShe gazed at Vikir\u2019s broad back and remembered what had happened earlier.The young men who had flirted with her.They boasted of their noble status and vast wealth, showering the slums with donations and supplies.But their demeanor was arrogant, and in their hearts they despised and looked down on the poor.But what about Vikir? He didn\u2019t hesitate to give away all the money in his pocket.Though the amount was small, it was a great act of sharing and sacrifice.This is why the Bible says that a beggar who gives a bowl of porridge may be more noble than a rich man who gives a thousand gold coins.Dolores thought silently.In a place where filth and pestilence reigned supreme, this man worked harder than anyone else to help the less fortunate.A man who seems to have lived on the front lines of a fierce battle.This man with the aura of a pilgrim, a seeker, a prophet.This man has a sad, lonely soul that doesn\u2019t match his strong body.A man who calls himself a hound, but inside he is a lost and tired puppy.This man is crying and bleeding with his soul.\u2026\u2026Where the hell does he come from?Suddenly, Dolores remembered a line he had muttered in a hushed voice some time ago.\u201cTheology is essentially a process of understanding human beings, so this is inevitable.\u201dAnd then.\u2026a thud!A throbbing pulse, a fast-flowing bloodstream.My heart dropped to the bottom of my chest once, and then came back up again.A saint, and a still young and immature sixteen-year-old girl.Dolores\u2019s heart was beating fast.Toward the faceless man in front of him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Here is a woman with her only son. Do you know the grief of a mother who sees her son hanging? I, the unfortunate one who had to raise the Son of God, howled from that night to the next, and it is so painful that my heart does not follow me. This day, O my beautiful and excellent son, shall be the most bitter and sorrowful day for me\u2026\u2026]The epic written by the first saintess weeping shines by consoling all the holy sacrifices in this world.Then three drops of holy water began to emit a bright light.Archbishop Mozgus bowed respectfully and placed the small glass jar containing them on a tray.Dozens of bishops then followed him in carrying the holy water.It was to be stored in a solid underground vault deep inside the official residence of Saint Mecca branch of the Quo Vadis family.Soon, a crowd of priests gathered in the main building of the Quabvadis family to watch the procession.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dDolores felt the awkwardness and discomfort in the air.The Holy City of Quavadis had recently been in the midst of a civil war, and here were the two leading factions, the Old Covenant and the New Covenant, all in one place.The plague, the Red Death, was a huge problem.Suddenly, a middle-aged man with a grave and sleek appearance looked at Dolores.\u201cCome closer. My Nymphet, my daughter.\u201dDolores hesitated slightly at the words, then lowered her eyes respectfully.\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes, father.\u201dWith that, she walked with slow, small steps to stand in front of the man.Dolores\u2019 eyes took in his face.\u2018Humbert humbert L Quovadis.A man who holds the title of Cardinal, the de facto highest dignity of the Old Order, a position so exalted that there is no place higher except for the Pope.He reached out and stroked Dolores\u2019s head once, lightly.\u201cYou\u2019ve made a great dedication this time.\u201d\u201cYou are flattering me.\u201dDolores was very careful with her father.It was an uncharacteristic demeanor for a father-daughter duo, but it was also commonplace in large families, so no one thought it odd.Humbert, on the other hand, recognized Dolores\u2019 demure demeanor and nodded.\u201cVery well. Give me a report on what\u2019s been going on.\u201d\u201d \u2026\u2026 I\u2019ve been working on a report, can I give it to you right away?\u201d\u201c\u2018Better say it out loud. Writing is stiff.\u201dDolores nodded silently at Humbert\u2019s words.\u201cWe\u2019ll use the first batch of \u2018Saint\u2019s Tears\u2019 to cleanse all the waterways that run underground in St. Mecca.\u201d\u201cHave you found the source of the plague?\u201d\u201cYes. It was an unregistered well high above the slums.\u201dDolores was a born investigator.She was a member of the Academy\u2019s detective club when she was a first-year student.Dolores focused her investigations on slum patients, mostly children, and was able to secure a number of testimonies of ghostly sightings at a well.When the children claimed that a ghost had cursed the well, Dolores went to investigate.Sure enough, the well was heavily contaminated with plague, and he found a glass jar in which the killer had allegedly placed the plague bacteria.What\u2019s more.\u201cAnd while investigating the area, we found a suspicious object.\u201dThis is where the report stops.At Humbert\u2019s questioning look, Dolores pulled out the evidence, wrapped in a clean cloth.Humbert\u2019s eyes widened at the sight of it.\u201cIs this \u2026\u2026?\u201dA single dagger.With a large snake emblazoned on it, it was unmistakably the symbol of Leviathan.Also lying next to it was a button.A golden button with a scythe and hammer on it, clearly the mark of the tycoon bourgeois.\u201cWhere did you get these?\u201d\u201cThey fell in different places by the well.\u201dThen Cardinal Humbert\u2019s eyes dart around rapidly.In his mind, the cause-and-effect chain was already being put together.\u201d \u2026\u2026You said that the structure of the plague seemed to be artificially created.\u201dTo create a plague of this magnitude, not only would it require an intimate knowledge of poisons, but it would also require huge research funds.BANG!Cardinal Humbert stomped his foot once, hard.The white marble floor cracked and the two stone pillars around him crumbled.\u201cI declare a crusade! How dare you, you lowly vipers, and mistresses dare to blaspheme\u2026 \u2026 !\u201dEven the Emperor bows to the will of the Quovadis, so how dare these lowly poison-making, money-grubbing creatures make such a challenge!Indeed, there was an undercurrent of strife among the seven families of the empire.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dDolores remained silent, her mouth agape.Then, something came out of Cardinal Humbert\u2019s mouth that made her eyes widen.\u201d \u2026\u2026Did you say hound of the night?\u201dHumbert said, his handsome face contorting.\u201cHe\u2019s suspicious, too. Take him in and put him before the Inquisition. Make him spit out everything he knows.\u201dAt this, Dolores visibly panicked.Her calm, cool demeanor crumbled in an instant.She looked like any other sixteen-year-old girl and shouted urgently.\u201cHe\u2019s not guilty!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dDolores suddenly protested, and Humbert\u2019s expression hardened for an instant.\u201c\u2026\u2026Him?\u201dHumbert looked down at Dolores in disbelief.\u201cDaughter, what are you saying\u2026\u2026?\u201dDolores, the daughter who had always moved so dutifully, without a word of protest.She had been a good daughter who had never gone against her father\u2019s wishes since she was born, except for her enemies in the New Order.But what about now?\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dDolores met Humbert\u2019s gaze, her fists clenched and shaking.It was as if he was determined to defend the existence of the Hound of the Night.\u201cThere\u2019s no way a man so dedicated to the poor could be evil!\u201dDolores had heard the testimonies of many patients.A man who stayed up all night to see them, saying over and over again that he was sorry for what he had done.A man who used divine powers, albeit weak ones, and who gave away all his possessions to his patients.\u2018Why did he say he was sorry to his patients?\u2019For not being able to cure them sooner or more? If that was the case, Dolores felt strongly about it.She had felt sorry for sick people every time. Then others would ask her what she was sorry for. Or rather, why would someone who should be grateful be sorry?But even so, Dolores was sorry. I always felt sorry for everyone.And the Hound of the Night understood that. Empathized with her.She remembered a conversation she\u2019d had with the Night Hound not long ago.\u2018I was lucky enough to be born with divine powers, but I\u2019m weak in body, mind, and faith. Someone as strong as you should have been born with these powers\u2026\u2026.\u2019Why did God choose her to be a saint? There are plenty of other people with strong faith who don\u2019t have divine powers. Why did he give her the undeserved title of saint?The Night Hound turned to Dolores, her head bowed and weeping.\u2018The very fact that you are so distressed and sorry must be why the gods chose you. It must be the love of the gods you speak of that shines through in the lowest, fiercest places.\u2019Dolores couldn\u2019t help but sigh softly.The words were comforting, as if spoken by a veteran saint who had seen all the ups and downs.This advice hit her like a knock on the door from her future self to her present self.Like a wise old saint from the classical era, or a big sister to emulate and follow.Watching the hounds of the night, she felt a little like that.\u2018When I get older, will I be able to say the same words you just said?\u2019\u2018\u2026\u2026 Perhaps you will be.\u2019He answered strangely, giving Dolores a faint glimpse of trust.The sixteen-year-old girl admired that.Perhaps that\u2019s why she was so adamant about the Hound of the Night\u2019s innocence in front of her father, Cardinal Humbert.But.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe more vigorously Dolores defended herself, the harder Humbert\u2019s expression hardened.Then Humbert motioned to a number of bishops.\u201cPrepare for an urgent arrest. We will meet and question him.\u201dDolores\u2019s pleas were to no avail.Humbert strode off, his demeanor even more murderous than before, and headed for the chambers where the Hound of the Night was supposed to be staying.Dolores followed Humbert in a panic.He was ready to throw himself down and wrap his arms around the Night Hound if he had to.\u2026\u2026 but.\u201c!?\u201dEveryone standing in front of the cabin couldn\u2019t help but open their eyes wide.Whirring.An empty cabin. The curtains swallowed the wind coming in through the broken glass window and puffed up like ghosts.A hound of the night, long gone.The priest\u2019s urgent shouts from downstairs gave away the situation.\u201cThere\u2019s trouble! A drop of the saint\u2019s tears has gone missing!\u201dThe moment.\u201c\u2026\u2026aah!Dolores opened her mouth in silence.Now he had a vague idea of why he had come here.And the vague certainty that now that he had served his purpose, he would never see him again.As Humbert and the paladins fussed and organized a pursuit party, Dolores stared out the window into the darkness.The empty rooms, the broken windows, and the cold breeze brought the reality back to him.\u2026Thud!His heart sank once more.It was a different beat than the last.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Aiyen feared death, or worse, doom.Now it is self-evident that he will never come out of this cage, but will wither and die in agony.His freedom to roam the vast depths is gone, and his honor as a proud warrior will be tarnished.What will become of you?Will you live a miserable life as a castle puppet for the greedy empire of Fatty? Or will he become a gladiatorial slave, doomed to fight demons until the day he dies, and end up as a mere piece of meat on the tables of gluttonous gourmets who lust after human flesh?Aiyen\u2019s body and mind were weakened by his festering wounds, his rising temperature, and the fact that she hadn\u2019t had a sip of water in days.As the proud jungle warrior fell to the ground, wings broken, dying a slow death.A miracle happened.A boy appeared with a white light.He casually lifted the shroud of darkness over Aiyen\u2019s fate and cast a beam of brilliant light.Her eyes were immediately drawn to his beautiful appearance, his combat prowess, and most of all, his brave and regal demeanor, which she had never seen before in her life.Had there ever been a warrior of her age capable of such strength?Not even among the strong and brave warriors of the Balak was there a man of such excellence, among an empire that thought only of them as cunning and dirty.Through his fading consciousness, Aiyen watched as the slave traders who had mistreated him, treating him like an animal, cattle, were dragged away, all dead or with their limbs torn off.That bloody night.The boy took her out of the cage and sent her back to the home she\u2019d always dreamed of.And since then, Aiyen has never forgotten the boy\u2019s face.Aiyen has consistently crossed the borders of the Empire with the sole intention of finding Vikir.To invade the Empire was to risk her life.She crossed the border, sometimes in groups, sometimes alone, to find the boy.Living in a small community in the jungle, she had no idea there were so many Imperials.But the boy was extraordinary, and she knew that if she kept searching through the crowds, she would find him one day.One by one, Balak\u2019s other companions achieved their goals.A man in Balak kidnapped a woman from the Empire to become his wife, and a woman from Balak kidnapped a man from the Empire to become her husband.One by one, her companions succeeded, but Aiyen continued her hunt.She was waiting. For the one that would one day miraculously arrive. It was inevitable.While all the other girls her age had captured and paired up with suitable men, Aiyen stood firmly alone.She didn\u2019t even look at other men.Until one day.Aiyen met a boy.A boy, the same boy from the night before.But in his arms was a different woman.A woman. Aiyen felt a black fire boiling in his chest, a fire that burned only in the oil world.But Aiyen was a cool headed woman, and she quickly tamed the flames within her.She decided to dismiss the boy\u2019s past favoritism toward women.It\u2019s not about the past that can\u2019t be changed, it\u2019s about the future they can build together.The problem was, the boy didn\u2019t fit into her plans at all.The boy had grown stronger since their last meeting.He fought brilliantly against several of Balak\u2019s warriors, proving himself extraordinary yet again.The more he saw of the boy, the more he wanted him. To own him. To have him as her own.And that desire grew stronger as she watched the boy charge at Madame Eight-Legged, unfazed.In Balak, brave warriors are treated as such. The boy deserved it.So Aiyen turned to flee.He wanted to save the boy, even if it meant being caught by the terrifying Madame.\u2026\u2026How could he even think of facing that monstrous creature?His legs were shaking and he was breaking out in a cold sweat, but nevertheless, Aiyen pushed through his fear.In a moment of crisis, she threw the lasso and succeeded in freeing the boy from the Madame\u2019s eight legs.Aiyen then brought the boy back to the tribe, his body ruined by his fight with the Madame.There was some backlash.The cranky old bastards didn\u2019t like outsiders from the Empire.Rumors that the boy might have ties to the Baskervilles, Balak\u2019s nemesis and arch-enemy, led many to suggest that he be executed.It was Aiyen who steadfastly refused.She argued that the boy had saved her life and that keeping him alive would benefit the tribe.And her foresight was spot-on.The more the boy recovered, the better for the tribe.He went on hunts, brought back big prey, scolded traders who had always treated the natives poorly, and even provided cures for the plague.Other than that, the days of living together in the village began to pass like a lightning bolt.The days of pissing on each other, eating decoctions of bear genitals, hunting together, and bathing in the hot springs all blur together in a dreamy, milky way.For some time now, Aiyen had really, truly wanted the boy.It was a feeling that had long since transcended the simple concept of possessiveness.\u2026\u2026 Just then.\u201cSweetheart, get up.\u201dSomeone shook Aiyen awake.She lifted her heavy eyelids and looked straight ahead through blurred vision.She could see the straw woven ceiling.Aiyen was now lying in bed, sweating profusely.He was flushed, his temperature was rising, he was losing his appetite, he was sweating profusely, and he was dehydrated.With difficulty, Aiyen turned his head to look at the figure beside him.The Balak chieftain, Aquila, stared down at him with concern.Aquila wiped Aiyen\u2019s face with a damp cloth and spoke.\u201cYou kept looking for Vikir in your sleep.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026It\u2019s so painful, Mother, could this be the Red Death?\u201dAiyen said, gasping for breath.Then Aquila squinted her eyes and examined her daughter\u2019s entire body.Aiyen lay without a single thread of clothing on her body.Her temperature was rising, and she was sweating profusely. Her whole body is flushed red.But there are no obvious spots.Aquila pondered.\u201cHis symptoms are a little different from the other children with the Red Death\u2026maybe it\u2019s \u2026\u2026, maybe it\u2019s not.As she pondered, Aiyen frowned and clutched at her chest with her hand.\u201cThe pain is getting worse, my chest hurts, my body is hot, and I feel like my heart is drying up.\u201d\u201cHang in there, girl. Vikir will be here soon. He\u2019s the man you sent for.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m fine without him, he\u2019s not coming back.\u201dBut despite her words, Aiyen\u2019s anguish is palpable.She turns to Aquila, almost pleading.\u201cMother, I\u2019ve never been so sick before, to the point where I blame you for giving birth to me. I shouldn\u2019t be like this, but the words \u2018why did you give birth to me\u2019 keep coming out of my mouth.\u201dAs Aiyen sobbed, Aquila held her close.Not with the majesty of a chieftain, but with the compassion of a mother.\u201cMy dear.\u201dAquila spoke softly to Aiyen.\u201cA long time ago. Me and your father planted a tiny little seed in the dirt.\u201dIt was the first time Aquila had ever told her father\u2019s story, and Aiyen listened attentively through her fading consciousness.Aquila continued.\u201cYour father planted a seed in the soil and your mother watered it every day. Soon, the seed sprouted, and after a few months, it became a healthy, beautiful flower.\u201dAquila said, cupping her daughter Aiyen\u2019s face in her hands.Aiyen looked up at Aquila with tearful eyes.A warm, tender emotion rose between the mother and daughter that was hard to describe.Finally, Aquila finished.\u201cAnd so we picked the flower, crushed it, squeezed the juice out of it, soaked it in tobacco, smoked it, and, in a dazed and euphoric state, had unprotected sex. That day you were born.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh, and your father was executed by your grandfather the very next day for playing mean tricks with drugs.\u201dAiyen looked a little defeated after learning the secret of his birth.\u201d \u2026\u2026my body aches even more, Mother.\u201d\u201cWait a little longer. If Vikir comes with a way to cure the plague\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cForget it, don\u2019t torture my hopes, he\u2019s not coming back! What slave in the world would come back when his leash is off\u2026\u2026!?\u201dThat moment. Aquila and Aiyen\u2019s conversation was cut off.A commotion erupted from outside the door.\u201cWow, they\u2019re here!\u201d\u201d Vikir! Vikir is back!\u201d\u201cA cure! He\u2019s brought a cure!\u201dAquila, who had good ears, heard the shouts of joy from her tribe.She turned her head, her face brightening.\u201cSee, daughter, I did not tell you\u2026\u2026.\u201dBut Aquila couldn\u2019t finish her sentence.A bang!In an instant, she was up and out of her seat, smashing through the wall.As if she hadn\u2019t been sick before, she climbed down the tree and ran at full speed.Aquila stares after her, mouth agape in disbelief.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Wasn\u2019t that a red death?\u201d\u2014LOLPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You are a loyal boy. It\u2019s okay if you didn\u2019t get the cure, just the fact that you came back like this\u2026\u2026.\u201dThey seemed to misunderstand because Vikir had come empty-handed.But Vikir had definitely brought it with him.A miracle that would cure all his friends in the dephts.\u201cFollow me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dVikir tugged a dazed Ahun along, heading straight for his barracks.Ahun\u2019s barracks, right near the entrance to the village, where Ahul lay moaning.She was the first to be struck by the red death, so she was in the worst condition.Her face is now halved, but she\u2019s clean, free of dirt and foul odors, thanks to Ahun\u2019s good care.Without a second thought, Vikir took out the vial of Saint\u2019s Tears.\u2026Pow!The Saint\u2019s Tears from his pocket hadn\u2019t even opened the vial yet, yet it still exerted a strong divine power.Surprisingly, the light emanating from the saint\u2019s tears was enough to drive the red death out of Ahul\u2019s body.The red spots were disappearing.The disease that had been tormenting him for so long had vanished with such ease.\u201c\u2026\u2026! \u2026\u2026! \u2026\u2026! \u2026\u2026!\u201dAhun\u2019s eyes widened to tears at the miraculous scene.The fact that he was frozen in place, unable to even scream, gave him away.Ahun stroked Ahul\u2019s face with a trembling hand.His face was contorted and sweating, but Ahul was asleep, looking more relaxed than he had in a long time.All he could do was moan and sweat in a colorful rasp.\u201c\u2026\u2026Vikir!\u201dAhul called out breathlessly, and then a few more times in quick succession.\u201d Vikir! Vikir! Vikir! Vikir!\u201dThe tone was careful but reverent, like a devout priest saying the name of God in prayer, with infinite trust, affection, and joy.And it was the same with Ahun\u2019s closest associates.Friends who had to witness the pain and sorrow of a friend they were close enough to trust with their lives.They, too, could not help but chant his name vigorously in the face of his miraculous ability to blast away all their anxiety, bitterness, helplessness, and frustration with a single blow.\u201cVikir! Vikir! Vikir! Vikir! Vikir!\u201dThe sturdy Balak warriors stamped their feet and cheered so loudly that the floating house nearly collapsed.But Vikir remained calm in the midst of all the excitement.He had just cured one patient. There was still a long way to go.Bikir turned to Ahun and the other Balak warriors.\u201cHow many patients do you have?\u201d\u201cAbout thirty, including Ahul.\u201dVikir nodded at that.It was still a relatively small number, one that could be suppressed early.But they shouldn\u2019t let their guard down.Vikir was planning to not only destroy the entire plan of the poisonous master Leviathan, but also absorb all the ripple effects of it.\u201cWhat about the other tribes?\u201dVikir asked, and Ahun replied with a dark look.\u201cIt\u2019s hopeless. Some of them have been all but wiped out, other tribes that didn\u2019t build floating houses. But those who took your advice and built floating houses have suffered less.\u201d\u201cHow many patients are there, exactly?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, but there are a lot of them, like the herds of buffalo in those hilly fields.\u201dSomewhere in the tens of thousands.Vikir made a decision.\u201cRound up all the patients from the other tribes.\u201d\u201cHuh? Other tribes? But there are so many cures?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, there are plenty. Let\u2019s take this opportunity to show the other tribes some respect.\u201dHearing Vikir\u2019s words, Ahun and the other young warriors\u2019 faces lit up.Why should they care about the other tribes?It is not unusual for tribes to be related by friendship or blood, even if they are strangers in a distant land.They often had disputes over marriage and hunting, but they had a history of coming together in times of crisis.Upon hearing Vikir\u2019s words, Balak\u2019s warriors flew out of the village to spread the good news.Meanwhile.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir\u2019s eyes shone as he looked into the tears of the saint.\u201cWe can use this opportunity to put a lot of pressure on the Baskervilles.\u201dVikir planned to take advantage of this opportunity to unite the enemy and the barbarian forces of the Black Mountains.Baskerville is an Ironblade whose primary mission is to explore and destroy the Enemy and the Black Mountains.Baskerville\u2019s greatest enemies are not the other six Houses of the Empire.It\u2019s their enemies, the natives of the Black Mountains.The warrior clan Balak, the shaman clan Rokoko, and many other native factions are Baskerville\u2019s most feared foes.They pierced the sword-like blades of the forest with their bare skin and stomped barefoot on the forest floor, which seemed to be dotted with nails and tacks.Thousands of paces away, arrows hit willow leaves, and axes and swords cut great beasts in half.Such is the daily life of the natives of Red & Black Mountain.If Vikir could get them on his side by paying them off, he could take on the entire Baskerville family single-handedly.Moreover, if the natives were able to stem the plague early and grow stronger, they would naturally be able to put pressure on the Baskervilles and the Empire.\u201cFor that to happen, we need to remain on friendly terms with them.\u201dVikir is now a hero of Balak.But now he\u2019s about to become the hero of the entire Jungle tribe.The misdeeds of Leviathan, the Extremist, were working in Vikir\u2019s favor.\u201cWe\u2019re running out of time. We must hurry before the death toll rises.\u201dUsing the light from the saint\u2019s tears, Vikir cured all of Balak\u2019s patients.Now all that remained was to purify the water source.The tears of the saint were to be sprinkled on the teats of the jungle, on the rivers that flowed from the highest places and spread to all the lowlands.Vikir moved quickly.He\u2019d been living here for two years and already knew where the water sources were.And with him came the entire tribe.Even some of Balak\u2019s more unusual enemies bowed their heads as they entered, including the shamanic Rococo, notorious for their cannibalism, and the berserker Renaissance, whose entire tribe could take on an entire company of the Empire with a single axe.When the chieftain Aquila led them all to the source of the water.\u201cAll of you may drink of this water.\u201dBikir sprinkled the tears of a saint into the river.Suddenly, a bright light emanated from the entire vast river.It was a beautiful sight, as if the Milky Way in the night sky had descended to earth and was flowing.Mesmerized by this mysterious light, the natives spontaneously scooped up water from the river with their hands.And a miracle happened.The \u201cred death\u201d began to die.\u201cOh-oh-oh-oh!\u201dThe entire jungle erupted in a shout that seemed to carry away.Aquila, the Balak chieftain, cried out in excitement.\u201cVikir, I must appoint you shaman of our tribe!\u201dThe Night Fox praises the Night Hound.All the other tribes gathered here shout out to Vikir, each in their own language and gestures.They all have different ways of expressing themselves, but they all want to express the same thing.The expressions of love, respect, and gratitude were heartwarming.The plague patients, whether they were family members, friends, or patients themselves, dropped to one knee in front of Vikir and paid him the utmost respect.This means that everyone in the jungle is grateful to Vikir.Even the crooked old men who had been viewed unfavorably within the Balak bowed deeply to Bikir.It was heartfelt gratitude for saving their sons, daughters, sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, grandsons, and granddaughters.Meanwhile.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dVikir was looking for someone in addition to treating countless patients.A face he\u2019d heard had the Red Death, but couldn\u2019t figure out why he couldn\u2019t see.Vikir looked around for a long time, but the face he was looking for was nowhere to be found among the cloud of patients.Just then.Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.The sound of footsteps.Vikir knew from the sound alone that the person he was looking for had arrived.He turned his head.Puck.Something rushes at me at breakneck speed, slamming into me.Aiyen. She rushes forward and wraps her arms around Vikir\u2019s body.Thud!Muscles clench, bones scream.I had to raise the mana because I thought I might break my back the moment I got out of the way.Next, Vikir grabs Aiyen\u2019s cheek as she buries her face in his chest.\u201cI thought you had the Red Death?\u201dBut Aiyen\u2019s face, staring up at Vikir, was intact.There was no redness in her body, no sweat. Her complexion was normal.The only thing that bothered him was the youthful blush across her face.Just to be on the safe side, Bikir splashed some holy water on her face, but the flush didn\u2019t subside.She looks down at herself with a puzzled expression.\u201cWhat is \u2026\u2026?\u201dShe scratched her head in confusion.He looked up into Vikir\u2019s face again and said.\u201cYou\u2019re feeling better, aren\u2019t you?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 86": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Return of the Iron-blood Sword HoundCH 85Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 85 The Illiad (1)It had been several days since Vikir had returned to Balak\u2019s village.The Red Death had been completely uprooted, but its aftermath was far from over.Though freed from the horrors of the plague, many were weak from dehydration and upset stomachs, and much nourishment was needed for the sick.So the unaffected warriors hunted hard for food for their families and friends.Vikir and Aiyen were among them.\u201c\u2026\u2026shhh. Found it.\u201dAiyen was the first to spot the prey.Bikir\u2019s senses were sharpened, and he knew where it was.Two years ago, when Aiyen would say, \u201cLook, there it is!\u201d and point to it with his finger, Bikir would say, \u201cWhere? I don\u2019t see it.But now Vikir is almost as good at spotting prey as Aiyen.The prey Vikir and Aiyen have their eyes on is one they\u2019ve met before.Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-wooOn a branch, a snake swallows a large jaguar whole.A mouth as big as a catfish, a bizarrely flat snout, razor-sharp teeth.<Mushuhushu>Danger Rating : A+Size: 32 metersFound in: Ridge 8, Red and Black Mountains-Named \u2018Full-body Intestine Snake\u2019.A snake whose entire body is made up of intestines.It boasts a large mouth and appetite that can swallow an elephant in one bite, and legend has it that the giant Mushuhushu, which has lived since time immemorial, can swallow an entire country.They are famously silent as they crawl across the ground or swim through the water.At first glance, you wouldn\u2019t think it was a snake at all.Even compared to other common Mushuhushu, this old individual is more than twice as large.They can reach up to 40 meters in length, weigh more than 5 tons, and have a mid-body bridle of up to 3 meters.Considering that the average individual stops growing between 25 and 30 meters long, that\u2019s a lot of size.Aiyen carefully examined the snake.\u201cHis name is Ka\u2019ah, and he\u2019s a rival to Gustav, the lizard from the swamp far away. There\u2019s no other creature in this neighborhood that can match him.\u201dAiyen was right to be cautious.The giant Mushuhushu named Ka\u2019ah was not only huge, but it made no sound when it moved.Its natural protective coloring, silent movements, and overwhelming strength and size would have been enough to keep it as the dominant force in a region.But today it had met its match.Vikir bared his fangs at the snake.\u201cYou\u2019re old. It is time to repay the debt of the rainy season.\u201dOnce before, he had raided a Balak village.It was a night of torrential rain. He came down the overflowing river and attacked Balak\u2019s warriors.Vikir had fought it with his baskerville flesh, but he had been unable to win, and had only been able to chase it away.By then, the water had risen so much that he too was being swept away.\u201cNow the water has gone down and he\u2019s regained his territory. He must have regained a lot of strength. Look, he\u2019s got a big belly.\u201dAiyen pointed to the center of the giant python\u2019s body.In addition to the jaguar that had just gone down its throat, the snake\u2019s stomach seemed to contain several other beasts.I could tell by the way the snake\u2019s body was bulging in several places in the shape of a necklace of pearls.Aiyen drew his bow.\u201cIf we catch him, we can get the other meat inside, and since it\u2019s tenderized, it\u2019ll be perfect for feeding the patients.\u201d\u201cI agree.\u201dVikir nocked an arrow to his bow.Aiyen gave Vikir a nudge and pulled the string.\u201cIt takes a lot of muscle to draw a bow.\u201dNo wonder, given the tension of the draw.Archers actually need more arm strength than most blunt-weapon users.Especially since Aiyen\u2019s bow has a unique construction, with five strings and up to ten arrows on the string.Pulling this off requires at least several hundred kilograms of muscle strength.Obviously, it\u2019s a much harder discipline than wielding a sword or mace.And then.Puff-puff-puff.The aura-laden arrows fly out, aiming for Ka\u2019ah\u2019s neck.[\u2026\u2026shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!]By the time Ka\u2019ah realizes it, the arrows are already lodged in her throat.Pit.Vikir draws his magic sword, Beelzebub.Ka\u2019ah immediately closed the distance, aiming for Aiyen, but Vikir had been waiting for that.Vikir attacked with a barrage of arrows, but as soon as Ka\u2019ah was close enough, Vikir sliced him under the chin with Beelzebub.Snap.The hard scales snapped in half and red blood spurted out.At intermediate to advanced Graduator levels, the aura becomes thick and sticky, almost indistinguishable from blood.Vikir continues to thrust his blade, dodging Kha\u2019ah\u2019s dragon trim as it rampages around him.At this point, Ka\u2019ah tried to fight back.[Woosh! Woosh!]He gagged and threw up something.Vikir recognized Ka\u2019ah\u2019s intentions immediately.\u201d \u2026\u2026It vomits out the prey in its stomach to increase its mobility.\u201dIt was a typical attack pattern of snake-like creatures.Once they have consumed a large meal, they can lie down and remain motionless for months, and if they need to make a quick getaway in the meantime, they will vomit up the food in their stomachs to lighten their bodies so they can escape.Ka\u2019ah had lost his territory for a while due to the flooding of the river during the rainy season and hadn\u2019t been able to feed much.He has also burned a lot of calories floating down the river and fighting Vikir, so he must be starving.As such, he\u2019s currently consuming a large amount of food to replenish his strength.With a full stomach, his movements were naturally sluggish and slow.[Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle].Ka\u2019ah wanted to vomit out all the huge chunks of meat in her stomach.That alone would probably shed nearly two tons of weight.But.\u201cNo way.\u201dAiyen\u2019s arrow interrupted Ka\u2019ah\u2019s vomiting.She fired another arrow, and another, and another, until it lodged near his uvula.The target was the jaguar he had just swallowed.Aiyen\u2019s arrows penetrated the scales that Bikir had split open, pierced the tough flesh, and lodged in the jaguar\u2019s body in the esophagus beyond.It was as if giant spikes had pinned the jaguar\u2019s carcass to Ka\u2019ah esophagus.Naturally, the bodies of the other creatures Ka\u2019ah tried to vomit up would only pile up underneath the nailed and immobile jaguar, unable to pass through the esophagus.In the end, Ka\u2019ah is left with a grotesque bloated neck, unable to expel the contents of her stomach.Because of that, the movement became more unnatural, and even the view behind it was limited by the hood and ribs that swelled like that of a cobra.In more ways than one, this was good news for Vikir, who had been aiming for the snake\u2019s vital points of attack, the back of the neck and under the chin.\u2026Kwasak!Vikir stretched out Beelzebub and severed the end of Ka\u2019a\u2019s spine, the nerve cord that connects his neck to his brain.A gush of cerebral fluid, bone marrow, and blood gushes out.Baskerville carnivorous, flesh-eating. The six ambush teeth burrowed into Ka\u2019ah\u2019s body, relentless and persistent.Pow, pow, pow, pow! Thud!Vikir stubbornly pounded and pounded and pounded at the wounds that had been thrust into him.He dug and dug and dug, tearing flesh, shattering bone, and severing nerve fibers.Even. Aiyen had been aiming for Ka\u2019ah\u2019s rear all this time.Boom!Arrow after arrow lodged in the snake\u2019s genitals.\u201cHow\u2019s she doing?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir sighed inwardly at Aiyen\u2019s relaxed demeanor even in this critical moment.And then.\u2026Thump!The raging leaven snake, Mushuhushu, slammed its large body into the ground.It had been a long time since he\u2019d caught a big fish.* * * https://pindangscans.comThe warriors of Balak have gathered for a raid.They have been working hard to nourish the sick.Catfish, salmon, carp, and other fish fattened by the rainy season. Large lobsters and old lobsters from the Salt River. All sorts of nutritious mushrooms, roots, berries, and other ingredients were gathered together to make the soup.The oxbear subadult that Ahun had caught earlier was his greatest achievement so far.But the return of Vikir, Aiyen, and the wolf Baqira turns the tables again.Ahun slapped Vikir on the back and laughed heartily.\u201cNo matter what I do, I can\u2019t beat you! Hahaha!\u201dIt took all of Balak\u2019s warriors and wolves to lift and carry the giant snake.The old king, who had long ruled this corner of the depht, was now reduced to a tattered mass of meat.The lean meat was roasted, smoked, steamed, and stir-fried.The bones made into broths, medicines, and other things.The entrails and blood were boiled in water and made into soup.The highly nutritious snake meat, stir-fried in oil and roasted until fatty and golden brown, was reliably restoring the patients\u2019 strength.What\u2019s more, the meat of the other animals in Ka\u2019ah\u2019s stomach was just tender enough to be eaten by the younger patients.Everyone is grateful to Vikir, showing him respect and love.But in the midst of all the attention, Vikir had other things on his mind.\u201cI\u2019m glad I caught Mushuhushu. It paid off.The jackpot had been won.Vikir\u2019s eyes lit up as he saw Mushuhushu\u2019s soul occupying one of the three orbs of the magic sword Beelzebub.<Binge Fly \u2018Beelzebub\u2019> / Awl-1 slot: Burn \u2013 Cerberus (A+)Slot -2: Silent Heel \u2013 Mushuhushu(A+)Slot -3: Sacrum \u2013 Oxbear(A)Mushuhushu Kaa\u2019s move is in.Vikir\u2019s passive is Silent Hill, which replicates the snake\u2019s ability to make no sound when it moves.\u201c\u2026\u2026Silent Heel.\u201dEven if you\u2019re just walking around, you can turn on your heels to create the same effect as if you were walking on eggshells.This was a deceptive ability that could be incredibly helpful for survival in dephts, and even more so for assassinations, stealth, ambushes, and even journaling.Furthermore, Vikir\u2019s ability to shoot a bow would prove invaluable in the future.\u201cIt must be similar to the sound-killing skill that Adolf the Mad used in the past.\u201dOnce, when Adolf attacked Balak\u2019s hunting party to retrieve a Camus, silencing magic came in very handy.Vikir nodded as he watched the beads at the base of Beelzebub\u2019s hilt glow red from the spirit of Mushuhushu.Just then.A voice drew everyone\u2019s attention, including Vikir\u2019s.\u201cThe shaman has finished his ritual!\u201dThe sentry shouted, and the mood in the village suddenly turned sour.The Red Death had just begun, and the mysterious Ahheman, who had entered the temple to offer sacrifices and heal the sick, had finally emerged.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, it was Ahheman himself who helped Leviathan unleash the Red Death on the jungle.In fact, he had been in contact with the outside world for quite some time.Whether it\u2019s helping the Leviathans conduct clinical trials of new drugs or poisons on unknowing natives in the water, or aiding and abetting bourgeois families in their unfair trade practices.In exchange for Aheman\u2019s secret supply of natives to test poisons and medicines on, the Leviathans would freely give him new poisons or new medicines, which in turn would establish the authority of the shaman.The shaman\u2019s authority was established by secretly releasing a poison to poison a target and then using the medicine to cure the target to gain their trust.Sickness and medicine.If someone didn\u2019t obey him, he would secretly poison them and make them sick.Not only does this poison the patient, but also his friends and family.In the close-knit atmosphere of the Balak, this was only natural.Only when the patient\u2019s life seemed to be in danger would Ahheman step in.He would perform a convincing ritual, unleash a potion, and cure the patient, and his family and friends would become his devoted followers.The man\u2019s authority is unquestioned, and his family and friends bow before him.Recently, he has felt the shaman\u2019s authority waning, and he is on the verge of a crisis.The younger ones, including the chief\u2019s daughter, Aiyen, had never been sick or poisoned before, so they didn\u2019t know how to respect the shaman\u2019s authority.This had been made worse by the recent arrival of the Stranger, an unwelcome newcomer from the Empire.Young people would go hunting without the blessings of the shaman, and other rituals were considered unnecessary and superstitious.Then came a proposal from the Leviathan family.\u201cI\u2019m thinking of conducting a large-scale pestilence experiment on the water.\u201dAhheman swallowed hard at the words of the Leviathan\u2019s messenger, who was shrouded in a black cloak.The Leviathan\u2019s messenger gave him the pathogen of the Red Plague and his antidote.He was to spread the plague when the time was right, and the antidote when the time was right.Through this trial, Leviathan hoped to control the population of the Red and Black Mountain natives and accumulate clinicopathological data to break new ground.By actively cooperating, Ahheman sought to elevate the authority of the shaman on the land.So he secretly unleashed the Red Death into the river and drowned countless people in it.Now that the plague has struck and everyone is wandering in the wilderness, he will make a grand entrance, release the antidote, put the situation to rest, and enjoy the power of a chieftain.Even the cocky youngsters who had looked down on him would now look up to him with respect and awe.\u2018\u2026\u2026I\u2019ve even infected my granddaughter, just in case there was any doubt.\u2019The situation was perfect: he had made his own granddaughter a plague victim to avoid suspicion that he had deliberately released the poison and set himself up.This was Ahheman\u2019s idea.\u2026\u2026?As he walked to the center of town, he couldn\u2019t help but scratch his head.The village is overwhelmingly deserted.The sick, their families, and friends are inherently vulnerable, looking for a place to lean on.They must have pinned all their hopes on the ritualist, but no one came to greet them.\u201cAre they all gone already?Ahheman frowned. Had the plague been stronger than expected and killed all the Balak?That would be a problem. They should only be sick to the point of death. One must be alive to become a follower.Ahheman stitched the sack containing the antidote he\u2019d made in Leviathan to his side, then quickly crossed the town square.But the barracks around him were deserted.Only a frog croaked in a drained pool on the floor.Then.Ahheman froze in place.Thick smoke was rising from a corner of the village.And he could see every face he knew huddled there.All the people of Balak were there, all together.Laughing and chatting merrily, picking at the heaps of meat.\u201c????\u201dAhheman\u2019s mouth dropped open.How? How could they be so well, when he\u2019d surely seen them in the throes of red death just moments before?He rubbed his eyes with the back of his hand, but it didn\u2019t change anything.What\u2019s more, the woman in front of him, stirring the boiling pot with a ladle, is none other than his granddaughter, Ahul!Ahheman\u2019s jaw drops even further when he realizes that his granddaughter is completely healed.He turns his back on the unbelievable.He runs at the moonlight, crosses the village boundary, and heads for the water source-the same river where he released the Red Death.\u201c\u2026\u2026Huck, huck!\u201dRunning like the wind, he arrived at the water source in the blink of an eye and was once again horrified.The water source, which should have been contaminated by the Red Death, was still flowing with clear water.The white salt sandbar is still there, as are the carp swimming up the waterfall.Monkeys that should have been infected and killed by the Red Death are hopping around in the trees, and the children of the other tribes who came to catch the carp look healthy.There was no sign of death anywhere.\u201c\u2018No way, no how, how\u2026\u2026!'\u201dAhheman pulled at his hair.The moment.\u201cWhy, are you surprised to see so many of them alive?\u201dThere was a jab that cut deep into his lungs.He turned his head, furious.Then a boy appeared behind him.Vikir. His red eyes glowed at Ahheman.* * * https://pindangscans.comMeanwhile.Vikir had led all of Balak\u2019s warriors here, including Aiyen and Ahun.Aiyen remembered clearly what Vikir had told them.\u201cAs soon as the ritual is over, Ahheman will check on the villagers, and when he sees that they are well, he will run right back here.Because he was the one who sprayed the red death across the jungle.Vikir had heard of Ahheman\u2019s misdeeds before his regression.He couldn\u2019t remember Ahheman\u2019s name, but he could at least recall that he had a contact in Balak who had spread the Red Death, and that the contact was an old man in the position of shaman.\u201cThe enemy and half the natives of the Black Mountains were killed then.To fulfill his greed, Ahheman waited for the plague to reach its peak.He planned to appear at just the right time and become the savior of the entire jungle.But Ahheman missed the mark.The plague had spread out of control, and most of the patients were dying in droves.The carnage that followed was so horrific that it was recorded in the history of the empire.It was the helpless and weak civilians who were dying at the hands of the vested interests.Though the proper use of poison and medicine is a shaman\u2019s means of control, Ahheman had crossed the line. And for a long time.\u201c\u2026\u2026What is it?\u201dAhheman glared at Vikir with wary eyes, but he did nothing.All of Balak\u2019s warriors had already surrounded him.Young and old alike, they were all staring at him. With murderous eyes.It was maddening to Ahmed, who expected to be looked upon with respect.\u201cHow did they cure the plague?\u201dAhheman was at a loss for words.Then.Someone stepped in front of him.His face went white as he recognized the man.The Night Fox, chieftain of the Balak. Aquila stared down at Ahheman with a fierce glare.She held a piece of paper in her hand, an official document that she had personally obtained last night when she traveled to the Empire.\u201cHoly House Quovadis has declared a crusade against Extremist Leviathan, accusing him of artificially developing and releasing a plague known as the Red Death. This is a declaration demanding the truth about the Red Death.\u201d\u201cIs that so, and why did you send it to me\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cShaman. You think it\u2019s strange, don\u2019t you, why the plague that the Leviathans have been studying has broken out here in Dephts?\u201d\u201cI, I, I don\u2019t know. I just came out of the altar holding a sacrifice for the complete recovery of the tribe members\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dThen Aquila raised her hand, interrupting Ahheman.She exchanged a glance with Vikir beside her before speaking.\u201cNone of that. I\u2019d like to see what\u2019s in that sack at your waist.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I want to see what\u2019s in that sack at your waist.\u201dFor a moment, his heart sank.Ahheman barely held on to his mind, which was slipping away.What could it be? Why would the chief want to see the sack at his waist, and at this time?It\u2019s hard to say unless you know something.\u201c\u2026\u2026Did you even notice?\u201dAs the person responsible for spreading the red death in the waters, it was bound to make his stomach burn.Turning to Ahheman, Aquila urged him on.\u201cWhat are you doing? Get that sack out of my sight.\u201dThe chief\u2019s authority is absolute. Once the order is given, there is no appeal.But the old shaman was so flustered that he denied the chief\u2019s authority.\u201cI can\u2019t show you this, I can\u2019t show you this!\u201dHe was so flustered that he didn\u2019t know what he was talking about.But the consequences were heavy.Before he could finish, the faces of all the warriors stiffened.The younger warriors sighed and shook their heads, and the older ones furrowed their brows.The warriors\u2019 respect and loyalty to their chieftain runs deep, regardless of generation, so there was no way Ahheman could look good.\u201cHe\u2019s a creep, and I\u2019m going to take this opportunity to make him pay!\u201dAn impatient Aiyen stepped forward.\u201cOpen that sack at once!\u201dSomeone stepped forward before her.Ahun. Ahman\u2019s grandson, he was the first to step forward and open his palm in front of Ahheman.While Aiyen stood stunned by the unexpected sight, Ahun turned to Ahheman and spoke firmly.\u201cThere can be no disobedience to the chieftain\u2019s word, and if you do not open that sack immediately\u2026\u2026.\u201dAhun said, pulling an arrow from his waistband and nocking it.Then Ahheman\u2019s thick eyebrows shot up.\u201cYou rascal!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dBut Ahun\u2019s eyes never wavered.Something must have changed in his mind as he watched helplessly as his sister Ahul died of the Red Death.Soon, many of the warriors were booing at Ahheman.\u201cGive us the sack now!\u201d\u201cShow us what\u2019s inside!\u201d\u201cYou traitor, you\u2019re the culprit!\u201dAs the accusations poured in, Ahheman\u2019s face contorted more and more horribly.Then.\u201cCome on, look! Look what\u2019s inside!\u201dHe snatched the sack from his waistband.Then he flung it into the river that flowed beside the fire.Many of the warriors paused for a moment.An eerie silence.Ahheman looked back at Aquila with a triumphant smile.\u201cOops! This old man had tremor, so he dropped his sack into the river\u2026 \u2026 ?\u201dHe stammered out an excuse, then paused.Something was about to go wrong.As if on cue, the warriors chattered amongst themselves and glanced to one side.There was Vikir, arms crossed and mouth closed.Aquila looked back at him and said.\u201cIndeed. You were right. You really are throwing the sack into the river.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026what?\u201dAhhman opens his mouth in disbelief.Just then.\u201cChief, I found it!\u201dSuddenly, someone\u2019s head pops up from the surface of the river.A Balak warrior, who had been lurking in the water earlier, quickly scoops up the leather sack that Ahheman had dumped.The sack, though waterlogged, was still half full.\u201cHuh! No!\u201dAhheman jerked, but the sack was already soaked by the time he reached Aquila\u2019s hand.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAquila peered into the sack.It was half-floating in the water, but full of white powder.Aquila turned to Ahheman.\u201cThis is the antidote for the Red Death.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhy is this coming out of your hand?\u201dAhheman mouthed the words, but didn\u2019t answer.Then Aquila nodded again.\u201cIndeed. You were right again.\u201dThis time, she looked back at Bikir.When Ahheman shook his head, Aquila threw the white powder on the ground.\u201cIt\u2019s just flour, it doesn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201d\u201cI told you that you would believe this to be an antidote, and by the looks of your surprise, I\u2019m right.\u201dAhheman\u2019s expression turns to disbelief as he realizes that the powder he\u2019s holding is just flour.\u201cThat can\u2019t be right, that must be the antidote\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou have been deceived by the Leviathan family.\u201dVikir said, stepping forward.The Leviathans had used a foolish native spy to spread the plague without an antidote.I saw through his power lust and ambition.The mood of the warriors grew somber as everything Vikir had said before came true.Ahheman made a desperate plea.\u201cI, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just flour, just like he said!\u201d\u201cThen why did you hesitate earlier when I asked you to show me the sack, and why did you come to this water source where the Red Death first began?\u201d\u201cShut up, why should I tell you that!\u201dVikir demanded, and Ahheman raised the lump in his throat.But the situation wasn\u2019t going to get any easier for him.The situation was not in his favor, however, because Vikir provided even more incriminating evidence.From Vikir\u2019s arms came two letters.There were two handwritings on them, one in terrible cursive and unrecognizable, the other in a fairly neat typeface.Vikir opened his mouth to speak.\u201cThese are the letters between the Leviathans and you.\u201dThe evidence was conclusive.One of the two letters was unmistakably written in Ahheman\u2019s handwriting.The eyes of all the warriors alternated between the letters and Ahheman.Ahheman shouted in frustration.\u201cIt\u2019s a lie! I never wrote that letter!\u201dBut no one believed him.Several old elders testified that the handwriting on the letter was indeed Ahheman\u2019s.\u201cAaahhhhhhh! It\u2019s true! I\u2019m innocent! He\u2019s framing me!\u201dAhheman pointed at Vikir and jumped up and down.But Vikir, the target of the scolding, just laughs quietly to himself.Because the accusation is true.\u201cAnd here I am, thanks to my Chihuahua.\u201dVikir recalls an incident from two years ago.\u2018Mr. Chihuahua writes very well.\u2019\u2018Nothing. Since I was born, I haven\u2019t seen anyone who handles handwriting better than me. Every time the archons ask me to sign it, so I\u2019m good at imitating other people\u2019s handwriting\u2026 \u2026 .\u2019\u2018Can\u2019t I learn to do that?\u2018Of course I can teach you, it would be my honor!\u2018Thank you. Then I\u2019ll ask you whenever I have time.\u2019It was rewarding to learn the art of handwriting forged from him diligently when I was a deputy magistrate in Underdog City.It was a skill that would come in handy when it came to propaganda.\u2018Originally, agitation is easy and explanation is difficult.\u2019Vikir stared at Ahheman, who was genuinely pacing in frustration.Meanwhile, Aquila spoke up.\u201cWe should see if anyone in the Leviathan family has this handwriting.\u201dBut that would be a tall order. It would be impossible to investigate one of the seven great houses of the Empire.So, naturally, the mood within Balak turned toward denouncing Ahheman.\u201cTraitor!\u201d\u201cYou almost got my wife killed!\u201d\u201cAnd my children!\u201d\u201cKill him, hang him!\u201dPublic opinion was turning very badly.Even Ahun, his grandson, was giving him the cold shoulder, and there wasn\u2019t a single person here who was on his side.Ahheman gritted his teeth.There was no proof anyway.If the white powder in the sack turned out to be just flour, there was no point in executing him if he insisted on denying it until the end.Holding out, however dirty and deadly, was the only way to stay alive.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Enough, everyone, you\u2019re overreacting.\u201dThat was the mood before Chief Aquila opened his mouth.Every warrior turned to look at him. Ahheman did the same.Aquila coughed a few times before speaking.\u201cIf you look closely, there is no evidence. Everyone, I hope that this will no longer harm the shaman\u2019s honor. Isn\u2019t he a public servant who has been dedicated to the tribe for a long time.\u201dThen there was a murmur from all around.Aiyen spoke up in exultation.\u201cMother, no, Chief, do you mean to tell me that you\u2019re going to sweep this under the rug\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cEnough! Respect the shaman\u2019s authority! He has far more years of experience and dedication to the tribe than you do! Be polite!\u201dAt Aquila\u2019s stern words, Aiyen clamped his mouth shut.Many of the warriors looked disgruntled, but the chieftain\u2019s words were absolute, and none of them spoke.Ahheman, the one being defended, looked dumbfounded.Why would the chieftain, who had so much disliked him, take his side?But since this was the only way out, he could only bow flat to Aquila.\u201cI can only be grateful for your kindness and wisdom.\u201d\u201cIt is nothing. It is only natural if you honor the traditions of your ancestors.\u201dAhheman nodded, as if impressed.Just then, Aquila\u2019s eyes glowed deeply once more.\u201cHow dare you allow young things who know nothing to tarnish your high honor?\u201d\u201cYes, thank you, Chief.\u201d\u201cYou have nothing to thank me for. You have a reputation to uphold, not only in our tribe, but in the entire Dephts.\u201d\u201cYes. What\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe honor and pride you carry on your shoulders must be very heavy, Cancer.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cSo today, you were framed for something without evidence, so the wounds in your heart must be very great. No wonder. Because that supreme pride has been damaged.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dAhheman felt a little uneasy at the thick coating of gold.As if on cue, Aquila turned to face him.\u201cI am about to give my friend of many years, my valued colleague, the spiritual teacher of all the young men gathered here, the opportunity to defend his innocence, his honor, his pride! Do any of you have any complaints!\u201d\u201cNone ah-!\u201dEveryone who has guessed Aquila\u2019s intentions cries out at once.Vikir, who had heard it all before, stepped forward with a calm expression.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dAheman stumbles backwards as Vikir steps in front of him.He looked like he didn\u2019t know what was going on.Finally, Aquila spoke firmly to him.\u201cIf you are truly innocent, use this opportunity to defend the honor and pride you have earned. After all I\u2019ve done for you, you won\u2019t take it away from me, will you?\u201d\u201d \u2026\u2026And you say opportunity?\u201dAnxiety flickers in Ahheman\u2019s eyes as he asks cautiously.Then, Aquila spoke.\u201cI command the Illiad.\u201dThe Illiad was Balak\u2019s unique way of resolving disagreements, using force to end the conflict in the winner\u2019s favor.The color drained from Ahheman\u2019s face as he heard this.Vikir, on the other hand, laughed quietly.Evidence, proof, it didn\u2019t really matter.It was all just paving the way for this game.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It is a final, life-and-death struggle for honor in which neither side can back down.The chieftain Aquila smiled gently and turned to Ahheman.\u201cAhheman, great shaman of Balak, you are a being of high pride and shining honor, a defender of time-honored traditions, as I have said before. Will you allow such pride, honor, and tradition to be compromised?\u201dAhheman could not help but grit his teeth.He wondered why the chieftain, who had always thought of him as an eyesore, had elevated him.It was all part of laying the groundwork to make the Iliad irresistible.The veteran chieftain, Aquila, is determined to use this opportunity to remove the power of the shamans, who have taken over the chieftaincy.He has been using his daughter, Aiyen, to incite the young people to overthrow superstitions and old habits to keep the shamans in check.His grandson, Ahun, didn\u2019t take sides either.\u201cGrandfather. You always said we should honor tradition. The Iliad is our Balak tradition.\u201d\u201cShut your mouth, I know that!\u201dAhheman gritted his teeth and turned his head.Before him stood Vikir, his expression grim.The enslaved prisoner of war had been transformed into a local hero in an instant.In less than two years, a ragtag outsider had filled the position that Ahheman had longed for all his life.Ahheman felt his clothes turn inside out.His anger at Vikir flared up like a pillar of fire in an oil field.\u201cGood! I understand! I demand the Iliad from you!\u201dHearing Ahheman\u2019s proclamation, Vikir nodded without a word.It was a sign of acceptance.Patriarch Aquila spoke in a low voice that only Vikir could hear.\u201cDo you think you win\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cIf you ask me to do it, I\u2019ll do it.\u201dVikir has been a hound of the Baskervilles for over fifty years, before and after his regression.He was used to being someone else\u2019s sword.Aquila smiled with satisfaction at Vikir\u2019s answer.It felt as reassuring as a sharp knife in his hand.\u201cVery well, I believe you, son-in-law.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dFor a moment, Vikir thought he saw a reflection of Morg Adolf in Aquila.Then, all the warriors, young and old, united to fight.A place where two warriors would fight for their souls.All the warriors watched, their hands sweating.Ahheman thought to himself.\u201cThat\u2019s right. This is good. I\u2019ll take this opportunity to shake off all my bitterness and reclaim my place.\u2019He raised his searing eyes and glared at Vikir.As if everything would go back to normal if only that thing in front of him were gone.\u201cThe date is the full moon in three days,\u201d Ahheman shouted like boiling magma deep inside an active volcano.\u201cThe date is the night of the full moon in three days, the place is here, and I formally challenge you to the Iliad!\u201dFor a moment, the warriors were stunned by the ferocity of Ahheman\u2019s words.However, Vikir, who was the target of the killing, was so indifferent.Only.\u201cThree days. Let\u2019s do it now.\u201dIt\u2019s like he\u2019s just trying to get a chore done.The warriors were once again impressed by Vikir\u2019s relaxed demeanor.Ahheman, on the other hand, broke out in a cold sweat.Three days of stealthy preparation had been undone.Vikir knows this, which is why he hasn\u2019t given Ahheman time to think.\u201cThat\u2019s what shamans do.\u201dHe\u2019s trying to slow down the Iliad with his usual bravado, but it\u2019s no use.Vikir, too, is a worn and tattered old man who has seen it all, but he is no match for Ahheman.In fact, as a man who has lived through an age of destruction, he is superior to the old shaman in the art of conspiracy.\u201cThe Iliad gives the challenger the right to choose the date and place, by tradition, doesn\u2019t it?\u201dAt Vikir\u2019s words, Ahheman makes a pained sound.He\u2019s the one who\u2019s always been vocal about the need to honor tradition, so he\u2019s at a loss for words when tradition is brought up in this situation.Self-absorbed and self-absorbed, his own words are weighing him down.Seeing this, Aiyen chuckled.\u201cAs expected, Ahhemman\u2019s is Ahhemman.\u201dAiyen muttered something accusatory, then turned his head to the side.He saw his loyal subordinate, trusted ally, and close friend, the wolf Bakira, sitting stoically beside him.Aiyen stroked Bakira\u2019s fluffy ears and leaned in close to whisper quietly.\u201cGo to the village and tell them to prepare to welcome the winner of the Iliad.\u201dThe instructions were for those who remained in the village to prepare a reception for Vikir.But.\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201dVikir turned to Aiyen.When Aiyen\u2019s eyes narrowed, Vikir turned his head and replied.\u201cIf you get your hopes up, you\u2019ll always get the opposite result.\u201dIt\u2019s hard to prepare for variables when you\u2019re so sure.Vikir watched Ahheman grit his teeth in the distance.He was a shaman, so there were many surprises in battle.Vikir had fought countless shamans, warlocks, alchemists, and the like throughout the Age of Destruction, and almost every time, there had been a surprise counterattack.In the end, Vikir was always the victor, but they always had a hand they kept hidden just before they died, and Vikir was used to that.\u201cI don\u2019t let my guard down even one percent.A hound does his best to catch a rabbit.This is especially true when the prey is an old raccoon.Vikir reviewed all the information he had before the regression, checking off each of the possible contingencies.Seeing Vikir\u2019s cautiousness, Aiyen became cautious as well.She wanted to be as helpful as possible, so she told him everything she knew about Ahheman.There came a point in the story where Vikir\u2019s ears perked up for a moment.\u201cWait a minute. Tell me about that part again.\u201dSeeing Vikir\u2019s interest, Aiyen opened his mouth excitedly.\u201cWhich part are you referring to, Ahheman\u2019s taste in underwear colors? According to the boy in charge of the laundry, he prefers tight, leopard-print pelts\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201d \u2026\u2026Before that.\u201d\u201cOh, you mean his birth background?\u201dAiyen whispered to Bikir, repeating what she had heard from Aquila.At this point, it was a secret that no one knew except for Aquila, Aiyen, and Ahheman himself.\u201cAhheman is not a native of Balak. He was originally a member of another tribe and was kidnapped as a child. He was probably around the same age as you, Vikir.\u201dVikir was a little surprised to hear that.He\u2019d thought he\u2019d been a native Balak for generations before tradition got in the way, but he was actually an outsider.I was even more surprised by what Aiyen said next.\u201cHe went around saying that he was captured for son-in-law hunting, but\u2026 \u2026 In fact, he was taken as a slave. To the shaman at the time who enjoyed sodomy.\u201dPerhaps because he was an outsider who had been taken as a slave as a teenager, Ahheman saw himself in Vikir.It was a kind of homophobia. \u2026\u2026Since Vikir, who had been like that, followed all the ideal routes and became a hero respected by everyone, Ahheman\u2019s stomach was bound to get even worse.\u201cAnyway. He was a sex slave, waiting for an opportunity, and one day he killed a shaman and took his powers.\u201dAiyen went on to recount the bloody struggle Ahheman went through afterward to fit into Balak\u2019s society.\u201cHe had no place in a Balak society that valued physical strength, and he was despised for killing the shaman who had raised him, so he would do anything to be accepted by his people.\u201dHe took on all the village\u2019s odd jobs, from scavenging human and wolf feces to driving in dangerous game and serving as bait.It was not uncommon for him to rise at the crack of dawn and hold the shoes of the previous chieftain in his arms, warming them with his body heat.At that time, to impress Aquila, who was still a child, he put her on his back and crawled on all fours, imitating a dog.And by the time \u2026\u2026 he was accepted as a member of the tribe\u2019s society, his gray hair had already grayed.As an old man, he couldn\u2019t help but notice the privileges of his youth that he hadn\u2019t been able to enjoy.The blood, violence, and impulses that had been pent up in his youth, unleashed to their fullest extent, rose to the surface with a sense of compensation.And so he sought to overthrow the authority of his chieftain, Aquila, and devour Balak, and the entire jungle.Outside the walls, he even joined hands with the Imperial House of Leviathan!Meanwhile, Vikir suddenly had a question.\u201c\u2026\u2026So, what tribe was Ahheman originally from?\u201d\u201cHmmm. I don\u2019t know about that.\u201dVikir nodded at Aiyen\u2019s answer.It doesn\u2019t really matter at this point.Meanwhile, Ahheman had been fidgeting nervously since earlier.It only intensified when Vikir entered the battlefield for the Iliad.Like a seasoned hound, Vikir takes his time, slowly, gradually, tightening the leash on his prey with each step.Prepared for every eventuality, Vikir heads into battle.But before the Iliad could unfold, a deadly twist occurred that even the mighty Vikir could not have anticipated.\u2026Boom!A foot stamped the ground once behind him.And then someone grabbed Vikir\u2019s wrist and yanked him backward.Vikir turned his head.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dLips brush against Vikir\u2019s lips.Aiyen, whose head has shrunk in the last two years, stares up at Vikir with a ravenous gaze.\u201cWin and come back. I\u2019ll give you something better.\u201dShe smirked and shoved Vikir in the chest.Vikir thought about saying something in Moorish, but decided otherwise.This isn\u2019t the most important thing right now.Now.\u2026Cha-ang!Beelzebub slices through the artery in his wrist, revealing his black teeth.It was the moment when the leash of the Iron-Blooded Sword\u2019s Hound was released.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Here\u2019s a good one.\u201dHe crouched down and found something beneath the roots.It was a large centipede with a red body and black legs.He pulled out an arrow and nocked it in the centipede\u2019s head.The centipede\u2019s head shattered, spilling its venomous brain matter onto the arrowhead.Ahheman has also laid out vines on the ground that are translucent and hard to see, but unbreakable and strong enough to cut through.If your opponent jumps on one, they\u2019re sure to get cut, and if they\u2019re lucky, they might even get their ankle amputated.I also spread dry sand and fallen leaves over the muddy pit, where the ground is soft and you\u2019re bound to get stuck, and I dropped a few honeycombs, where the fierce bees are sleeping, ready to wake them up at any moment.\u201cJust wait and see.\u201dAhheman gripped the poisoned arrow in his hand tightly, waiting for Vikir\u2019s figure to emerge from the dense foliage.Just then.\u201c\u2026\u2026Who are you waiting for?\u201dThe cold voice touches his ears and he freezes.A shudder rippled through his body.He turns his head, barely holding on to his falling heart, and sees Vikir\u2019s expressionless face looming behind him.\u201cUh, how!\u201dHow did he get this far without making a sound?But Ahheman can\u2019t bring himself to ask the question out loud.Vikir has sliced the awl in his hand to the side.Hit.Bikir sliced through all the ankle-cutting vines that Ahheman had set up.He scrambled backwards to get away from it, stepped in a puddle of mud he had hidden, and was up to his waist in water, dropping a few beehives in the process.Weeeeeeeeeee-.The homeless wasps vented their anger at Ahheman in the mud pit.Vikir quietly backed away, while Ahheman flailed his hands in the mud, trying to swat the bees away.Ahheman narrowly escapes death by diving into the mud for a long time.But his body was already swollen with bee stings.Meanwhile. Ahheman had just crawled out of the mud when Vikir climbed up a tree trunk and yawned.\u201cWhat the fuck!\u201dAhheman hung the arrow in protest.The centipede venom had been washed away when he fell into the mud, but the sharpness of the arrowhead was intimidating enough.Boom.The mud on the bowstring flies off in all directions.A powerful arrow shot vertically, aimed at Vikir.But.Boom.A crimson slash flew out, slicing Ahheman\u2019s arrow in two.Before he could react, Vikir vanished like a ghost and landed on Ahheman\u2019s back.Ahheman\u2019s eyes were gouged out, bleeding profusely.Vikir\u2019s speed was one thing, but\u2026\u2026 if there was something more amazing.\u201cNo sound!?Vikir was moving so fast, yet there was no sound.Obviously, Vikir was moving at a tremendous speed in front of me, but I couldn\u2019t hear anything.His feet crunching through the grass, splashing through the mud, breaking branches, stomping over stones and logs.All of these sounds are inaudible. Or if they did, they were so faint that they were drowned out by the buzzing of grasshoppers around them.\u201cMu, what tricks are you playing, you bastard!\u201dAhheman fired arrow after arrow, but they only managed to hit a few Aman orangutans in the trees.Then, Vikir\u2019s magic sword, Beelzebub, began to spit out a black aura.The liquid aura, sticky as honey and tainted with blood, was an unmistakable indication of the Graduator\u2019s advanced level.Ahheman was stunned by the level of aura that even Balak\u2019s most seasoned veteran warriors could not easily manifest.\u2018This kid was this strong!\u2019It\u2019s a fighting power that doesn\u2019t match his age at all.Ahheman was only too eager to retreat backwards.But the hound\u2019s six teeth never let go of its prey.Carnivorous, Baskerville.Six ambush teeth lurked and leapt out, tearing at Ahheman\u2019s entire body.What\u2019s more, wherever the blade\u2019s teeth grazed, a searing sting followed.Moreover, a hot burning pain always visited the place where the teeth of the blade brushed past.The infernal flames, visible only to Bikir\u2019s eyes, were burning directly into Ahheman\u2019s soul.\u201cAaaahhhh!\u201dAhheman shuddered in unintelligible pain.It was natural to feel pain when one\u2019s flesh is cut by a sword, but the pain from Bikir\u2019s blade was strangely intense.He had been struck by swords, spears, and arrows countless times in his nearly seventy years of life, but he had never felt such pain.It was as if he had been cut open with a flaming knife, flesh by flesh, and even now the flames were burning through his skin, consuming his flesh and fat.Of course, the Balak warriors watching the spectacle were unaware of any of this, and could only squeal at the slightest cut, showing their contempt for Ahheman.\u201cUgh!\u201dAhheman eventually dropped the pretense.Honor, pride, tradition, none of that matters now.Balak\u2019s warriors booed as Ahheman fled in disgrace, having challenged the younger warrior first.Woo-woo-woo!The chorus of accusations and jeers from across the dense foliage made it seem as if the entire jungle was condemning him.He backed away in a huff and turned to fire another arrow at Vikir.But he hadn\u2019t thought of that.Vikir, too, had spent the last two years studying archery with Aiyen, and had become quite a skilled archer.Ping-!An arrow flew in a parabolic arc.\u2026Puck!The arrow struck right into Ahheman\u2019s groin.\u201cUgh!\u201dAhmed\u2019s eyes flew open.He strained his eyes so hard that the flesh around his eyes was torn and tears of blood flowed.Then, clutching his groin, he collapsed and the leaves in front of him scattered.Rustle.Vikir walked out, his face expressionless.\u201cYou coveted an oxbear\u2019s genitals, and now you\u2019ve earned it.\u201dTwo years ago, Vikir had demanded a decoction of the genitals of his hunted prey.Remembering it, he bit his lip until it bled.\u201cYou\u2019re playing with me!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to, you\u2019re not good enough to be my plaything.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u2026 Ugh!\u201dWith that, Ahheman staggered to his feet, dropping the sword and bow in his hand.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dVikir felt things take a turn for the worse.The wind shifted.Dark mana was gathering around them.They crackled sinisterly, converging on a single point. The palms of Ahheman\u2019s hands!\u2018\u2026\u2026Good. A shaman, I see.Vikir had been expecting a trick up his sleeve.The man drew a number with his blood-stained palms and chanted a strange incantation.The next moment, a dark current swept through the area, extending from his hands.Crackle, crackle, crackle!Vikir jerked back as he felt several individuals reaching for his ankles.To his surprise, several figures stood in his way.They were orangutan carcasses with rotting flesh and exposed bones.Ahheman had used witchcraft to resurrect the corpses of the orangutans he had shot with his arrows earlier.\u201cIt\u2019s like this. \u2026 \u2026 Right. Was Ahhemman from the Rococo tribe?\u201dVikir remembered what Aiyen had told him before they had begun the Iliad.Ahheman was essentially an outsider, but it turns out he was from the Rokoko, a tribe of shamans.Known to the natives of Depht as witchcraft, and to the Empire as a form of black magic, this bizarre practice of resuscitating the dead is one of them.It was also the specialty of the shamanic Rokoko people.In his haste, Ahheman raised the freshly dead orangutan zombies and skeletons to escort him.\u201cHeh heh\u2026\u2026 heh heh heh heh, the Iliad is unorthodox combat, it doesn\u2019t mean you have to fight with swords and bows!\u201dBut in the physicality-oriented atmosphere of Balak, Ahheman\u2019s behavior was frowned upon by many of the warriors.It seemed that while all the warriors had little interest in spells, he had been diligently studying and mastering them on his own.\u201cGo! Go stop him! Buy me time to heal him!\u201dAhheman called for the orangutans to block Vikir\u2019s path.Orangutans are almost as tall as humans and can weigh up to 100 kilograms, which should be enough to buy them some time as meat shields.Ahheman thought so.But.\u201cHmmm. Not as good as I thought.\u201dVikir stamped his foot, still sounding unimpressed.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dAhheman opens his mouth, wanting something.Puh-lease!Something shuts his mouth in an instant.It\u2019s a tremendous impact that knocks him off his feet and onto his back!The impact ripped the skin off his back, broke his spine, and dislodged all of his internal organs.Not surprisingly, the orangutan carcasses next to him were also reduced to a pool of blood and crushed to the ground in an instant.Only Vikir stood back, not making a sound, not making a move.\u201c????\u201dAhheman looked up, saliva dripping from the corner of his mouth. Aside from the pain, he is at a loss for words.His vision flips, and a giant shadow looms over him.[Grrrr\u2026\u2026]The hulking creature pricked up its ears to see if it could see.An old female oxbear thrusts her massive forepaws at AhhemanPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hmph!\u201dAdd to that the fact that his back, which had been struck by Oxbear\u2019s forepaw just moments before, was now feeling the impact.The slowly recognizable pain, and the constant barrage of pain, eventually forced Ahheman\u2019s bloodied lips to twist open.\u201cAaaaaaah!\u201dAnd Oxbear responded to the sound immediately.Thwack!Oxbear slammed its front paws together, sending the lower half of Ahheman flying.He spun like a top and crashed into a tree, his legs and back bent in a strange way.[Crunch!]Oxbear once again unleashed his fury on the intruder.[Screech- Screech-]Her ears perk up at the sound of a cry from behind her.He spun around to see two wide-eyed Oxbear cubs.Their sturdy builds were uncharacteristic of cubs, and their glowing eyes hinted at intelligence.The female oxbear snorted at the intruders before turning back to her cubs.At this point, she must have decided that she had demonstrated her motherly majesty and resolve.And then.Vikir reappeared outside the bush.Ahheman was lying on the ground, motionless.But he was clearly still breathing, as his shaky breathing could be felt.Rustle-pass-sacThe leaves rustled around him.The warriors of Balak, who have been watching the Iliad, are gathering.All the warriors surrounded Vikir and Ahheman.The winners and losers were all too clear. Vikir was unscathed, and Ahheman, though alive, was literally hanging on for his life.\u201cIt\u2019s over. We have a winner.\u201d\u201cAt this point, doesn\u2019t it matter if Ahheman is innocent or not?\u201d\u201cRegardless of who\u2019s the innocent one, Ahheman was just too ugly.\u201d\u201cI think it turned out very well.\u201dThe warriors each had their say.From the Red Plague to the present day Iliad, they\u2019d all had their own disappointments with Ahheman, big and small.And as he listened to what they had to say about him, he sank to the ground like a worm, shivering.\u201cWhy! Why!\u201dAhheman was screaming.What was the difference between him and this Vikir in front of him?Why is his path so different from his own, even though they were both brought as slaves from a foreign land?He thought of all the years of misery he had endured.And all that Vikir had.Youth. The daughter of a chieftain who followed him. The trust of all her peers around it. The support and love of his tribe years ago. Her extraordinary abilities and radiant appearance.And yet, that glint in those eyes, as if he didn\u2019t care about any of it.\u201c\u2026\u2026! \u2026\u2026! \u2026\u2026!\u201dAhheman gritted his teeth. He grinded his gums, even though all his teeth were missing.He tore his eyes away from Vikir and looked at himself.Old. An old shaman who treated himself like a sex puppet. Despised and ignored by all his friends. Used and abandoned by the Empire. Unrecognized abilities and a body that was now crippled.The inferiority complex, defeat, hatred, anger, resentment, and compensatory feelings of an old man who has lost everything to a young man who has everything.And.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAhun quickly turns away from the gaze that met his.The last straw. His grandson\u2019s exterior ignited Ahheman\u2019s emotions, causing them to explode.Meanwhile.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAhun\u2019s head was turned away, his fists balled tightly.Then a hand clapped him on the shoulder.Vikir. He looked at Ahun with calm eyes.\u201cHow about taking care of it with your own hands?\u201d he said.\u201c\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t want to.\u201dAhun shook his head. He almost lost his sister during the Red Death.He could never forgive his grandfather for that.There was also bitterness and anger at the way he had treated her and his sister all these years.But Vikir shook his head.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing to protect him at the last minute. It\u2019s not just for the sake of justice, but also to prevent any unforeseen situation\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cEnough! That coward deserves to die, he\u2019s not worthy of pity!\u201dAhun slapped Vikir\u2019s hand away and turned away once more.Just then.Ku-oh-oh-oh!Something happened.All over the grounds, strange currents of mana began to form.Crackle, crackle, crackle!The sound of bones interlocking, and the corpses of the orangutans that had been struck by Oxbear\u2019s front paws earlier began to rise again.They shed their heavy garments of rotting flesh and picked up their skeletal bodies.Balak\u2019s warriors cringed at the sight of the dead.The orangutan corpses soon moved like strung marionettes, walking over to help Ahheman to his feet.Then. He raised his bloodshot eyes to look at Vikir, to Ahun beside him, and to all of Balak\u2019s warriors beyond.\u201d \u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t need you. All of you.\u201dAhheman gave up. He wasn\u2019t talking about the Iliad.He meant giving up everything he had as a warrior of Balak.And.As soon as one Balak was gone, one Rococo was born.As soon as he abandoned his warrior\u2019s pride, Ahheman began to practice a part of command that had been taboo, even practiced within the Rococo itself.A forbidden incantation to call the dead back to the land of the living.When the Balak warriors heard him recite the incantation, they gave him a look of disdain.\u201cWhat is this, another one of your stupid resurrection spells?\u201d\u201cHow ugly. Even though you claim to be a shaman,\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut what can we do, we don\u2019t even have monkeys to resurrect anymore!\u201dThere are no more dead bodies in this neighborhood.At most, a few orangutans here were the only dead that Ahheman could raise.But.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dVikir snapped.He realized that Ahheman\u2019s spell was not directed here, but a little further away.Vikir turned his head to follow the direction of the black mana stream.There he saw a familiar place.A valley and waterfall rising high above the low rolling hills, and a spring of dragon\u2019s water flowing beneath it.It was the Tomb of the Brave, where all of Balak\u2019s ancestors were said to be buried.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Woodchuck! Woodchuck! Woodchuck!Such were the undead that were now crawling out of the valiant\u2019s grave.\u201c\u2026\u2026This is unbelievable!\u201dAiyen\u2019s mouth dropped open.Crawling out of the stone and dirt tombs in the valley, they were skeletons, skinny and dry.They wore shrouds made of black panther pelts, and their eyes glowed with the black emptiness of skeletons.They were once, long ago, great warriors and leaders of the Balak.Carrying bows, spears, swords, axes\u2026\u2026 and their buried loved ones, the undead have risen to the surface and are swarming this way in unison.<Death Knight>Danger Rating : A ~ SSize : ?Found in : ?-Named \u2018Death Knight\u2019.A corrupted and transformed being who once touched the heights of the living, the dark mana they draw from their souls and bodies is held as collateral until every muscle and vein in their bodies bursts.Most lose their sanity and spew empty hatred and blind rage.However, sometimes there are death knights with intelligence, but it is said that there are only seven cases in human history where such objects have appeared.Usually, Death Knights are fierce and aggressive, and to compensate for this, they are often equipped with thick, heavy armor.But the resurrected ancestors of Balak were approaching with the speed of the wind, wearing nothing but a fluttering robe on the dark currents.Answering the maddening hatred that Ahheman was spewing.Then, Chief Aquila spoke.\u201cAll, prepare for battle!\u201dAs soon as the words left, Aiyen drew his bow and fired.Aiming for Ahheman, who struggled on the ground.But one of the Death Knights, running at breakneck speed, fired an arrow before he could.Puff, puff, puff!Arrows of tremendous power flew out and began to escort Ahheman.\u201cHeh-heh heh! die all! All gone!\u201dHiding behind the Death Knights, Ahheman was rapidly aging.He had stretched his life force beyond its limits, manipulating the Death Knights.Soon, the skeletal, faceless Deathknights stood in the way of Balak\u2019s warriors with swords and spears.The warriors of Balak face the past and the present at once.The warriors of the Old Era and the warriors of the New Era face off against each other.\u201cThe time has come to teach the heroes of the past a lesson. How scary the kids are these days!\u201dAiyen fired the first arrow.Ping-!Her arrow was filled with a powerful silver aura.However, to her surprise, the Death Knight in front of her grabbed the arrow with his hand.\u2026Crisp!The arrow was blocked, but there was no way he could have gotten away with holding it with his bare hands.The Death Knight shook his head as he watched the hand that held the arrow turn to dust and crumble.Perhaps when he was alive, he would have had no trouble catching it.But now, weakened as he was by decay, he would not have been able to adapt to his deteriorated body.Then.Boom!The Death Knight behind him swung his sword.A sharp blow flew out, slicing through everything in its path.The speed was faster than expected, causing Aiyen to panic.\u2026Boom!There was someone who deflected the Death Knight\u2019s blow. It was Vikir.And now.Vikir scattered his hands towards the two charging Death Knights.A moment. A white powder flew from Vikir\u2019s hands and landed in the faces of the Death Knights.Chiiiit!Smoke billowed out, accompanied by the sound of burning leather.The Death Knights grimaced in pain and stepped back.\u201cBe careful. Each one is a named demon.\u201dAiyen giggled at Vikir\u2019s advice.She bent at the waist and stuck her ass out as far as it would go, patting Vikir\u2019s thigh.\u201cAfter all, you are the only man I can trust with my back.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh, of course, I\u2019m asking you to cover my rear in battle. I hope you don\u2019t misunderstand.\u201dAiyen is amused by Vikir\u2019s reaction, even in such a desperate moment.But in all fairness, now was not the time for playful teasing.The Death Knights were flying, their attacks growing stronger and sharper.Aiyen\u2019s expression hardened.\u201cVikir, how did you do that?\u201dHe was asking how Vikir had chased away two Death Knights just a moment ago.Vikir answered easily.\u201cSalt. The undead are weak to salt.\u201dHe was right. There\u2019s no better way to cleanse the unholy than with salt.Vikir picked up a handful of salt, which lay like white sand on the banks of a cascading river outside the battlefield of the Iliad, and sprinkled it on the Death Knight.Soon, the white salt burned black and made a loud crackling sound.Deathknight jumped back as the salt touched his body, and that was just in time to counterattack.\u2026Puff!Vikir grabbed the Death Knight\u2019s back as he flinched from the salt, and promptly punctured his temple with Beelzebub.Then the Balak warriors, who had been struggling to hold the Death Knights at bay, found a way through.\u201cSalt! Salt!\u201d\u201cEveryone, imitate Vikir!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true! It\u2019s working!\u201dStill, the Balak warriors were reluctant to wound their ancestors.They sprinkled the river\u2019s salts with minimal contact, hoping to avoid hand-to-hand combat while still honoring their ancestors.Moreover, as Ahheman\u2019s Turning Point reached its climax, the Death Knights began to be picked off one by one.Chief Aquila sneered.\u201cYour ancestors were not meant to be manipulated by the Necrons.\u201dHis mockery was directed at the dying Ahheman.The moment.\u201cKuhhhhh\u2026 \u2026 Yes, quality rather than quantity.\u201dAhheman laughed grimly.He smeared his face with his own blood, drawing intricate lines of incantation. He began to draw upon his life force, drawing upon it beyond life itself.Even his soul would struggle in agony for eons after death.But nevertheless, Ahheman was forced to use this forbidden spell.\u2026thud, thud, thud, thud, thud, thud!One by one, the Death Knights around him began to fall apart.But despite this, Ahheman kept his eyes closed and kept muttering something.\u201c\u2026\u2026I found it! I found it! I found it! He lay in the depths of the abyss, alone and without a grave! Oh, yes, He really was there!\u201dDark mana swirled wildly around him.The other warriors of Balak could barely keep their balance in the midst of it all.\u201c\u2026\u2026It is time to end it all.\u201dThe night fox, the chieftain, Aquilaman, stood tall and glared at Ahheman.Then her arrow struck him in the forehead.Pow!A single silver arrow shot through the dark storm.It seemed self-evident that in a matter of seconds, it would blow a gaping hole in his skull.But.Kwagik-.To his horror, Aquila\u2019s arrow stopped midway.Aquila\u2019s arrow, the unstoppable force in the current depht, had been caught by someone else\u2019s hand.\u201c\u2026\u2026!?\u201dAll of Balak\u2019s warriors looked up in astonishment.It was a lanky man who caught the arrow with his bare hands.A man dressed in a raggedy shroud.His face was skeletal and leathery, his lips missing, leaving his gums and teeth exposed.The shroud fluttered in the breeze, woven in a style from a long, long time ago.Thick strong bones, tall stature, and the power to catch Aquila\u2019s arrows with her bare hands.No one had ever guessed the identity of this long-ago ancestor.Only one. Except for Aquila.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dAquila turned her trembling gaze to the undead orb before her.She had heard the legends of all the great chieftains and heroes of Balak since she was a child.She\u2019d always thought she could do that.Blessed potential, endless possibilities, a once-in-a-century talent.Aquila was actually considered one of the most capable chieftains of all time, so he had no qualms about comparing himself to the legendary warriors of old.\u2026\u2026except for one person.A hero who had single-handedly declared war on the Empire, who had won declarations of surrender, who had subjugated all the tribes of the Depht, who had led Balak to his greatest heights, and in the face of all these immense accomplishments, even the arrogant Aquila could only sincerely admire.The eternal myth of the Balak, a spiritual being.Adonai, the greatest archer since history began to be written.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Bowmaster, the most powerful archer who ever lived.She is Adonai.Ever since the history of Balak began to be written down, Adonai, the archer who was known to be the strongest, appeared in front of Aquila, who was far from learning.Short gray hair, parched skin on his face, sagging lips and clearly visible teeth.Every time the black shroud covering the whole body swayed in a black aura, the large bow slung on the back was revealed.It was a bowstring with a very pointed tip and emitted a very black color.It had a strange appearance, like two legs of an insect that had been bent and connected.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir stood still, staring at the Adonai before him.It had been a long time since he\u2019d been this close to a Master-level being, a being that touched the heights of the Supreme.The power emanating from Adonai was as wild and vicious as Hugo Baskerville\u2019s.Perhaps because he is a Death Knight, it feels even more so.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Author is Adonai the Archer.Terror of the empire, hero of the barbarians.It was a strange feeling to see a figure I\u2019d only heard about in jungle mythology.But my wonder was short-lived.The next moment, Adonai raised his great black bow.There were no strings or arrows on the bow.But as Adonai grasped the air with the opposite hand from the one that held the bow, a cool current of air formed a thin thread from tip to tip of the bow.It\u2019s like a spider spinning a thread.Sssssss\u2026\u2026To Adonai\u2019s surprise, the black air currents connected pole to pole of the bow.Adonai snapped his fingers once, then released them.Then, an arrow made of aura was created and nocked on the bowstring, which was also made of aura.Quack!Adonai pulled and released the bowstring, and an arrow of dark aura shot out.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dVikir narrowed his eyes.The speed was so fast that even Vikir, a Advance Graduator, couldn\u2019t see properly!It was only through half instinct and half luck that Vikir was able to deflect the arrow by extending the Beelzebub on his wrist as far as it would go.Boom!Adonai\u2019s arrow flew on a trajectory deflected by Vikir\u2019s sword, and it punched a hole in a huge log.Crunch! Quack!Not only is the log pierced, but the cliffside rocks behind it crumble with a thunderous crash.It was a sight to behold, as if they had been scattered by countless blades.Adonai\u2019s arrows are monstrous creatures that devastate their surroundings with just a glance.It would be unimaginable to face them head-on.\u201c\u2026\u2026Hmm.\u201dVikir furrowed his brow and drooled.Despite the obvious deflection, his wrist was stiff and his arm tingled.Beyond the torn muscles in his forearm, he must have cracked his wrist bone.The liquid aura on Beelzebub was also torn to shreds.Adonai\u2019s aura bolts have the density of extremely hard solids, the realm of a master.No wonder it couldn\u2019t be defeated by a Graduator-class liquid aura.Even.Tsutsutsutsuts\u2026\u2026The log sniped by Adonai\u2019s aura began to wither and die.The poison was strong enough to kill a giant tree that could have lived for hundreds of years in an instant.Vikir\u2019s attention was drawn once more to the large black bow that Adonai held.At first glance, it looks impossibly large and long, but it is solid and light, almost weightless.Pointed at both ends and sprouting horn-like spikes in the middle, it looked like two insect legs glued together.Vikir realized its identity at a glance.\u201c\u2026\u2026 The remains of Madame Eight-Legged.When I met Madame Eight Legs the other day, I confirmed that all eight legs were attached, so it was probably made from fragments of her body before shedding her skin.This reminded me of something Aiyen had once said.\u201c\u2018Adonai was the only one who could stand toe-to-toe with the Madame of the Eight Legs. Now that you are a young Balak, honor him. And pride in being her descendant.\u2019Adonai remembered that in the past, he had dueled Madame Eight-Legged and won.The bow was made from her ruins, and her vile poisonous aura was imbued into the bow itself.The fearsome black bow must have retained its poisonous power long after Adonai died and was buried with her.\u201cI\u2019m in trouble.\u201dVikir clicked his tongue.He was up against a Swordmaster, or perhaps even a more difficult Bowmaster.The Death Knight\u2019s flaw is that he attacks recklessly and haphazardly, which in close quarters can leave him open and vulnerable, but\u2026\u2026.Poof! Pow! Quack quack quack!In a long-distance fight, it becomes a unified offense.Adonai fired off a series of aura arrows.Dark solid auras, even poisonous ones.They tore through Vikir\u2019s black liquid aura, tearing it to shreds.Vikir loaded his aura onto Beelzebub and swung it long.Baskerville Carnivore.Six fangs drew a blackened trail of blood, but even so, it was pushed back.Even a warrior of the Graduator\u2019s rank would be powerless against a master.A liquid cannot defeat a solid.However, the reason Vikir was still alive was due to the protection of the Styx River, the strength and mana regeneration of his body, and the power of the monster that the magic sword Beelzebub was sealing.\u201c\u2026\u2026! \u2026\u2026! \u2026\u2026!\u201dVikir had gained weight with Oxbear\u2019s sacroiliac spell, which allowed him to withstand Adonai\u2019s arrows without being knocked back.But even the six ambush hits from the Baskervilles are not enough to stop Adonai\u2019s arrow showers.Each of Adonai\u2019s arrows was stronger, harder, and more numerous than each of Vikir\u2019s teeth.What\u2019s more, the aura of her bowstring and arrows never wore out or dropped.Adonai was simply unleashing an endless barrage of the overflowing negative dimensional energy characteristic of Death Knights.Boom! Crackle! Puck! Puck!Deciding that a head-to-head battle was out of the question, Vikir swung his blade sideways to deflect the arrows, but was nonetheless gradually being pushed backward.The large mana reservoirs of the Graduator were already running low.The aura radiating from Beelzebub was popping like honey from a hammer whenever it came into contact with Adonai\u2019s aura.Even his shaking wrists told him that he was at his limit.There were many bad news reports coming from all over the body.\u2018\u2026\u2026 At this rate, I\u2019ll be an arrow in the quiver.Vikir tried to move quickly to get out of the way, but Adonai was faster than Vikir,.Closing the distance would be impossible as the arrows would fly like crazy, and opening the distance would be suicide against a Bowmaster level archer.A sneak attack might have worked, but there\u2019s no way to win a head-to-head fight.Of course, I don\u2019t mean how to win, but how to survive.\u2018\u2026\u2026I need to kill at least Ahheman.\u2019But with Adonai standing firmly in his way, that was impossible.All the warriors of Balak fired arrows in unison, but they were all blocked by Adonai\u2019s shroud and the body of the black bow.Just as Vikir was in the midst of thinking.\u2026Puck!There was a kick to Vikir\u2019s cheek.\u201cSlave, to the side!\u201dAiyen stretched out her long legs and shoved Vikir\u2019s head away.Pow!A black flash of light flew in a black trajectory to the place where Vikir\u2019s head was just a moment ago.\u2026PIT!A long, thin gash appears on Aiyen\u2019s calf.Meanwhile, Vikir wiped the blood from his forehead and said.\u201cThank you. Better to die of a concussion than an arrow.\u201d\u201cNo time to slack off, here they come again!\u201dAiyen reached out and grabbed Vikir by the nape of his neck.An arrow of black aura struck the ground where Vikir\u2019s groin had been just moments before, tearing a deep hole.\u201c\u2026\u2026You\u2019re aiming for the groin, too. So much for the rush of the male.\u201dVikir smirked at Aiyen\u2019s narrowed eyes.\u201c\u2018Not so fast. To the great Adonai.\u201d\u201cFor now, you\u2019re just Ahheman\u2019s puppet. After you have attained perfection.\u201dAiyen quickly fed arrows into his bow.A dozen arrows flew at breakneck speed, aimed at Adonai.Then they broke off into different trajectories, each aimed at a different part of Adonai\u2019s body.But.Puff-puff-puff-puff-puff-puff!With a flick of his hand, Adonai caught all ten arrows coming from ten different directions.Woof!As if that wasn\u2019t enough, he clenched his fist tightly, breaking all ten of the arrows and causing them to shatter.\u201c\u2026\u2026Your hands must be big.\u201dAiyen gritted her teeth as she saw the arrow fragments falling to the ground behind her.Then, Adonai raised his black bow.The bull\u2019s-eye was clear. Vikir and Aiyen in front of him.Boom!With a sound like a cannonball being fired, a sharp vortex shot out of Adonai\u2019s black bow.It sliced through the air around them like a whirling blade.Destruction and speed, unavoidable and unstoppable! Vikir and Aiyen prepared for battle.Then.Boom!Someone deflected Adonai\u2019s dark power blast with their bare hands.Kwagigik! Boom!The frantically spinning blade aura was shattered by pure force.Adonai\u2019s aura arrows turned into black air currents and scattered.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dVikir and Aiyen looked up, wide-eyed, at the being that stood before them.A warrior, dripping with blood from his torn grip, yet standing without missing a beat.Chieftain Aquila. Fox of the Night.She stood here as the representative of the new generation against the representative of the old.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The black arrows were slowly, steadily squeezing the air out of Aquila\u2019s lungs.But it wasn\u2019t a matter of skill.It\u2019s because Aquila needs the limited tools of arrows, and Adonai doesn\u2019t.Sometimes, like Adonai, Aquila would simply concentrate her aura and send it out without an arrow, but it was so mana-draining that she couldn\u2019t use it except in a moment of great urgency.Adonai, on the other hand, thanks to the negative energy he draws from Hell, can shoot out solid aura arrows of 100% purity.Even.\u201c\u2026\u2026Even the direction of the wind is unfavorable.\u201dVikir frowned.Adonai had his back to the wind, and Aquila was facing it head-on.The winds of the jungle seemed to be favoring Adonai\u2019s arrows, giving them more power, while Aquila\u2019s arrows were halved in power.The difference is becoming increasingly visible in Aquila\u2019s body, which is becoming increasingly covered in scars.Even Adonai\u2019s sniper shots were imbued with the poison of Madame Eight-Legged!Tsutsutsutsuts\u2026\u2026The wounds on Aquila\u2019s body turned black.Her complexion was growing pale in contrast.Ping-ping-ping-pingMoreover, the arrows that Aquila had sent out had suddenly begun to go in a completely strange direction.The wind wrapped around her arrows and sent them flying in different directions, never reaching Adonai.It was as if the entire jungle was protecting Adonai. Was he really a jungle god?Bikir wondered. What could he do to reverse the odds?At this rate, Aquila would lose, and all of Balak\u2019s warriors would be swept away by the Death Knight hordes.\u201d \u2026\u2026 Should we kill Ahheman first?Yes, but to do so would require penetrating Adonai\u2019s iron wall, which stands unmoving in place.What\u2019s more, Ahheman had not withdrawn all of his Deathknights, but was instead focusing his efforts on controlling several Named-class Deathknights, including Adonai.Balak\u2019s warriors are struggling against other Death Knights who are only slightly deterred by the sprinkling of salt, but not at all deterred.\u201cSomeone needs to go get the rest of the warriors in town! At this rate, we\u2019re going to\u2026\u2026!\u201dVikir shouts urgently.Aiyen clamped a hand over his mouth.\u201cShhh. We\u2019re almost there.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dVikir\u2019s eyes narrowed.Aquila was getting tired, her arrows flying in strange directions with the headwind.Adonai, on the other hand, still going strong.Where in the world did she think she was winning?But Aiyen, who is a better archer than Vikir, seems to see something else.Aiyen. She\u2019s watching in awe as Aquila performs a miracle.\u201cI see it. I do. I see what my mother is seeing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dVikir could only shake her head.Then.It happened suddenly.\u2026Boom!A mysterious arrow flew out and lodged in the center of Adonai\u2019s back.A single, authentic arrow twitched.It came from an unexpected direction, from behind, not from below, not from the latitude, not from the side.[\u2026\u2026?]Adonai paused for a moment, surely there could only be one person behind him, Ahhe?But.Pfft!Another arrow flew right back at him, hitting him in the back of the head.And then another.-Beep, beep, beep!A huge number of arrows began to fly in from behind.\u201cUgh!\u201dAhheman flattened himself like a bug on the ground.Several of the arrows flying from behind tore into his backside.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dVikir looked up, his mouth half open.Only now did he see the identity of the arrows coming from behind.They were the blind arrows Aquila had been shooting at him a moment ago!Pipipiping!Another hail of arrows from behind. Still aimed at Adonai\u2019s back!Whizz, whizz, whizz-!The fierce wind was carrying Aquila\u2019s arrows back to Adonai.Only then did Vikir realize the cause of the anomaly.Aquila\u2019s arrows weren\u2019t flying in the wrong direction.They seemed to have taken a wrong turn, only to surge upward in a whirlwind that raged across the jungle, only to spin around in a full circle and return to where they came from.Like salmon running up a waterfall back to the place where they were born.To the center of the black vortex that Adonai is creating, to where the wind begins!\u2026Puck! \u2026Puck! Quack!Adonai\u2019s exposed back was instantly transformed into a hedgehog.After bouncing twice in the wind, the arrow became even more powerful than when it was originally released and struck its target.Aquila\u2019s arrows, which could pierce rocks and logs, didn\u2019t completely penetrate Adonai\u2019s powerful body, but they still managed to make a good dent.Boom!Another arrow landed on top of the one in Adonai\u2019s thigh.Only then did it manage to pierce Adonai\u2019s thigh, causing him to stagger and fall to his knees on the ground.Aquila looked up, his complexion weary.\u201cGreat Ancestor, if you were still alive and in good spirits, you would not have made such a simple mistake. It saddens me.\u201dAquila sent the last arrow flying toward the crippled Adonai.A blind arrow struck him in the back and a sighted arrow in the front.Adonai was unable to dodge Aquila\u2019s final shot.Pfft!An arrow halfway to the back of his head and another halfway to his forehead.\u2026Boom!The two arrowheads meet at a single point.Thud-!Adonai fell to his knees.The legend of a previous generation bowed before the myth of a new era.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAquila looked at Adonai, kneeling before him, head bowed.It didn\u2019t really feel like a victory.Aquila was at the peak of his powers now, and the Adonai he had just faced had already died of old age and was no longer in the process of being resurrected from the dead.Moreover, he was a corpse, lacking even basic intelligence, let alone a living mind, so it was hardly a proper match.\u201cIf only Adonai had had the strength of his prime\u2026\u2026.Aquila shook her head. She could only imagine the horrible consequences.Then.\u201cKaaaaaah!\u201dA muffled scream.Ahheman was struggling with Adonai\u2019s corpse.The battle was lost, as the Death Knight made from Adonai\u2019s corpse had fallen.The few remaining Deathknights gathered around Ahheman, and a far greater number of Balak warriors surrounded him.\u201cNow die.\u201dAiyen glares at Ahheman with disdain.But.Ahheman\u2019s gamble was not yet over.He has lost almost all of his life and mana, and is crippled from the waist down, but he still hasn\u2019t let go of his will to live.\u201cDon\u2019t come!\u201dAhheman gathered Adonai\u2019s body and the bodies of the other ancestors together.He grabbed a handful of blood from his hands and mouth.\u201cIf you come near, your ancestors will be tainted with my blood!\u201dAhheman\u2019s threat made everyone, including Aquila, pause for a moment.Superstition held that a soul tainted with the blood of a traitor would be unable to enter the warrior\u2019s paradise.In his final moments, Ahriman had relied on this small superstition to blackmail the others.At this rate, the souls of the warriors would never be able to go to paradise, not to mention they would have been tricked by him.The fact that he was so skilled in witchcraft made the situation even more dire.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAquila raised his bow, but Ahriman was cunningly hiding behind the bodies of his ancestors.Thus, all the warriors were unable to act rashly.For if they did, they might not be able to honor their ancestors forever.Just then.\u201cStand down, everyone.\u201dVikir\u2019s voice rang out.All eyes turned to see Vikir raising his bow and aiming an arrow.However, the arrow was pointed in the wrong direction.\u201c\u2026\u2026What are you going to do?\u201dEven Aquila, who had just used the wind to make an unbelievable hit, looked confused.But. Vikir was confident.\u201cClimb to a higher place first.\u201dThat was Vikir\u2019s last piece of advice.At the same time.PING-!The arrow from Vikir\u2019s bow flew in a parabolic arc.It struck where the logs were stacked on top of each other, the knot of vines holding them together.\u2026Pow!Vikir\u2019s arrow snaps, and the vine falls to the ground.And then.Grrrrr \u2013 snap \u2013 snap \u2013 snap.As the vines snapped one by one, the heavy logs began to move in unison.When the wooden barrier dam, which was held in place by vines, collapses, the things on the other side spill out.Chhhhhhh.It was a river that swelled during the long rainy season, the waves of a salt river full of melted white salt!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Crash!The rushing water swept the Death Knights away in one fell swoop.Of course, the Death Knights were strong enough to withstand the waves, but the problem\u2026\u2026 wasn\u2019t the waves themselves.Tsutsutsutsutsutsutsuts\u2026\u2026The bodies of the Death Knights gradually turned to black vapor and began to disperse.This was because the river water that was now flooding was a concentrated salt water.By nature, the undead are weak to salt, which has the power to purify the unholy.These salt rivers have long been home to saltwater fish, and even salt that is dissolved in water is effective against the undead.The Death Knights resisted the salt, but they could not withstand such an overwhelming force.Sanctification.One by one, the bodies crumble to dust.The bodies of their ancestors, returning to where they belonged, swept away by the flowing waters and scattered across the flooded land where they had been born and raised.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAquila swallowed hard at the sight of Adonai\u2019s flesh dissolving in the salt water and being swept away.It was unfortunate that the remains of her distant ancestors could not be properly recovered, but she was glad that the unholy energy had been cleansed.Most of all, I am glad that the noble bodies of my ancestors were not spattered with the disgusting blood of Ahheman.\u2026\u2026And now.The water level subsided.It was the end of the rainy season, and the waters were no longer overflowing.Balak\u2019s warriors descended to the bottom as the water receded.The water was still up to their ankles, but it didn\u2019t interfere with their ability to walk on the ground.Vikir followed suit as soon as the water level dropped.Pow! \u2026pow! \u2026pow!With each step, the water rises to his ankles and the wispy grass tickles between his toes.In the stagnant pools at the bottom, catfish and eels trapped by the current flailed and gasped for air.Then.Vikir spotted something.An object, silently submerged in the water, wafting an eerie aura above the surface.\u201cIs that \u2026\u2026?\u201dIt was a large bow.Dark matte. Horns and thorns sprouting like teeth.This black bow, without even a bowstring, must have been held by Adonai just a moment ago.A weapon made from the carapace of a Madame Eight-Legged. At first glance, it was an unusual weapon.Vikir picked it up and handed it to Aiyen beside him.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAiyen took it and cradled it in her arms. Then he ran to hand it to Aquila, who stood in the distance.Meanwhile.Balak\u2019s warriors were converging on a single location.They were heading for a single thorny tree that stood tall in the middle of a wide open plain.It stood alone, with no other large trees around, and its trunk was densely covered with countless thorns.The warriors of Balak stood in a circle around the tree, and in unison they looked up.Above them, they saw a familiar figure.\u201cUgh\u2026\u2026 Ugh\u2026\u2026.\u201dThis tenacious old man was hanging on, unable to be swept away by the rising waters of the river.Just before the water washed over him, he climbed this thorny tree, scraping the ground with his hands and dragging his motionless lower half.What could have led him to this harrowing path of suras?The sides of the thorns were sharp as blades, and their tips were pointed like spears.\u201cTurn it off\u2026 \u2026 Ahhh\u2026 \u2026 \u201dAhheman reached out a trembling hand and grabbed them.He couldn\u2019t even pick out the relatively blunt thorns in the mad rush of water.He just had to grab whatever he could get his hands on.The backs of his hands were punctured, his fingers were zigzagging and tattered, and his knuckles were falling off.Needless to say, it wasn\u2019t just his hands.The whole body was covered in thorns, cuts, and tears.His flesh was torn like rags, and his body was dripping with blood.Salt water and debris filled the gaping wounds, causing hellish pain.His guts were already disintegrating from being used by high-level Death Knights who were out of their capabilities.But despite this, the old shaman was still alive.He continued to reach out and climb the thorns, seemingly frightened, or perhaps even dazed.He looked as if he had aged decades.\u201cSa, save me\u2026\u2026 please save me\u2026\u2026.\u201dAs he desperately moved his hands to climb the branches, bits of flesh and guts were dripping down the tree trunk with blood.The tree turning more and more gray.Vikir stared at it, lost in thought.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAh, well, in retrospect, he was certainly a remarkable man.He had raised the mythical Adonai of Balak from the undead, even though all his life force was gone, and he had managed to wield several other Death Knights simultaneously.\u2018Perhaps if he had only devoted himself to magic, he would have been at the level of Adolph, the Madman of Morg.\u2019However, it was a pity that he had awkwardly imitated a warrior to match Balak\u2019s emotions.Even with a black magic skill of more than six circles, he was still playing the part of a warrior.But it proved how eager he was to blend into the atmosphere of Balak.Vikir turned his gaze back to Ahheman.He climbed the thorns in terror, bleeding.The sight of him suddenly brings back memories of when he first came to Balak\u2019s village two years ago.The prisoners of war climbing the thorns and the flames burning beneath them.Those condemned to the thorn tree were forced to climb it naked, their bodies covered in blood.They fell to their deaths at the base of the tree, bleeding to death or dying of burns.Among the dead were men of the house of Baskerville and men of the house of Morg.It is especially memorable that in their last moments, they kept their mouths shut, even though their eyes met Vikir\u2019s.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir bowed his head in silence for a moment, then raised it again and looked up at the reddened thorns.He had heard that it was Ahheman who had devised this horrible punishment, and now he was meeting his end by a brutal torture of his own making.In other words, the real enemy of Ahheman was Ahheman himself.Then.\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll finish it.\u201dThere was a hand on Vikir\u2019s shoulder.He turned to see Ahun standing there, his head bowed.\u201cPlease, let me.\u201dWas it the fact that he\u2019d rejected Vikir\u2019s words earlier that bothered him? Ahun looked into Vikir\u2019s eyes and asked for a favor.When Vikir nodded, Ahun stepped forward.He struck a flint to create embers, and soon spread the oil and a little gunpowder he carried with him at the base of the thorn tree.Soon, a tiny ember rises and falls on the thorn.Crackle!The flames, flickering due to the moisture, soon spread upwards with astonishing speed.The wet wood burns and emits a great deal of smoke.Soon, scarlet flames shot up like spears, pursuing Ahheman.Crackle, crackle, crackle, crackle, crackle!The sound of burning wood is loud.The flames burned toward the top.The flames and smoke soon engulfed Ahheman, who had languished halfway up the thorns.No screams were heard.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe warriors of Balak watched the old shaman\u2019s final moments with mixed expressions on their faces.Recalling the past seventy years, how they had cried and laughed at his every word, every gesture.Crackle, crackle, crackle, crackle!The smell of burning meat is thick.The sound of sizzling fat was everywhere.Everyone was about to turn away.\u201cHee-hee-hee-hee!\u201dThrough the flames and black smoke, something appeared.The warriors\u2019 eyes widened in surprise. Even Aquila.There was a skeleton, burning brightly, screaming with open arms.\u201cAhhhhhh.No shaman, no warrior, born in the body of a Rococo and living in the mind of a Balak.A being whose flesh and the fat beneath it had already burned away.He shook his flesh, which was already more like charcoal than a body, and screamed at the world.\u201cYou will regret this! You\u2019ll regret putting me out like this\u2026\u2026! \u2026\u2026! \u2026\u2026!\u201dThe words he spat out after that were muffled.Not only had his tongue been cooked, but the smoke he\u2019d inhaled had burned through his lungs.Ahheman floundered for several more seconds after that. Disintegrating into black powder like the Death Knights he had summoned.He lifted his head and tried to see the town beyond the water in the distance.He couldn\u2019t see much of anything through his flame-cooked eyes.\u201c\u2026\u2026Go back.\u201dChief Aquila ordered.The Balak warriors returned to the village, their bodies soaked with saltwater and exhaustion.Vikir and Aiyen did the same, carrying each other slowly back to the village.A friendly village. A tribe that should be at peace now that its arch-enemy, Ahheman, is gone.\u2026\u2026 But.When they returned to the village, the warriors finally understood what Ahheman had warned them about.Why he had laughed so much in his last moments, and why he had turned to look out over the village.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

All that was inside was left outside, useless.Only the food warehouses, where the dry goods were stored, lay shattered and empty.\u201d \u2026\u2026 What is this?\u201dChieftain Aquila looked around in disbelief.There was no way the village could have been destroyed like this without casualties.There were bodies floating around everywhere.Almost all of the warriors had gone to watch the Iliad, so those left in town were mostly children, the elderly, the sick and women who couldn\u2019t fight.There was a minimal guard force left, but they, too, were mostly dead and lying around.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir came to his senses faster than anyone else, and soon began to realize what had happened.The first thing that caught Vikir\u2019s attention was the air.A foul, polluted aura hovered over the entire forest beyond Balak\u2019s village.Vikir followed the ominous scent with his hound\u2019s keen sense of smell.Now there were signs of something more sinister.The muddy water was nearly up to his ankles, making it difficult to see, but when he dipped his hand under the water, he could feel the ugly scars on the ground.Deep scars in the ground. As if a giant log had once drummed and scraped across them.There were not one or two of these deep furrows under the water, but a very complex and irregular pattern.\u2018\u2026\u2026 at least 80 centimeters wide. Maybe 3 meters long.What kind of creature could leave tracks this big in a flood?Vikir could name three or four suspects in his head.And he keeps finding clues that narrow it down even further.Goo\u2026\u2026The mucus that hangs over his head.When Vikir tilted his head, it dripped down past his body and onto the surface.When he looked up, he saw the sticky, slime hanging like a thread from the half-collapsed, tilted floating house.Black fur and blackened flesh clung to it with a disgusting odor.The wood around it was blackened and splintered where it had touched.It seemed to exude a powerful poison.Then.Boom, boom, boom, boom.A louse approached, breaking through the waters up to my ankles.Ahhhh. She appeared, gasping for air.She had managed to hide in a jar of spices during the commotion, and as soon as she saw Vikir, she burst into tears and ran to embrace him.Vikir patted her back wordlessly, and Ahul sobbed into his neck.\u201cMadam was here.\u201dAt those words, all the warriors behind Vikir stood and froze.Madame Eight Legs! Terror of the water. The nightmare of enemies and Black Mountain.Why would she attack a Balak village?To these questions, Ahul stretched out a finger and answered.\u201cAs soon as Madame reached the village, she destroyed it from there, and then, as if she was taking out her anger on us\u2026\u2026\u201dShe pointed to a tall building that was unusually badly broken. It was a house carved out of stone, perched high on a rocky outcropping.Ahheman\u2019s temple.The moment she pointed to it, the warriors realized.\u201cYou will regret this! You will regret leaving me like this\u2026\u2026! \u2026\u2026! \u2026\u2026!\u201dAhheman\u2019s last words before he died, and the reason he chose to stare at the distant village in his final moments.Vikir climbed up onto the rocky outcropping and searched through the rubble of a shattered stone building.It was the temple where Ahheman usually performed his rituals, and unlike the exterior, which was unusually badly damaged, the interior was relatively intact.Vikir pushed aside the rubble and peered inside.There was a strange assortment of herbs he didn\u2019t recognize, burned to a crisp over time.The scorched remains of the herbs emitted a strange odor, and tiny insects the size of pinky fingernails swarmed around them, apparently intoxicated by the scent.Aiyen gritted his teeth.\u201d It must be the grass that attracts bugs.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir nodded.Ahheman had arranged for Madame Eight Legs to come here if he was away for an extended period of time.Normally, the fire is controlled so that the smell of the burning herbs doesn\u2019t spread beyond a certain area, but when there\u2019s no one to tend to it, the fire continues to burn the herbs and the strange odor spreads endlessly.Eventually, the smell is noticed by a madam who lives deep within the jungle.Ahun pounded his fist on the stone wall.\u201cDamn it! You\u2019ve arranged for everyone to die when you\u2019re gone! You\u2019re insane!\u201dIt\u2019s a testament to Ahheman\u2019s need for recognition within the Balak tribe.But his need for recognition was perverse and eventually led to terrible destruction.Ahun gained a deeper understanding of his grandfather, but also a stronger hatred for him.But it was too late.Balak\u2019s village was devastated and almost impossible to rebuild.The good news was that most of the population had gone out to watch the Iliad, and of those who remained in town, most had gone out to gather berries and roots.This was due to Aiyen\u2019s instructions.To prepare a feast for Vikir if he won the Iliad.Aquila clenched her fists so tightly that they bled.\u201cThe good news is that there were no casualties. We\u2019ll just have to rebuild the village and gather food. These are just floating houses that were hastily built for the rainy season anyway.\u201dBalak\u2019s warriors worked diligently to collect the remains of the dead and rescue survivors still in hiding.Madame consoled herself with the fact that the damage had been so light as to be nothing short of a miracle, considering she had visited the village herself.Meanwhile.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAhun had his head down, deep in frustration.Vikir tapped him on the shoulder.Ahun looked back at Vikir and sobbed.\u201cVikir. I should have listened to you.\u201dHe spoke with anger and understanding.\u201cIf only I had listened to you, when you asked me to finish off Ahheman, if only I had really listened to you\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201d \u2026\u2026 It\u2019s not your fault.\u201dVikir turned his head and spoke to all the warriors nearby.\u201cThe real fault lies with the Empire, or more precisely, the Baskervilles.\u201dAt that, all the warriors turned their heads.They all knew that Vikir was originally from the Baskervilles, let alone that the Baskervilles were to blame.But Vikir had no qualms about speaking.\u201cThe Baskervilles are to blame for the reason that Madame has expanded her living quarters here, and for the reason that she raided Balak\u2019s village in a frenzy of hunger.\u201dThe Baskervilles had been so aggressive in slaying demons that Madame\u2019s prey had become scarce, and she had expanded her hunting grounds.The natives of Balak were forced to move to the lowlands of the mountains to escape her hunger.Vikir pinpointed the hatred of the natives of Balak for the Empire.And the warriors of Balak took a strong liking to Vikir\u2019s clear-eyed condemnation of the misdeeds of their former home.But there was one thing Vikir didn\u2019t say.\u201cIt\u2019s also because of a policy I set when I was in Baskerville.\u201dAt the age of 8, Vikir presented a united front with Morgue and a grand subjugation plan against the enemy and the Black Mountain.Of course, this was just Hugo\u2019s pre-regression knowledge of the plan that was already in place, but it still gives Vikir some responsibility.So Vikir took this opportunity to repay the Balak warriors for their many favors.He had fully restored his health, gained strength away from Hugo\u2019s watchful eye, gained access to the skills of various magical creatures, learned the archery of the Bowmaster, learned and experienced firsthand the mysterious culture of unknown barbarians, mastered the art of tracking and stalking, and learned various survival skills in the jungle.What\u2019s more, all the barbarian tribes of the Jungle have come to support Vikir, giving him great political influence.For all this, Vikir looked around for a way to repay them.Aquila, the Night Fox. The chieftain of the Balak, she was battered and bruised from the fierce war against Adonai.Aiyen had stepped forward to help Vikir, but a poisoned arrow in his leg had left him with an unnatural gait.Vikir said.\u201cThe warriors of Balak have never treated Madame poorly.\u201dEveryone turned to look at Vikir\u2019s face.Vikir continued.\u201cWe even honored her just a week ago, and made offerings to her.\u201dIndeed. The Balak have always taken the best parts of their prey and offered them to the Madame\u2019s domain.The same was true for prisoners of war.\u201cBut she raided our lands and killed innocent children, old men, and wolves.\u201dBalak\u2019s warriors listened with bated breath.Finally, Vikir finished, his eyes glowing with dark blood.\u201cI must now confront her and judge her.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No brave warrior has ever been able to do that.\u201d\u201c\u2018Vikir. Even if you are the hero of the whole region, that\u2019s a myth.\u201d\u201cMadame Eight-Legged is the deity of these jungle. She is the evil one of the evil spirits.\u201d\u201cThe damage will eventually be repaired. The only way is to forget.\u201dFor the first time, Balak\u2019s warriors, who trusted Vikir with anything he said, shook their heads at his words.For such brave men to say such a thing gives one an idea of the extent of their fear of the Madame.Then.\u2026tee!Someone put a hand on Vikir\u2019s shoulder.It was Chief Aquila, the Fox of the Night, staring at Vikir with a pale complexion.She had lost much of her usual overwhelming majesty.The one who had gone one-on-one with the Ancient One, the legendary Adonai, and sent him back to the dust.But Aquila, too, had suffered many wounds in the process.Countless arrow marks scratched his body, and even the poisonous venom of Madame Eight-Legged was too much for even a Master-level warrior to heal.\u201cVikir. Young hero of all the jungle and the sun just rising, do not be swayed by the heat of the moment. Where Madame is involved, extreme caution must be applied.\u201dAiyen, beside him, agreed.\u201cThe Eight Legged Madame is a terror to all tribes, not just the Balak. She is a force of unstoppable causality and the essence of darkness. Her presence is like a natural disaster, and even if we harbor feelings of vengeance\u2026\u2026.\u201dBut Aiyen didn\u2019t finish her sentence.[chuckles\u2026\u2026]She saw a figure crawling through the rubble of the collapsed building.Bakira. The wolf who had been born on the same day and time as Aiyen, and had been with him all his life.The one who had run to the village to tell them of Bikir\u2019s victory before the Iliad between Bikir and Ahriman.For a moment, Aiyen couldn\u2019t help but think of his last words to Bakira.\u201cGo to the village and tell them to prepare to welcome the winner of the Iliad.\u201dLittle did he know the consequences of that simple errand would be so terrible.[snicker\u2026\u2026 snicker\u2026\u2026]Bakira crawled over, dragging his hind legs, and wiped his wet nose at Aiyen\u2019s feet.One of her right hind legs was in terrible shape.Not only were all the bones broken, but a dark poison had seeped into the marrow.The reason for this was obvious. What else could it be but the result of resisting Madame Eight-Legged?The poison was still surging at this moment, and the situation was so serious that the leg had to be cut off.Aiyen looked at Bakira in disbelief.Bikir spoke briefly.\u201cWill you still say that revenge is futile?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAiyen did not answer this time.Aquila glanced between her daughter\u2019s face and Bakira\u2019s moaning legs and sighed deeply.\u201cWe\u2019ll talk later. For now, let\u2019s take care of Bakira. Come on, take care of the others.\u201dDespite her own mortal wounds, Aquila tends to the others first.The chieftain\u2019s words sent everyone scrambling again.They had to rescue survivors, tend to the sick, and make sure they had food and shelter for the night.* * * https://pindangscans.comThe night was unusually dark and rainy.There was no moon, so the pitch-black depths were illuminated only by the occasional lightning strike.A shadow passed like a ghost through the rain that fell like spears.It was Vikir.Once again, Vikir had left Balak without telling anyone.The hound was now on his way to see Madame.\u2018\u2026\u2026She\u2019s someone I should have faced at least once.\u2019Madame Eight-Legged was one of Vikir\u2019s true purposes for coming to Depht in the first place.An ultra-dangerous beast whose danger is still unknown to the Empire.If we can hunt it down before it does, the benefits are endless.Humming.Vikir thought to himself as he listened to the pulsing of Beelzebub in the arteries of his wrist.\u2018In the future, when the Age of Destruction arrives, creatures like Madame will be relatively common, but for now\u2026\u2026 she is quite unique.\u2019Besides, the Madame was the one who had forced Balak\u2019s warriors to abandon their homes and move from place to place.Balak\u2019s warriors were in a difficult position, having to avoid the Madame\u2019s constantly expanding radius to satisfy her hunger, and having to avoid the Baskervilles, who were cutting through the jungle to expand their empire\u2019s territory.\u201cI can set them free.\u201dMadame Eightlegs and the Baskervilles. Vikir had the means to bring these two oppressors of Balak under his control.It would be a favor to Balak for all he had done for her, and a favor for their future.Vikir also wanted to test himself.How much stronger he had become during his two years in the Depht.\u2018This battle with Adonai has made me stronger. Soon I will be able to climb another step\u2026\u2026.\u2019As he thought this, Vikir made his way through the rain.But the hound was soon forced to stop.A familiar scent wafted through the curtain of rain.Not a day has gone by that he hasn\u2019t recognized it for the past two years.Aiyen. She stood before Vikir, drenched from head to toe.\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHow long have you been standing there?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAiyen didn\u2019t answer Vikir\u2019s questions.Finally, she opens her mouth.\u201cWolves can\u2019t be tamed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cNo matter how much you tie them up, they break the leash and run.\u201dAiyen lifted her head and looked straight into Vikir\u2019s eyes.\u201cWolves can\u2019t be tamed, after all. You can only make them come to you when they want to, without a leash.\u201dShe smirked at Vikir.\u201cYou are not a hound. Vikir. You call yourself that, but\u2026\u2026 no hound ever behaves like you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir looked down at Aiyen\u2019s legs.Her right leg was wrapped in a tight bundle of leaves and leather.Once, when they had fought the Adonai, Aiyen had wounded her leg while saving Vikir from a poisoned arrow.He still limped from the aftermath.Vikir broke the silence.\u201d \u2026\u2026You can\u2019t help me with your body. Go back to the village.\u201dThe air is so thick with water that the words come out dry.But Aiyen kept her mouth shut, as if she\u2019d expected that much.Then she held out something to Vikir.It was dried jerky and fruit and nuts wrapped in leaves.Vikir smirked.\u201cIt looks like a sacrificial meal.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t joke about that.\u201dAiyen opened his eyes fiercely and glared at Vikir.Then he added a word.\u201cI promise.\u201dThe scene was eerie.The Hound thought it was a little familiar.Aiyen spoke again.\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll be back.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhen Vikir didn\u2019t answer, Aiyen spoke again, in a tone that sounded like he was holding his breath underwater.\u201cNo.\u201dShe hesitated for a moment, then spoke again.\u201cI don\u2019t. You don\u2019t have to promise to come back.\u201dA voice that crawls. A voice that hangs with anxiety, nervousness, and bitterness.Aiyen looks into Vikir\u2019s eyes with a voice that sounds like she\u2019s about to vomit blood.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to come back, just stay alive\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir is silent for a moment.Then, a little too late, he speaks.\u201c\u2026\u2026of course.\u201dThen the breath he\u2019d been holding came out of Aiyen\u2019s mouth, all white.A darkness that swallowed him whole.The master stood still, watching the hound, or rather the wolf, walk away.The wolf runs through the dawn again.Unlike last time, there was one thing she couldn\u2019t say to Bikir.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to come back, just stay alive\u2026\u2026.Women have a way of making difficult demands.For the first time in all his life, since he was born twice, he had lied.He didn\u2019t know if he could keep this promise or not.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s common sense to abandon a hunt when it rains.But even in the midst of this heavy rain, the tracks of Madame\u2019s movements remain unmistakable.Half-melted chunks of meat lay everywhere.They appeared to be part of what Madame had eaten and vomited up, but I didn\u2019t bother to examine them to see what kind of meat they were.Everywhere, Madame\u2019s mucus and feces blow into the water, creating a foul odor.Thick hairs that felt like black needles were scattered throughout the area, and the grass and trees around it were blackened and dried up.There\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t follow the trail.The hound advances, following the path of death indicated by the dead trees.Vikir recalled the Madame\u2019s identity once more.When they first met, she had buried herself completely in the blackness of the water.So it\u2019s impossible to know the exact shape of her body.Even the warriors of Balak, who had suffered under her tyranny for so long, had no idea what she looked like or even what kind of creature she was.Only their chieftain, Aquila, was able to give them a glimpse of her identity, based on faint oral accounts.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Certainly, it\u2019s hard to tell what species we\u2019re dealing with based on the tracks.Traces of crashing into and crushing logs or rocks like land war monsters, flying across rivers or high valleys like birds of prey, traces of digging tunnels like underground monsters\u2026 \u2026 The biological characteristics of all monsters are all mixed.What\u2019s even more impressive is that it climbed up a rock wall with a slope of more than 90 degrees.A cliff so high that even birds can\u2019t climb it. Madame scrambled up it.Vikir looked up toward the top of the cliff, hidden by clouds.It looks like he\u2019ll have to climb this high to meet Madame.\u201c\u2026\u2026 But first, I need to get ready.\u201dVikir stared up at the cliff for a moment, then turned on his heel.A quick glance around the cliffs reveals that they\u2019re shaped like isolated mountains.It stuck out like a sore thumb in the flatlands.Most likely, the Madame was nesting in the higher ground.Vikir made a quick assessment of her location and turned away.If he fought now, he would lose, and he would barely survive, let alone win.Now that he knew where his opponent was, time was on his side.Vikir slowly moved away from the cliffside.Trying to gauge how high this sheer cliff could possibly be.* * * https://pindangscans,comVikir arrived at a swampy area quite a distance from Madame\u2019s nest.The first thing Vikir did upon reaching the edge of the swamp was to scatter the bundle of straw he had been carrying in all directions.He had been sweating profusely as he made his way through the jungle, and his scent had soaked into the straw.The wind blew the straw, carrying his scent, everywhere.Now, due to the nature of convection that circles the swamp, Vikir\u2019s scented straws will scatter, enveloping the entire swamp.They will be carried by the wind deeper into the swamp.Not only would it be impossible to pinpoint Vikir\u2019s location, but there would be room for her to feel surrounded.\u2026\u2026Who would feel that way?\u201cThe master of this swamp.\u201dVikir raised his head and stared into the center of the swamp.Suddenly, a log floating on the surface sank deep.And something huge began to crawl out of the swamp through the thick water.<Bog Salamander>Danger Rating: A+Size: 9 metersFound in: Ridge 8, Red and Black Mountains-Named \u2018Infinite Regeneration Dragon\u2019.A giant amphibian-like beast that lives deep in the swamps.It has strong territorial instincts and a gluttonous appetite, devouring everything that enters its swamp.They are feared by humans because of their unkillable ability to regenerate from any wounds.It has ruled this swamp for a very long time.An old, giant salamander emerged.Its entire body is covered in smooth skin and sticky slime.In its mouth were the arms and legs of several natives of unknown tribe.Vikir recognized him at a glance.\u201cThat was Mushuhushu\u2019s rival, I suppose?There was a great snake named Mushuhushu who had recently fallen prey to Beelzebub.That snake\u2019s rival was this giant right in front of him.The old salamander stretched out his body, growing larger and more powerful as he aged.[hiss-]The old salamander\u2019s head swiveled to look for the intruder in its territory, but it couldn\u2019t pinpoint a direction.That was because Vikir had sent the straw he had been gathering into the wind, and at the same time smeared mud all over himself to cover his scent.[grrrr\u2026\u2026 shhhhhhhhhhhhh!]The bog salamander clucked its tongue and continued to crawl across the swamp.Vikir briefly considered fighting it, but quickly dismissed the idea.His capture of Mushuhushu the other day was luck in many ways.He had lost his territory to the floods and had been swept away, so he had lost a lot of stamina, and to replenish it, he had eaten at an uncharacteristic pace, leaving him sluggish.The hunt had been a relatively easy one, as we\u2019d ambushed him while he was tired, full, and sleepy, and Aiyen had helped.But not now.The old salamander was moderately hungry and very uncomfortable.Besides, isn\u2019t it a monster so strong that it\u2019s on par with Mushuhushu?If I were to fight him, I couldn\u2019t guarantee 100% success.Even if I could win moderately, there was no point in wasting my stamina in a place like this, considering the fight with Madame that would follow.\u2018Except\u2026\u2026 there\u2019s something I can do with him.\u2019Vikir waited until the salamander was completely out of the swamp.And there was something else he was aiming for.The straw he\u2019d sent into the wind earlier wasn\u2019t just to hide his location.It was also to lure in \u201csome dangerous creature\u201d that might be lurking just beyond the wind\u2019s reach.\u201c\u2026\u2026It\u2019s almost time to come out.Vikir thought as he carefully followed the salamander out of the swamp and into the woods.Then.The response came.As Vikir\u2019s scent drifted across the jungle on the wind, the creatures began to respond.Minotaurs, ogres, trolls, and other large creatures responded.But none of them dared to enter the old salamander\u2019s territory. They could only salivate at the outer borders of the realm.\u2026\u2026But.Wee wee wee!Just one.There was one creature that had no fear of the old marsh salamander and barged into his territory.weeeeeeng!An ominous sound of flapping wings.It was an extremely eerie sound that made even the most powerful salamanders cringe.Then, as the old salamander left the swamp and entered the forest in search of Vikir, something huge appeared in front of him.It was like a dark cloud, very tall, very wide, and very vast.It moved about, elongated like a snake, and soared upward.Vikir was familiar with this strange, shapeless creature.<Bone-Sucking Mosquito>Danger Rating (Individual) : DDanger Rating (Swarm) : SSize: 3 mmFound in: Red and Black Mountains, Ridge 9-Nicknamed the \u2018bone-sucking mosquito\u2019.Not much is known about it except that it sucks bone, not blood.It was not a single giant, but a swarm of many smaller ones.Wee wee wee wee wee!Mosquitoes flew in swarms, clinging to everything around them.Even the salamander, which had traveled quite a distance from the swamp.Vikir looked at the mosquitoes and thought.\u201cThey are terrible things.\u201dThese mosquitoes were worse than the ones people usually recognize.Normal mosquitoes stick their long, straw-like proboscis into flesh and drink blood.But it wasn\u2019t human blood that these mosquitoes craved.It was bones.They poke their long, pointed snouts into the bodies of their prey and suck out the bones, much longer than the average mosquito, and their victims lose all the bones in their bodies.What\u2019s even more horrifying is that\u2026\u2026 these mosquitoes only suck on bones, leaving behind skin, flesh, blood, and intestines.The old salamander then proceeds to show us in real time what happens to those who get caught by these dreaded mosquitoes.[Shhhhhh!?]The old salamander freaked out.He squirted mucus all over his body to ward off the mosquitoes\u2019 attacks, and he tried to turn and run back into the swamp.But the mosquitoes were much quicker to react.Attracted by Vikir\u2019s scent, these mosquitoes cling to the salamander\u2019s body, causing it to die and harden its mucus, while the late arrivals use the corpses of their companions as footholds to sting.Soon, the mosquitoes begin to suck out the salamander\u2019s bones.Swish, swish, swish.The fluid from the mosquito\u2019s saliva is exactly what dissolves the salamander\u2019s bones and turns them back into liquid.The salamander tries as hard as it can to get back into the swamp, but the fire spreads it a few meters from the water\u2019s edge.It had lost all its bones to support its weight.The mosquitoes continued to swarm the swamp long after they\u2019d eaten all the salamander\u2019s bones.Whirr! Whirr! Whirr!That is, until Bikir started a fire and used the smoke to scare away all the mosquitoes.The mosquitoes disappeared as quickly as they had appeared.Vikir finally emerged from the swamp.He burned some wet leaves, just in case, creating a thick cloud of smoke.\u201c\u2026\u2026Smoke.\u201dVikir looked around and nodded.The bone-sucking mosquitoes were terrifying.Each mosquito was small and weak, but the danger level of the whole swarm was far beyond common sense.Vikir turned his head to look at the swamp.The salamander had fallen to the ground just two meters from the swamp.Surprisingly, it was still alive.The bones in his body were gone, and he was shivering, but he was still breathing, thanks to his tough skin and life force.Of course, it was obvious that its miserable existence would be short-lived, as it was nothing more than a watery shell.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVikir reached out and touched the salamander\u2019s body once.Flesh and blood oozing from the tough hide, intestines floating around.Now he was nothing more than a bag of blood.\u201cGood. Well made. That should be enough.\u201dVikir tugged on the still-breathing salamander\u2019s tail.As the mana of a Advance Graduator passed through his body, he was able to pull the body of this huge monster.What\u2019s more, the old salamander\u2019s body was lighter because its bones were gone.[Swoosh! Swoosh-]The salamander made a bizarre noise every time it was dragged, but it could do nothing about it.The lungs and other organs in its body were now all mixed up, so it couldn\u2019t even make a sound.Only thick tears dripped from his eyes.\u201cConsider this your karma for eating so many humans.\u201dVikir\u2019s eyes are cold as he drags the salamander, a giant bag of blood and intestines.It had been a short preparation, a rather long one.Now that everything was in place, there was only one thing left to do.To meet the Madame, and to kill her.Then I will leave the jungle, and Balak, with all the debts of my heart.A return to Baskerville, Ironblade.It will not be a long one.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

98 \u2013 Madame Eight Legs (4)It was late at night.Rumbling\u2026\u2026 boom!The rain had stopped, but there was more thunder.Vikir lifted his head and looked up at the giant rock formation rising before him.Composed of quartz and sandstone, the massive cliff stood alone as a soaring peak in contrast to the flat terrain around it.Many caves have been carved into the steep cliffs, and their pupils stare blankly into the darkness, like the eyes of a blind Guani.Occasionally, in the darkness of a cave, quartz or amethyst gemstones would glint in the reflection of a lightning bolt, and the cliffs would seem to stand guard in every direction, like a thousand-eyed watchman.Vikir gritted his teeth.From Baskerville Street to the watery depths of Balak.Vikir\u2019s body had been trained to the limit by now, and every twitching muscle in his body was taut.Vikir began to climb the steep cliff barehanded.The muscles in his back and arms pulled and released, pulled and released, pulled and released\u2026\u2026.Vikir scrambled up the rock wall, one foot at a time.\u2026Walgrok!Sometimes the stalactites he was holding on to would snap, or the stone beak he was stepping on would snap off the wall.Without a single scream, Vikir calmly braced herself with the strength of his other arm or foot, making room for a quick grab or step.When he felt he had nothing to grab or step on, he drew his magic sword, Beelzebub, and slammed it into the wall, climbing upward.Thanks to Mushu Hushu\u2019s abilities, no sound was made during the entire process.\u2026\u2026I wonder how long he climbed like that.When I thought I was halfway up the cliff, I saw a cave.It was narrow enough for one person to fit in, but it was quite winding inside, so it felt cozy.It looked like a place to take a break from the climb if anyone happened to come across it.But Vikir did not enter the cave.\u201c\u2026\u2026A trap.\u201dThis is where the Madame\u2019s nest is located.I didn\u2019t think there would be a comfortable place beneath the worst of monsters.There was a slight chance that this was a natural trap to test the will of the challenger.A weaker man, exhausted from the journey up here, would have been easily tempted, but the seasoned Vikir still had some stamina left.Vikir didn\u2019t rush into the cave, but kept a close eye on it.\u2026\u2026or otherwise.A corpse, a skeleton, rolled around in the cave.Had there been a warrior who had come this far before?It seemed that he had entered this cave, never made it out, and died, leaving only his remains behind.Vikir glanced up without entering the cave.Now he understood why there were so many skeletons in the cave.Sticky\u2026\u2026In time, a thin liquid began to trickle down the cliff.It was a mixture of fluids and excrement that Madame often threw out, and it was usually hard or thick, but when it rained, it thickened and loosened.The mucus that has accumulated in the stomach is loosened by the rain.They flowed down, covering the whole area, threatening to block the entrance to the cave.From the outside, it looked like whipped cream dripping down a giant cake, but the disgust and stench was indescribable.\u201c\u2026\u2026 If we walked into that cave, we\u2019d be in trouble.\u201dFortunately, Vikir hadn\u2019t gone into the cave, nor had he fallen asleep in it, so he quickly kicked open the entrance and moved to the side.Luckily, there was a stone beak jutting out like a roof right next to him, and he ducked under it to avoid a shower of slime.The slime, a mixture of the Madame\u2019s bodily fluids and feces, causes skin to swell and bump upon contact.Vikir\u2019s skin was imbued with the protection of the Styx River, so he should be able to withstand it, but even so, he didn\u2019t want to come in contact with that slime.\u2026Gulp!Soon, the slime had completely covered the mouth of the cliffside cave, and it flowed down the gentle slope of the cavern, filling it with a murky, foul odor.Dahlgrak.The skeleton lying within touched the slime and began to float.The warrior, who must have come to see the Madame long ago, had probably fallen asleep in the cave when he entered for a short rest and drowned, never to return.It wasn\u2019t the only cave that held a skeleton.Temptations to rest were everywhere, and it took superhuman endurance to climb the grueling and difficult outcroppings to avoid them.Nails peel, fingerprints fade.Every time Vikir felt the urge to take a break, even for a moment, he gritted his teeth harder.As the hound of the Baskervilles, evil was all that remained of his time in the Age of Destruction.Vikir climbed the cliffs, dodging dripping slime along the way, and passed dozens more caves containing skeletons.\u2026\u2026How much time had passed?Vikir could see the top of the peak through the thick mist of water and inky clouds.He had made it this far without falling off and dying, without being covered in slime, and he had accomplished his goal.Every muscle and bone in his body screamed, but it was still a remarkable accomplishment.Now, Vikir looked around the peak.The black, mushy soil was covered with flimsy, sticky threads that whipped in the wind.A foul odor emanated from the entire peak. A stench so foul that not even rain and storms could wash it away.\u201d \u2026\u2026 It\u2019s as if a large amount of meat has been gathered together and is rotting.\u201dVikir took a step toward the center of the peak, and then.Bam! Swoosh.The ground at the top of the peak sank in, sucking Vikir\u2019s foot up to his shin.It was like stepping on the surface of a swamp.Upon closer inspection, the ground was covered in rotting flesh. That\u2019s why it felt so unpleasantly squishy and hot.An unpleasant sensation wrapped around my entire leg.If I hadn\u2019t wrapped my legs in leather, I would have been itching.\u201cIf I stay still, I\u2019ll be up to my waist.\u201dVikir scrambled to his feet.I didn\u2019t know the floor, so I had to choose only the hard footrests that protruded upward because of the floor that was slowly sinking.Vikir quickly realized the identity of the flimsy footholds sticking out of the slime and rotting dirt.They were bones.A floor made of countless bones.They tangled with sticky, congealed slime to form a massive mass.The stench emanated from the less decayed chunks of meat that lay beneath them.These carcasses, apparently leftovers from Madame\u2019s meals, are covered in slime, decaying and fermenting, emitting a foul poison, odor, and heat.Vikir had to work hard to keep himself from drowning in this swamp of slime and rotting meat.Then.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dVikir stopped in his tracks for a moment.An ominous aura emanated from the cave ahead.But that wasn\u2019t what stopped Vikir in his tracks.The skeletons. Bodies that hadn\u2019t yet decayed, scattered in various fragments.Brown skin, silver hair, faces contorted in pain and fear.They were clearly Balak\u2019s men and wolves.Abui was a good hunter. Adul, the strong swimmer. Akelon, who was an expert at sewing. Asagl, who was a very fast runner. Asak, who laughed and cried a lot. Aguil, who was always arguing with Ahun when they first moved to the village. Agun, who was unusually gluttonous. Atlatl, who was really good at javelin\u2026\u2026.The friends he\u2019d lived with for the past two years, all of whom he recognized, of course.\u201d \u2026\u2026If you\u2019re going to throw up like this, you might as well eat it.\u201dVikir pressed his lips together and gathered the remains of his friends.Then he observed a moment of silence.A warrior\u2019s ritual before a final battle. It was a series of steps that transformed the emotions of the past two years into resolve.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAnd then Vikir\u2019s head snapped up, his eyes glowing red.At the end of the long line of flesh and bones, a great darkness lurked.A gaping hole in the center of the peak. An underground tunnel of bone and flesh.It was obvious from its size and poisonousness that it was Madame\u2019s nest.A poisonous exhalation, unmistakable as the Madame\u2019s vomit from the bottom of the deep chamber, billows out of the cavern.Vikir listened to the breath and stench coming from under the ground.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dNo matter how many times he checked, the result was the same.The grotesquely protruding belly fat, the sound of that chubby lump of flesh flinching was clear.Madame has been in her tunnels for some time, breathing evenly, as if she has no intention of crawling out.No wonder she\u2019d raided a Balak village and eaten to her fill.Karak-Vikir silently picked up the bow on his back.Then, carrying the Baskerville family\u2019s unique dark red aura, he fired an arrow.declaration of war.A red trail flew through the curtain of slime and rotten fibers.It carried the challenger\u2019s intentions to the depths within.And then.\u2026\u2026 \u2026\u2026 \u2026\u2026 \u2026\u2026 \u2026\u2026.The breath and venom that had been spewing from the burrow stopped.Then.[Zzzzzzzzzz!]A fierce rage erupts.Madame\u2019s malice spewed forth like an avalanche from an active volcano.Soon, a sinister presence emerges from the rotting meat lair.A haunting depht nightmare.Horrors of unstoppable causality.A resident of the dark side.It was the moment when \u2018Madam Eight Legs\u2019 revealed its hideous appearance under the torrential rain and lightning.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNovel InfoNovel Info",
