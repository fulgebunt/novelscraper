The child\u2019s feet were stretched apart, toes touching the ground with the heels lifted, hands raised high above the head, his head tilted up, and faint spiritual energy constantly circled within his small body .Moonlight shone down, enveloping the child\u2019s body .The boy continued his practice in this bizarre position, inhaling spiritual energy into his body, letting it flow along his meridians .Night slowly passed .As the moonlight faded, replaced by the first rays of sunshine, the child slowly lowered his palms . His eyes opened to reveal deep, dark pupils that seemed to have a sharp golden glint deep within them .Huang Xiaolong breathed out a mouthful of foul air, his eyes staring at the rising sun . From the day he was born to the present day, it had been seven years since he came to this world . He started practicing the Body Metamorphose Scripture at the age of three . Now four years later, he had managed to reach the Third Stage: Palm Propping the Sky Gate .In his previous life, his ancestors had trained under the banner of the Shaolin Temple and the Body Metamorphose Scripture was an inheritance from his ancestors . Until now, Huang Xiaolong had been unable to understand the reason why someone like him, who was hailed as a martial arts prodigy in his time, was brought to this world .And the matter that depressed Huang Xiaolong the most was that he awoke in the body of a newborn baby .Huang Xiaolong looked at his small thin arms and smiled sourly . He had reached the age of seventeen in his previous life, and after fourteen years of hard work, he had managed to train in the Body Metamorphose Scripture up to the Ninth stage, but never could he have imagined that he would have to start all over again .At this moment, Huang Xiaolong heard the soft rustle of footsteps coming from the direction of the hillside . Huang Xiaolong knew who it was without having to look over his shoulder and sure enough, soon a tender, childlike voice cried out: \u201cBig Brother, I know that you are here to see the sunrise . Dad and Mom are looking for you . \u201dHuang Xiaolong looked over his shoulder and saw a lovely little five-year-old girl with big round eyes and hair braided into two long braids, trekking up the small hill . This little girl was Huang Xiaolong\u2019s sister, Huang Min .Other than Huang Min, Huang Xiaolong had another brother, three years younger than him named Huang Xiaohai .\u201cMom and Dad are looking for me?\u201d Huang Xiaolong asked . \u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know . \u201d Huang Min\u2019s voice was laced with innocence, \u201cBrother, let\u2019s go back . If we are late, then Mom and Dad will spank your backside!\u201dWhen Huang Xiaolong heard this, he smiled and squeezed Huang Min\u2019s cute little cheeks before saying, \u201cLet\u2019s go then,\u201dHuang Min rubbed the spot where Huang Xiaolong had pinched her little face, pouted then said sulkily: \u201cBrother, you are truly hateful . I have told you, don\u2019t pinch my cheeks!\u201dHowever, just as Huang Min finished speaking, her cheeks were once again pinched by Huang Xiaolong, who laughed heartily as he made his escape . Huang Min chased after him screaming, trying to catch up .\u201cBrother, don\u2019t run!\u201dThe siblings frolicked all the way down the hill until they had made their way back to the Huang Clan Manor situated at the foothills .Although he was already seventeen in his previous life, being with his sister Huang Min brought out the child in him .Soon, the siblings got to the Huang Clan Manor .Back in the manor, Huang Xiaolong headed straight to the Eastern Courtyard\u2019s main hall . When he arrived at the main hall, there was a scholarly looking middle-aged man in his mid-thirties dressed in a white robe, sitting on the head seat . Next to him was a pretty woman . This married couple was Huang Xiaolong\u2019s parents in this life: his father Huang Peng, and his mother, Su Yan .\u201cDad, Mom, you were looking for me?\u201d Huang Xiaolong asked as he walked into the hall .Huang Peng raised his sharp, sword-like brows: \u201cWhere did you run off to so early in the morning?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine . Don\u2019t frighten the child . \u201d Su Yan interjected with a smile: \u201cLong\u2019er, in a few days you will be seven years old . It\u2019s about time to awaken the Martial spirit in your body . Your father and I are planning to bring you over to the Martial Hall for the awakening ceremony . \u201dMartial spirit awakening? Huang Xiaolong blanked for a moment .In this world, humans have an existence termed as martial spirits in their body . Human warriors\u2019 strength was closely related to the talents of these martial spirits, and they were graded into low, average, and high; martial spirits graded ten and above were considered as superb talent martial spirits, a heaven-defying existence . The higher one\u2019s talent, the better it was for their body to absorb the world\u2019s spiritual energy and become a strong Warrior .Nevertheless, there were also people born without martial spirits and also those that had crippled martial spirits, rendering them unable to train . In Martial Spirit World, these people were labeled as wastes!Martial spirits . . . A light flashed across Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes for he too wanted to know if he possessed any martial spirit in his body, and if he does, what martial spirit would it be?Thus, Huang Xiaolong was led by Su Yan and Huang Peng to the Martial Hall of the Huang Clan Manor . When they arrived at the outer area of the sacred hall, it was already packed with people waiting with their children wanting to awaken their martial spirits . Other than Huang Xiaolong, there were also other brothers of the Huang Clan Manor who were present .. . .An imposing middle-aged man stood in the center of the Martial Hall; he had a square face and thick, dense eyebrows, and emanated an oppressive aura . This man was Huang Peng\u2019s older brother, Huang Ming . He was also Huang Xiaolong\u2019s Eldest Uncle . Next to Huang Ming stood a boy the same age as Huang Xiaolong; Eldest Uncle Huang Ming\u2019s second son, Huang Wei, who was also here for the martial spirit awakening ceremony .Huang Peng and Su Yan led Huang Xiaolong to the center of the hall . Greeting Huang Ming, Huang Peng called out: \u201cBig Brother . \u201dHuang Xiaolong followed in their greeting and called out: \u201cEldest Uncle . \u201dWhen Huang Ming saw it was Huang Peng and Su Yan, his expressionless deadpan face loosened slightly, he nodded lightly and said: \u201cYou\u2019re here . \u201cAccording to Huang Xiaolong\u2019s memory, he had never seen this uncle of his laugh . Huang Ming was in charge of the Huang Clan Manor\u2019s Punishment and Disciplinary hall; therefore, he was a very strict person .Huang Ming did not utter another word after that, and Huang Peng knowing his brother\u2019s temperament, took no offense .Not long after Huang Xiaolong arrived, a hearty laughter resounded from outside the hall . As Huang Xiaolong and the others turned to look, a healthy looking old man surrounded by a group of people entered the hall . This old man was none other Huang Xiaolong\u2019s grandfather, Huang Qide, the Huang Clan Manor\u2019s lord for the past forty years, the very person who established the Huang Clan .\u201cOld Manor Lord!\u201dUpon Huang Qide\u2019s arrival, residents of Huang Clan Manor present in the hall quickly rushed over to pay their respects .Huang Ming, Huang Peng and Su Yan also moved forward quickly: \u201cDad!\u201dHuang Xiaolong and Huang Wei both came forward: \u201cGrandpa . \u201dHuang Qide smiled, then nodded his head at Huang Ming\u2019s group before turning to face the rest of Huang Clan Manor\u2019s people\u2013 he smiled and said: \u201cDo not stand on ceremony . Today, I came over just to have a look . \u201d Usually, the Old Manor Lord would not make an appearance during the martial spirits awakening ceremony at the Martial Hall, however, this year was special because of Huang Wei and Huang Xiaolong . This Old Manor Lord exited his closed-door retreat earlier than planned .Huang Qide walked to the front of the main hall, his eyes swept over the crowd in the hall before finally stopping on an old man in a gray robe standing next to him . Laughing amiably, Huang Qide said: \u201cSince everyone is already here, let\u2019s begin . \u201d\u201cYes, Manor Lord . \u201d The old man in gray-robe answered respectfully, and then he walked to the center of the hall .The old man in the gray robe was Huang Clan Manor\u2019s Chief Steward Chen Ying; Huang Xiaolong heard his father say Chen Ying had been a follower of Grandfather Huang Qide for a long time\u2013 even before Huang Qide established the Huang Clan Manor, he was already by grandfather\u2019s side .Chen Ying stood at the center of the hall, a light glowed in his hands, spreading an overwhelming force around the hall .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes lit up; is this power of a Ninth Order Warrior\u2019s battle qi? \u00a0So strong! Even with the strength of his previous life, having trained in the Body Metamorphose Scripture till the ninth stage, he still would not be Chen Ying\u2019s opponent .With Chen Ying\u2019s channeling his battle qi, suddenly, in the center of the hall, a bright hexagonal pattern shone, forming a beam of light .\u201cHuang Wei, you first . \u201d Huang Qide looked to Huang Wei .\u201cYes, Grandfather . \u201d Huang Wei answered and stepped forward into the hexagonal patterned light beam . As the beam of light fell on Huang Wei, everyone in the hall focused on Huang Wei who was now standing within the beam of light . Huang Ming\u2019s usually expressionless face showed a faint trace of tension as he watched his son .The beam of light wrapped around Huang Wei for a brief moment before a black light took over, enveloping Huang Wei . Finally, the black shadow of a tiger gradually emerged from behind Huang Wei . It was a black tiger with three eyes . \u00a0As the shape of the black tiger condensed and became more corporeal, a ferocious tiger\u2019s roar echoed in the main hall .Everyone was stunned .Huang Qide stared at the faint black shadow behind his grandson Huang Wei; his eyes shone brightly as he let out a big laugh, tremendously pleased .\u201cThis is a grade ten martial spirit, the Three-Eyed Black Tiger!\u201d Chief Steward Chen Ying cried out in a trembling voice .A Three-Eyed Black Tiger martial spirit was considered one of the top among the high-grade martial spirits; it was infinitely the closest to being a superb talent martial spirit .Huang Wei\u2019s martial spirit turned out to be a grade ten martial spirit, the Three-Eyed Black Tiger!Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Not only in Canglan County, but the entire kingdom .Huang Ming looked at the Three-Eyed Black Tiger hovering behind his son . Both of his fists were clenched tightly, barely able to contain the excitement he felt at that moment . Even so, his body trembled slightly .Huang Qide\u2019s laughter continued to reverberate in the hall for some time . He did not expect his impromptu visit to the Martial Hall would give him such a wonderful surprise!\u201cGood, good, good!\u201d Huang Qide repeated the word \u2018good\u2019 three times with a wide smile . Inhaling deeply, he gathered himself as he tried to suppress the excitement in his heart .His eyes were full of joy as he looked lovingly at this grandson who possessed a grade ten martial spirit . He believed with the support and cultivation resources provided by the Huang Clan Manor, Huang Wei\u2019s achievements would surely surpass him, allowing his grandson to reach a realm that he spent his entire life dreaming of .At this moment, Huang Peng walked towards Huang Ming to offer his congratulations: \u201cCongratulations Big Brother . \u201dHuang Ming looked at Huang Peng\u2019s sincere face, then he patted Huang Peng\u2019s shoulders and said: \u201cThank you, Second Brother . Let\u2019s wait awhile, Xiaolong has yet to awaken his martial spirit, there is a chance that he too might possess a grade ten martial spirit . \u201d However, those who heard this understood that they were only words of comfort . After all, grade ten martial spirits weren\u2019t white cabbages .In the big hall, Huang Clan Manor Elders and some stewards were busy congratulating Huang Ming .\u201cWei\u2019er, come here . \u201d At this time, Huang Qide, who was standing in the center of the hall, laughed as he waved at Huang Wei .\u201cYes, Grandfather . \u201d Huang Wei replied . Before arriving at Huang Qide\u2019s side, he passed in front of Huang Xiaolong, and his eyes inadvertently swept past Huang Xiaolong, carrying obvious complacency and arrogance . This little exchange went unnoticed by others, however it did not escape Huang Xiaolong\u2019s perception .Grade ten martial spirit, Huang Xiaolong calmly looked back at him .Although Huang Wei was his cousin, the two of them weren\u2019t close . Two years ago, Huang Wei and several other children of the Elders were bullying his sister Huang Min and coincidentally, Huang Xiaolong happened upon the scene . Thus the consequence needs no explanation . Huang Wei and the several Elders\u2019 children were beaten up miserably . Ever since then, Huang Wei has held a grudge .Huang Wei walked over and stood in front of his grandfather . Huang Qide\u2019s hand reached out to rub Huang Wei\u2019s head, smiling and filled with love . Laughing, he turned to Huang Ming and said, \u201cHuang Ming, you did a good job of giving birth to an excellent grandson!\u201dOn the other end, Huang Ming felt a little embarrassed while listening to his father\u2019s praise, \u201dDad, don\u2019t you think we should first continue with the awakening ceremony?\u201dHuang Qide nodded in agreement, this was not the proper time to discuss this matter . Smiling amicably, he said: \u201cRight, let\u2019s continue with the awakening ceremony . \u201dAfter Huang Wei, it was Huang Xiaolong\u2019s turn . When Huang Qide spoke, the elders, stewards and disciples could not help but turn to look at Huang Xiaolong . Huang Wei as one of Huang Qide\u2019s grandsons has a grade ten martial spirit . What about Huang Xiaolong?With the assembled clan members watching, Huang Xiaolong calmly stepped into the hexagon-patterned light beam .Huang Peng and Su Yan could not help but hold each other\u2019s hand nervously, even their heartbeats quickened while watching their son stepping into the hexagonal light beam .Huang Xiaolong did not stay inside the light beam filled area for very long . Just like Huang Wei, a black light also appeared around Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body . Seeing this scene, the crowd stared blankly, and subsequently a blue light suddenly appeared next to the black light . Two different lights flashed intermittently, giving off a devilish sensation .Then, a black shadow and a blue shadow appeared behind Huang Xiaolong\u2019s head . Everyone saw a serpent-like creature that had two heads \u2212 one with a black head, the other a blue head .The surrounding people exchanged glances with each other .A double-headed serpent martial spirit?!Within their knowledge of beast type martial spirits, a double-headed serpent was either red or yellow in color, but this double-headed serpent appeared in black and blue .Huang Qide looked at the martial spirit behind Huang Xiaolong, his puzzled eyes were tinted with a trace of disappointment . In his opinion, this grandson\u2019s martial spirit was nothing but a variation of the double-headed serpent martial spirit . Some Huang Clan Manor disciples also possess variation types of martial spirits . Therefore, the emergence of a variation martial spirit was not uncommon . Even though a grade seven double-headed serpent was considered a high-grade martial spirit, compared to Huang Wei\u2019s Three-Eyed Black Tiger, the difference was like heaven and earth .Huang Peng and Su Yan looked at the martial spirit hovering behind their son, Huang Peng\u2019s expression differed not from Huang Qide . Although compared to the majority of the clan people a grade seven martial spirit\u2019s talent was considered high, Huang Peng was still a little disappointed with the outcome . Which parent doesn\u2019t wish the best for their children?\u201cOld Manor Lord, what do you think?\u201d Chief Steward Chen Ying couldn\u2019t help but refer to Huang Qide .Huang Qide declared: \u201cA variation of the double-headed serpent, grade seven martial spirit . \u201cAll Elders and stewards present in the temple hall nodded their heads, apparently agreeing with the Old Manor Lord\u2019s judgement .Grade seven martial spirit, a variation of the double-headed serpent? Huang Xiaolong stepped out from the hexagonal patterned light beam, his face calm . Only he knew his martial spirit wasn\u2019t as simple as a variation of the double-headed serpent .Seeing Huang Xiaolong\u2019s martial spirit was only a grade seven variant double-headed serpent, Huang Wei\u2019s mouth curved into a mocking sneer, his eyes provoking as directed them at Huang Xiaolong .Huang Xiaolong naturally noticed Huang Wei\u2019s provoking eyes, but he didn\u2019t mind in the least, for he was too lazy to play a staring game with a little kid .The child after Huang Xiaolong was Elder Zhou Guang\u2019s son, Zhou Xuedong . Zhou Xuedong was one of the Huang Clan Manor children Huang Xiaolong beat up for bullying Huang Min .Very quickly, Zhou Xuedong\u2019s martial spirit was revealed to be a grade six martial spirit \u2212 the Blood-Eyes Wolf . One by one, more than a dozen of the Huang Clan Manor\u2019s children stepped into the light beam and had their martial spirits awakened . Most of them possessed grade four martial spirits, some five, and even a few grade six martial spirits . There were a number of waste martial spirits and low-level ones as well .In this round of the martial spirit awakening ceremony, though Huang Xiaolong\u2019s martial spirit came in second, there was not much of a difference . He and the rest of the Huang Clan Manor children were just a sideshow, overshadowed by Huang Wei\u2019s grade ten martial spirit .After the awakening ceremony ended, Huang Qide smiled and said to Huang Ming, Huang Peng, and the other present elders: \u201cI will personally be advising Huang Wei\u2019s practice from now on . \u201dPersonally advise? Everyone was astonished .\u201cYes, Dad!\u201d Huang Ming\u2019s face bloomed, agreeing immediately .Looking at his own son, Huang Peng sighed regretfully in his heart after hearing his father\u2019s plan to oversee Huang Wei\u2019s cultivation personally .After a while, the crowd dispersed and the Martial Hall was closed .Returning to the Eastern Courtyard, Su Yan\u2019s heart was brimming with dissatisfaction, \u201cHow could Dad show such favoritism? He wants to oversee Huang Wei\u2019s practice personally . What about our Xiaolong? Is Xiaolong not his grandson?\u201dHuang Peng frowned and waved his hand, his voice heavy as he said: \u201cDon\u2019t mention this anymore . No one is allowed to bring this matter up in the future . \u201d However in his heart he too felt aggrieved, but with Huang Wei\u2019s grade ten martial spirit it was granted that his father would want to do so .\u201cXiaolong, your talent is also good . Put more effort into your practice, achieving Eighth Order Warrior will not be difficult for you . \u201d Huang Peng turned towards Huang Xiaolong and attempted to comfort him .\u201cI understand, Dad . \u201d Huang Xiaolong opened his mouth wanting to tell Huang Peng and Su Yan that his martial spirit shouldn\u2019t be grade seven . In the end, he could only reply as such and not say anything more .Before Huang Xiaolong left, Huang Peng gave him a cultivation technique for training battle qi and explained the important points Huang Xiaolong should focus on during practice . Huang Xiaolong listened attentively and memorized them to heart .After leaving the Eastern Courtyard\u2019s main hall, Huang Xiaolong returned to his own small courtyard and began practicing his battle qi according to the cultivation technique his father gave him . He sat down on the bed and started absorbing the world\u2019s spiritual energy according to the first order instruction .As Huang Xiaolong utilized the cultivation technique, his martial spirit emerged from his body; the variant double-headed serpent manifested behind Huang Xiaolong . The so-called grade seven double-headed serpent suddenly stretched its jaw wide and devoured the surrounding spiritual energy at horrific speed, attracting the spiritual energy around Huang Xiaolong .The spiritual energy devoured by the double-headed serpent flowed into Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body, traveling along the meridians and gradually transformed into battle qi .Night approached slowly . Moonlight came shining in from the small courtyard window .A short while later, Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes . His face wore an extremely odd expression . Earlier, he followed the instructions from the cultivation technique his father gave him, the Xuan Qin cultivation technique\u2019s first layer, to condense his battle qi by running spiritual energy along the meridians . He managed to direct the flow of spiritual energy for one complete turn without obstacles or difficulties .Within these few hours, not only did he successfully convert spiritual energy into battle qi, he broke through to First Order Warrior!Huang Xiaolong\u2019s heart was filled with a sense of disbelief . If he remembered correctly, his father mentioned that his grandfather spent nearly six months before successfully breaking through to First Order Warrior!His grandfather\u2019s martial spirit was one of the top grade eight martial spirits, the Six-winged Golden Ape!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

According to his father, the higher the grade of a martial spirit, the higher the cultivation talent and the faster one\u2019s cultivation speed . His grandfather, Huang Qide, possessed a top-tier grade eight Six-winged Golden Ape martial spirit and yet it took him half a year to breakthrough to First Order warrior, whereas he had only spent a few hours . In other words, his martial spirit\u2019s grade was even higher than his grandfather\u2019s!Grade ten martial spirit? No, a grade ten martial spirits cultivation speed wouldn\u2019t be this terrifying . A thought streaked across Huang Xiaolong\u2019s mind \u2026Superb talent martial spirit!Superb martial spirits existed only in myths and legends .Above grade ten there was said to exist grade eleven and even twelve! Although people were unsure about the highest grade a martial spirit could reach, it was certain that Huang Xiaolong\u2019s martial spirit was definitely above grade ten .Moments later, Huang Xiaolong managed to calm the excitement in his heart and continued running the Xuan Qin cultivation technique . The double-headed serpent once again emerged behind him with its mouths wide open, devouring the world\u2019s spiritual energy while battle qi circulated along his meridians, following the First Order Warriors\u2019 meridian route .This time around, the battle qi\u2019s circulation speed was a lot faster than before and Huang Xiaolong clearly noticed the battle qi within his meridians had grown thicker . Although the difference was not obvious, after circulating his battle qi a dozen times, the battle qi\u2019s thickness increased by almost half the original density .By the time Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes, the gentle moonlight had dissipated and was replaced by a ray of sunlight streaming in through the window onto his small body .Under the warm morning sun, Huang Xiaolong stretched lazily and got out of bed . During last night\u2019s practice, not only did he experience a breakthrough and became a First Order Warrior, he actually reached mid-First Order .\u201cMid-First Order . \u201d Huang Xiaolong\u2019s deep eyes watched the rising sun . According to this practice speed, within three days he would be able to reach late-First Order, perhaps even have another breakthrough and become a Second Order warrior!Huang Xiaolong walked out from the room to the little yard, his small hands clenched into a fist . Gathering his battle qi in his fist, Huang Xiaolong punched towards a half-meter big rock at the corner of the small yard .\u201cBoom!\u201d The sound of an explosion rang out and the half-meter big rock flew back and fell, rolling a few meters away . A corner of the rock crumbled into pieces and scattered on the ground .Huang Xiaolong looked at the result and nodded his head in satisfaction . In general, a late-First Order warriors\u2019 battle qi has the strength of one stone . While he was only at mid-First Order, because he trained in the Body Metamorphose Scripture, his attack power was comparable to a late-First Order warrior .The power of one stone was calculated at one hundred and twenty pounds .Huang Xiaolong also noticed after one night of practicing battle qi, the muscles in his body were stronger and more firm .Warriors from the First to Third Order were grouped into the initial stages of cultivation . In this initial stage, as battle qi flows along the meridians, it refines the body\u2019s muscles . By the time Huang Xiaolong reaches the pinnacle of Third Order warrior, his muscles will be fully developed, enhancing his reflexes, strength, and defense several times over compared to his current self .At this moment, sounds of light footsteps could be heard from outside the yard . Huang Xiaolong was startled for a moment and then shook his head, smiling when he realized the visitor was his little sister, Huang Min .Sure enough, Huang Min\u2019s innocent, tender voice sounded: \u201cBig Brother, Big Brother!Huang Xiaolong turned around and saw Huang Min running into the yard . When she reached Huang Xiaolong, Huang Min was panting heavily: \u201cBig brother, Mom and Dad are arguing . \u201d\u201cMom and Dad are arguing? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d Huang Xiaolong was confused for a moment . To his recollection, his parents had never quarreled .\u201cI don\u2019t know the reason, but it seems it\u2019s related to Eldest Uncle . \u201d Huang Min said .\u201cEldest Uncle?\u201d Huang Xiaolong frowned slightly, saying: \u201cWe\u2019ll go and see . \u201d Leaving the small courtyard with Huang Min, they hurried to the Eastern Courtyard . However, even before they reached the Eastern Courtyard\u2019s hall, from some distance away, the sound of their parents quarreling echoed out .\u201cBig Brother is too much!\u201d Su Yan\u2019s anger filled voice exclaimed . \u201cAfter the martial spirit awakening ceremony, all the children received a Battle Qi Dan except for our Xiaolong!\u201dHuang Xiaolong\u2019s pace halted .Battle Qi Dan?\u2212 a second-grade pill . After awakening a martial spirit, if one could get a Battle Qi Dan, it would speed up battle qi conversion . Of course for warriors belonging to the initial stages, a Battle Qi Dan also aided in enhancing battle qi\u2019s quality .\u201cDidn\u2019t Big Brother already say the Manor\u2019s supply of Battle Qi Dan just ran out? He will compensate Xiaolong next time . \u201d Huang Peng\u2019s irritated voice was heard coming from inside the hall .\u201cThere was a total of twenty-six children during the martial spirit awakening ceremony and even those with low-level and waste martial spirits received a Battle Qi Dan . All others received one except for our Xiaolong who has a grade seven martial spirit!\u201d Su Yan raised her voice in anger .\u201cWhy is it so? Our Xiaolong is his nephew!\u201dHuang Xiaolong furrowed his brow . Listening to his parents\u2019 quarrel, he understood clearly \u2013 other than him, all other children were given a Battle Qi Dan to aid their cultivation .Two years ago, when Huang Xiaolong seriously beat up Huang Wei, Huang Ming did not say anything at the time . It seems Eldest Uncle Huang Ming\u2019s resentment towards him had been stewing for a long while .Although his grandfather Huang Qide had yet to pass the Manor Lord position to his Eldest Uncle Huang Ming, it was irrefutable that most matters of the manor were handled by him, especially in recent years . Just as his mother Su Yan said, even those with waste and low-level martial spirits were given a Battle Qi Dan . Only Huang Xiaolong, his nephew, did not get any . This was blatant bullying!No matter what, Huang Xiaolong was Huang Ming\u2019s nephew\u2013 was it really necessary for Huang Ming to act so crudely?Huang Ming\u2019s action not only proved he resented Huang Xiaolong, it also equaled sweeping face for Huang Xiaolong\u2019s parents, Huang Peng and Su Yan, in front of all the Huang Clan Manor Elders .\u201cThis cannot be . I\u2019m going to ask Dad to judge the fairness of this matter!\u201d Inside the hall, Su Yan discontentedly retorted for she was unable to swallow this down .\u201cYou come back here!\u201d Huang Peng shouted furiously, \u201cFor some small matter, you are going to trouble Father . Do you think that I haven\u2019t lost enough face?\u201dOutside the hall, when Huang Xiaolong heard this, he silently turned to leave . A small matter, is it? A glint flashed across Huang Xiaolong eyes . His Uncle Huang Ming has yet to obtain the Manor Lord\u2019s position, but once he has officially taken over, these types of small things will become much bigger!Huang Min saw Huang Xiaolong remain silent, turning to leave without a word . She could not help but stand there in a daze for a moment before reacting . She tried to catch up to Huang Xiaolong: \u201cBig Brother, Big Brother!\u201dHuang Xiaolong did not reply, the two of them left the Eastern Courtyard . Coincidentally, just as he stepped out they came face-to-face with Huang Wei . Trailing behind him was his usual gang of brothers, the same group that bullied Huang Min .Seeing both Huang Xiaolong and his sister exiting the Eastern Courtyard, Huang Wei was startled for a moment before he stepped towards Huang Xiaolong with the group .Note:Sweeping/Slapping face- actions of insult .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His eyes were dotted red with bloodlust as he retorted lightly: \u201cSo what, do you want to fight?\u201d His heart was already fuming while leaving the Eastern Courtyard .The eldest son of Elder Zhou Guang, Zhou Xuedong, was standing behind Huang Wei and was unhappy with Huang Xiaolong\u2019s attitude . \u201cDamn it, who do you think you\u2026!\u201d Before his sentence finished, a pitiful cry rang out which was due to Huang Xiaolong kicking Zhou Guang\u2019s belly so hard that he flew back, curling his body like a cooked shrimp .Since Huang Xiaolong\u2019s heart was burning with rage, the power he exerted in his kick was naturally not light . Zhou Xuedong flew back, dropped to the ground and rolled six to seven meters before coming to a stop . His hands clutched his belly and his mouth was wide open but no sound came out \u2013 it was as if all of his internal organs were burning in a sea of fire .After gasping a few breaths, Zhou Xuedong cried . And damn, it was an earth-shattering, ugly-looking kind of cry . Huang Xiaolong glanced at the dust-covered Zhou Xuedong, his face wet with tears cascading down like a waterfall . Huang Xiaolong curled his lips thinking; \u201cA little brat is a little brat, tears streaming down like piss . . . just touch it a little and it will start leaking . \u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Huang Wei and his gang reacted in that moment . All of them stared at Huang Xiaolong with shock and panic in their eyes . Huang Wei didn\u2019t expect Huang Xiaolong to be so ruthless, even more so compared to two years ago .\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Huang Xiaolong looked directly at Huang Wei and the boys behind him, a brilliant smile surfaced: \u201cYou also want me to give you a kick?\u201dHearing this, Huang Wei and the rest retreated a few steps by reflex, looking warily at Huang Xiaolong\u2019s right leg .Huang Xiaolong laughed while watching this scene, his laughter causing Huang Wei\u2019s face to turn beet-red with anger and shame . Fire raged in Huang Wei\u2019s heart and he shouted at Huang Xiaolong in order to cover his embarrassment, \u201cHuang Xiaolong, you dare assault an elder\u2019s son without good reason, just wait for your punishment!\u201d\u201cAssault without reason?\u201d Huang Xiaolong\u2019s cold gaze swept across Huang Wei\u2019s body as sharply as a knife .Huang Wei did not dare to look directly at Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes and instead declared weakly with false bravado: \u201cYou . . . just you wait until the end of the year\u2019s annual assembly . I will let you look good[1]!\u201d Then, Huang Wei left with the boys trailing behind him in quick, panicky steps, not forgetting to bring along Zhou Xuedong who was still clutching his belly .\u201cBig Brother, you hit Zhou Xuedong . If Huang Wei complains about it to Eldest Uncle, at that time will he\u2026?\u201d Huang Min asked with a worried expression, thinking how their Eldest Uncle Huang Ming whipped people during punishment, Huang Min couldn\u2019t help but feel afraid .\u201cIt\u2019s nothing . Don\u2019t worry about it . \u201d Huang Xiaolong said without any concern as he looked at the awkward retreating backs of Huang Wei\u2019s group .He was confident that his kick would not leave any detectable bruises or injuries . Even if Huang Ming or Zhou Guang checked Zhou Xuedong\u2019s body, they would not find any evidence . Even if his Uncle Huang Ming wants to punish him, he would still need to have some evidence\u2013 just like two years ago when he beat up Huang Wei and the several Elders\u2019 children miserably, Huang Xiaolong received no punishment .\u201cThe end of the year\u2019s Clan Assembly . . . \u201d Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself after Huang Wei and his group disappeared from view, his eyes glinting with a sharp light .At the end of every year, the Huang Clan Manor holds a clan assembly where young people from the Huang Clan Manor of similar ages were allowed to spar with one another as a learning experience .It seems Huang Wei was planning to oppose him during the Clan Assembly at the end of the year . By doing so, Huang Wei would not only display his strength and talent in front of everyone, but also settle his grudge with Huang Xiaolong in public .There was still five months until the Clan Assembly, and with Huang Wei\u2019s talent, five months was enough time to reach late-First Order . Moreover, Huang Wei has Grandfather Huang Qide\u2019s support and advice in cultivation .Huang Xiaolong could not help but to laugh, albeit a little sinisterly\u2013 in that case, five months later he would beat up Huang Ming\u2019s son right in front of his face until even he couldn\u2019t recognize Huang Wei .\u201cDuring the Annual Clan Assembly, Grandfather would probably come to watch . \u201d In Huang Xiaolong\u2019s opinion, since Huang Wei was his valued grandson and under his personal tutelage, he would certainly make an appearance .A short while later, Huang Xiaolong sent his sister along before heading to the back mountain .At the back of the mountain, Huang Xiaolong practiced the Body Metamorphose Scripture before returning to his small courtyard .The Body Metamorphose Scripture was Huaxia\u2019s [2] secret martial art from his previous life . Even if Huang Xiaolong did not cultivate battle qi, he would continue to train in the Body Metamorphose Scripture . It was rumored that once trained to the highest level, there was a mysterious force hidden in the Body Metamorphose Scripture .During last night\u2019s battle qi practice, Huang Xiaolong noticed the internal force inside his body circulated along his meridians at the same time as the battle qi, complementing each other . Huang Xiaolong reaching mid-First Order warrior was due to his training in the Body Metamorphose Scripture for four years . Otherwise, even if Huang Xiaolong had a superb talent martial spirit, it was impossible to reach mid-First Order warrior in just one night .Back in his small courtyard, Huang Xiaolong started running the Xuan Qin cultivation technique and continued his battle qi practice .Three days passed quickly .Apart from eating and answering nature\u2019s call over the past three days, every minute was spent practicing, trading between practicing battle qi in his yard and running to the back mountain to train the Body Metamorphose Scripture .On the fourth day .The silvery moonlight shined in the dead silence of the night .Like the past three nights, Huang Xiaolong sat on his bed and practiced according to the Xuan Qin cultivation technique . The double-headed serpent martial spirit emerged behind him, devouring heaven and earth\u2019s spiritual energy at horrifying speed and channeled it into Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body, converting it into battle qi . Compared to three days prior, the thickness of Huang Xiaolong\u2019s battle qi inside his body had increased by ten-fold .Running the cultivation technique, battle qi rapidly surged along his meridians .After three days of non-stop practice, Huang Xiaolong reached the peak of late-First Order; he had a hunch that he would have a successful breakthrough to the Second Order tonight .About one hour later, as battle qi surged within Huang Xiaolong\u2019s meridians, its speed grew faster and more volatile, like stormy waves, inducing pain as it crashed against his meridians, but to Huang Xiaolong this level of pain was nothing .As battle qi crashed violently throughout his meridians, Huang Xiaolong had a feeling his breakthrough was close but there was a barrier hindering him . He was unable to forcefully cross over the threshold, akin to a giant wave crashing against a solid wall .Huang Xiaolong was not discouraged . He knew it was important to remain calm and continued to run the Xuan Qin cultivation technique, circulating battle qi along his meridians . Suddenly, a sound permeated his body that only he could hear: the second barrier finally broke!The first layer meridian broke like a popped cork, battle qi instantly and enthusiastically gushed into the second layer\u2019s meridians .Huang Xiaolong was delighted . He finally broke through to Second Order Warrior after a few days of hard work .Note:[1] will let you look good \u2013 \u00a0read as I will let you suffer (tremendously) / You\u2019ll pay the consequences[2] Huaxia \u2013 usually used to describe the C country .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was an unprecedented event .In general, a grade ten martial spirit would require at least one year\u2019s time to breakthrough to Second Order . Even if one possesses a superb talent martial spirit, one needs at least six months to achieve this result .However, Huang Xiaolong only spent three days!Suppressing the excitement in his heart, he continued running the Xuan Qin cultivation technique so that the second layer\u2019s battle qi that was flowing into his meridians became smoother and calmer, circulating slowly .If first layer battle qi meridians are akin to a small stream, then the second layer battle qi meridians are comparable to a small river, wider and larger, accommodating more battle qi .The night passed .When the morning sun\u2019s warmth streamed through the window onto Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body . Huang Xiaolong stopped his practice and opened his eyes . After one night\u2019s practice, he had stabilized his Second Order warrior cultivation .I wonder what little brat Huang Wei\u2019s progress is like? Huang Xiaolong thought, before jumping down from his bed and heading out of the room, stretching his limbs while facing the sun .Leaving his room, in the little yard, Huang Xiaolong caught sight of the very same half meter sized big rock in the corner that he hit several days prior . \u00a0He couldn\u2019t resist himself so he walked up to the big rock while lifting his right hand\u2013 battle qi wrapped around his palm as he landed a strike on the rock . The big rock trembled violently as small pieces of rubble crumbled down, scattering all over the place .On the surface of the big rock, one could see minuscule crack lines . Retrieving his right hand while observing the power of his palm, Huang Xiaolong nodded with satisfaction . As per his expectation, after advancing to Second Order warrior, his strength was actually comparable to a late-Second Order warrior\u2013 that\u2019s equivalent to the power of two stones .Back on earth, if a seven-year-old child had the strength of two hundred pounds it would be an unbelievable marvel, but here on Martial Spirit World it was nothing to be lauded .From the little courtyard, Huang Xiaolong headed towards the Eastern Courtyard .Not far from his little courtyard he heard several manor guards\u2019 gossiping .\u201cGee, I heard that Young Lord Huang Wei successfully condensed his battle qi in just three days! During our time, it took us two months to condense our battle qi . At this rate, Young Lord Huang Wei will be able to break through to First Order warrior in less than four months!\u201d\u201cI wonder how Young Lord Xiaolong\u2019s practice is going?\u201d\u201cYoung Lord Xiaolong? Although Young Lord Xiaolong\u2019s talent is not bad, to successfully condense battle qi would require at least a month\u2019s time . That is simply incomparable to Young Lord Huang Wei . To break through to the First Order would be a minimum of one year\u2019s time!So, that little brat Huang Wei was already successful in condensing his battle qi? Huang Xiaolong stood there with his hand behind his back, just like a small-sized adult as he watched the several manor guards walk away .Looking at the disappearing backs of the manor guards, Huang Xiaolong headed towards the Eastern Courtyard\u2019s hall . Moments later after reaching the Eastern Courtyard and entering the main hall, other than his father and mother, there was also his little sister, Huang Min, and his four-year-old little brother, Huang Xiaohai .\u201cDad, Mom . \u201d Huang Xiaolong called out as he entered the main hall .\u201cSit . \u201d Huang Peng raised his head indicating to Huang Xiaolong that he sit at a particular chair inside the main hall, a trace of worry on his face . Sitting down, Huang Xiaolong found that Su Yan\u2019s expression was the same as his father\u2019s, so he opened his mouth and asked: \u201cDad, Mom, what happened?\u201d\u201cA few days ago, you beat up Zhou Guang\u2019s son?\u201d Huang Peng stared at his son and asked .Huang Xiaolong directed his gaze towards his little sister, Huang Min . Without a doubt, this matter was reported by his sister . \u00a0Conscious that Huang Xiaolong was looking at her, Huang Min stuck out her small tongue, afraid to look at Huang Xiaolong .\u201cThat kid was looking for a beating . \u201d Huang Xiaolong calmly said .Huang Peng and Su Yan were taken aback, looking at each other .\u201cHow is your practice these few days?\u201d Huang Peng asked moments later, no longer questioning on the previous matter . These past few days, Huang Xiaolong had been training day and night, regardless of the time . Huang Peng and Su Yan had of course noticed this, and they felt comforted that Huang Xiaolong was putting effort into his cultivation .Hearing his father\u2019s question about his practice, Huang Xiaolong hesitated for a moment, should he tell them the truth? Or should he conceal part of his strength, or perhaps reveal that he already condensed battle qi?Seeing his son\u2019s look of hesitation, Huang Peng comforted him: \u201cIt\u2019s only been a few days, it doesn\u2019t matter if you haven\u2019t condensed out battle qi\u2013 I spent a whole month before I successfully condensed out battle qi . \u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right . Xiaolong, your talent is higher than your Dad\u2019s . You\u2019ll definitely be able to condense battle qi after a month . \u201d Su Yan said .In truth, the two of them seeing the look of hesitation on Huang Xiaolong\u2019s face made them think that Huang Xiaolong was embarrassed to answer that he had yet to condense battle qi .Huang Xiaolong blanked for a moment listening to his parent\u2019s words . However, after a little thinking, he went along his parent\u2019s line of thought, saying: \u201cDad, Mom, rest assured that one month later I will surely be able to condense out battle qi . \u201dListening to their son\u2019s \u2018oath\u2019, both Huang Peng and Su Ya were very pleased .Although Huang Xiaolong said that, worry deepened on their faces as they thought about the dubiousness of Huang Xialong\u2019s oath . Huang Peng then replied to his son, saying: \u201cXiaolong, the day before yesterday, Huang Wei announced that he would cripple both of your arms during the Annual Clan Assembly!\u201dHuang Xiaolong finally understood the look of worry on his parents\u2019 faces .Others might not dare to do so, but since Huang Wei dared say as much, then he probably will cripple his arms during the clan assembly and claim that it was accidental . At that time, even Grandfather Huang Qide would not penalize him and instead just reprimand him with a few stern words at most .\u201cCripple both of my arms?\u201d Huang Xiaolong smiled, a trace of viciousness rising in his heart .Seeing Huang Xiaolong\u2019s look of unconcern, Su Yan was afraid that Huang Xiaolong did not know the gravity of the matter: \u201cXiaolong, Huang Wei has successfully condensed battle qi and by the end of the year, he will be able to achieve late-First Order warrior . He\u2019ll do what he said\u2013 at that time, he will definitely cripple both of your arms . \u201d As Su Yan said this, an image of Xiaolong\u2019s hands being crippled flashed through her mind and her eyes turned red .\u201cWhat should we do? What can we do?\u201d Su Yan broke down in tears .Huang Peng looked at his wife that was drowning in tears and was extremely vexed: \u201cWoman, why are you crying? Can crying be of any help?\u201dSu Yan turned over with a face full of tears: \u201cIf Xiaolong is disabled, what will you do then? If both of Xiaolong\u2019s hands are wasted, how will he continue to live? Huang Peng, why don\u2019t you seek Big Brother out, let him ask Huang Wei to let our Xiaolong off!\u201d\u201cImplore big brother?\u201d Huang Peng frowned .\u201cI know this will cause you to lose face, but do you prefer to see Xiaolong\u2019s hands crippled?\u201d Su Yan said, crying even louder .Seeing Su Yan crying so miserably, the two little ones, Huang Min and Huang Xiaohai, both walked over to her side and started crying together with her .Just when Huang Xiaolong wanted to say something, Huang Peng suddenly stood up while gritting his teeth: \u201cOkay, I\u2018ll go!\u201d After saying that, holding Huang Xiaolong\u2019s small hand, he led him towards the direction of the Northern Courtyard .\u201cFather, I\u2013\u201d Coming out from the Eastern Courtyard main hall, Huang Xiaolong opened his mouth wanting to say it was not necessary to look for Huang Ming, but he was interrupted by Huang Peng: \u201cXiaolong, in front of your Eldest Uncle, you must behave, understand?\u201d After saying that, without waiting for Huang Xiaolong\u2019s reply, he and Huang Xiaolong headed towards the Northern Courtyard .When they reached the Northern Courtyard, Huang Ming and Huang Wei, this father and son, were in the main hall . Coincidentally, Zhou Guang and Zhou Xuedong were also there .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sit . \u201cHuang Peng and Huang Xiaolong sat down on the chairs to the side . As Huang Peng was sitting down, he was contemplating how he should word his request to Huang Ming .\u201cSecond Brother, what brings you over here?\u201d At this moment, Huang Ming asked .Huang Peng hesitated for a moment before honestly saying: \u201cBig brother, I heard Huang Wei had said that at the end-of-the-year annual Clan Assembly, he will cripple both of Xiaolong\u2019s arms, so\u2026\u201d Huang Peng\u2019s words trailed off here .\u201cOh, is there such a matter?\u201d Huang Ming looked astonished .Huang Xiaolong looking at his Uncle Huang Ming\u2019s deadpan expression and snickered inwardly . Even his father, Huang Peng, has heard about the matter, which means the news had already spread to the entire Huang Clan Manor\u3161there is no way that Huang Ming did not know about it .\u201cHuang Wei, is there such a matter?\u201d \u00a0Huang Ming turned over and asked his son, Huang Wei .Huang Wei answered with unblinking eyes and an unchanging facial expression: \u201cThere is no such thing . \u201d Glancing at Huang Peng and Huang Xiaolong, Huang Wei continued: \u201cIn my opinion, there are people who are \u00a0deliberately using this as an excuse to cause trouble for our Northern Courtyard . \u201dHuang Peng\u2019s face turned beet red from anger when he heard this . Did this mean that he and his son were idle people with nothing better to do so instead would run over to cause trouble for Huang Ming and his son?Huang Xiaolong was watching Huang Ming and Huang Wei . This pair of father and son\u2019s \u2018performance\u2019 where one person asks innocently and the other answers in kind was ridiculous . He sneered in his heart .\u201cBig brother, what do you say about this matter?!\u201d Holding back his anger, Huang Peng turned to Huang Ming .Huang Ming waved, still maintaining his deadpan expression: \u201cWell, Second brother since there is no such thing, you can go back now . \u201cNo such thing! The meaning behind Huang Ming\u2019s words was extremely clear\u3161that Huang Peng came over to look for trouble .Repressing his rising anger, Huang Peng said: \u201cBig brother, you mean to say that us, father and son, have nothing better to do, so we came over here to make trouble for you?!\u201dHuang Ming frowned as his face turned cold: \u201cEven if the matter is true, what about it? Sparring between same age peers during the Clan Assembly is a common event . \u201dHuang Ming said this frivolously but he did not mention anything about Huang Wei wanting to cripple both of Huang Xiaolong\u2019s arms .Huang Peng stood up in a rage, staring at his Big Brother Huang Ming: \u201cAre you saying even if Huang Wei wasted both of Xiaolong\u2019s arms, this is normal?!\u201dWith indifference on his face, Huang Ming said, \u201cThen, are you implying that I should ban the peer sparring event during the annual Clan Assembly? The peer sparring event is a rule set by Father . Do you mean to say the rules set by Father are wrong?\u201dA harsh light glinted in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes . His father\u2019s intention was just to have Huang Ming advise his son to let Huang Xiaolong off . Everyone in the hall knew what his father\u2019s intention was . But Huang Ming twisted the facts, claiming that Huang Peng was requesting him, Huang Ming, to ban an event set by their Father to make things difficult for him .Zhou Guang and Zhou Xuedong, both father and son, sat there without speaking . In their eyes, their gloating pleasure was obvious .Huang Peng\u2019s face flushed red with anger . Clenching both of his fists and taking a deep breath, he said to Huang Ming: \u201cXiaolong is your nephew!\u201dHuang Ming raised his eyebrow, glanced at Huang Xiaolong and said to Huang Peng, \u201cDo I need you to remind me about this? Don\u2019t I know he is my nephew? Even if he is my nephew, it is useless for you to beg me!\u201dHuang Peng laughed despite his anger . \u201cGood, good . \u201d Now, he finally sees his big brother\u2019s true face and a chilling feeling filled his heart\u3161decades of brotherhood, yet they are no better than strangers!Huang Xiaolong couldn\u2019t resist saying in a cold voice: \u201cHuang Ming, do you truly think that your son is capable of crippling me during the Clan Assembly?\u201cImpudent!\u201d Seeing a little brat like Huang Xiaolong daring to refer to him by name in front of Zhou Guang, he furiously stood up and he raised his palm to strike at Huang Xiaolong . An overbearing battle qi was aimed towards Huang Xiaolong\u2019s chest . Suddenly, a silhouette flashed and blocked the battle qi for Huang Xiaolong .\u201cBoom!\u201d An explosion resounded and the silhouette blocking the attack in front of Huang Xiaolong staggered back heavily with a \u201cdeng deng\u201d sound .\u201cDad, are you okay?!\u201d Huang Xiaolong was anxious as he sped to his father\u2019s side .Huang Peng waved his hand, shaking his head: \u201cI\u2019m fine . \u201dIn the end, Huang Xiaolong was still Huang Ming\u2019s nephew . Although he was angered, Huang Ming struck with control . Otherwise, with Huang Peng\u2019s late-Sixth Order strength, it would be insufficient to block a palm from Huang Ming, a late-Seventh Order warrior .Huang Xiaolong seeing that his father was not injured breathed a sigh of relief .At this time, Huang Wei who was quietly standing on the side came up and said: \u201cSecond uncle if you want me to let Huang Xiaolong off, it is not impossible as long as Huang Xiaolong kneels down, kowtows three times loudly, and lets me slap him twenty times at the end of the year Clan Assembly . Then I will let him off!\u201dKowtow three times and twenty slaps? Huang Peng\u2019s brows creased tightly and he looked at his son .Huang Xiaolong looked at Huang Wei and said with a cold voice, \u201cIn the past or now, I, Huang Xiaolong, kneel before Heaven and kneel before Earth, but never before a person!\u201d Then, turning to Huang Peng he said, \u201cFather, let\u2019s go!\u201dKneeling before Heaven, kneeling before Earth, but never before a person! Huang Peng was startled but he smiled appreciatively: \u201cGood, son! Let\u2019s go!\u201d Saying that, Huang Peng and Huang Xiaolong turned to leave .Huang Wei looked at Huang Peng and Huang Xiaolong\u2019s departing silhouettes and with anger rising in his heart he started yelling at Huang Xiaolong\u2019s back: \u201cHuang Xiaolong, do you think I wouldn\u2019t dare to cripple your arms during the Clan Assembly?\u201dHuang Xiaolong didn\u2019t even turn around as he left the Northern Courtyard entrance with his father . Huang Ming looked at the two disappearing figures, his face complicated .\u201cEldest Manor Lord, just because of Huang Xiaolong\u2019s identity was he disrespectful to family elders, even daring to refer to Eldest Manor Lord by name . This is too-\u201d At this time, Zhou Guang walked up to Huang Ming and was speaking .However, the words had yet to finish before Huang Ming\u2019s palm swept past Zhou Guang\u2019s face, leaving behind a clear red five-finger mark on his face .Huang Ming looked at Zhou Guang, his face expressionless but his eyes were as sharp as knives: \u201cThis is something between us brothers, you are not qualified to butt in!\u201d\u201cYes, yes, Eldest Manor Lord, it is subordinate\u2019s mistake, subordinate\u2019s mistake!\u201d Zhou Guang panicked and apologized over and over again .After a while, Huang Xiaolong and his father, Huang Peng, returned to the Eastern Courtyard . Su Yan, knowing that Huang Xiaolong and Huang Peng had returned, quickly walked up to them and asked in a worried voice: \u201cHow was it?\u201dHuang Peng did not know how to explain . Instead, it was Huang Xiaolong who said: \u201cMom, you don\u2019t have to worry about the Clan Assembly, I will be fine . Nothing will happen to me . \u201dAfter hearing this, Su Yan thought Huang Wei had promised to let Huang Xiaolong off during the Clan Assembly\u2018s sparring event and her worried heart was finally appeased . Smiling, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, then all is good!\u201dHuang Peng opened his mouth wanting to say something, but looking at his wife\u2019s happy smile, he said nothing in the end .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Both Huang Wei and his father\u2019s arrogant, cold, and hypocritical performance caused a trace of malice to emerge in his heart .Initially, he had some scruples when he planned to beat Huang Wei miserably during the end of the year\u2019s Clan Assembly . But now, it had completely evaporated .\u201cPresumably, Huang Ming thinks the position of the Main Manor Lord will not slip from his fingers!\u201d Huang Xiaolong snickered .Ever since Huang Wei\u2019s martial spirit awakened, the majority of elders were trying to get closer to Huang Ming which brought about the previous incident regarding the Battle Qi dan, along with the Northern Courtyard scene today .A short while later, repressing his hostility, Huang Xiaolong started running the Xuan Qin cultivation technique to train his battle qi .The double-headed serpent martial spirit emerged, hovering behind Huang Xiaolong, and started devouring the surrounding world\u2019s spiritual energy . Huang Xiaolong noticed that after his advancement to Second Order warrior, his martial spirit\u2019s speed of absorbing spiritual energy had increased substantially .Aside from that, both of the previously palm-sized double-headed serpent martial spirit\u2019s had grown twice in size, its radiant black light and blue light becoming thicker and brighter . As the double-headed serpent martial spirit devoured spiritual energy from the surroundings, black and blue lights shimmered constantly in the room .Multiple strands of spiritual energy were being absorbed into Huang Xiaolong\u2019s meridians, converting into battle qi continuously, flowing along the second layer meridians over and over again .A few days passed by in a flash .These past few days, Huang Xiaolong once again practiced like a madman regardless of the time .The result from these days of practice was that Huang Xiaolong managed to reach the peak of early Second Order .During this period, Huang Peng and Su Yan dropped by on a daily basis to Huang Xiaolong\u2019s small courtyard in order to check on him . Seeing their son practice in such a crazed manner, both Huang Peng and Su Yan felt distressed . Su Yan had even started secretly crying because even though Huang Peng and Huang Xiaolong never mentioned in detail about what happened in the Northern Courtyard, she still managed to find out what took place a few days ago from the manor servants\u2019 gossip .Half a month passed .In this half a month, Huang Xiaolong was either training his battle qi in his small courtyard or training in his Body Metamorphose Scripture in the back mountain . As the Body Metamorphose Scripture was a secret, he could only sneak out to practice at the back mountain at night .Under the cover of night\u2019s darkness within the thick forest stood a small figure in a strange position .The dark night, the dense forest trees, and a small figure standing there in a strange position . This scene was complete with moonlight shining through the gaps in the foliage, marking the ground with soft silvery spots .With hands above his head, Huang Xiaolong ran through the Body Metamorphose Scripture law, attracting the world\u2019s spiritual energy, making it visible to the naked eye . Energy could be seen gushing into Huang Xiaolong\u2019s meridians, converting into internal force before converging in his dantian under his navel .The night gradually faded as light overtook the darkness and the dew drops that formed on the grass reflected the sunlight . Huang Xiaolong stopped running through the Body Metamorphose Scripture law before opening his eyes .Suddenly, Huang Xiaolong gave a low shout . Waving both of his palms, his silhouette leaped high above the ground as shadows of a palm strike fell heavily onto the grass patch below .Energy swirled rapidly in the surrounding space, whistling through the wind .This superior martial skill was something inherited from Huang Xiaolong\u2019s family in his previous life, the Ethereal Palm .As Huang Xiaolong\u2019s palms struck out, his arms seemingly impalpable and intangible, a palm print condensed of vapor imprinted in mid-air, each palm strike not dissipating even after a long period of time .Ethereal Palm\u2019s highest level of mastery, condensing without dissipating, endless internal power .In his previous life, Huang Xiaolong was known as a martial arts prodigy not only because of his physique, but also due to his amazing comprehension ability .Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong gradually stopped .After a few breaths time, trees in the surrounding area tumbled down, a palm print visible on each tree trunk .Looking at the palm prints on the tree trunks, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s brows wrinkled . If this was his previous life, his Ethereal Palm would not be leaving any visible mark . In the end, it was all because his internal force was still too weak .\u201cI wonder, what is the power of this Martial Spirit World\u2019s fighting skills?\u201d Huang Xiaolong thought to himself .Common clans\u2019 regulations only allowed children who have achieved at least mid-Fourth Order warrior to practice in a clan\u2019s battle technique because only by achieving this level of foundation would they be able to display the power of the battle technique . In the initial warrior stages, they are of little use .At that moment, Huang Xiaolong suddenly heard a strange noise behind him . Turning around to look, he saw hanging on a big tree not far away, a half meter sized creature whose body was violet in color and had light blue eyes .\u201cViolet Devourer Spirit Monkey!\u201d Huang Xiaolong was astonished .Huang Xiaolong once saw a drawing of it in his previous life\u2019s old family records\u2013 the Violet Devourer Spirit Monkey was a rare spirit beast .Seeing Huang Xiaolong looking at it, the little violet spirit monkey grinned and squeaked \u2018Zhi zhi\u2019, his hands gesturing towards Huang Xiaolong . Then it turned around and ran in the direction of the deeper parts of the mountains .Huang Xiaolong hesitated for a second before following the little violet monkey into the depths of the mountains .What surprised Huang Xiaolong was the speed of the Violet Devourer Spirit Monkey as it weaved through the thick foliage . If not for Huang Xiaolong training in the Body Metamorphose Scripture and using Sky Gyration Step, it would really be hard keeping up with the little violet monkey\u2019s speed .Half an hour later, after crossing many a small stream and forest area, Huang Xiaolong finally arrived at an odd looking valley while following the little violet monkey . It was quiet inside the valley with heavy yin qi that was spreading out from the inner valley, making Huang Xiaolong furrow his brows .\u201cZhi zhi zhi!\u201d As Huang Xiaolong was seriously contemplating whether he wanted to enter the valley, the little violet monkey ran back out from within, squeaking at Huang Xiaolong . Apparently it wanted Huang Xiaolong to follow it into the valley .After a brief moment of consideration, Huang Xiaolong lifted his foot and stepped into the valley, following behind the little guy . Entering the valley, a wave of thick yin qi hit Huang Xiaolong in the face, carrying an unpleasant odor . Not far into the valley, there were large piles and even mountains of dead bones scattered everywhere, belonging to an era long gone .As they moved deeper into the valley, more and more mountains of bones decorated the scene . Even with Huang Xiaolong\u2019s experience of two lifetimes which made his mind and will stronger than most children his age, he was unable to keep calm in this situation .However, when Huang Xiaolong was about to turn back and leave, he suddenly came to a large plain of green grass with exotic flowers\u2019 fragrances permeating the air . It was like a painted depiction of Eden had manifested into reality . In the center of the plain, there was a turquoise lake . Huang Xiaolong was dumbstruck when looking at the valley . Never would he have imagined the possibility of the front half of this valley being littered with dead bones, just like a scene from hell, while the other half was a utopia .At this moment, the little violet monkey went up to a mountain cliff, squeaking and gesturing towards Huang Xiaolong while pointing to the top of the cliff . Huang Xiaolong walked over and his eyes followed in the direction pointed by those tiny fingers . Growing almost all the way at the top of the cliff on a short, thick, green vine were a few red colored fruits .These red colored fruits made one who looked at it disoriented . Fragrance from the fruits wafted through the air, mesmerizing the audience .\u201cThis\u2026 could this be Yang fruit?\u201d Huang Xiaolong was stunned, greatly astounded .Yang fruit grows on lands of extreme yin, absorbing nine types of yang qi between heaven and earth . If taken by people who cultivate in battle qi, not only can it enhance battle qi cultivation, it also purifies the marrow and provides a pulp-washing effect, which will bring unimaginable benefits to one\u2019s future cultivation .Notes:Ethereal Palm \u2013 skill base on the ability to manipulate the \u2018soft/hidden\u2019 internal force instead of the more direct destructive power .Initial stages warrior; First to Third Order Warrior (Chapter 3)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His throat convulsed nervously and then turned towards the Violet Devourer Spirit Monkey as he finally understood why this little violet monkey brought him over .The several pieces of Yang Fruit were about twenty to thirty meters high on the cliff . This little guy could only look but was unable to eat, thus bringing him over to help pick the fruits .\u201cLittle guy, you brought me over here to help you pick these Yang fruits?\u201d Huang Xiaolong asked .\u201cHoo Hoo Hoo!\u201d Delight showed in the little violet monkey\u2019s eyes as it nodded enthusiastically .Huang Xiaolong smiled . This little guy was truly quite cute . Turning back towards the Yang fruits that were more than twenty meters up on the cliff, he surveyed the surroundings .The cliff wall was smooth all the way up to the peak and it almost had no spots to firmly grab hold of . Picking the twenty meter high fruits was no easy task, especially for the current Huang Xiaolong .Moments later, Huang Xiaolong leaped up . \u00a0Reaching to a height of about four to five meters, his fingers bent into a claw-shape and his fingertips sunk into the cliff wall . However, the cliff wall was rock-hard and his fingers only managed to insert a few millimeters deep, but it was enough to support his small body while dangling mid-air .Subsequently, he did the same with his left hand, bending his fingers into claws and inserted them higher up into the cliff wall, stabilizing his body . Just like this, one step at a time, Huang Xiaolong slowly climbed towards to Yang fruits .Every step of the way, he needed to exert his internal force to support his body, making it extremely strenuous . When he passed the ten-meter mark he was already panting heavily, his speed slowing down .On the ground, the cheerful squeaking little violet monkey quieted down . The pair of light blue eyes gazed worriedly at Huang Xiaolong\u2019s silhouette as if it was worried Huang Xiaolong may tumble down at any time .Under the watchful eyes of the Violet Devourer Spirit Monkey, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s small, thin body finally reached the Yang fruit after he climbed over twenty meters in height . Looking at the five pieces of Yang fruit in front of him, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes shined brightly as he carefully withdrew a small cloth that he prepared earlier, gently picking the Yang fruits one by one before placing them into the small piece of cloth and wrapping them carefully, then finally leaping off to the ground .Huang Xiaolong tapped his foot a few times against the cliff wall to reduce his landing speed while in mid-air on the way down .Seeing him successfully pick the Yang fruits, the little violet monkey started squeaking cheerfully, gesturing happily with his little paws .After demonstrating its delight, the little violet monkey calmed down and started staring pitifully at the little cloth bundle in Huang Xialong\u2019s hands that held the Yang fruits .\u201cLittle guy, catch!\u201d Huang Xiaolong could not help but laugh at the antics of the little violet monkey . Removing two pieces of Yang fruit from the cloth bundle, he threw it over . The little violet monkey leaped up and caught both fruits, one in each hand . Giving Huang Xiaolong a happy cry, it went to a corner and swallowed both fruits before sitting down to absorb the spiritual energy from the Yang fruits .Seeing the little violet monkey running a cultivation technique to absorb the energy from the fruit, Huang Xiaolong was not surprised . Most spiritual beasts could cultivate, not to mention the Violet Devourer Spirit Monkey which was a rare, top-tier spirit beast .Without disturbing the little violet monkey, Huang Xiaolong surveyed the surrounding valley and after determining that it was safe, he too sat down on the side and took out a piece of Yang fruit and swallowed it, running the Xuan Qin cultivation technique to absorb the fruit\u2019s energy .When the energy from the Yang fruit dispersed throughout Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body, multiple strands of Nine Yang energy almost instantly emerged . Nine Yang energy was the purest top-grade fire attribute spiritual energy in the world .Submerged inside the flow of the Nine Yang energy, Huang Xiaolong felt extremely comfortable and warm, as if he was soaking in a hot spring . The battle qi inside his meridians flowed rapidly .A few hours passed .Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes . After a few hours, he finally absorbed all the energy within that one Yang fruit and the battle qi within his body had become thicker by more than double, advancing his cultivation to late-Second Order warrior!According to his original estimation, in order to reach the late-Second Order he would need at least another month and a half, but he had now succeeded much quicker!Huang Xiaolong was happy with his achievement . Just as he thought that, a horrible smell assaulted his nose . Looking down, he saw his whole body covered with a layer of sticky, black mud . In his previous life, he had taken something similar to the Yang fruit, so he knew that this sticky, black mud was the impurities being forced out of his body .Huang Xiaolong jumped up feeling refreshingly lighter, then stretched his limbs for a little bit . He noticed the little violet monkey was still absorbing the Yang fruit\u2019s energy so he did not bother it and headed towards the lake in the middle of the grassy area .In front of the lake, he stripped naked and carefully set aside the remaining two Yang fruits . With a splash, he jumped into the lake to wash the layer of black impurities off his body .Very quickly, Huang Xiaolong cleaned himself up and was about to get out from the lake when he suddenly detected traces of a cold aura coming from the bottom of the lake . It was hard to notice when one was not paying attention . Huang Xiaolong\u2019s interest was stirred so he dove down into the lake .Diving a short distance, Huang Xiaolong saw a cave entrance not too far ahead where the cold aura was coming from .A short while later, he arrived at the hole entrance of the cave and entered without hesitation .Entering through the hole, he noticed the walls were dry and not slippery wet as one would imagine . On one side of the cave wall, there was a Water Dispersing Pearl the size of a goose egg embedded in it .If this pearl was taken out for an auction, its worth would exceed one hundred thousand gold coins .Huang Xiaolong couldn\u2019t help but be curious about this cave . Walking along the tunnel for about ten meters, he came to an empty hall about a hundred square meters wide yet it was obvious at a glance there was nothing inside the hall . There were three other rooms apart from the empty hall though . Huang Xiaolong walked towards the first room .In the first room, he gained nothing . It was empty, just like the hall outside .Huang Xiaolong moved on to the second room and it was also empty .\u201cF**k, don\u2019t tell me the third room is empty too?!\u201d \u00a0Huang Xiaolong couldn\u2019t help but exclaim to himself .Standing in front of the third room, Huang Xiaolong slowly peeked inside . \u00a0Finally, inside the third room there was a jade bed and on top of the jade bed was a book made from unknown materials . On the walls hung a pair of half-meter long black shiny blades .Pausing for a moment, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes fell on the book placed on top of the jade bed, so he walked over and picked it up . The seemingly thin book was so heavy that his arms sank under the weight, startling him . What material was this book made of that it weighed close to thirty pounds for something so thin?Looking at the book cover, there were three words written in ancient inscriptions: \u2018Asura Tactics\u2019 .At this exact moment, as if an explosion rang out, a terrifying aura of frenzied slaughter spread out in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s mind . His eyes flickered and he appeared in a place surrounded by infinite mountains of bones with a boundless sea of blood at its boundary .Standing on top of a mountain of bones, it was as if he was the embodiment of an Asura from Hell .Above the endless mountains of bones, ghastly apparitions of resentful spirits tried to \u2018invade\u2019 him . Feeling the countless ghastly, resentful spirits\u2019 desire to swallow him, a light flickered again in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes and he was back in the third room of the cave .Although it was only for a brief moment, cold sweat drenched his body .Looking with trepidation at the book in his hand titled Asura Tactics, the scene with the mountains of bones and boundless sea of blood did not appear again for a second time, allowing Huang Xiaolong to breathe out a heavy sigh of relief .A while later, repressing the shock in his heart, with slightly trembling hands he opened the first page of the Asura Tactics .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A humanoid illustration of an Asura standing upright with its upper body bared, revealing taut muscles, and a head of white hair .Studying the humanoid Asura illustration, a sensation of being in hell crept up his skin, mad slaughter and an endless sea of bodies awash Huang Xiaolong\u2019s senses, and his eyes turned blood-red; confused and in pain, Huang Xiaolong starts to lose his consciousness in the blood-thirst frenzy when suddenly behind him the double-headed serpent martial spirit appeared roaring towards the sky \u2013 a roar so thunderous that it shook the heaven . The red bloodlust slowly faded from his eyes as he regained his conscious . Waking up, his heart pounded like it was going to burst out from his chest .At this time, the humanoid Asura illustration flew out from the book page, in a bright flash, it entered between Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyebrows . Inside mind emerged the details of a cultivation technique .The first layer of Asura Tactics .\u201cThe Origin of Hell, the beginning of evil\u2026\u2026\u201d reciting the first layer of Asura Tactics\u2019s battle qi cultivation technique, Huang Xiaolong found it deeply profound and mysterious .In Martial Spirit World, battle qi cultivation techniques were categorized into four ranks, namely Heaven, Earth, Mysterious, and Yellow and each rank was further divided into different grades; low, mid and high-level .\u201cI wonder what rank is Asura Tactics cultivation technique?\u201dAfter a while, Huang Xiaolong turned to the second page . On it, there was another humanoid illustration of Asura, but this one was slightly different . On the second illustration of Asura\u2019s back was a pair of devilish black wings that spread open, exuding a domineering aura and a taste for massacre .Same as the previous page\u2019s experience, when he turned to the second page, an atmosphere that seemed originated from hell surrounded Huang Xiaolong and his double-headed serpent martial spirit once again appeared behind him, suppressing the blood-thirsty desire deluding Huang Xiaolong\u2019s consciousness and the second layer of Asura Tactics was successfully imprinted inside his mind .The third page, fourth page, fifth page\u2026Huang Xiaolong turned the pages one by one, with every page turned, inside his mind emerged another upper layer of Asura Tactics cultivation technique . As his page turning speed was slow, it took him more than two hours before he manage to reach the last page .One last page, instead of an illustration, a line of flamboyant calligraphy filled the page .\u201cEncumbered with Hell\u2019s aura of slaughter, the one receiving Asura Tactics is accepted as my pro-disciple, governing over Asura\u2019s Gate . When Asura appears, invincible throughout the world!\u201dThis line of words was left behind by the First Sovereign of Asura\u2019s Gate, Ren Wokuang .When Asura appears, invincible throughout the world!Huang Xiaolong was stunned! \u00a0This Asura Gate\u2019s First Sovereign, Ren Wokuang was a little too mad, right? \u00a0Between heaven and earth, who dared to declare themselves as invincible throughout the world, but this Ren Wokuang wrote after practicing Asura Tactics, he will be invincible against all?!A simple line of words, but it was extremely arrogant and domineering!At this time, a piece of paper fell out from the spine of the book . Apart from the piece of paper there was also a dark-colored ring . Surprised, Huang Xiaolong picked up both items from the ground .From the explanation written on the paper, he got to know that the ring was called the Asura ring, and the two sharp black blades hanging on the wall were called the Blades of Asura .What Huang Xiaolong did not expect was, the Asura ring was actually a spatial ring that only existed in legends; according to his father, in the whole of Luo Tong Kingdom, only the Emperor had one, even his grandfather Huang Qide didn\u2019t own one!The appearance of a spatial ring could cause bloody contention .Moments later, suppressing the excitement in his heart, Huang Xiaolong did according to the instruction stated, pricked his finger and dripped a drop of blood onto the Asura ring .When the drop of fresh blood fell, a bright light burst out from the dark-colored ring as it floated up and slipped onto Huang Xiaolong\u2019s ring finger on his left hand by itself; then it seemed to submerged into his body, disappearing from view . When Huang Xiaolong thought of it, it appeared again on his ring finger .Sensing the large space within Asura ring, Huang Xiaolong was delighted \u2013 it was more than a few hundred cubic meters wide and with this Asura Ring it would be more convenient for him to carry things around without having to worry about others finding out .After that, he turned around, gazing at the pair of shiny black blades on the wall and with a small leap he took down the pair of blades . The sabers\u2019 bodies seemed to emanate a strange buzz that could penetrate into people\u2019s minds, causing a cold prickly sensation that creeped people out .Huang Xiaolong examined the Blades of Asura in his hands, noticing on the bodies of the blades a black fiendish current flow faintly, indirectly forming blurred images of terrifying horror .The longer Huang Xiaolong held the Blades of Asura in hands, the fonder he grew of them .\u201cBlades of Asura, the blades of slaughter; great, from here onwards you will accompany me to slaughter all my enemies!\u201d Huang Xiaolong said as he caressed the ridge of the sabers . As if able to understand the meaning of his words, the blades issued a cheerful hum .Seeing this, Huang Xiaolong only grew fonder . Then, using the same method of recognizing owner, he dripped a few drops of blood onto the blades and as the drops of fresh blood meld, a blood-red light burst out from the blades as they hovered in the air, one flew to the left and the other to the right of Huang Xiaolong . On Huang Xiaolong\u2019s arms emerged two tiny tattoo-like Blades of Asura .Huang Xiaolong placed the piece of paper and Asura Tactics book into the Asura ring for safekeeping and prepared to leave the room, however, he paused just as he reached the door and turned back looking at the jade bed . He took the cold jade bed away too .Stepping out from the third room, Huang Xiaolong circled once around the cave . After confirming that he did not miss anything he walked to the exit . \u00a0He did not plan to remove the inlaid Water Dispersing Pearl at the cave\u2019s entrance, for he planned to use the cave in the future for his practice, for the cave\u2019s well-hidden location in the valley . That was the reason why he did not take the Water Dispersing Pearl, there were benefits to keeping this cave .Emerging from the lake, Huang Xiaolong swam to the side and put on his clothes, transferring the Yang fruits into his ring .\u201cHoo Hoo Haa\u201d Exactly at this moment, the little violet monkey had finished absorbing the spiritual energy from the Yang fruit came running towards Huang Xiaolong in a cheerful gait .Huang Xiaolong noticed that after absorbing two Yang fruits, the Spirit Devourer Violet Monkey\u2019s fur became glossier, and its eyes brighter, however, its body size remained the same .\u201cLittle guy, I have to go back now, I\u2019ll come to see you again . \u201d Huang Xiaolong leaned forwards and said to the little violet monkey .But, as he turned around to leave, the little violet monkey cried out and in a flash appeared on Huang Xiaolong\u2019s shoulder, perching comfortably .Huang Xiaolong was dazed for a moment, and jokingly said: \u201cLittle guy, don\u2019t tell me that you want to follow me home?\u201dUnexpectedly, the little violet monkey squeaked and nodded its little head .Huang Xiaolong did not expect that this little violet monkey will be willing to follow him home, after a brief consideration, he said with a smile: \u201cVery well, let\u2019s go . \u201d \u00a0A boy and a monkey departed from the valley .Passing through the green turf and the mountains of white bones, Huang Xiaolong wondered to himself \u201c Were all these people killed by Ren Wokuang ?\u201dLeaving the valley, HuangXiaolong did not take any detours, heading straight to Huang Clan Manor .By the time he reached Huang Clan Manor, it was already noon . Just as he stepped into his small courtyard, he ran into Huang Min, his little sister who had just stepped out from his small courtyard .\u201cBig Brother, where did you go?\u201d Huang Min asked, but it was only up till here, as her eyes widened in surprise when she saw the little violet monkey on Huang Xiaolong\u2019s shoulder . Clapping her hands gleefully, she almost shouted out loud: \u201cWhat a cute little monkey! Big brother, where did you buy it from?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Huang Xiaolong\u2019s heart tightened, quickly forging his mind and kept running Asura Tactics to refine the cold frigid energy .This cold frigid energy moves with extreme slowness inside Huang Xiaolong\u2019s meridians, every inch it passes Huang Xialong\u2019s blood were about to freeze up .Gritting his teeth, he kept persisting, running Asura Tactics first layer exercise law repeating over and over, gradually the cold frigid energy inside his body refined into pure battle qi .The moment the cold frigid energy successfully refined into battle qi, Huang Xiaolong realized that it only took half an hour\u2019s time, compared to XuanQin exercise law, the results were ten times better!This discovery is much to Huang Xiaolong\u2019s liking: \u201cLooks like what the note says is true, although the netherworld\u2019s spiritual energy is hard to refine but once successful the benefits are huge!\u201dThe note, kept in the spine of Asura Tactics mentioned that practicing Asura Tactics builds a connection with the netherworld\u2019s spiritual energy that tempers his physique . That cold frigid air without a doubt is the so-called netherworld\u2019s spiritual energy .Netherworld spiritual energy is one of the superior between heaven and earth, the higher the quality of spiritual energy the better it is to temper the physical body, the converted battle qi is purer and more powerful .This is the gap between exercise laws .The higher the rank of an exercise law, the quality of spiritual energy absorb is higher, the converted battle is stronger . In Martial Spirit World, the ones practicing high-rank exercise law are capable of leap-frog challenge opponents are due to this .Martial spirits determine a person\u2019s strength and future achievements, and the quality of exercise law practiced is equally important .Time flies and soon one month has passed .In this one month, apart from practicing Huang Xiaolong practices . The only difference is instead of XuanQin exercise law given to him by Huang Peng he is practicing Asura Tactics and the Body Metamorphose Scripture .After replacing his exercise law, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s practiced speed increased, one month after returning from the valley, he reached peak-Second Order, anytime soon he will be able to breakthrough to Third Order warrior .In the bewitching darkness, silvery moonlight streams down .Huang Xiaolong sat cross-legged on the cold jade bed, spiritual energy of the netherworld pours down from the void devoured by the double-headed serpent martial spirits with their jaws wide open .The battle qi within Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body kept swirling violently like raging waves crashing, the same way he felt when he was in peak-First Order breaking through to Second Order .However, breaking through to Third Order warrior is much harder, the resistance barrier is thicker, but Huang Xiaolong perseveres, his battle qi continue crashing against the barrier, not knowing how much time has lapsed when suddenly a minute crack appeared in the third-order barrier .Aware that the third-order barrier is loosening, Huang Xiaolong feels excited and starts to \u2018attack\u2019 the barrier more aggressively, the barrier\u2019s minute crack grew bigger when finally a sound of explosion resounded within Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body .Like a flash flood, battle qi rushes into the third layer meridians in triumphant .Third Order! Finally broke through to the Third Order warrior .Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes, unable to hide the jubilation in his heart .Once breakthrough Third-Order, then Fourth Order is not far away!\u201cIf advances to Fourth Order then can start practicing battle skills, and once he reaches Fourth Order the martial spirits will evolve, at that time there will be a martial spirits innate talent!\u201d\u00a0Huang Xiaolong thought inwardly .At age seven martial spirits awakens, however, the awaken martial spirits is just in its infancy, only when battle qi reaches the Fourth Order the martial spirits will evolve to become stronger while the owner of the martial spirits will gain the martial spirits innate talent ability or skills .The higher the grade of the martial spirits, the innate talent after evolving will be more powerful!But the Fourth Order is only a general indication there are some with low-level martial spirits grade one, two and three due to the martial spirits natural limit, without some fortuitous adventure, breaking through to Fourth Order will be a tedious challenge . That\u2019s why some people with low-level martial spirits never gained a martial spirits innate talent in their lifetime, for they are unable to reach the Fourth Order thus their martial spirits are unable to go through evolution .Getting down from the cold jade bed, Huang Xiaolong left his room .At this time of the night, the air is foggy, under the moonlight Huang Xiaolong\u2019s silhouette disappeared in a flash, appearing again in the back mountain . Running Asura Tactics, his eyes turned a color of blood-red and his jet-black hair fully turned white, black aura of slaughter rotates around his body constantly .This physique attained after practicing Asura Tactics \u2013 Body of Asura, but this is only the initial stage transformation, according to the explanation on the piece of note, once Huang Xiaolong mastered the highest level of Asura Tactics then he can transform into a real Asura .After transforming into Body of Asura, Huang Xiaolong movement under the moonlight is akin to a floating black cloud, waving his hands suddenly a palm containing traces of frigid air strikes towards a huge tree ahead, pierces through coming out from the other end of the tree trunk, into a second and a third tree .On four trunks of the tree were embed with a child\u2019s palm print .Looking at the four palm print on the tree trunks, Huang Xiaolong nodded his head in satisfaction . Entering the Third Order combined with the nether battle qi, the damage power of Ethereal Palm increased about four times and with his current strength, he is capable of killing a late-Third Order warrior .Of course, after advancing to Third Order and the tempering from the netherworld spiritual aura, Huang Xiaolong physique is more developed and stronger .Spending some time to practice The Body Metamorphose Scripture in the back mountain, Huang Xiaolong only returned to Huang Clan Manor when the sky brightens .Once back in Huang Clan Manor, Huang Xiaolong was called to the Eastern Courtyard hall by Huang Peng .\u201cDad, Mom, you were looking for me?\u201d Entering the Eastern Courtyard\u2019s hall, Huang Xiaolong asked as he sat down .Huang Peng and Su Yan looked complicated and hesitant .\u201cYesterday, Huang Wei advanced to First Order warrior . \u201d Huang Peng eventually opened his mouth and said .Only then Huang Xiaolong understood his parents\u2019 purpose in calling him over, in short they are still worried about the year end\u2019s Clan Assembly .But, less than two months\u2019 time Huang Wei actually advanced to First Order, so fast?! Logically speaking, even though Huang Wei possesses a grade ten martial spirits, the Three-Eyed Black Tiger, it\u2019s still impossible to advance to First Order in such short time .\u201cDad spent a huge sum of money in the county\u2019s auction house to procure a stalk thousand years Leirion Heart Grass!\u201d Huang Peng went on to say .A thousand years Leirion Heart Grass!Huang\u00a0Xiaolong was shocked then he sneered, no wonder in less than two months\u2019 time Huang Wei was able to advance to First Order warrior . It is all due to Grandfather Huang Qide spending a huge sum of money to get a thousand-year-old Leirion Heart Grass for Huang Wei\u2019s practice . One stalk of one thousand-year-old Leirion Heart Grass is not something cheap, and it\u2019s obvious enough that Grandfather Huang Qide thinks Huang Wei is the future pillar of Huang Clan Manor, thus spending all resource and effort to culture him . Whereas him though being a grandson to the same person, disregarding the Leirion Heart Grass, Huang Xiaolong did not even get a battle qi dan!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A thought flashed through Huang Peng and Su Yan\u2019s mind, First Order warrior! Only when reaching First Order warrior one can project battle qi outside the body even if successfully condensing battle qi are unable to project battle qi outwards .\u201cXiaolong you, could it be that you have advanced to First Order?\u201d Huang Peng asked in a trembling voice, although he witnessed it with his own eyes he dares not believe for it might turn out to be an illusion .\u201cThat\u2019s right, Dad, Mom, I have already advanced to First Order!\u201d Huang Xiaolong nodded, he does not wish to see his parents continue to worry about matters related to the Clan Assembly that he decided to reveal part of his strength .Hearing their son\u2019s confirmation, Huang Peng and Su Yan finally believes the truth in front of them . Joy took over their faces, especially Su Yan after going through surprise and excitement she ran over and hugged Huang Xiaolong tightly: \u201cWonderful, my son finally advanced to First Order!\u2019Tears of joy rolled down Su Yan\u2019s face .Su Yan\u2019s is quite voluptuous a woman, being hugged so tightly Huang Xiaolong feels like he was about to suffocate, he finally managed to break free with much difficulty . \u00a0It is only the First Order, is it necessary to make such a big fuss?\u00a0Huang Xiaolong thought dejectedly in his heart .However, he can truly feel the love Huang Peng and Su Yan have for him .Huang Peng and Su Yan gradually calmed down from their joy and excitement after some time .\u201cXiaolong, how did you advance to First Order?\u201d Huang Peng voiced out the doubt in his heart, with Huang Xiaolong grade seven martial spirits talent to advance to First Order would take at least a year or so .Su Yan also turned to look questioningly at her son obviously she too has some doubts .Instead of speaking, Huang Xiaolong withdrew two bright red fruit from his chest under the astonished gaze of Huang Peng and Su Yan .The bright redness of the fruit bedazzles people .\u201cThis, this is Yang fruit?!\u201d Huang Peng and Su Yan exclaimed in surprised\u201cYes . \u201d Huang Xiaolong laughed . \u201cOne month ago, I accidentally found it in a valley at the back mountain, there were five fruits in total, and I swallowed three of them . \u201dThere was in truth five pieces of Yang fruit in the beginning, but Huang Xiaolong only took one .\u201cSwallowed three fruits!\u201d Huang Peng and Su Yan looked at each other . They finally understood the \u2018real reason\u2019 their son advanced to First Order .\u201cGood! Haha, Xiaolong unexpectedly you have such good fortune . Yang fruit is a wonder fruit, its benefits are no less compared to the Leirion Heart Grass that your Grandfather bought for Huang Wei . \u201d Huang Peng laughed merrily: \u201cIt is also beneficial to your future cultivation . \u201dEven Su Yan is smiling from ear to ear .\u201cDad, Mom, these two pieces Yang fruit, each of you swallows one and cultivate . \u201d Huang Xiaolong said .Huang Peng and Su Yan\u2019s smile stiffened on their faces and was about to refuse when Huang Xiaolong interrupted: \u201cI have already taken three fruits, any more will only waste it and will not bring more benefits to me . It is better if Dad and Mom take it . \u201dHuang Peng and Su Yan no longer say anything .Moments later, Huang Peng nodded his head in agreement: \u201cFine . \u201d Taking the two pieces of Yang fruit from Huang Xiaolong\u2019s hand, he inhaled deeply looking at them, making an effort to suppress the excitement in his heart . He\u2019s stuck at late-Sixth Order for more than a year, with this piece of Yang fruit he\u2019s able to breakthrough to peak-Sixth Order in two months\u2019 time .In truth, he really does need this piece of Yang fruit .Looking at the Yang fruit in her palm, Su Yan\u2019s expression differs not from Huang Peng\u2019s, with this piece of Yang fruit there is hope for her to advance to Sixth order .\u201cXiaolong, about your breakthrough to First Order, for the time being don\u2019t let others know . \u201d Huang Peng said to his son after regaining some clarity, continues: \u201cAlthough you breakthrough to First Order after swallowing Yang fruit, you still need to make an effort in your practice, strive to reach mid-First Order by the end of the year . \u201dIn Huang Peng\u2019s opinion, as long as his son breakthrough to mid-First Order even if Huang Wei is late-First Order at that time, to cripple both of his son\u2019s hands is difficult .The gap between mid-First Order and late-First Order is negligible .\u201cDad, Mom, rest assure that I will not disappoint you . \u201d Huang Xiaolong said .Huang Peng and Su Yan were comforted with those words .A short while later Huang Xiaolong left the Eastern Courtyard hall back to his small courtyard, and directly went into practice mode . After advancing to Third Oder, the double-headed martial spirits speed absorbing netherworld spiritual aura has again increased, the battle qi inside his body grew ever more powerful .Almost on every other day basis, the battle qi inside his body becomes thicker and more powerful .The small courtyard Huang Xiaolong resides in is located at the easternmost part of Huang Clan Manor, that\u2019s why apart from his parents and his sister Huang Min, rarely any people passes by which is all the more convenient for Huang Xiaolong to practice .With Huang Xiaolong practicing in a crazed manner regardless day or night, his battle qi and internal force increased exponentially .Peak early-Third Order, mid-Third Order, peak mid-Third Order, late-Third Order!By the time three months have passed, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s battle qi has reached peak late-Third Order, at any moment he can breakthrough to Fourth Order, and there is only less than two weeks till end of the year\u2019s Clan Assembly .However, Fourth Order is a dividing line, the fourth order\u2019s barrier is much thicker compared to the previous second and third order, the difficulty is incomparable .In Huang Clan Manor there are disciples possessing grade seven martial spirits stuck at peak late-Third Order more than two years unable to breakthrough to Fourth Order, even those possessing grade eight martial spirits spends more than one year\u2019s at peak Late-Third Order before advancing further .Two weeks passed quickly .With the approaching Clan Assembly, Huang Clan Manor is in a lively, festive atmosphere because two days after the Clan Assembly will the New Year Festival, the entire Huang Clan Manor was decorated lavishly . In contrast with the rest of the Huang Clan Manor, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s small courtyard seemed gloomy and lonely, only silence .\u201cTomorrow\u2019s the annual Clan Assembly . \u201d Huang Xiaolong left his room after more than a dozen days of hard penance, eventually countering bottleneck at peak late-Third Order the looks of it, it will take a while before he can cross over to Fourth Order .Huang Xiaolong walked out from the small courtyard .\u201cTomorrow\u2019s the Clan Annual Assembly, did you hear, this time Old Manor Lord will make an appearance!\u201d\u201cThis year is Young Lord Huang Wei first time participating in the Clan Assembly after awakening his martial spirits, of course Old Manor Lord will be joining the gathering .

In truth with regards to Huang Wei, Huang Xiaolong truly is not bothered .Releasing the double-headed serpent martial spirits floating behind him, Huang Xiaolong can clearly sense how powerful his martial spirits are after advancing to Third Order and him being the only person able to sense it .\u201cLooks like I need to make a trip to the library to see if I can find out about my martial spirits . \u201d Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself .However, Huang Clan Manor\u2019s library only allows those who had reached Fourth Order to enter that\u2019s why he needs to breakthrough to Fourth Order as soon as possible .The moonlight stretches Huang Xiaolong\u2019s small shadow on the ground .Darkness gradually fades as the light brightens the sky, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s figure dashed, heading back to Huang Clan Manor .\u201cThe Clan\u2019s Annual Assembly finally begins!\u201dClan\u2019s Annual Assembly is about to begin .Back to Huang Clan Manor, he moved straight towards the Eastern Courtyard .

Sitting down, Huang Xiaolong sense there is a cold gaze staring at him, raising his head to find the source, he saw Huang Wei who was sitting opposite .At this moment, their eyes met \u2013 Huang Wei\u2019s gaze was arrogant, condescending, provoking and complacent .Sitting beside Huang Wei is Huang Ming, forever with his deadpan expressionless face . As Huang Peng sat down, he did not greet Huang Ming . Since the Northern Courtyard incident the two of them no longer speak to each other,\u00a0from brothers to strangers traveling on the same path .Not long after the three of them arrived, from the outer hall a hearty laugh rang out, hearing the sound of laughter everyone inside the hall quickly stand up . Looking over Huang Xiaolong saw his Grandfather Huang Qide, walking into the hall with a face full of laughter and next to his grandfather is a high-spirited old man with a head full of silvery white hair about the same age Huang Xiaolong immediately knows this is Old Patriarch Li, Li Mu .

Acting so arrogant without any real strength, I don\u2019t like children like this!\u201dHuang Qide felt his old face\u00a0lost some shine, giving an embarrassed laugh his gaze swept towards Huang Peng,\u00a0seems like it would do well to remind his second son to discipline his son well, in order to prevent future troubles during important occasions lest he shames the clan with his ignorance .Huang Wei chuckled loudly: \u201cWhat did you say? Did I get it wrong? You want to hit me until my Dad can\u2019t recognize me?\u201dJust as his words finished, a silhouette flashed shocking Huang Wei, right in front of his shock-widened eyes a gigantic looking fist sock into his left eye .Sadly, it was too late for him to dodge, when he was about to speak the gigantic looking fist slammed into his left eye causing him to wailed loudly in pain, staggering back, golden stars spinning in his eyes .The laughs and ridicules around the martial stage from relatives of Huang Clan Manor aiming at Huang Xiaolong instantly died, dumbfounded eyes staring at Huang Wei who was bawling in pain on the martial stage .At this moment, frowning, Li Mu said: \u201cSuch a small age yet already learned how to sneak attack, when he grows up definitely is a sinister villain . \u201dLooking at Huang Xiaolong, Huang Qide\u2019s brows also creased into a furrow .\u201cYou, you dare to hit me?\u201d On the stage, Huang Wei raged furiously at Huang Xiaolong, his left hand no longer covering his left eye, revealing a black circle on the left eye just like a panda .Huang Xiaolong did not say anything as his silhouette flashed a second time, appearing right in front of Huang Wei, a fist aiming at his eye on the right side .\u201cBoom!\u201dThe second punch hits the mark!Huang Wei screamed at the top of his lungs .Looking at Huang Wei\u2019s panda eyes, Li Lu who was sitting beside Grandfather Li Mu could no longer control her laughter, a charming laugh resounded in the Main Foyer; two lovely dimples etched on her face .Li Mu turned and gave his granddaughter a stern eye .Li Lu tried her utmost to hold in her bubbling laughter, and her strenuous effort shows clearly on her lovely face .Below the stage, everyone had a weird expression on their face .\u201cHuang Xiaolong, I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d Huang Wei\u2019s fury finally erupted as he roared loudly, releasing his battle qi and a punch aimed straight towards Huang Xiaolong\u2019s chest .Seeing Huang Wei\u2019s fist about to hit upon Huang Xiaolong\u2019 chest, Huang Peng and Su Yan\u2019s heart misses a beat, exclaimed aloud in worry .

No wonder he has been acting as if there\u2019s nothing to fear!Huang Wei finally came to his sense after being pushed back by Huang Xiaolong, lashing out angrily: \u201cImpossible, this is not possible; it\u2019s impossible that you too advanced to peak late-First Order!\u201dHe possessed grade ten martial spirits, a son of Heaven, and taken a thousand-year-old Leirion Heart Grass plus five months of hard effort only manage to breakthrough to peak late-First Order!What about Huang Xiaolong? He\u2019s only a seven grade martial spirits!Huang Qide, Huang Ming, and the others were thinking the same thing as Huang Wei .At this moment, Huang Peng went up to Huang Qide, explained: \u201cDad, four months ago, Xiaolong found five pieces of Yang fruit in a valley at the back mountain . \u201d\u201cWhat? Yang fruit?!\u201d Huang Qide and the others were greatly surprised .\u201cYes, Xiaolong swallowed three pieces, the remaining two was given to Su Yan and me . I\u2019m now a peak late-Sixth Order!\u201d Huang Peng nodded and released his battle qi of peak late-Sixth Order .\u201cSwallowed three pieces of Yang fruit to cultivate . \u201d Huang Qide looked speechlessly Huang Xiaolong on the stage for words fail him .Everyone present was made known the \u2018real reason\u2019 of Huang Xiaolong\u2019s breakthrough to peak late-First Order .Three pieces of Yang fruit ah!Each piece of fruit is comparable to a stalk of Leirion Heart Grass .\u201cDidn\u2019t expect Xiaolong to have such good fortune, this is a good thing . \u201d Huang Qide gave a small laugh, awkwardly .If these three pieces of Yang fruit is given to Huang Wei instead, he would have advanced to Second Order!\u00a0Huang Qide thinks to himself inwardly .Even Li Mu, who was sitting next to Huang Qide thinks the act of Huang Xiaolong absorbing three pieces of Yang fruit is abominable .Gradually everyone recovered from their shock and slowly seated down .On the stage, Huang Wei filled with jealousy, hatefully fixed his glare at Huang Xiaolong: \u201cI say, so you ran into some dog shit luck and swallowed three pieces of Yang fruit, thus breakthrough to peak late-First Order!\u201dSmirking, Huang Xiaolong said: \u201cSo to say, the reason you advanced to peak late-First Order is not due to the thousand-year-old Leirion Heart Grass?\u201dHuang Wei\u2019s face was red with shame, rushes forward without any warning, directing a fist at Huang Xiaolong . Huang Xiaolong unhurriedly lifts his fists and punched out directly at Huang Wei\u2019s incoming fist, pushing Huang Wei back he then leaps up extending a kick on Huang Wei\u2019s stomach, and just like the Zhou Xuedong from a few months earlier Huang Wei flew back screaming in the shape of a bow \u2013 it was seven to eight meters before he finally stops .Clutching his stomach, Huang Wei felt as if all of his internal organs shifted positions, tears rolling down from the corner of his eyes due to extreme pain .Huang Xiaolong came up in front of Huang Wei, snickered and said: \u201cFive months ago didn\u2019t you say that you will cripple both of my arms during the Clan\u2019s Assembly?\u201d A foot stamped on Huang Wei\u2019s face as soon as the words were out .Another miserable cry came out of Huang Wei .Cripple both arms? On the main podium, a frowning Huang Qide turned to look at his eldest son, Huang Ming for he\u2019s unaware of this matter . Faltering under his father\u2019s questioning eyes, Huang Ming shrinks his neck, tries to hide away .At this time, Huang Wei\u2019s miserable cry rang out again, turning over to look, Huang Qide saw Huang Xiaolong tromping another foot on Huang Wei\u2019s face . Opening his mouth wanting to stop Huang Xiaolong, the question his grandson asked earlier ran across his mind if others are allowed to interrupt during the sparring event? Unwillingly kept his mouth, with a trace of bitterness in his heart, at last, he understood the purpose of his grandson\u2019s question .All in all, Huang Xiaolong kicked three times . Huang Wei\u2019s original face which could be considered as above average finally got turned into a pig-head . Seeing that his son was beaten up till unrecognizable Huang Ming clenches his fists tightly, his usual deadpan expression replaced with fury and a cold, sharp light glimmered in his eyes .\u201cAhh~!\u201d Three continuous kicks from Huang Xiaolong drove Huang Wei berserk just like a crazed beast, issuing a loud a roar, battle qi around his body rose alarmingly, a different aura rushed out from Huang Wei\u2019s body .This sudden change rendered everyone in a dazed, eyes staring widely .Sensing the abrupt change in his son\u2019s, Huang Ming\u2019s expression of fury melted into ecstasy .\u201cYoung Lord Huang Wei breakthrough!\u2019\u201cSecond Order, this is Second Order\u2019s atmosphere!\u201dSome of the elders of Huang Clan Manor couldn\u2019t help but exclaim out loud .Second Order!With the sudden surge of battle qi around Huang Wei\u2019s body who breakthrough to Second Order, Huang Peng and Su Yan are once again on tenterhooks,\u00a0Huang Wei breakthrough to Second Order, does this mean\u2026?\u201cGood, good!\u201d Huang Qide exclaimed in joy seeing his grandson Huang Wei, laughing loudly . Huang Wei unexpectedly advanced to Second Order during this year\u2019s Clan Assembly, truly a pleasant surprise a!Retreating a few steps back, looking at the newly breakthrough Huang Wei, Huang Xiaolong too were slightly taken by surprise .\u201cSecond Order Warrior eh . \u201d Huang Xiaolong\u2019 expression was placid .At this moment, Huang Wei slowly stood up from the ground, both eye blood-red murderously staring at Huang Xiaolong, sensing an increase of power and battle qi within his body, emphasizing every word: \u201cIn a while, I want you to kneel down and lick my toes!\u201d Only this way is able to wash away his earlier humiliation and disgrace .\u201cReally?\u201d Huang Xiaolong replied with indifference .Screaming in rage, he instantly arrived in front of Huang Xiaolong both fists beaming with battle qi punching towards Huang Xiaolong . After advancing to Second Order not only his power has increased even his speed increased tremendously .With their hearts in their mouth, Huang Peng and Su Yan was about to exclaim aloud, suddenly, Huang Xiaolong which was standing on the stage raises both of his fists as battle qi swirls around him, once again colliding straight against Huang Wei\u2019s fists .\u201cBang!\u2019 A louder noise resounded as Huang Wei\u2019s figure flew backward .\u201cWhat?! Impossible, how could this be?\u201d\u201cSecond Order Warrior! A Second Order warrior\u2019s battle qi energy!\u201dThose Huang Clan Manor elders and housekeepers who just sat back in their places just moments ago once again stood up in shock, a look of disbelieve on their faces as they stare at Huang Xiaolong, eyes almost dropping out from their sockets .Both Huang Qide and Li Mu also stood up, eyes wide in shock .This, what the f*ck is this? Isn\u2019t this guy\u2019s dog shit luck a little too strong!Huang Qide turned his head around to look at his son Huang Peng, whereas the doubly shocked Huang Peng said bitterly with a wry smile: \u201cDad, about this, I\u2019m also in the dark . \u201d Son oh son, his son really made him worry too much! Never in his wildest dreams would he expect that his son\u2019s real strength isn't peak late-First Order but Second Order .Second Order, Second Order! As he looks at his son on the stage, his body trembled with excitement, at this moment he has an impulsive to rush up the stage to hug his son tightly and cry .A surge of pride emerged from within Huang Peng\u2019s heart this young boy who only cultivated five months to reach Second Order is his son, his Huang Peng\u2019s son!Su Yan stood rooted to the spot with her eyes slightly red and her expression is the same as her husband\u2019s .\u201cNo, cannot be, this can\u2019t be true, this isn\u2019t true!\u201d On the stage, Huang Wei screamed like he\u2019s gone crazy, staring fixedly at Huang Xiaolong, shaking his head in denial .Notes:1 .

Seeing the increasingly near Huang Xiaolong, Huang Wei who was muttering and screaming insanely suddenly stopped . Fear crept up his eyes as he subconsciously steps back, however just when he open his mouth wanting to admit defeat, a shadow blurred and Huang Xiaolong\u2019s fists slammed directly in his face . Huang Wei cried out miserably and staggered backward .Taking advantage of the initial punch hitting the mark, Huang Xiaolong moved closer, serving another punch .After several punches, Huang Wei was already confused and disoriented unable to tell east, west, north or south . His face turned into an even bigger into pig head .Watching his son\u2019s pitiful end, Huang Ming who was below the stage finally couldn't hold it in any longer, turn to his father Huang Qide and said: \u201cDad, you see, shouldn\u2019t we\u2026?\u201dHesitated for a moment, Huang Qide said: \u201cThat\u2019s enough, Xiaolong . \u201dAs he heard his Grandfather Huang Qide\u2019s voice, Huang Xiaolong exert a final heavy punch before stopping .\u201cYou!\u201d Huang Ming stared angrily .Ignoring Huang Ming\u2019s angry stare and said: \u201cEldest Uncle, nephew had a slipped of hand, please forgive me!\u201dSlipped of hand?Looking at Huang Wei whose had turned into a pig head, everyone had a weird expression on their faces .Li Lu sitting beside Li Mu could no longer keep her laughter down and a sweet sound of laugh resonated through the hall a second time .Huang Qide\u2019s brows furrowed as he looked at Huang Xiaolong on the stage, opened his mouth but in the end did not say anything, he could tell that Huang Xiaolong was already lenient and Huang Wei\u2019s injuries are just flesh wound .Huang Ming on the other hand, almost spit out blood from anger .At this moment, Huang Wei\u2019s voice resurfaced woefully sobbing, walking to Huang Ming\u2019s side: \u201cDad, he hit me, he really hit me!\u201d His finger pointed at Huang Xiaolong, tears, and snots streaming down his face .In the end, Huang Wei is just a seven-year-old child, being walloped by Huang Xiaolong, ended with a face that no longer seems human .The elders and housekeepers of Huang Clan Manor shake their heads making Huang Ming extremely embarrassed .This round\u2019s sparring between Huang Wei and Huang Xiaolong end with Huang Wei looking like a pig head . The assembly continues with other disciples\u2019 sparring .But, compared to the excitement during the fight between Huang Wei and Huang Xiaolong, the subsequent sparring was lackluster .A few hours later, the annual Clan Assembly comes to an end .As everyone leaves, sighing incessantly inside their hearts, the supposed star of this year\u2019s Clan Assembly ended up as a joke whereas Huang Xiaolong, whom no one has ever paid any attention to became the most dazzling presence .Northern Courtyard .In the main hall, Huang Wei roared furiously: \u201cIf not for that Huang Xiaolong running into some dog shit luck swallowing three Yang fruits, just base on his martial spirits talent no way he\u2019ll be able to breakthrough to Second Order! I refused to accept . Huang Xiaolong, I\u2019ll pay you back for this during next year\u2019s Clan Assembly, I\u2019ll definitely have my revenge . \u00a0This humiliation I will return it to you a hundred times over!\u201d His face, which was beaten up to resemble a pig-head, was grim and twisted with anger .Huang Ming sat there, expressionless but from time to time, a sharp cold gleam flitted across his eyes .This year\u2019s Clan Assembly, Huang Xiaolong made him lost face, totally .Unlike the Northern Courtyard\u2019s gloom, the Eastern Courtyard was fill with laughter and cheer .\u201cGood son, this time, you did not disappoint your Dad!\u201d letting out a big laugh, Huang Peng said: \u201cRefreshing, too refreshing!\u201d Thinking of his elder brother Huang Ming\u2019s furious expression on his deadpan face, his heart beamed with delight .\u201cXiaolong, come, let Mom look at you carefully . \u201d Su Yan pulled Huang Xiaolong in front of her, scrutinizing, smiled and said: \u201cYou ah, never told us you break through to Second Order, made Mon and Dad worried so much for so long . \u201dNot knowing what to say, Huang Xiaolong only smiled .If his parents were to find out that he actually isn\u2019t Second Order Warrior, wonder what reaction will they have? But Huang Xiaolong decided to keep his strength a secret if his Third Order battle qi strength were exposed, the coming troubles might not be so simple .His current strength being Second Order can be explained away using three Yang fruits as an excuse but a peak late-Third Order will raise suspicions, and if others know his martial spirits being super martial spirits, it might bring about a genocide catastrophe upon Huang Clan Manor .In the eastern main hall, after being \u2018nagged\u2019 by his parents for some time, at last, Huang Xiaolong returned to his small courtyard .As soon as he entered, a small figure rushed into his arms, Huang Xiaolong did not dodge but smile and said: \u201cLittle guy, where did you run off to these two days?\u201dThis little figure happens to be the Violet Devourer Spirit Monkey .Half a year has passed the little Violet Devourer Spirit Monkey\u2019s body did not change much, apart from his eyes being more astute, the pupils a dazzling bright ice blue .\u201cZhi Zhi Zhi!\u201d The little violet monkey shifted to Huang Xiaolong\u2019s shoulder, squeaking and gesturing .\u201cYou\u2019re saying, you want me to make a trip to the back mountain with you?\u201d Huang Xiaolong asked, accompanied by this little violet monkey for half a year\u2019s time, Huang Xiaolong generally can understand the little monkey\u2019s body language .\u201cZhi Zhi Zhi!\u201d Delight etched on the little monkey\u2019s face as it quickly nodded .\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go!\u201d Huang Xiaolong nodded his head in agreement for there\u2019s nothing much going on at the moment . Exiting Huang Clan Manor with the little violet monkey, they arrive at a hilly area under the guidance of the little violet monkey; in front, there\u2019s a python more than ten meters long appeared . A huge Bara Floret Python! Huang Xiaolong involuntarily inhaled a breath of cold air looking at the huge Bara Floret Python, the reason the little violet bringing him here finally dawned on him, he\u2019s here to deal with the obstacle!Noticing Huang Xiaolong and the little violet monkey, the Bara Floret Python suddenly raise its head, both eyes stared Huang Xiaolong and the little monkey, its long tongue flicks out once and instantly rushed out .Huang Xiaolong looked dignified he could tell the Bara Floret Python is a stage four wicked beast, although only a stage four but for a peak late-Third Order Huang Xiaolong it is still considered high risk .Dodging the Bara Floret Python\u2019s first attack, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s silhouette skirted to the side, and the little violet monkey on his shoulder leaped up in the air, landing atop the python\u2019s head, two monkey\u2019s paws strikes down .Receiving a hit on the head, the Bara Floret Python uttered a loud cry due to the pain; with a twist of its long body, its mouth stretched deadly wide wanting to swallow the little violet monkey . Huang Xiaolong\u2019s heart missed a beat but exactly at this moment, the little violet monkey swerved a few meters off course right in mid-air, just barely brushing past the python\u2019s opened jaw, allowing Huang Xiaolong to let out a breath of relief .Running Asura Tactics, black threads aura, carrying an atmosphere of slaughter emerged, swirls rapidly forming a layer around Huang Xiaolong \u2013 his eyes turned blood-red and hair wholly white . Huang Xiaolong did not attack immediately instead stood on one side, blood-red eyes never leaving the Bara Floret Python which is battling with the Violet Devourer Spirit Monkey at the moment .Just when the python was about to twist its body around, suddenly Huang Xiaolong who has been standing on one side made his move, from far away his body looked like a group of black clouds under the sun as he flew up . Unawarely, Blades of Asura appeared in his hands as he appeared below the Bara Floret Python head and with a wave of his hands, two black rays of light whizzed past .A screamed escaped its mouth, fresh blood bursting like a geyser as the Bara Flower Python\u2019s head fell rolling the ground, coming to a complete stop only after moments later .His eyes and hair gradually revert to its original state, and Huang Xiaolong retrieves the blades back into his arms, walking past with the little violet monkey .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Huang Xiaolong eyes shined brightly, thinking\u00a0this is a fourth-grade Bara Floret Python\u2019s gall is an excellent nourishment, swallowing it not only can enhance one\u2019s battle qi cultivation but also strengthened the body!After digging out the snake gall, the Violet Devourer Spirit Monkey gave it to Huang Xiaolong with a cheeky grin, then he opened his mouth and swallowed the beast core .\u201cYou ate it?\u201d Huang Xiaolong was shocked .A wicked beast\u2019s beast core is concentrated with its element, but this concentrated element isn\u2019t pure . It can only be swallowed after it is refined with other elixirs into pills if a practitioner swallows a beast core directly will die from bursting due to the violent beast element within the core .But the little monkey\u2019s still fine after swallowing the beast core!Looking at the little monkey act Huang Xiaolong is speechless . A moment later, he turned to look at the Bara Floret Python\u2019s corpse, after a short consideration he left the body as is and walked away with the little violet monkey back to Huang Clan Manor .Back to Huang Clan Manor, Huang Xiaolong instructed one of the guards to buy some wine, which he mixed the snake gall in; and he gulped the whole jug of wine down his throat .Once the wine hits the belly, a raw energy emerges, immediately replaced by a warm current spreading throughout its body .Huang Xiaolong immediately runs Asura Tactics to refine the snake gall\u2019s energies .One night passed .When he woke up, there\u2019s a hint of delight in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eye, from last night\u2019s practice his battle qi has increased a lot; one snake gall is equivalent to one month\u2019s hard penance .There\u2019s a gut feeling, in these few days he will break through to Fourth Order!The obstacle to reaching Fourth Order has become thinner thus he could breakthrough at any time . Standing up from the cold jade bed, just after he kept it back into Asura Ring, he heard his sister, Huang Min\u2019s voice calling from outside the courtyard: \u201cBig Brother, Big Brother!\u201dHuang Xiaolong is slightly baffled, the sun just rises and already this little girl ran over to look for him; not knowing what has happened, Huang Xiaolong walked out from his room .\u201cBig Brother, Dad and MoM want you to head over to the Main Hall . \u201d Huang Min came into the courtyard and said .\u201cTo the Main Hall?\u201d Doubt crossed Huang Xiaolong\u2019s mind, only important matters involving the Clan are discussed in the Main Hall .Stepping out from the small courtyard, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the Main Hall; he noticed his parents are already there, also Eldest Uncle Huang Ming, Huang Wei including the elders of Huang Clan Manor .When Huang Xiaolong stepped into the hall, gazes of different meaning were directed at him, and Huang Wei looked at him with venomous eyes .\u201cDad, Mom . \u201d Huang Xiaolong came beside Huang Peng and Su Yan then sat down .Huang Peng and Su Yan nodded at their son, face full of smile looking at their child .Huang Qide and Li Mu walked into the Main Hall at this moment; beside Li Mu is his granddaughter, Li Lu . Seeing Li Mu and Li Lu are also present, Huang Xiaolong already could guess the reason .As expected, after Grandfather Huang Qide took his seat, gave a cursory glance at those present in the Main Hall, smile and said: \u201cI requested everyone here is to inform everyone one matter, in the future our Huang Clan Manor and the Li family will be in-laws . \u201d\u201cBecome in-laws . \u201d The Main Hall broke into small commotions but they\u2019re not exactly surprised with the news for it was already leaked out earlier .Huang Wei was thrilled when he heard this, and at this time, Huang Qide continued: \u201cThat\u2019s right, an engagement between Huang Clan Manor\u2019s Huang Wei with Li Family\u2019s Miss Li Lu .All the elders immediately stood up to congratulate: \u201cCongratulations, Old Manor Lord!\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t agree!\u201d Suddenly a voice spoke out; it was so unexpected that everyone was astonished, looking at the source of the voice; it turned out to be Li Lu who was sitting beside Li Mu .\u201cLu\u2019er, you!\u201d Li Mu was about to admonish her, but was interrupted by Li Lu: \u201cNo Grandfather, I don\u2019t like this Huang Wei!\u201d As she said this, her head turned, and a finger pointed at Huang Xiaolong: \u201cI like him, if I\u2019m to be engaged, I want to be engaged to him!\u201dDead silence conquered the Main Hall .There\u2019s a look of expectancy on everyone\u2019s face .Whereas the smiles that blossomed on Huang Ming and Huang Wei\u2019s wilted uglily, stunned speechless by the words coming out of Li Lu\u2019s mouth; especially Huang Wei, his face turned red then darken plum-purple . His gaze fell upon Huang Xiaolong, wishing he could swallow Huang Xiaolong alive .Huang Xiaolong himself was stunned, staring at the little pointing at him, trying to rope him in .\u201cNonsense!\u201d Recovering his sense, Li Mu reprimanded .Li Lu\u2019s small mouth pouted, determinedly said: \u201cGrandfather, I\u2019m not saying nonsense, I\u2019m telling the truth; I like him!\u201d Looking at Huang Xiaolong, she continued: \u201cHe look so cool beating people up!\u201dHearing that sentence, everyone present isn\u2019t sure whether to laugh to cry, just because\u00a0 during the Clan Assembly yesterday Huang Xiaolong looks cool beating up Huang Wei thus this Li Lu \u2018likes\u2019 Huang Xiaolong, and will not marry anyone but Huang Xiaolong?Li Mu found the situation extremely embarrassing, but no matter how he admonished Li Lu, she just wouldn\u2019t change her mind; insisting on Huang Xiaolong instead on Huang Wei .\u201cBrother Qide, this\u2026\u201d In the end, he faced Huang Qide helplessly; both of them had already decided on this matter early on, now they are just going through the motion of making it official by gathering everyone here, but now!Huang Qide was silent for a moment then said: \u201cLet\u2019s wait two years then decide . \u201dLi Mu nodded; it seems this is the only way .Huang Wei seeing such an issue arises due to Huang Xiaolong or \u2018Hellion Huang\u2019, his eyes became even more venomous as he stared fixedly at Huang Xiaolong; and of course, Huang Xiaolong could feel the hatred . Nevertheless, his expression was calm as he sat there, not caring one bit .Moments later, everyone left .Huang Xiaolong left the Main Hall together with his Dad and Mom; returning to his small yard after separating from his parents . He continued to practice as looking forward to finding out once he breaks through to Fourth Order, his martial spirits will undergo another transformation and what it will bring .Time speeds and five days had passed .This night, Huang Xiaolong sat cross-legged on the cold jade bed, running Asura Tactics as the Netherworld\u2019s spiritual energy washes down like an endless waterfall, and the double-headed serpent devouring rapidly; the netherworld battle qi crash violently, again and again against the barrier to Fourth Order .Similar to the previous breakthrough to Second Order, and Third Order, under Huang Xiaolong\u2019s persistent and perseverance circulating his battle qi, at last, the fourth order barriers cracked, fissures gradually increased bigger .Fourth Order, breakthrough!However, at the same moment he crossed into Fourth Order, the double-headed serpent martial spirits behind Huang Xiaolong suddenly emitted bright colored rays of black as well as blue . A loud roar seemingly similar to a dragon\u2019s and yet not at the same time rang out; the double-headed serpent actually split starting from the head to the tail; two serpent bodies emerged \u2013 one blue serpent and one black serpent!Wrong, to be exact, not blue serpent and black serpent because after it had split into two, four claws grew under both serpent and the new scales that grew looks more like dragon scales!Note:Uglily\u00a0(adverb)Thank you for the encouragement; fingers crossed that I will not stop midway .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A double Divine Dragon at that!\u201cTwin martial spirits!\u201d A thought flashed across Huang Xiaolong\u2019s mind, finding it hard to believe . In Martial Spirit World, people who possess twin martial spirits are exceedingly rare; and each one is considered to be the pride of Heaven .Moreover, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s twin martial spirits are super-talent martial spirits!Even though the martial spirits behind him is a far cry from resembling a Primordial Divine Dragon; however this is its first time evolving, when he breakthrough to Seventh Order his martial spirits will experience its second transformation, and at that point, his martial spirits will truly become a Divine Dragon .After the shock, enthusiasm burst forth from Huang Xiaolong\u2019s heart .He did not expect the martial spirits evolvement that he was looking forward to will map out this way, his martial spirits actually turned into a superb talent twin martial spirits!Then, what is the awakened martial spirit\u2019s talent?\u201cThere are two; there\u2019s actually two!\u201d Within Huang Xiaolong's mind, an inherited memory was transferred to him from the twin black and blue dragon .Others martial spirit that had undergone a first-time transformation will have only one innate talent skill from the heritage memory of their martial spirits; and since Huang Xiaolong possess twin martial spirits, he gets two innate ability .Going through the heritage memory in his mind as he sat cross-legged on the cold jade bed; his silhouette suddenly turns blurry then disappear entirely in the end . Roughly about six breaths later did his silhouette slowly reappear on the cold jade bed .This is Huang Xiaolong\u2019s first martial spirit innate skill \u2013 Space Concealment!Space concealment, concealing within space, shadowless, formless \u2013 invisible!\u201cThis ability\u2019s too awesome!\u201d A twinkle flickers in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes .Imagine, if Huang Xiaolong were to disappear suddenly in the middle of an intense battle, silently sneaking behind the opponent delivering the killing blow; and the opponent is unable to guard against it . This skill is simply perfect for assassination!Although for now Huang Xiaolong only could hide for six breath\u2019s time, as he grows stronger, the duration will increase parallel as his strength increases . The stronger he gets, the longer he could remain conceal within space .If the first innate skill is space concealment, then what will the second one be?Thinking about it, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body floated up from the cold jade bed without warning, shifting into a phantom figure floating out of his room to his small courtyard .The second martial spirit\u2019s innate talent skill \u2013 Phantom Shadow!While testing the second ability, Huang Xiaolong noticed his speed increased about a third of his usual speed!Fighting with an opponent of similar strength, to grasp victory speed plays a crucial role, with the combination of both martial spirits\u2019 innate skill, he is utterly fearless .Huang Xiaolong inhaled a deeply, as emotions of pride filled him; a domineering aura emanated from his body .Moments later, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s surge of emotions gradually calms down .Suddenly, Huang Xiaolong leaps up into mid-air, his hands moving .One after another Ethereal Palm print condensed in the night sky .This time\u2019s breakthrough, Huang Xiaolong could feel his agility has doubled, and each of his attacks, his muscles\u2019 explosive powers were fierce and intense; this did not occur when he was in the Third Order .In the initial warrior stages, from First to Third Order battle qi in the meridians strengthens the entire body\u2019s muscles, allowing the flesh to be firm, strong and powerful whereby at Fourth Order, the battle qi in the meridians refines not only the muscles but also the tendons!One of Huang Xiaolong\u2019s palms hit the half-meter big rock at a corner of the small courtyard before he landed back on the ground; the night breeze blows, and the half-meter big rock disintegrated into powder spread to every corner of the small yard .From First to Third Order, each order\u2019s breakthrough increases one's strength by one stone, and upon advancing the Fourth Order the strength doubles; currently one of Huang Xiaolong\u2019s strike contains force and power of six stones!Dawn approaches, and the soft sunlight caresses Huang Xiaolong\u2019s skin as if his body is coated with a layer of golden light .Huang Xiaolong stood just like that in his small courtyard, letting the sun\u2019s warmth filled his body before he stepped out in the Eastern Courtyard\u2019s direction; but when he reached the Eastern Courtyard\u2019s hall, his father Huang Peng was not there, only his Mom Su Yan is in the hall .\u201cDad went to the Main Hall?\u201d Huang Xiaolong was puzzled .Su Yan nodded, said: \u201cThis morning your Grandfather asked him over, even Huang Ming and the Manor\u2019s elders also went over; not sure what they are discussing about . \u201dHearing this, Huang Xiaolong decided to wait until his Dad return .In the Main Hall, Huang Qide sat on the first seat, and took a glanced at everyone before opening his mouth to speak: \u201cTomorrow, Spirit Pool opens; and Huang Wei will practice inside for one month . \u201dIn the Main Hall, all present exchanged a knowing glance; then turn to look at Huang Peng .Huang Qide established Huang Clan Manor with his bare hands; none of the elders dare to contradict matters that he had already decided . According to predetermine rules, the winner of the sparring event after the awakening of martial spirits are eligible to enter the Spirit Pool to practice for one month . Obviously, Huang Xiaolong was the winner and should the one entering the Spirit Pool this time .When Huang Peng heard his father\u2019s announcement, he was flabbergasted for a moment; rage rose in his heart, and he stood up angrily: \u201cDad, this is unfair! This year\u2019s Clan Assembly clearly Xiaolong defeated Huang Wei; why is the Spirit Pool\u2019s opening Huang Wei is going in to practice instead!\u201dHuang Qide was slightly embarrassed . He does realize the unfairness of the situation, and neither right nor reason is on his side thus he couldn't reprimand his second son's behavior, he could only mutter unconvincingly: \u201cAlthough this year\u2019s assembly Xiaolong won over Huang Wei, it\u2019s only a fluke; comparing talent Huang Wei\u2019s talent are much higher than Xiaolong . This time he could breakthrough to Second Order was due to the three Yang fruits he swallowed . I initially set the winner will be able to enter the Spirit Pool, I actually meant each years\u2019 most talented awaken martial spirits disciple is eligible to enter the Spirit Pool to practice!\u201dThe fury within Huang Peng wasn't so easy to pacify, he abruptly cut in: \u201cBullsh*t! Only the most talented disciples are eligible to enter the Spirit Pool to practice? Why wasn\u2019t this brought up before? Why wait until Xiaolong won that it turned into the most talented disciple?\u201dHuang Qide faltered, not knowing how to answer .At this moment, Huang Ming spoke: \u201cSecond Brother, Dad\u2019s the Manor Lord or you are? You have yet the qualification to question or comment on Dad\u2019s decision . \u201dHuang Peng\u2019s hands tightened into fists; his angry gaze bore into Huang Ming, but he\u2019s unable to refute the truth in Huang Ming\u2019s words .\u201cSecond Manor Lord, the decisions Old Manor Lord\u2019s makes are all for the benefit of Huang Clan Manor . \u201d Elder Zhou Guang opened his mouth: \u201cEveryone knows Young Lord Xiaolong\u2019s talent is worse than Young Lord Huang Wei\u2019s talent . If Young Lord Xiaolong enters the Spirit Pool to practice, it will only waste the potency of the Spirit Pool!\u201dPointing a finger at Zhou Guang, Huang Peng thundered: \u201cShut your\u00a0dog mouth, this isn\u2019t a place for you to speak . \u201dZhou Guang squirmed, and his face flushed a deep red, not daring to utter another syllable .A moment later, forcefully suppressing his anger, Huang Peng turn to look at Huang Qide: \u201cOkay Dad, since you said this time was a fluke, what if during next year\u2019s assembly Xiaolong still precedes Huang Wei?\u201dHuang Qide was stumped .\u201cIn your opinion, during next year\u2019s Clan Assembly, Xiaolong will run into some dog shit luck again?\u201d Huang Ming said: \u201cFine, if Xiaolong wins again during next year\u2019s Clan Assembly, I will compensate you one hundred Battle qi dans and apologize to you!\u201dOne hundred Battle qi dans are almost equivalent to one month\u2019s practice in the Spirit Pool .\u201cGood!\u201d Huang Peng stared fixedly at Huang Ming: \u201cRemember what you said today!\u201d Dropping this sentence, Huang Peng turned and walked out of the Main Hall, not bothering to greet Huang Qide before leaving .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He naturally does not believe Huang Xiaolong will run into another incredible dog shit luck to be able to defeat his son a second time during next year\u2019s Clan Assembly .Therefore, the so-call one hundred pieces of Battle Qi dans is basically grasping at smoke, absolutely impossible!Inside the Main Hall, the elders secretly look at each other, none daring to speak out .At this moment, Huang Xiaolong is in the Eastern Courtyard, and he barely sits down, Huang Peng returns in a sullen mood .\u201cDad, what happened?\u201d Huang Xiaolong asked .Su Yan also stands up and walks towards Huang Peng .Guilt gnaws at Huang Peng\u2019s conscious as he looks at his son; walking straight into the main hall, he sat down without saying a word; head bend down but the anger his heart flares up even more instead of subsiding .\u201cThis is blatant bullying!\u201d\u201cBlatant bullying!\u201dRecalling Big Brother Huang Ming\u2019s mocking and his father\u2019s favoritism towards Huang Wei; Huang Peng couldn\u2019t help but let out an angry scream, a palm hits a chair beside him, shattering it into pieces .Su Yan frightened by Huang Peng\u2019s action, smashing at the chair .\u201cPeng Ge, what\u2019s wrong? What happened?\u201d Su Yan asks anxiously .Lifting his head, Huang Peng looks at his wife Su Yan, and his son then sighs inside his heart . In the end, Huang Peng recounts what happen in the Main Hall, when he reach the part where Huang Qide gave the quota to enter the Spirit Pool away \u2013 which supposedly belongs to Huang Xiaolong to Huang Wei, his anger rise once again; one of his palms slap at another chair beside him .\u201cDad\u2019s action is simply too bias! In his eyes, only Huang Wei is his grandson!\u201d When Su Yan heard everything, her almond shaped eyes widened in anger, said indignantly: \u201cDoes he still regard our Xiaolong as his grandson?!\u201dHuang Xiaolong didn\u2019t say anything but snickers inside, although he defeated Huang Wei a few days ago during the Clan\u2019s Assembly; and although he revealed his Second Order strength, but it seems his Grandfather Huang Qide actually bears no concern for him in the least . Probably in Grandfather Huang Qide\u2019s eyes, he was able to advance to Second Order warrior was largely due to some dog shit luck and can\u2019t be compared to Huang Wei\u2019s achievement .\u201cAnd that Zhou Guang dares to belittle our Xiaolong, even dare to say our Xiaolong will waste the potency of the Spirit Pool he is the one to go in!\u201d Su Yan continues heatedly: \u201cThis dog-like slave, if not for Huang Ming backing him, he wouldn\u2019t dare to utter such words!\u201dAlthough Zhou Guang is an \u2018elder\u2019 of Huang Clan Manor, his privileged status and authority are only a trifling higher compared to the elite guards, he, at the end of the day is still considered a slave .\u201cXiaolong, forgive Dad . \u201d Looking at his son, his voice sounds down and fill with guilt . \u201cIt\u2019s all because Dad is useless, not only I lost this year\u2019s place to enter the Spirit Pool but actually to lose it to Huang Wei!\u201dWhen Huang Xiaolong heard this, he just smiles callously: \u201cDad, Mom, don\u2019t worry; at next year\u2019s Clan Assembly, not only I will hit him until his Dad can\u2019t recognize him, I will hit him till even Grandfather can\u2019t recognize him!\u201dSince Grandfather Huang Qide treasures his darling grandson Huang Wei so much, then this \u2018seven grade\u2019 martial spirits grandson will show his Grandfather that his dog shit luck only gets better and better, stronger than ever!Not only during next year\u2019s Clan Assembly, at every coming year\u2019s assembly he will \u2018revamp\u2019 Huang Wei into super pig-head .Huang Peng and Su Yan thought their son was trying to comfort them, willing them not to worry; Huang Peng\u2019s feeling of guilt increases .Under the notion that their son is only a grade seven martial spirits talent, the gap between him and Huang Wei will only increase as time goes by; in one year\u2019s time Huang Wei could breakthrough to Third Order, maybe even higher . Their son, however, possessing only a grade seven martial spirits, their son would need at least two years to breakthrough from Second Order to Third Order .At next year\u2019s Clan Assembly, can their son defeat Huang Wei?Unless his son is lucky enough to swallow another three pieces of Yang fruit or similar elixir, otherwise\u2026 Huang Peng sighs, would his son be fortunate enough to come across elixirs similar to Yang fruit a second time?Looking at the expressions on his parents\u2019 face, Huang Xiaolong can guess that his parents\u2019 aren\u2019t optimistic about him defeating Huang Wei next year .\u201cDad, Mom, I plan to train in the back mountains for some time . \u201d Huang Xiaolong said after thinking about it for a moment .This arrangement allows him to practice the Body Metamorphose Scripture conveniently; running back and forth all the time is actually an inconvenience, furthermore, for the time being, Huang Xiaolong doesn\u2019t want Asura Tactics to be exposed .\u201cNo!\u201d The moment the words left Huang Xiaolong\u2019s lips, Su Yan objects strongly without even needing to think .Huang Peng also said: \u201cXiaolong, I know you\u2019re going to the back mountain so that you could practice peacefully but your strength is only at Second Order, it\u2019s too dangerous!\u201dHuang Xiaolong had expected his parent would object, ultimately in their eyes; he\u2019s just a seven-year-old child; no parents will willingly allow a seven-year-old child to leave the safety of home just for training .\u201cDad, Mom, I will only be at the outer edge of the back mountain; as long as I don\u2019t enter into the deeper parts, there\u2019s no danger!\u201d Huang Xiaolong said: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry . \u201dBut despite what Huang Xiaolong said to persuade them, Huang Peng and Su Yan vehemently rejects it .\u201cWhat if I can defeat Huang Wei during next year\u2019s assembly?\u201d Huang Xiaolong who was feeling powerless changed his tact and asked .\u201cDefeat Huang Wei?\u201d Both of them looked at Huang Xiaolong .\u201cIf you are able to defeat Huang Wei during next year\u2019s sparring event, I will allow you to practice in the back mountain!\u201d Huang Peng finally agreed in a solemn voice after musing over it for a while: \u201cWe can discuss this again after you defeat Huang Wei next year . \u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d Huang Xiaolong agrees, since there\u2019s no way around it, he could only wait one year .And at this time in the Northern Courtyard, listening to his father describing the situation where his Grandfather made the announcement; Huang Wei\u2019s face blossomed into a bright smile: \u201cGrandfather indeed is wise, knows if that kid is allowed into the Spirit Pool it will only lead to wastage!\u201dSince his return to Northern Courtyard from the Main Hall, Huang Ming\u2019s in a good mood, laughs as he listens to his son\u2019s words: \u201cSince your Grandfather had given you this chance, you mustn\u2019t disappoint your Grandfather and me; though your talent is excellent, you must still put effort into your practice!\u201dHuang Wei smile and said: \u201cDad, rest assure; once I enter the Spirit Pool and practice there, I definitely will breakthrough to Third Order in less than one year!\u201d Speaking up to here, both Huang Wei\u2019s pupils emits extreme hatred: \u201cDuring next year\u2019s Clan Assembly, I will make that little doggy kneel before me, and I will cripple both of his arms and legs!\u201dReturning to his small yard from the Eastern Courtyard, Huang Xiaolong did not continue with his practice like always . Instead, he takes out a piece of paper from Asura Ring .Now that he\u2019s a Fourth Order warrior, he could start practicing battle skills .Recorded on the piece of paper, a set of sword attack battle skill as if created especially for the Blades of Asura, and another set of battle skill called Asura Demon Claw .There\u2019s a total of eighteen styles to the Asura Sword Skill, and each style contains three moves whereby Asura Demon Claw have slightly less, only five styles .Going through both set of skills once, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes were attracted to a small drawing of Asura Sword Skill, which prompts his decision first to practice the sword skill .Coming out from his room to his small yard, Huang Xiaolong called out the Blades of Asura . Recalling the drawing depicting the first attack\u2019s movement, mood and the qi circulation inside the body; with a wave of the blades, dozens of blade images emerge out of nowhere, rotating and gathering into two small cyclones, zigzags within the perimeter of the small yard .Asura Sword Skill, First Style: Tempest of Hell .NotePeng\u00a0Ge; Ge lit .

As he stands there, inside his mind were an endless parade of swirling cyclones that engulf everything in its path, however, the sporadic movement is seen clearly by his eyes .Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong suddenly moves; his hands wield the blades . This time, there are eighteen rays of blades appeared out of nowhere, in a constant spin in midair; air drafts rotates forming two dense cyclones \u2013 doubled the size of previous cyclones .Once again Huang Xiaolong stands motionless, recollecting the sensation when the Tempest of Hell forms, the way it swirls, and the way it rotates as it moves accordingly to a predetermined trajectory and lastly, its directions .Another half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong waves out Blades of Asura once again .And so the circle repeats, over and over again .Every time after he slashes out, he stands immobile on the spot like a statue, comprehending the essence of the move then attacks again .From morning till noon, until evening and till the last ray of sunlight is about to disappear; the blades in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s hands suddenly strikes out . Two distinctive Tempest of Hell is constantly rotating that the whistles of the wind are akin to mournful whimpers that crawl out from hell; causing hearts to palpitates listening to it .Apart from that, the current Tempest of Hell can last for five breathes time .As he listens to the faint cries of hell coming from the Tempest of Hell, Huang Xiaolong lets out a sigh of relief; according to the piece of paper, once Tempest of Hell issues faint hellish cries then it is considered as minor completion!If the Sovereign Founder of Asura\u2019s Gates, Ren Wokuang knew that Huang Xiaolong only used one day of practice to reach minor completion in Asura Sword Skill\u2019s First Style \u2013 Tempest of Hell, he would be dumbstruck speechless .During Ren Wokuang\u2019s time, when he accidentally got hold of this particular exercise law; it took him more than two months practicing Tempest of Hell before he could produce the cries from hell .Whereby Huang Xiaolong only used one day!Battle skills training are irrelevant to martial spirits for it relies on individual\u2019s talent and insight . In his previous life, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s a rare martial arts prodigy in a hundred years . The concept of battle skills is similar to martial skills . Thus it\u2019s not something inconceivable that Huang Xiaolong just needs one day of practice to achieve minor completion in the First Style of Asura Sword Skill .Watching the night descends, Huang Xiaolong stops his training . He enters his room and sits cross-legged on the cold jade bed, running Asura Tactics exercise law to practice his battle qi .Ever since he advanced to Fourth Order, his double-headed serpent martial spirits not only evolved into superb talent twin martial spirits, physically its size had gone up a notch .At the time when Huang Xiaolong\u2019s martial spirits had just awakened, the double-headed serpent martial spirits were only half a meter long .Black and Blue Dragon hovers at behind Huang Xiaolong; its mouth wide open devouring nonstop the netherworld spiritual aura pouring down from midair . The netherworld spiritual aura became darker, thicker and purer after the broke through to Fourth Order .From the bodies of Black and Blue Dragon faintly emits the prestige of a dragon .\u2026 . .Time flies and very quickly one month had passed .The days gives way to month; every day is the same routine . Apart from practicing Asura Tactics, and Body Metamorphose Scripture, every morning Huang Xiaolong will be practicing Asura Sword Skill in the small yard . After one month\u2019s time, when Huang Xiaolong attacks with Blades of Asura, the blade rays has reached up to forty from the initial eighteen; and the cyclones generated by Tempest of Hell has more than doubled in size .One night at the back mountain, Huang Xiaolong wants to tests the power of Tempest of Hell; with a wave of the blades in his hands, Tempest of Hell flew out spinning . As the Tempest of Hell spins around, every tree within thirty meters was cut down and on the tree trunks of these cut-down trees was covered with numerous slash marks as if someone slashed them with a sword more a hundred times .Looking at the trees on the ground, Huang Xiaolong nods his head in satisfaction; Asura Sword Skill\u2019s attack power is quite high and so much stronger than his previous life family\u2019s sword skill, the Excrate Devil Sword .\u201cBut, with this speed, to reach this move \u2013 Tempest of Hell\u2019s major completion still needs six months\u2019 time . \u201d Huang Xiaolong thinks silently .Although the power of Tempest of Hell\u2019s attack is already quite high after a month\u2019s hard penance, however, compared to that piece of paper\u2019s description, his power is still a far cry from major completion .This Tempest of Hell attack\u2019s once he reaches major completion, once the two cyclones form Huang Xiaolong could change directions according to his will .After practicing for some time at the back mountain, Huang Xiaolong slowly adjusts his mood . Opening his legs wide apart and both of his hands stretches up above his head; absorbing the surrounding spiritual aura that seems to gush into his body, converting them into internal strength; accumulating inside Huang Xiaolong\u2019s dantian .Moments after entering his Body Metamorphose training pose, suddenly Huang Xiaolong notice a bright flash of golden light from his dantian . Subsequently, his body follows, glowing brightly, the air ripples outwards in four directions as an internal qi bursts forth from Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body .Slowly, Huang Xiaolong retrieves his palm and stops his training . His eyes open as he circulates the third stage internal qi along his meridians, opening them further!With his, he will be able to train in the fourth stage \u2013 Convert Power of the Stars .Recalling the instructions for the Fourth Stage, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s right feet steps one foot forward facing his left foot similar to the number eight (\u516b ), his body bending forward over the knees . His left hand stretches over the head pointing up to the sky, and in this posture, Huang Xiaolong breathes slowly . The spiritual aura once again rushes towards Huang Xiaolong, absorb into his body .The night passed quietly .Only when the sky starts to brighten that Huang Xiaolong puts down his left hand and steps back; finishing his Body Metamorphose Scripture training .After breathing out a mouth of foul qi, he strikes out some Ethereal Palm as practice before heading back to Huang Clan Manor . By the time he reached Huang Clan Manor, the sun\u2019s already high up in the sky; with ambling steps, Huang Xiaolong heads towards the Eastern Courtyard\u2019s hall . Stepping into the hall, Huang Xiaolong sees both Huang Peng and Su Yan are present however something about the atmosphere in the hall seems not right that Huang Xiaolong couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cDad, Mom, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cHuang Wei\u2019s out from the Spirit Pool!\u201d Huang Peng said looking at his son; his voice sounded weak: \u201cI heard he reached peak-late Second Order!\u201dOnly at this moment, Huang Xiaolong remembers that one month has passed since the Spirit Pool opened . Peak early-Second Order?\u00a0 Looks like the result of one month's practice in the Spirit Pool is not bad; Huang Xiaolong sneers .\u201cDad, Mom, you don\u2019t have to worry about next year\u2019s Clan Assembly . \u201d Huang Xiaolong said: \u201cActually, I had already reached peak early-Second Order the day before yesterday!\u201dHuang Xiaolong projects his battle qi after he finishes his sentence .\u201cThis, peak early-Second Order!\u201d Huang Peng and Su Yan were full of shock sensing the battle qi coming from Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body .\u201cXiaolong, this?!\" Huang Peng stares at his son, could it be his son had another fortuitous adventure? If not, how could he advance with such speed?Laughingly, Huang Xiaolong explains: \u201cAbout this matter, it\u2019s better if you don\u2019t ask .Huang Peng and Su Yan made eye contact; it seems their son carries many secrets, but since their son does not wish to elaborate, then they will not pester him about it .\u201cOkay, Xiaolong, as long as you breakthrough to Third Order by the end of the year, even if you can\u2019t defeat Huang Wei, Dad will still allow you to practice at the back mountains . \u201d Huang Peng said as he looks at his son .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even if you can\u2019t breakthrough to peak late-Second Order, but reach late-Second Order, we will still be very happy . \u201d This time, it was Mom Su Yan who spoke .Words fail Huang Xiaolong as he smiled helplessly inside his heart .Third Order? Peak late-Second Order? Late-Second Order?\u201cDad, Mom, I\u2019m going back to the small yard . \u201d Huang Xiaolong said as he stood up, gently hitting the arm of the chair; wondering whether his parents would further lower their requirement to peak mid-Second Order .If it came to that, he might not be able to resist and expose his current strength of peak early-Fourth Order!\u201cAh, Xiaolong . \u201d When Huang Xiaolong was about the leave the hall, Huang Peng thought of something, said: \u201cA few days from now\u00a0is Old Patriarch Li\u2019s eighth birthday celebration; and he invited our Huang Clan Manor to the celebration party . That little girl kept badgering him to invite you, insisting that you must be there . \u201d\u201cShe Insists that I go?\u201d Huang Xiaolong felt amazement . That little girl doesn't really fancy him, right? Just because he looked really cool when he beat up Huang Wei miserably during the annual Clan\u2019s Assembly?\u201cDad, Mom, can I not go?\u201d Huang Xiaolong asked weakly .\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Su Yan\u2019s eyes glared at him .Huang Xiaolong was depressed; looks like he can\u2019t avoid going to the party .Su Yan laughed seeing her son\u2019s sulky face, teases him: \u201cYou brat, don\u2019t grumble . Li Lu is the apple of Old Patriarch Li\u2019s eyes, possessing a grade nine martial spirit and she\u2019ll surely grow up to be a beautiful young lady . \u201dHuang Xiaolong\u2019s even more speechless, what\u2019s with this and that; if her Mom knew her son has superb talent, and a twin martial superb talent at that, she probably wouldn't think this way .At this moment, Huang Peng also joined in: \u201cYour Mom\u2019s right . In the future, if you marry Old Patriarch Li granddaughter, Li Lu, then your Mom and I . . . \u201dWhile his father was still talking, Huang Xiaolong quickly cut in: \u201cOkay, Dad, I understand; it\u2019s fine as long as I go right? When do we leave? Are you going?\u201dSu Yan couldn\u2019t help but laugh when she heard Huang Xiaolong\u2019s response: \u201cIt seems like our son\u2019s feeling shy . \u201d She stopped teasing Huang Xiaolong and said: \u201cWe leave the day after tomorrow, but other than you and your Dad, your Grandfather, Eldest Uncle and that Huang Wei is also going . \u201dHuang Xiaolong\u2019s brows wrinkled, and nodded: \u201cOkay, I know; if there\u2019s nothing else then I\u2019ll go back . \u201dBoth Huang Peng and Su Yan nodded .Huang Xiaolong turned around and left .Watching his son\u2019s back, Su Yan sighed and said: \u201cHow wonderful it would be if our Xiaolong marries Li Lu!\u201dHuang Peng shook his head: \u201cWith Li Lu\u2019s background and talent, she won't like our Xiaolong . Also,\u00a0right now Li Lu is only an eight-year-old child; so while she may not consider it, she will when she grows up . \"By this time Huang Xiaolong\u00a0had\u00a0returned to his small courtyard\u00a0and started practicing Tempest of Hell so he didn't hear what his parents said after he leftTwo days came and went quickly, and the day of departure arrived . The moment Huang Xiaolong arrived at Eastern Courtyard, he was dragged by Huang Peng to the Main Hall; and by the time they got to the Main Hall, his Grandfather Huang Qide, Eldest Uncle Huang Ming, and Huang Wei were already waiting .When Huang Wei saw Huang Xiaolong stepping into the Main Hall, his eyes were full of hatred; if not for Huang Qide\u2019s presence, he probably would have pounced on Huang Xiaolong .\u201cDad . \u201d \u201cGrandfather . \u201dHuang Xiaolong and Huang Peng walked up to Huang Qide and said their greeting, ignoring Huang Wei\u2019s imitation of a ferocious beast .Huang Qide nodded and laughed: \u201cSince everyone\u2019s here, let\u2019s go . \u201d Huang Qide stepped out, and four people followed after him .Even though Huang Clan Manor and the Li Family were known as two of the major powers in Canglan County, but there was quite a distance between them .The Li Family Residence is in Canglan County\u2019s County City whereby Huang Clan Manor is situated a hundred miles outside of County City .Therefore, it was evening when Huang Xiaolong\u2019s group of five arrived in County City, nearing dusk .Brother Qide! You traveled quite a distance to come for my celebration yet I\u2019m slow in my welcome; please forgive me!\u201d said Old Patriarch Li while laughing merrily when the five of them arrived at County City .\u201cBrother Li Mu is too polite!\u201d Huang Qide laughed robustly .Huang Xiaolong looked around and noticed that the little girl Li Lu, was standing behind a roundish face middle-aged man who was a little chubby with slightly small eyes \u2013 which gave the impression that he was always beaming .Is this Old Patriarch Li\u2019s only son, Li Cheng; Li Lu\u2019s father?\u00a0Huang Xiaolong wondered .At this moment, the little girl who was hiding behind Li Cheng looked mischievously\u00a0at Huang Xiaolong, stuck her tongue out at Huang Xiaolong and giggled; looking very cute .Huang Xiaolong rolled his eyes, totally ignoring her .Seeing Huang Xiaolong\u2019s nonchalant reaction, Li Lu pouted her .This scene was seen by Huang Wei who was standing at the side; hatred surged violently in his heart . Although his engagement with Li Lu during the Clan Assembly was ruined by Huang Xiaolong, however in his heart Li Lu already is his wife, and now his \u2018wife\u2019 was blatantly flirting with Huang Xiaolong right in front of him!After the customary greetings, everyone entered the city heading towards Li Residence .Contrary to expectations, the Li Residence was not in located in the center of the city but the south section . When they arrived before the Li Residence\u2019s main entrance; the twenty meters wide street in front were filled with an endless stream of horses and carriages, the street was lively and decorated with bright and colorful lanterns . For Li Mu\u2019s eightieth birthday celebration, other than Huang Clan Manor, most of the forces in Canglan County had already arrived .However, the real celebration happens tomorrow, thus there are those who were yet to arrive; who were on their way .When they arrived at the Li Residence, Li Mu personally lead them to the prearranged courtyard to rest .\u201cBrother Qide, if there\u2019s anything you need, just inform the Residence\u2019s guards . Please forgive the poor hospitality . \u201d Li Mu said to Huang Qide\u00a0with a smile .Huang Qide waved his hand and said: \u201cYou\u2019re too polite . En, please go and attend to your matters; tomorrow, we brothers will drink together later . \u201dLi Mu laughed \u2018hehe\u2019: \u201cDefinitely . \u201d Then turned around and left .But what happened next stunned Huang Xiaolong; not long after Li Mu left Li Lu came to their courtyard! After greeting Huang Qide, Huang Ming, and Huang Peng, she went straight to Huang Xiaolong and said in a petulant voice: \u201cXiaolong, This is your first time in County City right? Come, I\u2019ll give you a tour!\u201d Her hand was already pulling Huang Xiaolong away from the courtyard even before he had the chance to reply .Huang Wei stared pointedly at Li Lu holding Huang Xiaolong\u2019s hand, and watched both of them leave the courtyard; his expression was ugly to the extreme . And of course, Huang Ming\u2019s face wasn\u2019t looking any better either .Huang Qide opened his mouth, but didn\u2019t know what to say; Huang Peng stood there quietly, but his heart was flipping in delight .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019m your wife . What is wrong with a wife holding her husband\u2019s hand? I\u2019m not afraid of any misunderstanding and also don\u2019t call me a little girl . I\u2019m a very big girl!\u201dThe little girl ended her speech puffing up her small chest .Black lines emerged on Huang Xiaolong\u2019s forehead .Wife?Very big?Huang Xiaolong took a glance at Li Lu\u2019s tilted but yet to develop small chest, smiled wryly to himself; that area\u2019s still a flat land, right?Noticing Huang Xiaolong staring at her small chest, her face blushed bright red, in a barely whispering voice said: \u201cYou, why are you looking at people* like that; I\u2019m shy when there're so many other people here . \u201d[TN: The people* here is Li Lu referring to herself from a third party\u2019s point of view . ]Huang Xiaolong\u2019s was so speechless that he clamped his mouth shut, not a word came out .Pulling away his hand, he went out of the Li Residence and walked towards the main street . This really was his first time in Canglan County\u2019s County City, and he wanted to look around .\u201cXiaolong, wait for me!\u201d Li Lu pouted her mouth at Huang Xiaolong for pulling away his hand, then quickly ran\u00a0after him with quick steps, however, this time instead of holding Huang Xiaolong\u2019s hand, Li Lu wrapped her hand around his arms; looking just like a submissive little wife . A soft girl\u2019s fragrance wafts into Huang Xiaolong\u2019s nose .Huang Xiaolong trying to avoid body contact with her, said: \u201cYou can go back, I can walk by myself . \u201dLi Lu pouted and her eyes became rimmed with red as tears welled within: \u201cI\u2019ll go back and tell Grandfather that you bullied me!\u201dHuang Xiaolong quickly used his hand to stop her from leaving, feeling a headache: \u201cFine then, let's go but you must promise me that you won\u2019t pull or drag me . \u201dLi Lu burst out laughing, the look in her eyes changed instantly, nodded: \u201cOkay . \u201dHuang Xiaolong sighed in relief when Li Lu nodded in agreement; they turned and began walking along the street with Li Lu following beside Huang Xiaolong on the right, being extremely obedient; as they walked her big round eyes\u00a0occasionally\u00a0steals furtive glances at him .Huang Xiaolong didn\u2019t care, and continued to look around; not paying her any attention .Both of them did not speak much along the way, and after going around once as they were about to return to the Li Residence, they noticed at a corner of the street was crowded with a lot of people pointing fingers and whispering about something .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s curiosity was stoked, so he and Li Lu walked in their direction, squeezing through the crowd have to a look . A middle-aged man was lying on the ground in the middle of the crowd; with messy, unkempt hair, a dirty-stained face and worn-out rags for clothes . Clearly, he had fainted . On the ground, next to the middle-aged man were several tiny drops of blood, obviously spat out by the injured middle-aged man .After observing the middle-aged man for a moment, he hesitated briefly then walked up to him and lifted him up; since he had become a Fourth Order warrior, his arm strength was not weak, and so carrying an adult was not difficult .Li Lu was astonished\u00a0when Huang Xiaolong lifted the middle-aged man up .\u201cLet\u2019s go . \u201d Huang Xiaolong said to Li Lu as he walked past her carrying the middle-aged man; he noticed Li Lu was still standing on the same spot in a daze . Li Lu quickly ran after Huang Xiaolong after recovering her senses, couldn\u2019t stop herself from asking: \u201cXiaolong, why are you carrying this man back with you?\u201d\u201cYou wouldn't understand even if I told you . \u201d He replied without turning his head .Are you saying I wouldn't understand even if you explained?\u00a0 Li Lu\u2019s small mouth puckered up into a sulky pout but she kept quiet .On the way, Huang Xiaolong asked Li Lu for the location of the Li Residence\u2019s back door and went in through the back door carrying the fainted middle-aged man, placing him in a remote and secluded room .Watching the middle-aged man on the bed, Huang Xiaolong circulated internal qi then pointed at the middle-aged man\u2019s chest, his finger subsequently going lower . In total Huang Xiaolong jabbed a few more times with his finger; by the time he was done, he was breathing heavily and beads of sweat were dripping from his forehead .Li Lu was stood behind Huang Xiaolong as she watched him indiscriminately poke at different parts of the middle-aged man\u2019s body, with a puzzled expression .\u201cAsk someone to bring over a set of clothes, and clean him up . \u201d Huang Xiaolong said to Li Lu after he had recovered his breath .\u201cOh, okay . \u201d Coming out from her daze, Li Lu nodded .A short while later, an attendant of Li Residence brought over a set of clothes and bathed the middle-aged man, but he remained unconscious .\u201cYou can go now . \u201d He said to Li Lu since the patient hasn\u2019t awakened .She was about to say that she will stay here to keep him company\u00a0but looking at Huang Xiaolong\u2019s stern gaze, she could only nod and say: \u201cYes . \u201dNot long after Li Lu left, on the wooden bed Fei Hou slowly opened his eyes finally awake . \u00a0 He got up slowly supporting his own weight; observing his surroundings his gaze fell on Huang Xiaolong in the end, with a surprised look on his face, asked: \u201cLittle Brother, you are the one who saved me?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right . \u201d Huang Xiaolong nodded his head .\u201cWhere am I?\u201d\u201cWe are at Canglan County\u2019s Li Residence . \u201dFei Hou tried his best to step down from the bed, abruptly frowned: \u201cCanglan County?\u201d In his memory, there\u2019s no recollection where Canglan County is .\u201cLittle Brother, thank you very much for saving me; I have some matters to attend to, so I need to leave first . \u201d Just when Fei Hou wanted to walk out from the room, suddenly a violent pain erupted inside his body and with a \u201cwaaa\u201d blood spurts out from his mouth . And he fell to the floor .Huang Xiaolong quickly helped him back to the bed and said: \u201cYou were heavily injured . The meridians inside your body are broken . I temporarily used \u2018returning soul finger\u2019 to stabilize your injury and your vital acupuncture points . If you move recklessly . . . \u201d When he got to this point, Huang Xiaolong stopped explaining, for the consequences are clear .\u201cReturning Soul Finger?\u201d \u201cAcupuncture points?\u201d Fei Hou looked at Huang Xiaolong .Huang Xiaolong did not bother to explain, changing the topic, he asked: \u201cYou are a disciple of Asura\u2019s Gate, aren't you?\u201d While on the street, Huang Xiaolong had noticed an Asura tattoo on Fei Hou\u2019s left arm; a sign of Asura\u2019s Gate disciples, which was why Huang Xiaolong brought him back .\u201cWhat? Who are you? How do you know I\u2019m a disciple of Asura\u2019s Gate?\u201d Fei Hou was greatly shocked; then he looked at Huang Xiaolong warily .Again Huang Xiaolong did not answer, under Fei Hou\u2019s watchful eyes he raised his left hand, and a dark black ring appeared on his left ring finger .\u201cA, A, Asura\u2019s Ring!\u201d Looking at the dark black ring, Fei Hou\u2019s body trembled with excitement after a moment he snapped out of his daze, finding it hard to believe .Huang Xiaolong quietly observed Fei Hou\u2019s reaction; according to the piece of paper, this Asura\u2019s Ring is the symbol and proof of Asura\u2019s Gate Sovereign and any disciples who see the ring will kneel and bow down in a prostate position .After Fei Hou\u2019s shock and excitement passed, recovering his senses instantly knelt down and kowtowed before Huang Xiaolong: \u201cDisciple of Asura\u2019s Gate greets Sovereign; Sovereign is invincible throughout!\u201dHuang Xiaolong silently breathed out in relief after seeing at Fei Hou\u2019s reaction; if there was something not right with Fei Hou\u2019s response earlier, he was prepared to call out the blades without hesitation and kill Fei Hou . At this moment, Fei Hou\u2019s meridians are broken and are heavily injured . He definitely couldn't dodge Huang Xiaolong\u2019s Blades of Asura .\u201cFei Hou\u2026 you can stand up . \u201d Huang Xiaolong nodded .\u201cYes, thank you Sovereign!\u201d Fei Hou stands up, his attitude respectful to the extreme . And Huang Xiaolong could tell his respectful manner were sincere from the heart and not pretense .\u201cHow did you get hurt?\u201d Huang Xiaolong asked after thinking for a moment .\u201cReplying Sovereign, disciples went into Yin Yue (Silver Moon) Forest wanting to hunt for a tenth stage Demonic Ghosteye Spider, to refine dans with its core; but didn\u2019t expect that Demonic Ghosteye Spider was a pair, so\u2026\u201d Fei Hou said feeling a little embarrassed .So, he was counter-attacked?\u00a0Huang Xiaolong thought, but since Fei Hou was able to escape from the counter-attack of two tenth stage wicked beasts, it looks like he is very strong, at the very least, he must be stronger than Grandfather!

Although he would like to know more about Asura\u2019s Gate and its current situation but with Fei Hou\u2019s serious injuries, it\u2019s more important first to stabilize his condition .\u201cSovereign, my body\u2019s broken veins\u2026\u201d Fei Hou hesitated before asking .In general, broken veins are incurable unless he could find those legendary elixirs .\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry . \u201d Huang Xiaolong waved his hand, said, \u201cI can reconnect your veins, it's just that it will take about six months . \u201d\u201cSovereign! You can reconnect my broken veins?\u201d Fei Hou was very shocked; it was not that he doubted Huang Xiaolong but he felt it was too bizarre! Could it be that the Sovereign was in possession of a legendary elixir?\u201cSit down first . \u201dFei Hou\u2019s heart was filled with questions but he dared not defy orders . He answered respectfully and sat down . Once he sat down, Huang Xiaolong put his palms on Fei Hou\u2019s back and circulated his internal energy, thereby transferring it to Fei Hou . In an instant, Fei Hou could feel warm energy enter his body; he quickly refocused his attention and coordinated with Huang Xiaolong, guiding the warm energy to nourish his body .More than one hour passed .Huang Xiaolong stopped, face slightly pale .Although his Body Metamorphose training had reached the fourth stage, his internal energy was still a bit weak . However, after having spent more than an hour of transferring internal energy to Fei Hou, he was now able to circulate the energy on his own to recover his strength .Huang Xiaolong watched Fei Hou circulating internal energy to heal himself for a little while, and then he left the room and returned to his yard .When Huang Peng saw his son returned looking tired, he felt a little strange; didn\u2019t his son go out with Li Lu to walk around the city?\u201cXiaolong, are you okay?\u201d Huang Peng askedSeeing at his father\u2019s concern, he laughed . \u201cI\u2019m fine Dad . \u201dHuang Peng lets out a breath of relief, then asked, \u201cMiss Li Lu has gone back?\u201dHuang Xiaolong nodded his head .Suddenly, Huang Peng smiled, and his smile carried a strange flavor as his stare fixed on Huang Xiaolong, Huang Peng, quipped: \u201cIsn\u2019t Miss Li Lu\u2019s hand very soft and smooth? Isn\u2019t nice holding hands with a beauty?\u201dHuang Xiaolong blanked out for a moment before smiling: \u201cI say Old Man, what are talking about . There\u2019s nothing going on between Miss Li Lu and me . \u201dHuang Peng smiled and said, \u201cOkay, I know there\u2019s nothing between you and Li Lu, only Miss Li Lu has something with you . \u201d When he said that, Huang Peng laughed happily \u201cYou don\u2019t know this, but when Miss Li Lu pulled your hand on the way out that brat Huang Wei\u2019s expression was so bad, it was like he ate dog shit . \u201dHuang Xiaolong shook his head while smiling .\u201cBut, Xiaolong, you have to be wary of Huang Wei . \u201d said Huang Peng and his toned turned serious .\u201cI know Dad, don\u2019t worry . If there is nothing else, I\u2019ll be going back to my room,\u201d said Huang Xiaolong .Huang Peng nodded . \u201cOkay, go and rest . \u201dAfter Huang Xiaolong got into his room, he took out the cold jade bed from Ring of Asura, sat on it then began to practice Asura Tactic . The night passed and morning came . Huang Xiaolong stopped his training, all the lethargy from yesterday had disappeared leaving him feeling refreshed .Leaving his room, Huang Xiaolong walked towards Fei Hou\u2019s room; as he got there, coincidentally Fei Hou came out .\u201cSeen Sovereign, Sovereign invincible throughout!\u201d Fei Hou saw Huang Xiaolong, immediately knelt down on one knee in salute . After Huang Xiaolong had helped him to treat his injury last night, his demeanor became even more respectful towards Huang Xiaolong .\u201cYou can stand . \u201d Huang Xiaolong nodded .Only then Fei Hou did stand up respectfully .\u201cFei Hou, when others are around, address me as young master . \u201d Huang Xiaolong muttered in a low voice: \u201cAlso, stop lauding 'Sovereign invincible throughout!'\u201dEvery time Huang Xiaolong heard the sentence \u2018Sovereign invincible throughout!\u2019 he felt depressed even though he knew it was a rule set by Ren Wokuang, the previous Sovereign .Fei Hou paused for a moment, then said, \u201cSovereign, \u2018Sovereign Invincible throughout\u2019 this sentence during salute was set by the previous Sovereign if we stop\u2026?\u201dHuang Xiaolong waved his hand and said: \u201cI know that this rule was set by Master years ago, but rules are established by people . I\u2019m the current Sovereign, and I say this rule is now abolished . \u201dMaster?\u00a0Fei Hou had been curious about Huang Xiaolong\u2019s relation with the Old Sovereign . Hearing Huang Xiaolong refer to the Old Sovereign as Master he now knew . \u00a0Right, who else but the old Sovereign\u2019s pro-disciple can be the Sovereign of Asura\u2019s Gate?Fei Hou Immediately responded: \u201cAs Sovereign ordered!\u201d\u201cHow\u2019s your recovery?\u201d Huang Xiaolong asked .\u201cReplying Sovereign; your subordinate\u2019s injury has recovered about seventy percent, in three days my wounds should fully recover, but my veins\u2026\u201d Fei Hou\u2019s words stopped here .\u201cYou needn't worry about your veins . Now, tell me about the current situation in Asura\u2019s Gate . \u201dWhen Fei Hou heard that, his expression became complicated .\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Huang Xiaolong frowned .Seeing Huang Xiaolong\u2019s expression he knew Huang Xiaolong had misunderstood, and quickly said: \u201cSovereign, it\u2019s not that your subordinate is unwilling to report . Honestly, it's just that subordinate is not very clear . \u201d\u201cNot very clear?\u201d Huang Xiaolong was startled .\u201cYes . \u201d Fe Hou nodded, he then explained to Huang Xiaolong . Fei Hou entered Asura\u2019s Gate twenty years ago, and he had never been to Asura\u2019s Gate headquarters . Twenty years ago he met an Elder from Asura\u2019s Gate and was taken in as a disciple, and that was how he entered Asura\u2019s Gate . His Master never talked to him about sect\u2019s matters .His Master\u2019s name is Yu Ming .\u201cBut Master did mention that after Old Sovereign had disappeared fifty years ago, there was an internal struggle for the Sovereign\u2019s position resulting in Asura\u2019s Gate splitting into two factions . \u201d Fei Hou said .\u201cSplit into two factions!\u201d Huang Xiaolong\u2019s brows creased, asked: \u201cWhere is your Master now?\u201d\u201cThree years ago we separated, and since then I haven\u2019t seen Master . Back then, Master said he had something to do in Mohe Kingdom\u2019s Imperial City . \u201d Replied Fei Hou .The Mohe Kingdom?\u00a0Huang Xiaolong had heard about the Mohe Kingdom, but the distance from there to Luo Tong kingdom where Huang Xiaolong located was too far . To reach the Mohe Kingdom from the Luo Tong Kingdom, he would need to pass through more than ten other kingdoms in between .If it\u2019s like this, getting a clear picture of the internal situation at Asura\u2019s Gate is currently impossible .At this moment, Li Lu ran over from afar; her face blossomed into a smile when she saw Huang Xiaolong, \u201cXiaolong, I knew you were here . Let\u2019s go, the banquet is starting soon, let\u2019s head over there now . \u201dHuang Xiaolong\u2019s head start to ache when he saw Li Lu, he turned towards Fei Hou and said: \u201cCome with me . \u201d\u201cYes, Young Master!\u201d Fei Hou replied respectfully .Although Li Lu was surprised to hear Fei Hou refer to Huang Xiaolong as Young Master, she did not think too much about it . She walked up to Huang Xiaolong and pulled his hand, running out from the yard; as if pulling Huang Xiaolong\u2019s hand had become a habit of hers .Huang Xiaolong wanted to retrieve his hand, but to his surprise, this time, the little girl gripped firmly, not letting go . He could only follow from behind . As they arrived at the banquet, they ran into Huang Peng\u2019s group who just came .When Huang Wei saw Li Lu was holding Huang Xiaolong\u2019s hand, his expression turned hideous whereas Huang Peng was giving Huang Xiaolong an ambiguous smile while giving him a thumbs up, rendering Huang Xiaolong speechless!Everyone took their seat after they entered the main hall, and Huang Qide\u2019s group seat is actually on the main table, seated together with Li Mu . Huang Xiaolong was about to sit when Li Lu came over and pulled him to a seat next to her and Fei Hou automatically stood behind Huang Xiaolong .Huang Peng, Huang Qide, and the others had noticed Fei Hou\u2019s presence behind Huang Xiaolong . They thought Huang Xiaolong bought Fei Hou yesterday at the slave\u2019s market when he was going around the city; consequently, nobody asked anything .\u201cFei Hou, find a place to seat on the sides . \u201d Seeing Fei Hou standing behind him, when the seat beside was empty didn't feel right, after all, Fei Hou was a Tenth Order Warrior .Just as he spoke, Huang Wei's spoke loudly in a haughty voice: \u201cSit? Huang Xiaolong, today is Old Patriarch Li\u2019s birthday banquet; is a slave you bought qualified to sit in here?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Huang Xiaolong, you!\u201d Huang Wei was truly offended; rage filled his heart . He possessed grade ten martial spirits, the future Lord of Huang Clan Manor, yet this Huang Xiaolong actually said he\u2019s less qualified when compared to a slave servant?At this moment, Huang Qide spoke: \u201cEnough! We are in Li Residence, Old Patriarch Li\u2019s celebration banquet!\u201dBecause his grandfather had spoken Huang Wei could only glare at Huang Xiaolong with a vengeance .Huang Qide then turned to Huang Xiaolong and said, \u201cXiaolong, is this person your newly purchased slave? He\u2019s not qualified to sit here!\u201dHuang Xiaolong\u2019s brow wrinkled, no matter what; in the end, his grandfather was still partial to Huang Wei . Ever since both of their martial spirits awakened, this has been Huang Qide\u2019s attitude .He was certain that If it weren't because Li Lu kept demanding that Huang Xiaolong comes, his grandfather Huang Qide would have brought only Huang Wei with him .Huang Qide spoke again . \u201cTell you slave servant to leave the hall, and wait in the yard . \u201dLeave? Huang Xiaolong\u2019s anger started to rise, grandfather\u2019s meaning is Fei Hou\u2019s not qualified to even stand here?\u201cXiaolong didn\u2019t you hear what your grandfather said . Quickly tell you slave servant to scram! We are at Old Patriarch Li\u2019s celebration banquet, you bringing over a slave servant, are you trying exhibit yourself?\u201d Huang Ming added in an admonishing tone .Scram? Huang Xiaolong\u2019s anger continued to rise, sneered: \u201cAlthough my servant is new, but it\u2019s not for you order him around!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Huang Ming didn\u2019t expect an event like this where Huang Xiaolong would actually contradict him; his eyes bulged so in anger much they almost fell out .\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Xiaolong . \u201d Huang Peng said . \u201cObey your grandfather\u2019s instruction, let him return to the yard . \u201d Even though Huang Peng agreed with his father, Huang Qide and Huang Ming\u2019s words were excessive, but he also felt that his son bringing a slave servant on such an occasion was not appropriate .Huang Xiaolong was taken aback, suppressing the anger, he nodded and said to Fei Hou behind him: \u201cFei Hou, go back and wait for me . \u201dWhile the conversation took place, Fei Hou\u2019s expression was calm, \u201cYes, Young Master . \u201d He saluted respectfully after saying that, turned around and left .Huang Wei was feeling proud seeing that Fei Hou was ordered to leave .Li Lu who was sitting beside Huang Xiaolong glared at Huang Wei when she saw his satisfied expression .Suddenly, loud laughter erupted from outside the hall; it was Old Patriarch Li . Everyone in the Main Hall looked out and saw Li Mu, Li Cheng and their other guests walking towards the Main Hall under the protection of experts .Seeing them, everyone got up .However, as the group of merry people were about to step into the Main Hall, suddenly an anxious cry was heard: \u201cOld Patriarch, it\u2019s bad! Something bad happened!\u201dThe voice was abrupt, and the laughter filled hall became silent; Li Mu was startled as he turned around to look, others did the same .A flustered residential guard ran in looking frightened; the guard panted heavily as he reached Li Mu and Li Cheng, his finger pointed towards the main entrance and with a shaky voice said, \u201cOld Patriarch, outside, outside!\u201d\u201cOutside? What happened outside?\u201d A sinking feeling crept into Li Mu\u2019s heart, and he almost shouted his question .\u201cOutside, there is a huge coffin placed outside!\u201d The Li Residence\u2019s guard said in a quivering voice .\u201cWhat? A huge coffin!\u201d\u201cWhat is the matter?!\u201dInside the Main Hall, all the Patriarch and experts that came to congratulate Old Patriarch Li were shocked, and whispers circulated the hall .Li Mu\u2019s heart skipped a beat; his expression became solemn, and he said: \u201cGo!\u201d After speaking, Li Mu and his son Li Cheng walked towards the main entrance of Li Residence\u2019s with quickly, while the experts of Li Residence followed closely behind them .\u201cWe will also go and have a look,\u201d said Huang Qide as he too walked out of the Main Hall, followed by Huang Xiaolong and the others, and Li Lu followed Huang Xiaolong . At her age, although she didn\u2019t understand what a huge coffin being placed in front of the main entrance on her grandfather\u2019s birthday celebration represented, she was nervous and tense .Huang Xiaolong followed his grandfather to the main entrance, looked out and saw that a huge red-colored coffin was placed directly facing the main entrance of the Li Residence .The of the coffin was dyed red with human blood and a strong scent of blood wove through the air assaulting their nose .Everyone\u2019s heart tightened watching this weird scene .Li Mu walked up to the coffin . His expression was cold as he shouted: \u201cWhich scoundrel dares to look for trouble with Li Residence? Get out here!\u201d When Li Mu shouted, the surrounding air rolled like waves, forming a large lion in midair; the lion roared endlessly .Everyone was surprised and a look of awe apparent in their expression .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes glimmered . His father told him before about the battle skill that Li Mu practiced, is this the middle grade, Mysterious rank battle skill \u2013 Sky Lion Roar?Moments later, the lion in the sky dissipated, and there was quiet .\u201cHey hey!\u201d A snicker sounded in the air, from all direction confusing everyone as to the source of the voice . \u201cOld Man Li, today is your eightieth birthday thus we prepared this big gift for you, you should be happy . Why are you angry? A bad temper usually leads to a short life!\u201dLi Mu flew up, with a loud shout his palm struck out; releasing many palm prints which rotated to form an enormous wind storm, swirling up as clouds became faintly visible .\u201cWindcloud Palm . \u201dThe massive windstorm created by the palm prints fell on a government building in front, and suddenly a muted green fist print pierced through the air and collided head-on with Li Mu\u2019s palm print . A loud deafening explosion resounded as the two energies collided . Two muted green silhouettes appeared in midair above the government building as they stood in midair . Huang Xiaolong and everyone else looked at the two figures; their bodies were actually covered in scaled like a snake, with black eyes, their faces covered with green stripes and a long snake-like tail attached to their backs .\u201cSoul Transformation!\u201d Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes narrowed .When a warrior reaches the Seventh Order, their martial spirits experience a second evolution which allows the warrior's body to integrate with their martial spirits . This ability is called Soul Transformation . After transformation, the warrior possesses the innate ability of his martial spirits . For instance, if a person\u2019s martial spirit is a poisonous snake, then after Soul Transformation the battle qi in the warrior\u2019s body will contain a certain amount of poison .Clearly, the martial spirits of these two were some type of snake, and from the looks of it, most probably poisonous snakes .\u201cHey Hey, Old Man Li, your Windcloud Palm is only so-so!\u201d\u201cWe won\u2019t be killing you now; but within three years, we\u2019ll definitely take your dog-life!\u201d\u201cOpen the coffin and see our birthday present to you!\u201dBoth of them smirked, and their bodies became shrouded in a muted green glow, then disappeared in a flash right in front of everybody .Li Mu didn\u2019t expect the other party to flee the moment they appeared, so by the time he regained his senses and wanted to pursue, it was already too late .\u201cDad!\u201d Li Cheng walked up to Li Mu moments later . He then looked at the sealed coffin and asked, \u201cShould we open it?\u201dLi Mu turned around, inhaled deeply, and said: \u201cOpen it!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His palm hit the coffin cover, and it flew away revealing the dead body of a sixteen to seventeen-year-old boy!The color of the boy\u2019s skin had turned to a muted green, so dark that it looked almost black .When Li Cheng got a clear look at the youth\u2019s face, his entire body trembled and\u00a0his eyes became red-rimmed as\u00a0tears fell from his face . \u201cFeng\u2019er! My Feng\u2019er!\u201d Li Cheng carried the boy\u2019s body out of the coffin and hugged him tightly .\u201cMy Feng\u2019er!\u201d\u201cYou cannot die, Feng\u2019er!\"Li Cheng\u2019s mournful wails were heart wrenching .And when Li Mu saw the young boy\u2019s face, tears fell from his face . He stood there and cried, no longer caring\u00a0about face or dignity before the crowd .\u201cBrother, Brother!\u201d At this moment, Li Lu who was standing beside Huang Xiaolong dashed out to reach the young boy, sobbing pitifully as both of her hands shook the young boy\u2019s shoulder . \u201cBrother, what\u2019s wrong with you? Brother, please wake up! I don\u2019t want you to die, I don\u2019t want to you to die!\u201d\u201cBrother, please wake up!\u201d\u201cWake up!\u201dLi Lu\u2019s sobs were choked, unable to come out .At this time, the guards, maids, and experts of the Li Residence all knelt down and cries filled the area . The young boy who died was Li Lu\u2019s brother, Li Feng and\u00a0Li Cheng\u2019s only son . Li Feng\u2019s was very talented, and\u00a0like Li Lu, he possessed top grade nine martial spirits . Three years ago, he was spotted by Distinct Cloud Sect (Chu Yun Zhong), one of the most prominent sects of Luo Tong Kingdom, and was taken as an inner court disciple . No one could have imagined that he would be killed and sent back to Li Residence as Li Mu\u2019s birthday gift!All the patriarchs of the other families and experts who were present shook their heads . They came to congratulate Old Patriarch Li on his eightieth birthday, but instead this scene unraveled before them!\u201cFeng\u2019er, this is Grandfather\u2019s fault . Grandfather harmed you!\u201d Li Mu knelt down, both of his hands trembled as he touched his grandson\u2019s face . His tears fell on on his grandson\u2019s body, but his grandson could no longer move, and could no longer hear his voice .\u201cRest assured, Grandfather definitely will avenge you! Absolutely!\u201d Determination showed in Li Mu\u2019s eyes .From afar, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes were red as he watched the scene before him .All around was silence .After a long time has passed, Li Mu carried his grandson\u2019s body into Li Residence, and everyone followed . Inside the\u00a0Li Residence, the once festive and colorful decoration with the red cloths are now offensive to the eye .The birthday banquet did not happen .And not long after, the patriarchs and experts who came to convey congratulatory wishes left . The initially festive and lively Li Residence became gloomy and deadly silent .In the end, only Huang Xiaolong\u2019s group of five were the last to remain in Li Residence .\u201cBrother Li, I\u2019m sorry for your grief . \u201d Huang Qide came beside Li Mu and said in barely a whisper . \u201cIf there\u2019s anything, all you need is to send a message, our Huang Clan Manor will be the first to assist!\u201dEven Huang Qide didn\u2019t imagine such a thing would happen; given the circumstances, it no longer made sense for them to stay any longer at Li Residence .\u201cBrother Huang, thank you!\u201d Li Mu said in a sorrowful voice .Huang Qide nodded for there\u2019s nothing more that could be said; turned around and was about to leave with Huang Xiaolong and the rest, Li Lu suddenly ran over to Huang Xiaolong, sobbing, \u201dXiaolong, don\u2019t go, okay?\u201dAll present turned to look at Huang Xiaolong .Huang Xiaolong blanked . He hesitated for a moment, and then he patted Li Lu\u2019s shoulder gently, and\u00a0said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry . I will come and visit you often . I will kill whoever is responsible\u00a0 and avenge your brother . \u201dHearing Huang Xiaolong\u2019s words, everyone smiled while shaking their heads; they took his words as something na\u00efve children would say, and none of them took Huang Xiaolong\u2019s words seriously . Even Li Mu wasn\u2019t confident to kill the other party, not to say an eight-year-old child?\u201cThen you definitely must come and see me . \u201d Li Lu said as tears ran down her face .Huang Xiaolong could only nod .Li Mu got up and personally saw Huang Xiaolong\u2019s group out of the Li Residence and only went back in when the five silhouettes vanished .By evening, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s group of five reached Huang Clan Manor .Huang Xiaolong did not practice that night . He stood on a peak in the back mountain, looking at the twinkling stars in the evening sky .Two meters behind Huang Xiaolong, stood Fei Hou, keeping watch .Out of nowhere, Huang Xiaolong suddenly asked,\u201cFei Hou, when people die, do you think they will become a star in the night sky?\u201dFei Hou was\u00a0stunned, for he didn\u2019t expect Huang Xiaolong would ask such a question . \u201cStars in the night sky?\u201d\u201cIn my previous hometown, someone once said that when a person dies, they become a star in the night sky to protect their loved ones . \u201d Huang Xiaolong explained softly .\u201cBecome a star in the night sky? To protect their loved ones?\u201d Fei Hou shook his head, smiled . \u201cIn this world, only those with power and strength can guard and protect their loved ones . \u201d\u201cPower and strength!\u201d Huang Xiaolong repeated .\u201cYes, power and strength!\u201d Fei Hou nodded .That\u2019s right, power and strength!\u00a0Huang Xiaolong clenched his fists tightly . Under the night sky, his eyes shone like the stars\u2013 only the strong have the power to guard and protect loved ones .He must become strong! He had to grow stronger quickly!Only this way he could guard and protect his loved ones!An invisible aura emanated from Huang Xiaolong, scaring Fei Hou .\u201cLet\u2019s go back!\u201d Huang Xiaolong said lightly a moment later while withdrawing the aura emanating from his body . \u00a0He turned around and headed downwards towards Huang Clan Manor and Fei Hou followed .Once back at Huang Clan Manor, Huang Xiaolong took out the cold jade bed, sat down, and started practicing Asura Tactics as the\u00a0spiritual aura from the netherworld gushed down like an endless waterfall .\u2026\u2026Time flies and quickly\u00a0ten months went by .Huang Peng noticed that his son had increased his effort in training ever since he came back from Li Residence . Every day, his son stayed inside the small courtyard to practice, hardly stepping out . His parents' hearts ached to see their son\u2019s crazed training regimen, so they decided to go to the small courtyard and visit Huang Xiaolong .In the past ten months, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s battle qi increased at a monstrous rate . Half a month after he came back from Li Residence, he advanced to mid-Fourth Order from peak early-Fourth Order, and two months later, late-Fourth Order .After ten months, not only did Huang Xiaolong breakthrough to the\u00a0Fifth Order, he actually advanced to peak late-Fifth Order!As for the Body Metamorphose Scripture, he had reached the fifth stage \u2013 Power to Haul Nine Bulls Like One .This morning, the weather was\u00a0sunny . At the back mountain, Huang Xiaolong swung his blades and a hundred rays of light appeared, forming\u00a0two five meters tall cyclones circling nonstop . As Tempest of Hell rotates, every tree and bush in its path were cut into a\u00a0hundred pieces, when\u00a0suddenly the two cyclones swerved to the left, and then swerved again to the right!In ten months, not only had Tempest of Hell\u2019s power increased ten times, but Huang Xiaolong could already control the direction according to his will . Now, his Tempest of Hell could last twelve to thirteen breaths of time .\u201cTempest of Hell has reached major completion and now it only lacks power!\u201d Huang Xiaolong mumbled to himself as he surveyed the surrounding . He has already grasped the mood of Tempest of Hell and its power will continue to increase along with\u00a0his battle qi .It states on that piece of paper, once there was someone who used this move, it\u00a0would annihilate everything within a ten thousand li radius and not even a blade of grass would survive!\u201cThere are only twenty more days to the next Clan Assembly . \u201d Huang Xiaolong thought to himself as he recalled Blades of Asura and they flew back into his arms .Note:For Chinese, red represents luck, fortune, happiness\u2026 . whereby in funerals black and/or white are dominant .If you\u2019re saying six people (iFei Hou)instead of five returned to Huang Clan Manor, I hear you .

He knows Huang Xiaolong trains at the back mountain and will come back around this hour; thus, he waits here in the courtyard .Huang Xiaolong nodded as he walked into the courtyard, and asked, \u201cHow is your Luohan Sword practice progressing?\u201d Five months ago, Fei Hou\u2019s broken veins had recovered and Huang Xiaolong taught him\u00a0the Luohan Sword\u00a0skill .\u201cReplying Sovereign, your subordinate has trained up to the tenth move . \u201d Fei Hou replied respectfully with heartfelt gratitude . Sovereign not only healed his broken veins, but he also taught him a high-grade \u2018battle skill\u2019, the\u00a0Luohan Sword . In these four months, his cultivation even advanced after his broken veins were reconnected .\u201cThe tenth move,\u201d Huang Xiaolong nodded satisfactorily . In less than half a year this Fei Hou had reached the tenth move .\u201cZhi Zhi-Zhi!\u201d When Huang Xiaolong entered the small courtyard, something small leapt at him from out of nowhere and landed on his shoulder . Huang Xiaolong did not dodge, for it was the Violet Spirit Devourer Monkey .A year had passed, but there were no changes to the little violet monkey . However, although there were no physical changes to the little violet monkey, its cultivation speed was\u00a0even more terrifying than Huang Xiaolong\u2019s . Despite the fact that he\u2019s a peak late-Fifth Order, without the use of Asura Sword Skill, he couldn\u2019t injure the little violet monkey .\u201cLittle guy, did you go hunting these past\u00a0few days?\u201d Huang Xiaolong laughed as he looked at the little violet monkey on his shoulder . The little monkey\u2019s quick rise in cultivation was\u00a0all due to the beast core he swallowed from killing wicked beasts; its speed made even Huang Xiaolong who possessed superb talent twin martial spirits feels envious of its ability to increase cultivation by consuming beast cores .Hearing Huang Xiaolong's question, the little violet monkey gestured with its two little hands, and then it squeaked cheerfully with pride at Huang Xiaolong, showing off its harvest from hunting wicked beasts these past few days .Watching the little monkey\u2019s cute antics, Huang Xiaolong smiled . \u201cOkay, okay little guy, I admit you\u2019re very powerful all right . \u201dThe little violet monkey nodded its head, which meant \u2018of course\u2019 .Huang Xiaolong shook his head, told the little violet monkey to play on its own while he sparred with Fei Hou using the\u00a0Execute Demon Sword . No doubt, Fei Hou repressed his strength at peak late-Fifth Order .In the past two months,\u00a0Huang Xiaolong\u2019s fighting experience had increased a whole lot as he sparred continuously with Fei Hou who was a Tenth Order warrior .But, the little violet monkey that Huang Xiaolong sent away suddenly ran back, leapt towards Fei Hou and attacked him .Thus, the scene changed from two people sparring to two people and a monkey sparring . Huang Xiaolong attacked the little violet monkey, the little violet monkey attacked Fei Hou and in turn, Fei Hou attacked Huang Xiaolong . Sometimes, Huang Xiaolong and the little violet monkey would attack Fei Hou together .The entire small yard was fill with flashes of swords and monkey claws .The little violet monkey\u2019s claws are extremely sharp, comparable to a sacred-grade weapon . Fei Hou faced extreme pressure against two opponents, especially with his cultivation repressed at peak late-Fifth Order, and in a moment of carelessness, he was scratched by monkey claws; he could only grin despite the pain .With the presence of Fei Hou and the little violet monkey, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s training days weren\u2019t dull and boring .Very quickly, twenty days passed .It was now\u00a0the end of the year .Just like last year, inside the Huang Clan Manor were decorations of festive trinkets and colorful lanterns . Everywhere,\u00a0the guards, maids, and servants were busy, full of festive cheer .\u201cTomorrow is the annual Clan Assembly!\u201d Huang Xiaolong stood in the middle of the small yard watching pure white snow float down . His hand reached out to catch a snowflake, feeling the cold as a snowflake lands on his palm; Huang Xiaolong remembered that it had been three years since the last time it last snowed . He loves the sunshine, and he also loves when it snows and blankets the world in white as if covering the ugliness of the world .Fei Hou stood two meters away from Huang Xiaolong, guarding silently .\u201cWonder what Li Lu\u2019s doing now?\u201d Huang Xiaolong thought inside his heart .From the time they returned from the Li Residence, Huang Xiaolong and Huang Peng visited the Li Residence twice . Ever since that banquet incident, Li Lu became taciturn and immersed herself in practice just like Huang Xiaolong .Snow continued to fall, and just moments later, Huang Xiaolong was entirely covered in snow .With a small shake, the accumulated snow fell to the ground and\u00a0he turned around and left the small yard, heading towards Eastern Courtyard together with Fei Hou .As he entered the Eastern Courtyard, he heard his mother, Su Yan, sobbing . He walked faster and went into the hall . He saw Su Yan hugging his sister, Huang Min, and his brother, Huang Xiaohai, with her eyes red from crying . And his father sat on the side, his\u00a0face full of anger .On his sister\u2019s face, there were two clear, burning red palm marks and the corner of his little brother\u2019s lips was split, with blood trickling down and\u00a0both of his eyes were swollen and black . Evidently, he was beaten .\u201cWho hit you both?\u201d Huang Xiaolong\u2019s anger rose as he looked towards\u00a0his little sister and brother .\u201cWho else but that Huang Wei!\u201d Su Yan cried .\u201cHuang Wei!\u201d An icy chill flashed across Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes . Sure enough, apart from Huang Wei, within the\u00a0Huang Clan Manor, who else would dare to beat Second Manor Lord\u2019s children!\u201cToday, Xiaohai and I went to play in the west yard . On the way back, we ran into Huang Wei and Zhou Xuedong\u2019s group; they said we blocked his path and hit us!\u201d Huang Min cried .Su Yan continued . \u201cAfter he hit Huang Min and Xiaohai, he even stripped off their clothes!\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d Huang Xiaolong raised his voice as\u00a0killing intent seeded in his heart .In such cold weather with snow falling,\u00a0since\u00a0both of them possessed no have battle qi,\u00a0if\u00a0both his sister and brother were\u00a0stripped of their clothes, they could have frozen to death!\u201cBig Brother, Huang Wei wanted me to pass a message to you: he said tomorrow at the Clan Assembly, he\u2019ll let you \u2018look good\u2019!\u201d Huang Min conveyed the message to Huang Xiaolong .\u201cWants me to \u2018look good\u2019?\u201d Huang Xiaolong suppressed the killing intent in his heart . Since tomorrow\u2019s the assembly, then he\u2019ll let Huang Wei enjoy one more day .One night passed .Snow had stopped falling .The sky brightened in the absence of sunlight . Huang Xiaolong stopped his training and left the small courtyard with Fei Hou, heading towards Eastern Courtyard .When they reached the Main Foyer, most of the elders, housekeepers and disciples had already arrived . Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes scanned the Main Hall and saw that both father and son, Huang Ming and Huang Wei were\u00a0already there .Note:Luohan Sword Skill \u2013 Using pinyin here cause I can\u2019t find an appropriate sub .

The corner of Huang Wei\u2019s mouth stretched into a disdainful\u00a0sneer, and his eyes were brimming with hatred .Ever since they came back from the\u00a0Li Residence, Huang Wei's hatred towards Huang Xiaolong increased every day . Every time he recalled the scene of Li Lu holding Huang Xiaolong\u2019s hands right in front of him, asking Huang Xiaolong not to leave, he wished he could gnaw on Huang Xiaolong\u2019s flesh and drink his blood .Their gazes collided and shifted away .Huang Xiaolong, his father, and mother sat across Huang Ming, father and son .A short while later, Grandfather Huang Qide arrived .Seeing his Grandfather appear again at this year\u2019s Clan Assembly, Huang Xiaolong already knew\u00a0why . In spite of the fact that\u00a0he trained Huang Wei wholeheartedly, at last year\u2019s Clan Assembly,\u00a0Xiaolong beat up Huang Wei ruthlessly, and\u00a0it more or less blemished his reputation .This time, most likely, he wanted to see Huang Wei return the favor so that his reputation would\u00a0remain untarnished .Everyone stood up to salute as Huang Qide walked towards the main podium .\u201cEn, everyone sit down . \u201d Huang Qide\u2019s face was full of smiles as he waved his hand to indicate everyone to sit .And everyone sat down .Same as last year, Chief Housekeeper Chen Ying stood up to oversee the event . After he had received Huang Qide\u2019s nod of approval, he declared loudly . \u201cThe Annual Assembly begins!\u201dAnnual Clan Assembly begins!For a moment, the Main Foyer was\u00a0silent . Then, one by one, the disciples who had awakened their martial spirits this year went up the stage to spar with each other .And those who had awakened their martial spirits last year were to wait for the new disciples to finish before they can go up the martial stage .No one was really paying attention to the spar between this year\u2019s disciples who just awakened their martial spirits not too long ago; it was clear they were looking forward to the fight between Huang Wei and Huang Xiaolong .Last year, Huang Wei as Huang Clan Manor\u2019s most talented person, the person that the Old Manor Lord trained with dedication was severely walloped by Huang Xiaolong, what would happen this year?Huang Qide too was filled with expectation as he seated upon the main podium .Under the crowd\u2019s expectation, the first batch of disciples finished .Once again the Main Foyer were strangely quiet for a moment . Almost at the same time, all looked towards\u00a0Huang Wei and Huang Xiaolong .What differed from last year was, this time Huang Xiaolong stood up first, and slowly walked up to the martial stage at the center .Seeing it was Huang Xiaolong who first went to the stage, the crowd felt a little strange .Standing tall on the martial stage, Huang Xiaolong looked at Huang Wei, in a cold voice said, \u201cWhat? Afraid to come up?\u201dHuang Wei jumped up in anger, with a sarcastic \u2018haha\u2019 laugh, he leaped onto the martial stage . As he stood across Huang Xiaolong, \u201cMe, afraid to come up? That\u2019s the funniest joke under the heavens! Last time you ambushed me, and were lucky enough to win by half a move, do you think you will be fortunate again this year?\u201dThe entire hall was silent as his words rang out .Weird expressions swept through the crowd .Ambush? Lucky enough to win by half a move?Huang Xiaolong didn\u2019t expect this Huang Wei\u2019s skin is thick to this extent .Huang Wei ignored the weird stares thrown at him, turned his head towards Huang Qide and said, \u201cGrandfather, according to Assembly\u2019s rules during the sparring event no one is allowed to interfere, correct?\u201dHe looked at Huang Peng when he finished saying this; his meaning was written all over his face\u2013 he\u2019s afraid Huang Peng couldn\u2019t control himself and interfere if\u00a0Huang Xiaolong was\u00a0beaten half to\u00a0death .\u201cYes, no matter who it is, no one is allowed to interfere!\u201d Huang Qide nodded as he said with a decisive tone, not to be doubted . When all who were\u00a0present heard this, they realized this is the\u00a0Old Manor Lord's\u00a0warning to\u00a0Huang Peng .How could Huang Peng and Su Yan not realize what Huang Qide\u2019s words meant? Even though they were angered, they were mostly\u00a0worried about their son .Huang Wei calmed down after he got Grandfather\u2019s assurance . A blood-thirsty light flashed across his eyes as turned around to look at Huang Xiaolong . The anger and hatred that he had been suppressing for the past year broke out completely .\u201cHuang Xiaolong, today I will show you the difference between grade ten martial spirits and grade seven martial spirits! I will let you see how far my terrifying strength has reached!\u201d Huang Wei said in a low voice as his battle qi broke out like flash flood, exhibiting his strength before all those\u00a0present\u00a0and\u00a0at the same time, his martial spirit, the\u00a0Three-Eyed Black Tiger appeared behind him .Compared to last year, it had grown two-thirds bigger, black rays glimmered on its body, and it\u00a0emanated the coercion of a Xiantian .\u201cSuch a strong battle qi! This is Third Order, no, peak mid-Third Order! God, it\u2019s actually the peak of the\u00a0mid-Third Order!\u201d\u201cYoung Lord Huang Wei\u2019s talent defying the heavens . Within a year, he advanced from Second Order to peak mid-Third Order!\u201dEvery elder and housekeeper inside the Main Foyer were shocked with their mouths agape\u2013 some even jumped up from their seats .On the main podium, when Huang Qide saw the elders', and housekeepers' shocked faces of Huang Clan Manor when Huang Wei revealed his strength, his face was full of smiles, which turned into laughter for he couldn\u2019t resist laughing out loud .Below the stage, Huang Ming\u2019s face had already blossomed into a big smile early on, and he\u00a0nodded his head in satisfaction as he looked at his son .Revealed his strength, Huang Wei looked at Huang Xiaolong with a smirk and said in a cold tone . \u201cHuang Xiaolong, now that you\u2019ve seen the extent of my strength do you feel extreme fear?! Don\u2019t worry, fear is normal, and no one here will laugh at you! Finally, you understand the gap between our talents? The difference between us is not something your dog shit luck of three Yang fruits can make-up!\u201d\u201cFear?\u201d Huang Xiaolong looked at Huang Wei who was feeling full of himself, shook\u00a0his head and\u00a0said icily, \u201cIs this all the strength you have? Make your move, this time not only do I want to beat you until your Dad can't recognize you, but I will hit till even Grandfather can\u2019t recognize you!\u201dThe group of elders and housekeepers heard this and\u00a0each shook their heads . Not one person believed Young Lord Huang Xiaolong would emerge victorious against a peak mid-Third Order Young Master Huang Wei .And anger was apparent on Huang Qide\u2019s face, as he sat on the podium . \u00a0This grandson, Huang Xiaolong, is too presumptuous!\u201cReally?\u201d Huang Wei laughed . A hint of viciousness flitted across his eyes and his silhouette flashed and in the blink of an eye, he appeared before Huang Xiaolong . His fists punched out with all his might .\u201cXiaolong!\u201d Seeing Huang Wei\u2019s fists was about to hit Huang Xiaolong, Huang Peng, and Su Yan\u2019s face was filled with worry as they stood up from their seats . At this time, Huang Qide who was angered by Huang Xiaolong\u2019s presumptuous sentence released his aura, locking onto\u00a0his son, Huang Peng, his eyes icy as he shouted, \u201cWho dares to interfere will be dealt with according to clan rules!\u201dHowever, at this time, Huang Qide suddenly noticed that the Main Foyer had fallen into a strange silence, every elder, housekeeper and disciple were stunned with their mouths\u2019 wide open looking at the martial stage . Feeling doubt, Huang Qide turned towards the stage just like everyone . On the stage, nobody knew when\u00a0Huang Wei\u2019s fists that were about to hit Huang Xiaolong was locked and stopped midair!With Huang Qide and everyone else watching with rapt attention, Huang Xiaolong looked coldly at Huang Wei and said, \u201cI too shall let you see part of my strength!\u201dNote:By half a move/trick \u2013\u00a0 a teeny weeny bit stronger/faster . Kindly note, this expression will appear again in later chapters .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

While everyone had yet to realize what Huang Xiaolong meant, suddenly a battle qi several times stronger than Huang Wei\u2019s, as much as ten times stronger, or perhaps even more, gushed out from Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body shooting straight up\u00a0into the air .Everyone was dumbstruck and shivered as if they\u2019d seen a ghost . The elders and housekeepers jumped up from their seats as if their butts were on fire .\u201cFourth Order! He\u2019s actually a Fourth Order warrior! God, a Fourth Order warrior ah!\u201d\u201cIs this an illusion? No, it's not! This isn\u2019t an illusion!\u201d\u201cYour mother*, why are you pinching me?\u201d A disciple screamed shrilly having been pinched by the person next to him .The entire hall became speechless with shock, and some even trembled with excitement as if they have suppressed \u2018it\u2019 for too long .Huang Peng, Su Yan, and even Huang Ming\u2019s reaction was no different from the rest, they were stupefied!Huang Qide's eyes widened in shock, so great was the shock that his mind went blank as he stared at the stage, struggling to process what just happened .\u201cNo, it\u2019s impossible! You couldn\u2019t have broken through to the Fourth Order stage . It\u2019s impossible that you ran into some dog shit luck again!\u201d Huang Wei cried out as if he\u2019d lost his mind having succumbed to fear .He couldn\u2019t believe that Huang Xiaolong would be lucky enough to come across good fortune a second time and breakthrough to Fourth Order!Huang Xiaolong glanced\u00a0at the frightened Huang Wei who was shouting like a mad man, and\u00a0battle qi surged on his hands and with a loud \u2018hong\u2019, Huang Wei tumbled off the stage, wailing .With just one step, Huang Xiaolong appeared in front of Huang Wei and mercilessly stomped on Huang Wei .Huang Wei\u2019s eyes brimmed with fear and fury as he growled, \u201cI won't accept this! I am the clan\u2019s real genius! Why? Why is it that\u00a0you dog of-a-thing keep running into dog-shit luck surpassing me?\"\u201cGenius? Dog of-a-thing?\u201d Huang Xiaolong stared coldly at Huang Wei . Then, he\u00a0suddenly sent a brutal kick at Huang Wei\u2019s stomach, and\u00a0the impact and pain sent Huang Wei rolling to the edge of the stage in pain .Huang Wei moaned pitifully as he lay on the ground .At this point, the people in the audience recovered from their shock and started to react .Huang Ming\u2019s fists clenched tight as he looked at his son on the stage; his eyes gleamed with a scary coldness, but somehow, he managed to endure it .Huang Qide\u2019s eyes flickered as he looked at his grandson Huang Xiaolong\u2013 could it be like Huang Wei said, that Huang Xiaolong stumbled upon some dog-shit luck again and swallowed some elixir to advance to Fourth Order?As these thoughts crossed Huang Qide's mind, Huang Wei slowly stood up, his body quivering with the effort . His eyes burned with hatred, glaring at Huang Xiaolong he said, \u201cYou will die!\u201d as he\u00a0lunged at Huang Xiaolong like an injured beast .Watching as Huang Wei lunged at him, a cold light flickered in Huang Xiaolong's eyes and when Huang Wei was within arm\u2019s reach, he used both hands and struck Huang Wei\u2019s arms .\u201cKa-cha!\u201d The sound of broken bones rippled through the hall .Just as Huang Wei started to scream in pain, Huang Xiaolong kicked at Huang Wei\u2019s legs and the sound of broken bones echoed through the hall again .But he didn't stop there; his palms covered battle qi hit Huang Wei squarely on the chest and \u2018bang\u2019 every scrap of clothing on Huang Wei body burst into pieces .Huang Wei\u2019s body flew out of the stage and landed heavily on the ground, naked as a newborn without even a strip of clothing on him .\u201cWei\u2019er!\u201d Huang Ming\u2019s voice bellowed\u00a0with anger, he leapt up and rushed towards Huang Wei . When he got to Huang Wei, he saw his son coughing up blood nonstop and the bones of his arms and legs broken .His heart ached and became filled with fury when he saw his son\u2019s condition, he gave Huang Wei to Elder Zhou who was beside him and ordered, \u201cLook after the Young Lord!\u201d After he said that, Huang Ming turned around and leapt onto the stage, and\u00a0killing intent spilled out from his eyes as he glared at Huang Xiaolong and walked towards him, \u201cYou are very cruel!\u201dHuang Xiaolong had an indifferent expression as Huang Ming walked toward him . Earlier on, when Huang Wei threatened to break both his arms, how come Huang Ming didn\u2019t say his son was very cruel? And during last year\u2019s Clan Assembly Huang Xiaolong already spared Huang Wei once by not breaking his arms then . But, he didn\u2019t expect Huang Wei to retaliate on his sister Huang Min and little brother Huang Xiaohai!This time Huang Xiaolong would not be so lenient!Huang Xiaolong shifted his gaze towards his Grandfather on the main podium and said in an icy voice . \u201cDuring the Clan Assembly\u2019s disciple sparring no one can interfere . Otherwise, they will be dealt with according to clan\u2019s rules! Grandfather, this is what you said earlier, right?\"Huang Qide was embarrassed, but he did not answer .Seeing his reaction, Huang Xiaolong sneered and said sarcastically, \u201cWhy is it that when my dad made a move, you insisted on enforcing the clan\u2019s rules but now Huang Ming interfered and Grandfather, you are turning a blind eye? This is really fair!\u201dAll the elders and housekeepers remained silent .\u201cImpudent!\u201d Huang Qide embarrassment turned into anger and\u00a0his palm slammed onto a chair beside him .Huang Ming seeing his father\u2019s attitude stopped worrying; his icy eyes fell on Huang Xiaolong, he said: \u201cYou broke my Wei\u2019er\u2019s arms and legs, and now I will break both of your arm and legs!\u201d The battle qi of a late-Seventh Order warrior released at full scale, and he sent palm strikes at Huang Xiaolong\u2019s arms .\u201cXiaolong!\u201d Just as Huang Peng wanted to leap up the stage, another silhouette that acted faster than him . In the blink of an eye, the silhouette stood before Huang Xiaolong and used both arms to counter Huang Ming\u2019s palms .\u201cPooh!\u201d In front of everyone, Huang Ming spat out mouthfuls of blood . His body flew out from the stage and crashed onto the ground, breaking a countless number of chairs as he slid to a stop .\u201cWhat?!\u201d Eyes widened in shocked at they looked at Huang Ming, who lay on the ground, blood spurting out from his mouth, unable to lift a pinky .All eyes darted towards the silhouette that stood before Huang Xiaolong .\u201cIt\u2019s, it\u2019s him?!\u201d\u201cHim? How could it be?\u201dWhen the residents of Huang Clan Manor saw the person who blocked Huang Ming\u2019s attack, they couldn't believe it\u2019s actually the slave servant Huang Xiaolong bought?!Huang Qide, Huang Peng, Su Yan and all present almost dropped their eyes .Since he was able to counter Huang Ming\u2019s attack with just one move, this man definitely had the strength of an Eighth Order warrior!Eighth Order!Fei Hou turned towards Huang Xiaolong and respectfully asked, \u2018Young Master, are you alright?\u201dHuang Xiaolong nodded . \u201cI'm alright . \u201d When he said that, he looked at Huang Ming who was struggling to get up using a chair as a crutch . His eyes burned with hatred but there's also fear .\u201cDad!\u201d Huang Ming called out, his voice sounded hoarse, and without warning, coughed up another mouthful of blood .Huang Qide jolted out of his shock and flew onto the stage, his was voice calm, as his eyes bored into Fei Hou . \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that you were\u00a0a hidden master, but your\u00a0actions are an insult, not putting our Huang Clan Manor in your eyes, you injured my child right in front of me!\"Huang Qide conveniently overlooked the truth! If wasn't for Huang Ming breaking clan\u2019s rules, and then insisted to cripple Huang Xiaolong\u2019s arms and legs, why would\u00a0Fei Hou have acted? And yet he stood there and made it seem that it was all Fei Hou\u2019s fault .Fei Hou ignored Huang Qide, indifferent and silent he stood guard behind Huang Xiaolong .Huang Qide, seeing that Fei Hou ignored him, became angry and he shouted, \u201cSpeak? What is your purpose lurking for within my Huang Clan Manor? If you speak up now, I will have mercy, and spare your life . Otherwise, it will be hard even to wish for death to come!\"Even though Fei Hou had injured Huang Ming with a single palm strike, Huang Qide wasn't perturbed; he felt that although Fei Hou was not weak, at most, he\u2019d only be a late-Eighth Order warrior .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Huang Qide\u2019s arms grew bigger by a fold and golden-colored hair grew on his skin and face .Soul Transformation!Huang Qide\u2019s martial spirit was the Six-Winged Golden Ape; as Huang Qide merged with his martial spirit . His body enlarged and grew by half a meter taller . His eyes turned a golden-red, and the atmosphere around him became violent and tyrannical .Apparently, Fei Hou repeatedly ignoring him in the presence of Huang Clan Manor\u2019s residents had truly angered him . Otherwise, he wouldn't have transformed first before dealing with Fei Hou .\u201cAbsolute Bestial Palm!\u201d Huang Qide\u2019s roar came out hoarse and thick . His body lunged towards Fei Hou with his palms extended outwards; A bright, glaring light shone, and the roar of desperate beasts echoed in the hall .Absolute Bestial Palm is a high-grade Mysterious Rank battle skill; one of three treasured battle skills owned by Huang Clan ManorBecause Fei Hou was standing behind Huang Xiaolong, Huang Qide\u2019s aggressive attack would affect even Huang Xiaolong, and if Huang Xiaolong were pulled into the tide of battle, he would suffer severe injuries due to the gap in power . Seeing that his Grandfather chose to ignore his safety just to kill Fei Hou, he became furious .Initially Fei Hou hesitated to attack because of Huang Qide status as Huang Xiaolong\u2019s Grandfather; however, suddenly he heard Huang Xiaolong\u2019s cold voice say, \u201cFull power attack!\u201dFei Hou was dazed for a moment, but he understood Huang Xiaolong\u2019s intention thus no longer held back\u2013 his oppressive battle qi of a Tenth Order warrior gushed out, causing everyone to tremble where they stood . This level of oppression is not something Huang Qide, an early Tenth Order had .Fei Hou\u2019s expression became sharp and his fists punched out .\u201cHeart-Shattering Fist!\u201dThe Heart-Shattering Fist attack cut across the distance accompanied by a sharp whistling wind and collided with Huang Qide\u2019s hand print .The terrifying aftershock energy from the impact spread outwards in all directions and the force shook the pillars of the hall so much so that the Elders and housekeepers nearby had to quickly retreat, as the wave of impact blasted rows of chairs and sent them flying .Huang Qide was pushed back for more than a dozen steps before he managed to steady himself at the edge of the stage .\u201cWa!\u201d Warm liquid flowed up his throat and blood spewed from Huang Qide\u2019s mouth .Huang Clan Manor\u2019s number one expert, Huang Qide lost! Thoroughly lost!Everyone was stunned!\u201cDad!\u201d\u201cOld Manor Lord!\u201dIt was a few breaths later before anyone reacted, some of them quickly rushed towards Huang Qide while others exclaimed out loud .Huang Qide waved his hand to indicate that he was okay then he turned to look at Fei Hou\u2013 it was hard to hide the horror in his eyes as he slowly uttered each word: \u201cPeak of late-Tenth Order!\u201d\u201cPeak of late-Tenth Order?!\u201d The elders, housekeepers, and disciples looked at Fei Hou with shock, fear, and some other feelings mixed in; however, Huang Ming's body stiffened as he became overwhelmed with fear .Above the Seventh Order, every small breakthrough represented a great difference in strength .Although Huang Qide was a Tenth Order warrior, he was an early Tenth Order; there was a huge difference in power between an early Tenth Order and a peak late-Tenth Order . Which is why, although Fei Hou did not release his martial spirit nor did he undergo a soul transformation, he could still easily defeat Huang Qide .Fei Hou stopped attacking after he repelled Huang Qide and he retreated behind Huang Xiaolong, standing there respectfully with his oppressive aura erased .Seeing Fei Hou\u2019s action, everyone turned to look at Huang Xiaolong, the eight-year-old child that they had ignored and forgotten .Evidently, Fei Hou wasn\u2019t a slave servant bought by Huang Xiaolong; but, why would a peak late-Tenth Order warrior refer to an eight-year-old child as Young Master? And with so much respect?Did Huang Xiaolong run into some dog-shit luck again, what did he swallow to breakthrough to Fourth Order?! Even if it was something more valuable than a Yang fruit, it still shouldn\u2019t have the ability to cannot make a person advance two orders in a year\u2019s time! Moreover, Huang Xiaolong had earlier said that this was only part of strength, if so, what is his real strength?If it wasn't some unbelievable dog-shit luck, then how horrible must Huang Xiaolong's talent to be to go beyond Fourth Order in less than two years?!In just a few short moments, many thoughts flashed across the minds of everyone who was present . Even Huang Peng and Su Yan had many questions .\u201cHuang Xiaolong, you actually ordered an outsider to injure Grandfather, how unfilial!\u201d roared, Huang Wei who had just woken up after being treated by some of the elders \u201cIs the Huang Clan Manor in your eyes? Do you still acknowledge your Grandfather?\u201dAll around, expressions tightened .Who would believe that a child word carries no harm, even in this dire situation Huang Wei still dared to admonish Huang Xiaolong, who was protected by a strong warrior like Fei Hou .Huang Ming, so anxious that Huang Wei\u2019s words would worsen the situation immediately turned around and scolded his son: \u201cHuang Wei shut your mouth!\u201dBut instead, Huang Wei\u2019s voice grew even louder . \u201cDad, what\u2019re you afraid of? So what if he\u2019s a peak late-Tenth Order? Our Huang Clan Manor has several thousand people, why should we be afraid of one person?\u201d Huang Wei hollered, and said to Huang Qide, \u201cGrandfather, this unfilial descendant Huang Xiaolong should have his cultivation destroyed and driven out of Huang Clan Manor!\u201dHuang Qide had yet to say anything, but Huang Ming shouted angrily, \u201cShut up!\u201d and pushed him back, anxious to stop his son from talking .Listening to Huang Wei's gripe in anger, a cold smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong\u2019s face . \u201cI didn\u2019t treat him as my Grandfather? Did he treat me as his grandson?\u201d His finger pointed at Huang Qide .\u201cI won first place at last year\u2019s competition, yet contrary to the rules, when the Spirit Pool opened he allowed you to practice in the pool instead!\u201d\u201cAt this year\u2019s competition, when Huang Ming broke the rules and intended to cripple my hands and feet, he turned a blind eye!\u201d\u201cAnd just now, if it weren\u2019t for Fei Hou\u2019s strength, both Fei Hou and I would have suffered serious injuries, and probably died under his attack!\u201dHuang Xiaolong listed each point in a bone-chilling voice .When he heard Huang Xiaolong\u2019s words, Huang Qide lowered his head and avoided Huang Xiaolong\u2019s gaze .The hall became so silent even a pin drop would be heard .Huang Wei was relentless, \u201cHuang Xiaolong, what qualification do you have to complain about Grandfather? I possess a tenth grade martial spirit and yours is only a measly grade seven spirit . Therefore, it makes sense that he would prefer me, and train me because I am Huang Clan Manor\u2019s future! What is wrong with that? You\u2019re just jealous of me! Jealous!\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d Huang Qide\u2019s palm fiercely struck Huang Wei\u2019s face .Earlier his father had hit him, and now Huang Wei couldn\u2019t believe that even his Grandfather Huang Qide slapped him . Tears rolled down his face, and he felt wronged, what did he say that was wrong? He wasn\u2019t wrong!The elders and housekeepers shook their heads secretly after hearing Huang Wei\u2019s delusional logic .\u201cDad, Mom, let\u2019s leave . \u201d At this point, Huang Xiaolong spoke up . He then turned around and walked away with Fei Hou, Huang Pend, and Su Yan, ignoring the looks directed at them followed . There was no longer any point to their staying .According to the clan\u2019s rules, no one was allowed to leave before the Clan Assembly is over . However, no one dared to stop them from leaving .Huang Qide had a complicated expression on his face as he watched Huang Xiaolong's receding silhouette .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He left the hall half carried by Elder Zhou Guang and a little while later the hall was empty .This is the first time since Huang Clan Manor's established that a Clan Assembly ended midway .After leaving the hall, Huang Xiaolong returned to his courtyard . Not too long afterward his parents came to his little courtyard . Seeing his parents arrive, he knew that they would have many questions, so without waiting for them to speak, he said, \u201cDad, Mom, I know you have many questions, but there are some things that I can\u2019t explain to you right now . \u201dHuang Peng and Su Yan exchanged a look when they heard this .\u201cXiaolong, who is senior Fei Hou?\u201d Huang Peng asked after a short pause .Senior Fei Hou?\u00a0Huang Xiaolong replied after he pondered for a moment . Then said, \u201cI became the disciple of an extraordinary person, and Fei Hou is his subordinate, so he calls me Young Master . \u201dHuang Xiaolong did not mention Ren Wokuang and Asura\u2019s Gate .Huang Peng and Su Yan finally understood, and were overjoyed that their son was able to become the disciple of such a great Master; if Fei Hou is a peak late-Tenth Order expert, what of his Master?Thinking about this, their body quivered with excitement .\u201cXiaolong, has your current strength gotten to the mid-Fourth Order level?\u201d Su Yan asked some moments later, both of them looked at their son expectantly .On the stage, Huang Xiaolong said Fourth Order was only a part of his strength .\u201cMid-Fourth Order?\u201d Huang Xiaolong was startled for a moment, in the end, he nodded, confirming their suspicion . It was better that they thought of him as being at mid-Fourth Order if they knew he was actually at the peak late-Fifth Order they would be frightened .Seeing that their son confirm that his strength was at mid-Fourth Order, their hearts almost flipped for joy, but even so, they were shocked mid-Fourth Order! Their son had actually reached mid-Fourth Order!\u201cDad, Mom, two days after the New Year celebration, I have decided to leave Huang Clan Manor, to gain experience outside!\u201d Huang Xiaolong said firmly leaving no room for debate .\u201cWhat? Gain experience?\u201d Huang Peng and Su Yan were surprised and almost shouted in unison, \u201cNo!\u201dHuang Xiaolong opened his mouth and said, \u201cI know that you are worried, but with Fei Hou coming along with I won\u2019t be in any danger . \u201d\u201cXiaolong, I know you want to leave Huang Clan Manor this instant because of your Grandfather's actions, but no matter what, he still is your Grandfather . Don\u2019t hate him . Besides you\u2019re still too young, why don\u2019t you wait another two years before leaving?\u201d Huang Peng used a gentle tone as he tried to dissuade Huang Xiaolong .Even though there is a Tenth Order warrior with Huang Xiaolong, he is still too young \u2013 not even nine years old! Huang Peng and Su Yan wouldn\u2019t be able to stop worrying if they allowed Huang Xiaolong to leave!\u201cDad, Mom, I have decided . And I will leave after the New Year . \u201d Huang Xiaolong shook his head; his eyes were resolute . It was true that he wanted to leave Huang Clan Manor at this very moment because he didn't want to have to see his Grandfather nor Eldest Uncle Huang Ming, the pair of father and son . But his wanting to go out and gain experience was not entirely due to them .He wanted to hone himself so that he would become stronger and also explore the world outside of Huang Clan Manor and meet with experts .Seeing their son\u2019s expression, Huang Peng and Su Yan\u2019s sighed\u2013 they both knew it was useless to continue trying to persuade him .Thinking about how her son was going to leave home and travel to distant places, Su Yan\u2019s heart ached, and her eyes become red . \u201cXiaolong, when will you return?\u201dA trace of warmth spread across Huang Xiaolong\u2019s heart, and smiled and said, \u201cMom, rest assured, before next year\u2019s Clan Assembly, your son will definitely come back to see you . \u201d\u201cNext year\u2019s Clan Assembly?\u201d Only then did Su Yan feel better . Su Yan continued to \u2018nag\u2019 Huang Xiaolong for quite some time; she kept reminding him to be careful while traveling and to take care of his body and to be careful of bad people, etc .Huang Xiaolong nodded throughout, unable to refuse her .Two hours later, his parents finally left .\u201cFei Hou, we will be leaving two days later after the New Year . Prepare the necessary things that we need to take with us . \u201d Huang Xiaolong ordered Fei Hou after his parents left .\u201cYes, Sovereign!\u201dThe night passed without incident .On the cold jade bed, Huang Xiaolong stopped practicing Asura Tactics and gazed at the coming dawn sky through the window . He walked out to the small yard and started practicing Tempest of Hell .\u201cTempest of Hell has already reached major completion; it only lacks power, but that will increase with my battle qi . The next step is to practice Asura Sword Skill's second style . \u201d An hour later, Huang Xiaolong stopped practicing Tempest of Hell .He retrieved a piece of paper from the ring and studied the diagram of the second style .Asura Sword Skill, Second Style: Tears of Asura .Tears of Asura? This name is really unique . \u00a0Huang Xiaolong circulated his battle qi according to the diagram, the Blades of Asura had already been called out . He leaped into midair and launched an attack, and from midair, a ray of light fell to the ground . That\u2019s right; it fell just like a tear drop falling to the ground .The first style, Tempest of Hell attacked from the ground . However, the second style could only be used while one is in the air .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body floated to the ground after his first attempt . He stood still on the ground, remembering the movements and how it felt when he launched a string using Tears of Asura . He stood there for half an hour then made his second attempt .This time, the ray of light from the blades was softer, as if weightless, akin to a tiny drop of rain .Another half an hour had passed before Huang Xiaolong made the third attempt .And just like when he first started practicing Tempest of Hell, after each attempt, he would stand still for at least half an hour before trying again .As Huang Xiaolong immersed himself in practice, the sky gradually turned dark .He shook his head as his body floated down from midair; although with one day\u2019s worth of practice the power of the attack had increased quite a bit compared to the first time, but he had yet to reach minor completion . According to the illustration, when Tears of Asura produces the sound of cries, then it would be considered as having reached minor completion .The entire time while Huang Xiaolong was practicing, Fei Hou stood silently outside the small courtyard .The truth is, Asura Sword Skill and Claws of Asura were exclusive to those who practiced Asura Tactics; therefore, Huang Xiaolong wasn\u2019t worried that either Fei Hou nor anyone else would try to learn it in secret .Just as Huang Xiaolong finished his Tears of Asura practice, the sounds of footsteps echoed outside of the small courtyard . When he turned to look, he saw that the people approaching were his Grandfather Huang Qide, Eldest Uncle Huang Ming, and they were accompanied by his father, Huang Peng .Huang Xiaolong frowned .\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Next release: Wednesday (fingers crossed!)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Both of them wanted to get angry but dared not show any anger .Fei Hou had a deadpan expression on, and his demeanor was calm and indifferent; despite the forced smile on Huang Ming\u2019s face, Fei Hou continued to block their path .At this moment, Huang Peng went up to Huang Xiaolong and said, \u201cXiaolong, would you let \u2026?\u201dHuang Xiaolong nodded at Fei Hou, and when Fei Hou saw him nod, he put his hand down, allowing Huang Qide and Huang Ming to enter the yard .Only then did Huang Qide and Huang Ming feel relieved and they nodded in thanks, with broad smiles on their faces . Especially Huang Ming, whose behavior was extremely respectful as they walked into Huang Xiaolong\u2019s small yard .\u201cWhat did you come for?\u201d Huang Xiaolong asked with indifference . \u201cIf I remember correctly, this your first time coming to this little courtyard of mine, right?\u201dAs far back as Huang Xiaolong could remember, his Grandfather Huang Qide, and his uncle Huang Ming had never come to visit him in his courtyard .Both Huang Qide and Huang Ming\u2019s face became red with embarrassment; but fortunately, the sky was turning dark thus it wasn\u2019t obvious .\u201cXiaolong, your Grandfather and Eldest Uncle came to invite you to join the New Year feast . \u201d Huang Peng stepped up and said to his son, coming to Huang Qide and Huang Ming\u2019s rescue .Every year during the annual Clan Assembly, after the disciples sparring event on the first day, a banquet would be held on the following day . Huang Clan Manor would hold a big feast to celebrate the new year . Other than the elders, only the best of three generations most talented disciples could attend the feast .Truth be told, Huang Xiaolong should have attended last year feast when he defeated Huang Wei and won the event, but no one came to invite Huang Xiaolong, and just like the Spirit Pool, both privileges were given to Huang Wei .\u201cRight, right, right, Xiaolong, we came to invite you to the feast . \u201d Huang Ming quickly followed up with a smiling face as if Huang Xiaolong were the Eldest Manor Lord, and he were an ordinary Huang Clan Manor servant that was sent over to invite him .Although Huang Qide did not speak, he still wore a dazzling smile .Being invited personally by these two to join the end of the year feast was a first since Huang Clan Manor was established . In so many years, only Huang Xiaolong had the honor .But, Huang Xiaolong answered coldly, \u201cNo thanks, I still need to practice . \u201dThe smiles on Huang Qide and Huang Ming\u2019s faces stiffened .\u201cXiaolong you!\u201d Beside him, Huang Peng panicked and blurted out .\u201cDad, you know my temper!\u201d Huang Xiaolong replied .In this situation, Huang Peng don\u2019t know what to say, this son of his sometimes could be very stubborn, and once he had decided on something, neither he nor his wife could make him change his position .But, Huang Qide motioned his hand at Huang Peng and with a sincere expression looking at Huang Xiaolong, he said: \u201cXiaolong, what I did in the past was wrong and biased . But I hope that you won\u2019t hate me . From now on, no matter what you want, as long as you request it, I will agree . \u201dHuang Xiaolong remained impassive . Of course, he knew why his Grandfather lowered himself to come over and invite him, acting polite; it was all because of the talent he had exposed, and the fact that there was a peak late-Tenth Order expert behind him . Why else would his Grandfather humble himself like this?Huang Xiaolong kept quiet and didn't reply .Huang Qide did not get angry when he saw this, but sighed in his heart as he continued, \u201cYour father said that you would be leaving to train outside after the New Year?\u201dHuang Xiaolong glanced at his father, Huang Peng, and when Huang Peng was about to speak, Huang Qide beat him to it . \u201cDon\u2019t blame your Dad; I unintentionally overheard him . \u201d Then, his tone suddenly changed, \u201cXiaolong, I don\u2019t hope that you would forgive me, but Grandfather wants you to know, Huang Clan Manor and I will always wait for your return, and Huang Clan Manor is forever your home!\u201dHuang Qide\u2019s expression became a little wistful as he took out a small jade bottle . \u201cA few years ago, Grandfather hired an alchemist to refine a Grade Four Spirit Dan, Dragon Tiger Fundamental Dan; it\u2019s hugely beneficial in enhancing battle qi . \u201dHuang Ming was shocked when he saw his father took out the Fundamental Dragon Tiger Dan; it was an incredibly rare top Grade Four Spirit Dan . His father had kept it for more than a dozen years, but now he\u2019s actually giving it to Huang Xiaolong?!A Grade Four Spirit Dan?Huang Xiaolong had hesitated for a moment before he received the bottle .When Huang Qide saw Huang Xiaolong took the bottle, a bright smile bloomed on his face, as if it was Huang Xiaolong who gave him a Grade Four Spirit Dan and not the other way round .But, when his smile was most dazzling, Huang Xiaolong passed the bottle to his father who was beside him, \u201cDad, take this Dragon Tiger Fundamental Dan . \u201dInstantly the bright smile on Huang Qide\u2019s face vanished, and both Huang Ming and Huang Peng were dazed .\u201cXiaolong, you can\u2019t!\u201d Huang Peng was about to refuse when Huang Xiaolong waved his hand and said, \u201cDad, you\u2019re now at peak the late-Sixth Order and need this Dragon Tiger Fundamental Dan more than me . Don\u2019t refuse anymore, take it . \u201d And just like that Huang Xiaolong gave away the very precious dan .Huang Peng received the jade bottle from his son with a helpless expression .Huang Xiaolong then turned to looked at his Grandfather who was no longer smiling, and said, \u201cYou gave it to me, and I gave it to Dad, you have don't have a problem with that, right?\u201d\u201cOh, oh, not at all! It makes no difference if your Dad uses it, it's all the same . \u201d Huang Qide replied with a smile but his heart was dripping blood; a top Grade Four Spirit Dan, ah! He had kept it more than ten years!A short while later, Huang Qide, Huang Ming, and Huang Peng left the small courtyard .In the end, Huang Xiaolong didn\u2019t join them in the feast .The feast was held in the front hall, and just like the previous years it was a lively, grand, and festive occasion, but somehow Huang Qide, who sat in the main seat, wasn\u2019t feeling the festivity at all .In contrast to the liveliness of the front hall, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s small courtyard was quiet . Huang Xiaolong sat cross-legged on the cold jade bed, running the Asura Tactics' exercise to absorb the netherworld\u2019s spiritual aura as it gushed down on him .Huang Xiaolong had now reached the second stage of Asura Tactics .According to the illustrations, when one reached the highest level of Asura Tactics, he could open Asura\u2019s Gate connected to Asura Realm . But, he\u2019s not sure if this is true .Two days passed quickly, and New Year arrived .This New Year, the Eastern Courtyard was more lively compared to previous years, and Huang Xiaolong spent time with his Mom and Dad, little sister and brother and the air was filled with laughter .For Huang Xiaolong knew, the next time he would see his parents, little sister, and brother would be in a year .New Year came and went .The next day, Huang Qide, Huang Ming, and all of Huang Clan Manor\u2019s elders, and housekeepers stood at the square before Huang Clan Manor\u2019s main entrance: everyone was there to bid Huang Xiaolong farewell .Her son was about to travel far away, Su Yan\u2019s eyes were red-rimmed as she hugged Huang Xiaolong tightly . \u201cYou must be careful while traveling . \u201d\u201cMom, I know . \u201d Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes too were red, and he quickly turned away and left with Fei Hou .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Silvermoon Forest is so vast that it traversed more than ten kingdoms\u2019 territory, various beasts lived inside Silvermoon Forest . Thus, Huang Xiaolong decided to hunt some demonic beast while traveling .The Fourth Stage Bara Floret Python he killed previously came from Silvermoon Forest .And three days later, Huang Xiaolong reached the edge of Silvermoon Forest .He raised his head to look at the sky, seeing the sky gradually grew darker, he said to Fei Hou, \u201cWe\u2019ll rest here for the night, and continue our journey tomorrow . \u201d\u201cYes, Sovereign!\u201d Fei Hou acknowledged with respect .The little violet monkey on Huang Xiaolong\u2019s shoulder clapped its hands and squeaked, seeing its action Huang Xiaolong smile, \u201cLittle guy, go see if there\u2019s any fruit in the area, bring some back . \u201dThe little violet monkey nodded, with a squeak with jumped off Huang Xiaolong\u2019s shoulder . With just a few leaps, it disappeared from sight .Whereas Fei Hou went to collect dry sticks and tree bark to make a fire .A while later, the little violet monkey returned with lots of fresh fruit in its arms; even its mouth is biting on a piece of fruit .\u201cThis is Ice Fruit?!\u201dFei Hou exclaimed in astonishment looking at the transparent-like fruits inside the little violet monkey\u2019s arms .Ice Fruit is a rarely seen, although it brings no benefits in regards to enhancing battle qi, instead, it could strengthen the physique and it costs several tens gold coins on the market .When the little violet monkey saw Fei Hou\u2019s astonishment, it lifted its little head with pride . It put down around seven to eight pieces of Ice Fruit, and then it gestured and squeaked before running off again, coming back with more Ice Fruits in its arms .Huang Xiaolong shook his head and laughed seeing its action; this little guy is amusing .During the journey these few days, every time the violet monkey ran off it will bring back some delicious fruits, so Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou tasted many delicious fruits the whole way .As they sat next to the pile of Ice Fruits, Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou took out some dry food, and ate it together with the Ice Fruits .Icy cold and fragrant when the Ice Fruit slid down the throat, Huang Xiaolong ate three without feeling enough .Huang Xiaolong said to Fei Hou, \u201cToo bad there\u2019s no meat, if there\u2019s meat plus a jug of good wine, then it is perfect . \u201d Huang Xiaolong was a wine lover in his previous life, but he had yet to taste this world\u2019s wine, wonder how does the wine in this world taste like?Fei Hou laughed when he heard this . \u201cSovereign also like to drink?\u201d From his point of view, Sovereign hasn\u2019t even reached nine, actually knows how to drink? Then he added, \u201cWine, there\u2019s none at the moment, but meat there\u2019s some later . \u201dWhile Huang Xiaolong was confused,\u00a0 suddenly the sound of a demonic beast heading their direction, and from the sound of its movement, its definitely not small .Moments later, two sharp fangs came into sight as a hog like demonic beasts appeared before Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou .Low-level Demonic Beast, Sandyfern Beast!Watching the Sandyfern Beast approached, Fei Hou laughed and stood up . \u201cSovereign, although this Sandyfern Beast\u2019s meat is a little thick and though, it is quite delicious . \u201d He was prepared to deal with the Sandyfern Beast, but a small shadow beat him to it; it reached the Sandyfern Beast almost instantly, and a ray of cold light gleamed across the Sandyfern Beast's body as it wailed and fell to the ground .Seeing the culprit, Fei Hou shooked his head, and of course, it is the little violet monkey .After killing the Sandyfern Beast, the little violet monkey dragged a corpse that is bigger than its body by a few hundred folds close to the bonfire . It squeaked and gestured towards Huang Xiaolong while little finger pointed at the massive Sandyfern Beast\u2019s body .\u201cOkay, I already know you\u2019re a glutton . \u201d Huang Xiaolong laughed and took out a sharp blade to skin the Sandyfern Beast, cleaned the meat and roast on the bonfire . Drool dripped while waiting for the meat to roast, and soon the air permeated with the smell of fragrant roasted meat . And the Violet Spirit Devourer Monkey squatted right in front of the bonfire with an anxious look as its eyes fixed firmly only the meat, salivated nonstop .Huang Xiaolong smiled watching the little violet monkey\u2019s expression . One year ago, the little guy tasted his roasting skill .Fei Hou sat nearby, and his eyes did not stray from the meat on the bonfire, the look on his face is the same as the little violet monkey .Just when the fragrant meat suffused the air, far away a loud yell rang out . Both Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou were startled, but Fei Hou said, \u201cSovereign, once we entered Silvermoon Forest, we will see many of these types of killings, and you will get used to it soon . It is better not to interfere . \u201dHuang Xiaolong nodded .However, the faraway fighting noise grew clearer as it grew closer, and it seemed to be moving towards Huang Xiaolong\u2019s direction .Huang Xiaolong frowned . And within seconds, he saw the fighting parties revealed themselves accompanied by loud yelling noises .A young girl and man chased by a group of people wearing purple-colored robes; slashes made by sword apparent on the pair of youngsters as blood stained their clothes .\u201cCosmic Star Academy, Purple Robed Sword Sect!\u201d Fei Hou\u2019s brow furrowed .Huang Xiaolong turned to look at Fei Hou .Fei Hou explained: \u201cYoung Master, Cosmic Star Academy belongs to the Luo Tong Kingdom, you probably heard about it, whereby Purple Robed Sword Sect is Yunhai Kingdom\u2019s number one sect! The pair of youngsters in front is from Cosmic Star Academy, and those behind them are from Purple Robed Sword Sect . \u201dCosmic Star Academy!Purple Robed Sword Sect!Huang Xiaolong took another look at the parties headed his way . Cosmic Star Academy is an academy in the Luo Tong Kingdom, this he heard his father mentioned before . Most of the big and prominent families talented descendants gathered there, and in the Luo Tong Kingdom, it is a family\u2019s glory to have their descendants or disciple successfully enrolled into Cosmic Star Academy .Whereby Purple Robed Sword Sect he had never heard of, but since this Purple Robed Sword Sect is Yunhai Kingdom\u2019s number sect, then they must be very powerful, at the very least not weaker than Cosmic Star Academy .And by this time, both parties were surprised noticing Huang Xiaolong, Fei Hou and the little Violet Spirit Devourer Monkey in their path; the pair of young girl and man flew towards Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou after a slight hesitation . At the same time, called out to Fei Hou in an urgent voice: \u201cSenior, please save us!\u201dFei Hou frowned; he was disinclined to involve himself in this kind of matter, now it seems like he won\u2019t be able to avoid it, both of them stood up and still Fei Hou did not move, waiting for Huang Xiaolong\u2019s decision .The pair of youngsters arrived beside the bonfire, panting heavily . Their expression filled with dread as they looked back at the group of people pursuing them .Note:Shaluo Shou; lit .

His brows creased into a frown when he realized that he couldn\u2019t determine Fei Hou\u2019s strength .\u201cSenior, we are disciples of the Purple Robed Sword Sect, we hope that Senior will stay out of this matter . \u201d After a brief pause Zhang Hua added, \u201cAs long as you do not interfere, we will allow you to leave safely . \u201dAfter all, they were within the borders of the Luo Tong Kingdom and not in the Yunhai Kingdom; Zhang Hua would prefer to avoid trouble if he could .Fei Hou didn\u2019t respond, instead, he looked at Huang Xiaolong .Huang Xiao long\u2019s expression remained blas\u00e9 as he looked at the Zhang Hua . \u201cAre you saying that if we interfere, then we wouldn\u2019t be able to leave safely?\u201d Although the other side seemed polite, Huang Xiaolong however, detected the implied threat in their words .As a person born in the Luo Tong Kingdom, seeing disciples of his kingdom's premier academy being hunted, it was only natural that he would be slightly partial to help Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s disciples .Just like in his previous life on Earth, if people from his country were bullied, he would be biased in his support of his fellow countrymen .On hearing Huang Xiao long\u2019s response, Zhang Hua\u2019s expression sank .\u201cKid, what did you just say!\u201d shouted one of the disciples seeing a fledgling dared to speak in such manner to Senior Brother Cheng, and just as he was about to scold more, suddenly, a shadow flashed and the disciple screamed clutching his face: \u201cMy face! My face!\u201dThere were two lines of blood running down on both sides of his face .It was the Violet Spirit Devourer Monkey who attacked him, and after attacking he settled back on Huang Xiaolong\u2019s shoulder, and then bared his teeth at the disciple .\u201cAnimal, you are courting death!\u201d Anger welled in that Purple Robed Sword Sect disciple, and he imbued battle qi into the long sword he was holding and attacked slashing directly at the little violet monkey .When the other disciples saw that one of their own was hurt, they couldn\u2019t resist, and they attacked together .Bright rays of sword light surrounded Huang Xiaolong .Zhang Hua wanted to stop them, but it was too late, and he watched the rays of sword light hurtled at Huang Xiaolong . Suddenly the rays of sword light vanished and the four disciples who attacked were flying, spitting out blood in midair .When they hit the ground, their bodies jerked twice and became still; they were all dead!Fei Hou looked coldly at the four bodies before he turned towards Huang Xiaolong and asked respectfully, \u201cYoung Master, are you alright?\u201dHuang Xiaolong shook his head as he said, \u201cI\u2019m fine . \u201d The truth was, even if Fei Hou did nothing, the four Purple Robed Sword Sect disciples couldn\u2019t have hurt him, he could tell that all four of them were only Fifth Orders warrior .Zhang Hua and the other disciples of the Purple Cloth Sword Sect disciple were shocked as they looked at the four lifeless bodies lying on the ground . Anger caught up, and a cold light flickered in his eyes as he turned around to look at Fei Hou, \u201cYou dare kill disciples of the Purple Robed Sword Sect?\u201dFei Hou just stared at Zhang Hua with an even colder expression and said, \u201cThose who dare to cause harm to the Young Master, will die!\u201dThis was one Asura Gate\u2019s rules; if anyone dared to harm the Sovereign, all Asura\u2019s Gate disciples must kill the person with their utmost effort!Anger raged in Zhang Hua\u2019s heart, and his expression became ice-cold: \u201cGood!\u201d Then he waved his hand signaling to the disciples and said, \u201cWe are leaving!\u201dThen he turned to leave . The disciples were all stunned .\u201cLeave? Who allowed you to go?\u201d At this moment, spoke Huang Xiaolong with an edge in his voice .Huang Xiaolong saw the hate and animosity in the middle-aged man\u2019s eyes, and he knew that if the middle-aged man were allowed to leave, in the future he would definitely return for revenge . And Huang Clan Manor wasn't that far away from their current location, if the scar-face middle-aged man discovered his identity, then Huang Clan Manor might be in danger of annihilation . So, Huang Xiaolong decided not let these Purple Robed Sword Sect disciples leave .Murder flitted across Huang Xiaolong\u2019s heart .In his previous life, the number of criminals that died in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s hands was no less than twenty . The fact was, Huang Xiaolong wasn\u2019t a soft, kind-hearted person .The scar-faced middle-aged man and the Purple Robed Sword Sect disciples paused, and their expressions changed in the same moment Fei Hou moved . As Fei Hou dashed forward, behind him, a river emerged!The river emitted a flickering silver glow as if it was made of numerous swords light .This is Fei Hou\u2019s martial spirit, Silver River!Silver River was also a variational martial spirit .Fei Hou immediately soul transformed after releasing his martial spirit! His body turned soft and flexible . Moving as if he had become a silver-colored river, he wound around the disciples of the Purple Robed Sword Sect, and horrifying screams came from their throats as pillars of blood shot out of their bodies . Without exception, all of them crumbled to the ground . In a blink of an eye, they had all died .In the time needed to take six to seven breaths, all the other disciples of the Purple Robed Sword Sect disciples, as well as the scar-faced middle-aged man, Zhang Hua, died .The two disciples of Cosmic Star Academy were rooted where they stood, filled with fear as they looked at Fei Hou . They were very aware of the strength of the Purple Robed Sword Sect disciples who had been pursuing them; after all, the scar-faced middle-aged man was a late peak Seventh Order warrior! Other than him, there were two other Seventh Order warriors!By this time, Fei Hou had returned to his usual self and retreated behind Huang Xiaolong .Only then did the two youngsters come to their senses .\u201cThis, er . . , this little brother and Senior, thank you for your saving grace, we will show our gratitude in the future!\u201d The young man\u2019s voice quivered as he cupped his hand in salute . He then grabbed the girl\u2019s hand and quickly left in panic . Long after, he turned his head back looking at the direction they came away from in fear .Fei Hou\u2019s face sank seeing the two ran away in panic when he had just saved them, so he asked Huang Xiaolong, \u201cYoung Master, should we\u2026?\u201d Fei Hou made a silencing gesture .A certain light flitted in Huang Xiaolong eyes, but in the end, he shook his head . \u201cForget it . \u201d Although he too was disgusted with the manner which they fled from him, he understood that they were afraid he would silence them just like the Purple Robed Sword Sect .Also, he wasn\u2019t worried that the pair would spread the story about, for it wasn't in their interest if this incident came to light .\u201cLet\u2019s leave this place . \u201d Huang Xiaolong said to Fei Hou after the disciples of the Cosmic Star Academy had faded from sight . He had lost interest in staying here .\u201cYes, Sovereign!\u201dBefore they left, Fei Hou incinerated the bodies .Thus, two people and one little monkey entered the Silvermoon Forest .Having Fei Hou, a peak late-Tenth Order warrior traveling with him, Huang Xiaolong wasn\u2019t afraid of encountering any powerful demonic beasts .A month later, somewhere in the Silvermoon Forest, two bright rays of light flashed by and a big black bear roared as it fell, crashing into the ground . Afterward, Huang Xiaolong silhouette emerged in mid-air .In the past month through killing demonic beasts, through combining his martial spirits\u2019 innate talent \u2013 Space Concealment and Phantom Shadow \u2013 Huang Xiaolong could now easily kill a Sixth Stage demonic beast .The black bear Huang Xiaolong had just killed was a mid-Sixth Stage .At this moment, the little violet monkey leaped off Huang Xiaolong\u2019s shoulder towards the big black bear . Its tiny claws slit across the skin, dug out a beast core, before opening its mouth and swallowing it; then it removed the bear gallbladder and gave it to Huang Xiaolong .A mid-Sixth Stage black bear\u2019s gallbladder was much more potent compared to the Fourth Stage Bara Floret Python's snake gallbladder that he took last time .Note:-Senior Brother Cheng Zhanghua \u2013 full name; same person-Fei Hou calls Huang Xiaolong Young Master/Lord when there are others around; I\u2019m gonna keep at Young Master .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He finally\u00a0got the wine a few days before\u00a0after killing a group of mercenaries that called themselves Evil Spirit .The moment the mid-Sixth Stage black bear's gallbladder entered his stomach, warm strands of energy began to flow into Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body . The strands started small, and then grew thicker within several breaths of time . Huang Xiaolong quickly started running the\u00a0Asura Tactics' exercise law to absorb and convert the energy into battle qi .With little\u00a0more than one month\u2019s time,\u00a0his battle qi had increased much quicker by\u00a0training and killing demonic beasts in Silvermoon Forest than when he\u00a0crazily\u00a0practiced at\u00a0Huang Clan Manor .In Silvermoon Forest, he would run into things that aided his practice, such as the black bear gallbladder; this was important because the Sixth Order barrier is hard to break through . Those who had top grade level ten martial spirits needed about a year to break through from late peak-Fifth Order warrior to Sixth Order warrior .Even though Huang Xiaolong possessed twin superb talent martial spirits, at the very least, he would need between five months to half a year before he could break into the Sixth Order .Huang Xiaolong sat cross-legged while he refined the energy, whereas the little violet monkey chewed on a purple-colored fruit that nobody knew from where it had picked it up . It never had to refine the beast cores that it swallowed .The entire time, Fei Hou stood guard ten meters away, totally focused on the surrounding area .A few hours later, Huang Xiaolong was done refining the black bear's gallbladder and got up . Not only had his battle qi increased, but his physique was also tougher, stronger, and firmer, including his tendons; and this increased his instant explosive power .Huang Xiaolong summoned his blades and leaped up, and while in midair, his blades slashed downwards . Dozens of sword rays turned into razor- thin\u00a0rain drops that\u00a0drizzled down, covering an area ten meters wide .Everything within that ten meters turned into dust .A faint cry echoed from the razor-thin\u00a0rain as if it came from hell, infringing upon\u00a0peoples\u2019 mind . Afterward,\u00a0Huang Xiaolong landed .After one month of practicing, the Asura Sword Skill \u2013 Second Style, Tears of Asura had finally gotten to the minor completion level!With one wave, cries of Asura could be heard .But, he was still miles away from reaching major completion . With each wave of the blade, the razor-like\u00a0rain was sometimes violent, or perhaps gentle like water, at times it raged like a heavenly river, and sometimes it was formless . That was the state when Tears of Asura reached the major completion level .Currently, each of Huang Xiaolong\u2019s waves brought down a drizzle of razor-rain, but he had no control over its range or size .Huang Xiaolong stopped his practice and recalled the Blades of Asura back into his arms . Suddenly, his fingers curled and clawed into the black bear corpse ignoring space . Dark black threads of energy flowed out from the black bear\u2019s corpse into Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body through his hands .As the black strands of energy poured into Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body, he stood there while black light glimmered around his body, then suddenly Huang Xiaolong clawed at a huge tree ten meters away .The sky seemed to darken as two black claws appeared midair .A \u201cBang!\u201d resounded through the air as both claws smashed against the huge tree, and it tumbled down, while the areas around the claw print had turned black, emanating death in the\u00a0air .In the past month, Huang Xiaolong had also started practicing the other battle skill mentioned in the illustration, Asura Demon Claw .There were only five moves in Asura Demon Claw, but once it reached the major completion level, each move had an overwhelming destructive power .The move Huang Xiaolong displayed earlier was called the Hiss of a Thousand Demons; when this move reached major completion and struck out \u2013 thousands of demons would appear and cover the sky, sweeping away everything in its path .Yet, in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s previous hit, not even one demon appeared .\u201cIt seems like I need to put more effort into practicing the Asura Demon Claw . \u201d Huang Xiaolong said to himself . The problem with practicing the Asura Demon Claw was that it\u00a0had one primary requirement; one must absorb the soul blood qi of a\u00a0recently deceased\u00a0corpse, regardless of whether it was human or beast . The black strands of energy from the black bear Huang Xiaolong absorbed earlier was its soul blood qi .Due to\u00a0the need to absorb soul blood qi,\u00a0Huang Xiaolong could\u00a0not practice the Asura Demon Claw when he was back at home .Suddenly, the sounds of footsteps and faint human voices was\u00a0heard\u00a0from afar .Fei Hou instantly arrived behind Huang Xiaolong in a flash while the little violet monkey jumped down from a tree and perched onto\u00a0Huang Xiaolong\u2019s shoulder .\u201cLet's avoid them,\u201d said Huang Xiaolong after having thought about it for a moment . Quickly Huang Xiaolong, Fei Hou, and the little violet monkey flew into a tree with dense foliage some distance away and hid themselves .Just as they had hidden among in the tree, some distance away, Huang Xiaolong could still\u00a0see a group people moving towards them, wearing purple clothes\u2013 they were Purple-Robed Sword Sect disciples!Seeing that they were disciples of the Purple-Robed Sword Sect, Huang Xiaolong was a bit surprised and held his breath .\u201cElder Chen, it has been one month and Senior Cheng has yet to meet up with us, could something have happened to them?\u201d One of the Purple-Robed\u00a0Sword Sect disciples asked .Chen Feng\u2019s thick gray brows wrinkled; Cheng Liang group\u2019s of disciples had\u00a0yet to rendezvous with them, so\u00a0something unexpected might have happened .Thinking of this, a cold light flickered across Chen Feng\u2019s eyes .\u201cHmph, those who dare to kill disciples of our Purple-Robed Sword Sect are tired of living!\u201d Another one added, \u201cIf we ever find them, we will eradicate nine generations of their lineage!\u201dChen Feng turned his head and asked one of the disciples, \u201cHave you found the two Cosmic Star Academy disciples?\u201d\u00a0 A month ago, Cheng Liang was pursuing both of them before his team went missing . As long as they found the Cosmic Star Academy disciples, then they would know what happened to Chen Liang and his team .\u201cReporting to Elder Chen, according to the message from our disciples, the Cosmic Star Academy disciples are somewhere near Poison Mist Valley . \u201d\u00a0 a disciple responded respectfully .\u201cPoison Mist Valley!\u201d Chen Feng brows furrowed as he said coldly, \u201cAll of you follow me, we are going to Poison Mist Valley right now!\u201d\u201cYes, Elder Chen!\u201dA while later, the disciples of Purple-Robed Sword Sect left .After the purple robed figures had gone and were no longer visible, Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou came out from their hiding place .\u201cSovereign, should we head towards Poison Mist Valley?\u201d\u00a0 Fei Hou asked, \u201cYou should know that Poison Mist Valley is one of Silvermoon Forest\u2019s three most perilous spots . \u201d\u201cOne of three most perilous?\u201d Huang Xiaolong pondered for a moment and\u00a0then said, \u201c Let\u2019s go and have a look . \u201dThus, two people and a monkey followed behind the Purple-Robed Sword Sect disciples towards Poison Mist Valley; it wasn\u2019t that far away from where they were and after only one day of travel, they arrived at Poison Mist Valley . \u201dThey stood at the entrance of the Poison Mist Valley and watched as poisonous gray mists streaked with something green floated in the air . Chen Feng waved his hand and said, \u201cSpread out and search . \u201dThe disciples of Purple-Robed Sword Sect answered respectfully and spread out .Moments later, a disciple reported: \u201cElder Chen, there are some traces of fighting up front . \u201d\"Oh, let's go and have a look!\"Note:Lit .

After they had walked about twenty li, they picked up their pace on hearing the sound of a battle close by .A few seconds later, Chen Feng saw five people in black robes fighting against a young man and woman who were clothed in blue . The young man and woman were the disciples of the Cosmic Star Academy who they had been searching for .Chen Feng was delighted at the turn of events and quickly motioned the disciples Purple Robed Sword Sect to spread out and encircle the seven people who were fighting .The disciples of the Cosmic Star Academy and their assailants in black robes were surprised at being surrounded, and they\u00a0immediately stopped fighting .Chen Feng walked forward slowly as he glanced at the seven people;\u00a0suddenly, he pointed at the five in black robes and said to a group of disciples . \u201cThe lot of you go take care of them . \u201d\u201cYes, Elder Chen!\u201dThe expressions of the five in black robes paled, and one of them said urgently, \u201cSenior, Wait! We are disciples of Black Sand Sect, and the Black Sand Sect has no grudge with the Purple Robed Sword Sect, correct?\u201d\u201cA grudge?\u201d Chen Feng jeered, \u201cDo you think we need a reason to kill you all? If you insist on a reason, so be it, I\u2019ll give you one . I find you not pleasing to look at\u2013 that is the reason . \u201dThe Black Sand Sect disciple wanted to say more, but a sudden beam of sword light filled with a murderous intent cut him down . The Purple Robed Sword Sect disciples launched their attack and of men the Black Sand sect frozen in fear at the strength of the incoming attacks; they\u00a0were mowed down like grass and moments later they were all dead, their blood splattered all over as it slowly seeped into the brown earth .The two disciples from the Cosmic Star Academy were paralyzed with fright . They had already tried to escape twice but were pushed back by other Purple Robed Sword Sect disciples that had closed up the area .Chen Feng looked at the pair and asked in an icy tone, \u201cDid you killed ten or so of our disciples?\u201dThe young man and woman were terrified, the young man suddenly said, \u201cSenior, this is a misunderstanding! We didn\u2019t kill your fellow disciples, with our current strength how could we?\u201dThe young girl chimed in, saying, \u201cRight, right, that\u2019s right Senior . The killer was a man with a variation Silver River martial spirit; We had nothing to do with it at all!\u201dChen Feng\u2019s eyes narrowed, \"A variation of Silver River martial spirit?\u201d\u201cYes, senior . That person also snatched away the treasure map . The treasure map is not on us anymore; please let us go, Senior!\u201d The young man explained further .A strong killing intent flashed across Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes when he heard this .He didn\u2019t expect the two people that he saved, to keep their lives not only exposed everything that happened that day but even framed he and Fei Hou for taking away some treasure map! Both of them have not even seen a corner of this so-called treasure map .Chen Feng sneered as he looked at the two disciples from Cosmic Star Academy, \u201cYou don\u2019t have the treasure map?\u201d Chen Feng didn\u2019t doubt it when they said didn't kill Cheng Liang and the rest, but he didn't believe the treasure map is not on them .\u201cSenior, the treasure map really . . . !\u201d The young girl emphasized again, but her voice trailed off in the middle, her widened in shock as she stared at a point behind Chen Feng .Puzzled, Chen Feng turned a hundred and eighty degrees and saw about ten meters away, stood a seven eight-year-old boy and a tall broad middle-aged man without him realizing their presence .Furthermore, there\u2019s a cute little monkey on the small boy\u2019s shoulder .\u201cSenior, that\u2019s him; he\u2019s the\u00a0one who killed your sect disciples!\u201d The Cosmic Stars Academy female disciple went into a daze, and then shrieked in joy; her finger pointed at\u00a0Fei Hou .Earlier, she was afraid Chen Feng wouldn\u2019t believe her; now, isn't it great Fei Hou suddenly appeared before them?\u201cYes, it\u2019s them . Senior, the treasure map is with him . He\u2019s the one who took the treasure map away!\u201d The male disciple\u2019s eyes lit up and he\u00a0pointed at Fei Hou as he screamed aloud .Chen Feng stared at Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou walking towards themUnder Chen Feng\u2019s watchful eyes, Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou crossed the distance between them and stood not far from them .\u201cYou are the one who killed my Purple Robed Sword Sect disciples?\u201d Chen Feng looked icily at Fei Hou .Fei Hou did not speak, just like Huang Xiaolong, he just\u00a0stared coldly at the two Cosmic Star Academy disciples .Huang Xiaolong looked at them both, and his cold voice rang out: \u201cYou both deserve to die!\u201dTheir expression immediately turned ugly .But, very quickly the young man collected himself and grinned, looking at Huang Xiaolong, \u201cKid, you killed Purple Robed Sword Sect\u2019s disciples, I advise you to handover the treasure map obediently to this honorable Senior and then kneel down and beg for mercy . Maybe, you can keep your little life, otherwise, hey hey!\u201dAlthough he knew Fei Hou is very powerful, however, beside him is an Elder of the Purple Robed Sword Sect, which means he is at least a Tenth Order warrior . He doesn\u2019t believe Fei Hou is so strong that he can ignore a Tenth Order .They can find a way to escape when both sides are fighting among themselves .These two didn\u2019t put him in their eyes at all! Fei Hou ignored him, and a little kid like Huang Xiaolong reprimanded the two Cosmic Star Academy disciples in front of him!With his identity as a Purple Robed Sword Sect Elder, it didn't matter where he went he would be welcomed by the royal family and well-known families! In spite of all that, a wimpy kid actually dared ignored him!Chen Feng\u2019s face was extremely gloomy . However, he was in no hurry to attack; although he\u2019s very confident in his own strength, the other side dared to walk straight at them, they must have something up their sleeves .This time, two Purple Robed Sword Sect\u2019s Elder were dispatched into the Silvermoon Forest . Thus there\u2019s another Elder, Fu Yuan .And they have special means of communication . Very soon, the other Elder would rush over to assist them .Chen Feng stared coldly at Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou; when Elder Fu Yuan arrived, hey hey!At this moment, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s gaze was like a sharp blade that cut into Chen Feng, as if he saw through his heart and knew what he was thinking . Huang Xiaolong said to Fei Hou, \u201cLittle Monkey and I will deal with the two, you handle the rest of them . \u201d\u201cYes, Young Master!\u201d Replied Fei Hou .Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou flew off in different direction at the same time . In the blink of an eye, Huang Xiaolong reached the Cosmic Star Academy disciples, while Fei Hou came in front of Chen Feng, his body leaned slightly, and a sword slashed down on Chen Feng; the Luohan Sword skill .The sudden attack shocked Chen Feng, his body spun away like a top, dodging Fei Hou\u2019s sword attack . Cold sweat ran down his back; suddenly a shrill scream rang out beside him . He turned and saw Fei Hou had just stabbed through a disciple\u2019s throat with his sword .However,\u00a0the pair of young man and woman were dazed for some seconds when they saw a kid like Huang Xiaolong approached them . Feeling gleeful, both of them were\u00a0confident in their peak of mid-Sixth Order strength, how easy would it be to deal with a little kid and monkey?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With great delight, he materialized the Blades of Asura in his hands, and he slowly mouthed, \u201cTempest of Hell . \u201dHundreds of light rays emerged from the blades and gathered into two large vortexes that rotated with intensity . Wails filled the air, causing people\u2019s hearts to shiver (as if cold) in fear .A deep sense of dread overcame both disciples of the Cosmic Star Academy, who by now wanted to withdraw, but it was already too late as the vortexes created by the Tempest of Hell attack had reached them .\u201cStar Luo Sword!\u201d\u201cFathomless Galaxy!\u201dSeeing the incoming attack, a cold gleam flickered in the young man\u2019s eyes and his battle qi surged with a wave of his long sword and he sent out a torrent of sharp lambent stars light which collided with Tempests of Hell . The young girl also swung her sword and launched her own counter attack .\u201cClank! Clank! Clank!\u201dThe chain of blasts sounded as if they had exchanged more than one move .However, the Tempest of Hell didn\u2019t slow down at all, and in less than a breath\u2019s time had ravaged the many flickering stars and continued towards the bright sword rays .\u201cPu!\u201d having been run through by the Tempest of Hell, they both were spun round and crashed into a huge tree several meters away, knocking down the tree and spurting blood from their mouths, as they fell to the ground .Their clothes had been shredded into tiny strips, and blood ran down from their mutilated flesh as if they had received a hundred slashes . Even their faces weren\u2019t spared as fresh blood dripped from the multiple cuts on both of their faces . Although they were in a miserable state, they were still alive .Huang Xiaolong deliberately chose not to kill them with the first strike; the cuts from the Tempest of Hell attack would cause them to suffer excruciating pain, as it rampaged through their bodies destroying everything from within . Huang Xiaolong wanted them to suffer and experience this kind of agonizing pain .The pair from the Cosmic Star Academy rolled on the ground in great pain, screaming in agony till they became hoarse .The Purple-Robed Sword Sect disciples turned towards the source of the screaming, and seeing the tragic sight, they instantly paled .\u201cWhat? That wimpy brat is actually that powerful?!\u201d Chen Feng was stricken with disbelief as he stared at Huang Xiaolong, who stood with his Blades of Asura in his hands . it really was hard to believe despite seeing it with his own eyes: A wimpy looking eight or nine-year-old brat actually defeated two peaks mid-Sixth Order warriors!How could this be! How could there exist such a monster!Even the revered Sovereign, when he was an eight or nine years old wouldn\u2019t be this brilliant!In the time Chen Feng spent in shock, several screams suddenly erupted . The still dazed Chen Feng turned around and saw that Fei Hou\u2019s sword had pierced through the throats of five more disciples while they were distracted .Chen Feng was rattled and furious at the same time: \u201cWhat a bunch of idiots! Quickly! call out your martial spirits, and get in the Blood Wolf Killing Array formation . \u201d After saying that, a dazzling light exploded from his body, and an enormous wolf emerged behind Chen Feng . Its eyes were the color of red blood, its fur a silver-gray and between there were dark black patterns in between the silver-gray fur .This was his beast martial spirit, a wolf species: Sky Wolf!Seeing that Chen Feng had released his martial spirit, the other disciples of the Purple Robed Sword Sect quickly followed suit . All seven disciples\u2019 martial spirits were all wolves!Some of their martial spirits had gold-colored eyes, some had two tails, and some were even entirely pitch black .Although these disciples martial spirits weren\u2019t the same as Chen Feng\u2019s Sky Wolf, they were all wolf type spirits .Even Huang Xiaolong was stunned when he saw this .They then quickly moved into formation with Chen as the center, \u00a0before fully releasing their battle qi . Their martial spirits flew towards Chen Feng\u2019s Sky Wolf, and a powerful aura broke out from Chen Feng\u2019s Sky Wolf as eight wolf martial spirits seemed to have combined together .In general, people who had similar martial spirits could channel their energies together by using an exercise law or array, multiplying their strength and power .The aura of these seven Purple Robed Sword Sect disciples and Chen Feng increased at an alarming rate .\u201cEn?\u201dFei Hou was surprised a little; he hadn\u2019t expected that these disciples of the Purple Robed Sword Sect could all possessed wolf type martial spirits . But seeing all eight of them had gotten into an array formation, he scoffed and silver light shone from his body like a silver-colored sun, and a Silver River became visible as it wound around Fei Hou . With each turn, the silver light that shone from his body became brighter as the Silver River grew bigger .\u201cMartial spirit strengthening!\u201d Chen Feng exclaimed in horror when he saw the transformation caused by Fei Hou\u2019s martial spirit .Yes, this was martial spirit strengthening!And this was Fei Hou martial spirit\u2019s supernatural ability!Fei Hou\u2019s Silver River strengthening would allow Fei Hou abilities to become five times stronger, his power increased by half at the same time .With a five-time boost, Fei Hou\u2019s Silver River expanded several meters in width and more than a dozen meters in length .Once Fei Hou fully merged with his martial spirit with five times boost of power, it was as if he had turned into a Silver River; his bones, skin, and flesh disappeared .\u201cAttack!\u201d Chen Feng roared while as fear gripped him, and without warning a hand print loomed over Fei Hou and an enormous wolf head stretched its jaws wide open .\u201cSky Wolf Palm!\u201dA majestic Wolf covered the sky and its roar vibrated through the forest .The seven Purple-Robed Sword Sect disciples also launched attacks at the same time . All of them sent out a wolf head, which was comparatively smaller than Chen Feng\u2019s .Seeing this, Fei Hou\u2019s eyes became vindictive, he lifted his arms and sent out strong punch .\u201cShattering Heart Fist\u201dShattering Heart Fist! As the fist print pierced through the air, something seemed to have cracked .The eight wolves' head exploded and the eight who launched the attack were shaken and blasted away . Only Chen Feng fared a little better than the others, managing to steady himself after being pushed away by ten meters . When the seven disciples hit the ground, popping sounds could be heard from their bodies, each \u2018pop\u2019 causing them to tremble involuntarily until all seven of them died where they lay .The same popping sounds could be heard from Chen Feng\u2019s body but in his case each time a pop was heard blood spurted out of his mouth leaving him terrified and frightened . What kind of battle skill is this?! He wonderedWithout any indication, he turned around and tried to escape!Seeing this, Fei Hou\u2019s body glimmered, and flowed just like a river cutting off Chen Feng\u2019s path, then with a twist of his body, Fei Hou pushed Chen Feng back to his original position .Huang Xiaolong was relieved for they couldn\u2019t afford to let Cheng Feng escape . He turned and walked slowly towards the two disciples of the Cosmic Star Academy . Both of them were still rolling on the ground in excruciating pain, blood and dirt smeared all over them made it hard to recognize them .\u201cI beg you, please, please let me go . The tre\u2026treasure map, I\u2019ll give it to you!\u201d said the young man when he saw Huang Xiaolong walking towards them .Huang Xiaolong said nothing . As he looked at the young man with a cold expression, \u00a0he used the Blades of Asura in his hand and slit his throat ending his pitiful screams . Terrified, the young girl was about to say something when Huang Xiaolong sent her on her way with a wave of his blade .After he killed the two from Cosmic Star Academy, Huang Xiaolong recalled the Blades of Asura; he searched and found a piece of map from the young man\u2019s body . On the surface of this map, there was a drawing of a monkey!Comparing the drawing and the little monkey beside him, one thought crossed his mind; such likeness?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Seeing the little monkey\u2019s reaction, Huang Xiaolong became even more baffled .Could this treasure map be related to the little violet monkey?Suddenly, Huang Xiaolong heard an anguished scream; turning his head in the direction of the scream, he saw Fei Hou in his Silver River martial spirit form throw a powerful punch at Chen Feng\u2019s chest, causing it to collapse .A heartbeat later, a long sword flew out of the silver-colored river and went straight into Chen Feng\u2019s throat .Chen Feng looked down and saw that a long sword had pierced through his throat, with red blood dripping to the ground .He looked up, only to see Fei Hou holding the other end of the sword . His mouth opened and closed a few times, and suddenly he dashed towards Fei Hou . But, after two steps his body tumbled and he fell to the ground .Fei Hou cast a cold glance at Chen Feng\u2019s body before walking towards Huang Xiaolong . His expression became weird when he saw the so-called treasure map, and he said in a somber tone, \u201cSovereign, this treasure map was left behind by a powerful demonic beast cultivator . \u201d\u201cA Demonic Beast cultivator!\u201d Huang Xiaolong was shocked .\u201cYes, Sovereign . The words on the other side of the treasure map are written in the beast language . \u201d said Fei Hou as he pointed to the back of the map .Hearing that, Huang Xiaolong turned the over map and saw that a strange mountain resembling an elephant was drawn on the other side of the map . And at the bottom were several lines of unusual patterns that seemed to be the beast language Fei Hou was talking about .Suddenly, the little monkey pointed at the writings and gestured at Huang Xiaolong .\u201cLittle guy, are you saying that you understand what's written here?\u201d Huang Xiaolong asked .\u201cZhi zhi zhi!\u201d The little violet monkey nodded, then it shook its little head .Huang Xiaolong continued asking the little monkey for a while, but in the end, he still got nothing . Helpless, he put the map in his ring . Although he currently didn\u2019t know the location of the strange elephant-like mountain, nor could he yet decipher the writing, he was certain that the treasure map was related to the little Violet Spirit Devourer Monkey who traveled with him .As Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou began to dispose of the corpses lying around, Huang Xiaolong found a high-grade Mysterious rank exercise law on Chen Feng\u2019s corpse called Black Moon Art . Other than that, he also found some gold coins and dans on him .Everything went into Huang Xiaolong\u2019s Asura Ring .Even though the high-grade Mysterious rank exercise law was useless to him, he could auction it to fetch a good sum, especially for those clans like the Huang Clan Manor that only had low-grade exercise laws of similar same rank .Moments later, Huang Xiaolong, Fei Hou, and the little violet monkey left the place .\u2026\u2026Very quickly another two months had passed .During\u00a0these past two months, a man, a child, and a monkey continued to travel even deeper into Silvermoon Forest . Huang Xiaolong\u2019s level had improved so much that he was already a half-step into Sixth Order and he could breakthrough at any time .He worked hard at training the Tears of Asura, and its power had gone up by several folds and the only thing left were the meridians required for the Body Metamorphose Scripture\u2019s Fourth Stage \u2013 Convert Power of the Stars which had yet to open up .Reaching higher levels of the Body Metamorphose Scripture got harder with each stage until it reached twelve stage . However, in his previous life, Huang Xiaolong had gotten to stage nine of the Body Metamorphose Scripture so this time starting all over again was actually easier .Night came, and moonlight covered the continent .If you looked up at the moon while staying within the Silvermoon Forest, the moon would appear to be basked in silver, giving the forest its name .Under the silvery moonlight, Huang Xiaolong had his right hand held high above his head, his left hand behind him on his waist and he continuously breathed according to a particular rhythm . His internal force circulated within his body and gathered in his dantian .A few feet away, Fei Hou didn\u2019t know what to think of Huang Xiaolong\u2019s odd postures . He had never heard of anyone on the Snow Wind Continent who had to twist themselves in order to practice a battle qi exercise law .Night gradually receded and the bright sun rose in the sky .Huang Xiaolong stopped his practice and two people and a monkey once again continued their journey, killing demonic beasts along the way while practicing battle skills .Five days later, Huang Xiaolong, Fei Hou, and the little monkey finally left the Silvermoon Forest and traveled along a forest trail .Having spent four months training in Silvermoon Forest, Huang Xiaolong decided to head to the nearest city for a change of scenery .Following the forest trail down the hill for a few hours, they finally saw a large city .This city was far bigger than the Canglan County where Huang Clan Manor was situated . Looking at the city from afar, the city walls were about thirty meters high with a towering entrance and there was a moat of gray water before the city walls .With the huge city up ahead, Huang Xiaolong was delighted and quickened his pace . As he got nearer to the gates, he saw written above the gates: Lou Tong Royal City .\u201cLuo Tong Royal City!\u201d Huang Xiaolong was dazed for a moment when he saw the words\u2013 this is the Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s Royal City! He had actually reached the Royal City!\u201cSovereign!\u201d Huang Xiaolong came to his senses when Fei Hou called to him .\u201cShall we enter into the city now?\u201d He asked .\u201cLet\u2019s go into the city!\u201d He replied to Fei Hou with excitement . Just like when he was back on Earth, he felt happy on arriving at the capital city .Before they could go in, a guard at the gate pulled the two of them to one side, looked them up and down before he asked: \u201cAdmission fees, ten gold coins per person!\u201dTen gold coins are enough for a common household one month\u2019s expenses!At this time, a young man and woman riding a Stage Four Flame Beast mount swaggered into the city . The guards at the gate didn\u2019t block them but instead bowed deeply as they passed by .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s expression turned cold, and pointed at the two people who had just passed by: \u201cWhy don\u2019t they have to pay admission fees?\u201dThe Guard Captain sneered, \u201cThem? They are members of the Marquis Household\u2019s Miss Lin and Young Master Lin; they are nobles . Do you know what nobles are? Of course, they needn\u2019t pay admission fees when entering and exiting through city gates! How can you lowly outsider common folks from the outside be equivalent to Miss Lin and Young Master Lin!\u201dIt seemed like, these guards judged that he and Fei Hou were common folks\u00a0by their clothes .Huang Xiaolong frowned; outsider common folks entering the city need to pay ten gold coins, whereas nobles are free to enter and exit .Suddenly, from the distant mountain came the sound of many beasts running as tremors on the ground reached the gates so Huang Xiaolong turned to look . There were about twelve or more people riding on a Stage Four Horned Rhino racing towards the gates . Judging from their speed, they would reach the gates very soon, but none of them showed any intention of slowing down .Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou were standing before the gates in the middle of the road going into the city, and if they didn\u2019t get out of the way on time, Huang Xiaolong would be sent flying from the impact of the charging beasts .When the Guard Captain saw the young man in a yellow robe leading the pack, he panicked and immediately hid in a corner .\u201cYoung Master Meng is back, quickly move aside! Move aside!\u201d It was obvious that he was extremely afraid of this yellow robed young man .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The lives of two penniless commoners didn\u2019t matter even if they died . Things like this happened every other day in the Luo Tong Kingdom, it was nothing new .A blood-thirsty light flickered in the eyes of the yellow-robed young man, Meng Xia, and he urged his mount to go even faster when he saw that two people were blocking his way .While the guards looked on with frightened expressions on their faces, Meng Xia\u2019s Horned Rhino had gotten to Huang Xiaolong, and in just a matter of seconds, Huang Xiaolong would have been sent flying from the impact . At the last second, Fei Hou moved . A long sword had already appeared in his hand, and with a swing of his arm, many rays of sword light danced out .\u201cRoar!\u201d the bloodcurdling screams from the Horned Rhinos were heard and then everyone noticed that the Horned Rhino was no longer charging forward; its legs could no longer support its weight and it tumbled forward . Blood spurted from its body like a geyser eruption and Meng Xia was thrown off its back .The Horned Rhinos following behind were no exception; once they had reached within ten meters of Huang Xiaolong, they all tumbled with blood spurting from their wounds and their riders were thrown off .The beasts wails lasted for a short while and as the tremors ceased, only the moans of the yellow-robed young man could be heard . The Guard Captain and the other guards were stunned at the sight of the fallen Horned Rhinos\u2019 twitching in a pool of their own blood .The Guard Captain felt his throat dry up as he stared at Fei Hou in horror .Finally, Meng Xia, the yellow-robed young man, got up with difficulty and was extremely angered when he saw his beloved mount lying in a pool of blood .Pointing at Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou in anger, he yelled, \u201cRebels! Rebels! You cheap lowly commoners dared to kill my mount, you deserve to die! Kill them for me! No wait! First, cut off their hands, then their legs and feed it to the dogs!\u201dThe yellow-robed young man\u2019s guards crawled up, and when they heard their young master\u2019s order, they quickly pulled out their swords and rushed up together . In Royal City, only they harassed the commoners and never the other way round; yet today, they didn\u2019t know from where these two crept out that they actually dared to kill their mounts!The attacks from the guards were ruthless; each slash was intended to maim . It seemed that they planned to first cut off Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou\u2019s arms and then the legs .Fei Hou\u2019s eyes turned cold and snorted . He stood still as he raised up his sword and once again waved it sending out sharp rays of sword light which snaked through the group of incoming guards . An agonizing scream sounded every time a light flickered .Before the very eyes of the city gate guards, a flurry of arms shot up to the sky and before falling to the ground .\u201cMy hand, my hand!\u201d\u201cMy hand\u2019s cut off!\u201dThe guards cried out in pain .Initially, the angered yellow-robed young man who ordered his guards to dismember Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou stiffened, followed by fear, and panic .Fei Hou walked slowly walked over his direction .Terrified, the yellow-robed Meng Xia retreated, saying \u201cYou fellows are just a bunch of dirty, worthless nobodies, what do you think are doing?! I am the young master of the Duke\u2019s Mansion! If you dare hurt even a strand of my hair, you will die like dogs!\u201d He wasn\u2019t bluffing, someone once wounded him just slightly, and both the man and his entire family of more than a hundred people were killed .\u201cHurt a strand of your hair?\u201d Fei Hou expression remained unchanged .Without warning, Fei Hou\u2019s sword suddenly slashed out and a ray of sword light swirled around Meng Xia\u2019s head . \u00a0Meng Xia shrieked in fright, his body quivering, as Fei Hou sheathed his long sword; then, Huang Xiaolong noticed an acrid smell . Looking at the yellow-robed young man, Huang Xiaolong saw the lower half of his body was wet .Urine flowed down as he screamed .Seeing a Duke Mansion disciple act so cowardly, he smirked saying, \u201cLittle brat, don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t kill you . You aren\u2019t dead yet!\u201dWhen the young man heard that, he opened his eyes and realized that his head was still attached and his was neck is fine too . Only his hair was shaved off by Fei Hou\u2019s sword and he had become bald!A breeze blew past, and his scalp felt cold .Meng Xia\u2019s heart seemed to shiver uncontrollably like it was going to burst out from his chest, his back dampened by cold sweat .\u201cThe next time you insult my Young Master, calling him a dirty commoner, it won\u2019t be just your hair . I will cut away your scalp layer by layer!\u201d said Fei Hou as he stared coldly at the young man, letting the words sink in one by one .Meng Xia stood there dazedly; he had been frightened senseless by Fei Hou using a sword to shave off his hair . Fei Hou went back to Huang Xiaolong, and asked, \u201cYoung Master, are you alright?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay . \u201d Huang Xiaolong nodded and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go, we enter the city!\u201d He turned and walked towards the city gates . When he passed by the Guard Captain, he stopped and with a cold expression, he asked, \u201cDo you still want admission fees?\u201dThe Guard Captain immediately knelt down, begging for mercy: \u201cNo no no no, don\u2019t want! Little Ancestor, mercy, spare my life!\u201dHe was so frightened that he even used the honorific \u2018Little Ancestor\u2019 when addressing Huang Xiaolong .Huang Xiaolong asked yet another question, \u201cAm I still a lowly dirty commoner?\u201dThe Guard Captain shook his head vigorously, shaking his hands: \u201cNo, no, no, Little Ancestor, you are\u00a0the\u00a0highest of nobility, a true noble!\u201d\u201cIf I\u2019m a noble, then what about him?\u201d asked Huang Xiaolong as he suddenly pointed at the yellow-robed young man whose robes were still dripping with piss .The Guard Captain face reddened not knowing how to answer and Fei Hou glared at him .The glare made the Guard Captain weak with fright, his butt muscles loosened and he let out a loud fart, before quickly saying, \u201cHe, he is the dirty cheap commoner!\u201d The moment the words left his mouth he almost wanted to die; as a Guard Captain he actually dared utter such blasphemy against a young master of the Duke household! If the matter spread to the Duke\u2019s ears, he would definitely lose his job, but he wondered if his life could be kept .\u201cWhat about you?\u201d asked Huang Xiaolong .\u201cI\u2019m a dog; I\u2019m just a dog!\u201d With his face as a pale as a white sheet, the Guard Captain answered and kept repeating it, over and over again .Huang Xiaolong expression turned indifferent as he turned around and walked away, continuing towards the city with Fei Hou following at his side .The moment Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hous\u2019 silhouettes had gone far away, the Guard Captain\u2019s legs gave out, he sat his arse on the ground with an ugly expression, as if he had just swallowed dog shit .The other guards looked at him with concern; one them came to his side and whispered, \u201cCaptain, about Young Master Meng Xia\u2026 Should we inform the Duke's Mansion?\u201dAll this time, the yellow-robed young man still stood in a daze on the same spot and around him were all the guards who lost their arms still moaning in pain .\u201cInform the Duke\u2019s Mansion?\u201d Hearing this, the Guard Captain jumped up: \u201cYes, yes , yes, inform the Duke\u2019s Mansion!\u201d At this time the Guard Captain\u2019s eyes burned with hatred staring at Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou\u2019s receding figure . \u201cYou dirty commoners actually dared to hurt the Duke Mansion\u2019s Young Master; I will let you taste the consequences!\u201dAt this moment, Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou had already stepped into the city .\u201cYoung Master, don\u2019t worry . A Duke Mansion? Nothing will happen . \u201d Fei Hou assured Huang Xiaolong .Huang Xiaolong nodded his head . He knew that since Fei Hou had acted like this, it meant that he had aces under his sleeves . Even though he didn\u2019t intend to rely solely on Fei Hou\u2019s strength, since Fei Hou said so, then he was sure nothing would happen .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Undeniably this is the Royal City of the Luo Tong Kingdom, prosperous, lively and bustling on the long wide streets . Some of the streets were fifty to sixty meters wide, with an endless stream of horses and carriages that trotted along and if Cangnan County City were to be compared, it could only be described as a rural backwater .From time to time, there were people in strange clothes who passed by Huang Xiaolong . There were over thirty counties ruled by the Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s royal family, and under each county were many cities so the many different cultures between the cities were apparent . This was similar to Hua Xia which had many different ethnicities .As they strolled about the city, a two-meter tall muscular man whose entire body was covered in coarse hairs and on his face were tiger-like whiskers passed by Huang Xiaolong .\u201cIs that a Beastman?\u201d wondered Huang Xiaolong as he looked at the muscular man who just walked past them .In the Martial Spirit World, other than the human race, there existed many others races and beast people were one of them . There were also, half-beast human \u2013 the offspring from the coupling between humans and beast people .As the streets were crowded,\u00a0Huang Xiaolong just went along with the flow, the little monkey on his shoulder squeaking nonstop in excitement .Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou strolled casually, sometimes to the left, sometimes to the right .A few moments later, as he walked by a restaurant called Delicious Restaurant, Huang Xiaolong came to a stop .\u201cFei Hou, let's go in and eat something . \u201d Huang Xiaolong said . Having spent four months training in Silvermoon Forest, his tongue was already coated black from eating roast meat every day, so he planned to eat to his heart\u2019s content today .When Huang Xiaolong finished speaking, the little monkey perched on his shoulder immediately clapped in agreement .\u201cGlutton!\u201d Huang Xiaolong teased .They went into the restaurant and saw that it was full .\u201cLet's go to the Second floor . \u201d But as Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou were about to climb up the stairs, the restaurant\u2019s waiter quickly rushed up to them to stop them from going to the second floor and politely explained,\u201cLittle brother, my apologies, but our second floor is reserved for nobles . \u201d\u201cNobles again . \u201d Huang Xiaolong frowned, then he looked at Fei Hou . Fei Hou replied by throwing a gold coin to the waiter saying, \u201cThis is Young Master\u2019s tip . \u201dThe restaurant servant blanked out for a moment staring at the gold coin in his palm: \u201cThis, this is for me?!\u201d His monthly salary was one gold coin and the nobles that frequent here usually reward him with a few silver coins .\u201cNow we can go up?\u201d Fei Hou asked indifferently .\u201cSure, certainly!\u201d replied the waiter as he regained his senses, with his face sporting a wide smile he said \u201cThis way, please!\u201d and respectfully led Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou to the second floor .Although the second floor was said to be reserved for nobles, it was not necessarily true, for as long as the customer could pay, the second floor was open to them .Evidently, Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou were people with money . Thus, the restaurant waiter led them to a good seat close to the window .After Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou had sat down The waiter asked politely with a smile plastered on his face, \u201cMasters, what dishes would you like to order?\u201d\u201cBring us about ten or more dishes that your restaurant is most famous for . And three of the biggest jugs of the best wine available!\u201d Huang Xiaolong said .\u201cTen or more dishes! Three urns of the best wine!\u201d The restaurant waiter was stunned and his mouth agape .More than ten dishes, and three urns of wine!\u201cWhy you still standing there? Not moving?\u201d asked Fei Hou but seeing that the restaurant waiter still was standing there, he frowned a little then he took out a small pouch and threw it to the waiter . The restaurant waiter caught the small pouch, opened it and looked inside . A beautiful golden glow shined before his eyes, that small pouch held about sixty gold coins .\u201cThis is enough, right?\u201d asked Fei Hou .The restaurant waiter nodded his head vigorously: \u201cEnough, enough . There will be plenty left over too . \u201d\u201cThe rest is your reward . Go quickly and get the dishes . \u201dThe rest is your reward!!\u00a0When the restaurant waiter heard this sentence, his eyes seemed to turn gold-colored, his head nodded like a chick pecking grains . \u201cTwo Masters rest assured, I will be very fast and quick in sending the dishes up!\u201d He hurried down while his hand wiped away the sweat on his forehead, not sure whether the sweat is due to fright or delight .Soon, the dishes were sent up .The table was laden with fragrant dishes, enticing the appetite .\u201cMasters, these three urns are our restaurant\u2019s best wine called Snow Moon Wine, our restaurant\u2019s special brew . \u201d The said restaurant waiter respectfully .\u201cSnow Moon Wine?\u201d Fei Hou nodded and waved the restaurant waiter away, \u201cGood, you can go . \u201d\u201cYes, yes, please call me if there\u2019s anything you need . \u201d The waiter said and withdrew with a smile on his face .The moment the waiter left, the little violet monkey leaped off Huang Xiaolong\u2019s shoulder and went straight at one of the wine urns . With a light slap from its little hands, the cover flew off and instantly the scent of fragrant wine wafted through the air .The little monkey\u2019s eyes lit up, lifted the urn of wine up and drank greedily .After which it grinned and squeaked at Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou .Both of them laughed at the little monkey\u2019s antics, and each took an urn and started drinking .The instant the wine was swallowed, a refreshing icy cold feeling filled their mouths, full of the wine\u2019s fragrance .While Huang Xiaolong, Fei Hou, and the little violet monkey were enjoying themselves, at the Luo Tong Kingdom Duke Fu Mansion\u2019s Main Hall, Meng Xia, who was shaved bald by Fei Hou, was shouting in anger: \u201cDad, you must kill these two darned commoners! Cut off their arms and legs! Cut off their arms and thighs, and then I want to parade then around the city, I want everyone to know the consequences of going against our Duke Mansion!\u201dLooking at his son\u2019s miserable appearance, the murderous intent in Meng Chen\u2019s heart soared; his son was actually beaten right in front of the city gates!Furthermore, the mansion guards\u2019 hands were all cut off!This was naked humiliation!\u201cStill haven\u2019t found those two?\u201d asked Meng Chen in a cold tone as he turned to look at his Chief Steward, Xie Fei .Just as Chief Steward Xie Fei was about to speak, without warning, from outside the Main Hall one of the guards who had been sent to investigate ran in, \u201cReporting to Lord Duke, we have found the two people, they are at Delicious Restaurant!\u201d\u201cDelicious Restaurant!\u201d Meng Chen stood up in anger, a cold glint flitted across his eyes, and he said: \u201cGood, very good! Hit my son, and hurt this Duke\u2019s guards yet still dare to enjoy yourself at Delicious Restaurant!\u201dThe other side was practically looking down on the Duke Mansion!\u201cGather all the experts above Seventh Order in the mansion, and follow me to Delicious Restaurant!\u201d Meng Chen yelled .\u201cYes, Lord Duke!\u201d Chief Steward Xie Fei acknowledged respectfully, but then hesitated before asking, \u201cThen, should I call First Mister and Second Mister?\u201d Meng Chen said, \u201cThat\u2019s fine! Do so . I don\u2019t care what tricks the other side has, I want them to die miserably!\u201dWhile all this was going on, Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou were wolfing down delicious dishes . Moments later, Fei Hou stopped eating abruptly, stood up and said to Huang Xiaolong, \u201cYoung Master, I\u2019m going to see a person, he\u2019s here in Luo Tong Kingdom and is also a disciple of our Asura\u2019s Gate . I will bring him over to greet Young Master! If he knew that Young Master is in Luo Tong Kingdom, he would be very happy!\u201dAn Asura\u2019s Gate disciple?\u00a0Is this the reason why Fei Hou dared to hit a Duke\u2019s son? Huang Xiaolong nodded, \u201cOkay, go and come back quickly!\u201d He didn\u2019t ask for the identity of the Asura\u2019s Gate disciple in Luo Tong Kingdom because when Fei Hou returned, he would naturally find out .\u201cYes, Young Master!\u201d Fei Hou answered respectfully then turned and left .Not long after, Fei Hou appeared before an enormous mansion, and written above the main entrance was a sign: Marshal Mansion .In the Luo Tong Kingdom, there were Generals, Dukes, Marquises, but there was only one Marshal!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Because of this, his was an exalted status, and he followed only one person's order .He was exempted from kneeling before the king and has supreme prestige in the military .However, Fei Hou was stopped when he wanted to enter the Marshal Mansion: \u201cWho dares to trespass into the Marshal\u2019s Mansion?\u201dFei Hou didn\u2019t say anything, but took out a gold plate . The soldier\u2019s face changed drastically when he saw the gold plate; the arrogance he had on his face earlier vanished as he knelt down immediately, saluting, \u201cSeen the Lord!\u201dThe gold plate on Fei Hou\u2019s hand was given to him by the Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s \u00a0Marshal Haotian, more than a decade ago .\u201cYou may stand up . I want to see your Marshal . \u201d Fei Hou said .The soldier stood up, and hesitated before he respectfully replied, \u201cMy Lord, The Marshal was summoned to the palace not long ago, and is currently not in the mansion . \u201d\u201cWhat? He is not in?\u201d Fei Hou\u2019s brows wrinkled .\u201cIt is so, my Lord,\u201d The soldier lowered his head when he answered .\u201cSend someone to the palace now and inform the Marshal that his Junior Brother came to visit and will wait for him at the Delicious Restaurant!\u201d said Fei Hou .Junior Brother!\u00a0The soldier didn\u2019t expect that this ordinary-looking middle-aged man, who wore clothes no different from that of ordinary folks, would be the Marshal\u2019s Junior Brother .However, the soldiers stationed at the entrance hesitated to go to the palace to inform the Marshal .\u201cTake my gold plate and go, I\u2019ll take responsibility if anything happens! But, if you were to delay the matter, and something happens, your lives won\u2019t be guaranteed!\u201d Fei Hou threw the gold plate at the soldiers, and the Captain quickly rushed forward to catch it .\u201cYes, my Lord!\u201d The Captain didn\u2019t dare disagree .Fei Hou turned around and left .As Fei Hou turned around and headed back to the Delicious Restaurant, Meng Chen leading a group of experts from his mansion had gotten to the Delicious Restaurant and bulldozed their way through the door .All the customers on the first floor were frightened and shocked when they saw Meng Chen and his men barge in aggressively .\u201cOh, it is Lord Duke, does the Duke have matters with our restaurant?\u201d When the restaurant owner saw Meng Chen, he quickly went forward and asked politely .Meng Chen ignored the owner and instead, he turned to a guard beside him, asking, \u201cAre they upstairs?\u201d\u201cYes, Lord Duke!\u201d the guard replied immediately .A cold glinted flashed across Meng Chen\u2019s eyes, and his hands signaled the men behind him: \u201cRush up, and surround the second floor, leave some of your guards below; not even a fly should be able to fly out of here!\u201d He pushed the restaurant owner away and surrounded by his many experts, he rushed up to the second floor .\u201cDad, that\u2019s him! It\u2019s that kid!\u201d Shouted Meng Xia . They had just gotten to the second floor, and the bald Meng Xia instantly spotted Huang Xiaolong who was seated near the window .Meng Chen was surprised when he noticed that Huang Xiaolong was alone, frowning he asked, \u201cWhere is the other one?\u201d\u201cLord Duke, this is better! If we catch the younger one first, the older one certainly won\u2019t escape!\u201d said the Chief Steward, Xie Fei \u00a0with as smile as he got to Meng Chen .Huang Xiaolong slowly stood up and looked coldly at the Duke\u2019s Mansion guards and experts who had the second floor surrounded . Truth was, Huang Xiaolong had spotted them from the window as they made their way towards the Delicious Restaurant early on . But despite being surrounded by so many experts of the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and even some Tenth Order, he still wore a calm expression because he was confident that he could escape unharmed .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s martial spirit\u2019s supernatural talent \u2013 Space Concealment could last for ten breaths from the initial six breaths after he broke through to the Fourth Order .In ten breath\u2019s of time, combined with Huang Xiaolong\u2019s speed, he could vanish from Meng Chen\u2019s sight without a trace .His gazed fell on the bald Meng Xia and snickered . \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that you would have the guts to show up, aren\u2019t you afraid that I will cut off your scalp, layer by layer?\u201dMeng Xia and the people with him were surprised; How could this kid still maintain his calmness before all of them? to the point where he even dared to say he would cut off Meng Xia\u2019s scalp .Anger followed surprise, and Meng Xia\u2019s expression became ugly as he roared: \u201cCut off this kid\u2019s arms and legs for me!\u201d\u201cYes, Young Lord!\u201dThe Seventh Order warriors dashed towards Huang Xiaolong, and just as one of the guard\u2019s sword was about to slash down on Huang Xiaolong, a voice thundered from afar, saying, \u201cWho dares hurt my Young Master!\u201d The air seemed to ripple, and formed into a streak of lightning . The guards who had been struck by the lightning-like energy felt their bodies turn numb and they stopped moving .Fei Hou who went to the Marshal Mansion had finally returned .While still at some distance to the restaurant, when Fei Hou saw the scene in Delicious Restaurant\u2019s second floor, he used a battle skill that he hadn\u2019t used in a long time \u2013 Sound of Lighting Fall .The Sound of Lightning Fall was similar to Li Mu\u2019s Sky Lion\u2019s Roar . However, Sound of Lightning Fall was a high-grade Mysterious rank battle skill, and its power was much stronger than Sky Lion Roar .When all the Seventh Orders guards were numbed from the lightning strike, the remaining experts of the Duke\u2019s Mansion could see a Silver River (still far away) streaking towards them like silver lightning . It arrived before them in the blink of an eye .\u201cLord Duke, careful!\u201d\u201cHeavenly Serpent Sword!\u201d\u201cBorder Fist!\u201dBy this time, Fei Hou who had transformed into Silver River stood before them, and the Duke\u2019s Mansion\u2019s strongest experts, Mister First and Mister Second made their moves at the same time, launching fierce strikes at Fei Hou . A huge Heavenly Serpent appeared, jaws wide open intending to swallow Fei Hou; simultaneously a fist print also spun towards Fei Hou .But, when both the Heavenly Serpent and the fist print hit Fei Hou, it was if they fell on a vast sea, and sunk into the depths of the sea without leaving any ripples .However,\u00a0Fei Hou\u2019s Silver River continued to constrict the guards of the Duke\u2019s Mansion . Agonizing screams echoed throughout the second floor for a moment before all the guards tumbled the floor, painting the second floor\u2019s floor boards red with their blood .This time, Fei Hou wasn\u2019t as merciful like the first time where he only cut off his opponent's arms .Ignoring the fallen bodies, Fei Hou appeared beside Huang Xiaolong, but his eyes stared at Meng Xia like sharp blades .When he\u00a0spared his opponents, however, he didn\u2019t expect that they would gather the courage to retaliate .This time round . . . Fei Hou\u2019s icy-cold eyes zoomed towards Meng Xia\u2019s scalp .\u201cDad, it\u2019s him! He\u2019s one who shaved off all my hair!\u201d Seeing Fei Hou, Meng Xia shrieked with fear and hid behind the Duke\u2019s Mansion\u2019s two Tenth Order experts .The expressions of the two Tenth Order experts from the Duke\u2019s Mansion were somewhat ugly . Their combined attacked just now was actually unable to stop Fei Hou; this meant that Fei Hou was a peak late-Tenth Order warrior!One had to know that one of them was late-Tenth Order, while the other was peak-mid Tenth Order!Meng Chen stared at the bodies of his guards fallen on the floor, feeling fear and shock at the same moment . \u201cYou, you dared to kill this Duke\u2019s guards?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Don\u2019t tell me that we should\u2019ve stood here, and waited for you to kill us? We shouldn't have moved a finger in retaliation, right?\u201dIn the eyes of dukes like Meng Chen, commoners were supposed to stand still and be killed by them .Meng Chen\u2019s face became darkly sullen .\u201cBrat, I don\u2019t care who\u2019s supporting you; today, you\u2019ve killed this Duke\u2019s guards! It doesn\u2019t matter who it is they won\u2019t be able to save you!\u201dMeng Chen\u2019s killing intent soared as he spoke in a cold voice, then He stepped back after and said to the two Tenth Order warriors (First Mister and Second Mister) \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what method you use, today, you\u00a0 absolutely must chop off their arms and legs!\u201d\u201cPlease rest assured, Lord Duke!\u201d First Mister and Second Mister exchanged a look and acknowledged Meng Chen\u2019s order . And the Ninth and Eighth Orders also replied loudly .Meng Chen and his son then moved to the sides, expecting to see a good show .Meng Chen coldly observed the scene before him, although he had already guessed that if a little kid like Huang Xiaolong had a Tenth Order bodyguard surely, it meant that he had an unusual background . However, he wasn\u2019t worried . As a Duke of the Luo Tong Kingdom he had a high status within the kingdom, and the number of people he feared were very few, so few that they would total less than ten!First Mister and Second Mister cautiously walked towards Fei Hou and Huang Xiaolong .\u201cBoth of us will deal with him (Fei Hou), while the rest of you go and break both of that kid\u2019s arms and legs!\u201d First Mister instructed the Ninth and Eighth Order Duke Mansion guards .\u201cYes, First Mister!\u201dFirst Mister made his move before they could reply and a great serpent emerged behind him .This serpent had a large head, but a small body and its entire length were a sickly white in color; this was his martial spirit, the Heavenly Serpent!The Heavenly Serpent belonged to the snake beast category of martial spirits and snake martial spirits are generally ranked as grade seven . However, some powerful snake martial spirits were categorized as grade eight and this Heavenly Serpent was one of them .First Mister immediately soul transformed after his martial spirit emerged, his body turned into the same pale white, with layers of serpent scale . His eyes became entirely red as he pounced on Fei Hou .Whereas Second Mister\u2019s martial spirit was something rarely seen \u2013 a vine type plant! The vines were a purple so dark that it looked black as ink and it had thorns on it sharp as knives .This is a type of special plant martial spirit and was highly toxic .Second Mister\u2019s action was as swift as First Mister\u2019s; he immediately soul transformed after releasing his martial spirits and leaped towards Fei Hou .At this time, the other guards of the Duke\u2019s Mansion moved quickly towards Huang Xiaolong .\u201cYoung Master, you must be careful!\u201d Fei Hou said as he looked sharply at the flood of oncoming people rushing at them . Suddenly his Silver River martial spirit emerged turning tens of meters long and enclosed Huang Xiaolong, protecting him . His hands were deflecting the many attacks coming from the Duke Mansion\u2019s guards .The little violet monkey on Huang Xiaolong\u2019s shoulder was unusually quiet . Its pair of gemstone like blue eyes stared at the Meng Chen and his son .\u201cBang! Bang! Bang!\u201dBattle qi clashed, and the shock waves spread through the air of the small restaurant space . All the furniture had turned into dust, and the customers had all run for their lives .First Mister and Second Mister never imagined that Fei Hou could block all the attacks from more than ten people while not moving a single step . This made their faces warped in fury .Fei Hou\u2019s strength had exceeded their assumptions, and most surprising was his martial spirit which had evolved to the extent that it could strengthen its owner five times . In general, a Tenth Order warrior with Silver River martial spirit could only enhance their strength to a maximum of four times .The warriors from the Duke Mansion were both shocked and angry at the same time, which motivated them to attack unceasingly .Although Fei Hou was very strong, however, he couldn\u2019t last very long against so many experts at once, and in the end, each time he blocked an attack, Fei Hou\u2019s face lost a little color .Fei Hou\u2019s body had strengthened till his Silver River was so dense that it looked close to being mercury .When Meng Chen and Meng Xia saw this, a wide smile blossomed on the faces of both father and son .\u201cYou will regret it if my Young Master is harmed!\u201d Seeing the father and son\u2019s disgusting smile, Fei Hou reminded them while his hands continued to block attacks .Meng Chen smirked, \u201cRegret? I, Meng Chen don't have the word regret in my dictionary . Not only do I want to chop off your arms and legs, after I have you both paraded around the city streets, I will also have you beheaded in public! I want to see who can save the two of you!\u201dAnd this point, Marshal Haotian had just returned from the palace and was surprised when he sensed bursts of battle qi energy coming from the direction of the Delicious Restaurant .And this point, Marshal Haotian had just returned from the palace and was surprised when he sensed bursts of battle qi energy coming from the direction of the Delicious Restaurant .For the Delicious Restaurant was not far from the Marshal Mansion, and because Fei Hou\u2019s was a peak late-Tenth Order warrior, the energy vibration could travel the distance .\u201cPeak late-Tenth Order?\u201d Marshal Haotian\u2019s brows furrowed .Although fights are very common in the Royal City, however, it rarely involved a Tenth Order warrior .\u201cMarshal, it seems to come from the Delicious Restaurant\u2019s location . \u201dA guard beside Haotian remarked . And at this time, the guard captain who was guarding the main entrance of the Marshal Mansion saw that the Marshall had returned, quickly went up to report . \u201cMarshal, a few moments ago, someone came and said that he was your Junior Brother and he took out Marshal\u2019s gold plate here, wanting to see Marshal . \u201d The guard\u2019s captain then took out the gold plate and showed it yo Haotian .\u201cJunior Brother!\u201d Haotian took the gold plate from the guard captain, pleasure evident on his face .This was the gold plate he gave to his Junior Brother more than a decade ago .\u201cWhere\u2019s my Junior Brother?\u201d He asked . It had been a very long time since he had seen Junior Brother, Fei Hou, and he didn\u2019t expect that his Junior Brother would be here . When they meet up, they must drink together again .The guard captain hesitated for a moment, then honestly reported, \u201cReplying Marshal, when he was here, I informed him that you were summoned to the palace and he left this gold plate and left, saying that he would wait for you at the Delicious Restaurant . \u201d\u201cDelicious Restaurant!\u201d Haotian\u2019s face sank, as he continued to sense the ever increasing battle qi energy coming from the direction of Delicious Restaurant, could it be\u2026?\u201cJunior Brother\u2019s in trouble!\u201dJunior Brother Fei Hou is in Delicious Restaurant, and there was a clashing battle qi emitted from there! There aren\u2019t so many coincidences in this world; it must be Junior Brother! In less than a heartbeat\u2019s time, Haotian was sure of it .\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so earlier?!\u201d Haotian roared at the guard captain .The guard captain was so terrified that his liver nearly cracked\u2013 he had never seen the Marshal in such a big temper!\u201cMarshal, I, I\u2026\u201d The guard's captain tried to explain, but Haotian didn\u2019t want to listen . Instead, he shouted loudly towards the sky: \u201cIronclawCondor!\u201dHigh up in the air the sharp cry of an eagle rang out following Haotian\u2019s holler and a huge gray condor appeared, about five meters long, its grayish wings looked like it was made out of iron reflecting a sharp light under the sunlight . Its big claws looked like it could tear apart an elephant with ease .Haotian leaped up onto the Ironclaw Condor\u2019s back, and they disappeared towards Delicious Restaurant\u2019s direction .In all of the Luo Tong Kingdom, other than the kingdom\u2019s ruler, only Marshal Haotian were permitted to fly in the Royal City .The captain guard\u2019s knees gave out in fear and slide to the ground when he saw Marshal called out the grade four Ironclaw Condor to rush towards Delicious Restaurant .Even though Fei Hou had given him the gold plate and asked him to send someone to the palace to inform the Marshal, he did not!At that moment he thought that since there was no war going on, there was no point to it as the Marshal would return very soon from the palace . That\u2019s why he did not go and did not send anyone! He didn\u2019t expect that an accident would happen . And from the looks of things, it was a grave matter! If something really happened to Marshal\u2019s Junior Brother, what would happen to him?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As Fei Hou\u2019s barrier came closer to breaking, Huang Xiaolong frowned and was considering if he should first conceal himself within space and kill the bald-headed Meng Xia, Suddenly, from the skies above a sharp cry of a condor that could shatter a rock with its sound wave was heard .Everyone within a few miles heard the condor\u2019s sharp cry which hadn\u2019t been heard for a long time, so all Royal City residents looked up to the sky .When Fei Hou heard the condor\u2019s sharp cry, he was so glad; Senior Brother finally arrived!Meng Chen heard it, he felt the cry was very familiar, but at the moment he couldn\u2019t grasp why . So he snickered when he noticed the happy expression on Fei Hou\u2019s face . \u201cOh, It would seem that your backup is here . He came at the right time, This way I can clean-up all of you once and for all! I want to see who he is, that is so powerful, even if he has three heads or six arms to come and interfere in this Duke\u2019s business!\u201dMeng Chen didn\u2019t bother to turn around after he spat those words at Fei Hou .Fei Hou was already spent, and no longer a threat . So what if another peak late Tenth Order appears, the Duke Mansion could equally deal with it .Meng Chen did not turn back; however his son, Meng Xia, turned to look when the condor\u2019s sharp cried resounded and when he saw the huge gray condor up in the air and the silhouette on its back, his jaw dropped in shock . He became frightened and his body shook as if it was covered with fleas from head to toe .\u201cDad! Dad!\u201d His tongue seemed to have knotted as he called out to his Dad desperate and yet unable to form a coherent sentence .Noticing that something wasn\u2019t quite right with the way his son was behaving, he frowned as he said, \u201cWhat are you panicking for! Even if the sky falls on you, Dad will hold it up!\u201d He turned around after saying that; looking at his son with dissatisfaction . \u201cUseless\u201d; If he was this frightened over just a little matter such as this, how then could he take over the Duke\u2019s position in the future? He then looked up following his son\u2019s gaze .Just like his son did, he instantly saw the silhouette of an enormous bird, and on its back was the dignified Marshal Haotian in his golden armor!\u2018Mar, Mar\u2026\u201d Meng Chen stammered, and he became dizzy as if the sky was falling directly on him!By this time, the Ironclaw Condor and Marshal Haotian were less than three hundred meters from Delicious Restaurant, and he could see more than ten people were simultaneously attacking one person; his Junior Brother Fei Hou!A wave of rage rose up from the bottom of his heart to his head, and he became livid with anger, his veins distended making it look as if green vines were popping up under his skin .\u201cWho dares to hurt my Junior Brother!!!\u201d He roared and the sound of the roar thundered for several li . A heavy oppressive atmosphere burst out and descended from his body, the aura of the King of Generals!All the residents within several li heard his angry thundering voice .Marshal Haotian leaped off the back of the Ironclaw Condor and crossed the distance of tens of meters with just one leap like a tornado . From above the second floor, Marshal Haotian slashed his halberd down at the second floor of the restaurant .\u201cHeaven\u2019s Wrath!\u201dAs the halberd cut down, chained images of the halberd slammed downwards .And when Duke Meng Chen heard Marshal Haotian\u2019s words, the blood vessels in his heart nearly snapped .Junior, Junior Brother?! Marshal\u2019s Junior Brother!That lowly commoner was actually the Marshal\u2019s Junior Brother!The attackers from the Duke\u2019s Mansion only heard a loud shout, and suddenly a silhouette descended from the sky as terrifying halberds rained down on them . They were shocked and wanted to retreat, but it was already too late .Screams were heard throughout the restaurant\u2019s second floor as all the attackers were swept away by the force and the floor trembled like it was about to collapse .Blood spurted out of First Mister and Second Mister\u2019s mouth, their faces filled with fear . Two pairs of eyes quickly glanced around and found out other than the two of them, everyone else was dead!One strike injured two Tenth Order, and annihilated more than ten Eighth and Ninth Orders!This kind of terrifying power, only\u2026 Both of them quickly looked upwards and saw the person floating down unable to believe it .\u201cHao, Mar, Marshal Haotian!\u201dAfter he had swept away the flies, Marshal Haotian walked towards Fei Hou, his deep voice asking, \u201cJunior Brother, your Senior Brother was late, are you alright?\u201dSmiling, Fei Hou looked at the person before him and said, \u201cI\u2019m alright . \u201dThen, the Marshal\u2019s gaze shifted to Huang Xiaolong . When he was in the air, he had noticed that his Junior Brother was exerting all his might to protect this little kid . What is this little kid\u2019s identity? Could he be Junior Brother\u2019s grandson?While these thoughts were running through Haotian\u2019s mind, his eyes suddenly fell upon Huang Xiaolong\u2019s left hand . On Huang Xiaolong\u2019s left hand ring finger was a dark black ring and when Haotian saw this ring, his body shook visibly, eyes staring widely in disbelief, isn\u2019t this\u2026?!His eyes turned to Fei Hou .Fei Hou already knew what his Senior Brother wanted to ask and nodded his head at Haotian .Seeing his Junior Brother\u2019s nod confirming his guess, his body trembled and his face flushed red with excitement while his body shifted wanting to kneel down . A tiny voice similar to a fly\u2019s buzz was transmitted to his ear as Haotian was about to kneel, stopping hm . He swallowed the word \u2018Sovereign\u2019 that was about to leave his mouth and changed it into, \u201cLuo Tong Kingdom\u2019s Marshal Haotian greets the Young Master!\u201cYoung, Young Master!\u201d The minds of the Duke and his son, First Mister, and Second Mister\u2019s crashed! The Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s exalted Marshal Haotian actually . . . actually saluted that little kid . Moreover, the Marshal called him Young Master! It was as if the Heavens flipped over, their legs shook unsteadily, and they were close to fainting .At this moment, not even the sky falling could compare to this disaster!Marshal Haotian! Even Huang Xiaolong was stunned . This person saluting him who looked like a man in his seventies was Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s Marshal Haotian!Marshal Haotian is an Asura\u2019s Gate disciple!Fei Hou\u2019s Senior Brother!Then, how vast and powerful was Asura\u2019s Gate?!\u201cYoung Master . \u201d Seeing that Huang Xiaolong was in a daze, Fei Hou called in a small voice, reminding him . Only then did Huang Xiaolong wake up, and his hands reached out to help Haotian up, \u201cMarshal Haotian, please stand . \u201dMarshal Haotian\u2019s heart nearly jumped out when Huang Xiaolong reached out to help him, feeling extremely flattered he quickly stood up . \u201cHaotian thanks Young Master . \u201d After he had stood up, Marshal Haotian\u2019s sharp cold eyes looked at the four people: Meng Chen, Meng Xia, First Mister and Second Mister .He naturally recognized Meng Chen and his son .Waves of murder raged in Marshal Haotian\u2019s eyes .If they were only ganging up on his Junior Brother Fei Hou alone he would\u2019ve let this matter slide and ended it here, but now! He walked slowly towards the father and son pair, and he got to First Mister and Second Mister, his wrist turned and his palms struck directly on their chests causing it to explode instantly .Two Tenth Order warriors died just like that!\u201cMar, Marshal Haotian, I\u2026\u201d Meng Chen\u2019s face had already lost all his arrogance, stammering as he desperately tried to act tough . \u201cI am Duke Meng Chen!\u201d Although Marshal Haotian is only below the King, but he still can\u2019t recklessly kill a Duke!Marshal Haotian in a cold voice said, \u201cI know you are Duke Meng Chen . \u201dMeng Chen sighed in relief when he heard this; it\u2019s better that you already knew who I am . But, as Meng Chen relaxed, the halberd in Marshal Haotian\u2019s hand speared forward, passing straight through his throat before he pulled it back .Even though you are a Duke, for daring to attempt to kill my Asura Gate\u2019s Sovereign, you must die just the same!Marshal Haotian looked on coldly as Duke Meng Chen\u2019s body slowly tumbled to the floor .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His mouth opened and he let out the loudest scream of his entire life . His face turned pale devoid of any color, his eyes rolled back, and once again he wet his pants .Haotian\u2019s halberd stabbed forward once again into Meng Xia\u2019s throat stopping his scream forever . Retrieving his halberd, Haotian turned around without sparing a glance at the two bodies and returned to Huang Xiaolong\u2019s side . \u201cYoung Master, your subordinate came late and let Young Master suffered some shock . \u201dAnd at this time the Marshal Mansion guards arrived at Delicious Restaurant, shocked when they saw the two bodies of Meng Chen and Meng Xia lying on the floor .\u201cMarshal, this is?!\u201d A General within the group asked cautiously .Haotian said coldly, \u201cThey were killed by me . Go and clean up the bodies . \u201dThe soldiers were very shocked .Marshal Haotian then pointed at a person \u201cDrag him out and behead him!\u201d That person was the Captain who had received Fei Hou\u2019s gold plate but didn\u2019t go the palace to inform Marshal Haotian .\u201cMarshal, mercy! ah, I, I was wrong . Marshal, mercy!\u201d That Captain soldier was so frightened that he immediately fell to his knees, kowtowing, and begging for mercy . However, two soldiers dragged him out by force and moments later, a heart-wrenching wail rang out .\u201cYoung Master, would you consider returning to the Marshal Mansion with me?\u201d Haotian turned around and respectfully asked for Huang Xiaolong\u2019s opinion .Young Master?! The Marshal Mansion\u2019s Generals, and soldiers all had disbelief written on their faces and everyone turned to look at Huang Xiaolong in wonder .\u201cAll you of you come, kneel down and greet the Young Master!\u201d Haotian ordered the present Generals and soldiers .\u201cGreeting the Young Master . \u201d The Generals and soldier under Marshal Haotian quickly knelt down in salute before Huang Xiaolong .\u201cAll of you can stand up . \u201d said Huang Xiaolong as he looked at the soldiers kneeling down . He was unaccustomed to having all these people kneeling down to him, especial as they were Generals and soldiers of the Luo Tong Kingdom . Even if it was his Grandfather, Huang Qide, even he would need to lower his head in front of these people .After everyone got up, Huang Xiaolong turned to Marshal Haotian and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go . \u201dMarshal Haotian was overjoyed, and it clearly showed on his face when he heard the Sovereign agree to return to the Marshal Mansion with him, respectfully he said, \u201cYes Young Master . Young Master, this way please!\u201dThus, Huang Xiaolong, Fei Hou, Haotian, and the soldiers from the Marshal Mansion headed towards the Marshal Mansion in big strides .Soon after Huang Xiaolong and the others entered the Marshal\u2019s Mansion, the news about Marshal Haotian killing Duke Meng Chen and his son along with all their guards at Delicious Restaurant spread like wildfire to every corner of the Royal City .All the nobles families were shocked when they got the news, and their expressions turned ugly .This was the first time ever that a Duke had been killed in public in the Royal City since the kingdom\u2019s establishment more than two hundred years ago!\u201cI heard that it was Duke Meng Chen who led his mansion\u2019s experts to Delicious Restaurant to seize Marshal\u2019s Junior Brother . Marshal was furious and killed Meng Chen and the others in anger!\u201d\u201cDuke Meng Chen\u2019s luck is appalling, provoking the Marshal, but Marshal was too domineering, he ignored the law and he recklessly killed a Duke in the middle of the Royal City!\u201dDukes, Marquises, and Barons were all having intimate discussions about this matter .Within the Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s Palace, the King listened to endless reports from his ministers . The King hesitated for a moment before he waved his hand and said, \u201cI now understand the matter . You may all go now . \u201dAll the ministers present were startled when they heard this, but they dared not speak a word anymore . They quietly left the vast hall knowing that Duke Meng Chen and his son died in vain . Since the King did not say anything, then it meant that the King had decided to not pursue the matter .Night came, and the moon shone down brightly . Huang Xiaolong stood in the Marshal Mansion\u2019s garden with his hand behind his back admiring the full moon, recalling the scenes that happened in the restaurant during the day .Today\u2019s events had once again reminded him that he was still too weak .Although he was only nine years old and had already reached the peak of late-Fifth Order, but while for others this might be incredible, compared to those Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Order warriors, his strength was still very insignificant .Moreover, Marshal Haotian leaped off the condor from a high altitude and with just one wave of his halberd, he could kill more than a dozen Eighth and Ninth Order warriors while heavily injuring two Tenth Order warriors . This level of strength was definitely not something a Tenth Order warrior could do; therefore, he must be above a peak late-Tenth Order warrior!Power above a peak late-Tenth Order, what kind of strength is that? All along, Huang Xiaolong had never asked Fei Hou, and when he was still in Huang Clan Manor, his parents had never talked about this matter .A short while later, Huang Xiaolong called Fei Hou over .\u201cSovereign, what are your orders?\u201d Fei Hou inquired respectfully when he arrived .\u201cSit . \u201d Huang Xiaolong pointed at a nearby garden stool opposite him . When both of them were seated, Huang Xiaolong asked about the doubts he had .\u201cWhat is the realm above peak late-Tenth Order?\u201d Hearing Huang Xiaolong\u2019s question, Fei Hou paused a few seconds before answering, \u201cReplying Sovereign, after breaking through peak late-Tenth Order, in the Martial World they are called Xiantian Warrior . \u201d\u201cXiantian Warrior?!\u201d Huang Xiaolong repeated .\u201cYes, Sovereign . \u201d Fei Hou nodded and said: \u201cOur martial spirits absorb spiritual energy to convert into battle qi in our meridians, and battle qi can temper the body . The initial stages of a warrior, from First to Third Order can temper the muscles, Fourth to Sixth Order refines the tendons, and Seventh to Tenth Order tempers the bones!\u201d\u201cHowever, battle qi from the \u00a0First to Tenth Order doesn\u2019t strengthen our internal organs, only when we breakthrough Tenth Order into Xiantian Warrior does that happen . As long as we breakthrough to Xiantian, we can then continuously temper and refine every aspect of our body and at the same time, our life span will also increase . A Tenth Order warrior can at the most live up to a hundred years or so, however, when one advances to Xiantian, our life span will increase exponentially . In general, a Xiantian warrior can live up to hundred years old and a peak Xiantian up to three hundred years .\u201cThree hundred years!\u201d Huang Xiaolong was amazed .Fei Hou nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s right, roughly thirty years ago, Senior Brother already breakthrough to Xiantian . Senior Brother Haotian looks like he\u2019s in his seventies, but in fact, he\u2019s already more than a hundred years old!\u201dHuang Xiaolong was surprised; he never imagined that Marshal Haotian was more than a hundred years old!Fei Hou continued, \u201cWhen one reaches the Seventh Order warrior, a Qi Sea will form near the chest, and it will change once we breakthrough to Xiantian and the Qi Sea will condense into liquid form . That\u2019s why a Xiantian warrior\u2019s battle qi contains more power . Not only that, our martial spirits will evolve and can then turn into a real physical entity!\u201d\u201cA martial spirit can become a real physical being!\u201d \u00a0Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes widened in astonishment . \u201cIf martial spirits could turn into matter, then does that mean that martial spirits can be called out to battle?\u201d\u201cYes, Sovereign,\u201d Fei Hou nodded his head, saying \u201cThe higher the martial spirits grade, the stronger it will be once it turns into a physical body . For example, Senior Brother Haotian has a top grade ten martial spirits, the Dark Nether Lion . When released, there is not much of a difference in their strength . \u201dSaying there isn\u2019t much of a difference in their strengths would mean that the martial spirit is equivalent to another Xiantian level expert! This is the gap between a Xiantian and a Houtian warrior .Huang Xiaolong also thought of something: at the time when he breakthroughs to Xiantian, his martial spirits will be released in physical form and since his martial spirits are twin dragons, couldn\u2019t he fly into the sky with one foot on the black dragon and another foot on the blue dragon?With his superb talent martial spirits, how heaven\u2212defying would his strength be when he entered the Xiantian realm?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was the reason why Huang Qide spoiled Huang Wei to such an extent .Because Huang Wei possessed a grade ten martial spirit as long as no mishaps happened to Huang Wei, he would enter Xiantian realm in his lifetime .\u201cOne must have a grade ten and above martial spirit to breakthrough to the Xiantian realm?\u201d Huang Xiaolong asked .Fei Hou was silent for a while before he continued saying; \u201cNot necessarily, there were some people who were able to advance to Xiantian but the difficulty is much higher than having a grade ten martial spirits\u2013there have also been stories that say even some people with top grade eight martial spirits were able to advance . Pity there is little evidence to back up these stories . Among a hundred thousand people who possess top grade eight martial spirits, perhaps not one could step into Xiantian realm . As for grade seven, six, and five martial spirits, no matter how much effort or hard work they put in, they would never achieve it!\u201dHuang Xiaolong nodded; if his martial spirits were grade seven, then he would never be able to advance Xiantian no matter how much time and sweat he exuded!Fortunately, his martial spirits were not grade seven!\u201cThen, are there warriors above Xiantian realm?\u201d Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes burned into Fei Hou .Fei Hou was startled and subsequently nodded his head . \u201cSovereign, indeed there is a higher realm above Xiantian . Based on hearsay, the realm above Xiantian is referred to as the Saint realm, \u00a0and after one steps into the Saint realm, one\u2019s life span is extended to a thousand years . The body will be immune to poisons and be as hard as steel, akin to a having an immortal body . However, to have all that is harder than climbing up to Heaven!\u201d\u201cHarder than climbing up to Heaven?\u201d Huang Xiaolong was shocked .Fei Hou nodded his head: \u201cIn the Xiantian realm every level of breakthrough is much more difficult than the Houtian level take Senior Brother Haotian\u2013 as an example; he broke through to Xiantian more than thirty years ago . Only those who have superb martial talent have a chance of breaking through to the Saint realm . Even then only a few will get chance, it\u2019s not a \u00a0certainty!\u201d\u201cNot to mention the Luo Tong Kingdom, none of the hundreds of surrounding kingdoms have a Saint warrior . \u201dMore than a hundred kingdoms and not even one has a Saint realm warrior!Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes opened wide .How large is Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s populace? At the very least there are two or three billion people in each of the hundred or more kingdoms, that would equal more than two to three hundred billion people, but there wasn\u2019t even one Saint warrior?!\u201cThe truth was about ten years ago, your subordinate saw a Saint Warrior!\u201d And at this moment a respectful crept up Fei Hou when answering .A\u00a0 light lit up in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes .Fei Hou laughed out loud when he noticed Huang Xiaolong\u2019s look . \u201cThat year, your subordinate was in Duanren Empire\u2019s Royal City, but it was just a glimpse . \u201d Fei Hou\u2019s face was a little embarrassed when he mentioned this, as even he with his Tenth Order strength wasn\u2019t qualified to meet with a Sacred Warrior . \u00a0On that occasion, it was only by coincidence that he saw the Saint level expert flying across Duanren Empire\u2019s Royal City .\u201cDuanren Empire!\u201d This was the first time Huang Xiaolong heard this name .Fei Hou continued to explain, saying, \u201cLuo Tong Kingdom is one of the thousand kingdoms under Duanren Empire . Although the one hundred kingdoms around the Luo Tong Kingdom have no Saint level warrior, the Duanren Empire has a Saint level to protect the empire!\u201d\u201cOur continent is called Snow Wind Continent; other than the Duanren Empire, there are more than a dozen other empires, but only ours are composed of the human race . Apart from our human race, there are Beastmen, Elves, Dwarves, Ents, the Golden Giants, and others . \u201d Fei Hou explained .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s heart raced when he learned all this .Duanren Empire!Snow Wind Continent!Beastmen, elves, dwarves, ents, and the Golden Giants!This Martial Spirit world was actually this vast, wonderful and exciting!He wanted to practice, to become stronger! Then He would head towards the Duanren Empire to meet with the Saint warrior!One day, in the future he will be a Saint realm warrior of legends!A short while later, Fei Hou left . Huang Xiaolong sat in the garden alone, his heart unable to calm down for a long while .\u201cLet\u2019s first breakthrough Sixth Order before thinking about anything else . \u201d Huang Xiaolong stood up, shaking his head in a chuckle . The so-call Xiantian or Saint realm for the current him was too far away; what he needed to do now was advanced to the Sixth Order .He had a feeling that it would happen within two days .Returning to his room, Huang Xiaolong took out the cold jade bed from the Asura Ring, sat on it in the lotus position then began to run the Asura Tactics exercise law . His twin dragon martial spirits appeared, devouring the netherworld spiritual aura flowing down from the space above Huang Xiaolong .After leaving Huang Clan Manor four months ago, his twin dragon martial spirits had become not just bigger, but the scales of both black and blue dragons\u2019 have become tougher and denser and their claws looked stronger than before .The night passed in silence .Huang Xiaolong ended his practice when sunlight shone into the room through the window; returning the cold jade bed into the ring, Huang Xiaolong left the room . When he stepped out, he saw Haotian and Fei Hou both entering the yard .\u201cSaluting the Sovereign!\u201dHaotian and Fei Hou quickly knelt down in salute .Even though Marshal Haotian is a strong Xiantian expert, but when meeting the Sovereign, he still needed to kneel down in salute: this was the Asura\u2019s Gate rules!In Asura\u2019s Gate, the Sovereign was supreme above all!This rule was carved into every Asura\u2019s Gate\u2019s disciple to such an extent that even Huang Xiaolong as the current Sovereign was powerless to abolish it .Thus, Huang Xiaolong could only bear with it and ask them to rise .\u201cI want to go out to look around, and I\u2019d also want to buy a residence,\u201d said Huang Xiaolong, when both of them had gotten up . In his opinion, although Marshal Haotian is an Asura\u2019s Gate disciple, staying here in the Marshal Mansion for an extended time was inconvenient . If he had his own residence here in the Royal City, whether it was training or other matters, it would be much more convenient .Marshal Haotian was startled when he heard this and anxiously asked, \u201cSovereign, are the guards or servants performing unsatisfactorily? I will replace them in an instant!\u201dHuang Xiaolong shook his head and smiled, saying \u201cNo, it has nothing to do with them . I just want to buy a residence as it would be more convenient . \u201dWhen Haotian this heard this, he breathed out in relief; Huang Xiaolong was the Sovereign and since Huang Xiaolong already taken a position on the issue, he couldn\u2019t force the matter .\u201cThen this subordinate will accompany Sovereign to the property market to select a suitable resident,\u201d Haotian said .No need, just send two guards to come along, in addition there\u2019s Fei Hou so nothing will happen . \u201d Huang Xiaolong added after he paused for a moment \u2013 to have the Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s Marshal tagging along with him just to help him select a residence, there was no way he would be able to maintain a low profile in the future and Huang Xiaolong didn\u2019t wish to attract any attention . \u201cUnderstood . \u00a0Your Subordinate will arrange it . \u201d Haotian understood Sovereign\u2019s worries . Thus he agreed and replied respectfully .Concerning the things that happened at the Delicious Restaurant Marshal Haotian had already instructed the Generals and soldiers not to breathe a word about Huang Xiaolong\u2019s identity . So so far, none of the nobles and the influential families knew about the Marshal\u2019s \u2018Young Master\u2019 .A short while later, Haotian sent two of the Marshal Mansion\u2019s guards over to protect Huang Xiaolong . The two guards, Fei Hou, and Huang Xiaolong left the mansion walking towards the property market .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 44Chapter 44: Stolen From Our Auction HouseFour people, Huang Xiaolong, Fei Hou and the two guards from the Marshal\u2019s Mansion headed towards a cultivation technique and battle skill auction house (having decided to go there before heading to the property market) .While Huang Xiaolong was in the Silvermoon Forest he had gotten some gold coins from killing mercenaries, however, it was not enough money to buy a property; so Huang Xiaolong decided to auction off the cultivation technique, Black Moon Art which he had gotten from the Purple Robed Sword Sect Elder Chen Feng .Black Moon Art is a high-grade Mysterious rank exercise; it would definitely fetch a good price .Moments later, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s group of four arrived at a cultivation technique, and battle skill auction shop called Solitary Peak .Probably due to the early hours, the auction hall was empty when the four of them walked in .\u201cMay I ask if you gentlemen want to buy or sell cultivation techniques?\u201d asked the shop supervisor as he approached them (having seen the four of them as they walked in) .\u201cI want to auction a high-grade Mysterious rank cultivation technique . \u201d said Huang Xiaolong without preamble .\u201cMysterious high-grade!\u201d The supervisor was really surprised as he looked at Huang Xiaolong, in general people were rarely willing to sell a high-grade Mysterious rank technique and skill .\u201cCorrect . \u201d Huang Xiaolong answered lightly .\u201cPlease, please come inside so that we can discuss . \u201d The Supervisor\u2019s expression drastically changed, and he smiled broadly as he ushered the four of them into the inner hall . He quickly ordered servants to serve tea as Huang Xiaolong was seated, then he went to inform his superiors .Very soon, an old man in his sixties wearing a gold colored robe came into the hall followed by the previous supervisor, he was Solitary Peak\u2019s Elder Lin Yuan .As Lin Yuan came in, surprise flickered across his eyes as when he saw Huang Xiaolong .\u201cHe he, I\u2019m Solitary Peak Auction\u2019s LinYuan . I heard that Little Brother wants to auction a high-grade Mysterious rank cultivation technique,\u201d said Lin Yuan as he came in smiling .Huang Xiaolong didn\u2019t say anything but pretended to take something out from his robes while actually taking a black book out of the Asura Ring . He put the book on the table and opened to the first page .\u201cBlack Moon Art!\u201dLin Yuan was rather surprised as he had heard of Black Moon Art . After practicing this cultivation technique that trains in the yin energy of the moon; if one practices it especially at night, the power of this technique increases .Controlling his expression, Lin Yuan smiled saying, \u201cThis is definitely a high-grade Mysterious art; how does Little brother want this auction?\u201d\u201cI need money at the moment, so you offer a price . \u201d replied Huang Xiaolong after thinking for a moment .If he decided to auction the book, it would take two to three days before he could get the proceeds from the auction which was why Huang Xiaolong decided to sell it directly to the auction house, so that he wouldn\u2019t need to waste time .On hearing Huang Xiaolong\u2019s words, it was clear to Lin Yuan that Huang Xiaolong needed the money urgently, a pained expression appeared on his face as he said, \u201cThis Little Brother, you are aware that directly selling it will only fetch you a very low price . \u201d then, he continued with an air of magnanimity saying, \u201cBut I won\u2019t short change you, I offer you fifty thousand gold coins!\u201d His hand showed five fingers .\u201cFifty thousand gold coins?\u201d Huang Xiaolong sneered in his heart when he heard that . This old guy is really taking him as a little kid, trying to send him away with a measly fifty thousand gold?A high-grade Mysterious rank cultivation technique can reach a price as high as three hundred thousand gold coins minimum in an auction, so selling directly should at least bring him two hundred fifty thousand gold coins . Even a mid-grade Mysterious rank cultivation technique would cost at least one hundred thousand gold coins .Huang Xiaolong did not bother to continue negotiating but instead he retrieved the Black Moon Art from the table, got up and said to Fei Hou: \u201cLet\u2019s go . \u201d And the four prepared to leave .\u201cStop!\u201d yelled Lin Yuan, when he saw that the four were about to leave . His body then flashed, then he appeared beside Huang Xiaolong blocking his path with his hand . Suddenly more than ten gray robed guards rushed into the room .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s expression became cold, looking at them he asked, \u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201dLin Yuan\u2019s earlier smile vanished, as he said \u201cLittle Brother, why are you in a rush to leave, is it because of guilt? Does your cultivation technique manual have suspicious origins ?\u201dHuang Xiaolong returned Lin Yuan\u2019s look with a look full of interest of his own, \u201cMy manual's origin is suspicious?\u201dLin Yuan smirked, \u201cThat\u2019s right . Our auction house lost a high-grade Mysterious rank cultivation technique, the Black Moon Art a few days ago!\u201dHuang Xiaolong sneered in his heart, it seemed like this person wanted to force him to sell cheaply so he gave an excuse implying that the Black Moon Art was stolen from the Solitary Peak auction house .On Earth, Huang Xiaolong had come across this kind of forced sale situation a few times .\u201cHow about this, I won\u2019t make things difficult for you . \u201d said Lin Yuan in a cold tone: \u201cReturn the Black Moon Art to our Solitary Peak auction house, and we will let you leave . If not, stealing from us comes with dire consequences!\u201dNow, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t want to pay the fifty thousand gold coins which he had previously offered . With fifty thousand gold coins in his pocket it was enough for him to live happily for some time .He knew all the children of Royal City\u2019s nobles and prominent families\u2019 and Huang Xiaolong was not one of them so he dared to act in such a manner confident that Huang Xiaolong didn\u2019t have the means to seek revenge .He had done this a few times .Listening to the auction house\u2019s Elder slander Huang Xiaolong, saying the Black Moon Art was stolen from them, Fei Hou regarded him with interest, he stood next to Huang Xiaolong silently .However while Fei Hou could stomach it, the two guards from the Marshal\u2019s Mansion standing behind Huang Xiaolong couldn\u2019t . One of them stepped up and slapped Lin Yuan\u2019s cheek, and shouted in anger, \u201cAre your eyes blind, you dare to bully our Young Master!\u201d\u201cPa!\u2019That one slap sent Lin Yuan staggering back several steps, and a red five-finger print appeared on his right cheek .\u201cYou, you dare to attack me?!\u201d Lin Yuan\u2019s hand touched his burning cheek and roared . His eyes filled with killing intent . Because the two guards weren\u2019t wearing their uniforms, but instead wore normal robes, Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t recognize them .\u201cAttack, kill them all! Snatch back that Black Moon Art manual!\u201d Lin Yuan shouted anxiously; he flashed and appeared in front of Huang Xiaolong and struck out .But the moment he appeared before Huang Xiaolong, a silhouette suddenly cut in between them . Fei Hou slashed out, and swords sparks floated out like white snow-flakes .Startled, Lin Yuan tried to retreat but the many snow flake-like sword sparks melted into his body and Lin Yuan screamed as his body was sent back flying and crashed into a pillar .The two Marshal\u2019s Mansion guards\u2019 bodies were spinning, and with every turn, an auction house guard fell down .Having being sent to protect Huang Xiaolong by Marshal Haotian, these two guards\u2019 strength couldn\u2019t be weak; although they were yet to reach the Tenth Order but they both were at the peak late Ninth Order, so how could the auction house guards win against them!Very quickly all the gray clothed guards were lying on the floor moaning in pain, only then the two guards who followed Huang Xiaolong stopped .\u201cYoung Master, are you alright?\u201d Both of them stepped towards Huang Xiaolong and asked respectfully .\u201cI\u2019m alright . \u201d Huang Xiaolong shook his head . He walked towards the auction house Elder Lin Yuan who just got up and was leaning against the wall . Seeing Huang Xiaolong standing near him, he became frightened, \u201cLittle Brother\u2026 a misunderstanding, this is a misunderstanding! It\u2019s our mistake, we lost a cultivation technique a few days ago but it wasn\u2019t the Black Moon Art! I was mistaken, this pig head of mine, so stupid, deserving death!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

From the sounds of footsteps, it seemed that there were a lot of people outside .Joy surfaced on Lin Yuan\u2019s face .Moments later, a bearded middle-aged man with thick bushy eyebrows marched into the inner hall leading a dozen people with him, making a big entrance .The inner hall was big, even with so many people it didn\u2019t feel crowded at all .As the middle-aged man stepped into the inner hall, he saw more than ten gray-clothed guards of the Solitary Peak Auction House lying on the floor moaning in pain; his became even more sullen .\u201cPresident!\u201d Seeing the middle-aged man, Lin Yuan stumbled towards him in a panic: \u201cPresident, save me!\u201dThis bushy brow middle-aged man is Solitary Peak Auction House\u2019s President, Du Baize!\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Du Baize\u2019s expression turned cold .Lin Yuan hesitated for a moment, then quickly pointed his finger in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s direction and said, \u201cPresident, in the few days you weren\u2019t around, the auction house lost a high-grade Mysterious rank cultivation technique manual! It was these people who stole it!\u201dMysterious high-grade cultivation technique? When Du Baize heard this, his palm struck Elder Lin Yuan so hard that he flew back .Lin Yuan screamed as he flew off and crashed into a wall of the inner hall .The four corners of the inner hall were deadly silent and Huang Xiaolong, Fei Hou, and the two guards were stunned .Ashen faced, Lin Yuan quivered as he struggled to stand up, blood spurting from his mouth as one of his hand clutched his mouth . He looked unbelievably at President, \u201cPre-, President . \u201d\u201cYou mean to say they stole our cultivation technique and then brought it back to sell to us?\u201d demanded Du Baize as he stared coldly at Lin Yuan who was trying to stand up .Only an idiot would believe Lin Yuan\u2019s lie, which was so full of holes .Lin Yuan face turned a beet red, \u201cPresident, I, I,\"\u201cYou think that by covering up I won\u2019t find out about how you\u2019ve been doing forced sales? And on several occasions at that?\u201d Du Baize\u2019s eyes turned sharp as he glowered at Lin Yuan who trembled on hearing this and his face turned pale white . \u201cPresident, this, this is,\u201d\u201cEnough, you don\u2019t need to say anymore . If it weren\u2019t for your sister, I would\u2019ve crippled you long ago . I will deal with you afterward! Scram!\u201d Du Baize waved his hand, and two guards came and took Lin Yuan away .Du Baize then turned towards Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou, \u201cCustomers, my name is Du Baize; for this to happen, it is because I was lacking in management, I apologize to everyone . \"\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter . \u201d Huang Xiaolong replied, \u201cSince the issue has been resolved, there is no problem . \u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of cultivation technique Little Brother wanted to auction?\u201d Du Baize asked as he waved his hand sending away other guards that had rushed in with him earlier .Since the conflict was resolved, Huang Xiaolong did not intend to pursue such a small matter: he sat down on the same chair and took out the little black manual .\u201cHigh-grade Mysterious rank cultivation technique, Black Moon Art . \u201d Just like Lin Yuan, Du Baize was a little shocked as he looked at Huang Xiaolong and the little black book .\u201cThat\u2019s right . \u201d Huang Xiaolong added, \u201cI\u2019m in need of money at the moment, so I don\u2019t plan to auction it . I\u2019d like to sell it directly to the auction house, but I don\u2019t know what price President is willing to offer?\u201dDu Baize hesitated slightly before answering, \u201cThree hundred fifty thousand, but I don\u2019t know if Little Brother is satisfied with this offer?\u201dThree hundred and fifty thousand!Huang Xiaolong was slightly surprised .If this manual was auctioned, it could fetch that price, but he was dealing direct with the auction house and yet Du Baize still quoted such a high price .However, Huang Xiaolong quickly understood that Du Baize gave him such an offer because he wanted to show goodwill .Thus, Huang Xiaolong didn't feign politeness and sold the Black Moon Art manual for three hundred fifty thousand gold coins .A short while later, Du Baize personally sent Huang Xiaolong out .\u201cPresident, that Black Moon Art manual although it is a high-grade Mysterious rank cultivation technique, to buy it for three hundred fifty thousand, isn\u2019t that too high?\u201d Asked an Elder behind Du Baize cautiously, \u201cBesides, they also injured our guards . \u201dDu Baize looked at the four peoples as they walked away, a light flickered in his eyes and shook his head, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand . \u201d He had a feeling that these four weren\u2019t as simple as they seemed on the surface . If he could form a good relationship with Huang Xiaolong, it may very well bring enormous benefits for to the auction house will be much bigger .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s group of four headed to the property market after they had left the auction house . After going through some choices, Huang Xiaolong finally settled on a Tianxuan Courtyard at two hundred and fifty thousand gold coins .This Tianxuan Courtyard was quite close to the Marshal\u2019s Mansion which was three streets away, estimated at about half an hour\u2019s distance .And this Tianxuan Courtyard was spacious and spanned about a thousand square meters, which was one of the reasons why Huang Xiaolong chose it . Huang Xiaolong wanted to develop his own force and the large space would make training convenientEven though he is said to be Asura\u2019s Gate Sovereign, the Asura\u2019s Gate cannot be considered as his own power .After settling Tianxuan Courtyard matters, Huang Xiaolong went to the slave market with the three of them; after all, a mansion would need servants to maintain it .When Huang Xiaolong came out of the slave market, behind Fei Hou and the two guards were sixteen slaves . Four of them were Beastmen, two were from the Elf race, two were mountain dwarves, and the remaining eight were human . Fei Hou felt it strange that Huang Xiaolong even chose to buy two dwarves since normally people wouldn\u2019t choose them as servants, but Huang Xiaolong was the Sovereign so it was not his place to question his actions .With the newly bought slaves, Huang Xiaolong went straight back to his new mansion, Tianxuan Mansion, instead of returning to the Marshal\u2019s Mansion .Arriving at the Tianxuan Mansion, Huang Xiaolong took a tour around the mansion; in total, it had more than a dozen rooms, several small yards, and in the back, there was huge open space; Huang Xiaolong found the place very satisfactory . However, the mansion had been left empty for some time so some walls had paint peeling and weeds were growing all over the place .From among the sixteen slaves, Huang Xiaolong picked out a Beastmen called Boli, tasking him with cleaning the mansion along with others .After he had made the proper arrangements, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s group of four left the Tianxuan Mansion and returned to the Marshal\u2019s Mansion .Unexpectedly, half-way to the Marshal Mansion, Huang Xiaolong suddenly heard from behind the surprised cry of a familiar voice: \u201cXiaolong!\u201dHuang Xiaolong was startled and turned around, but a shadow had already leaped towards his direction: it was Li Lu!Shouldn\u2019t Li Lu be in Canglan County? How did she appear in the Royal City?\u201cXiaolong, it is really you!\u201d Li Lu ran towards Huang Xiaolong, a big smile on her face and hugged him .A girl\u2019s body fragrance entered his nose .Huang Xiaolong didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry . He didn\u2019t expect to run into Li Lu in the Royal City .\u201cXiaolong, why did you also come to the Royal City?\u201d Huang Xiaolong had yet to ask before Li Lu\u2019s happy voice sounded .Also come to the Royal City? Huang Xiaolong didn\u2019t know how to answer .\u201cDid you also come to register at the Cosmic Star Academy?\u201d asked Li Lu while Huang Xiaolong was still struggling to answer her first question .Note:Ate leopard guts \u2013 so extremely bravePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

These past few months, Li Lu has missed you very much . \"\u201cDad, what are you saying!\u201d protested Li Lu shyly, stamping her feet a couple of times .Li Cheng chuckled, and then turned around towards Fei Hou, \u201cGreetings, Senior Fei Hou . \u201dThe news had traveled that Fei Hou defeated Huang Clan Manor\u2019s Old Patriarch, Huang Qide, in one move thus revealing his peak late-Tenth Order strength\u2013 of course Li Cheng heard about it .Fei Hou slightly nodded, his expression remaining indifferent .\u201cXiaolong, have you found a place to stay? If not, let\u2019s stay together?\u201dThe Li Family\u2019s business dealt with silk and was relatively a large business . Thus, they have a small store and residence courtyard here in the Royal City . But their residence courtyard was about two hundred square feet, it couldn\u2019t compare to Huang Xiaolong\u2019s Tianxuan Courtyard .Stay together? Huang Xiaolong stared at Li Lu and swallowed his saliva before answering . \u201cNo need, I already found a place to stay . \u201d\u201cOh,\u201d Li Lu pouted, feeling disappointed but very quickly a smile appeared again on her face, showing two cute dimples, \u201cThis Royal City is very big, bigger than Canglan County City . Come! Let\u2019s go and have a look around!\u201d Li Lu was already pulling Huang Xiaolong\u2019s hand as she said that .Look around? Black lines appeared on Huang Xiaolong\u2019s forehead .Still, in the end, he was pulled around the city by Li Lu for more than an hour .More than an hour later, Huang Xiaolong finally escaped and returned to the Marshal\u2019s Mansion with Fei Hou and the two guards . Huang Xiaolong left early in the morning, and it was afternoon when he returned .In the Marshal Mansion, Huang Xiaolong invited Marshal Haotian over to his yard .\u201cSovereign,\u201d Haotian respectfully greeted upon seeing Huang Xiaolong .Huang Xiaolong pointed to chairs nearby and indicated that both Haotian and Fei Hou should sit, \u201cBoth of you, come sit . \u201dWhen both of them were seated, Huang Xiaolong said to Haotian, \u201cI would like to know about Cosmic Star Academy . \u201dHaotian paused, he didn\u2019t expect that Sovereign called him over to ask about Cosmic Star Academy; then, something occurred to him\u2013 Cosmic Star Academy is Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s elite academy, does the Sovereign want to enroll into the Academy?Immediately, Haotian told Huang Xiaolong about Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s history, and all he knew about it . He talked for twenty minutes or so before asking, \u201cSovereign, do you want to enroll into \u00a0Cosmic Star Academy?\u201dHuang Xiaolong practiced the Asura Tactics, and he had the Asura Sword Skill, and the Asura Demon Claw; therefore, in his opinion, it\u2019s not that important whether or not he got into the Cosmic Star Academy . But when Haotian asked, Huang Xiaolong did not deny it .Haotian continued to elaborate, \u201cIf Sovereign enrolls into Cosmic Star Academy, it will be helpful to Sovereign\u2019s practice . Every year, in Cosmic Star Academy, a competition is held between the different classes, then the different class years and the overall Academy, and every year\u2019s first place winner is eligible to enter the Dragon Flame Valley to practice . Dragon Flame Valley is a practice treasure land! Not only can it refine the physical body, but it also can improve battle qi grade!\u201d\u201cDragon Flame Valley, refining physical body, and improving battle qi grade!\u201dHuang Xiaolong was astonished . This was his first time hearing that there were things that could enhance battle qi grade!\u201cYes, Sovereign . This Dragon Flame Valley has a natural underground Dragon Vein and that is the reason why practicing in Dragon Flame Vally can refine and strengthen the body, and enhance battle qi quality! But it is only effective for those under the Tenth Order; after the Tenth Order, practicing in the Dragon Flame Valley has no significant benefits!\u201d added Fei Hou .Natural dragon vein!The Cosmic Star Academy actually has a natural dragon vein!A light flickered in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes . Although it only benefits those under the Tenth Order, it is already unbelievable enough . And for the current Huang Xiaolong, the benefits reaped would be great!\u201cApart from that, the first place of every class year is rewarded with a dan . First place first year, a high Grade Four Spirit Dan, first place second year is rewarded with an early Grade Five Spirit Dan, the third year's first place gets a mid-Grade Five Spirit Dan, and lastly, the overall Academy Champion gets a high Grade Five Spirit dan!\u201d Haotian explained in detail .High Grade Four Spirit Dan! Early Grade Five, mid Grade, and high Grade! Both of Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes were wide with disbelief; this Cosmic Star Academy was so generous, willing to come out with so many Grade Five Spirit Dans as rewards .Grade five Spirit Dans in the Luo Tong Kingdom can\u2019t be bought even if you have money!Grandfather Huang Qide's heart bled profusely when he gave the Grade Four Spirit Dan that he had kept for nearly twenty years to Huang Xiaolong . Instead, Huang Xiaolong gave the Dragon Tiger Fundamental Dan to his father, Huang Peng, and that was only a high Grade Four Spirit Dan .\u201cThe one who wins the overall Academy competition will be representing Cosmic Star Academy to Duanren Empire Imperial City for the \u00a0Imperial City Battle!\u201d Fei Hou said .\u201cHead to Duanren Empire \u00a0Imperial City for the Imperial City Battle!\u201d Huang Xiaolong\u2019s astonishment came from the bottom of his heart .\u201cCorrect, every year, all the first place Academy disciples under Duanren Empire\u2019s rule will travel to the Imperial City to compete in what is called the Imperial City Battle!\u201d Haotian continued to say, \u201cIn the competition, disciples that perform outstandingly, ranking within the first one hundred are eligible to enroll in Imperial City\u2019s Duanren Academy . Becoming a Duanren Academy disciple, and this is a great honor no matter how prestigious the family or kingdom\u201d\u201cAnd in that one hundred spots, from eleven to one hundred the disciples are rewarded with an early Grade Six Spirit Dan!\u201d\u201cSecond to the tenth place are rewarded mid-Grade Six Spirit Dan!\u201d\u201cAs for the champion, is rewarded with a high Grade Six Spirit Dan!\u201dHaotian was very excited as he spoke about the rewards that would be given .That\u2019s a high Grade Six Spirit Dan ah!A high Grade Six Spirit Dan is a much-coveted treasure for a Xiantian like him!Even Fei Hou was filled with longing .And Huang Xiaolong swallowed, a \u2018gulu\u2019 sound was heard .His mother*, that\u2019s a high Grade Six Spirit Dan!If a peak late-Tenth Order warrior swallowed it, he probably could breakthrough to Xiantian realm!Slowly, Huang Xiaolong calmed down .Then, Huang Xiaolong asked Haotian the Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s registration process and requirements .\u201cA Houtian warrior can register and with Sovereign\u2019s age, there won\u2019t be any problem . The basic requirements are aged twelve and under and the martial spirits must be at least be a grade nine . \u201d Haotian replied .\u201cGrade nine and above?\u201d Huang Xiaolong frowned: if it is necessary to check his martial spirits, then wouldn\u2019t his twin dragon martial spirits be exposed?\u201cActually, it doesn\u2019t matter if Sovereign doesn\u2019t have grade nine martial spirits\u2013 I can arrange for Sovereign's entry to the Academy . \u201d As Haotian had never seen Huang Xiaolong\u2019s martial spirits, upon noticing Huang Xiaolong\u2019s frown, he thought Huang Xiaolong\u2019s martial spirits doesn't meet the requirement .As the Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s only Marshal, he has the ability to arrange for a person to enter the Cosmic Star Academy .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Huang Xiaolong listened to Marshal Haotian misunderstanding, shook his head and smiled bitterly . After thinking for a moment, Huang Xiaolong said, \u201cThe truth is, it is not that my martial spirit doesn\u2019t reach grade nine . I am worried about my martial spirit being exposed . \u201dHaotian and Fei Hou exchanged a glance; Sovereign was worried about troubles that might arise if his martial spirit was exposed? In general, even if he possessed a grade ten martial spirit, he didn\u2019t need to worry about this matter, right?While Haotian and Fei Hou were still confused, suddenly a bright light shone from Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body and subsequently, two small dragons, one black one blue floated above Huang Xiaolong\u2019s head .Two oppressive auras that made the heart palpitate spread out from them and an aura that could have swept the world was exuded from Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body .Both of them were dazed as they stared at the martial spirits floating behind Huang Xiaolong, their bodies trembling, not daring to believe the scene before them .\u201cTwin, twin martial spirits!\u201d cried out Fei Hou in a shaky voice .Sovereign\u2019s martial spirit turned out to be the legendary twin martial spirits!\u201cA Dragon? Twin Dragons? Superb talent twin martial spirits!\u201d Marshal Haotian quivered with excitement, his tongue knotted and he started to mumble incoherently .Heavens ah, twin superb martial spirits!This actually are Sovereign\u2019s martial spirits!Both Haotian and Fei Hou became so excited that they felt faint .Without warning, both of them jumped off their seats and prostrated before Huang Xiaolong .\u201cSovereign invincible throughout!\u201d\u201cSovereign invincible throughout!\u201dThey lauded the words every time they lowered their head in prostration, their usual calmness and indifference lost in their excitement .Huang Xiaolong was stupefied at the sight of Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou repeatedly bowing while shouting slogans . Speechless, he laughed bitterly in his mind . It\u2019s just superb talent twin martial spirits, do you both need to be so excited ah?\u201cBoth of you, stand up . \u201d said Huang Xiaolong finally .But, both Haotian and Fei Hou did not stand up .Marshal Haotian beamed in elation, tears welling up in his eyes as he said, \u201cSovereign, superb martial spirits, this is Heaven\u2019s blessing to our Asura\u2019s Gate ah! Our Asura\u2019s Gate will definitely rise again, rebuilding our past glory!\u201dSuperb twin martial spirits!Such a rare talent, not to mention the Duanren Empire or even the entire Snow Wind Continent did not have one since they were so very few!The Duanren Empire was built over two thousand years ago, and yet to date there hasn\u2019t been even one twin martial spirits emerging in its history .Fei Hou was no exception, babbling nonsensically to himself .It took ten minutes for their excitement to subside a bit before both of them were willing to stand up, but they still had not fully calmed down .\u201cThe matter about my martial spirits must not be leaked out . \u201d Huang Xiaolong reminded when Haotian and Fei Hou stood up .\u201cSovereign, rest assured . \u00a0Even if we die, we will not say a word about Sovereign\u2019s martial spirits!\u201d Fei Hou and Haotian once again knelt down in oath .Huang Xiaolong nodded: he revealed this secret because he trusted them due to the fact Fei Hou and Haotian were absolutely loyal to Asura\u2019s Gate .Huang Xiaolong told them to rise and asked, \u201cCan you tell me the grade of my twin martial spirits?\u201dHaotian and Fei Hou were stunned and exchanged a look between themselves, but neither of them spoke . Some time passed before Haotian finally opened his mouth, saying seriously, \u201cIn general, black dragon martial spirits are graded ten . However, from what I can see, this black dragon differs from the usual black dragon . Sovereign\u2019s black dragon should be a variation and as for the blue dragon, there is no record of it . \u201d\u201cNo record?\u201d Huang Xiaolong was astounded .\u201cYes, Sovereign . In the Snow Wind Continent, there hasn\u2019t been a time where a blue dragon martial spirit appeared before . Although I can\u2019t determine the grade of Sovereign\u2019s blue dragon, I can say that the blue dragon is much stronger than the black variant dragon . \u201d Haotian said .Huang Xiaolong was surprised, a blue dragon martial spirit had never appeared on the Snow Wind Continent? Does this mean his blue dragon is unique, one of a kind?Then Huang Xiaolong asked more questions about black dragon martial spirits .A while later, both Haotian and Fei Hou left .After both of them left, Huang Xiaolong remained seated in the garden musing . Although he was unable to determine his martial spirits grade, he could confirm that it was above grade twelve . \u00a0Huang Xiaolong then thought of Duanren Empire\u2019s Imperial City Battle, and Asura\u2019s Gate internal strife, and in the end, Li Lu crossed his mind .\u201cBetter not to think too much about these things, it\u2019s better train harder . \u201d Huang Xiaolong stood up\u2013 he wanted to breakthrough to Sixth Order before enrolling into the Cosmic Star Academy .Huang Xiaolong returned to his room and took out the cold jade bed, he sat on the bed and began to run Asura Tactics while the twin dragons appeared behind him, devouring the emerging netherworld spiritual aura . \u00a0Battle qi roared in his meridians and veins and crashed against the sixth order barrier .The situation continued like this as time flowed on without notice . Then, out of nowhere, a crack resembling the sound of an egg shell breaking that only Huang Xiaolong could hear broke the silence .Joy was evident in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes .Sixth Order breakthrough!Battle qi flowed into wider meridians in waves through the body, flooding it with thicker battle qi .The night passed .Huang Xiaolong came out of his room, did some light warm-ups, and headed to the garden . His palm suddenly struck an iron stake; and a one-inch dent with his palm print appeared on the iron stake, making it vibrate endlessly .After advancing to the Sixth Order, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s battle qi now is equivalent to a dozen stones, and the strength of each palm reached two thousand jin .At the same time, Huang Xiaolong noticed that when his palm struck out, his muscles\u2019 explosive power was higher than it used to be and was much firmer .To test his power and strength after advancing to the Sixth Order, Huang Xiaolong leaped up, the twin blades appearing in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s hand, and he swung down . A myriad of sword rays transformed into a violent rain storm dominating the yard, the wind whistling as loud as thunder .Despite that, the strange thing was that even though the whole yard was in the storm area, the grass and flowers weren\u2019t affected, leading one to think that the attack did not affect the ground .After the first strike, Huang Xiaolong swung the second strike; this time the myriad of sword lights became drizzles and each drop the size of a small fly . Without truly focusing, it was difficult to hear the sound of it .The past few months of practice had increased his comprehension made understanding of Tears of Asura to rise even more .He repeated this routine and two days were gone in a blink .In these past two days, Huang Xiaolong did not once leave the yard . All his time was spent practicing the Asura Tactics, the Body Metamorphose Scripture, and the Tears of Asura .On the third day, Marshal Haotian came to see Huang Xiaolong with a recommendation letter for the Cosmic Star Academy .He stayed for a while, highlighting the things that Huang Xiaolong needed to pay attention to and then arranged for the same bodyguards to follow Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou to Cosmic Star Academy for enrollment .The Cosmic Star Academy was located to the north of Royal City\u2019s center, not too far from the Marshal\u2019s Mansion . One hour later, the group of four arrived at the huge Cosmic Star Academy gates .What depressed Huang Xiaolong was that the moment he arrived, he ran into Li Lu\u2019s group who were there for the same reason .\u201cXiaolong!\u201d exclaimed Li Lu when she spotted Huang Xiaolong at the gates, and just like she did the previous day, she ran into his arms .Note:1 jin = 500g (2000 jin = 1000kg)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Will be releasing this week's last chapter tmr before the team takes a short breakfor the holidays!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Every piece of Starlight Stone is worth a thousand gold\u2013 in such a huge square, how many Starlight Stones were that? This Cosmic Star Academy is really wealthy and influential .There were already many people already gathered in the huge square, a few hundred in number: and they all came for the Academy registration .Huang Xiaolong and the others looked around, then headed to the registration spot .Arriving at the registration spot, they saw that the person in charge of reception was a twenty-something year old woman with arched brows and phoenix eyes . So fair was her skin that it seemed transparent to the bone; She was stunning! with a cold temperament .\u201cHello Teacher, we came to register!\u201d Li Lu walked up and said, her cute dimples making an appearance .Xiong Meiqi looked up, seeing Li Lu\u2019s adorable dimples her cold face loosened a little . With a faint smile she nodded and asked: \u201cName, age . \u201dLi Lu answered all politely .After recording everything down, Xiong Meiqi gave Li Lu a wooden plate then told Li Lu to go into the inner hall to test her martial spirit and other procedures .Despite stating requirements of grade a nine and above martial spirit and being under the age of twelve, there were still additional assessments to be taken .Receiving the wooden plate, Li Lu stood one side to wait for Huang Xiaolong .At this point, Huang Xiaolong walked up and withdrew a recommendation letter .Seeing that Huang Xiaolong took out a recommendation letter, the amiable attitude she displayed with Li Lu vanished into thin air and was replaced with a frosty expression . Dislike and contempt shone from her eyes; she hated these types of disciples that didn\u2019t have grade nine martial spirits and instead, relied on their family\u2019s connection to get a recommendation for Cosmic Star Academy for special enrollment .\u201cName, age!\u201d Xiong Meiqi snapped .\u201cHuang Xiaolong, nine and a half years old . \u201d Huang Xiaolong answered .Xiong Mei roughly recorded the information, and took out a plate about two thumbs size, with starlight twinkling and flung it to the floor, saying, \u201cThis is your student plate . \u201dThe twinkling student plate fell right beside Huang Xiaolong\u2019s feet, it was extremely obvious that the plate did not fall by accident .Seeing this, Fei Hou and the two guards became angry, but just as they were about to step forward, Huang Xiaolong stopped them and shook his head . Only then did the three endure and restrain themselves .Fei Hou picked up the student plate .Since Xiong Meiqi threw his student plate on the floor, Huang Xiaolong was no longer inclined in being polite with such a person, his voice sounded cold as he asked \u201cWhere do I pay the fees?\u201dXiong Meiqi retorted icily , \u201cAre you dumb?! Can\u2019t you to ask someone else?\u201d\u201cInsolent!\u201d When Fei Hou heard Xiong Meiqi actually dare to insult his Sovereign as a dumb, his Tenth Order oppressive atmosphere was instantly released .Xiong Meu blanked for a moment realizing Fei Hou was a peak late-Tenth Order warrior, but instead of fear, she laughed coldly, \u201cWant to make trouble?\u201d Saying that, Xiong Meiqi went all out, and her martial spirit appeared in the air behind her .Xiong Meiqi\u2019s martial spirit was actually a butterfly!But, her butterfly wasn\u2019t the common type; hers had eight wings colored \u00a0golden-silver and a halo of colors surrounded its entire body .\u201cSeven-Colored Butterfly!\u201d This was beyond Huang Xiaolong\u2019s expectation .The Rainbow Butterfly was a rare kind of martial spirit; although it was a grade nine martial spirit, it was considered average .Martial spirits of the same grade are further classified into: average, top, and apex classifications .At this time, from different directions of the square, three silhouettes flew over to Huang Xiaolong\u2019s location at high speed and soon, the three figures appeared before them . All three people wore similar clothing to Xiong Meiqi, the Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s teacher uniform apparently the newly arrived people were also academy teachers .One of the three had a vertical slit on his forehead akin to having a third eye, adding a devilish charm .Arriving at the location, the slit on his forehead moved as he turned to Xiong Meiqi, asking, \u201cMeiqi, what happened?\u201d as his question ended; his gaze fell on Fei Hou .Xiong Meiqi burned with indignation glaring at Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou: \u201cJust a waste of a student with a recommendation letter who is relying on a family\u2019s background to cause trouble!\u201dA waste with a recommendation letter!Relying on family\u2019s influence!Causing trouble!Huang Xiaolong\u2019s face instantly turned cold . Initially, he found this woman unpleasant, but now it shot up to total dislike; even if Huang Xiaolong was registering into the academy with a recommendation letter and not through assessments, this was the Academy\u2019s issue, this ugly woman had no authority to interfere, she\u2019s only a teacher . By trying to vent her dissatisfaction on him, this woman chose the wrong prey .\u201cOh, so it is a waste student bringing a recommendation letter; kid, if you\u2019re trying to make trouble you found the wrong place! Why don\u2019t you look around and realized where you are standing!\u201d The man, Zhong Yuan barked at Huang Xiaolong, and continued in a cold tone, \u201cNow, kneel down and apologize to Teacher Xiong, and we will forgive this matter, otherwise\u2026!\u201dThose coming to register with recommendations usually had strong backgrounds, therefor in Zhong Yuan\u2019s opinion just punishing him by asking him to kneel down and apologize for his actions was already very tolerant and magnanimous!Otherwise, he would have revoked this kid\u2019s qualification and told them to scram!Kneel down and apologize? When Fei Hou and the two guards heard that the man wanted Huang Xiaolong to kneel down and apologize, their anger soared, and at this point, Huang Xiaolong shifted his attention to Zhong Yuan . Pointing at Xiong Meiqi, he sneered sarcastically, \u201cI also give you and this female bear a choice, kneel down and apologize to me, or else\u2026!\u201d A cold, sharp light glinted in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes .Since these two people him and were giving him trouble, he would grant them their wishes .That no one dared to do so past didn\u2019t mean no one would in the future!By this time, those who came to register with their family had crowded around them; hearing Huang Xiaolong wanted two teachers to kneel down and apologize, shocked gasps echoed within the crowd .This brother is too f**king awesome!Xiong Meiqi and Zhong Yuan were shocked senseless; their faces turned red and deepened to purple in a fury; a waste relying on a recommendation letter to enroll was so brazen, and dared to tell them to kneel down and apologize to him instead!That Xiong Meiqi pointed at Huang Xiaolong, her voluptuous bosom rose and fell as she hollered: \u201cI\u2019m revoking your qualification this instant, get out of here with your three slaves!\u201dHuang Xiaolong jeered, \u201cYou want to revoke my qualification? a mere teacher like you doesn\u2019t have the qualification!\u201d What Huang Xiaolong said was a fact, only the Principal had the right to revoke the registration of students who registered through a recommendation .Note:Niubi \u2013 f**king awesome/ overwhelmingly domineering and strong(can be used in feeling fear or comedic situation)Repeats in coming chapter, pls let me know if you guys want it in pinyin or translated version .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

According to the Academy\u2019s regulations, only the Vice Principal and above had the right to revoke special admission students like Huang Xiaolong .She had uttered the words in anger, forgetting this one detail .Zhong Yuan, however, snorted and disputed Huang Xiaolong's words, \u201cAlthough we don\u2019t have the authority to rescind your qualification, we have the right to propose and insist on your disqualification . Moreover, you caused trouble in the Academy, and us teachers have the right to detain and hand you over to the Disciplinary Hall . \u201dAfter Zhong Yuan had said his piece, a bright light shone from his as Zhong Yuan released his martial spirits .And his martial spirits was a mountain!A triangular black mountain that has three eyes .\u201cThe Three-Eyed Black Mountain!\u201dLike Fei Hou\u2019s Silver River martial spirit, the Three-Eyed Black Mountain is also martial spirits base on nature \u2013 Fei Hou\u2019s Silver River were a variation of a natural river, and the Three-Eyed Black Mountain born of a variational mountain .Zhong Yuan immediately soul transformed after releasing his martial spirits, his body became covered with a layer of black armor and he struck out at Huang Xiaolong .Although Zhong Yuan said he wanted to detain Huang Xiaolong, yet his strike was powerful enough to kill Huang Xiaolong and more likely than not, Huang Xiaolong would have been crippled even if he escaped death .Facing this, Huang Xiaolong became even colder, and the words slowly came out: \u201cKill . . . him!\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master!\u201d Fei Hou had been waiting for this instruction from Huang Xiaolong, acknowledged loudly . He released his Silver River martial spirits and soul transformed, punching out meeting the opponent straight on .The two guards from the Marshal\u2019s Mansion fought against Xiong Meiqi and the other two teachers .\u201cBoom!\u201dPlangent blasts resounded as Zhong Yuan and Fei Hou\u2019s attack collided, and Zhong Yuan was seen staggering backward; the black armor protecting him dimmed considerably .\u201cYou, peak late-Tenth Order!\u201d Zhong Yuan was flabbergasted looking at Fei Hou . Earlier, what Fei Hou revealed was early Tenth Order warrior\u2019s atmosphere which led Zhong Yuan to think Fei Hou was just some general Tenth Order . Never would he imagined Fei Hou to be a peak late-Tenth Order! A warrior with Silver River martial spirits peak late-Tenth Warrior!In the Cosmic Star Academy, there were a few Tenth Order warriors but a peak late Tenth Order was scarce . And since he was a third-year teacher, he was only a mid-Tenth Order .Fei Hou disregarded Zhong Yuan\u2019s shocked expression; after he fended off Zhong Yuan with the first punch, Fei Hou reappeared in front of him in a blink of an eye, and struck again: \u201cHeart Shattering Fist!\u201dA big fist-print pierced through across the distance, the space cracking from the force .Face full of fear, Zhong Yuan gritted his teeth, and ruthlessness gleamed in his eyes: the vertical slit in his forehead suddenly split opened revealing a black protruding eye . This was Zong Yuan\u2019s martial spirit\u2019s innate ability .\u201cDivine Soul Eye!\u201dA dark black light burst out from the third eye on Zong Yuan\u2019s forehead and the black light amassed into a large black-colored eyeball that exuded a strong eerie atmosphere, causing everyone to shiver involuntarily .The black eye formed from the black light collided with Fei Hou\u2019s fist .\u201cBoom!\u201dIn the collision, black eyeball continuously emitted plosion of sounds that exploded in the air . The strong wave of impact shook and repelled Zhong Yuan .Fei Hou too staggered back . His brain was buzzing with a sound that wouldn't disappear and everything vanished from his sight leaving only a huge black eyeball staring at him .While Zhong Yuan staggered, his attention was on Fei Hou and when he noticed Fei Hou\u2019s lost and confused eyes, a cold sneer appeared on his face; this was where his martial spirits ability had an advantage, it had the ability to quietly affect the enemy\u2019s body causing their eyes to see illusions .A cruel glint flashed across Zhong Yuan\u2019s eyes: without wasting any time, Zhong Yuan flew at Fei Hou preparing for the next assault, a finger aimed at Fei Hou\u2019s temple .\u201cPiercing Finger Style!\u201dBattle qi swirled fiercely around Zhong Yuan\u2019s finger, creating a vortex of finger-print as it inched closer to Fei Hou\u2019s temple . Suddenly, the lost and confused Fei Hou turned sharp and focused . A sharp light flickered in Fei Hou's eyes . The Silver River martial spirits wound around Fei Hou and with every rotation, the Silver River expanded a fold .\u201cDivine Soul Eye?\u201d\u201cNow, it\u2019s my turn to let you see my martial spirit\u2019s ability!\u201dFei Hou had a condescending sneer on his face as the Silver River swiftly enhanced five-times strength splintering Zhong Yuan\u2019s incoming attack .Zhong Yuan screamed, and his body was hurled off more than ten meters away, crashing down onto the square .The students who crowded to watch had already fled far away in all four directions seeing Zhong Yuan defeated by Fei Hou before their eyes . All of them were petrified on the spot and silence filled the huge square .Li Cheng and Li Lu\u2019s heart trembled witnessing this scene .Li Cheng was shocked because of the recommendation letter in Huang Xiaolong hand; needless to say, this recommendation letter couldn\u2019t be from Huang Clan Manor\u2019s Old Patriarch . Not to mention Old Manor Lord, even the Canglan County\u2019s most powerful person couldn\u2019t get a recommendation letter for Cosmic Star Academy .Li Cheng was taken aback by Fei Hou\u2019s strength, but more than that was Huang Xiaolong actually ordered Fei Hou to injure a Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s teacher!Ah! This is the Cosmic Star Academy!What is Huang Xiaolong\u2019s backup?Furthermore, since when did Huang Xiaolong have another two Ninth Order warriors?!This was because the two guards wore commoners clothes instead of their usual uniforms . Thus, no one knew the two came from the Marshal\u2019s Mansion .Nearby, Xiong Meiqi who was fighting against the two guards saw Zhong Yuan\u2019s miserable ending, was stunned .More than ten meters away, Zhong Yuan trembled as he crawled up, eyes widened with fear staring at Fei Hou: \u201cMartial Spirit Strengthening!\u201dStrengthening\u00a0martial spirits were amongst the strongest of innate abilities, and Zhong Yuan didn\u2019t expect Fei Hou\u2019s martial spirits to possess this particular skill .And at this point, from a distance away, a dozen or so figures rushed over, with the whistling behind them as their auras burst out, overwhelming those on the square .Huang Xiaolong turned around and saw a dozen figures flying over and his vision narrowed . Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s expert finally arrived! Huang Xiaolong\u2019s attention fell on the foremost most person where the strongest aura originated from \u2013 an old fellow in his sixties .This old fellow\u2019s aura was slightly stronger than Fei Hou\u2019s but way weaker than Haotian; he should be a borderline peak late-Tenth Order warrior waiting to breakthrough to Xiantian .\u201cVice Principal!\u201d Seeing the person who arrived, Zhong Yuan cried out in elation .But it can\u2019t compare to the delight Xiong Meiqi felt as she called out: \u201cDad!\u201dDad!The Vice Principal was actually that female bear\u2019s father?Huang Xiaolong was a little jolted, and Fei Hou was also a little surprised by this event .By this time, everyone had stopped fighting; the two guards retreated beside Huang Xiaolong .Xiong Chu and Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s experts arrived, took a look around and saw the heavily injured Zhong Yuan; frowning, he asked, \u201cWhat is happening?\u201dZhong Yuan had yet to open his mouth when Xiong Meiqi rushed forward and said, \u201cDad, this waste with recommendation letter brought his guards over to our Academy to make trouble! A useless waste like this, you absolutely must revoke his qualifications!\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d Xiong Chu couldn\u2019t help but take another look at Huang Xiaolong . The Cosmic Star Academy had been there for more than one hundred years\u2013 this was the first time someone dared to create trouble here in the Academy .\u201cVice Principal, merely revoking his registration qualification is letting them off too lightly . \u201d Zhong Yuan interrupted at this point, looking at Fei Hou full of loathing . \u201cThis person injured Academy\u2019s teachers so he ought to be beheaded . Otherwise, anybody can come and create trouble at the Academy!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This waste deserves death! Not only him, the three guards behind him are just the same . Waste that relies on a family background!\u201dXiong Meiqi pointed at Huang Xiaolong, \u201cThey should all be detained, let their family's elder come here personally to collect them and publicly apologize to our Academy!\u201dListening to this, Huang Xiaolong sneered but kept silent; he wanted to see what that female black bear's father would do .Xiong Chu\u2019s expression remained calm as he looked at Huang Xiaolong and the three people around him while he listened to his daughter and Zhong Yuan's explanation; in the end, he said to his daughter, \u201cBring me the recommendation letter . \u201dXiong Meiqi was stunned but still obediently took out the recommendation letter .Xiong Chu took the recommendation letter and when he saw a minuscule mark at the bottom of the letter, his eyes narrowed! Without a doubt, this letter was sent out by the Principal!In every batch of new students, only ten recommendation letter was allocated and all these were handled by him, Xiong Chu, but this time there was an exception . The Principal that didn\u2019t bother with this matter in the past actually requested one letter from him two days ago .And this little one's recommendation letter was sent out personally by the Principal .Since the Principal gave it, he doesn't have the right to handle this matter; this waste came with the Principal\u2019s recommendation letter, so he could only hand the matter over to the Principal .Xiong Chu kept the letter with him and after some quick thinking, he said to Huang Xiaolong, \u201cLittle one, as long as you and your three guards apologize, I will forget and not pursue this matter any further . \u201dForget and not pursue!Everyone present went blank, unable to believe it .A Cosmic Star Academy teacher was injured, yet just apologies are enough?!\u201cDad, you!\u201d Xiong Meiqi was so anxious that she blurted out the words and before she can say more, Xiong Chu waved his hand at her, saying, \u201cEnough, you don\u2019t need to say more . \u201dThe words choked in Xiong Meiqi\u2019s throat and having no say about the matter, she threw Huang Xiaolong a vicious glare .Just when everyone thought Huang Xiaolong would openly apologize, what came out was, \u201cWhy must we apologize? I want them to apologize to me!\u201d his finger pointed at Xiong Meiqi when he finished .\u201cWhat?!\u201d the words resounded through the square and shocked the onlookers as they looked Huang Xiaolong in amazement; could this kid be insane? Didn\u2019t he understand the Cosmic Star Academy Vice Principal Xiong Chu\u2019s meaning?\u201cWhat did you say? Want us to apologize?!\u201d Xiong Meiqi almost exploded in anger; she was already dissatisfied when father only told them to apologize, but the other side still acted like before, wanting them to apologize instead!\u201cDad, you\u2019ve seen it yourself, this waste simply does not put Cosmic Star Academy in his eyes!\u201d Xiong Meiqi said as she turned toward Xiong Chu, almost yelling .Xiong Chu was looking at Huang Xiaolong the entire time, his face gloomy; this waste who got the Principal\u2019s recommendation letter is too obtuse, not knowing when to retreat . He had been very generous to let the matter settle with the other side apologizing, giving the Principal face, but this boy wants a foot after being given an inch!Huang Xiaolong smirked, and his cold eyes fell on Xiong Meiqi, \u201cYou repeated over and over again that I\u2019m a waste, that we came to make trouble; since this is the way it is, go take out the square\u2019s recording globe . Let everyone see how exactly did we cause trouble!\u201dA recording globe is a tool used to survey and record images, and in a huge square such as this one under the Cosmic Star Academy, there definitely are some placed around the square .Xiong Chu\u2019s expression turned cold, \u201cGo, bring the square\u2019s recording globe over!\u201d\u201cYes, Vice Principal!\u201d one of the teachers acknowledged with respect and hurried off . Very quickly he returned, with his hand holding something that looked similar to a crystal ball .\u201cPlay the recording globe!\u201d Xiong Chu said .The same teacher initiated battle qi and imbued it into the recording globe . Within moments, moving images projected in mid-air and from the images, what happened earlier can be seen clearly .First, it showed Xiong Meiqi flinging Huang Xiaolong\u2019s student plate to the floor, and then Zhong Yuan and two teachers rushed over and arrived, telling Huang Xiaolong to kneel down and apologize . Subsequently, Zhong Yuan attacked Huang Xiaolong and ended up being injured by Fei Hou protecting Huang Xiaolong .Xiong Meiqi and Zhong Yuan looked gloomier by the second as the images flashed by .Students and their families gathered from four directions as the truth revealed itself, started to whisper amongst themselves .Watching the images repeating the incident, Xiong Chu\u2019s gloomy expression gradually turned sullen .Once the display ended, Huang Xiaolong sneered and said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t make trouble, yet you accused us; that so-called teacher wanted to kill me, my bodyguard retaliated in defense, this is called making trouble? Should I have stood here and let him kill me to not make trouble?\u201d one finger pointed at Zhong Yuan .Zhong Yuan tried to hide, don\u2019t know how to answer; at the same filled with anger and hatred .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s attention was on Xiong Chu, said, \u201cNow, things are clear as day; since it wasn\u2019t us who started this why must we be the one to apologize? Don\u2019t say just because they are the Academy\u2019s teachers?\u201dXiong Chu was reticent .\u201cDad!\u201d At this moment, Xiong Meiqi wanted to justify her actions, but was cut off by Xiong Chu shouting: \u201cHold your tongue!\u201d Xiong Chu turned to look at Huang Xiaolong, saying, \u201cLittle one, how about this, your registration and tuition fees for this year are exempted . This matter is considered solved!\u201dRegistration and tuition fees all exempted!The new students were stunned, their gazes zooming towards Huang Xiaolong .Injuring an Academy teacher was not only fine and dandy, he even had all fees exempted!Staring straight at Xiong Chu, Huang Xiaolong slowly nodded his head, and said to Fei Hou and the two guards, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d The four left the square .Watching Huang Xiaolong\u2019s receding silhouette, each had a different expression on their face .Xiong Chu did not say another word, his figure flashed and vanished from the square . Thus, the crowd gradually dispersed .In one of Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s chambers .Xiong Chu was seated, a soft trace of starlight shimmered from his body . The mood of the huge chamber was stifling, making it hard to breathe .Xiong Meiqi and Zhong Yuan had stood behind Xiong Chu for a very long time, but they dared not speak .\u201cThat little one\u2019s recommendation letter comes from the Principal . \u201d After a long time, Xiong Chu suddenly spoke .Xiong Meiqi and Zhong Yuan were shocked; sent by the Principal! This!\u201cWell, both of you leave . \u201d Xiong Chu spoke again .When Xiong Meiqi wanted to say something, Zhong Yuan tugged at her sleeves, his eyes telling her not to . Zhong Yuan saluted silently, turned and left the chamber .Leaving Cosmic Star Academy, Huang Xiaolong went to Tianxuan Mansion instead of returning to the Marshal Mansion . Arriving in Tianxuan Mansion, Huang Xiaolong took a look around, and after two days of cleaning, the weeds that grew along the corridors and the bedroom dust were all gone .Huang Xiaolong ordered the Beastman Boli to gather all sixteen slaves and enquired about mansion matters . Afterwards, Huang Xiaolong gave Beastman Boli some gold coins to buy some furniture and flowers to decorate Tianxuan Mansion .Huang Xiaolong intended to live and train here once the Academy starts . Tinaxuan Mansion was much closer to the Academy and Academy disciples are allowed to stay outside the dormitory .Settling mansion matters, Huang Xiaolong headed back with Fei Hou and the two guards\u201cWhat?! Cosmic Star Academy teachers dared to attack Young Master?\u201d After returning to Marshal Mansion, the two guards quickly reported what happened today in the Academy to Marshal Haotian .

Spit it out!\u201d Marshal Haotian roared .\u201cYes, Marshal\u2013 that woman said to first detain Young Master and then summon you to go and collect him back before publicly apologizing to the Academy!\u201d The guards quickly revealed everything in a shaky voice .At that time, Xiong Meiqi said to detain Huang Xiaolong and let his family\u2019s elders to come and bring him back after publicly apologizing to the Academy . But, what Xiong Meiqi wasn\u2019t aware was that Huang Xiaolong\u2019s \u2018elder\u2019 happens to be Marshal Haotian .\u201cWhat?!\u201d Marshal Haotian stood up in anger, the hard-as-rock side stool turning into scattered powder .\u201cAlso, the man wanted Fei Hou Senior to be beheaded to deter the public!\u201d The other guard added .Behead Junior Brother to deter the public?Marshal Haotian\u2019s fury reached a point of no return and shouted, \u201cRelay this Marshal\u2019s order: ten infantry brigades to pressure Cosmic Star Academy!\u201dTen infantry brigades, that\u2019s one hundred thousand soldiers!One hundred thousand soldiers to pressure Cosmic Star Academy!This greatly shocked the two guards .\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you moving quickly?!\u201d Seeing the two of them was still standing in the room, Marshal Haotian yelled aloud .\u201cYes, yes Marshal!\u201d The two guards ran out to relay the order in a frantic .\u201cIronclaw Condor!\u201d after the two left, Marshal Haotian called loudly towards the sky above and a huge gray condor appeared above the Marshal Mansion and a loud sharp cry rang out several li away .All the mansion\u2019s guards and servants looked up at the condor\u2019s figure and each of their expression changed: something big was going to happen! Only for grave and serious matters would the Marshal call the Ironclaw Condor .\u201cAll Marshal Mansion\u2019s guards Eighth Order and above, gather at the square!\u201d Then, everyone in the mansion heard Marshal Haotian\u2019s booming voice .\u201cYes Marshal!\u201dAt the same moment, silhouettes flashed and disappeared from different corners of the mansion, heading to the square in the Marshal Mansion .A pre-war like tension spread throughout the mansion .Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou who were in their own yard also heard Haotian\u2019s voice .\u201cLet\u2019s go and take a look . \u201d Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou arrived at the square and saw Marshal who was ready to lead one hundred thousand soldiers to the Cosmic Star Academy .In an instant, Huang Xiaolong understood what Marshal Haotian planned to do .\u201cWait!\u201d\u201cYoung Master!\u201d seeing Huang Xiaolong in the square, Marshal Haotian leaped off the condor and saluted .\u201cHaotian, I don\u2019t want the matter to become bigger . \u201d said after Huang Xiaolong thought about it for a moment\u2013 if things spiraled out of control, whether for Huang Xiaolong or Marshal Haotian, it wouldn\u2019t be a good thing .He knew that his recommendation letter was given to Haotian by Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s Principal showing their good relation . If Marshal Haotian led such a large infantry to the Academy, it surely would make their friendship awkward and at that time the conflict would be harder to resolve .Furthermore, they are in the Royal City: such a big movement would harm Marshal Haotian\u2019s reputation .\u201cYoung Master!\u201d Haotian wanted to say more, but Huang Xiaolong shook his head, saying, \u201cThis matter ends here . \u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right Senior Brother, since Young Master is alright, forget this issue,\u201d Fei Hou persuaded .Haotian stood still, saying nothing; he took a deep breath and finally spoke, \u201cYes, Young Master, Haotian obeys!\u201d Subsequently, his right hand waved to disperse the gathered guards, withdrawing his marshal order .A while later, Huang Xiaolong, Fei Hou, and Haotian were seated in the main hall .\u201cSovereign, you are the Asura\u2019s Gate Sovereign, but here in the Luo Tong Kingdom, you were repeatedly placed in danger\u2013 please punish Subordinate for this sin!\u201d when all three sat down, Haotian suddenly fell to his knees and said those words .Huang Xiaolong quickly held Haotian\u2019s arms, \u201cHaotian, quickly stand up!\u201d\u201cRequest Sovereign to punish Subordinate\u2019s crime!\u201d Marshal Haotian remained kneeling on the floor .Huang Xiaolong sent Fei Hou a helpless look, and Fei Hou followed through saying, \u201cSenior Brother, since Sovereign asked you to stand, then stand up; after all, the fault lies not with you!\u201dMarshal Haotian hesitated for a second before he finally got up: \u201cThank you Sovereign!\u201dAsura\u2019s Gate rules are extremely strict; if it was before, if Huang Xiaolong was injured under his territory\u2019s jurisdiction, his punishment would leave anyone in fear . Although he might keep his life, however, his martial cultivation would be destroyed .Of course, Huang Xiaolong wasn\u2019t hurt in any way .Seeing Haotian stand up, Huang Xiaolong asked, \u201cAny news about Elder Yu Ming?\u201d Huang Xiaolong heard Fei Hou mention that their Master went to Mohe Kingdom\u2019s Royal City, so he requested Marshal Haotian to search for Yu Ming\u2019s news .\u201cReplying Young Master, there is yet any news of Master; but Subordinate fears Master has already left the Mohe Kingdom\u2019s Royal City . \u201d Haotian replied with respect .Huang Xiaolong felt a trace of disappointment, but he had expected this result . Yu Ming went to Mohe Kingdom for some matters so after three years, it is hardly possible for him to be there still .His Master, Ren Wokuang, left something for him in the Asura\u2019s Gate headquarters, and it was something vital to Huang Xiaolog\u2019s Asura Tactics cultivation . So, he wanted to ask Yu Ming where the headquarter\u2019s location was .Even Marshal Haotian doesn\u2019t know its location .A while later, Huang Xiaolong went back to his courtyard from the main hall .When he stepped into the yard, a small figure rushed into his arms .\u201cLittle guy, where did you run off to these \u00a0past few days?\u201d Huang Xiaolong \u00a0chuckled as he inquired, not dodging the figure .Of course, this little figure is the little violet monkey .The past few days Huang Xiaolong didn\u2019t see a glimpse of the little guy anywhere .\u201cZhi zhi zhi!\u201d Perched on Huang Xiaolong\u2019s shoulder, the little violet monkey started to gesture while squeaking .Watching the little monkey, Huang Xiaolong laughed to himself\u2013 probably in this world, only he can tell what it is trying to say . In this Martial Spirit World, beast cultivators needed to break through into the Xiantian realm before they can speak in the human language . Without a doubt, this little monkey has many days ahead of him before it can speak, so it can only gesture to communicate with him .Afterwards, Huang Xiaolong let the little violet monkey play by himself while he walked into the room and took out the cold jade bed and started to practice; since he advanced to the Sixth Order, the speed he absorbed the netherworld\u2019s spiritual aura had increased again .The twin dragon martial spirits behind him had grown a circumference bigger, the Black Dragon\u2019s scales shone and the Blue Dragon\u2019s gleamed a royal blue .Three days soon arrived .During these past\u00a0three days, other than practicing Huang Xiaolong was able to stabilize his new strength . His battle qi laced with the netherworld\u2019s spiritual aura which ran smoothly in his meridians .\u201cFinally, first day of school . \u201d Huang Xiaolong walked out from his room, the morning sunlight warming his body .First day of Academy!Not long after, Huang Xiaolong left the Marshal Mansion with Fei Hou and four guards, heading in the direction of Cosmic Star Academy . Marshal Haotian added two more guards to protect Huang Xiaolong after the previous incident .Soon, the six of them reached the Academy\u2019s gates .Since the Academy had started, Fei Hou and the four guards accompanied Huang Xiaolong until they reached the front gates .Huang Xiaolong passed through the gates alone and after inquiring from the passing teachers and students, he walked towards where his class was .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

No matter how \u2018awesome\u2019, he\u2019s still a waste relying on his family . If not for the recommendation letter, is he qualified to enter Cosmic Star Academy? In my opinion, at the most, his martial spirit is just a grade six!\u201dMost of the new students saw what happened between Huang Xiaolong and Xiong Meiqi on registration day, and the scuffle with Zhong Yuan and the rest .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s brows slowly creased as the gossip entered his ears .\u201cXiaolong, sit beside me!\u201d Li Lu ignored the discussions around her, went up and pulled Huang Xiaolong\u2019s hand to a seat next to hers; Huang Xiaolong shook his head and smiled; however, it\u2019s not nice to refuse Li Lu\u2019s kind intention in public .Huang Xiaolong just sat down, and a young blonde boy, about ten years old, in a pale gold robe came in; this blonde boy was born with delicate features, albeit a little arrogant .\u201cJiang Teng!\u201d\u201cHe is Jiang Teng? From what I\u2019ve heard, on registration day, his martial spirits was determined to be Bright Holy Tiger, a grade eleven superb martial spirits!\u201d\u201cSince our Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s establishment, there has never been a superb talent martial spirit . When this matter reached the Principal and Vice Principal, both of them already said they wanted to take him as their disciple!\u201d\u201cBoth the Principal and the Vice Principal?! This has never happened in Cosmic Star Academy before!\u201dIn the midst of the students\u2019 discussion, the blond boy walked to an empty seat in the middle of the class and sat down .Huang Xiaolong who was on the second row watched the blond boy; this boy\u2019s martial spirits was out of his expectation\u2013 grade eleven martial spirit, Sacred Bright Tiger!As if he felt Huang Xiaolong\u2019s gaze, the blond boy Jiang Teng turned his head, and their eyes collided . And when their eyes met, in the blond boy\u2019s eyes, loathing flashed across them: the same emotion that was in Xiong Meiqi\u2019s eyes when she looked at him on registration day when he gave her his recommendation letter .Then he turned his head back in contempt .Huang Xiaolong noted the other side\u2019s dislike and contempt, while his heart sneered; whatever good impression he had off the other side instantly dropped to the lowest point .While the students were discussing in whispers, suddenly, a cold female teacher entered the classroom and it was Xiong Meiqi!Seeing Xiong Meiqi, Huang Xiaolong was a little startled: don\u2019t tell me this female bear is the class teacher?!Xiong Meiqi entered the room and went up to the platform: \u201cI am your Class Teacher, Xiong Meiqi!\u201d confirming Huang Xiaolong\u2019s guess .After Xiong Meiqi finished saying that, her eyes were like daggers as she glared at Huang Xiaolong for a split second .Huang Xiaolong was calm and indifferent, directly ignoring Xiong Meiqi .Seeing his reaction, Xiong Meiqi laughed coldly and went on to inform the class some of Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s rules and the course content that they will be learning in the coming days and some methods to advance in class .There was only three class years in Cosmic Star Academy: Sixth Order and below in the First Year; a breakthrough from the peak late-Sixth Order to the Seventh Order gives one eligibility for taking the Second Year class\u2019s examination . Those who pass can advance one year\u2013 as for the Third Year, students were required to be a Ninth Order .Anyone who reached twenty-two years old but failed to enter the Second Year class will be expelled from Cosmic Star Academy .Xiong Meiqi said, \u201cTo breakthrough to Seventh Order before twenty-two is hard for some of you, but it is not so for those with grade nine and above martial spirits . After our Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s nurturing; as long you are willing to work hard, in general, most of you can breakthrough Seventh Order before reaching twenty-two years old . As for waste that came in using a recommendation letter, no matter how much the Academy nurtures and guides them, a waste is fated to remain a waste . \u201dAs if intentionally or maybe not, Xiong Meiqi furtively glanced at Huang Xiaolong .Huang Xiaolong frowned .\u201cWastes with recommendation letters at most possess a grade seven, or six martial spirits, maybe even grade five; even if they cultivate till forty years old, sixty years old, they still have no chance of breaking through to the Seventh Order . Thus, they have only one ending \u2013 expulsion from the Academy!\u201d Xiong Meiqi continued, and as if \u2018hate\u2019 wasn\u2019t enough, her eyes stared at Huang Xiaolong with an icy coldness as she spoke .All the new students in the classroom looked at Huang Xiaolong, making him the center of attention .Then, Xiong Meiqi\u2019s voice tone suddenly changed, her cold expression replaced with an amiable smile, saying, \u201cI would like to introduce everyone to our Academy\u2019s most talented genius in more than one hundred years, Student Jiang Teng!\u201d Xiong Meiqi pointed at the blond boy Jiang Teng when she finished the introduction . \u201cStudent Jiang Teng possess a grade eleven martial spirits, Bright Holy Tiger; he\u2019s our Academy\u2019s first student who has a superb talent martial spirit since its establishment . \u201dAt this time, Jiang Teng stood up from his chair and nodded to the surrounding classmates, his head held a little too high .Xiong Meiqi led the class in a thunderous applause .Feeling the envious and admiring gazes on his body, Jiang Teng\u2019s demeanor became even more haughty, but when he caught a glimpse of Huang Xiaolong\u2019s indifference as he sat there, clearly having no intention to join in the applause, Jiang Teng\u2019s smile reduced slightly . The dislike in his eyes increased even more .At this point, Xiong Meiqi abruptly spoke, \u201cLet me tell everyone a fantastic piece of news: our Student Jiang Teng just reached ten years old, but he\u2019s already a Fourth Order warrior! A peak early-Fourth Order!\u201d\u201cTen years old already is a peak early-Fourth Order!\u201d\u201cThis is too scary!\u201dShocked was evident in every new students\u2019 expression and envy and admiration almost shot through the roof as they looked at Jiang Teng .\u201cJiang Teng, Principal and Vice Principal said you had learned battle skills?\u201d Xiong Meiqi smilingly asked Jiang Teng .\u201cIt\u2019s true Teacher!\u201d Jiang Teng answered with a laugh .\u201cCan you demonstrate and let everyone see?\u201d Xiong Meiqi requested .\u201cOkay,\u201d Jiang Teng nodded and walked out proudly to an empty spot in the classroom . He stood still, suddenly a bright light burst out revealing a huge tiger behind him; this huge tiger\u2019s entire shone brightly, breathing out radiant flames . It let out a deafening roar, exuding a superb talent martial spirit\u2019s oppression .Then, Jiang Teng leaped up and bellowed: \u201cTiger Flame Palm!\u201d one after another tiger paw was stamped in midair .While watching, the new students applauded and cheered nonstop .However, Huang Xiaolong shook his head . This Tiger Flame Palm should be a high grade Mysterious rank battle skill and it isn\u2019t bad, but in Jiang Teng\u2019s movements, it was full of weakness .Listening to the applause and cheers, Jiang Teng worked harder and at the end of it, he complacently looked down at his classmates, shouting, \u201cBright Holy Tiger appear, invincible throughout the world!\u201dInvincible throughout?When Huang Xiaolong heard Jiang Teng\u2019s shout, he failed to hold in his laughter and a \u2018puff\u2019 rang out . Huang Xiaolong\u2019s laughter came so abruptly that the whole class was shocked silent . Everyone\u2019s attention zoomed to Huang Xiaolong .Xiong Meiqi lost her smile and stared icily at Huang Xiaolong, screaming, \u201cHuang Xiaolong, stand up!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Nonetheless, he still stood up .Li Lu beside him was full of worry .\u201cWhat were you laughing at?\u201d Xiong Meiqi snapped in anger .A faint smile curved up at the corner of Huang Xiaolong\u2019s lips, \u201cI laughed because it was such a crappy battle skill yet everyone was cheering so much . \u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d anger rose to Xiong Meiqi\u2019s face, \u201cYou, a waste with a recommendation letter, isn\u2019t qualified to judge others\u2019 battle skill . \u201dHuang Xiaolong sneered and retorted, \u201cI have no qualification to judge? Then\u00a0 what right do you have to say I\u2019m a waste, you female bear . \u201dFemale bear?Everyone\u2019s face had an excited expression of anticipation seeing that Huang Xiaolong dared to call Xiong Meiqi a female bear in front of so many people .\u201cYou!\u201d Xiong Meiqi almost flared up with anger pointed at Huang Xiaolong, her voluptuous bosom was heaving up and down, \u201cFine, fine, you won\u2019t admit that you\u2019re a waste . Three days later, there is an assessment test for new students, if you can enter top ten then I will admit that you\u2019re not a useless waste!\u201dTop ten in the assessment test, this condition was a bit too much .Despite that, Huang Xiaolong just laughed, \u201cDo I need your acknowledgment whether I am useless or not? Okay, if I enter one of the top ten spots in the assessment test, I want you to growl three times like a bear, kneeling down in the Academy\u2019s square!\u201dGrowled three times like a bear!A sharp, dangerous glint burst deep within Xiong Meiqi\u2019s eyes, as if she wanted to swallow Huang Xiaolong alive; gritting her teeth, \u201cWhat if you fail to enter one of the top ten places?\u201d\u201cIf I fail, I will voluntarily withdraw from school and also will kneel down in the Academy\u2019s square and bark like a dog three times!\u201d Huang Xiaolong\u2019s cold voice sounded .Xiong Meiqi gloomy face changed indecisively .\u201cHow about it, don\u2019t you dare to?\u201d Huang Xiaolong smirked .\u201cOkay!\u201d Xiong Meiqi bit her lips and agreed, a ruthless light flashed across her eyes and disappeared quickly . She simply refused to believe a waste relying on a family\u2019s background could enter into one of the top ten in the assessment!Seeing that Xiong Meiqi agreed through gritted teeth, he sneered inside and walked in the direction of the classroom door .\u201cStand still, where are you going?\u201d Xiong Meiqi yelled .\u201cDo I have to tell you where I go?\u201d Huang Xiaolong paused when he heard that and stepped out of the classroom, but when he passed beside Jiang Teng, Huang Xiaolong muttered, \u201cA self-righteous idiot!\u201dJiang Teng\u2019s face stiffened, then turned red when he understood the meaning behind Huang Xiaolong\u2019s words . A waste that came in through recommendation actually scolded him, calling him an idiot publicly? A strong light flickered around his body, burning with rage as he looked at Huang Xiaolong\u2019s back .Looking at the receding figure that ignored him, choking with anger that failed to vent .Walking out from the classroom, Huang Xiaolong headed to the library . After all, it made no difference whether he sat in lectures or otherwise; in fact, it was better this way\u2013 he could head to the library to find out the information that he wanted .The library was far from Huang Xiaolong\u2019s classroom; entering the library, Huang Xiaolong took out his student plate for verification . After passing the check, he looked for the shelf containing books about martial spirits, randomly picking up a book titled \u2018Types of Martial Spirits\u2019 and started to read .This book basically described the different types of martial spirits and some of their innate supernatural abilities .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s memory had always been excellent, flipping past the pages speedily and moments later, he had finished reading and gained some understanding to this world\u2019s martial spirits .After \u2018Types of\u00a0 Martial Spirits\u2019, Huang Xiaolong took a book called \u2018The Different Martial Spirits Grades\u2019 that evaluated the distinction between the grades of martial spirits and its progress .\u201cAh, twin martial spirits!\u201d when he reached the last page there were some notations about twin martial spirits that Huang Xiaolong read carefully .\u201cTwin martial spirits of the same kind can combine to become one or they could be separated as two individual entities!\u201d This paragraph astonished Huang Xiaolong .Twin martial spirits can become one?!No wonder in the early days when his martial spirits had just awakened, it existed in a combined state! When he broke through to the Fourth Order,\u00a0 the twin dragon martial spirits separated into two independent entities .Huang Xiaolong read the passage below and his eyes lit up; it actually described the method to combine and separate twin martial spirits of the same kind .Moments later, Huang Xiaolong finished the book feeling elated, great! With this method, he could combine his martial spirits before releasing them in the future, so that no one can guess his secret .He re-read the paragraph explaining the method, committing them into his brain and then moved towards the shelves placed with books ab about Beasts text .Following the Beast language on the map he had gotten from the Silvermoon Forest, he checks them one by one . A while later, he deciphered the text written on the Beast Cultivator\u2019s treasure map .\u201cDemon Beast Holy Land, Thousand Tusker Mountain, Windless Tunnel!\u201dHuang Xiaolong frowned .The location of the treasure was actually in the Beast race Holy Land?!In this world, the Demon Beast race was bigger and more powerful than the normal Beastmen, and they abhorred humans; wanting to enter their Holy Land, this was too difficult! At least it was impossible for the current Huang Xiaolong .After he had finished translating the words, it was already high noon . Huang Xiaolong left the library, and he exited the Academy instead of returning to the classroom . When he came out from the Academy, Fei Hou and the three guards immediately saw him and hurried up to him, \u201cYoung Master!\u201dHuang Xiaolong nodded, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go . \u201d he brought the four of them to Tianxuan Mansion .On the way, Fei Hou couldn\u2019t resist, so he asked, \u201cYoung Master, the Academy hasn\u2019t ended, how come you\u2019re already out?\u201dThe other four guards also looked at Huang Xiaolong with curiosity, having the same doubt in their hearts .Huang Xiaolong explained, \u201cFrom registration day, that female bear is my class teacher . \u201d\u201cWhat?! The female bear is Young Master\u2019s class teacher?!\u201d Fei Hou was stupefied, then his voice turned sullen, asking, \u201cYoung Master, did she make things difficult for you today in the class?\u201dHuang Xiaolong chuckled, \u201cSome ridicule is unavoidable . \u201d Then, Huang Xiaolong summarized what happened and his bet with Xiong Mei in the new students\u2019 assessment three days later .When Fei Hou heard it couldn\u2019t resist laughing out loud\u2013 he already could imagine three days later, Xiong Meiqi kneeling on the square and growling like a bear .Soon, the six of them arrived in Tianxuan Mansion . Beastman Boli and the rest of the slaves saw Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou so they quickly walked up to salute; telling them to stand up, Huang Xiaolong went to the main hall and asked Boli about Tianxuan Mansion\u2019s matters .Beastman Boli answered them with respect .In the last few days, the necessary furniture was arranged accordingly and the open yard was planted with flowers and plants; Beastman Boli even arranged for the old and moldy walls to be scrapped and painted with a new layer of paint .Huang Xiaolong nodded, \u201cYou did well, you can leave . \u201dAcknowledging respectfully, Beastman Boli turned and brought the servants with him out of the main hall .After that, Huang Xiaolong left Tianxuan Mansion and returned to the Marshal Mansion . Then, he suddenly asked, \u201cFei Hou, do you want to breakthrough to the Xiantian realm?\u201d\u201cBreakthrough to the Xiantian?\u201d Fei Hou was stunned, stammering, \u201cSov- Sovereign, you have a way?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead, now Sovereign actually said that he could let him breakthrough to the Xiantian realm in merely five years!After Fei Hou had regained his sense, excitement was written all over his face . He had been following Sovereign for so long, he knew Sovereign would only say something he was confident in and he definitely wouldn\u2019t lie to him!\u201cCome, sit down,\u201d Huang Xiaolong said, \u201cI\u2019ll teach you a cultivation technique . \u201d\u201cCultivation technique?!\u201d Fei Hou was surprised for a moment and proceeded to sit down .Then, Huang Xiaolong taught Fei Hou an internal force cultivation technique called \u2018Liquid Thunder Arts\u2019 . Although the Liquid Thunder Arts weren\u2019t as good as the Body Metamorphose Scripture, but once it reached major completion it would be very powerful, comparable to this world\u2019s Heaven rank cultivation technique .Fei Hou\u2019s martial spirits was the Silver River and his own cultivation technique coupled with \u2018Liquid Thunder Arts\u2019 will speed up his cultivation speed tremendously; to step into Xiantian realm in five years time was no problem .\u201cSubordinate bow down for Sovereign\u2019s grace!\u201d After memorizing the \u2018Liquid Thunder Arts\u2019 Fei Hou knelt down in gratitude, vowing \u201cSubordinate will always follow Sovereign!\u201dHuang Xiaolong waved his hand and helped Fei Hou up . He trusts Fei Hou\u2019s loyalty, otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have taught Fei Hou \u2018Liquid Thunder Arts . \u201d\u201cWhen you return to the Marshal Mansion, tell Haotian to come over . I will also teach him a cultivation technique . \u201d\u201cThis Subordinate thanks Sovereign on behalf of Senior Brother!\u201d Delight showed on Fei Hou\u2019s face, and he knelt down to thank Huang Xiaolong again .Telling Fei Hou to stand, he explained some of the technique\u2019s profoundness until Fei Hou started to grasp them . He then told Fei Hou about his plans to buy more slaves and train them to build his own power .\u201cSovereign, please rest assure, Fei Hou will handle this task . \u201d Fei Hou said with confidence .Huang Xiaolong nodded and allowed Fei Hou to leave .After Fei Hou had left, Huang Xiaolong went to the yard to practice Tears of Asura for a while, then he continued with the skills he knew from his previous life: Ethereal Palm, Execute Demon Sword, Luohan Fist, etc .And as for the Academy\u2019s afternoon class session, Huang Xiaolong didn\u2019t bother to attend .The fact was, he enrolled into Cosmic Star Academy because the Dragon Flame Valley could temper his body and enhance his battle qi; and the allure of the prizes from the class competition, year competition and the Academy overall competition\u2019s rewards \u2013 the Grade Four, and Five Spirit Dans! And of course, the representative spot to participate in Duanren Empire\u2019s Imperial City Battle!Attending classes to him was equivalent to wasting time; he just needs to show up and participate in the class and year competitions .Afternoon\u2013 it angered Xiong Meiqi even more when she noticed Huang Xiaolong was absent for afternoon class after he ignored her and left the classroom in the morning .\u201cThat waste; three days later I will see how you bark like a dog in the square!\u201d Xiong Meiqi laughed when she thought of this scene, but when she remembered Huang Xiaolong giving her the \u2018female bear\u2019 nickname her anger returned . Now, the nickname \u2018female bear\u2019 had spread around the Academy .In the Tianxuan Mansion, when Huang Xiaolong was done with his training, Fei Hou arrived with Marshal Haotian; clearly, Fei Hou already told Haotian that Huang Xiaolong was going to teach him a cultivation technique because he looked excited when Huang Xiaolong saw him .And Huang Xiaolong taught Marshal Haotian a cultivation technique called \u2018Five Yang Tactic\u2019 . Marshal Haotian used thirty years to break through from Xiantian First Order to Xiantian Second Order; with this, he could at least shorten the time by half to reach the Third Order .Although a dozen years seemed very long, to breakthrough from Xiantian Second Order to Third Order in that much time was quite an amazing result; some people who have grade eleven martial spirits would need just as much time, if not more to advance to Xiantian Third Order .It could be said, for Marshal Haotian who possessed a grade ten martial spirits, practicing the \u2018Five Yang Tactic\u2019 would speed up Martial Haotian\u2019s cultivation, bringing a similar result as if he possessed a grade eleven martial spirits .Even though cultivating \u2018Five Yang Tactic\u2019 can speed up Martial Haotian\u2019s cultivation speed, it cannot change or improve his martial spirit\u2019s natural limitation . The chances for a top grade ten martial spirits to advance into Saint realm was slim .Even so, Marshal Haotian was still grateful to Huang Xiaolong that tears and snot started to flow .\u201cSovereign, rest assured that Haotian would live up to your expectation . I will work hard to cultivate and breakthrough to Third Order!\u201d after committing the \u2018Five Yang Tactic\u2019 to memory, Marshal Haotian kowtowed in gratitude .Huang Xiaolong nodded and helped Marshal Haotian up .A while later, Marshal Haotian left Tianxuan Mansion and Huang Xiaolong requested him to send someone to bring the little violet monkey over to the new mansion .Huang Xiaolong returned to his room and took out the cold jade bed after the Marshal left and called out the twin dragons, but it wasn\u2019t for practice . He followed the method he read today in the library and ran his battle qi slowly, trying to fuse the twin dragons like it first appeared .As Huang Xiaolong ran his battle qi, one black and one blue dragon\u2019s body slowly coiled together as black and blue light flickered, fusing, and suddenly a glaring light glowed and the fusing was completed successfully into a double-headed dragon instead of a serpent .When the twin dragon fused into one body, the oppressive aura belonging to a dragon increased\u2013 even its body mass became bigger .\u201cBut, the netherworld spiritual aura absorbing speed slowed a little in this state . \u201d Huang Xiaolong noticed this difference .After the successful fusion, Huang Xiaolong practiced the Asura Tactics and continued with the Body Metamorphose Scripture; he had a feeling very soon his meridians could reach the Fourth Stage of Converting Power of the Stars and he could enter the true Fifth Stage .Once the Fourth Stage meridians opened, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s internal force would increase a lot and at that time, even without battle qi, by solely relying on internal force, he could eliminate warriors of the Sixth Order and below .Time flowed and passed and three days came and went .These past three days, Huang Xiaolong stayed and practiced in Tianxuan Mansion and didn\u2019t attend any classes, causing Xiong Meiqi to grit her teeth in fury, but it was balanced out when thinking of the impossibility of a new waste student achieving a spot in the top ten in the assessment .On this day, Huang Xiaolong came out from his room and stretched his limbs .\u201cToday\u2019s the new students\u2019 assessment!\u201d Looking at the bright sky above, he really was looking forward to it .Walking out from the yard, Fei Hou had been waiting respectfully for quite some time .\u201cLet\u2019s go, we\u2019re heading to the Academy!\u201d Huang Xiaolong exclaimed .\u201cYes, Sovereign!\u201dWhen Huang Xiaolong arrived at the Academy, Xiong Meiqi and the batch of new students were already assembled in the square and with Huang Xiaolong\u2019s arrival, everyone\u2019s eyes \u2018shua shua shua\u2019 towards him .~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Afterward, when I enter the top ten in the assessment, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll go back on your words!\u201dA sharp light flashed across Xiong Meiqi\u2019s pupils: \u201cI, Xiong Meiqi never go back on my word!\u201dHuang Xiaolong walked into the crowd and stood still . And at this time, the blond boy Jiang Teng stared at Huang Xiaolong viciously with dislike, then turned away . Huang Xiaolong\u2019s face remained stoic .And at this point, Li Lu came beside Huang Xiaolong, full of worry and said, \u201cXiaolong, can you really enter the top ten?\u201dOn that year when Huang Xiaolong revealed his early-Fourth Order strength to defeat Huang Wei during the Huang Clan Manor\u2019s Annual Assembly, Li Lu doesn\u2019t know about it .\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Huang Xiaolong gave Li Lu a comforting look, telling her not to worry .A while later, seeing everyone had arrived Xiong Meiqi started to explain the new student assessment\u2019s rules and criteria .To test a new student\u2019s strength, letting them battle was the best way to do it . Thus, the new students\u2019 assessment was to let them battle against each other; each batch was divided into five groups and the opponent was selected by drawing sticks . The winner of a group enters the next round of battle, finally determining the top ten students .And the battle competition location was the Academy\u2019s square .Because it was the new students' assessment day, there was a lot of older students watching, from ex-First Year students, Second Years, and Third Years .However, just as Xiong Meiqi finished her explanation of the assessment process, a voice sounded, \u201cTeacher Xiong, this is too troublesome; how about this, I will accept all the students\u2019 challenge, the longer a student can last under my attack the higher his or her placement!\u201dEveryone was surprised and looked over where the voice came from and saw the one who spoke was Jiang Teng!As Jiang Teng\u2019s word resounded through the square, it caused a commotion among the observing older students .\u201cThis kid is the one who was said to possess superb martial spirits, the Sacred Bright Tiger, Jiang Teng?! Really crazy! Actually plan to take on all the new students\u2019 challenge by himself!\u201d\u201cPeople are arrogant because they have the strength!\u201dLow-voiced discussions sounded between the older students .And Xiong Meiqi was stunned .Jiang Teng alone wanted to take on all the new students\u2019 challenge?There were almost one hundred people in this batch of new students .At one corner of the square, stood two tall old men, and one of them was Cosmic Star Academy Vice-Principal, Xiong Chu, whereas the other old fellow has a pair of big eyes . Especially his ears, nearly twice as big as a normal person\u2019s ear, etching him into their memory with just one glance .\u201cPrincipal, Jiang Teng is still young, a little too vigorous . \u201d Xiong Chu said to the old fellow, \u201cAlthough he is strong, but there are almost a hundred new students\u2013 how can he accept all of their challenges?\u201dThe other old fellow was Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s Principal, Sun Zhang .Sun Zhang wasn\u2019t frazzled in the least, \u201cNo harm, all are children; full of youth\u2019s vigor is very normal . Not to mention, Jiang Teng has a superb martial spirits; even though the new students are quite numerous, don\u2019t look down on the Sacred Bright Tiger\u2019s ability!\u201dSun Zhang\u2019s underlying meaning was, Jiang Teng\u2019s current capability could easily deal with this batch of new student\u2019s challenges!Xiong Chu couldn\u2019t help but feel surprised .\u201cYou will understand in a while,\u201d Sun Zhang smiled and said to Xiong Chu .While Xiong Meiqi was considering if she should agree with Jiang Teng\u2019s suggestion, her father, Xiong Chu\u2019s voice transmitted into her ear .Everyone was looking at Xiong Meiqi, waiting for her decision .Moments later, Xiong Meiqi looked at the group of new students, and then nodded at Jiang Teng, \u201cOkay . \u201dOkay!When Xiong Meiqi gave her approval, the surrounding crowd grew noisier .Xiong Meiqi actually allowed Jiang Teng to accept about one hundred new students\u2019 challenge!Xiong Meiqi walked up and waved both of her hands setting a ten-meter wide circle on the square as the ring; the battle competition area will be within the ring, and the person who stepped out is considered the loser .Jiang Teng was the first one to leap into the ring and stood in the middle with his hands behind his back . With a condescending demeanor said, \u201cWho dares to come in?\u201dWhen his voice dropped, all around the square was silence .\u201cMe!\u201d At this moment, a fat young man leaped into the circle . Without waiting, a bright light burst exploded from his body, his martial spirits floating above his head behind him . This young man\u2019s martial spirits looked like a pudgy Sandyfern beast, and on top of its head was two soft horn looking extremely cute .Many of the new students laughed out seeing it .Huang Xiaolong shook his head, this fella\u2019s martial spirit indeed looked a little funny . However, Huang Xiaolong who went to the library a few days ago recognized this chubby young man\u2019s martial spirits was a top grade ten martial spirits called Earth Dragon . It doesn\u2019t belong to the dragon race\u2013 it was a mixed line of descendant having a trace of the dragon race\u2019s bloodline, similar to an Asian dragon .The fatty released his martial spirits and rushed up to Jiang Teng, his fist punched out, the power emitted was quite strong .Huang Xiaolong could tell, this young man already reached mid-Third Order .However, even though he was a mid-Third Order warrior, against a Fourth Order Jiang Teng, he was significantly weak . Jiang Teng watched as the fist neared him, lifted his left hand as battle qi surged and punched out meeting the fat young man\u2019s fist .\u201cBang!\u201d A low blast sounded, and the fat young man bounced back from the impact . Fats on his body vibrated as he staggered till the edge of the ring .Jiang Teng stood on the same spot; his palm shot out across the air, and the fat young man was pushed out from the circle .The fat young man possessing grade ten martial spirits, a mid-Third Order, lost!From the beginning till the end, only three breath\u2019s time had passed .Gaps of shocked echoed through the crowd seeing this scene .After that, it was a consecutive six losses as new students went up to challenge Jiang Teng one by one; the one who lasted the longest was six breaths\u2019 count, and the shortest one was out within a single breath\u2019s time .After Jiang Teng defeated the seventh person, suddenly Jiang Teng\u2019s body from head to toe showered in a sacred brightness, glimmering . When it was gone, the tired Jiang Teng once again was full of energy, looking refreshed .\u201cThis, this is battle qi recovery?!\u201d Some of the older students exclaimed out loud seeing it .Battle qi recovery!When Jiang Teng advanced into the Fourth Order Warrior, the Sacred Bright Tiger evolved, and its innate ability was battle qi recovery; isn\u2019t this martial spirit\u2019s ability a little too powerful?!Some distance away, even Xiong Chu was a little astonished when he saw this, and he finally understood why Principal Su Zhang said Jiang Teng could easily defeat all the new students . Every time he defeats a person, as long as he could gain a fraction of time, he could recover all his exhausted battle qi . Even if there are a couple more students, it posed no problem to Jiang Teng!Xiong Chu\u2019s eyes lit up .Even Principal Sun Zhang was watching with a satisfied look on his face as he looked at Jiang Teng, laughingly said, \u201cOur Academy has been established over a hundred years, and have never any of the disciples entered the first one hundred places in Duanren Empire\u2019s Battle of the Imperial City . Now, Jiang Teng\u2019s appearance gave us hope . After our careful guidance, twenty years later, Jiang Teng definitely could enter the top thirty spots in the Battle of the Imperial City!\u201dXiong Chu broke out in a cackle, \u201cTwenty years later if Jiang Teng could enter the top thirty in Duanren Empire, it is our Academy\u2019s glory ah . At that time, we would be rewarded greatly by Duanren Empire\u2019s Emperor!\u201dSun Zhang nodded, smiling from ear to ear .At this time, Huang Xiaolong was standing among the new students, looking at the defeated students one after another and the high-spirited Jiang Teng, but he was in no hurry to step into the ring .When Jiang Teng defeated the seventh person, Li Lu who was beside Huang Xiaolong suddenly leaped up, landing in the ring .Seeing Li Lu coming up to challenge him, a cold sneer appeared on his face; he knew this woman was close to the waste that registered with a recommendation letter, Huang Xiaolong .His eyes peeked at Huang Xiaolong, and when he turned to look at Li Lu, a cruel light flashed across them .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 56Chapter 56: Four Breaths?Jiang Teng looked at Li Lu and his cold voice sounded, \u201cPardon me, but I\u2019ve always hated wastes that rely on familial ties! And the people that associate with these wastes! In this battle, I will not hold back, and if you want to blame someone, blame it on that waste!\u201d After he finished saying that, he abruptly pointed his finger at Huang Xiaolong .Jiang Teng\u2019s words rang clearly in the square, causing everyone to shift their focus to Huang Xiaolong . The students standing close to him quickly moved away, putting some distance between them and him so that Jiang Teng wouldn\u2019t misunderstand . Otherwise, it might cause fish of the same pond to suffer the same fate .Seeing this, Jiang Teng was very satisfied . Without warning, he turned around and attacked Li Lu .\u201cTiger Flame Palm!\u201dA Sacred Bright Tiger\u2019s paw print hit Li Lu\u2019s chest in a split second . A Fourth Order Warrior\u2019s battle qi went out full-scale; the current Jiang Teng was vastly different from before and his strength had more than doubled .All around, the crowd was very surprised . They were shocked at Jiang Teng\u2019s power and at the same time, they were shocked that Jiang Teng would attack using his high-grade Mysterious rank battle skill against Li Lu, the Tiger Flame Palm .In his earlier battles, Jiang Teng had defeated his previous opponents without using the battle skill, but now against Li Lu, he displayed it\u2013 he clearly wanted to show his hatred towards Huang Xiaolong .Everyone shook their head and looked at Li Lu in pity; the heavy injury resulting from this strike would render Li Lu bedridden for two to three months .Because of a waste, she implicated herself and suffering such injury was really her bad luck!Xiong Meiqi frowned on seeing the palm strike aimed at Li Lu\u2019s chest, but she kept quiet and didn\u2019t try to stop the battle .Alarm and panic flashed registered in Li Lu\u2019s eyes . However, with her recently advanced Third Order Warrior strength, she didn\u2019t have enough strength to defend against Jiang Teng\u2019s high-grade battle skill attack .Just when everyone thought Li Lu would be seriously injured, and sent flying out of the ring, a silhouette suddenly flashed and grabbed Li Lu . With Li Lu protected within an embrace, two figures swirled to one side, escaping Jiang Teng\u2019s attack .Beyond all expectation, Jiang Teng\u2019s attack landed on empty air, leaving everyone surprised . Gazes shifted and saw that the person who grabbed Li Lu and dodged the attack was the person who according to Jiang Teng\u2019s words, was a waste; Huang Xiaolong .Xiong Meiqi included, felt shock .Huang Xiaolong ignored the shocked gazes, peered at Li Lu in his arms, asked, \u201cAre you okay?\u201dThe frightened Li Lu gradually calmed down, and two lovely dimples appeared, \u201cXiaolong, I\u2019m okay!\u201d\u201cOk, step back and let me handle this . \u201d \u00a0said Huang Xiaolong .\u201cXiaolong, you?!\u201d Li Lu was worried .\u201cIt\u2019s nothing . \u201d Huang Xiaolong waved his hand and gently sent Li Lu out of the ring . He then turned around to face Jiang Teng .And at this time, in a distant square corner, Sun Zhang stared at Huang Xiaolong who managed to rescue Li Lu from Jiang Teng\u2019s attack . \u00a0Stunned, he couldn\u2019t resist asking, \u201cWho is this new student?\u201d Being able to save Li Lu from Jiang Teng\u2019s attack proved that this new student wasn\u2019t weak .Xiong Chu was dumbfounded . \u00a0The Principal doesn\u2019t recognize this punk?\u201cPrincipal, this child registered with your recommendation letter . \u201d replied Xiong Chu not thinking much of it .\u201cWhat?! Him?\u201d Principal Sun Zhang was taken aback .Seeing the Principal\u2019s surprised expression, he couldn\u2019t help but feel it was strange . Understanding Xiong Chu\u2019s doubts, he pondered for a moment before explaining, \u201cI gave that recommendation letter, to Marshal Haotian!\u201d\u201cMar . . . , Marshal Haotian!\u201d Xiong Chu was dazed for a moment before he exclaimed out loud .It was actually Marshal Haotian! Who has been in command of hundreds of brigades for the past two kings! The same Marshal Haotian that was below the king and controlled thousands of soldiers!A film of sweat emerged on Xiong Chu\u2019s forehead . Luckily, he did not revoke Huang Xiaolong\u2019s registration qualification and didn\u2019t make the mistake of killing the three guards, or else!As his thought reached this point, his back felt cold and goosebumps rose on his skin .Cosmic Star Academy was the kingdom\u2019s first academy and in the entire kingdom, the Academy was only wary of two people: Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s King and Marshal Haotian!If he knew that one of the three who Zhong Yuan suggested he kill was Marshal Haotian\u2019s Junior Brother, his back would become even colder still .\u201cAre you okay?\u201d asked Su Zhang, noticing the abrupt drops of sweat on Xiong Chu as he kept wiping them off .\u201cPrincipal, I\u2019m okay . Nothing's wrong, everything's fine!\u201d Xiong Chu exclaimed in panic .Sun Zhang didn\u2019t pursue it, and once again focused his attention on Jiang Teng and Huang Xiaolong in the ring some distance away and said, \u201cHaotian, that old fellow, actually recommended this little child\u2013 it looks like their relationship isn\u2019t a simple one . Could this child be his illegitimate son?\u201dAlthough Marshal Haotian was over a hundred years old, age doesn\u2019t affect a Xiantian realm warrior\u2019s reproductive abilities . Some three, four hundred years old Xiantian realm warriors had children and it was considered normal . Thus, Sun Zhang couldn\u2019t be blamed for having such thoughts .However, if Marshal Haotian knew that Sun Zhang thought Huang Xiaolong was his illegitimate son, no one dared guess what would Marshal Haotian reaction be!\u201cIn your opinion, how long can that child last under Jiang Teng\u2019s attack?\u201d asked Sun Zhang changing the topic .Xiong Chu hesitated for a moment then said, \u201cProbably three breaths . \u201d Up till now, there has only been one person who lasted four breaths\u2019 of time and it was already not bad if Huang Xiaolong could last for three . Xiong Chu could see Huang Xiaolong wasn\u2019t weak and stated his judgment .Hearing his answer, Sun Zhang shook his head .Seeing Sun Zhang was shaking his head; he misunderstood his intent and he ventured, \u201cDoes Principal means to say that Huang Xiaolong can only last for two breath\u2019s of time?\u201d\u201cNo, he should last for four breaths!\u201d Sun Zhang clarified .\u201cWhat? Four breaths?\u201d Xiong Chu found it a little hard to believe\u2013 he felt saying Huang Xiaolong could last three breaths was good enough, but Principal actually said four breaths!If Huang Xiaolong could actually last that long, not only would he not be a waste, he could enter the top twenty ranking amongst the new students .Nobody heard Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu\u2019s conversation, while they conversed, on the stage, Jiang Teng stared at Huang Xiaolong, his tone was cold as he said \u00a0\u201cYou finally came out . I thought you didn\u2019t dare to come out from your hiding . If that was the case, not only are you a waste but a useless cowardly waste!\u201dHuang Xiaolong sneered and replied \u201cIn this world, there truly are many self-righteous idiots!\u201d While he spoke, he remembered what Jiang Teng said (a few days ago ) when he was demonstrating his battle skill, the Tiger Flame Palm, so Huang Xiaolong mocked, \u201cSacred Bright Tiger appears, invincible throughout?\u201dJiang Teng\u2019s face became ugly as it twisted . Sacred battle qi burst out from his entire body and his martial spirit, Sacred Bright Tiger, appeared and let out and a furious roar at the sky . The sky seemed to dim and dark clouds rolled .A tiger\u2019s fury changed the weather!Jiang Teng no longer held back his strength and his aura continued to increase\u2013 much more terrifying degree as compared to when he was fighting against Li Lu .\u201cNow, I will let you find out the huge gap between me, the Academy\u2019s once in a hundred years genius, possessing a superb talent martial spirit and you, a waste coming in through a recommendation letter!\u201d Jiang Teng smirked coldly . \u00a0A cold golden light flashed across his pupils as he leaped out and landed in front of Huang Xiaolong . Fast! Only a few people among the older students could follow his actions .The surrounding students were shocked\u2013 they didn\u2019t expect that Jiang Teng at full power was so strong, not weaker than some ex-First Year students .~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u201cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A brutal light shone in his eyes, suddenly a palm struck out aimed at Huang Xiaolong\u2019s chest .Huang Xiaolong watched Jiang Teng\u2019s palm coming at his chest . Suddenly, a strong battle qi aura broke out from Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body; like a broken dam, like a thousand-year-old volcano eruption . It happened so suddenly, and was so shocking, that before anyone could react Huang Xiaolong had punched out . The light from his fist soared sky high and in the blink of an eye struck Jiang Teng\u2019s torso!\u201cBoom!\u201dThere was an explosion, Jiang Teng screamed in pain as his little body reeled back . With every step he took, blood spurted out from his mouth until he finally stopped more than ten steps later .The sacred light that shrouded his body early dispersed from the impact; the Sacred Bright Tiger behind him dimmed, a tiger\u2019s mightiness vanished turning into a sick cat .All present were stunned!The square was silent as if time froze, unmoving .Whether it was the First Year\u2019s new students or the older students, everyone had temporarily lost their minds after seeing what had just transpired . Apart from a blank whiteness in their mind, there was only white blankness .Possessing superb talent martial spirit, Sacred Bright Tiger, the Fourth Order Warrior, Jiang Teng, Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s most talented genius in over a hundred years, lost!One punch!\u201cImpossible, this cannot be! Didn\u2019t he register with a recommendation letter? How could he defeat Jiang Teng?\u201d Xiong Meiqi was rooted to the spot, as she shook her head in denial, refusing to believe what she had just witnessed .In the far corner, the words \u2018four breaths\u2019 had just come out from Su Zhang, and stunned, he turned towards Xiong Chu whose mouth had formed an \u2018o\u2019, his jaw, nearly dropping .\u201cFour . . . , peak late-Fourth Order!\u201d Xiong Chu\u2019s tongue was in a knot .The punch Huang Xiaolong sent out just now contained a peak late-Fourth Order battle qi .Jiang Teng wiped off the blood from his mouth with the back of his hand and saw the unsightly blood patches on his robes, \u201cMy . . . this is my blood?\u201d Like the others around the ring, he couldn\u2019t believe that he was hurt!Hearing that, Huang Xiaolong sneered coldly, \u201cIf the Blood flowing from your mouth isn\u2019t yours, is it mine?\u201d As his question ended, Huang Xiaolong walked towards Jiang Teng without any sense of hurry .\u201cYou?!\u201d Jiang Teng actually showed fear as he watched the approaching Huang Xiaolong and involuntarily inched back . The previous pride and arrogance had disappeared completely to be replaced with un-surmounted fear . That\u2019s right, fear!\u201cPeak late-Fourth Order! The peak late-Fourth Order, how can this wastrel be a peak late-Fourth Order Warrior!\u201d He muttered to himself, repeating it over and over again . Even at this point in time, the situation hadn\u2019t hit him yet; his mind was set to assume that all those who enrolled into the Academy with a recommendation letter were useless wastes!Waste? Catching the words Jiang Teng was muttering, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s silhouette flashed . A palm struck out, startling Jiang Teng, by the time he tried to raise his hands to block it, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s palm already hit his chest .\u201cPa!\u201d Mixed into the sound of the loud attack was the sound of breaking bones . Hit by Huang Xiaolong\u2019s palm, Jiang Teng felt as if all of his internal organs were shattered; a terrible energy was drilling around in his body, constantly biting and tearing his insides apart .Sadly, just as a painful groan was about to escape his mouth, Huang Xiaolong struck out with a second palm and then a third one \u2026 fifth palm . In just a short time, Huang Xiaolong had hit Jiang Teng more than a dozen times; one after another sound of \u2018pipipala\u2019 rang out as bones broke! Huang Xiaolong made sure that his strikes didn\u2019t send Jiang Teng out of the ring area even after more than ten strikes, but by then Jiang Teng\u2019s chest had already caved in and Jiang Teng bent over in pain like a cooked lobster .The horrible energy from Huang Xiaolong\u2019s palm kept tearing his insides; under the pain, tears finally flowed from Jiang Teng\u2019s eyes!The rare, super genius, the one that\u2019s hard to find even one in a hundred years, daring to challenge all new students and defeating seven people straight was now beaten till he cried by Huang Xiaolong!Everyone looked at the bent and crying Jiang Teng, yet no one had any thoughts for hi . Throats were swallowing nervously all around .This was not some battle assessment, it simply was an appalling wallop!Some of the new students turned their heads away\u2013 they couldn\u2019t bear to look anymore .\u201cI, I,\u201d Jiang Teng struggled up, exerting all his energy trying to cry out and \u00a0admit his loss, but before the sentence could be said, Huang Xiaolong sent another palm strike cutting off his words .\u201cEnough, stop! I said stop!\u201d At this time, the stunned Xiong Meiqi finally regained her wits and cried out in anger; then, her palm struck out, separating Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Teng from each other .Being separated, Jiang Teng tumbled down instantly, his body twitching on the ground with blood streaming down from the corner of his mouth .\u201cJiang Teng! Jiang Teng!\u2019 Xiong Meiqi propped Jiang Teng up quickly in a panic .Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu in the distant corner saw Jiang Teng tumbling down and they were awakened from their daze with the shouting and screaming: this was not good!The two figures flashed and appeared before the new students .\u201cPrincipal, Vice-Principal!\u201dRecognizing Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu, all the students quickly greeted them . Even Xiong Meiqi was surprised .Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu\u2019s minds weren\u2019t on the surroundings; immediately squatting down, one hand fell on the left side and another hand fell one on the right, checking Jiang Teng\u2019s pulse, and transferring battle qi into his body .Xiong Meiqi and the students held their breath, watching nervously .This is Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s Principal, Sun Zhang?\u00a0Huang Xiaolong observed the pair of larger than average ears . He heard from Marshal Haotian before that Sun Zhang\u2019s ears weren\u2019t born this way, but it became like this due to him cultivating an Earth level battle skill .At this time, Li Lu who watched Huang Xiaolong \u2018flatten\u2019 Jiang Teng into a pancake with the crowd realized something and went to Huang Xiaolong\u2019s side and asked in a worried voice, \u201cXiaolong, will they\u2026?\u201dJiang Teng was Principal\u2019s and Vice-Principal\u2019s pro-disciple, and Huang Xiaolong beat him into this state . What if both of them expelled Huang Xiaolong in anger, then\u2026?Huang Xiaolong, however, looked indifferent and comforted Li Lu, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing . \u201dA while later, Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu stopped transferring battle qi into Jiang Teng\u2019s body and retrieved their hands; looking at each other, they both could feel the other\u2019s shock .Just now, when they were transferring battle qi into Jiang Teng\u2019s body to heal him, they found an extremely hostile battle qi within and the quality and thickness had almost reached their state of cultivation .And this high quality battle qi was left by Huang Xiaolong\u2019s palm .Exchanging a knowing look unnoticeable by others, this matter was kept between them two . What made them felt relieved was that Jiang Teng wasn\u2019t wasted and could still cultivate! Otherwise, they would\u2019ve felt like crying .Both of them turned to look at Huang Xiaolong standing five to six meters away as if they were looking at a peerless treasure .Peak late-Fourth Order! Huang Xiaolong was more or less about the same age as Jiang Teng; not even ten years old but he already reached the peak late-Fourth order! What kind of heaven-defying talent was this!If Jiang Teng\u2019s martial spirits was the grade eleven Sacred Bright Tiger, then what was Huang Xiaolong\u2019s? The two authority figures were trembling with excitement\u2013 could it be a\u00a0top grade eleven martial spirit?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Once the idea of Huang Xiaolong possessing a top grade eleven martial spirit became apparent, Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu\u2019s eyes grew dazzlingly bright . That kind of gaze made Huang Xiaolong feel like a sheep in a group of hungry tigers!Of course, the thought of Huang Xiaolong possessing a grade twelve martial spirit crossed their minds; however, such a grade was really too rare . In all of the Duanren Empire\u2019s territory, the number of people who possessed grade twelve martial spirits did not exceed ten people .However,\u00a0in the eyes of the watching students, Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu were standing there and glaring fiercely at Huang Xiaolong and this made many people feel schadenfreude .While the new students were feeling schadenfreude, and the older students were enjoying Huang Xiaolong\u2019s bad luck, Sun Zhang\u2019s face suddenly became wreathed in smiles looking at Huang Xiaolong, he asked, \u201cYou are Huang Xiaolong right? I\u2019m Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s Principal, Sun Zhang . \u201d That tone of voice was so gentle, it was as if he was afraid that if his voice was a little too loud, it would scare away Huang Xiaolong .All around, people wore an expression of shock and then they went into a daze looking at their Principal\u2019s smile, which was the most brilliant smile that they had ever seen (from him) in history .And at this point, Xiong Chu laughed out \u2018haha\u2019, saying, \u201cI\u2019m the Vice-Principal, Xiong Chu; we\u2019ve met a few days ago, hello!\u201dHello?!Vice-Principal Xiong Chu that always had a sullen and strict face, yet he actually said hello to a new student?!Everyone looked like they had been struck by lightning .Subsequently, Sun Zhang laughed and said, \u201cXiaolong ah, your attacks just now are really ruthless ah . If we were one step too late, I\u2019m afraid Jiang Teng would\u2019ve been destroyed . \u201dXiaolong? Moments ago, he was still Huang Xiaolong and now he was directly called Xiaolong! Those who heard this felt like fainting; although Sun Zhang said those words, but the tone was so polite, not even an ounce of blame .Suddenly, ten or so figures flew over, and the frontmost was the Third Year\u2019s teacher, Zhong Yuan .In the blink of an eye, Zhong Yuan\u2019s group of people arrived and seeing that Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu were present, walked over to greet them .\u201cPrincipal, Vice-Principal, it\u2019s great that both of you are here . I received a report saying Huang Xiaolong violated the rules during the new students\u2019 assessment and sneak attacked Jiang Teng . And now, Jiang Teng is heavily injured, I intend to detain this person and bring him before you\u2013 I\u2019m waiting for your punishment order!\u201dHaving said this, Zhong Yuan\u2019s turned to look at Huang Xiaolong; his hand motioned to the several Disciplinary Hall staff behind him and said, \u201cCapture this Huang Xiaolong for me!\u201dJiang Teng was both Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu\u2019s pro-disciple and he was beaten till this state by Huang Xiaolong . In Zhong Yuan\u2019s thinking, this was an excellent opportunity to perform well and garner some merits in front of them .\u201cYes, Leader Zhong Yuan!\u201d acknowledged the Disciplinary Hall enforcement staff .Other than being a Third Year teacher, Zhong Yuan was also the Disciplinary Hall\u2019s Squad Leader .Just as the dozen people were about to step out and capture Huang Xiaolong, Sun Zhang\u2019s slightly angry voice was heard, \u201cStop!\u201dOn hearing Sun Zhang\u2019s order, the group of Disciplinary Hall\u2019s enforcers abruptly halted .\u201cWell, all of you may leave, I will handle this matter!\u201d Sun Zhang waved his hand and said, but the brilliant smile had left his face .But, it seemed like Zhong Yuan didn\u2019t quite understand the meaning of Sun Zhang\u2019s words; he thought that Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu were trying to make them leave because they wanted to punish Huang Xiaolong personally since Huang Xiaolong hurt their pro-disciple which had angered them immeasurably .Zhong Yuan laughed out loud, \u201cPrincipal, this is just a new student . This one doesn\u2019t dare bother Principal to handle such a small matter . Please rest assured and leave this to us . \u201d As he finished saying that, his silhouette flashed towards Huang Xiaolong . Fingers bent into claws and aimed at Huang Xiaolong, making a move himself .When Zhong Yuan was inches away from Huang Xiaolong, a figure flashed with a speed faster than Zhong Yuan\u2019s . A hand lifted and a palm landed on Zhong Yuan\u2019s cheek, slapping him away .The square was filled with silence .Clutching his left cheek, unbelievably, it was Sun Zhang that was guarding Huang Xiaolong; the one who slapped him was their Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s Principal, Sun Zhang!Zhong Yuan was shocked, Sun Zhang eyes were staring daggers at him\u2013 he had never seen the Principal look like this before, causing his heart to shiver in fear .\u201cYou didn\u2019t understand my meaning?\u201d Sun Zhang turned sullen: \u201cScram for me!\u201dAt this moment, even if Zhong Yuan was a pig, he could see Principal Sun Zhang\u2019s fury .\u201cYes, yes, Principal, we\u2019re leaving now; scramming away immediately!\u201d Zhong Yuan\u2019s face became ashen with fear; he turned around wanting to leave quickly with the Disciplinary team . However, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s voice rang out: \u201cNot so fast!\u201dHuang Xiaolong\u2019s voice came out abruptly, causing everyone to look over at him .Huang Xiaolong stared at Zhong Yuan, before turning and looking at Sun Zhang, \u201cExpel him or expel me!\u201dThe unexpected words stunned everyone speechless: Huang Xiaolong actually made such a request .This Zhong Yuan displeased, and it showed in his expression .Of course, Huang Xiaolong knew that Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu definitely wouldn\u2019t agree to expel him if they were smart; with his talents, no matter which kingdom\u2019s academy he chose to enter in the surrounding kingdoms, all of them would compete for him .Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu exchanged a glance .But, neither of them opted to speak immediately because Zhong Yuan was not only Third Year teacher and a Leader of the Disciplinary Enforcement Hall; his sister was a\u00a0wangfei . Although not favored, with her status and position, Zhong Yuan was considered as the King\u2019s little brother-in-law .\u201cExpel me?\u201d Zhong Yuan paused and turned around and looked at Huang Xiaolong like he just heard the world\u2019s funniest joke .Huang Xiaolong ignored him and continued speaking to Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu, \u201cAt the end of the year, if I take first place in the First Year competition, you will expel him from the Academy . \u201dHuang Xiaolong was aware, no matter how good his talent was, both Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu won\u2019t agree to expel a Third Year teacher just based on his words\u2013 when he returned to the Marshal Mansion on the registration day, he had asked Marshal Haotian to investigate this Zhong Yuan\u2019s background .\u201cYearly Competition\u2019s first place?\u201d Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu, and the surrounding people were shocked with both eyes practically popping out . With Huang Xiaolong\u2019s peak late-Fourth Order\u2019s strength, the First Year competition\u2019s first place was a sure thing; however, there were only five months to the end of the year . Some of the older First Year students had broken through to the Sixth Order and some even reached the peak late-Sixth Order . How could Huang Xiaolong grab the first spot? With his talents, it might be possible in another two year\u2019s time .Hearing this, Zhong Yuan laughed aloud with mockery and ridicule as he stared at Huang Xiaolong, \u201cPunk, did you just say you will take the First Year competition\u2019s first place?\u201dHuang Xiaolong kept silent, looking at Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu .\u201cOkay!\u201d Moments later Sun Zhang nodded in agreement, \u201cIf you get the first place in the First year competition, apart from the standard Academy\u2019s reward, I will add another high-grade Earth rank battle skill!\u201dWhen they heard that not only did Principal Sun Zhang agree, he had even added an extra reward, they all were dumbfounded .Truth be told, Sun Zhang agreed because he didn\u2019t believe Huang Xiaolong could take first place; thus, it was nothing even if he agreed to it . This way, he could resolve Huang Xiaolong\u2019s resentment and at the same time motivate him to practice and work harder .\u201cGood!\u201d Huang Xiaolong sealed the deal .At the side, Zhong Yuan, was angry when Sun Zhang agreed, but he didn\u2019t dare show it in public . Furthermore, in his opinion, it was an impossible feat for Huang Xiaolong .And not only did he think so, basically everyone else thought so .After that, Huang Xiaolong turned his attention towards Xiong Meiqi; without a doubt, based on the strength he exposed earlier, it was enough for him to take the first place in the new students\u2019 assessment . Therefore, it was time for Xiong Meiqi to fulfill her side of the bet!The new students who knew about Huang Xiaolong and Xiong Meiqi\u2019s bet saw \u00a0Huang Xiaolong looking at Xiong Meiqi and all their expressions turned weird .______________________________________________________________Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her eyes turned a pale white .Bet? While Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu\u2019s were still confused, the pale Xiong Meiqi suddenly knelt down . She just knelt down in the square like that, opened her small cherry like mouth, \u201cWang! Wang! Wang!\u201d and she cried out three times in a row .Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu were stunned agape .While Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu remained confused and stunned, Xiong Meiqi suddenly stood up, turned around and fled, disappearing without a trace .All around the square were dazed faces .Looking at the direction in which Xiong Meiqi disappeared; Huang Xiaolong felt she wasn\u2019t as hateful as he had thought . At the very least, she dared to say and dared to do . Initially, he had thought she would surely try to wriggle out of it .Xiong Chu looked at his daughter's disappearing silhouette, and could only shake his head .Due to Xiong Meiqi running away, the new students\u2019 assessment stopped midway and did not continue .Huang Xiaolong and the others dispersed from the square .Sun Zhang\u2019s eyes flickered a he looked at Huang Xiaolong\u2019s receding silhouette, \u201cIt looks like, within the next two days, I should make a trip to the Marshal\u2019s Mansion, and have a chat with that old fellow Haotian!\u201dHaving understood the meaning hidden in Sun Zhang\u2019s words, Xiong Chu laughed and said, \u201cBased on Principal\u2019s good relation with Marshal Haotian, coupled with Principal\u2019s strength and identity, I\u2019m sure Marshal Haotian would be happy to agree to let Huang Xiaolong become Principal\u2019s disciple . \u201dSun Zhang nodded; he nodded not because he was worried (about Huang Xiaolong becoming his disciple), but he because was curious about Huang Xiaolong\u2019s martial spirits .That old fellow Haotian should know, right? Sun Zhang thought secretly . He was about to leave but laughed bitterly when he remembered Jiang Teng\u2019s unconscious body, and said to Xiong Chu, \u201cLet\u2019s go, we should first stabilize Jiang Teng\u2019s injury before talking about anything else . \u201dXiong Chu also smiled bitterly and nodded .Thereafter, both of them carried the unconscious Jiang Teng and disappeared from the square in the blink of an eye .Huang Xiaolong however, went to the library instead of returning to the classroom .The first floor of the library was opened to all Academy students, however, battle skills and cultivation techniques were kept on the second floor, third floor, and the fourth floor . Therefore, only those that had accomplished tasks issued by the Academy, and had a certain amount of contribution points were allowed to go to those floors .Of course, Huang Xiaolong didn\u2019t enroll into the Academy to learn their battle skills or cultivation technique; even though he had lived in this Martial Spirit World for almost ten years, the things he understood were very little . So, he wanted to read more books to learn about this world .After reading two books on martial spirits, Huang Xiaolong noticed a book titled \u2018Supernatural Ability\u2019 on a bookshelfSupernatural ability?His curiosity was stoked, and he took the book then started to flip through the pages . The more he read the more captivated he became . The book not only described the many different martial spirit supernatural abilities, but also the usage, strengths, and weaknesses . Although it wasn\u2019t in full detail, it was enough to open a new door for Huang Xiaolong .A little more than an hour later, Huang Xiaolong returned the book to its rack, and picked another book .While Huang Xiaolong was concentrating on books in the library, the entire Academy was swept by a wave of intense discussion .\u201cI heard today in the new students\u2019 assessment, a new student called Huang Xiaolong nearly destroyed that student Jiang Teng who possesses a grade eleven martial spirit!\u201d\u201cThis is a hundred percent true! I was in the square at the time\u2013 that Huang Xiaolong suddenly exposed a peak late-Fourth Order strength!\u201d\u201cThe peak late-Fourth Order! How old is this Huang Xiaolong, not even ten, right? This is too terrifying!\u201d\u201cI also heard that this Huang Xiaolong came to register with the Principal\u2019s recommendation letter; previously, Jiang Teng called him a \u201cwaste\u201d every time he opened his mouth!\u201dThere was such discussion in every corner of the Cosmic Star Academy, regardless of whether it was an older student or teacher, they were all shocked when they heard it while at the same time, everybody was trying to guess what Huang Xiaolong\u2019s martial spirit was .It was near noon when Huang Xiaolong left the library . When the older students who were present in the square that morning recognized Huang Xiaolong, they started to point and whisper with a weird expression .Huang Xiaolong could hear the discussions around him, and he shook his head; he hadn\u2019t expected that news in this world spread just as fast; after all, three hours had barely passed since the incident in the morning .\u201cYoung Master!\u201d The waiting Fei Hou and the four Marshal Mansion\u2019s guards had seen Huang Xiaolong come out and quickly went to him greeting him as they got nearer .Huang Xiaolong nodded then took the five of them to Tianxuan Mansion .\u201cYoung Master, we heard you nearly wasted that Jiang Teng!\u201d On the way, Fei Hou said .\u201cYou all heard about it?\u201d Huang Xiaolong was surprised and smiled bitterly .The five of them laughed, and Fei Hou said, \u201cThat Jiang Teng was the exalted Academy genius in more than a hundred years possessing a superb talent martial spirit and he\u2019s also Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu\u2019s disciple at the same time . The matter about Young Master almost turning him into a waste caused great waves that spread throughout all of Royal City!\u201dIt even spread throughout Royal City?Huang Xiaolong was a little astonished and frowned, but he gradually relaxed . It was useless to hide anymore\u2013 soon enough there would be people who would find out that he had a vague connection with the Marshal\u2019s Mansion . Moreover, with Marshal Haotian\u2019s presence, there shouldn\u2019t be anyone who dared to make a move against him; at least he was still safe while in the Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s Royal City!Soon, they arrived at the Tianxuan Mansion .Allowing the four guards to stand down, Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou sat in the main hall where he asked Fei Hou about his progress in practicing the \u2018Liquid Thunder Arts\u2019 .Fei Hou answered with a happy face, saying, \u201cSovereign, your subordinate has been diligently practicing the cultivation technique that you passed down in these past few days, and my battle qi cultivation has increased exponentially!\u201dBased on the speed of his cultivation these past couple of days, there was no need for five years\u2013 perhaps in four years\u2019 time he could breakthrough into the Xiantian realm .Huang Xiaolong nodded and he asked Fei Hou about the matter regarding the purchase of slaves .And Fei Hou reported everything in detail to Huang Xiaolong .For the last couple of days, Fei Hou carefully selected twenty-six slaves and started to nurture them by teaching cultivation techniques .Listening to Fei Hou\u2019s report, Huang Xiaolong nodded with satisfaction .\u201cI\u2019ve decided that in two days I will go and train in the Silvermoon Forest . \u201d\u00a0 said Huang Xiaolong (in a low but serious tone) after Fei Hou was done with his report . \u201cI should be back around the end of the year\u2019s competition . \u201d\u201cWhat? Sovereign, you want to go into the Silvermoon Forest to train alone?\u201d\u00a0 Fei Hou\u2019s expression changed, worried, he asked, \u201cSovereign, this, it\u2019s better if Subordinate accompanies you!\u201dHuang Xiaolong waved his hand saying, \u201cNo need . \u00a0 In the upcoming five months, stay in the Tianxuan Mansion and train the slaves . Also, you must diligently practice the Liquid Thunder Arts every day . \u201dFei Hou wanted to say more, but Huang Xiaolong shook his head, \u201cDon\u2019t say any more, I\u2019ve decided!\u201d With his current strength combined with his supernatural ability to conceal himself within shadows, as long as he doesn\u2019t venture too deep into the forest, there won\u2019t be much danger . Furthermore, Huang Xiaolong didn\u2019t want to continue relying on Fei Hou and Marshal Haotian\u2019s power .Seeing that Huang Xiaolong had made up his mind, Fei Hou could only accept the order respectfully .While Huang Xiaolong decided to enter the Silvermoon Forest in two days\u2019 time, on the other side of the Marshal Mansion, there was an uninvited guest \u2013 Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s Principal, Sun Zhang!Sun Zhang arrived in the Marshal Mansion and chatted some miscellaneous stuff with Marshal Haotian before stating the purpose of his visit: his desire to take Huang Xiaolong as his disciple .\u201cWhat? You want to take Huang, Huang Xiaolong as your disciple?\u201d Marshal Haotian was shocked, so much so that even his voice became awkward . Then, without any doubt or hesitation, shook his head and said: \u201cNo!\u201dWhat a joke, Huang Xiaolong was their Asura\u2019s Gate Sovereign . How can a little Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s Principal qualify to have him as a disciple?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Senior Yu Ming, can\u2019t decide!\u201d Shock was obvious on his face; Yu Ming was a Tenth Order Xiantian expert! But, Yu Ming can\u2019t make such a small decision for Huang Xiaolong?!Then, what was Huang Xiaolong\u2019s real identity?Marshal Haotian nodded seriously at Sun Zhang .The truth was, there was something that he didn\u2019t say to Sun Zhang and that was even his own Shizu was not qualified to take Huang Xiaolong as a disciple .Marshal Haotian\u2019s Shizu!Saying it out loud would be too shocking; thus, Marshal Haotian kept it to himself and didn\u2019t say it to Sun Zhang .Although they were good friends, Marshal Haotian had never spoken about his connection with Asura\u2019s Gate, so Sun Zhang didn\u2019t know he was an Asura\u2019s Gate disciple .Not long later, Sun Zhang walked out from the Marshal Mansion disappointed . He looked up to the blue sky with floating groups of white clouds and the blaring sunlight .\u201cDidn\u2019t expect that little guy\u2019s identity to be so not simple . \u201d Sun Zhang muttered to himself . \u201cCould he be that Duanren Empire\u2019s Prince?\u201d Then, he shook his head, dismissing the thought .Leaving the Marshal Mansion, Sun Zhang headed straight back to the Academy .Night arrived .The day\u2019s heat slowly dissipated as night fell and a cool breeze blew in the night .Huang Xiaolong was sitting cross-legged on the cold jade bed in the master bedroom of the Tianxuan Mansion . Battle qi was circulating in his meridians; however, he wasn\u2019t practicing . These past couple of days, a thought stuck in his mind; since his twin dragon martial spirits could fuse to become one and they could separate to become two independent entities, then maybe he could summon them out individually .And now how was experimenting how to accomplish an individual summoning .If he could control and summon only one of his martial spirits out, then he wouldn\u2019t need to worry about his twin martial spirits being discovered by others . Under normal circumstances or during battle, he would release just the black dragon .But despite two days\u2019 worth of effort, every time Huang Xiaolong summoned his martial spirits, both the black and blue dragon would appear . This was akin to the left and right hand writing different characters at the same time, an impossible act .Because humans can\u2019t focus on two things at the same time .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s attempts failed again and again, but Huang Xiaolong didn\u2019t feel discouraged and continued to try after each failure .The night passed as dawn arrived bringing light . Although he didn\u2019t succeed, he found that his control over his twin dragon martial spirits had become more refined .Previously, he needed at least three breaths to summon his martial spirits, but now he could do it within two breaths\u2019 of time .Coming out from his room into the yard, Huang Xiaolong stretched his limbs a little then heard a loud bellowing voice coming from the backyard . Curious, he strolled towards the backyard to have a look . In the backyard Fei Hou and the newly bought slaves were practicing the Luohan Fist: the fist fighting style he taught Fei Hou and asked, Fei Hou to teach it to the slaves .Observing the slaves, Huang Xiaolong nodded in satisfaction . In just a few days\u2019 time, these slaves had already familiarized themselves with the moves, showing their battle skills and battle qi comprehension were quite good . It was the requirement he had given Fei Hou\u2013 the people he wanted must fulfill two things: number one was loyalty, and second, possessing a certain level of comprehension in battle qi and battle skills .\u201cYoung Master!\u201d Seeing Huang Xiaolong strolling over, Fei Hou quickly went up in greeting .Huang Xiaolong nodded . Then he pointed at Beastman Boli who was practicing Luohan Fist in the square, saying to Fei Hou, \u201cYou guide Boli more so he can guide the other leaving you time for your own practice . \u201d\u201cYes, Young Master!\u201d Fei Hou replied respectfully .\u2018Let\u2019s go . \u00a0Accompany me for a stroll outside . \u201d Huang Xiaolong said to Fei Hou . He had been in the Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s Royal city for some days and had yet to take a good look around . Thus, Huang Xiaolong decided to go out .Also, he would be going to the Silvermoon Forest two days later and would stay inside for five months . So, he wanted to buy a few things and visit Li Lu as well as the Li Family\u2019s silk shop . He had grown taller since he left Huang Clan Manor, reaching one hundred and fifty centimeters tall, so he might as well have a few sets of new clothes made there .Huang Xiaolong, Fei Hou, and the four Marshal Mansion guards stepped out of Tianxuan Mansion and walked along the streets .The morning was bright, and the air fresh . Huang Xiaolong was in a good mood as he walked along the street as it got busier with the common folks, and the shops were also opening for business for the day .The truth was, living an ordinary life is also a kind of happiness .Going through several streets, the six of them finally arrived at the Li Family\u2019s silk store shop .Because it hadn\u2019t been a week since the Academy lessons had started, so Li Cheng who accompanied Li Lu over to the Royal City hadn\u2019t gone back to Canglan County . When he saw that Huang Xiaolong\u2019s group of people came, he quickly came out from the inner hall to meet them .\u201cXiaolong, Senior Fei Hou!\u201d Li Cheng greeted full of smiles .Huang Xiaolong nodded and called Li Cheng \u2018Uncle\u2019 as he entered the shop with Fei Hou and the others .Li Cheng invited them into the inner big hall, quickly ordering the servants to serve tea . This time in the presence of Huang Xiaolong, Li Cheng\u2019s actions were a little stiff, and when he sat down, his hands were trembling not knowing what to do with them .Seeing this, Huang Xiaolong guessed that Li Cheng already knew about what happened during the new students\u2019 assessment\u2013 that he nearly turned Jiang Teng into a waste . Li Cheng probably also heard the rumors that he had some indeterminable connection with Marshal Haotian .It was already spread to the whole Royal City, he being connected to Marshal Haotian was no longer a secret .As for what kind of connection it was, the public continued to speculate and many different versions came out .\u201cUncle, I came to order a few sets of clothes . \u201d After sitting down, Huang Xiaolong explained his purpose .\u201cMake a few set of clothes?\u201d Li Cheng blanked for a moment then quickly stood up . He personally went to the measurements tool to record down Huang Xiaolong\u2019s measurements . Huang Xiaolong laughed, asking him to let the servants do it . However, Li Cheng insisted on doing it himself which left Huang Xiaolong feeling embarrassed and awkward .As he watched Li Cheng taking his measurements, Huang Xiaolong couldn\u2019t help but think of his parents in Huang Clan Manor, Huang Peng and Su Yan . If they knew he was in the Royal City, and Li Cheng was taking his measurements personally, what would they think?It was done quickly, and they both sat down . After he thought about something for a moment, he said to Li Cheng, \u201cUncle, my mom and dad don\u2019t know that I\u2019m here in the Royal City . \u00a0For the time being, I would like to keep this from them in case they worry too much . When you return, please don\u2019t mention this to my parents . \u201dUnderstanding the underlying meaning of Huang Xiaolong\u2019s words, Li Cheng reassured him with haste, \u201cXiaolong, don\u2019t worry . I won\u2019t say any of these things when I return . \u201dHuang Xiaolong nodded his head . Otherwise, when he returned at the end of the year, both of them definitely would pester him with many questions about this .At this time at the storefront, there was a sudden commotion and angry shouting voices .Huang Xiaolong frowned at the loud noises\u2013 he could tell that someone was trying to make trouble outside . Also, Li Cheng\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t nice when he heard the angry, scolding voices from the store front .These past\u00a0few days, there was someone who intentionally came to make trouble, even aggressively assaulting and injuring the shop workers . He didn\u2019t expect that they would show up again today .Note:Shizhu- lit . Master Ancestor; higher than Grandmaster .Yu Ming is Haotian (a Second Order Xiantian) and Fei Hou's Master .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Thus, the seven people stepped out of the inner main hall towards the shop\u2019s entrance .When they came to the shop\u2019s front, they saw more than a dozen people wearing green-colored clothes smashing and throwing things belonging to the shop onto the floor .This group of people was cursing angry words while destroying the shop\u2019s items .\u201cIs this what they call silk? All these are smelly cloth taken from garbage dumps, such terrible, foul smell! You dare to use this kind of smelly cloth to make our clothes, your mother, you must be tired of living!\u201d\u201cSmash everything, no need to hold back!\u201dSome of the store workers that tried to stop these hooligans were treated with unruly punches and kicks . There were already six to seven workers groaning in pain on the floor, it seemed their injuries were not light .\u201cStop! Stop your actions!\u201d Confronted with this situation, Li Cheng yelled anxiously and had an ugly expression on his face .The men in green clothing pretended they didn\u2019t hear him; but instead, it seemed as if they even exerted much more effort in their wanton destruction .Li Cheng became furious, walked forward and was about to attack when suddenly, one of the green-clothed men flew towards Li Cheng with his arms spread out . His finger curled into claws aiming at Li Cheng\u2013 his atmosphere was quite strong, a late Seventh Order .With the man coming at him out of nowhere, Li Cheng was shocked . As he raised his hand up to defend himself, a silhouette acted faster than him and used a palm to slap away the green-clothed attacker, who flew away screaming, landing on the shop floor with a bang . His body curled into a lump and from the look of it, he wouldn\u2019t survive .The one who deflected the attack was one of the Marshal\u2019s Mansion Ninth Order guards .The abrupt change in situation caused the other green-clothed men to pause their acts of destruction and look over in the guard\u2019s direction .A middle-aged man, who seemed to be the leader of the group, glanced at his companion that was on the floor curling in pain, his face became solemn . Then, his attention turned towards Huang Xiaolong\u2019s group .\u201cWho are you all? This is our Green Hawk Gang\u2019s matter, you had better mind your own business and not stick your noses into other people\u2019s problem!\u201d \u00a0The middle-aged man \u2018kindly\u2019 advised them in a sullen voice .The group of men in green gathered behind the burly middle-aged man after they had stopped smashing things around the silk store .\u201cGreen Hawk Gang!\u201d Li Cheng\u2019s face lost its color .Green Hawk Gang? Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes showed confusion and cluelessness . And at this point, a Marshal\u2019s Mansion guard stepped forward and said, \u201cYoung Master, this Green Hawk Gang in one of three biggest gangs in the Royal City . The gang leader, Jiang Wei is a Tenth Order warrior, and has good connections with some of the city\u2019s nobles . \u201dOne of three biggest gangs in the Royal City? Huang Xiaolong nodded his head, in simple terms these so-called gangs were similar to those mafia syndicates on Earth . However, since this Green Hawk Gang was said to be one of three biggest gangs, their forces didn\u2019t seem to be weak .Huang Xiaolong looked at Li Cheng; in his opinion, the Green Hawk Gang shouldn\u2019t have any grudges with the Li Family . So, there was only one possibility: the other side got orders from someone .\u201cThat\u2019s right, we are from the Green Hawk Gang, one of the three biggest gangs in the Royal City!\u201d The middle-aged man declared arrogantly . His eyes moved from one face to the other and stopped on Huang Xiaolong\u2019s, glaring at him with a trace of viciousness, \u201cWithin the Royal City, not many people dare to injure our people!\u201dHuang Xiaolong remained aloof, \u201cSpeak, who instructed you to make trouble here?\u201dWhen the middle-aged man heard this question, his face was gloomy, \u201cPunk, which family are you from? Your words and actions could bring annihilation to your entire family!\u201dThis sentence wasn\u2019t just a false threat to frighten people; the families that went against the Green Hawk Gang in the Royal City didn\u2019t have happy endings .After the middle-aged man said those threatening words, the four guards from the Marshal\u2019s Mansion behind Huang Xiaolong exchanged knowing glances and broke out in loud laughter .Entire family\u2019s annihilation?One such as the Green Hawk Gang wants to annihilate the Marshal Mansion?Even Huang Xiaolong couldn\u2019t resist shaking his head with a faint smile .Seeing themselves being laughed at by the four guards from the Marshal\u2019s Mansion (but he didn\u2019t realize their identities), the members of the gang grew gloomier .At this point, Huang Xiaolong turned to the four guards and said, \u201cYou guys, arrest them and find out who ordered them to make trouble here . \u201d\u201cYes, Young Master!\u201dHearing this, the middle-aged man\u2019s face looked ugly and was about to retreat, but it was already too late . The four guards from the Marshal\u2019s Mansion flashed from their original position and blocked their escape path\u2013 at the same time, they rained attacks on the group of green-clothed \u2018hawks\u2019 .Pitiful screams sounded in the silk store .This group of Green Hawk Gang members were mostly of the Fifth and Sixth Order strength; the middle-aged man was slightly stronger than the rest, but even he was still only a peak late-Seventh Order . \u00a0How was he an opponent against the Marshal Mansion guards? In less than the time it would take to drink a cup of tea, the four guards had dealt with them, leaving them lying down on the floor .One of the Marshal\u2019s Mansion guards, a Tenth Order Warrior named Wang Ning, stared at the middle-aged leader and a cold voice sounded, \u201cOur Young Master asked, who gave the order for you to make trouble here?!\u201dThe middle-aged man cried \u2018pei\u2019 and spat out some frothy blood, not answering the question .Seeing this, Wang Ning sneered . His hands shaped into claws and grabbed the man\u2019s hands and gave both of them a twist, breaking the hands without mercy .An agonizing scream came from the middle-aged man .\u201cIf you would prefer not to have both of your legs suffer the same fate, you had better answer the question honestly . \u201d Wang Ning\u2019s cold voice sounded .\u201cI, I\u2019ll talk!\u201d His face already turned deadly pale, his voice shook as he said, \u201cMore than ten days ago, a person came looking for our Green Hawk Gang\u2019s leader, and ordered him to do so, told us to come here and make trouble!\u201d\u201cOrdered?\u201d A light flickered in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes . To be able to order the Green Hawk Gang\u2019s leader around, this person\u2019s identity definitely wasn\u2019t simple .Who could this person be? Why target the Li Family?Even the burly middle-aged man didn\u2019t know that person\u2019s identity, thus questioning him further solved nothing .Huang Xiaolong looked at Li Cheng, and Li Cheng shook his head . He couldn\u2019t seem to figure out who his family had a grudge with that would be so bad .\u201cCould it be them?\u201d Suddenly, Li Cheng\u2019s face paled and said to Huang Xiaolong, \u201cXiaolong, do you remember the day of my father\u2019s eightieth birthday?\u201d As he said this, grief and resentment appeared on his face .Eightieth birthday? Huang Xiaolong thought of the Old Patriarch Li, Li Mu\u2019s birthday banquet two years ago . The two mysterious people with poisonous snake martial spirits?At that time, the other side sent Li Lu\u2019s elder brother, Li Feng\u2019s corpse, as a birthday gift .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s head turned towards the Tenth Order guard, Wang Ning, asking him \u201cWhere is the Green Hawk Gang\u2019s headquarters located?\u201d Whether or not this was ordered by those two mysterious people, things would be clearer if they asked the Green Hawk Gang\u2019s leader, Jiang Wei .Since the Huang Clan Manor and the Li Family were old friends and this happened in front of him, he couldn\u2019t pretend not to see .\u201cReplying Young Master, the Green Hawk Gang\u2019s headquarters is in the south corner of the city, not far from here . \u201d Wang Ning quickly replied .\u201cXiaolong, I\u2019m going together with you!\u201d At this time, Li Cheng recovered and stood up . The Li family has been searching for those murderers\u2019 whereabouts . Every time he thought of the way his son died, Li Cheng felt he would drown with grief .Seeing Li Cheng\u2019s simmering anger, Huang Xiaolong nodded in agreement . He looked at Fei Hou and Wang Ning saying, \u201cBring him along, we\u2019re paying the Green Hawk Gang\u2019s leader a visit . \u201d A finger pointed at the burly middle-aged man on the floor .\u201cYes, Young Master!\u201d Wang Ning and the rest acknowledged respectfullyThus, Huang Xiaolong, Li Cheng, and the others walked out of the silk store and headed towards the south side of the city, towards the Green Hawk Gang\u2019s headquarters .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 62Chapter 62: Poison Blood PalmIt didn\u2019t take too long for Huang Xiaolong and his group to arrive at the Green Hawk Gang\u2019s headquarters .The Green Hawk Gang's headquarters was located on the south corner of the city so it was a little out of the way, but it covered a large area and was bigger than Huang Xiaolong\u2019s Tianxuan Mansion by a few folds .In front of the main entrance of the headquarters stood two huge stone hawk statues and both statues were entirely green .But, what surprised Huang Xiaolong was that there were no Green Hawk Gang members guarding the main entrance when they arrived .One of three Royal City\u2019s biggest gang had no people guarding the headquarter's entrance! And the surrounding area was too quiet .\u201cAs we go in, everyone be very careful . \u201d Huang Xiaolong reminded those with him .\u201cYes, Young Master!\u201d Everyone nodded\u2013 Fei Hou and the rest already noticed the strange silence in the air .As the group neared the main entrance of the Green Hawk Gang\u2019s headquarters, Huang Xiaolong smelled a faint trace of blood; although it was very faint, but he was sure that it was blood .As they got closer, they would occasionally come across trails of blood on the stone floor .But despite that, there were no signs of the Green Hawk Gang\u2019s disciples, causing everyone to feel weird and creeped out .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s brows furrowed .Soon, they got to the main hall . An empty main hall to be exact . But, on the golden throne center-piece was a middle-aged man with thick eyebrows wearing a hawk-patterned robe .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s group exchanged a look amongst themselves .\u201cHe is the Green Hawk Gang leader, Jiang Wei!\u201d blurted out the Marshal Mansion guard, Wang Ning, when he saw the dead middle-aged man on the golden seat .Huang Xiaolong quickly walked up, followed by the others behind him . Jiang Wei\u2019s corpse was sprawled on the chair and both of his eyes were shut tightly . There wasn\u2019t any breath left in him, but there was no blood or wound on his body that Huang Xiaolong could see .A thought flashed across his mind, and Huang Xiaolong raised his palm and hit the center of Jiang Wei\u2019s chest and the hawk-patterned robe exploded into pieces . With the robe gone,Everyone saw on Jiang Wei\u2019s naked chest that there was a muted green palm print . The flesh around the palm print had started to rot and numerous black-green lines spread out from the palm print towards other areas of the body .\u201cA very powerful poison palm strike!\u201d All around everyone\u2019s faces were shocked .\u201cThis should be the low-grade Earth rank battle skill, Poison Blood Palm!\u201d Fei Hou added .Poison Blood Palm!Wang Ning and the three other guards swallowed loudly .\u201cThirty years ago, one of our Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s County Dukes and his entire household from top to bottom all died under this poisonous palm strike . \u201dDespite making all efforts to catch the killer, it was as if the murderer disappeared into thin air after that incident and has never appeared again since then . I didn\u2019t expect to come across this again now!\u201d said Chen Yu who was another Tenth Order Marshal Mansion guard .A County Duke was equivalent to a Huaxia province governor\u2013 a County Duke and an entire household and no less than a thousand guards were killed . The level of turmoil caused by that incident could be imagined .A light flickered in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s pupils and the matter looked more complicated than he had thought . Jiang Wei being dead was beyond his expectation; moreover, he was killed by the Poison Blood Palm .Could the person who killed Jiang Wei be the same one who ordered him to send disciples to make trouble at the Li Family\u2019s silk store? And is the killer one of the mysterious people that appeared during Li Mu\u2019s birthday celebration banquet?\u201cYoung Master, how should we deal with him?\u201d At this time, Fei Hou pointed at the middle-aged man, the leader of the group who made trouble earlier .\u201cPlease, please, I beg you, don\u2019t kill me! Don\u2019t kill me!\u201d The man looked uneasy, anxiously begging Huang Xiaolong for mercy .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s sullen voice said, \u201cLet him go . \u201dEveryone was surprised but no one objected .But the two Ninth Order Marshal Mansion guards said \u2018yes\u2019 respectfully, and released him .\u201cThank you, thank you!\u201d The Green Hawk Gang group leader was overjoyed, thanking Huang Xiaolong incessantly before fleeing away in panic .However, the moment his figure disappeared from view, a loud wail was heard . Everyone was shocked as figures flashed out from the main hall in the next moment and found the middle-aged Green Hawk Gang man crumpled on the floor some distance away . Already dead from the looks of it .Huang Xiaolong walked to the dead body, and pushed away the clothes from the chest, revealing an imprint of a Poison Blood Palm strike .Fei Hou, Wang Ning, and Chen Yu immediately scanned the area, looking alerted .\u201cFei Hou, go check the surroundings!\u201d said Huang Xiaolong as he stood up .\u201cYes, Young Master!\u201d Fei Hou said, and he leaped up to the rooftop, disappearing in a flash . A short while later, Fei Hou returned shaking his head at Huang Xiaolong and respectfully reported, \u201cYoung Master, the other party used a type of movement battle skill (similar to qi qong), and it was too fast and your subordinate was unable to catch up . In this subordinate\u2019s opinion, the other party is a peak late-Tenth Order expert!\u201dA peak late-Tenth Order!Huang Xiaolong frowned, his usual and clear voice sullen with disappointment, \u201cLet us go back and talk . \u201dNot long after they left the scene, the news about the Green Hawk Gang\u2019s leader, Jiang Wei, being killed spread with rapid speed in the Royal City, causing an uproar .The Green Hawk Gang\u2019s leader was a Tenth Order warrior and had more than a thousand subordinates under him, yet he was killed . The topic was discussed in every corner of the city .Night, the Tianxuan Mansion\u2019s main hall .Huang Xiaolong was seated down as Fei Hou briefed Marshal Haotian about the details of what happened earlier in the day at the Green Hawk Gang\u2019s headquarter . And hearing it made Marshal Haotian look solemn .\u201cHaotian, arrange some people to protect Li Lu and Li Cheng . \u201d Huang Xiaolong said .\u201cYes Sovereign, rest assured, I will make proper arrangements . \u201d Marshal Haotian answered with due respect, \u201cSubordinate will investigate this matter and capture the person!\u201d Then, he hesitated for a second before continuing \u201cSovereign, your practice trip to the Silvermoon Forest in two days is too dangerous . Moreover, now that this kind of incident has happened; it would be best to have Fei Hou, Wang Ning, and the others to go with you!\u201dDespite Marshal Haotian\u2019s persuasion, Huang Xiaolong shook his head . \u201cNo need . \u201d If he ran into a Xiantian realm expert, the level of danger would be the same even with Fei Hou and the guards around . And his main purpose was to train\u2013 having them on this trip would be inconvenient .\u201cAs for the Academy, please pass on information to Sun Zhang about my absence . \u201d He planned to train and stay in the Silvermoon Forest for five months; given that it was such a long period, of course, he needed to notify the Academy .Marshal Haotian nodded and accepted the task .A while later, Fei Hou and Marshal Haotian left .Huang Xiaolong returned to his room and took out the cold jade bed . Once again, he sat cross-legged, trying to learn how to summon a single dragon martial spirit .Time flies and two days came and went .These past two days, Fei Hou had prepared everything that Huang Xiaolong would need in the coming five months and the sets of new clothes ordered from the Li Family silk shop were personally delivered by Li Cheng .In the two days\u2019 training, although he still couldn\u2019t summon his martial spirits individually, but he had some headway . He believed he would succeed .Within these two days, Li Lu came to visit Huang Xiaolong once at Tianxuan Mansion, bringing along Li Cheng . Naturally, she was depressed and sulky when she heard that Huang Xiaolong planned to go away and train in the Silvermoon Forest; however, before she left Tianxuan Mansion, Li Lu turned around and in a serious but resolute tone said to Huang Xiaolong, \u201cXiaolong, I will also work hard and cultivate to become a qualified wife for you!\u201d After she made her declaration, she kissed Huang Xiaolong on the cheek .Coming out from his room, Huang Xiaolong thought of the words Li Lu said yesterday and unconsciously, his hand rubbed the spot Li Lu kissed on his left cheek . Smiling bitterly to himself he thought, this girl!One hour later, Huang Xiaolong had packed everything he needed into the Asura Ring and left Tianxuan Mansion, exiting the Royal City alone and walking towards the Silvermoon Forest .This trip, although Fei Hou wasn\u2019t with him, he brought the little violet monkey along . With the little guy, he wouldn\u2019t feel dull and bored in the coming five months of hard training .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 63Chapter 63: Underground Giant TreeTwo months later, inside a cave somewhere within the Silvermoon Forest, Huang Xiaolong was sitting in a cross-legged position . Battle qi glowed in the cave for a long time when suddenly, the space behind him vibrated as a black dragon emerged, floating behind his head .Seconds after this black dragon appeared, it disappeared with a flash and was replaced by a blue dragon . And the blue dragon also floated behind Huang Xiaolong .Two months of persistence and hard work finally brought results! Huang Xiaolong could now summon his martial spirits individually!That\u2019s right, a separate, individual summoning!After two months in the forest, Huang Xiaolong had grown stronger compared to when he left the Tianxuan Mansion, and even his aura changed . His battle qi cultivation had advanced from early-Sixth Order to the peak of the early-Sixth Order .Moonlight shone down, resembling water, and the cave\u2019s surrounding was quiet .In the cave, the black light and the blue light continued to flicker alternately .About an hour later, the lights stopped flickering in the cave as Huang Xiaolong sent his twin dragon martial spirits back into his body; his eyes opened and he stood up and walked out of the cave .Outside the cave, in the quiet moonlit forest, he did not see the little violet monkey which made Huang Xiaolong shake his head . \u00a0This little guy surely took the opportunity to sneak out again while he was practicing .Leaving the cave area, he jumped down while the Blades of Asura were already in his hands . His feet tapped the ground and his body leaped up\u2013 the blades in his hands swung out and blades\u2019 attacks fell downward, akin to a cluster of stars . Sometimes it was violent like an angry roaring storm, sometimes it was soft and gentle, minuscule and hard to detect by the eye .An Asura\u2019s wail echoed and drifted in the air as if it had a mind of its own .In the past two months, he had also focused on training Tears of Asura and the level of power he could display had increased significantly .With his progress and persistent training, Huang Xiaolong estimated that in six months\u2019 time he could achieve major completion for the Tears of Asura technique .Suddenly, while Huang Xiaolong was engrossed in training, the ground below him shook with \u201cHong! Hong! Hong!\u201d sounds . Violent tremors snaked closer to Huang Xiaolong\u2019s position .Huang Xiaolong turned around and saw that some distance away, a huge thirty-meters tall gorilla was chasing a half-meter tall little monkey, and the gorilla and monkey were heading towards his direction .The gorilla was in hot pursuit and his hands slammed down repeatedly on the ground, in an effort to smash the little monkey, but each attack was a failure . Just before the big palm would land a hit, the little monkey flashed and its figure avoided the danger of being squashed into mincemeat . This made the gorilla roar with fury .Looking at the hilarious scene before him, Huang Xiaolong couldn\u2019t help but chuckle . This little guy!The one being chased by the huge gorilla was the same little violet monkey that had sneaked out to play .Everytime Huang Xiaolong focused his attention on training, the little violet monkey would run out . And every time it returned, there would be a big guy chasing behind him . This wasn\u2019t the first time the little violet monkey came back this way .Sometimes, it really gave Huang Xiaolong a headache .\u201cZhi zhi zhi!\u201d From far away, the little violet monkey\u2019s eyes lit up when it spotted Huang Xiaolong . Immediately, it quickly gestured at Huang Xiaolong, obviously saying there is work to do!At this time, the huge gorilla launched another attack, its big palm slammed down at the little violet monkey .\u201cBang!\u201d A loud sound rang out and the spot where the little violet monkey was earlier sunk in with crushed stones scattered about, showing a huge palm shape imprint . The little violet monkey jumped away clutching his butt; it turned and squeaked angrily at the gorilla . Just now, that big guy\u2019s attack nearly destroyed its small butt .Huang Xiaolong shook his head while laughing at the little guy\u2019s antics; his silhouette flashed and when he reappeared he was already in midair with his blades, swinging at the huge gorilla .Seeing that Huang Xiaolong had started to attack, the little violet monkey stopped running and attacked the gorilla together with him .This huge gorilla was a type of beast with a body as hard as steel . Not only did it possess a great amount of strength, its body also had a high defense; its hard skin was like a layer of iron and usually sparks broke out when normal iron weapons clashed with it .Normally, it\u2019s hard to come across a Steel Gorilla\u2013 one really had to wonder where the little guy ran into it .Luckily, this Steel Gorilla had yet to breakthrough to Grade Seven and was still a peak late-Grade Six . With Huang Xiaolong\u2019s Blades of Asura, the hard, steel-like skin was like mud and in just a few minutes, its throat was slashed by his blades .Blood\u00a0spurted out and the Steel Gorilla crashed down to the ground .After the little violet monkey was sure the Steel Gorilla could no longer move, it ran up to the corpse and his small hands began to search for battle trophies .It clawed open the corpse\u2019s head and fished out a beast core and its mouth opened and swallow the beast core whole .Huang Xiaolong couldn\u2019t figure out how the little monkey could distinguish between beasts that had cores and those that didn\u2019t; in general, it was rare for demonic beasts below Grade Seven to have a beast core . However, every demonic beast the little monkey provoked was guaranteed to have condensed out a beast core .After the beast core went into the little monkey\u2019s stomach, Huang Xiaolong walked up to the corpse . Both of his hands formed into claws and he began sucking out the blood soul qi from the Steel Gorilla\u2019s corpse\u2013 he sucked it out and the black threads were absorbed into Huang Xiaolong\u2019s meridians through the veins in his hands .When every trace of the Steel Gorilla\u2019s blood soul qi had entered Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body, he leaped up and clawed at a big tree twenty meters away .Moonlight disappeared from the area as if swallowed by darkness .Two black claw prints appeared in the air .\u201cBang!\u201d A loud sound resounded in the darkness . The big tree twenty meters away had two half-meter long tree marks with a half foot depth, ripped out by Huang Xiaolong . This left two black claw prints on the tree trunk and the deathly aura of ghosts around the tree, exuding a dark energy that caused the tree\u2019s leaves to gradually turn yellow and then black .Looking at the result of the Asura Demon Claw\u2019s first style \u2013 Lament of Thousands of Demons, Huang Xiaolong nodded to himself in satisfaction .While training in the Silvermoon Forest for the past two months, not only had he succeeded in individually summoning his martial spirits, but all his battle skills had increased in power including the Body Metamorphose Scripture .He wouldn\u2019t have been able to progress at such speed if he remained training in the Tianxuan Mansion or the Academy .Suddenly, the little violet monkey beside him squeaked .\u201cAre you saying that in this Steel Gorilla\u2019s lair you found some treasure?\u201d asked Huang Xiaolong when the little monkey finished gesturing . The little violet monkey nodded its head; it turned around and beckoned Huang Xiaolong to follow it as it scurried off in the direction it first appeared from when it was being chased by the Steel Gorilla .Roughly twenty minutes later, a boy and a monkey arrived at a section of lush forest and saw the entrance of an enormous cave .\u201cZhi zhi zhi!\u201d Entering the giant cave, the little monkey grew even more excited and it squeaked cheerfully . It was the first to rush in with Huang Xiaolong following from behind .As they walked into the cave, a light scent wafted at them .And soon the fragrant scent became stronger as they went in deeper into the cave .Some time later, Huang Xiaolong reached a spacious underground part of the cave that looked to be about a thousand square meters large . From the ground to the ceiling was a height of about thirty meters . And in this underground cave, there was a giant tree so big that it needed seven to eight people to fully hug the tree . Branches stretched in all directions of the cave and some roots were crawling along the cave wall .Between the dense leaves of the giant tree were little sparkling lights .Huang Xiaolong was dazed for a moment when he saw the giant tree, and soon it was followed by a feeling of ecstasy and disbelief, \u201cThis, this is a cycad tree?!\u201dA Cycad tree bears a strange fruit called cycad fruit . For those who cultivate battle qi, not only can this fruit can enhance one\u2019s battle qi, it also could enhance the physical body \u2013 from strengthening all the muscles and bones, the flesh, and even the internal organs . Eating cycad fruits on a long term basis could increase the body's defense, making it become as hard as steel, just like the Steel Gorilla . Common swords or blades would find it hard to penetrate through the skin .\u201cZhi zhi zhi!\u201d At this time, the little violet monkey dashed towards the giant tree and was already was climbing up the trunk; tiny hands plucked a cycad fruit and swallowed it whole with a \u2018gulu\u2019 sound .Huang Xiaolong smiled . Sometimes he wondered if the little violet monkey\u2019s nose is a dog nose, probably its nose was even better than a dog\u2019s . If not, how can it smell out treasure fruits within a hundred li?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His left hand received the falling cycad fruit, then he brought it to his mouth and bit into it .Instantly, ambrosia nectar filled Huang Xiaolong\u2019s mouth, and when he swallowed, warm energy flowed into his veins and meridians .He quickly sat down and ran through the Asura Tactics to refine the energy from the cycad fruit .As he refined the cycad fruit, Sixth Order netherworld battle qi started to surge, rolling and crashing in his meridians . At the same time, Huang Xiaolong felt faint traces of the cycad fruit\u2019s spiritual energy nourishing all the muscles, bones, and internal organs of his body, strengthening them and making them firmer .One black and one blue dragon floated around Huang Xiaolong as the netherworld spiritual aura gushed down on him .After he had broke through to the Sixth Order, the speed at which his martial spirits devoured netherworld spiritual energy had increased once again .Night passed .Rays of sunlight shining down from the mountain peaks fell on Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body, warming him .Withdrawing the twin dragons back into his body, Huang Xiaolong stopped running the Asura Tactics cultivation technique and got up . Both fists suddenly punched out at a cave wall twenty meters away and left a foot deep mark .The cave wall shook and loose rocks tumbled down .This result caused his eyes to light up in excitement\u2013 this cycad fruit was truly something special . Just one night of cultivation had increased his physical power significantly and when attacking, the explosive power of his muscles and tendons had become a lot stronger .If he continued to cultivate this way, by just relying on his physical body and its explosive power, he was already a level stronger when compared with warriors of the same level .As he lowered his hands, Huang Xiaolong looked around the cave and noticed that the little violet monkey was refining the cycad fruit\u2019s energy while seated on one of the tree\u2019s branches . The little guy was a puzzle: no matter what type of beast core it swallowed, it didn\u2019t need to spend time refining them, but when it came to wondrous fruits like the Yang Fruit and cycad fruit, it did need to spend time refining them .But, if it wasn\u2019t so, the little guy would be too much of a monster .Seeing that the little monkey was still refining the cycad fruit, Huang Xiaolong did not disturb it and he walked some distance away to a spacious spot and called out the Blades of Asura and began to hone his Tears of Asura skill .Time slowly passed this way .Another month passed quickly .In the past month, Huang Xiaolong spent most of his time practicing in the underground cave; during the day, he focused on the Asura Sword Skill and the Asura Demon Claw, but at night, he swallowed a cycad fruit and cultivated his Asura Tactics and the Body Metamorphose Scripture .Occasionally, Huang Xiaolong would leave the cave with the little violet monkey to hunt demonic beasts together .Huang Xiaolong had been swallowing a cycad fruit to aid his cultivation every day and after one month of nourishment, all his body\u2019s muscles, bones, and internal organs were stronger by more than a fold compared to a month beforeFurthermore, in the last couple of days with the assistance of the cycad fruit, he had finally advanced to mid-Sixth Order .Mid-Sixth Order!In general, people who possessed grade ten martial spirits needed to cultivate for a year to a year and a half before they could reach mid-Sixth Order from early Sixth Order . Huang Xiaolong, however, only used three months\u2019 time to advance .In the past thirty days, there had been a little more than a hundred fruits on the cycad fruit tree, yet Huang Xialong and the little violet monkey consumed more than half of the fruits .On this particular day, while Huang Xiaolong was sitting cross-legged under the cycad tree, cultivating, when footsteps of people entering the cave could be heard .Huang Xiaolong was alerted and he stopped practicing .And at this point, the voices were loud enough for Huang Xiaolong to hear .\u201cThat cycad tree really grows in this underground cave?\u201d\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be wrong . According to the Treasure Mirror\u2019s indication, that cycad tree should be in this cave! The nice scent we smelled earlier is definitely the cycad fruits\u2019 fragrance!\u201dThe group of footsteps grew closer and louder .From the voices, the newcomers were likely to be two people .Huang Xiaolong stood up, and the little violet monkey scurried down the tree trunk and leaped onto Huang Xiaolong\u2019s shoulder; on its little face was a wary expression as it looked in the direction of the underground cave\u2019s entrance .Not long after, two twenty-something-year-old young men arrived .Both men wore light black-colored clothes and on their chests were the pattern of a mystical bird, showing that both men were disciples of the same sect .On arriving at the underground cave, the both men were surprised to see Huang Xiaolong and the little violet monkey . Apparently, they didn\u2019t expect to find anybody here, not to mention a little child and a monkey .However, when they noticed the giant tree behind Huang Xiaolong, their eyes shone brightly, filled with mad ecstasy .\u201cCycad tree!\u201d\u201cThere really is a cycad tree in this underground cave!\u201dOne of them of broke out in loud laughter, \u201cHaha, Wu Gan, I\u2019ve already said the Treasure Mirror was right! The cycad tree is here in this underground cave and with these cycad fruits, we will be able to breakthrough to the Seventh Order!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right and at the end of the year\u2019s outer disciples\u2019 sect competition, we will be able to get in the top three!\u201d responded Wu Gan, the thinner and taller one as he laughed loudly .Both of them were talking and laughing, totally ignoring Huang Xiaolong, who looked like a harmless child and the little violet monkey .In their eyes, these cycad fruits were already in theirs .Huang Xiaolong kept silent the entire time . He watched them with interest: from their clothes, he guessed these two should the disciples of Nine Phoenix Valley from the neighboring kingdom, the Baolong Kingdom .The Nine Phoenix Valley was quite a powerful force in the Baolong Kingdom and could be considered as one of the kingdom\u2019s top forces .After laughing for a while, Wu Gan and the other disciple finally stopped and turned their attention to Huang Xiaolong .\u201cWhat do we do with this kid?\u201d Wu Gan asked, \u201cHow did he get here? Did he get separated from his family\u2019s elders and arrive here by accident?\u201dThe other Nine Phoenix Valley disciple, Chen Yun, sneered, \u201cWhy care about how this kid came here? No matter what, this secret can not be leaked; the cycad tree bears a hundred fruits or so every year and with these fruits, within ten years, our cultivation can reach the Eighth Order!\u201d After he said that, he walked towards Huang Xiaolong .Ten meters away from Huang Xiaolong, Chen Yun unsheathed his long sword as he looked at Huang Xiaolong, saying, \u201cKid, initially your luck wasn\u2019t bad to actually find this place, and from the looks of it, you have eaten quite a number of cycad fruits, how was the fruit\u2019s taste? Delicious? Too bad you bumped into us, and now everything here belongs to us!\u201d\u201cAnd the only thing left for you is to die!\u201dThe long sword in Chen Yun\u2019s hand suddenly stabbed at Huang Xiaolong\u2019s throat .\u201cDon\u2019t worry, with just one sword strike, you won\u2019t feel any pain!\u201dJust when the long sword in Chen Yun\u2019s hand was about to stab into Huang Xiaolong\u2019s throat, it stopped midway . Chen Yun\u2019s face stiffened as he looked on with disbelief: the tip of his longsword was pinched in between two fingers .While he was still stunned, Huang Xiaolong flashed and disappeared . A cold light blade edge slashed past .Chen Yun\u2019s body remained rigid still as both of his eyes slacked and slowly dimmed, then his body fell to the ground .\u201cYou\u2019re right\u2013 just one sword strike, it won\u2019t be painful . \u201d Huang Xiaolong said; his expression cold .Chen Yun\u2019s body fell to the ground and only then, did blood start to seep out from his throat .\u201cChen Yun!\u201d Not far away, Wu Gan shouted when he saw his comrade tumbling to the ground . By this time, Huang Xiaolong had already started moving in his direction .\u201cYou!\u201d Wu Gan\u2019s expression changed for the worse; full of fear, he stepped back unconsciously . Till this very moment, he still couldn\u2019t believe that Chen Yun actually died at the hands of the ten-year-old child before him .Like him, Chen Yun was a peak late-Sixth Order!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In Huang Xiaolong\u2019s opinion, who he was truly wasn\u2019t important because he and this person would not meet each other again .Wu Gan detected the killing intent in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s words and Wu Gan abruptly turned around and his body became like the wind, already escaping towards the entrance of the cave tunnel .But, he had just gotten there when a figure blocked his path . In front of him, a burst of a fierce aura swirled towards Wu Gan, making him retreat in fright .Retreating to his original spot, he saw that it was actually the little monkey who had blocked his path!Seeing the person retreat to the original spot, the little violet monkey grinned and squeaked, making Huang Xiaolong smile . This Nine Phoenix Valley disciple might not have understood what the little monkey said, but Huang Xiaolong did: the little guy was basically saying\u2013 you want to run, you must first ask, I, your Monkey Father\u2019s claws first .Although Wu Gan can't understand the little violet monkey, but the mockery in the blue pupils needed no explanation . Furious at being made fun of by a little animal, Wu Gan fully released his battle qi and summoned his martial spirit .Huang Xiaolong was surprised; this Wu Gan\u2019s martial spirit was a toad type demonic beast, but the only difference was this martial spirit had a tail at its end .\u201cWhat kind of martial spirit is this?\u201dAlthough Huang Xiaolong had read a lot of books relating to martial spirits in the Cosmic Star Academy, he still wasn\u2019t able to recognize this martial spirit . However, in the Martial Spirit World, martial spirits exist in countless forms and there were also many variational martial spirits such that even a Saint level warrior who had a thousand year lifespan wouldn\u2019t necessarily know either .After summoning his martial spirit, Wu Gan suddenly swung his sword towards the little violet monkey .\u201cSunset on the Long River!\u201dSword rays shot forward as if sinking down into the ground, and while the sword rays looked gentle, they contained an endless murderous aura .When the little violet monkey saw the attack, he grinned and instead of retreating, it leaped forward and both of its sharp claws struck out . Claw prints overlapped and space fluctuated .Huang Xiaolong stood there, he had no inclination of joining the fight . He could see that the Nine Phoenix Valley\u2019s disciple hadn\u2019t yet advanced to the Seventh Order; since he has not advanced into the Seventh Order warrior, then the little guy could handle it on its own .And it proved to be true when a short while later, the little violet monkey\u2019s claws turned Wu Gan\u2019s chest into ribbons, blood spurting out instantly .Looking at the claw marks on his chest, Wu Gan was shocked and angry at the same time .Without wasting a moment, the little violet monkey rushed up again .\u201cAnimal, you are looking for death!\u201d Wu Gan swung his sword in anger and the sword rays looked like a rotating sun, shining brightly and forcing the little violet monkey to retreat a step back . Then, Wu Gan flashed and once again tried to escape from the cave opening . But, how could Huang Xiaolong who was watching all this at the side allow Wu Gan to run away? With a shift of his body, Huang Xiaolong was already blocking the path of the escapee .\u201cF*ck off!\u201d Wu Gan roared at the top of his lungs and his sword struck out with anxiety .Huang Xiaolong looked coldly at the other party and the Blades of Asura appeared in his palms as his icy-cold voice sounded, \u201cTears of Asura!\u201d He leaped up and the blades slashed down .Before Wu Gan\u2019s frightened and frantic eyes, many, many blade rays appeared and turned into a violent, thunderous rainstorm that stretched sixty meters wide and enveloped him .Huang Xiaolong landed back on the ground and retrieved the Blades of Asura into his arms .The rays of blade light dissipated and so did the angry thunderstorm .Wu Gan fell to the floor, his eyes still showed emotions such as fear, despair, and dismay . From head to toe, Wu Gan was covered with blood-filled holes, which looked like it was penetrated by drops of sharp rain .Pierced through by over a hundred holes, it was a horrible way of dying .On the ground, from Wu Gan\u2019s body suddenly came the cry of an Asura lasting only for a single moment before it vanished .Watching his opponents expressions of fear, despair, and dismay, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s cold voice rang out, \u201cIndeed the Cycad fruit's taste was quite good, too bad you have no chance to taste it . \u201dWu Gan stopped moving .The truth was, even if the two of them hadn\u2019t planned on silencing him, he still wouldn\u2019t have let them leave the place alive .Just as both young men had said earlier, the underground cycad tree was a secret that could not be allowed to leak out .Although a cycad fruit was incomparable to the Yang fruit Huang Xiaolong had taken years before, this still was a cycad tree that could bear more than a hundred cycad fruits every year!This made the value of this cycad tree much higher than the Yang fruit!With this cycad tree, in the future, Huang Xiaolong could come back here to cultivate two months every year . More importantly, with these cycad fruits, his parents, Huang Peng and Su Yan, have the possibility to advance further in their cultivation . Also, his little sister Huang Min\u2019s martial spirit was going to be awakened soon and these cycad fruits can help to lay a better foundation for her .Of course, not to mention his little brother, Huang Xiaohai, too .A while later, Huang Xiaolong cleaned up the area and dealt with the bodies\u2013 on the two bodies, he \u2018found\u2019 some gold coins, a Battle Qi Dan, and a book called the Treasure Mirror .Flipping through the book, Huang Xiaolong found that it wasn\u2019t some cultivation technique or battle skill manual, but a book introducing a variety of the world\u2019s rare and wondrous treasures, the places they might grow, their uses and benefits .Of course, the book just introduced and mentioned possible places these rare treasures could be found, but it was just possibilities . It still required individuals to actually go and search for it .After he took care of the two corpses, Huang Xiaolong picked all of the cycad fruits from the tree and placed them in the Asura Ring before leaving the underground cave with the little violet monkey and venturing deeper into the Silvermoon Forest .More than a month had passed since the underground cave incident .Somewhere in the Silvermoon Forest near a lake . The green water of the lake made people feel relaxed and there was a naked boy swimming in it . The boy was, of course, Huang Xiaolong .Although only ten years old, his body was already well-proportioned and muscular . And in these four months, he had grown taller again, a little over five feet tall .Suddenly, a little monkey head emerged from the waters . The little violet monkey emerged from the water and it gave a squeak as its hands splashed water in\u00a0 Huang Xiaolong\u2019s direction .Huang Xiaolong laughed wickedly, his body twirled to the side avoiding the water attack and his palm hit the water .One man and one monkey were playing in the lake .Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong and the little violet monkey swam to shore, dried up, and he put his clothes back on .It\u2019s been more than four months, time to go back! Huang Xiaolong thought to himself\u2013 he had just enough time to rush back to the Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s Royal City to participate in the Academy\u2019s year-end competition .After four months of grinding in the Silvermoon Forest, Huang Xiaolong had reached peak mid-Sixth Order and could break through to the late-Sixth Order at any time .Thus, Huang Xiaolong and the little violet monkey journeyed back in the direction of the Royal City .Ten days later, Huang Xiaolong and the little violet monkey appeared before the Luo Tong Royal City\u2019s huge city gates . Looking at the words stating \u2018Luo Tong Royal City\u2019 there was an indescribable feeling in his heart .Luo Tong Royal City, I\u2019m back!Passing the gates into the city, the back of one man and one monkey gradually disappeared from view .However, Huang Xiaolong went straight to Cosmic Star Academy instead of returning to the Tianxuan Mansion .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Feeling delighted, she ran into Huang Xiaolong\u2019s arms same as always and hugged him . He smiled bitterly as the square\u2019s passerby turned to look at them .\u201cOkay, everyone is looking,\u201d Huang Xiaolong persuaded .Only then did Li Lu let go of him .In the few months they had been apart, Li Lu had grown taller; her small face\u2019s features had become even more delicate and her dimples when smiling were even more mesmerizing . Intelligent and bright looking eyes showed cuteness and mischief .Li Lu\u2019s looked down shyly from being stared at by Huang Xiaolong and a trace of a red blush appeared on her cheeks .\u201cXiaolong, tomorrow is the class and year\u2019s competition so you must be careful of Jiang Teng . \u201d Seconds later, Li Lu raised her head and said to Huang Xiaolong, \u201cAfter he was beaten by you last time, Jiang Teng was healed by the Principal and Vice-Principal . He has been training madly for the past few months and has advanced quickly . His current strength is already at peak late-Fourth Order!\u201dThe peak late-Fourth Order? Huang Xiaolong was a bit surprised .He didn\u2019t expect that little punk would break through to the peak late-Fourth Order so soon .Suddenly, Huang Xiaolong frowned a little and his eyes squinted when he noticed Jiang Teng was heading his way with a group of students tagging behind him .Li Lu noticed Huang Xialong\u2019s frown, she turned around, and her expression changed . Immediately, she hid behind Huang Xiaolong as if she was afraid of Jiang Teng .Watching Li Lu\u2019s reaction, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s frown grew deeper .Stopping in front of Huang Xiaolong, Jiang Teng glanced at Li Lu hiding behind Huang Xiaolong and the corner of his mouth curled up in a cruel sneer . He looked at Huang Xiaolong saying, \u201cI heard someone say that you\u2019re back and I didn\u2019t expect it to be true . Huang Xialong, tomorrow is the class competition and this time, I will make you feel regret, regret forever!\u201d At this point, he pointed a finger at Li Lu and spat the words out, one by one, \u201cAt tomorrow\u2019s class competition, I want to see if you can save her like the last time!\u201dWhen Jiang Teng said this, his eyes shone with a fiery fierceness, and it was obvious to everyone present how high the level of animosity Jiang Teng felt towards Huang Xiaolong .The last time, it was on this very spot that Huang Xiaolong defeated him in the public eye, turning him from the Academy\u2019s most talented genius in a hundred years to the Academy\u2019s laughing stock .That incident spread through the entire Royal City and was treated a juicy piece of gossip at the dinner table .These past five months, he lived under mocking eyes and was ridiculed every day and he hated Huang Xiaolong for it! His hate spread to everyone and everything related to Huang Xiaolong!Every single day during these past five months he trained like a madman\u2013 everything was for defeating Huang Xiaolong in front of the Academy in the class competition, to cruelly crush Huang Xiaolong!Looking at Jiang Teng\u2019s full of hatred face, like he (JT) wanted to swallow him (HXL) alive, Huang Xiaolong was indifferent as usual, \u201cTomorrow? No need to wait until tomorrow, summon your \u2018sick cat\u2019 martial spirit out now . \u201d\u2018Sick cat\u2019 martial spirit?!The lackeys behind Jiang Teng had a look of anticipation on their faces towards a good show .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s remark made Jiang Teng turn red with anger and a sharp, cruel light flickered across his eyes, \u201cGood! Huang Xiaolong, since you asked for it, then there\u2019s no need to wait till tomorrow\u2013 I will cripple you now!\u201d After he finished saying that, his battle qi\u2019s dazzling light broke out from his body and his martial spirit, the Sacred Bright Tiger, emerged .Jiang Teng\u2019s energy aura increased exponentially \u2013 first Fourth Order, then mid-Fourth Order to late, then it reached peak late-Fourth Order . Suddenly, it surged again and reached the Fifth Order!\u201cFifth Order! Isn\u2019t Jiang Teng a peak late-Fourth Order? Heavens, he actually broke through to the Fifth Order!\u201d\u201cThis is too horrifying! Not even half a year has passed, and he already passed the Fourth Order and advanced into the Fifth Order!\u201dEveryone present was shocked, including Li Lu .The rumors around the Academy said Jiang Teng had advanced to the peak late-Fourth Order; however, not one person knew that Jiang Teng actually reached the Fifth Order!Jiang Teng\u2019s body burst out in full blast; hearing the shocked gasps and whispers around him, his heart bloated with pride . For the end of the year\u2019s competition, to astound the whole Academy, he who had reached the peak late-Fourth Order went all out and swallowed a treasured elixir his family had kept for more than a hundred years, and forcefully broke into the Fifth Order .\u201cHuang Xiaolong, are you shocked that I am now a Fifth Order?\u201d Jiang Teng stared at Huang Xiaolong and sneered, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you can reach my level!\u201d In normal terms, even if Huang Xiaolong possessed a grade eleven martial spirit like his, it was impossible for him to have the same achievement .From Jiang Teng\u2019s point of view, unless Huang Xiaolong took some precious elixir like he did, at the most Huang Xiaolong would be a peak late-Fourth Order .However, the probability of that was almost nil .Ruthlessness flashed in Jiang Teng\u2019s eyes, \u201cLast time, you gave me fifteen palms! This time, I will return to you thirty palms, one hundred palms!\u201d When Jiang Teng finished saying that, he suddenly leaped out and his fist struck out aiming at Huang Xiaolong . This attack contained all the hate he had been suppressing for the last five months .\u201cTiger Flame Palm!\u201d\u201cTiger King reappear!\u201dA huge tiger and paw print pierced through space .Out of sight, in a corner some distance away, stood Xiong Chu and Sun Zhang . Both were surprised at the strength Jiang Teng had revealed; clearly, the two of them hadn\u2019t expected Jiang Teng to have advanced to the Fifth Order in such a short period of time . The truth was, they had gotten to the square early on, and had seen everything that happened from the beginning, but neither had the intention to interfere .Xiong Chu sighed, feeling comforted, \u201cJiang Teng truly did not disappoint us . In just five months, he has come this far . At first, I thought Huang Xiaolong would secure the first place in the class competition, but now, it seems it may not be so . \u201dSun Zhang\u2019s eyes looked deep and said: \u201cI have been very curious about Huang Xiaolong\u2019s martial spirit and this time, with Jiang Teng\u2019s Fifth Order strength, he probably could force Huang Xiaolong to call out his martial spirit!\u201d\u201cPrincipal, who do you think will lose and who will win?\u201d Xiong Chu asked out of curiosity .Sun Zhang\u2019s voice was deep and somber, \u201cIt should be a tie . \u201dHuang Xiaolong stood on the same spot watching the fierce paw print aiming for him\u2013 his expression was cold, but he didn\u2019t move much . \u00a0A single palm pressed against the void and the Ethereal Palm already struck out towards the Tiger Flame Palm .Jiang Teng, who was in midair when he launched the attack, felt a tyrannical, irrepressible power surge at him like a mighty wave .\u201cHong!\u201d A loud crash rang out, and Jiang Teng was akin to a small pebble hitting the great waves, and \u00a0his body shook and flew out frantically from the impact .Taking advantage of the time it took Jiang Teng\u2019s body hit the ground, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body flashed and reappeared right below Jiang Teng . Cold eyes flickered as another palm struck the falling body .\u201cStop!\u201dBoth Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu shouted at the same time; two silhouettes rushed forward with rapid speed, but it was still too late .Another one of Huang Xiaolong\u2019s palm hit Jiang Teng squarely in the chest . And with a muffled blast sound, Jiang Teng crashed to the ground from mid-air . Tremors traveled across the square ground as spider-line cracks spread out from where Jiang Teng landed .Like a dead dog, Jiang Teng laid on the ground, limbs twitching and his opened mouth issuing a low groaning sound .Two people came down from the air; Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu finally arrived, and when they saw Jiang Teng lying down on like a dead dog, their expressions ashened . Hastening towards Jiang Teng, both of them quickly ran their battle qi, transferring them into Jiang Teng\u2019s body to rescue him, just like last time .The lackeys who came with Jiang Teng and the passerby were immensely frightened of Huang Xiaolong .Several students who were on good terms with Jiang Teng ran away in fear, not daring to stay a moment longer in the square .After smashing Jiang Teng down to the ground with one palm, Huang Xiaolong landed and sent the other side a cold look . This time, he was heavy handed for he wanted to let hi opponent thoroughly understand the gap that exists between them . Otherwise, the other side will always find opportunities to swagger foolishly in front of him in the future .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her gaze fell on the twitching body smashed down by Huang Xiaolong on the ground and she didn\u2019t react for a very long time .Huang Xiaolong was actually so strong!In the last five months, she had been practicing diligently and thought she might have closed some of the distance between herself and Huang Xiaolong . However, she didn\u2019t imagine the gap to reach such a degree!At this point in time, Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu stopped infusing battle qi into Jiang Teng\u2019s body and got up while wiping away the sweat on their foreheads . Fortunately, they acted quickly; if Huang Xiaolong \u2018gave\u2019 Jiang Teng a dozen palms continuously like last time, without a doubt, Jiang Teng would truly be wasted and crippled!The two let out bitter smiles .At first, they thought the fight would come to a tie; but once again, things turned out like the last time!Facing Huang Xiaolong, Jiang Teng lost in just one move!And he lost so miserably!Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu had complicated expressions as they faced Huang Xiaolong; the surprise this little guy gave them was a little too big, but all was well\u2013 their hearts\u2019 tolerance was strong enough to take it .\u201cEr, Xiaolong, your actions towards this little guy is too heavy handed every time,\u201d Sun Zhang commented while smiling at Huang Xiaolong .Looking back at Sun Zhang, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s expression stated \u2018I don\u2019t really care\u2019 and said, \u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019m going back . \u201d He turned around and left directly after throwing out the sentence .Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu\u2019s mouth opened and closed, wanting to say something to Huang Xiaolong; in the end, no words would come out and they could only watch Huang Xiaolong take Li Lu away with wide eyes .After the two small figures disappeared, Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu exchanged a glance and shook their heads .When Huang Xiaolong\u2019s shadow was gone from the Academy square, in a distant corner, Xiong Meiqi slowly walked out into the light with a complicated expression on her face as she looked in the direction Huang Xiaolong took as he left .Just like Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu, Xiong Meiqi was at the Academy square early on and saw everything .After leaving the Academy, Huang Xiaolong and Li Lu went to Tianxuan Mansion .On the way, Li Lu finally recovered from her shock and started to chatter away with Huang Xiaolong, gossiping about the interesting events of the past five months in the Academy .Looking at the cheerful \u2018chatterbox\u2019 Li Lu, he smiled . He liked to see the dimples on Li Lu\u2019s face when she smiles .\u201cYoung Master, you have returned!\u201d When Huang Xiaolong and Li Lu arrived at the Tianxuan Mansion, Fei Hou was going out when he saw Huang Xiaolong . Delighted, Fei Hou rushed up and greeted him .Huang Xiaolong stepped up and patted Fei Hou\u2019s shoulder, affirming \u201cYes, I\u2019m back! Let\u2019s first go inside and talk . \u201dComing into the main hall, the three people sat down .After sitting down, Huang Xiaolong inquired about the progress of Tianxuan Mansion\u2019s armed forces and Fei Hou answered one by one . Fei Hou explained that he went to the slaves market a couple of times and purchased a few new slaves; so now, including Beastman Boli and the others, there was a total of sixty-eight slaves in the Tianxuan Mansion . After undergoing his training, all the slaves had acquired a certain level of foundation in the Luohan Fist supplied by Huang Xiaolong .When Fei Hou brought these slaves back, each of them had some battle qi foundation in them, and after five months of his training, they could already use the Luohan Fist against enemies . The weakest one was on par with a Fifth Order warrior, and the strongest amongst them was Beastman Boli who could fight against a Sixth Order warrior .Listening to Fei Hou\u2019s answers, Huang Xiaolong nodded with satisfaction at the speed of the progress .At this time, Fei Hou hesitated a little before continuing, \u201cYoung Master, tomorrow is your Academy\u2019s class competition . I found out the strongest First Year this round is called Lu Kai . And this Lu Kai was already a peak late-Sixth Order last year and he have probably stepped into the Seventh Order by now!\u201d\u201cLu Kai?\u201d Huang Xiaolong\u2019s brows creased into a furrow: Seventh Order?Below the Tenth Order, there were two bottlenecks \u2013 one was the Fourth Order and the other was the Seventh Order . Once a person advanced to the Seventh Order, the exponential increase in strength was unimaginable, definitely not what a peak late-Sixth Order can rival .If that Lu Kai really had broken through to the Seventh Order, tomorrow\u2019s First Year class competition will be somewhat troublesome .\u201cThat\u2019s right ah, Xiaolong, I\u2019ve often heard our teacher, Xiong Meiqi, mention him . Three years ago, he was a late-Sixth Order, and he has always taken the first place at our Academy First Year\u2019s competition for the past three years . He has never lost even once; also, he\u2019s our Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s prince!\u201d Li Lu added after Fei Hou .\u201cOh, Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s prince?\u201d Huang Xiaolong was a little surprised at the information .\u201cYes, Young Master!\u201d Fei Hou said, \u201cThe Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s King, Lu Zhe, is very attentive towards this son, and I also heard the King will attend tomorrow\u2019s Academy matches . \u201d\u201cKing Lu Zhe will come to watch the competition . \u201d Again, Huang Xiaolong was surprised; it seemed that the Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s ruler attached great importance to this son .\u201cMoreover, this Lu Kai has some relation to Young Master . \u201d Fei Hou continued to elaborate, \u201cThe bet between Young Master and Zhong Yuan five months ago, does Young Master remember? If Young Master takes the first place for the First Year\u2019s competition, the Principal will expel him from the Academy . Lu Kai is Zhong Wangfei\u2019s son!\u201dZhong Wangfei\u2019s son!This time, Huang Xiaolong was truly shocked .Zhong Wangfei was Zhong Yuan\u2019s elder sister . This meant that Lu Kai was Zhong Yuan\u2019s nephew and Zhong Yuan was Lu Kai\u2019s Uncle .Lu Kai, Huang Xiaolong repeated the name once in his heart .Seventh Order huh?\u00a0Looks like the First Year competition tomorrow will be a little more meaningful .\u201cYoung Master, in fact, it doesn\u2019t matter even if you can\u2019t take the first spot in the First Year\u2019s competition . Young Master is still very young, only ten years old, whereas that Lu Kai is already nineteen!\u201d Seeing Huang Xiaolong in deep thought, Fei Hou assumed Huang Xiaolong was worried about the competition tomorrow, so he spoke some words of comfort .Sovereign\u2019s talent can be described as monstrous and was strong compared to others of the same age, but in Fei Hou\u2019s opinion, it was still too difficult for him to win against a Seventh Order warrior .On hearing Fei Hou\u2019s words, Huang Xiaolong laughed lightly; waving his hand and changing the topic, he asked Fei Hou about his progress in the \u2018Liquid Thunder Arts . 'And Fei Hou answered truthfully .\u201cOh right, I have something for you two . \u201d Some time later, Huang Xiaolong remembered something and took out ten pieces of cycad fruit .\u201cThese are cycad fruit!\u201d Staring wide-eyed at the cycad fruit in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s palm, Fei Hou exclaimed out loud in surprise . When Li Lu heard what Fei Hou said, her eyes too opened wide in surprise .\u201cYes, these are cycad fruits . \u201d Huang Xiaolong smiled and said, \u201cThe little guy found it while we were training in the Silvermoon Forest . \"At this moment, the little violet monkey (who was seated beside him) squeaked proudly, both tiny hands gesturing . He obviously was showing off in front of Fei Hou and Li Lu . The little violet monkey\u2019s cute antics made the three people in the hall burst out in laughter .But, finding these cycad fruits was something that one can be proud of .Huang Xiaolong divided the fruits and gave Fei Hou and Li Lu five each .A short while later, Fei Hou and Li Lu left the main hall . Huang Xiaolong also left and went to his courtyard to practice the Asura Demon Claw .Not long later, Marshal Haotian got the message that Sovereign was back from the Silvermoon Forest and quickly went over to Tianxuan Mansion from the Marshal Mansion . Marshal Haotian also mentioned Lu Kai to Huang Xiaolong with a worried tone .It seems not only the Academy\u2019s teachers and students, even Fei Hou and Haotian, don\u2019t believe I can get the first place ah,\u00a0Huang Xiaolong thought to himself inside .Night slowly descended .Moonlight shone brightly over the land .Huang Xiaolong sat cross-legged on the cold jade bed as the twin dragon martial spirits greedily devoured the netherworld spiritual energy .One night passed peacefully just like that .Replaced with warm sunlight, the day of Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s annual event \u2013 the day of the class and year competition had finally arrived .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 68Chapter 68: King Lu ZheOn the day of competition, it was sunny and Huang Xiaolong came out from his room and saw Fei Hou waiting for him respectfully in the yard .When Huang Xiaolong, Fei Hou, Wang Ning, and the three Marshal Mansion\u2019s guards arrived at the Academy square, a sea of people already gathered on the Academy grounds .Because today was the Academy\u2019s annual class and year competition, the Academy\u2019s authorities had specifically allowed each student to bring their families or servants to enter the Academy and watch the competition .Of course, each student can only bring up to five people .Coming onto the Academy grounds, Huang Xiaolong and his group of six headed straight to the Holy Hall .The Academy\u2019s Holy Hall was a few times bigger than the front square; even if tens of thousands people were crammed inside, it doesn\u2019t feel crowded at all .\u201cThat\u2019s Huang Xiaolong!\u201d\u201cHe is this year\u2019s new batch student, Huang Xiaolong? I heard Jiang Teng already broke through the Fifth Order but was nearly \u2018wasted\u2019 by him yesterday!\u201dWhen the crowd saw Huang Xiaolong stepping into the Holy Hall, a buzz erupted amongst the people around . Huang Xiaolong, although a new student was already famous throughout the Academy to the point even the older students and teachers all recognized him .Ignoring the hush-voiced discussions around him, Huang Xiaolong came to a corner of the hall and stood with Fei Hou and the four guards .\u201cXiaolong!\u201d At this time, a pleasant and surprised voice cried out . Huang Xiaolong turned to look and saw a happy Li Lu running towards him . Huang Xiaolong smiled at Li Lu .\u201cI heard this time, not only the King is coming to watch the competition, Marshal Haotian is also coming!\u201d\u201cMarshal Haotian is also coming? The rumor flying around is, that super-abnormal monster Huang Xiaolong is Marshal Haotian\u2019s illegitimate son, don\u2019t know if this is true or not?\u201dOnce again, the crowd roared with this piece of news .Listening to these people\u2019s words in his ear, Huang Xiaolong couldn\u2019t help but smile in bitterness .Suddenly, Huang Xiaolong felt a cold, piercing stare on his body; turning around towards the source, Huang Xiaolong saw Zhong Yuan standing in a group of people .In front of Zhong Yuan stood an imposing young man around eighteen to nineteen years old, encircled by a group of flattering students of both genders . From the looks of it, this young man should be the Prince of the Luo Tong Kingdom, Lu Kai . Also, he was the strongest First Year student according to everyone .At this point, Lu Kai felt Huang Xiaolong\u2019s gaze and two set of eyes met midair .\u201cHe is Huang Xiaolong?\u201d Lu Kai\u2019s mouth opened and asked to no one in particular .\u201cYes, he is that Huang Xiaolong!\u201d Zhong Yuan stepped up and replied immediately .Lu Kao nodded; his expression was the same the whole time, completely unperturbed .As time flowed, the number of people gathering in the Holy Hall became more and more, and some time later, from outside the Holy Temple sounded a loud voice announcing, \u201cThe King, Marshal, and Principal have arrived!\u201dKing Lu Zhe, Marshal Haotian, and Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s Principal, Sun Zhang, arrived together!Instantly, Huang Xiaolong and everyone else in the hall turned around to look at the entrance . At the entrance, a middle-aged man wearing a light yellow dragon robe walked majestically and strode into the Holy Hall under the protection of a group of bodyguards . Without a doubt, that middle-aged man was the Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s King, Lu Zhe, and half a step behind him was Marshal Haotian, and the Cosmic Star Academy Principal, Sun Zhang .With King Lu Zhe\u2019s arrival, the crowd quickly saluted, and the crowd began to noisily chatter in the Holy Hall .\u201cHehe, everyone rise, stand up!\u201d King Lu Zhe stepped up to the specially prepared guest of honor main platform and sat on the main seat . Marshal Haotian and Principal Sun Zhang sat on each side next to the King .After the three \u2018biggest\u2019 people were seated, the rest of the nobles followed suit and sat down .Not long after everyone had taken their seats, Sun Zhang stood up and made a short speech about the competition and the rewards . At the mention of rewards, Sun Zhang raised his voice, \u201cApart from the usual rewards, the King is generous enough to add one million gold coins and a set of an early Earth grade cultivation technique for all first place winners of the Year category . \u201dOne million gold coins!An early Earth rank cultivation technique!The crowd broke out in an uproar, eyes hot with burning desire .Even Huang Xiaolong was surprised . One million gold coins weren\u2019t some spare change, and it was even coupled with an early Earth rank cultivation technique . In the Luo Tong Kingdom, this was not something that could be bought even with gold coins .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes squinted . If he took the First Year\u2019s first place, in addition to the rewards, there was still the Earth rank battle skill that Sun Zhang promised him; then, would he be getting one Earth rank cultivation technique and one battle skill?An\u00a0Earth rank cultivation technique and battle skill were useless to him . But, it can be passed to his parents and his little brother and sister; nonetheless, learning an extra battle skill is an advantage .\u201cThen, let the competition begin!\u201d Sun Zhang glanced at the crowd and finally declared .After Sun Zhang finished his announcement, the hall fell into a brief moment of silence, and then the class competition begins .Cosmic Star Academy has a total of three class years, so the competition was held in three different places .However, only the winner of each class was eligible to contest in the year category competition . Thus, every class of each year needed to compete .The First Years had the most number of classes, a total of fourteen of them . \u00a0And Huang Xiaolong was in the last class, the fourteenth class .In the class level competition, not all the class students will battle it out . Instead, the class teacher would nominate the strongest two people to compete, and the winner was considered as number one . Of course, if there was someone who disagrees with this, they could also challenge the winner .In Class Fourteen of the First Years, undeniably, the two strongest people would be Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Teng . But, yesterday Jiang Teng was almost crippled by Huang Xiaolong; from the injuries, without ten days to half a month\u2019s rest, it would be hard for Jiang Teng to get out from the bed . So, left with no choice, Xiong Meiqi could only nominate Huang Xiaolong and another student called Chen Tong\u2026However, this student called Chen Tong just recently advanced into the Fourth Order . The moment Chen Tong walked up to the stage, he immediately threw in the towel . This result stunned everyone speechless, but no one found it surprising . Even Jiang Teng who possesses a grade eleven martial spirit and broke through to the Fifth Order was nearly wasted by Huang Xiaolong, not to mention a new Fourth Order Chen Tong?Chen Tong\u2019s concession was considered a smart move on his part, knowing one\u2019s limitations .With Chen Tong\u2019s action, no one else in Class Fourteen dared to challenge Huang Xiaolong . Thus, by default, he became the class winner without moving a finger .When Xiong Meiqi announced Huang Xiaolong\u2019s victory, her face was full of complex emotions as she looked at Huang Xiaolong standing up on the stage .While Class Fourteen\u2019s winner was already announced, the other thirteen classes were still in progress; therefore, when Xiong Meiqi made the announcement, everyone exclaimed in surprised gasps .On the honored guests\u2019 platform, King Lu Zhe also noticed the situation around Class Fourteen\u2019s stage; watching Huang Xiaolong, King Lu Zhe said to Marshal Haotian, \u201cHe is Huang Xiaolong? A young hero in the making ah; Haotian, during our time, when we were ten or so, we were just a Fourth Order warrior right?\u201dMarshal Haotian laughed and said, \u201cIt is so, King . \u201dLu Zhe nodded and looked the other way where his son, Lu Kai, was . His eyes showed a spoiled love and he smiled, \u201cI heard some say Huang Xiaolong had a bet with Zhong Yuan, wanting to get the first place in the year competition . Later, probably he will come against Kai\u2019er . \u201dAlthough Lu Zhe spoke in such a manner, his demeanor was relaxed; apparently, he does not believe Huang Xiaolong is his son\u2019s rival to fight for the first place . After the class competition, the contestants for the year competition would draw sticks to determine their next opponent . One after another, till the end, the year category winner will come out, and in Lu Zhe\u2019s opinion, Huang Xiaolong will be eliminated half way, having no opportunity to play against his son .Noticing King Lu Zhe\u2019s smile, Marshal Haotian already saw through his thoughts; smiling, Marshal Haotian did not say anything .A while later, all fourteen classes from the First Year category had been determined with their representative winner . Then, the next event would be the fight for the First Year champion ._____________________________________________________________________________Next release: TmrPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Yang Mingwei was seventeen years old and entered the Academy eight years earlier than Huang Xiaolong . \u00a0During those eight years, he already reached late-Sixth Order .Late-Sixth Order!Li Lu\u2019s face turned a little white when she saw that Huang Xiaolong actually drew the stick with the number four .\u201cXiaolong, why don\u2019t you\u2026\u201d Feeling worried, Li Lu doesn\u2019t know what to say .\u201cIt\u2019s alright . \u201d Huang Xiaolong smiled at Li Lu; he knew what Li Lu wanted to say, but couldn\u2019t articulate .Walking up the stage, Huang Xiaolong and Yang Mingwei came up to each other, face to face .Yang Mingwei has very fair skin, and facial features which were considered handsome; staring at Huang Xiaolong, he laughed and said, \u201cHuang Xiaolong is it? I didn\u2019t expect my first opponent would be you . I heard yesterday you defeated Jiang Teng who broke through Fifth Order, and almost injured him to the point of being crippled! However, the current you is still not my opponent, it\u2019s better you give up voluntarily . \u201d\u201cIs it?\u201d Huang Xiaolong was unaffected by the words; he could tell this Yang Mingwei did not have the intention to mock him, he (YMW) said those words out of \u2018kindness\u2019 to persuade him to throw in the towel .\u201cMake your move . \u201d Huang Xiaolong looked at the opponent and finally spoke .Yang Mingwei was stunned for a second at Huang Xiaolong\u2019s words and shook his head, \u201cSince your heart doesn\u2019t want to give up, then you\u2019d better be careful!\u201d A bright, dazzling light broke out from his entire body after he was done talking . With a flash, Yang Mingwei was already standing in front of Huang Xiaolong and a fist punched out at his chest .Seeing this, Huang Xiaolong lifted his hands and stuck out a Luohan Fist move .\u201cHong!\u201d sounded as Yang Mingwei shook and retreated a few steps back, before managing to steady himself .The crowd was sent into a daze .\u201cYou, a Sixth Order? How is this possible?!\u201d Yang Mingwei found it hard to accept as he looked at Huang Xiaolong . \u00a0Shaking the right arm that had just clashed with Huang Xiaolong\u2019s fist, it was still trembling and becoming numb .After everyone recovered, they sucked in a breath of cold air and a frenzy swept through the crowd .\u201cThis Huang Xiaolong, he actually already reached the Sixth Order! How old is he?!\u201d\u201cEven Yang Mingwei was pushed back!\u201d\u201cWhat a monster, this is too terrifying!\u201dEven on the main platform, King Lu Zhe, Principal Sun Zhang, Vice-Principal Xiong Chu, and the others\u2019 eyes almost protruded out .Unbelievable, especially Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu were shocked agape, looking extremely dramatic and funny .Yesterday in the front square, it already shocked Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu greatly when Huang Xiaolong defeated Jiang Teng before their eyes; they thought Huang Xiaolong was probably a late-Fifth Order warrior, or at most a peak late-Fifth Order, but now, even a Sixth Order warrior, Yang Mingwei, was pushed back by Huang Xiaolong!What kind of thing was this?After the feelings of shock passed, Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu\u2019s body trembled with excitement; in their hearts, they had to tamp down their impulse to rush up towards Huang Xiaolong and embrace him .While everyone outside of the stage was in shock, Huang Xiaolong looked at Yang Mingwei, saying \u201cUse all your strength . \u201d Huang Xiaolong could tell Yang Mingwei held back on the first attack . Otherwise, he couldn\u2019t have pushed back against Yang Mingwei that easily .Yang Mingwei stared at Huang Xiaolong; the earlier contempt disappeared completely and was replaced with a somber expression . The one attack just now knocked him awake and Huang Xiaolong was qualified enough to be his opponent .\u201cOkay, I take back my words . \u201d Yang Mingwei said, \u201cYou are qualified to be my opponent . Huang Xiaolong, I will use all my strength and ability to battle you, and I also hope that you will do the same in this fight!\u201dFinishing his declaration, a brighter and more dazzling light burst out from his body compared to the first time . Behind him, the silhouette of a man emerged\u2013 a gigantic man wearing battle armor sitting in a lotus position in actual .This is Yang Mingwei\u2019s martial spirit!A man!To be more exact, it was an ancient race!Yang Mingwei\u2019s martial spirit was a type of ancient race martial spirit, the Immoveable Bright King Tribe . According to legend, in ancient times, when the Ancient God Clan abandoned many of the other living races and the Immoveable Bright King Race was one of them .It was a race type martial spirit, and in general, race type martial spirits were considered as high grade martial spirits .In fact, Yang Mingwei\u2019s Immoveable Bright King martial spirit was a top grade ten martial spirit .But obviously the fourteen classes\u2019 first place student possesses a top grade ten martial spirit; without such a level of talent, taking first place was an impossible task .Summoning his martial spirit out, a golden ring appeared behind Yang Mingwei and with a flash, a fist shot out at Huang Xiaolong .With the incoming attack, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body blurred away and his fist punched out, meeting the other fist straight on .Battle qi surged causing the space to contort .Once again, Yang Mingwei was pushed back by Huang Xiaolong .Seeing this result, the crowd was shocked .The person who possessed the Immoveable Bright King martial spirit, after calling it out has an unimaginable physical strength and defense, a level higher than another same order warrior . However, Huang Xiaolong still could push Yang Mingwei back: does this mean Huang Xiaolong\u2019s physical body was stronger than Yang Mingwei? Also, even now, Huang Xiaolong has yet to call out his martial spirit .After his attack made Yang Mingwei retreat, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body flashed again, appearing before Yang Mingwei and a palm struck against his chest .\u201cImmoveable Bright King Golden Ring!\u201d At the same time Huang Xiaolong\u2019s palm met Yang \u00a0Mingwei\u2019s chest, a sharp edge flickered across Yang Mingwei\u2019s eyes as the golden ring behind him enveloped his entire body, rotating nonstop to create a defense circle . When Huang Xiaolong hit the golden circle, it felt like his palm hit on an iron wall .\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to penetrate my defense circle!\u201d Yang Mingwei looked at Huang Xiaolong and said, \u201cOnly the Seventh Order and above can break open my golden ring!\u201dImmoveable Bright King Golden Ring!This was the ability of Yang Mingwei\u2019s martial spirit after evolving from breaking through the Fourth Order .Casting the Immoveable Bright King Golden Ring, only an enemy of the Seventh Order or higher can break his defense .\u201cCan\u2019t penetrate your defense?\u201d Huang Xiaolong was indifferent as usual . \u201cNot necessarily!\u201d Then, the palm on Yang Mingwei\u2019s chest suddenly pressed down and a seemingly gentle energy seeped into the golden ring and into Yang Mingwei\u2019s body .Eyes wide in shock, Yang Mingwei trembled and fumbled backward till the end of the stage before coming to a stop . Blood spilled down from the corner of his lips .The crowd was in an uproar seeing this scene .\u201cYou, what kind of battle qi is that, to break through my Immoveable Bright King Golden Ring\u2019s defense!\u201d Yang Mingwei questioned, finding it hard to believe such a thing happened .This was the scary point of the Ethereal Palm; even across walls, the Ethereal Palm\u2019s attack still can reach the other side of a \u2018wall\u2019 no problem .Huang Xiaolong didn\u2019t bother to answer and in a flash, he once again appeared in front of Yang Mingwei and a second palm shot out . Shocked, Yang Mingwei was too late when he thought of dodging; the palm struck the target and Yang Mingwei fell out of the stage .Yang Mingwei lost!Eyes fell on Yang Mingwei and the crowd was unable to react for a long time . Moments later, confusion swept all four directions of the stage \u2013 Yang Mingwei was defeated! Moreover, it looked like Huang Xiaolong won easily without exerting much effort . He didn\u2019t even call out his martial spirit .Note:Bu Dong Ming Wang translated as Immoveable Bright King .

    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 70Chapter 70: Unwilling to Throw in the Towel Without A FightYang Mingwei stood below the stage for a long time, not moving . Not even the commotion amongst the crowd could attract his attention as he stared blankly at the Immoveable Bright King Golden Ring on his body .The Golden Ring that he was extremely confident in was so useless before Huang Xiaolong .Until this moment, he still couldn\u2019t accept this fact .Yang Mingwei\u2019s expression was like the dark, cloudy sky .\u201cThis round, Huang Xiaolong wins!\u201d Yang Mingwei regained his senses when the presiding teacher announced the result . With a complicated face, he looked at Huang Xiaolong and said, \u201cI admit I lost this time; next year\u2019s competition, however, I definitely will defeat you!\u201d\u201cNext year?\u201d Huang Xiaolong repeated the words nonchalantly and shook his head .Base on his cultivation speed, by the end of next year, he probably would have broken through to the Seventh Order . And at that point, he would be advancing to the Second Year Class . So, when next year\u2019s competition is held, if Yang Mingwei remained in the First Year class, he would have no opportunity to battle against Huang Xiaolong .Seeing Huang Xiaolong shake his head, Yang Mingwei misunderstood his meaning, thinking that Huang Xiaolong felt too much disdain to battle him again .\u201cHuang Xiaolong, what do you mean?\u201d Yang Mingwei was angered .Huang Xiaolong turned around and walked down from the stage, \u201cWe\u2019ll talk if you manage to enter the Second Year class next year . \u201dYang Mingwei was stunned by the reply as he stared at Huang Xiaolong\u2019s back .Advance to the Second Year class next year?!Huang Xiaolong\u2019s words meant\u2026? Both of Yang Mingwei\u2019s eyes widened in shock when he realized the meaning behind them .On the guest platform, King Lu Zhe was watching Huang Xiaolong and laughing lightly, he said to Martial Haotian \u201cDidn\u2019t expect Huang Xiaolong to reach this level of strength! Truly out of my expectations . \u201d\u201cYes, this one feels the same,\u201d Marshal Haotian smiled and agreed amiably . He knew Sovereign had broken through to the Sixth Order, but the strength Huang Xiaolong had displayed earlier still surprised him .Initially, he had thought even if Sovereign manages to win, it would be after a difficult and intensive battle, but in reality, it was the opposite .Honestly, the ease which Huang Xiaolong defeated Yang Mingwei also startled Fei Hou a little .Not long after Huang Xiaolong defeated Yang Mingwei, the battle results from the other seven stages with the First Year battles also came in .Since the next round had seven students, an odd number, one of the students was exempted and directly eligible for the next round\u2019s competition . This spot, however, wasn\u2019t determined by drawing sticks but was decided by the Vice-Principal, Xiong Chu .And the one Xiong Chu picked was Lu Kai .Lu Kai was widely recognized by the students and teachers as the Academy First Year's number one person, so there was no objection from the crowd about Xiong Chu\u2019s decision . And like that, Lu Kai proceeded to the next round\u2019s competition smoothly .For next round opponent, Huang Xiaolong drew a number six stick .Number six was First Year Class Six\u2019s Hu Dong, and his strength was weaker compared to the previous Yang Mingwei \u2013 a peak mid-Sixth Order . Thus, there was no suspense to the battle and the same scene repeated itself . Huang Xiaolong defeated Hu Dong effortlessly .Standing below the stage, Lu Kai quietly watched Huang Xiaolong\u2019s and Hu Dong\u2019s battle, his face not showing any of his thoughts .The truth was he was calm on the surface, but in his heart, waves of shock hit him, just like everyone else present .At first, his thoughts were similar to his father\u2019s; Huang Xiaolong wouldn\u2019t have the opportunity to battle against him and would very likely be eliminated halfway through the process . In reality, not even Yang Mingwei is Huang Xiaolong\u2019s opponent .Deep in his heart, Lu Kai felt tangled . Between the many princes in the Luo Tong Kingdom, without a doubt, he possessed the highest talent of all of them; thus, he was most loved by his father . Despite that, the talent that he was so proud of crumbled to nothing when compared to Huang Xiaolong\u2019s .On the other hand,\u00a0Zhong Yuan who was standing behind Lu Kai, his facial expressions became twisted watching Huang Xiaolong defeat Yang Mingwei and Hu Dong like it was nothing .A short while later, the second round of the First Year's competition had ended . Huang Xiaolong and two other students successfully entered into the third competition .Don\u2019t know whether it was done intentionally or not, but the stick Huang Xiaolong drew was number three: a Class Three student called Chen Qiang . Once again, Huang Xiaolong did not meet with Lu Kai .However, Chen Qiang\u2019s strength was recognized by the collective First Years, and he was the number two student after Lu Kai, a peak late-Sixth Order . Like Yang Mingwei, Chen Qiang also possessed a top grade ten beast type martial spirit, the Longarm Water Ape .Although Chen Qiang was much stronger than Yang Mingwei, he ended up losing to Huang Xiaolong like the previous opponents, without releasing his martial spirit even once .Seeing Chen Qiang lose to Huang Xiaolong, the people around the stage were stupefied .In the end, it came down to the final round between Lu Kai and Huang Xiaolong battling for the first place spot amongst the First Year!No one imagined that it would come to this; it would be Huang Xiaolong who would be competition for Lu Kai to grab the title . Prior to this day, the new and older students had talked about this, and everyone agreed at that time that it would be Chen Qiang up on that stage against Lu Kai .But now, it was the new student, Huang Xiaolong, standing there instead .Two people stood on the stage, sizing each other up . Both were quiet and neither spoke .Below the stage, silhouettes tensed up as silence filled the place .Li Lu fixed her stare on Huang Xiaolong and Lu Kai on the stage and her small hands clenched nervously, a layer of thin sweat on her palm .\u201cYou surprised me . \u201d At long last, Lu Kai spoke and cut through the thick silence . \u201cBut, you should realize, you can not win over me! Just give up and throw in the towel!\u201dHearing Lu Kai\u2019s words, Huang Xiaolong calmly retorted, \u201cJust now, Yang Mingwei said the same thing to me . \u201dIn the end, Yang Mingwei lost miserably!Lu Kai heard the hidden meaning of Huang Xiaolong\u2019s words and did not get angry; instead, he smiled faintly saying, \u201cHowever, I\u2019m not Yang Mingwei!\u201d And his battle qi broke out in full force, not holding back . An energy stronger than both Yang Mingwei\u2019s and Chen Qiang\u2019s swept out from Lu Kai\u2019s body .\u201cSeventh Order! Prince Lu Kai really did break through to the Seventh Order!\u201d\u201cBased on Prince Lu Kai\u2019s strength, the First Year competition\u2019s first place is already in his hands . How can Huang Xiaolong win against Prince Lu Kai in this situation?!\u201d\u201cIf it was me seeing Prince Lu Kai\u2019s Seventh Order strength, I would have already raised my hands in surrender! This Huang Xiaolong actually dares to stand on the stage\u2013 too overconfident . Stubborn persistence to save face!\u201dBelow the stage, a flurry of discussions was taking place .Of course, those jealous of Huang Xiaolong couldn\u2019t resist ridiculing Huang Xiaolong, their voices full of sarcasm .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s expression remained the same as those ugly words entered his ears, looking at Lu Kai on the opposite side: Seventh Order? This was within Huang Xiaolong\u2019s expectations so Lu Kai revealing his Seventh Order strength came as no surprise .\u201cHow is it? Do you still want to fight?\u201d Lu Kai looked at Huang Xiaolong .\u201cMake your move . \u201d Huang Xiaolong\u2019s calm voice sounded, unhurried .Lu Kai didn\u2019t expect to get such an answer and was taken aback; knowing that he was a Seventh Order, Huang Xiaolong still dared to fight him? He knew Huang Xiaolong was indeed strong, but he and everyone present can see that he\u2019s just a peak late-Sixth Order .The Seventh Order was a dividing line . \u00a0No matter how strong a Sixth Order warrior is, it\u2019s impossible for them to win against a Seventh Order . This was a well-established fact .Could this Huang Xiaolong want to use his Sixth Order strength to smash this fact?Lu Kai stared at Huang Xiaolong and nodded his head seconds later, \u201cSince you\u2019re unwilling to give up, then I will personally make you . \u201d After he said that, Lu Kai released the martial spirit from his body .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A strong, oppressive aura swept out like a hurricane from where Lu Kai was located in the corner of the stage .\u201cSky Peng!\u201d\u201cPrince Lu Kai\u2019s martial spirit is actually the Sky Peng! Our Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s first King had a martial spirit that was also a Sky Peng!\u201dThe surrounding crowd clamored aloud, greatly shocked when they saw what Lu Kai\u2019s martial spirit was .Including Huang Xiaolong .The Sky Peng was one of the strongest martial spirits amongst the top grade ten martial spirits known .Legend has it, the Sky Peng was from the far off bloodline of the Ancient Sky Dragon . Not only that, Huang Xiaolong noticed Lu Kai\u2019s Sky Peng martial spirit differed from the normal Sky Peng\u2019s features .In legends, the Sky Peng was stated to have two wings, whereas Lu Kai\u2019s Sky Peng martial spirit had four wings! And when the four wings spread out, countless dots of golden lights glowed underneath them . A Sky Peng martial spirit doesn't usually look like this .A variation!This thought flashed across Huang Xiaolong\u2019s mind .It seems Lu Kai\u2019s martial spirit was a variation Sky Peng . The Sky Peng was already a top grade ten martial spirits, and now with its variation properties, it can be classified as a grade eleven superb martial spirit!This was unexpected to Huang Xiaolong that Lu Kai\u2019s martial spirit was a variation of the Sky Peng martial spirit .After calling out his martial spirit, the atmosphere around Lu Kai changed instantly . Sounds of whistling wind could be heard coming from the air around Lu Kai . That\u2019s right, the sound when air moved at rapid speed, and the crowd saw azure-colored winds moving around his body .Nature's wind was something colorless and invisible to the naked eye, but now it can be seen, highlighted in azure .Azure-colored wind!Huang Xiaolong\u2019s expression tightened a little, turning solemn; he knew Lu Kai\u2019s attack would come at him like an angry thunderstorm .\u201cHuang Xiaolong, if you can take this attack from me, then you have the qualification to compete with me for the first place . If you can\u2019t handle even this much, then you are not qualified to fight me for it!\u201d At this time, Lu Kai\u2019s indifferent voice rang out on the stage . Then, his silhouette flashed and disappeared from the spot .So fast!This was the first thing that crossed Huang Xiaolong and the crowd\u2019s mind .Too fast!\u00a0Lu Kai\u2019s speed had reached a certain threshold, leaving only a residue of an azure shadow when he disappeared from the stage . Everything seemed to fall within expectations until Lu Kai\u2019s punch that was about to hit Huang Xiaolong, hit onto an afterimage of him instead\u2013 his body had blurred away, leaving several afterimages on the stage . And Lu Kai\u2019s fist passed through this afterimage that he took as Huang Xiaolong .\u201cEn?\u201d As his confident punch hit onto an empty space, Lu Kai couldn\u2019t help but feel surprised .He himself was a Seventh Order warrior . Moreover, he had summoned his martial spirit; although he did not soul transform, his speed was faster than any average Seventh Order warriors\u2019 speed . But, Huang Xiaolong actually escaped from his attack!\u201cPrince Lu Kai\u2019s attack actually missed!\u201d\u201cWhat skill did Huang Xiaolong use just now? Could it be his martial spirit\u2019s ability?\u201dEven the experts on the honored guest platform, King Lu Zhe, Marshal Haotian, Principal Sun Zhang, and Vice-Principal Xiong Chu were shocked at what transpired on stage . The speed at which Huang Xiaolong dodged Lu Kai\u2019s attack was no slower than Lu Kai\u2019s speed .Yes, just now, Huang Xiaolong used his martial spirit\u2019s ability \u2013 Phantom Shadow!When Huang Xiaolong advanced to the Fourth Order, his martial spirits had undergone their first evolution . The Phantom Shadow ability allowed his speed to increase by a third of his fastest speed . And with his current strength of peak mid-Sixth Order, this ability had gone up a notch to two-thirds more .Not to mention that Huang Xiaolong\u2019s strength was stronger than the average peak late-Sixth Order warrior . Without a doubt, his speed was also faster than average the average same level warriors . Thus, with a two-thirds increase in speed, his speed could very well match Lu Kai .Seeing this his own attack missed, Lu Kai recovered quickly after a short moment of shock and did not rush to attack the second time, \u201cNot bad, you\u2019re a little bit stronger than I imagined . Since you could avoid my first attack, means you have the right to compete for the first place with me . \u201d Up till here, he paused, \u201cBut, merely a qualification . So, be prepare to receive my coming attacks, let\u2019s see how many times you can hide!\u201dLu Kai\u2019s silhouette flickered and disappeared and an azure light flashed passed in the air; appearing in front of Huang Xiaolong many times faster than before . A fist punched out piercing through space, producing an azure-colored wind blade!Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes squinted as he watched the piercing fist get closer . And this time, he had no time to dodge, thus, the only way was to receive the attack . Battle qi inside his body roared, a Luohan Fist flew out to meet with Lu Kai\u2019s fist as the netherworld battle qi rushed out like a flood .\u201cBang!\u201dHuang Xiaolong\u2019s fist collided with Lu Kai\u2019s and both were thrown backward from the force of the impact at the same time . Lu Kai retreated three steps back, and Huang Xiaolong, a total of five steps .\u201cHuh?\u201d When Lu Kai saw Huang Xiaolong actually take his attack head on, yet was uninjured he was surprised .The surrounding people who were watching the battle in all four directions were also astounded .A Seventh Order warrior\u2019s battle qi was a fold higher than a peak late-Sixth Order, yet this Huang Xiaolong could actually resist a frontal attack from Lu Kai!Although Huang Xiaolong retreated an extra two steps back compared to Lu Kai, \u00a0showing that he was slightly weaker, nevertheless, this was enough to shock the crowd .Off the stage, the First Year student that was defeated by Huang Xiaolong earlier -Chen Qiang, was feeling disgruntled over the loss to Huang Xiaolong . Now, seeing that Huang Xiaolong actually could take a direct attack from Lu Kai, his dissatisfaction vanished . He knew, if it was him on the stage, he wouldn\u2019t be able to take that punch!\u201cThis Huang Xiaolong\u2019s physique is unexpectedly strong, and his battle qi grade is so high!\u201d On the main platform, King Lu Zhe commented .Every person sitting on the main platform was an expert . Their eyesight could determine Huang Xiaolong\u2019s physical body was much stronger than the average peak late-Sixth Order warrior . Furthermore, his battle qi grade was quite high; if not, Huang Xiaolong wouldn\u2019t be able to receive the strong punch from Lu Kai and remain unhurt .\u201cJudging from the situation, to win over Huang Xiaolong, Kai\u2019er can only soul transform . \u201d King Lu Zhe subsequently added .\u201cWhat Your Majesty says is correct . \u201d At this time, a Duke that was seated below the main platform quickly agreed . The Duke stood up, smiling as he continued, \u201cAfter the Prince soul transforms, it doesn\u2019t matter how strong that Huang Xiaolong is, it\u2019s impossible for him to win against the Prince!\u201dThe other Dukes immediately showed their support by agreeing .Marshal Haotian listened but didn\u2019t speak\u2013 his eyes were focused on the two figures on the battle stage .At this time, up on the stage, Lu Kai had turned into a ray of constant flickering azure light, appearing in random places on the stage . His flurry of attacks raged like an angry thunderstorm over Huang Xiaolong, but what made everyone watching stupefied was, no matter intense and violent Lu Kai attacked, Huang Xiaolong could successfully take on or dodge each time .Huang Xiaolong looked like he had no power to fight back, but that calm and easygoing attitude made hearts go round with suspicion .After madly attacking over ten times, Lu Kai suddenly stopped . He frowned; by this time, he realized that if he kept attacking this way, it would be almost impossible to defeat Huang Xiaolong in half an hour\u2019s time .\u201cHuang Xiaolong, call out your martial spirit . \u201d Lu Kai said, observing Huang Xiaolong, \u201cIn the next attack, I\u2019m going to soul transform . You won\u2019t be able to deflect or receive my attack at that point!\u201d Like anyone else, Lu Kai was curious about Huang Xiaolong\u2019s martial spirit . \u00a0What kind of martial spirit was it? Could it be like the rumors going around in the Academy, a grade eleven superb martial spirit?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

All of this was just an illusion .At this moment, the space in front of Huang Xiaolong shook violently and a piercing sound of wind rang out . His eyes widened\u2013 this was an overbearing punch and the speed at which it was coming at him was almost breaking space constraints .Unable to dodge the attack in time, Huang Xiaolong immediately used Phantom Shadow, but he was still a step too late . Lu Kai\u2019s speed after soul transforming had broken his earlier limit and his fist already hit Huang Xiaolong\u2019s chest .\u201cBang!\u201d A loud sound resounded and Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body trembled\u2013 his feet staggered back ten steps before coming to a stop on the battle stage . Waves of burning pain erupted in his chest .This was the first time Huang Xiaolong was injured after he came to this world!Lu Kai did not continue to attack after this hit . Instead, his face showed that he was greatly shocked as he looked at Huang Xiaolong . After receiving his head on attack, Huang Xiaolong only retreated ten steps and judging from his appearance, the injury he received was superficial! Huang Xiaolong\u2019s physique defense had reached such a strong degree!Lu Kai was astonished, and so was everyone else around .On the main platform, King Lu Zhe\u2019s eyes flashed and then he grew quiet as if he was contemplating something .As for Li Lu, her heart missed a beat from the fright and a worried expression was fully displayed on her face .\u201cHuang Xiaolong, I\u2019ve said that after I soul transform you wouldn\u2019t be able to stand my attack!\u201d Lu Kai said as he stared at Huang Xiaolong, \u201cHow about it? Still don\u2019t plan to call out your martial spirit?\u201dThe crowd\u2019s attention in all four directions was focused on Huang Xiaolong .Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu were staring closely at Huang Xiaolong; they really wanted to know if Huang Xiaolong possessed a grade eleven superb martial spirit .Feeling the gazes of anticipation from all around the stage, Huang Xiaolong calmly looked at Lu Kai, saying \u201cSince all of you are so curious about my martial spirit, then I should let you see what my martial spirit is!\u201dHearing\u00a0Huang Xiaolong\u2019s words, the surrounding area became silent and their hearts tightened not knowing what to expect .Suddenly, the air behind Huang Xiaolong rippled like water and a black light spread out and loomed over everything . With a flash, a majestic black dragon floated silently behind Huang Xiaolong, giving the impression that it was overlooking all living beings from a high position .A dragon\u2019s terrifying and oppressive aura swept out like a hurricane from the stage .Everyone went into a daze as they stared at the black dragon floating behind . Not moving, not speaking, even forgetting to breath temporarily\u2026Whether it was King Lu Zhe, Sun Zhang, and Xiong Chu on the main platform or Xiong Meiqi and Li Lu close to the battle stage, and even Chen Qiang who was beaten by Huang Xiaolong, everyone was silent .Staring at the black dragon\u2019s four mighty, stout claws, each black dragon scale that looked like shiny black iron, and the imposing eyes, everyone was shocked to the core .On the stage, Lu Kai looked blankly at the black dragon .\u201cThat is a Primordial Divine Dragon!\u201d\u201cAncient Dragon Tribe, a true blood Dragon ah! And this is the elite amongst the Dragon Tribe, the Black Dragon!\u201dA teacher below the stage exclaimed out loud abruptly in a shaky voice .Primordial Divine Dragon!The Black Dragon, an elite amongst the Dragon Tribe!A split second after that, the entire huge hall broke out in an uproar; the crowd was stirred with excitement and admiration, staring at this legendary martial spirit existence as if the one possessing Primordial Divine Black Dragon was themselves instead of Huang Xiaolong!Primordial Divine Dragon martial spirits; the weakest Wind Dragon was said to be an average grade twelve martial spirit . However, the Black Dragon, the elite amongst the Primordial Divine Dragon Tribe was a top grade twelve martial spirit!Top grade twelve!This revelation made Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu jump up from their seats, their bodies trembling uncontrollably from excitement .\u201cIt is actually the Primordial Divine Black Dragon!\u201d Sun Zhang stuttered incoherently, \u201cA top, top grade twelve martial spirit, grade twelve!\u201dTop grade twelve martial spirit, not top grade eleven!If a\u00a0top grade eleven martial spirit was shocking enough, what about the existence of an actual, top grade twelve martial spirit? When Xiong Chu thought of the probability of Huang Xiaolong\u2019s future achievements, his lips trembled like he ate hundred pounds of chilies .In the entire two thousand years of the Duanren Empire\u2019s history talent, Huang Xiaolong definitely can be counted in the top ten!Especially when they noticed Huang Xiaolong\u2019s Black Dragon martial spirit was a variation!All around was shock and excitement, apart from two people \u2013 Fei Hou and Marshal Haotian .\u201cSovereign actually could separately summon the twin dragon spirits?!\u201d They looked stupidly at the singular Black Dragon floating behind Huang Xiaolong . Both of them were aware that Huang Xiaolong possessed twin martial spirits, not only this Black Dragon, but also the Blue Dragon that was stronger and more powerful .Across the crowd, Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou exchanged a look .Because Huang Xiaolong had just returned from training in the Silvermoon Forest, he didn\u2019t have the chance to tell either of them that he could summon his martial spirits individually . So, they only found out at this point of time, together with the rest of the people .Up on the stage, Lu Kai who had been in shock gradually recovered; his eyes had a complicated feeling while looking at Huang Xiaolong and a strong jealousy towards Huang Xiaolong was born in his heart .Jealousy is part of human nature .\u201cI didn\u2019t expect your martial spirit to be a Primordial Divine Black Dragon!\u201d Lu Kai suppressed the jealousy in his heart, and slowly said, \u201cEven so, it can\u2019t change the fact of your upcoming defeat! You should be more careful from now on, I will use the battle skill that I have worked hard to master in recent days, Hundred Saber Cut!\u201d His hand slowly unsheathed the gilded saber that always hung at his waist . When the saber was unsheathed, a clear buzz reverberated in the air .The gilded saber reflected in the light, exuding a cold, chilling feeling . The bloodthirsty eyes of a beast with sharp fangs were carved on the saber\u2019s body .This was the Luo Tong Kingdom treasured ancestral saber, the God Slaughtering Saber!Lifting up the God Slaughtering Saber with both of his hands, Lu Kai slashed at Huang Xiaolong without warning, once again the first to attack .\u201cHundred Cut Saber!\u201dHundred Saber Cut, Earth rank battle skill .Ripples traveled across space as dazzling rays shot out from the saber, crashing out like an angry flood towards Huang Xiaolong, enveloping him .The crowd held their breaths in suspense .Under the crowd\u2019s watchful eyes, no one could tell when the two cold blades, neither too long nor too short, appeared in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s hands . His hands swung out, \u201cTempest of Hell!\u201dHundreds of cold blades light materialized out of nowhere and the air surged at rapidly turning into two cyclones, rotating endlessly . A hellish crying sounded clearly in everyone\u2019s ears, into their mind, and deep into their souls .\u201cZheng, zheng, zheng!\u201d Clashes sounded and the Tempest Of Hell continued to rotate, shattering the saber light from Lu Kai\u2019s Hundred Saber Cut attack .

The crying sound emitted from them made his heart shiver!Fearful, Lu Kai forced himself to move the four wings at his back, open and close . In an instant, his body spun around into an azure tornado, dodging away speedily .Still, it was a step too late .The two cyclones covered Lu Kai, clashing violently against the azure tornado .\u201cBoom!\u201d a loud blast resounded .The azure tornado dimmed and its speed slowed, revealing Lu Kai\u2019s body and his frightened eyes .In the end, the azure tornado shattered away as the Tempest of Hell continued onwards; Lu Kai stumbled back again and again until he reached the edge of the battle stage . Tempest of Hell came right before him and dissipated .Seeing the two cyclones finally dissipated just inches in front of him, it was as if his pores relaxed and cold sweat soaked back his back, dampening his robe .Just now, he felt death\u2019s breath .Death actually came so close to him!Lu Kai panted heavily; looking at his right hand, he saw that the right half of his robe sleeve was shredded into pieces by Huang Xiaolong\u2019s attack . Cuts on his flesh had blood flowing out and fortunately, this was considered a superficial injury, not as traumatic as it could have been .When his fright had passed, his complex gaze focused towards Huang Xiaolong . He knew that if it wasn\u2019t for Huang Xiaolong\u2019s mercy, most likely his right hand would be crippled by now!\u201cI lost!\u201d Lu Kai breathed out and said to Huang Xiaolong . When the words came out, Lu Kai nearly stumbled down from the stage, looking like all of his energy was exhausted and overdrawn .A commotion swept through the crowd in all directions of the stage .Prince Lu Kai took the initiative to admit defeat! Voluntarily surrendering!Someone who had broken through the Seventh Order, possessing a variation Sky Peng martial spirit, who in the end, lost to a peak mid-Sixth Order Huang Xiaolong!In the Martial Spirit World, the myth a Sixth Order could never win over a Seventh Order was broken by Huang Xiaolong!Everyone was caught in unbelievable and inconceivable shock .Whereas up on the honored guest's main platform, each was immersed in their own thoughts .King Lu Zhe sighed, \u201cI did not expect even Kai\u2019er is not Huang Xiaolong\u2019s opponent . \u201d Then, he turned to look at Marshal Haotian with a gratified expression, laughed, and said \u201cEven more surprising is this Huang Xiaolong\u2019s martial spirit\u2013 it\u2019s actually a Primordial Divine Dragon, the Black Dragon . I look forward to his achievement after winning the Academy\u2019s First Year competition and his journey to the Duanren Empire for the Imperial City Battle ah!\u201dWhat Lu Zhe said was heartfelt words; he was indeed looking forward to Huang Xiaolong\u2019s performance in the Imperial City Battle in the Duanren Empire . If he could get into the top ten places, not only is it the Academy\u2019s glory, it would also be the Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s glory!Marshal Haotian also laughed agreeably and said: \u201cThis one\u2019s wish is the same . \u201d Marshal Haotian held the same anticipation because he knew it wouldn\u2019t be just the Cosmic Star Academy and the Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s glory, but it would also be the Asura\u2019s Gate honor and glory!And with Huang Xiaolong participating in the Duanren Empire\u2019s Imperial City Battle, it would be the starting point of rebuilding the Asura\u2019s Gate glory once more .After that, there was the battle between empires!A long time later, Sun Zhang finally managed to calm down and he stood up . However, excitement and complicated feelings were still obvious on his face as he looked at Huang Xiaolong on the stage, saying \u201cThis battle, Huang Xiaolong wins! The First Year champion is Huang Xiaolong!\u201dThe First Year champion, Huang Xiaolong!When the crowd heard Sun Zhang announced the result, the Holy Hall broke out in a frenzy .Li Lu laughed, Fei Hou laughed, and Marshal Haotian also laughed, not excluding the guards from the Marshal Mansion!The atmosphere in the huge hall boiled up; Zhong Yuan, who was standing amongst the crowd, turned pale white and his eyes were filled with hate and fear as he stared fixedly at Huang Xiaolong on the stage .Huang Xiaolong won! He got the first place in the First Year competition, then his bet with Huang Xiaolong\u2026?Zhong Yuan felt only bleak darkness before him .Hearing Sun Zhang announced the result, Huang Xiaolong secretly breathed out in relief .After a series of \u2018difficult\u2019 battles, he finally achieved his aim, to become the First Year champion!Soon after that, the Second Year and Third Year classes also announced their winners, and the overall winner was somebody called Chen Cheng, from the inner court of Cosmic Star Academy; his strength had reached peak late-Tenth Order . Two months later, he would be heading to the Duanren Empire as Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s representative for this round of the Imperial City Battle .The inner court of Cosmic Star Academy consisted of talented students selected from the Third Years and every year, the number of students there was capped at ten people .After the total results were collected, it was time for King Lu Zhe and Sun Zhang to give out the rewards to Huang Xiaolong and the three other winners .While giving out the rewards to Huang Xiaolong, it was inevitable that King Lu Zhe and Sun Zhang would speak words of encouragement .Looking at the rewards in his hands, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s heart bounced a little with excitement .One million gold coins!One low-grade Earth rank cultivation technique and battle skill!Most importantly, the high Grade Four Spirit Dan, Xingyao Dan!With this Xingyao Dan, coupled with the cycad fruits he found in the Silvermoon Forest, his father, Huang Peng, can advance another order! Of course, Huang Xiaolong wouldn\u2019t swallow this Xingyao Dan himself; he had intended to give it to his Huang Peng all along .With the end of the competition, after some days, he could return to the Huang Clan Manor .After the rewards were given out, the crowd dispersed and walked away .But, after most of the people had dispersed, Lu Kai came up to Huang Xiaolong and said, \u201cI hope that next year we would have a chance to battle again!\u201dNext year?\u00a0Huang Xiaolong nodded .Next year, both of them would enter the Second Year class .When the Holy Hall emptied out, Huang Xiaolong brought Fei Hou and the four Marshal Mansion guards and Li Lu out from the Academy back to Tianxuan Mansion .Once back to Tianxuan Mansion, Li Lu chattered happily while hanging onto Huang Xiaolong\u2019s arm about how cool he looked when he defeated Lu Kai, Chen Qiang, and the rest on the battle stage .Looking at Li Lu chattering happily, he could only go with the flow and let Li Lu tweet away for more than an hour before she was satisfied .More than an hour later, Li Lu finally left Tianxuan Mansion .After Li Lu had left, Huang Xiaolong called for Fei Hou and he took out the reward of one million gold coins and tasked Fei Hou with buying the neighboring courtyards around Tianxuan Mansion . The number of slaves had increased, making Tianxuan Mansion feel slightly crowded .\u201cBuy up the neighboring \u00a0courtyards?\u201d Looking at the pile of one million gold coins in front of him, he nodded his head, saying \u201cYes, rest assured Sovereign, this subordinate will go and handle this matter right away!\u201dAs long as there were enough gold coins, he believed the owners would sell their places . Also, Fei Hou heard some of the courtyards close to Tianxuan Mansion belonged to the Generals under Senior Brother Haotian; it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to convince them to sell .When Fei Hou left, Huang Xiaolong returned to his room and started practicing the Asura Tactics .According to previous years\u2019 rule, the next day after the competition, the winners of each class and year competition were to gather at the Academy square and they would be guided by Principal Sun Zhang and Vice-Principal Xiong Chu to the treasure land, Dragon Flame Valley to cultivate .When Huang Xiaolong remembered Marshal Haotian\u2019s explanation that Dragon Flame Valley could refine the physique and improve the quality of battle qi, he couldn\u2019t help but look forward to it .Since he cultivated the Asura Tactics, his referred to his battle qi that was laced with the netherworld spiritual aura as \u2018netherworld battle qi\u2019 . The quality of the netherworld battle qi can be considered as high amongst others; if he could further enhance it, one doesn\u2019t know what extent it can reach?The darkness of the night gradually dispersed as sunlight streamed out in the morning sky .Huang Xiaolong withdrew from his practice and came out from his room, feeling good . The tiredness from yesterday\u2019s battles vanished completely .\u201cSovereign, there\u2019s good news!\u201d Just when Huang Xiaolong walked into the main hall, Fei Hou ran in excitedly and spurted out, \u201cSenior Brother got in touch with Master, and he reported about Sovereign to Master . Master is very happy and is rushing over to the Luo Tong Kingdom as fast as he can!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had already waited for two years, another ten days of waiting matter not to him .Yu Ming would arrive ten days later, and at that time, Huang Xiaolong could get the information about the Asura\u2019s Gate headquarters location from him!However, Huang Xiaolong will be cultivating in Dragon Flame Valley for half a month . He would only come out after half a month\u2019s time after entering there . Therefore, when Yu Ming arrived, he would have to trouble him to wait a few days until he comes out from the Dragon Flame Valley .After a while, Huang Xiaolong came to the Academy\u2019s square with Fei Hou; most of the class winners were already waiting there . Huang Xiaolong\u2019s presence naturally attracted their attention, causing all the students to look at him .Maybe Huang Xiaolong didn\u2019t recognize these students, but no doubt, they recognized him .Yesterday, during the Academy competition, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s performance was the most dazzling and eye-catching of all; it even curtailed the overall Academy number one, Chen Cheng\u2019s limelight .Top grade twelve martial spirit!Huang Xiaolong was forever engraved into Duanren Empire\u2019s history, not to mention the Luo Tong Kingdom!In the midst of the student group, stood Lu Kai who lost to Huang Xiaolong and he had a complicated expression on his face as he looked at the young man smaller than him . Lu Kai was one of the fourteen First Year class winners, eligible to enter and practice in the Dragon Flame Valley .Yesterday, after the competition ended, Principal Sun Zhang and Vice-Principal Xiong Chu gave Zhong Yuan his notice, emphasizing that he doesn't need to come to Cosmic Star Academy anymore . \u00a0Don\u2019t come anymore!\u00a0Zhong Yuan was expelled, and after being expelled, Zhong Yuan ran to his (Lu Kai\u2019s mother) sister and \u2018cried\u2019 for a very long time .Moments later, Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu appeared on the square .When the two of them arrived, they glanced around the group of students and their eyes lit up brightly like the stars when they spotted Huang Xiaolong . Their demeanor changed in the blink of an eye; the students actually saw Principal Sun Zhang and Vice-Principal Xiong Chu\u2019s mouths bloom into a smile that contained traces of the desire to please Huang Xiaolong, even nodding their heads .Seeing this scene, the group of students felt envy and jealousy, including the overall Academy champion, Chen Cheng . Even he had never enjoyed such treatment .And\u00a0then, Sun Zhang opened his mouth and asked, \u201cXiaolong, did you sleep well last night?\u201dDid you sleep well last night?\u00a0Everyone felt like fainting .Even Huang Xiaolong was startled at the \u2018caring\u2019 question .\u201cIt was okay . \u201d Huang Xiaolong nodded and said .At this time, Xiong Chu also said to Huang Xiaolong with a grin on his face, \u201cYou\u2019re still a growing boy, you should eat and sleep well . \u201dGrowing boy? Eat and sleep well!When the students heard this, they become even more speechless looking at Huang Xiaolong; if envy and jealousy could condense into a solid form, it would flow out from their eyes like water .\u201cOkay, since everyone is gathered, we will now bring all of you into the Dragon Flame Valley . \u201d Sun Zhang opened his mouth and said . His expression turned serious continued, \u201cRemember, after going into the Dragon Flame Valley, don\u2019t run around arbitrarily!\u201dDon\u2019t run around arbitrarily? Huang Xiaolong\u2019s curious heart was stoked\u2013 was there any unknown danger in Dragon Flame Valley?Then, Huang Xiaolong, Lu Kai, and the rest of the students followed Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu and walked away from the square, heading towards the mountain behind the Academy . The Dragon Flame Valley was located in the Academy\u2019s back mountain .Half an hour later, Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu brought the students to a valley .In front of the valley, stood a ten meters high boulder; on the top part of the boulder, written in the ancient language, were three words: Dragon Flame Valley!\u201cI\u2019m going to warn you again, one more time, after we enter the Dragon Flame Valley, no one is allowed to act rampantly!\u201d Standing before the boulder that was the entrance into the valley, Sun Zhang reminded Huang Xiaolong and the rest of the students .Heads nodded in obedience .Only after seeing this did Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu guide them into the Dragon Flame Valley .Not sure if it was a misperception, but the moment he stepped into the Dragon Flame Valley, his twin dragon martial spirits actually moved for a second . It was only for a second, and then they stayed still like nothing happened .Thus Huang Xiaolong didn\u2019t think too much about it, moving forward with the rest of the students .As they moved deeper into the Dragon Flame Valley, the surrounding temperature grew hotter; towards the end, Huang Xiaolong felt a prickling pain on his skin due to the high heat .About fifteen minutes or so passed and Sun Zhang, Xiong Chu, Huang Xiaolong and the others came to a stop before a huge mouth to a cave . When they entered, an effusion of extremely hot heat blew against them .About\u00a0six to seven meters inside the cave, the two sides of the wall were smooth and flat . Every five meters, a bright stone was inlaid on the left and right side of the cave wall, lighting up the path .Roughly one hundred meters in, they came before a stone door that was opened by Sun Zhang, revealing a ten square meter stone chamber within . In the middle of the stone chamber, was a five-pointed star array formation and nothing else inside the chamber .\u201cZhang Yue, you go in!\u201d Sun Zhang said .Zhang Yue was the First Year Class One winner .Following Sun Zhang\u2019s instructions, Zhang Yue went in and sat down in the middle of the five-pointed star array formation .Then, Sun Zhang brought the remaining students deeper inside the cave .Before every stone doors they came across, either Sun Zhang or Xiong Chu would open the door and one of the students would be instructed to go inside .Soon, other than Huang Xiaolong, all the First Year winners already entered into a stone chamber . Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu came to a flight of stone stairs and they led the remaining students down to the second level of the cave .On the lower second level floor, it contained many stone doors just like the floor above and the Second Year class winners were arranged to practice here .Next, they went another level down where the Third Year class winners entered into their individual stone chambers .Lastly, the remaining people were the First, Second, Third and overall first place winners . Huang Xiaolong\u2019s group of four were arranged into stone chambers at the ground level .Prior to entering the Dragon Flame Valley, Sun Zhang briefly explained the logistics of the stone chambers to Huang Xiaolong and the students: the closer the stone chamber was to the vein, the higher and stronger the amount and purity of the dragon flame qi one can absorb through the array formation . Thus, cultivating in the lower levels would bring greater effect and furthermore, the four people on the fourth level can stay for half a month or fifteen days, but the students cultivating on the first, second and third level were only allowed five days\u2019 time .This was the biggest advantage of winning the year category competition .The stone door closed after Huang Xiaolong walked in, and he stepped into the middle of the five-pointed star-like array formation and sat in a lotus position . The array formation glowed brightly as he started to run the Asura Tactics; in the next moment, the twin dragon martial spirits in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body suddenly flew out, floating in the stone chamber and a dragon\u2019s roar echoed in the chamber .\u201cThis, what is happening? Huang Xiaolong was flabbergasted .The twin dragon martial spirits were out of his control, flying out from his body by themselves . This kind of situation was a first for Huang Xiaolong .At the same time, strong streams of fire qi flooded into the room from the ground below through the array formation, turning into many minuscule fire dragons filling up the stone chamber in the span of a few breaths .It was as if Huang Xiaolong was sitting in a sea of fire . Then, the twin dragons opened their mouths and devoured these small fire dragons and Huang Xiaolong felt them enter into his body and he started to heat up .As his martial spirits continued to swallow the endless fire qi, it coursed along Huang Xiaolong\u2019s meridians, flesh, bones, and everywhere else in his body and his battle qi surged within his meridians at the same time .However, what happened next made Huang Xiaolong even more surprised . The twin dragons actually drilled into the ground as if there was something there that attracted them to go beneath the Dragon Flame Valley .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

More and more hot air spewed out from underground, and because Huang Xiaolong and the twin dragons were in truth one entity, what they see, he could also see just the same .More than a dozen meters below, the earth underneath was a burning red in color, akin to magma .The twin dragons continued to drill down deeper, seventy meters, eighty meters, ninety meters, one hundred meters deep!When it was over a hundred meters down, the surrounding soil was a deep red, as if cooked by the fire . The temperature nearly reached a thousand degrees Fahrenheit; at such a temperature, even a Xiantian expert would turn into ashes .But, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s twin dragon martial spirits were unaffected!Nearing two hundred meters deep, suddenly, the twin dragons came upon an open space . There was a surging sea of fire and below it was bubbling magma; the small fire dragons ballooned in size, becoming several meters thick fire dragons!Extreme pure fire qi rolled and surged like angry waves in the sea of fire .From the magma below, qi gathered, turning into a huge flame dragon vein .Is this the natural dragon vein below the Dragon Flame Valley?And suspended above the bubbling magma was a pagoda!Golden lights flickered out from the pagoda while there were several more than one meter thick fire dragons circled around it . Moreover, Huang Xiaolong noticed that the pagoda was constantly emitting fire dragon qi!Huang Xiaolong was stunned;\u00a0could all the fire qi in this Dragon Flame Valley originate out from this pagoda? Could the formation of the natural magma vein below also have been created by the pagoda?What is this pagoda?At this time, the twin dragons above the sea of fire roared with excitement and one black and one blue dragon swam towards the pagoda, encircling it .The twin dragons spun endlessly around the pagoda and the pagoda shone brightly and shook with vigor .The fire dragons around the pagoda shot towards the blue and black dragon as if they had wisdom, wanting to swallow Huang Xiaolong\u2019s twin dragon martial spirits . However, just when these fire dragons got close to them, the black and blue dragon stretched their jaws and devoured all the fire dragons cleanly .The twin dragons didn\u2019t stop after devouring the fire dragons that attacked them; they continued onto other fire dragons and one after another, fire dragons of various sizes went into the black and blue dragon\u2019s stomach .These thick fire qi dragons took more ten years to reach this size and their purity was ten times higher than what Huang Xiaolong could absorb through the five-pointed star array formation in the stone chamber, maybe even higher than that .A short while later, the fire dragons above the sea of fire were swallowed into the black and blue dragon\u2019s stomach till none were left .And after devouring these fire qi dragons, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s twin dragon martial spirits nearly doubled in size; the scales on both of their bodies became even more compact, shinier and their stout claws grew sturdier .On the surface, the black and blue dragons looked like they were layered with a fiery red glow, rippling along the scales of their body, and the dragons\u2019 natural oppressive aura multiplied .When all the fire qi dragons were gone, the black and blue dragons once again circled the pagoda .But, around the pagoda was an invisible barrier of fire qi, blocking the black and blue dragons a few meters away, unable to get closer to it .Even so, every time the black and blue dragon spun around it, the fire qi barrier would become a little thinner . One hour later, the fire qi barrier disappeared completely .Then, the black and blue dragon wrapped the pagoda with their bodies and headed back towards the stone chamber Huang Xiaolong was in .In just moments, both the black and the blue dragon reached the stone chamber .The pagoda floated above Huang Xiaolong\u2019s head . Instantly, strong pure flames broke out from the pagoda, rushing into Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body shook abruptly as if he fell into a pool of magma; his organs felt like they were being boiled in scorching lava, causing anguishing pain . This type of pain from extreme temperatures almost made Huang Xiaolong lose his consciousness, scaring him so much that he quickly ran the Asura\u2019s Tactics to refine these violent fire dragon qi so he can absorb them .One stream of fire qi after another caused Huang Xiaolong\u2019s face to distort due to the excruciating pain .He kept refining the fire qi that entered his body, but the pagoda kept spewing out an endless stream of fire qi that it even made Huang Xiaolong hallucinate that he was being roasted inside out .As Huang Xiaolong continued to refine the fire qi inside his body, on the surface of his skin were traces of black impurities mixed with blood that oozed out from his pores . Years ago, when Huang Xiaolong ate the Yang Fruit, it cleansed his marrows and at that time, black impurities also came out from his body . Now, however, the amount was significantly higher and it was mixed with blood; soon, these blood mixed impurities turned into a layer of hard scab as if imprisoning him inside .From afar, Huang Xiaolong looked like someone who fell into a pool of blood .After a little more than\u00a0an hour, relying on the continuous usage of the Asura Tactics, Huang Xiaolong could feel the pain gradually subside, and after another two hours, the pure fire qi spewing out from the pagoda gave Huang Xiaolong a warm, comfortable feeling instead of the unbearable pain it had in the beginning .Every time the pagoda spewed out fire qi, Huang Xiaolong detected the changes inside his body, that his internal organs were becoming stronger .During the entire time, the black and blue dragons were wrapped around the pagoda, swallowing the fire qi that came out from it .While Huang Xiaolong\u2019s twin dragon martial spirits \u2018abducted\u2019 the pagoda into the stone chamber he was in, the rest of the students who were cultivating in the other stone chambers such as Lu Kai and Chen Cheng, felt the fire qi from the array formation had weakened slightly . Although, they felt weird, none of them thought too much of it .Three days passed quickly .The surface of Huang Xiaolong\u2019s skin hardened with layers of blood mixed with impurities and it slowly glowed a fiery red color; then, it melted piece by piece and fell to the floor . At this time, more impurities were pushed out from his body once again, creating a new layer on the surface of his skin .Another three days came and went, these layers of impurities melted, fell, and emerged once again, repeating itself .Like this, after three rounds, there were no longer any impurities mixed with blood coming out from Huang Xiaolong\u2019s pores; the surface of his skin looked as white as snow with a glow to his entire body .Inside-out, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body had undergone tremendous changes .Not only his skin and body, but even his temperament and aura was not the same .When the time limit of fifteen days came, Huang Xiaolong had advanced to peak late Sixth Order from peak mid-Sixth order\u2013 less than half a step he could break through to the Seventh Order Warrior!After the fifteenth day, Huang Xiaolong recalled his twin dragon martial spirits back into his body and that pagoda actually followed into his body as well!Inside his body, the pagoda continued to spew out fire qi, tempering his body nonstop . This discovery made Huang Xiaolong very happy; in this case, doesn\u2019t that mean the fire qi will continue to strengthen his physique every second of the day?In the long run, to what extent would his physical strength and defense improve? Not only that, his meridians and battle qi can be enhanced infinitely\u2013 what extent can they reach?Huang Xiaolong took a deep breath to calm himself down .Suppressing the excitement in his heart, he walked out from the stone chamber seconds later . The other three people also came out from their respective stone chambers where Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu were already waiting for them .Seeing the four students come out, Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu\u2019s gaze could not help but fall on Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body; and the finding made their eyes widened in shock .________________________________________________________________Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It had only been fifteen days inside the stone chamber, yet Huang Xiaolong actually grew a head taller! His skin, his temperament, and his aura had changed drastically .If they were in a different place, without careful observation, they truly would not be able to recognize Huang Xiaolong .In fact, when Chen Cheng and the other two students came out from their stone chambers, they really did not recognize Huang Xiaolong .Looking at Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu\u2019s reaction, Huang Xiaolong felt helpless about it and could only nod his head in affirmation .\u201cXiaolong, ar-, are you alright?\u201d Sun Zhang came up beside him and asked, full of concern . Such drastic changes in fifteen days, hopefully, there isn\u2019t anything wrong . Nowadays, Huang Xiaolong was considered to be the Academy and the Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s darling .\u201cMe? What could happen to me?\u201d Huang Xiaolong smiled helplessly; at the moment, his body was at its best condition . He could probably even kill a Grade Seven demonic beast with a single punch .\u201cThen all is good . \u201d Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu secretly breathed out in relief .With the cultivation time ended, the two of them brought Huang Xiaolong and the other three students out of Dragon Flame Valley; Lu Kai and the rest had left ten days earlier .Coming out of the Dragon Flame Valley, the group of six soon arrived at the Academy\u2019s square .Chen Cheng, Huang Xiaolong, and the other two bid farewell to Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu, but when Huang Xiaolong turned around wanting to leave, Sun Zhang called out, \u201cXiaolong, stay for a moment, I have something to say to you . \u2019\u2019Huang Xiaolong paused for a second and turned back, and he looked at Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu both .A look was exchanged between Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu; subsequently, Sun Zhang took out a small bottle and stated, \u201cThis is a high Grade Five Spirit Dan, take it!\u201d\u201cFive, high Grade Five Spirit Dan!\u201d Huang Xiaolong was taken aback, then his eyes lit up .The Academy overall champion, Chen Cheng was rewarded with one high Grade Five Spirit Dan; even to the Academy, Grade Five Spirit Dans are hard to come by .But, Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu actually gave him one?!Xiong Chu chuckled, saying \u201cThat\u2019s right, this is a top Grade Five Spirit Dan . Consider it as our personal gift to you . Xiaolong, practice hard . \u00a0Both of us hope you can advance to the Seventh Order soon . \u201dHuang Xiaolong took the bottle, feeling delighted in his heart . A high Grade Five Spirit Dan ah! With this, his mother\u2019s strength can enhance another level!As for himself, he doesn\u2019t need it .On Huang Xiaolong\u2019s face was an expression of gratefulness to Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu, and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will practice hard and seize the time to break through to the Seventh Order as soon as possible . \u201dHearing this, Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu\u2019s face bloomed .Sun Zhang smilingly said, \u201cWith that high Grade Four Spirit Dan you have along with this one, and your talent, we believe within half a year\u2019s time you can advance to the peak late-Sixth Order; and in one year, you definitely can break through to the Seventh Order!\u201dIf these two people knew Huang Xiaolong wanted to gift the First Year champion\u2019s reward \u2013 the high Grade Four Spirit Dan, and this high Grade Five Spirit Dan to his parents, what would they think?Of course, even without these two pills, \u00a0Huang Xiaolong estimated that he would break through within half a year\u2019s time .A short moment later, Huang Xiaolong left the Academy, returning to the Tianxuan Mansion .When he reached Tianxuan Mansion\u2019s entrance, Fei Hou, Marshal Haotian, and a middle-aged man were waiting at the Tianxuan Mansion main door . This unknown middle-aged man has sharp-edged eyebrows and deep unfathomable eyes, and faint streaks of gray hair on his temple . He stood there like a sword ready to fly out from its sheath anytime, able to flip the earth over . Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou who stood a step behind him, nearly faded into the background .Seeing this middle-aged man, Huang Xiaolong could already guess his identity .Asura\u2019s Gate Elder, Yu Ming!When Huang Xiaolong appeared, the middle-aged man looked over, his eyes sharp like a knife, giving an invisible oppressive aura, making it difficult to breathe with the pressure he exuded .\u201cSovereign!\u201d Joy was obvious on Fei Hou\u2019s and Marshal Haotian\u2019s faces when they saw Huang Xiaolong, they hurried to introduce Huang Xiaolong to the middle-aged man: \u201cMaster, that is the Sovereign; Sovereign is back!\u201dYu Ming\u2019s gaze inevitably fell on Huang Xiaolong\u2019s left ring finger where the Asura Ring was . Suddenly, he trembled excitedly, and all his tyrannical aura disappeared in an instant as he strode towards Huang Xiaolong and bowed down in salute, \u201cAsura\u2019s Gate Elder Yu Ming greet the Sovereign . Sovereign invincible throughout!\u201dSeeing their Master like this, Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou quickly followed suit .\u201cQuick, please stand . \u201d Huang Xiaolong stepped up and helped the three of them up .After the three stood up, Huang Xiaolong spoke: \u201cLet\u2019s go in and talk . \u201dMinutes later, the four came to the main hall, and Huang Xiaolong waved away the Marshal Mansion guards and Boli\u2019s group of slaves .\u201cI heard from Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou, you went to the Mohe Kingdom to do something?\u201d After everyone took a seat, Huang Xiaolong asked Yu Ming .\u201cIt is so, Sovereign . \u201d Yu Ming quickly stood up and answered respectfully, \u2018Three years ago, this Subordinate was searching for Life and Death Grass for alchemy and I heard that the Mohe Kingdom has them, so Subordinate had rushed over there . \u201dHuang Xiaolong nodded, thought for a moment and said, \u201cActually, the main purpose I asked Haotian and Fei Hou to contact you was to inquire about the Asura\u2019s Gate current situation and the headquarters\u2019 location . \u201d\u201cAsura\u2019s Gate headquarters location?\u201d Yu Ming spoke in a somber voice, \u201cIn fact, the Asura\u2019s Gate headquarters is not on the Snow Wind Continent . \u201d\u201cWhat? Not on Snow Wind Continent?!\u201d Huang Xiaolong was greatly\u00a0surprised; he turned to look at Fei Hou and Haotian and found that both of them had the same surprise look on their faces . Apparently, both of them never thought of the possibility that the Asura\u2019s Gate headquarters wasn\u2019t located on the same continent .\u201cThat\u2019s right, Sovereign . \u201d Yu Ming continued to elaborate, \u201cOur headquarters is built on the Star Cloud Continent . \u201d\u201cStar Cloud Continent!\u201d Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes opened wide .In this Martial Spirit World,\u00a0wasn\u2019t there just Snow Wind Continent? Could there be many different continents?\u00a0Martial Haotian and Fei Hou had never mentioned this to him before .\u201cIn this Martial Spirit Word, there are other continents other than the Snow Wind Continent?\u201d Huang Xiaolong took the opportunity to clarify .Yu Ming nodded his head, \u201cYes, Sovereign . In Martial Spirit World, there are three continents \u00a0-Snow Wind Continent, Star Cloud Continent, and Shifang Continent . Star Cloud and Shifang Continent are many times larger than Snow Wind Continent . \u00a0Our Asura\u2019s Gate headquarters is in the center of Star Cloud Continent, in a place called Zhongzhou, on the peak of the Heavenly Sky Phoenix Mountain!\u201dStar Cloud Continent, Zhongzhou, on the peak of the Heavenly Phoenix Mountain!Huang Xiaolong repeated once to himself .\u201cSovereign wants to go to the headquarters?\u201d At this time, Yu Ming\u2019s brown scrunched together tightly and ventured: \u201cIf Sovereign plan to go to Asura\u2019s Gate headquarters, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d\u201cAfraid what?\u201d Huang Xiaolong pursued .\u201cI\u2019m afraid it would be risky . \u201d Yu Ming said, \u201cFifty years ago, Old Sovereign disappeared suddenly . Main Chief Chen Tianqi had always wanted to take control of the Asura\u2019s Gate and step into the Sovereign position . But, Zhao Shu, the Left Deputy, and Zhang Fu, the Right Deputy, and many Elders opposed the idea . So, the Asura\u2019s Gate is divided into two factions because of this . \u201d\u201cMain Chief Chen Tianqi?\u201d Huang Xiaolong looked at Yu Ming, full of doubt .\u201cBelow the Sovereign, there is the Main Chief, Left and Right Deputy; and after them, there are Section Chiefs and Elders . \u201d Yu Ming explained: \u201cIn truth, Main Chief Chen Tianqi is Sovereign\u2019s Senior Brother!\u201d\u201cMy Senior Brother!\u201d Huang Xiaolong was astounded by this piece of information .Yu Ming nodded and continued \u201cMain Chief Chen Tianqi is the disciple that Old Sovereign received about two hundred years ago . These years, he had continued to search for news of the Old Sovereign . If Sovereign wants to go to the headquarters and is made known to Main Chief Chen Tianqi, he will surely attempt to assassinate you to snatch the Asura Ring so that he could take over the Sovereign\u2019s position with justification!\u201dNote:Shi Fang \u2013 lit . ten side/directions .

In the current situation, the Asura\u2019s Gate was divided into two factions; one side led by Chen Tianqi who wants to take over the sect and be the Sovereign, while the other is led by the Left and Right Deputy, Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu . Most of the Elders agreed and sided with Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu \u2013 only the person possessing the Asura Ring can replace the Old Sovereign, just like Yu Ming and his disciples, Haotian and Fei Hou .The was no question of Yu Ming and this faction\u2019s loyalty . Otherwise, when Yu Ming, Haotian, and Fei Hou found out he possessed the Asura Ring, they would have snatched it from him without a second thought .If Chen Tianqi\u2019s faction was made aware of his existence and the fact that the Asura Ring was in his hands, even if he was far away in the Snow Wind Continent, in this small \u2018sesame seed\u2019 Luo Tong Kingdom, he would fall into a dangerous position!At this time, Yu Ming\u2019s voice sounded again, \u201cIf Main Chief Chen Tianqi knew about Sovereign and the Asura Ring, he would definitely send people to kill Sovereign . Chances are, he might even come over himself . \u201dHuang Xiaolong\u2019s voice sounded somber as he asked, \u201cThis Chen Tianqi, how strong is his strength?\u201dYu Ming shook his head, saying \u201cSubordinate is not very clear about this . In the last decade, no one has seen Main Chief Chen Tianqi reveal his true strength; however, during the time when the Old Sovereign left, Main Chief Chen Tianqi\u2019s strength has already reached Fifth Order Saint Realm . \u201d\u201cFifth Order Saint!\u201d Huang Xiaolong\u2019s heart missed a beat hearing that; it meant that more than a decade ago, this Chen Tianqi was already a Fifth Order Saint Realm Warrior!At this moment, Huang Xiaolong truly felt his strength was still too weak . Although compared to peers his age, his talent and progress can be considered as heaven-defying, against those Xiantian and Saint realm warriors, his measly strength was insignificant . Relying on Chen Tianqi\u2019s Fifth Order Saint strength, to extinguish himself, Chen Tianqi could do it without even moving his pinky .Again, Yu Ming continued to speak, interrupting Huang Xiaolong\u2019s thoughts, \u201cMain Chief Chen Tianqi\u2019s talent is very high, possessing a top grade thirteen martial spirit, a Twelve Wings Angel . Moreover, his angel martial spirit has the strongest battle power, the War Angel!\u201dA top grade thirteen martial spirit,\u00a0the Twelve Wings Angel!Possessing the strongest battle power,\u00a0the War Angel!Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes narrowed in a pensive manner .But, this was not surprising to Huang Xiaolong because only those possessing top superb martial spirits could withstand the netherworld Hell\u2019s slaughter intent and practice the Asura Tactics thereby becoming Ren Wo Kuang\u2019s disciple .If this was the case, then apart from Huang Xiaolong and Ren Wo Kuang, in this world there is another person that practiced the Asura Tactics \u2013 Chen Tianqi .Of course, judging from what Yu Ming said, although Chen Tianqi practiced Asura Tactics like him, he did not have the Blades of Asura . Thus, Huang Xiaolong was sure Chen Tianqi has no cultivation knowledge of the Asura Sword Skills and the Asura Demon Claw; furthermore, according to what was written on the illustrations, only the Asura\u2019s Gate Sovereign could practice them . Clearly, Chen Tianqi did not learn any of them .Between this piece of heaven and earth, there was only Huang Xiaolong and Ren Wo Kuang who practiced the Asura Sword Skill and the Asura Demon Claw .\u201cMaster, in fact, Sovereign\u2019s talent is no worse than Main Chief Chen Tianqi!\u2019\u2019 At this time, Fei Hou hastened to say to Yu Ming .Prior, without Huang Xiaolong\u2019s permission, Fei Hou and Marshal Haotian dared not reveal anything about his martial spirit to their Master Yu Ming while he was cultivating in the Dragon Flame Valley . So, until this moment, Yu Ming didn\u2019t know about Huang Xiaolong\u2019s superb twin martial spirits .Hearing Fei Hou speak, Yu Ming quickly turned to Huang Xiaolong, an expression of disbelief on his face: \u201cCould it be Sovereign also has a top grade thirteen martial spirit?\u201dMain Chief Chen Tianqi was the person with the highest talent in the Asura\u2019s Gate and in the entire Star Cloud Continent; his talent was considered as one of the premier talents . Not to mention, a top grade thirteen martial spirit! Even grade thirteen martial spirits are rare gems in the whole Martial Spirit World . So, Yu Ming can\u2019t be blamed for his reaction of disbelief when it was implied that Huang Xiaolong, like Chen Tianqi, possessed a top grade thirteen martial spirit .At this point, Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou shifted their sights towards Huang Xiaolong .Yu Ming\u2019s eyes had not moved away from Huang Xiaolong since hearing Fei Hou\u2019s words .In the next moment, Huang Xiaolong called out his twin dragon martial spirits, not planning to deceive Yu Ming .Instantly, a radiant light burst out from Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body and a huge black dragon was seen floating above him .\u201cPrimordial Divine Black Dragon!\u201d Both of Yu Ming\u2019s eyes protruded with surprise .Top grade twelve martial spirit!Such a talent, although incomparable to Main Chief Chen Tianqi, but it was still shocking . And it was enough to stand at the helm and become their Asura\u2019s Gate Sovereign .Exactly at this moment, a dazzling blue light broke out behind Huang Xiaolong . Under Yu Ming\u2019s dumbfounded eyes, a blue dragon materialized in the hall, floating quietly in midair next to the black dragon .The black and blue dragons entwined together, and the echoes of the dragons\u2019 roar vibrated in all four directions .The dumbfounded Yu Ming stared blankly at the two dragons, his mind was a piece of white .\u201cTwin, superb twin martial spirits!\u201dMoreover, both were Primordial Divine Dragon martial spirits!Blue dragon ah!So many years in the Martial Spirit World, yet Yu Ming had never heard of anyone possessing a blue dragon martial spirit!Blanking out for some time, Yu Ming\u2019s tongue was twisted into a knot, similar to how his disciples, Fei Hou and Marshal Haotian reacted when they first found out . In an abrupt action, Yu Ming stood up from his seat and knelt down on a single knee .\u201cSovereign invincible throughout!\u201d Yu Ming lauded, trembling with excitement .Huang Xiaolong quickly held Yu Ming up, but he remained kneeling for a long time before he was willing to get up . Even so, he didn\u2019t seem to have calmed down; and the way he looked at Huang Xiaolong was completely different from before .After Yu Ming had stood up, Huang Xiaolong had thought for a moment before saying, \u201cI have something to show you all . \u201d In front of Yu Ming, Fei Hou, and Marshal Haotian, another bright light shone behind Huang Xiaolong, revealing a shiny golden pagoda . The very same pagoda Huang Xiaolong had \u2018found\u2019 in the Dragon Flame Valley .As an Elder of the Asura\u2019s Gate, Yu Ming has a wide amount of knowledge and experience and he probably could recognize this pagoda . Huang Xiaolong wanted to let Yu Ming identify what kind of treasure the pagoda was .With the degree of loyalty shown by the trio of master disciples, Huang Xiaolong wasn\u2019t afraid they would leak out news about it .Fei Hou, Marshal Haotian, and Yu Ming looked at the golden pagoda behind Huang Xiaolong, and each of them was filled with puzzlement . However, Yu Ming suddenly shook as if he was electrified; this was just as dramatic as when he saw Huang Xiaolong\u2019s black dragon; with quivering lips, he pointed a finger at the golden pagoda floating behind Huang Xiaolong, his eyes almost popping out as he stammered: \u201cThis, this, is this the Linglong Treasure Pagoda!\u201dLinglong Treasure Pagoda!Both Fei Hou, and Marshal Haotian looked over to the excited Master Yu Ming, and the two became even more confused . Obviously, both of them had never heard of this Linglong Treasure Pagoda .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s attention was also on Yu Ming .\u201cThe Linglong Treasure Pagoda! It is really the Linglong Treasure Pagoda!\u201d At this moment, it looked like nothing existed other than the golden pagoda in front of Yu Ming, his eyes burning with emotion, and the rhythm of his breathing quickened .Seeing Yu Ming\u2019s dramatic reaction, Huang Xiaolong felt speechless .However, judging by his reaction, this so-called Linglong Treasure Pagoda is a very rare and valuable item?After what seemed like half a day\u2019s time, Yu Ming finally calmed down; looking at Huang Xiaolong, his eyes contained the slightest traces of envy . Even when Huang Xiaolong called out his twin dragon superb martial spirits, there wasn\u2019t envy in his eyes .Inhaling a deep breath, Yu Ming said to Huang Xiaolong: \u201cBetween Heaven and Earth, there exist objects referred to as Heavenly Treasures . Every time a Heavenly Treasure appears, it will set off bloody trails behind it; numerous powers compete for it and numerous people die for it . \u201d Yu Ming paused for a second here before continuing, eyes sparkling as he stared at the pagoda behind Huang Xiaolong, \u201cBetween Heaven and Earth, there are a total of thirty-two Heavenly Treasures . \u00a0And Sovereign\u2019s pagoda, if I\u2019m not mistaken, should be the number nine Linglong Treasure Pagoda . \u201dHeavenly Treasure, the number nine Linglong Treasure Pagoda!Yu Ming added, \u201cEvery Heavenly Treasure has different magical effects, especially towards a person\u2019s cultivation\u2013 it provides an unimaginable benefit . Sovereign should be aware of this since Sovereign managed to rein in this Linglong Treasure Pagoda . Also, as Sovereign becomes stronger in the future, the benefits of this Linglong Treasure Pagoda will only increase!\u201dNote:Changing early grade to low grade for battle skills, Dans and weapons grade .______________________________________________________________Next release: soon? lolPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Like what Yu Ming had said earlier, this Linglong Treasure Pagoda brings unimaginable benefits to Huang Xiaolong\u2019s future cultivation.\u201cYou said, as I grow stronger, this pagoda will play a bigger role?\u201d Huang Xiaolong asked Yu Ming: \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dYu Ming replied respectfully, \u201cAbout the Linglong Treasure Pagoda, Subordinate doesn\u2019t know much, but I heard some say that the Linglong Treasure Pagoda has nine layers in total. As its Master becomes stronger, each layer can be opened accordingly.\u201d\u201cNine layers in total!\u201d Huang Xiaolong was shocked. Although he \u2018reined in\u2019 the Linglong Treasure Pagoda, but he truly did not know that there were nine layers inside the pagoda.Could every floor hold a different treasure within?At this time, Yu Ming\u2019s voice sounded as he continued to explain, \u201cBased on rumors, from the first layer of Linglong Treasure Pagoda, it could produce something called the Fire Dragon Pearl; as for its uses, this Subordinate is not sure.\u201dFire Dragon Pearl!Huang Xiaolong\u2019s heartbeat quickened. This Fire Dragon Pearl should be some kind of beads condensed out from the cumulation of fire dragon qi. \u00a0In its natural form, fire dragon qi could temper and strengthen the physical body, enhance the quality of battle qi; therefore, needless to say, this Fire Dragon Pearl is probably even more potent. Swallowing it before practice could produce a better result a hundred times over!Suddenly, Huang Xiaolong thought of an important issue and asked Yu Ming, \u201cThen, this Fire Dragon Pearl, can others swallow it for cultivation?\u201d If others can do so, when he opens the first layer later, he could give this Fire Dragon Pearl to his parents, little sister, little brother, Li Lu, as well as Fei Hou, Haotian, and the rest.\u00a0Doesn\u2019t this mean his parents and people close to him can also temper their physique and enhance their battle qi continuously?Yu Ming was a little surprised with the question and after thinking for a moment, he said, \u201cOthers should be able to. However, Sovereign, according to rumors, the Linglong Treasure Pagoda needs natural spiritual aura to be able to form Fire Dragon Pearl, so it might be able to produce only one Fire Dragon Pearl after a certain period of time intermittently.\u201dThis made Huang Xiaolong frowned, and he questioned, \u201cIs there any other method to make Linglong Treasure Pagoda produce more Fire Dragon Pearl?\u201dYu Ming shook his head: \u201cThis, Subordinate doesn\u2019t know.\u201dHuang Xiaolong nodded slowly; it seems he can only wait and test it out in the future.\u201cThen, do you know what level of strength is needed to open the first layer of the pagoda?\u201d Huang Xiaolong asked in a somber voice.\u201cRumours has it that one should be a Houtian Seventh Order, and the second layer needs to be a Xiantian First Order.\u201d Yu Ming answered before adding, \u201cBut what strength is needed to open the third layer, this Subordinate doesn\u2019t know.\u201dHoutian Seventh Order!Huang Xiaolong was delighted! If this is true, then within half a year\u2019s time, doesn\u2019t that mean he could open the Linglong Treasure Pagoda\u2019s first layer?He is confident that he could break through to the Seventh Order in the upcoming six months.\u201cNa, do you know the number one treasure on the Heavenly Treasure List?\u201d Huang Xiaolong asked another question out of curiosity; a treasure such as the Linglong Treasure Pagoda was only listed as the ninth, so this made Huang Xiaolong wonder about the treasure that was reputed as number one\u2026\u201cI heard it was a mountain!\u201d Yu Ming replied.A mountain!\u00a0Huang Xiaolong was stunned; he imagined many different possibilities, but it never crossed his mind that the first Heavenly Treasure would turn out to be a mountain!Yu Ming nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s right Sovereign, it is a mountain called Heavenly Mount. Xumi!\u201d\u201cHeavenly Mount. Xumi!\u201d Huang Xiaolong repeated.\u201cAccording to legens, on the Heavenly Mount. Xumi there is something called Geocentric Buddha Milk, a wonder accumulated between heaven and earth. After swallowing it, cultivation is only half the effort. The person who has the Heavenly Mount Xumi is said to be blessed with the great earth\u2019s power, enhancing one\u2019s defense until it reaches a certain threshold.\u201d Yu Ming said, \u201cNot only that, there is a battle skill within the Heavenly Mount Xumi called the Godly Xumi Law and it was claimed to be the strongest battle skill ever!\u201dGodly Xumi Law!The strongest ever battle skill!Then, that is the strongest battle skill in this world!\u201cHowever, after appearing once more hundreds of thousands years ago, there hasn\u2019t been any news of the Heavenly Mount. Xumi since then.\u201d Yu Ming shook his head as if in pity.\u201cOh, why is that?\u201d Huang Xiaolong was curious.\u201cOnly those possessing superb talent martial spirits could rein in these Heavenly Treasures. The higher the rank of the Heavenly Treasure, the higher the requirements of martial spirits. Therefore, it needed people with grade thirteen and above martial spirits to have a chance. Especially in the case of the Heavenly Mount. Xumi, it needed someone with twin martial spirits of the same kind to rein it in, but in the Martial Spirit World, it has been thousands of years since someone like that has appeared!\u201d At this point, Yu Ming\u2019s eyes lit up like the stars as he looked at Huang Xiaolong, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that after so long, Sovereign actually possesses the same kind superb twin martial spirits!\u201dHearing this, Huang Xiaolong was stunned at first and it turned to joy. If what Yu Ming said was true, then this Godly Mount Xumi is still ownerless; by chance, if he comes to encounter it in the future, he must definitely rein it!\u201cSovereign, in fact, your Linglong Treasure Pagoda also has a set of heritage cultivation methods called the Golden Linglong Body!\u201d Yu Ming stated matter-of-factly, \u201cThis Golden Linglong Body is a high-grade Heaven rank physique cultivation method.\u201d\u201cPhysique cultivation method!\u201d Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes were twinkling with delight; the Asura Tactics is but a battle qi cultivation technique, and at the moment, what he lacked most was a way to strengthen his physical body!But, how can he get this cultivation method from the Linglong Treasure Pagoda?\u201cSovereign, when you have advanced to the Seventh Order and are able to open the first layer of the pagoda, you may get it at that time.\u201d Yu Ming smiled and said as if knowing what Huang Xiaolong was thinking about.Hearing this, Huang Xiaolong was relieved.So, that\u2019s how it is!All this time, Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou sat on the side, not daring to utter a sound, listening to Yu Ming and Huang Xiaolong\u2019s conversation. The shock they received was hard to imagine even though both of them can be considered as strong experts, but just like Huang Xiaolong, this was their first time hearing about Heavenly Treasures that exist in this world!Such amazing things!\u201cDo you have news about other Heavenly Treasures?\u201d Again, Huang Xiaolong continued with his questions.Huang Xiaolong asked the question casually, and Yu Ming\u2019s answer surprised him, \u201cSubordinate has heard that there is a Heavenly Treasure in the Duanren Empire\u2019s Duanren Institute, the Absolute Soul Pearl! The Absolute Soul Pearl is ranked at number four on the list!\u201dDuanren Institute, Absolute Soul Pearl, Heavenly Treasure List number four!Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes shone brightly.Yu Ming added, \u201cYears ago, for this Absolute Soul Pearl, the Old Sovereign had sneaked into the Duanren Institute. Unfortunately, before he could find it, he was found by the Duanren Institute\u2019s guardians and was encircled by the institute\u2019s experts. In the end, he could only leave with failure.\u201dMaster Ren Wo Kuang also tried to get the Absolute Soul Pearl?\u00a0This information was out of Huang Xiaolong\u2019s expectation.\u201cThen, this Absolute Soul Pearl also has a heritage battle skill or physique cultivation method?\u201dYu Ming nodded in affirmation, \u201cYes, in general, the first ten Heavenly Treasures will have them. The Absolute Soul Pearl contains a battle skill called the Absolute Soul Finger that is said to be able to penetrate to the deepest of hell once practiced to major completion!\u201dCan penetrate to the deepest of hell!\u201cAs for news of other treasures, Subordinate is not clear.\u201d Yu Ming said.A while later, Yu Ming, Fei Hou, and Marshal Haotian receded from the main hall.Meanwhile, Huang Xiaolong was lost in thought.Unexpectedly, there was a ranked four Heavenly Treasure in Duanren Empire\u2019s Duanren Institute, the Absolute Soul Pearl. Even with Master Ren Wokuang\u2019s strength, he couldn\u2019t take it out from the Duanren Institute. Then the only way to proceed was to become a Duanren Institute\u2019s student, explore the grounds, and wait for the opportunity to strike.Duanren Institute!Battle of the Imperial City\u2013 as long as he could enter the first one thousand places he could be one of the Duanren Institute\u2019s students.With Huang Xiaolong\u2019s cultivation speed, within a decade, he was sure to become the Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s overall champion, and then he could proceed to the Duanren Empire to participate in the Imperial City Battle.Note:Xumi Shenshan \u2013 Mt.

The black and blue dragons were devouring the spiritual aura with greed; the Linglong Treasure Pagoda also came out, floating above Huang Xiaolong, parallel with the twin dragons . Golden lights flickered as streams of fire qi drilled into Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body, tempering every inch of Huang Xiaolong\u2019s physique, from his meridians to his netherworld battle qi .Before\u00a0this, the netherworld battle qi in his body was a faint gray, but now, after fusing with the fire qi, its color had slowly changed, deepening into a dark gray color .The darkness of the night deepened .Silence pervaded the land .The moonlight shined like the water\u2019s reflection while Huang Xiaolong remained on the cold jade bed shrouded in a fog of dark gray light; and within this dark gray light, red flames flashed intermittently .One night passed .When the morning sunlight streamed onto Huang Xiaolong\u2019s courtyard, he ended his practice for the night . Breathing in the fresh air that accompanied the early morning, Huang Xiaolong subsequently looked towards the direction of Canglan County, the location of the Huang Clan Manor .In another two weeks, it would be the first day of the New Year and today he planned to journey back to the Huang Clan Manor . If his speed was quick enough, he would be able to make it back to Huang Clan Manor in twelve, or at most thirteen days\u2019 time .Thinking that when he returned he could see his parents and his siblings who he hasn't seen in a year\u2019s time, Huang Xiaolong almost couldn\u2019t suppress the excitement in his heart .I don\u2019t\u00a0know if Mom and Dad are well?\u00a0Repressing the excitement in his heart, Huang Xiaolong wondered .Before he left, his Dad had taken that high Grade Four Spirit Dragon Tiger Fundamental Dan and his Dad was already a peak late-Sixth Order at that time; in this one year\u2019s time, very likely he had broken through to the Seventh Order .The Seventh Order, although it was still a lot worse compared to his Eldest Uncle, Huang Ming, a peak late-Seventh Order, Huang Xiaolong believed in five to six years' time he could help his Dad catch up to Huang Ming, and maybe even surpass him .Leaving his courtyard, Huang Xiaolong went to the main hall and saw that, Yu Ming, Fei Hou, and Marshal Haotian were already waiting for him .Seeing Huang Xiaolong\u2019s arrival, the three of them quickly went up to salute .And more than an hour later, Huang Xiaolong, Marshal Haotian, and Fei Hou left Tianxuan Mansion, starting their journey back to Canglan County, back to Huang Clan Manor .Yu Ming, however, wasn\u2019t included within the group heading back to Huang Clan Manor . Instead, he left the Luo Tong Kingdom, rushing back to the Asura\u2019s Gate headquarters on the Star Cloud Continent . Matters about Huang Xiaolong, he must let both the Left and Right Deputy know so that they can send Saint realm experts to ensure Huang Xiaolong\u2019s safety .Of course, Yu Ming was given expressed permission by Huang Xiaolong to inform Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu . Otherwise, Yu Ming would not act on his own .However, before Yu Ming departed, Huang Xiaolong ordered Yu Ming not to disclose his identity, lest too many people know about him . Other than Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu, he should not tell anyone else about him .Yu Ming acknowledged the order respectfully .Ten days passed since Huang Xiaolong started to head back to Huang Clan Manor .Huang Xiaolong, Marshal Haotian, and Fei Hou had arrived at the south side of County City of Canglan County .From the County City to the Huang Clan Manor, they only needed to travel for another two days .While Huang Xiaolong reached the County City, in the Eastern Courtyard of the Huang Clan Manor, Huang Peng and Su Yan were sitting in the main hall, looking worried and anxious .\u201cAnother four days until the New Year . Xiaolong said he will come back at the end of the year and until now, he hasn\u2019t come back . Peng Ge, what do you think\u2013 did Xiaolong encounter danger that we don\u2019t know?\u201d Su Yan asked, and her face showed a trace of sorrow, \u201cIf something happened to Xiaolong, what would we do!\u201d Su Yan grew more anxious by the second and abruptly stood up from her seat to pace back and forth in the main hall, lost in worry not knowing what to do .Huang Peng was also worried, brows frowning tightly and said, \u201cThere is Senior Fei Hou with Xiaolong, so don\u2019t worry . Nothing will happen . Isn\u2019t there still four days before the first day of New Year? Xiaolong should be back in another two days!\u201d Although Huang Peng comforted Su Yan by saying so, like Su Yan, he was also worried about his son .Despite knowing Fei Hou was a peak late-Tenth Order, the world was still a dangerous place and anything could happen; after all, Fei Hou could not guarantee Huang Xiaolong\u2019s safety at all times .\u201cI heard Li Lu already came back from Cosmic Star Academy a few days ago . \u201d Su Yan suddenly said out of nowhere .What his wife was thinking of, Huang Peng naturally could guess; smiling bitterly, Huang Peng tried to be persuasive, \u201cMiss Li Lu is a talented Cosmic Star Academy student; although our Xiaolong isn\u2019t too bad, I don\u2019t think he could catch Miss Li Lu\u2019s sight . There are so many talented people in Cosmic Star Academy . \u201dBecause Huang Xiaolong had requested Li Cheng \u00a0from early on not to mention his matters in the Royal City to Huang Clan Manor . Thus, when Li Cheng and Li Lu returned to Canglan County, neither of them said anything about Huang Xiaolong; Huang Peng and Su Yan still doesn\u2019t know that their son is also a Cosmic Star Academy student .At this time, Huang Min ran in from outside, shouting \u201cMom, Dad, Brother Huang Jun has returned!\u201dHuang Peng and Su Yan were startled .Huang Jun has returned?Huang Ming has two sons: the second son was Huang Wei while the eldest son, Huang Jun, was accepted into one of the neighbouring kingdom\u2019s prominent sects \u2013 the Baolong Kingdom\u2019s Big Sword Sect . Huang Jun hasn\u2019t returned to Huang Clan Manor in three years, so they didn\u2019t expect he would come back to celebrate the New Year this time .\u201cNot only that, Brother Huang Jun brought a weirdly dressed person with him . \u201d Huang Min added .\u201cA weirdly dressed person?\u201d Huang Peng and Su Yan exchanged a look, guessing it should be Huang Jun\u2019s same sect disciple . Both of them felt strange that Huang Jun would bring someone from his sect back to celebrate the New Year, but they did not think too much about it .At the same time, laughter resounded in the Northern Courtyard .The always deadpan expression on Huang Ming\u2019s face was replaced with a big smile . Next to Huang Ming was a young man, about fifteen to sixteen years old; muscular, thick eyebrows, and sharp eyes . This was Huang Ming\u2019s eldest son, Huang Jun, and next to Huang Jun sat Huang Wei .However, the one sitting on the main seat in the main hall wasn\u2019t Huang Ming, but a middle-aged man who dressed strangely . And this middle-aged man was Huang Jun\u2019s Master, Liu Wei . Big Sword Sect\u2019s Sect Leader!Huang Jun\u2019s talent was quite good, possessing an average grade nine martial spirits plus due to his high comprehension ability and diligent effort, he was taken as Liu Wei\u2019s pro-disciples not long after he entered Big Sword Sect .Liu Wei actually came to take care of something on the southwest side of Luo Tong Kingdom and Huang Jun requested to visit his family . Since it was along the way, Liu Wei agreed to stay in Huang Clan Manor for a few days .When Huang Ming heard his son introduce that middle-aged man as Big Sword Sect Sect Leader, his manner was extremely respectful after getting over his shock . A wide smile plastered on his face, carrying the bearings of a slave .Liu Wei was not only Big Sword Sect\u2019s Sect Leader, he was also a Xiantian realm expert!\u201cBig Brother, it\u2019s great you\u2019ve returned . That Huang Xiaolong and his father is too arrogant nowadays!\u201d At some point, Huang Wei who was sitting next to Huang Jun \u2018complained\u2019, \u201cDuring last year\u2019s Clan Assembly, that Huang Xiaolong broke both of my hands and legs! You absolutely must avenge your younger brother!\u201d\u201cWhat? That brat broke your hands and legs?!\u201d Hearing this, Huang Jun\u2019s expression darkened, \u201cHow did it become like this?\u201dNote:There are fifteen days to of celebration for (Chinese) New Year, beginning from the First Day (for me, it starts from the Reunion Dinner) on the, Seventh Day it is considered as Everyone\u2019s Birthday; the Fifteenth Day (Lantern Festival Day) .

His slave attacked and injured Grandfather and Dad?!\u201d Huang Jun looked at Huang Ming, his eyes becoming cold yet at the same time, he was shocked . \u00a0His Grandfather, Huang Qide, was a Tenth Order warrior, and a mere slave of Huang Xiaolong had this strength?\u201cIt is so, Jun\u2019er . \u201d Huang Ming nodded, confirming what Huang Wei had just said . \u201cThat slave of Huang Xiaolong is called Fei Hou!\u201d Saying this, Huang Ming thought of the humiliation when he was struck by Fei Hou\u2019s palm and crashed into rows of chairs, hate flashed strongly across his eyes: \u201cThat dog slave Fei Hou is a peak late-Tenth Order expert . \u201d\u201cThe peak of late-Tenth Order\u2026\u201d Huang Jun was stunned; he could not help but turn to look at his Master Liu Wei, and he hesitated before muttering \u201cMaster, this . . . ?\u201dLiu Wei remained blas\u00e9 as he waved his hand, \u201cIsn\u2019t it only a measly peak late-Tenth Order warrior?\u201dHuang Jun was overjoyed; Master\u2019s words meant he agreed to speak for them .Huang Jun immediately stood up from the seat: \u201cThank you Master!\u201dHuang Ming and Huang Wei were also happy hearing that, so they followed Huang Jun\u2019s action, both of them stood up and respectfully thanked Liu Wei .Huang Ming laughed heartily, \u201cIt is great that Senior Liu Wei is here . That dog of a slave Fei Hou won\u2019t last one strike before Senior Liu Wei!\u201dHuang Wei agreed: \u201cOf course, in front of Senior Liu Wei, that dog slave Fei Hou will be scared until he pisses in his pants!\u201d\u201cThat Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou are at the Eastern Courtyard now?\u201d Huang Jun asked .\u201cNo, Huang Xiaolong has left Huang Clan Manor for almost a year, but he did say that he would return at the end of the year . It should be in these two days\u2019 time . \u201dHuang Jun sneered, \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, wait until that brat and his dog slave, Fei Hou or whatever comes back; it is not too late to teach them a lesson then . In the meantime, we can collect some interest!\u201d\u201cCollect some interest?\u201d Huang Wei looked at Huang Jun, confused: \u201cBig Brother, you mean\u2026?\u201dHuang Jun nodded his head and said, \u201cCorrect . Huang Peng and Su Yan allowed their son to indulge in committing violent acts and ignoring clan rules . Becoming so presumptuous as to injure Grandfather and Dad . These two must be punished!\u201d He sneered and added, \u201cIt has been some years since I\u2019ve seen Huang Peng and Su Yan, I should take this opportunity to \u2018greet\u2019 them . \u201dHuang Ming frowned; however, he kept silent, not voicing any objections or words of agreement .A short while later, the group led by Huang Jun came to the Eastern Courtyard .When Huang Jun, Huang Ming, and the others stepped into the Eastern Courtyard, Huang Peng and Su Yan were presently sitting in the main hall, and both Huang Min and Huang Xiaohai were together with them .When Huang Peng and Su Yan saw Huang Jun, Huang Ming, Huang Wei, and another stranger walked in, both were surprised .\u201cHuang Jun?\u201d Huang Peng almost couldn\u2019t recognize the young man next to Huang Ming .A few years ago, Huang Jun was still a youth; now, Huang Jun is taller than five feet seven with broad shoulders and a thick waist . A brawny figure of a man .\u201cIt is me . \u201d Huang Jun answered with a cold expression, \u201cHuang Peng, in last year\u2019s Clan Assembly, you actually dared to indulge your son\u2019s violent actions, injuring my Dad and Grandfather!\u201dHuang Peng and Su Yan blanked for a moment and realization dawned on them \u2013 the reason why these four people came over to the Eastern Courtyard .Huang Peng glanced at the four, knowing an explanation is of no use and his expression became gloomy, his voice heavy and somber, \u201cSo what?\u201dSneering coldly, Huang Jun repeated in a cold voice, \u201cSo what? Since your son and dog servant are absent, then I will collect some interest from you! Wait till your son comes back two days later, we can settle the debt once and for all!\u201dHuang Ming just stood there, like an audience, watching and not speaking .Huang Peng glared at them furiously: \u201cClear the debt? You brat, even if you entered Big Sword Sect as their disciple, you are not qualified to swagger in the Eastern Courtyard as you please . Here is Huang Clan Manor, not the Big Sword Sect!\u201dSuddenly, at this time, a tyrannical energy rushed towards Huang Peng, giving him no time to react or dodge . His body shook violently as if hit by a huge pressure and flew off, smashing into a wall in the main hall, vomiting blood as he slid down .\u201cPeng Ge!\u201d\u201cDad!\u201dSu Yan, Huang Min, and Huang Xiaohai cried out in fright, flying to Huang Peng\u2019s side .\u201cPeng Ge, are you okay? Please don\u2019t scare me!\u201d Su Yan tried to help Huang Peng up, tears flowed down uncontrollably as she held onto Huang Peng tightly .\u201cDad, Dad!\u201d Huang Min and Huang Xiaohai, the two little guy\u2019s eyes were red as they cried pitifully .Huang Peng looked at Su Yan, his voice hoarse as he comforted, \u201cI\u2019m alright,\u201d Another mouthful of blood came out from his mouth before he could finish his words .This turn of events also shocked Huang Ming, Huang Jun, and Huang Wei .Huang Jun turned to look at the person next to him . The one who hit Huang Peng just now was his Master Liu Wei .\u201cMaster, this\u2026\u201d Huang Jun paused .Although Huang Peng\u2019s words were offensive towards the Big Sword Sect, but weren't Liu Wei a little heavy handed? No matter what, Huang Peng was his uncle .Liu Wei was indifferent, \u201cBeing disrespectful to Big Sword Sect, the punishment is death!\u201d Then he paused, \u201cHowever, for your sake, I spared his life . Don\u2019t worry, he won\u2019t die; at most, he\u2019ll be bedridden for three to four months . \u201dBedridden\u00a0for three to four months?\u00a0Hearing this, Huang Ming and Huang Jun were relieved .At this point, Huang Min who was crying miserably suddenly stood up with hatred in her eyes, and lunged at Huang Wei: \u201cYou all bully my Dad, I\u2019ll fight all of you!\u201dWatching Huang Min coming at him, Huang Wei lifted his leg and kicked at Huang Min .Although Huang Min had started practicing battle qi, she wasn\u2019t Huang Wei\u2019s opponent . The strength Huang Wei used in the kick wasn\u2019t light, and it made Huang Min uttered a painful scream .\u201cMin\u2019er!\u201d Seeing this, Su Yan wailed her daughter's name .Then, a bustle of footsteps was heard from outside; a group of Huang Clan Manor guards had rushed over and saw Huang Peng and Huang Min lying on the ground in the main hall, and they were shocked .\u201cReturn to your posts . This doesn\u2019t concern you all . \u201d Seeing the gathering guards, Huang Ming issued his command .The guards looked at each other, not sure what to do .\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I\u2019ve said? Step back!\u201d Huang Ming raised his voice and snapped .\u201cYes, Eldest Manor Lord!\u201d The group of Huang Clan Manor guards was scared witless, they answered weakly and stepped to the side .And Huang Qide who was in closed-door practice had just come out, and Chief Steward Chen Ying hurried up to report, \u201cOld Manor Lord, not good, something happened in the Eastern Courtyard!\u201d\u201cEastern Courtyard?\u201d Huang Qide was startled, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cToday, Young Lord Huang Jun came back, and he probably heard about what happened during last year\u2019s Clan Assembly where Senior Fei Hou injured the Eldest Manor Lord . \u00a0Just now, he brought the Eldest Manor Lord to the Eastern Courtyard . \u201d Chen Ying summarized the event for Huang Qide .\u201cWhat?!\u201d Huang Qide\u2019s expression changed, \u201cHurry, to the Eastern Courtyard!\u201dMoments later, Huang Qide and Chen Ying arrived at the Eastern Courtyard; the first thing they saw was the injured Huang Peng lying on the floor .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Huang Peng is your younger brother, yet you actually struck him with such a heavy hand!\u201dOn the way to the Eastern Courtyard, Chen Ying skipped over the matter of Huang Peng being wounded, so Huang Qide thought it must be Huang Ming who injured Huang Peng so badly .Before Huang Ming could say anything, Huang Jun interrupted them by saying, \u201cGrandfather, this is my Master, Big Sword Sect\u2019s Sect Leader!\u201d He indicated with his hand towards Liu Wei next to him .The angry Huang Qide went into a daze as he looked at the strangely dressed middle-aged man\u2026 . Big Sword Sect\u2019s Sect Leader?\u201cGrandfather, just now, Second Uncle was disrespectful towards our Big Sword Sect and offended Master . It was due to this reason that Master would\u2026\u201d Huang Jun let his words fade here, but his implied meaning was evident .Liu Wei\u2019s cold eyes swept passed Huang Qide, \u201cYou are Huang Qide? These people were injured by me . What about it, you want to vent your anger on me?\u201dHuang Qide became awkward and embarrassed; then, his face cracked a cordial smile, \u201cSo it is the Sect Leader of Big Sword Sect, Senior Liu Wei . What is Senior Liu Wei saying, it was Huang Peng who offended Big Sword Sect and Senior Liu Wei in the first place . It is his honor to be taught a lesson by Senior Liu Wei; indeed, a lesson ought to be taught!\u201dCompared to the momentum when the two arrived, Huang Qide and Chen Ying seemed like another person .Liu Wei snorted coldly, and \u2018advised\u2019 Huang Qide in a condescending tone, \u201cHuang Qide, in my opinion, a son like this is not worth keeping . You won\u2019t know which day he would bring an annihilation catastrophe onto the Huang Clan Manor!\u201dHuang Qide\u2019s expression grew ugly, not knowing what to say .When Su Yan, who was holding Huang Peng heard that, she was scared and outraged at the same time .However, Liu Wei flicked his sleeve and left after saying that with Huang Jun, Huang Ming, and Huang Wei following closely behind .Huang Qide opened his mouth, closed it, and then opened again a couple with times yet no words came out as he watched the four silhouettes grow smaller . Standing there, his expression was dark and gloomy, no one knew what he was thinking about .\u201cManor Lord, you see, the Second Manor Lord\u2026?\u201d Minutes later, Chen Ying walked up to Huang Qide and asked cautiously, \u201cShould we let the Second Manor Lord heal first?\u201dHuang Qide looked up to the sky and sighed, then he turned around and left after nodding to Chen Ying, indicating that he agreed with his suggestion .After leaving the Eastern Courtyard, Liu Wei, Huang Jun, Huang Ming, and Huang Wei (Master, and the three father and sons) returned to the Northern Courtyard . Huang Ming insisted Liu Wei to rest first and made the proper arrangements . When everything was arranged, the trio of father and sons left the yard and went to the main hall .Seated in the main hall, Huang Wei boldly said to Huang Ming, \u201cDad, we should take this opportunity and persuade Grandfather to banish Huang Peng from Huang Clan Manor . As long as Huang Peng is out of the way, the future Manor Lord position is guaranteed to be taken over by Dad!\u201d\u201cBanish Huang Peng from Huang Clan Manor?\u201d Huang Ming frowned, \u201cThat is not very good, right?\u201d\u201cWho cares if it is good or not . \u201d Huang Wei subsequently added, \u201cDad, you\u2019ve said before, to be successful, one should not bother with trifle matters . If that Huang Peng remains here in Huang Clan Manor, he will always be a risk factor for Dad . Ever since the last Clan Assembly, Grandfather\u2019s attitude towards Huang Peng had changed a hundred and eighty degrees, and you are aware of it yourself . Not only that, many of the Manor Elders had leaned towards Huang Peng\u2019s side, tongues are wagging around the Manor that there is a high chance that Grandfather would pass the Manor Lord position to Huang Peng!\u201dAt this time, Huang Jun supported, saying \u201cWhat Little Brother said is reasonable . Dad, we can use Huang Peng offending my Master as an excuse to persuade Grandfather to banish Huang Peng out of Huang Clan Manor!\u201dHuang Ming kept silent .\u201cDad, there\u2019s nothing to worry about!\u201d Huang Wei persuaded .Huang Min\u2019s raised his head, looking at his two sons he nodded .Two days passed .Another two more days is the First Day of New Year; like many years of traditions, Huang Clan Manor had a festive atmosphere, red New Year decorations were everywhere in the manor . The mood was especially high and festive in the Northern Courtyard, and the quiet Eastern Courtyard was a stark comparison .While the Huang Clan Manor\u2019s guards and servants were busy with preparation, a few miles outside of Huang Clan Manor, several figures were braving the snow ladened road, heading closer to Huang Clan Manor .Seeing the outline of Huang Clan Manor getting closer and closer, a sudden excitement rose in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s heart .Finally, he has returned to Huang Clan Manor!Dad, Mom, son is back!Soon, Huang Xiaolong reaches the open space in front of Huang Clan Manor\u2019s main entrance and stood there, looking at the door .He remembered the scene from one year ago when he left Huang Clan Manor with Fei Hou, his parents stood on this exact spot, watching his departure .At this time, snow floated down from above; some landed on Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body, exuding small bursts of cold .\u201cIt\u2019s snowing again,\u201d Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself; there was a big snow at the end of last year too .Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou stood a few steps behind Huang Xiaolong, both did not say anything as they waited for Huang Xiaolong\u201cZhi zhi zhi!\u201d At this moment, the little violet monkey on Huang Xiaolong\u2019s shoulder squeaked excitedly; on this trip back to Huang Clan Manor, Huang Xiaolong of course brought the little violet monkey back with him .The little violet monkey\u2019s squeaking seemed to pull Huang Xiaolong back from his reminiscing . He glanced at the little guy bouncing on his shoulder, and smiled;\u00a0apparently, this little guy is urging him to go in quickly .\u201cLet\u2019s go home!\u201d Huang Xiaolong chuckled, lifted his feet and stepped through the door .Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou followed after Huang Xiaolong into Huang Clan Manor .However, when Huang Xiaolong walked into Huang Clan manor, he noticed the guards and servants avoided him from miles away with strange expressions on their faces . This raised a doubt in Huang Xiaolong .When he came close to the Eastern Courtyard, Huang Xiaolong spotted his little brother Huang Xiaohai squatting in one corner; hitting the snow on the ground with a little stick while crying .\u201cXiaohai!\u201d Huang Xiaolong called out .Hearing the familiar voice, Huang Xiaohai jumped up abruptly and spun around, little legs flew towards Huang Xiaolong . Hugging Huang Xiaolong, Huang Xiaohai cried out loud: \u201cBig Brother, you\u2019re finally back!\u201d\u201cWoo woo woo! Woo woo woo!\u201dIn an instant, Huang Xiaohai\u2019s tears had dampened Huang Xiaolong\u2019s robe .\u201cXiaohai, tell Big Brother what happened? Did Huang Min bully you?\u201d Huang Xiaolong asked gently, wiping away the tear stains from Huang Xiaohai\u2019s face .Huang Xiaohai did not answer and kept crying pitifully .\u201cWhat is it? Xiaohai, what happened?\u201d Huang Xiaolong had a bad premonition in his heart .\u201cDad, Dad he, he!\u201d Huang Xiaohai sobbed and choked, the words coming out from his mouth were almost intelligible, \u201cDad, Dad was wounded, and Second Sister too!\u201d Huang Xiaohai cried out while wiping his own tears .\u201cWhat?\u201d Huang Xiaolong\u2019s expression did not look good as he bolted into the Easter Courtyard . Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou exchanged a look and hastened to catch up to Huang Xiaolong .Hurrying to his father\u2019s room, the door was already opened and Huang Xiaolong dashed into the room: \u201cDad!\u201d Stepping into the room, the first person he saw was his mother, Su Yan sitting beside the bed; her head turned over to look at him, and Huang Xiaolong saw her eyes were red from crying . And a person was lying on the bed \u2013 his father Huang Peng!\u201cDad!\u201d Huang Xiaolong came to the bedside, bend close to Huang Peng and called out . His eyes were red-rimmed .On the bed, a ghastly pale Huang Peng slowly opened his eyes; seeing Huang Xiaolong, he tried to smile, a weak and croaky voice barely audible: \u201cXiaolong, you\u2019re back!\u201d\u201cDad, who was it? Tell me who was it that wounded you like this?\u201d Huang Xiaolong\u2019s fists clenched tightly seeing his father\u2019s terrible complexion, his heart ached and full of wrath .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Injured to this extent Dad actually insisted that he is alright!\u201cMom, who injured Dad? Who did it, tell me!\u201d Huang Xiaolong turned to the side, demanding an answer from Su Yan .Su Yan hesitated; her eyes still red and swollen from crying .\u201cXiaolong, you quickly leave! Leave Huang Clan Manor!\u201d Huang Peng suddenly urged .\u201cYes ah, Xiaolong, quickly leave Huang Clan Manor, the faster the better!\u201d \u00a0Su Yan agreed, compelling her son .Leave Huang Clan Manor?!\u00a0Huang Xiaolong was stunned, and a possibility crossed his mind; enraged, he asked, \u201cDad, is it Huang Ming?\u201dA trace of panic emerged in Huang Peng and Su Yan\u2019s eyes, both refusing to answer .Huang Ming! Really, it was him!Seeing his parents\u2019 reaction, Huang Xiaolong knew he had guessed correctly . A fire of fury burned in his heart, and a killing intent flashed across his pupils and disappeared just as fast . He turned around wanting to leave the room .\u201cXiaolong!\u201d Su Yan grabbed Huang Xiaolong\u2019s hand, crying, she shook her head, \u201cDon\u2019t go, don\u2019t go to the Northern Courtyard . Huang Wei\u2019s brother, Huang Jun came back! Along with Huang Jun is his master, the Big Sword Sect\u2019s Sect Leader Liu Wei!\u201d\u201cBig Sword Sect\u2019s Sect Leader Liu Wei!\u201d Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes narrowed dangerously .\u201cYes; in fact, your Dad was wounded by Liu Wei . That Liu Wei is a Xiantian realm expert!\u201d Su Yan sobbed and choked as she told what happened, \u201cTwo days ago, Huang Jun came back and found out that you broke Huang Wei\u2019s hands and legs during last year\u2019s Clan Assembly, and that Senior Fei Hou wounded Huang Ming . That was why, the day before yesterday Huang Jun, Huang Ming and Huang Wei brought that Liu Wei over to the Eastern Courtyard!\u201dSu Yan stopped here but anyone could have guessed what took place after that .\u201cHuang Wei also kicked your little sister!\u201d Su Yan cried even louder thinking of her daughter\u2019s tragic situation . \u201cHuang Jun, Huang Ming, and Huang Wei even said, when you come back, they will clear the debt with you and Senior Fei Hou . Xiaolong, you must quickly leave Huang Clan Manor with Senior Fei Hou! Otherwise, when they know you came back, it will be too late!\u201d\u201cHuang Jun, Huang Ming, Huang Wei, Liu Wei!\u201d A sharp, piercing light gleamed in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes; turning around, he looked at Marshal Haotian behind him, \u201cDo you know this Big Sword Sect\u2019s Sect Leader Liu Wei?\u201d\u201cReplying Young Master, although that Big Sword Sect\u2019s Sect Leader Liu Wei is a Xiantian realm expert, he is only a Xiantian First Order . He had just advanced a few years ago . \u201dThe Big Sword Sect was a sect from the neighboring Baolong Kingdom; Liu Wei as the Sect Leader was, of course, something Marshal Haotian had knowledge of .However, they have never met each other face to face .\u201cXiantian First Order . \u201d Huang Xiaolong smirked .It was at this moment that Huang Peng and Su Yan noticed Marshal Haotian\u2019s presence in the room .Young Master? Could he be Xiaolong\u2019s new slave?But both of them did not overthink this matter; Huang Peng looked anxiously at Fei Hou, \u201cSenior Fei Hou, I beg you, protect Xiaolong and leave Huang Clan Manor quickly before it is too late!\u201dAt the same time in the Northern Courtyard .A Huang Clan Manor guard came to report Huang Xiaolong\u2019s return to the trio of father and sons, Huang Ming, Huang Jun, and Huang Wei .After hearing the report, Huang Wei broke out in happy laughter, \u201cHaha, that little doggie Huang Xiaolong, and dog slave Fei Hou really came back! This time, I want to see if they are so lucky and could escape this!\u201d As he said this, he looked over at Huang Jun, \u201cBig Brother, later, don\u2019t kill that dog slave Fei Hou; first, destroyed his and Huang Xiaolong\u2019s cultivation, and then break every bone in their bodies ruthlessly!\u201d\u201cAs for that little doggie Huang Xiaolong, he actually dared to break my hands and legs, I want him to suffer ten times, a hundred times worse!\u201dA bloodthirsty light burned in Huang Wei\u2019s eyes .Huang Jun looked at his brother and replied, \u201cRest assured, I won\u2019t let that dog slave Fei Hou die so comfortably . At that time, Huang Xiaolong and that Fei Hou\u2019s cultivation will be destroyed, as for how to deal with them after that, I\u2019ll leave it to Dad and you to decide!\u201d He stood up after reassuring Huang Wei: \u201cI\u2019m going to request Master over now!\u201dHuang Ming nodded his head . Thus, Huang Ming, Huang Jun, and Huang Wei left the main hall to \u2018invite\u2019 Liu Wei .While the trio went to see Liu Wei, Huang Qide also got the news of Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou\u2019s return . Seated on a chair, he sighed, and to Chen Ying, he said, \u201cCome, let\u2019s make a trip to the Eastern Courtyard . \u201dMinutes later, Huang Qide and Chen Ying arrived in the Eastern Courtyard and coincidentally bumped into three people who just came out \u2013 Huang Xiaolong, Marshal Haotian, and Fei Hou .Seeing Huang Qide, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s gaze was icy-cold .Earlier, when Su Yan was retelling what happened; Su Yan said two days ago, when Huang Qide found out it was Liu Wei who injured his father, Huang Qide actually smiled cordially at Liu Wei and said his father ought to be taught a lesson!Ought!Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes were like knives falling on Huang Qide\u2019s body .Having a guilty conscience, Huang Qide dared not meet Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes .Suddenly, loud clamoring noises were heard outside the courtyard . \u201cLittle doggie Huang Xiaolong, I know you and that dog of a slave Fei Hou is back, roll out here!\u201dThis was Huang Wei\u2019s voice .The coldness in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes dropped a few celsius lower; he had planned to go over to the Northern Courtyard, didn\u2019t expect they would rush over here first . This father and sons trio truly can\u2019t wait to see him ah!But, it isn\u2019t bad this way, saved him the effort to walk over there .He turned towards Fei Hou saying, \u201cSomeone told us to roll out ya, let\u2019s go . Since some people can\u2019t wait to see us, we shouldn\u2019t let others down!\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master!\u201d Fei Hou and Marshal Haotian agreed respectfully .The three of them brushed past Huang Qide and Chen Ying, walking out from the courtyard .While the ashamed Huang Qide said to Chen Ying, \u201cCome on, we are also going out . \u201d Both of them followed behind Huang Xiaolong\u2019s group of three, exiting the yard .Appearing on the outer perimeter of the Eastern Courtyard, Huang Xiaolong immediately saw Huang Ming, Huang Wei, and Huang Jun standing outside .It has been close to three years since Huang Xiaolong last saw Huang Jun . Despite that, with just one look Huang Xiaolong could recognize him without difficulty; apart from his height and body, there weren't many changes to his facial features . Standing one step in front of the three was a strangely dressed middle-aged man .This person should be Huang Jun\u2019s Master, Big Sword Sect\u2019s Sect Leader, Liu Wei!When Huang Ming, Huang Wei, and Huang Jun saw Huang Xiaolong appeared, Huang Wei instantly smirked, \u201cLittle doggie Huang Xiaolong, you didn\u2019t expect us to come over so fast right . \u201dListening to Huang Wei\u2019s callous and disrespectful words, Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou was about to rush out in anger to teach that brat a lesson but Huang Xiaolong lifted his hand and stopped both of them . He looked at Huang Wei and sneered, \u201cI really didn\u2019t expect you all would rush here to die so anxiously!\u201dHuang Wei was furious, but Huang Jun spoke faster than him, \u201cHuang Xiaolong, this is my Master Liu Wei . My Master Liu Wei is Big Sword Sect\u2019s Sect Leader, a Xiantian realm expert!\u201d His eyes swept over Fei Hou behind Huang Xiaolong, he scoffed \u201cHe is that dog slave Fei Hou? You think with a tagalong peak late-Tenth Order warrior dog slave you can be arrogant and invincible in this world? Let me tell you, in front of my Master, that dog slave servant of yours doesn\u2019t even qualified as a dog!\u201dJust as Huang Jun finished his words, Huang Qide walked out from the Eastern Courtyard entrance with Chen Ying . Seeing Huang Qide, Huang Ming, Huang Jun, and Huang Wei were stunned; Huang Qide being here in the Eastern Courtyard at this time was truly out of their expectation .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although Huang Ming and his sons greeted him as usual, the respect is no longer there like previous times . Anyone could tell it was just a perfunctory greeting to a relative .\u201cSenior Liu Wei!\u201d Huang Qide came in front of Liu Wei and greeted respectfully .Liu Wei did not even bother to nod, only snorted \u2018en\u2019 through his nostril and focused his attention on Huang Xiaolong, as well as Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou who were guarding him from behind .When his gaze fell upon Fei Hou, he questioned: \u201cYou are Fei Hou? Peak late-Tenth Order? It wasn\u2019t easy for you to cultivate till the peak late-Tenth Order \u2212 we\u2019ll do it this way . If you kneel and surrender to me voluntarily, surrender to Big Sword Sect, I can spare your life and appoint you as our Big Sword Sect\u2019s Elder!\u201dHuang Jun, Huang Ming, and Huang Wei went into a daze .Big Sword Sect Elder!\u201cMaster, this\u2026!\u201d Huang Jun couldn\u2019t resist opening his mouth .The expression on Liu Wei\u2019s face turned cold with dissatisfaction, \u201cYou are not yet qualified to intervene here, step back!\u201dHuang Jun\u2019s heart quivered and quickly said: \u201cYes Master!\u201d\u201cHave you thought it over well?\u201d Liu Wei turned back to Fei Hou .At this time, Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou exchanged a look; both couldn\u2019t resist but to burst out laughing .\u201cWhat are you two laughing at?\u201d Liu Wei darkened .Fei Hou looked at the opposite site, sneered, \u201cBig Sword Sect? What thingy is Big Sword Sect?\u201dAfter Fei Hou\u2019s words \u2018landed\u2019, Huang Jun, Huang Ming, Huang Wei, even Huang Qide and Chen Ying were dumbfounded, looking at Fei Hou with disbelief . What nonsense is this dog slave spouting?!They even doubted if they heard correctly .\u201cWhat did you say?!\u201d Liu Wei was no exception; he also blanked for a moment .\u201cYour ears have problems?\u201d Fei Hou \u2018generously\u2019 repeated in a cold voice, \u201cI said, what thingy you think Big Sword Sect is for me to kneel down and submit to you? Wanting to give me an Elder position, cheh!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Liu Wei\u2019s face turned red then purple due to fury; his aura shot up suddenly and a horrifying energy swept out from his body like a raging wave . The sharp killing intent made Huang Qide and the surrounding people lose their color and they staggered backward in fright .\u201cDie! Courting death! Since you\u2019re the one who wished for it, I will first destroy your cultivation and then make you suffer a living death where dying is a luxury!\u201d Liu Wei glared furiously; suddenly, his palm struck out towards Huang Xiaolong, Marshal Haotian, and Fei Hou at once .\u201cI\u2019m going to let you experience my Big Sword Sect\u2019s masterpiece godly palm skill!\u201d\u201cDark Golden Big Palm!\u201dThree huge golden palm prints pierced through the air and reached Huang Xiaolong, Marshal Haotian, and Fei Hou in an instant . Coincidentally, Su Yan came out from the courtyard at this time and saw what was happening; scared, she cried out: \u201cXiaolong!\u201dOn the other hand, Huang Ming, Huang Jun, and Huang Wei were secretly jumping with joy, especially Huang Wei . His eyes were gleaming with a feeling of schadenfreude; Huang Xiaolong ah Huang Xiaolong, I\u2019ll see how miserably you will die!Watching the golden-colored palm nearly strike the three people, a silhouette flashed and deflected Liu Wei\u2019s attack with one hand .\u201cRumble~!\u201dA loud explosion thundered and the energy from the impact scattered in all four directions . The stones and pavements around were shattered into gravel and dust, swirling up and flying away in the air; Huang Ming, Huang Qide, and the rest ran away in panic .And the Big Sword Sect\u2019s Sect Leader Liu Wei staggered back with unsteady steps from the rebound of energy . With every step back, the stone pavement underneath his foot cracked into pieces .Liu Wei retreated to a corner before managing to balance himself . At this time, he finally saw clearly the person who made the move just now, and it was not Fei Hou . A shocked expression was plastered on Liu Wei\u2019s face, looking at Marshal Haotian: \u201cYou, you\u2019re a Xiantian!\u201dThis person, like Fei Hou following behind Huang Xiaolong, was wearing a close-fitting robe and looked like an old man in his seventies, yet he was actually a Xiantian realm expert! That strength of his\u2026!Xiantian Second Order! Definitely a Second Order Xiantian!After overcoming his shock, Liu Wei\u2019s face was ugly to the extreme . Despite being a Xiantian himself, he had just advanced not too long ago . It was a huge gap to fight against a Second Order Xiantian!Huang Ming, Huang Jun, Huang Wei, Huang Qide and Chen Ying, as well as Su Yan, who just came out of the courtyard, stared stupidly at Marshal Haotian .Xiantian, actually a Xiantian realm expert!Same as Fei Hou, this old man, the Xiantian expert, called Huang Xiaolong \u2018Young Master\u2019 . Moreover, he was a higher order Xiantian realm compared to Liu Wei!\u201cThis, this, how is this possible!\u201d Huang Wei stammered .Huang Ming and Huang Jun felt a strong sense of unease and fear after realizing what was happening .\u201cWho are you?!\u201d Liu Wei looked at Marshal Haotian with an ugly expression; there was only so many Xiantian experts in the Luo Tong Kingdom . This seventy-year-old man cannot be a nameless person .Marshal Haotian flew up in silence, ignoring Liu Wei, and a long halberd appeared in his hand out of nowhere . It cut down on Liu Wei without mercy .\u201cHeaven\u2019s Wrath!\u201dCountless halberd images rained down like falling meteors upon Liu Wei in a blink of an eye . Terrified, Liu Wei retreated to avoid them and suddenly, his hands grew bigger, turning into a golden color . At the same instant, a long sword appeared behind him . It was a very long sword as if it was composed of dozens of small swords creating a whip-like long sword .Liu Wei\u2019s martial spirit is called Nine Joint Swords!Nine Joint Swords was a top grade eleven martial spirit .With his martial spirit out, Liu Wei waved his hands and the Nine Joint Swords became a sword as long as a dragon, constantly rotating around his body while lights of sword rays shot out clashing against Marshal Haotian\u2019s halberd attack .\u201cZheng! Zheng! Zheng!\u201dA series of collision rang sharply in the air .Every time it clashed, Liu Wei\u2019s body would tremble and stagger backward a step .While Liu Wei was struggling below, up above in midair, a gigantic black lion emerged behind Marshal Haotian; a black lion with dark blue pupils . You could even see a terrifying breath break out from its mouth as black fog rolled like dark clouds .Seeing the emergence of the black lion, Liu Wei\u2019s body quivered, and a thought flashed across his brain . In shock, Liu Wei blurted out, \u201cYou, you are Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s Marshal Haotian!\u201dIn the whole of Luo Tong Kingdom, only Marshal Haotian\u2019s martial spirit is a Dark Nether Lion .\u201cMarshal Haotian!\u201d Huang Ming, Huang Jun, Huang Wei, Huang Qide, and Su Yan felt like a lightning bolt struck their minds when they heard that, leaving an endless hum what would not go away . Their eyes practically popped out looking at the tight-fitting robe old man; this old man is\u00a0the\u00a0Marshal Haotian of the Luo Tong Kingdom . The Marshal Haotian that stands above thousands of soldiers and generals and under one king!Ignoring the expression around him, Marshal Haotian\u2019s silhouette flashed and reappeared in front of Liu Wei . The long halberd swung out and the Dark Nether Lion roared towards the sky as it moved above Liu Wei\u2019s head; two paws slamming down on Liu Wei akin to two massive black pillars .\u201cNine Joint Sword Array!\u201d Liu Wei shouted in fear . The Nine Joint Sword martial spirit flew up to the sky, from one long sword turning into nine shorter swords to form a nine swords array against the Dark Nether Lion . Whereby his two fists punched at Marshal Haotian .\u201cBoom!\u201d a loud explosion rang out .And Liu Wei\u2019s screamed sounded as his body were thrown back, crashing into a wall far back close to the Eastern Courtyard .From the beginning, Marshal Haotian\u2019s strength was a level higher than him; his beast martial spirit\u2019s attack power was way higher than his Nine Joint Swords . How was Liu Wei Marshal Haotian\u2019s opponent!Huang Ming, Huang Jun, and Huang Wei looked at Liu Wei who was stuck into the walls and a cold shiver ran pass their hearts down to their toes .___________________________________________________________________________________Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Nine Joint Sword regroup once again before Liu Wei, turning into a dragon long sword . After breaking free from the rubbles, he jumped onto the long-sword and the dragon long sword shot out . Liu Wei actually wanted to flee!\u201cWant to run?\u201d Seeing his actions, Marshal Haotian sneered . His martial spirit, the Dark Nether Lion, returned to his side and soul transformed in an instant showing a dazzling dark light that glowed three meters wide as a strong energy whirled forth from Marshal Haotian .Marshal Haotian looked at Liu Wei with cold eyes; suddenly, he opened his mouth and roared towards Liu Wei in midair .\u201cNether Lion\u2019s Nine Roars!\u201dA dark, black giant of a lion appeared in the air out of nowhere and raised its head and roared mightily . A roar that shook the sky; Huang Ming, Huang Qide, and the rest felt their eardrums buzz, temporarily losing their hearing .This was Marshal Haotian\u2019s Dark Nether Lion martial spirit\u2019s supernatural ability .Under the terrified eyes of the people below, the soundwaves of the roar continued to spread out further, one after another like a hurricane storm, and quickly caught up to Liu Wei who was running away by flight on his long sword .Liu Wei\u2019s head turned around, and what he saw made his pupils grow smaller with fear .\u201cBoom!\u201dThe sound waves struck Liu Wei; Liu Wei felt akin to being ripped by a hurricane, his body startled and thrown off ruthlessly down towards the ground . Coincidentally, Liu Wei fell on a fake mountain decoration in one of the small gardens and under his weight, it was crushed and the fake mountain crumbled and pieces of stones flew in all directions .One roar to \u2018shoot\u2019 down Liu Wei . Marshal Haotian flashed and almost instantly reappeared in the small garden Liu Wei crashed into, and just when Liu Wei managed to crawl up, a halberd swung out . Liu Wei dodged the attack in a panic and although he successfully avoided getting hit in his vital points, the halberd still slashed through his shoulder .Marshal Haotian pulled out his halberd and warm blood spurted out like a fountain from Liu Wei\u2019s shoulder . Liu Wei\u2019s body became unstable from the injury and his body wobbled as he staggered backward .\u201cYou!\u201d Liu Wei looked at Marshal Haotian full of fear in his eyes . He wanted to say more, but Marshal Haotian already closed in on him and a palm print struck on Liu Wei\u2019s chest .Liu Wei felt as if his internal organs shattered within .Both of Marshal Haotian\u2019s hands curled into claws that clasped on Liu Wei and flew towards Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou\u2019s direction .\u201cYoung Master, this Liu Wei, how should I handle him?\u201d Marshal Haotian flung Liu Wei down, and Liu Wei\u2019s body rolled before Huang Xiaolong\u2019s feet .Until now, Liu Wei\u2019s once clean robe was stained with patches of his own blood, dirt, and messy hair . No longer was he the image of a proud and arrogant, almighty, overlooking Sect Leader .Liu Wei wiped off the blood from his face, staring at Huang Xiaolong while sniggering in a belittling manner, \u201cPunk, I am Big Sword Sect\u2019s Sect Leader, you dare to kill me?\u201dHuang Xiaolong sneered instead and said to Marshal Haotian: \u201cFirst, waste his Qi Sea!\u201dLiu Wei\u2019s face became ugly to the extreme\u2013 to a Xiantian realm expert, the Qi Sea was where battle qi accumulates . If the Qi Sea was destroyed, it meant a person\u2019s cultivation was being destroyed!Even if he wanted to repair his Qi Sea in the future, there are no methods that can do so .\u201cPunk, you dare!\u201d Liu Wei roared furiously, glaring at Huang Xiaolong, \u201cif you dare to destroy my Qi Sea, the experts of Big Sword Sect will surely come out in droves to annihilate your entire Huang Clan Manor!\u201dHuang Xiaolong remained indifferent at the threat and his eyes gaze fell on Marshal Haotian .\u201cYes, Young Master!\u201d Marshal Haotian understood Huang Xiaolong\u2019s meaning and acknowledged respectfully . One palm aimed at Liu Wei\u2019s heart and struck down; Xiantian experts\u2019 Qi Sea is located where the heart is .\u201cBang!\u201d\u201cPa!\u201dA soft blast sound could be heard coming out from Liu Wei\u2019s heart area, akin to a burst balloon . Liu Wei let out an excruciating scream, his body rolling on the ground from the pain, banging against the garden marble stone table not far away .Grabbing onto the table, Liu Wei struggled to stand up and he became crazy and shrieked at the top of his lungs, \u201cMy Qi Sea! You wasted my Qi Sea!\u201d He howled towards the heavens, bloodshot eyes staring with insanity and venomous hatred at Huang Xiaolong and Marshal Haotian and he screamed: \u201cYou will regret this, you\u2019ll regret everything that you\u2019ve done today!\u201d\u201cRegret?\u201d Huang Xiaolong came up to Liu Wei, his hands bent into claws of all of sudden and grasped onto Liu Wei\u2019s two arms, and twisted them forcefully . \u201cPa!\u201d Sounds of bones breaking resounded as Huang Xiaolong broke both of Liu Wei\u2019s arms .After Liu Wei\u2019s Qi Sea was destroyed, he no longer has cultivation . Thus, even in front a peak late-Sixth Order Huang Xiaolong, he has no power to resist .The Big Sword Sect was one of Baolong Kingdom\u2019s powerful sect, and him, as Big Sword Sect\u2019s Sect Leader, when has he ever been humiliated in such a manner?\u00a0He, a Xiantian realm expert\u2019s arms were actually twisted broken by a ten-year-old boy!In pain, but it only increased the perniciousness in his eyes, wishing he could swallow Huang Xiaolong in one go, \u201cI want to kill you, you little doggie!\u201d When he shouted that, Fei Hou\u2019s palm slapped his left cheek, directly slapping Liu Wei away . By the time Liu Wei landed on the ground again, his left face was swollen like a pig .Huang Jun, Huang Ming, Huang Wei, Huang Qide, and Chen Ying dared not move; they watched Marshal Haotian waste Liu Wei\u2019s Qi Sea, watched both of Liu Wei\u2019s arms get miserably twisted and broken by Huang Xiaolong, and their hearts were full of dread and shivering with fear . Especially Huang Jun, Huang Ming, and Huang Wei, this trio of father and sons . Each of their faces was deathly pale, cold like they have fallen into thousands meters of an icy abyss, their bodies started shaking uncontrollably .Liu Wei exerted the last effort to stand up, and this time, there was no longer viciousness in his eyes but dread .\u201cHuang Xiaolong, you, spare me\u2026 As long as you let me go, I can guarantee my Big Sword Sect will not pursue this matter, and will not exact revenge on Huang Clan Manor . \u201d Liu Wei begged, his voice hoarse .\u201cWill not exact revenge?\u201d Huang Xiaolong stood before him and shook his head . The Blades of Asura were already in his hands .Seeing the blades in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s hands, Liu Wei convulsed with fear: \u201cI beg, beg you, don\u2019t kill me, don\u2019t kill me . Huang Xiaolong, don\u2019t kill me, whatever you want, I can promise you!!!!\u201dHuang Xiaolong\u2019s expression was cold, \u201cIsn\u2019t it a little too late to be saying this now? You shouldn\u2019t have acted that way from the beginning . When you injured my father two days ago, you should have expected such an ending!\u201d\u201cNo, don\u2019t kill me, don\u2019t kill me!\u201d Liu Wei could feel the killing intent exuding from Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body . In a moment of fear and panic, Liu Wei actually knelt down: \u201cYou cannot kill me, I, I am a Xiantian warrior, you can\u2019t kill me!\u201dXiantian warrior?The blades in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s hands swung horizontally, and two sharp blades lights slashed across space, drawing two red lines on Liu Wei\u2019s throat . Looking down, both of Liu Wei\u2019s hands were clutching at his own neck as he tumbled face down . Blood spilled from the neck through the gaps of his fingers and stained the ground dark red .Big Sword Sect Sect Leader, Xiantian realm expert Liu Wei, drew his last breath!Liu Wei\u2019s corpse laid there with eyes wide-opened . Perhaps, he never thought this ordinary trip to the Luo Tong Kingdom would become a trip that ended his life . Even more ridiculous was the fact that he actually died from the hands of a ten-year-old little kid .Huang Xiaolong glanced at the stiffening corpse on the ground, and then he turned around, his eyes on Huang Jun, Huang Ming, and Huang Wei not far away .Noticing Huang Xiaolong had turned his attention on them, the trio of father and sons\u2019 hearts nearly jumped out of their mouths and their faces ashened .\u201cXiaolong, Eldest Uncle was wrong, Eldest Uncle knows now!\u201d Suddenly, Huang Ming got down on his knees and knelt before Huang Xiaolong, crying out \u201cFor your Dad\u2019s sake, spare us, let us three father and sons off this once!\u201d\u201cYes ah, Xiaolong . We were confused for a moment!\u201d Huang Jun followed his father and got down on his knees . \u201cPlease have mercy and let us go, we don\u2019t dare do this again in the future . As long as you agree to let us go, we will leave Huang Clan Manor immediately .

Till this point, still, he dares to oppose that \u2018doggie\u2019 Huang Xiaolong, isn\u2019t he tired of living?!A cold light flashed across Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes as he watched Huang Wei .Huang Qide who has been standing at one side chose to interject at this time . He looked pleadingly at Huang Xiaolong and said, \u201cXiaolong, Huang Wei is still young and na\u00efve . Grandfather beg you, for your Father\u2019s sake, spare them! Grandfather guarantees, this kind of thing will never happen again in the future!\u201dSu Yan was standing close by and heard everything but she did not say anything .Then, all of a sudden, sounds of weak footsteps could be heard coming from the inner courtyard and the heavily injured Huang Peng was exerting every effort for each step was seen coming out with the help of a servant .Even inside, Huang Peng could hear the blasts from Liu Wei and Marshal Haotian\u2019s battle, and due to his worry about his son, he stubbornly insisted to go out of his room to look at the situation, disregarding his own damaged body .The first thing he saw coming out was Liu Wei\u2019s body lying on the ground with blood still flowing out from his neck . However, there was no breath left .Liu Wei, Big Sword Sect Sect Leader, was already dead?!Huang Peng was greatly shocked, finding it hard to believe .Liu Wei is a Xiantian realm expert, yet in the end, he was killed . Who was the one who killed him?!\u201cPeng Ge, why did you come out?!\u201d Seeing Huang Peng, Su Yan asked with worry as she quickly ran to his side and held his arms .Huang Peng shook his head, insisting \u201cI\u2019m okay . \u201d Then, he came to Huang Xiaolong\u2019s side, watching his Big Brother Huang Ming, Huang Jun, and Huang Wei kneeling in front of Huang Xiaolong . Although he doesn\u2019t know what exactly took place, he could guess more or less what happened .\u201cHuang Peng, you tell Xiaolong to spare them . Huang Ming and his sons know their mistakes!\u201d Huang Qide quickly said when he saw Huang Peng coming over .Huang Peng\u2019s head turns towards his son, saying \u201cXiaolong, why don\u2019t you spare them?\u201dTo Huang Peng, Huang Xiaolong said, \u201cDad, you ask me to let them go, but two days ago, did they spare you? When Liu Wei injured you, did Grandfather tell Huang Ming to spare you?!\u201d Huang Xiaolong pointed a finger at Huang Qide, at that time, Huang Qide did not speak up for Huang Peng, telling Huang Ming to spare his parents at all!\u201cJust now, when Liu Wei said he wanted to waste my cultivation, did Grandfather beg Huang Ming or anyone of them to spare me?\u201d Huang Xiaolong continued, his cold eyes staring at Huang Qide .If not for the coincidence that he brought Marshal Haotian back with him this time, then, the one who died would absolutely be Fei Hou!And he would be turned into a waste and a cripple!Huang Ming, Huang Jun, and Huang Wei will think of many means to torture him; like what Liu Wei stated earlier, death is better than living and death would be a luxury .Listening to the questions coming from Huang Xiaolong, Huang Qide\u2019s head bowed down in shame and no words would come out from his mouth . \u00a0Huang Ming and Huang Jun also looked down silence .Huang Peng sighed, and said, \u201cXiaolong, even so, forgive them this time . \u201d\u201cFine, I won\u2019t kill them . \u201d Since his Dad pleaded for them, he couldn\u2019t bear to let his father be disappointed . His cold gaze fell on the trio of father and sons; Huang Ming, Huang Jun, and Huang Wei . \u201cCall for the Huang Clan\u2019s Elder council and we\u2019ll decide this matter according to Huang Clan Manor\u2019s rules!\u201dDecide according to Huang Clan Manor\u2019s rules!Huang Ming, Huang Jun, and Huang Wei were secretly relieved in their hearts . However, their faces also turned a shade paler at the same time .According to Huang Clan Manor\u2019s rules, colluding with outsiders to injure brothers of the clan would be punished by having their cultivation destroyed and being expelled out of Huang Clan Manor!Night arrived .Snow continued to fall .Huang Xiaolong stood in his small yard staring at the dark night sky, letting the snow to fall on his body .Earlier in the afternoon, Grandfather Huang Qide called for the Elder\u2019s Council, and as per the rules of Huang Clan Manor dealt with Huang Ming, Huang Jun, and Huang Wei .But, during the meeting, his Dad once again pleaded for his Eldest Uncle and in the end, only the three\u2019s cultivation were destroyed, but they still remained in Huang Clan Manor .It was Grandfather Huang Qide who instructed the Chief Steward, Chen Ying to do the act .The council meeting, Huang Xiaolong did not join, he knew because just moments ago, Su Yan came over and told him the results .At this point, Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou came behind Huang Xiaolong .\u201cSovereign, this matter, please don\u2019t blame the Second Manor Lord . After all, that Huang Ming is your Eldest Uncle . \u201d Marshal Haotian comforted .Huang Xiaolong nodded: \u201cI understand . \u201d Despite Huang Ming treating Huang Peng that way, his father still pleaded for them . Huang Xiaolong did not blame his father in the slightest .Minutes later, Huang Xiaolong left the small yard with Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou, and the three of them went to Huang Peng\u2019s room .Both his father and mother were present in the room .After undergoing the treatment from Huang Xiaolong using the Body Metamorphose Scripture\u2019s internal force, Huang Peng\u2019s injury had healed a lot, and he was no longer confined to the bed .\u201cXiaolong!\u201d Huang Peng and Su Yan seeing Huang Xiaolong walk in with Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou, both of them stood up in a haste .\u201cGreeting Lord Marshal!\u201d Then, Huang Peng and Su Yan nodded in greeting at Marshal Haotian .By this time, Huang Peng already knew Marshal Haotian\u2019s identity .\u201cNo, no!\u201d Seeing Huang Peng and Su Yan greeted him ceremoniously, Marshal Haotian was a little flustered and he hurried up to hold both Huang Peng and Su Yan . Looking at the two, he smiled bitterly, \u201cIn the future, just call me and Fei Hou by name . Both of us are Young Master\u2019s Subordinates, we dare not receive such big greetings from the Second Manor Lord and Madam!\u201dWhat Marshal Haotian said was the truth; although he is Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s only Marshal, above thousands of soldiers and under one King, before Huang Xiaolong, he is but a Subordinate .Despite Marshal Haotian\u2019s words, Huang Peng and Su Yan still dared not call Marshal Haotian by his name .This was their Luo Tong Kingdom one and only Marshal Haotian ah!If this was in the past, they did not even have the qualifications to greet Marshal Haotian .Moments later, all of them were seated .Before Huang Peng and Su Yan\u2019s eyes, Huang Xiaolong took out twenty cycad fruits .\u201cThis, this is cycad fruit!\u201d Two pairs of eyes were widened in surprised .Huang Xiaolong smiled and nodded, \u201cYes, these twenty cycad fruits were something son found by luck . Dad, Mom, both of you take these cycad fruits and cultivate . \u201dBoth Huang Peng and Su Yan were about to open their mouth to decline, but Huang Xiaolong was a second faster than them . Shaking his head, Huang Xiaolong said \u201cNo need to say anything, I have taken quite a number of cycad fruits . Furthermore, I still have some more of them . \u201dTherefore, Huang Peng and Su Yan could only keep the cycad fruits .Just when both of them were elated by the cycad fruits, Huang Xiaolong took out two small bottles and to Huang Peng and Su Yan, he said the following: \u201cDad, Mom, this one is a high grade Grade Four Spirit Dan, Xingyao Dan, whereas this one is a high Grade Five Spirit Dan, Qi Sea Dan . Take it . \u201dHigh Grade Four Spirit Dan, Xingyao Dan!High Grade Five Spirit Dan, Qi Sea Dan!Huang Peng and Su Yan trembled, looking at their son with an inconceivable expression .\u201cXiao, Xiaolong, you, you say, inside these two bottles are\u2026?\u201d Huang Peng was tongue-tied, stammering as he tried to try to ask Huang Xiaolong .Huang Xiaolong chuckled, \u201cThat\u2019s right . Actually, I am a Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s student . This time in the Academy\u2019s competition I won the First Year category and was rewarded with this Xingyao Dan .

Where the entire Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s most talented juniors gathered! Their son was actually a Cosmic Star Academy student; not only that, Xiaolong was the First Year Champion and was given a high Grade Five Spirit Dan from the Principal . What does this mean? Both of them were well aware; this news, however, came too much of a sudden, and it was too shocking and too unbelievable to the point that both of them weren\u2019t able to accept it all at the same time .After what seemed like a very long time, Huang Peng and Su Yan gradually recovered from their shock and excitement; exchanging a look between themselves, Huang Peng shook his head mentally:\u00a0this son, neither of them could see through him anymore .Before it was a peak late-Tenth Order Fei Hou following his son, calling him Young Master, and now, even more shocking was the Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s Marshal Haotian also following his son, becoming their son\u2019s subordinate .On top of that, he had become a student of the Cosmic Star Academy, and he was the First Year\u2019s number one student, and he was gifted a high Grade Five Spirit Dan for no reason and at no cost!Everything that happened made them unable to see through the mysteries surrounding their son .At last, they could only accept the two bottles containing Xingyao Dan and Qi Sea Dan .Holding the one dan each in their hands, they don\u2019t know whether they should be excited or happy .However, after they have calmed down and accepted the two dans, Huang Xiaolong once again took out two sets of manual, saying \u201cThis is a set of an Earth rank cultivation technique and a battle skill . \u201d\u201cWhat? Earth rank cultivation technique and battle skill!\u201d The newly recovered Huang Peng and Su Yan were once again struck dizzy .Earth rank!A buzz continued to resound in their brains .A long time later, they gradually calmed down .Taking the Earth rank cultivation technique and battle skill, both were already speechless .\u201cDad, Mom, after the New Year two days later, move to the Luo Tong Royal City with me . \u201d Huang Xiaolong\u2019s voice was serious and low .\u201cTo the Luo Tong Royal City? This\u2026\u201d Huang Peng and Su Yan were surprised at their son\u2019s abrupt suggestion and hesitated .\u201cDue to Liu Wei\u2019s death, Huang Clan Manor is no longer safe . Moreover, I bought a mansion in the Royal City . \u201d Huang Xiaolong said . Very soon, the Big Sword Sect will know that Liu Wei was killed by him; if his parents and siblings remained in Huang Clan Manor, it is certainly not safe .Both Huang Peng and Su Yan knew the seriousness of the matter, and they had no conflict in moving to the Royal City; it\u2019s just that they have been living in Huang Clan Manor for so long, especially Huang Peng\u2013 from the moment he was born, he had always been here .\u201cThen, your Grandfather?\u201d When Huang Peng mentioned this, Huang Xiaolong decisively shook his head: \u201cNot possible, Dad . There is no need to bring this matter up anymore . \u201dHuang Peng sighed in his heart; initially, he had wanted to ask his son to bring his father together with them .But he knew it was impossible for his son to bring Grandfather Huang Qide along . Although his son did not kill Huang Ming and his sons, it doesn\u2019t mean Xiaolong had forgiven them . It was because he pleaded for mercy that Xiaolong let the matter be handled according to Huang Clan Manor\u2019s rules .Father Huang Qide had always been partial towards Huang Ming\u2019s side, and Huang Peng is aware that is was not possible for his son to forgive his father, Huang Qide .Huang Peng could already imagine the scene after they left for the Royal City .The arrival of Big Sword Sect\u2019s experts descending onto Huang Clan Manor; Liu Wei dying in Huang Clan Manor, and that meant Huang Clan Manor would not be able to escape Big Sword Sect\u2019s wrath . \u00a0From top to bottom, the manor would be\u2026 . !!Huang Peng was struggling in his heart .Two days came and went .The New Year is here .Cold snow was falling outside while the Eastern Courtyard was in a lively mood; little sister, Huang Min, and his little brother, Huang Xiaohai, were pestering for Huang Xiaolong to play with them .Even though Huang Min suffered a kick from Huang Wei, her injury was lighter than Huang Peng\u2019s . And after treatment from Huang Xiaolong, she was almost completely healed .This New Year was one of the happiest New Year ever for the two little guys .The warmth and liveliness in the Eastern Courtyard was the complete opposite from the rest of Huang Clan Manor that was drowned in an eerie silence, especially the Northern Courtyard as if it was cursed with a dead atmosphere .The New Year ended quickly .On the Third Day of New Year, Huang Xiaolong brought his parents, and siblings away from Huang Clan Manor, heading to the Luo Tong Royal City .When they were leaving, Huang Peng brought along seven to eight guards and servants; these guards and servants followed Huang Peng since he was little, and all of them were undoubtedly loyal .Towards this, Huang Xiaolong has no objections .\u201cBig Brother, is there really a lot a lot of fun places in the Royal City?\u201d On the road, Huang Min asked Huang Xiaolong . When the two little guys found out that they were going to the Royal City, both were jumping with joy . All the way, both were chattering nonstop .\u201cThe Royal City is a fun place . \u201d Huang Xiaolong smiled and said .\u201cBig Brother, do we need to go back to Huang Clan Manor in the future?\u201d Huang Xiaohai asked .This year, Huang Xiaohai reached the age of seven and had already gone through the martial spirit awakening ceremony . His talent was good, possessing a top grade eight martial spirit .\u201cWhat about you, do you want to go back to Huang Clan Manor?\u201d Instead of answering, Huang Xiaolong asked smilingly .\u201cI never want to go back to Huang Clan Manor!\u201d Huang Xiaohai shook his head vigorously: \u201cI don\u2019t want to see that jerk Huang Wei again!\u201dHuang Peng and Su Yan remained mum on this topic .Because this time Huang Xiaolong was traveling with his family, the speed of their journey was quite slow, using six days to travel out of Canglan County .At the speed they were moving, it would take at least a month for them to reach Luo Tong Royal City .As they left Canglan County, Marshal Haotian informed Huang Xiaolong; Huang Qide, Huang Ming, and the clan moved away from the manor, leaving Huang Clan Manor behind .Huang Xiaolong nodded .This was within his expectation .Huang Qide was afraid Big Sword Sect will vent their wrath on Huang Clan Manor, so he would surely move Huang Clan away to a safer place .Very quickly, twenty days had passed in the journey .In the entire journey, no one felt dull with Huang Min and Huang Xiaohai \u2018twittering\u2019 all the way; due to the many days spent together, Huang Min, Huang Xiaohai, and the little violet monkey grew familiar, the three often horsed around together .One day, deep into the quiet night .Huang Xiaolong was resting in a spot of open place near a forest .Everyone gathered around the bonfire, and hanging above the bonfire was the Sandyfern Beast and its fragrant smell wafted around from roasting the meat . Huang Min, Huang Xiaohai, and the little violet monkey were very well-behaved, waiting obediently at the side with saliva drooling from their mouths as big, round eyes stared fixedly on the piece of roasting meat . Fire glowed and casted an orangey-red shadow over his parents\u2019 silhouette .Watching this scene, a burst of warmth filled Huang Xiaolong\u2019s heart .At this time, Marshal Haotian suddenly came behind Huang Xiaolong, and in a low voice whispered: \u201cYoung Master, Subordinate has something to report about the Huang Clan Manor . \u201dHuang Xiaolong stood up and walked some distance away from the bonfire, more than a dozen meters away to be exact .\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Huang Xiaolong asked .\u201cYoung Master, Subordinate just received a report saying Big Sword Sect has found Huang Qide and the rest . \u201d Marshal Haotian relayed honestly, \u201cHuang Qide is dead, Huang Ming, Huang Jun, and Huang Wei were also killed off by people from Big Sword Sect . \u201dHuang Xiaolong was silent for a moment, and then nodded: \u201cI know . \u201d After saying that, he turned around, returning to the bonfire .\u201cXiaolong, what is it?\u201d Huang Peng asked as if already he already guessed the outcome .Huang Xiaolong nodded, \u201cHaotian just reported that the people of the Huang Clan Manor was found by the Big Sword Sect . \u201d Regarding this matter, Huang Xiaolong did not want to hide it from his father .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Neither of them understood the real meaning of Huang Xiaolong\u2019s words when he said Big Sword Sect had found the Huang Clan Manor\u2019s people .The group of guards and servants who followed Huang Peng from Huang Clan Manor were also looking sad .\u201cXiaolong, promise Father, you must destroy the Big Sword Sect!\u201d A long time later, Huang Peng spoke and his voice choked and sounded a little hoarse .\u201cDon\u2019t worry Dad . I will . \u201d Huang Xiaolong nodded his head in promise, not for Huang Ming and his sons, but for his parents and little siblings .He absolutely would not allow the existence of Big Sword Sect to threaten his parents\u2019 and siblings\u2019 safety .\u201cBig Brother, is the roast meat ready? \u00a0Can we eat?\u201d At this point, little Huang Xiaohai inquired, breaking the stuffy atmosphere; his stomach obediently collaborated him, issuing a \u2018gululu\u2019 rumbling sound, \u201cMy stomach is already flat from hunger!\u201dHuang Xiaolong chuckled, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s eat!\u201d\u201cYeahhhhh!\u201d When the two little guys heard their Big Brother\u2019s permission, both jumped with joy .The night gradually became brighter . Huang Xiaolong and his group had started their journey for the day .And two days later, they arrived at the Luo Tong Royal City\u2019s big gates .Standing before the big gates leading to the Royal City, Huang Peng, Su Yan, the two little guys, and the rest of the group were in a daze . The big city gates gave the new arrivals a strong visual impact .\u201cBig Brother, this is our Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s Royal City? Very, very, very big ah!\u201d A long time later, little brother Huang Xiaohai chirped exaggeratedly, using three \u2018very\u2019 in a sentence .Very big?!Watching his younger brother\u2019s cute reaction, Huang Xiaolong smiled .\u201cLet\u2019s go, enter the city . \u201d Huang Xiaolong laughed and said .Hearing this, the two little guys rushed in front of everyone else towards the city gates, competing with each other to see who would enter the city first .At first, the city guards wanted to block Huang Min and Huang Xiaohai\u2019s path, however, when they noticed Huang Xiaolong and Marshal Haotian coming up behind the two little brats, the guards instantly retreated to the side and knelt down on one knee .\u201cGreeting Lord Marshal Haotian!\u201dThese guards, of course, recognized Marshal Haotian .\u201cRise . \u201d Marshal Haotian nodded his head, allowing the city gate guards to stand up . The guards hastened to stand up and retreated to the side respectfully .Huang Xiaolong and his parents walked at the front, followed by Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou behind them, passing the city gates into the Royal City .Huang Min and Huang Xiaohai cheered, rushing through the gates and in the end, Huang Min won the race . Although Huang Xiaohai\u2019s talent was higher than Huang Min\u2019s, his martial spirit had just awakened not too long ago\u2013 how could he surpass Huang Min who had been cultivating battle qi for more than a year?The two little guys were panting heavily, wiping beads of sweat from their foreheads .And while the two little guys were wiping off sweats from their little running competition, the city guards were wiping off cold sweat from their own foreheads from the ordeal .\u201cWho is that kid? To actually have Marshal Haotian walking behind him?\u201d\u201cYou surely don\u2019t know this since you just arrived in the Royal City a few days ago . It\u2019s normal that you don\u2019t know\u2013 he is Huang Xiaolong!\u201d\u201cHuang Xiaolong? Who is Huang Xiaolong?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dIn the time the city guards were gossiping among themselves, Huang Xiaolong and his group disappeared from view .Entering the Royal City, strolling in the bustling, wide city streets, Huang Min and Huang Xiaohai ran all around . Sometimes looking at some stalls on the right, and then to the left, they were extremely excited and happy .Even the little violet monkey on Huang Xiaolong\u2019s shoulder ran down to join the two little guys, running here and there, laughing happily .Watching his little sister and brother playing, Huang Xiaolong also felt happy .After strolling for an hour or so, when they passed by the Delicious Restaurant, Huang Xiaolong suddenly stopped . Turning around to Huang Peng and Su Yan, he inquired, \u201cDad, Mom, how about we go in and eat something?\u201dHuang Xiaolong remembered the first time he came to the Royal City, when he was here with Fei Hou . The dishes and the Snow Moon Wine of this restaurant were quite good .Before Huang Peng or Su Yan could answer, the little violet monkey was already clapping and squeaking in agreement, greedily smacking his lips as if its saliva was about to fly out . Obviously, it still remembered the taste of the Snow Moon Wine .Seeing this, Huang Peng Su Yan nodded and everyone broke out in laughter due to the little violet monkey\u2019s antics .Thus, they went into the restaurant . The one attending to Huang Xiaolong was the same server as last time . Seeing Huang Xiaolong, the little server\u2019s eyes lit up and hurried to welcome Huang Xiaolong, full of respect .Though it has been a year, the little server\u2019s memory of Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou was very deep .At that time, the Delicious Restaurant was nearly demolished, how could he forget them otherwise?With respectful bows and pleasing smiles, the little server led Huang Xiaolong and his group up to the first floor of the restaurant .Soon after, Huang Xiaolong and the rest were seated, and the restaurant\u2019s boss came over, still short of breath as if he ran over from some distance away, sweat was pouring from his face .Quickly tidying his appearance, he came to Huang Xiaolong\u2019s table, and the boss saluted Marshal Haotian and personally arranged the dishes and wine for the two tables Huang Xiaolong\u2019s and his companions . The boss even took out the Snow Moon Wine that had been kept for more than a decade to serve them .The moment the Snow Moon Wine was placed on the table, and before anyone could make a move, the little violet monkey had already jumped onto one of the wine urns, lifted it up, and started to drink greedily . It let out a loud burp after it was satisfied, making people break out in laughter all around .As the food and wine were served up, a tantalizing fragrance weaved in the air, causing the two little guys to drool . Chopsticks shot out frequently as sounds of utensils and cups moved .When everyone was enjoying the meal, a pair consisting of a young man and a young woman came up the second floor . Judging from their attitude, they were regular patrons of the Delicious Restaurant .Huang Xiaolong took a glance at them from the corner of his eyes, noting that both of them looked familiar . Then he remembered when he first arrived in the Royal City with Fei Hou, they were the Young Master and Young Miss Lin of the Marquis Mansion .He remembered at that time, this so-called Young Master Lin and Young Miss Lin were riding on Stage Four Flame Beasts entering the city . Of course, they need not pay entry fees at the city gates .Reaching the first floor of the restaurant, Lin Ke looked around and saw Huang Xiaolong\u2019s group occupying two large tables with two little kids that were eating noisily . Lin Ke frowned . She threw a bag of gold coins to the server behind her and pointed towards Huang Xiaolong\u2019s direction, and in a commanding tone, she said, \u201cThe entire first floor, I\u2019m reserving it . Drive out these lowly commoners, tell them to eat below . \u201dLowly commoners!People eating at the two tables, including Huang Xiaolong, stopped turned around .That server was dumbfounded .Lin Ke noticed the little server was in a daze and she snapped: \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I\u2019ve said? We are reserving this entire floor, drive these lowly-commoners down and tell them to eat on the floor below! Otherwise, they will affect our appetite!\u201dMarshal Haotian and Fei Hou\u2019s expression changed . Yet, when Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou wanted to stand up, Huang Xiaolong raised his hand to stop them .Huang Xiaolong waved at the little server, saying \u201cYou, come over . \u201dDespite being a different server than the one who welcomed Huang Xiaolong, and was not aware of Huang Xiaolong\u2019s identity, earlier the boss had instructed each of them to serve these two tables respectfully, and not show the slightest neglect . So, when the server heard Huang Xiaolong calling him, he scurried over without the slightest delay to Huang Xiaolong\u2019s side, inquiring \u201cYoung Noble, what are your orders?\u201dLike the other side, Huang Xiaolong threw out a big bag of gold coins to the server, and pointed at the two surnamed Lin, \u201cI don\u2019t want to see them in the Delicious Restaurant, drive them away from the restaurant to avoid them influencing my appetite!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This lowly commoner dared to say she is, is?!\u201cDid you not hear what I said clearly?\u201d Huang Xiaolong had an indifferent expression on his calm face .All of a sudden, loud footsteps were heard coming up the staircase and several guards appeared on the first floor .\u201cMiss, what is the matter?\u201d One of the guards walked up to Lin Ke and asked .These Marquis Mansion guards were initially waiting below and all of them rushed up quickly hearing their Young Miss\u2019s voice .\u201cThis lowly commoner actually dared to insult me! Go and slap him, hard!\u201d Lin Ke pointed at Huang Xiaolong and a cruel gleam flashed across her eyes: \u201cHit until all the teeth in his dog mouth fall out!\u201d\u201cIf anyone dares to interfere, they will be dealt with the same punishment!\u201d\u201cYes, Miss!\u201dThe dozen Marquis Mansion guards spread out and surrounded the two tables; one of them walked out, raising his hand and swept it down hard at Huang Xiaolong\u2019s face .The ex-Huang Clan Manor guards were ruffled seeing this and wanted to dash out, but a silhouette was faster than them, and moved before them . The Marquis Mansion guard that was about to slap Huang Xiaolong suddenly screamed\u2013 his body inverted outwards as if he was hit by a big boulder and tumbled heavily on the floor before rolling down the stairs to the first floor below .A short silence invaded the first floor space .The silhouette who made the move was Fei Hou .After a brief moment of surprised silence, all the Marquis Mansion guards were angered . All of them unsheathed the swords they were carrying and it was at this time Fei Hou snorted: \u201cScram!\u201d His voice rolled out like waves, and zigzag lightning materialized out of nowhere like a net . This was Fei Hou\u2019s Sound of Lightning Fall, a high grade Mysterious rank battle skill .The strongest amongst these Marquis Mansion Guards was a peak late-Seventh Order, and their abilities were insufficient to escape these lightning strikes . After these guards\u2019 bodies were struck, shaking and then inverting them out . By the time they fell to the floor, these guards were no longer recognizable; their bodies were charred soot black with gray smoke rising from them like burning charcoal .\u201cYou!!!\u201d Watching all the guards they brought being defeated, the expression on Lin Ke and Lin Guo\u2019s face was extremely ugly .\u201cSlap!\u201d Huang Xiaolong\u2019s cold voice sounded .\u201cYes, Young Master!\u201d Just as Fei Hou\u2019s voice ended, the right side of Lin Ke\u2019s was printed with a five fingers red mark .\u201cDo you lowly commoners knows who I am? Actually daring to touch me!\u201d Lin Ke was afraid yet furious too . One of her hands was covering the right side of her face as she glared hatefully at Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou, roaring at the top of her lungs .\u201cAgain!\u201d Huang Xiaolong\u2019s voice sounded once more .A deeper red five finger print appeared on Lin Ke\u2019s right cheek . Blood trickled from her mouth as she spat out a tooth .Lin Ke stared at the tooth rolling on the floor and went blanked for a moment . She let out a hair-raising shriek towards Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou, \u201cYou, you dared to hit me? You actually dared to hit me! You know who I am? I am the Marquis Mansion\u2019s Miss! My father is Marquis Lin Xian! I want to kill you lowly commoners, kill off every lowly dog commoners that you are!\u201d[tn: why ask when one of your teeth already all out?]\u201cAgain!\u201d Huang Xiaolong paid no attention .\u201cPa!! Pa!!\u201d Two sounds of slapping resounded in the quiet restaurant . This time, Lin Ke\u2019s body wobbled as both sides of her face had a burning red five finger mark; blood and a few teeth flew out from her mouth .\u201cYounger Sis, don\u2019t say anymore . Let\u2019s first return to the Marquis Mansion!\u201d Lin Guo who watched everything from the side was troubled and irked at the same time . He walked up and pulled Lin Ke away while trying to persuade . He had seen Huang Xiaolong\u2019s intentions; if his Little Sister continued her tirade, she probably would be leaving all her teeth here .Without waiting for Lin Ke\u2019s response, Lin Guo already pulled Lin Ke towards the staircase, fleeing as fast as he could .Watching Lin Guo dragging Lin Ke fleeing in panic, Huang Xiaolong sneered .Before Lin Ke disappeared, her face was full of dissatisfaction and hatred, and he trusts that this matter will not end here . If things happened within his expectations, after returning to the Marquis Mansion, the two would return here with a group of experts .The little server looked at Lin Guo and Lin Ke running away in a hurry, and then looked down at the floor that was littered with Marquis Mansion guards, his soul had flown away in shock . His reason returned after a while and he scurried off to report the matter to his boss .After Lin Guo and Lin Ke ran off, Huang Xiaolong and the others continued with their meal as if nothing happened .As for Lin Guo and Lin Ke, they returned to the Marquis Mansion soon after leaving the Delicious Restaurant .Lin Ke wailed all the way back to the Marquis Mansion, and both Lin Ke and Lin Guo stepped into the main hall . \u00a0Marquis Lin Xian was in a good mood, chatting with a middle-aged man . This middle-aged man was wearing army-issued armor, and there were a few shiny badges on his shoulder . This middle-aged man was one of Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s generals, General Hong Desheng .Lin Ke was crying as she walked into the main hall, and this startled Lin Xian and Hong Desheng, causing them to stop their discussions .When the two saw Hong Desheng in the main hall, they went up and greeted: \u201cUncle Hong . \u201d\u201cKe\u2019er, what happened? Who hurt you?\u201d Lin Xian saw the blood on his daughter's face and his face darkened .\u201cDad, Uncle Hong, you must seek justice for me!\u201d Lin Ke covered her face while crying, \u201cJust now in the Delicious Restaurant, a group of lowly dog commoners slapped my face! Even my tooth fell out!\u201d\u201cWuu\u2026wuuuu\u2026 . . wuu!\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d Lin Xian\u2019s face grew darker, a chilling light flashed across his eyes .\u201cWas there anything out of ordinary in that group of people?\u201d At this time, Hong Desheng suddenly asked .The three in the hall with him were flabbergasted at the question .\u201cBrother Hong, what are you trying to say?\u201d Lin Xian inquired .Hong Desheng explained, \u201cDo you still remember last year what happened in the Delicious Restaurant?\u201dLin Xian quivered from head to toe; last year, Duke Meng Chen and his son, Meng Xia, hurt Marshal Haotian\u2019s Junior Brother since they were relying on having more people . Later, Marshal Haotian rushed over to the restaurant and killed Meng Chen and Meng Xia to vent out his wrath . Although the incident was a year ago, how could Lin Xian forget? And the place where Meng Chen and Meng Xia were killed was at the Delicious Restaurant!Lin Ke and Lin Guo also remembered this incident and both turned a sickly shade of green and then they turned white .\u201cBrother Hong, such coincidences doesn\u2019t happen right?\u201d Lin Xian hesitated for a second before asking .\u201cIt is better to be safe than sorry . \u201d Hong Desheng said . He turned around towards Lin Ke and asked, \u201cWhat does the person who hurted you look like?\u201dLin Ke and Lin Guo described Fei Hou\u2019s facial features from memory one by one . Lin Xian and Hong Desheng\u2019s face became gloomier by the second, and when Lin Ke and Lin Guo finished, Hong Desheng sounded somber as he stated, \u201cI\u2019m afraid this person is Marshal Haotian\u2019s Junior Brother, Fei Hou!\u201dMarshal Haotian\u2019s Junior Brother, Fei Hou!Lin Ke and Lin Guo\u2019s faces lost all their color instantly .Suddenly, Hong Desheng thought of a question, asking \u201cBesides that Fei Hou, was there a man in his seventies?\u201d He even described how Marshal Haotian looked like to them .Lin Ke and Lin Guo tried to remember .But, at that time, Marshal Haotian sat with his back facing stairway, so it was inevitable they did not get a good look at everyone there .\u201cWe did not pay attention . \u201d Lin Ke added, \u201cThere was about fourteen, fifteen of them in total . Oh right, there was a kid about ten years old, but Fei Hou listened to his command, calling him Young Master, could he be\u2026 . ?!\u201d\u201cHuang Xiaolong!!\u201d Lin Xian and Hong Desheng blurted out the name in unison .Huang Xiaolong!Lin Ke and Lin Guo\u2019s bodies trembled, nearly stumbling down .Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s First Year champion, this name had long spread to every corner of the Royal City \u2013 Huang Xiaolong, possessing the Primordial Divine Black Dragon martial spirit . This was no longer a secret, and he was lauded to be the number one talent in Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s history .If that kid is Huang Xiaolong, then\u2026? The image where she was trashing Huang Xiaolong as a lowly dog commoner, even ordering her guards to slap Huang Xiaolong\u2019s mouth, her body couldn\u2019t stop shaking as if having an episode of epilepsy .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You think I don\u2019t know your personality?! If you were not in the wrong, you think that Fei Hou would act?!\u201d A palm flew across Lin Ke\u2019s face and another five finger palm print burned glaringly on her face .Lin Ke clutched at her face, looking dazedly at her father . Tears started to fall abruptly from her eyes . Since she was little, her father had always indulged her requests, as he was afraid to disappoint his daughter . But today, her father actually hit her!The more Lin Ke thought about it, the more wronged she felt, and the louder her wails rang out in the hall .\u201cYou!\u201d Lin Xian raised his hand once more in anger, but in the end, the hand dropped back down .\u201cBrother Lin, now is not the time to teach Ke\u2019er . Lin Guo, tell me exactly what happened . \u201d At this time, Hong Desheng advised Lin Xian, trying to salvage the situation .\u201cYes, Uncle Hong . \u201d Lin Guo replied respectfully and told his father and Uncle Hong what happened from the beginning to the end without the slightest intention to conceal anything . He didn\u2019t dare to .Lin Xian heard his son say that his daughter, Lin Ke, ordered the restaurant server to drive out Huang Xiaolong, Fei Hou, and the people with them the moment she stepped onto the first floor . Every sentence she said started and ended with \u2018lowly dog commoner\u2019, and he could no longer remain as calm as he wished .After Lin Guo finished describing the incident, Lin Xian\u2019s face was darker than muddy water .\u201cLet\u2019s do it like this Brother Lin\u2013 make a trip to the Delicious Restaurant to apologize to that Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou . I will accompany you there . \u201d Hong Desheng persuaded .The two of them were old buddies; since he was here, he couldn\u2019t just sit and watch without doing anything to help .Lin Xian\u2019s expression did not look better: \u201cIt seems this is the only way!\u201dMoments later, Lin Xian and Hong Desheng brought Lin Ke and Lin Guo to the Delicious Restaurant .And soon, the four of them came to the Delicious Restaurant\u2019s first floor where Huang Xiaolong\u2019s group was at . Lin Xian and Hong Desheng were about to speak when both of them noticed the figure sitting next to Huang Xiaolong; both of them stiffened and their footsteps halted abruptly . Their eyes bulged out .\u201cMar\u2013 Lord Marshal Haotian!\u201dAt this point of time, Marshal Haotian turned around at their voices .When they saw Marshal Haotian\u2019s face, Lin Xian and Hong Desheng felt their minds go blank with fear; both were turning pale in a heartbeat .Behind them were Lin Ke and Lin Guo . When both of them heard the words their father exclaimed out loud, their legs wobbled and went limp, nearly falling to the floor . No matter how they suppressed the fear, they couldn\u2019t stand properly .Initially, before they came over, Lin Xian and Hong Desheng were wishing for some good fortune\u2013 that Marshal Haotian was not present during that time . But now!!\u2026\u2026One hour later, Huang Xiaolong, Marshal Haotian, and the rest of the group left the Delicious Restaurant . After Huang Xiaolong left, Lin Xian, his children, and Hong Desheng also walked out of the restaurant looking dissolute and spiritless .No one knows what took place in that one hour\u2019s time .However, the next day morning, Lin Xian\u2019s Marquis title was rescinded and it was a Royal Edict made by King Lu Zhe himself .On Huang Xiaolong\u2019s side, after they left the restaurant, the group headed to Tianxuan Mansion . As they got nearer, Boli and the servants were waiting outside .\u201cBig Brother, this Tianxuan Mansion is our home from now on?\u201d Standing before the entrance of Tianxuan Mansion, little sister Huang Min asked with anticipation .Huang Xiaolong nodded and smiled, \u201cEn, Tianxuan Mansion is our home from now on . \u201dHuang Min and Huang Xiaohai bounced with delight at Huang Xiaolong\u2019s answer, racing each other inside .This made everyone break out in laughter .\u201cDad, Mom, let\u2019s go in . \u201d Huang Xiaolong said to Huang Peng and Su Yan .Both of them nodded, feeling comforted and pleased in their hearts .A while later, everyone went to the main hall and sat down .Huang Xiaolong requested Fei Hou to arrange the accommodation for his parents, siblings, and the servant-guards that followed Huang Peng from Huang Clan Manor . Before going back to Huang Clan Manor for the New Year, Huang Xiaolong gave Fei Hou a million gold coins to buy off the neighboring mansions . Thus, the current Tianxuan Mansion\u2019s lands had expanded by a factor of four and there were plenty of rooms .Due to fatigue from traveling for more than twenty days, Huang Xiaolong sent his parents and little siblings to rest .And only three people remained in the main hall: Huang Xiaolong, Marshal Haotian, and Fei Hou .\u201cWhat is the result of your investigation?\u201d Huang Xiaolong asked Marshal Haotian . A few days ago, he had requested Marshal Haotian to look into the Big Sword Sect\u2019s situation .Marshal Haotian stood up and answered respectfully, \u201cReplying Sovereign, the matter was already investigated clearly . At the moment, Big Sword Sect has around thirty thousand disciples, and apart from the dead Liu Wei, there is another Xiantian realm expert, and that is Liu Wei\u2019s Master, Yu Chen . Yu Chen is the previous Sect Leader; his strength should be mid-Second Order Xiantian . \u201dLiu Wei\u2019s Master, Yu Chen: a mid-Second Order Xiantian!Huang Xiaolong nodded; that means Yu Chen\u2019s strength is on par with Marshal Haotian .Then, Marshal Haotian continued to report the findings related to Big Sword Sect: the number of Tenth Order disciples, Ninth Order disciples, and so on .Listening to the end of Marshal Haotian\u2019s report, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s brows creased deeply . It seems to destroy the Big Sword Sect was not as easy as he first thought . Although Big Sword Sect only has one remaining Xiantian expert, Yu Chen, as one of the prominent sects of Baolong Kingdom, the number of Tenth Order and Ninth Order disciples were not insignificant .Moreover, he cannot let Marshal Haotian call up the army for this . If the army was used, it meant war between two kingdoms!If Yu Ming was around, with his Xiantian Tenth Order strength, it would be as easy as snapping his fingers to get rid of Big Sword Sect .Nonetheless, Yu Ming had returned to the Asura\u2019s Gate headquarters, and to rush back here from Star Cloud Continent, it takes at least a year\u2019s time .Judging from the situation, he needs to wait until Yu Ming returns before deciding the next step .Now, his parents and siblings are with him in the Royal City, and as long as that Yu Chen does not run over here, his parents and siblings would be safe with Marshal Haotian\u2019s protection .Some time later, Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou left the main hall .I must break through to the Seventh Order as soon as possible! Huang Xiaolong thought to himself .Once he advanced to the Seventh Order, he could open the Linglong Pagoda\u2019s first layer and get the heritage physique cultivation technique, Golden Linglong Body . In addition to his martial spirits abilities, he could fight against an Eighth Order warrior . Not only that, after opening the first layer of Linglong Treasure Pagoda, he could give the Fire Dragon Pearl to his parents .When his parents become stronger, the better they can protect themselves .Lastly, after he stepped into the Seventh Order, his martial spirits would evolve a second time, and Huang Xiaolong looked forward to his twin dragons\u2019 transformation .In general, after advancing to the Seventh Order, and after the martial spirit evolved a second time, its innate ability would also be strengthened . In some cases, martial spirits could gain new abilities after undergoing the second transformation!Although the probability for this to happen is very low, the higher the grade of martial spirits, the higher the probability for it to happen .Going back to his room, Huang Xiaolong climbed onto the cold jade bed, and called out the twin dragons and started to practice .Using the month travel time to get to the Royal City, Huang Xiaolong had persevered with his practice . On top of that, the Linglong Treasure Pagoda inside his body emitted fire dragon qi at all times, tempering his physique and improving his battle qi . This made Huang Xiaolong grow stronger every day and the barrier to the Seventh Order became thinner every second . He had a feeling that within one month\u2019s time, he could advance to the Seventh Order .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Moonlight shone down and created a hazy screen on the land, and occasionally, thin clouds veiled the moon .Huang Xiaolong came out to the small yard from his room . Standing in the middle of the yard, he bent his knees and lowered his body, his right hand forming a fist and punched forward slowly, while his left hand circled behind his back and adjusted his breathing according to the Fifth Stage of the Body Metamorphosis Scripture . Spiritual energy from the surrounding started to surge towards Huang Xiaolong instantly .Since he left Huang Clan Manor one year ago, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s practice of Body Metamorphosis Scripture had advanced to the Fifth Stage with the Power to Pull Nine Bulls as One, and he had reached the peak form that could advance into the Sixth Stage at any moment .Now, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s internal force was sturdy and continued to improve every day . While he breathed, white mist can be seen going in and out of his nostrils . If he was still on Earth in his previous life, the current Huang Xiaolong can be called an internal force master .The darkness of the night was gradually replaced by the impending dawn, and Huang Xiaolong finally stopped the Body Metamorphosis Scripture .After that, he called out the Blades of Asura . He leaped up into the air, and swung the Blades of Asura; instantly, countless blades lights flew out, turning into tiny drops of rain, condensing into a violent rainstorm that enveloped all directions . But, at this moment, the violent rainstorm suddenly changed into a drizzle, tender and gentle, barely discernable .From within the minuscule rain blades came the sounds of cries and wails that lasted for a long time .A while later, Huang Xiaolong stopped and took a deep breath; it has taken more than a year\u2019s time, and now, he finally reached major completion in the Asura Sword Skill\u2019s second style, Tears of Asura .He had perfect comprehension for the mood and intent for this move, but the only lacking point was how long his battle qi could support it . In the future, this move would grow more powerful as his battle qi became stronger .\u201cThen, the next step is the third style!\u201d Huang Xiaolong thought in his mind and took out the diagrams from the Asura Ring, fully concentrating of the third move .Asura Sword Skill Third Move: Wrath of the Nether King .Studying the illustrated movements and the route of running his battle qi, he etched them into his mind before returning the diagram back to the ring . He stood in the same spot for some time, when all of a sudden, his body shot forward a few meters like a burning meteor as the Blades of Asura slashed in front of him .Two fire red blade lights materialized in the air, rushing forward without any signs of stopping just like the wrath of the Nether King, crushing everything before it .After the first try, Huang Xiaolong stood still a few meters away, recalling his launching of the attack with the feelings and the movements before comparing them to what was written on the diagrams .Thirty minutes later, Huang Xiaolong moved again . His body shot forward like a meteor as he slashed to the front with the blades . Two angry, fire-red lights broke out like a volcanic eruption, swirling forward with the fixation of destroying everything in its path . The attack lost its momentum and vanished one hundred meters away .After the second try, he stood still again, repeating the previous process .Another thirty minutes passed and Huang Xiaolong made his third attempt .Huang Xiaolong repeated the same process again and again, like when he practiced Tempest of Hell and Tears of Asura for the first time . Continuous attempts as he tried to comprehend the intent of the move .Written along with the third move\u2019s illustration, when the Wrath of the Nether King reaches major completion, a swing of the blades is like the eruption of a millennium volcano, like the stampede of a million demonic beasts . And its momentum broke out in an instant at an unbelievable speed, giving the enemy no time to react and to only die under the Wrath of the Nether King .Three days passed quickly in practice .During\u00a0these three days, other than the usual practice of Asura Tactics, and the Body Metamorphosis Scripture, he concentrated on Wrath of the Nether King .Occasionally, Huang Xiaolong would spend some time on the Earth rank battle skill he was rewarded with from the Cosmic Star Academy competition, Collapsing Fist .With Huang Xiaolong\u2019s current battle qi energy, his Collapsing Fist attack could shatter a ten-meter boulder dozen meters away into a pile of gravel .Another three days passed .Huang Xiaolong came out from his courtyard .It was the beginning of a new term in Cosmic Star Academy, and Huang Xiaolong planned to go over and have a look .When he came to the main hall, his Dad, Mom, and two younger siblings were already there .\u201cBig Brother!\u201d Huang Min and Huang Xiaohai encircled Huang Xiaolong as soon as they saw him, calling out cheerfully . The two little guys were each hanging on one side of his arms .\u201cDid you have fun these past few days?\u201d Huang Xiaolong smiled and asked .\u201cBig Brother, the Royal City is much too fun! There are many, many nice places!\u201d Right after Huang Xiaolong\u2019s question ended, Huang Xiaohai rushed to answer as if someone was competing with him, happily, he added: \u201cI like it here very much!\u201dHuang Xiaolong smiled kindly; although he was training hard for the past three days, he still knew that these two little guys went out to play every day . \u00a0\u00a0And from the amount of outings they had, perhaps these two little guys who went to many places in the Royal City in just a few days\u2019 time already knew more than him, who had been on the Royal City for one year so far .\u201cPlaying around is okay, but you must also remember to practice hard . \u201d Huang Xiaolong said .Two little heads nodded obediently .\u201cDon\u2019t worry Big Brother . I definitely will practice hard so I can beat Huang Wei until he lies death on the floor!\u201d Huang Min said with a serious expression on her face .Huang Xiaolong nodded .Until this moment, his little sister was not aware that Huang Wei, his father, and his elder brother were already dead under the sword of experts from the Big Sword Sect . However, Huang Xiaolong did not say this out loud\u2013 but having a target as a motivator is a good thing .\u201cDad, Mom,\u201d Huang Xiaolong came up to his parents and inquired if their days are well and comfortable in Tianxuan Mansion .Huang Peng laughed: \u201cNothing is uncomfortable . \u201dHuang Xiaolong nodded gladly .His father, Huang Peng, had taken the high Grade Four Spirit Dan, Xingyao Dan, whereas his mother, Su Yan, swallowed the high Grade Five Spirit Dan, the Qi Sea Dan; both of their cultivations had advanced by one order .Huang Peng was now a Seventh Order, close to peak early-Seventh Order, and Su Yan reached mid-Sixth Order .\u201cOh right, Xiaolong, Miss Li Lu came to look for you yesterday . \u201d At this time, Su Yana suddenly laughed and said, \u201cBut you were practicing at that time and Miss Li Lu was here for an hour and then she left . \u201d\u201cLi Lu . \u201d Huang Xiaolong was a little surprised .Today was the Academy\u2019s new term, so it was not surprising that Li Lu had returned to the Royal City from the Li Residence .\u201cXiaolong, Li Lu is a good girl,\u201d Su Yan added, \u201cI think\u2026\u201d\u201cEn, Mom, no need to say more . \u201d Huang Xiaolong smiled bitterly with a trace of helplessness . He knew what his mother wanted to say even though the two of them, him and Li Lu, were not even eleven .\u201cThe Academy\u2019s new term starts today so I\u2019m going to have a look . \u201d He quickly stood up before Su Yan could open her mouth to speak, and ran away from the main hall as if he was fleeing for his life .Leaving the main hall, Huang Xiaolong did not stop until he came out of Tianxuan Mansion and headed in the direction of Cosmic Star Academy .Reaching the Academy, when the students saw Huang Xiaolong they all retreated to give way; their eyes filled awe and admiration, some had elevated to idolization .Huang Xiaolong ignored the whispers along the way and walked all the way to this classroom . The moment he stepped into the room, the noisy classroom became quiet immediately, and all the students stood up straight .Including that Jiang Teng . As Huang Xiaolong continued to walk in, Jiang Teng jumped out from his seat and retreated to the back of the classroom, trembling in fright . \u201cHuang Xiaolong, what do you want to do?\u201d Very obvious, he ate enough fists from Huang Xiaolong that he developed a traumatic fear towards Huang Xiaolong .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

During the class\u2019s lecture, she was absent-minded throughout and frequently stopped in mid-sentences, forgetting what she was saying numerous times .Huang Xiaolong left the classroom after one lesson and came to the library .Since he found out Asura\u2019s Gate headquarters was in Star Cloud Continent, he wanted to search more information about it .The day passed quickly while Huang Xiaolong spent the time in the library .When Huang Xiaolong came out, it was already midday . \u00a0It had been slightly over a month since the New Year, but the sunlight was stronger and it was warm as it fell on the skin .Returning to Tianxuan Mansion, he assumed the two little guys had gone out to play yet again since there was no shadow of the two around the mansion .Even the little violet monkey was not around . The little violet monkey would run to the Silvermoon Forest to kill demonic beasts and eat their beast cores for cultivation, showing up in the mansion from time to time .The three little guys were not in, but his parents were; going into their courtyard, Huang Xiaolong passed an internal force cultivation technique to them and reminded them to practice diligently .His parents\u2019 cultivation achievements were limited by the strength of their martial spirits and the chances of them breaking into Xiantian realm were slim . However, things are different with the support of internal force cultivation as this largely increases their chances of entering the Xiantian realm .For example, Huang Xiaolong . When his Body Metamorphoses Scripture reached the Tenth Stage, he could be considered a Xiantian expert in terms of internal force .Huang Xiaolong estimated an internal force Xiantian expert with this world\u2019s Xiantian expert possessed a similar level of strength .Huang Peng and Su Yan were ecstatic when they heard Huang Xiaolong say that practicing the internal force cultivation technique that he gave them would allow them to advance into the Xiantian realm .After passing the cultivation technique to his parents, Huang Xiaolong described in detail the situation that may arise while cultivating and the more difficult parts that were harder to comprehend .It was more than two hours later when Huang Xiaolong left his parents\u2019 courtyard to return to his own yard where he continued with his own practice of Asura Tactics and Wrath of the Nether King .Time flowed fast as another month had passed .Basically, in this one month\u2019s time, Huang Xiaolong did not step out the door of his courtyard as every moment was spent either on Asura Tactics, the Body Metamorphosis Scripture, or Wrath of the Nether King .On this night, like usual, Huang Xiaolong was sitting on the cold jade bed practicing Asura Tactics . The hazy moonlight shone into the room onto a black dragon and a blue dragon that were floating behind Huang Xiaolong, greedily devouring the netherworld spiritual energy rushing down from the space above . The battle qi in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body had started to roar and surge in his meridians .And the Linglong Treasure Pagoda was floating right above Huang Xiaolong\u2019s head .Again and again, as Huang Xiaolong continued to run Asura Tactics, the battle qi coursed through his meridians faster and faster, rolling continuously and crashing against the ever-thinning Seventh Order barrier .Huang Xiaolong didn\u2019t know how long this went on when his body suddenly shuddered . A tiny crack sounded that only Huang Xiaolong could hear: the Seventh Order Barrier was finally broken! The netherworld battle qi rushed joyfully forward into the Seventh Order meridians\u2019 route, and in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s heart position, a Qi Sea was formed . The netherworld battle qi rushed endlessly into the Seventh Order meridians and gathered in the newly formed Qi Sea in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s heart .By breaking through to the Seventh Order and forming the Qi Sea, there was an abundant amount of battle qi within the body . If the battle qi in the meridians were like a small river, now, battle qi in the Qi Sea was like a vast ocean .The moment the barrier was broken, the black dragon and the blue dragon behind Huang Xiaolong evolved in a heartbeat . The twin dragons\u2019 bodies grew bigger, the black and blue scales became denser, and the most amazing thing was another claw grew out from the initial four, and they both turned into five-clawed dragons . Two dragon heads roared towards the heavens as the dragons\u2019 terrifying oppressive aura swept out from the room .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body was shrouded in the flickering glow for a long time, like a light barrier around him .Huang Xiaolong was thrilled;\u00a0finally, he broke through the Seventh Order!Houtian Seventh Order . Many were stuck at either one of the two dividing lines: one was the Fourth Order and the other was the Seventh Order . The majority of the people cultivated for decades to break through to the Seventh Order, and some had remained stuck forever below the Seventh Order .In the kingdoms' small towns, a Seventh Order like Huang Xiaolong could be considered as the \u2018king\u2019 .But at this moment in time, Huang Xiaolong had yet to reach eleven years old .According to what he knew, the person who built Duanren Empire, the Duanren Emperor, had advanced to the Seventh Order at age thirteen .Suppressing his happiness, he continued to run Asura\u2019s Tactics, refining the netherworld spiritual energy in his body . After the black and blue dragons evolved, their speed of absorbing the netherworld spiritual energy had become three times faster compared to when he was at peak late-Sixth Order!At first when Huang Xiaolong advanced, his Qi Sea was an empty ocean during the drought season . As he pushed forward refining the netherworld spiritual energy, his battle qi reserve in the Qi Sea gradually increased .At the same time, the netherworld battle qi was refining his muscles, flesh, tendons, and skin .Before the Seventh Order, the battle qi wasn't able to strengthen the outer layer of the body . This was something possible after someone had broken through to the Seventh Order .When the morning sunlight grace the great earth, Huang Xiaolong ended his practice and got up from the cold jade bed . He let out a loud shout towards the sky to express the joy in his heart for advancing to the Seventh Order .After one night of practice and battle qi tempering, Huang Xiaolong could feel the difference on his skin; this was something new, not only that, all his muscles and even his flesh was firmer while his tendons became stronger .It is said a Tenth Order warrior\u2019s outer layer was stronger than a cow leather, muscles harder than steel stone, tendons having the explosive power of a spring, extremely fierce sounding .\u201cHmm, already a Seventh Order, I wonder what I look like after a soul transformation?\u2019 Huang Xiaolong thought and walked out from his room to the yard . Calling out both the black and blue dragons, Huang Xiaolong initiated the soul transformation process . Instantly, black and blue lights broke out and disappeared in a less than a second, wrapping themselves over Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body, beginning the fusion .It began with his arms: a fine layer of dragon scales covered over Huang Xiaolong\u2019s skin; on the left hand, there were black-colored dragon scales, and on his right hand were glittering blue dragon scales, spreading to his whole body apart from the face area . Huang Xiaolong didn\u2019t feel the slightest discomfort, even when his whole body was covered in a layer of dragon scales as if they had always been one entity and he could obviously feel his outer defense had reached a new threshold .Very strong!This was the first word that jumped into Huang Xiaolong\u2019s mind during his first soul transformation with his twin martial spirits . And Huang Xiaolong liked this feeling very much .After the soul transformation, the two dragons\u2019 heads looked like they were tattooed on his back, exuding a majestic aura .At the same time, there were changes to Huang Xiaolong\u2019s pupils; his left eye was entirely black and his right pupil was blue .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s fist suddenly struck out, and whistling wind sounded as it cut across space swiftly, and the result was a shattered false mountain dozen meters away, leaving a pile of broken pieces of small rocks and gravel .Note:No Imperial Dynasty history lesson here, but there is a rank/prestige difference in accordig to the number of claws a dragon has embroided on the robe . The Emperor\u2019s\u00a0Dragon Robe\u00a0is a five-clawed dragon (indicating a nobler status) whereby the\u00a0Palace Attire\u00a0for a Prince (or Wangye) has the four-clawed dragon . \u00a0Interesting, isn\u2019t it?_________________________________________________Next release: SatPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Both the blue and black dragon scales on his arms as well as the two tattooed-like dragon heads on his back disappeared. Exhaustion hit him all of a sudden.Although soul transformation increases his power and strength by many folds, it also consumed a large amount of battle qi; moreover, Huang Xiaolong had just advanced to the Seventh Order.After Huang Xiaolong returned to his normal self, tiny blue dots of lights shimmered around his body, and as they shone, the exhaustion Huang Xiaolong felt due to the soul transformation vanished instantly. His battle qi along his meridians recovered in a short few seconds.This was Huang Xiaolong martial spirit\u2019s third ability after breaking through to the Seventh Order: Instant Recovery!Instant Recovery!Roughly a few breaths\u2019 time, Huang Xiaolong had fully recovered the depleted battle qi!Although it needed ten seconds\u2019 time to fully recover his battle qi, it was already a heaven-defying level ability. From a certain aspect, this Instant Recovery was stronger than Space Concealment and Phantom Shadow.Combining Instant Recovery with Space Concealment, Huang Xiaolong needn\u2019t worry about the side effect of depleted battle qi.Well, the only \u2018misfortune\u2019 for this ability was it can only recover battle qi and not heal injuries.Ten seconds later, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s battle qi had fully recovered; he vanished right on the spot and vanishing along with him was the chair next to him. Ten breaths\u2019 time later, Huang Xiaolong reappeared from the space.Coming out from the space concealment, Huang Xiaolong continued to test the ability, appearing and disappearing meters away, and in the blink of an eye, he was more than ten meters from the original spot.After the second transformation, other than awakening a third ability, the previous two abilities were more powerful.Before, entering the concealment space, he could only go in alone whereas now, he could bring another person. And with Phantom Shadow ability, he actually could shift his position with his will within a ten meters range, teleportation. His speed was twice as fast the one Lu Kai possessed with his Sky Peng martial spirit!Huang Xiaolong inhaled deeply while his heart was rejoicing. He didn\u2019t expect he would have a new ability after his martial spirits evolved a second time and the first two had such an improvement.Then, Huang Xiaolong called out the Linglong Treasure Pagoda.According to what Yu Ming had said, he could open the first layer once he broke through to the Seventh Order.Huang Xiaolong initiated the netherworld battle qi on both palms, and as per Yu Ming\u2019s instruction, sent his battle qi into the pagoda. When the netherworld battle qi entered the Linglong Treasure Pagoda, it shone brightly and absorbed Huang Xiaolong\u2019s battle qi. He was somewhat taken aback by the reaction, and without warning, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes blurred as he appeared in a different space.This space was not big, merely several hundred square meters with a height of ten meters. In the four directions were walls that were made of unknown material.\u201cThis is the first floor space inside the Linglong Treasure Pagoda?\u201d Huang Xiaolong surveyed around wide-eyed; this situation was not consistent with Yu Ming\u2019s description.This Linglong Treasure Pagoda\u2019s space actually allows the owner to enter inside?Doesn\u2019t this mean\u2026.!Getting over his shock, he was more than thrilled because he noticed the spiritual aura within the Linglong Treasure Pagoda was thicker and much purer than the outside. Furthermore, up above the space, scuds of fire dragon qi flowed upwards, forming groups of thick fire dragon qi clouds. If he cultivated inside this space absorbing the fire dragon qi clouds, it would be far more effective than cultivating in the Dragon Flame Valley.Floating above these clouds were thumb-sized red beads, and they were shiny as they reflected the light like the twinkling stars in the night sky. However, the stars were white, and these beads glittered a fiery-red.\u201cFire Dragon Pearl!\u201d A thought flashed across Huang Xiaolong\u2019s brain.This must be the Fire Dragon Pearl that Yu Ming said!One, two, three!Huang Xiaolong slowly counted one by one and came up to a hundred and eight!His eyes lit up,\u00a0one hundred and eight Fire Dragon Pearl!This number was greatly out of his expectation. This amount of Fire Dragon Pearls was enough for himself to cultivate with for some time and even distribute some to his parents and little siblings.Suddenly at this point, a coruscating fire-red glow fell on Huang Xiaolong and shrouded over him before he could react. Subsequently, in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s mind, a physique cultivation technique appeared with information about the Golden Linglong Body.The Golden Linglong Body has a total of nine layers, and every layer brings about a mythical effect, and when one reached the ninth layer to achieve the Linglong Treasure Body, the person\u2019s body would be as resilient as the Linglong Treasure Pagoda, nearing invincible.Huang Xiaolong repeated the mantra once in his mind, and seconds later, he sat down cross-legged and started practicing. In the blink of an eye, a layer of fiery-red golden light similar to the Linglong Treasure Pagoda burst out from Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body.A few hours later, Huang Xiaolong finally stopped. During these few hours of practice, Huang Xiaolong observed that there was a mystical force strengthening his muscles, bones, tendons, and the surface of his skin, improving his overall defense.After stopping his practice, Huang Xiaolong turned his attention to the glittering red pearls hanging above the thick red clouds. With a thought, his right hand teleported one of the Fire Dragon Pearls.On his palm, the Fire Dragon Pearl felt a little hot, like a fire pearl burning at fifty to sixty celsius.Huang Xiaolong opened his mouth and threw the fire-red pearl into his mouth\u2013 the moment the Fire Dragon Pearl reached his stomach, it turned into a hot stream of energy that rushed into every corner of his body.Sensing this, Huang Xiaolong quickly calmed down again and ran Asura Tactics to refine the stream of hot energy. The netherworld battle qi in his meridians became active, surging and crashing the entire time while the dark gray color started to change slowly to a light gray.The same thing process emerged again, just like the time he was cultivating in the Dragon Flame Valley. Black impurities mixed with blood formed a layer over his skin, and these impurities were hidden deep down inside of his body instead of the normal ones.Another few hours passed.A layer of hardened blood and waste covered Huang Xiaolong.One day passed and the layer of impurities fell off as a new layer of waste was dispelled again, and the process repeated itself once more.After five days, it stopped.Huang Xiaolong took one day\u2019s time to fully refine one Fire Dragon Pearl, and each time he finished one, he would take another pearl down from the clouds as he continued to swallow and cultivate. In ten days\u2019 time, he had refined ten Fire Dragon Pearls. He stopped when he finished the tenth pearl and stood up, feeling immensely relaxed and comfortable from head to toe, akin to throwing away a hundred jin burden.Ten days of practice resulted in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s strength improving again, nearing peak early-Seventh Order.According to Huang Xiaolong\u2019s estimation, if he continued to stay and practice in the Linglong Treasure Pagoda space while swallowing the Fire Dragon Pearls, in another two weeks\u2019 time, he could reach peak early-Seventh Order, and given two months\u2019 time \u2013 mid-Seventh Order.However, with this cultivation speed, even if he monopolizes all one hundred and eight Fire Dragon pearls, it could only last him three to four months.That, and the speed at which the Linglong Treasure Pagoda condensed one pearl, even ten days was not sufficient to complete one.

Before Huang Xiaolong\u2019s eyes, the cycad fruit dried up, wrinkled and deflated in front of his eyes, before finally vanishing into thin air .And above him, after the spiritual energy from the cycad fruit was absorbed, fire dragon qi swirled rapidly, showing signs of condensing a new Fire Dragon Pearl .Watching this phenomenon, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s heart was delighted:\u00a0sure enough, this method works .Following that, Huang Xiaolong took out another cycad fruit . Just like what happened previously, the cycad fruit was sucked empty of the spiritual energy within it and vanished, swallowed by the pagoda . Huang Xiaolong continued to take out one cycad fruit after another, and after the number had surpassed ten, a new Fire Dragon Pearl was successfully formed, hanging above the clouds .Staring at the newly condensed Fire Dragon Pearl, Huang Xiaolong felt like crying . Now, he knew that cycad fruits and possibly other elixirs could speed up the time of condensing a Fire Dragon Pearl, but the expense is too big .More than ten cycad fruits!Huang Xiaolong only had less than twenty cycad fruits left in his spatial Asura Ring .Although these types of herb and fruit elixirs can be bought from auction and trading houses, the prices were somewhat scary . Not to mention Huang Xiaolong, probably not even the kingdom\u2019s ruler, King Lu Zhe could afford it on a long term basis .Next, Huang Xiaolong took out over a hundred Battle Qi Dan, and after absorbing all of them, the pagoda finally condensed out one Fire Dragon Pearl .More than one hundred Battle Qi Dan was equivalent to one Fire Dragon Pearl; this amount was more or less the same of the ten cycad fruits .I wonder if a demonic beast\u2019s beast core has an effect . \u00a0Suddenly, Huang Xiaolong thought of a possibility and wondered to himself .However, there was no beast core in his ring .A short while later, Huang Xiaolong came out from the Linglong Treasure Pagoda space and headed to the main hall . Calling Fei Hou, he gave Fei Hou one hundred thousand gold coins tasking him to purchase beast cores from auction and trading houses .Even though Fei Hou was puzzled with Huang Xiaolong\u2019s request of buying so many beast cores, he dared not ask too many questions .Roughly one hour later Fei Hou returned to the mansion and as per Huang Xiaolong\u2019s order, he procured more than forty pieces of Stage Seven beast cores .Huang Xiaolong was looking forward to testing out his theory; after he got the items from Fei Hou, Huang Xiaolong hurried back to his room and entered the Linglong Treasure Pagoda space, taking out all the Stage Seven beast cores .Just like what Huang Xiaolong guessed earlier, the pagoda could also absorb the violent demonic energy inside beast cores, and very soon, the pagoda space had sucked out all the energy from the forty plus beast cores that Fei Hou brought back . These beast cores turned into dull, gray ash, and disappeared .And the space that had absorbed more than forty demonic beast cores\u2019 energy and condensed out two new Fire Dragon Pearls .Seeing this result, Huang Xiaolong breathed out in relieved . This result was still acceptable to him, less than fifty beast cores in exchange for two Fire Dragon Pearls, meaning fifty thousand gold coins for one Fire Dragon PearlThis was way more cost effective than using cycad fruits or spirit dans .Still, fifty thousand gold coins was no a small sum, and he decided to enter the Silvermoon Forest himself to hunt for Stage Seven demonic beasts .And this time, the duration spent inside the Silvermoon Forest would be longer than the last time, Huang Xiaolong decided before he headed towards the Silvermoon Forest to kill demonic beasts, he would make a trip to the Academy first . He wanted to request for a class advancement test into the Second Year class since he had a breakthrough to Seventh Order .Early next morning, Huang Xiaolong came to the Cosmic Star Academy and went directly to the Principal\u2019s room . Actually, the matter regarding class advancements usually belonged to the class teachers, but by the time it was approved, six months would have gone by; if he went through Sun Zhang or Xiong Cu directly, it would save him a lot of time and trouble .When Huang Xiaolong arrived at the Principal\u2019s room, coincidentally, both Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu were inside .Both were a little surprised seeing Huang Xiaolong, and then both stood up with smiling faces .\u201cXiaolong, how come you have the free time to come over and look for us two old fellows?\u201d Sun Zhang grinned and asked, \u201cDid you come across some problems in your practice?\u201dXiong Chu was also smiling, \u201cWhatever problems you have, be at ease and tell us . \u201dThe two of them thought Huang Xiaolong\u2019s abrupt visit was due him coming across come cultivation problems . Thus, he came over to ask them for guidance .Huang Xiaolong shook his head, clarifying \u201cI came because I wanted to request for the class advancement test . \u201d\u201cRequest for the Second Year class advancement test?!\u201d Both old fellows blanked for a moment; Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu exchanged a glance, resulting in four widened eyes staring back at each other in shock .\u201cYou\u2026you\u2019re saying you have broken through to the Seventh Order?!\u201d Sun Zhang blurted out; not half a year had passed since the Academy competition ended\u2013 even if Huang Xiaolong had taken the Xingyao Dan and Qi Sea Dan, it was impossible for him to advance in such a short time! According to their secret estimate, Huang Xiaolong needs at least one year to do so .Xiong Chu also has an inconceivable expression on his face as he stared at Huang Xiaolong .Huang Xiaolong nodded, reaffirming what he had just said, \u201cThat is correct . \u201d And he released his battle qi energy outward .\u201cSeventh Order! It really is the Seventh Order!\u201d When Huang Xiaolong released his battle qi outside his body, Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu who found it hard to believe initially and they broke out in excitement .It was quite sometime later before the two old fellows recovered their dignified image .Still, both of them scrutinized Huang Xiaolong with weird looks on their faces .They didn\u2019t expect in less than four months, just slightly over three, that Huang Xiaolong gave them another wonderful surprise .If this was Huang Xiaolong\u2019s cultivation speed, he probably could win the Academy\u2019s overall champion before ten years\u2019 time and represent Cosmic Star Academy in the Duanren Empire\u2019s Battle of the Imperial City .\u201cThen, my request on the class advance test\u2026?\u201d Seeing that Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu just stood there and stared at him without an answer, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s brows creased and prodded them .Hearing Huang Xiaolong speak, Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu realized their gaffe, coming to their senses .\u201cXiaolong ah, I didn\u2019t expect you would breakthrough Seventh Order so soon!\u201d Sun Zhang was smiling as if spring had arrived as he looked at Huang Xiaolong, \u201cYour request for class advancement test, we approve . Let\u2019s do it this way, tomorrow, the Second Year Class Six is going near the border to kill some bandits, you follow along with the Second Year Class Six . As long as you can kill ten bandits, you pass the test . \u201d\u201cPrince Lu Kai also requested for the class advancement test two days ago,\u201d At this time, Xiong Chu informed Huang Xiaolong, \u201cTomorrow, like you, he would be joining the Second Year Class Six to kill bandits at the kingdom\u2019s border . \u201dLu Kai is also going?\u00a0Huang Xiaolong was taken aback by the news, but he just nodded and bid farewell to the two old fellows .After Huang Xiaolong had left Sun Zhang\u2019s room, they sent Huang Xiaolong out personally; watching Huang Xiaolong\u2019s back as he walked away until he vanished from view did the two look away .\u201cNow, I\u2019ll eagerly anticipate what the little guy will achieve in ten years!\u201d Sun Zhang exclaimed .Xiong Chu agreed, \u201cPerhaps a hundred years later, our Cosmic Star Academy needs this little guy\u2019s care . \u201dSun Zhang nodded his head, thinking about this matter pensively .Huang Xiaolong headed straight back to Tianxuan Mansion, not bothering to attend class after he left the Principal\u2019s room . Entering the Linglong Treasure Pagoda space, he continued to practice using the Fire Dragon Pearls .One day passed .On the second morning, Huang Xiaolong once again came to the Academy and waited at the square . He noted the Second Year Class Six students were already gathered, and Huang Xiaolong could recognize one of them, the student who won the Class Six battle, Ye Yong . Ye Yong was one of the people who entered the Dragon Flame Valley .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After all, Huang Xiaolong had advanced to the Seventh Order and requested for a class advancement test . Yesterday, not long after Huang Xiaolong returned to Tianxuan Mansion, the news had spread throughout the Cosmic Star Academy .Once again, Huang Xiaolong had become the center of attention in Cosmic Star Academy .Ye Yong walked out from the group of students towards Huang Xiaolong, and laughed when he came before Huang Xiaolong, \u201cXiaolong, I didn\u2019t expect since we last meet, not even three months had passed and you have already broken through to the Seventh Order!\u201d\u201cI was lucky . \u201d Huang Xiaolong said .Lucky?\u00a0Ye Yong shook his head . If being lucky could allow one to advance into the Seventh Order, then the majority of people in the Martial Spirit World would not be stuck in the Fourth Order, Fifth Order, or the Sixth Order for their entire lives .Breaking through to the Seventh Order required more than luck .At this time, from some distance away, Lu Kai arrived accompanied by a team of palace guards .Arriving at the square, Lu Kai did not feel it was strange seeing Huang Xiaolong\u2019s presence; apparently, he too had heard about Huang Xiaolong\u2019s breakthrough and his request for the assessment .Looking at Huang Xiaolong, Lu Kai felt complicated .Once both of them passed this class advancement test, they would be promoted to the Second Year\u2019s Class Six, becoming classmates .\u201cLet\u2019s compete again in this assessment, what do you think?\u201d Lu Kai looked at Huang Xiaolong, and baited, \u201cA bet of three hundred thousand gold coins!\u201d\u201cThree hundred thousand? Very well, what are we competing in?\u201d Somebody wanted to gift him three hundred thousand gold coins, so of course Huang Xiaolong would not refuse .\u201cSince the assessment this time is to kill bandits, then we shall compete and see who kills the most bandits . \u201d Lu Kai said in a sullen voice . He lost to Huang Xiaolong during the Academy competition; however, killing bandits does not solely rely on strength, and Lu Kai does not think he would lose to Huang Xiaolong in killing more bandits .Huang Xiaolong nodded, indicating he agreed with Lu Kai\u2019s proposal .Shortly after that, all students were gathered and the Second Year Class Six\u2019s teacher was also a beautiful female teacher called Chen Feirong . Chen Feirong was a different type compared to Xiong Meiqi; while the latter was cold with an arrogant bearing, Chen Feirong was like a fresh, gentle white lily . Her every move was soft and gentle and a smile graced her face as she spoke, giving a calm feeling .This time, the task of killing bandits near the border is led by her .Chen Feirong smiled at Huang Xiaolong and Lu Kai when she came to the square . Both Huang Xiaolong and Lu Kai were \u2018celebrities\u2019 of the Academy, and of course she could recognize them both .Yesterday, Principal Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu called her over to the Principal\u2019s room and with a deadpan, somber face they emphasized that no matter what, she must ensure the safety of Huang Xiaolong and Lu Kai during this trip .And due to this very reason, other than her leading the team, there were two other Tenth Order teachers accompanying them .\u201cSince everyone is here, let\u2019s depart!\u201d Chen Feirong ordered .A little over one hour later, the group had left the Royal City area, heading in the direction of one of the borders area .Half a month had passed .\u201cEveryone be alert . The small towns in this area are frequent places the bandits appear . Although these bandits\u2019 strength is not very high, they always come out in large numbers amassing close to a hundred people at a time, and they are extremely cruel . When you come across them, all of you must not display any mercy!\u201d Standing before the desolate entrance of a small town, Chen Feirong reminded the students of this warning .After traveling for two weeks, they finally reached the destination point\u2013 the junction between the Luo Tong Kingdom and the Baolong Kingdom .According to Chen Feirong, these bandits came from the Baolong Kingdom, sneaking past to the Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s army patrol to the Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s border towns, killing, robbing, and kidnapping people . Once these bandits had robbed a place, they would quickly retreat back into the Baolong Kingdom\u2019s territory, causing a huge headache for the border soldiers .After Chen Feirong warned the students, she led them into the desolate looking little town .In the quiet little town, the streets were empty with not even the shadow of a person; the doors of every store and house were shut tightly as the silence became eery in the students\u2019 minds . Occasionally, black smoke could be seen rising from some random buildings .A while later, Chen Feirong split the students into three teams led by her and the other two teachers . Each group has roughly twenty-something students . Each team will act separately and regroup at the town entrance; whichever group that found the bandits were to release the signal to inform the others of their position .Both Lu Kai and Huang Xiaolong were arranged into the same team led by Chen Feirong .The students followed Chen Feirong from behind as they continued onward along the streets . One hour later, they still had yet to see any bandits . The whole town was blanketed in an atmosphere of desolation, hopelessness, and something else, something strange .\u201cStrange, where did the people in this small town go? Why can\u2019t we find even one person?\u201d Ye Yong who was on the same team as Huang Xiaolong frowned and asked out loud .\u201cCould everyone have died? If that is the case, where are the bodies?\u201d Lu Kai interjected .Not only there were people, there weren\u2019t any corpses either . There were no traces of fighting or blood splatters as if all the people in the small town had vanished into thin air .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s brows creased into a furrow .However, the group continued onward, and when the team came to the north side of the small town, suddenly, Huang Xiaolong stopped . \u00a0This is . . . ?\u00a0The smell of blood! Yes, this is the smell of blood!The smell of blood was extremely light, but Huang Xiaolong could clearly smell it and he was not wrong in his judgment . Ever since he broke through to the Seventh Order and his martial spirits evolved for the second time, his hearing ability and sense of smell has improved exponentially .Lu Kai and Ye Yong noticed Huang Xiaolong\u2019s sudden reaction and were doubtful in their hearts . And at this point, without warning, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s silhouette dashed forward, shocking the rest of the team .\u201cHuang Xiaolong!!\u201d Chen Feirong cried out . \u00a0She, Lu Kai, and everyone else also sped up .Not long after Huang Xiaolong\u2019s abrupt sprint, up ahead on the same street, he saw two middle-aged men in peculiar clothing . The two middle-aged men looked up when they saw Huang Xiaolong as well as Chen Feirong, and twenty over people at the back and they panicked . Turning around, they wanted to run .Prior to this, Chen Feirong had described the characteristics of the bandits\u2019 clothing to them; from the way these two middle-aged men were dressed and their hasty retreat, there was no doubt they are part of the Baolong Kingdom\u2019s bandits that came across the border .\u201cWant to escape?\u201d Watching their actions, Huang Xiaolong let out a cold smirk . In an instant, his martial spirit\u2019s Phantom Shadow ability was initiated, and in a flash, he had crossed the ten-meter distance between him and the two men . Close to him, Huang Xiaolong swung his blades, and a cold, sharp light slit across one of the men\u2019s throat . Huang Xiaolong also punched the other man, sending him flying, but keeping him alive .Huang Xiaolong came to the spot where the man landed, and his voice was filled with iciness as he questioned him: \u201cTalk . Where are the town\u2019s people?\u201dThat middle-aged man was terribly frightened and he cried out,\u201cDon\u2019t kill me! I\u2019ll talk! The town\u2019s people were herded to the square up ahead!\u201d He pointed to a direction in front .However, just as he finished speaking, Huang Xiaolong pointed a finger at his forehead, and it pierced through the temple .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s silhouette flashed again in the direction the man had pointed .And at this point, Chen Feirong and the students arrived and seeing the two lifeless bodies, she ordered to Ye Yong: \u201cQuick, release the signal to notify the other two teams!\u201d\u201cYes, Teacher!\u201d Ye Yong answered, quickly taking out a smoke ball and crushing it towards the sky . In less than a second, a blue colored light shot up the sky .Moments later, Huang Xiaolong had rushed to the aforementioned square and came before an open space that could accommodate a few thousand people, and bodies were strewn everywhere . Some of these bodies had all four limbs cut off, some were headless, and some had their intestines dug out .These bodies were what used to be the town\u2019s people .The smell of blood curdled in the air .And on the square, some hundreds of bandits were gripping sharp blades in the midst of their massacre of the town\u2019s people . Mournful wails resounded in the square . This group of bandits actually numbered close to three hundred!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After I am done, then it is your turn!\u201d\"Thanks Head!\u201dIn an instant, excited cheers broke out from the three hundred over bandits .Chen Feirong delicate face was angered, turning green and red, and her beautiful eyes glowered at the other side .Seeing this, the Bandit Head middle-aged man wearing the elongated black hat smiled even wider, \u201cLittle slut, in a moment us brothers will surely pleasure you, don\u2019t look so anxious!\u201d Finished saying that, two hands waved and the three hundred over bandits spread out and surrounded the small twenty people in the middle .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s cold gaze swept over the surrounding bandits .At this time, the Bandit Head\u2019s cold voice rang out, \u201cLeave the women alive, kill all the men!\u201d As the other side instructed, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s silhouette moved at the same instant while gripping the Blades of Asura in his hands .Screams sounded from the opposite side with a swing of his blades .And Lu Kai, Ye Yong, as well as the others also started to attack .Chen Feirong killed several bandits that rushed over with a hand print; she leaped up and her palm aimed to strike the Bandit Head .Watching Chen Feirong coming at him, the Bandit Head snickered; one of his hand signaled his cronies: \u201cCapture the little slut; remember, don\u2019t hurt her . Otherwise, I won\u2019t be able to play to my heart\u2019s content later . \u201dThe bandit cronies acknowledged him in loud voices and swarmed towards Chen Feirong .Although Chen Feirong was a Ninth Order warrior, a late-Ninth Order at that, the number of bandits besieging her was too many despite having no Ninth Order warrior amongst them . Most of them were of the Seventh Order and a few were Eighth Order warriors . These Eighth Order bandits attacked Chen Feirong together, making her flustered in confusion .Chen Feirong had an ugly expression on her delicate face as she had not expected to run into such a big group of bandits that had such strength . In previous incidents, these kind of bandits that crossed the border from the Baolong Kingdom consisted of no more than a hundred men and at most, maybe one or two Eighth Order . Sometimes, even Seventh Order bandits were rare and the average strength were just Sixth Orders .Her silhouette dodged swiftly like a floating cloud, avoiding the dozen Eight Order bandits\u2019 attacks . Taking a quick glance around, she saw Lu Kai and Ye Yong . In fact, all the students were sieged by a large number of bandits, and each of them was in an extremely dangerous situation .But when her eyes found Huang Xiaolong, she was stunned as she saw Huang Xiaolong\u2019s shadow flickering randomly amongst the bandits whilst swinging a pair of cold looking blades . With every swing, there surely would have been two bandits screaming and falling to the ground, and every attack targeted a vital point, taking lives without needing a second attack . There was no exception, even if the opponent was a mid or late-Seventh Order bandit .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s speed had reached a degree that dumbfounded people .Chen Feirong looked wide-eyed at Huang Xiaolong with unspeakable shock in her heart; she could tell Huang Xiaolong\u2019s speed far surpassed the average peak late-Seventh Order .However, this was not the time for shock and she did not have the luxury of time to ponder why Huang Xiaolong had such an amazing speed . She shouted, \u201cEveryone release your martial spirits! Spare no effort and hold on for another five minutes!\u201dHold on five minutes and the other two teams will arrive; five minutes and they would be safe!Chen Feirong\u2019s order reverberated and the students including Lu Kai and Ye Yong called out their martial spirits and soul transformed without delay . However, the surrounding bandits followed their actions, calling out their martial spirits and soul transformed .The Bandit Head sneered as he stood at one side watching the scene, and then, his sight focused on Huang Xiaolong .He had noticed the situation around Huang Xiaolong, watching bandits fall one by one under Huang Xiaolong\u2019s blades, and a sharp cruel light shone in his eyes . Suddenly, the Bandit Head leaped out, aiming a palm print at Huang Xiaolong\u2019s back .\u201cDestruction Qi Palm!\u201d\u201cLittle bastard, go die for me!\u201dA big palm print whistled across space; in the middle of the palm print was a concentration of violent destructive qi like the eye of a hurricane .\u201cHuang Xiaolong, watch out!\u201d Noticing this, Lu Kai, Ye Yong, and some of the students shouted in warning .Chen Feirong\u2019s expression worsened seeing this . She was well aware of Huang Xiaolong\u2019s importance; it could be said, in this task to kill bandits, mishaps are allowed to happen to all of them except for Huang Xiaolong .\u201cRoll away!\u201d Chen Feirong was blocked by ten or so Eighth Order bandits, and seeing that violent palm print that was about to hit Huang Xiaolong, she roared with fury . A white coruscating light flashed and at the same time, something like pillows of cloud appeared, but its color was an icy transparent blue .When the pillow of clouds emerged, the surrounding temperature dropped to freezing, akin to an arctic winter .This is Chen Feirong\u2019s martial spirit, Ice Cloud!It falls into the same category as Fei Hou\u2019s martial spirit, one that derives from nature .Calling out her martial spirit, Chen Feirong\u2019s palms struck the void in four directions .\u201cIce-Sealed World!\u201dWhere the palm hit, the airflow actually froze and condensed into numerous icicles; the dozen Eighth Order bandits that were ganging up on her immediately retreated in haste .Even though Chen Feirong successfully forced these bandits to retreat, there wasn\u2019t enough time for her to rescue Huang Xiaolong; watching as the Bandit Head\u2019s palm print was about to hit Huang Xiaolong\u2019s back, Lu Kai, Chen Feirong, and the other students\u2019 heart tightened, but Huang Xiaolong suddenly vanished . \u00a0The attack fell on empty air, flipping the little town residents\u2019 corpses off the square ground .The smile on the Bandit Head stiffened .While everyone was stupefied at the result, a sudden anguish scream pulled everyone back . Turning towards the direction of the scream, they saw Huang Xiaolong ten meters away from his original spot and another two bandits fell under Huang Xiaolong\u2019s blades .Ignoring the surprised expression directed at him, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s blades continued to draw blade without calling out his martial spirit .\u201cKill! Kill that punk!\u201d After a few more bandits died, the Bandit Head finally regained his focus, and his face ugly as he pointed a finger at Huang Xiaolong while thundering his orders . He flashed and disappeared, once again targeting Huang Xiaolong with a second palm strike . Unfortunately, when he got close enough to Huang Xiaolong, a silhouette rushed out of nowhere and hit the Bandit Head, causing him to tumble away and crash severely on the ground .That person was one of the Tenth Order Cosmic Star Academy teachers who rushed over after seeing the signal Ye Yong released to the sky .Seeing that reinforcement had arrived, Chen Feirong finally relaxed a little .At this point, the rest of the other teams\u2019 students and the other Tenth Order teacher had also reached the square .With the two Tenth Order warriors entering the scene, the Eighth Order bandits laying siege on Chen Feirong were easily dealt with, and a short while later, over three hundred bandits were \u2018solved\u2019 by Huang Xiaolong and the students .In the end, only the Bandit Head remained .Chen Feirong slowly stepped towards the Bandit Head with her sword in her hand and an icy expression on her face .\u201cI am from the Baolong Kingdom\u2019s Martial Ning Family and my Big Brother is Martial Ning Family\u2019s Patriarch; little slut, you dare to kill me?\u201d The Bandit Head howled when he saw Chen Feirong coming towards him with a sword in hand .Martial Ning Family?\u00a0Everyone present was startled .This Martial Ning Family was the first family of the Baolong Empire; this group of bandits was actually supported by the Martial Ning Family? No wonder their average strength was so high, incomparable to those previous bandit groups .Before anyone could react, the Blades of Asura in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s hands slashed across his throat, and the Bandit Head grasped at his own throat while looking at Huang Xiaolong with disbelief .\u201cI am Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s Huang Xiaolong . \u201d Huang Xiaolong \u2018introduced\u2019 himself .Baolong Kingdom\u2019s Martial Ning Family? So what?Note:A martial family (very likely) meant the family has a long heritage and expansive martial arts foundation, making their family/clan a strong force of the kingdom .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It seems like the Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s border garrison army arrived .Just like how it was on Earth in his previous life, the police always comes after problems were solved .A short while later, about a thousand soldiers from two brigades surrounded Huang Xiaolong and the rest . These soldiers arrived at the square and saw the mountain of corpses from the townspeople and the bandits, and the expression on their faces changed .Although none of them knew what took place, each of them could guess roughly what happened .\u201cGeneral Qin, look . That one looks like the Martial Ning Family\u2019s Ning Fei; the Martial Ning Family Patriarch\u2019s brother . \u201d A Lieutenant General suddenly pointed at the Bandit Head\u2019s corpse while talking to General Qin Shi .General Qin Shi\u2019s gaze followed the direction of the finger, and when he saw the Bandit Head\u2019s body, he frowned\u2013 yes, it was Ning Fei . This Ning Fei had crossed the border and did some crimes, but he escaped the last time, and this was the reason Qin Shi recognized Ning Fei .\u201cGeneral Qin, with Ning Fei\u2019s death, this matter will be difficult to handle . Ning Wang definitely would pressure us through the Baolong Kingdom\u2019s King to make us handover the murderer . \u201d That Lieutenant General said, and he added: \u201cYou see?\u201dQin Shi nodded . If it was someone with no background then it was fine, but the one who died was Ning Fei, so it was bound to bring problems .\u201cWho killed him?\u201d Qin Shi pointed at the Bandit Head and snapped .\u201cI killed him . \u201d Huang Xiaolong replied indifferently .\u201cGo capture him!\u201d Qin Shi signaled the soldiers to him .\u201cYes General!\u201dAnd several soldiers surrounded Huang Xiaolong .\u201cStop! You dare?!\u201d Chen Feirong snapped angrily, and came up with the students and teachers from the Cosmic Star Academy, glaring with wrath at Qin Shi and the soldiers .There was a faint cold smile on Huang Xiaolong as he watched Qin Shi, and his calm-voiced sounded, \u201cAccording to the kingdom\u2019s law, killing border bandits is a meritorious deed that will be awarded . So, I would like to ask, why would you not follow the kingdom\u2019s law and want to capture me instead?\u201dQin Shi choked on Huang Xiaolong\u2019s words .\u201cPresumptuous! Little brat, you committed a cruel murder, yet you\u2019re still dreaming of meritorious award?\u201d Qin Shi had yet to speak before the Lieutenant General next to him had already flared up: \u201cCome, arrest that little brat!\u201dHowever, before they could get close to Huang Xiaolong, those soldiers were slapped away by Chen Feirong and the two Tenth Order teachers .\u201cYou actually dare to rebel?!\u201d That Lieutenant General saw the three people obstructing his soldiers, and questioned them aloud, accusing Chen Feirong and the two teachers of a capital crime .\u201cWhat an audacious accusation!\u201d At this point, a voice sounded .\u201cWho? Roll out here!\u201d That Lieutenant General barked .A path opened amongst the students as a person walked out to the front, and it was Prince Lu Kai . When Qin Shi saw Lu Kai, the skin of his face was taut with tension . However, the Lieutenant General did not recognize Lu Kai, \u201cGo and arrest him together!\u201d\u201cStop!\u201dQin Shi quickly roared, and before the shocked eyes of the Lieutenant General and the soldiers, Qin Shi jumped down from his horse and arrived in front of Lu Kai in hurried steps . He knelt down on one knee and saluted: \u201cQin Shi greets His Highness Prince Lu Kai!\u201dHis Royal Highness!That Lieutenant General and the soldiers were shocked into a daze; recovering, each quickly alighted their horses and knelt down: \u201cSaluting His Prince Highness!\u201dThat Lieutenant General bowed so low he was practically kissing the ground in salute, and cold sweat trickled down the side of his face .\u201cAll of you rise, but as for you, continue kneeling!\u201d Lu Kai permitted Qin Shi and all the other soldiers to stand up except for that one Lieutenant General that was told to continue kneeling on the ground .Qin Shi stood up and came up beside Lu Kai whereas Lu Kai observed the Lieutenant General with cold eyes, \u201cYou ordered to have me arrested?\u201dThe beads of cold sweat on the Lieutenant General\u2019s face grew bigger, and kowtowing ruthlessly, he pleaded, \u201cI did not realize it was His Royal Highness! I hope His Royal Highness forgives this one\u2019s mistake!\u201dLu Kai continued, \u201cYou said we wanted to rebel?\u201dThat Lieutenant General ashen instantly, not knowing how to answer; in his heart, he was already prepared to die .Then, Lu Kai turned around and looked at Qin Shi, a look that made Qin Shi\u2019s hair stand up in fear .\u201cYou wanted to arrest him . Do you know who he is?\u201d Lu Kai asked Qin Shi as his eyes indicated towards Huang Xiaolong . \u00a0Qin Shi obediently looked towards Huang Xiaolong .\u201cHe is Huang Xiaolong!\u201d Lu Kai stated .\u201cWhat? Huang Xiaolong!\u201d\u201cHe is that Huang Xiaolong?!\u201dQin Shi, the Lieutenant General, and the many soldiers\u2019 heads made an abrupt turn in Huang Xiaolong\u2019s direction and without a doubt, each and every one of them was greatly shocked .Huang Xiaolong, top grade twelve martial spirit of the Primordial Divine Black Dragon! The Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s first talent!This message had spread far and wide throughout the Luo Tong Kingdom, from the commoners below to the Generals and nobles above\u2013 who does not know about him? Even some of the prominent forces in the neighboring kingdoms knew a talented monster of a youth had appeared in the Luo Tong Kingdom .It was Qin Shi\u2019s turn to break out in a cold sweat .Huang Xiaolong has deep connections with Marshal Haotian, this he already knew . Hearing Huang Xiaolong\u2019s name, that Lieutenant General lost all color in his face . Earlier, he was prepared to die, but now, he wasn\u2019t sure if he could die in peace .\u201cThis matter, I will report to my Royal Father!\u201d Lu Kai added .Qin Shi and his little Lieutenant General quivered .The two of them were still rooted to the spot even after the team from Cosmic Star Academy left .And after leaving the little town, they did not return to the Royal City, and instead, they moved on to other small towns to kill bandits .Two months later, the team headed back to the Royal City from the border .As for the bet between Huang Xiaolong and Lu Kai, needless to say, Huang Xiaolong won .Some months later the team returned, due to meritorious deeds for annihilating bandits at the border, rewards from the Luo Tong Kingdom were quickly awarded down . According to law, the rate of one bandit was one hundred gold coins, and Huang Xiaolong received more than ten thousand gold coins in reward .Not long after that, Qin Shi was demoted to Lieutenant General and the Lieutenant General was removed from the military with a notice .When Huang Xiaolong returned to Tianxuan Mansion, his parents and little siblings were there with Li Lu too . On that same night, Tianxuan Mansion held a banquet to celebrate Huang Xiaolong\u2019s success in passing the class advancement test .The banquet was very lively, especially with the two little ones, Huang Min and Huang Xiaohai .After the banquet ended, and everyone went back to their rooms to rest, Huang Xiaolong, Marshal Haotian, and Fei Hou sat in the main hall .\u201cDuring these past two months, did the Big Sword Sect\u2019s people appear nearby?\u201d Huang Xiaolong asked .\u2018Replying Sovereign, no . \u201d Marshal Haotian answered, \u201cBut, Subordinate found out that next month, Big Sword Sect will hold a Sect Leader Election Ceremony . \u201d\u201cSect Leader Election Ceremony?\u201d Huang Xiaolong\u2019s voice was sullen, \u201cWho is Big Sword Sect\u2019s next Sect Leader?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Liu Wei\u2019s Junior Brother named Lin Zhiren, a peak late-Tenth Order . However, Lin Zhiren\u2019s talent is quite good, and it is estimated that within ten years\u2019 time, he will probably breakthrough to Xiantian realm . \u201d This time, it was Fei Hou who replied .Huang Xiaolong nodded, and then he requested Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou to watch Big Sword Sect\u2019s movement closely .\u201cPlease rest assured Sovereign . \u201d Both of them replied respectfully .Huang Xiaolong withdrew twenty Fire Dragon Pearls from the Linglong Treasure Pagoda space and gave Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou ten each so they could use it for their cultivation . When the two of them realized\u00a0that Huang Xiaolong gave them the Fire Dragon Pearls from the Linglong Treasure Pagoda, objects born from the natural spiritual energy, both of them were endlessly grateful .When Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou retired, Huang Xiaolong came to his parents\u2019 courtyard, informing them he will be training in the Silvermoon Forest in two days and he left sixty Fire Dragon Pearls with them .Back in his own room, Huang Xiaolong started his daily practice of Asura Tactics; in the two months of killing bandits, Huang Xiaolong had advanced to mid-Seventh Order .Huang Xiaolong entered the Linglong Treasure Pagoda space, swallowed Fire Dragon Pearls, and practiced his cultivation technique . The twin dragons martial spirits floated behind him, greedily devouring the netherworld spiritual energy .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 97Chapter 97: Four Years PassedTwo days passed .Like the previous time, Huang Xiaolong had all the necessities prepared and departed Tianxuan Mansion for the Silvermoon Forest; similarly, he brought the little violet monkey with him as well .\u2026Three months later, at a lake somewhere in the Silvermoon Forest, a Stage Seven Raging Flames Rhinoceros was heading to the lake . Suddenly, two sharp rays of blade light flashed and that Stage Seven Raging Flames Rhinoceros let out a dismal howl as its blood spurted out and it fell to the ground .When the huge rhinoceros fell, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s silhouette emerged and he came beside the beast corpse . With a wave of the Blades of Asura, the beast core was dug out .Holding the beast core in his hands, Huang Xiaolong subsequently sent it into the Linglong Treasure Pagoda\u2019s space so it could absorb the demonic energy inside .After absorbing that beast core, there were signs that a new Fire Dragon Pearl would be condensed soon .This method is still too slow . \u00a0Huang Xiaolong thought in his mind .During these past\u00a0three months, Huang Xiaolong averaged five Stage Seven demonic beasts every day, and up to now, he has killed more than four hundred demonic beasts . Still, this number only birthed twenty-something Fire Dragon Pearls .Over ninety days of work, and it only resulted in twenty-something Fire Dragon Pearls!This result made Huang Xiaolong shake his head .Progressing at this speed, the Fire Dragon Pearls could not keep up with his need . Furthermore, before he came to the Silvermoon Forest, he gave out a total of eighty Fire Dragon Pearls to his parents, Marshal Haotian, and Fei Hou . The number of Fire Dragon Pearls in the Linglong Pagoda space was scarce to begin with, and now, three months later, all of it were already used up for his cultivation .But, this was something out of his power .One more year and I can break through the Eighth Order!\u00a0Huang Xiaolong estimated .Advancing to the Eighth Order meant he could hunt Stage Eight demonic beasts, and the demonic energy inside a Stage Eight beast core was several times more concentrated than a Stage Seven beast core . At that time, perhaps the Linglong Treasure Pagoda could condense out one Fire Dragon Pearl on a daily basis .\u201cZhi zhi zhi!\u201d At this point of time, the little violet monkey came running from some distance away . Seeing the Raging Flame Rhinoceros beast corpse at the side, \u00a0it started squeaking with dissatisfaction at Huang Xiaolong .Due to the Linglong Treasure Pagoda\u2019s need for beast cores, thus the need for this trip into the Silvermoon Forest, Huang Xiaolong turned into the little monkey\u2019s \u2018competitor\u2019 for beast cores . Thus it was decided between them the one who first killed the demonic beast would own the beast core .And every time, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s actions was always faster than it .So, it can\u2019t blame that the little guy was dissatisfied .\u2026\u2026\u2026The passage of time flowed by .Months passed one after another and soon, nine months had passed, almost reaching the end of the year .At the end of the year, Huang Xiaolong and the little violet monkey journeyed back to Tianxuan Mansion . On the first day of the New Year, Huang Xiaolong had a warm, loving reunion with his family; and of course, Huang Xiaolong participated in the Cosmic Star Academy\u2019s annual competition .Needless to say, the Second Year Class champion title was brought home by Huang Xiaolong, as both Lu by Lu Kai and Ye Yong were defeated one after the other .Although Huang Xiaolong was the class champion, the Second Year overall champion was not him . With his current strength, he was not able to win over the strongest person in the Second Year, a peak late-Eighth Order .Not long after spending the New Year with his family, Huang Xiaolong packed up and took the little violet monkey back to the Silvermoon Forest for another bout of training .Spring ended and autumn was on its way .One year passed after another like the seasons .At the end of every year, Huang Xiaolong would return to Tianxuan Mansion and take part in the Academy competition .Four years had passed .Scorching sunlight shone down on the great earth, and a young man looking around fifteen to sixteen years old with a little monkey on his shoulder was seen dashing through the forest speedily, akin to a fleeting phantom shadow .While running, the young man suddenly stopped and leaped upward . Just as the young man leaped away, a huge demonic bear\u2019s attack landed on the spot where the young man stood previously .Successfully dodging the demonic bear\u2019s attack, the young man turned back and a Collapse Fist punched onto the huge demonic bear\u2019s body . The power of that fist was heavy and strong, directly sinking into the demonic bear\u2019s chest and it came out from its back, penetrating through its entire body .The huge demonic bear tumbled to the forest floor .This young man was none other than Huang Xiaolong . Four years had passed, and he had grown into a handsome looking youth; five feet six inches tall, close to five foot seven, with a lean muscular body, star-like eyes, a tall nose, and red lips .Four years had passed and Huang Xiaolong not only advanced to the Eighth Order, but his current strength was at the peak of late-Eighth Order, and anytime soon, he could break through to the next order .However, the demonic bear on the floor that was just killed by Huang Xiaolong was not a Stage Eight beast, but a Stage Nine demonic beast .Although only a peak late-Eighth Order, his strength could easily kill a demonic beast of the early Stage Nine .Huang Xiaolong came to the huge bear corpse, and he dug out the beast core and threw it into the Linglong Treasure Pagoda space . Instantly, all the demonic energy inside the beast core was absorbed, turning it into a new Fire Dragon Pearl .The energy inside a Stage Nine beast core was higher than a Stage Seven beast, about ten times or more, and one Stage Nine beast core was enough for the Linglong Treasure Pagoda to condense out one Fire Dragon Pearl in exchange .This is the twentieth!\u00a0Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself .This month he had killed a total of twenty Stage Nine demonic beasts; unfortunately, compared to Stage Seven and Eight demonic beasts, Stage Nine demonic beasts were hard to find . On average, Huang Xiaolong could probably hunt one in a day .\u201cZhi zhi zhi!\u201d At this time, the little monkey jumped down, and approached the corpse; its sharp claws slashed across and it took out a bear gallbladder .Even after four years, the little violet monkey\u2019s appearance had no changes to it\u2013 it was still the same half-a-meter tall little monkey . \u00a0The only difference was that its fur became shinier and softer and its pupils were a sharp piercing blue .Its strength growth was no slower than Huang Xiaolong who possessed the Linglong Treasure Pagoda and their strength could be said to be equal .After killing the huge demonic bear, Huang Xiaolong and the little violet monkey left in search of the next target .Two more months passed .The time of the end of the year once again neared; thus, Huang Xiaolong and the little violet monkey left the Silvermoon Forest, heading back to the Royal City .Half a month later, Huang Xiaolong and the little monkey were back at the Luo Tong Royal City .\u201cBig Brother!\u201d Just as he stepped into the Tianxuan Mansion, a young girl about fourteen to fifteen years old hurried out from inside and cried out happily .This pretty young girl happened to be Huang Min, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s little sister; four years had turned a little girl into a young woman .Coming out, Huang Min dragged her big brother into the yards of Tianxuan Mansion .Huang Xiaolong laughed at her actions, \u201cLittle girl, why are you so happy?\u201dHuang Min pursed her lips and protested, \u201cBig Brother you are so mean . I have grown up . Don\u2019t call me little girl anymore . \u201d Them, her eyeballs rolled naughtily, asking \u201cWanna guess who came?\u201d\u201cLi Lu . \u201d Huang Xiaolong laughed .These past\u00a0few years, Huang Xiaolong spent most of the time training in the Silvermoon Forest and would only return to Tianxuan Mansion at the end of each year; knowing this, Li Lu would come to visit Tianxuan Mansion every year around this time, waiting for Huang Xiaolong .\u201cBoring . \u201d Huang Min\u2019s little mouth curled, but her expression changed quickly, \u201cElder Sister Li Lu has been here for five days already . If she knows you\u2019re back, she will be very happy!\u201dHuang Xiaolong just smiled, allowing his sister Huang Min to pull him to Tianxuan Mansion\u2019s main hall .________________________________________________________________Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Other than the two of them, in the main hall sat a young woman wearing a long pastel green dress . The young woman has creamy white skin, soft cherry blossom lips, and bright eyes that held a trace of mischief and naughtiness, and she had two lovely dimples on her cheeks, akin to an immortal fairy unstained by the mortal realm .This was Li Lu .Four years had passed and Li Lu was now fifteen . Proving what Su Yan had said years ago, Li Lu grew up to be a beautiful woman, and now, every time Li Lu stepped out, it was enough to stun the whole street .The current Cosmic Star Academy has three big beauties, and Li Lu was one of them .\u201cXiaolong!\u201dSeeing Huang Xiaolong come back, the three people in the main hall bloomed into wide smiles and called out in delight, whereas Li Lu straightforwardly jumped up and ran towards Huang Xiaolong .However, less than a meter before she reaches Huang Xiaolong and wanted to hug him like she used to do, she stopped abruptly; a pink blush crept up her face and her demeanor turned shy . The long pastel green dress that she wore showed off her tiny waist and two proud peaks, painting a pretty picture that complimented her shy look .Watching her actions, Huang Xiaolong laughed, \u201cI heard Huang Min said you have been here for five days . \u201dLi Lu nodded her head shyly .\u201cOkay, don\u2019t stand here and talk, let\u2019s go back to the main hall . \u201d Su Yan teased and laugh, \u201cThe two of you still have many opportunities to chat . \u201dHuang Xiaolong was still fine, but when Li Lu heard that, she turned even redder .In these four years, Huang Peng and Su Yan\u2019s strength had grown by a large degree .Huang Peng was now a peak late-Seventh Order whereas Su Yan had just advanced to the Seventh Order . These years, both of them had been cultivating using the Fire Dragon Pearls Huang Xiaolong gave them, and after undergoing the cleansing of marrows effect due to the Fire Dragon Pearls, both of them looked younger every day .Their initial forty-something appearance became thirty-something . If Su Yan stood next to Li Lu, people would surely think they were sisters .Back in the main hall, everyone sat down .\u201cXiaolong, this time you came back, don\u2019t rush to leave so fast . \u201d After taking a seat, Su Yan laughed and said, \u201cThis year Li Lu will stay here and celebrate the New Year with us . \u201d\u201cNot going back to Canglan County?\u201d Huang Xiaolong was a little surprised, looked at Li Lu and asked .Li Lu felt embarrassed with Huang Xiaolong focusing on her, and she nodded, quietly saying, \u201cI already mentioned it to my Father and Grandfather that I\u2019m not going back this year . I will stay here for the New Year . \u201d\u201cGood ah, if Sister Li Lu stays here for the New Year, it would be even livelier!\u201d Huang Min clapped her hands in delight, \u201cWait another two years, and when Sister Li Lu marries over, then every she will spend every New Year here!\u201dMarry?\u00a0The moment these words were spoken out, Li Lu\u2019s delicate face went red faster than cooking a lobster .Huang Xiaolong widened his eyes and directed a stern stare at Huang Min but she acted as if she did not see Huang Xiaolong\u2019s reaction and continued to smile complacently .\u201cXiaolong, your little sister is right . \u201d At this time, Su Yan quickly followed up, \u201cIn my opinion, in another two years you should marry Miss Li Lu . I tell you ah, I want Miss Li Lu this daughter-in-law, and a few years later, I want to hold my grandchildren!\u201dGrandchildren?Cold sweat appeared on Huang Xiaolong\u2019s forehead, what is this and that .Li Lu\u2019s face was basically bright red at this point and there wasn\u2019t any temper due to embarrassment . Instead, in her clear bright eyes, there was happiness as she stole glances at Huang Xiaolong .Instead, it was Huang Xiaolong was felt awkward at this moment, and he directed a pleading look towards his father Huang Peng, but Huang Peng only shrugged his shoulders indicating he had no two ways about it .In fact, in this Martial Spirit World, marrying in in the teen years was not something out of ordinary; two years later, Huang Xiaolong and Li Li would both be seventeen .The awkward atmosphere in the main hall did not last long as Huang Xiaohai ran in from outside when he saw Huang Xiaolong present, he cried loudly: \u201cBig Brother! Big Brother!\u201dHuang Xiaohai\u2019s shouts broke the awkward atmosphere .Huang Xiaohai came back and started saying that there was a martial stage competition on the south side of the city and that it was very lively and he wanted to pull Huang Xiaolong along to go with him .Thus, Huang Xiaolong used it as an excuse and fled from the main hall .Deep into the night, silence was all around .The moonlight stretched Huang Xiaolong\u2019s shadow on the ground .Standing in the middle of his yard, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s left leg stepped out to the left, and he lowered his body into a squat while his upper body was straight up; both hands at his waist and his lower arms were balanced as if they were holding heavy objects . Adjusting his breathing as the spiritual energy gathered around him .Four years and Huang Xiaolong\u2019s Body Metamorphosis Scripture had broken through to the Sixth Stage \u2013 Claw Slashing Out like Wings; the Seventh Stage \u2013Nine Ghosts Pulling Sabers; and he had finally reached the Eighth Stage, the Three Diagrams on the Terrain . Now, he was aiming to break through the Ninth Stage soon: the Azure Dragon Stretching Out Claws .White mists came out from Huang Xiaolong\u2019s nostrils while at the same time, a white mist cloud swirled above his head, looking surreal .On Earth, they said an internal force expert when adjusting their breaths would have three flowers that would bloom above their heads, just like Huang Xiaolong now .Night gradually gave way to daybreak .When the morning sun came out, Huang Xiaolong finally stopped .After he stopped, Huang Xiaolong leaped up into the air and called out the Blades of Asura . With a swing, countless blades lights streaked out like a sea of lightning . At the same time, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body was somersaulting in midair as the lightning streaked, akin to a dragon swimming in the vast sea, and the oppressive aura covered all four corners .Four years . . . not only Huang Xiaolong had practiced Wrath of the Nether King until major completion, the fourth move, State of Abundant Lightning, had achieved a minor completion .The move Huang Xiaolong had displayed just now was the State of Abundant Lightning .In regards to the\u00a0Asura Sword Skill, the moves Huang Xiaolong had practiced so far were Tempest of Hell, Tears of Asura, Wrath of the Nether King, and the fourth being State of Abundant Lightning . Each attack skill was deeply profound and had unfathomable power, and every attack more powerful than the previous .This fourth move at major completion looked as if the attack transformed into countless lightning streaks, possessing the power to destroy heaven and earth .Huang Xiaolong turned in the sky and after a dozen breaths\u2019 time or so, he landed lightly on the ground .When Huang Xiaolong started to learn this move, he could only stay up in the air for four breaths\u2019 time .With this attack of State of Abundant Lightning, the turning he made in the air was not some simple somersaults as it followed a certain rule which made it much harder .Landing on the ground, Huang Xiaolong did not display the same move again, but he ran Asura\u2019s Tactics and his entire body was enveloped in a dark light, and a black murderous aura spread out as his hair slowly turned white and defied gravity . At this time, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s back actually grew a pair of dark black wings!After four years, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s Asura Tactics had reached the fourth level and could transform into an Asura\u2019s physique . The pair of black wings behind him was the Wings of Demon that grew after transformation .Spreading out, the wings could expand a width of six meters out on each side; with a flap, Huang Xiaolong flew up, reaching the average speed of a mid-Ninth Order .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s speed had always been on the faster side, and with the Wings of Demon, he could achieve a speed no less than a mid-Ninth Order .Huang Xiaolong turned a few laps around the small yard: one second he was at a corner and the next moment he was up high in the air . \u00a0The Wings of Demon coupled with his Phantom Shadow ability allowed Huang Xiaolong to reach a terrifying speed .Moments later, Huang Xiaolong ended his practice and came out from his Asura physique .\u201cTomorrow is the annual competition . \u201d Huang Xiaolong said to himself .After he had advanced into the Second Year Class, even though he was the winner in the class competition, he had never won the year category . But, from this day onwards, he would rule the Second Years .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Thus in comparison, \u00a0Fei Hou was much stronger than the average same level Xiantian experts .By the time Fei Hou and Huang Xiaolong arrived at the Academy\u2019s Holy Hall, there were already many people crowding the area .Huang Xiaolong\u2019s arrival turned him into one of the centers of attention .These past few years, although Huang Xiaolong practically never attended any of the classes and rarely appeared in the Academy, thereby keeping a low-profile, he still can\u2019t escape being a popular topic of discussion in the Academy .Also, ever since he was promoted to the Second Year, he held the winner title for the Second Year Class Six for four consecutive years by using only one move to defeat his opponent in every match .Quite a huge commotion swept through the crowd when they spotted Huang Xiaolong . Some die-heart fangirls shrieked excitedly, unable to control their emotions .\u201cHuang Xiaolong, you\u2019re so handsome!\u201d\u201cHuang Xiaolong, I love you!\u201dHuang Xiaolong was known for his talent and strength, but his looks weren\u2019t bad either, so it wasn\u2019t strange that many female students considered him as their knight in shining armor . In fact, this was not limited to the boundaries of the Academy\u2013 Huang Xiaolong\u2019s fame had reached the daughters of nobles in the Royal City and other counties too, as well as the commoners .Hearing the high-pitched shrieks of confessions Huang Xiaolong smiled helplessly in his heart while he walked towards the Second Years\u2019 seating area .Lu Kai had arrived earlier could not resist teasing,\u201cXiaolong, now your influence in the Academy has surpassed even Principal Sun Zhang!\u201dAlthough Lu Kai lost to Huang Xiaolong every time he challenged him, it helped build their sense of camaraderie and they had become good friends .Huang Xiaolong shook his head and laughed, \u201cDon\u2019t laugh at me, I think your influence is even bigger than mine!\u201dLu Kai being the Luo Tong Kingdom\u2019s Prince and the successor to the throne meant that his influence truly was not weak . After all, he was an actual Prince in many young girls\u2019 hearts .Hearing this, Lu Kai smiled and said, \u201cAre you aiming for the Second Year\u2019s champion? I heard that Chen Caixiu has broken through to the Ninth Order\u2013 she is not an easy opponent!Chen Caixiu was the Second Year champion for two consecutive years back to back .\u201cNinth Order already?\u201d Although a little surprised, Huang Xiaolong was not perturbed by the news .Noticing Huang Xiaolong\u2019s calm expression, Lu Kai continued to add, \u201cI advise you not to provoke that chick; her moves has always been ruthless, especially towards men . I\u2019m not sure how, but I heard how several foolish guys provoked her and in the end, their lower parts were nearly crippled!\u201d When Lu Kai said this, his legs involuntarily tightened in the middle .Huang Xiaolong smiled faintly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry . \u201dA short while later, Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu arrived at the Holy Hall, said some encouraging words, and proceeded to announce the starting of the competition .Like every year, the competition was divided into three large areas .Every class has a student nominated by the class teacher, and those who disagreed could issue a challenge on the stage .In the Second Year Class Six, Huang Xiaolong was the strongest and this was something recognized by the whole class while the second was Lu Kai instead of Ye Yong . In the past four years, Lu Kai also trained hard and his strength has surpassed the original number one, Ye Yong .Huang Xiaolong and Lu Kai stood on the stage .\u201cI don\u2019t believe that this time, I still can\u2019t take one move from you!\u201d Lu Kai looked at Huang Xiaolong and said .Ever since the two of them were promoted into the Second Year, he was defeated with just one move every year .Huang Xiaolong smiled, keeping silent .At this time, a dazzling light shrouded Lu Kai\u2019s body and his Sky Peng martial spirit was called out . Strong, violent battle qi towered to the sky as Lu Kai instantly soul transformed, not wasting a second; a layer of feather-like armored covered Lu Kai, and four powerful wings could be seen emerging from his back, spreading out, causing the surrounding air flow to become turbulent .\u201cColossal Decimation Fist!\u201dThe moment after Lu Kai soul transformed, he already moved and appeared inches away from Huang Xiaolong with his fist punched out, whistling across the air . The huge fist print swooped down on Huang Xiaolong, drowning the stage area in an eerie silence of decimation .This Colossal Decimation Fist was a battle skill Lu Kai had spent these past few years practicing, and he had finally succeeded two months ago . Although he knew even with the Colossal Decimation Fist that he would not be able to defeat Huang Xiaolong, Lu Kai believed he could block one attack of Huang Xiaolong\u2019s .Watching an enormous fist print blanketing him, Huang Xiaolong remained standing on the same spot looking like he had no intention to dodge . Instead, Huang Xiaolong attacked . His fist struck out, meeting Lu Kai\u2019s head on .The two fists collided, and a thunderous \u2018boom\u2019 resounded .The Colossal Decimation Fist shattered in the blink of an eye, and Lu Kai was seen wobbling back, falling out of the stage before steadying himself .When Lu Kai steadied himself, he was dazed for a moment, and then he shook his head and smiled wryly as he looked at Huang Xiaolong, \u201cIt seems I would need a miracle to win against you in my lifetime!\u201dHe still remembered the first time the two of them fought in the First Year competition . At that time, Huang Xiaolong needed to exert his full effort to defeat him, but when they advanced to the Second Year Class, he lost to Huang Xiaolong in just one move . Now, he barely had the courage to challenge Huang Xiaolong anymore .After Lu Kai was defeated, no one from the same class dared to challenge Huang Xiaolong . Thus, without any suspense, Huang Xiaolong was the Second Year Class Six winner once again .Next was the year competition .The Second Year had a total of six classes\u2013 to determine the final winner, there were three stages of competition .Among the six students, three came from the following classes \u2212 Class One, Five, and Six and they were chosen to draw sticks . However, when everyone saw Huang Xiaolong drew the number one stick, a soft commotion rippled through the crowd .Number one!It was actually the number one stick!Looking at the number stated on the stick, Huang Xiaolong could not resist shaking his head with a wry smile .Number one stick represented Chen Caixiu, the same person Lu Kai had mentioned earlier . The woman that was merciless towards men .Gazes followed Huang Xiaolong and Chen Caixiu as the both of them went up to the stage .Chen Caixiu wore a soft lavender dress, pretty yet she had the bearings of a noble . Not only was Chen Caixiu recognized as the Second Year\u2019s number one person, like Li Lu, she was one of the three famous beauties of the Cosmic Star Academy . Be warned, she was a rose full of deadly thorns; her decisiveness was just as well-known as her beauty .\u201cHuang Xiaolong, for Li Lu\u2019s sake, I will be gentler later . \u201d Chen Caixiu\u2019s eyes scrutinized Huang Xiaolong from top to bottom and said .Gentler?A woman saying such words to a man would definitely cause a misunderstanding . Subsequently, weird looks were directed towards the stage with the two of them from the crowd .Huang Xiaolong cast a glance at Li Lu; he knew Li Lu and Chen Caixiu were good friends . When Li Lu noticed Huang Xiaolong\u2019s sight on her, she grinned playfully at Huang Xiaolong, revealing two cute dimples .Huang Xiaolong relaxed his shoulders and returned his attention on Chen Caixiu, saying \u201cIf you want it this way, then start!\u201d Battle qi rushed out from Huang Xiaolong\u2019s body, and the strong momentum vibrated in the air .\u201cPeak late-Eighth Order!\u201dAll around, shock eyes fixed their stares at Huang Xiaolong .After experiencing a moment of blankness due to shock from Huang Xiaolong\u2019s revelation, Lu Kai smiled wryly inside \u2013 at the moment, he was only at peak late-Seventh Order whereas Huang Xiaolong had reached the peak of late-Eighth Order! At this moment, he truly understood the gap between them .Chen Caixiu was also staring at Huang Xiaolong with a surprised expression \u2013 peak late-Eighth Order! Huang Xiaolong will be fifteen after the coming New Year, right\u2026 . ?A fifteen-year-old peak late-Eighth Order?!Although she herself was an early Ninth Order, she was already twenty!According to Huang Xiaolong\u2019s cultivation speed, what level would he reach by the time he is twenty years old? Peak late-Tenth Order? It was truly possible!\u201cThis freak of a man!\u201d Chen Caixiu could not help muttering to herself .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although Chen Caixiu\u2019s voice was very low, Huang Xiaolong still caught her words . Helplessly, he smiled\u2013 must this Chen Caixiu be this direct\u201cIf it was six months ago, perhaps you could have won against me, but now, just relying on your peak late-Eighth Order\u2019s strength, it will be impossible to defeat me . \u201d At this time, Chen Caixiu spoke while shaking her head and she fully released her battle qi . A battle qi energy stronger than Huang Xiaolong\u2019s by many folds spread out .\u201cNinth Order!\u201dA flurry of surprised exclamations came from the crowd .Still, Huang Xiaolong maintained his calm; this Chen Caixiu really did break through to the Ninth Order .On the main platform .Sun Zhang\u2019s attention was on Huang Xiaolong, and he was smiling as he spoke to Xiong Chu, \u201cThis little guy is giving us another surprise\u2013 he actually reached peak late-Eighth Order in such a short time!\u201d\u201cYes ah, we initially thought he would need at least another year to reach this stage . \u201d Xiong Chu agreed, \u201cBut, Chen Caixiu is a Ninth Order, I\u2019m afraid the little guy won\u2019t be able to win this year!\u201dSun Zhang chuckled, \u201cNot necessarily\u2013 did you forget during his first year, at that time Lu Kai was already a Seventh Order, in the end, Xiaolong still won?\u201dXiong Chu hesitated, \u201cStill, Chen Caixiu is a Ninth Order ah . \u201d\u201cWhether he wins or not, we will know soon enough . \u201d Sun Zhang said: \u201cLet\u2019s wait for the result . \u201dAt this time on the stage, Chen Caixiu called out her martial spirit: an embroidery needle!A golden embroidery needle that was decorated densely with silver flowers .The Silver-Flowered Golden Needle was a type of grade seven martial spirit; even the appearance was no different than the usual sewing needle . However, to many people, it was a scary martial spirit because these types of martial spirit have terrifying attack power . The needle\u2019s size can be changed, from small to big, making it hard to defend against them .Chen Caixiu instantly soul transformed after calling out her Silver-Flowered Golden Needle, making her body glitter in silver and gold .Suddenly, Chen Caixiu swung both of her arms .\u201cRain of Flowers!\u201dAfter that, countless gold and silver needles emerged out of thin air that rotated at high speed as since they were flowers of gold and silver blooming in the sky, and it was truly a fascinating picture . In a heartbeat, Huang Xiaolong was surrounded .\u201cXiaolong careful!\u201d Li Lu exclaimed anxiously .As Li Lu\u2019s voice stopped, Huang Xiaolong was already gripping the Blades of Asura in his hands . Both hands swung out and a wave of bladed lights swept out and \u2018dang\u2019 sounds echoed endlessly . Those countless gold and silver needles were deflected by Huang Xiaolong .\u201cWrath of the Nether King!\u201d Huang Xiaolong suddenly swung out again, and crashing sounds vibrated in the air as the crowd watched two groups of bladed lights surge out like raging magma, like tens of thousand of beasts stampeding towards Chen Caixiu . The entire hall shook when Huang Xiaolong attacked using the Wrath of Nether King . The crowd was dumbstruck .\u201cGold Needle Silver Armor!\u201d Shocked, Chen Caixiu quickly waved her hands and the blooms of gold and silver flowers separated, returning to a sea of gold needles that formed into layers of armor on her body .A deafening crash filled the hall .The large force of the impact pushed Chen Caixiu back again and again .While Chen Caixiu was trying to gain a foothold, Huang Xiaolong\u2019s silhouette flickered past like a shadow .Martial spirit ability: Phantom Shadow .In a split second, Huang Xiaolong appeared in front of Chen Caixiu, and his fist punched out without hesitation .Collapse Fist!The effect overlapped and increases the power of the punch .In that situation, Chen Caixiu was flustered and in a haste, her palm shot out to block the attack .A fist against a palm; both shook from the impact but it was Chen Caixiu who was push back again . Chen Caixiu was in shock; she is a Ninth Order!Moreover, she had soul transformed! In this physique, her battle qi power was actually weaker compared to a yet-to-soul transform Huang Xiaolong .What kind of cultivation technique does this Huang Xiaolong practice?!\u201cNo Shadow No Form!\u201d Being forced by Huang Xiaolong until she reached the edge of the stage, Chen Caixiu was angry after getting over her shock . Again, her arms stretched out and countless numbers of gold needles pierced towards Huang Xiaolong . But these gold needles suddenly disappeared halfway, and the surrounding air returned to its calmness without the slightest fluctuations .This was the Silver-Flowered Golden Needle\u2019s strongest attack \u2013 No Shadow No Form, making it hard to defend against .\u201cI wonder how this little guy will counter Chen Caixiu\u2019s attack . If he can\u2019t, then the result is obvious!\u201d Xiong Chu mused aloud on the main platform .Sun Zhang was also focusing on Huang Xiaolong\u2019s figure on the stage, and like Xiong Chu, he was also very curious how Huang Xiaolong would break this attack from Chen Caixiu .Below the stage, Li Lu\u2019s heart tightened with worry . Including Lu Kai, Chen Feirong, and the rest of the class was staring fixedly on Huang Xiaolong .While everyone waited in suspense, Huang Xiaolong suddenly leaped up, his body turning nonstop and his blades slashed out . The crowd saw numerous bladed lights turn into lightning streaks; as Huang Xiaolong continued turning in midair, the lightning streaks became angrier .In the lightning flashes, the supposedly shadowless and formless gold needles became visible before the eyes and they were scattered away by the lightning .At the same time, the area of lightning expanded, covering the entire stage; unable to dodge, Chen Caixiu was struck by lightning and fell off the stage .Only after Chen Caixiu fell off did Huang Xiaolong gradually stop turning and landed on the stage, and the many flashes of lightning dissipated .Witnessing this result, the people around were stunned .This turn of events was too big that even Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu on the main platform had difficulty reacting in a timely manner . In the blink of an eye, Chen Caixiu actually lost!\u201cThat move that little guy used just now, did you recognize what battle skill it was?\u201d Moments later, Sun Zhang asked Xiong Chu after he recovered .Xiong Chu shook his head, \u201cI have cultivated for almost a hundred years and have never seen such a battle skill, but that move is probably a succedent to the battle skill he used to defeat Lu Kai . \u201dSun Zhang nodded in agreement and then said, \u201cThis kid didn\u2019t need to call out his Primordial Divine Black Dragon martial spirit to defeat Chen Caixiu . I think, if he calls out his Black Dragon martial spirit, he probably could defeat a mid-Ninth Order expert!\u201dAt this point, the students and teachers in the huge hall broke out in thunderous cheers and applause, especially Li Lu who was clapping with all her might, her beautiful eyes shining while looking extremely charming .Falling out from the stage, Chen Caixiu did not look devastated or upset; instead, it seemed like she was thinking of something as she looked at Huang Xiaolong .Chen Caixiu came beside Li Lu, smiled and said, \u201cLittle Sis, I really envy you . In another two years, when the two of you get married, remember to tell me . \u201dHearing this, Li Lu\u2019s lovely face blushed, \u201cSis, what are you saying~\u201dChen Caixiu laughed seeing Li Lu\u2019s shy expression .Soon, the First Year, Second Year, the Third Year, and the Academy overall results came out .Huang Xiaolong was rewarded with an early Grade Five Spirit Dan .When the event ended and everyone dispersed, Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu held Huang Xiaolong back and gave him another high Grade Five Spirit Dan .This had become a routine . Every year after the annual competition, other than the usual reward, Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu would give Huang Xiaolong another high Grade Five Spirit Dan .Of course, the two of them assumed the reason why Huang Xiaolong\u2019s cultivation advanced at such speed was due to this gift every year .In fact, they did not know that these Spirit Dans Huang Xiaolong was given were distributed to either his parents or siblings .After the Academy annual competition ended, Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou returned to Tianxuan Mansion .When they came back, Marshal Haotian was waiting for them in the main hall .\u201cStill no news of your Master Yu Ming?\u201d Huang Xiaolong asked . Four years has passed since Yu Ming departed to the Star Cloud Continent, returning to Asura\u2019s Gate headquarters . However, there was no news of him and since then, it was if he disappeared into thin air . In the last two years, Huang Xiaolong had asked Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou to look into news regarding Yu Ming .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
