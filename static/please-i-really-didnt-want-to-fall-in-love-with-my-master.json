    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1: Romance? I am a master at this!Xuanling Mountain, the apex of the Immortal Ascension PlatformA tall and imposing figure stood against the wind, his white clothes and long hair elegantly fluttering. Several disciples stood whispering not far away.\u201cSheng Zi* has been watching the scenery for three hours now, doesn\u2019t he need to cultivate?\u201d a young disciple curiously asked.[T/N\uff1a\u5723\u5b50/Sheng Zi, The disciple with the highest advancement in cultivation in the whole sect]\u201cHush, what the heck do you know! With Sheng Zi\u2019s cultivation level, a flash of enlightenment is far more important than cultivation. Be careful where you\u2019re headed lest you disturb Sheng Zi\u2019s comprehension!\u201d the senior disciple reprimanded in a low voice.Hiss!The young disciple immediately fell silent. Thinking of Sheng Zi\u2019s rumored ruthless persona, he couldn\u2019t help but shrink back and dared not say anything more.On the other side, the female disciples looked at Sheng Zi with adoring gazes.\u201cSheng Zi is worthy of being the reincarnation of the Great Immortal Emperor. He is entering a deep comprehensive state again!\u201d\u201cHis Excellency\u2019s comprehension has gone on for half a month, right? What a powerful comprehension skill!\u201d\u201cSheng Zi is so handsome!\u201d\u201cEven with his back facing us, I can still feel his aloof temperament!\u201d\u201cAh, I really want to become his Human Cauldron*\u2026\u201d[*TL note: \u201cHuman Cauldrons\u201d are victims who are drained of their vital energies by a malicious person. This is normally done through Dual Cultivation (sex).]\u2026However, at this moment, the \u201cSheng Zi\u201d Li Ran\u2019s mood was not good at all.\u201cWhat the hell are they talking about?\u201dComprehension?Yes, he knew every letter of this word, C-O-M-P-R-E-H-E-N-S-I-O-N. But when talking about the action itself, he could not understand a single thing about it. In fact, he stood there pretending to be in a deep state of comprehension.Half a month ago, upon arriving in this world of cultivation, Li Ran had just acclimatized to his new identity- Sheng Zi of the Devil Sect. The one well known for having temperamental outbursts and ruthless actions.He had once coveted a treasure. In order to attain it, he stirred up a fight between two big sects, leading to one of them being completely annihilated. He had also chased righteous sect disciples thousands of miles for an immortal inheritance once and completely wiped them out.Even for the disciples in his sect, as long as they offended him, the lightest punishment was suffering the pain of the flesh, the worst being crippling their cultivation. In short, he was a man devoid of the slightest compassion. He was an extremely indifferent egoist. A typical villain.But such a villain actually had a handsome appearance as if he was blessed by the Goddess of Beauty. He had star-shaped brows and sword-slitted eyes, even the sun and the moon would be eclipsed by his peerless appearance.So, no matter what wicked things he did, girls would still swoon over him.\u2026\u201cWhat a fuck, even if I am a villain, why cripple my cultivation base? Are you playing tricks on me, God?\u201d Li Ran couldn\u2019t help but grumble in his mind.He came to this world with his old memories intact. But the original cultivation base in this body was sealed, and he couldn\u2019t even utilize the most basic technique, let alone cultivate. In short, he was now a cripple with a Golden Core cultivation.In order to conceal the fact that he couldn\u2019t cultivate, Li Ran had to come here every day to pretend that he had sudden Dao enlightenment. But even so, he now couldn\u2019t stand pretending anymore.\u201cYour sister\u2026 Isn\u2019t this a scam!?\u201dOthers have golden fingers when they transverse through other worlds. Some having peerless magic weapons, some having peerless Cultivation Methods, some having powerful experts as their followers.\u00a0But what about me?Except for a lot of enemies, there isn\u2019t even a blade of grass left!\u201cSystem, if you don\u2019t show yourself now, do you believe that I will jump off this cliff and die with you together?!\u201d Li Ran gritted his teeth.\u3010A strong fluctuation has been detected from the host\u2019s emotions. The Daily Mission System has been activated. \u3011A cold voice sounded in his mind.Li Ran was startled, then he became excited. \u201cI just said that casually, but it turns out there really is a system!\u201d\u3010The Daily Mission System, a system of doing one good deed every day, dedicated to rehabilitating host\u2019s bad personality and turning over to a new leaf\u2026\u3011With a lot of information inundating his mind, Li Ran quickly collected his thoughts. To put it simply, the system would issue random tasks, and he could get rewards as long as he completed them. The higher the difficulty of the task, the more generous the reward would be.\u201cDo a good deed every day? You won\u2019t make me help an old woman cross the road, right? After all, I am the Devil Sect\u2019s Sheng Zi!\u201d Li Ran murmured silently.Why did he feel that this system seemed a bit unreliable?But having something was better than nothing. This was the world of cultivation where the strong prey on the weak. The law of the jungle was interpreted to the extreme here.In his current state, as long as he walked out of the sect, he would be devoured by enemies, and not even his bones would be left.\u201cSystem, hurry up and issue a mission! I have to quickly regain my strength.\u201d\u3010Since the host is too cold-blooded and isn\u2019t close to anybody, please go and seek a passionate love!\u3011 the system sounded.\u3010Mission: Within 24 hours, confess to the opposite sex and obtain the other party\u2019s consent to be her lover. After the mission is completed, you will get rewards! The quality of the reward depends on the task\u2019s completion progress!\u3011Li Ran: \u201c\u2014\u2014\u201dFall in love with\u00a0the opposite sex? This is a good deed?Why do I think that helping an old woman cross the road is better now?\u201cPlease! I am Sheng Zi!!! The cruel reincarnation of the Great Immortal Emperor! Now, you want me to confess? Can\u2019t this bitchy system respect me a little?\u201d\u3010If the task is not completed, the system will go to an indefinite sleep. Does the host choose to give up?\u3011\u201c Tsk , isn\u2019t it just making someone fall in love with me? I am a master at this!\u201d Li Ran\u2019s expression quickly changed as if he was a puppy trying to please its owner.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2: Confession Artifact!Confession\u2026\u00a0Li Ran fell into deep thought.This seemed very simple, but it had two difficult problems. First, the Youluo Temple* was a top-level devil sect. It had numerous rules and precepts, among which was a prohibition that could not be broken. It was forbidden to have a relationship amongst disciples.[*T/N: Youluo Temple is the name of the male lead\u2019s sect.]This rule had been personally issued by the sect master, Leng Wuyan, in hopes that the disciples would focus on cultivation. She herself set an example. She never had a scandal with anyone. There were even rumors of outsiders calling her a \u201cCold Steel Old Woman\u201d.Thinking of his beautiful master\u2019s punishing methods, Li Ran couldn\u2019t help but shiver. If this matter were to be revealed, he would be dead meat. However, in order to complete the mission, he could not waver.The second problem was whom to confess to. Li Ran was the Sheng Zi of the Youluo Temple, he should be indifferent and vicious. Confessing to a girl did not fit his personality.In order not to arouse others\u2019 suspicion, he had to guarantee his success in one swoop.Who do I choose\u2026After deep contemplation, Li Ran finally chose his junior sister as the confessional target. That girl was obsessed with him. She was like a bug creeping on him all day so his success rate should be very high.The most important point was that she was usually absent-minded, it seemed that her IQ wasn\u2019t high, so she wouldn\u2019t get suspicious.Thinking of this, Lin Ran decided to take action. Right now, he didn\u2019t have the mood to continue pretending anymore and descended from the mountain.Due to his cultivation base being blocked, his senses became duller. If he personally confessed to his junior sister, it\u2019s very likely for his confession to be seen by someone. So he decided to confess using a shadow stone, which was a lot safer.Inside the quiet room, Li Ran sat on a chair with a cyan stone in his hand. The cyan stone was called a shadow stone. It was a low-level artifact that couldn\u2019t even be regarded as an artifact.Due to its low quality, one\u2019s Qi was not even needed to activate it. As long as you injected your consciousness into the stone, the shadow stone would automatically generate the scene and voice that you wanted, and other people could see the content as long as they put their consciousness into it.In Li Ran\u2019s eyes, this was simply a confession artifact. But when he was planning to record a video, he discovered a major problem.He actually didn\u2019t know his junior sister\u2019s name!An insignificant character such as that junior sister was just a passerby for the previous owner of the body, why would he remember an insignificant person\u2019s name? This caused the current owner, Li Ran, to be less likely to know!Alright, since it is so, it\u2019s better not to say her name than to get it wrong.Li Ran closed his eyes and focused his mind on portraying the scene he wanted to show inside the stone.He first praised her beauty then expressed how much he loved her.\u00a0Omitting ten thousand words @$%#* that aren\u2019t suitable for children here\u2026With junior sister\u2019s innocence, he was certain his video would make her heart skip a beat and she would cry wanting to have his baby.In just a half of an incense stick\u2019s time, the video was done. Li Ran carefully checked and confirmed that there was no problem with the scene and then put the stone in a sandalwood box. He then furtively headed to the junior sister\u2019s residence.When he arrived, it just so happened that her window was open. Once Li Ran made sure that there was no one nearby, he threw the sandalwood box through the window and watched it land on the table.Anyway, the time limit is twenty-four hours. Even if the shadow stone doesn\u2019t work, I still have enough time to confess in person.With that, Li Ran clapped his hands and then left.\u2026After a while, amid a bustle of chatterings, several young female disciples appeared\u2026\u201cSigh, Elder Sun has already delayed me for too long. When I rushed to the mountaintop, Sheng Zi had already left,\u201d said one pretty girl.She was obviously disappointed at not being able to catch a glimpse of Li Ran in time.\u201cXinran, You keep pestering Sheng Zi every day. Be careful, if you were to displease him, he might catch you and turn you into his Human Cauldron!\u201d others joked.[TL note: Dual cultivation is consensual and has both sides benefit and get stronger, while cultivation using a human cauldron is closer to rape and only the person using the human cauldron benefits, not both parties. Usually, capturing a person as a human cauldron will provide faster results than dual cultivation.]Lu Xinran clenched her small fist and firmly said, \u201cIf I can increase the cultivation of Sheng Zi, what\u2019s wrong with becoming his Human Cauldron? I am willing!\u201d\u201cTsk, you really are a loyal supporter of Sheng Zi.\u201d\u201cOf course, I like lord Sheng Zi the most!\u201dThe girls talked as they returned back to their respective rooms.After entering the room, Lu Xinran languidly collapsed on the chair.\u201cSo tired~\u201dAt this time, a female disciple passed by her door and asked, \u201cIt should be the time to handle the pill for the assessment. Since I am visiting the sect master, do you want me to take yours to the sect master?\u201d\u201cYes, yes, of course.\u201dLu Xinran caught a glimpse of the sandalwood box on the table. Then she picked it up without much thought and handed it to the female sister, \u201cI have to trouble Sister.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dThe female disciple took the box and threw it into the storage ring alongside several boxes with similar designs.Leng Wuyan, the master of the sect, although a murderous female devil, she was very caring to her sect disciples. Especially for direct disciples on the main peak, she would regularly check their cultivation progress.Alchemy was one of the most important cultivation paths.The elders once advised her to not do everything personally. After all, she is an emperor-level powerhouse, so she had to keep her solemnity. But Leng Wuyan was very enthusiastic about this matter, so it became a tradition after the elder\u2019s efforts were in vain.\u2014Demon PeakWinter of the twelfth lunar monthIt was snowing heavily. A beautiful and peerless figure stood amidst the snow, her robe fluttered in the snowstorm looking like white waves.Leng Wuyan\u2019s eyes were filled with profoundness as she looked at the mountains in the distance. Nobody could guess what was on her mind.At this moment, a female disciple came over and presented her a jade stone.\u201cMaster, this is the information from the central mainland.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201dAfter Leng Wuyan took the jade stone, the female disciple backed off.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3: Please Be in a Relationship With Me!Leng Wuyan\u2019s hands shimmered in a faint light, instantly myriad words started spilling from the jade stone, arranging themselves into a readable form automatically.\u3010Fairy Cai Xia and Master Chi Mu established themselves as\u00a0Dao Companions.\u00a0Zhengyi Sect\u00a0added a new\u00a0Heavenly Tribulation\u00a0realm expert to their ranks.\u3011\u201cThat ugly woman Cai Xia found herself a\u00a0Dao Companion? Does Chi Mu have a problem with his brain or is he just blind?\u201d complained Leng Wuyan while reading this piece of news.She kept on scanning the information.\u3010Lin Yuan sect master of\u00a0Lieyang Sect, in order to assist his\u00a0Dao Companion\u00a0Mo Xiaoxian to overcome a\u00a0Heavenly Tribulation, used his physical body to fend off heavenly thunder, in the process damaging his cultivation base. The\u00a0Lieyang Sect\u00a0may fall off the list of first-class sects due to this development..\u3011Leng Wuyan raised her brows, \u201cResisting the heavenly thunder with his physical body just for a woman? Is Lin Yuan a fool? If the\u00a0Lieyang Sect\u00a0turns into a second-rate sect due to this, Lin Yuan will have committed a great sin towards his sect!\u201cSure enough, personal relationships between men and women will only affect people to make wrong judgments !\u201d she muttered dejectedly, though her expression resembled a person that has been fed ten catties of lemons.She read on.\u3010The sect master of\u00a0Five Elements Sect\u00a0and the Fairy of\u00a0Frozen Cloud Sect\u00a0became \u00a0Dao Companions\u2026\u3011\u3010Shentu Ye, the first\u00a0rank-three\u00a0expert of the Imperial Court, went to Lingyang Mountain to attend their wedding\u2026\u3011\u3010The ancestor of\u00a0Huanxi Sect\u00a0invented a high-efficiency\u00a0Dual Cultivation\u00a0method without stopping for 24 hours\u2026\u3011\u2026Crack!Leng Wuyan expressionlessly smashed the jade stone. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the news recently? Why is it filled with all this damn couple gossip?\u201dShe had her hands on her back, her face expressionless. \u201cThe world is not benevolent, the immortal road is merciless!\u201cWhat damned\u00a0Dual Cultivation, what damned\u00a0Dao Companionship\u2026 That group of idiots is clearly going astray! Why can\u2019t they be like me giving up the passion to follow the path of a pure heart? Concentrating on\u00a0Cultivation\u00a0and reaching the\u00a0Emperorlevel is just the only true path!\u201d Leng Wuyan sneered repeatedly.She had already cut off her seven emotions and six desires before she reached the age of 15. She concentrated all her energy on her cultivation and finally achieved this unparalleled level.\u201cLook back at those so-called geniuses of my generation! They are all troubled by love and such distractions, unable to achieve the peak of\u00a0Dao.\u201cI have become the sect master of\u00a0Youluo Temple, but they are still rolling in the dirt, unable to progress.\u201cIt\u2019s so stupid!\u201dJust like that, Leng Wuyan also forbade her disciples to pursue love.Although there were many gossiping behind her back, her faith never wavered. For hundreds of years, she has thought that her\u00a0Heart of Dao\u00a0was as solid as stone.But she didn\u2019t know why, when looking at the white snow-capped mountains, \u00a0her heart was a little disconsolate.Only the wind and snow accompanied here. It felt like she was lacking the slightest bit of warmth around her.If there was no accident, for the next 100 and even 1000 years, wouldn\u2019t she continue her lonely life like this?Leng Wuyan wrapped herself tighter in her robes.But why did she feel a chill at this moment? Undoubtedly, her Taoist body should be immune to sudden changes in temperature.Clop-clop~Footsteps sounded out behind her.\u201cMaster, all the pills made by the disciples have been handed in. Should I put their works in your study?\u201d the female disciple respectfully inquired.Leng Wuyan adjusted her expression, turned around, and answered, \u201cNo, just give them to me.\u201dShe needed to divert her attention and change her mood.\u201cOk.\u201d The female disciple submitted a storage ring and left.With that, Leng Wuyan looked for a secluded courtyard and sat down on a wooden chair.Cultivation was a very complicated thing. the slightest mistake or any omission might lead her to\u00a0Qi Derivation\u00a0and death. She already experienced that horrible moment herself. Therefore, on her first day as the sect master of\u00a0Youluo Temple, Leng Wuyan steeled her heart that she has to take responsibility for the disciples and not let them go astray in practice.While practicing alchemy, one could best see a person\u2019s character and cultivation.\u201cVery good, the progress of these disciples is promising.\u201d Leng Wuyan nodded in satisfaction. \u201cIt seems keeping them barred from love and relationships was the correct decision.\u201dThinking of this, her mood improved a lot. But as she took out the last pillbox, she noticed that the weight seemed to be wrong. It also lacked any kind of signature.After opening it, she saw a cyan-colored stone within it.\u201cHuh?A\u00a0Shadow Stone?\u201d Leng Wuyan frowned. \u201cWho fooled around with this thing?\u201dAt first, she wanted to throw it away, but after hesitating, she eventually projected her mind into it out of curiosity.\u201cI want to see who is so bold!\u201dAfter the\u00a0Shadow Stone\u00a0projected light in front of her, the scene changed. The background was still the\u00a0Demon Peak, but a tall and straight man appeared in front of her. He was dressed in white, sporting a handsome face, saying with a smile on his face: \u201cYou are here.\u201dLeng Wuyan was taken aback. That man turned out to be Li Ran.Why did he record a video? Was there something he couldn\u2019t talk about in person? Is it something difficult to say?She saw Li Ran looking at her and saying: \u201cThank you for being by my side all the time. You are like a ray of warm sunshine shining into my dark life\u2026\u201dLeng Wuyan shook her head and smiled. \u201cHe turned out to be thankful for me being his teacher. This kid, when did you learn to have manners?\u201dAt this time, Li Ran\u2019s video was still continuing. He \u201clooked at\u201d Leng Wuyan affectionately. With a deep and magnetic voice, he said: \u201cI like the rain in summer, the rainbow after the rain, and you .\u201dLeng Wuyan was taken aback once again, \u201cHuh?\u201dThis line seems a bit wrong, right?\u201cIn my eyes, billions of stars can\u2019t match your beauty.\u201d\u201cEeeh??\u201d\u201cI like you. Please be in a relationship with me!\u201d\u201c What??? \u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4: Li Ran\u2019s fierce offensive!Leng Wuyan looked at \u201cLi Ran\u201d, her mouth slightly opened and her phoenix eyes widened.She was shocked to the extreme. If she heard it right\u2026\u00a0It was a confession.Li Ran\u2019s image was still whispering, \u201cI found that I liked you very much yesterday, and I like you very much today, and I have a hunch that I will like you more tomorrow. In my eyes, billions of stars can\u2019t match your beauty.\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d Leng Wuyan\u2019s clothes fluttered and the snow on the entire Demon Peak shook under her powerful cultivation.Disgusting!Just too despicable!!!Looking at Li Ran\u2019s image she was shaking uncontrollably.Leng Wuyan had been single for hundreds of years. If there was a ranking for single dogs, she would be the strongest monarch on that list. Although it was her own decision to abandon love, the fact also was, no one had confessed to her at all. She was too powerful and her methods too ruthless. Her sight either garnered incessant flattery or evoked quaking fear in people. No one dared to pursue her. So she just remained single as a matter of course.But now, this status quo has been broken. Someone pursued her barefaced. Besides, this person was unexpectedly her disciple, her most outstanding disciple at that!As Leng Wuyan looked at Li Ran\u2019s image her hands trembled uncontrollably. \u201cThis rebellious scoundrel! You not only violate our sects taboo, but the one you pursue is me!?\u201dLeng Wuyan was shaking. She was pretty sure this was not a prank. The sect had a ban on marriage and love after all. Joking about this kind of thing was equal to openly seeking death. This was indeed Li Ran showing sincerity!Leng Wuyan withdrew from the\u00a0Shadow Stone. Her eyes reflected her complicated state of mind.She wanted to crush the stone, but when she recalled Li Ran\u2019s affectionate look and 'sincere\u201d words, she suddenly lost all of her strength.\u201cIs this how it feels to be confessed to\u2026\u201d\u201cRan\u2019er\u2026 he likes me?\u201d Leng Wuyan\u2019s heartbeat suddenly accelerated, and a myriad of complex emotions emerged in her heart.\u201cRan\u2019er is so indifferent most of the time. Even if I\u2019m his teacher, he never really got close to me, but I didn\u2019t really expect him to have hot emotions such as this buried in the depths of his heart!\u201d\u201cHe is extremely talented and owns a\u00a0Daoist Mark. He will definitely surpass me in the future. From this perspective, he is indeed a well-matched\u00a0Dao Companion.\u201d\u201cConsidering his looks, he actually is a handsome man!\u201cHow about\u2026 I give him a chance?\u201d Thinking of this, Leng Wuyan\u2019s heart started beating even faster. But then, she remembered something.\u3010Youluo Temple\u00a0strictly prohibits romantic relationships, and those who violate this will be expelled.\u3011This was the rule she personally set. Now, not only did she want to break it herself, but the other person was her own disciple. If this spread, she would turn into the world\u2019s laughing stock!\u201cNo, absolutely not!\u201d Leng Wuyan shook her head vigorously.She took the stone into her arms. \u201cAnyone there?\u201d\u201cYes, what is your command?\u201dA shadowy cloud squeezed in through a crack in the door, quickly coalescing into a human shape, kneeling on one knee.\u201cTell our Sheng Zi to come see me.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The shadow disappeared.Leng Wuyan looked at the heavy snow falling outside the window, not knowing what to think.\u2026At this moment, Li Ran paced across the room, a bit fidgety.Logically speaking, after seeing the Video Capture Stone, the junior sister should come to him as soon as possible. But now, it started getting dark, and there was still no movement outside.\u201cDid the box fall into the wrong place and she wasn\u2019t able to find it yet?\u201dJust when he was about to go out and check the situation himself a knock sounded from the door.He hurriedly sat back down. \u201cCome in\u201dThe door of the room opened, a cloud of black mist swept in. A deep voice rang in the air. \u201cSheng Zi, the sect master has summoned you. Proceed to Demon Peak.\u201dLi Ran\u2019s heart beat faster. \u201cOkay.\u201dThe black mist dissipated as if it had never appeared.\u201cThe master wants to see me now? Besides, she even sent her shadow guard to inform me\u2026 Is something big happening?\u201d Li Ran had a bad feeling about it.Whereafter, he casually put on a coat and left quickly.\u2026The Xuanling Mountains stretched for hundreds of miles. The Demon Peak was the highest mountain of the chain, towering into the clouds, and the peak\u2019s top was covered with snow all year round. Sect Master Leng Wuyan\u2019s palace was located just there.Li Ran was feeling nervous walking all the way towards the peak\u2019s top.He saw Leng Wuyan standing in a pavilion nearby, her back turned towards him.\u201cMaster, did you summon me?\u201d Li Ran stepped forward respectfully.Leng Wuyan turned to look at him with a complicated expression. \u201cRan\u2019er, I think your cultivation base has made no progress for half a month. Are you focusing on your cultivation? Or is your mind focused elsewhere?\u201dLi Ran\u2019s heart jumped, and he hurriedly said, \u201cMy mind has indeed been upset recently, which has affected my cultivation. But Master, rest assured, I will definitely adjust myself well.\u201dLeng Wuyan snorted. \u00a0If you think about that kind of thing every day, of course, you will get distracted!\u201cYou are very talented and have the prospect to become a great immortal emperor. In the future, you will definitely surpass me. You must concentrate on cultivation, and don\u2019t always think about those\u2026 strange things.\u201d Leng Wuyan persuaded.Li Ran\u2019s expression immediately turned serious and said, \u201cMaster, rest assured, apart from you and cultivation, I can\u2019t hold anything else in my heart!\u201dHe originally intended to flatter her, but when it reached Leng Wuyan\u2019s ears, the meaning completely changed.She blushed. Her eyes panicked, and she said, \u201cWhat are you talking nonsense? Why should you put me in your heart?\u201dSo strange, this was not like Ran\u2019er\u2019s character, the offensive is too fierce!Li Ran was also a little puzzled, feeling that his master was weird today.\u201cAlright, since you mentioned that, we should have an open talk! I want to ask you, how are you going to explain this\u00a0Shadow Stone?\u201d Leng Wuyan took out a cyan-colored stone.Li Ran was so frightened his soul almost departed his body.Shit! Isn\u2019t this the video of my confession to the junior sister!Damn it, this is game over, I\u2019m exposed!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5: Internal DialogueLi Ran panicked to death.Youluo Temple was ranked\u00a0top among the devil sects and his beautiful master was a force to be reckoned with. As an expert of the top sect in the entire vast land, the notoriety of the Demoness Leng Wuyan could even stop a child\u2019s sobbing. It\u2019s even said that she had killed enough people to build a mountain of bones.Moreover, the Youluo Temple had always been strictly disciplined. Those who violated the taboo would be expelled from the sect or even die.What\u2019s more, what he violated was Leng Wuyan\u2019s most taboo prohibition.This Shadow Stone must have been given to the Sect Master by junior sister!That girl actually betrayed me! What should I do now?\u00a0Li Ran started to rack his brain.As Li Ran was figuring a way out of this, Leng Wuyan sized up the youth in front of her.This kid is quite handsome! His face is as white as snow, and his skin is so delicate that women would be jealous. His sword-like eyebrows and starlit eyes are enticing. His figure is tall and well-proportioned. Even under my pressure, he is able to stand straight like a spear.What a brilliant young man!Even in the world of immortality, where there was no shortage of handsome men and beauties, Li Ran was definitely the best-looking one.Coupled with his terrifying cultivation talent, no one could refuse his confession, right?Even the ice block Leng Wuyan was a little moved!It turned out that someone liked me. Besides, he\u2019s such a genius too.But, I\u2019m his teacher, otherwise\u2026Leng Wuyan hurriedly shook her head vigorously.\u201cHe is my apprentice, what am I thinking about?\u201d She stabilized her mind and said icily. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to explain?\u201dLi Ran\u2019s heart trembled. Now that he\u2019d been caught, there was no room for denial.\u201cMaster, I have nothing to explain,\u201d Li Ran answered in a small voice.Leng Wuyan raised her brows, \u201cWhat do you mean by this?\u201dLi Ran said, \u201cThe scene and the words are self-explanatory. They are all made by me, I have nothing to explain.\u201dLeng Wuyan snorted coldly, \u201cYou know that the sect prohibits romantic relationships, and you, as the Sheng Zi, the heir, and the future sect master, actually took the initiative in breaking the rule. Do you think I would dare not punish you?\u201d Leng Wuyan\u2019s tone was extremely cold.Li Ran shook his head and replied, \u201cMaster, when I was creating the scene, I had anticipated the consequences.\u201dLeng Wuyan was taken aback. \u201cSince you know the consequences, why would you dare to\u2026\u201dLi Ran took a step forward, his eyes burning. \u201cBecause even the sect rules can\u2019t stop my sincerity!\u201dFor an instant, it seemed that the wind and snow had stopped.He was taking a gamble.Leng Wuyan, no matter how ruthless, was essentially a woman. He took on the guise of an infatuated man, a man who was willing to be punished in order to be with his junior sister. As long as he could soften his master\u2019s steel-like heart a bit, he would have a chance of living.Leng Wuyan\u2019s charming body trembled a bit, but she didn\u2019t expect him to have such courage. How dare he say such things in front of her? He was r-really presumptuous!\u201cI will pretend that I didn\u2019t hear anything today. You should abandon your feelings; it\u2019s impossible for me to agree.\u201d Leng Wuyan was extremely calm.Hearing this, Li Ran heaved a sigh of relief.I never expect you will agree! But this end is better than losing my small life, right?Anyway, the twenty-four hours time limit hadn\u2019t been reached yet, so he still had a chance to complete the mission.With that, just as he was just about to leave, Leng Wuyan\u2019s cold voice sounded again, \u201cIt seems that the reason why your cultivation has stagnated is just from this, so you will be punished. Go to the Youhan Cave to reflect on your mistakes. Come out after a month.\u201dLeng Wuyan\u2019s intent was not to punish Li Ran, but she didn\u2019t know how to face him.\u201cYouhan Cave?\u201d Li Ran frowned.\u00a0Trouble!This was a natural cavern on Mount Xuanling, the coldest part of the entire mountain range was condensed inside this cavern. If a mortal were to take a step inside, they would be frozen into a popsicle in a single breath.Only those at the Golden Core stage and above could bear with the chill inside as they had cultivated the Youluo Temple\u2019s Cultivation Method.If he was the original Sheng Zi, this punishment was nothing, but it\u2019s different now.Li Ran\u2019s cultivation base was sealed at present. He couldn\u2019t use the Youluo Temple\u2019s Cultivation Method. He would definitely freeze to death once he went inside!Even if he were to survive by chance, he would also fail the mission.No! I can\u2019t enter the Youhan Cave!\u00a0Li Ran has made a decision.He strode forward, his high voice pierced the snowstorm. \u201cMaster, forgive me, I can not obey you!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Leng Wuyan\u2019s expression turned colder. \u201cAccording to our sect rules, anyone who violates this taboo shall have their cultivation abolished and expelled from the sect!\u201d\u201cYou have a great future and this is your first time making a mistake, so I decided to give you a chance. But you are unwilling to accept such a light punishment?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Li Ran said loudly. \u201cSince it\u2019s your command, no matter if it\u2019s one month, five years, or ten years, I dare not complain!\u201dLeng Wuyan asked in doubt, \u201cThen why do you say that you can\u2019t obey me?\u201d\u201cWhat I can\u2019t obey is the order to make me abandon my feelings. Only this one matter, I\u2026I really can\u2019t obey!\u201d\u201cThe person I like is the most beautiful existence in the world and has completely stolen my heart.\u201d\u201cIf you make me forget this feeling, isn\u2019t it equal to digging my own heart out!?\u201d\u201cTherefore, please forgive me for not being able to follow!\u201d Li Ran\u2019s voice trembled, his words were filled with sincerity.Leng Wuyan: \u201c!!!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6: Please, I really didn\u2019t want to fall in love with my master!\u201cY-you \u2026 what nonsense are you talking about?!\u201d Leng Wuyan said in a flustered tone.Bright red crept from her ears to her pretty cheeks.\u201cHmph! Even if you are sincere, the gap between us is too big. Stop your wishful thinking! \u201dLi Ran nodded.Indeed, compared with his status as Sheng Zi, his junior sister wasn\u2019t a girl worthy of him. But if he wanted to restore his cultivation, what other choice did he have?\u201cI understand everything you said, master, but I believe that even if there are mountains and seas between two lovers, they still can be removed and filled up as long as the two are sincere!\u201dLeng Wuyan was stunned.To pursue me, Ran-er dares to remove mountains and fill up seas!\u201cBut do you understand the prowess of rumours? It will ruin you! If I really agree, you are likely to be universally condemned!\u201d Leng Wuyan said.Li Ran said sincerely, \u201cEven if everyone condemns me, I\u2019m not afraid at all. For this is true love, I don\u2019t care about any rumours!\u201d\u201cYou \u2026\u201d Leng Wuyan bit her lip, endless thoughts were battling in her mind.Even though she had hundreds of years of experience, facing his fiery heart, she still didn\u2019t know how to deal with it.Love?\u00a0The word made her feel strange, but she also had a faint longing for it.Leng Wuyan\u2019s eyes were complicated, and she whispered, \u201cWhat if you lose your life because of this?\u201dLi Ran did not hesitate, \u201cAs long as I can be with the one I love, even if I die, I won\u2019t regret it!\u201dLeng Wuyan was silent. Li Ran looked at her nervously.After a while, she turned her head and said, \u201cSince that\u2019s how it is, you can go die!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Li Ran didn\u2019t have the time to react before the skies suddenly began to spin, and a strong sense of weightlessness engulfed him, and the fierce howling of the winds resounded in his ears.He was in a free fall!???He was thrown down by Leng Wuyan from the top of the Demon Peak!?\u201cFuck, I went too far, this girl doesn\u2019t play by logic! This time, I\u2019ll really end up dead meat!\u201dLi Ran\u2019s cultivation base was sealed. If he fell from a precipice of over thousands of meters, he would die!He closed his eyes looking at the ground that was rapidly drawing closer in despair.But just before he hit the ground, he smelled a fragrant light breeze, and then both his feet had stepped on the stable ground again.When he opened his eyes again, he saw that he was still standing on the top of the mountain; It was as if he had never moved.Leng Wuyan\u2019s eyes had a complicated look in them. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you channel your cultivation? Did you really want to die?!\u201dChannel my cultivation? Do you think I don\u2019t want to?Li Ran\u2019s lips were pale, and with the last bit of his strength, he grabbed her beautiful wrist.\u201cIf I can\u2019t be with my lover, what\u2019s the meaning of being alive to me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Leng Wuyan\u2019s psychological defence was completely broken.Li Ran is really willing to die to be with me!Although there is a big identity gap between us now, with his talents, he will reach the emperor level one day.The most important thing is that for this feeling, he isn\u2019t afraid of gossip, and dares to trample anything in his way. Even if he\u2019d have to lose his life, he won\u2019t show a moment of hesitation.How could Leng Wuyan refuse such fierce emotions?\u201cMaster?\u201d Li Ran looked at her expectantly.Leng Wuyan shyly didn\u2019t dare to look back at him. Her pair of phoenix eyes were filled with water, and she replied in a low voice. \u201cDon\u2019t stare at me in that way. I \u2026 I accept.\u201d\u201cLong live Master!\u201d Li Ran hugged her excitedly.Unexpectedly, not only did his master not punish him but permitted the relationship between him and his junior sister instead. Wasn\u2019t she pointing out that he could pick up girls without fear anymore?\u201cYou \u2026 you stop. You\u2019re so impatient. As soon as I agree with you \u2026\u201d Leng Wuyan blushed and broke free from his arms, flying away.Li Ran scratched his head, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I got too excited.\u201d\u201cAlthough I gave you my permission, this rule is set by me after all. This matter must not reach others\u2019 ears!\u201d Leng Wuyan ordered.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have tight lips.\u201d Li Ran nodded.He couldn\u2019t wait for a second more to take down his Junior Sister!At this moment, a system notification rang in his head.\u3010Mission complete\u3011\u3010Confession Target: Leng Wuyan\u3011\u3010Difficulty: Purgatory\u3011\u3010Success rate: 0.0001%\u3011\u3010Degree of completion: Perfect\u3011\u3010Congratulations to the host for completing the mission perfectly.

Wasn\u2019t it you that put the stone in the pillbox and gave it to me \u2026? Don\u2019t do something like this in the future. If someone else finds out, our relationship will be exposed.\u201dLi Ran: \u201d\u2026\u201dHe immediately understood everything.His junior sister didn\u2019t snitch but had mistakenly given the box to his master.Because he didn\u2019t say her name throughout his confession, his master thought he was confessing to her.And they weren\u2019t even on the same channel right from the start!I just wanted to woo the Junior Sister! I never expected to woo the Master instead!\u00a0Li Ran wanted to weep but had no tears.\u201cPlease, I really didn\u2019t want to fall in love with my master!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7: Mission Reward: Super Treasure Box!Was Leng Wuyan attractive?Of course!A lustrous black hair and a white and delicate cheeks that had a pink hue on it. Beneath the red lips were a pair of tidy and white jade-like teeth. Her beautiful eyes sparkled with soulful vibrance.When she returned with a smile, even the sun and moon would be eclipsed by her beauty.Even if her body was being covered by a large robe, it still couldn\u2019t hide her breathtaking figure. Instead, it gave her an impression of cold and aloof beauty.All right, in short\u2026Li Ran had never seen such a beautiful girl in both of his lives!But if anyone thought it\u2019s a lucky matter to be in a relationship with such beauty, they would sadly find how wrong it was.Who was she?She was Leng Wuyan!The sect master of Youluo Temple!An existence standing at the peak of the entire vast land!She had once pressured an entire righteous sect alone just because one of their disciples killed her disciple. She eradicated the whole sect with one sword move because they refused to hand over the murderer.A famous first-class righteous sect was directly eradicated in this way!All members\u2026 dead!This incident shook the entire vast land.For this reason, several major righteous sects held a Demon Slaying Conference for this event. The conference\u2019s sole purpose was to suppress the Demoness Leng Wuyan.However, regardless of which righteous sect the experts belong to, they all ended up dead one way or another. Their bodies and skeletons were fully piled up the road of the Youluo Temple.\u00a0Their blood painted the entire Demon Peak crimson. Leng Wuyan, on the other hand, didn\u2019t even get a scratch.Since then, the name \u201cDemoness Leng\u201d has become a taboo existence in the vast land. If Li Ran was a little devil, then Leng Wuyan was the ultimate boss!To fall in love with such a girl, his life was no longer his own, but in Leng Wuyan\u2019s grasp.The pressure was huge!At this moment, could Li Ran say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I made a mistake. I didn\u2019t want to confess to you?\u201dOf course not. That was purely seeking death.\u201cForget it, let\u2019s take one step at a time\u2026\u201d Li Ran was dejected.\u2026\u201cRan\u2019er\u2026\u201dLeng Wuyan\u2019s face blushed. This was originally a normal appellation, but under current circumstances, it made her feel indescribably shy.\u201cThe immortal path is boundless. If you want us to stay together forever, you have to be standing at the peak.\u201d\u201cYou must cultivate hard and never slack off.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I will wait for you at the top.\u201dLeng Wuyan didn\u2019t wait for Li Ran before disappearing into the snowstorm.Li Ran was stunned for a moment, then nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right, the road to immortality is boundless. But one day, I will climb to the peak and stand on top of the entire vast land!\u201d\u201cBut of course, before that, I have to live well under my master\u2019s \u2018care\u2019\u2026\u201d Li Ran sighed before he turned around and walked down the mountain.However, he didn\u2019t know that inside the snowstorm, a figure reappeared in the place he had just left.Leng Wuyan looked at his back, her eyes seemed moist.Thinking of Li Ran\u2019s shocking remarks and his determination to die for her, Leng Wuyan\u2019s cheeks became hot.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d\u201cIs this what it feels like to be liked?\u201d\u2026Li Ran returned to his dwelling.His back was still sweating when thinking back about the talk with his Master today.\u201cAlthough the process was thrilling, the results were fortunately good. Not only did I restore my cultivation base, but I also got three treasure chests.\u201dLi Ran focused his attention on the system. Three golden treasure chests appeared in front of him; these chests were the rewards for over-fulfilling the task this time.\u3010Do you want to open the Super Treasure Chest?\u3011\u201cYes.\u201d Li Ran rubbed his hands in anticipation.The lid of the treasure chest opened, and a brilliant golden light flashed in front of him.\u3010Congratulations to the host for obtaining the \u201cHeaven Seizing Cultivation Method\u201d!\u3011\u3010Congratulations to the host for obtaining the \u201cYunling Spear\u201d! \u3011\u3010Congratulations to the host for obtaining the \u201cDragon Elephant Zetian\u201d!\u3011The \u201cHeaven Seizing Cultivation Method\u201d was an ancient book. Inside the book were different symbols and words that are incomprehensible. Li Ran couldn\u2019t recognize any of them.He tried to sink his mind in the book, immediately, a bright light flashed in front of his eyes.These mysterious symbols exuded golden light and poured into his mind like a tide.\u201cSeize the profound mystery of the heavens, Achieve the Dao!\u201d\u201cPlunder the heavens, Become the indestructible supreme true god!\u201d\u201cReplace heaven\u2019s law with my law, Supplant heaven\u2019s will with my will!\u201d\u201cSeize the heavens!\u201dAs if there were many Dao\u2019s melodies ceaselessly ringing in his ears, it shocked Li Ran\u2019s mind into a kind of unstable state, and soon his consciousness plunged into darkness.He didn\u2019t know how long it passed, and a golden light lit up in the darkness. Then, it instantly lit up his whole sea of consciousness just like how a spark ignited the whole forest.The next moment, a small figure that was translucent like an amethyst appeared cross-legged in his sea of consciousness. Its figure was engraved with myriad golden symbols.The text on the ancient book shined brightly as a golden tattoo.\u201cAmazing!\u201d Li Ran opened his eyes, and golden light shone out.This ancient book was not only a great cultivation method but also could change his physique.That tiny figure stayed in his sea of consciousness and continuously absorbed Qi. His body, dantain, meridians, and even spirit were constantly tempered by the tiny figureIn short, Li Ran could cultivate without meditating now.\u201cWhat great luck, this is simply a cheating treasure for lazy people to cultivate! It\u2019s too suitable for me!\u201d Li Ran\u2019s mouth couldn\u2019t stop his mouth from grinning.The second reward was the Yunling Spear. This was a high-level artifact, which could be stored inside the owner\u2019s body, and its power improved alongside the owner\u2019s strength.Theoretically, as long as the user was sufficiently strong, there was no limit to the grade of this weapon. Besides, the spear came with a Spear Cultivation Method. which included four spear moves; all of them were extremely powerful.Li Ran pinched his chin and looked at the two-meter-long silver spear in front of him. \u201cTo one day fly with a sword is a man\u2019s romance, but to fly with a spear\u2026 Besides, a rough weapon such as this doesn\u2019t match my appearance.\u201d\u201cForget it, let\u2019s bear with it for now. If the spear doesn\u2019t fit me, I can change it later.\u201d Li Ran put the silver spear away.If Yunling Spear had appeared in the central mainland, a war would have happened.But a weapon of this caliber was actually disliked by Li Ran\u2026How insatiable!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8: What should I do in this relationship?The final reward was a Qi manifestation\u00a0skill called \u201cDragon Elephant Zetian\u201d. The skill was shrouded with mystery.As for the skill\u2019s effects, it could vary depending on the usage (such as one of them permanently strengthening the user) and could not be explained in a word or two.Currently, Li Ran didn\u2019t want to test out the skill here yet. If he had alerted the experts in the sect, he would have no explanation on the skill\u2019s origin.\u201cI\u2019ll go to sleep first, I hope that after tonight, Master will forget everything that happened today\u2026\u201d With that, Li Ran stored the Yunling Spear inside his body and went to bed.In the meantime, the amethyst-like figure in his sea of consciousness was still cultivating tirelessly, and a large amount of Qi was guided towards Li Ran\u2019s body.\u2014Sect Master Palace, Demon Peak.Leng Wuyan sat on the bed in a daze, her eyes empty as if she had lost her soul.I can finally bid farewell to being single.But\u2026 the object of love is actually my disciple\u2026Her fair and delicate cheeks flushed.I was too impulsive, how could I accept Ran\u2019er\u2019s confession?Even though he is indeed good-looking and talented and his feelings for me are sincere\u2026\u2026He\u2019s my disciple!Leng Wuyan could already imagine the uproar inside the sect if this matter were to be exposed.Once the rumors broke out, her reputation inside the sect would change from \u201can old woman who no one wants\u201d to \u201ca pervert who sexually harassed her disciple\u201d!Though she had nerves of steel, she absolutely couldn\u2019t accept this title.Besides, the most important thing was how she would face Li Ran in the future if that happened.For hundreds of years, Leng Wuyan concentrated on cultivation and didn\u2019t know anything about men and woman relationships.Her relationship with Li Ran was completely beyond her cognitive range.\u201cOh~\u201d Leng Wuyan rubbed her eyebrows, looking melancholy, \u201cWhy did I agree with him at that time\u2026\u201dBut it\u2019s too late to say anything now. According to Li Ran\u2019s earlier actions, if she broke up with him, he would directly choose to commit suicide, right?Thinking back on Li Ran\u2019s firm eyes and tone at that moment, Leng Wuyan\u2019s heart fluttered, and she rolled around on the bed shyly, showing nothing of a sect master in her.Bang! Bang! Bang!A knock on the door alarmed her.At an instant, Leng Wuyan sat in an upright manner.\u201cCome in.\u201dThe door was pushed open, and a deaconess walked in and said respectfully, \u201cMaster, excuse me. I am here to get the results of the pill assessment.\u201d\u201cAssessment?\u201d Leng Wuyan couldn\u2019t help but think of Li Ran\u2019s confession, and started to be shy again. \u201cI haven\u2019t finished checking the pills yet. I\u2019ll hand the results to you tomorrow.\u201dHer heart was so messy today, how could she have the time to check those pills?\u201cAll right.\u201d The deaconess did not question her, she only said, \u201cI will take my leave, Master.\u201d\u201cWait!\u201d Leng Wuyan stopped her in an unconscious manner.The deaconess stopped. \u201cIs there anything else, Master?\u201dShyness flashed through Leng Wuyan\u2019s eyes, but she pretended to ask, \u201cHave you ever been in love?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d The deaconess was taken aback, then she broke down in a cold sweat and knelt on the ground with a plop.\u201cMaster, I have always abided by the sect\u2019s rules and am not interested in men. If I have ever done anything beyond those scopes, please teach me a lesson!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Leng Wuyan rubbed her eyebrows helplessly, \u201cGet up now, when did I say you did something wrong?\u201dThe deaconess was still not at ease, \u201cThen why are you asking that?\u201dLeng Wuyan said with a poker face, \u201cKnow yourself and the enemy, and you can always win. Although I have cut off myself from worldly affairs, I can\u2019t be ignorant of them. This is not conducive to cultivate.\u201d\u201cEr\u2026yes,\u201d the deaconess nodded.\u201c Ahem, \u201d Leng Wuyan said solemnly, \u201cI\u2019ll ask you again. If you have a boyfriend, what do you want to do with him most?\u201dThe deaconess hesitated and dawdled to answer.Leng Wuyan added, \u201cWe are discussing cultivation. Just voice out your thoughts, I will not punish you.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d The deaconess no longer hesitated, she looked forward and said, \u201cThere are many things we can do, such as dating, listening to music together, eating desserts together\u2026\u201d\u201cDating, listening to music, eating desserts.\u201d Leng Wuyan took a small notebook and secretly jotted down the information.The deaconess continued to fantasize, \u201cIf the relationship is one step closer, you can hold hands and kiss. Of course, you have to sleep together in the end\u2026\u201dBang\u2026Leng Wuyan unintentionally squeezed the corner of the bed into powder and stammered, \u201cS-sleep together?!\u201dThe deaconess was shocked and hurriedly said, \u201cI only heard of it from others. Whether that is necessary, I don\u2019t know at all!\u201d\u201cI see, you can leave.\u201d Leng Wuyan turned her head and said.\u201cYes.\u201d The deaconess breathed a sigh of relief. For some reason, she felt that the sect master was strange today.The sect master is not as cold as her past self. She has a bit more worldly characteristics, just like a girl next door\u2019s premature love.\u201cIs Master in love?\u201d\u201cNo, no, impossible! It must be my imagination, yes, yes that cannot be it\u2026\u201d The deaconess was shocked at her own thoughts.At this moment, Leng Wuyan cupped her hot cheeks. \u201cDating\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9: If you\u2019re a genius, face me in battleDue to his sealed cultivation base, Li Ran didn\u2019t even manage to sleep well the past half a month.Finally, having returned to normal, his tense nerves could relax again.He managed to sleep sweetly tonight.\u201cSheng Zi, wake up.\u201dA soft voice rang in his ears. Li Ran opened his eyes slightly, seeing a beautiful girl standing by the bed, his clothes in hand.\u201cSheng Zi, it\u2019s time to eat breakfast,\u201d the beautiful sister whispered.Her name was Aqin. Originally a noble daughter of the Shen family, she angered the Li family, which ended in her whole family being annexed. She herself ended up becoming Li Ran\u2019s maid later on.But this was not the end of her tragic fate.After she came to\u00a0Youluo Temple,\u00a0Li Ran took her in to serve him in his daily needs. It\u2019s not because of how much he liked her. On the contrary, Aqin suffered quite a torment under his hands. Scoldings and beatings were just part of her general treatment. If not for the sect\u2019s rules prohibiting relations between men and women, she would have already ended up as his\u00a0Human Cauldron.As for why Li Ran decided to take her in, it was mostly because she was as obedient as a dog.\u201cAqin is wrong. Please punish me, Sheng Zi!\u201dWhen Li Ran\u2019s gaze fell on her body, Aqin fell into a panic, immediately dropping down on her knees.Seeing her still bruised body, Li Ran couldn\u2019t help but shake his head.\u00a0Such a beautiful girl, how could the previous owner of my body do something like that to her?\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong. You don\u2019t have to apologize to me,\u201d Li Ran said.Aqin became even more panicked when she heard this. She suddenly banged her head on the ground.\u201cAqin is wrong, please punish me!\u201d she prostrated herself on the ground, her body trembling uncontrollably. Evidently, her fear was at its worst.Li Ran sighed. A psychological trauma like this, acquired over many years, couldn\u2019t just be healed overnight. With just a sudden change in temperament, she would eventually still hold doubts. The best way would be to keep the current status quo and slowly change it over time for the better.\u201cGet up and help me dress,\u201d he said lightly.\u201cYes.\u201d Aqin stood up and served Li Ran skillfully and gently.He was dressed in a pure white brocade robe with silver openwork trimming on its inside.Sporting a piece of transparent jade hanging on his pristine white belt on his waist, he looked as handsome and noble as a charming and elegant lord.Aqin looked at him without blinking.\u201cDo I look good?\u201d Li Ran asked.Aqin nodded earnestly, \u201cSheng Zi is the best!\u201dLi Ran couldn\u2019t help but pinch her small face. \u201cYou have good eyes, girl.\u201dAfter speaking to her, he got up and left. With him gone the room turned quiet.Aqin covered her cheek, opening her small mouth slightly, her eyes filled with disbelief.She stood frozen in place, like a statue, for a long time.\u2014After breakfast, Li Ran wandered around with his hands behind his back.Due to his\u00a0Heaven Seizing Cultivation Method, he was able to cultivate at all times no matter what he was doing, so there was no reason for him to focus on meditation anymore.Which in terms just meant he had nothing to do.\u201cHello, Sheng Zi.\u201d\u201cHail Sheng Zi!\u201dAll the disciples he met along the way greeted him respectfully. Though Li Ran kept \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a cold and indifferent expression throughout all of this.\u201cSheng Zi!\u201d At this time, a soft cry sounded out behind him.Li Ran turned his head and saw a pretty girl standing behind him. Her eyes narrowed to crescents as she smiled at him.\u201cJunior Sister?\u201d Li Ran raised his brows.If someone had to be blamed for the misunderstanding between him and the sect master the day before it should be her.Lu Xinran smiled happily. \u201cGood morning, Sheng Zi. I haven\u2019t seen you for just one day and it seems you have become even more handsome.\u201dDo I need your reminder?Li Ran said coldly, \u201cGood morning, why are you standing here instead of going to cultivate?\u201dEvidently, Lu Xinran was already accustomed to his attitude. She smiled, \u201cSheng Zi, I have made rapid progress in my cultivation. I am now in the late stage of Qi Refining and\u00a0even Elder Sun called me a little genius!\u201dHer tone was rather coquettish, similar to a child waiting to be praised.\u201cWhat does it matter to me?\u201dBefore Li Ran could speak these words, the system\u2019s voice sounded out in his head.\u3010New mission available. \u3011\u3010Please give guidance to the junior sister\u2019s cultivation problems to help her make progress.\u3011\u3010The quality of the reward depends on the degree of the completion of the task!\u3011Li Ran\u2019s heart started beating faster. He had tasted the sweetness of yesterday\u2019s rewards. There was just no way he would let this one go.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to give guidance, but to actually have someone achieve progress in their cultivation with just that is a different matter. This one doesn\u2019t seem like something I can achieve with just a few words.\u201d\u201cMoreover, helping others is not exactly in line with my personality.\u201d\u201cIt looks like I have to think of some other means\u2026\u201dAfter a few moments, he thought of an idea.\u2014\u201cSheng Zi?\u201d Lu Xinran was still waiting for his praise.\u201cGenius? Oh, are you now?\u201d Li Ran sneered.Lu Xinran pouted and was not satisfied with his words. \u201cElder Sun said it personally. He said that I am very talented and our sects cultivation method is a good fit for me. He said my future achievements will be very great!\u201d\u201cTalent\u2026hehe\u201d Li Ran shook his head and said, \u201cYou are sixteen years old this year, right? When I was your age, I had already entered into the\u00a0Golden Core state. Meanwhile, you are still only at\u00a0Qi Refining.\u00a0You couldn\u2019t even reach\u00a0Foundation Establishment\u00a0so far.\u201d\u201cWith such low talent, you dare to call yourself a genius in front of me?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous!\u201dLi Ran\u2019s indifferent voice was as cold as winter itself.The disciples on the side couldn\u2019t help but shudder. This really was our Sheng Zi\u2019s style. He was just unrelenting!Lu Xinran\u2019s small mouth slumped into a frown. Her round eyes suddenly filled with tears.Li Ran said with a poker face, \u201cDo you not believe me?\u201dLu Xinran bit her lip, lowered her head, and said nothing.\u201cNevermind, then I\u2019ll give you a chance to prove yourself.\u201d\u201cHow do I prove myself?\u201d Lu Xinran raised her head.\u201cFight with me.\u201d Li Ran said casually.\u201cWhat?!\u201d Lu Xinran froze in place.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10: Lu Xinran got a great beating!Lu Xinran, gladly, took her position in the Martial Arts Field. She bowed her head, her body slightly shivering.Meanwhile, Li Ran took his place opposite her with his hands behind his back, appearing to be fully relaxed. The both of them formed two sharp contrasts.This time\u2019s fight seemed to have caused a great uproar, attracting almost all disciples from the main peak.Among the noise, the crowd gathered around the ring.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cSheng Zi is going to fight with Junior Sister!\u201d\u201cAhem! Why? Isn\u2019t this a small worm shaking a big tree!?\u201d\u201cJunior Sister Lu angered Sheng Zi just now. She is really unlucky this time around.\u201d\u201cBefore that, I have already told her not to pester Sheng Zi or she will regret it!\u201d\u201cJunior Sister Lu is very talented. I hope that Sheng Zi will show mercy and not cripple her cultivation.\u201d\u201cWith Sheng Zi\u2019s merciless personality, Junior Sister Lu this time will\u2026 alas!\u201dAt this time some female disciples who had a good relationship with Lu Xinran had already rushed to call the elders.The reason for that was, that no one that angered Shen Zi in the past ended well.Only the elders could possibly save Lu Xinran now.Nearby, a graceful figure slowly floated down. Her eyes tightly locked onto Li Ran.\u201cRan\u2019er?\u201d\u2026In the ring, Li Ran raised his index finger and lightly said, \u201cThe gap between our realms is too large. I won\u2019t bully you. I will not use my cultivation base nor will I use spirit weapons. I will only use this finger.\u201d\u201cWithin the time of a stick of incense, you can use any method. As long as you can hit me once, I\u2019ll consider it as your win.\u201dNot using cultivation and just using one finger? Such contempt for me!\u201cAm I so bad in the eyes of Sheng Zi?\u201d Lu Xinran felt a little aggrieved.\u201cAre you ready?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dLu Xinran slowly clenched her fists, her eyes firm.Even if she knew she was not his opponent, she must do her best to prove herself to him.\u00a0She was qualified to stand beside him!\u201cLet\u2019s start then.\u201d Li Ran hooked his finger and stood in a lax and unguarded way.Lu Xinran exhaled, and her cultivation base began to circulate rapidly.\u201cInstant Shadow Kill!\u201d From one moment to the next she disappeared from where she stood just moments ago. In the blink of an eye, she appeared behind Li Ran. Her hands slashing towards his neck akin to a knife.Instant Shadow Kill, one of the top-secret attack skills in Youluo Temple.One\u2019s body could transform into a shadow, ending the target\u2019s life in one blow!But as soon as she moved her hands, Li Ran\u2019s slender index finger already touched her throat.Lu Xinran\u2019s eyes widened in shock.\u201cScreaming so loudly, are you worried that others won\u2019t know your move? Come again.\u201d Li Ran said in an uninterested tone, retracting his finger.Hoo~Lu Xinran adjusted her state of mind, again she turned into a shadow and attacked Li Ran. But no matter where she appeared, that finger, just like a ghost, always reached the flaw in her movement first.Boom!Li Ran\u2019s finger struck her flying, \u201cCan you move faster?!\u201dBoom!\u201cYou\u2019re too slow!\u201dBoom!\u201cStill too slow! Is this all of your strength?\u201dBoom!Lu Xinran got sent flying again and again, she fell heavily back down on the ring. She struggled to get up, staggering. Her clothes were covered with dust, blood dripping from the corners of her mouth, she looked very much embarrassed.She felt sharp pain radiating from the places Li Ran\u2019s index finger had poked during the battle. It felt as if her muscles would tear and bones would break if this kept going.Li Ran had his hands behind his back. His white clothes were still pristine, not even containing a speck of dust on them.The disciples around the stage covered their eyes.Awful. This is too awful!Is this the result of the offending Sheng Zi?\u201cSheng Zi, please let her go!\u201d Elder Sun arrived at the spot in a hurry at this moment.Lu Xinran was very talented. She was second only to Li Ran in Youluo Temple and was Elder Sun\u2019s most proud disciple.Her current realm was low simply because she hadn\u2019t cultivated for long.\u201cTo preserve the inheritance of my cultivation method, I can\u2019t afford anything happening to her. Please have mercy!\u201d Just as Elder Sun was about to fly onto the stage, a wave of terrifying pressure forced her back down to the ground.She turned her head in amazement and saw Leng Wuyan standing behind her.\u201cSect Master!\u201d Elder Sun hurriedly knelt on one knee.An invisible force held her up, and Leng Wuyan said lightly, \u201cDon\u2019t interfere, look carefully.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Elder Sun tried to say something but swallowed her words before she could finish.\u201cEven the sect master doesn\u2019t care about you\u2026 Xinran, no one can save you this time.\u201d Elder Sun sighed silently.On the ring, Li Ran shook his head and disdainfully said, \u201cCan\u2019t hold on anymore? You have ten breaths left. You can also choose to give up.\u201d\u201cXinran, please give up!\u201d\u201cThe other party is the Sheng Zi. It\u2019s not a shame even if you lose!\u201d\u201cYes, don\u2019t hold on, you have reached your limit!\u201dThe disciples around the stage shouted anxiously.Lu Xinran was cute and had a charming personality. She was obviously very popular among the disciples.No one wanted her to have an accident.\u201cI haven\u2019t reached my limit yet. There is still a chance!\u201d Lu Xinran wiped the blood from the corners of her mouth, her eyes burning with determination, \u201cSheng Zi, I will definitely let you recognize me!\u201d\u201cOh, let\u2019s continue then,\u201d Li Ran said indifferently.\u201cGreat.\u201d Lu Xinran circulated her cultivation technique to the extreme, and her whole body blurred as if she was about to merge with the shadows.\u201cInstant Shadow Kill. Purgatory!\u201dHer body exploded and covered the sky in shadows before sweeping down towards Li Ran.Her real body was hidden in these shadows, and even using the divine consciousness she wasn\u2019t easy to detect.The disciples around the ring had their eyes straightened. They didn\u2019t expect that their cute junior sister would have such strong combat prowess.\u201cAn insignificant move!\u201dLi Ran casually pointed with his finger. A muffled snort immediately rang out in the air.The wind stopped abruptly. Lu Xinran\u2019s body froze midair. Li Ran\u2019s index finger was pointed straight at the center of her forehead.Puff!Lu Xinran coughed up a bit of blood, afterwards, she fell to the ring akin to a kite that just had its string cut.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11: Perfectly Completed!Lu Xinran\u2019s face was deathly pale, and her heart ground to ashes. The pain in her heart was far stronger than that of her body.\u201cThe gap is so insurmountable, I can\u2019t even reach the hem of his robe!\u201d\u201cHis attacks were filled with ruthlessness without a shed of mercy. In his eyes, I must be no different than others.\u201dLu Xinran felt like her heart was being pricked by a thousand needles.\u201cXinran!\u201d Elder Sun exclaimed and flew into the ring.However, Li Ran stood to block her.Elder Sun was anxious, \u201cSheng Zi, she\u2019s already beaten like this. Your anger should already be appeased, right? Please go easy on her!\u201dLi Ran ignored her and stared at Lu Xinran.\u201cNow, are you convinced?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Lu Xinran\u2019s voice was so hoarse as if she lost her soul.\u201cThe path to immortality is difficult; we need to tread the path with caution. If you don\u2019t want to be forgotten like those ordinary cultivators in history, you would have to put in the effort that surpasses them. Although talent determines the upper limit, the level of effort will determine your lower limit.\u201d Li Ran\u2019s voice was distinct.\u201cI accept Sheng Zi\u2019s teachings.\u201d Lu Xinran nodded.\u201cYour meridians were blocked before, which causes the circulation of your Qi to be sluggish. This was why you have been unable to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm,\u201d Li Ran continued, \u201d Do you still remember those acupoints I hit on your body?\u201d\u201cAcupoint?\u201d \u00a0Lu Xinran was stunned for a moment and said, \u201cI remember\u2026\u201d\u201cRun your cultivation method by the acupoints I hit again,\u201d Li Ran said.\u201cOk.\u201d \u00a0Lu Xinran did not question him.She forcefully endured the pain in her entire body as she sat cross-legged and began to circulate her cultivation method.She was shocked just after circulating her Qi once. Her originally obstructed meridians were now opened, and her Qi flow was doubled!The surrounding spiritual Qi was attracted by her and poured into her body.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dElder Sun glanced at Li Ran in surprise.So it was like this! No wonder the sect master didn\u2019t let me interfere!Lu Xinran circulated her cultivation method for forty-eight cycles. The spiritual Qi in her body had already been compressed to the extreme, and her robe fluttered without the presence of wind.\u201cOpen your mouth.\u201dLi Ran quickly shot a pill from his hand.Lu Xinran obediently opened her lips, and the pill just happened to fall into her mouth. Next, the pill transformed into a stream of heat that navigated along her meridians.Boom!The spiritual Qi in her body was instantly ignited, soaring her into the sky!After ten minutes, all of the spiritual Qi stopped leaking and started to gather into her body.Lu Xinran opened her eyes. A faint light flashed through her eyes as she cried out in disbelief, \u201cMy Qi has liquefied. I\u2019ve entered Foundation Establishment!\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201d\u201cJunior Sister Lu has reached Foundation Establishment?\u201dThe disciples around the stage were dumbfounded.Hadn\u2019t she been beaten by Sheng\u00a0Zi? Why did she suddenly break through to the Foundation Establishment realm?Elder Sun walked forward with a smile. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the fact that the Sheng Zi\u00a0opened up your blocked meridians and used a precious Marrow Cleansing Pill, how could you have reached Foundation Establishment so smoothly? What are you standing there for? Quickly thank Sheng Zi for his assistance!\u201dElder Sun was very surprised. Dredging one\u2019s meridians was something that one could only slowly refine on their own. External help would only destabilize one\u2019s foundation.However, Li Ran was actually able to accurately find the blockage without using his spirit Qi. This method was truly terrifying!\u201cHe\u2019s indeed worthy of the title of Sheng Zi\u2026 is this a sign that Sheng Zi wants to draw me over to his side? Should I start to support him in the sect affairs now?\u201d \u00a0Elder Sun glanced at Li Ran and became even more cautious.\u201cThank you, Sheng Zi!\u201d \u00a0Lu Xinran\u2019s smile bloomed like a flower.Her heart felt like a honeypot. It turned out that even though Sheng\u00a0Zi\u00a0seemed to be teaching her a lesson, he was actually trying to help her break through.For this reason, he even used a precious Marrow Cleansing Pill on her.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to thank me. It\u2019s because I can\u2019t bear with your bad talent any longer,\u201d Li Ran said expressionlessly.Lu Xinran: o(\u3003\u25bd\u3003)oHe was clearly concerned about me, yet he still refused to admit it.So proud and adorable!I really wanted to bite him.Li Ran said, \u201cAlso, I didn\u2019t give you the pill for nothing. Remember to repay me twofold!\u201dLu Xinran said, \u201cYes! My entire body belongs to Sheng Zi. You can come and take it anytime!\u201dLi Ran: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe other female disciples also looked at him in a daze. It seemed that the Sheng Zi\u00a0was not the same as the rumors. His cold face but soft interior were just too fascinating!The entire arena was filled with pink bubbles.At the corner, Leng Wuyan was like a piece of ice emitting a bone-piercing coldness.\u201cHehe\u2026\u201d The corner of her mouth twitched, \u201cThese rebellious disciples, should I banish them all from the sect?\u201dLi Ran couldn\u2019t help but shiver.At this moment, the mission had been completed. He immediately slipped away in a flash.\u2014Houshan Manor, back of the mountain.Li Ran heaved a sigh of relief.The girls of Youluo Temple were just like wolves and tigers, their gazes focused on him as if they wanted to eat him up.Fortunately, the mission was completed.Li Ran opened the system interface.\u3010Mission was completed.\u3011\u3010Degree of completion: Perfect\u3011\u3010Obtained High-grade Treasure Chest x2.\u00a0\u3011\u201cOnly two high-grade treasure chests? There were three super treasure chests last time.\u201dFrom this, it could be seen how difficult it was to confess to Leng Wuyan last time\u2026Li Ran opened the treasure chest.\u3010Congratulations to the host for obtaining the \u201cMaiden Spirit Body\u201d!\u3011\u3010Congratulations to the host for obtaining the \u201cMysterious Light Sutra\u201d\u3011Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12: Sect Master, you are jealous!Maiden Spirit Body.This was a top-grade physique that was exclusive to female cultivators.A female cultivator with this physique would not only improve at a divine speed, but would also continuously produce essence energy.Although this essence energy didn\u2019t have any effect on the woman herself, it could greatly assist her partner\u2019s cultivation.It was a physique made solely for dual cultivation!As for the Mysterious Light Sutra, although the cultivation method sounded like it \u00a0originated from a Buddhist sect, it was actually a first-rate dual cultivation method.When arriving at the deep stage of this cultivation method, the user\u2019s body could shine with light, and it was extremely useful to the dual-cultivating partner. It was even able to deepen the other\u2019s comprehension of Dao.These two could be called invincible existences once combining them to cultivate in the dual cultivation world.\u201cDual cultivation set? Oh god\u2026\u201dLi Ran was speechless.Both of these rewards were good. The question was who was it for?\u2014If Youluo Temple was a dual cultivation sect, Li Ran would definitely be the most diligent one.However, the opposite happened. The quintessence behind Youluo Temple\u2019s cultivation method emphasized on clear-mindedness and one\u2019s firm resolution to pursue the Dao. Dual cultivation here was the unorthodox path.Moreover, he had just confessed to Leng Wuyan yesterday. If she discovers him secretly dual cultivating with other girls, he could imagine what\u2019s waiting for him.\u201cHowever, what if I cultivate with the sect master?\u201dThinking back to Leng Wuyan\u2019s exquisite face and her mature figure hiding beneath her white robe, Li Ran couldn\u2019t help but feel his mouth getting dry.Although this matter was not very realistic, if a person had no dreams, what was the difference between them and a salted fish?\u201cThe higher the cultivation, the more effective the physique is. As an Emperor-level expert, blades wouldn\u2019t be able to injure the sect master the slightest bit\u2026 I wonder if\u00a0that\u00a0part is a tempered glass,\u201d Li Ran muttered in a low voice.\u201cWhat\u2019s tempered?\u201d \u00a0Suddenly, a familiar voice rang behind him.Li Ran\u2019s expression instantly stiffened. He slowly turned around and saw the gorgeous woman standing behind him, and his throat tightened.\u201cMaster.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Leng Wuyan answered, then asked curiously,\u201d You haven\u2019 t answered my question yet. What part is a tempered glass?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d \u00a0Cold sweat covered Li Ran\u2019s back.\u201cThis\u2026 It\u2019s a demon. Because its body is as hard as steel, it\u2019s called a tempered demon, another nickname is tempered glass.\u201d Li Ran made up his mind.\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve heard of this. It should be an unremarkable little demon,\u201d Leng Wuyan thought for a moment.\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s very unremarkable. Master doesn\u2019t need to care.\u201d Li Ran nodded like a pestle.\u201cYes.\u201d \u00a0Leng Wuyan didn\u2019t ask any further.She was still dressed in plain white. Under her white robe, she wore a thin dress, revealing a swan-like neck and a fair and delicate collarbone.Apart from that, the dress she wore today was much shorter than usual. Her slender and round legs were jade-like.She looked unusually feminine today.\u201cMaster, you look beautiful today.\u201d Li Ran changed the topic.\u201cIt\u2019s just a casual dress. What\u2019s there to look at?\u201d Leng Wuyan spoke casually, but her eyes flashed with joy.She carefully dressed up for an hour. Although she didn\u2019t say anything, she hoped that Li Ran would notice.\u201cBy the way, you seem to have a very good relationship with that female disciple? She\u2019s called Lu Xinran, right?\u201d Leng Wuyan casually asked.Li Ran shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s just a normal relationship. I recently learned of her name.\u201d\u201cSince that\u2019s the case, why would you spend so much effort to help her break through?\u201d Leng Wuyan\u2019s eyes were burning.Li Ran\u2019s heart skipped a beat. The sect master seemed to be very concerned about this matter.\u201cWe are fellow disciples from the same sect. She\u2019s only one step away from the Foundation Establishment Realm, so I casually helped her,\u201d Li Ran replied.However, Leng Wuyan was clearly not satisfied with this answer.\u201cI wonder when you have become so helpful since you always disdained other disciples before?\u201dLi Ran\u2019s previous personality was very cold. Not to mention instructing his fellow disciples in cultivation, not mocking them was already him being generous.Today was indeed strange.\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Li Ran scratched his head.\u201d If it had been before, I wouldn\u2019 t care for them at all, but it\u2019s a bit different now.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Leng Wuyan asked curiously, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d\u201cNow that I have a new goal, I feel that the air has become fresher and my days are filled with life.\u201d Li Ran continued with a smile,\u201d Because of Master, my cold heart has been thawed.\u201dLeng Wuyan\u2019s heart began to beat wildly.What is going on with him? Such honeyed words, how can he speak out as a matter of fact?!\u201cBe careful, if someone were to hear these words\u2026\u201d Leng Wuyan said shyly.With her cultivation, how could she be eavesdropped on? However, she completely forgot about this at this moment.\u201cYes,yes, master, I was too reckless.\u201d\u201cBut, why do you care so much about Lu Xinran, Master?\u201dBefore she could answer, Li Ran said in a daze,\u201d You\u2019re not jealous, are you?\u201dLeng Wuyan: \u2211(\u2299\u25bd\u2299aHer face instantly turned red like a burning cloud on the horizon.\u201cW-who\u2019s jealous? Don\u2019 t talk nonsense. With my status, how could I be jealous of my disciple!\u201d Leng Wuyan hurriedly explained.\u201cThen why is your face so red?\u201d Li Ran tilted his head and asked.Leng Wuyan flusteredly said, \u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s too hot!\u201dHu~The cold breeze carried by the snowstorm blew past them.Li Ran nodded seriously. \u201cMaster is right. It is indeed very hot.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Leng Wuyan\u2019s face turned even redder, and she wished she could bury herself in a hole at this moment.She glared at Li Ran in embarrassment and with some annoyance, \u201cCome, let me test your combat level!\u201d\u201cAh?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13: Master, I won!\u201cMaster, stop joking. How could I be your opponent\u2026\u201d Li Ran smiled awkwardly.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t bully you either. I won\u2019t use my cultivation and will only use one finger. If you can touch my body, you win.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMy god! Those are my lines. \u00a0Li Ran wanted to cry but couldn\u2019t shed a tear.\u201cMaster, calm down. I really have nothing to do with Lu Xinran,\u201d he explained.Leng Wuyan held her hand behind her back then said, \u201cI\u2019m testing your combat ability. What does it have to do with Lu Xinran?\u201dTrying to test my strength? \u00a0This is clearly an act of retaliation!As expected, she was a female demon. Even though she was usually cute, once she got jealous, she would kill him in the name of love!Li Ran said, \u201cI admit defeat.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t allow you to admit defeat!\u201d \u00a0Leng Wuyan put her hands on her waist and said, \u201cIf you admit defeat, I \u2026, I will ignore you!\u201dShe came up with such a \u201cpunishment\u201d after thinking for quite a long time just now.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d \u00a0Li Ran was in a dilemma.In the end, he decided to 'satisfy\u201d her, or else, the outcome would end up even uglier for him.\u201cMaster, take it easy on me, or you\u2019ll be widowed,\u201d Li Ran warned worriedly.Leng Wuyan laughed and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I know. It\u2019s just a test. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u201cWith Master\u2019s words, I feel much more at ease.\u201d\u201cCan we start now?\u201d\u201cWait a minute!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong again?\u201dLi Ran licked his lips and said, \u201cWhat if, I mean what if, I won by luck. Are there any rewards?\u201d\u201cReward\u2026\u201d Leng Wuyan thought for a moment. \u201cIf you win, I promise you to get any one thing of your choosing, as long as it\u2019s nothing too excessive.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d \u00a0Li Ran nodded in agreement.Buzz~With a slight sound, dark shadows spread out from Leng Wuyan\u2019s body. It looked like a layer of translucent film enveloped the entire Houshan Manor.In an instant, everything turned completely silent. Li Ran was still standing there, but he lost all perception of the outside world.The entire mountain seemed to have become an isolated island.\u201cIs this the domain of Emperor-level experts?\u201d Li Ran felt thrilled in his heart.\u201cLet\u2019s start. No one will disturb us,\u201d Leng Wuyan said.\u201cAlright.\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything more. His body instantly transformed into a shadow and appeared behind her. It was as if he had sprung from the ground..His speed was a hundred times faster than Lu Xinran!However, at the moment he executed his attack, similar to what happened in the battle before, a slender jade-like finger extended and poked his forehead.\u201cToo slow,\u201d Leng Wuyan said.Before she could finish speaking, another Li Ran suddenly appeared behind her. His palm carried a gale as it slammed towards her.\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad idea to use the shadows as a disguise. Unfortunately, you\u2019re still too slow.\u201d Leng Wuyan bent her finger and flicked him away.Li Ran rolled on the ground for a while before rubbing his sore forehead..\u201cAgain!\u201d His figure turned blurry once more, turning into a tide of shadows, similar to a tsunami breaking shore..However, no matter what he did, there would always be a jade-like finger in front of him. It felt impossible to ever break past her line of defense.Bang!Bang!Bang!Li Ran was sent flying countless times.He half squatted on the ground, a trace of blood slowly oozing from the corner of his mouth. In fact, Leng Wuyan didn\u2019t exert any force. His injuries were just the result of shock.Emperor-level experts\u2019 bodies were simply too terrifying!Leng Wuyan couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s stop here\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not over yet!\u201d Li Ran\u2019s determination had already reached its peak. With a wave of his hand, a silver spear appeared.After taking a step forward, the surrounding air appeared to have frozen. The spears\u2019 ornamental silver feathers trembled wildly and it was constantly emitting a spar spear intent.\u201cEh?\u201d Leng Wuyan raised her brows.A white light surfaced in Li Ran\u2019s eyes growing brighter and brighter. In the end, she wasn\u2019t even able to directly look at him\u2026Holding the spear with his right hand, the world suddenly dimmed. It felt as if all the surrounding light had gathered on the spears\u2019 tip.\u201cWhite rainbow\u2026pierces through the Sun*!\u201d The spear shot out and silver light surged.(TL/N: Sun Halo. the name of this skill.)Terrifying spear intent filled the area, illuminating the entire mountain as if it was the morning sun shining its light from above..\u201cInteresting.\u201d Leng Wuyan smiled, her eyes filled with admiration.Clang!Her index finger lightly touched the tip of the spear, and the white light instantly vanished.No matter how Li Ran exerted his strength, the silver spear trembled and roared. He was unable to take another step forward.\u201cYour spear technique is not bad. Who did you learn it from?\u201d\u201cThis is the Li family\u2019s spear technique!\u201d As Li Ran spoke, he suddenly released his right hand and pressed it against Leng Wuyan\u2019s chest.Just as Leng Wuyan was about to push him away, his left hand formed a seal. His eyes reflected a feeling of depth, and a wave of pressure suddenly assaulted her.Youluo Temple\u2019s secret technique,\u00a0Spirit Suppression Secret Seal!The surrounding air thickened into a swamp-like consistency, each and every movement felt as if it encountered an invisible force resisting it.Li Ran used this technique to delay her reaction!\u201cGood technique!\u201d Leng Wuyan\u2019s eyes were filled with admiration.Even she had to use a bit of strength to break free of the secret seal.Pfft!Li Ran suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood, sending him flying back. With a puff sound, he fell to the ground. He was completely still.\u201cRan\u2019er!\u201dLeng Wuyan was shocked.\u00a0Could it be that I didn\u2019t control my strength well?She hurriedly flew over and hugged Li Ran in her arms, her spiritual Qi instantly swimming around him.\u201cStrange. His meridians are stable. He is completely fine\u2026\u201dLeng Wuyan suddenly froze.She slowly lowered her head and saw a hand grabbing her bosom.Li Ran spat out blood as he laughed sneakily. \u201cMaster, I won.\u201dLeng Wuyan: (\u2299_\u2299)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14: It\u2019s over. Master is angry!For a while, Li Ran laughed like a fool. Suddenly, he felt the atmosphere changing.He slightly tightened his grasp, feeling something soft and squishy.After taking a glance\u2026\u201cF*ck!\u201d \u00a0He almost lost his soul and hastily removed his hand.Leng Wuyan\u2019s eyes were filled with killing intent.\u201cMaster, let me explain first!\u201d Li Ran said anxiously.\u201cExplain. I\u2019m listening.\u201d She said quietly.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d \u00a0Under her gaze, Li Ran broke out into a cold sweat gulping down his saliva.How could it be explained?Can I say that the greater the mass, the greater the gravity. her\u2019s are too big to keep my hands under control?Absolutely not, she would cut me into pieces!Although Li Ran did not do it on purpose, It already happened.\u201cMaster, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Li Ran stopped thinking of excuses and obediently admitted his mistake.It turned quiet for a while.Leng Wuyan stood up and said coldly, \u201cForget it. Although you used a trick, you didn\u2019t break the rules. You won.\u201d\u201cThink about the conditions carefully. I will follow what you say.\u201dAfter she finished speaking, she released her hand. Her entire body soared into the sky, and the dark field that enveloped the mountain disappeared with her.Li Ran heaved a sigh of relief and collapsed on the ground. The difference between the Golden Core Realm and the Emperor-level was like the difference between the sky and the earth. There were just no grounds for comparison at all.Of course, Li Ran was not a simple Golden Core cultivator. Apart from the\u00a0Youluo Temple\u2018s\u00a0technique, he also had four spear moves, his\u00a0Heaven Seizing Technique, and \u201cDragon Elephant Zetian.\u201dHowever, in order not to arouse the sect master\u2019s suspicion, these trump cards could not be used, so he only used one spear move.In order to win this spar, he reversed his cultivation technique at the crucial moment, forcing out a mouthful of blood to trick her\u2026However, he didn\u2019t expect that he would make a mistake in the end and that he unexpectedly climbed her master\u2019s mountain peak carelessly.\u201cEven though I won, I took advantage of her concern for me. It was indeed a little too much.\u201d Li Ran sighed.Just now, he was a bit over the top. He didn\u2019t even think about anything else.\u201cMaster must be really angry this time\u2026\u201dLi Ran had always been wary of Leng Wuyan, but it was only because of the difference in strength. In reality, Leng Wuyan was very kind to him, so kind that he had no words left to describe it.He couldn\u2019t help feeling guilty.\u201cNext time we meet, I must properly explain myself.\u201d Li Ran stood up and staggered towards his residence.Just ten meters away hidden behind a wall, Leng Wuyan stood, leaning against it, \u00a0\u00a0her face flushed. Her heart was beating like a deer\u2019s. Her entire body felt numb as if she had been electrocuted.\u201cHe, he, he, he actually touched my chest! He\u2019s really too reckless!\u201d\u201cEven though he used such a dirty trick, he did indeed win. What kind of conditions would he propose?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s too much, should I agree or refuse?\u201d\u201cIf I agree, wouldn\u2019t we advance too quickly\u2026 We have only been together since yesterday!\u201dLeng Wuyan thought aimlessly. The redness reached her ears without her knowing.The surrounding snow, as if it could sense the heat inside her heart, melted quickly\u2026\u2014Li Ran returned to his residence. Aqin was sitting at the door in a daze. When she saw him return, she hurriedly stood up to welcome him.\u201cSheng Zi, you\u2019re back\u2026 Ah!\u201d She noticed Li Ran\u2019s miserable appearance and immediately cried out in alarm.\u201cWhat happened to you? Why are you like this?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. It was just a beating.\u201d Li Ran waved his hand.\u201cBeating?!\u201d Aqin could not say anything,\u201d You are Sheng Zi, the successor of the future sect master. Who in the entire Youluo Temple dares to touch you?\u201d\u201cThe current sect master.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Oh, That\u2019s fine then.\u201d Aqin felt a little strange.Li Ran was the proudest disciple of Youlou Temple. He had the best resources and treatment in the entire sect, so why would the sect master suddenly teach him a lesson?\u201cDon\u2019t look like that. Have you never seen a handsome man that has been beaten up before?\u201d Li Ran felt aggrieved.\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d\u201cGo heat up some water. I want to take a bath.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAqin quickly prepared the bath.In the room, the spiritual incense wooden tub was emitting hot air, and spirit flowers and magic herbs were added to the hot water.After washing, it could make one\u2019s entire body comfortable and fragrant.Aqin took off his clothes. She couldn\u2019t help but be a little shy when she saw his muscular body. However, her attention was immediately drawn to the bruises covering his frame.\u201cSheng Zi, why did the master treat you like this?\u201d She couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cIt\u2019s just sparring, there will inevitably be injuries. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d He did not care.\u201cOh.\u201d Aqin lowered her head and didn\u2019t say anything more.\u2014The bath water\u2019s temperature was warm and comfortable. Under the effect of the fragrant spirit wood, the temperature was regulated.LI Ran closed his eyes in feeling content, meanwhile, Aqin gently massaged his shoulders and neck.It feels so good!Before, when he had just transmigrated to this world he was still repulsive of the thought of her bathing him.Because Aqin was a girl with beauty comparable to flowers and jade, every time she helped him bathe, Li Ran, due to his strong blood energy, barely was able to contain his instinctive desires.But now, he started to enjoy this kind of service. And he could control his searing heart gradually.\u201cTo the left, use some more strength. I can stand whatever your little hands can achieve.\u201dRight now, he had completely taken Aqin as his private masseuse.\u201cYes, Sheng Zi.\u201d Aqin began putting more force behind her massage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15: Strange AqinLi Ran sank his mind into his sea of consciousness. The Heaven Seizing Cultivation Method was still circulating, and the profound symbols on the amethyst figure illuminated brighter.Li Ran clearly felt that his cultivation had slightly increased, and his mind had become clearer. Even his soul had improved by a bit.All this process happened in the span of a day!Moreover, cultivation through the Heaven Seizing Cultivation Method was even more effective than cultivating manually.\u201cF*ck, this effect is too great!\u201d Li Ran was speechless.Even when he was lying down, he still became stronger?A comfortable power-up!Of course, breaking through one\u2019s realm wasn\u2019t something that could be achieved by just cultivating. One\u2019s opportunity, comprehension, and talent were indispensable.When he reached the latest stage of the Golden Core realm, he still needed to find an opportunity to break through.\u2014Aqin massaged Li Ran. Seeing him close his eyes to rest, her eyes were a little confused.For some reason, she felt that Li Ran had changed a little. Although he was still that same Sheng Zi, his smile became kinder and his eyes became gentler. Occasionally, he would even reveal a trace of guilt.He even pinched her face last time\u2026This was something that he would never have done before. Most importantly, Li Ran hadn\u2019t beaten her for the last half month.\u201cPerhaps Sheng Zi is in a good mood lately?\u201d \u00a0Aqin could not think of any other answers.No matter what, such a change made her happy.Looking at the bruises on Li Ran\u2019s body, Aqin felt a bit distressed and indignant.\u201cThe sect master really is cold. Does she have to spar with him in order to guide his cultivation? Furthermore, she is so heavy-handed!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Li Ran was jolted awake by her words and stopped circulating his Heaving Seizing Cultivation method.The moment he opened his eyes, his pupils shone with golden light. Aqin felt as if she had been hit by a heavy hammer, and she felt an intense pressure emanating from him. It was as if the person in front of her wasn\u2019t Sheng Zi, but a heavenly deity!Aqin\u2019s knees couldn\u2019t help going limp and she collapsed to the ground instinctively.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I bothered you, lord Sheng Zi!\u201d She laid prostrate on the ground, her body trembling.She thought what she said about the sect master had enraged Li Ran.Li Ran was stunned and shook his head. \u201cGet up. I\u2019m not angry.\u201dAqin stood up but didn\u2019t dare to raise her head.Li Ran helplessly said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t get up, I\u2019ll really be angry.\u201dHearing this, Aqin stood up trembling. Her head was still lowered, and she did not dare to look at him.Li Ran shook his head and sighed.What sin had the previous body owner done!He made a decision in the end.He raised his body from the tub, and the water droplets on his body instantly evaporated.After changing his clothes, he walked towards the bedroom.\u201cCome with me.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Aqin lowered her head and carefully followed him.\u2014In the bedroom, Li Ran sat on a chair while Aqin stood opposite him.\u201cAqin, how long have you been with me?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been ten years since I first served Sheng Zi,\u201d Aqin replied in a low voice.\u201cSince I entered the Youlou Temple at the age of eight, you have been following me for ten years.\u201d Li Ran sighed. \u201cSince your Shen family was exterminated by the Li family, you don\u2019t even have a surname. I have been extremely strict with you\u2026 Shen Qin, do you hate me?\u201d\u201cAqin doesn\u2019t dare!\u201d Her body trembled and she was about to kneel down, but she was held up by an invisible force. Her knees couldn\u2019t bend down at all.\u201cSheng Zi?\u201d Aqin raised her head in fear.\u201cOver the past ten years, you\u2019ve taken good care of me. You\u2019ve worked hard.\u201d \u00a0Li Ran took a stack of silver tickets and handed them to Aqin.\u201cSheng Zi, what do you mean?\u201d Aqin was puzzled.\u201cYou are free. Take this money. I\u2019ll help you arrange your identity. I\u2019ll also inform the Li family. You don\u2019t need to worry about your family being implicated.\u201d\u201cLeave the mountain and live your own life,\u201d Li Ran said seriously.He knew that his actions were too different from before. Originally, he wanted to change things slowly, but Aqin\u2019s reaction made him feel more and more guilty.Moreover, if there was a person who hated him that was constantly around him, it would make him also feel uncomfortable. Therefore, Li Ran decided to quickly fix the mess.However, Aqin didn\u2019t feel the slightest bit of joy. Instead, her face turned pale and she said with a trembling voice, \u201cSheng Zi, don\u2019t you want Aqin?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Li Ran was stunned.\u201cSheng Zi, Aqin is wrong. Please don\u2019t drive Aqin away!\u201d Aqin knelt in front of him and begged bitterly.\u201cIf you\u2019re not happy, you can beat Aqin to vent your anger, but please don\u2019t drive me away! Aqin really can\u2019t leave you!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Li Ran was dumbfounded.What is the situation? She had suffered a lot before. Now that she could leave, shouldn\u2019t she be very happy?Could it be that I didn\u2019t give her enough money?Li Ran wanted to give her some more, but a famous idiom stated that an innocent person would become guilty for getting too much wealth.\u201cBut judging from her appearance, it doesn\u2019t seem like the money is not enough.\u201dAqin didn\u2019t seem to hate him but was relying on him to the extreme.\u201cAh, this\u2026\u201d\u201cSheng Zi, please don\u2019t leave me behind! I\u2019ll do whatever you want!\u201d Aqin\u2019s face was pale and her expression was begging.\u201c\u2026\u201d Li Ran scratched his head.Why do I feel a little ashamed\u2026\u201cGet up. I won\u2019t chase you away.\u201d\u201cReally? Really?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThank you, Sheng Zi!\u201d After she was certain, Aqin smiled, her tears still stone at the corner of her eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16: Master\u2019s mission!Li Ran pinched his chin. \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, do you have any other wishes?\u201d\u201cAs long as I can stay with Sheng Zi\u2026\u201d\u201cApart from this.\u201d\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Aqin fell into deep thought.For the past ten years, she had been like a shadow and dedicated her life to Li Ran. She had never thought of what she needed or wanted.\u201cIf I can, Aqin wants to cultivate,\u201d after a long while, she gave her answer.\u201cOh?\u201d Li Ran smiled.\u201d Why do you want that? Do you want to become stronger, or is it the longevity you desire?\u201dMost people embarked on the road of immortal cultivation due to these two purposes, but Aqin shook her head. \u201cAqin only wanted to be a useful person, so that I could serve Sheng Zi forever.\u201dLi Ran was silent. Unexpectedly, this girl\u2019s only wish was to stay by his side.\u201cBut that\u2019s just a fantasy.\u201d Aqin laughed self-deprecatingly. \u201cI tested my talent when I was a child, and my aptitude is extremely poor. There\u2019s no way for me to cultivate.\u201dLi Ran hesitated. \u201cWhat if I can give you talent?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d She was stunned.Li Ran spread his hand, and two clusters of light appeared on it. One was pink, and the other was silver. They both silently circled in the air.The System Reward could be given to anyone and could be retrieved at any time, so Li Ran did not need to worry about giving them to her.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Aqin asked with curiosity.Li Ran explained it briefly to her.\u201cDual, dual cultivation?!\u201d Aqin\u2019s face turned so that it appeared as if smoke would start bursting out of her ears the next moment. Her eyes were sparkling with light.Although she was a mortal, she still knew the meaning of these two words.\u00a0It\u2019s too\u2026\u201cUh\u2026 Although it is this type of constitution, it wasn\u2019t as if one had to do dual cultivation with others. In terms of talent and cultivation speed, it\u2019s one of the best physiques in the world.\u201d Li Ran explained awkwardly.He just wanted to compensate Aqin, and he had no other intentions. And, changing her constitution was the only way she could cultivate.\u201cI\u2019m willing!\u201d Aqin replied.\u201cHowever, I have to remind you that even if I can give you this constitution, I can take it back at any time. If it\u2019s taken back, you will die. Are you still willing?\u201d\u201cOf course, if you want to leave now, my offer is still valid. I will arrange everything properly.\u201dAqin didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI choose to cultivate!\u201d\u201cEven if you may die?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Aqin smiled and nodded. It was as if this was something she considered worthy to be happy about.Li Ran couldn\u2019t help but be stunned when he saw her smile. Then, he sighed and rubbed her head.\u201cSilly girl.\u201d\u201cSheng Zi\u2026\u201d Aqin narrowed her eyes, enjoying this short moment of skinship\u2026Li Ran pushed the pink ball of light into Aqin\u2019s body. Since she didn\u2019 t resist at all, her body was rapidly transformed. The hidden injuries and scars from before began to melt, leaving her skin as smooth as brocade.The corners of her eyes sparkled in a charm akin to the surface of a pure body of water.In less than ten minutes, her constitution changed to the rare \u2018Maiden Spirit Body\u2019.Then, Li Ran passed the Mysterious Light Sutra to her. From then on, Aqin had officially embarked on the path of cultivation.\u201cAlright, this constitution and cultivation method are very compatible. Just follow this cultivation method and your progress will definitely be very fast,\u201d Li Ran said.\u201cAlright.\u201d Aqin bit her lip and reached to unbutton her clothes.Li Ran was startled.\u201d What are you doing?!\u201d\u201cCultivation.\u201d Aqin said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you want me to cultivate according to my cultivation technique? This is how the Mysterious Light Sutra is supposed to be done~\u201dAs she spoke, her movements continued.\u201cStop!\u201d Li Ran hurriedly stopped her.This girl actually tried to take the initiative and push me down(Note: usually man will be active in sex, now the situation is reversed)? What a fuck! When did I ever deserve such grievance?Hearing this, Aqin thought that Li Ran disliked her and her expression became somewhat dispirited.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It is Aqin\u2019s fault. Even if I wanted to, how could I be worthy \u00a0in Sheng Zi\u2019s eyes?\u201dDong!Li Ran heavily flicked his finger at her head and said in an unhappy voice: \u201cAlthough it\u2019s a dual cultivation technique, it also depends on the difference between the realms both partners have advanced to. You aren\u2019t even at the Qi Refining realm, so if you are to cultivate with me now, your bone marrow will probably be sucked dry! Do you want to die?\u201d (note: In cultivation novels, bone is deemed a place to hide an individual\u2019s essential energy, especially inside the spine part!)\u201cIs that so?\u201d Aqin rubbed her head and revealed a smile. \u201cSo it turns out that Sheng Zi did not dislike me but rather cared about me!\u201dLi Ran glared at her. \u201cHurry up and get dressed.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Aqin nodded happily.Li Ran couldn\u2019t help but feel his mouth dry as he looked at the sudden spring light being emitted by Aqin\u2019s bare skin.Aqin was a beautiful woman to begin with. After the transformation of her spiritual body, her every move was filled with charm. Even Li Ran couldn\u2019t endure it.This was just the beginning, and when her cultivation reached a profound level. A single glance from her would be enough to take away one\u2019s soul!\u201cRemember, don\u2019t tell anyone about this matter. You just need to cultivate at ease, \u201cLi Ran warned.Aqin clenched her small fist and said firmly, \u201cGot it! Aqin will definitely work hard to cultivate and strive to cultivate with Sheng Zi as soon as possible!\u201dLi Ran\u2019s body trembled. If these words reached Leng Wuyan\u2019s ears, he should consider reincarnating again given her jealousy.\u201cAlright, go. Start cultivating.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Aqin returned to her room and sat cross-legged. She began to cultivate the\u00a0Mysterious Light Sutra.At this moment, the power of the\u00a0Maiden Spirit Body\u00a0was revealed.As the cultivation method circulated, Aqin\u2019s body revealed a mysterious phenomenon, and it looked rather profound.However, she didn\u2019t care about it at all. She just ran her cultivation method and got completely absorbed in the process. To her, this was just a mission from her master. It was also a sign of trust from him to her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17: Leng Wuyan\u2019s aura!\u201cSheng Zi, wake up. It\u2019s time for breakfast,\u201d a voice said from the darkness.It was Aqin doing her usual morning service for Li Ran.Li Ran rubbed his sleepy eyes. Ever since he had the Heaven Seizing Cultivation Method, he didn\u2019 t need to meditate, so he simply slept at night.\u201cGood morning, Sheng Zi.\u201d\u201cMorning.\u201d Li Ran got up.As Aqin helped him put his clothes on, she said, \u201cI made your favorite lotus soup today, as well as green jade lotus soup and fluffy snow pellets.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard.\u201d Li Ran rubbed her head.\u201cNot really.\u201d Aqin smiled, her eyes narrowing like a little kitten\u2019s.Ever since yesterday her bearing changed. With a little less feeling of servility, her smile became even brighter and her body exuded a youthful aura. Moreover, her gaze towards Li Ran became even more attached.\u201cEh? \u201cYou\u2019 ve already entered the\u00a0Qi Refining Realm?\u201d Li Ran sensed that she had a completely different temperament and couldn\u2019t help but be stunned.\u201cYes,\u201d Aqin replied. \u201cAccording to the\u00a0Mysterious Light Sutra, Aqin should be at the early stage of\u00a0Qi Refining Realm.\u201dLi Ran was astonished. The\u00a0Maiden Spirit Body\u00a0was indeed worthy of being a divine constitution. Apart from its top-level \u2018dual cultivation ability\u2019, it was also extremely fast progressing.Coupled with the extremely profound\u00a0Mysterious Light Sutra, it actually had the astonishing effect of reaching\u00a0Qi Refining Realm\u00a0in just one day.Li Ran thought about something and frowned. \u201cDid you cultivate all night?\u201dAqin nodded in embarrassment. \u201cYes\u2026\u201dThen, she added, \u201cBut Aqin doesn\u2019t feel tired at all. Instead, my entire body is filled with energy!\u201dLi Ran shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s true that absorbing Qi will replenish one\u2019s physical strength, but one\u2019s mental exhaustion can\u2019t be prevented. If you can\u2019t focus your attention during cultivation,you may fall into a state of\u00a0Qi Derivation\u00a0going crazy as a result.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Aqin bit her finger.Li Ran helplessly said, \u201cLie down and rest. Sleep right here. You\u2019re not allowed to get up until you\u2019ve slept for four hours.\u201d\u201cBut Aqin wants to cultivate\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is an order!\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Aqin obediently walked towards the bed and laid down.As she smelled Li Ran\u2019s scent on the bed, her heart began to beat faster. Her face taking on a feverish shade of red.Her eyes were wide open without a trace of sleepiness.\u201cSheng Zi, Aqin cannot sleep\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Li Ran pointed his hand at her forehead and circulated his Qi within her body. Only then did Aqin fell asleep while being dazed.\u201cI didn\u2019 t expect her to be so diligent. Coupled with the support of her constitution and cultivation technique, her future is truly limitless.\u201d Li Ran nodded.\u201cBy the way, I wonder if the sect master has calmed down\u2026\u201d Thinking of what had happened yesterday, he couldn\u2019 t help but shiver.\u201cEh\u2026 I should better take the initiative to apologize to her and plead for leniency.\u201d\u2014On Demon Peak\u2026Inside the main hall, Leng Wuyan sat on her black and gold phoenix chair. Her gaze fell upon the old woman beside her.It was an eldery woman with brilliant hair. Her body was hidden under her pure black robe, but her eyes shone brightly, not showing any signs of aging.\u201cElder Sun, why did you come here today? Do you need anything from me?\u201d Leng Wuyan asked.Sun Wei, was the First Elder of Youluo Temple and also served under three generations of masters. Although her cultivation base was far inferior to Leng Wuyan\u2019s, her position in the sect still invoked extrem respect.Even if Leng Wuyan was the sect leader, she had to give her some face. To Leng Wuyan, this was an elder worthy of respect.Sun Wei put down her teacup and said, \u201cDid the sect master read the news from the central mainland yesterday?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Leng Wuyan was a little embarrassed.Because of Li Ran, causing her heart to be so chaotic, how could she be in the mood to read any news?\u201cRecently, I\u2019ve gained some enlightenment in cultivation. I haven\u2019t had the time nor the energy to check the reports yet.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Sun Wei didn\u2019t doubt it. She nodded and said, \u201cCultivation is of course the first priority, but you are the head of our sect. You can\u2019t neglect sect matters.\u201d\u201cYes, Elder Sun is right.\u201d Leng Wuyan accepted with guilt.Sun Wei continued, \u201cThe Righteous Sects\u2019 movements have been frequent lately, and the Devil Sects are unwilling to take it lying down. The\u00a0Albizian Sect\u00a0and the\u00a0Slaughtering Hell Sect\u00a0take the lead to set up a\u00a0Devil Sect Offensive and Defensive Alliance. They want to invite our Youluo Temple to join them.\u201d\u201cOffensive and Defensive Alliance?\u201d Leng Wuyan sneered, \u201cSince when did those Devil sects learn such tricks?\u201d\u201cI think the Righteous Sects are putting too much pressure on them,\u201d Elder Sun analyzed.\u201cBoth of these devil sects have been acting rampant recently. No wonder it touched the imperial courts\u2019 and righteous sects\u2019 bottom line. Now that they are being targeted they plan to pull others in their muddy waters? Do they really think I\u2019m some kind of fool?\u201d Leng Wuyan sneered coldly.\u201cWhat does the sect master think of this?\u201d Elder Sun asked.\u201cI don\u2019 t care about those sludges!\u201dLeng Wuyan\u2019s voice was cold. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in what both sides are trying to do, but better they don\u2019t provoke us, or else I\u2019ll kill all of them!\u201dWhen saying these words, her eyes were deep, and her black hair fluttered about. Her aura was like an abyss, and she looked as terrifying as a corpse!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18: What lovers should do!\u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s the Righteous sect or the Devil sect, I\u2019ll kill them all, once\u2026!\u201d Leng Wuyan\u2019s voice echoed throughout the hall.A terrifying pressure surged out, suppressing Elder Sun\u2019s breathing. She looked at the figure that looked like both a god and a devil and was incomparably shocked.This was the pressure of an Emperor-level expert!Just a hint of it could make the average person experience hell!Soon, Elder Sun\u2019s feelings changed from shock to excitement. After all, the stronger Leng Wuyan became, the stronger the sect\u2019s position became. As long as Leng Wuyan was an Emperor-level expert, the Youluo Temple would be the top sect in all the vast Lands!\u201cHail to the Sect Master! Under your leadership our\u00a0Youluo Temple\u00a0will absolutely trample those other sects, no matter if they are following the righteous or devil path, we will achieve supremacy!\u201d Elder Sun\u2019s expression was feverish.Leng Wuyan calmed herself and shook her head. \u201cYour words are too flattering.\u201dIn fact, she wasn\u2019t interested in the so-called supremacy, nor was she willing to fight with other sects.As long as no one else came to provoke her, she would rather stay on Demon Peak.Every day, apart from cultivation, she would only be concerned with love and romance\u2026Thinking here, Li Ran\u2019s image appeared in her mind, and the corners of her mouth couldn\u2019t help but curl upwards.Scramble for supremacy in the Vast Lands?How could it be more fun than to have a relationship!\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be modest, master,\u201d Elder Sun said, \u201cLooking back at our past generations of sect masters, your cultivation is the strongest. Besides, you are the one who cares most about the disciples I have ever seen. For this reason, I will always admire you deeply.\u201dCreatures below the emperor level were all ants, as transient as a fleeting cloud.How could an Emperor-level expert be like Leng Wuyan and personally guide sect disciples in cultivation?\u201cI\u2019m just doing my duty.\u201d Leng Wuyan was somewhat embarrassed to be praised like that.Elder Sun continued, \u201cI\u2019m very clear how much concern you show those disciples. Especially your prohibition on love and romance is your most correct decision\u201dLeng Wuyan:(\u2299_\u2299)\u201cTo keep the disciples away from the seven emotions and six sensory pleasures, and let them concentrate on cultivation, this is the best way to let Youluo Temple grow stronger! Besides, you\u2019ve led by example yourself! You\u2019ve never touched a worldly heart in so many years! You really are the greatest sect master of the last generations!\u201d Elder Sun gave a thumbs up, praising her without regard.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d The corner of her mouth twitched. \u201cHaha, this is what I should do\u2026\u201dIf this old woman knew that I had already fallen in a relationship, she would probably spew three liters of blood.\u201cI truly admire you\u2026\u201d Elder Sun still had to say more, but Leng Wuyan hastily interrupted, \u201cI\u2019ve suddenly gained some enlightenment, so I need to enter seclusion and cultivate. If there\u2019s nothing else, you should go back first.\u201dShe was afraid that if this old woman chatted for a bit longer, she would find a hole to dive into.\u201cHave you gained enlightenment again?\u201d Elder Sun stood up and said excitedly, \u201cCongratulations, Sect Master! \u00a0Then I\u2019ll go back and leave you alone, bye!\u201cBye.\u201d Leng Wuyan finally let out a sigh of relief.At this moment, a female disciple walked into the hall and bowed. \u201cReporting to Sect Master. Sheng Zi begs to see you.\u201d\u201cRan\u2019er is here?\u201d Leng Wuyan was pleasantly surprised.Just as she was about to speak, Elder Sun said, \u201cThe Sect Master has just gained some enlightenment. She needs to go into closed-door cultivation immediately. Make Sheng Zi come back another day.\u201dLeng Wuyan was dumbfounded. \u201c???\u201dThe female disciple asked, \u201cSect Master, should I send Sheng Zi back first?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Leng Wuyan suddenly stood up.Elder Sun was stunned. \u201cSect Master, didn\u2019t you say you wanted to enter seclusion?\u201d\u201cAh, this\u2026\u201d Leng Wuyan said, \u201cEnlightenment is elusive. I realized that it was just an illusion and not true enlightenment just now.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Elder Sun felt that something was wrong.\u201cLet Sheng Zi come in.\u201d Leng Wuyan instructed.\u201cYes.\u201d The female disciple backed off after responding.A moment later, Li Ran entered the hall. \u201cDisciple Li Ran greets the Master\u2026 and also Elder Sun.\u201d\u201cSheng Zi.\u201d Elder Sun nodded.Leng Wuyan cleared her throat. \u201cRan\u2019 er, come here\u2026 Ahem, why are you looking for me?\u201dSeeing that there were outsiders present, Li Ran naturally wouldn\u2019t tell the truth. He rolled his eyes and said, \u201cI\u2019m having difficulty in my cultivation. I\u2019m here to ask the sect master to solve my confusion.\u201d\u201cEr\u2026it turned out that\u2026\u201d Leng Wuyan tried her best to suppress her smile\u201cIt\u2019s rare for you to be so diligent. Follow me to the Martial Arts Hall. I\u2019ll check your cultivation progress.\u201d Then she quickly left the hall.At this moment, Leng Wuyan didn\u2019t have any of her emperor-level expert aura but was just like a little sister next door.Elder Sun pinched her chin as she watched the two leave.\u201cWhy do I feel like the Sect Master is acting weird?\u201d No matter how hard she smacked her head, she would never imagine that the Sect Master was actually in love with her disciple!\u2014Martial Arts Hall\u2026Leng Wuyan held her hand behind her back. \u201cThere\u2019s no one else here. Tell me, why are you looking for me?\u201dLi Ran scratched his head. \u201cDisciple is here to apologize to you Master.\u201d\u201cApologize?\u201d Leng Wuyan thought of what had happened yesterday, and the itching feeling on her chest rose up again. \u201cYou, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\u201cIn order to win the spar, I\u2019ve taken advantage of my master\u2019s concern. I truly feel guilty. I even accidentally touched your restricted area\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d Leng Wuyan turned her head and blushed. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about this anymore. Besides, I\u2019m not blaming you\u2026\u201d\u201cThis disciple is relieved, master.\u201d Li Ran heaved a sigh of relief.\u201cBy the way, what about your conditions? Have you thought it through?\u201d Leng Wuyan asked.\u201cI\u2019ve thought it through.\u201d Li Ran nodded.\u201cOh? Tell me.\u201d Leng Wuyan was curious.Li Ran cleared his throat. \u201cThe disciple wants to do what a couple should do with each other, Master!\u201dLeng Wuyan: \u2211(\u2299\u0434\u2299\u30ce)\u30cePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19: Leng Wuyan\u2019s first!\u201cDo things that a couple would do!?\u201d Leng Wuyan was taken by surprise and her white and tender earlobe instantly turned pink.Of course, you have to sleep together.The answer of that deaconess lingered in her mind.Ran\u2019er actually wanted to\u2026Too embarrassing!Li Ran said, \u201cEver since I spoke to you that day, I have never done my duty as a boyfriend, so I want to use this opportunity to communicate deeply with you.\u201d\u201cBoyfriend\u2019s duties? Communicate deeply?\u201dThese words are too explicit!Leng Wuyan\u2019s face turned even redder and smoke was practically coming out of her ears. \u201cBut\u2026 isn\u2019t this too fast? We\u2019ve only been together for a few days!\u201d\u201cDisciple has been with Master for ten years.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that\u2026\u201d\u201cMaster, there\u2019s no need to be nervous. It\u2019s also the first time for this disciple.\u201d\u201cHow could I not be nervous!\u201dLeng Wuyan couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cB-but the gap in our cultivations is too big!\u201dLi Ran shook his head. \u201cThis matter has nothing to do with cultivation.\u201d\u201cThat is also true\u2026\u201d Leng Wuyan\u2019s fingers intertwined nervously.Do I want to agree with him?\u00a0She felt like there was a rampaging deer in her chest.\u201cI told you yesterday that you can\u2019t ask for too much. Aren\u2019t you being too abrupt? I want to think about it.\u201d After struggling for a while, she decided to calm down first.\u201cAlright.\u201d Li Ran was a little disappointed.Leng Wuyan couldn\u2019t bear to see this and comforted him, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be in a hurry. There are still plenty of days ahead. You and I are in a relationship, and this fact will not change.\u201dThis was the first time she said something like this; she could feel that her cheeks were burning.Li Ran sighed. \u201cThis disciple understands. However, this ticket will not be available after tonight.\u201d\u201cWhat ticket?\u201d Leng Wuyan was taken aback for a moment.Li Ran took out two wooden signs and said, \u201cA group of singers has come to Coldwind City. I asked someone to get me two tickets. I wanted to ask Master to go there with me\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Leng Wuyan gulped. \u201cSo you just wanted to ask me to go there with you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Li Ran scratched his head in embarrassment. \u201cThis is my first date, so I am a little nervous.\u201dLeng Wuyan covered her forehead.So it is like this\u2026 This is so awkward!\u201cSince Master isn\u2019t going, then this disciple isn\u2019t going either. I\u2019ll give Elder Sun the ticket. I think I remember that she loves listening to music,\u201d Li Ran thought to himself.\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cElder Sun has gone to the Western Region on a business trip and has no time to listen to the music.\u201d\u201cBut I just saw her when I came in?\u201d Li Ran thought back at her.\u201cThen you should be mistaken.\u201d Leng Wuyan looked serious.Elder Sun, who was walking halfway down the mountain, suddenly sneezed.She rubbed her nose, \u201cWho\u2019s talking about me\u2026\u201d\u2014Leng Wuyan said, \u201cSince you have already bought the tickets, it would be a waste to throw them away. I will reluctantly accompany you there.\u201d\u201cActually, it doesn\u2019t cost much. Master doesn\u2019t have to force herself.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u2014Finally, they agreed on a meeting date and then Li Ran headed out first.When he was no longer in sight, Leng Wuyan was jumping around the Martial Arts Hall disregarding the image of a sect leader.\u201cI\u2019m going on a date. This is my first date with Ran er!\u201d\u201cSo he gave it his all to win against me yesterday just to ask me to go on a date with him!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s so thoughtful!\u201d After a bout of excitement, she took out a small book from her bosom.\u201cThings to do in a relationship: date and listen to music\u2026. Looks like it\u2019ll all be done today!\u201d Leng Wuyan\u2019s eyes were sparkling.\u2014Mount Xuanling. \u00a0A garden at the back of the mountain.Li Ran stood waiting, and a gust of wind blew behind him.Turning around, Leng Wuyan stood behind him. Today, her dress was even shorter than before, revealing her fair calves and round knees. She also wore a cute hairpin.Li Ran was stunned and muttered, \u201cMaster, you\u2019re so cute today.\u201dLeng Wuyan had a smile on her face. \u201cYour mouth is too sweet.\u201d\u201cThis disciple is speaking the truth.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dThe two soared into the sky and flew towards Coldwind City.\u2014Cold Wind City.The city was located in the north of Mount Xuanling; it was the closest city to Youluo Temple.With Leng Wuyan\u2019s cultivation, she could arrive there with a thought.However, she chose to slowly follow behind Li Ran.Not long after, the two landed on the streets of the city. The surrounding pedestrians glanced at them but were not too surprised.There were a lot of cultivators in the city, and people were already familiar with their kind.The two walked towards the theater.Along the way, most of the people\u2019s gazes were focused on Li Ran. Among the cultivators, there was seldom one with such an appearance.However, to the cold beauty, Leng Wuyan, they all seemed to ignore her.Li Ran was a little surprised. His master was a rare and extraordinary beauty. Logically speaking, they should not be so indifferent to her.He glanced at Leng Wuyan.Her red lips and white teeth were pleasing to one\u2019s eyes.\u201cYou\u2019re very beautiful. Are these people blind?\u201dPfft~Leng Wuyan couldn\u2019t help but laugh. She shook her head and said, \u201cAs long as I\u2019m not willing, they won\u2019t see me.\u201dShe knew her situation. If she really revealed her appearance, she would face countless troubles.Apart from the troubles from her enemies and wooers, just the news of Leng Wuyan entering Coldwind City would put the whole Imperial Court in turmoil.\u201cIt\u2019s better to keep a low profile.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20: Listening to Music and Killing!The theater was the largest and most luxurious in Coldwind City. The pavilion cornices were antique. Not only did it cover a huge area, but it was also decorated magnificently. The vermillion gate stood there imposingly. There was a black plaque on the main door.The plaque had three gilded words:Moon Watching Pavillion.When the servant in front of the door saw Li Ran, he quickly walked up.\u201cYoung Master, are you here to listen to music or to watch the theatre?\u201d He had seen countless people and had a keen eye for guests. From Li Ran\u2019s clothes and temperament, he could tell that Li Ran was definitely a noble guest.Li Ran took out two tickets and handed them to him.The manservant looked at the ticket and his eyes lit up. \u201cSo Sir turned out to be an honored guest!\u201dHis attitude became more respectful as he cupped his hand and led Li Ran inside.\u201cThis is a ticket for two guests. There should be another guest, right?\u201d The servant boy asked.Li Ran glanced at Leng Wu Yan on his side and said with a smile, \u201cShe\u2019ll be here soon. Take me upstairs first.\u201d (Note: In C19, Leng Wuyan has an ability that could make others turn a blind eye to her. So in this context, the servant could only see Li Ran.)\u201cAll right.\u201d\u201cOne honored guest!\u201d The servant shouted and led Li Ran into the luxurious private room in the center.The decoration in the room was even more magnificent. It was as resplendent as a palace, and the fragrance of the spiritual wooden furniture was present everywhere.Even the tea leaves and fruits here were more expensive than those in the hall.It could be seen that this place\u2019s master understood the mentality of rich people.Li Ran and Leng Wuyan finally sat down in their respective seats.There were only two of them in the private room. They could see the entire stage from above, but the guests in the hall could not see them.This gave them a sense of privacy.For some reason, Leng Wuyan suddenly felt a little nervous.Li Ran handed her a cup of hot tea. \u201cMaster, please have some tea.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShe picked up the teacup and asked, \u201cWhat tune are we listening to today?\u201dLi Ran thought for a moment. \u201cThere are a total of five songs. The first one seems to be called Chun Ting Qiu Yue.\u201d (Note, \u6625\u5ef7\u79cb\u6708/Chun Ting Qiu Yue, Spring Courtyards and Autumn Moon.)\u201cGood.\u201dThe two arrived earlier and had to wait a while before the performance began.A beautiful lady walked onto the stage with her pipa in her arms and sat on the high stool in the middle.As soon as the song started, the hall fell silent.The melodious and mournful sound of the pipa resounded in the theater.It was as if a young woman was standing in the courtyard. She was mourning over the withered leaves. Beside her, there was only an autumn moon accompanying her.This piece flawlessly expressed the loneliness of love. The musician was very skilled and perfectly conveyed the essence of the song to the audience.Even Leng Wuyan\u2019s eyes became blank. She recalled the days when she was alone. She cultivated alone amidst the fallen leaves\u2026 she cultivated alone amidst the falling snow\u2026It was clear that those days were real, but she did not have much of an impression of it, nor could she recall much of those experiences.On the contrary, in the short two days after Li Ran had confessed, she could remember everything that happened and every conversation they had very vividly.When she was alone, Leng Wuyan thought that this was for the best.However, after falling in love, she found out how difficult it was to have such a day. She felt like she could never go back to that life.Leng Wuyan stole a glance at Li Ran. She saw that he had also sensed it and his face was as sharp as a knife at this moment.\u201cSince you can\u2019t go back, just forget about it.\u201d\u201cIn fact, this feeling\u2026 is also very good.\u201d \u00a0A smile appeared on her lips.At the end of the song, the audience was still immersed in their emotions. They were unable to recover for a long time, and there were even suppressed sobs.\u201cThis musician is great. She has the skills and the emotions. Her playing can move one\u2019s heart.\u201d Li Ran praised.\u201cYes, she\u2019s really skilled.\u201d Leng Wuyan agreed with him.Just in the middle of the recess, a sound came from the private room next door.A loud voice rang out, \u201cThis is the best theatre in Coldwind City? I think it\u2019s so-so.\u201dThe others chimed in, \u201cJust like what Young Master Wang had said, it is indeed so-so.\u201dYoung Master Wang continued, \u201cIf you want to play a song, better play something cheerful. Such as Night Song, Mo Chou Yue, or something like that. To play such a miserable tune, it\u2019s like a bitch that no one wants!\u201d\u201cHahaha, that\u2019s right!\u201dNight Song and Mo Chou Yue were well-known folk tunes. The tunes and lyrics of these songs were vibrant and could only be heard in red-light districts.Li Ran and Leng Wuyan looked at each other, shook their heads, and smiled.No matter where they go, there is no shortage of these kinds of people.That Young Master Wang had obviously drunk quite a bit of wine, and he couldn\u2019t speak clearly. \u201cMentioning the tragic woman, there\u2019s one on Mount Xuan Ling, isn\u2019t it? That old woman is suitable to listen to this song.\u201d\u201cWho is Young Master Wang referring to?\u201d\u201cOther than that cold demoness, who else could it be?\u201d Young Master Wang said teasingly. \u201cI heard that the old woman hasn\u2019t been wanted for hundreds of years, and she won\u2019t even let her disciples fall in love. Isn\u2019t she psychopathic?\u201d\u201c Shh! Young Master Wang, don\u2019t dare talk nonsense! That person is an emperor-level cultivator, how could you casually talk about her? This is a matter of losing your head!\u201d The others hurriedly stopped him.\u201cLook at your guts! There are many people talking about her in the entire world. Was she able to kill them all? I guess she\u2019s old and ugly, so that\u2019s why she\u2019s been single for hundreds of years, right? Hahaha!\u201d Young Master Wang smiled mockingly.\u201cYoung Master Wang, stop talking\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s toast!\u201d\u2014Silence.A moment later, Li Ran stood up silently and walked towards the door.\u201cRan\u2019er, what are you going to do?\u201d Leng Wuyan asked aloud.Li Ran\u2019s eyes were as cold as iron.\u201cKill!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21: Dating, Listening to Songs, Eating Candy Figurines\u201cKilling him?\u201d Leng Wuyan shook her head. \u201cIf I want to kill him, it only needs a thought, so why should you act?\u201dLi Ran said, \u201cBut this is a boyfriend\u2019s responsibility.\u201dLeng Wuyan smiled. \u201cAlright, that\u2019s enough.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not enough. He has to die.\u201d Li Ran was really intent on killing Young Master Wang.He had not only insulted the Sect Master of Youluo Temple but his girlfriend!Leng Wuyan stood up and pulled him back to his seat. She said, \u201cActually, he said something right. There are a lot of people talking behind my back around the world. Can you actually kill them all?\u201dLi Ran gritted his teeth and said, \u201cIf I meet one, I\u2019ll kill one. If there are two, I\u2019ll kill them both! Let\u2019s see who else will dare to talk nonsense!\u201dLeng Wuyan was stunned. Looking at the stubborn boy in front of her, a trace of warmth flashed through her eyes.\u201cCompared to the Emperor-level, they are all ants. Do you think I care about what ants think?\u201d\u201cIn that case, am I an ant?\u201d Li Ran raised his eyebrows.Leng Wuyan pouted and rolled her eyes at him. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant, my lord boyfriend!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201d Li Ran raised his eyebrows and exhaled.The two looked at each other and smiled. The atmosphere gradually eased.Li Ran couldn\u2019t help but sigh when he heard the clamor next door. \u201c Ugh\u2026 I really want to kill him!\u201d\u201cAlright, today is our first date. Don\u2019t let others spoil it.\u201d Leng Wuyan comforted him.Looking at her calm expression, Li Ran\u2019s heart was a little confused.What had she experienced in the past hundreds of years for her to be indifferent to such criticism?She is a demon, an Emperor-level expert, but at the same time, she is also a woman!\u00a0When he thought of this, his heart ached.\u201cWho\u2019s old and ugly? There\u2019s no better looking woman in this world than my Master!\u201d\u201cThe reason why Master has been alone for hundreds of years is that those mortals do not deserve to stand by your side!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s just an idiot!\u201d Li Ran was indignant.Leng Wuyan was a little shy. \u201cI\u2019m not as good as you said\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course not! Master is the cutest, most beautiful, and most gentle girl I\u2019ve ever seen. Even the nicest words can not describe you,\u201d Li Ran swore.Even though she had heard Li Ran\u2019s flowery words many times, Leng Wuyan still couldn\u2019t resist such a blatant confession.She lowered her head and buried her cheeks into the fur collar of her robe. She stammered, \u201cI know, I know. You need not speak so loudly.\u201dThe gloom in her heart quietly faded, and her eyes seemed to be flowing with stars.No matter what the world is like. As long as someone liked you in this way, it would be enough.\u2014With something like this happening, they naturally didn\u2019t have any mood to keep listening to the concert.The two walked out of the Moon Watching Pavillion and slowly walked along the street.The air during winter nights was exceptionally fresh. The soles of their shoes making slight crackling noises with every step they took inside the snowThe fiery lanterns on the side of the road and the shouts of vendors, matched with the steaming heat, had the ability to calm one\u2019s heart and soul.The ruckus in the mortal world was the most comforting. At this moment, Li Ran saw a certain stall and his eyes lit up.\u201cMaster, wait for me.\u201d After saying that, he trotted over.\u201cHuh?\u201d Leng Wuyan was stunned.Not long after, Li Ran returned with an amber candy figurine. (note, Candy figurine, Similar to a gingerbread man, but made of candy)\u201cTake it!\u201dLeng Wuyan reached out and took it.This was a fairy-shaped candy figurine. Although its face was not as clear, its clothes fluttered in the air and gave it a kind of immortal-like romantic charm.Li Ran smiled and said, \u201cWhen I was a kid, I would eat a candy figurine every time I went out to play. I always choose to eat a hero. I thought that if I ate it, I would be able to become a hero too.\u201dPfft~Leng Wuyan couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cThen after eating this, will I become a fairy?\u201d\u201cYou already are one.\u201d\u201cYou and your sweet mouth.\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201dLeng Wuyan opened her cherry lips and took a bite.\u201cIs it delicious?\u201d Li Ran asked.Looking at his curious expression, Leng Wuyan looked over and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll know if you taste it.\u201dLi Ran looked at the bright red lip print on it and was stunned.\u201cAh!\u201d Only then did Leng Wuyan come to her senses and hurriedly try to put the candy figurine out of Li Ran\u2019s reach.However, Li Ran\u2019s movements were so quick that he had already taken a big bite before she could take the figurine back.He bit the part stained with red and said ambiguously, \u201cHow sweet!\u201dLeng Wuyan turned her head as her face flushed red. \u201cThis is a candy figurine. It would be weird if it was not sweet.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s different. This time, it\u2019s not only sweet, it also has the fragrance of rouge.\u201d Li Ran smiled wickedly.\u201cSo cheeky! I don\u2019t want to talk with you anymore!\u201d Leng Wuyan stamped her feet in embarrassment and walked forward.Li Ran quickly followed. \u201cMaster, please give me another bite.\u201d\u201cNo, this is mine!\u201d\u201cJust one bite.\u201d\u201cNo! You\u2019ve already bitten off the fairy\u2019s head!\u201d\u2014The bright moon reflected the two of them, and their figures in the snow grew longer and longer, gradually melding together.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22: Give Him a Chance to Reincarnate!The two wandered around town for a long time.Leng Wuyan rarely came out to play. She was curious and wanted to try everything.Of course, everything was just a small taste\u2026\u201cSect Master, I really can\u2019t eat anymore,\u201d Li Ran looked at the osmanthus cake she handed him and said with a serious expression.\u201cIt would be too wasteful to throw it away. Are you going to do such a thing to the farmer uncle?\u201d Leng Wuyan asked with her head tilted.\u201cThis is not something I bought. I have a clear conscience,\u201d Li Ran said calmly.\u201cBut if you don\u2019t eat it I\u2019ll feel sorry for the farmer uncle. Are you trying to put me into a situation where I\u2019m unjust?\u201d Her mind took a strange turn.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAs expected of a female demon. What twisted logic.\u201d\u201cAre you going to eat it or not?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll eat.\u201d Li Ran tried his best to swallow the osmanthus cake.At this moment, another shout came nearby, \u201cPlum cake, fresh plum cake~\u201dLi Ran burped and broke out in cold sweat.\u201cHave you had plum cake before? I haven\u2019t had one yet.\u201d Leng Wuyan was indeed interested.\u201cMaster!\u201d Li Ran quickly stopped her. \u201cWe\u2019ve already eaten enough. Coldwind City\u2019s GDP has increased by at least 1 percent. Why don\u2019t we stop here for today?\u201d\u201cBut I haven\u2019t eaten plum cake yet\u2026\u201d Leng Wuyan quipped.Li Ran followed suit and said, \u201cWe can save it for the next date.\u201d\u201cNext date?\u201d Leng Wuyan\u2019s eyes lit up. She was already thinking about what to do on her next date.He took the opportunity to quickly pull her away.After they almost went all over Coldwind City, Leng Wuyan finished the date with a feeling of satisfaction.The two flew back to the sect under the dim moonlight, landing in a garden of Xuan Ling Mountain.At this time all the lights were already extinguished and only the sounds of a silent mountain night could be heard. The disciples and elders were already asleep.Because men and women were forbidden to enter a relationship, the Youluo Temple didn\u2019t have much nightlife. Everyone had the good habit of sleeping early and getting up early.Except for the Sect Master and the Sheng Zi.The night wind blew and Leng Wuyan suddenly felt reluctant.\u201cThe first date ended like this\u2026\u201dAlthough something unpleasant had happened in the middle, it made her understand Li Ran\u2019s sincerity and their relationship became closer.\u201cRan\u2019er, tonight\u2026 are you happy?\u201d Leng Wuyan couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cOf course I\u2019m happy.\u201d Li Ran nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s good. I\u2019m worried that you\u2019ll become repulsive towards shopping after today.\u201d She let out a sigh of relief.After all, the original plan was to listen to music.\u201cAs long as I can be together with you Master, even if we just end up wandering in a daze, I will always be happy as long as it\u2019s with you\u201d Li Ran\u2019s EQ exploded.\u201cYou and your smooth tongue! I\u2019ll go rest.\u201d Leng Wuyan turned around and left with a charming smile on her face.\u201cGood night, Master.\u201d\u201cGood night.\u201dLi Ran watched her figure disappear. He hadn\u2019t realized that his mentality towards her was changing. He was even starting to look forward to their next date.\u201cOf course, it would be nicer if I wouldn\u2019t have to eat so much.\u201d He burped letting off a strong smell of osmanthus cake.\u201cBut, before I go to bed, I have to do something.\u201d Li Ran\u2019s eyes gradually turned cold.Ding~A system prompt suddenly sounded in his mind:\u3010Mission released.\u3011\u3010Wang Family\u2019s Young Master, Wang Yue, was completely heartless and full of evil. Please give him a chance to reincarnate.\u3011\u201cWang Yue?\u201d Li Ran was stunned for a moment. He sensed the location provided by the system and smiled.Coldwind City, Moon Watching Pavillion!\u201cSo it\u2019s that Young Master Wang. Looks like the System and I finally agree on something!\u201d\u2014Moon Watching Pavillion.The show was over and the guests dispersed in groups of two and three.A richly dressed young man staggered out. He was followed by several men.\u201c Aiyo, Young Master Wang, please slow down. Look at the steps and be careful not to fall.\u201d His companion came over and helped him.Wang Yue waved his hand and said vaguely, \u201cLet go. I\u2019m not drunk!\u201d\u201cI know that you\u2019re not drunk, but the road is too slippery!\u201d\u201cYoung Master Wang, you are known for your ability to hold liquor. We all know this.\u201d His companions flattered him.Wang Yue waved his hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Another round!\u201dAn obscene-looking man came over and said with a smile, \u201cYoung Master Wang, I\u2019ve arranged for you to have a taste of some superior goods in the Spring Festival Pavilion. Do you want to try them?\u201d\u201cSuperior?\u201d Wang Yue\u2019s lips curled and he said, \u201cThe ordinary girls in the prostitution house don\u2019t deserve to enter my sight!\u201d\u201cHow could that be! They\u2019re all from good families. They\u2019ve been drugged and are now in a daze. I\u2019ll wait for you to personally inspect the goods.\u201d The wretched man\u2019s smile became even more wicked.\u201cOh? Interesting. Let\u2019s go take a look!\u201d Wang Yue was excited.The wretched man said flirtatiously, \u201cThen the thing about us and your Wang family\u2019s cooperation\u2026\u201dWang Yue patted him on the shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. As long as you make me happy, everything will be fine!\u201d\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll be at ease with your words! This way, please!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d The group left the Moon Watching Pavillion, completely unaware that a shadow was quietly following them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23: Dark Moonlight, Breeze, Night of Murder!The same night\u2026Wang Yue\u2019s group wobbled along the empty street.Because their destination wasn\u2019t too far and they wanted to sober up, they chose to walk instead of sitting on a sedan chair.At this moment, the pedestrian light in the city had already been extinguished.What\u2019s left were the extinguished red lanterns on both sides of the road that were hanging high and the reflection of the dark moonlight that remained.The winter night wind whimpered, blowing the floating snow off the ground and fluttering in the air.\u201c Hiss, why does it feel a little chilly here\u2026\u201d one of them whispered.\u201cChilly? Are you afraid of ghosts?\u201d Wang Yue laughed.\u201cNo, but I feel a little chill from behind,\u201d the man explained.\u201cDo you feel your back aching too? When you pee, you probably also can\u2019t empty your bladder.\u201d Wang Yue patted him on the shoulder. \u201cBrother, you\u2019re probably crippled down there.\u201d\u201cHahaha!\u201d\u201cLiu Sheng, I said you can\u2019t\u2026!\u201d There was a burst of laughter.Wang Yue chuckled and said, \u201cIf there are women in your family, I can help you take care of them for free. Don\u2019t thank me. It\u2019s all a brother\u2019s responsibility.\u201dLiu Sheng\u2019s face turned red and he gritted his teeth, saying nothing.Wang Yue strutted forward and that wretched man suddenly grabbed him.\u201cWait!\u201d\u201cWhat? You\u2019re also afraid of ghosts?\u201d Wang Yue said impatiently.The wretched man shook his head and pointed at the front. \u201cThere seems to be someone ahead\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Wang Yue looked and saw a man standing in the middle of the street. His white clothes were very conspicuous in the night.\u201cIt\u2019s just some person? Are we not humans as well?\u201d Wang Yue scoffed and did not take the white figure seriously.When they got close, he even made a joke. \u201cBrother, are you pretending to be a snowman in the middle of the night?\u201dLi Ran smiled. \u201cYoung Master Wang is quite humorous.\u201d\u201cYou know me?\u201d\u201cLin City Wang Family\u2019s Eldest Young Master, how could I not know you?\u201dThe few of them looked at each other and noticed that something was wrong.However, Wang Yue didn\u2019t realize it because of the function of alcohol.\u201cYou have a good eye! I didn\u2019t expect my big name to reach this Cold Wind City. Haha!\u201dLi Ran nodded. \u201cOf course, Young Master Wang is notoriously bold.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Wang Yue was stunned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dLi Ran\u2019s smile was chilly. \u201cYou were rude and insulted the Sect Master of the Youluo Temple and the Emperor-level expert Leng Wuyan in public. Do you think you\u2019re brave?\u201dHiss!No matter how slow Wang Yue\u2019s nerves were, he could also realize something was wrong at this moment. He took two steps back and said sternly, \u201cWho are you?!\u201d\u201cThere were many people talking behind her back in the world, so you think I couldn\u2019t kill them all? I\u2019ll come at them one by one!\u201d Li Ran\u2019s eyes were deep. \u201cLet\u2019s start with you.\u201d\u201cStop him!\u201d Wang Yue exclaimed and quickly retreated.The bodyguards rushed forward. However, in a blink of an eye, Li Ran\u2019s figure had already disappeared in place.Wang Yue had just taken two steps when someone patted him on the shoulder.His body froze and he turned around in shock. What came into his sight was Li Ran\u2019s smiling face.\u201cLet me go, let me go \u2026\u2026\u201dLi Ran shook his head. \u201cYou may have ten thousand reasons to live, but just one reason to kill you is enough.\u201dWith that, Li Ran raised his finger and lightly touched his forehead.The air seemed to freeze at this instant.Bang!Wang Yue\u2019s body exploded like a balloon. His flesh and blood splattered across the snow like fireworks on a winter night.He was only a mortal and to Li Ran, he was just as fragile as a baby.Li Ran\u2019s white clothes didn\u2019t even get stained by the fine dust. He turned around and smiled. \u201cTell me, is he too courageous?\u201dEveryone was shocked and their backs turned cold.At this moment, the wretched man said with a trembling voice, \u201cHe is the young master of the Wang family in Lin City. His father is Wang Feng, a Nascent Soul realm expert. Aren\u2019t you afraid of the Wang family\u2019s revenge!\u201dHe originally wanted to intimidate Li Ran so that he could save his own life.He didn\u2019t expect Li Ran to nod his head and said as if thinking something, \u201cYes, that\u2019s right. Looks like I have to kill you to silence you.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d The wretched man was stunned, and a dark light flickered in his eyes.His expression froze at the last moment. His head fell and rolled on the ground for some distance before stopping.The rest of them covered their mouths, trembling and not daring to speak.Li Ran said calmly, \u201cIf you want to avenge them, you can come to Mount Xuanling to find me. My name is Li Ran. I\u2019ll fight you any time.\u201d After saying that, he flew up and left.The reason why he said his name was not to be pretentious. He just didn\u2019t want to blame Leng Wuyan for this murder.She had already restrained herself. He was the one who had the killing intent.Everyone stood there for a full fifteen minutes.After confirming that Li Ran had really left, the rest of them staggered and slumped on the snow. Looking at the blood and flesh on the ground, someone couldn\u2019t help but vomit.\u201cWang Yue died\u2026 just like that?\u201d\u201cJust now, that person said that he belongs to Mount Xuanling. Isn\u2019t that the location of Youluo Temple?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a drunken spout, yet it can\u2019t escape their ears and eyes. The top-level Devil Sect is truly terrifying!\u201d Their faces were filled with fear.They would never have thought that the Sect Master of Youluo Temple was just sitting next to them\u2026\u201cWait!\u201d Liu Sheng exclaimed, \u201cWhat did he say he was called? Li Ran?\u201dThey became silent.\u201cLi, Li Ran?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24: It\u2019s over! A slip of tongue!The north wind whistled through the streets, and the air turned chilly. However, everyone\u2019s hearts were even colder than the cold breeze.\u201cCould this person be Li Ran?\u201d There were people speaking with unbelievable looks.Liu Sheng laughed bitterly. \u201cHe\u2019s from the Youlou Temple, and he\u2019s so young, yet his cultivation is profound. Other than the Sheng Zi of the Devil Sect, who else can he be?\u201dHiss!Everyone seemed to be splashed with cold water.Li Ran, the Sheng Zi of the Devil Sect. His innate talent was beyond compare, and he was born with a Daoist Mark.At the age of eight, he entered the Youlou Temple. At the age of twelve, he had reached Foundation Establishment, and at the age of seventeen, he had entered the Golden Core realm.This terrifying cultivation speed was something that was rarely seen in the entire Vast Lands. He could be said to be the reincarnation of an immortal emperor!He was Leng Wuyan\u2019s successor, the future sect leader of the Youlou Temple. If he had enough time to grow, he would definitely be a demon king who could trample on the entire vast land in the future!He was also listed as the focus of the major sects.Who would have thought that Wang Yue\u2019s drunken words would actually provoke such a person to personally take action?Wang Yue\u2019s death wasn\u2019t unjust.Liu Sheng stood up and said, \u201cThis is the enmity between Youluo Temple and the Wang Family. It has nothing to do with our Liu Family. Brothers, I will take my leave first!\u201dHe then turned around and left directly.The others all reacted.\u201cThis matter has nothing to do with our Zhang family!\u201d\u201cSo is the Sun family. Wang Yue and I are not familiar with each other at all!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just passing by tonight. The Meng Clan didn\u2019t participate in this!\u201dJust now, they had exchanged cups with Wang Yue to seek cooperation, but now, they were itching to get rid of him.They were done with the Wang Family and they didn\u2019t want to be buried with them.That was the might of the Youlou Temple!All the clans and families in Coldwind City were tied up together, but with all clans tied up together, they were incomparable to the Youlou Temple!\u201cThis group of old dogs! Just now, you were flattering Young Master, but now that something happened, you wanted to be clear of responsibility?!\u201d Wang Yue\u2019s bodyguard shouted angrily.They had come from Lin City to protect Wang Yue\u2019s safety. Now that Wang Yue had died, they definitely didn\u2019t have any good juice to eat!\u201cI will report it to the Patriarch! Just wait for the Wang Family\u2019s punishment!\u201d the leader of the guards spoke righteously.Hearing this, everyone paused for a moment and looked at each other wordlessly.\u201cWang Family isn\u2019t worthy in the eyes of the Youlou Temple\u2026 However, for us, this is indeed quite a problem.\u201d Liu Sheng sighed.\u201c Hmph, it\u2019s good you\u2019re afraid!\u201d The leader of the guards said complacently.The crowd didn\u2019t pay any attention to him and went on to exchange views with a low voice.\u201cTherefore, this matter must not spread.\u201d\u201cThen we can only exterminate them.\u201d\u201cZhang Family seconded.\u201d\u201cThe Sun Family seconded.\u201d\u201cMeng Clan\u2026\u201dThe guard leader was stunned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cWhat are you waiting for? Let\u2019s go.\u201d Liu Sheng revealed a sinister smile.\u201cKill them!\u201dBlood sprayed out, and the empty street once again howled in pain.\u2014Li Ran returned to the sect and took a warm bath under Aqin\u2019s services.Today was the first time he had killed anyone since he had crossed over. However, he didn\u2019t have any guilty feelings. Instead, he took it for granted.This world was originally a chaotic world. It was a world where people had to kill each other to live an extra day!It would take tens of millions of reasons to survive, but only one reason would be enough to get killed.Wang Yue was indeed a damned person.When the system released the mission, it displayed the evil that the other party had done.Of course, Li Ran was not interested in speaking for the righteous.Even if there were no missions, Wang Yue would also die today!As for that wretched man\u2026It was purely because he heard what this wretched man had said earlier, \u201cSuperior goods\u2026They\u2019re all from good families. They\u2019ve been drugged\u2026 \u201c. He felt that this fellow was too disgusting and just cut him off by the way.He summoned the system.\u3010Mission complete\u3011\u3010Degree of completion: Perfect\u3011\u3010Obtained an advanced treasure chest *1.\u3011Li Ran opened the treasure chest.\u3010Congratulations to the host for obtaining the divine ability \u2018Demon Thrashing Fist\u2019\u3011\u201cDivine Ability?\u201d His heart skipped a beat.This was the first time he had received a divine ability as a reward. He looked closely at the introduction to the reward.The Demon Thrashing Fist was a Buddhist Divine Skill. When one uses his full strength, his arms will erupt with golden light, and Qi will be manifested on his fingers like a spinning wheel, emitting out dazzling light!With a single punch, the fiendish demons would wail and howl!It was said to be a powerful skill both for traveling and at home, killing demons, and eliminating evil spirits!\u201cGood stuff!\u201dLi Ran expressed his satisfaction.He extended his right hand and circulated his divine ability. His hand immediately erupted with blazing white light, illuminating the bedroom like it was daytime.His right hand was translucent, and he could even see the bones and blood vessels beneath his skin as if they were made of white jade!\u201cWow, that\u2019s amazing.\u201d Aqin excitedly clapped. \u201cSheng Zi, what\u2019s the name of this move?\u201dLi Ran raised the brightness of the skill by three levels, then waved his hand and the white light went out.\u201cThis move is called a \u2018flashlight\u2019.\u201d\u201cWhat a powerful flashlight!\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Li Ran said curiously,\u201d Can you understand this move?\u201dAqin shook her head and said seriously, \u201cI don\u2019t understand. However, Sheng Zi\u2019s divine ability is definitely the most powerful.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLi Ran couldn\u2019t help but laugh as he pinched her little face. \u201cYou\u2019re such a blind idiot.\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201d Aqin smiled charmingly.Although she didn\u2019t know what blind idiot was, this kind of contact made her very happy.\u201cBy the way, Lord Sheng Zi, you came back late today. Have you been cultivating?\u201d as she massaged him, she asked.Li Ran leaned comfortably into the bucket and replied casually, \u201cNo, I went on a date with the Sect Master tonight.\u201d\u201cA date with the Sect Master?\u201dAqin stared at him blankly.Li Ran: \u250c(\u3002\u0434\u3002)\u2510F*ck, my mouth slipped!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25: How to talk about loveHe had experienced too many things today, and the water temperature in the wooden barrel was too comfortable, which made Li Ran slip up.As a result, his tongue really slipped!\u201cAre you saying that you went on a date with the Sect Master?\u201d Aqin\u2019s face filled with endless question marks as she suspected that she had misheard.\u201cAh, this\u2026\u201d Li Ran\u2019s eyes turned. \u201cI meant that the Sect Master had summoned me for a meeting, or an appointment in short. It\u2019s not like what you think.\u201dHe wiped his cold sweat.This explanation was far-fetched, and no normal person would believe it.However, Aqin believed him and she suddenly said, \u201cSo it\u2019s like this! Sheng Zi, you scared me. I thought it was a kind of date between men and women.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLi Ran awkwardly replied, \u201cHow would that be possible\u2026\u201d\u201cSect Master hadn\u2019t been close to men for hundreds of years and had forbidden her disciples to fall in love. How could she go on a date with a disciple? As expected, I thought too much.\u201d Aqin patted her head.Not only did she believe him, she even helped him find excuses.The corner of Li Ran\u2019s mouth tugged. \u201cYeah\u2026 Haha\u2026\u201dOther than Aqin, no one would believe such a lame reason\u2026Although Li Ran knew that even if he told her about this matter, she would never spread it.But he still had to keep it a secret. Because this was an agreement between him and Leng Wuyan.\u201cI have to be more careful in the future. If someone else were to hear it, it won\u2019t be easy to explain.\u201d\u2014Demon Peak.Deacon Wang took a deep breath as she arrived in front of the Sect Master\u2019s bedchamber.\u201cStrange, why did Sect Master summon me during the middle of the night? I haven\u2019t made any mistakes lately either.\u201d She walked to the door and pressed the door nervously.CreakThe door was unlocked, revealing a gap.Deacon Wang took a deep breath and pushed the door open. Leng Wuyan was sitting on a chair, her right hand supporting her chin. Her eyes were unfocused as if she was in a daze.A wisp of hair hung down from her ear, blocking her fair and delicate profile.Deacon Wang couldn\u2019t help being stunned.The Sect Master really is beautiful!\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that such an iconic beauty is not interested in men\u2026\u201d Deacon Wang sighed inwardly.\u201cDisciple has come to see Sect Master. May I ask the reason why the Sect Master has summoned me this late at night?\u201d she said respectfully.Leng Wuyan snapped back to her senses and said, \u201cI\u2019ve encountered a bottleneck in my cultivation recently. I think it\u2019s because I don\u2019t understand worldly affairs enough. In order to improve my understanding of the Dao, there are a few small questions that I wanted to ask you. I hope you can answer them frankly.\u201dDeacon Wang hurriedly said, \u201cIf it\u2019s about the Sect Master\u2019s cultivation, I\u2019ll do my best to help with anything!\u201d\u201cVery good.\u201d Leng Wuyan nodded. \u201cDo you remember what I asked you last time?\u201dDeacon Wang thought for a moment. \u201cThe talk about love?\u201d\u201c Cough, cough, no, It\u2019s regarding the method to see through the mortal world!\u201d Leng Wuyan corrected herself.\u201cLast time, you said that dating, listening to music, eating candy figurines\u2026 Other than that? What else can be done by two people in a relationship?\u201d\u201cSleeping together.\u201d Deacon Wang gave the standard answer.Leng Wuyan glared at her. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about the carnal relationship. It\u2019s about how the emotion between the two partners can be further cultivated and enhance the relationship.\u201d\u201cStill sleeping together.\u201d Deacon Wang was certain. \u201cThis kind of interaction is the best way to increase the feelings of both of them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIs there anything else besides this?\u201d Leng Wuyan was about to lose her temper.Deacon Wang thought for a moment. \u201cSect Master is saying that they\u2019ve already had a date and the relationship has been growing, but they haven\u2019t arrived on the stage to sleep together yet?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I meant.\u201d Leng Wuyan nodded.\u201cThey should start with holding hands,\u201d Deacon Wang replied.\u201cHolding hands?\u201d\u201cYes, this situation meant they should already have physical contact. Start by holding hands, then hugs and kisses. This represents different stages of love.\u201dLeng Wuyan blushed.She and Li Ran had eaten the same candy figurine, so was that counted as an indirect kiss\u2026?\u201cI got it. You go rest.\u201d\u201cYes, Sect Master. I hope you can break the bottleneck as soon as possible.\u201d Deacon Wang withdrew.She walked out of the bedroom and scratched her head in confusion.Recently, she felt that the Sect Master was getting more and more strange.\u00a0Is understanding such a problem really for cultivation?\u201cCould it be\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Sect Master is investigating relationships in order to pinpoint disciples who are engaged in romantic affairs?\u201d\u201cThis must be it!\u201d Deacon Wang concluded.\u201cSigh, it looks like I can\u2019t take a peek at Sheng Zi anymore\u2026\u201d She walked down the mountain dejectedly.In her concept, Leng Wuyan\u2019s absolutely insular to a relationship, so she didn\u2019t even think in that direction at all.\u2014In the room, Leng Wuyan took out a notebook and wrote down what Deacon Wang had said seriously.Under \u2018Dating, listening to music, eating Candy figurine\u2019, she continually wrote \u2018Hold hands, hugs, kisses.We should start with holding hands, right?But what should I do?If I took the initiative, I would seem too unreserved\u2026Under the gleaming candlelight, her pretty face was as red as an applePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26: A Letter from Family!Early in the morning.The moment Deacon Wang approached the kitchen, she heard clamor coming from inside.Her main business was to take care of the Sect Master\u2019s clothes and food. This kitchen was for the Sect Master\u2019s exclusive use. No one could enter without her keys.But unexpectedly there was someone inside?\u201cWhich daredevil dares to go in and steal food?\u201d Deacon Wang opened the door and rushed in angrily.\u201cHow bold, to actually dare to sneak in the\u2026 Sect Master?\u201d She was stunned.Leng Wuyan held the spoon in one hand and the lid in the other. Her fair face was stained with black marks.\u201cSect Master, what are you doing?\u201d Deacon Wang was puzzled.\u201cI\u2019m making soup.\u201d Leng Wuyan replied.\u201cSoup?\u201d Deacon Wang glanced at the black liquid in the pot and couldn\u2019t help but shiver.Are you sure this thing could be eaten?Leng Wuyan\u2019s brows furrowed slightly. \u201cStrange. According to my experience in refining pills, there\u2019s nothing wrong with the ingredients. Why does it look so ugly?\u201dDeacon Wang carefully asked, \u201cYou\u2026 What kind of soup is it?\u201dLeng Wuyan listed a few treasures, \u201cThe main material is the flesh of the Thunder Profound Eagle, the auxiliary materials are the Blood Essence Demon Fruit, the Ten Thousand Year Green Spirit Vine, and the Snow Bone Ginseng. It has the effect of nourishing the meridians, purifying Qi, and transforming the spirit.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dDeacon Wang did not know whether to laugh or cry.It would be weird if this could be tasty!\u201cSect Master, cooking is different from refining pills. It is not about the effects, but about the aesthetic, fragrance, and taste. For example, you seldom have to eat food, but you still do, why is that? It\u2019s just because of the delicious taste of the food.\u201dLeng Wuyan tilted her head and thought for a moment. \u201cThis makes sense.\u201dDeacon Wang took the spoon from her hand. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything you want to eat, just instruct those service disciples. There\u2019s no need for you to bother yourself.\u201dLeng Wuyan turned her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. This is also a form of cultivation.\u201dShe actually wanted to personally make the soup for Li Ran.Shouldn\u2019t a good girlfriend be like this?\u201cAt Sect Master\u2019s cultivation, I don\u2019t know much about the realm. However, if you\u2019re talking about cooking, I definitely know a little more than you,\u201d Deacon Wang said with a smile.\u201cYes!\u201d Leng Wuyan\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cDeacon Wang, come teach me how to make soup!\u201dDeacon Wang was a bit shocked. \u201cAh?\u201d\u2014Li Ran pushed the door and walked out, the warm sun shining on his body. He stretched his body in a pleasant mood.\u201cToday\u2019s weather is really good.\u201d With the existence of the Heaven Seizing Cultivation Method, he didn\u2019t need to meditate to cultivate. His cultivation base naturally increases by itself.This kind of salted fish\u2019s life was simply too good.\u201cTo bask in the sun, tease Aqin, and fall in love with the Sect Master. Such a wonderful life, even if an immortal wants to exchange with his cultivation, I would be unwilling!\u201d\u201cBut am I a bit derelict of duty as a villain?\u201dTo be honest, the Youluo Temple was completely different from the Devil Sect he remembered.The disciples here had a harmonious relationship. The elders were amiable, and even the Sect Master was very cute. The notoriety of a devil sect doesn\u2019t seem to exist here.\u201cI don\u2019t know how Youlou Temple became a Devil Sect, moreover one of the top devil sects\u2026\u201d Li Ran shook his head.\u201cSheng Zi!\u201d A lovely cry came from nearby, and Lu Xinran jumped up and down in front of him. \u201cSheng Zi, long time no see!\u201d\u201cHadn\u2019t I seen you yesterday\u2026???\u201d Ever since he helped her breakthrough last time, this girl had become even more clingy. Now, as long as Li Ran saw her, he would have a huge headache.\u201cI didn\u2019t see you for a day, yet it\u2019s like three autumns have already passed~\u201d Lu Xinran took out a small box and handed it to him. \u201cHere.\u201d\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Li Ran was puzzled.Lu Xinran smiled and said, \u201cThis is the pastry I made for you in the morning, I purposely got up four hours early today. It\u2019s absolutely delicious!\u201d\u201cYou know how to cook?\u201d Li Ran accepted the box suspiciously and a familiar smell assaulted his nostrils.\u201cThis would not be \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c~ Little Lu made an osmanthus cake. Sheng Zi, try it.\u201d\u201cAnother osmanthus cake?\u201d Li Ran\u2019s face turned green.Last night\u2019s osmanthus cake almost made him vomit. At first, he wanted to leave directly, but when he saw her bloodshot eyes, he hesitated for a moment before taking a piece and stuffing it into his mouth.Unexpectedly, the taste was quite good.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Lu Xinran looked at him eagerly.\u201cNot bad.\u201d Li Ran nodded.\u201cYes!\u201d Lu Xinran excitedly jumped up. \u201cAs long as Sheng Zi likes it, I can make it for you every day.\u201d\u201cForget it. Thank you.\u201d\u201cI can also make plum cake~\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLu Xinran hung around him for a while before being called back to cultivate. Li Ran finally let out a sigh of relief.At this moment, an Inner Sect disciple walked over, holding an envelope in his hand. \u201cSheng Zi, here is a letter to you.\u201d\u201cLetter? Who would have written to me?\u2019 Li Ran was a little curious.\u201cI also don\u2019t know. I only know that it was sent from Wuyang City.\u201dLi Ran immediately understood. \u201cThat should be a letter from my family.\u201dHe tore open the envelope and took out a piece of jade. Although it was a letter, it was not in the form of paper. Instead, the letter was made up of jade that was as thin as a cicada\u2019s wing and used as a carrier to input the information into it.The jade letter could only be read in a specific way, otherwise, it would be destroyed. It could be considered an encrypted letter.Li Ran activated his spiritual power and injected his spiritual power into the letter. A familiar voice rang out in his ears.It was his second uncle.First, he inquired about Li Ran about wellbeing, but what he said after that made Li Ran stunned.\u201cF-fianc\u00e9e\u2026?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27: Marriage Annulment!His Second Uncle mentioned in the letter that he actually had a fianc\u00e9e surnamed Xiao!\u201cWhy do I not know about this?\u201d He was dumbfounded.After carefully listening to the contents of the letter, he finally understood.The marriage contract was decided by the two family\u2019s elders. At that time, Li Ran was still young and no one told him about it.In the end, when he was eight years old, he had been chosen by the Youluo Temple and entered this top-tier sect. After that he became a renowned genius.The gap between the Li family and the Xiao family also grew larger. Coupled with the fact that the Youluo Temple prohibits marriage, there was no longer any mention of this marriage.This was the first time Li Ran even heard of it.His Second Uncle mentioned this in the letter.[Following the passing of the ancestor of the Xiao clan, the entire Xiao clan was shaken by the storm and had been reduced to a second-rate clan.Xiao Family\u2019s young miss had lost all her talent overnight. She was now an ordinary person.Their family suddenly mentioned the engagement. They wanted to hug our Li family\u2019s thighs and survive this calamity.The two families now were no longer in the same standing, so this engagement should be annulled.However, it was an agreement between the elders of the previous generation, so we couldn\u2019t deal with this matter too curtly. Ran\u2019er, you should go to the Xiao Family to personally annul the marriage.[With the existence of the Youlou Temple\u2019s prohibition, the Xiao Family wouldn\u2019t be able to say anything about it\u2026]Li Ran was speechless. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXiao Family, lost talent, marriage annulment\u2026. what the f*ck is this!But why did it seem that he had heard of this before somewhere?Thinking back carefully, he could indeed remember there was a little girl who he used to play with when they were small. However, ever since he entered the Youlou Temple, Li Ran had rarely returned home after so many years and they had never seen each other again.\u201cSect Master shouldn\u2019t know about this. With her jealous personality\u2026\u201d Li Ran shivered.Although this marriage annulment was the definition of hitting someone when they are down, it was the best solution.\u201cI need to find a chance to go down the mountain and annul this engagement,\u201d he made a decision.Before this matter could spread, it would be best to have it settled.\u2014It was almost noon when the deacon found him.\u201cSheng Zi, the Sect Master is summoning you to the Demon Peak.\u201d\u201c!!!\u201d Li Ran\u2019s brows twitched.Master summoned me? Did Master already know!\u201cSheng Zi?\u201d When the deacon saw that he did not react, she called him again.Li Ran returned to his senses. \u201cAlright, I got it.\u201dHe put away the letter and gave it to Aqin for safekeeping. He then headed to Demon Peak.\u2014Leng Wuyan paced through the palace with a nervous and expectant expression.Hearing the door being knocked, she hurriedly sat back in her chair and picked up a book.\u201cCome in.\u201dLi Ran pushed the door open and walked in front of her.\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m late. I made Master wait for a long time.\u201d He cupped his hands.Flying was forbidden within the main peak, so he could only walk.Leng Wuyan casually said, \u201cLong time? I\u2019ve been reading a book and didn\u2019t notice.\u201dAs she spoke, she turned a page.\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d Li Ran wanted to interject.\u201cWhat? If you have something to say, say it.\u201d\u201cYour book is upside down.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Cough cough !\u201dLeng Wuyan was a little embarrassed as she said stiffly, \u201cI like to read books upside down. Can\u2019t I do that?\u201d\u201cAs expected of my master. I admire you.\u201d Li Ran couldn\u2019t help but laugh.Leng Wuyan blushed.\u201cAlright, there\u2019s no one else here. Don\u2019t be so serious,\u201d Leng Wuyan said.Li Ran scratched his head. \u201cDoes that mean I\u2019m unserious in private?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think? Since you are serious, why did you dare confess to me before?\u201d Leng Wuyan said in an indescribable tone.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Li Ran\u2019s face turned red as he giggled awkwardly.Leng Wuyan rolled her eyes at him. \u201cSilly, come with me.\u201dThe two passed through the hall and arrived at the dining hall.Li Ran couldn\u2019 t help but be stunned when he saw a large table of rich delicacies. \u201cMaster, this is?\u201d\u201cSince I have nothing to do, I cooked. However, I accidentally cooked too much, so I called you to help me clean it up in order to not waste the food.\u201dLi Ran looked at the dishes on the table. Each dish was full of color and fragrance, and not a single mouthful was taken.How could she have accidentally cooked too much? It was clearly a feast prepared with her heart!\u201cWait, what did you say just now?\u201d Li Ran asked in shock, \u201cDid you cook these dishes yourself?\u201dIn his memory, Leng Wuyan was a master who never touched the pan and couldn\u2019t even recognize normal ingredients.\u201cOf course,\u201d she crossed her arms and spoke proudly.Li Ran sat down, picked up the silver chopsticks and placed a piece of Snow Eagle meat into his mouth.Wu!His eyes lit up.Leng Wuyan asked in anticipation, \u201cHow does it taste?\u201dLi Ran gave a thumbs up and said vaguely, \u201cIt\u2019s delicious! Master, your craftsmanship is too great!\u201dThis was not flattery. The taste of the dishes were indeed great.Although the dishes were not on the level of peak chefs, it was definitely at a high level.\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Leng Wuyan let out a sigh of relief. \u201cIt\u2019s not in vain for me to get up early this morning to learn how to cook.\u201dWith her innate talent and comprehension skill, no matter what kind of dish it was, she would be able to perfectly replicate it after reading the cookbook.In fact, she even managed to create many novel dishes.But even so, this large table of dishes took her four to five hours.Li Ran looked at her fair face and felt a slight stir in his heart.\u201cMaster, you are really kind to me.\u201dLeng Wuyan\u2019s face turned red as she turned her head and said, \u201cI\u2019m just using you to practice. It\u2019s not like I specifically made it for you. Why are you so cushy\u2026\u201dEven so, the sweetness in her eyes couldn\u2019t be turned away. Li Ran had long since gotten used to her arrogant personality. He pulled her to his side and made her sit down. \u201cMaster, let\u2019s eat together.\u201dLeng Wuyan felt his warm palm, and her heart began to beat faster. She let him pull her like a puppet and sat down dizzily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28: Leng Wuyan\u2019s DilemmaLeng Wuyan sat on his side, her right hand tightly held by Li Ran. Feeling the heat akin to a scorching furnace flame surging through their hands, blood gradually rushed onto her cheeks.This was their first, real skin contact.\u201cMaster, you should also eat.\u201d Li Ran continued eating the meal with one hand.Leng Wuyan stammered, \u201cYou, you\u2019re still holding me\u2026\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Only then did Li Ran react and quickly let her go. \u201cThis disciple is reckless!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Leng Wuyan turned her head and felt her heart flutter.Looking at the embarrassed Li Ran, a wave of unprecedented courage suddenly surged inside her. She took the initiative to put her delicate hand back into his palm and whispered, \u201cI can eat with my left hand\u2026\u201d\u201cMaster?\u201d Li Ran stared at her in a daze.Leng Wuyan was a little shy and angrily reprimanded, \u201cWhy are you staring at me? Hurry up and eat.\u201d\u201cThis disciple will obey!\u201d Li Ran saluted with his left hand.Pfft~The two of them looked at each other and smiled brightly.\u2014While eating, Leng Wuyan said, \u201cRan\u2019er, I\u2019m very curious about something\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cMaster, go ahead.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d rather die that day than to not confess to me. Just what do you like about me?\u201d Leng Wuyan said.She was a little embarrassed, and nervously looked at Li Ran.In Leng Wuyan\u2019s heart, she was cold and aloof. Her personality was old-fashioned, and she carried the name of a demoness. Logically speaking, no one in this world would like her.Li Ran put down his chopsticks and thought for a while before saying firmly, \u201cFace.\u201d\u201cFace??\u201d Leng Wuyan was stunned.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Li Ran said as a matter of fact. \u201cMaster\u2019s face is very pretty. Your face is rosy, your lips are like jade, and your eyes seem to be filled with boundless stars. I\u2019ve never seen anyone so beautiful before.\u201dLeng Wuyan was a little shy by his honeyed words, but she couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cOther than that?\u201d\u201cIn addition to your beautiful face, your figure is also perfect from top-to-bottom. The part that should be bountiful is bountiful; the part that should be thin is thin. It\u2019s not an understatement to say that you\u2019re perfect.\u201d\u201cIs it just appearance\u2026\u201d She had imagined countless answers, but she had never imagined that Li Ran\u2019s reply would be so superficial. For a moment, she didn\u2019t know whether to be happy or sad.\u201cUnder the beautiful face lies a skull. Under the perfect skin and figure lies a pile of white bones. Even an Emperor-level expert would not be able to live forever. This superficial appearance would eventually fade under the passage of time. At that time\u2026 would you still like me?\u201d Leng Wuyan pondered for a moment and decided to voice out her dilemma to Li Ran.\u201cOf course.\u201d Li Ran did not hesitate. \u201cPeople are visual animals. The reason Master attracted me was naturally because of your appearance. But if you are to ask what I liked most about Master\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you like most about me?\u201d Leng Wuyan asked.\u201cI like master\u2019s seriousness when master is conducting lessons, I like master\u2019s serenity when master is listening to music, I like master\u2019s loveliness when master is eating candy, and I like master\u2019s cuteness when master acts tough.\u201d\u201cIn my eyes, Master, you are both reliable and gentle. You are valiant and adorable. You are simply a perfect existence!\u201d Li Ran spoke without end.Although the confession that time was an accident, these words were his true feelings.\u201cDo I have that many advantages? Lovely?\u201d Leng Wuyan\u2019s face turned more rosy the more she listened. In the end, she almost buried herself under the table. Her heart was truly jubilant. \u201cI know, I know\u201dLi Ran raised his hand and smiled. \u201cOne more thing, Master\u2019s hand is really soft.\u201d\u201cNonsense\u2026\u201d Leng Wuyan was so shy that her ears were about to release smoke.\u201cI have one last question. Since we\u2019ve confirmed our relationship, why do you still call me Master?\u201d she whispered.This had been bothering her for a long time. They were already lovers, but him using honorifics with her would give her a feeling of estrangement from him.Li Ran scratched his head. \u201cI\u2019ve been calling you that for ten years, and I can\u2019t change it at a moment\u2019s notice\u2026 And don\u2019t you think that this kind of address is even more exciting for our relationship?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Leng Wuyan almost vomited blood.\u201cExciting your sister!\u201d She wanted to pry open Li Ran\u2019s brain and see what was inside.The dining hall once again fell silent.She was absentmindedly holding the plates when Li Ran suddenly broke the ice, \u201cYan\u2019er?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Leng Wuyan almost dropped her chopsticks as if she had been electrocuted.No one ever called her that before.Too embarrassing!Li Ran shrugged. \u201cI have already changed my address to you. It\u2019s your turn now.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Leng Wuyan calmed down and said curiously, \u201cDidn\u2019t I call you Ran\u2019er? That\u2019s a good name.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not right. I want you to change it to\u2026\u201d Li Ran whispered into her ear.\u201c!!!\u201d Leng Wuyan was so ashamed that she almost lifted the table.\u201cI-I can\u2019t call you that!\u201d She shook her head like a rattle-drum.\u201cAll right.\u201d Li Ran sighed, his expression was somewhat regretful.Leng Wuyan could not bear to see this. When she was just about to say something, her expression suddenly turned solemn.\u201cSomeone\u2019s coming.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s here?\u201d Li Ran was stunned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29: Trial? Leave it to me!When Sun Wei walked in, she couldn\u2019t help but be stunned when she saw the table full of rich food.\u201cI\u2019ve come to see the Sect Master. Apologies for disturbing your meal.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dSun Wei turned her gaze to Leng Wuyan\u2019s side. \u201cAh, Sheng Zi is also here!\u201d\u201cGreetings, Elder Sun.\u201d Li Ran replied with a nod.Although Sun Wei was the First Elder, Li Ran was also the sect\u2019s Sheng Zi. His was not a position other disciples could match up to. So he didn\u2019t need to get up and bow to her.Elder Sun had a strange feeling. Li Ran had been always present when she had come to see the Sect Master the last two times.In the past, she had never seen them interact so often.\u201cRight now, Sheng Zi should be cultivating. What are you doing here?\u201d Sun Wei asked.Before Li Ran could reply, Leng Wuyan took the lead and said, \u201cRan\u2019er has been extremely diligent recently and has advanced in cultivation quite quickly. I\u2019m worried that he might overdo it, so I called him over to rest.\u201dLi Ran could not hold back his laughter.Diligence? She must be talking about our relationship.With the existence of the Heaven Seizing Cultivation Method, I can just sleep every day!However, it was true that he had advanced quite quickly. Leng Wuyan shot him a glance displaying a caring smile on her face.\u201cOh?\u201d Sun Wei looked over and cried out in disbelief, \u201cSheng Zi is already at the last stage of the Golden Core realm?!\u201dLast time, he was still at the middle stage of the Golden Core realm. He had broken through in just a day or two?This cultivation speed was too shocking.Li Ran\u2019s expression remained calm. \u201cIt might be a coincidence.\u201dBefore that, he already reached the pinnacle of the middle stage Golden Core realm. With his formidable talent and Heaven Seizing Cultivation Method, breaking through to the late stage of the Golden Core realm was as simple as drinking water.\u201cYou entered the Golden Core realm at the age of seventeen, but it just took you a year to reach the late stage! This talent is truly terrifying!\u201d Sun Wei finally understood why Leng Wuyan was so close to Li Ran.With such a powerful talent, as long as he doesn\u2019t fall victim to an early death, he would definitely be a Master in the future!\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to Sect Master.\u201d As Li Ran spoke, he secretly pinched Leng Wuyan\u2019s hand under the table.Leng Wuyan bit her lip and tried to maintain her calm.This kid is too presumptuous!She wanted to break free, but she couldn\u2019t use any strength because of a kind of limp and numb feeling. Thinking that Elder Sun wouldn\u2019t be able to see it anyway, she just let it be.\u201cElder Sun, why did you come to see me?\u201d she asked aloud.\u201cEr\u2026 it\u2019s that,\u201d Sun Wei replied, \u201cThe sect trials are about to begin. We don\u2019t know who will lead the disciples this time, the elders in each peak all care about this matter tightly.\u201dSect trials. It was an important part of the cultivation of disciples in Youluo Temple.Every three years, the elders would arrange for the new disciples to go down Mount Xuanling and enter the Grand Myriad Mountains to explore and complete the missions assigned by the sect.Every time, they would arrange for a senior disciple to lead the team. Although they acted a bit like a nanny, it\u2019s the best way to discover a seedling with a good personality and aptitude, making it convenient for them to recruit these excellent seedlings.Therefore, the elders of the various peaks all watched this matter closely.Leng Wuyan waved her hand. \u201cElder Sun, you decide.\u201dObviously, she was not interested in this matter.\u201cAlright, then\u2026\u201dLi Ran suddenly said, \u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201d\u201cYou?\u201d Both of them looked at him in surprise.\u201cYou\u2019re the Sheng Zi, so you should focus on cultivation. You shouldn\u2019t worry about this.\u201d Sun Wei euphemistically refused him.Li Ran shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve been cultivating a little too much lately, so I\u2019ll take this opportunity to rest.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Sun Wei hesitated.\u201cBesides, I had never participated in a trial in the past ten years. As the Sheng Zi, I have to do something for the sect, right?\u201d Li Ran said.As he spoke, Elder Sun was helpless. \u201cThen let\u2019s just rely on the Sect Master\u2019s arrangements.\u201dLeng Wuyan gave him a serious look. \u201cAre you sure you want to lead the trial?\u201dLi Ran nodded. \u201cThis disciple is sure.\u201dIn fact, it wasn\u2019t because he wanted to take part in the trial, but to take the chance to sneak off to annul his engagement!\u201cAlright, I will accept that.\u201d\u2014When Elder Sun left, Leng Wuyan put down her chopsticks and remained silent.Li Ran gulped and said carefully, \u201cMaster, master\u2026\u201dLeng Wuyan ignored him.\u201cYan\u2019er?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cLittle cutie?\u201d\u03a3(\u2299\u25bd\u2299aLeng Wuyan couldn\u2019t hold back any longer, and she said in embarrassment and a resentful tone, \u201cYou\u2019re so shameless. I wonder if there is anything you wouldn\u2019t speak of with that brazen face of yours??\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re too cute. I can\u2019t help it,\u201d Li Ran continued his shamelessness.\u201cStop! Be honest, why did you suddenly want to lead the team down the mountain? You\u2019ve never been so diligent before!\u201d Leng Wuyan asked.Li Ran\u2019s eyes turned. \u201cI miss home.\u201d\u201cMiss home?\u201d\u201cThis disciple had cultivated for more than ten years here, and the number of times I had returned home was numbered. I want to take this opportunity to return\u2026 Master, you won\u2019t blame me, right?\u201d\u201cOf course not!\u201d Leng Wuyan was a little embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I misunderstood you just now. I thought you wanted to\u2026\u201d\u201cI want to what\u2026?\u201d Li Ran asked curiously.\u201cYou want to hide from me\u2026\u201d Her voice grew smaller and smaller.Li Ran laughed dumbly.His master was truly adorable. However, the more this happened, the stronger his guilt felt.Leng Wuyan believed him unconditionally, but he lied repeatedly\u2026\u201cBut, I can\u2019t really tell her about this matter!\u201d Li Ran was extremely helpless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30: My Master is truly sweet!\u201cThe trial will proceed for over a month. Plus, if you go home, won\u2019t I be away from Ran\u2019er for a long time?\u201d Leng Wuyan felt disappointed.Originally, with her cultivation, a closed-door cultivation session would take decades. This little period of time was just a flick of her finger.But now, she felt that one month was extremely long and arduous.Li Ran pinched her hand and said, \u201cI will definitely return as soon as possible. I\u2019m still looking forward to my second date with Master.\u201d\u201cHmph.\u00a0You cheeky brat, who wants to go on a date with you?\u201d Joy flashed across Leng Wuyan\u2019s eyes as she spoke. The gloom in her heart dissipated quite a bit.\u201cSigh,\u00a0the thought of not being able to see Master for such a long time made this disciple\u2019s heart ache\u2026 Maybe I shouldn\u2019t go?\u201d Li Ran sighed.\u201cAll right, there was no time for cultivation. It\u2019s just a short period of time for you and me. The days ahead are still long.\u201d Leng Wuyan comforted him instead.A trace of craftiness flashed through Li Ran\u2019s eyes as he turned his back to her and said, \u201cThen before I leave, can you satisfy this disciple\u2019s small wish?\u201dLeng Wuyan asked curiously, \u201cWish? Tell me?\u201dLi Ran cleared his throat. \u201cThe name I just mentioned to you. I really want to hear you say it.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Leng Wuyan was immediately at a loss for what to do. She said with a panicked expression, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t call you that!\u201d\u201cAll right\u2026\u201d Li Ran was filled with regret.Leng Wuyan looked at him and hesitated for a long time before she said in a low voice, \u201cIf I call you that, can you come back earlier?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Li Ran\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cI promise to finish up quickly!\u201d\u201cAll right\u2026\u201d Leng Wuyan covered her face and her voice was like a mosquito, \u201cH-husband~\u201dThrough her fingers, he could see her scarlet cheek. Before Li Ran could respond, her figure instantly disappeared. She was so bashful that she immediately fled.Li Ran sat in his chair in a daze. He hadn\u2019t recovered for a long time. He clutched his wildly beating heart and muttered, \u201cMy master is truly sweet\u2026\u201d\u2014Wuyang City.This was the imperial capital of the dynasty, the most prosperous city.At this moment, everyone gathered in front of the Dao Seeking Platform\u2019s hathpace, taking a glimpse at various immortals.Immortal Ascension Conference!This was the day that the mortal world was closest to the cultivation world. All the great clans would send out their most outstanding disciples to test their talent on the Dao Seeking Platform in order to obtain a chance to enter the sects.As for the various sects, they would continue to pay attention to them to avoid missing seedlings with good aptitude.Back then, the eight-year-old Li Ran talent was measured to be of the Saint grade, triggering the competition among the top sects.In the end, he was brought under the doors of Youlou Temple.At this moment, the deacon who presided over the meeting said, \u201cNow, the Xiao family\u2019s disciples will get on the stage to be examined.\u201dA group of young men and women walked up. The youngest of them was only six or seven years old.In the order listed, they touched the stone.\u201cXiao Feng, inferior talent.Xiao Yun, inferior talent.Xiao San, mid-grade talent.\u201d\u2026Up to the last person, the best was just a mid-grade talent. It could be said that it was extremely miserable.The girl at the end of the line took a deep breath and placed her right hand on the stone. After a while, there was no reaction.The deacon said loudly, \u201cXiao Qingge, no cultivation talent!\u201dShe withdrew her hand and lowered her eyes.\u201cAs expected, no miracle has happened\u2026 My talent has really disappeared\u2026\u201dIt was not her first time participating in the Immortal Ascension Conference. When she was young, it was discovered that she had a super-grade talent. Although it was a bit inferior to Li Ran, it was still a once in a hundred years talent.On the spot, she was accepted by the Supreme Dao Palace as a direct disciple at the age of ten. She reached Foundation Establishment at the age of fifteen. At the age of eighteen, she had already reached the Golden Core realm.Her cultivation speed was so fast that she was only beneath Li Ran, who was known as the reincarnation of an immortal emperor.In addition to being renowned in the city, she was also known as \u201cFairy Qing\u201d throughout the whole world and had various followers.If nothing unexpected happened, she would become an expert and lead the Xiao family to prosperity. However, all of this had changed not long ago.Half a month ago, her cultivation suddenly disappeared, and ten years of painstaking cultivation turned to nothing.Even her original super-grade talent had become the worst \u2018no talent\u2019. The sects and clans tried everything they could to find a solution.In the end, it could only be attributed to \u201cThe Heavens Will\u201d. She didn\u2019t even have the qualifications to be a servant in the sect.After confirming that she could not recover, she was expelled by the Supreme Dao Palace. How high she flew back then, and how miserable she felt now.Everyone looked at the stage, discussing spiritedly.\u201cF*ck, I didn\u2019t expect Xiao Qingge\u2019s talent to really disappear?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I thought it was a rumor, but this time, it hit like a stone hammer!\u201d\u201cMy god. After consuming so many resources, she turned into a cripple. This time, the Xiao family has lost a lot!\u201d\u201cI heard that she had been expelled from the Supreme Dao Palace\u2026\u201d\u201cNot only that, even the Li Family is clamoring for an engagement annulment!\u201d\u201cThe Xiao Family and the Li Family have an engagement? Why haven\u2019t I heard of this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a long story. It was\u2026\u201dXiao Qingge walked down the Dao Seeking Platform and quietly passed through the crowd, turning a deaf ear to all the commotion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31: Li Ran\u2019s Shadow!This was an annual gathering, where all the great clans of Wuyang City gathered.Xiao Qingge was once again an influential figure. For a moment, all eyes turned to her.There were sighs, banter, greed, and coveting gazes\u2026Once upon a time, she was a fairy of exceptional beauty and hope. Now that this immortal fortune had been completely lost and fallen into the mortal world, it naturally attracted many people\u2019s attention.\u201cXiao Qingge? I did not expect that you would really come.\u201d A young man with a vain expression stood in front of her with a playful smile on his face.It was Li Sheng, Li Ran\u2019s cousin. A superior-grade talent, and an Inner Sect Disciple.\u201cAlthough the Supreme Dao Palace had already released the news, your Xiao family had never come forward to admit it. Now that you\u2019ve come to the Immortal Ascension Conference, aren\u2019t you announcing to the world that you, Xiao Qingge, are crippled?\u201d Li Sheng emphasized the word \u201ccripple\u201d, making sure that everyone could hear it.Xiao Qingge was expressionless as she turned to leave.\u201cAre you mad? Still acting cold? I thought that you were the Fairy Qing?\u201d A trace of displeasure flashed through Li Sheng\u2019s eyes as he reached out and grabbed her arm.Xiao Qingge frowned.Pain!This grip almost crushed her bones. The strength of a mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator wasn\u2019t something a mere mortal could bear.On the other hand, the disciples of the Xiao family turned a blind eye to this. They all looked elsewhere as if they did not know her.Her family was in this state. They were totally cold towards her, anyone could see it!Li Sheng couldn\u2019t help but feel even more proud.\u201cLosing cultivation and being expelled by the sect\u2026 Not to mention, your Xiao family actually wants to marry into my Li family?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t even have an old ancestor to watch over your family, yet you wanted to marry into my Li family? What a joke!\u201d\u201cAs far as I know, the matter of marriage annulment has come to an end. You better think about what other uses you have left!\u201dXiao Qingge said coldly, \u201cLet go.\u201d\u201cAiyo,\u00a0I\u2019m so scared!\u201d Li Sheng sized her up and smiled wickedly. \u201cLook at how pretty you are. Why don\u2019t you be my human cauldron*? I\u2019ll keep you safe!\u201d[TL/N: Again, a euphemism for sex slave]\u201cDo you think you deserve me?\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?!\u201d Li Sheng suspected that he had misheard.Xiao Qingge raised her head and coldly stared at him. \u201cAs long as the engagement isn\u2019t annulled, I am Li Ran\u2019s fianc\u00e9e! Have you considered the consequences?\u201d\u201cLi Ran?\u201d When Li Sheng heard this name, his body couldn\u2019t help but tremble. A trace of fear flashed across his eyes.\u201cYou, who are you scaring\u2026\u201d\u201cLet go.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Li Sheng looked at her with calm eyes, and he suddenly felt a little shocked. He involuntarily released his grip on her.\u201cThat\u2019s right, I lost my cultivation and became a mortal. That\u2019s right!\u201d Then, she turned around and left.Li Sheng panted heavily, his face turning red and white, veins popping out on his forehead.These words deeply pierced into his weakness. Under Li Ran\u2019s shadow, he would never be able to lift his head!\u201cXiao Qingge, when the Li family annuls the engagement, I will definitely make you pay the price!\u201d His eyes were filled with ferocity.\u2014Xiao Qingge returned home and locked herself in her room. Her entire body seemed to have been emptied out in an instant. She sat on the chair feebly, her eyes filled with confusion.No matter how strong she was, she was only a teenage girl. The sudden fall from the clouds to hell wasn\u2019t something she could bear.Thump thump thump.Someone was knocking at the door.She restrained her expression and stood up to open the door.Outside the door stood a burly man. It was the head of the Xiao family, her biological father, Xiao Nian.\u201cQingge.\u201d\u201cFather.\u201d Xiao Qingge lowered her head, not daring to look at him.Xiao Nian sighed helplessly. \u201cGo on and tell me.\u201dXiao Nian set up a soundproof formation and then said aloud, \u201cQingge, you shouldn\u2019t have gone to the Immortal Ascension Conference. This will only make things worse.\u201dXiao Qingge shook her head and said, \u201cThe Supreme Dao Palace has already released this news. This matter can not be hidden\u2026 And I want to try again\u2026\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Xiao Nian sighed and said, \u201cEver since the death of the old ancestor, the Xiao family is like a candle in the wind. There are tigers and wolves in Wuyang City. I\u2019m only worried that I can\u2019t protect you!\u201d\u201cThis daughter\u2019s incompetence has made father worry.\u201d Xiao Qingge whispered.\u201cIf we can get the support of the Li family, everything will turn around. Unfortunately\u2026\u201d Xiao Nian shook his head.With Xiao family\u2019s current state, it was almost certain that the marriage would be annulled.\u201cQingge, is it really impossible for you and Li Ran?\u201d Xiao Nian could not help but ask.\u201cLi Ran?\u201d Xiao Qingge\u2019s eyes were confused. The appearance of a young boy flashed through her mind.Playmates from childhood, agreements under the tree, parents\u2019 orders, words of matchmaker\u2026She had been willing!\u201cIt\u2019s impossible.\u201d Xiao Qingge bit her lip. \u201cLi Ran is the Sheng Zi of Youluo Temple. The sect prohibits marriage. Even if he doesn\u2019t annul the marriage, the marriage still could not proceed.\u201dSigh\u2026Xiao Nian\u2019s heart was filled with helplessness.Li Ran was the only solution that could turn around their situation. Only if he stepped forward could Xiao Qingge be completely protected.With Xiao Qingge\u2019s personality, she would rather swallow a broken tooth*.

    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32: Leng Wuyan\u2019s Letter!You Lou Temple. Main peak.A group of young disciples was gathered at this place. Most of them were new disciples who had just entered the sect, and some of them were those who had missed the previous trial.They were both nervous and excited about the upcoming trial.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that the Grand Myriad Mountain Range is extremely terrifying, and the mountain is occupied by countless fiendish demons. It\u2019s a forbidden area for humans!\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t those little rookies going to the demon\u2019s plate?\u201d\u201cThe sect won\u2019t let us die. The trial\u2019s just outside the Hundred Thousand Mountains. It\u2019s not that dangerous.\u201d\u201cAlso, Senior Brother is here. What are you all panicking about?\u201d\u201cI wonder which senior brother will be leading us this time. I hope he\u2019s a handsome man. I\u2019ll be in a good mood for this kind of trial.\u201d\u201cHandsome addict\u2026\u201d\u2014Hearing the disciples\u2019 discussions, Lu Xinran sighed and frowned.She was also on the trial team.She, who had the cultivation at the early Foundation Establishment realm, was teamed up with these Qi Refining Practitioners.Her status had changed from the Inner Sect Junior Sister to the Senior Sister. However, she was not happy at all. The thought of not being able to see Sheng Zi for a long time caused her heartache.\u201cSigh,\u00a0I\u2019m still planning on making Plum Cake for Sheng Zi. Looks like I\u2019ll have to wait until I return.\u201d In her heart, cultivation was only ranked second\u2026Suddenly, the clamorous discussions stopped.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lu Xinran raised her head blankly and saw a white-robed figure floating down.Her mouth opened slightly, her eyes filled with disbelief. \u201cSheng\u2026 Sheng Zi?!\u201dLi Ran landed in the middle of the arena. He excluded a handsome and heroic aura.He looked around and indifferently said, \u201cI am the leader of this team.\u201d\u201cMy mission is to ensure the safety of your lives.As for whether you lose arms or have broken legs, that has nothing to do with me.Therefore, my only request to everyone is to\u2026\u2026Stay alive!We have to gather at the teleportation portal in an hour. Those who arrive late will be sentenced to death!\u201d Li Ran\u2019s words were brief and concise. After he finished speaking, he flew into the air.The young disciples were quiet for a moment before they went into turmoil.\u201cWhich senior brother is this? He\u2019s too handsome!\u201d\u201cEspecially that cold demeanor. He\u2019s simply too cool!\u201d\u201cI love him!\u201d The female disciples looked at his departing figure with starry eyes.Most of them were outer sect disciples. Normally, they wouldn\u2019t be able to converse with Li Ran, so they naturally couldn\u2019t recognize him.\u201cYou all don\u2019t know who he is? He is the sect\u2019s Sheng Zi, Li Ran!\u201d A disciple spoke out.\u201cSheng Zi?\u201d\u201cIs he the Sheng Zi Li Ran?\u201d\u201cOh my god!\u201d Everyone looked at each other.He was a legendary figure.This is just a small trial, yet the trial is led by Sheng Zi himself? Isn\u2019t this too exaggerated!Lu Xinran was so excited that she almost jumped up. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that I would be able to participate in the trial with Sheng Zi. My luck is too good!\u201d\u2014Li Ran returned to his residence.Aqin knew of the trial and helped him pack his bags.Due to her not being a disciple of Youluo Temple, she couldn\u2019t accompany him during this trial.\u201cLord Sheng Zi, this is your replacement clothes during the trial. If you get dirty, you can change into them.\u201d\u201cThese are food for your trip. They are your favorite dishes, and they won\u2019t rot in your storage ring.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201dLi Ran didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cAll right, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to war. It\u2019s just an ordinary trial. I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d\u201cYes, Aqin will work hard to cultivate and wait for Sheng Zi\u2019s return,\u201d she said seriously.\u201cBe good.\u201d Li Ran rubbed her little head.Aqin narrowed her eyes, her expression showed that she was enjoying his touch.\u201cAqin is already at the mid-stage of Qi Refining. According to the Mysterious Light Sutra, as long as Aqin reaches the Foundation Establishment Realm, Aqin would be able to cultivate with Lord Sheng Zi\u2026\u00a0Wu!\u201dLi Ran covered her mouth. \u201cApart from cultivating with me, can you pursue something else?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Aqin\u2019s eyes were black and white as she blinked innocently.Li Ran was speechless. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cForget it. You can continue cheering.\u201d\u201cWu!\u201d After dealing with Aqin, Li Ran walked out of the room.He looked at the towering Demon Peak. Ever since the last time Leng Wuyan had fled from embarrassment, she had never shown her face again. He had been told that the sect master was not present at her bedchamber.\u201cCould it be that Master is angry with me? She shouldn\u2019t be. The last time we met was fine.\u201d Li Ran pinched his chin.Inwardly, he felt a little hopeless.At this moment, a female disciple quickly walked up to him.\u201cSheng Zi.\u201d\u201cDeacon Wang? Are you looking for me?\u201d Li Ran asked.Deacon Wang nodded and reached out to hand over a letter. \u201cThis is what Sect Master told me to give you before you leave.\u201d\u201cLetter?\u201d Li Ran was stunned for a moment before asking, \u201cOther than this, did the sect master say anything else?\u201dDeacon Wang shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dWhen Deacon Wang had left, Li Ran poured his Qi into the letter.Leng Wuyan\u2019s cold voice rang in his ears:[Ran\u2019er, I\u2019m going to the southern border. I have something important to deal with, so I can\u2019t personally send you off.Be safe and come back early.I will give you a pleasant surprise upon your return\u2026Once you go outside, you should protect yourself. You are not allowed to touch flowers and stir weeds, or I would ignore you\u2026Remember to think about me every day\u2026 ]The more she spoke, the smaller her voice became. In the end, he almost couldn\u2019t hear her voice.Li Ran could even imagine how shy she was when she recorded this letter.Who could withstand this? Even I, the recipient, am getting diabetes from it!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33: The trial begins!Grand Myriad Mountain Range.The area was located in the extreme south of the vast land, filled with countless mountains and treacherous waters occupied by demons and evil spirits.The deeper one went, the more terrifying the creatures living there became. It was a location listed as a forbidding area for humans.Even an immortal elder with profound cultivation wouldn\u2019t dare to enter the deeper regions, only tread around the outer reaches himself.\u2014\u201cAttack!\u201d\u201cYouluo Heart Art Shadow Killing Formation!\u201d\u201cBe careful from behind!\u201d\u201cForm a formation! Quickly form a formation!\u201dThe group from Youluo Temple had just entered the Grand Myriad Mountain Range when they were attacked by demonic beasts.It was a massive, colorful, sharp-toothed tiger. Its body was as tall as a bull. A pair of enormous fangs bared out of its gaping mouth, its tail waving behind it like a menacing steel whip.The Sharp-toothed Tiger\u2019s strength was equivalent to a cultivator at the middle to late-Qi Refining Realm.Unlike normal tigers, they aren\u2019t solitary but like to work together in packs.This behavior caused a great deal of trouble for the Youluo Temple disciples. In the beginning, they managed to work together to kill a few tigers, but soon enough the pack managed to scatter them. Under the constant frenzied attacks by the demon beasts, they barely endured.Li Ran laid on his flying sword and lazily yawned.He was there to lead the trial not to work as a nanny. He wouldn\u2019t bother to interfere unless someone was about to die.\u201cOh?\u201d Observing the battlefield, a petite figure attracted his attention.Lu Xinran was gliding through the beasts as fast as a ghost. The sharp-toothed Tigers\u2019 slow movement was utterly unable to harm her at all.Instead, she inflicted terrifying wounds on their bodies while passing them.In just three breaths of time, she easily finished one of the beasts off.\u201cGood. You\u2019ve grown a lot more than before.\u201d Li Ran nodded.Even though Lu Xinran\u2019s battle talent proved to be formidable, this advantage didn\u2019t hold for long. The demonic tigers quickly noticed this troublesome adversary and made her their main focus. The five remaining beasts roared madly, their ferocity covering the heavens.She immediately felt threatened. Transforming her shadow into a shield, she managed to block four of the creatures\u2019 attacks but the last managed to break through her defenses.Roar!The beast\u2019s red eyes filled with greed as it opened its bloody mouth and rushed at her. Its foul-smelling saliva almost dripped onto her body.\u201cIt\u2019s over!\u201d Lu Xinran was terrified.It was already too late to use any techniques.Just as the tiger was about to bite down on her, a flower appeared in front of her revealing a tall figure standing between her and the beast.\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Come here.\u201d Following the indifferent voice, the tiger instantly exploded into a rain of blood.Li Ran\u2019s entire body was covered in silver light. Like a meteor that appeared in the morning sky, he swept into the group of demon beasts,Roar!Accompanied by an ear-piercing howl, all the demonic tigers were torn apart by silver light in a few short breaths.A red shimmer spread out and blood and gore flew everywhere. The tragic scene appeared similar to a painting of hell itself!Hovering above the carnage Li Ran\u2019s white robes and black hair fluttered in the soft breeze. There was not even a trace of blood anywhere on his body.Upon the sudden change, many of the disciples stared blankly, unable to return to their senses for a long timeSeeing that quite a few disciples had already lost their lives, Li Ran said indifferently, \u201cEveryone, check your injuries, treat them, and we\u2019ll leave in an hour.\u201dAfterward, he leaped back onto the flying sword and lazily basked in the sun.Lu Xinran was the first to react. She looked at him gratefully before organizing the disciples to regroup.\u201cSheng Zi is so handsome!\u201d\u201cOne thing to say is that he is truly handsome!\u201d\u201cDid you see him clearly? In that instant, all the demonic tigers died!\u201d\u201cToo powerful!\u201d\u201cSheng Zi isn\u2019t as cold as the rumors say~\u201dThe disciples looked up to Li Ran and discussed in a low voice.A male disciple covered his bleeding arm and snorted, \u201cIn order to be handsome, he waited until the last moment to attack! If he got rid of the demon beasts earlier, we wouldn\u2019t have suffered like this!\u201dClearly, he was dissatisfied.Lu Xinran gave him a cold look. \u201cDo you think you\u2019re here to travel? This is a real battle. In a real battle, casualties are unavoidable!\u201cIf Sheng Zi clears all obstacles, what is the point of this trial?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d The male disciple still wanted to quibble.\u201cSheng Zi saved our lives, so we should be grateful. If I hear this again, I\u2019ll make you leave the trial!\u201d Lu Xinran\u2019s attitude was unyielding to the extreme.The others also cast unfriendly gazes. The male disciple shook his head and did not dare to speak again.\u2014Waiting for the disciples to wrap up their wounds and gather the demon bones needed for the mission, the team continued to set off.Li Ran followed behind unhurriedly.\u201cSheng Zi!\u201d Lu Xinran approached him, holding a red fruit in her tender hand.\u201cThis is the Cloud Spirit Fruit. Eat it to quench your thirst.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not thirsty.\u201d Li Ran did not raise his eyelids.\u201cAlright\u2026\u201d Lu Xinran said seriously, \u201cThank you for saving me. Otherwise, I would\u2019ve really died there.\u201dLi Ran said indifferently, \u201cNo need. This is the responsibility of the leader.\u201d\u201cHeh heh, actually, I know that although Sheng Zi looks cold, Sheng Zi\u2019s actually a very warm person,\u201d Lu Xinran said with a red face.\u201cAh?\u201d Li Ran was stunned.\u201cYou only attacked at the end to allow us to increase our actual combat experience, right? I\u2019m sure of it!\u201d Lu Xinran clenched her pink fist and said firmly, \u201cWe will definitely support you. We will live up to your expectations!\u201dLi Ran was momentarily speechless. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWho has expectations from you? Did this chick misunderstand something?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34: A Proud Genius and A Poor Girl!Li Ran was a very lazy person. His motto in life was:\u00a0Be lenient to yourself and be strict with others.Not only did he not have any expectations from these rookies, he even felt that they were troublesome. As a result, he made them fight the entire time. He was not even bothered to take action until they were pushed to a dead end.However, in the eyes of the new disciples, this irresponsible attitude had turned into the assumption that he was making them do the painstaking effort to \u201crefine their combat experience\u201d.\u2014On the seventh day of the trial.Because of Li Ran\u2019s cultivation, there were more and more disciples hanging on the thread. Everyone was more or else injured, nonetheless, they made great progress.Their eyes became firm. Their combat ability had improved qualitatively, and their teamwork became more and more tacit.There were even three people who had directly broken through to the late-stage of Qi Refining Realm.All of this was credited to Li Ran.\u201cKill!\u201d The last demon beast fell into a pool of blood.The surrounding demon beasts were not very strong. They were basically at the Qi Refining Realm.As long as the scale of the beast group wasn\u2019t too large, the disciples of Youluo Temple would be able to handle beasts on their own.\u201cSheng Zi, the sky is about to darken. Why don\u2019t we set up camp at the water source and rest for the night?\u201d Lu Xinran ran over and asked.Li Ran stretched out his waist. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. Then, let\u2019s rest.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The disciples quickly set up camp by the lake.Everyone lit a bonfire and gathered together to eat roast meat. Only Li Ran sat alone on the treetops, his back looking extremely distant.\u201cSheng Zi, you\u2019re so cold. You\u2019ve never eaten with us,\u201d a female disciple said.Lu Xinran shook his head. \u201cYou guys don\u2019t understand. Under the cold and aloof appearance of Sheng Zi lies a warm heart. He\u2019s just not good at communicating with people. Think back to the beginning\u2026\u201dShe explained what Li Ran did to help her breakthrough.\u201cWow, Sheng Zi is so warm~\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Even though he looks like he dislikes us, he\u2019s helping us all the time!\u201d\u201cIt turns out that his disdainful eyes are filled with love!\u201d\u201cThis is how geniuses are. They are not good at communicating with others!\u201d\u201cThinking about it like this, Sheng Zi is so cute~\u201d\u2014After everyone\u2019s brain tinkered, Li Ran turned from a cold and distant genius to a warm-hearted genius.At this moment, he was sitting on the top of the tree, happily eating the snow fluffy pellets. This was a delicacy carefully prepared by Aqin. It was much more delicious than the roast meat that did not even have any seasoning\u2026\u201cSheng Zi, come down and eat with us!\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t starve yourself to death!\u201d The female disciples cried out in pain.Li Ran refused without hesitation.\u00a0Want to eat my little pellets? No chance!\u2014Whoosh~Xiao Qingge panted heavily as she staggered through the dense forest. Blood oozed from the corner of her mouth, and her body was covered in wounds. Her clothes had long since been torn apart by the branches.This was the fifth day she had entered the Grand Myriad Mountain Range. Along the way, she followed the map and tried her best to avoid the places where the demon beasts were.Even so, she still got in danger. There were many times she had crossed the death\u2019s door.If it wasn\u2019t for her astonishing willpower, she would\u2019ve been buried long ago.\u201cBecause I don\u2019t have a cultivation base, I can\u2019t use my storage ring\u2026 I have already eaten all the dry rations, but I am still dozens of kilometers away from the secret realm\u2026\u201d Xiao Qingge\u2019s face was pale.A few days ago, she unexpectedly learned that there was a secret realm opening in the depths of the Hundred Thousand Mountains. Rumors had it that the Ancient Immortal Emperor\u2019s Inheritance resided there.Her intuition told her that this was her only chance to turn her fate around. Therefore, she did not hesitate to disobey her father\u2019s orders, secretly stole the map, and entered the Hundred Thousand Mountains. All for the sake of finding that wisp of illusory immortal destiny.However, before she could even see the shadow of the secret realm, she was on the verge of dying.\u201cIf I can\u2019t obtain this strand of immortal destiny, all that\u2019s waiting for me is a nightmare\u2026 I definitely can\u2019t give up!\u201cEven if I die, I will still die on the Immortal Path!\u201d Xiao Qingge\u2019s eyes gradually became firm.Just as she was about to move, the ground suddenly trembled violently.Boom!The trees from afar collapsed.Her expression changed.\u201cNot good, it\u2019s coming in my direction!\u201d Xiao Qingge didn\u2019t dare to stop. She ran wildly, but the trees in front of her couldn\u2019t raise her speed.The distance between the demon beast and her was rapidly closing.Boom!A huge monster smashed into her, and a huge shockwave almost sent her flying. A large number of shadows covered the sky!Xiao Qingge raised her head, her face filled with disbelief and terror!A demonic black bear!At this moment, it stood on both feet. The dark and shiny body of the bear was nearly ten meters long, and its bloodshot eyes stared at her as drool slid down the corner of its mouth.\u201cA demonic bear with such size?!\u201d Xiao Qingge\u2019s eyes were filled with despair. Even if she still had her cultivation, she was probably not a match for this monster.At this moment, she suddenly noticed that there seemed to be a stream of water flowing nearby.Instantly, her mind trembled!If she could jump into the river and sink along with the water source, perhaps there would still be a slim chance of survival.No longer hesitating, she turned around and ran towards the water source.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35: A bear fell down from the sky?Li Ran drank his fill and was just about to sleep. Suddenly, a violent vibration came, almost knocking him down from the tree branch.\u201cAn earthquake?\u201d He looked up in confusion and was stunned.One could only see a nearly ten-meter-tall bear running in his direction. The tall trees in front of it were easily pushed down like toys.In front of Black Bear, a woman was running away from it.As she ran, she waved her hand and shouted, \u201cRun, get out of here!\u201dLi Ran was speechless. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen a person sat at home, a bear fell down from the sky?The disciples of the Youlou Temple woke up and instantly became alert. During this time, they maintained a high level of vigilance. However, when they saw the crazy black bear in front of them, their legs became weak.This bear was too big.How powerful would they have to be to defeat such an enormous monster?\u2014A trace of bitterness flashed through Xiao Qingge\u2019s eyes.She originally wanted to find a source of water so that she could hide in it and avoid the Demonic Black Bear\u2019s chase.However, what she didn\u2019t expect was that there was a group of people setting up camp near the water source.Her first reaction would be:\u00a0I am leading them to death!This Demonic Black Bear had at least a Foundation Establishment cultivation base. Coupled with its powerful physical body, even a Golden Core expert would be terrified!What\u2019s more to say about this group of young men and women?\u201cI originally wanted to live, but I never imagined that I would commit murder before I die\u2026\u201d Xiao Qingge clenched her silver teeth and decided in her heart.\u2014Li Ran stared at the young girl and the black bear, his eyes cold and calm.What\u2019s with this woman? A harbinger of disaster? Want to kill the bear with a borrowed knife*? How about\u2026 I just kill the woman and the bear?[TLN: To kill with a borrowed knife \u2013 To attack using other\u2019s strength when one\u2019s strength is not sufficient.]Just as Li Ran was thinking, the girl in front of him made an incomprehensible move.She let out a soft shout,\u201d Run!\u201dThen, she stopped and turned to face the Demonic Black Bear and spread out her arms.This action was undoubtedly suicidal. She wanted to use her life to buy Li Ran and the others time to escape!However, the truth was not as she had hoped. In the eyes of the Demonic Black Bear, the temptation of one dish and a table full of dishes were far too different.This group of disciples from Youluo Temple who suddenly appeared had far more attraction to it than Xiao Qingge alone.Roar!The Demonic Black Bear pumped its thick thighs and howled as it rushed towards the crowd.\u201cNo!\u201d A trace of anxiety flashed through Xiao Qingge\u2019s eyes. She really couldn\u2019t bear to see others die because of her!However, without a cultivation base, she could only helplessly watch. She couldn\u2019t do anything.Roar!The enormous bear\u2019s palm covered the heavens and the earth as it fiercely slapped towards the crowd!The Youlou Temple\u2019s disciples\u2019 eyes were filled with despair.Suddenly, a dazzling white light flashed, and bright red blood splattered everywhere!Amidst the rain of blood, Li Ran held a silver spear as his clothes fluttered along with the wind.The Demonic Black Bear\u2019s paw was cut off, and blood sprayed freely.Roar! Roar!The intense pain caused it to go crazy, destroying a large number of trees.Li Ran\u2019s voice was calm as he passed through the mess. \u201cHide well. I\u2019m not responsible for your death.\u201dIn front of the Demonic Black Bear, his back appeared small, yet in the disciple\u2019s eyes, it was extremely majestic!\u201cYou must be careful!\u201d Lu Xinran said worriedly.\u2014The Demonic Black Bear was heavily injured, and its eyes that were filled with bloodlust and tyranny stared at him.It raised its other hand and slapped Li Ran at lightning speed.Boom!With a loud bang, a huge crater appeared on the ground. The Demonic Black Bear raised its hand with a sinister smile, but the other party did not turn into mush as it had imagined.It tilted its head in confusion, only to see a tiny figure leap from the crater, emanating a silver aura that dazzled the surrounding.The Demonic Black Bear instinctively stretched out its hand and grabbed the dazzling figure. A wave of intense pain filled its palm. The white light pierced through its palm, and the figure shone like a meteor in its eyes.\u201cWhite Rainbow Across the Sun!\u201dPuchi!The silver spear pierced into the bear\u2019s eyes, blood and muddy liquid splashing out from its eyes.Roar! Roar!The intense pain caused the Demonic Black Bear to lose its rationality.The bear became rampant as it furiously swung its palm towards Li Ran.However, Li Ran\u2019s figure instantly disappeared, making the Demonic Black Bear\u2019s powerful palm landed on its face.The boundless palm force crushed the Bear Demon\u2019s face, and it staggered back two steps, roaring and faltering.Li Ran\u2019s body soared into the air, his silver spear buzzing.The Demonic Black Bear\u2019s remaining scarlet eyes stared fixedly at him. A wave of fluctuations omitted from its palm, and the palm instantly grew several times in size.The huge black palm that was akin to a small mountain crushed down, causing an air pressure that blew the surrounding trees away.This palm that contained all the might of the Demonic Black Bear was ready to crush the air, making one feel hopeless and powerless to resist.Even a Golden Core cultivator couldn\u2019t afford to take this palm strike!\u201cNo!\u201d Lu Xinran\u2019s voice was miserable.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d Xiao Qingge\u2019s heart clenched tightly, her pale face filled with remorse.Seeing that the bear\u2019s palm was about to strike him, Li Ran\u2019s right hand released a silver light.The might of the Demon Thrashing Fist madly surged into the Yunling Spear.His right hand held the spear shaft. His figure, which was suspended in the air, spun the spear down from top to bottom.\u201cDie!\u201dSilver light tore through the sky, and the spear intent that strived to destroy everything came into existence, cutting everything that contested with it into two.The Demonic Black Bear stood there dazedly. The entire place fell silent, and time seemed to have stopped.Li Ran landed softly on the ground.Crack!A line of blood appeared on the Demonic Black Bear\u2019s massive body.The bear\u2019s stunned eyes slowly split into two. Blood gushed out like a waterfall, and its body collapsed on both sides, overwhelming countless trees.The fiendish demon that had just been insufferably arrogant was split in two by a single strike.Li Ran brushed off the bloodstains on his spear and said indifferently, \u201cWe\u2019ll have roasted black bear as our midnight snack. Any objections?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36: Xiao Qingge\u2019s Offer!The place became silent.Everyone stared blankly at this scene, unable to return to their senses for a long time.Such a terrifying Demonic Bear died so easily?With the bear\u2019s strength, their attacks were no different from scratching its back.However, its body was split open by Li Ran\u2019s spear!This couldn\u2019t be a dream, right?On the other hand, the huge corpses on the ground surged with blood like a fountain, and the trees around it collapsed randomly\u2026All of this affirmed everyone on what had just happened.Xiao Qingge looked at Li Ran, whose clothes were still snow-white, and her throat tightened.Compared to the Demonic Bear, this man was a monster.Li Ran picked up the Yunling Spear and the white light in his palm quietly disappeared.This Demonic Bear was very strong.An ordinary technique would not be able to pierce through its defenses. Moreover, even a Golden Core expert wouldn\u2019t dare to take on its powerful palm.Outside the Hundred Thousand Mountains, it was an expert.Unfortunately, it encountered Li Ran.The Demon Thrashing Fist suppresses all demons and evil spirits. Furthermore, Yunling spear technique was extremely sharp and unyielding.The bear was pierced to death.\u2014The disciples of Youluo Temple were the first to react, praising Li Ran.\u201cSheng Zi is too strong!\u201d\u201cI almost peed in fear just now!\u201d\u201cThat Demonic Bear was split open!\u201d\u201cSheng Zi is the best!\u201d\u201cIs this the strongest genius in the vast lands? I am in love!\u201d\u2014Their faces were filled with joy for surviving the calamity.They looked at Li Ran with admiration.If nothing unexpected happened, this group of disciples would become his hardcore fans\u2026\u201cSheng Zi!\u201d Lu Xinran plunged into his embrace, her delicate body slightly trembling.\u201cThat was so scary. I was so worried about you.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Lu Xinran cried as she scratched his chest with her right hand.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d The corner of Li Ran\u2019s mouth trembled.\u201cAren\u2019t you taking advantage of the situation?\u201dLi Ran grabbed her by the collar, lifted her, and sent her flying.Lu Xinran:\u250c(.\u0434.)\u2510\u2014Xiao Qingge listened to their cheers and finally landed. She walked over to the crowd and bowed deeply.\u201cI was attacked by a Demonic Bear, and I ran to this place in a panic, but I caused you to fall into danger\u2026 I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Her words were filled with an apology tone.She caused this entire situation herself.Even if she was a mortal now, she would not escape her responsibility. However, the disciples of Youluo Temple did not blame her. Her suicidal behavior had won many people\u2019s hearts.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. It\u2019s all over.\u201d\u201cMiss, you didn\u2019t do it on purpose.\u201d\u201cWith Sheng Zi here, there will be no danger!\u201d\u201cMiss, are you alright?\u201dThis group of disciples who had not been involved in the world comforted her.\u201cSheng Zi?\u201d Xiao Qingge looked at Li Ran who was studying how to skin the bear. A trace of curiosity flashed through her eyes.\u201cThese people should be disciples of the sect, and he is the Sheng Zi of the sect\u2026 I wonder which great sect they\u2019re from. They\u2019re really strong!\u201dThat dazzling spear was firmly imprinted in her mind.Xiao Qingge walked to Li Ran\u2019s side and bowed. \u201cThank you for your help, senior. If it wasn\u2019t for you, I would already be in the stomach of the bear!\u201d Although this person looked young, who knew if he was an old senior who coveted beauty?Xiao Qingge didn\u2019t dare bring much attention.Li Ran glanced at her and frowned. \u201cMortal?\u201dShe didn\u2019t have any spirit fluctuations on her body. It was impossible for her to be a cultivator.As a mortal, she dared to enter the Grand Myriad Mountains, yet she still managed to reach this place alive. This was simply a heavenly feat.Xiao Qingge knew what he was thinking and said in a low voice, \u201cI have a reason for entering this place. To be able to live until now is purely due to good luck\u2026\u201dLi Ran nodded. \u201cThen, I wish you luck.\u201dClearly, he was not interested in her background.Xiao Qingge understood. He was chasing her away.Logically speaking, the other party had saved her life and had yet to blame her. It was already benevolent and righteous.However, just outside the Hundred Thousand Mountains, she had encountered such a terrifying demon. She was several tens of kilometers away from the secret realm, and her chances of arriving there alive were basically zero.\u201cWhat should I do\u2026\u201d She hesitated for a moment.Li Ran raised his brows. \u201cWhat? You want me to send you off?\u201dXiao Qingge gritted her teeth and said, \u201cI\u2019m brave enough to make a deal with Senior!\u201d\u201cNot interested.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about the secret realm that\u2019s about to be opened, which contains the Ancient Immortal Emperor\u2019s Inheritance!\u201dShe now understood it. On her own, she couldn\u2019t touch the secret realm.It was better to cooperate with someone with strength for her to have a chance.\u201cThe Immortal Emperor\u2019s Inheritance?\u201dLi Ran shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re just a mortal. Why should I trust you?\u201d\u201cBecause\u2026\u201d Xiao Qingge wanted to tell her background, but she was afraid that she would be killed.Just as Li Ran was beginning to get impatient, a notification suddenly rang in his mind!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37: Sheng Zi is a soft person with a cold exterior!A system notification sounded in Li Ran\u2019s mind.\u3010Mission Issued.\u3011\u3010Immortal path is illusory, and opportunities are fleeting.

I didn\u2019t deserve to negotiate with you, but this secret realm is far too important. There is no other method.\u201d\u201cWhat you just said\u2026 What kind of deal do you want?\u201d Li Ran asked.Xiao Qingge\u2019s spirit was refreshed. \u201cI\u2019m willing to share all the information I have with you. I only want Senior to bring me into the secret realm! As long as we can enter it, we can rely on our own abilities to obtain any fortuitous opportunities!\u201d\u201cAbility?\u201d Li Ran sneered. \u201cYou\u2019re just a mortal. If I enter the secret realm and kill you, wouldn\u2019t you be making a fool of yourself?\u201dXiao Qingge\u2019s face turned pale.\u00a0How could she not have thought of this?She gritted her teeth and said, \u201cThe matter has come to this point. I can only gamble!\u201d\u201cWhat are you betting on?\u201d Li Ran asked.Her eyes were clear. \u201cI\u2019m betting that you\u2019re not a wicked person!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLi Ran shook his head. In front of Immortal Destinies, even one\u2019s family members would turn against each other.She actually believed in a stranger?He didn\u2019t know if she was too stupid or naive\u2026\u201cSenior, can you consider?\u201d Xiao Qingge asked carefully.Li Ran looked at her scarred appearance and casually tossed a healing pill. He said indifferently, \u201cBefore we reach the secret realm, you better not die so quickly.\u201dThen, he turned around and left.\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d Xiao Qingge heaved a sigh of relief.Her tensed nerves relaxed, and exhaustion and pain immediately emerged. Her legs nearly fell to the ground.Lu Xinran gently supported her. \u201cBe careful. Go over there and sit with us.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dXiao Qingge looked at her gratefully.\u2014Sitting beside the bonfire, Xiao Qingge swallowed the medicinal pill and her injuries began to heal rapidly.After all, to her mortal physique, this was a true \u2018immortal pill\u2019\u2026Lu Xinran smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t look at our Sheng Zi from his cold personality. He\u2019s actually enthusiastic. He\u2019s just not good at socializing.\u201d\u201cYes, I can tell that Senior is indeed an ardent and righteous man.\u201d Xiao Qingge nodded.Pfft~Lu Xinran could not help but laugh.\u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d Xiao Qingge was puzzled.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s just that I feel a bit strange listening to you calling him senior.\u201d Lu Xinran shook her head and said, \u201cObviously, Sheng Zi is only eighteen years old this year. You called him like he\u2019s eighty, haha!\u201d\u201cEighteen?!\u201d Xiao Qingge was shocked.\u201cTo be able to kill this Demonic Bear, he has to at least have a Golden Core realm cultivation. How could he be just eighteen?\u201d She was speechless.Even with her previous talent, she was only at the late Foundation Establishment Realm at that age, barely touching upon the threshold of the Golden Core Realm.Lu Xinran shrugged her shoulders. \u201cBut Sheng Zi is indeed in the Golden Core Realm and he is indeed eighteen.\u201d\u201cHow could it be\u2026\u201d Before Xiao Qingge could finish speaking, she suddenly thought of something.With such a heaven-defying talent, apart from that person in her heart, who else would there be?She hurriedly asked, \u201cSister, which sect are you all from?\u201dLu Xinran scratched her head, \u201cPromise me that you won\u2019t be afraid of us\u2026 we\u2019re disciples of Youluo Temple. We\u2019re here for the Grand Myriad Mountain Range trial.\u201dShe quickly added, \u201cBut don\u2019t worry. Although we are the so-called Devil Sect, we won\u2019t slaughter the innocent.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re really from the Youlou Temple!\u201d\u201cIf you say that, isn\u2019t Senior\u2026\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s Li Ran, the sect\u2019s Sheng Zi, the strongest genius in the vast lands!\u201d Lu Xinran said proudly.\u201cIt really is him!\u201d Xiao Qingge looked at Li Ran in a daze, her eyes blank and bewildered.She had imagined ten thousand scenarios, but she would never have imagined that they would meet in this way.I haven\u2019t seen him in ten years, he has changed a lot\u2026His personality is colder than before, but his talent is still so terrifying.With his current strength, he had already stood at the top of the younger generation.What about me? I\u2019ve lost my cultivation and became a mortal.We are from a different world, I\u2019m afraid he won\u2019t remember me anymore\u2026\u2026Mist filled Xiao Qingge\u2019s eyes\u2026At this moment, a white robe was thrown at her. She raised her head blankly and saw Li Ran\u2019s back facing her.His voice was indifferent as he said, \u201cYour clothes are torn and tattered. They are unsightly. I haven\u2019t worn these clothes yet, take them and wear them in the meantime.\u201dXiao Qingge\u2019s clothes were ragged and her fair skin was exposed. She really couldn\u2019t wear her old clothes anymore.\u201cThank you.\u201d She wore the white robe as the fresh fragrance blew past her nose. Her face turned red for no reason.Her heart seemed to be filled with warm water, filled with indescribable warmth.Lu Xinran suppressed her smile and leaned against her ear and said, \u201cSee? I already told you that Sheng Zi is a soft person with a cold exterior!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38: Soft your sister!\u201cSoft person with a cold exterior?\u201d Xiao Qingge looked at Li Ran, who was seriously roasting the bear paw, and reluctantly accepted this statement.\u201cSince he is so outstanding, there should be many people who like him, right?\u201d She asked side by side.Lu Xinran nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a lot. Which female disciple of the Twelve Palaces on the Eight Peaks of the Youluo Temple doesn\u2019t admire Sheng Zi?\u201dAlthough this statement was a bit exaggerated, it was almost the same as the truth. He was handsome, talented, and well-respected\u2026 In simpler terms, he was a perfect male god.\u201cThen\u2026 does he have any girlfriends?\u201d Xiao Qingge could not help but ask.\u201cAre you kidding me? Of course not!\u201d Lu Xinran said with a serious expression. \u201cIt\u2019s forbidden for Youlou Temple\u2019s disciples to have a man-woman relationship. We\u2019re just enjoying admiring him, but we don\u2019t dare to have any other thoughts.\u201cFurthermore, if you think about it, Sheng Zi has reached the Golden Core Realm at just the age of eighteen. He must be a cultivation maniac. How could he be in the mood to fall in love!\u201dIf she knew that Li Ran had captured the sect master\u2019s heart, the three sects would probably collapse\u2026\u201cMakes sense!\u201d Xiao Qingge nodded, she fell as if a boulder was weighing down on her heart.\u201cBut even though you can\u2019t be lovers, you can occasionally get close.\u201d\u201cClose?\u201dLu Xinran moved closer to her ear and said shyly, \u201cJust now, I took the opportunity to hug Sheng Zi. That feeling, that muscle\u2026 it\u2019s truly amazing!\u201d\u201cYou rascal!\u201d Xiao Qingge spat at her with a red face.Suddenly, she felt like her husband had been touched\u2026\u201cBy the way, I still don\u2019t know what your name is?\u201d Lu Xinran asked.Xiao Qingge hesitated for a moment. \u201cMy name is Sun Qingqing.\u201dShe did not want to deceive this kind-hearted girl, but the meaning behind the name \u201cXiao Qingge\u201d was too complicated, and it was very easy to attract the disaster leading to her death.Moreover, she didn\u2019t want to meet Li Ran in this manner\u2026Lu Xinran didn\u2019t think too much and nodded. \u201cMy name is Lu Xinran. Don\u2019t be afraid. I will take care of you!\u201dAs she spoke, she gave the impression of a big sister.\u201cAll right.\u201d Xiao Qingge smiled.Looking past the warm bonfire in front of her, what came into her sight were the disciples\u2019 laughter and Li Ran who is busily roasting the bear paws\u2026 Her heart was filled with indescribable warmth that she could not feel at home.\u201cThis is one of the top Devil Sect?\u201d The corner of Xiao Qingge\u2019s mouth slightly curled up. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the temperament of a villain at all!\u201dEver since Xiao Qingge learned of Li Ran\u2019s identity, she had put down all her guard.Not only did she give the map to him, but she also gave him all the information she knew.This caused Li Ran to suspect that this girl had a problem with her brain\u2026\u201cSenior Li, there are only three days left before the secret realm opens. Should we hurry up?\u201d After rectifying the gap, Xiao Qingge asked.Over the past few days, Li Ran had led the team to hunt demon beasts, killing hundreds of thousands amounting to a mountain of corpses and rivers of blood.It seemed that he had no intention of heading to the secret realm.\u201cThere\u2019s no rush. Let\u2019s wait until the sect\u2019s training is over,\u201d Li Ran replied.In the depths of the Hundred Thousand Mountains, he could not leave these disciples behind.\u201cAll right.\u201d Xiao Qingge had no objections.Two more days passed.The disciples gathered enough demon bones to complete the trial mission.Li Ran sent them back to the teleportation portal.The deacons guarding the teleportation array were shocked.Normally, the training period of the sect would normally be around a month, and there would inevitably be casualties.However, Li Ran\u2019s group of disciples completed the mission in only a third of the time.Moreover, not a single person had died.At this moment, the young disciples were carrying beast bones with fierce and determined eyes.\u00a0Everyone had undergone a qualitative transformation!In front of the teleportation formation.Li Ran looked at them and said indifferently, \u201cTo be honest, I originally didn\u2019t expect much from you guys, but you guys have proven yourself during these ten days of trials.\u201dThe trial disciples were excited, their chests rising and falling.It was as if they had received the best reward.\u201cThe Immortal Path is a bitter and cold journey, and the great dao is difficult to seek!\u201d\u201cOnly by treading forward bravely and holding your head high can we become immortals!\u201d\u201cThe most important thing in cultivation is talent, but what is more important than talent is the firm belief of never backing down!\u201dLi Ran\u2019s eyes swept across everyone\u2019s faces, and he said slowly and firmly, \u201cDisciples, your martial luck is flourishing!\u201dThe disciples\u2019 bodies trembled as they felt their blood boiling.Whoosh!Everyone knelt on one knee in unison, shouting fervently.\u201cSheng Zi!\u201d\u201cSheng Zi!!\u201dXiao Qingge stood at the side, watching this shocking scene, unable to speak for a long time.The disciples reluctantly entered the teleportation portal and returned to the sect located thousands of miles away.Lu Xinran hugged Li Ran\u2019s thigh and insisted on exploring with him.In the end, he kicked her away\u2026Li Ran couldn\u2019t help but sigh as he watched the light of the formation extinguish. His expression was desolate.\u201cI wonder if Master has returned to the sect? I want to pinch her little hand and hear her call me husband\u2026\u201dXiao Qingge didn\u2019t know what Li Ran was thinking. She thought that he was reluctant to part with those disciples.Her voice was gentle and comforting. \u201cDon\u2019t feel bad. They have to learn how to grow up.\u201dLi Ran was dumbfounded. \u201c???\u201d\u201cWhat does it have to do with me if they don\u2019t grow up?\u201d\u201cStill not accepting it? You\u2019re really soft inside!\u201d\u201c\u2026Soft your sister!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39: To the Secret Realm!After sending off the disciples of Youluo Temple, Li Ran brought Xiao Qingge back to the forest. Along the way, Xiao Qingge looked at his gloomy expression and couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\u201cDon\u2019t be angry, you can treat me like you\u2019re not soft, okay?\u201d\u201cLao Tzu is not!\u201d Li Ran\u2019s face darkened even more.\u201cGot it!\u201d Xiao Qingge was also afraid of provoking him, so she changed the topic and said, \u201cHowever, what you said earlier was indeed very inspiring. It directly matched my thoughts.\u201d\u201cWhich words?\u201d Li Ran asked.Xiao Qingge said, \u201cEven if I want to bravely tread forward, my firm belief is more important than my talent. I benefited a lot from your words!\u201d\u201cOh, I said that.\u201d Li Ran said indifferently, \u201cI lied to them.\u201d\u201cAh? You lied to them?\u201d Xiao Qingge was stunned.\u201cYou don\u2019t genuinely believe faith is more important than talent, right?\u201d Li Ran replied.\u201cOf course. Faith is very important!\u201d Xiao Qingge nodded.Li Ran smiled. \u201cYou, a mortal, must have a very firm belief that you can survive in this demon land for five days alone.\u201d\u201cBut what use was there? You probably can\u2019t even beat a Sharp-toothed Tiger.\u201dXiao Qingge became silent.This was the truth she could not refute.\u201cMany of them might not be able to become Golden Core cultivators in their entire lives.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve only cultivated for ten years, yet I\u2019ve already reached a level that they can\u2019t reach in their entire lives.\u201d\u201cThey can only receive a few spirit stones per month, but the resources of the entire sect are at my disposal.\u201d\u201cThis is the difference in talent that can not be made up by anything.\u201d Li Ran\u2019s voice was calm as if he was merely stating the truth.How could Xiao Qingge not understand this fact?When she was still a super-grade talent, the Supreme Dao Palace had treated her like a treasure.However, when her talent disappeared, the sect expelled her without a shred of empathy.\u201cSince that\u2019s the case, why are you lying to them?\u201d Xiao Qingge was puzzled.Li Ran smiled, \u201cBecause faith is the only thing they can control.\u201d\u201cCultivation is a long and arduous process. In the next few days, they will face endless setbacks.\u201d\u201cI hope that today\u2019s encouragement will become their motivation when they are in despair and will support them as they go.\u201d\u201cI told them from the beginning that my only request to them\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s for them to live.\u201dLi Ran was not a cold-blooded animal. Although he felt that this group of adorable new disciples was troublesome, their admiring gazes gave him a sense of responsibility.Xiao Qingge looked at him for a long time and said seriously, \u201cLi Ran, you are truly a good person.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Li Ran\u2019s mouth slightly trembled.\u201cYou are a good person. Your entire family is a good person!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve honored me!\u201d\u2014\u201cSenior, the secret realm is about to open, but we still have fifty kilometers to go!\u201d Xiao Qingge said anxiously, \u201cI think we\u2019re too late!\u201dThere was a taboo in the Grand Myriad Mountain Range.After crossing the outer zone, flying is prohibited. Otherwise, it would be very easy to attract the attention of the vicious beasts in the depths of the region, inciting troubles on themselves.As for this place, the forest was dense, the roads were rugged, and demon beasts could be seen everywhere.Plus, she was a mortal, so her speed could not be raised at all.\u201cWe\u2019re too late?\u201d Li Ran glanced at the map. \u201cThen let\u2019s speed up a bit.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dJust as Xiao Qingge was about to speak, her body suddenly became lighter as the surrounding scenery quickly retreated.Li Ran was hugging her waist and running forward.He didn\u2019t bother dodging, and like a tank, all the trees in front of him were destroyed with a single leap.When he reached the steep terrain, he leaped forward and landed on the ground like a meteor, leaving behind a huge crater. Then, he continued to run as if nothing else had mattered to him.Roar!The demon beasts noticed him and pounced over with a howl. However, silver light appeared, and blood splashed everywhere. Li Ran\u2019s footsteps didn\u2019t stop, leaving behind only a single piece of flesh.The wind in Xiao Qingge\u2019s ear fluttered, and waves of heat came from his large hand that was wrapped around her waist.Looking at his statue-like side view, her heart began to run rampant. A strange and green feeling filled her heart.\u201cLi Ran\u2026\u201d\u2014The closer they got to the secret realm, the more savage the demon beasts appeared to be.In just one cup of tea, he had already encountered two Foundation Establishment demon beasts.Although they were no match for Li Ran, they prevented Li Ran from advancing at his full speed.He cut the demonic python into two and advanced a few more miles. When the secret realm was not far away, Li Ran suddenly stopped.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Xiao Qingge asked.He put her down and said, \u201cLet\u2019s find a place to hide.\u201dXiao Qingge was stunned. Then, her expression became serious as she silently hid behind a tree.At the same time, two scarlet lights lit up ahead.A huge tiger slowly walked out. It was three times the size of an ordinary Sharp-toothed Tiger. Its entire body was covered in raging flames, and they could feel the terrifying heat from afar.However, the leaves beneath its feet were unscathed.Xiao Qingge covered her mouth and almost cried out in alarm!Scarlet Flame Tiger!A terrifying demon beast with a Golden Core cultivation!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40. Abnormal Phenomenon: Dragon Elephant Zetian!One cultivation day of a human was equivalent to a hundred years of demonic cultivation.Compared to humans, demon beasts\u2019 cultivation path was more than a hundred times harder.Unlike human cultivators who had a set cultivation system. Most of the demon beasts didn\u2019t have much intelligence, and they didn\u2019t have the assistance of a sect. All of them relied on their bloodline to awaken.The stronger their bloodline was, the easier it would be to absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth and complete their transformation.But who said that bloodline inheritance was by any means easy?Even among ten thousand ordinary Sharp-toothed Tigers, it was difficult for a single Scarlet Flame Tiger to appear.However, life was fair. Although it did not give them innate intelligence, it allowed them to possess terrifying flesh and strength.Ordinary Foundation Establishment demon beasts\u2019 combined combat strength was no less than a Golden Core cultivator!On the other hand, this Golden Core Scarlet Flame Tiger\u2019s strength was even more terrifying to the point of being immeasurable. If the Sheng Zi of any sect were to encounter it, they would have to avoid clashing head-on with the tiger.\u201cSenior, this should be its territory. Let\u2019s retreat and change paths!\u201d Xiao Qingge said rationally.Li Ran was very strong, but after all, he was only eighteen.This Scarlet Flame Tiger\u2019s demonic flames seemed to scorch up to the heavens, at least, it should have cultivated for hundreds of years!\u201cRetreat?\u201d Li Ran shook his head. \u201cI hate detours the most. Why don\u2019t you talk with it, and tell it to pretend to not see us?\u201dXiao Qingge was dumbfounded. \u201c\u2026\u201dWhoosh!The flames on the Scarlet Flame Tiger\u2019s body surged, and steam surged out from its nose. Its scarlet eyes were filled with oppressive killing intent.Its intelligence was already activated. Even though it didn\u2019t understand what the two of them said, it was able to distinguish Li Ran\u2019s disdainful tone.No human had ever dared to act presumptuously before it.\u201cAfter blocking my path, you still have a temper?\u201d Li Ran frowned and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not easy for you to cultivate this far. I\u2019ll give you one last chance\u2026\u2026\u201dRoar!Before he could finish speaking, the killing intent in Scarlet Flame Tiger\u2019s eyes became more ferocious as it charged over with its flames.\u201cBe careful!\u201d Xiao Qingge cried out in alarm.However, she was stunned by the scene before her.\u201cYou are the one seeking death\u2026\u201d The air behind Li Ran\u2019s back twisted with a soft hum.The void shattered, and an enormous giant strode out from the void crack.The giant\u2019s body was red, and its body shone with dazzling golden light. Its muscles were solid like steel.A divine dragon was wrapped around its left arm and a giant elephant was captured in its right hand. Behind the figure lies an endless river of cosmic stars.The starry figure shone brilliantly, and the dragon\u2019s imposing aura was comparable to the boundless starry sky!It was as if the pressure from the figure had touched upon the depths of its soul. The flames in the Scarlet Flame Tiger\u2019s entire body converged as it crawled on the ground and trembled with fear.In front of the giant, it was as small as an ant!Li Ran was shocked.This was his first time using a Qi Manifestation skill. This abnormal phenomenon was too grandiose.\u201cSuch a sight to behold!\u00a0Tsk, tsk, if this was a special effect in the modern world, this scene would definitely burn a lot of money!\u201dThe giant, whose face was unidentifiable, lowered its head and looked at the Scarlet Flame Tiger, who had lost its fighting spirit. The giant raised its right foot and kicked at the Scarlet Flame Tiger.Boom!Divine light exploded, and a fierce wind whistled. The trees several kilometers ahead were blown down by the hurricane.Blood sprayed out of the Scarlet Flame Tiger\u2019s mouth, and its muscles and bones shattered as it shot out like a meteor.The beast\u2019s hundreds of years of cultivation were wiped out by a single kick!\u201cNice kick!\u201dLi Ran cheered on the sideline. He couldn\u2019t help but exclaim in admiration as he watched the tiger grow smaller and smaller.\u201cIf national football is at this level, I wonder what it would feel like to play in the World Cup*?\u201d[TLN: I\u2019m assuming he is comparing the skill now, to how strong the skill would be when he becomes stronger.]Buzz~The giant\u2019s body disappeared, slowly disappearing into the void.Li Ran nodded in satisfaction.\u00a0This Qi Manifestation skill is too useful!Moreover, his intuition told him that the power of the \u201cDragon Elephant Zetian\u201d was far more than that.Whether it was the shirtless ascetic, the divine dragon, or the giant elephant, there were many wonderful uses.However, Li Ran\u2019s current cultivation wasn\u2019t sufficient to fully utilize this skill.Xiao Qingge sat on the ground, her eyes dull.What happened just now?A giant suddenly appeared and kicked the Golden Core stage Scarlet Flame Tiger flying?\u201cMy god\u2026\u201d She pinched her cheek, making sure this wasn\u2019t a dream.\u201cHurry up or we won\u2019t be able to reach the secret realm before it opens,\u201d Li Ran walked over and said.\u201cThat\u2026 was the manifestation of your Qi?\u201d Xiao Qingge asked.\u201cYou can take it like that.\u201d Li Ran nodded.Xiao Qingge\u2019s voice shook.This was the first time she had heard that a Golden Core cultivator was able to manifest their Qi!\u201cCould Li Ran really be the reincarnation of an immortal emperor? If not, this matter is really hard to explain!\u201d\u201cLaughable, I thought I could compare to him\u2026 Even if my cultivation is still here, the difference between me and him is like a cloud and mud!\u201d Xiao Qingge looked at Li Ran with admiration.The two continued their journey.Due to the giant\u2019s kick, the tornado broke the trees in front of him, forming a plain road that was several kilometers long.Walking on the road was easier.\u2014Inside the depths of the forest.At the side, there was a stone door on the rock wall. There was deep divine light flickering at the gap between the doors.A group of men and women stood in front of the door, they all looked young.Everyone\u2019s backgrounds were unimaginably huge, amongst them, the worst one was the direct disciple of a first-rate sect.At this moment, they looked at a white-robed man, who was their leader.This person was a direct disciple of the Supreme Dao Palace, Song Qingsong!\u201cSenior Brother Song, with you in the secret realm this time around, the trip will be akin to taking a walk in a field\u2026 we can just drink tea in wait.\u201d the others said flattery words.Song Qingsong shook his head and smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t say that. Fate is unpredictable. We can only depend on our abilities.\u201dAlthough his smile was warm, his eyes were filled with contempt.Only when his sight moved to a girl dressed in green with a long sword, did seriousness appear on his face.\u201cWhy is the Myriad Sword Pavillion here?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41: Pick out two lucky spectators!The green-clothed girl leaned against the tree trunk, a longsword in her arms.Her hair was tied into a high ponytail, and a strand of her hair was scattered beside her ears. At this moment, her eyes were lowered, and she had no intention of communicating with anyone.Song Qingsong looked at her and said with a smile, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect Fairy Yue to come too. Is Myriad Sword Pavilion also interested in this secret realm?\u201d\u201cWhat? Your Supreme Dao Palace can come, but my Myriad Sword Pavilion cannot?\u201d The young woman in green did not raise her head, and her tone was full of hostility.A trace of displeasure flashed through Song Qingsong\u2019s eyes, but he still smiled and said, \u201cFairy Yue has misunderstood. The secret realm is full of dangers, so I feel much more at ease with you here.\u201dThe green-clothed girl did not speak again.Song Qingsong no longer had the intention to do small talks anymore. He turned his head and said, \u201cThis time, the secret realm can hold up to ten people, and the exact ten people present are present here.\u201dEveryone heaved a sigh of relief when they heard this.This was for the best. There was no need to fight for the spot, so they could enter the secret realm in the best possible state.The secret realm was filled with danger. Other than fortuitous encounters, they have to watch out for hidden dangers. One more trump card would be an additional guarantee for them.\u201cThe most important thing is that all of us here are fellow righteous path disciples. There isn\u2019t a single devil sect here. This is indeed a great blessing,\u201d Song Qingsong said.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Everyone is from the same path.\u201d\u201cAt the very least, there\u2019s no need to worry about someone stabbing you in the back.\u201d\u201cWe can follow Senior Brother Song\u2019s leadership at ease.\u201d\u201cSenior Brother Song will definitely protect everyone.\u201dThe others all agreed with him.Song Qingsong nodded in satisfaction. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then let\u2019s wait for the secret realm to open\u2026\u201dBefore he finished speaking, the ground suddenly violently trembled.A gust of wind whistled as the trees were uprooted. Everyone\u2019s body became a little unstable.\u201cWhat boundless spiritual power!\u201d The green-clothed girl suddenly raised her head.Whoosh!A black shadow appeared, followed by a strong wind.\u201cBe careful!\u201dEveryone hurriedly dodged, and the black shadow landed on the ground with a bang, stirring up a large amount of dust.\u201cWhat?\u201dWhen the dust dispersed, the black shadow revealed its appearance.It was a Scarlet Flame Tiger.However, at this moment, its body was shrunken, its bones shattered, and it was on the verge of death.\u201cThis is a Golden Core stage demon beast. Who has such great strength?\u201d someone said with a trembling voice.Song Qingsong frowned, \u201d Could it be that the secret realm had already opened and alarmed the Beast King in the depths of the forest?\u201d His first guess was that the Beast King did it.If it was a cultivator, then the person would be too terrifying.Just as everyone was discussing amongst themselves, the green-clothed girl suddenly said, \u201cSomeone is here.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dThey followed the direction of the Scarlet Flame Tiger and saw two people slowly walking over.The man was tall and handsome. The other person was wrapped in a white robe. Her hood was lowered, and they couldn\u2019t clearly see her appearance. They could only tell from the figure afar that she was a woman.\u201cMy God, did he kick this far?\u201dLi Ran walked over and squatted down. He stretched out his hand to grab the Scarlet Flame Tiger.Its eyes were filled with fear as it struggled to escape. However, its entire body\u2019s bones were shattered, unable to exert any strength at all.It laid on the ground and whimpered as if it was begging for mercy. It did not seem to have the appearance of a Golden Core demon beast.However, its injuries were too severe, and its aura became weaker and weaker. In the end, the light disappeared from its eyes.Li Ran shook his head. \u201cIf I had known this earlier, why would I even bother?\u201dSeeing this scene, everyone was shocked.It was very clear that this demonic tiger had died by his hands. However, this youth was not that old, how could it be\u2026\u201cKick\u2026 He kicked it to death?\u201d They felt a little furry inside.Li Ran stood up. \u201cOh my, how lively is this? Are you all entering the secret realm?\u201dEveryone\u2019s hearts jumped.Hearing this,\u00a0Did he come to enter the secret realm?But they didn\u2019t have an empty spot left!At this moment, Song Qingsong cupped his hands and said, \u201cI am Supreme Dao Palace\u2019s direct disciple, Song Qingsong. May I ask for your distinguished name?\u201d\u201cYouluo Temple, Li Ran,\u201d Li Ran said casually.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAre you Li Ran?!\u201dThe crowd immediately became heated as everyone took a step back.Even the green-clothed girl by the side widened her eyes as she stared at Li Ran.It was actually him!This young man in front of them was the Devil Sect\u2019s Sheng Zi who had exceptional talent.A seventeen-year-old with a Golden Core cultivation, a unique existence in the vast land.As soon as he said that no one from a devil sect had come, the most ruthless one had appeared?\u201cTrouble\u2026\u201dSong Qingsong\u2019s throat tightened. He took a step back, obviously unwilling to start a fight here.Li Ran didn\u2019t care. \u201cIs there enough people?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Xiao Qingge stood behind him and said in a low voice, \u201cThis time, the secret realm can only accommodate ten people, but there are already twelve people here.\u201dShe had never expected that this secret realm would attract so many people, and all of them were sect geniuses!Supreme Dao Palace Song Qingsong, Myriad Sword Pavilion Yue Jianli, Heavenly Daoist Master Murong Chuan\u2026Especially Song Qingsong, they used to be fellow disciples of the same sect. If her current status was exposed, she would get in big trouble.She wrapped her robe tighter and lowered her head even more.\u201cThat\u2019s easy.\u201dLi Ran smiled and said, \u201cPick out two lucky spectators at random and let them return to the sect.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42: This is the so-called righteous path?Hiss!Everyone was shocked when they heard this.This is going to be a tough decision!Li Ran said indifferently, \u201cWill you choose or should I choose for you?\u201dYue Jianli slightly frowned upon hearing this.This person is too overbearing!Everyone looked at each other. As expected of a demon from the Devil Sect. It was clear that he would not reason with them.Then what should they do now\u2026 should they make a move?With the secret realm\u2019s opening, who was willing to use all their trump cards to fight this Devil Sect Sheng Zi?And even if they joined forces, would they be able to beat him?That was someone who could kill even a Scarlet Flame Tiger with a kick!The best option was to choose a sacrificial victim so that they could protect everyone\u2019s interests.If they really waited for Li Ran to pick randomly, everyone would be at risk.The atmosphere quieted down. Everyone\u2019s eyes probed each other, and in the end, they all locked onto one person.Cao Yue.Yan Yue Sect.A second-rate sect\u2019s direct disciple. He was the weakest one here.\u201cWhat are you all looking at me for?\u201d Cao Yue was flustered. \u201cYou want me to leave? I\u2019m the first one who arrived here. I also told you everything I know, right?\u201dEveryone seemed as if they hadn\u2019t heard his words.Cao Yue looked helplessly at Song Qingsong. \u201cSenior Brother Song, you have to decide for me! Didn\u2019t you just say that we\u2019re all righteous path\u2019s disciples and that we need to advance and retreat together?\u201dCough cough.Song Qingsong was a bit embarrassed. He cleared his throat and said, \u201cWe are all righteous path\u2019s disciples. It\u2019s just that your cultivation is shallow, and entering the secret realm might be dangerous\u2026 it\u2019s better for you to go back and cultivate properly first. There will still be many opportunities in the future.\u201dHe sounded like he was really concerned about the other party\u2019s wellbeing.Everyone was convinced by his words.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Cao Yue, your cultivation base is indeed very shallow.\u201d\u201cGo back and train properly!\u201d\u201cSenior Brother Song is doing this for your own good!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to risk your life for the secret realm.\u201dCao Yue looked at their faces and knew that he had been abandoned. He gritted his teeth and said, \u201cGood, very good. I will remember everyone\u2019s face here! The mountains and rivers shall meet*. We will definitely meet again!\u201d[TLN: Idiom to remind powerful people to not go overboard and think of possible payback in the future.]He shouted out his threat and turned around, disappearing into the forest.Pa pa pa pa!Li Ran raised his hand and clapped. \u201cBrilliant, too brilliant! It seems that I really have no potential to be on the righteous path. There\u2019s nothing I can do about it. You\u2019re all hypocrites.\u201dEveryone\u2019s face became red and they turned their heads away in shame.Song Qingsong was rather calm. \u201cDestiny is perpetual, and only the virtuous resides*. It can only be said that Cao Yue\u2019s fortuitous encounter has yet to arrive.\u201d[TLN: In this context, I think Song Qingsong is trying to say that Cao Yue hasn\u2019t accumulated enough virtue(strength) so his opinion is indispensable.]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Li Ran shook his head.This person\u2019s skin was really thick.\u201cAlright, there shouldn\u2019t be any problem now\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish his sentence, Li Ran interrupted, \u201cWait a minute, I\u2019m taking two spots. There\u2019s still one spot left.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Song Qingsong frowned. \u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, the person you brought should be a mortal, right\u201d\u201cA mere mortal is worthy of entering the Immortal Emperor Secret Realm?\u201dXiao Qingge immediately became nervous. What he said was correct. They were all cultivators, and she was the only mortal.If Li Ran really left her\u2026\u201cAre you telling me what to do?\u201d Li Ran laughed coldly. \u201cIf I say she\u2019s worthy, then she\u2019s worthy! Do you have an opinion?\u201d\u201cShould I choose those myself, or would you all rather choose?\u201dSong Qingsong became extremely furious.This Li Ran was too unbridled. But since he didn\u2019t make a move at first, there was no need to make a move now\u2026\u201cMurong Chuan, you can withdraw,\u201d he said.\u201cSenior Brother Song!\u201d Murong Chuan exclaimed.\u201cIf you withdraw yourself, you\u2019ll still be able to retreat completely. Don\u2019t force me to personally send you off!\u201d Song Qingsong\u2019s voice was cold.This was a straight-up threat.Yue Jianli, who had been watching coldly from a distance, had a trace of disdain in her eyes.\u201cSupreme Dao Palace\u2026 so they\u2019re all like this?\u201d Murong Chuan\u2019s face turned pale as he left dejectedly. His body disappeared into the dense forest.\u201cI really didn\u2019t expect Senior Brother Song to be so shameless\u2026\u201d Xiao Qingge secretly shook her head.Looking at the \u2018hero\u2019 she once thought of as, and then at the \u2018devil\u2019 standing in front of her, her thin line separating righteousness and evil became increasingly blurred.\u201cThank you,\u201d she said softly.\u201cNo need. I\u2019m just fulfilling my promise,\u201d Li Ran said casually.Xiao Qingge thought of something and said with a red face, \u201cI hope that you can continue to fulfill that other promise\u2026\u201d\u201cAnother promise?\u201d She was talking about engagement.However, Li Ran did not understand that.After leaving the two unlucky ones, there were still ten people left. All of them could enter the secret realm.Those who got to stay became relieved.However, the atmosphere was no longer as harmonious as before.Li Ran\u2019s presence had destroyed their \u2018alliance\u2019. Now, everyone was suspicious and worried that they would be backstabbed by others.After the time for an incense stick to burn, the stone door lit up with clear divine light.Following a wave of rumbling sounds, the entire mountain began to tremble, and countless small pieces of gravel fell on the ground.Boom!The stone door slowly opened, and divine light shone out. As the crack grew larger and larger, the white light became dazzling until it was impossible to look at.Everyone watched with fervent expressions.The secret realm had finally opened. This was their fate, their fortuitous opportunity.Even Xiao Qingge trembled with excitement. Whether she could return to the Immortal Path was up to her.Li Ran only had one thought.\u201cThe mission was finally about to be completed\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43: Mission Completion, Trial Opening!Normally, you would not require a key to enter the secret realm.As long as the entrance was open, anyone could enter it. Once the maximum number of people was reached, the entrance would automatically close.This was the so-called \u2018Destiny\u2019.As a result, many larger secret realms would undergo a fierce battle before the entrance opening. The Ying Family would set up various formations to prevent people from taking advantage in the dark.Not many people knew about the secret realm this time, so the process was quite harmonious.Although two people were forced to leave, there was no bloodshed.Everyone looked at the dazzling light.They were elated by the opening of the secret realm but dared not take the first step.All of their eyes were focused on Li Ran. Since he didn\u2019t move, and the others didn\u2019t dare to either.The deterrence was evident.Li Ran said, \u201cFollow me.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201d Xiao Qingge nodded.Along with him, she stepped into the white light.Song Qingsong looked at her back and frowned. \u201cHer back\u2026 why does it feel so familiar?\u201dHowever, he didn\u2019t have time to think about it. He followed closely and entered the secret realm.The others hurried in as well. Only Yue Jianli didn\u2019t fight for an early entry, and she unhurriedly entered last.As soon as she had entered, the stone door closed.Everyone was wrapped in white light as they passed through the dark tunnel.When they opened their eyes again, everything suddenly brightened.They were in an ancient forest.The ancient trees were so broad that four or five people could encircle to hug the trees. Some of its roots were exposed on the ground, and the huge canopy towered up the sky.Precious spirit materials could be seen everywhere, and the air was filled with abundant spiritual energy.\u201cWhat a miniature secret realm!\u201d\u201cThe spiritual energy here is very dense. One year of cultivation is comparable to three years of cultivation in the outside world!\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, the secret realm has a time limit. Otherwise, I\u2019d be willing to enter seclusion here!\u201d\u201cMy God, is that a hundred-year-old Scarlet Fruit?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s also Purple Ivy and the Nether Soul Grass\u2026 T-this is the Ancient Emperor\u2019s back garden?\u201dEveryone was dazzled.Spirit materials that were extremely precious in the outside world were everywhere.Even the sect geniuses find it hard to calm down. As soon as they arrived inside the secret realm, they already found such peerless treasures.If they were to advance further, wouldn\u2019t there be a bigger surprise lying in wait for them?Perhaps\u2026 The Ancient Emperor\u2019s Inheritance?!Song Qingsong\u2019s breathing became ragged.At this moment, ripples appeared in the air. One by one, large words materialized from thin air and they were automatically arranged into words.\u3010Seek the immortality and compete against the heavens, a path filled with bones and overflowing karma\u2026\u3011\u3010First Trial, Hunting.\u3011The text was lengthy.Perhaps it signified that this secret realm was indeed the inheritance of a major powerhouse. This place was the first level of the secret realm and everyone had to complete the trial to enter the next level.The first trial required them to hunt demon beasts. The top eight people who collected the most demon bones could obtain the qualifications to enter the next level, and the remaining two would be sent out of the secret realm.\u201cThis trial is really simple and crude.\u201d Li Ran smiled, \u201cBut I like it.\u201dAfter the others had finished reading the mission, they quickly flew into the depths of the forest. The howling of the demon beasts was heard.Of the chosen ones here, all were extremely powerful. Now, they were faster than anyone else!Li Ran was in no hurry. He summoned the system in his mind, preparing to receive the reward first.\u3010Mission was completed.\u3011\u3010Degree of completion: Perfect\u3011\u3010Obtained Super Treasure Chest x1.\u3011\u201cWoohoo~ It\u2019s actually a super treasure chest!\u201d Li Ran immediately opened the treasure chest.\u3010Congratulations to the host for obtaining the \u201cGolden Lightning Curse\u201d.\u3011The \u201cGolden Lightning Curse\u201d was a divine ability that manipulates the Divine Thunder from the Nine Heavens to cause a devastating blow to the enemy.The higher one\u2019s cultivation base is, the stronger the divine lightning would be.In the hands of an expert, its might was not even inferior to a heavenly tribulation!Destroying a city was as simple as chatting and laughing!\u201cThe needle need not poke*!\u201d Li Ran expressed his satisfaction.[TLN: A Chinese meme that translates into \u2018really good\u2019.]Apart from the Dragon Elephant Zetian, he had another trump card.\u201cLet\u2019s go! We\u2019re going on a rampage!\u201d After closing the system, he prepared to head to the dense forest to hunt. Only then did he notice that Xiao Qingge\u2019s face was pale.\u201cI forgot that you were a mortal\u2026\u201d Li Ran scratched his head. \u201cYou tried your best to enter the secret realm, but you couldn\u2019t even finish the first round of the trial. What\u2019s going on here?\u201dXiao Qingge bit her lip. She was mentally prepared for all of this.\u201cSenior, being able to bring me here is already a matter of utmost benevolence and righteousness. Our agreement is fulfilled.\u201d Xiao Qingge bowed and continued, \u201cOpportunities are fleeting. Senior, don\u2019t waste time on me anymore. It\u2019s better for Senior to quickly hunt demon beasts. I hope Senior can receive the ultimate inheritance.\u201d\u201cOh, okay.\u201d Li Ran nodded and left without hesitation.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Xiao Qingge was stunned for a moment. She did not know whether to laugh or cry.\u201cThis fellow\u2026 he is quite straightforward\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026The Spirit Fruit\u2026 I must obtain it! This is my only chance!\u201d\u201cOf course, the prerequisite was to survive\u2026\u2026\u201dLi Ran entered the forest.His intuition told him that Xiao Qingge had a big secret.However, if there were no secrets on his body, how could he have the nerve to come out?That was why he was not interested.The two of them had been in contact with each other for more than ten days. He felt that her personality was not bad. Xiao Qingge was very good towards him.Li Ran was different from those arrogant Immortal Elders. Even if the other party was an emperor, he wouldn\u2019t care about them. If he took a liking on anyone, even mortals would be considered his brothers.Therefore, when he left, he quietly placed a talisman on Xiao Qingge\u2019s body\u2026\u201cStinky little sister, don\u2019t tell anyone that this brother didn\u2019t cover for you!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44: Xiao Qingge\u2019s last chance!Li Ran entered the depths of the forest. As he moved along, the surroundings were filled with verdant light. Suddenly, he felt his heart skip a beat. It was as if something was staring at him from the dark.However, he didn\u2019t find anything after careful investigation.\u201cIt\u2019s just too quiet.\u201dThe trees covered the sky, many times higher than the other regions. There wasn\u2019t a single bug or songbird chirping, nor could the sounds of battle be heard. The silence was akin to death, he could almost hear his heartbeat.The sun above was scorching, but there was not a trace of warmth on his body.He continued to walk forward. Other than the trees, there were no other creatures around him.\u201cWeird, where did all the demon beasts go?\u201d Li Ran muttered.An ancient tree suddenly split its bark open right behind him, as if it was mocking him.Li Ran\u2019s body suddenly stopped, as if he was in a daze.The ancient tree\u2019s \u2018smile\u2019 grew even bigger as it silently stretched out its body. Its branches, which were as thick as a person\u2019s arms, ruthlessly whipped towards him.Bang!There was a crater on the ground but no figure was present.\u201cI\u2019ve caught you!\u201dLi Ran\u2019s smile was vicious as he hovered in the air. Yunling Spear appeared in his hand. He threw it out like a javelin, and the silver spear pierced the tree demon\u2019s mouth at a lightning pace.Boom!There was a loud explosion in the air. The giant tree demon exploded from the middle, and with an ear-piercing wail, it fell to the ground with a bang.The silver spear flew back into his hand and Li Ran landed lightly.\u201cYou want to pretend like a normal tree? Your head must be crooked!\u201d As the smoke and dust dissipated, the trees withered, and only a branch that emitted a sparkling green light was left on the ground.This was the spirit marrow of the tree demon, the beast\u2019s demon bone.Li Ran tossed it inside his storage ring.\u201cNo wonder no demon beasts can be seen here. So this tree itself is a demon.\u201d\u201cBut then again, there are so many trees here, but there\u2019s only one demon here?\u201dAs soon as he thought of this, the sky suddenly darkened. Li Ran\u2019s pupils constricted as he left the spot.Roar!The surrounding ancient trees split open one after another, and the group of demons howled.Boom boom boom!The tree trunks that covered the sky frantically smashed its branches down. The surface of the earth cracked, and stones collapsed.Li Ran transformed into a shadow, moving through the barrage of attacks. This group of tree demons were not weak, the weakest among them possessed a Foundation Establishment cultivation.Their roots dug deep into the ground, continuously providing vitality for them. Coupled with the extremely large number of roots, it was indeed quite a trouble.Even if a Golden Core Cultivator were to face this group of demons, the cultivator would be killed by them.\u201cOpportunities are always accompanied by danger\u2026\u201d Li Ran\u2019s body was suspended in the air, and his hands formed seals as he fiercely pressed down!Bang!A muffled sound rang out in the air. The branches of the demonic trees slightly arched down, as if they were facing great resistance.Youluo Temple Secret Technique: Hidden Spirit Suppression Seal!At the same time, numerous black blades formed behind Li Ran. In a blink of an eye, the black blades numbered to hundreds.The black blade floated in the air, making a buzzing sound.\u201cDie!\u201d Following his furious shout, the blades rained down like a rainstorm.Boom boom boom boom!The hurricane soared and sawdust flew everywhere.The tree demons howled as they collapsed, causing an earth-shaking explosion. When the last tree demon was destroyed, the forest finally became quiet.Amidst the dust, the ground was covered in a green light, filled with the tree demons\u2019 demon bones.\u201cThis is definitely enough. If I still can\u2019t advance, I\u2019ll just sit down and rest.\u201dLi Ran gathered the demon bones and slowly walked away\u2026\u2014On the other side\u2026Xiao Qingge was carefully shuttling through the forest.She hid like a rabbit at the notice of the slightest movement.In this secret realm, she was simply too weak. She knew that she would definitely not be able to enter the second level. Therefore, before she was eliminated, she had to find immortal materials to produce spirit fruits.Spirit Fruit.A fruit that was said to be capable of bringing the dead to life. As long as there was a breath left inside you, the fruit would be able to revive you.Besides saving one\u2019s life, it had a special effect that only a few people knew about. The effect was to reverse one\u2019s spiritual root. The Spirit Fruit would destroy the spiritual root, and then reverse the spiritual root grade.If cultivators ate it, their cultivations would be lost, and they might even lose their innate talent. It was even more poisonous than poison.However, Xiao Qingge happened to be a mortal who had lost her cultivation. As long as she obtained the Spirit Fruit, she would be able to reverse and regain her cultivation and talent.This was something she had accidentally stumbled on from an ancient book. However, the Spirit Fruit was an ancient immortal herb.Not to mention the mortal world, not even the Supreme Dao Palace had it. It was rumored that the last time the Spirit Fruit had appeared was in a secret realm in the Western Region.That was why she placed her hope here.\u201cI must find it before the trial ends. Otherwise, I really won\u2019t have a chance!\u201d A trace of anxiety flashed across Xiao Qingge\u2019s face.Suddenly, the wind whistled behind her. Xiao Qingge\u2019s pupils suddenly constricted.Someone is here!\u201cYo, isn\u2019t this the mortal who followed Li Ran into the secret realm? Did Li Ran leave you alone here? I\u2019m afraid that the demon beasts will eat you!\u201d Song Qingsong\u2019s voice rang out.Grimness flashed through Xiao Qingge\u2019s eyes. This was the person she was most unwilling to meet!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45: How do you want to die?Seeing that she didn\u2019t answer, Song Qingsong said with displeasure, \u201cI\u2019m talking to you. Didn\u2019t you hear me?\u201dXiao Qingge was afraid that he would recognize her voice.How could she dare speak?She lowered his head silently and turned around to leave.\u201cLi Ran\u2019s arrogance is fine but a mere mortal dares to ignore me?\u201d Song Qingsong felt insulted by this gesture of hers.With a wave of his right hand, a gale appeared and directly blew Xiao Qingge away.Bang!Her body smashed into a tree and she spat a mouthful of blood. An intense pain came from within her body. Her internal organs seemed to be damaged, but she still gritted her teeth and remained silent.\u201cHeh, you got quite the backbone.\u201d Song Qingsong walked over and stretched out his hand to pull off her hood. \u201cYou wanted to act sneaky and refuse to show yourself. Let me see your face\u2026\u201d his words stopped abruptly.He stared blankly at that face, his eyes filled with disbelief.\u201cXiao Qingge?!\u201d\u00a0No wonder her back looked familiar. It was her!Xiao Qingge staggered to her feet and wiped the blood from the corner of her mouth.She calmly said, \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, Senior Brother Song.\u201dSong Qingsong snapped back to his senses and frowned. \u201cWhy are you here? \u201cWho told you where this secret realm is located?\u201dEven if the Xiao family were to know of this information, they would not send a mortal here.Also, how could she be together with Li Ran?Xiao Qingge said, \u201cThis is my matter, so there\u2019s no need to report it to you, right?\u201dShe didn\u2019t mention anything, but Song Qingsong was no fool.As his mind spun, he understood many things.\u201cAre you trying to regain your talent and return to the cultivation path through this secret realm?\u201dXiao Qingge didn\u2019t reply. It could be considered acquiescence.Song Qingsong grunted coldly, \u201cYou don\u2019t know your place! You think you, a mere mortal body, is worthy of competing with me for a fortuitous opportunity?\u201d\u201cThen I wish Senior Brother Song good luck.\u201d Xiao Qingge didn\u2019t say anything more and turned around to leave.The Spirit Fruit was yet to be found, and she was so anxious that she didn\u2019t want to mess with him at all.Seeing her graceful back, Song Qingsong\u2019s eyes grew colder and colder. Back then, as a genius cultivator, she had treated him coldly and without any warmth. Now that her cultivation had been completely lost, she was still so arrogant.\u201cDid I let you go?\u201d With a wave of his right hand, Song Qingsong\u2019s Qi shattered the tree and the tree fell towards her.Xiao Qingge fled in a sorry state; she was nearly crushed into mush.\u201cSong Qingsong, what do you mean by this?\u201d her face turned ashen.Song Qingsong sneered, \u201cEven though you\u2019ve been expelled by the sect, you still have the imprint of our Supreme Dao Palace! Now you dared to collude with someone from a devil sect, what shame have you brought to the Supreme Dao Palace!\u201d\u201cToday, I will clear the shame of my sect!\u201d His eyes were sinister, radiating with killing intent.The hairs on Xiao Qingge\u2019s body stood on end as she forcefully said, \u201cKill me? Are you not afraid of Li Ran?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bring him up to me!\u201d Hearing this name, Song Qingsong\u2019s expression became even more vicious. \u201cIf he cares about your life, then why would he throw you here alone? Wait until I kill you and feed your corpse to the demon beasts. Who would know that I committed the murder?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Xiao Qingge felt a chill run down her spine.Is this vicious man in front of her Senior Brother Song, the one who was akin to a hero in her memory?\u201cThere\u2019s no grudge between us. Why are you doing this?\u201d She really could not understand.Song Qingsong smiled sinisterly, \u201cIf you want to blame someone, then blame Li Ran who made you so arrogant!\u201dDriven by Qi, the flying sword automatically unsheathed and whistled towards Xiao Qingge.His eyes were ferocious, and all the resentment he felt towards Li Ran was vented in this sword strike.\u201cLi Ran\u2026\u201d Xiao Qingge closed her eyes in despair.The last thing that appeared in her mind was not anger or unwillingness, but the figure of that man.\u201cGoodbye.\u201dBang!A muffled sound rang out, however, no pain followed as she had expected.Her body was shrouded by a dark light, and like a light shining on a translucent cocoon, the flying sword was completely blocked.\u201cDark Light Cocoon? It\u2019s Li Ran\u2019s talisman!\u201d Song Qingsong\u2019s expression became anxious.The reason why he dared to attack Xiao Qingge was that she was a mere mortal.That didn\u2019t mean he was willing to fight Li Ran, especially inside this secret realm!\u201cSince this matter has come to this point. I must kill her as soon as possible!\u201d Song Qingsong activated his Qi, and his flying sword shone brightly as it whistled towards the cocoon of light.The amount of Qi that was stored inside the talisman paper was limited, so it definitely couldn\u2019t stop him if he were to use his full strength.Boom!A streak of silver light shot out from the dense forest and slammed into the side of the flying sword, sending it flying.On the other hand, the silver spear was inserted into the ground, and its shaft slightly trembled.\u201cWho is it?!\u201d Song Qingsong turned around with a serious expression.Seeing Li Ran flying down, his pupils constricted.Li Ran ignored him. Instead, he glared at Xiao Qingge. \u201cSo you came to the secret realm to regain your cultivation?\u201dXiao Qingge lowered her head with a red face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Senior.\u201dHer heart was warm.It turned out that he had not left her alone but had been protecting her. This feeling of being cared for\u2026 was great!\u201cWhy did you create more trouble for me?\u201dLi Ran shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re willing to sacrifice your life for the sake of cultivation? Does this path suit you\u2026\u201dXiao Qingge stuck out her tongue in embarrassment.Li Ran had complained enough and turned to look at Song Qingsong. His smile faded, his voice chilly. \u201cYou dared to touch the person I brought inside. Tell me, how do you want to die?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46: Both of us will suffer losses?\u201cHow do you want to die?\u201d Li Ran took a step forward and boundless Qi surged out, forming a raging flame on his body.The raging flame was akin to a bottomless abyss, scorching fiercely.The Yunling spear seemed to sense the current atmosphere, and it trembled as it let out a \u201chum\u201d.The atmosphere immediately became solemn.Song Qingsong felt a chill rising in his heart.\u201cHow could Li Ran not hold back? Too anxious\u2026\u201d Like Li Ran, he was also in the late Golden Core realm.However, this year, he was already almost forty years old, while Li Ran was only eighteen years old. Between them lies a huge gap, like heaven and the earth\u2026Song Qingsong didn\u2019t want to become enemies with such genius.However, the more the matter was like this, the less he could show his weakness.Song Qingsong said in a high voice, \u201cLi Ran, you want to attack me? I urge you to reconsider!\u201d\u201cThis is only the first trial and the later trials will be filled with difficulty! If we both were to suffer any injuries in this battle, won\u2019t we just be doing others a favor?\u201d\u201cWe are all here for the sake of inheritance. It is not a wise decision to fight here.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s right. Senior, don\u2019t waste your time,\u201d Xiao Qingge also advised.She didn\u2019t want Li Ran to miss this rare opportunity because of her.\u201cYes, you\u2019re correct, but I have a small question.\u201d Li Ran smiled and narrowed his eyes. \u201cWhy do you think that you and I will suffer loss?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Song Qingsong was stunned for a moment as his heart rang with alarm.Li Ran\u2019s figure blurred and suddenly appeared above him.\u201cFast!\u201d He wanted to leave, but it was too late. His gaze was replaced by a large hand.Li Ran grabbed his head and ruthlessly smashed it into the ground.Boom!Song Qingsong was blasted into the ground. When the smoke and dust slowly dispersed, Li Ran\u2019s figure stood tall with a huge crater beside him.Song Qingsong laid in the pit, his entire body flickering with protective light. After all, he had the strength of a Golden Core cultivator, and he used a protective skill at the last moment.\u201cLi Ran, how dare you touch me?!\u201d Song Qingsong couldn\u2019t speak.\u201cI would\u2019ve been upset if you died with just that!\u201d Li Ran raised his foot and pressed it down.Bang!The protective light flickered, blocking his kick. Before Song Qingsong could let out a sigh of relief, Li Ran\u2019s Qi surged out like crazy, and it caused him to continuously descend.Crack!With a soft sound, cracks started to appear on the shield. Then, it shattered.Song Qingsong was instantly horrified. He quickly bit through the tip of his tongue and transformed into divine light, escaping for his life.\u201cSpirit Seal!\u201d Li Ran\u2019s right hand formed a seal, causing the air to freeze. Song Qingsong was forced to the ground.\u201cI am the direct descendant of the Supreme Dao Palace. You can not touch me, or the sect leader will not let you off!\u201d Song Qing\u2019s expression was fierce.His Qi circulated, trying to resist the pressure.\u201cChe,\u00a0who are you trying to scare? Do you think my sect doesn\u2019t have a sect leader?\u201d Li Ran snorted coldly.These days, who wouldn\u2019t have any background?Song Qingsong\u2019s heart skipped a beat when he thought of Leng Wuyan. She was a demoness who could wipe out a sect with a wave of her hand, and she was extremely protective of her disciples.\u201cFrom the disciple to the master, neither of them are easy to provoke!\u201d He wanted to cry but no tears would come out.He couldn\u2019t beat them, and his background wasn\u2019t that comparable to them\u2026If the heavens gave him another chance, he would stay as far as possible from Li Ran.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that both of us are going to be injured? That\u2019s it?\u201d Li Ran\u2019s palm moved slightly. The Yunling spear soared into the sky and pointed at Song Qingsong from afar.Song Qingsong grabbed a talisman, he was prepared to flee at any moment.At this moment, a calm voice sounded. \u201cLet\u2019s stop here.\u201dA young girl dressed in green landed between them, she was holding a long sword.The Myriad Sword Pavilion, Yue Jianli!Song Qingsong\u2019s expression was filled with joy as if he had found a backer. \u201cFairy Yue, this devil wants to kill me. We are fellow righteous path cultivators. You must help me!\u201dYue Jianli glanced at him, a trace of disgust flashing through her cold eyes.She turned around and said to Li Ran, \u201cIt\u2019s only the first trial. Even if you\u2019re trying your best, there\u2019s no need to be in a hurry. It\u2019s better to preserve your strength. It\u2019s almost time for the inheritance to appear.\u201dLi Ran pinched his chin and sized her up. \u201cSo you two are together?\u201dYue Jianli shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not familiar with him.\u201d\u201cThen why did you stand up for him? Seeing us fight to the death, wouldn\u2019t it be in your best interest to sit back and reap the benefits?\u201d Li Ran said.\u201cYou\u2019re right. I originally thought the same thing,\u201d Yue Jianli said unabashedly, \u201cBut I\u2019ve discovered that he can\u2019t even force you to use your trump card. Not to mention injuring you?\u201dSong Qingsong\u2019s face turned red, and he wished he could find a hole in the ground to bury his face in.Yue Jianli looked at Li Ran seriously. \u201cYou\u2019re very strong, so strong that I don\u2019t have the confidence to face you alone. This is why I don\u2019t want him to die for now.\u201dNo matter what, Song Qingsong was still in the Golden Core realm, so he was still able to resist to a certain extent.Although she also looked down on Song Qingsong, with him around, she could at least maintain the balance of the situation and not clash with Li Ran so soon.\u201cFor now?\u201d Li Ran raised his eyebrows.\u00a0This person has plans.\u201cThat makes sense. I\u2019ll let him live a little longer.\u201d Li Ran nodded.He could feel that Yue Jianli was very strong. Since the content of the next trial wasn\u2019t made clear yet, he didn\u2019t want to use too many of his trump cards. It wasn\u2019t a good choice to fight against the two at this stage.Yue Jianli nodded and said, \u201cA wise decision.\u201dSong Qingtong heaved a sigh of relief. Although the process was humiliating, he was still alive\u2026Just as he was about to leave, Li Ran\u2019s voice rang out again, \u201cI said I wouldn\u2019t kill you, but did I said that I am letting you go?\u201dSong Qingsong was speechless. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47: Toolman Song Qingsong!Song Qingsong\u2019s legs were about to go limp.What is this guy going to do?!Li Ran said, \u201cYou beat up my sworn brother and wanted to leave unscathed? How could such a good deal exist in this world?\u201d\u201cSworn Brother?\u201d Song Qingsong glanced at Xiao Qingge and thought to himself, \u201cI would be a ghost if I were to believe that. This is clearly your lover!\u201d\u201cThen, what do you want?\u201d He asked in a trembling voice.Li Ran thought for a moment and said, \u201cLeave the demon bone you just collected.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Song Qingsong was taken aback. \u201cNo! You want me to get eliminated in the first trial!?\u201dYue Jianli frowned.This Li Ran had planned it all!If Song Qingsong were to be eliminated now, that would not be good news for her!\u201cWho do you think I am talking to if not you? Don\u2019t tell me you really thought that I wouldn\u2019t dare to kill you with this little girl supporting you, right?\u201dThe air instantly became tense.A trace of anger flashed in Yue Jianli\u2019s eyes.\u00a0Little girl?She was one of the top three geniuses on the Genius Rankings.No one ever had dared to call her that before!However, she still couldn\u2019t figure out the strength of this demon at present\u2026In the end, rationality still had the upper hand.\u201cGive it to him. The trial isn\u2019t over yet, you should go hunt with all your strength. It shouldn\u2019t be a problem for you to enter the top eight,\u201d Yue Jianli said.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s better than dying here, right?\u201dSong Qingsong fell silent.After a moment of hesitation, he tossed his storage ring and said, \u201cAll of the demon bones are here.\u201dLi Ran caught it and scanned it with his qi. He confirmed that there were no problems.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go.\u201d Song Qingsong did not say anything else. He turned around and entered the dense forest.Yue Jianli didn\u2019t say a word as she flew away.\u201cTch,\u00a0why are you pretending to be cold\u2026\u201d Li Ran muttered in dissatisfaction.All Beautiful women seemed to be quite cold. Master was the same at first, but now\u2026She had already transformed from an iceberg into a pool of spring water.\u201cThank you for saving my life,\u201d Xiao Qingge said gratefully. \u201cI can\u2019t repay this kindness!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a small matter. There\u2019s no need to be so pretentious.\u201d Li Ran waved his hand.The two of them had gotten along quite well during this period of time.Xiao Qingge had already given him the map before entering the secret realm. This was a type of trust.Li Ran did not want to watch her die here.\u2014\u201cYou\u2019ve dealt a critical blow against Song Qingsong this time. What if he plans to stab you in the back?\u201d Xiao Qingge had a worried expression.Li Ran shook his head, \u201cWho told you that I intend to kill him?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Xiao Qingge was stunned.When she thought about it carefully, he seemed to have only used hand-to-hand combat, and not any divine abilities.\u201cI knew from the start that Yue Jianli was hiding nearby.\u201d\u201cShe wanted to see my trump card, and I wanted to test her attitude\u2026 As for Song Qingsong? He\u2019s just a toolman.\u201d Li Ran\u2019s expression was indifferent.\u201cA Toolman?\u201d Xiao Qingge was a little confused.Li Ran said, \u201cTo be exact, a deadweight.\u201dWith Song Qingsong around, the three of them would be able to maintain a considerable gap.No matter whether it was he or Yue Jianli who wanted to attack, they had to consider whether they would be attacked by a third person.Li Ran continued, \u201cThis time, the secret realm is full of dangers. Yue Jianli and I have the same idea. In the subsequent trials, we will have to depend on their own strength. When the final inheritance surfaces, we\u2019ll meet again.\u201d\u201cBut what if they join forces to deal with you?\u201d Xiao Qingge asked.\u201cJoin forces?\u201d Li Ran smiled and shook his head. \u201cOnly one person can get the inheritance.\u201d\u201cThat person might be me, or Yue Jianli. However, it\u2019s definitely not Song Qingsong.\u201dYue Jianli wasn\u2019t a fool. When the final inheritance came, Song Qingsong would be the first to get eliminated.\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Xiao Qingge tilted her head, not quite understanding of the situation.Li Ran knocked her on the head and laughed, \u201cYou\u2019re just a mortal. Why are you following me around?\u201dXiao Qingge rubbed her head. \u201cI hope you can obtain Immortal Destinies~\u201d\u201cImmortal Destinies or whatever it\u2019s called, I actually didn\u2019t really care much about it\u2026 But did you get what you wanted?\u201d Li Ran asked.Xiao Qingge had risked her life to enter the secret realm. She definitely had something she wanted\u2026\u201cThat\u2019s right, the Spirit Fruit! It\u2019s over! I\u2019m too late now!\u201d Xiao Qingge patted her head in annoyance.She only cared about Li Ran and forgot about it.\u201cSpirit Fruit?\u201dLi Ran thought for a moment and said, \u201cAlthough there are quite a few spirit herbs here, immortal herbs are still very rare. Perhaps the second trial has something you want.\u201d\u201cBut I can\u2019t advance further\u2026\u201d Xiao Qingge lowered her head in disappointment.\u201cWho said that?\u201d Li Ran tossed a storage ring at her.She caught the ring in a flustered manner. \u201cThis is?\u201dLi Ran said, \u201cThese are the demon bones collected by Song Qingsong. According to the rules of the Secret Realm, as long as this ring is in your possession, it should be considered as your spoils of war.\u201d\u201cIn any case, it\u2019s useless to have too many demon bones. Else, it\u2019ll just be wasted.\u201d With the number of bones Song Qingsong had gathered, it was quite easy for her to advance to the next trial.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Xiao Qingge lowered her head, her eyes growing misty. \u201cLi Ran, how can I repay you for treating me so well?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: No one can collect herbs better than me!Ding!A sound of chime rang out in the secret realm.Everyone\u2019s eyes blurred as they reappeared in an empty area.Some of them were still maintaining their combat stance. Clearly, they were taken while fighting with the demon beasts.At this moment, ripples appeared in the sky, and imposing words appeared once more.\u3010The end of the first trial\u2026\u2026\u3011\u3010Eight people advanced, one died, one eliminated.\u3011\u201cA single person died?\u201d Li Ran\u2019s brows jumped.The ones who entered this secret realm were all sect geniuses. All of them had profound cultivation bases and countless trump cards.The demon beasts here weren\u2019t strong enough to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm. Even if they weren\u2019t able to defeat them, they would definitely be able to safely escape.Unless\u2026 Someone had attacked!Li Ran glanced at Song Qingsong, only to see blood on the hem of his clothes as if he had been injured.He instantly understood. The murderer must be Song Qingsong.He was afraid that he would not have enough time to advance, so he chose to snatch the spoils of war from others.\u201cThis guy is really ruthless.\u201dYue Jianli also looked at Li Ran from afar.Clearly, the two of them had thought of going together. Then, beams of white light shot out, enveloping everyone.The eight people enveloped by the white light gradually dispersed and headed towards the second round of the trial.As for the remaining person, he was sent out of the secret realm with an annoyed expression.\u2014When everyone opened their eyes, they were already in a new world. In front of them was a lush little mountain. The mountain was filled with numerous immortal herbs and spiritual plants, and their grades were several times higher than before.\u201cHeavens!\u201d\u201cSuch rich Qi? It\u2019s simply better than a Qi Gathering Formation!\u201d\u201cThe ground is full of Immortal Herbs! Is the entire lawn made up of Immortal Herbs?\u201d\u201cThis is too shocking! As expected of an Ancient Emperor\u2019s inheritance!\u201dThe geniuses let out waves of exclamations, like children who had never seen the world.Compared to this place, the place just now was like a small Magus. Even if they couldn\u2019t obtain the final inheritance and harvest the immortal herbs, their trip was already worth it!The air trembled once more.\u3010Second Trial: Herb Picking\u3011The contents of this trial were very simple.Everyone had to collect the herbs from the Herb Mountain in front of them. The time limit was two hours.Finally, according to each person\u2019s herb quality, six people will be selected for the next trial.Compared to the previous round, this trial looked much more peaceful. Everyone seemed to be focused on collecting medicine.Of course, the number of immortal herbs was limited, so conflict would definitely arise.\u3010The trial starts now\u2026\u3011Following the order, everyone could not wait to enter the mountain.Li Ran and the other two entered the mountain as well.Collecting herbs was a skill itself.First of all, the precious immortal herbs might not be the most eye-catching ones. The method to distinguish them from each other was a problem.Secondly, the picking method was also very important. If the method wasn\u2019t correct, it might even destroy the medicinal effects and leak out the immortal qi.Li Ran knew nothing about this topic, but he wasn\u2019t worried at all.\u201cAlthough I cannot pick herbs, I\u2019m good at robbing. I can go rob others later.\u201dAfter making up his mind, he leisurely strolled around Herb Mountain.As for Xiao Qingge, she followed beside him, carefully searching for traces of the Spirit Fruit.After the time of a burning incense stick, Li Ran stretched out.\u201cYou can take your time and wander around. I\u2019ll go collect vegetables.\u201dAfter saying that, he soared into the sky.\u201cCollect vegetables?\u201d Xiao Qingge was confused.\u2014Song Qingsong was walking through the Herb Mountain.Amongst these cultivators, he was the oldest and the most experienced. Apart from cultivation, he was also involved in numerous study fields.As for foraging herbs, it was his specialty.\u201cHeh, I\u2019ve read the \u2018Pill Scripture\u2019, the \u2018Herbal Scripture\u2019, and the \u2018Picking Technique\u2019. Nobody knows how to pick herbs better than me!\u201dHe began to search for herbs with confidence. Soon, he found some time near a stone wall.\u201cThousand Year White Vine! \u201c\u201cThis is an immortal herb. It can be used to refine into a Soul Cleansing Pill. The pill has the effect of concentrating and purifying one\u2019s soul!\u201d\u201cGood treasure!\u201d He carefully collected them with the most delicate techniques.After taking two steps, his eyes lit up again.\u201cExtreme Yang Grass, another immortal herb!\u201d\u201cThis herb has the appearance of ordinary immortal grass, but the tips are slightly red. Those who don\u2019t study the Dao of Medicine won\u2019t be able to perceive this difference!\u201d Song Qingsong\u2019s smile grew brighter and brighter.Not only was he able to advance steadily in this round, but he was also able to obtain so many treasures.It was simply a treasure realm.Just as he was enjoying himself, a figure appeared behind him and patted him on the shoulder.\u201cWho is it?!\u201d Song Qingsong was startled. He suddenly turned around.As soon as she saw the person who had arrived, he became nervous.\u201cLi Ran? Why did you come looking for me?\u201dLi Ran scratched his head. \u201cI\u2019m not good at collecting medicine.\u201dSong Qingsong\u2019s brows jumped, and a bad premonition arose in his heart. \u201cSo you\u2019re here to\u2026\u201d\u201cTo rob you.\u201d Li Ran added the latter part.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Song Qingsong\u2019s face turned pale.\u201cYou, you can\u2019t do this. You\u2019re violating the rules. I am collecting the herbs with my own strength\u2026\u201dCrack.Li Ran clenched his fist, his joints cracking, his expression slightly impatient.\u201cI can\u2019t collect herbs, but I can fight you. However, I\u2019m not an unreasonable person so I\u2019ll give you two choices.\u201d\u201cWhich two choices?\u201d Song Qingsong gulped.\u201cFirst, you can take the initiative to give me the herbs.\u201d\u201cWhat about the other one?\u201d\u201cSecond, I\u2019ll beat you up, and then you\u2019ll give me the herbs.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Song Qingsong trembled as he reluctantly handed over his storage ring.\u201cYou\u2019re too polite, please accept this\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49: If you cannot beat them, Join them!\u201cTake care.\u201d Song Qingsong let go of his storage ring as he watched Li Ran leave.After Li Ran\u2019s figure had completely vanished, his face instantly grew twisted, infuriated to the point of exploding.\u201cWhy me! Ugh\u2026 f*ck!\u201d\u201cDamn it, you\u2019re bullying honest people!\u201d\u201cRobbing me! Do you know who I am? I am the Supreme Dao Palace\u2019s direct disciple, Golden Core expert, Song Qingsong!\u201d\u201cWhen we leave the secret realm, I\u2019ll make you pay the price!\u201d After venting his anger, Song Qingsong finally calmed down.In truth, he was just saying that Li Ran had to pay the price to vent his anger. Not only did he not have that strength, but he also did not have the status to back it up.The Supreme Dao Palace was a top-tier sect, but the Youluo Temple was not just any sect either.Song Qingsong was only a direct disciple, but Li Ran was the Sheng Zi, the future sect master of the Youluo Temple.Moreover, he had a terrifying master\u2026A sect couldn\u2019t afford to offend Leng Wuyan. That was why he could only swallow these words.\u201cForget it. It\u2019s not the time to think about this. Fortunately, only an incense stick\u2019s worth of time has passed. I still have enough time.\u201d Song Qingsong calmed down and continued on his journey to pick more herbs.The Herb Mountain was extremely vast. There were countless spiritual plants and flowers. Ordinary people would be dazzled by the sight, let alone to look for immortal herbs.As a result, most of the people\u2019s strategies were to collect whatever they saw. They didn\u2019t have enough knowledge to assess the herb\u2019s quality.As for Song Qingsong, he knew that immortal herbs\u2019 value was simply not something that ordinary spirit herbs could compare to.Therefore, his attention was focused on solely high-grade herbs.\u201cDivine Ning Flower? Good stuff! It\u2019s as valuable as the Thousand-year-old White Vine!\u201d\u201cEvil Mist Grass? This thing is extremely rare and can be used to refine poison pills!\u201d\u201cF*ck, Black Blood Lotus?!\u201d Not long after, Song Qingsong once again obtained several immortal herbs with his extraordinary eyesight and gathering techniques.This was indeed his home ground. No one can collect medicine better than him!\u201cYou think you can stop me from advancing like this? You\u2019re dreaming!\u201d Song Qingsong had a relaxed expression.Huu~Suddenly, the wind behind him sounded.Song Qingsong\u2019s body stiffened. He slowly turned around and saw that Li Ran was smiling at him.\u201cYou\u2019re here again\u2026\u201d\u201cTo rob you.\u201d Li Ran nodded.Song Qingsong felt like dying.But what could he do?With tears in his eyes, he could only hand over the immortal herbs once again and pray that Li Ran would let him go.However, Li Ran was addicted to this act.After the time for an incense stick to burn\u2026\u201cRob!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAnother cup of tea had passed.\u201cI\u2019ve collected the herbs!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLi Ran turned the trial into a penguin farm\u2026 In the end, Song Qingsong was on the verge of collapse.\u201cBig brother, you can\u2019t just take one sheep and repeatedly shear it! Please rob someone else too!\u201d Tears flowed down his face.Li Ran felt a little embarrassed. He scratched his head and said, \u201cBecause you know how to collect herbs.\u201d\u201c\u2026What a sin!\u201dSong Qingsong finally understood that Li Ran would never let him go.If he continued to collect herbs, he would be giving them to others, so he simply gave up on picking the herbs and joined in the robbery.\u201cI cannot beat Li Ran, but does this mean that I cannot beat anyone?\u201d Song Qingsong was specifically looking for someone with lower cultivation than him. He didn\u2019t care what they had picked. He stuffed them all into his ring.He no longer cared about immortal herbs. He only hoped that the trial would come to an early completion and enter the next round of the trial to end this nightmare.Those who were robbed also wanted to rob others. More and more people joined the ranks of the robbers. At this moment, the entire Herb Mountain was filled with resentment.At last, the group started fighting\u2026\u2014Li Ran, the one who had caused all of this, was currently walking around the mountains leisurely with an Immortal Pear.Beside him, Xiao Qingge was searching for traces of the Spirit Fruit. Li Ran glanced at her and said, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be a mortal, right?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Xiao Qingge immediately became nervous.Could it be that he had discovered her identity?\u201cWhy, why are you asking this?\u201dLi Ran shrugged. \u201cMortals wouldn\u2019t know about the secret realm, nor would they know about the Spirit Fruit. You know too much.\u201dXiao Qingge fell silent.After a while, she said in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. There are some things I hid from you\u2026\u201dShe did not want to lie to Li Ran.However, when she saw how free-spirited and arrogant he was, she did not dare to reveal her identity.Their difference was simply too great. It was so great that it caused her to feel despair.\u201cNeedless to say, everyone has their secrets. If I reveal my secret, I\u2019ll probably scare you to death.\u201d He was not interested in prying into the privacy of others.Xiao Qingge shook her head, feeling bitter in her heart.\u201cBut my secret has something to do with you! I\u2019m standing right in front of you, but you can\u2019t recognize me\u2026\u201d her thoughts surged.After a while, she carefully said, \u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d\u201cGo on, but I might not answer all,\u201d Li Ran said.Xiao Qingge\u2019s face turned slightly red. \u201cThat\u2026 Do you have anyone you like?\u201dLi Ran was stunned.It was this type of question?He nodded with seriousness. \u201cYes!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50: Xiao Qingge\u2019s Misunderstanding!\u201cYou have someone you like?\u201d Xiao Qingge\u2019s eyes were filled with disappointment. She had lost her slightest bit of courage.\u201cPerhaps she and I are brought together by fate.\u201d Li Ran shrugged.\u201cThen she\u2026 What kind of person is she?\u201d Xiao Qingge asked.\u201cIt\u2019s quite complicated,\u201d Li Ran thought carefully. No one else dared to approach her, but he was the only one who knew that she was not what the world expected her to be. \u201cShe\u2019s both gentle and cute. She\u2019s a treasure!\u201dOf course, he was referring to Leng Wuyan. However, he didn\u2019t dare to say too much. He was afraid that Xiao Qingge would guess the identity and it would bring unnecessary trouble for them.Xiao Qingge\u2019s heart ached. She said, \u201cBut I remember that Youluo Temple has a rule forbidding disciples from marrying. Aren\u2019t you afraid of being punished by the sect master?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201dHis lover was the sect master.\u00a0What the hell would he be afraid of?However, these words could not be spoken to Xiao Qingge.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge gap between our status. If we were to show up together, we\u2019ll face gossip,\u201d Li Ran said after a moment of deliberation. \u201cBut I don\u2019t care about these things. I\u2019ll try my best to become stronger and protect her.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good\u2026 then, bless you both,\u201d Xiao Qingge whispered.Looking at Li Ran\u2019s bright eyes, she suddenly felt the urge to cry. Now, there was no use in revealing her identity\u2026\u201cThat\u2019s right, when did you meet each other?\u201d She couldn\u2019t help but ask.Li Ran thought about it, \u201cProbably\u2026 when I was eight years old?\u201dPa.Xiao Qingge seemed to have been struck by lightning. The spirit herbs in her hands were scattered all over the ground.\u201cEight years old?\u201d She stared blankly at Li Ran, her eyes filled with disbelief.Li Ran nodded. \u201cYes, the first time I met her, I was still very young and didn\u2019t understand anything. Only recently did I understand my feelings.\u201d\u201cI came down this time to settle some of my family matters, so I can be with her in the future.\u201dOnce the marriage was annulled, he would be able to peacefully fall in love with his master!\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Xiao Qingge\u2019s heart was about to leap from her chest!Met at the age of eight.She and Li Ran were playmates when they were young. They probably met when they were seven or eight years old.No one dared to approach her.She had lost her cultivation base and fell from the clouds. Countless evil devils were coveting her, so no one dared to approach her.Our identities were very different. If he was with her, they would face gossip.These words were correct. Li Ran\u2019s status was noble, and she was only a mortal. If the two of them were to get together, they would indeed be pointed at by the world.The most important thing was that\u00a0\u2018he had to settle some of his family matters to get along with her.\u2019He was talking about the marriage between the two families!He was going to fulfill the engagement so that the two of them could be righteously together.Every single one of them was right!\u201cSo it turns out that Li Ran didn\u2019t forget me. He always liked me!\u201d Xiao Qingge\u2019s nose was sour.Her heart was both sweet and warm. Her lonely and oppressive heart had finally found a place to accommodate.Aggrieved, confused, excited\u2026 She couldn\u2019t help but pounce into Li Ran\u2019s embrace and cry.Li Ran: (\u2299_\u2299)\u201cWhat I said\u2026 was it that touching?\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but scratch his head.What a strange girl.Xiao Qingge\u2019s eyes were filled with tears as she raised them, \u201cLi Ran, it\u2019s me!\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d\u201cI am actually Xiao\u2026 Wu !\u201dHer words came to an abrupt stop. Li Ran covered her mouth and raised his eyebrows.\u201cDon\u2019t say anything. Someone\u2019s coming!\u201d A wave of energy streaked across the sky and someone flew towards their direction, landing not far away from them.Li Ran quickly caught on the azure figure.\u201cYue Jianli?\u201d the corners of his mouth twitched. \u201cLooks like I\u2019ll be able to collect herbs again.\u201d\u2014A mountain valley.Yue Jianli lightly landed on the ground.She took out a square-shaped stone slab. The stone slab was dense and filled with symbols making it resemble a compass. In the middle, there was a golden needle that was slightly vibrating.\u201cIt\u2019s here. According to the Myriad Disk\u2019s direction, there must be immortal materials here.\u201dApart from experience and eyesight, one could also rely on other heavenly artifacts to search for treasures.The Myriad Disk in her hand was one of them. This magical artifact could capture the immortal qi from the treasure, thus pinning down its location. This method of treasure hunting was extremely practical.Yue Jianli had already gathered quite a few immortal materials. Even in top sects, this Myriad Disk was a rare treasure.If Song Qingsong relied on his own ability to harvest herbs, Yue Jian\u2019s method could also count as relying on her ability too\u2026She carefully searched the mountain, and in the end, her gaze locked onto a crooked tree.This tree was withered and aged as if it was about to wither to death. It was in stark contrast to the surrounding lush green spirit herbs.Yue Jianli took a closer look and saw that there was not a single leaf but a bright red fruit on the withered tree.The fruits were round and its fragrance was indistinct.\u201cIt\u2019s a spirit fruit formed from immortal qi!\u201d Yue Jianli\u2019s eyes lit up.This is great!Normally, its medicinal properties could be considered like poison to cultivators, but when one was seriously injured and on the verge of death, this fruit could provide them with a second life.Not to mention that there were other miraculous effects through the spirit fruit refinement. She cautiously reached out her hands and tried to take the fruit.Suddenly, a killing intent came from behind her!\u201cWho is it?!\u201d Yue Jianli dodged the attack with a flip, then her pupils shrank!A silver spear landed in front of her, and the tip of the spear vibrated slightly.Li Ran stretched and walked into her view. \u201cHey, you\u2019re in trouble.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51: Ashamed Yue Jianli!Xiao Qingge was hiding in the forest. As she looked at the fruit on the withered tree, her heart began to race.\u201cIt\u2019s a Spirit Fruit!\u201dWithin the ancient realm, there was indeed a Spirit Fruit here!From the fruit\u2019s effects, Xiao Qingge had a chance to turn around her spirit root and re-embark on the cultivation path.Furthermore, only after she recovered her cultivation would she have the courage to be with Li Ran.Looking at his tall and straight back, Xiao Qingge\u2019s eyes were filled with tenderness.\u2014\u201cLi Ran, what do you mean?\u201d Yue Jianli frowned.Li Ran said casually, \u201cYou should know that I\u2019m interested in this fruit. You can leave now.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve agreed that the trials ahead will all depend on our own merits. Could it be that you want to destroy the agreement?\u201d Yue Jianli\u2019s phoenix eyes narrowed slightly.\u201cWe indeed have to rely on our abilities,\u201d Li Ran said frankly. \u201cCollecting medicine is your ability, but robbing is also my ability. What\u2019s the problem?\u201dYue Jianli\u2019s face became frosty upon hearing his words.From the looks of it, he had no intentions of being reasonable.If she were to give in at this moment, she would only let the other party take more advantage of her.She said coldly, \u201cVery well, then let\u2019s see your ability!\u201dShe decided to use this opportunity to test the strength of a devil sect\u2019s Sheng Zi.Li Ran said in a serious tone, \u201cThen you must be careful. I see that you\u2019re thin and delicate. Don\u2019t cry when you get stabbed by my\u00a0silver spear!\u201dYue Jianli blushed at his remarks.She angrily spat, \u201cPei, vulgar! You really are from the Devil Sect! You\u2019re extremely shameless!\u201dLi Ran was dumbfounded. \u201c???\u201d\u201cDid you misunderstand something\u2026\u201d\u201cEat my sword!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYue Jianli unsheathed her longsword, and as grateful as a stream of autumn water, she slashed out her sword at Li Ran with hatred.\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201dLi Ran sent the sword flying.The sword spun and flew back, landing in front of Yue Jianli.Yue Jianli closed her eyes. When she opened them again, her eyes turned cold, and all her emotions disappeared.She had stepped into the void. The knot holding her ponytail fell off, and her jet-black hair danced in the wind.\u201cA storm is approaching\u2026\u201d A hand seal was formed on her hand. She opened her mouth lightly and the air grew increasingly intense.The longsword trembled as it multiplied from one into two and two into four. In the end, it transformed into sword shadows that covered the sky.This wasn\u2019t an illusion.These sword shadows were formed from Qi.Every single one of them emitted an incomparably sharp sword intent!Yue Jianli lowered her head and looked at Li Ran, her eyes extremely cold.\u201cEvil Demon Annihilation!\u201d With a wave of her hand, the longsword that was hanging in the air instantly launched towards Li Ran.It was like torrential rain.\u201cNot bad.\u201d Li Ran\u2019s eyes were filled with admiration.Bang bang bang bang!Under the torrent of the sword rain, the trees were cut off, the mountain was penetrated, and even the ground was on the verge of collapsing.The destruction might of this attack was a sight to behold.\u201cYou\u2019re too big.\u201d Yue Jianli laughed coldly.Her Storm Sword was able to seal the entire space, so no one could dodge the attack. Unless they were able to escape from the attack range, they could only forcefully receive it.Yue Jianli knew that no one in the same realm would be able to receive this attack. Not even the Sheng Zi of the Devil Sect.Weng~Suddenly, a wisp of faint light amidst the rainstorm. The wisp of light was akin to a lighthouse that was standing firmly in the face of a tempestuous wave.\u201cHuh?\u201d Yue Jianli looked over.Li Ran was wrapped in a cocoon of light and was safe and sound from the rain of swords. Suddenly, he raised the silver spear in his right hand and rotated his body. His entire body, which was arched like a bow, gathered strength and he forcefully threw the spear!\u201cThunder!\u201dThere was a cold light amidst the dark sky. The silver streak of light tore through the sky like a meteor and charged at the sword rain!\u201cNot good!\u201d Yue Jianli\u2019s pupils constricted as she hastily recalled all of her spirit swords and turned into a screen of light to block the spear\u2019s trajectory.Boom!The silver spear was unstoppable, and the screen of light was pierced through like a plank of rotten wood.Just as it was about to pierce through the space between her brows, the longsword howled towards the tip of the spear and forcefully split the screen of light open.Hiss.The silver spear brushed past her skin, leaving behind a faint bloody line.Yue Jianli\u2019s eyes were filled with fear.\u201cThis spear intent\u2026\u201dShe was a pure sword practitioner who treads on the path of Sword. Regardless of whether they were a blade, spear, stick, or a stick user, they were all the same.Li Ran also studied a similar Dao as her, yet his spear intent was purer than hers? This caused her to be deeply shocked.Li Ran flew over to her and lightly stepped on the clouds.\u201cI already told you that my silver spear is formidable\u2026\u201d\u201cCome again!\u201d Yue Jianli\u2019s phoenix eyes were filled with flames, her black hair fluttered, and her sword intent surged.\u201cStill coming?\u201d Li Ran furrowed his brows. \u201cIs it better to decide who is better?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of life and death!\u201d Yue Jianli\u2019s entire body erupted with Qi, and her sword erupted with dazzling divine light.She couldn\u2019t care less about any inheritance or schemes.At this moment, she wanted to prove herself through her sword.This was the pride of a Sword Practitioner!However, Li Ran had a strange expression on his face. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just let it go\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat? Are you afraid?\u201d Yue Jianli sneered.\u201cThat\u2019s not the case. It might not be very convenient\u2026\u201d Li Ran pointed his finger awkwardly.\u201cMe?\u201d Yue Jianli looked in the direction of his finger.Her clothes had been pierced through. Her snow-white skin and the pink insides were exposed.\u201cAh!\u201d She cried out in alarm and hastily covered her body, her pretty face turned crimson in an instant.\u201cYou, you, you, cover your eyes. Don\u2019t look!\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Li Ran reached out his hands and covered his eyes. His five fingers opened, and his eyes blinked between them.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Yue Jianli was filled with shame and anger. She stepped on her sword and tore through the air.\u201cI\u2019ll let you go for now. I-I-I will kill you another day!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52: Spirit Fruit! Xiao Qingge\u2019s Choice!Li Ran rubbed his chin as he looked at Yue Jianli\u2019s fleeting figure.\u201cReally white~ but the problem is that it\u2019s a little small and needs more development\u2026\u201dIt was indeed as he had expected.Yue Jianli was very strong. She was simply not on the same level as Song Qingsong.That torrential rain sword was definitely not her strongest trump card, but it was enough to cut an ordinary Golden Core Realm cultivator into meat paste.\u201cThat sword is quite famous as well, and its quality is extremely high. At the very least, it isn\u2019t inferior to the Yun Ling Spear, it\u2019s probably just slightly inferior to the spear.\u201dLi Ran lowered his head and looked around. There were broken walls and ruins around him.He couldn\u2019t help but shake his head. \u201cA woman\u2019s destructive power is scary. A good medicinal garden was reduced to this\u2026\u201dLi Ran felt that he had forgotten something. \u201cWhere is Sun Qing?!\u201dHe had forgotten about this girl, she wouldn\u2019t have been killed by the sword, right?Li Ran patrolled around the shattered ground.\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d Xiao Qingge poked her head out from a hiding spot behind the withered tree.\u201dLi Ran heaved a sigh of relief and landed in front of her.Although her face was covered in dust, she was not injured at all. Her clothes were unscathed.\u201cYour luck is good enough, how else can you avoid such torrential rain?\u201d Li Ran said with surprise.Xiao Qingge smiled and said, \u201cI noticed the moment you started fighting, so I hid behind this Spirit Fruit Tree. No matter how crazed Yue Jianli was, she would subconsciously avoid hurting this immortal material.\u201d\u201cSmart.\u201d Li Ran gave a thumbs up.\u201cHehe, I\u2019m an expert in hiding,\u201d Xiao Qingge proudly replied.To be able to survive alone for five days in the Grand Myriad Mountain Range, one had to rely on one\u2019s adaptability and sixth sense.\u201cYou said just now that this is a Spirit Fruit Tree?\u201d Li Ran asked.\u201cMm.\u201d Xiao Qingge nodded. \u201cAccording to the Immortal Record, the Spirit Fruit is full of life, yet it grows on the withered tree. It can be deciphered into the meaning that one\u2019s life and death are intertwined to each other.\u201d\u201cAs for this Spirit Fruit Tree, in the hundred meters radius, not even a single spirit herb can grow. It\u2019s probably because the Spirit Fruit Tree has taken the vitality of the surrounding place.\u201d She wasn\u2019t someone who would rashly intrude into the secret realm and had made sufficient preparations.\u201cYou know quite a lot\u2026 Then do you know how to pluck this thing off?\u201d Li Ran asked.\u201cSpirit Fruit is different from other immortal materials, it doesn\u2019t require any techniques, even mortals could easily harvest it\u2026 It\u2019s just that it has a small requirement for the pickers.\u201d Xiao Qingge replied.\u201cWhat requirements?\u201d Li Ran said curiously.Xiao Qingge became a little bashful as she stated in a shy tone, \u201cThe Spirit Fruit is abundant in Yang essence. It can only be picked from the place where one\u2019s Yin essence is still present. Otherwise, most of its medicinal properties will be lost\u2026\u201d\u201cIt has such a monstrous request?\u201d Li Ran sized up Xiao Qingge. \u201cCan you do it?\u201d\u201cIf not, I\u2019ll catch Yue Jianli and make her pick the fruit.\u201dThat girl had a cold expression on her face. She obviously wasn\u2019t interested in men, and her vital yin was, for sure, intact.\u201cOf course, I can do it!\u201d Xiao Qingge stomped her feet in embarrassment, \u201cI\u2019m not that kind of woman!\u201d\u201cAlright, please begin your performance.\u201dHuu~ Xiao Qingge calmed down and carefully picked the fruit.The instant the fruit left the branch, the entire withered tree collapsed and instantly turned into ash.The mission was completed.As for where the dust would fly, it would all depend on a good fortune if the next living Spirit Fruit can emerge.Xiao Qingge held the Spirit Fruit in her hands; she could feel the vigorous life within it.This was what she had risked her life to find. It was also the key to whether she could recover her talent and re-embark on the path of cultivation.She looked at the fruit and then Li Ran. She reached out her hand and said, \u201cHere you go.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Li Ran was stunned. \u201cIsn\u2019t this what you\u2019re looking for? Why are you giving it to me?\u201dXiao Qingge shook her head. \u201cThis Spirit Fruit isn\u2019t mine, it\u2019s yours.\u201d\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for you, I would\u2019ve already turned to a corpse in the wilderness. I wouldn\u2019t have had the chance to enter the secret realm, and I wouldn\u2019t have been able to reach this level.\u201d\u201cTherefore, this Spirit Fruit should belong to you.\u201dLi Ran scratched his head and said, \u201cBut you picked this fruit.\u201d\u201cWithout me, you would have other methods to pick the fruit,\u201d Xiao Qingge replied. \u201cIt has nothing to do with me.\u201dLi Ran smiled, \u201cAlright, then it\u2019s mine. Can\u2019t I give it to you?\u201dAfter getting along with Xiao Qingge for the past few days, he witnessed her unyielding spirit despite being on the verge of death several times. Even this made him gasp in admiration at her persistence and strength.Even if it was from the fruit of his success, this fruit should still belong to her.Xiao Qingge was silent for a long time and said seriously, \u201cI still can\u2019t take it.\u201d\u201cWhy? Don\u2019t you risk your life for it?\u201d He really couldn\u2019t understand.Xiao Qingge stuffed the spirit fruit into his hand, her eyes filled with tenderness.\u201cThe inheritance is about to occur, a fierce battle is unavoidable. Even though you\u2019re very strong, this is an ancient emperor\u2019s inheritance. You can not underestimate the severity of the upcoming trials.\u201d\u201cSong Qingsong is clever and cunning, Yue Jianli had her secrets. What if something unexpected were to happen\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can save your life at the critical moment if you keep the Spirit Fruit.\u201dLi Ran looked at the tenderness in her eyes, and his heart suddenly felt a bit awkward. \u201cThen what will you do?\u201dXiao Qingge smiled and gently pressed against his chest. She listened to the vigorous heartbeat.\u201cOnly if you live will all the things I\u2019ve done be meaningful.\u201d\u201cIf you can successfully walk out of the secret realm, and this fruit has not been used yet, then come to Wuyang City to find me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for you\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53: The Third Trial: A Palace in the Sky!In the end, Li Ran was unable to convince Xiao Qingge. He helplessly accepted the Spirit Fruit.\u201cBut you have to give me an address, right? How else would I find you?\u201d He asked.Xiao Qingge smiled and said, \u201cWhen you reach Wuyang City, you will certainly find me. At that time, I will give you a big surprise.\u201dAccording to her understanding, Li Ran would go to the Xiao Family to fulfill the engagement.At that time, the two of them would naturally meet.\u201c Tch , you\u2019re quite mysterious\u2026\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201d\u2014Two hours later.The trial was finally over.Everyone was taken away by an irresistible force and returned to the empty area in front of the Herb Mountain.Most of them were covered in dust. They were in an extremely sorry state, and some of them were already dead.Ever since Li Ran had started the robbing chain, no one had gone to collect medicine seriously. Everyone had completely fallen out from each other.You stole from me, I stole from you, all of them happily fought.However, there weren\u2019t many people who had truly harvested immortal materials. At this moment, the atmosphere was murderous, and everyone was vigilant as they fiercely swept their eyes around everyone.This round of trials made them realize that they had to fight with their lives on the line if they didn\u2019t want to get eliminated.There was no such thing as a fellow Righteous Path cultivator. Everyone was an enemy.Yue Jianli had changed into a new set of clothes and wore the same green outfit.She stood in a corner, not saying a word as she held her sword in her arms. She exuded an unapproachable aura.Only when her eyes inadvertently met Li Ran\u2019s eyes would a trace of shame and anger flash in her eyes. But then, it was replaced by an ice-cold killing intent.At this moment, ripples arose in the space.\u3010The end of the second trial\u2026\u3011\u3010Six people advanced, two eliminated.\u3011Then, beams of white light shot out, enveloping everyone who had advanced. The ones who were eliminated were Xiao Qingge and a disciple of the Zheng Yi Sect.Their expressions were completely different. The face of Zheng Yi Sect\u2019s disciple was pale, his expression gloomy, his eyes filled with unwillingness.Xiao Qingge, on the other hand, was in a daze, as if she had picked up something valuable.\u201cI\u2019m leaving, you must be careful~\u201d she obediently waved her hand.Li Ran said helplessly, \u201cYou should be worried about yourself.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll wait for you!\u201d\u201c\u2026Understood.\u201d After bidding farewell to Xiao Qingge, Li Ran formed a hand seal, and a streak of light struck the body of the Zheng Yi Sect disciple.Pu!The Zheng Yi Sect disciple coughed up a mouthful of blood. He turned around and looked at Li Ran with confusion.\u201cBig Brother, what enmity did we have? I\u2019m already eliminated!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Li Ran said, \u201cBut I have to take preventive measures\u2026\u201d\u201c???\u201d The disciple was sent out of the secret realm with a question mark on his face.The other six had successfully advanced to the next round.\u2014Those who were eliminated would be teleported to the entrance of the secret realm. \u00a0Xiao Qingge was a mortal and she was as fragile as a flower.Leaving with another cultivator was very dangerous for her. That was why Li Ran used his technique to seal the opponent\u2019s cultivation.Although it wouldn\u2019t last long, it would provide enough time for Xiao Qingge to escape. He had even covered Xiao Qingge\u2019s body with runes, and all sorts of techniques were used on her to guarantee that she would be able to walk out the Grand Myriad Mountain Range safely.\u201cShe really places her trust on me. She\u2019s not afraid that I won\u2019t give her the Spirit Fruit\u2026\u201d Li Ran smiled and shook his head.What a silly girl.\u2014The white light dissipated.Everyone was teleported to another place.In front of them were floating stairs towering upwards. At the end of the steps lies an incomparably luxurious palace.The palace stood in the clouds, its cornice stood straight, and a golden tile that glazed as brightly, emitting an imposing solemness.This was a true sky pavilion.Everyone was stunned by the scene before them.A palace in the sky?After all, the existence of this secret realm was more than a thousand years old. What kind of good fortune and might was required to maintain this state?Yue Jianli\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly as he gradually became excited. This was the legacy of the Ancient Emperor!Furthermore, he was an Immortal Emperor whose strength was unparalleled and surpassed the entire world.Otherwise, there would be no such thing!Ripples rose in the air:\u3010The Third Trial: A Palace in the Sky\u2026\u3011The trial was very simple.The remaining six people had to climb the cloud stairs in front of them. The first three people to reach the top would successfully advance and enter the final trial.\u201cSo simple?\u201d Everyone\u2019s hearts jumped.Those who had come this far were not fools.The previous two rounds were already in full swing. How could this round be so simple?There must be something hidden within the rules!Li Ran came to a realization.The first trial tested one\u2019s strength, while the second round tested one\u2019s eyesight and experience. The goal of this trial was for six people to compete with each other.The one who was able to take the lead must not be the fastest, but the strongest!\u201cWhat about the final trial?\u201dLi Ran looked at the magnificent palace on the clouds and guessed, \u201cThree people left to fight. Will only one person remain at the end?\u201dThe heavens and earth were merciless, the immortal path was ruthless.The path to immortality was always paved by corpses.Only by stepping through the river of blood and mountain of corpses and ascending to the peak of the Nine Heavens could one become an undying emperor.Li Ran and Yue Jianli looked at each other from a distance.The battle spirits in both of their eyes were burning!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54: Climb the Cloud Stairway, Step on the Immortal Path!\u3010The trial begins now!\u3011The words dispersed, and everyone regained their mobility. However, no one made a move.Who knew if there was a trap in front of them, or if there was a sneak attack from behind?Everyone was on guard against each other, and no one dared take the first step.\u201cA group of rats.\u201d Yue Jianli snorted coldly. She took the lead to ascend the steps.The crowd blushed in embarrassment.When they saw that someone had set the precedent, they followed suit.Li Ran was the last one on the stairway.As soon as he stepped on the stairway, he slightly frowned. He felt pressure down on him. The higher he climbed, the stronger the pressure was, making it impossible for him to advance at full speed.\u201cI see.\u201d Li Ran looked at the floating palace.There were over a thousand steps, how terrifying would the pressure be at the very end?\u201cThen there\u2019s no need to worry.\u201d Li Ran held his hands behind his back and walked one step at a time. It was as if he was on a hiking trip.Now, everything has become useless.He understood that only the strongest could reach the end.However, the others did not think so.One by one, they erupted with qi and climbed upward under pressure. None of them wanted to fall behind.Boom!An ear-piercing explosion rang out accompanied by a cry!\u201cSong Qingsong, you\u2019re a righteous path cultivator, yet you dared to launch a sneak attack!\u201dSong Qingsong sneered, \u201cYou moved too slowly. It\u2019s better to go home and rest!\u201dThen, he sent the other party down the steps. This place had already been sealed, prohibiting all flying abilities. That person could only howl and fall down.Then, he was wrapped in white light and teleported out of the secret realm. When the crowd saw this, they immediately shivered.\u201cSong Qingsong, as the Righteous path, how could you do such a thing?!\u201d\u201cWe only called you Senior Brother Song because we respected you. We didn\u2019t expect you to act so lowly!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re truly embarrassing the Supreme Dao Palace!\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid that we\u2019ll expose your actions?\u201dThe geniuses all stood on the high ground as they all accused Song Qingsong.Song Qingsong snorted. \u201cStop pretending! I don\u2019t believe that you don\u2019t want to do the same too!\u201d\u201cIf I don\u2019t want to be eliminated, I\u2019ll have to find a way to eliminate others!\u201d\u201cBesides, you won\u2019t die even if you were to fall down the stairs. You\u2019ll just be kicked out of the secret realm. Why are you being so pretentious?\u201d After speaking his part, he continued climbing up.Everyone looked at each other in dismay.\u201cWhat he said\u2026 makes sense.\u201dA moment later\u2026Boom boom boom boom!Fighting techniques rolled, the flames were scorching everywhere.\u201cSurnamed Liu, I used to see you as my brother, but you dared to attack me!\u201d\u201cWho would attack me? If you have the guts, fight with me!\u201d\u201cF*ck, which of you threw a banana peel on the ground?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll wait for you outside. I\u2019m not done with you!\u201dA fight broke out on the stairway. The stairs became abnormally noisy. Li Ran shook his head disdainfully at this sight.This was the righteous path cultivators?He finally understood why Leng Wuyan would rather be a devil\u2026\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Li Ran\u2019s voice rang out. The geniuses who were kicking each other came to an abrupt stop.Everyone stopped and opened a path in unison. Li Ran walked up slowly with his hands behind his back.Just a few steps later, a fight broke out behind him once again, as the people bombarded each other with their abilities.They knew very well that there were only three winners of the trial.They knew that the first two winners were undoubtedly Li Ran and Yue Jianli.What they wanted to snatch was the final spot. Therefore, no one dared to touch Li Ran.Li Ran was quiet as he climbed up step by step. Before long, he met Song Qingsong, who was sweating profusely.They had already reached the second half of the stairway, and the pressure that was emanating was extremely great. Even Golden Core Realm cultivators would have great difficulty taking every step.When Song Qingsong saw Li Ran, he immediately shivered.\u201cIt\u2019s over, why is this devil behind me? You can\u2019t just beat me down!\u201d He swallowed his saliva and moved to the side to give way. He stretched out his hand and said, \u201cPlease\u2026\u201dLi Ran walked past him without any intention of making a move.Huu~Song Qingsong heaved a sigh of relief as his heart fell to the ground.Although he didn\u2019t know why Li Ran had let him go, his advancement was definitely secured!Li Ran continued to climb the steps. He felt that the pressure on his body was getting heavier and heavier. He had to use his full strength to resist.Especially after reaching the last ten steps, it was as if the entire world was pressing down on him, and every fiber of his bone and muscle was screaming.Li Ran took a step forward.Boom!There seemed to be a clanking sound in his ear, shaking him to the point that his soul became unstable.Another step.His muscles were bulging, his veins were bulging, and his joints were exploding.The more he walked forward, the more pressure he felt, and his figure became even more hunched. When he stepped onto the second last step, Li Ran felt that he was seeing stars. His soul seemed to have suffered a heavy blow, and he almost couldn\u2019t standstill.White smoke emitted from his body. This was a sign that his qi had reached its limit.Yue Jianli was right beside him. She was similarly pressed to the ground, her face drenched in sweat.\u201cThese steps had their own set of principal. The stronger the person\u2019s cultivation, the greater the pressure they would face\u2026\u201dYue Jianli gritted her teeth. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to climb this last step!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55: I refuse to accept this!Yue Jianli.A genius born with sword intent.A direct disciple of one of the top sects, the Myriad Sword Sect.The youngest leader in the sect\u2019s history.She was ranked second on the Heavenly Genius* Rankings. It wasn\u2019t because she was weaker than first place, but because she rarely fought with anyone, making it hard to guess her strength, and Li Ran even had more titles than her.[TLN: I changed the name from Genius Rankings to Heavenly Genius Rankings for more consistency with the CN version.]The Devil Saint, the reincarnation of a great emperor, a peerless genius with a dao tattoo, a future Demon Owl Giant who will trample on the entire vast lands.Due to his background in the Devil Sect, he wasn\u2019t listed on the Heavenly Genius Rankings.Many people guessed that Li Ran would definitely be on par with the first place.However, only those who had come into contact with him would know that he was an existence that surpassed all geniuses, a genius amongst geniuses.It was precisely these two most outstanding geniuses of the vast lands that were firmly pressed onto the stone steps, and could not even lift their heads.Yue Jianli\u2019s face was pale, her sweat dripped down the stairs. \u201cAs expected of an ancient emperor\u2019s inheritance. Even after thousands of years, this path is still irresistible!\u201dShe had a strong premonition.Although those steps were close to her, it was like a deep abyss. If she took another step forward, she might die.\u201cDon\u2019t you think this challenge is too difficult?\u201d Li Ran suddenly said.\u201cEn?\u201d Yue Jianli was stunned.Actually, she felt the same.If it was just for the purpose of the trial, there was no need to put so much pressure on them.\u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d\u201cThe goal of this trial is not to see who can reach the top, but to let us crawl under his feet to show off his strength and authority!\u201dYue Jianli suddenly understood.\u201cI indeed had this feeling\u2026 According to your words, he didn\u2019t plan to let us reach the top in the first place?\u201dLi Ran nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s the same as the last two rounds. There\u2019s no need to reach the top. The three who climbed the highest should be able to directly advance.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Yue Jianli heaved a sigh of relief.Li Ran glanced at her. \u201cYou seem quite happy?\u201dYue Jianli frowned and asked, \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cBeing held down like an animal and worshipping this damned palace, shouldn\u2019t you feel humiliated?\u201d Li Ran said lightly.A trace of anger flashed in Yue Jianli\u2019s eyes as well, but she immediately said in a dispirited tone, \u201cThis is the rule set down by the ancient emperor. It\u2019s only natural that we should follow it\u2026\u201dWe\u2019re talking about an Ancient Emperor right here! It was only normal to feel respect and fear towards this existence!They were only at the Golden Core Realm. They already took pride in reaching this realm.\u201cWe should? Bullshi*t!\u201dThe veins on Li Ran\u2019s neck bulged as he stood up under the immense pressure!The joints in his body exploded, but his expression was still calm. His figure was as straight as a spear.\u201cDon\u2019t be rash!\u201d Yue Jianli cried out in shock. \u201cOur goal is to enter the final trial. There\u2019s no need for us to try to be brave and kill ourselves!\u201dShe wasn\u2019t worried about him. However, this round was so difficult. How terrifying would the ultimate test be?If Li Ran wasn\u2019t present in the next trial, she wouldn\u2019t have the confidence to complete it. Li Ran looked at the palace in front of him, his voice was cold and malevolent. \u201cHe made us kneel here, but he was sitting high above the clouds like he was looking down at an ant\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Yue Jianli\u2019s pupils contracted.Golden light flickered on Li Ran\u2019s body. A mysterious ancient seal slowly appeared, like a tattoo engraved on his skin.This was the first time he had used the full power of the Heaven Seizing Technique!\u201cI\u2019m going to personally walk into the palace to see if this guy really has three heads and six arms!\u201d Li Ran took the first step!Boom!With a deafening explosion, the clouds were covered with lightning and thunder!It was as if the entire world was pressing down on Li Ran.Yue Jianli immediately felt her body lighten. She knew that the laws were doing their best to stop Li Ran, so they no longer cared about her.However, she did not take the opportunity to reach the top. Instead, she stared at that back in a daze.Blood oozed out of Li Ran\u2019s ears, but his figure was still as tall as a spear. He lifted his leg and then climbed up again.Kacha!A streak of divine lightning struck down, but it was absorbed by the mysterious ancient seal on his body.If the divine lightning wasn\u2019t good enough, it would be replaced by flames, hurricanes, ice spears, and even turned into a weapon that slashed at him. The world\u2019s laws tried to stop Li Ran.Yue Jianli covered her mouth. He was right. The goal of this round of trials was not to let them reach the top but to make them submit.Li Ran attacked with his spear, his lips curled into a crazed smile.\u201cSeize the Heavens and destroy the Heavenly Daos!Replace ten thousand techniques with my technique, and the heaven\u2019s will with my will!My dao heart is firm, my will is immovable. How could you make me submit?!\u201dThe golden light on Li Ran\u2019s body began to shine brightly as he stood on the last step against the barrage of attacks.The world instantly fell silent. All the pressure vanished, and the surging Dao laws receded like a tide.Li Ran smiled smugly. \u201cF*ck you! Aren\u2019t you just\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish his sentence, he limped. Even though this stairway had been weakened after thousands of years, it was not something that a Golden Core Realm cultivator could contend against.At this moment, his meridians were dried up, and his qi source was completely exhausted. Li Ran\u2019s eyes darkened. He couldn\u2019t stand still and was about to fall into the clouds.At this moment, a slender hand firmly supported his back and straightened his body.Li Ran looked at her in astonishment.Yue Jianli turned her head and said in a low voice, \u201cStand firm, don\u2019t let that guy see you as a joke.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56: Yue Jianli\u2019s Decision!\u201cWhat a strange person\u2026\u201d Yue Jianli looked at Li Ran with a complicated expression.According to her belief, most cultivators from the Devil Sect were usually interested in profit, and they would do anything to achieve their goal.However, Li Ran was different. To protect his dignity, he\u2019d rather fight against the emperor\u2019s will. This sort of death-seeking approach truly didn\u2019t seem to be the work of a devil.Yue Jianli couldn\u2019t help but feel admiration for his courage. She didn\u2019t know why, but she didn\u2019t want to see him fall at the very last moment. She couldn\u2019t help but reach out to support him.However, when he recalled that Li Ran had snatched her immortal material and even teased her, she immediately gritted her teeth.\u201cNo matter how much backbone you have, you won\u2019t be able to change the fact that you\u2019re a lowlife!\u201d\u2026Li Ran looked at the palace, a trace of fear flashing in his eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect this stairway to be so strong. If it wasn\u2019t for the strange and powerful Heaven Seizing Cultivation Technique, I probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to ascend.\u201dThe Heaven Seizing Cultivation Technique gave you the ability to automatically cultivate.But if he were to use the technique, it had the ability to swallow ten thousand techniques.The divine lightning that was summoned was completely absorbed by the mysterious ancient seal on his body.However, even though this move was strong, it was not invincible. The stronger the opponent\u2019s attack, the faster the qi consumption.He felt his empty dantian, and couldn\u2019t help but smile bitterly.Yue Jianli stood beside him and looked at him with amusement. \u201cDidn\u2019t you want to defy the heavens and question the Immortal Emperor? Why can\u2019t you hold on anymore?\u201dLi Ran glanced at her. \u201cThat\u2019s better than lying on the ground and being a dog.\u201dYue Jianli was enraged. \u201cWho are you talking about?\u201d\u201cWhoever lies on the ground is a dog.\u201d\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t helped you earlier, you would have already fallen. Do you have any conscience?\u201d\u201cYou wanted to talk about conscience with someone from a devil sect? Are you stupid?\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d The two of them glared at each other angrily.Li Ran was the first to give in. \u201cAlright, I\u2019m just teasing you. Thank you for what you did.\u201dIf Yue Jianli had attacked, she would have had a chance to eliminate him, or even heavily injure him.However, not only did she not do that, she even reached out to support him. It was indeed beyond Li Ran\u2019s expectations.\u201cTch,\u00a0who wants your thanks?\u201dYue Jianli snorted disdainfully, but her lips slightly curved up.Li Ran found a flat ground and sat down. \u201cThis is your only chance to kill me. Are you sure you won\u2019t attack?\u201dYue Jianli sneered. \u201cWho said I wouldn\u2019t make a move? I\u2019ll kill you right after you recover your qi with my sword!\u201d\u201cOh, good luck then.\u201d Li Ran took out a handful of pills, sat cross-legged, closed his eyes, and began to meditate.Yue Jianli was confused. \u201c???\u201d\u201cYou really think I don\u2019t dare to kill you?\u201d She drew her sword and gestured in front of Li Ran for a long time.However, he didn\u2019t react. He didn\u2019t even move his eyelashes.\u201cTch, how boring\u2026\u201d Yue Jianli angrily withdrew her sword.Suddenly, her eyes froze. She saw that Li Ran\u2019s clothes were already in tatters. His muscular body was exposed, and his lines were visible.Her face blushed and she hastily turned around.\u201cDo not look at this indecency, do not look at this indecency\u2026\u201d\u201cWait, that\u2019s not right! He\u2019s already looked at me. Why can\u2019t I look at him?\u201d Yue Jianli angrily turned around and looked righteously.Li Ran\u2019s figure was perfect.All the muscles in his body were bulging, containing a powerful explosive force. However, the lines were clear and smooth, not even the slightest bit of bloat was found.This was a perfect interpretation of what it meant to have the back of a tiger and a waist like a wolf. Yue Jianli\u2019s face turned redder and redder. In the end, her ears were about to release smoke.\u201cDoes it look beautiful?\u201d Li Ran suddenly opened his eyes and asked.\u201cGood\u2026 Pah pah, it\u2019s ugly!\u201dYue Jianli seemed to have been caught red-handed and fled into the distance.Hiding from afar, she patted her chest and tried to calm her intense heartbeat.\u201cHe really is a demon from the Devil Sect. He doesn\u2019t have the least bit of shame!\u201dBecause Li Ran had broken through the world laws, the pressure had completely disappeared. The rest realized that and crazily climbed upwards.Song Qingsong was the first to ascend the mountain. As he stepped onto the ground, the staircase immediately disappeared. The others cried out in alarm as they fell, being sent out of the secret realm midair.\u201cHu~\u00a0Great, I\u2019ve advanced!\u201d Song Qingsong gasped for breath, his eyes filled with ecstasy.He looked around and noticed Li Ran who was meditating not far away. The scene of Li Ran resisting the heavenly lightning was for his eyes to see. His heart couldn\u2019t help but tremble slightly.This demon was too strong!Strong to the point of despair!\u201cIn the end, the inheritance can only be obtained by one person. If he recovers, I will definitely be eliminated!\u201d\u201cRight now, his cultivation is half-crippled. This is my only chance!\u201d Song Qingsong gripped his flying sword tightly and slowly walked towards Li Ran.His expression gradually darkened.Clang!A streak of sword-light flashed and a cut appeared in the ground in front of him.Song Qingsong raised his head and saw Yue Jianli holding her sword with a cold expression.\u201cScram.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57: Basic Role of a ToolmanSong Qingsong frowned. \u201cYue Jianli, what do you mean by this?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t understand?\u201d Yue Jianli\u2019s thumb gently pushed the sheath, and her sword intent surged out. \u201cDo you need me to explain it to you?\u201dSong Qingsong\u2019s hair stood on end. He couldn\u2019t help but take a step back.This woman was not someone to be trifled with!\u201cWhat do you mean by that? As a disciple of the Righteous Path, do you want to protect this devil?\u201d he asked.\u201cRighteous path?\u201d Yue Jianli said disdainfully, \u201cWhat you did inside this secret realm is worthy of these two words?\u201dKilling his companions, seizing others\u2019 spirit herbs, sneak attack on the staircase\u2026Yue Jianli hated him to the extreme.Song Qingsong\u2019s expression turned to embarrassment. However, he forcefully continued, \u201cEven if you look down on me, this inheritance can only be obtained by one person. Could it be that you wish to hand it over to him? If we don\u2019t kill Li Ran, we won\u2019t have a chance!\u201dYue Jianli remained unmoved. She sneered, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you think that if Li Ran has been eliminated, you will have a chance?\u201dSong Qingsong fell silent.He was indeed no match for Yue Jianli. But that was better than facing Li Ran. That fellow was simply too terrifying.\u201cThe trial is getting harder and harder. Since he wanted to keep three of us, he naturally had his reasons. Before we know what the final trial is, Li Ran could not be eliminated.\u201d Yue Jianli had a premonition that the final trial would be extremely difficult.If Li Ran wasn\u2019t here, she wouldn\u2019t have any confidence in passing.\u201cWhen the trial is over, I will kill him myself!\u201d Yue Jianli said hatefully.Song Qingsong scratched his head and felt that something was wrong.It seemed as if these two were not enemies, but\u2026 a young couple arguing?\u2014Li Ran changed his clothes and stood in front of the scarlet door that was more than ten meters tall. He raised his head and looked up at the huge signboard.The two words on the signboard were filled with strength, and they contained the principles of the Grand Dao. With just a single glance, one\u2019s soul was sent into turmoil.Heaven Palace Sect.\u201cThe tone of the writing is not small\u2026\u201d Li Ran shook his head. \u201cHe really thinks of himself as the Jade Emperor*.\u201d[TLN: Jade Emperor is considered to be the ruler of heaven, so Li Ran was probably implying that the one who wrote the board thinks of himself as the best.]Yue Jianli walked to his side, her eyes flashing with surprise.At this moment, Li Ran\u2019s qi was surging and his vitality was as strong as a dragon. Clearly, he had recovered to his peak.\u201cNot even the time for an incense stick to burn has passed? So fast?\u201d Yue Jianli sighed in her heart. \u201cWhat a monster\u2026\u201dLittle did she know that this secret realm with abundant qi was simply the best nourishment for his heavenly arts.Not only did Li Ran\u2019s recovery speed become faster, but even his cultivation was also accelerated.He looked at Song Qingsong and grinned. Song Qingsong\u2019s heart trembled. He hastily lowered his head and broke out in cold sweat.\u201cHe didn\u2019t know what had just happened\u2026\u201d\u3010The end of the third trial\u2026\u3011\u3010Three people advanced\u2026\u3011\u3010The final trial begins now!\u3011As soon as the words in the air dissipated, the magnificent palace slowly opened. Looking over, the only thing present was deep darkness. It was impossible to see anything.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Li Ran directly walked inside.The two hurriedly followed. Inside was a corridor, surrounded by darkness that could not be dispelled. Apart from the candlelight on both sides, there was no light.The three walked along the corridor for a long time before finally reaching the end.A magnificent palace was before them.The atmosphere was solemn and the bright pillar was pristine.On the scarlet pillar lies an engraved golden dragon that could enchant one\u2019s soul.On the ceiling was a large pearl that illuminated the entire space.However, this was not the main focus.The three stared blankly at the huge coffin in front of them.What was going on?No throne, nor an Immortal Emperor, only a coffin?\u201cCould it be that this is not an Immortal Emperor\u2019s bedchamber, but an Imperial Mausoleum?\u201d Song Qingsong was confused.Li Ran and Yue Jianli looked at each other. They felt that something was wrong.This coffin was of the Immortal Emperor? To bury himself in the bedchamber was simply too discrete.Yue Jianli asked, \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t the trial content been released yet?\u201dAfter some thought, Li Ran said to Song Qingsong, \u201cGo, open the coffin.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Song Qingsong was startled, and he shook his head like a rattle drum. \u201cThis place is filled with strangeness. I dare not go.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t open the coffin lid, I\u2019ll open your head. Choose for yourself,\u201d Li Ran coldly said.He had repeatedly let this guy go, waiting for this moment. As a toolman, one should understand their own role.Song Qingsong shuddered as he turned to Yue Jianli. However, the other party held her sword in silence. Clearly, she had tacitly agreed to this outcome.\u201cFine, I\u2019ll go!\u201dSong Qingsong was helpless. He could only grit his teeth and walk to the black coffin. He grabbed the coffin board and pushed it hard.Kacha!A crack appeared in the coffin as the black mist came out. At the same time, words appeared in the air.\u3010The final trial initiated.\u3011\u201cAs expected, as long as you can open the coffin, the trial will start\u2026\u201dHowever, just immediately after, the three were stunned.The texts in the air:\u3010First Trial: Eliminate the Demons\u2026 Participant: Li Ran, Yue Jianli.\u3011\u3010Second Trial: Kill the Intruders\u2026 Participant: Song Qingsong.\u3011The final trial by fire was actually two different missions!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58: Team Division, The Demon From the Coffin!\u201cAs expected.\u201dYue Jianli said cautiously, \u201cThis coffin is not housing an Immortal Emperor, but a demon!\u201dAccording to the rules of the trial, the three of them were divided into two teams.Among them, Li Ran and Yue Jianli were tasked to kill the demon in the coffin.And since Song Qingsong had touched the coffin, he would automatically form a team with the demon, while the mission was\u2026 to kill Li Ran\u2019s team.\u201cNo wonder three people advanced this time. It turns out that it was all arranged.\u201d Li Ran said coldly.Yue Jianli was stunned for a moment, then understood.After the three of them had advanced, the one who was forced to touch the coffin would definitely be the weakest.The two remaining experts would automatically form a team.It meant that from the perspective of the secret realm\u2019s creator, this demon was extremely powerful, powerful enough to close the gap between Song Qingsong and them!\u201cSo\u2026 What exactly is this place?\u201d The three focused their gazes on the enormous coffin.Apart from the black mist that was constantly flowing out from the gap, nothing happened for a long time.\u201cI must have made a mistake. How could I form a team with the demon?\u201d Song Qingsong turned around and prepared to leave. He didn\u2019t want to become enemies with these two freaks.It was at this moment that a hand covered with fur suddenly stretched out from the gap and firmly grabbed his wrist.\u201cWhat is this\u2026\u201d Before he could finish his sentence, he was pulled into the coffin.\u201cAh!\u201d Song Qingsong\u2019s heart-wrenching scream rang out from the coffin.Only after an entire ten minutes had passed did the screams gradually stop.Bang!The coffin lid was overturned, and a monster slowly climbed out.Its body was like a tiger, and its fur was exuberant. However, it had a human face, and a pair of wild boar-like fangs were visible from its mouth. It looked extremely ferocious.As for that human face, it was none other than Song Qingsong!However, his eyes were now green and white, and he did not even have any eyes. It was obvious that he had lost consciousness.\u201cTiger Body and a human face\u2026 It\u2019s Tao Wu!\u201d Yue Jianli\u2019s pupils contracted.Tao Wu*, also known as Ao Yan, was a legendary ancient demon.[TLN: Tao Wu actually translates to the legendary beast, but I figured out leaving it as pinyin would make it sound better.]A demon known for its arrogance and ruthlessness.Although the demon in front of them only had a trace of its bloodline, even such a thin bloodline would make it an extremely terrifying existence!\u201cEat, eat, eat!\u201dBoom!The Tao Wu made a hoarse and unpleasant sound as its saliva flowed down the corner of its mouth.The Tao Wu, which had been sealed for thousands of years, desperately desired the taste of the flesh.\u201cThis the final trial? Isn\u2019t this too outrageous!\u201d Yue Jianli\u2019s expression was bitter.\u201cIt\u2019s just an animal. Just kill it\u201d Li Ran took out his silver spear and rushed over.At this moment, his spear intent surged along with the demon\u2019s roar. One man and one demon were beaten into a ball.Yue Jianli cleared her thoughts and her eyes became calm as she sheathed her sword to join the battle.Boom boom boom!For a moment, the hall was filled with rumbling sounds as her Sword Qi surged!Their faces became darker as they foughtThis demon\u2019s strength was simply terrifying!Not only was it extremely powerful, it was also immune to dao techniques. The black mist that was emitted was able to devour qi.Every time they fought the demon, they would lose a large amount of Qi.Furthermore, because of Song Qingsong\u2019s existence, it had obtained a Golden Core Realm cultivation and was able to use the Supreme Dao Palace\u2019s technique!\u201cI can\u2019t continue like this. If I were to continue fighting, I\u2019d exhaust myself to death!\u201d A resolution flashed in Yue Jianli\u2019s eyes.She withdrew from the battle and quickly formed an incantation in her hand. She softly muttered.Ji Ji!The divine light on her longsword gushed and rapidly expanded in the air. In the end, it turned into a gigantic sword!The huge sword was aimed at the demon, and the pure sword intent filled the entire space.Li Ran looked at her in astonishment.This girl really had some tricks up her sleeve!Yue Jianli forcefully pressed down, \u201cCut!\u201dThe huge sword moved in response, carrying an incomparably sharp sword intent as it whistled through the air!The giant sword was unblemished, and it was capable of killing the demon!Roar!The Tao Wu\u2019s eyes were filled with ferocity, and it reached out to grab the sword!Yue Jianli\u2019s eyes flashed with joy.\u201cAlthough this demon is strong, my sword is not\u2026\u201d Before she could finish her sentence, her eyes became wide open, as if she had been strangled.All she could see was a large hand grabbing the blade. No matter how much the sword resisted, it was unable to break free.The Sword Qi was instantly devoured by the black mist.\u201cI-Impossible!!\u201dA sinister smile appeared on the Tao Wu\u2019s face. It hardened its finger and with a pinch, the giant sword was directly broken!The giant sword returned to its original form, turning into a longsword that flew back into the ground, gently trembling.Yue Jianli took a step back, she was clearly flustered.This demon was too strong. It was not an existence that a Golden Core realm cultivator could deal with.Roar!The demon gave another ferocious roar before flying over towards Yue Jianli.It was too late for her to retreat.Bang!At this moment, Li Ran sent the Tao Wu flying with a single strike. It crashed into several pillars before stopping.He glanced at Yue Jianli. \u201cAre you alright?\u201dYue Jianli silently shook her head, her face was pale as a paper. Clearly, she had lost confidence.On the other side, the Tao Wu unsteadily stood up and stared at Li Ran fiercely.\u201cEat, you!\u201d\u201cYou really think you can eat me?\u201dLi Ran stabbed his silver spear on the ground and rolled up his sleeves. \u201cIf I don\u2019t wring your head off today, my surname won\u2019t be Li!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59: I, Li Ran, am called Xiao Lei Gong!Roar! Roar!After hearing Li Ran\u2019s provocation, the demon was infuriated. It let out an earth-shaking roar.Its figure continued to grow, and in the end, it smashed the ceiling into pieces.In front of this ten-meter-long demon, the two of them were as insignificant as gravel.Its ugly face was filled with sinister killing intent.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYue Jianli gulped, \u201cWhat should we do now?\u201dLi Ran scratched his head. \u201cHe went berserk from just a few words. This fellow\u2019s temper is pretty bad.\u201d\u201cIts body is too strong, and its bloodline provides immunity to dao techniques. How should we kill it?\u201d Yue Jianli frowned.Li Ran thought about it. \u201cDemons are usually afraid of the wrath of the heavens. Thus, we could use lightning to strike them.\u201d\u201cLightning strike?\u201dYue Jianli didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cEven at this time, you still want the heavens to take care of it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m quite good at lightning. I don\u2019t need the heavens,\u201d Li Ran said seriously.\u201cAh?\u201dYue Jianli was stunned. \u201cYou know how to summon lightning? What a joke\u2026\u201dRoar!The Tao Wu raised its head and roared. It raised its enormous beast palm and slammed it down.The two of them retreated.Boom!The entire hall trembled, and large pieces of rubble were scattered everywhere. Li Ran said coldly, \u201cDon\u2019t stay around here. I\u2019m going to hack this beast!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Yue Jianli was dumbfounded.Li Ran held the silver spear in his hands. The spear shone with divine light that went as far as three feet, as he made his way towards the monster.In front of this wild beast, he was like a moth pouncing on fire.\u201cLi Ran, be careful!\u201d Yue Jianli\u2019s heart tightened.However, the next scene completely shocked her. Li Ran formed a hand incantation and stepped into the void.\u201cThe protector of Three Realms, I welcome the Five Emperors.\u201d The cold voice reverberated in the hall, followed by the fluctuation of formless energy that darkened the entire hall.From the tattered ceiling, dark clouds were gathering in the sky.She raised her head and a trace of fear flashed in her azure-white eyes.\u201cThe Gods Assembly, Grant me the lightning\u2019s control!\u201dThe dark clouds seemed to have been stirred by a formless hand, slowly forming a huge vortex.The air was extremely oppressive!Roar!The Tao Wu realized that something was wrong and turned to escape. However, the pressure of the heavens and the earth pressed it down on the ground, depriving even its ability to lift its finger!\u201cThe demon is terrified, and its spirit is dead.\u201d Li Ran\u2019s clothes fluttered, his entire body wrapped in golden light, like a blazing sun in the sky.The heavy clouds above him emitted a terrifying pressure, and thunder rumbled within them as thunderclaps wrapped around them!\u201cWhat is this\u2026\u201d Yue Jianli looked at the golden figure, her eyes filled with shock.The demon\u2019s heart split apart as if the entire sky was pressed against its body. Blood continuously seeped out from its seven orifices.\u201cLightning exists in me, the Thunder God is omnipresent!\u201d Li Ran roared, his silver spear pointed straight into the sky.Lightning condensed within the dark grey vortex, and the aura from the primordial spirit filled the heavens and the earth!Roarrrr!\u201cGolden Lightning Curse \u2013 Extinction!\u201d The ancient incantation echoed within the hall.Suddenly, the wind stopped and the world fell silent.The vortex rapidly rotated, lightning gathered and fell.Li Ran\u2019s black hair wildly danced amidst the storm, just like a Heavenly God.Heaven and earth were unfeeling, and everything perished.The lightning that pierced through the heavens enveloped the demon.Roar, roar, roar!The Tao Wu howled in pain, as lightning pierced through its body, decomposing every cell.Its body began to crumble, scattering like fine sand in the wind.The demon disappeared.It really did.Its body was decomposed into the smallest molecule by the heavenly lightning, leaving not a single trace behind.Li Ran, too, was stunned.This was the ability of a technique from a super treasure chest?Its power was too monstrous!\u2026\u2026Li Ran descended from the sky, his face slightly pale. Yue Jianli stared at him blankly. \u201cWhat kind of ability is this?\u201dCommunicating with the world, and summoning the heavenly lightning?Was this an ability a Golden Core Realm practitioner could use?Li Ran shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ve already told you. I, Li Ran, am called Xiao Lei Gong*. I\u2019m adept at using lightning.\u201d[TLN: Xiao Lei Gong \u2013 Little Thunder Lord]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Yue Jianli lowered her head, her expression bitter.\u201cIf he wanted to kill me, I would probably already be dead now? How laughable that I wanted to win against him\u2026\u201dThis was the first time her proud Sword Heart had tasted defeat.Li Ran was too strong, strong to the point of despair.Thinking back to how godly his figure was back then, was he really the same person who had teased her earlier?She couldn\u2019t help but be a bit silly.\u2026\u2026The lightning dissipated, and the hall became a complete mess. Song Qingsong was lying on the ground on his last breath. He was constantly coughing up blood.He had absorbed most of the power of the Golden Lightning Curse, yet he managed to survive.However, his internal organs were almost charred by electricity. His body was scorched, and his injuries were extremely serious.Li Ran walked up to him and squatted down. He sighed and said, \u201cI can\u2019t even kill you. Your luck is really good, comrade toolman.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60: Li Ran, I will definitely kill you!Song Qingsong looked at Li Ran with fearful eyes.At this moment, he had been seriously injured; his cultivation had been demolished like a fish on the chopping board.\u201cI was forced! The demon took control of my body. I didn\u2019t know anything at all!\u201d he explained in panic.In fact, he had always been very clear-headed. He even took the initiative to share his qi with Tao Wu\u2026However, how would they find out about this?Li Ran said indifferently, \u201cYou wanted to kill me earlier, right?\u201dSong Qingsong\u2019s heart tightened. \u201cYou\u2019ve misunderstood. How is that possible! How would I dare to attack you!\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Li Ran looked at him. \u201cI\u2019ve had many opportunities to eliminate you before. Do you know why I\u2019ve kept you alive until now?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Song Qingsong had a bad premonition.\u201cBecause eliminating would be too easy for you, I want to squeeze your values dry and then send you to die.\u201d Li Ran smiled.Song Qingsong felt as if he had fallen into an ice cellar.\u201cYou can\u2019t kill me! I am a direct descendant of the Supreme Dao Palace. My master is Venerable Hao Yue. If you kill me, you definitely won\u2019t face any good consequences!\u201d his voice was hoarse.Yue Jianli also huffed, \u201cLi Ran, you can\u2019t kill him.\u201dLi Ran\u2019s brows twitched. \u201cDo you fancy Song Qingsong, that\u2019s why you stand up for him repeatedly?\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense are you saying?!\u201d Yue Jianli said angrily, \u201cHow could I possibly fancy such trash!\u201dShe looked as if she had been greatly insulted.Li Ran snorted, \u201cWho knows, there might even be someone who fancies such trash.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not one of them. I\u2019m content with what I have!\u201d\u201cWhy are you yelling so loudly?\u201d\u2026Song Qingsong was speechless.Hearing the two of them arguing, he almost spat a mouthful of blood.\u201cYou really don\u2019t treat me like a person\u2026\u201dHowever, as long as he could survive, what was the point of being insulted?When he returned to the sect, he would definitely make them pay.\u201cAt that time, the person I killed would be planted on Li Ran, and then the news that he had obtained the Immortal Emperor\u2019s inheritance would be released\u2026 Hehe, the righteous path cultivators won\u2019t let him grow!\u201cAs for Yue Jianli\u2026 a crime of joining hands with the Devil\u2019s Sect\u2019s Sheng Zi and harming one\u2019s comrade\u2026 She definitely won\u2019t be able to escape!\u201d Song Qingsong sneered in his heart. His eyes became even more sinister.\u2014Li Ran frowned. \u201cSince you hate him, why are you stopping me?\u201dYue Jianli glared at him and said, \u201cSong Qingsong is a direct disciple of the Supreme Dao Palace. His soul is bound with a divine jade. If you kill him, the Supreme Dao Palace will soon find out!\u201d\u201cOf the ten people who entered the secret realm, nine of them are from Righteous Sects. Only you, a person of Devil Sect, can undoubtedly kill him!\u201d\u201cThe Supreme Dao Palace won\u2019t let you off!\u201d Although Song Qingsong\u2019s strength was ordinary, he had an extraordinary reputation in the Mortal Realm due to his frequent presence.Now that he had died at the hands of a fiend, it was akin to slapping the face of the Supreme Dao Palace!Although Youluo Temple was very powerful, the Supreme Dao Palace was not a weakling.Furthermore, if a top sect was determined to deal with a Golden Core Realm cultivator, there was simply no way to escape!Li Ran couldn\u2019t hide in the sect forever, right?Li Ran rubbed his chin and looked at her. \u201cSo\u2026 are you worried about me?\u201d\u201cW-who cares about you? You saved my life. I clearly have a grudge\u2026\u201d The more she said, the less confident she became.Li Ran looked at her in amusement, \u201cHas anyone told you that you are quite cute sometimes?\u201d\u201cI-I am cute?!\u201d Yue Jianli\u2019s face instantly turned red.\u201cI-I\u2019m not cute!

You still don\u2019t know who I am?\u201d\u201cThe Immortal Emperor?\u201d Li Ran and Yue Jianli looked at each other, their hearts pounding.Could this person be the Ancient Immortal Emperor?Yue Jianli asked carefully, \u201cMay I ask for your esteemed name?\u201d\u201cHahaha!\u201d The old man\u2019s laughter echoed in the hall. \u201cIgnorant child! I am the Immortal Emperor from ancient times, the Burning Heaven Emperor!\u201d\u201cBurning Heaven Emperor?\u201d Yue Jianli covered her mouth and exclaimed in alarm, \u201cYou are the Burning Heaven Emperor who had conquered the entire world?!\u201dHe was a real big shot!Rumor had it that he controlled more than ten types of Heavenly Flames, and dictated an era.This secret realm was actually the inheritance of the Burning Heaven Emperor!Even if she was indifferent, it was unavoidable that her heart would be moved at this moment.Li Ran, on the other hand, didn\u2019t move. He crossed his arms as he observed the old man.\u201cDidn\u2019t the Immortal Emperors of ancient times already disappear? Why are you still here?\u201dThe elder stroked his beard and said, \u201cThis emperor\u2019s true body has already left for outer space, only leaving behind a strand of this emperor\u2019s willpower to guard this secret realm, waiting for someone destined to arrive.\u201d\u201cThen why did we both advance? Who does this inheritance belong to?\u201d Li Ran followed up and asked.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dThe old man rolled his eyes and said, \u201cIt\u2019s because both of you are the destined one. Each person can claim half of the inheritance! Don\u2019t worry, this one\u2019s cultivation is vast. Even if it\u2019s half of the inheritance, it\u2019s enough for you to ascend to the Emperor Level!\u201d\u201cHalf of the inheritance?\u201d Li Ran felt that something was wrong.At this moment, a \u201cding\u201d sounded in his mind. A system prompt sounded:\u3010Mission issued.\u3011\u3010The Fiendish Red Fox is pretending to be the Burning Heaven Emperor, hoping to steal a physical body to leave the secret realm. Please kill it!\u3011\u201cYou really are fake!\u201dLi Ran sneered.At this moment, the old man urged, \u201cDon\u2019t waste your time. Which one of you will come first to accept the inheritance?\u201dHe looked very anxious.Yue Jianli also sensed that something was wrong and quietly pulled Li Ran\u2019s clothes.\u201cIsn\u2019t quite right\u2026\u201dLi Ran didn\u2019t seem to notice. He hurriedly said, \u201cI\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll claim it first!\u201d\u201cLi Ran!\u201d Yue Jianli wanted to remind him, but he turned around and winked at her.She immediately reacted and shut her mouth.\u201cAlright, then you can relax and open your heart\u2019s door. I will give you the inheritance!\u201dThe old man\u2019s hand shone with bright red light as he slowly pressed down on Li Ran\u2019s hand.Seeing that the red light was about to touch him, the old man\u2019s eyes grew even more excited. Suddenly, a large hand gripped his wrist tightly.\u201cEn? What are you doing?\u201d The old man frowned.\u201cYou\u2019re a Fiendish Red Fox, correct? You really like impersonating others!\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d When the old man heard this name, his expression instantly changed. He hastily tried to retract his hand.However, when Li Ran grabbed his hand, a dazzling white light suddenly appeared!\u201cDemon Thrashing Fist!\u201dThe white light was like a strong acid, instantly corroding the old man\u2019s wrist, as the old man hissed and emitted wisps of black smoke.\u201cAh!\u201d The old man let out a heart-wrenching howl. He didn\u2019t have the appearance of an immortal daoist like before.\u201cThe Burning Heaven Emperor? Do you really think we\u2019re fools?\u201d Li Ran laughed coldly.This Godly technique was a demon\u2019s nemesis.In addition, the old man was extremely weak and his body was easily corroded by the white light.\u201cLet me go, please let me go. I will pass the inheritance to you!\u201d The old man howled and begged for mercy.However, Li Ran remained unmoved and activated his fist attack to the extreme.The old man\u2019s body was like the first snow meeting the blazing sun. He quickly melted under the white light, and in the end, he turned into a crimson fox demon.It laid on the ground struggling.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Yue Jianli covered her mouth in surprise.Actually, the Fiendish Red Fox was the same as the Tao Wu. They were demons that had been sealed here. However, because the seal had been loosened, it had managed to find a chance to escape.However, it had been heavily injured as a result, and its strength was nowhere to be found.Although it had left the coffin, it was still trapped in this secret realm.This time, the Fiendish Red Fox happened to catch up to Li Ran and the others who came to seek fortuitous encounters. He had come up with a plan to pose as the Burning Heaven Emperor.It attempted to escape from the place and turn into a new leaf through the body of others.Unfortunately, it was easily seen through by the system\u2026The Fiendish Red Fox\u2019s body trembled, and its voice was sharp and ear-piercing. \u201cI beg you, please spare my life.

The world in his eyes instantly became clear and vivid.It was like a transformation from a black and white television to a 4K screen.\u201cLi Ran\u2026\u201d Yue Jianli called out to him.He turned around, but in the end, he almost got a nosebleed!\u201cF*ck?!\u201d\u201cThe ability had such a function?!\u201dThis ability was too crazy!\u201cBut this girl\u2019s figure wasn\u2019t bad! Her waist was slim and her skin was so white that it seemed to reflect light\u2026 It\u2019s just that I can\u2019t afford it.\u201dYue Jianli waved her hand in front of his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m talking to you. Why are you so dumbfounded?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t shake it. I can\u2019t take it\u2026\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dLi Ran snapped back to his senses and gulped. \u201cNothing.\u201dHow could this be a Disillusioned Eye? This was clearly an LSP* eye![TLN: LSP \u2013 Dirty old man]This ability absolutely must be kept a secret. Otherwise, he would probably be pursued by all the female cultivators\u2026Yue Jianli did not think too much about it and asked, \u201cI said, how do you know that the Burning Heaven Emperor is a fake?\u201dLi Ran smiled, \u201cTo be able to set up the world law that we must submit to during the stairway trial meant that the Burning Heaven Emperor is an arrogant and domineering person.\u201d\u201cAs for that old man, he was laughing like a baby. He was eager to pass on the inheritance to us. How could he have the aura of an Immortal Emperor? It\u2019s obvious that there\u2019s something fishy.\u201dYue Jianli nodded in agreement.This was what she found strange.This Burning Heaven Emperor was simply too anxious for something.\u201cThen how did you know that it was a Fiendish Red Fox?\u201d Yue Jianli couldn\u2019t understand.Li Ran shrugged his shoulders. \u201cBecause he has a foxy smell.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYue Jianli almost spat a mouthful of blood.\u201cThe hell would I believe you, ah!\u201d If he didn\u2019t want to explain, he could just say it rather than making such a weird excuse.Yue Jianli rolled her eyes and didn\u2019t ask any further.\u201cAlas, the Fiendish Red Fox is dead. No one knows where inheritance is.\u201d She sighed helplessly.This Fiendish Red Fox was sinister and cunning.If they could kill it, they should kill it. Otherwise, it would set a cunning plan against them.Unfortunately, the two of them had experienced a great deal of hardship, yet in the end, they had brushed past the inheritance.\u201cThe inheritance\u2026\u201dLi Ran\u2019s eyes glowed with deep golden divine light as he scanned the hall.Under the effect of the Disillusioned Eye, all the illusions in front of him disappeared, returning to their original state. He could even see the flow of Qi around them.Under the throne ahead, a blazing light attracted his attention. Li Ran walked over and took out a metal box under the throne.It was engraved with complicated patterns as if the Great Dao could immerse one\u2019s mind into it.When he opened it, he saw an ancient book and a key lying inside.Yue Jianli came over to take a look and was stunned.\u201cThe Burning Heaven Incantation?!\u201dThis was a technique that made the Burning Heaven Emperor famous. He cultivated the technique to the peak and could set the sky ablaze with a wave of his hand!Furthermore, because it was an Immortal Emperor cultivation technique, it did not contain any flaws. It was enough to allow one to cultivate to the Emperor Level!\u201cIt turned out that this place was really a secret realm that the Burning Heaven Emperor had created. The inheritance also exists\u2026\u201dAt this moment, the voice of Great Dao sounded in their ears:\u3010Immortal Emperor\u2019s inheritance couldn\u2019t be given lightly. Two treasures, one take each\u2026\u3011\u201cNo wonder the two of us advanced. So this inheritance can only be taken by one person?\u201dHe glanced at Yue Jianli, only to see her staring at the Burning Heaven Incantation with longing.\u201cWant it?\u201dYue Jianli hesitated for a long time, but still shook her head and replied, \u201cNo, this belongs to you.\u201dWithout Li Ran, she would have already died at the hands of the demon. Even if she was lucky enough to pass the trial, it was highly likely that she would have been plotted against by the Fiendish Red Fox\u2026She was not qualified to take this inheritance, however, Li Ran picked up the ancient book and tossed it to her.Yue Jianli caught the book, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dLi Ran said casually, \u201cOne for each person. The cultivation technique is yours, and the key is mine.\u201dYue Jianli was stunned. No one knew what the key meant.On the other hand, the Burning Heaven Incantation was a true Immortal Emperor level cultivation technique!\u201cThis is an Immortal Emperor\u2019s cultivation technique\u2026\u201d she couldn\u2019t help but remind him.Li Ran shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in it anyway. If you don\u2019t want it, then you can use it as toilet paper.\u201dHe was indeed not interested in this cultivation technique.Does an Immortal Emperor\u2019s cultivation technique matter to him if it requires him to bitterly cultivate? Was it more tempting than a technique that can let him cultivate 24/7?Moreover, Li Ran was certain that the level of Heaven Seizing Technique would definitely far exceed this Burning Heaven Incantation!\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Yue Jianli was angry and stupefied.To use the cultivation technique of an Immortal Emperor as toilet paper? He really is\u2026She didn\u2019t hold back and nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201dHowever, the look in Li Ran\u2019s eyes became more complicated.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. You deserve it,\u201d Li Ran said.Although he had saved Yue Jianli\u2019s life, the other party had also helped him at the Cloud Stairway.Moreover, he had already seen her everything\u2026It was hard to say who owed who.Most importantly, Li Ran\u2019s intuition told him that this key was extremely valuable!\u201cThe question is, how should I use it?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63: True Inheritance: Burning Heaven Sacred Flame!Li Ran pushed his \u2018Disillusioned Eye\u2019 to the limit and searched the hall for a long time.He didn\u2019t even notice any hidden mechanisms.\u201cHow does this key exactly work?\u201d Li Ran looked carefully at the bronze key in his hand.The key was roughly the size of a palm with a green and black shade. The patterns on it were complicated and exquisite as if some sort of ancient secret resided in it.Li Ran poured his qi into the key.Buzz!The key began trembling.The green and black layer began to fall off from the key, replaced by a blazing light.At the same time, Li Ran\u2019s qi was rapidly depleting, continuously being absorbed by the key.\u201cWhat the hell?!\u201dJust when he felt that he was about to be sucked dry, the layers on the key completely fell off and his entire body disappeared from the spot.Looking at the empty hall, Yue Jianli was dumbfounded.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u2014Li Ran opened his eyes and saw that he was in an extremely large space.In front of him stood a sea of blazing inferno!The fiery red lava erupted, and from time to time, it would spew out flames. The strong smell of sulfur in the air, coupled with the extremely high temperature, made it difficult for him to breathe!In the middle of the lava, there was a raging inferno. The flame had a strange golden color.Li Ran\u2019s pupils contracted. \u201cIt\u2019s a Heavenly Flame!\u201dFlames condensed by cultivators were called a spirit flame. Flames born from heaven and earth were called Heavenly Flames. It was countless times more powerful than a normal spirit flame.The Heavenly Flame was not only able to refine transcendent-grade medicinal pills, but it was also able to increase one\u2019s battle prowess.All the cultivators desire the Heavenly Flame.However, even though the Heavenly Flame was extremely tempting, it was also accompanied by fatal danger.If one does not have sufficient strength to forcefully subdue the fire, they might very well die on the spot!\u2014Li Ran flew and arrived in front of the Heavenly Flame.The golden flame was like a liquid, flowing in space.The powerful might emitted from it caused Li Ran\u2019s heart to palpitate.\u201cGolden flame, a flame that flows like a stream of water\u2026 If I\u2019m not mistaken, this should be the Burning Heaven Sacred Flame.\u201dThat was the legendary Heavenly Flame controlled by the Burning Heaven Emperor. It was said that even qi and space could be completely incinerated by it.\u201cSo this is the true inheritance.\u201d Li Ran suddenly understood. Apart from the Heavenly Flames and lava, there was nothing else in this space.After using the key once, it had already disappeared.The meaning was very simple:Those who had seen the Burning Heaven Sacred Flame have to either subdue it or perish here.\u201cNo wonder he said that the \u2018Immortal Emperor Inheritance\u2019 could not be given lightly\u2026 This Burning Heaven Emperor is truly ruthless!\u201dLi Ran was certain that there was no other exit.He could only wrap his right hand with the Demon Thrashing Fist and carefully touch the Heavenly Flame.The instant he touched it, the white light of the Demon Thrashing Fist was instantly destroyed.The berserk Heavenly Flames surged into his body, rushing through his hands and burning his meridians.Li Ran endured the heart-wrenching pain as he circulated his Heaven Seizing Technique.The Heaven Seizing Technique: Devour Ten Thousand Techniques!The golden ancient seal appeared and faced off against the Burning Heaven Sacred Flame.The two foreign forces happily fought.As for the owner of the body, Li Ran greatly suffered.His burned meridians were quickly restored by the Heaven Seizing Technique.Burn, recover, burn, recover\u2026The heart-splitting pain made him wish he could faint right away.However, the power of the Heaven Seizing Technique kept him awake.After an unknown period had passed, the brutal confrontation quietly stopped. Li Ran\u2019s numb eyes gradually restored their life.His clothes had long been burned clean. His muscles were bulging, and his body was covered with a golden divine tattoo.As he breathed, he spat out a burst of white energy.Li Ran clenched his fists and felt the qi surging within his body. He couldn\u2019t help but sigh in relief!\u201cNice!\u201dThis miserable confrontation caused his meridians to be completely reformed.Regardless of whether it was gathering qi or recovery speed, they were all several times faster than before!Most importantly, there was a golden flame tattoo in his right palm. Li Ran gently pressed his right hand against the wall.Boom!Golden flames surged out, instantly vaporizing the entire rock wall.\u201cToo strong!\u201d Li Ran couldn\u2019t help sighing.The might of the Heavenly Flame would increase as its owner\u2019s strength increases. When he reached a higher realm, how terrifying would the flame be?All of a sudden, the entire space began to tremble. Huge rocks fell, and magma surged up like a fountain.\u201cNot good, the Heavenly Flame was subdued and the secret realm is about to collapse!\u201dLi Ran\u2019s palm erupted with flames, and his figure disappeared.\u2014On the other side, Yue Jianli was floating in the air, staring blankly at the collapsed palace.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201dBoom!The entire space suddenly collapsed, a trace of panic appeared in her eyes.Suddenly, Li Ran appeared and pulled her into his embrace.Yue Jianli raised her head and opened her mouth slightly. A huge golden giant appeared and held the entire dome and tightly protected the two of them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64: Flying Cloud Peak\u2019s Upheaval!The Grand Myriad Mountain Range.The two sharp-toothed tigers were about to descend from the opening, prepared to enjoy the vast land.Suddenly, a huge golden palm fell down from the sky and smashed down on a large tree!The golden fist slowly loosened and a man and woman laid on the golden palm.It was Li Ran and Yue Jianli.After the Heavenly Flame was taken away, for some reason, the secret realm didn\u2019t immediately send them out. Instead, it began to collapse.How terrifying was the destructive power of a separate space?Li Ran had to exert all his strength and used the unique manifest to barely survive the crushing.Even so, he had already reached the point where he had run out of fuel.He fainted on the spot.The golden hand dispersed, and the two of them fell to the ground. Yue Jianli\u2019s face was dirty and her appearance was very miserable.However, she couldn\u2019t care less. She hastily leaned against Li Ran\u2019s chest and listened nervously.Only after hearing the powerful heartbeat did she let out a sigh of relief.Roar!The two Sharp-Toothed Tigers reacted.This was like a pie falling from the sky.They had just used up their energy and two proteins appeared in front of them for replenishment. They were simply elated.Swish!The sound of cutting through air rang out as the two tigers\u2019 heads rolled far away. Their eyes were still filled with longing for food.Yue Jianli put her sword back into the sheath. Her knees went limp and she collapsed to the ground.\u201cHe saved my life again\u2026\u201dShe looked at Li Ran with a complicated expression, and her pretty face suddenly flushed.His clothes were burned by the Heavenly Flame, so he didn\u2019t have time to change.Right now, he was lying naked on the ground.Yue Jianli\u2019s face turned red as she turned her head.\u201d This Sheng Zi is sleeping comfortably on his own\u2026\u201dAt this moment, the sky was getting dark, and demonic beasts were howling.Yue Jianli gritted her teeth and stood up to help Li Ran up. She placed her arm on him.Feeling the heat coming from his body, her face blushed like she had a fever.Having made a decision, she stepped on the flying sword and headed towards the sky.\u2014Flying Cloud Peak.Supreme Dao Palace.The deacon who was in charge of overseeing the direct disciples and the Divine Soul Jade Plate was patrolling around as usual.As a top sect, who dared to provoke a direct disciple of the Supreme Dao Palace?Not to mention killing one.The so-called monitoring was just a routine.The deacon walked around for a while. Just as he was about to close the door and leave, a \u201ccrack\u201d suddenly rang.A bad premonition arose in his heart, and when he heard this, he looked over and saw that a soul jade plate had shattered!The direct disciple Song Qingsong died!Venerable Hao Yue was enraged.The entire Flying Cloud Peak was filled with fury!\u2014The Southern territory of the Vast Land.Inside a luxurious manor, few figures with profound auras sat together.Their names were enough to shake the earth.Joyous Unity Sect, Yin Corpse Dao, Youluo Temple, the sect masters of the top Devil Sects were all gathered here!It could be called a grand ceremony of devils!As for Leng Wuyan, she sat in the highest position and coldly glanced at the crowd.\u201cSect Leader Leng, the righteous practitioners is now too strong. The Devil Dao alliance was established to protect everyone\u2019s interests. Why are you against this?\u201d A young man dressed in white robes spoke up.A beautiful female slave was rubbing his shoulders.He is the Sect Master of Joyous Unity Sect, Liu Xunhuan!Leng Wuyan looked at him with disgust.\u201cBoth dressed in a white robe, Ran\u2019er was so handsome and masculine, yet Liu Xunhuan is so feminine!\u201d\u201cSect Master Leng?\u201d Seeing that she didn\u2019t reply, Liu Xunhuan couldn\u2019t help but frown.Leng Wuyan said with indifference, \u201cAs I\u2019ve said, whatever you want to do has nothing to do with the Youluo Temple. I won\u2019t stop you, nor will I participate.\u201d\u201cEveryone is from a Devil Sect, so how can you stay out of this?\u201d Liu Xunhuan said.Leng Wuyan sneered. \u201cIf you think we\u2019re on the same boat, then you\u2019re mistaken.\u201d\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Liu Xunhuan frowned.\u201cBack when the Righteous Path alliance attacked my sect, did one of you stand out and say that you wanted to advance and retreat with my sect?\u201dLeng Wuyan\u2019s gaze swept over everyone. \u201cYou\u2019re unable to withstand the pressure now, yet you want to drag my Youluo Temple into the hot waters? Do you really think I\u2019m a fool!\u201d Her voice wasn\u2019t loud, but it was deafening!The devil sect cultivators were embarrassed by her words, and they didn\u2019t know what to say.Liu Xunhuan was about to say something when his eyes suddenly met Leng Wuyan\u2019s eyes. It was as if he had fallen into an ice cellar.That sheer killing intent was completely undisguised.Leng Wuyan stood up and calmly said, \u201cRegardless of whether it\u2019s the Devil Sect or the Righteous Sect, anyone who wants to strike the Youluo Temple will meet my sword first!\u201dBoom!A boundless sword qi swept past, creating a terrifying ravine between her and the crowd.The entire manor was split in half!Leng Wuyan had already disappeared.Liu Xunhuan gulped, \u201cThis witch\u2019s temper is still as violent as before! Her cultivation is still as strong as ever\u2026 If she continues like this, she will probably be single for the rest of her life.\u201d\u201cShh! You dare to say this? Don\u2019t drag me down with you!\u201d\u201cThis is the truth\u2026\u201dThe few great devils started gossiping.\u2014Leng Wuyan stood on the cliff and looked at the mountains in front of her. Her eyes were full of thoughts.\u201cI don\u2019t know what Ran\u2019er was doing now. Does he miss me \u2026\u201dLi!The eagle fell and the jade tablet fell into her hands. Leng Wuyan looked carefully and couldn\u2019t help but be stunned.\u201cRan\u2019er actually entered the secret realm?\u201d As she continued reading, her eyes instantly turned cold.\u201cSupreme Dao Palace?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65: Treatment of an Immortal Emperor\u2019s Inheritor!Five hundred miles outside Wu Yang City.A remote house inside a small valley village\u2026Li Ran slowly opened his eyes.Looking at the thatched ceiling above him, he was stunned for a moment before he heaved a sigh of relief.\u201cI\u2019m not dead!\u201dHow terrifying was the power of the collapse of the secret realm?He exerted all of his strength to activate the abnormal phenomenon, exhausting all of his qi.He even used the Heaven Seizing Technique to absorb the impact.Only then did he barely survive.However, due to his overexertion, he had also fallen into a coma.\u201cI don\u2019t know how long I have been unconscious\u2026\u201dLi Ran wanted to sit up, but his right hand was pressed down. For a moment, he couldn\u2019t raise it.He turned his head to look, immediately stunned. Yue Jianli was sleeping soundly by the bed.Her fair and delicate face was beautiful and dreamy under the sunlight. A faint red light fell down on her little face, giving her a truly adorable look.Her long eyelashes trembled slightly, and a few strands of hair fell on her white cheeks.Just a scene from a painting.Li Ran gulped, \u201cWhen this girl doesn\u2019t have a sword in her hands, she is actually quite pretty\u2026\u201dHe wanted to pull his hand away, but Yue Jianli subconsciously grumbled and hugged him even tighter.Hiss!Soft!\u201cWhat a fellow. You want to test a cadre with something like this?\u201d He took a deep breath and used a bit more strength.\u201cEn?\u201d Yue Jianli opened her eyes in a daze.Li Ran\u2019s body froze. He looked straight ahead as if he was an old monk.\u201cYou\u2019re awake?\u201d Yue Jianli\u2019s eyes flashed with joy as she suddenly realized that her arms were entangled with his.She blushed and hastily stood up.Li Ran also silently withdrew his arm.The air was quiet, and the atmosphere was awkward.Cough cough\u2026Li Ran cleared his throat and asked, \u201cWhere are we?\u201d\u201cThis place is called Yun Xiao Village. I\u2019m worried that if we were to enter Wu Yang City with your status, we might attract unnecessary problems, so I temporarily place you here,\u201d Yue Jianli replied.Li Ran nodded. \u201cHow long have I been unconscious for?\u201d\u201cToday is the third day.\u201d\u201cSo long?\u201d Li Ran rubbed his hair.This secret realm was truly dangerous.Although the immortal opportunities were alluring to many, it was often accompanied by enormous risks.He had only managed to escape unscathed with all his treasures and divine abilities. If it were any other Golden Core Realm cultivator, their corpse would probably have turned cold.However, his harvest this time was filled with alms pots*, so he did not risk it for nothing.[TLN: I couldn\u2019t find any reference to this, but the meaning is probably a fruitful harvest]Golden Lightning Curse.Disillusioned Eye.Burning Heaven Sacred Flame.As well as a large number of immortal materials and spirit herbs in his storage ring.The rewards of the system and the rewards of the secret realm made Li Ran\u2019s strength soar.He was about to get out of bed, but suddenly, with a hiss, he frowned.He felt as if all his meridians had been blocked. He could not feel any strength at all.Yue Jianli took a pillow and placed it behind him. \u201cYou can\u2019t feel your meridians because you\u2019ve over-exhausted your qi. You\u2019ll need time to sort it out. You can\u2019t be in a hurry.\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d Li Ran said.Yue Jianli shook her head and said with seriousness, \u201cI should thank you. Thank you for not leaving me behind. Otherwise, I would have turned into smithereens.\u201dShe would never forget the shocking scene of the golden palm protecting her.Li Ran was capable of escaping by himself, but he chose to spend a bit more effort to escape with her. Otherwise, his injuries might not have been so severe.Li Ran shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s just a simple matter. There\u2019s no need to thank you. Moreover, this matter\u2026 might happen because of me.\u201d\u201cBecause of you? Why?\u201d Yue Jianli couldn\u2019t understand.Li Ran said, \u201cThe existence of the Secret Realm is for the sake of finding someone destined. In the end, we obtained the inheritance. That is the inheritor of the Immortal Emperor. However, not only did the Secret Realm not send us away safely, it collapsed. Don\u2019t you find it strange?\u201d\u201cEn\u2026\u201d This was what Yue Jianli was confused about.In the end, the formation seemed to be eager to bury the two of them.This wasn\u2019t the sort of treatment an Immortal Emperor\u2019s inheritor should receive.\u201cYou mean\u2026\u201dLi Ran snorted coldly, \u201cIt\u2019s the world\u2019s laws!\u201d\u201cWhen I ascended the Cloud Stairs, I disobeyed its authority, so the world\u2019s laws wanted me to die!\u201dThe final collapse was obviously caused by those strands of the world\u2019s laws.It couldn\u2019t stop Li Ran from obtaining the inheritance because this was the Immortal Emperor\u2019s arrangement. However, it could use the loopholes of the natural laws to make Li Ran die at the final moment.Unfortunately, Li Ran was fine, but he disappeared along with the secret realm.\u201cI see!\u201d Yue Jianli suddenly understood.If that was the case, then it would make sense.Li Ran sneered. \u201cYou bastard, you still want to die with me? Dream on!\u201dHe spoke too forcefully, causing his injuries to be affected. He coughed violently for a moment.Yue Jianli laughed, \u201cAll right, I know you\u2019re powerful. Rest well.\u201dShe got up and left.After a while, she walked over with a bowl of soup.\u201cThis is the concoction I made with the Spirit Recovery Pill. You can drink it.\u201d\u201cYou made me soup?\u201d Li Ran quivered.He said cautiously, \u201cYou didn\u2019t poison the medicine, right?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her pink cherry lips were small and charming.\u201cYou know so much\u2026\u201d\u2014Li Ran\u2019s meridians were in a mess. It was very difficult to even raise his hand.Yue Jianli carried the concoction and fed it to him with a spoon.Her eyes wandered and she did not dare to look at him.Li Ran said with a smile, \u201cYou, a righteous fairy, actually took care of a demon\u2026 If the word of this gets out, even the Righteous Path cultivators won\u2019t be able to tolerate you.\u201d\u201cHmph, I\u2019m just repaying your favor!\u201d Yue Jianli said coldly, \u201cIt\u2019s unfair to fight you now.

It\u2019s just a joke. We\u2019re all comrades-in-arms. Come, hold my hand.\u201d Li Ran smiled and extended his hand. \u201cWe live and die together\u2026\u201dYue Jianli\u2019s eyes softened and she said with a stern face, \u201cThen why do you want to shake hands?\u201d\u201cThis is the traditional etiquette of my hometown. If we shake our hands, we are friends,\u201d Li Ran explained.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYue Jianli glared at him. \u201cIsn\u2019t your hometown Wu Yang City? Why haven\u2019t I heard of such etiquette?\u201d\u201cWhy would I deceive you? As the saying goes: Take my hand and you\u2019re my girlfriend\u2026 I mean a good friend.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re spouting nonsense again.\u201d Yue Jianli stuffed her delicate hand into his palm. Feeling the intense heat, her face became feverish again.\u201cLi Ran, when I thoroughly study the Burning Heaven Incantation, I will definitely defeat you!\u201d\u201c\u2026Good luck.\u201d\u2014At that moment, the sound of knocking sounded from the door and a middle-aged woman walked in.Seeing this, she couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cThat\u2019s great. Young man, you\u2019re finally awake!\u201dLi Ran was taken aback. \u201cThis is\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is Auntie Sun who lent us the house. She\u2019s very kind,\u201d Yue Jianli introduced.She did not have any contempt or arrogance just because she was a mortal.Auntie Sun said, \u201cYoung man, you have a good wife. You must treat her well in the future.\u201d\u201cAuntie Sun, you misunderstood. We\u2019re not a couple\u2026\u201d Yue Jianli explained.\u201cHey, these matters, how can it be hidden from me?\u201d Auntie Sun smiled and said, \u201cIf you\u2019re not a couple, would you stay awake to boil herbs for him for several nights? Or feed the medicine to him through mouth-to-mouth?\u201dLi Ran: (\u2299_\u2299)\u201cWhat? Mouth-to-mouth?!\u201d He stared blankly at Yue Jianli.\u201cD-don\u2019t listen to Auntie Sun\u2019s nonsense. It\u2019s nothing!\u201d Yue Jianli stomped her feet in embarrassment and turned around to escape.Her actions proved the truth\u2026Li Ran\u2019s eyes were blank as he laid on the bed like a walking corpse.\u201cI lost my first kiss? Wu Wu Wu, Master, this disciple has let you down!\u201dAuntie Sun smiled kindly and sighed, \u201cHow nice is it to be young!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u2014In the next few days, Li Ran lived in this little Yun Xiao Village.With the existence of the Heaven Seizing Cultivation Method and immortal materials, his injuries were rapidly recovering.Yue Jianli didn\u2019t seem to have anything to do. Every day, other than studying Burning Heaven Incantation, she was just bickering with Li Ran.Actually, she could have left a long time ago, but she felt reluctant to do so for some reason.On the next day, she was drying her clothes in the courtyard, and a burst of sound whistled through the air.A few green-robed swordsmen appeared in front of her.When Yue Jianli\u2019s eyes landed on the leader of the green-robed men, her pupil could not help but narrow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67: Jealous Chen Zhutian!These green-robed swordsmen were the deacons of the Myriad Sword Pavilion. Each of their strengths was incomparably strong.Their leader was a man called Chen Zhutian. He was the son of the First Elder of the Myriad Sword Pavilion, the Inner Sect\u2019s Eldest Senior Brother.Even Yue Jianli, the chief disciple, had to address him as \u201cSenior Brother Chen\u201d.\u201cThe Myriad Sword Pavilion has a unique tracing method, but I didn\u2019t expect them to arrive so quickly.\u201d Yue Jianli\u2019s expression looked grave.Li Ran was still inside the room.\u201cJunior Sister Yue, I finally found you!\u201d Chen Zhutian\u2019s eyes were filled with joy. \u201cEver since you entered the Secret Realm, I haven\u2019t heard anything back. Senior Brother is dying of anxiety!\u201dYue Jianli was the future sect leader. She was also a beautiful and talented woman.As for Chen Zhutian, regardless of his identity, status, or appearance, he was also extraordinary. Therefore, in the eyes of the sect\u2019s elders and ordinary disciples, the two of them were a match made in heaven.As time passed, even Chen Zhutian harbored this thought.After Yue Jianli had entered the Secret Realm, he had not heard from her for a long time. Chen Zhutian was so anxious that he brought a group of deacons to find her.He did not expect to find her in this small village.Yue Jianli said coldly, \u201cThank you, Senior Brother Chen.\u201d\u201cWhen I saw that you were fine, I was relieved.\u201dChen Zhutian looked at his surroundings and frowned. \u201cYounger Sister, why didn\u2019t you return to the sect instead of staying in this small village?\u201dCompared to the Sword Peak with abundant immortal qi, this place was simply in tatters.Yue Jianli said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I just wanted a change of mood so I came to relax here.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dChen Zhutian didn\u2019t think too much about the matter. \u201cThen you can go back with me. Sect Master was still talking about you a few days ago.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Yue Jianli hesitated for a moment and looked a little reluctant.Although she didn\u2019t want to leave, she knew that this was the best choice.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go\u2026\u201d As soon as she finished her sentence, Auntie Sun walked out. \u201cLittle girl, you need to leave? It\u2019s about time to eat. Go after dinner.\u201dYue Jianli shook her head and said, \u201cAuntie Sun, I\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Your husband said his arm hurts and he couldn\u2019t lift it. He asked you to feed him,\u201d Auntie Sun added.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Yue Jianli covered her face helplessly.This guy just happened to cause trouble at a time like this\u2026\u201cHusband?\u201d Chen Zhutian frowned and said, \u201cJunior sister, if I didn\u2019t hear wrong, since when did you have a daoist partner?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a misunderstanding. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Yue Jianli didn\u2019t want to be entangled further.\u201cMisunderstanding? Is this your explanation?\u201dChen Zhutian\u2019s expression darkened as he asked, \u201cSo you\u2019ve been with other men all this time?\u201dYue Jianli frowned and her expression turned cold. \u201cSo what if I am? Do I have to explain things to you?\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Chen Zhutian\u2019s expression darkened even more.\u201cAll right, I\u2019d like to see what dragon is hidden in this small village that can make you care so much!\u201d With that said, he was about to take his men to the house.Zheng!Yue Jianli unsheathed her sword. \u201cLet\u2019s see who dares to enter!\u201dChen Zhutian gritted his teeth. \u201cYou actually drew your sword against me for a wild man?\u201dBoom!A streak of sword intent made a line in front of him!Yue Jianli said icily, \u201cI will make this clear! If you cross this line, don\u2019t blame me for not caring about my fellow disciples!\u201dThe deacons looked at each other.The Chief Disciple and Eldest Brother were going to fight?Then who should they help?Chen Zhutian was in a frenzy.Yue Jianli wanted to attack him for another man?!She had probably been with this man for the past few days. Who knew what happened between the two of them!His face was twisted, jealousy had clouded his judgement.Chen Zhutian took a step forward.Zheng!Yue Jianli\u2019s sword trembled.As long as he crossed this line, this sword would strike him!Seeing her cold eyes, Chen Zhutian\u2019s throat tightened.This was the number two genius on the Heavenly Genius Rankings.Although he was older than her, he might not be able to win if he fought her.Even if he won, he would lose her favorable impression of him.Chen Zhutian\u2019s eyes shifted and he said in a high voice, \u201cIf you have the guts, come out. Don\u2019t hide behind a woman like a soft egg!\u201dHe understood.Yue Jianli must have been deceived by this man\u2019s words. Now, all he had to do was provoke the man and force him to give up!He was a noble Sword Immortal. Could he lose to a village farmer?\u201cCome out if you have the guts. Don\u2019t let me look down on you!\u201d Chen Zhutian put his hands on his waist and shouted.\u201cNoisy.\u201d A faint voice sounded.A huge golden palm appeared, covering the sky, as it slammed towards Chen Zhutian.\u201cWhat?!\u201d Chen Zhutian was startled and quickly retreated.Boom!The huge palm slammed down and the entire mountain shook!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68: Chen Zhutian \u2013 I wish you a happy marriage for a hundred years!Looking at the huge pit in front of him, Chen Zhutian\u2019s calf was trembling.If that palm had hit him\u2026 he would probably have been dead!\u201cThis junior is Chen Zhutian, a disciple of the Myriad Sword Pavilion. Who is Senior?\u201d He asked in a trembling voice.He wanted to identify the opponent\u2019s background first so that he wouldn\u2019t act rashly.However, after waiting for a long time, no one in the room said anything.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say he\u2019s a coward? Why is he a senior now?\u201dChen Zhutian\u2019s expression was awkward. He had not expected that there would be such an expert in this village.He had wanted to prove his strength to his junior sister, but in the end, he was crushed like a fly.\u201cJunior sister, who exactly is in this room?\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but ask.Judging from the might of that palm strike, it must be at least a practitioner of the Nascent Soul Realm!Before Yue Jianli could reply, the male voice sounded once again, \u201cA swarm of flies dare disturb this seat. Scram!\u201dFollowing the sound that rang like a bell, dark clouds gathered above their heads.A majestic might of heaven and earth seemed to envelop them.The aura was terrifying!\u201cF*ck!\u201d Chen Zhutian and the others almost collapsed to the ground.Just a single word could trigger the might of the heavens and the clouds covering the sky?This wasn\u2019t just a Nascent Soul cultivator, this could have been a Crossing Calamity expert!Yue Jianli held back her laughter and said, \u201cSenior Brother Chen, you should leave quickly. The person in the room doesn\u2019t have a good temper. If you were to offend him\u2026\u201dShe deliberately did not finish her sentence.Chen Zhutian was so scared that his legs went limp. \u201cI-I-I-I just remembered that there are still some things that have not been dealt with in the sect. If there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019ll leave first.\u201dAfter saying that, he was about to leave, but Yue Jianli said, \u201cThe senior is in seclusion here. Senior Brother Chen, it\u2019s best not to speak nonsense about what happened here.\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Chen Zhutian nodded. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything today!\u201d\u201cGood. Take care of yourself,\u201d Yue Jianli said.\u201cHold on, hold on!\u201d Chen Zhutian didn\u2019t dare to stay any longer. He took the frightened deacons and fled.After flying for several hundred miles, they slowly stopped.\u201cSenior brother Chen, do you want to report this to the sect master?\u201d A deacon asked while panting.\u201cNo way! If anyone dares to divulge this matter to anyone\u2026 don\u2019t blame me for being rude!\u201d Chen Zhutian snapped at them.What a joke. Wasn\u2019t that a slap to his face?\u201cBut Chief Disciple Yue is staying there\u2026\u201d the deacon said carefully.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Chen Zhutian cleared his throat and said, \u201cAs long as I\u2019m sure that junior sister is safe, then it is up to her to make her own decisions. As her senior brother, I wish her the best.\u201dFaced with a powerful being that was able to manipulate the phenomena of the heavens and the earth, he was no longer in the least bit jealous.At the same time, he swore in his heart:In the future, this small village would be his forbidden area, and he would never step into it again!\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d The deacons looked at him with contempt.Chen Zhutian is such a coward\u2026\u2014On the other side\u2026Yue Jianli walked into the room and saw Li Ran sitting on the chair yawning.\u201cYou just used your divine ability. Is your body alright?\u201d she said with concern.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Li Ran shook his head. It\u2019s just a bluff. I didn\u2019t use much qi.\u201dHis identity was special. If he were to appear with Yue Jianli, he would bring her a great deal of trouble.He couldn\u2019t possibly kill all of her seniors, could he?That was why he had used such a move.\u201cBut that senior brother of yours seems to have something with you, right?\u201d Li Ran joked.Yue Jianli shook her head. \u201cBut I have no interest in him.\u201dShe had no feelings for Chen Zhutian, to begin with. After experiencing today\u2019s events, her hate for him grew to the extreme.\u201cNow that he knows that you have a \u2018husband\u2019 at the Crossing Calamity stage, he probably won\u2019t dare to look at you again.\u201d Li Ran smiled.Yue Jianli\u2019s face turned red, but after thinking about it, that seemed to be the case.She couldn\u2019t help but feel much more relaxed.\u201cLet\u2019s eat.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Li Ran looked around. \u201cWhere\u2019s Aunty Sun? I just saw her.\u201dYue Jianli suddenly remembered something. \u201cAunty Sun is still outside!\u201dAt this moment, the door suddenly opened.Aunty Sun brought a large group of villagers over and excitedly said, \u201cThere, there they are!\u201dYue Jianli was taken aback. \u201cWhat are you doing\u2026\u201dBefore she could finish her sentence, all the villagers were kneeling on the ground, their heads banging against the ground.\u201cWe greet Lord Immortal!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know that Lord Immortal is residing here, this mortal deserves death!\u201d\u201cPlease forgive me, Lord Immortal!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Li Ran and Yue Jianli looked at each other helplessly.\u201cIt seems that we cannot eat this meal\u2026\u201d\u2014Wu Yang City, Xiao Mansion\u2026The travel-worn Xiao Qingge opened the door.The Grand Myriad Mountain Range was located in the southern territory, and they were far away from Wu Yang City. She had to rely on Xiao Clan\u2019s connections in various places, and it took her a few full days to rush back.She had just walked a few steps when she met Butler Fu.\u201cMiss? Why did you only come back now!\u201d Uncle Fu was shocked.\u201cI\u2019ve made a trip. Why isn\u2019t there anyone in the manor? What happened?\u201d Xiao Qingge asked.Uncle Fu hesitated.Under her constant questioning, he whispered, \u201cThe Li family is here to annul the engagement!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69: Pressure on the Xiao Family!Xiao Manor\u2019s parlor.The atmosphere was grave.The Xiao family\u2019s head and the elders were all gathered here, their gazes fixed on a middle-aged man.The middle-aged man, on the other hand, was aloof as he leisurely drank his tea.\u201cBrother Yunhao, we haven\u2019t seen each other for a long time. Why are you here to drink tea today?\u201d Sitting on the main seat, Xiao Nian\u2019s voice was cheerful.Li Yunhao put down his teacup and said with a smile, \u201cFamily Head Xiao, let\u2019s stop beating around the bush. You should already know the purpose of my visit?\u201dXiao Nian\u2019s face immediately darkened.The Xiao Family\u2019s Ancestor had passed away, this was the most vulnerable period the Xiao family had been in.How many families in Wu Yang City were targeting the Xiao family\u2019s meat!The Li family had sent someone over at this moment. Naturally, it would be a joyous matter.There could only be one reason: Marriage Annulment!However, Xiao Nian still held on to his last hope. \u201cBrother Yunhao, please speak frankly.\u201dLi Yunhao indifferently said, \u201cLi Ran is the Sheng Zi of Youluo Temple. There are rules prohibiting marriage. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s difficult to fulfill the engagement with Miss Xiao. In order not to delay Miss Xiao\u2019s marriage, this engagement should be void.\u201dThese words were very beautiful.However, everyone in the Xiao family knew that the sect prohibition was a smokescreen.After all these years, the Li family had never mentioned the engagement. However, when the Xiao Family was on the brink of collapse, they came to annul the engagement for this reason.They clearly did not want to get involved in this mess.Xiao Nian forced a smile and said, \u201cBrother Yunhao, she\u2019s only 18 this year, I\u2019m not in a hurry to talk about her marriage. From what I see, we should think about it a little longer.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t certain that Xiao Qingge would marry Li Ran.However, at this critical juncture, if the Li family stood out to annul the engagement, the Xiao Family would be a piece of fish on the chopping block.With this marriage contract, others would face this deterrent.Li Yunhao shook his head and said, \u201cFamily Head Xiao, you\u2019re a smart person. There\u2019s no need for me to say this. You should know the answer, right?\u201dXiao Nian frowned. \u201cBrother Yunhao\u2026\u201dLi Yunhao raised his hand and snapped, \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll just say it straight. This engagement must be annulled! This is an announcement, not a discussion!\u201dAs soon as he said that, the Xiao family\u2019s face turned pale!Bang!The Third Elder of the Xiao family slammed his hand on the table and said angrily, \u201cYour Li family is going too far! This engagement was set by our ancestors, how could you just give it up with a single sentence? You aren\u2019t putting the Xiao family in your eyes!\u201dLi Yunhao\u2019s expression turned cold as he sneered, \u201cSo what if the ancestors decided on it? Li Ran is no ordinary person!\u201d\u201cImpudent!\u201dThe members of the Xiao Family were extremely furious. But the next moment, they became excited.The source of the excitement was a female voice, \u201cIs this what Li Ran wanted or the Li Family?\u201dEveryone raised their heads and saw Xiao Qingge walking in slowly.\u201cQingge, go back. This isn\u2019t your place to intrude!\u201d Xiao Nian frowned.Xiao Qingge shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s my marriage. Of course, I should be here.\u201dShe looked at Li Yunhao. \u201cElder Li, you haven\u2019t answered my question yet.\u201dLi Yunhao humphed. \u201cSo what? Can you change the truth?\u201dXiao Qingge said indifferently, \u201cIf you want to annul the engagement, you can. Let Li Ran personally annul the engagement. Then, I, Xiao Qingge, will immediately break the engagement!\u201d\u201cQingge!\u201d Xiao Nian\u2019s expression changed.\u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t come?\u201d Li Yunhao narrowed his eyes.Xiao Qingge did not back down and looked at him. \u201cEven though my Xiao Family are facing a calamity, not everyone can step on a marriage contract between two ancestors. How could a mere Hall Elder have the qualifications to annul the marriage?!\u201dHer voice was clear and resounding in the hall.The atmosphere quieted down.\u201cGood, very good!\u201d Li Yunhao laughed angrily. \u201cYou are indeed worthy of being a fairy. Even if you have become a mortal, you still have such an imposing aura!\u201d\u201cThen please remember what you said today. When Li Ran comes to annul the engagement, you must immediately annul the engagement!\u201dAfter speaking, Li Yunhao left with a flick of his sleeve.Xiao Nian sighed. \u201cQingge, you\u2019re too impulsive. When Li Ran arrives\u2026 Hai!\u201dAccording to his thoughts, annulment of the engagement was a matter of certainty.The longer this matter dragged on, the more breathing room the Xiao family had.However, Xiao Qingge had sealed off her escape route.Xiao Qingge looked out of the window and was a little nervous.Although she knew Li Ran was sincere, could he withstand the combined pressure of the family and the sect?\u2014Yun Xiao Village\u2026With Yue Jianli\u2019s careful care and the help of the herbs, Li Ran\u2019s body had almost recovered.Ever since Li Ran displayed his divine power, they had been worshipped by the villagers.Not only was the food delicious, but they were also very respectful towards him.Auntie Sun didn\u2019t dare to joke with them anymore. As soon as she met them, she would say, \u201cImmortal, Immortal.\u201dThis change made the two uncomfortable. So they didn\u2019t want to stay any longer.The next day, Li Ran left behind some banknotes to pay for his accommodation and meals.Without a word, the two of them quietly left the village.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Return to the sect?\u201d Li Ran asked.Yue Jianli shook her head and said, \u201cThe sect has sent a message asking me to go to Mount Feiyun.\u201dIn fact, she had already received this news a long time ago. She just pretended to not know.She was reluctant to leave the Yun Xiao Village.Li Ran sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be able to see you again.\u201dYue Jianli tilted her head and said, \u201cYou and I are different. It\u2019s better off to not see each other again.\u201dShe didn\u2019t know why, but her nose was sour when she said this, and her heart tightened.Li Ran was used to her speech manners.\u201cSince that\u2019s the case, I\u2019d better avoid you\u2026\u201d he said deliberately.\u201cYou dare!\u201d Yue Jianli\u2019s cheeks puffed. \u201cIf you dare to hide from me, I-I will kill you with one strike!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Li Ran smiled and said, \u201cYou only know how to fight and kill. You won\u2019t be able to get married like that.\u201dYue Jianli snorted coldly, \u201cThe sword way is my companion. I don\u2019t need a man!\u201d\u201cAll right, you\u2019re a noble Sword Immortal. Don\u2019t destroy the mortal world, okay?\u201d Li Ran said, \u201cIf there\u2019s no other business, I will leave first?\u201d\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Yue Jianli stopped him and said softly, \u201cYou have to be careful. Song Qingsong\u2019s matter is very serious. I probably have been called to Mount Feiyun for this.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t reveal what happened inside the secret realm.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d better not stay outside for long. When you\u2019re done, you should hurry back to the sect and wait for the matter to die down.\u201d She kept reminding him, her impression didn\u2019t look like a sword immortal at all.\u201cAlright, I got it.\u201dLi Ran rubbed her head. \u201cDon\u2019t you see who I am? Venerable Hao Yue, if he wants to touch me, he has to think twice before taking action.\u201d\u201cTch, you\u2019re the worst\u2026\u201d Yue Jianli\u2019s face turned red, but she did not remove Li Ran\u2019s hand.\u201cThen I\u2019ll really leave this time.\u201d\u201cEn\u2026\u201d\u201cGoodbye, little wife.\u201d\u201cWho, who is your wife!\u201d Yue Jianli was just about to draw her sword when Li Ran had already disappeared without a trace.Her face turned red as she gritted her teeth. \u201cThis pervert, don\u2019t let me catch you next time!\u201dAfter saying this, the corner of her mouth couldn\u2019t help but curl into a smile, her eyes rippling with light. \u201cDon\u2019t let me catch you next time, you rotten egg \u2026\u2026\u201d\u2014Wu Yang City\u2026This was the imperial capital of the dynasty. It was the most prosperous city-state in the Haotian Empire.Flying above the Imperial City was strictly prohibited.Li Ran landed outside the city and walked towards the city gate with his hands clasped behind his back.Wu Yang City\u2019s wall was tall and sturdy. Above the huge city gate lies two words \u2018Wu Yang\u2019 painted in silver and iron shade.The words engraved on the wall stood imposing.It was said that these two words were written by the ancient emperor of the Sheng Clan, who was said to be able to exterminate all demons.The city gate profiling was very strict. Those who entered the city lined up, waiting for the officers to inspect them.Li Ran stood at the back of the line.It was winter, but he only wore a thin white robe, and his face was incomparably handsome. It was obvious that his background was extraordinary.He attracted the attention of the surrounding people.When it was his turn, the soldiers were stunned for a moment. Then, they exclaimed, \u201cYoung Master Li, you\u2019re back?!\u201dLi Ran was stunned. \u201cYou know me?\u201dThe officer smiled fawningly. \u201cYou\u2019re handsome and elegant, like a firefly in the dark. How could I not recognize you?\u201dLi Ran was speechless. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAs the capital of Wu Yang City, there were a lot of cultivators coming and going every day. There was no lack of ruthless murderers.The investigation of the city gate had become a high-risk occupation. If one was careless, one might lose one\u2019s life.For this reason, the officers and soldiers specially prepared a picture book with important people they could not afford to provoke.As for Li Ran, he was on the top. He had a danger level of five stars!\u201cYoung Master Li is here, why aren\u2019t you here to welcome him!\u201dThe officer called out and the others dropped their investigation work. They all ran over.They stood in front of Li Ran and bowed.\u201cYoung Master Li, welcome home!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cTheir postures, I thought I had come to a bathhouse.\u201dLi Ran couldn\u2019t complain and walked into the city under everyone\u2019s respectful gazes.\u2014Standing on the street of Wu Yang City, Li Ran couldn\u2019t help but sigh.The city was prosperous.The road made of bluestone was very wide, and shops were lined on the streets.The palace cornices were filled with ancient charm.The street was crowded with people, and the piercing shouts of the peddlers could be heard.Looking afar, he could see the imperial palace as he climbed up the stairs.The palace in the center was located at the highest vantage point. From a distance, one could observe the resplendent of the palace.The surrounding palaces were situated in different elevations, depicting a scene of a moon surrounded by various arching stars.\u201cThis city is well structured.\u201d Li Ran nodded.This time, he returned to Wu Yang City for two matters.The first matter was to annul the engagement.The second matter was to deliver the Spirit Fruit.Li Ran still valued this agreement.After that period of time, he and Xiao Qingge were genuine friends.Moreover, the other party was worried about his safety and insisted on handing over the Spirit Fruit to him. He attached great importance to this sentiment.However, other than knowing his friend\u2019s name was Sun Qingqing, he knew nothing else.\u201cThat girl didn\u2019t even give me her address. She said that when I arrive at Wu Yang City, I naturally would see her\u2026 she\u2019s so mysterious.\u201dAt that moment, a group of people ran past him.Li Ran grabbed one of them. \u201cBrother, do you know how to get to the Sun Manor?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d The person shook his head and said, \u201cThe Li family has already gone to the Xiao family to set up a challenge at the arena. Why are you still looking for Sun Manor? Don\u2019t you want to watch a lively scene?\u201d\u201cThe Li Family and\u2026 the Xiao Family\u2019s challenge?\u201d Li Ran was stunned.That was a lot of information to digest!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71: You\u2019re Worthy to Represent Me?Xiao Mansion\u2026In the empty space in front of the door was a huge arena.The seats were occupied by a large crowd.They were all onlookers who had come to spectate the liveliness. Their scale was comparable to the Immortal Ascension Convention.Recently, the Xiao Family\u2019s situation was unstable.Their old ancestor passed away, Xiao Qingge fell to the dust, and the Li family broke off the engagement\u2026One explosive piece of news after another pushed them to the forefront.Now that the Li Family had come to challenge them, it was obvious that they wanted to step on the Xiao family.Everyone knew that the annulment of the engagement was very likely!\u2026On the stage, two young men were fighting.The saber-light and sword-light matched each other.The two of them were both Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, so their fight was quite lively.,However, the purple-clothed youth was clearly superior. He took advantage of the opponent\u2019s unpreparedness and hit him in the chest.Pfft!The young man in black coughed a mouthful of blood and was sent flying. He got smashed into the ground.The young man in purple was victorious.This person was Li Sheng, the eldest son of the Li family, Li Ran\u2019s cousin.Li Sheng laughed coldly. \u201cThat\u2019s it? How desperate the Xiao family must be to send this kind of trash to face off against me!\u201dThe surrounding people were also discussing.\u201cThis is the sixth time he\u2019s won, right?\u201d\u201cLi Sheng is truly invincible. No one in the Xiao family can stop him!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a first-class talent and also an inner disciple of a sect. His future is limitless!\u201d\u201cXiao family is really miserable\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, they\u2019re about to become a third-rate family.\u201d\u2026\u201cQingshan!\u201d\u201cQuickly save him!\u201d\u201cWhere are the pills? Bring them!\u201dThe members of the Xiao family hurriedly surrounded Xiao Qingshan and carried him back to his residence. At the same time, they glared hatefully at Li Sheng.How outrageous!Xiao Nian\u2019s expression was ugly, and his brows were filled with black clouds.Last time, the Li family\u2019s elder failed to annul the engagement and returned in defeat. Following that, Li Sheng came to fight them in the challenge arena.To put it bluntly, they wanted to force the Xiao Family to annul the marriage contract.\u201cPatriarch, Qingshan wasn\u2019t a match. I\u2019m afraid no one in the younger generation is his match\u2026\u201d The Third Elder whispered.Xiao Nian clenched his fists.\u201cIf we really are to be swept away by the other party alone, then the Xiao family\u2019s face would be obliterated!\u201dSetting the challenge arena was a rule set by Wu Yang City\u2019s several families.Li Sheng came to the Xiao Family to set up a challenge. The young disciples of the Xiao Family had to accept such challenges. The Elders could not interfere.Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t dare to be so arrogant.Li Sheng kept provoking, \u201cNo way, no way, that\u2019s the level of the Xiao family? Could there be no one left?\u201dThe children of the Xiao family were aggregated.\u201cLet me do it!\u201d\u201cYou dog! You\u2019ve gone too far!\u201dAlthough their cultivation was average, the young men were antagonized by Li Sheng\u2019s provocation.One by one, they jumped onto the stage.However, in just a few moves, they were heavily injured. They spat blood and flew out. Blood had dyed the stage red.Without exception, they were all defeated.The difference in the realm was too great!Xiao Qingge looked at the seriously injured people and her eyes were filled with tears as her body trembled.Anger and powerlessness filled her heart.Li Sheng laughed wildly. \u201cThat\u2019s it? This was the strength of the Xiao family? You can\u2019t even win in a tug of war match. It\u2019s really funny!\u201dAmong the crowd, Li Ran was watching the show.If he didn\u2019t understand wrongly, this farce should be related to the annulment of the engagement.\u201cIs the Xiao Family not willing to annul the engagement?\u201dLi Ran shook his head.Although the Xiao family was rather miserable, what did it have to do with him?He was not interested in meddling in other people\u2019s business.Just as he was about to turn around and leave, a figure suddenly entered his eyes. He was stunned.\u201cWhat? Why is she here?!\u201d\u2014Li Sheng laughed wildly on stage.All of a sudden, the surroundings quietened down. A woman with a stunning expression slowly walked up to the stage.\u201cIt\u2019s actually her!\u201d\u201cXiao Qingge? Didn\u2019t she lose all her cultivation?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Her marriage is about to be annulled, yet she still has the face to come out?\u201d\u2014Even the members of the Xiao family were anxious.With Xiao Qingge\u2019s current condition, wouldn\u2019t she be heading towards her death?Xiao Nian was nervous and was ready to make a move.This was his own daughter.Even if he broke the rules, he couldn\u2019t let anything happen to her!On the stage, Li Sheng laughed coldly and said, \u201cI almost forgot that the Xiao family still has a genius like you. Why? Do you want to fight with me?\u201dXiao Qingge gritted her teeth and said, \u201cLi Sheng, what exactly do you want!\u201dLi Sheng said with a sinister smile, \u201cI heard that you didn\u2019t agree to annul the engagement and shamelessly wanted to marry into my Li Family. I\u2019m here today to see if your Xiao family is qualified enough!\u201dHe looked around. \u201cIt looks like\u2026 Tsk tsk, your family can\u2019t withstand even a single blow!\u201dXiao Qingge clenched her fists. \u201cI\u2019ve made it very clear. As long as Li Ran comes to annul my engagement, I won\u2019t say anything. Why is your Li family so aggressive?\u201d\u201cLi Ran?\u201dA hint of coldness flashed in Li Sheng\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019m Li Ran\u2019s cousin. I can represent him! You have to annul this marriage even if you don\u2019t want to!\u201d\u201cA mere mortal wanted to lay hands on our Li family?\u201dXiao Qingge\u2019s face turned pale. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone too far!\u201d\u201cSo what if I bully you?\u201d Li Sheng said wildly, \u201cEither annul the engagement or accept the challenge. You can choose yourself!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Xiao Qingge was extremely angry.Hearing the cries of the people below the stage, her heart ached.\u201cCould it be\u2026 are you really going to split up with Li Ran?\u201dHer heart was filled with reluctance, but how could she watch her family suffer?For a moment, she fell silent.Li Sheng sneered. \u201cLooks like you\u2019ve chosen to fight? Very well, I\u2019ll give you on your way!\u201dHe brazenly reached out his hand to grab at her with a lightning pace.\u201cQingge!\u201d Xiao Nian\u2019s expression became anxious. Just as he was about to fly to stop him, a sudden explosion rang in his ears.Boom!Li Sheng coughed up blood as he was sent flying.A tall and elegant figure stood in front of Xiao Qingge, his voice cold and fierce.\u201cWho are you to represent me?\u201d\u2014\u2013Author Notes:Before I know it, I have already written 120,000 words and it is time to test the results of this book.Actually, I have nothing to say.Even if there is nothing to say, friends who like this book will continue reading.The most important thing is to make sure that you are reading things you like.Thank you for your support these days.

    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72: Li Ran, Living up to his Demonic Fame!The air quieted down.All eyes fell on the man on the stage.The man wore a white robe and had a peerless appearance. His eyes were filled with killing intent and a hint of disdain.As for Li Sheng, who was insufferably arrogant just a moment ago, his face was as white as paper, and he was paralyzed on the ground, bleeding profusely.Suddenly, someone exclaimed, \u201cLi Ran, he\u2019s Li Ran!\u201dFollowing this cry of alarm, the atmosphere began to boil.\u201cLi Ran is back?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really the Devil Sect\u2019s Sheng Zi Li Ran!\u201d\u201cHeavens, it really is him!\u201d\u201cCould it be that he personally came back to annul the engagement?\u201dThe expressions of the people from different families changed.Li Ran, the son of the Li Clan Patriarch, the direct heir of Youluo Temple, the sect\u2019s Sheng Zi!The one born with a Dao Mark.The reincarnation of an immortal emperor.The number one genius in the vast lands.The only Saint-grade talent in a thousand years\u2026Each and every one of these titles made it impossible for all the geniuses to raise their heads high.Li Ran\u2019s shadow was like a huge dark cloud covering the entire city. Even the Li Family members were dumbfounded.When did Li Ran return?Not only did he suddenly appear, he even attacked and injured Li Sheng. This made them feel that something was amiss.Xiao Nian stopped in his tracks.As he looked at the two figures on the stage, he felt a bit enlightened.\u201cNo wonder Qingge had insisted, so they\u2019ve long since\u2026\u201dXiao Qingge stared blankly at his tall and straight back.This man had once again descended from the sky to save her.\u201cLi Ran, you\u2019ve finally arrived\u2026\u201d Her voice was choked with sobs, tears welling up in her eyes.If he came just a little later, she really wouldn\u2019t be able to hold on.\u201cWe meet again, Miss Sun!\u201d He was clearly blaming her for hiding this fact from him.After spending so much time together, he didn\u2019t know that Sun Qingqing was his fianc\u00e9e!Before, he had felt strange, but he didn\u2019t think much about it. Now, after thinking about her actions, he could explain many things.Xiao Qingge lowered her head in embarrassment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just wanted to give you a surprise.\u201d\u201cSurprise? Shock was more like it!\u201d Li Ran was angry.\u201cAm I wrong?\u201dTears were still on Xiao Qingge\u2019s face, but her smile was brilliant. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s good to see you come back safely!\u201dLi Ran fell silent.Thinking back to the time the two of them spent in the Grand Myriad Mountain Range, a trace of tenderness flashed in his eyes.\u201cI\u2019ll deal with you later!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll let you take care of me later.\u201d Xiao Qingge pinched the corner of her clothes and blushed.Li Ran was speechless. \u201c\u2026\u201dHe turned around and looked at Li Sheng below the stage, his eyes gradually turning cold.Li Sheng only felt that his entire body was about to crack.Xiao Qingge was about to die from his attack, but he was suddenly struck flying by someone\u2019s attack.\u201cWho exactly is it\u2026\u201dHe raised his head and looked up at the stage. He almost threw out a few drops of urine.\u201cLi, Li Li Ran?!\u201cWhen did this devil return?\u201d Li Sheng\u2019s back went numb.Although he was Li Ran\u2019s cousin, it was precisely because of this that he knew how terrifying his cousin was.\u201cBrother Ran, when did you come back? Why didn\u2019t you greet your family?\u201d Li Sheng struggled to stand up with an embarrassed smile on his face.Li Ran smiled coldly. \u201cShould I report back to you when I return to Wu Yang City?\u201dLi Sheng\u2019s heart trembled. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it that way\u2026\u201dLi Ran raised his hand and snapped. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t hear wrongly, did you just say that you wanted to annul the engagement on my behalf?\u201dLi Sheng gulped. \u201cThat\u2019s the family\u2019s order. I was only ordered to do such\u2026\u201d\u201cThen killing Xiao Qingge is also the family\u2019s arrangement?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Li Sheng\u2019s heart trembled, and cold sweat soaked through his shirt.When Li Ran extended his hand, a huge suction force generated, instantly sucking Li Sheng.With one hand holding Li Sheng\u2019s neck, Li Ran\u2019s voice was like a bone-chilling icy wind. \u201cDare to attack my fianc\u00e9e? Li Sheng, are you tired of living?!\u201dLi Sheng\u2019s face turned green and purple as he struggled in the air as if he was drowning.When the Li family saw this, they immediately panicked.\u201cYoung Master Ran, don\u2019t be rash! According to the family rules, it is a grave crime to kill someone from the same family!\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201c Li Ran looked at him. \u201cAre you telling me how to do things?\u201dTremendous pressure was released, directly pressing the deacon onto his knees, sealing his movements.Everyone else\u2019s hearts became cold.It was over.Li Ran had really gone mad.Something big was about to happen.The Li family is a family with many branches.Not everyone was loyal to the patriarch\u2019s lineage.A group of people led by the grand elder would often openly and secretly oppose the patriarch.As the son of the Great Elder, Li Sheng had secretly done a lot of dirty deeds to discredit Li Ran.It could be said that half of Li Ran\u2019s infamy was created by Li Sheng.Li Ran knew this clearly, but he was far away in the Youluo Temple. He did not care about him.Who would have thought that he would be so arrogant?Li Ran clutched his throat with one hand, his voice ice cold. \u201cAs long as the marriage contract has not been annulled, Xiao Qingge is my fianc\u00e9e!\u201d\u201cLi Sheng tried to murder my fianc\u00e9e. He is a person with no ethics, he should repent with his life!\u201d\u201cSince he failed to commit the crime, his death penalty could be forgiven, but it is difficult to leave the living criminal roaming free.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll abolish your cultivation to set an example!\u201d Li Ran\u2019s hand surged out with qi and poured directly into Li Sheng\u2019s body.Surging qi instantly destroyed his meridians.Li Sheng\u2019s body twitched, his eyes turning white as blood flowed out from his seven orifices.Bang!As soon as Li Ran let go of him, Li Sheng smashed onto the arena like mud.His meridians were thoroughly crippled, and his dantian was empty. From this moment on, he had become the mortal he looked down on the most.Even with immortal pills, the cure was useless.When everyone saw this scene, their hearts were filled with despair.This was the son of the Li Family\u2019s Grand Elder, an inner sect disciple!Just because he attacked Xiao Qingge, his cultivation was crippled?Li Ran was indeed worthy of his name!Too ruthless!Li Ran kicked Li Sheng off the stage and smashed him right in front of the Li Family Executor.\u201cBring him back to the Li Manor.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The deacon was so scared that his legs went limp. How could he dare to disobey Li Ran\u2019s orders? He picked up Li Sheng and quickly left.Li Ran narrowed his eyes as he swept his gaze down the stage.The disciples of the other families all avoided his gazes, and none of them dared to look at him.They were all secretly thinking about whether they had offended Xiao Qingge or not, but they must not let this fiend come knocking on their doors.Fortunately, Li Ran didn\u2019t say much. He turned around and walked with Xiao Qingge.As everyone looked at the bloody arena, a thought swept past their hearts.The Xiao family couldn\u2019t be offended!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73: I think of you as my sister, but you wanted to seduce me?Su Manor\u2019s living room.From the Xiao Family\u2019s head to the outer sect\u2019s elders, all the higher-ups were gathered here. The crowd was even bigger than the day Li Yunhao came to visit.All eyes were gathered on a man.Li Ran.He had once been the Xiao family\u2019s greatest nightmare, but he had now become their savior\u2026 this complicated everyone\u2019s mood towards him.Li Ran said calmly to Xiao Qingge, \u201cGo on, please give me your explanation.\u201dXiao Qingge whispered in shame, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. The reason I\u2019ve been hiding my identity from you is that I don\u2019t think I\u2019m worthy of you\u2026 I\u2019m just a mortal right now and you\u2019re so outstanding. I don\u2019t have the confidence to reveal my identity\u2026\u201dSeeing her look of disappointment, Li Ran calmly said, \u201cNinety-nine percent of the people in the world are not as outstanding as me. This is very normal. You don\u2019t need to feel too inferior.\u201dSomeone with higher cultivation than him and more handsome than him?\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, but such an outstanding person do not existXiao Qingge wrinkled her nose. \u201cNarcissistic\u2026\u201dHowever, she was much more cheerful.Li Ran thought about it. \u201cThat\u2019s why you trusted me so much. Not only did you tell me everything about the secret realm, but you were also even willing to give me the Spirit Fruit?\u201dXiao Qingge smiled. \u201cIf I don\u2019t trust you, who else can I trust? Especially after knowing your heart, my entire heart belongs to you.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Li Ran was taken aback. \u201cWhat do I want?\u201dXiao Qingge replied shyly, \u201cI know that you\u2019ve been fond of me all these years. I also know that I\u2019m your precious girl\u2026 Actually, I-I also like you the most!\u201dAfter she said that, her little face turned red. Her bright eyes seemed to be dripping with water.Thinking back to Li Ran\u2019s \u201cfianc\u00e9e\u201d in the arena, she felt like she had fallen into a honeypot.However, Li Ran was completely dumbfounded.\u201cI\u2019ve always liked you all these years? Why haven\u2019t I heard about this?\u201d Li Ran felt that something was wrong. \u201cI think of you as my sister, but you wanted to seduce me?\u201dXiao Qingge was confused.Ahem!At this moment, Xiao Nian couldn\u2019t hold back any longer. He said, \u201cDoes anyone want to explain to me what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cYah!\u201dIt was only then that Xiao Qingge remembered that her clansmen were still beside her and she immediately lowered her head in embarrassment.\u201cYoung Master Li, why don\u2019t you explain it to me?\u201d Xiao Nian asked.Li Ran said, \u201cThe problem is that I didn\u2019t fully understand what was going on!\u201dXiao Nian was speechless.After a while, Xiao Nian finally figured out what had happened.\u201cIn other words, Qingge went to the Grand Myriad Mountain Range alone and happened to be saved by you. Then, both of you entered the Secret Realm together?\u201dXiao Nian rubbed his chin. \u201cWhat a coincidence? This is truly fate!\u201d\u201cIt really is fate.\u201d Li Ran nodded.Xiao Nian hesitated for a moment and asked the question that everyone was concerned about. \u201cYoung Master Li, do you want to annul this engagement or not?\u201dThis was not only related to the Xiao and Li families, it was even related to Youluo Temple!At this moment, Li Ran\u2019s attitude was especially important.\u201cThe engagement?\u201d Li Ran hesitated.Actually, his purpose in descending the Youlou Temple was to come to the Xiao Family to annul the engagement.However, Xiao Qingge\u2019s sudden appearance disrupted everything.She was brave, persistent, and sincere. Although she had fallen into the mortal world, she did not feel self-pity. She was determined to fight all possibilities.Most importantly, her looks were really good. She was beautiful and bright. Although she didn\u2019t have his master\u2019s cold aura, she was still a little more youthful.If Li Ran wanted to say he didn\u2019t like her, he was lying to himself.The only thing he was worried about now was that his master would be jealous if she found out.Thinking of Leng Wuyan\u2019s jealousness, Li Ran couldn\u2019t help but shiver.She would murder him!At that moment, Xiao Qingge said, \u201cLi Ran, you don\u2019t need to make things difficult for me. Even if you annul the engagement, my heart will not change.\u201d\u201cThe engagement is just the beginning of our fate. It doesn\u2019t fully represent our relationship.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t tie you to my Xiao family\u2019s chariot just because of a marriage contract. It\u2019s not fair to you.\u201dShe spoke softly, but her words contained deep affection.The other members of the Xiao family were all anxious.This engagement was very important to the Xiao family. How could Xiao Qingge be so stupid at a time like this?Xiao Nian did not say anything.He handed the options to the two of them.Li Ran looked at her seriously and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll make my own decision about my marriage. This marriage, I\u2019m not going to back out!\u201dHe decided to face his heart bravely.As for Master\u2026At worst, he would be whipped crazily by her, but he absolutely could not blink an eye now.Xiao Qingge\u2019s heart was about to melt. \u201cLi Ran\u2026\u201dIf it weren\u2019t for a large number of people besides her, she would have probably already pounced into Li Ran\u2019s arms.Xiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief.Not only did his daughter find a good match, but the Xiao Family also had a chance to breathe.\u201cBut it\u2019s impossible for Li Ran to stay in Wu Yang City. If the Xiao family wants to survive, they have to rely on themselves!\u201d He knew very well.\u201cBy the way.\u201d Li Ran thought of something and took out a red fruit.The entire hall was filled with a refreshing fragrance.\u201cThis is for you.\u201d Li Ran handed the red fruit to Xiao Qingge.Xiao Nian was stunned for a moment and asked curiously, \u201cWhat\u2019s this? It has an immortal aura, and from its appearance, it looks like a rare spiritual medicine!\u201dXiao Qingge\u2019s eyes were firm as she said, \u201cThis is the Spirit Fruit from the Immortal herb garden in the secret realm, my only chance to re-embark on the immortal path!\u201dThe Xiao family members gasped in unison.\u201cImmortal herb?\u201d\u201cSpirit Fruit?\u201d\u201cRe embark on the immortal path?\u201dThis was simply too important to the Xiao family.Xiao Nian was silent for a long time before he stood up and bowed deeply to Li Ran. \u201cYoung Master Li, regardless of whether Qingge succeeded or not, you are my Xiao Family\u2019s great benefactor!\u201dThe other Xiao Family elders got up and bowed excitedly. \u201cThank you, Young Master Li!\u201dThat was immortal material!Not to mention the mortal world, it was extremely rare even among the top sects.And Li Ran was actually willing to give it to Xiao Qingge.This kind of affection really made people turn their attention.Li Ran shook his head and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stand on ceremony. This belongs to her. I\u2019m just returning it to the owner.\u201dThe members of the Xiao family did not take his words to heart.How could mortals obtain immortal materials?Li Ran looked at Xiao Qingge and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. Find a quiet room and I\u2019ll protect you.\u201dXiao Qingge nodded.Xiao Nian led the two to the underground training room.Two hours later\u2026The Qi in the sky above the Xiao Manor condensed, and the sounds of immortals\u2019 chants were unceasing. The vague shadow behind that reverberation seemed to resemble the luan and the phoenix that was facing each other.Xiao Qingge has turned her fate around and re-embarked back on the Immortal Path!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74: Enraged Li Daoshi!Li Family\u2019s residence\u2026The first elder Li Daoshi looked at the sorry-state Li Sheng in front of him, flames were spitting out from his eyes.\u201cWhat exactly is going on? Li Sheng had only gone to the Xiao Family to put on a show. Why is his cultivation crippled!\u201dCould it be that the Xiao family broke the rules and that their family head or elder had attacked?\u201cDoes the Xiao Family want to declare war on my Li family? Wait for it!\u201d Li Daoshi gritted his teeth.The attendant who was kneeling beside him trembled and said in a low voice, \u201cFirst Elder, Young Master Sheng\u2019s cultivation wasn\u2019t crippled by the Xiao family\u2026\u201d\u201cNot the Xiao Family?\u201d\u201cWho did it? Was it the Liu family? Or was it the Feng family?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t dare speak\u2026\u201d The deacon trembled.Li Daoshi picked him up with a bone piercingly cold voice. \u201cIf you don\u2019t say anything, I\u2019ll kill you right now!\u201dThe deacon swallowed his saliva and said in a trembling voice, \u201cIt\u2019s Young Master Li Ran, he personally crippled Young Master Sheng\u2019s cultivation\u2026\u201d\u201cLi Ran?\u201dLi Daoshi froze.He didn\u2019t expect this answer.\u201cTell me exactly what happened!\u201d Li Daoshi said coldly.The deacon swallowed his saliva and explained everything he saw.The more Li Daoshi heard this, the colder his eyes became. In the end, he stepped on the ground and cracked!\u201cHe actually crippled my son\u2019s cultivation for that slut from the Xiao Family! He was simply going too far!\u201d\u201cThis enmity is irreconcilable! Li Ran, I will definitely make you pay the price!\u201dLi Daoshi\u2019s eyes were red, and his roar echoed out from within the room.\u2014Xiao Manor\u2026A smile blossomed on Xiao Nian\u2019s face.Ever since the Xiao family\u2019s ancestor had passed away, he had never been so happy.Xiao Qingge\u2019s cultivation had recovered.The Spirit Fruit was indeed worthy of being known as an immortal material. Not only did it allow her to regain her transcendent talent, but her lost cultivation was also restored.The Foundation Establishment Realm was only one step away from the Golden Core Realm.\u201cNephew, hurry up and try this tea. This is my treasured immortal tea, and I\u2019ve never been willing to drink it.\u201d Xiao Nian smiled.Li Ran nodded and took a sip.\u201cGood tea.\u201d\u201cGood taste, nephew!\u201dXiao Qingge smiled and said, \u201cFather, you\u2019re flattering too much.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by flattering? Nephew Li helped you recover your cultivation. He is a great benefactor of my Xiao family, so I naturally should treat him with courtesy.\u201dThe more Xiao Nian looked at Li Ran, the more he found Li Ran to be pleasing to the eye.He was handsome and had great talent. He was also good to Xiao Qingge.The only thing that was controversial was his devil sect background.However, the cultivation world had always relied on strength.If you came from a third-rate sect, even if you were the embodiment of justice, no one would take you seriously.However, if one were to hail from a top sect, even if he was a demon who killed everyone like plundering grass, everyone would only revere it.This was the reality.Moreover, the Youluo Temple was different from the other devil sects. It did not have much of a bad reputation.Xiao Nian looked at the two of them and rolled his eyes. He said, \u201cThis old man still has something to take care of. You two can chat slowly.\u201dAfter saying that, he got up and left, leaving space for them.The atmosphere calmed down, and a trace of a gentle and indistinct ripple rippled out.Xiao Qingge said softly, \u201cLi Ran, you haven\u2019t come for a long time. I thought that something happened to you in the secret realm, and you\u2019ve been on edge all these days\u2026\u201dLi Ran nodded. \u201cThere was indeed a small incident. It took me a few days.\u201cHe briefly explained what happened after she left.This included killing Song Qingsong, obtaining a Heavenly Flame, and being plotted against by the world laws.When Xiao Qingge heard this, her heart skipped a beat. She covered her mouth and cried out in shock.Especially the part where she heard that the secret realm had collapsed and almost buried him. She even carefully examined his body.\u201cWhere are you injured? Is it serious?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s just a meridian blockage. It\u2019s already healed,\u201d Li Ran replied.\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Xiao Qingge heaved a sigh of relief, but then she asked in confusion, \u201cThen who took care of you during the past few days when you lost all of your cultivation?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Yue Jianli\u2019s cold and proud face appeared in Li Ran\u2019s mind.During that period of time, she took care of him in every way. She awkwardly concocted medicine, fed him food, and even fed him medicine with her mouth\u2026If Xiao Qingge found out about this\u2026Li Ran shuddered.\u201cHer name is Auntie Sun. She is a kind-hearted villager,\u201d he answered seriously..\u201cOh.\u201d Xiao Qingge nodded.She felt that something was wrong, but she couldn\u2019t find what\u2019s wrong.\u201cLi Ran, will you be punished if you cripple Li Sheng\u2019s cultivation?\u201d Xiao Qingge asked worriedly.\u201cI\u2019m Sheng Zi of Youluo Temple. My father is the Li Clan\u2019s Patriarch. Who dares to punish me?\u201d Li Ran laughed coldly.However, even though his words were like this, his eyes turned cold.He clearly understood,Li Daoshi definitely wouldn\u2019t let this go!\u2014The Li Family Council.The top seat was occupied by the Patriarch Li Daoyuan, followed by Li Daoshi. All of the elders were seated in order.The atmosphere was cold and ghastly!They had just found out what had happened. This matter shocked everyone.The Grand Elder was the first to make a move. He slammed the table. \u201cLi Daoyuan, you raised a good son! Your son dared to cripple Sheng\u2019er like this?\u201dThe Fourth Elder replied, \u201cSheng\u2019er is at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm. He is also an inner sect disciple, and his future is limitless! This is a great loss to the Li family!\u201dThe Sixth Elder also agreed, \u201cMatters of attempting to kill one\u2019s fellow family members is a great taboo! I know that Li Ran had become a Sheng Zi, so I felt a little flustered!\u201dBoth of them were from the same lineage as the Grand Elder, so they stood out to assist him at this opportunity.Li Daoyuan frowned.The Grand Elder had always been unwilling to accept him and had always opposed him.This time, if the other party were to have leverage over him, he would have to bite himself!\u201cStrange, how could Ran\u2019er be so rash\u2026\u201d He was confused.Li Sheng wasn\u2019t a good person. Even if he wanted to kill, he should just kill. However, to cripple Li Sheng\u2019s cultivation in public was a huge taboo.\u201cLi Daoyuan, you must give me an explanation today. My son needs an explanation!\u201d the Grand Elder said angrily.Li Daoyuan sighed. \u201cThen what do you want?\u201dThe Grand Elder snorted coldly. \u201cSuch atrocity should naturally be handled according to the family rules! Li Ran had crippled my son\u2019s cultivation. According to the clan\u2019s rules, he has to similarly cripple himself!\u201dEveryone present was stunned.Li Ran was a dazzling genius with a saint-grade talent. He was the pride of the entire Li family!Cripple his cultivation? What a joke!\u201cImpossible.\u201d Li Daoyuan frowned. \u201cEven if I agree, the one from the Youluo Temple would not agree.\u201dThe Grand Elder seemed to have expected this response. \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, let\u2019s ask the ancestor to come out from seclusion and let him help me uphold justice!\u201dHiss!Everyone present gasped.Ask the ancestor to come out from seclusion?So this was what the Grand Elder had in mind!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75: The Fickle AncestorThere was a reason why the Li Family\u2019s position was so extraordinary and that their position was higher than the other families.The only reason was that the Li Family had an emperor powerhouse.The Li Family ancestor, Li Wuqiang, was a mighty figure who had Emperor-level cultivation.He was on the same level as Leng Wuyan, Liu Xunhuan, Chen Yundao, and others.Moreover, he had lived longer than them.Because of some unknown reasons, Li Wuqiang had always stayed in the Li family\u2019s secret ground in seclusion, never taking a single step outside.He silently guarded the descendants of the Li family.Only when there was a major incident within the family, or when there was a powerful enemy that attacked, would he reveal his true body.Now, the Grand Elder wanted to invite the ancestor out of seclusion?Li Daoyuan frowned and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t this making a fuss? If you dare to disturb the ancestor\u2019s cultivation, his anger is not something we can bear!\u201dThe Great Elder refused to let go. \u201cIt\u2019s a major matter that the family members wanted to kill each other. Moreover, it\u2019s also related to the son of the patriarch. We\u2019ll let the ancestor make a decision!\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Li Daoyuan was extremely resistant.As the Patriarch, no matter what Li Ran did, he would be able to protect him.However, once the ancestor emerged from seclusion, his position would be switched.The ancestor is iron-clad and righteous. His most serious taboo was for families to kill each other.This matter, with no clear indication of who\u2019s right or wrong, is definitely not good.\u201cThe Grand Elder is very smart. This was the only way to punish Li Ran! According to the family\u2019s rules, as long as half of the elders agree, they can invite the ancestor out of seclusion. Let\u2019s vote!\u201d After he finished, he raised his hand first.Following that, the Fourth Elder and the Sixth Elder raised their hands to express their agreement.As for the Patriarch Li Daoyuan, Second Elder, and Fifth Elder, they did not raise their hands.Three votes to three, just half!A trace of pride flashed through Grand Elder\u2019s eyes. \u201cVery good, ring the bell, enter the secret ground, and respectfully welcome the ancestor out of seclusion!\u201dLi Daoyuan secretly expressed his hate towards the Grand Elder, but he had his hands tied this time.\u2014Li Family\u2019s secret ground\u2026After arriving at the ancestral hall, several elders stood in front of a huge stone door.The stone door was engraved with various Dao Markings, and it seemed as if there was a phenomenon of the Grand Dao that could not help but draw people\u2019s attention to immerse in it.Dong~As the melodious bell rang out, ripples spread across the stone door.A moment later, an indistinguishable voice rang out.\u201cWhy are you disturbing this emperor\u2019s rest?\u201dHis voice was filled with unfathomable majesty, as it clearly resounded in everyone\u2019s hearts.The Grand Elder fell to his knees with a \u201cthump\u201d sound. \u201cDisturbing the ancestor\u2019s cultivation is worthy of death. However, there\u2019s one thing we want the ancestor to decide!\u201dThe ancestor\u2019s voice seemed to come from the nine heavens. \u201cLi Daoshi\u2026 I remember you. What happened?\u201dGrand Elder lamented, \u201cPatriarch\u2019s son, Li Ran, has no sense of justice. He is a member of the same family, yet he crippled my son Li Sheng\u2019s cultivation. Please give me justice, ancestor!\u201dHis voice was miserable as if he had suffered a great grievance.In order to confirm his words, he had even brought Li Sheng, who was unconscious, with him. He was lying on the ground.\u201cThere is actually such a thing?\u201d The ancestor\u2019s voice contained a bit of anger.Li Daoyuan\u2019s brows jumped, and he hurriedly kneeled on the ground. \u201cIt was Li Sheng who attacked Li Ran\u2019s fianc\u00e9e first. Ancestor, please!\u201d\u201cXiao Qingge isn\u2019t from our Li family! Moreover, she was safe and sound, yet my son\u2019s cultivation was crippled!\u201dThe ancestor\u2019s dignified voice sounded, \u201cLi Daoyuan, is what he said true?\u201dLi Daoyuan\u2019s heart thumped a thousand times, but in the end, he sighed helplessly. \u201cIt\u2019s true\u2026.\u201dThe great emperor\u2019s divine abilities were unfathomable, able to see through the past and present. There was no point in lying.If he angered the ancestor, Li Ran would end up in an even more miserable state.Li Daoyuan was determined. Even if he didn\u2019t want the position of the family head, he still had to protect Li Ran.The ancestor said, \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, then we should deal with it according to the family\u2019s rules. We\u2019ll abolish his cultivation and demote him to mortality!\u201d\u201cAncestor!\u201dLi Daoyuan exclaimed, \u201cAbsolutely not! Ran\u2019er is a saint-grade talent, our Li family\u2019s future hope! We must not cripple his cultivation!\u201dHe had wanted to persuade the ancestor to change his mind.Unexpectedly, the ancestor snorted coldly. \u201cSo what if he has a saint-grade talent? A family rule was a family rule! For the sake of beauty, he decided to make a move against his fellow family members, this kind of genius, the Li family does not need!\u201dHis natural talent was ordinary. But he had relied on fortuitous encounters to become a Dao Emperor, so he didn\u2019t have a good impression of these geniuses.These persuasion words were actually not helpful.Boom!He fell to the ground with a pale face.\u201cIt\u2019s over\u2026\u201dThe grand elder was overjoyed. \u201cAncestor, thank you for your help!\u201dAs long as he could cripple Li Ran\u2019s cultivation, the prestige of the family head would be greatly weakened.He had a chance to ascend as the family head.Li Sheng in exchange for Li Ran.This was not a loss.Then, the grand elder thought of something and said, \u201cBut regarding the punishment of Li Ran, I still have to ask the ancestor to personally take action!\u201dThe ancestor asked in confusion, \u201cWhy?\u201dThe Great Elder explained, \u201cLi Ran, that thief, has already entered the Youluo Temple. He is the disciple of an emperor-ranked expert, Leng Wuyan. We will probably infuriate that female demon!\u201d\u201cAhem\u2026 Whose disciple is he again?\u201dThe grand elder said, \u201cYouluo Temple Master, Leng Wuyan.\u201dThe ancestor was silent. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAncestor?\u201dHe was still silent.The air was quiet for a long time.Just as everyone was confused, the ancestor\u2019s voice rang out.\u201cLi Daoyuan, you said that Li Sheng attacked Li Ran\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, right?\u201dLi Daoyuan was stunned for a moment before nodding. \u201cIndeed\u2026\u201dThe ancestor replied, \u201cWhat Li Ran did wasn\u2019t necessarily wrong.\u201d???The Grand Elder had a black question mark on his face.\u201cAncestor! Didn\u2019t you just say you\u2019re going to cripple\u2026\u201dThe ancestor snapped at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that. You heard wrong.\u201dGrand Elder Jiao said anxiously, \u201cThen wouldn\u2019t my son\u2019s cultivation be wasted for nothing?\u201dHe picked up the unconscious Li Sheng and pleaded, \u201cI beg you, Ancestor!\u201dA wave of ripples appeared on the stone door. A large hand reached out from the stone door and the index finger lightly pressed on the space between Li Sheng\u2019s eyebrows.A scene of real images emerged in the air.It was all Li Sheng\u2019s past actions.Five years ago, he had killed three people in the Intoxicated Wind Restaurant, only because the other party\u2019s voice was too loud.Three years ago, in the Spring Pavilion, five people were burned to death and three were burned to death.Two years ago, he broke into someone else\u2019s home to rob a civilian girl\u2019s innocence and tortured her to death for four straight days. However, it was all blamed on Li Ran.A year ago\u2026\u2026\u2026Grand Elder was paralyzed on the ground, his face as pale as paper.The ancestor\u2019s voice was sullen. \u201cSuch scum is worthy of being a disciple of my Li Family? Even crippling his cultivation was too light!\u201dHis fingers exerted a bit of strength, and Li Sheng\u2019s body instantly showed crack marks, before turning into fine sand and dissipating.He was actually killed by the ancestor.\u201cSheng\u2019er!\u201d Grand Elder cried out in grief.He really couldn\u2019t understand why things turned out like this.The ancestor\u2019s voice rang out once more. \u201cSince it\u2019s your fault for not teaching your son properly, you should be punished to face the ancestral shrine wall for three years.\u201dPu!The Grand Elder spat out a mouthful of blood and fainted.The Fourth Elder and Sixth Elder were shivering.What was going on?It was clearly Li Ran who had made a mistake. Why did the ancestor kill Li Sheng?He had said that his face was unyielding, and he had said that he was upright and unyielding?!The ancestor said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t need anything, then leave.\u201dOnly then did Li Daoyuan react and kowtow. \u201cThank you, ancestor!\u201dThe ancestor added, \u201cBy the way, when Li Ran returns, ask him to come and see me.\u201dAlthough Li Daoyuan didn\u2019t understand, he still replied, \u201cYes.\u201dThe ripples dissipated, and the stone door returned to calm.\u2014Behind the stone door\u2026A white-bearded old man wiped away his cold sweat.\u201cF*ck! I didn\u2019t expect him to be Leng Wuyan\u2019s disciple! I almost fell for it! What if I really crippled him\u2026\u201dThe old man couldn\u2019t help but shiver.\u201cThat demoness will cut this old man down!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76: Congratulations to the Grand Elder on having a three-year holiday!A lot of big things happened in Wu Yang recently.The Devil Sect\u2019s Sheng Zi Li Ran had returned.This was a huge piece of news.The first thing he did after coming back was to cripple Li Sheng\u2019s cultivation.This caused all of the chosen ones to tremble in fear!Naturally, the rumors of the annulment of the engagement naturally broke down.The other important thing was that Xiao Qingge\u2019s cultivation had recovered.The Xiao Clan\u2019s fallen genius, Fairy Qing who had fallen into the mortal realm, has re-embarked onto the path of immortality.According to a reliable information source, this was also Li Ran\u2019s work.It was him who used an exceptional immortal material, immediately restoring her talent.After all, this was something that even the Divine Dao Palace was helpless with, and it was actually done by him alone.Li Ran\u2019s reputation was unparalleled in Wu Yang City!\u2014Li Family\u2019s residence.The faces of all the elders and disciples were grave as if something huge had happened.It wasn\u2019t about the wind and rain in the outside world, but about the internal affairs of the Li family.They had to ring the ancestor bell.The bell was the only way to get the ancestor out of seclusion.Only when the family was dead, or when a major accident happened, would they ring the bell.It had been nearly a hundred years since the bell last rang.On the other hand, the Grand Elder was baffled by Li Sheng\u2019s crippled cultivation, so he forcefully invited the ancestor out of seclusion through a fifty-fifty vote.Everyone had thought that this was the end of Li Ran\u2019s luck.Who would have thought that Li Sheng would die instead?Even the Grand Elder was infuriated to the point of unconsciousness. After waking up, he would have to face three years of confinement.After coming out of the room, the elders\u2019 expressions grew grim as they didn\u2019t say a word.This was especially true for the Fourth and Sixth Elders. Their faces were pale and disoriented.It was as if the sky had collapsed.No one knew what had happened in the secret ground.But the only thing that was certain was that this matter was definitely related to Li Ran!\u2014And of course, Li Ran knew nothing about this.After flirting and fondling Xiao Qingge until her face turned red and her legs went weak, Li Ran went home in a very relaxed and happy mood.When he arrived at the entrance of the Li Mansion, he discovered that the door was closed, and there was not a single guard in front of it.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, are the guards lazy in broad daylight?\u201dBang bang bang.Li Ran knocked on the gate.\u201cLi Manor has arrangements today. It\u2019s inconvenient for us to see guests. Please return.\u201d A voice came from inside.\u201cBack to you, open your dog eyes, and see who this young master is?\u201d Li Ran raised his eyebrows.\u201cYoung master Ran?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t open the door, I\u2019ll deduct your salary.\u201dCreak!When the scarlet door opened and the servant who was guarding the door was certain that it was Li Ran, he immediately broke out in cold sweat.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that you\u2019d return. Please forgive me, Young Master Ran!\u201d The servant bowed deeply, his waist was bent down.\u201cAll right, get up!\u201d Li Ran looked left and right and asked in confusion, \u201cWhy is it so cold and deserted? Where has everyone gone?\u201dThe servant replied, \u201cToday, the manor is closed for guests. The elders and deacons are in the meeting room.\u201d\u201cMeeting room?\u201dLi Ran sneered, \u201cIs it because of Li Sheng? Coincidentally, I also wanted to see what Grand Elder had to say!\u201dHe understood Li Daoshi\u2019s personality.He had always coveted the position of Patriarch, and he often gave the Patriarch a hard time. This time, he had given Li Daoshi such a big opportunity, so he would definitely bite him to death.Li Ran was already ready to fight him.The servant looked at his back and hesitated.\u201cForget it, I can\u2019t talk about this kind of thing. It\u2019s better to just see it personally.\u201d\u2014Li Family Council\u2026Li Daoyuan said in a low voice, \u201cAi, big brother insisted on asking the ancestor to come out, but in the end, something like this happened. It\u2019s really\u2026\u201dHe helplessly sighed.The other elders and deacons had different expressions.Some of them had depressed expressions, while others had looks of joy\u2026 This change was related to the interests of everyone.Li Daoyuan calmed down and said, \u201cPatriarch\u2019s order can not be disobeyed. During the three years that Big Brother is imprisoned, the family\u2019s affairs will be handled by Second Brother.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The Second Elder cupped his hands.He was Li Ran\u2019s second uncle, as well as a determined clan leader.The Fourth Elder and the Sixth Elder powerlessly collapsed onto their chairs.In three years, the Grand Elder\u2019s power would have been lifted down. The Li Clan\u2019s Patriarch would be as stable as a rock by that time.Moreover, without the Grand Elder, their interests would be devoured step by step.The two looked at each other, their eyes filled with bitterness.\u201cWe\u2019re on the wrong side\u2026\u201dAt this moment, Li Ran rolled up his arms and rushed in. He acted as if he wasn\u2019t prepared.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for entering. Tell me, what exactly is Uncle planning to do to me?\u201dThe meeting room fell silent.Everyone stared at him blankly.Li Ran was stunned for a moment. He looked carefully and saw that the Grand Elder wasn\u2019t in his seat.\u201cWhere is the Grand Elder?\u201d He was confused.Cough cough!Li Daoyuan cleared his throat. \u201cRan\u2019er, you didn\u2019t know that the grand elder was imprisoned by the ancestor?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Li Ran scratched his head. \u201cImprisoned? For how long?\u201d\u201cThree years.\u201dPu\u2026Li Ran laughed on the spot.The other elders all covered their faces.How could we be so obvious? It was fine to put on a bad show!Even Li Daoyuan glared at him.Li Ran wiped his face and forced himself to stop smiling. He nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s good too. Eldest Uncle has been working hard for my Li family day and night. It\u2019s time for him to rest and take this opportunity to take a three-year holiday.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Fourth Elder was about to vomit blood.Isn\u2019t he confined? He\u2019s not allowed to take half a step out of Ancestral Hall. Do you call this a three-year-long holiday?When Li Daoyuan saw that his words were getting more outrageous, he hurriedly interrupted, \u201cRan\u2019 er, you came back just in time. Let\u2019s go to the secret ground. The ancestor wants to see you.\u201d\u201cPatriarch wants to see me?\u201d Li Ran was confused.He had only heard of the legendary Emperor Li Wuqiang. It was said that he was a heroic figure.Li Daoyuan said, \u201cThis matter is of the utmost importance. You can go over first. We\u2019ll talk about everything else later.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Li Ran nodded.\u2014Li Family\u2019s secret ground.Li Ran rubbed his chin as he examined the stone door in front of him.\u201cThis is where the ancestor lives?\u201dThis was the first time he had come here. He felt very unfamiliar with this place.He knocked on the stone door, \u201cIs anyone here?\u201dHe received no response for a long time.\u201cStrange, didn\u2019t the ancestor say he wanted to see me?\u201d Li Ran felt a little strange.Behind the stone door.The white-bearded old man smiled mischievously.\u201cSo what if he\u2019s Leng Wuyan\u2019s disciple? He still had to obediently listen to me! I\u2019ll leave him alone today. I still don\u2019t believe he\u2019ll be able to open the door and enter by himself.\u201dAt this moment, a system notification sounded in Li Ran\u2019s mind:\u3010Mission Issued\u3011\u3010Please open the secret ground gate and display the strength of the Youluo Temple\u2019s Sheng Zi!\u3011Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77: Ancestor\u2019s Test, Bloodline Awakening!Li Ran understood.No wonder the ancestor didn\u2019t respond. So it was all a test!He carefully observed the enormous stone door in front of him.The gate was made up of an entire boulder, without any traces of splicing. The intricate lines along the door seemed to be naturally formed.There was only one spot that could hold a few fingers.\u201cOpen it with my own strength\u2026\u201d Li Ran pondered for a moment. He gathered qi into his palm as he tried to suck the stone door out.However, the qi was like an ox entering the sea, unable to turn over a single drop of water.Even though he had used a Daoist technique, the stone door did not budge at all. It was as if all his qi was devoured.Inside the stone door\u2026When the Old Master caught sight of this, he was stunned. \u201cWhat is this kid doing? Don\u2019t tell me he wants to open the door by himself!\u201dThis wasn\u2019t an ordinary stone door. The door was entirely made up of Demon Suppressing Stone.Demon Suppressing Stones were extremely rare, with the ability to suppress demons. As long as the demon\u2019s strength did not exceed the tribulation stage, all Daoist arts, and divine abilities would be rendered ineffective.If he wanted to open the door, he could only rely on his pure physical ability.However, this boulder weighed over hundreds of thousands of kilograms. Who would have such strength?The ancestor stroked his beard and shook his head. \u201cHehe, it\u2019s just a good chance to give this kid a show of strength! Leng Wuyan, I can\u2019t beat you, but I can beat your disciple.\u201dHe was both happy and relieved.On the other side of the door, Li Ran studied the door for a long time before confirming that he could not open the door with the Daoist technique.It seemed like he could only use his physical strength to open it.He grabbed the groove and pulled, but the stone door remained motionless.\u201cIt\u2019s indeed worthy of being the ancestor\u2019s test. It\u2019s difficult!\u201d Li Ran exhaled and focused. His muscles tightened as he forcefully pulled the door.However, just relying on pure power alone wasn\u2019t enough to shake this heavy boulder.When the ancestor saw this, he smiled smugly. \u201cA mere Golden Core Realm cultivator wants to move this Demon Suppressing Stone? That\u2019s simply crazy\u2026\u00a0Ah?!\u201dThe next scene left him frozen.Li Ran\u2019s eyes started emitting divine light.His muscles started bulging at which his clothes were torn and his body was covered with golden divine patterns.Roots appeared under his feet and Li Ran exhaled. \u201cOpen!\u201dBoom!With a loud boom, the stone door was slowly opened!The ancestor\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat kind of cultivation technique is this? How could it ignore the Demon Suppressing Stone\u2019s suppressing might?\u201dLi Ran\u2019s eyes were grave.Not enough!His right hand lit up with golden flame, instantaneously lighting his entire body like a humanoid torch.\u201cH-heavenly Flame? This is\u2026 the Burning Heaven Sacred Flame?!\u201d\u201cOpen up!!!\u201d Li Ran\u2019s voice was like thunder, his strength pressed down like a dragon.With the support of the Burning Heaven Sacred Flame, his bloodstream surged like a river, and his body became steaming hot!Boom boom boom!The stone door was opened with a rumble, and the gap grew larger and larger.The bricks beneath his feet shattered with a bang, and the entire secret ground began to shake. Countless tiny stones fell down!Boom!Following the final explosion, the entire secret ground fell silent.The huge stone door was pulled to a right angle of ninety degrees. Li Ran and the ancestor looked at each other in dismay.The Ancestor looked at the muscular man in front of him and his eyes trembled. \u201cYou\u2019re really energetic like a horse\u2026\u201dLi Ran\u2019s body was still covered in wisps of white smoke. He raised his thumbs up and said, \u201cAncestor\u2019s test is indeed extraordinary. I almost failed.\u201d\u201c\u2026Who said I\u2019m testing you?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d\u201cWhen you leave, close the door for me.\u201d\u201cAh??\u201d\u2014Li Ran put on his clothes and sat in the pavilion, curiously examining his surroundings.Unexpectedly, such a strange secret realm was hidden behind the ancestral hall of the Li Family.The greenery was present everywhere. The occasional breeze brought in the fragrance of grass and the sun stood blazing in the clear-as-water sky.One had to understand that this place was located underground!It was clearly an independent space similar to a secret realm.The Ancestor sat opposite him, squinting at Li Ran.\u201cThe monster\u2019s disciple is indeed a monster\u2026 no, he\u2019s still my descendant. Wouldn\u2019t I be scolding myself as well?\u201dThe Ancestor cleared his throat. \u201cYou\u2019re Li Ran, right?\u201d\u201cYes, Ancestor,\u201d Li Ran responded.\u201cWhere did the golden cultivation technique you used just now and the Burning Heaven Sacred Flame come from?\u201d the ancestor asked.Li Ran replied, \u201cFrom the secret realm.\u201dIn any case, if it wasn\u2019t reasonable, he would just say it was from the secret realm. As long as he didn\u2019t expose the existence of the system, everything was good.The Ancestor stroked his beard. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that you would actually have such an opportunity to obtain the Burning Heaven Emperor\u2019s inheritance\u2026 That golden cultivation technique is extremely strange. Even this old man is unable to see through it. As expected of an Ancient Immortal Emperor\u2019s inheritance.\u201dIn his eyes, the Heaven Seizing Technique was even more bizarre than the Burning Heaven Sacred Flame.This caused him to fall into deep thought.Li Ran took this opportunity to open the system to check the reward.\u3010Mission Completed\u3011\u3010Degree of Completion: Perfect\u3011\u3010Obtained Super Treasure Chest x1\u3011He immediately opened the treasure chest.\u3010Congratulations to the host for obtaining the ability \u201cBloodline Awakening\u201d.\u3011The \u201cBloodline Awakening\u201d is a pretty simple ability to understand: to awaken to the power of one\u2019s bloodline.\u201cMysterious\u2026\u201d Li Ran scratched his head. \u201cCould it be that there is something else within the Li Family\u2019s bloodline?\u201d\u201cGrandson, how has your master been lately? Is she still so violent?\u201dFor some reason, Li Ran felt that the Ancestor was scolding him. Although he was indeed his grandson\u2026\u201cAncestor, Master is still so gentle,\u201d Li Ran replied.\u201cBullshit!\u201dThe old ancestor puffed his beard and glared at him. \u201cLeng Wuyan and gentleness are the opposite of each other! That madwoman, always holding the sword and shouting to kill people, if it weren\u2019t that I\u2026 He paused and swallowed the \u2018I can\u2019t beat her\u201d back into his throat.\u201dLi Ran felt a little helpless.Master was indeed gentle and cute. Why did no one believe him?The Ancestor suddenly asked, \u201cWhen you cultivated with Leng Wuyan, did she ever bully you?\u201dLi Ran shook his head. \u201cNo, Master treats me very well.\u201d\u201cShe was very good to you? Who are you fooling?\u201dThe Ancestor sneered, then said with helplessness, \u201cThat\u2019s true. Even if she abused you, you wouldn\u2019t dare to speak of it\u2026 If she dares bully you again\u2026\u201dLi Ran asked, \u201cI\u2019ll tell her ancestor\u2019s name?\u201dThe Ancestor replied, \u201cJust bear with it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Li Ran felt that the ancestor had been abused by Leng Wuyan\u2026The Ancestor sighed. \u201cAi, if it wasn\u2019t for my Li Family\u2019s bloodline becoming thinner and thinner, would the younger generation still need to take someone else as their master?\u201d\u201cBloodline?\u201d Li Ran asked curiously, \u201cIs our Li family\u2019s bloodline very powerful?\u201d\u201cNot only is our bloodline very prestigious, but we are also the descendants of Immortal Emperors. We were truly a large clan! It was just that our clan had declined.\u201dThe Ancestor waved his hand in a moody manner.\u201cAfter so many years, there isn\u2019t a single one who can awaken their bloodline. My hope will only grow dimmer and dimmer\u2026\u201dHe was stunned in mid-sentence as he stared at Li Ran in shock.At this moment, Li Ran\u2019s body was emitting a faint red light, even his eyes turned deep red.\u201cBy Bloodline Awakening, do you mean this?\u201d Li Ran tilted his head and asked.The Ancestor: \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78: This Old Master is Simply Too Unreliable!Ancestor Li Wuqiang stared at Li Ran blankly.Li Ran\u2019s entire body was shrouded in red light as if he was surrounded by blood mist. His originally black eyes turned crimson, and there were red threads in his eyes. It looked extremely strange.His body also grew a bit larger, slightly tightening his clothes, and his blood was surging like a river.A feeling of bloodline connection was present to both of them.\u201cYou actually awakened your bloodline? Then why haven\u2019t I found out when you were born?\u201dEvery newborn in the Li Family secretly got their bloodline density tested, Li Ran included.Back then, Li Ran\u2019s bloodline wasn\u2019t so powerful!Li Ran pretended to be dumbfounded, \u201cI don\u2019t know, but just as you were talking about the bloodline, it awakened by itself\u2026\u201d\u201cAwakened by itself\u2026?\u201d\u201cCould this be the will of the heavens? My Li family finally has someone who could awaken their bloodline!\u201dLi Ran scratched his head. \u201cIs this very important?\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s important!\u201dLi Wuqiang\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cWith a bloodline successor, I\u2019ll be able to leave this place!\u201dLi Ran\u2019s lips twitched, \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re so excited\u2026\u201dWith Li Wuqiang\u2019s explanation, Li Ran finally understood.The Li Family\u2019s ancestor was an Immortal Emperor. Every descendant of the Li family had a trace of an Immortal Emperor\u2019s blood.The Li Family was a true immortal clan.Immortal Emperors were extremely rare in the vast lands, because the higher the cultivation base, the harder it was for them to conceive.After reaching the level of Immortal Emperor, the probability of leaving behind a descendant was basically zero.But the Li family was different.The Li Family\u2019s Ancestral Immortal Emperor was called Li Hanjiang. He was called the Blood Demon Emperor.He used his martial arts to reach the Great Dao, and his physical body had become a Saint. His qi and blood were as vigorous as a great river.His flesh was as imposing as a mountain, and his palm could cut through the river!It was precisely due to this fact that he did not have the after-effects of other powerful beings. Giving birth to a child was like playing around. It was easy to bear his descendant.That was why his bloodline was able to continue.However, there was also a flaw. The bloodline would become extremely thin, and the possibility of awakening would never exist.No one in the Li Family had awakened in hundreds of years.Li Ran seemed to have some thoughts. \u201cSo that means that the reason why you stayed in the secret ground of the Li family is to wait for the awakened one?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Li Wuqiang nodded. \u201cMy mission is to wait for the birth of the one who awakened their bloodline and properly teaches him\u2026 I didn\u2019t expect that you will be a fish that escaped the net, who had only awakened at the age of eighteen.\u201dBecause of the ancestral teachings, Li Wuqiang had no choice but to stay in the secret ground. He had even made plans to die here.Li Ran\u2019s appearance finally gave him hope.\u201cAs long as you succeed in overcoming the tribulation, then that old man\u2019s mission is completed. I will be able to leave this rotten place and enjoy myself outside!\u201d Li Wuqiang\u2019s eyes were filled with tears.He had really held back for too long.Li Ran said seriously, \u201cAll right, for the sake of freeing you, I\u2019ll cultivate diligently!\u201d\u201cGood child!\u201d Li Wuqiang praised him.\u201cThen how should I make my bloodline stronger?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not an awakened person, how would I know the method to cultivate my bloodline? But according to common sense, as long as your cultivation becomes stronger, your bloodline will develop.\u201dLi Ran understood. \u201cDoes that mean that the higher my cultivation base is, the stronger my bloodline power will be?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dLi Ran was happy. Simple enough for him.In any case, it was only a matter of time before he could become stronger.\u201cHow do you plan to guide me in my training?\u201d Li Ran asked.Li Wuqiang shook his head. \u201cYou have a master yourself, why do you need my guidance?\u201dLi Ran said helplessly, \u201cThen you have to do something, right?\u201dLi Wuqiang stroked his beard and said, \u201cWhat I want to do is to wait quietly for you to pass the tribulation.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLi Ran refused to give up. \u201cAs an Awakened, you have to give me some magical equipment and immortal pills, yes?\u201dLi Wuqiang looked at him warily. \u201cWhy should I give you my treasure?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Li Ran resisted the urge to pull his beard.This Old Master is simply too unreliable, ah!Normally speaking, when any family ancestor finds a genius like him, shouldn\u2019t he be heavily favored and get bestowed numerous treasures while still getting asked, \u201cIs this enough, Child?\u201d?This old man is too damn stingy!\u201cGrandson, an Immortal Emperor\u2019s bloodline is the best treasure. You must make good use of it. Don\u2019t try to tarnish the reputation of our Li Family\u2019s Immortal Emperor,\u201d Li Wuqiang said.\u201cI understand everything, but can you not call me grandson?\u201d\u201cGreat-grandson?\u201d\u201c\u2026You can call me grandson.\u201dIn the end, Li Wuqiang reluctantly took out an ancient book under Li Ran\u2019s shameless begging.It was said that this was a cultivation technique passed down from ancient times. After the cultivation technique was completed, its power would be peerless, and he could cultivate it until he reaches the Emperor realm.Li Wuqiang said with regret, \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for my constitution, I wouldn\u2019t have given it to you!\u201dLi Ran looked at the big words \u201cRakshasa Sutra\u201d on the cover and his lips twitched.\u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, this should be a female cultivation technique\u2026\u201d\u201cYou look down on female cultivators? I\u2019m going to punch you!\u201dLi Ran didn\u2019t want to stay any longer. He immediately got up and gave his biding.The ancestor was still shouting behind him, asking him to close the door.\u2014Grand Elder\u2019s residence.Grand Elder woke up and then opened his eyes in confusion. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d\u201cGrand Elder, you\u2019re finally awake! Fourth Elder, hurry up and come over! If you don\u2019t wake up, the entire clan would be in danger!\u201dHe told the Grand Elder about Li Daoyuan\u2019s decision.Bang!Grand Elder slammed the bed and said angrily, \u201cLi Daoyuan\u2019s methods are so ruthless! Sheng\u2019er\u2019s corpse hadn\u2019t turned cold yet, but he had already set his mind on me!\u201dThe Fourth Elder consoled him, \u201cBig Brother, don\u2019t get angry. We can still make a long-term plan.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s only three years of confinement! I can endure it!\u201d\u201cLi Ran is a disciple of the Youlou Temple, it\u2019s impossible for him to succeed the family title. As long as we pull Li Daoyuan down, we\u2019ll succeed!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Old Six and I will always cooperate with you!\u201d Fourth Elder said.\u201cFourth Brother!\u201d\u201cBig Brother!\u201dThe two of them looked at each other with pride.At this time, Li Wuqiang\u2019s voice rang out, reverberating throughout the entire Li Manor.\u201cThe son of the family head, Li Ran, possesses the bloodline of an Immortal Emperor. According to the teachings of our ancestors, he should be established as the young master, the next family head, and lead the Li family back to the glorious days of being an Immortal Emperor\u2019s Clan!\u201dThe Fourth Elder gulped. \u201cDid I hear right? The next patriarch\u2026 is Li Ran?\u201dPfft!The Grand Elder was so furious that he coughed up a mouthful of blood and fainted.\u201cBig Brother!!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79: Sword Drawn Against an Emperor Powerhouse!Flying Cloud Peak\u2026Supreme Dao Palace\u2026A group of people was gathered here.The atmosphere was solemn and silent.At the center of the hall was a black-robed old man with a crane-haired young face sitting at the very top.It was none other than the Sect Master of the Supreme Dao Palace, Chen Yundao.Beneath the stage, the similarly black-robed Venerable Hao Yue said, \u201cSect Leader, I\u2019ve already investigated the matter. The Devil Sect\u2019s Sheng Zi Li Ran has indeed entered the secret realm!\u201d\u201cOh?\u201cChen Yun asked, \u201cIs he related to Song Qingsong\u2019s death?\u201dVenerable Hao Yue snorted coldly. \u201cAccording to those in the same group, the ones who entered the final trial were Yue Jianli, Li Ran, and Qingsong. In the end, only my disciple died, yet the two of them were safe and sound!\u201d\u201cHao Yue, what do you mean by that?\u201dThe Myriad Sword Pavilion Sect Elder beside him said unhappily, \u201cCould it be that you want to say that our sect\u2019s chief disciple is colluding with a devil sect monster?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s ask Chief Yue what\u2019s going on!\u201d Venerable Hao Yue snorted coldly.Yue Jianli was dressed in green. She held the sword in her arms and stood there quietly.A trace of displeasure flashed in her lowered eyes when she heard the words \u201cDevil Sect Monster\u201d.\u201cChief Yue, what exactly happened in the final trial? Was Song Qingsong killed by Li Ran?\u201dHis voice was calm and peaceful, but it carried a trace of indescribable pressure.Yue Jianli raised her head and said indifferently, \u201cSong Qingsong indeed died in the final trial, but it has nothing to do with Li Ran.\u201d\u201cNot Li Ran?\u201dVenerable Hao Yue frowned, \u201cThen how did my disciple die?\u201dYue Jianli said, \u201cIn the final trial, the three of us fought a decisive battle against the ancient demon, and Song Qingsong was killed on the spot by the berserk demon. It was that simple.\u201dAs soon as these words were spoken, a wave of low cries sounded out in the hall.\u201cThere\u2019s an ancient beast?\u201d\u201cThis secret realm was actually so dangerous?\u201dEven Venerable Hao Yue was shocked. He shook his head and asked, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible! Even if the beast has the most diluted bloodline, it\u2019s still not something that can be fought against by a Golden Core Realm cultivator. How did you two survive?\u201dYue Jianli sneered and asked, \u201cYou mean we should die alongside Song Qingsong?\u201dVenerable Hao Yue\u2019s breathing became sluggish. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant\u2026\u201dYue Jianli said, \u201cIt was killed by me and Li Ran working together. After the final trial, both of us ran out of qi and went our separate ways.\u201dHer words contained both the truth and lie, making it very difficult for people to find loopholes in her statement.Venerable Hao Yue\u2019s eyes flickered. \u201cThen where have you been for a few days after you left the secret realm?\u201dYue Jianli raised her eyebrows and said, \u201cThis is my personal matter. There\u2019s no need for me to report it to you.\u201dVenerable Hao Yue\u2019s eyes were cold. \u201cCould you be with Li Ran?\u201d\u201cHao Yue!\u201d The Myriad Sword Pavilion Elder angrily rebuked, \u201cYou\u2019re framing me. Your disciple isn\u2019t strong enough to live, so why are you throwing dirty water at my Myriad Sword Pavilion?\u201dVenerable Hao Yue immediately became angry when he heard that. He cupped his hands to the stage and said, \u201cSect leader, I think the death of Qingsong is rather strange! Sect Master, please take action and investigate Yue Jianli\u2019s memories. Only then will the truth be revealed!\u201dYue Jianli\u2019s eyes instantly turned cold.If she was to be tested, everything would be over.\u201cChief Yue, this action can prove your innocence. Do you have any objections?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Yue Jianli\u2019s voice was piercingly cold. \u201cWhy would I need to prove my innocence to you? Immortal destinies were bound to be accompanied by danger. Why should someone be blamed for another\u2019s death?!\u201dAs soon as her words were spoken, the hall fell silent.Chen Yundao said indifferently, \u201cI only want the truth.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already told you the truth!\u201d Yue Jianli said angrily, \u201cBecause your sect\u2019s disciple died, you want to investigate my memories and see my trump cards? Your Supreme Dao Palace is really impressive. Do you really think that my Myriad Sword Sect is a weakling!\u201dClang!With a push of her thumb, her sword qi surged.Faced with an Emperor-level expert, she abruptly unsheathed herself.The atmosphere was extremely solemn.Everyone was dumbstruck by this scene.Yue Jianli hadn\u2019t broken through the Golden Core Realm, yet she dared to draw her sword against an Emperor Rank expert?!She must be tired of living!Even the Myriad Swords Pavilion Elder was startled as he gulped nervously.Chen Yundao leaned against the back of the chair. His face was covered by a shadow and his expression was not clearly seen.After a long time, he said indifferently, \u201cChief Yue is right. This is indeed inappropriate. I was rash.\u201dHao Yue\u2019s expression immediately changed.At this moment, a disciple ran in. \u201cChief, I have a letter for you!\u201dChen Yundao frowned and said, \u201cWho wrote this letter to make you so flustered.\u201dThe disciple looked around and swallowed. \u201cYes, it\u2019s from Leng Wuyan\u2026\u201d\u201cWho?\u201c\u201cThat demon?!\u201dThe hall was in an uproar.Even Chen Yundao, who had always been calm, suddenly stood up, his expression extremely shocked.\u201cLeng Wuyan sent me a letter? This\u2026 bring the letter.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201c The disciple hastily handed over the letter.Chen Yundao took out the jade and poured his qi into it. He listened carefully.Then, he slowly returned to his chair.After a moment of silence, he said, \u201cChief Yue probably won\u2019t lie. Since that\u2019s the case, there\u2019s no need to mention it anymore.\u201d\u201cSect Leader\u2026\u201d Hao Yue became anxious.Chen Yundao raised his hand and snapped, \u201cSend everyone from the Myriad Sword Pavilion down the mountain.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe nearby elder responded and guided Yue Jianli and the others out of the hall.The hall fell silent.Venerable Hao Yue whispered, \u201cSect leader, Qingsong\u2019s death is strange\u2026\u201dHe felt that this matter had something to do with Li Ran!Chen Yundao shook his head and said, \u201cBut you don\u2019t have any proof. Let\u2019s stop here!\u201d\u201cAlso, the matter of you dealing with Li Ran has already reached Leng Wuyan\u2019s ears. I advise you to stay in seclusion in the sect and try not to leave.\u201d\u201cLeng Wuyan?\u201d Hao Yue\u2019s throat tightened slightly.She received this news too quickly!\u201cI know\u2026\u201d Hao Yue was dejected.\u2014Yue Jianli and the others descended from the mountain.\u201cJianli, you were too impulsive just now. You actually dared to draw your sword against Chen Yundao!\u201dThat was an Emperor powerhouse! He could destroy them with a single finger!Yue Jianli similarly heaved a sigh of relief.It was a lie to say that she was not afraid.However, the more time she spent hesitating, the more chance she might get caught.If Chen Yundao were to notice something, then it would be a calamity.At this moment, the conversation between the disciples of the Supreme Dao Palace drew her attention.\u201cDid you know that Xiao Qingge\u2019s cultivation has recovered!\u201d\u201cI heard from my relatives in Wuyang City that it\u2019s the truth! Furthermore, it was related to Devil Sheng Zi Li Ran!\u201d\u201cOh? What does it have to do with that demon?\u201d\u201cXiao Qingge and Li Ran are to be married. It was Li Ran who used immortal materials, the spirit fruit, to recover her talent!\u201d\u201cIs that for real?\u201d\u2014Yue Jianli\u2019s hand on her sword trembled.\u201cSo he stole my fruit for the sake of another woman!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m risking my life for him here, but he\u2019s courting girls\u2026\u201d\u201cThis bad egg\u2026\u201d Yue Jianli gritted her teeth and said, \u201cElder, you can go back first, I have to go somewhere else.\u201dThe elder was stunned. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cWuyang City!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80: A Treasure, the Immortal Binding Rope!\u201cOne, two\u2026 One, two\u2026\u201dIn the Li family secret ground, Li Ran was squatting while carrying the Demon Suppressing Stone.His body was drenched in blood mixed with sweat, and his muscles were bulging. He was more than a head taller than before.This was his state after activating the bloodline power.There was no need to rely on any qi, and his physical strength would be able to soar.His strength, speed, and recovery ability were all greatly enhanced. At the same time, his sense of pain was weakened.He was transformed into a humanoid vicious beast that didn\u2019t know tiredness or pain.However, it wasn\u2019t entirely without side effects.When he kept his bloodline awakened, Li Ran\u2019s thoughts seemed to be disturbed, becoming easily irritable and annoyed.The longer the activation time, the greater the degree of influence.If his sclera were to be completely infected by the crimson shade, he would completely lose consciousness, leaving only murderous intent behind.Boom!Li Ran threw the boulder, causing the entire secret ground to rumble.The blood on his body gradually dissipated, and his dark red eyes returned to normal.In the pavilion\u2026Li Wuqiang crossed his legs and put down his teacup. \u201cRemember to put the door back for me later.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d Li Ran walked over and sat down. He picked up the teapot and poured it into his mouth.\u201cDrink slowly! This is an authentic immortal tea!\u201d Li Wuqiang\u2019s heart ached.Li Ran looked at him disdainfully, \u201cOld Ancestor, you\u2019re too buttoned up. You got a heartache from just me drinking your tea?\u201d\u201c Tch, do you think this old man doesn\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve been wasting your time with me every day, don\u2019t you want to get some precious treasure from me?\u201dWhen Li Ran was seen through, he couldn\u2019t help but scratch his head and laugh awkwardly.\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to leave. Why don\u2019t you lend me your treasures? I\u2019ll return it to you when I reach the Tribulation Realm.\u201d\u201cGood thinking, if you don\u2019t want to return my treasures, how can I find you?\u201d Li Wuqiang rolled his eyes.Looking at Li Ran\u2019s depressed expression, Li Wuqiang was angry.He rolled his eyes and said, \u201cForget it. For the sake of your persistence, I\u2019ll lend you a treasure for my sake.\u201dLi Ran\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cWhat treasure?\u201dWith a flip of his palm, a red rope appeared in his hand.\u201cThis is a binding Immortal Artifact, Immortal Rope. It can bind an enemy after activation, and it\u2019s extremely swift! It can bind both gods and demons alike. It\u2019s a good treasure for home traveling, killing, and setting fires.\u201dLi Ran took the rope and saw a faint divine light shining from it. There was a faint fragrance coming from it.It seemed to have some origin.\u201cAlright, thank you!\u201d Li Ran was no longer polite. He put the treasure away and slipped away.Li Wuqiang looked at his back and shook his head. \u201cThis brat.\u201dLi Ran was actually quite impressed by this ancestor.As an Emperor-level expert, he was willing to protect the Li family\u2019s secret ground for a hundred years for the sake of an ancestral command.He knew that he could not do it.\u201cYoung master.\u201d\u201cGreetings, Young Master.\u201dAlong the way, the family disciples stopped and lowered their heads when they saw him.His status had been extraordinary, to begin with, but now, his status as a \u201cyoung master\u201d was even more admirable and terrifying.Li Ran\u2019s expression was indifferent to their actions.He was used to this.At this moment, a wave of noise entered his ears.\u201cYou useless dog. You can\u2019t even hold a basin of water. What\u2019s the point of living?\u201dA six or seven-year-old girl fell to the ground. Her body was drenched with water, dripping down her hair.A man in charge was pointing at her and cursing her.\u201cThe Shen family is a cheap family. They\u2019re all trash from the top to the bottom. No wonder they can\u2019t even protect their own family!\u201dThe little girl\u2019s expression was indifferent. She stood up and picked up the basin, quietly listening to her opponent\u2019s insults.Clearly, she was already numb to this.Ever since her family was taken over, this kind of insult and punishment had become her daily routine. At one point, she even felt that her life should continue like this.Seeing that she didn\u2019t speak, the housekeeper became even angrier. \u201cYou\u2019re dumb!\u201dHe raised his hand and struck towards her!Pa!The little girl closed her eyes, but the familiar pain did not come.When she opened her eyes again, she was completely stunned.A tall figure stood in front of her and firmly grabbed the housekeeper\u2019s hand.\u201cWho is it?\u201d The housekeeper furrowed his brows and turned around. As a result, cold sweat flowed down her face.\u201cYoung, Young Master?!\u201dLi Ran asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dThe housekeeper smiled fawningly. \u201cThis bitch is disobedient. I\u2019m trying to discipline her!\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201cLi Ran raised his eyebrows and said, \u201cIf she\u2019s a slut, then what kind of noble are you?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d The housekeeper was stunned for a moment. He felt that something wasn\u2019t right. \u201cYoung master, she is a servant girl from the Shen family. Her identity is indeed low\u2026\u201dKacha!Before he could finish his sentence, his arm was twisted. His broken bones pierced through his skin, and his entire arm was covered in blood!\u201cAh!\u201d The housekeeper knelt on the ground and howled miserably\u2026Everyone looked at him with shock. Even the little girl was confused.Li Ran rubbed his hands in disgust and said indifferently, \u201cShut up.\u201d\u201cWu Wu Wu.\u201d The housekeeper tightly clenched his left hand, not daring to make a sound. Tears and snot flowed down his face.He couldn\u2019t understand how he had offended the young master.Li Ran looked at the little girl in front of him.Her eyes were clear, her lips were red and she had a pair of white teeth. She looked a bit like Ah Qin. It wasn\u2019t difficult to tell that she would be a beauty in the future.Her pink little face was still a little plump, but her eyes were calm and indifferent. They did not match her age.He could see bruises on her exposed skin. These were all marks left behind after she was beaten.\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Li Ran asked.The little girl answered softly, \u201cShen Ning.\u201d\u201cWho is Shen Qin to you?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s my sister.\u201d\u201cAs expected\u2026\u201dLi Ran thought for a moment and asked, \u201cHave you tested your cultivation talent?\u201dShen Ning shook her head and said in a low voice, \u201cThe Shen family is not worthy of cultivation.\u201dWhat she said seemed to be a matter of fact.Looking at her low-browed expression, Li Ran felt a wave of confusion in his heart.\u201cThe Shen Family is also human. You can do what others can.\u201cLi Ran took out a token and placed it in Shen Ning\u2019s hand. \u201cRemember to test your talent at the Immortal Ascension Assembly next year. If you can cultivate, take it to Mount Xuanling. Someone will bring you to me.\u201dAs long as she had a trace of talent, Li Ran would bring her to the Immortal Path.This was the only way to change her fate. It was also a small compensation to A\u2019qin.When the butler saw this scene, his face instantly turned ashen.The little girl took the token in a daze and asked, \u201cAm I really qualified to cultivate?\u201dLi Ran rubbed her head and smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, even if you don\u2019t have talent, no one in the Li family will dare to bully you again.\u201dThe little girl looked at the handsome face in front of her and felt the warmth coming from her palm. Her calm eyes stirred up waves for the first time.He was like tiny candlelight that dispersed all the darkness.\u2014Xiao Family\u2019s residence.Xiao Qingge looked at the green-robed girl in front of her and her scalp turned numb.\u201cWhy is she here?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81: Li Ran, I hate you to death!Xiao Qingge knew Yue Jianli.Placed second on the Heavenly Genius Ranking, she was the youngest Chief Disciple of the Myriad Sword Pavillion.Although Yue Jianli\u2019s age was similar to hers, she had already reached the Golden Core Realm. She was truly the beloved daughter of Heaven.She was also an existence that was comparable to Li Ran.\u201cWhy is she here? Could it be because of the secret realm?\u201d Xiao Qingge thought to herself.While she was looking at Yue Jianli, Yue Jianli was also looking at her.Her face was clear and beautiful, and she was indeed a beauty.\u201cIt really is her! It\u2019s the mortal who followed Li Ran in the secret realm.\u201d\u201cNo wonder Li Ran has been protecting her. So the two of them are tied in a marriage contract!\u201dThe more Yue Jianli thought about it, the angrier she became. She crushed the teacup in her hand.Xiao Qingge\u2019s heart skipped a beat.She seemed to come here to find trouble!She said, \u201cChief Yue, may I know why you came to the Xiao family?\u201dYue Jianli calmed down and said lightly, \u201cNothing. I just wanted to meet Miss Xiao.\u201d\u201cMeet me?\u201d Xiao Qingge was taken aback. \u201cWe don\u2019t seem to know each other very well, do we?\u201d\u201cMiss Xiao is really forgetful.\u201d Yue Jianli sneered. \u201cIsn\u2019t it Li Ran who stole the fruit that allowed you to restore your cultivation?\u201dXiao Qingge\u2019s eyes narrowed.So it was because of this matter. As expected, the person who came was not friendly!\u201cHeaven, earth, and treasures. Those who have virtue live in them. Although Chief Yue discovered it first, to claim the fruit as yours is a different matter!\u201d Xiao Qingge was prepared to make a move.The fruit had been eaten. There was no chance of returning it.Yue Jianli shook her head and said, \u201cMiss Xiao has misunderstood. I have no intention of asking you to repay me.\u201dLi Ran was very kind to her. Not to mention a fruit, if the other party needed it, she would risk her life.However, there was an inexplicable urge in her heart to drive her to see Xiao Qingge.\u201cThen what does Chief Yue mean?\u201d Xiao Qingge was confused.Yue Jianli did not reply. Instead, she asked, \u201cI heard that you and Li Ran are engaged?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Xiao Qingge nodded.Yue Jianli asked again, \u201cBut I remember that Youluo Temple has a rule that forbids disciples from marrying. Why would he get engaged to you?\u201dXiao Qingge didn\u2019t know why the other party was concerned about this matter, but she still explained, \u201cThe engagement was made by two ancestors. We were still young and at that time, Li Ran hadn\u2019t joined Youluo Temple yet.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dYue Jianli let out a sigh of relief and nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s just an arranged marriage. It\u2019s not Li Ran\u2019s wish.\u201d\u201cChief Yue, you seem to be very happy?\u201d Xiao Qingge was confused.Intuition told her that something was wrong with this woman.Yue Jianli blushed. \u201cNothing. I\u2019m just curious\u2026 When do you plan to annul the engagement?\u201dSomething was wrong\u2026Something was wrong!Xiao Qingge cleared her throat and said, \u201cEven though it\u2019s my parents\u2019 order and a matchmaker\u2019s words, Li Ran and I are in a good relationship. Why would we annul the engagement?\u201dYue Jianli raised her eyebrows and said, \u201cAs long as Li Ran is in Youluo Temple, he can never get married. Why would Miss Xiao waste her good years?\u201dXiao Qingge humphed, \u201cIt\u2019s my business to waste my years. Chief Yue, aren\u2019t you being too broad-minded?!\u201dNow, if she couldn\u2019t tell what\u2019s going on, she would be a fool!This Yue Jianli definitely liked Li Ran!\u201cIndeed, I\u2019m the one who said too much.\u201d Yue Jianli did not say anything else. She stood up with the sword in her hand and said, \u201cGoodbye.\u201dXiao Qingge looked at her back and her heart was filled with rage. \u201cNo matter what, Li Ran and I are on good terms. I beg Chief Yue to respect us!\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Yue Jianli turned around, her eyes cold.Their gazes collided in the air and sparks flew everywhere.\u2014Li Ran took care of Shen Ning and applied the medicine to her before leaving.He walked towards the Xiao family.Xiao Qingge was no longer a disciple of the Supreme Dao Palace, so she couldn\u2019t cultivate the Supreme Dao Palace\u2019s sutra anymore. Her cultivation was at a standstill.Also, he had obtained a copy of \u201cThe Jade Maiden Rakshasa Sutra\u201d from Li Wuqiang.This cultivation technique was of a very high level. It was enough for him to cultivate until he reached Emperor Realm, so he could give it to Xiao Qingge.On the way, the crowd suddenly surged around them. Everyone looked very excited.He could even hear the words \u201cXiao family\u201d, \u201cXiao Qingge\u201d and \u201cfight\u201d.Li Ran\u2019s brows furrowed, \u201cCould it be that in Wuyang City, there is still someone who dares to cause trouble for the Xiao family?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t help speed up.Just as he arrived near the Xiao family, he saw two people fighting in the open space in front of him.One of them had long hair fluttering in the wind. She was incomparably beautiful. Of course, it was Xiao Qingge.As for the other party, she wore a green robe and held a longsword in her hands. Her brows were full of heroic spirit.Li Ran was stunned.\u201cYue Jianli? Why is she here? No, why are they fighting?\u201dBoom!The two of them clashed with each other.Xiao Qingge flew backward, while Yue Jianli remained motionless.Yue Jianli was very strong. Even if Xiao Qingge had recovered her cultivation, she would not be a match for her.However, she had always restrained herself, and her sword had not been unsheathed.\u201cStop it. You\u2019re no match for me.\u201d Yue Jianli shook her head.\u201cHmph, so what? No matter how high your cultivation is, Li Ran wouldn\u2019t want you!\u201d Xiao Qingge said angrily.\u201cWhat did you say? Say it again?\u201d Yue Jianli looked sullen.\u201cI said, you should give up. Li Ran won\u2019t like a violent person like you!\u201d Xiao Qingge shouted.Cang Lang!The sword was unsheathed.The sword qi roiled and pushed the surrounding crowd back several meters.Yue Jianli\u2019s voice was bone-piercing. \u201cSince you said I was violent, I\u2019ll show you violence!\u201dThe divine light of the long sword blossomed and instantly turned into a huge sword.Like a dark cloud, it shrouded over Xiao Qingge\u2019s head!Xiao Qingge\u2019s expression was serious as if she was facing a great enemy.Her intuition told her that she could not take this strike.\u201cStop!\u201d Seeing that something was about to happen, Li Ran appeared between the two of them. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why are you guys fighting?\u201dHe looked around.On one side was Xiao Qingge, pouting her lips and looking aggrieved.On the other side was Yue Jianli. Her face was ashen and cold as frost.Li Ran gulped. \u201cThere must be some misunderstanding\u2026\u201dYue Jianli sneered. \u201cLi Ran, you\u2019re just in time! Then you can take this strike in her stead!\u201dShe pressed down with both hands, and the huge sword slashed towards him.Li Ran stood still and did not dodge.\u201cLi Ran, be careful!\u201d Xiao Qingge exclaimed.Seeing that the huge sword was about to strike him, she stopped it and his clothes fluttered.Yue Jianli said hatefully, \u201cLi Ran, I hate you to death! I never want to see you again!\u201dLi Ran rubbed his forehead. \u201cWhat is this?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82: The Real Usage of the Immortal Binding Rope!Yue Jianli flew through the streets, completely ignoring the eyes of others.She didn\u2019t know what was wrong with her.Memories of Li Ran came flooding in her mind. From tit for tat to fighting side by side to experiencing a life and death moment together.Li Ran, who was unyielding to the extreme and refused to kneel, supported her up the stairs, thawing her cold heart as they ascended the stairs.This scene was engraved in her heart, and she couldn\u2019t forget it no matter what.In that small Yunxiao village, Li Ran had lost his cultivation and could only let her take care of him.As a result, the distance between them was shortened.This was the most unforgettable moment of her life.Li Ran was sometimes cold and gentle, sometimes reliable and sometimes unrestrained. Occasionally, he appeared like a gangster, but he was not annoying. Instead, he made her blush and made her heart beat faster.This was the first time that Yue Jianli\u2019s sword heart was filled with waves.Therefore, after hearing that he had an engagement, she flew to Wuyang City throughout the day and night.But when Li Ran blocked her attack, which was directed at Xiao Qingge, Yue Jianli woke up.\u201cWhat is my relationship with him? What qualifications did I have to question Xiao Qingge? What am I to him\u2026\u201dStanding in an empty alley, Yue Jianli\u2019s expression was bitter.\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s time to return to the sect.\u201dCough cough\u2026A male voice sounded in her ears. \u201cI say, sister, you ran quite fast. I almost couldn\u2019t catch up.\u201dYue Jianli suddenly turned around and saw Li Ran smiling at her.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you keeping your wife company?\u201dShe turned her head and said, \u201cDo you want to vent her anger?\u201dLi Ran smiled and said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t have the intention to make a move. Otherwise, Qingge wouldn\u2019t even be able to take three moves.\u201dHearing the word \u201cQingge\u201d, Yue Jianli\u2019s face turned pale. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. If you hadn\u2019t taken another step, I\u2019d have already killed her!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLi Ran felt a little helpless.This girl\u2019s temper was just like the stone in the pit, smelly and hard\u2026\u201cOh right, didn\u2019t you say you were going to Flying Cloud Peak? Why did you come to Wuyang?\u201d Li Ran curiously asked.\u201cI came down from the mountain two days ago,\u201d Yue Jianli said.\u201cTwo days ago?\u201dLi Ran was confused.Flying Cloud Peak was located in the western region, which was located extremely far away from Wuyang City, almost halfway across middle earth\u2026\u2026Looking at Yue Jianli\u2019s pale lips, he suddenly thought of something. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have flown for two days and two nights?\u201dGolden Core Realm experts did not have the ability to cross the void.Other than a teleportation formation, one could only fly to a certain place with their strength.Even Iron Man couldn\u2019t hold on for so long!\u201cIt has nothing to do with you. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Yue Jianli was stubborn.Li Ran grabbed her arm and examined her with his qi. He saw that her meridians were empty, and even her Golden Core was dim.This was a sign of forcefully activating one\u2019s qi. If she didn\u2019t rest, her foundation might be damaged.\u201cYue Jianli, are you crazy? You were risking your life!\u201d Li Ran said angrily.\u201cI told you, you don\u2019t have to care!\u201d\u201cI just have to take care of you!\u201d Li Ran pulled her out of the alley, \u201cCome, follow me home!\u201d\u201cWhy would I go to your house?\u201d Yue Jianli struggled.\u201cTo sleep!\u201d\u201cSleep, sleep?!\u201d\u201cWhat, what are you trying to do? I am not a casual person!\u201d Li Ran\u2019s brows jumped. He could not be bothered to waste words with her. He directly took out the Immortal Binding Rope and threw it at her.He planned to subdue her first and then bring her home to rest.Otherwise, this fierce horse would cause trouble.Yue Jianli was stunned. \u201cWhat is this\u2026\u201dThe rope grew longer and quickly wrapped around her, instantly tying her up.Her hands were tied behind her back, and her body was tied in a place that should not be tied at all.Combined with the faint fragrance, her degree of shame exploded.The two looked at each other in dismay.Li Ran was speechless. \u201c\u2026\u201dYue Jianli was also speechless. \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou brute! Hurry up and untie me!\u201d Yue Jianli came back to her senses and struggled.However, the more she struggled, the tighter the Immortal Binding Rope\u2019s restraint became.In the end, she let out a low cry. Her face was red as she stood there, not daring to move.\u201cThis is the Immortal Artifact Old Li spoke of? How unreliable!\u201d Li Ran covered his face.Yue Jianli glared at him hatefully. It seemed like she wanted to bite him.\u201cForget it, let\u2019s bring her home first.\u201dLi Ran carried her on his shoulder and flew towards the Li Mansion.\u201cYoung master.\u201d\u201cGreetings, young master.\u201dThe servants greeted Yue Jianli while secretly looking at him. Their expressions were very interesting.\u201cWho is that girl? It doesn\u2019t seem to be Miss Xiao.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never seen her before, but she\u2019s really beautiful.\u201d\u201cSo the young master likes women.\u201d\u201cHow exciting!\u201d\u201cSigh, when will the young master come to tie me up?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re thinking of fart.\u201dHearing the surrounding discussions, Yue Jianli successfully experienced what it meant to get shamed in public.\u201cLi Ran, I will definitely kill you!\u201dLi Ran nodded. \u201cAlright, but that\u2019ll have to wait until you wake up.\u201dHe carried Yue Jianli back to his room.He threw her on the bed and covered her with a blanket.\u201cRest well.\u201dYue Jianli wriggled and blinked his large eyes. \u201cBut it\u2019s too tight. I can\u2019t sleep.\u201d\u201cI think so too\u2026\u201d Li Ran rubbed his chin and said, \u201cThen you have to promise that you won\u2019t run.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201c Yue Jianli nodded.As a result, Li Ran released the Immortal Binding Rope, and she pounced at him, \u201cYou bad egg, I\u2019ll fight you to the death!\u201dLi Ran was already on guard and held her down. \u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t be honest\u2026\u201dYue Jianli was so angry that she bit his arm.\u201cDamn, are you a dog?\u201dLi Ran did not dare to use his qi. He was afraid that he would break her teeth.In desperation, he raised his right hand and pushed her.Pa!The air instantly fell silent.Yue Jianli didn\u2019t move at all, as if she had been hit by someone.Li Ran sensed the elastic feeling and slowly turned his head to look, his body stiffening.\u201cIf I\u2019m going to say that I didn\u2019t do it on purpose\u2026 Would you believe me?\u201d\u201cStinky bastard! I\u2019ll kill you!\u201dBoom!Like an earthquake, the entire room began to tremble.The servants outside shivered in unison.\u201cThis is too intense!\u201d\u201cAs expected of the young master, strong and invincible!\u201d\u201cTruly a generational model!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83: You Even Dared to Seduce Yue Jianli?It took half an hour before the room finally quieted down.The two of them stared at each other, each of them panting.\u201cHave you played enough?\u201d Li Ran asked.Yue Jianli shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ll take a break and continue the fight later.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLi Ran explained, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything else. I just want you to have a good rest. If you were to overexert your qi again, your foundation would be damaged.\u201dIf she were to forcefully activate qi while her dantian was empty, she would only draw qi from her Golden Core.This aligned with the original saying of \u201cdepleting one\u2019s vitality\u201d.Under normal circumstances, it would take a while to recuperate. However, if Yue Jianli was to go all out like this, her foundation might be damaged.This wasn\u2019t just a minor problem; her future prospects could be affected.After all, not everyone was like Li Ran, who had Heaven Seizing Technique to protect his core.Yue Jianli blushed. \u201cThen, you can\u2019t hit me.\u201dHer entire body was still numb as if there was a little ant crawling near her.Li Ran scratched his head awkwardly. \u201cI really didn\u2019t mean it. Besides, didn\u2019t you also bite me several times?\u201dWhen Yue Jianli saw the clear tooth marks on his arm, she was so embarrassed that she couldn\u2019t wait to find a hole to hide in.She was also pushed into a hurry. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t have done such a thing.\u201cHow does it feel?\u201d She asked softly.\u201cAh?\u201d Li Ran gulped, \u201cIt feels good. Round and bouncy, indeed very good\u2026\u201d\u201cI meant the bite wound!\u201d\u201c???\u201dThe atmosphere immediately turned awkward.Yue Jianli pulled over the blanket to cover her head. She was so shy that she didn\u2019t dare to show her face.Ahem\u2026Li Ran said, \u201cThen you can rest. I\u2019ll leave first.\u201d\u201cWait, wait\u2026\u201dYue Jianli reached out of the blanket and grabbed the corner of his shirt. \u201cThere were so many people watching just now, don\u2019t go out yet\u2026 it\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d\u201cOh, okay.\u201dLi Ran sat back by the bed.\u201cI can\u2019t sleep in broad daylight, why don\u2019t you talk to me?\u201d Yue Jianli said in a muffled voice.Li Ran smiled and said, \u201cHow can I talk to you when you\u2019re hiding under the blanket?\u201dYue Jianli was silent for a moment.Then, she poked her head out of the blanket like a mouse.However, her eyes fluttered and she did not dare to look at Li Ran.Li Ran suddenly remembered something and asked, \u201cWhat happened after you went to Flying Cloud Peak? Did the Supreme Dao Palace make things difficult for you?\u201dHer purpose in flying to Flying Cloud Peak was due to Song Qingsong\u2019s death.It was said that Venerable Hao Yue was very protective and difficult to deal with. He wasn\u2019t a good person.Yue Jianli told him about his experience in the Supreme Dao Palace.When Li Ran heard that Honorable Hao Yue was about to investigate her memories and force her to draw her sword against Chen Yundao, his eyes turned cold.\u201cHao Yue? Very well, I\u2019ll remember you,\u201d He thought to himself.He was just a Venerable One.With Li Ran\u2019s talent, it was only a matter of time before he crushed him.He looked at Yue Jianli and shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re too rash. You dare to draw your sword against Chen Daoyun\u2026 a truly ruthless person.\u201dThe reason the Righteous path was so strong was because of Sect Master Chen.Even though he cultivated the righteous path, he was extremely decisive. His hands were stained with blood.He had used his own strength to suppress the Three Great Devil\u2019s Doctrine and suppressed the entire Devil\u2019s Doctrine to the point of gasping for breath.Only after Leng Wuyan and Youluo Temple showed up did he gradually stop showing his face.Yue Jianli said helplessly, \u201cI know, but with the situation at that time, as long as I show any hesitation or weakness, something big will happen.\u201dLi Ran was silent.Faced with the threat and questioning of an Emperor-level expert, one could imagine the pressure.\u201cThank you. You have worked hard.\u201d He rubbed Yue Jianli\u2019s head.Yue Jianli snorted and said, \u201cI\u2019m also responsible for Song Qingsong\u2019s death. It\u2019s not for you\u2026\u201dHowever, he did not move his hand.\u201cThen why did you rush to Wuyang City in an urgent manner?\u201d Li Ran felt something was a little strange.What emergency made her fly for two days and two nights in a row? She almost hurt her foundation.Yue Jianli blushed. \u201cI won\u2019t tell you.\u201d\u201cForget it, let\u2019s not talk about it.\u201dLi Ran took out a pill and handed it to her. \u201cThis is a Primordial Pill that can strengthen one\u2019s body. Eat it and rest well.\u201dYue Jianli didn\u2019t resist. She swallowed the pill and withdrew into the blanket.Before long, her breathing became even and she had already fallen into a deep sleep.She was indeed too tired.Li Ran tucked her under the blanket and got up to walk out of the room.Just as he opened the door, he saw Li Daoyuan walking away.\u201cDad, what are you doing?\u201d Li Ran smiled.\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just taking a walk.\u201dLi Daoyuan pulled him to the side and said in frustration, \u201cRan\u2019er, you are the Sheng Zi of the Youluo Temple. It is strictly forbidden to fall in love! It\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t annul the engagement with the Xiao family, but why did you bring another one back? What if you are expelled from the sect?\u201dLi Ran patted him on the shoulder. \u201cCalm down. This girl is just a friend of mine.\u201dLi Daoyuan snorted. \u201cYou think I\u2019m stupid? A friend can be carried back like that by you?\u201dLi Ran said, \u201cThis is a misunderstanding.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the misunderstanding. Let her go back quickly. Don\u2019t let your master know\u2026 By the way, which lady is she?\u201d\u201cThe Yue Family.\u201d\u201cThe Yue family?\u201d Li Daoyuan carefully thought about it, \u201cOur Wuyang City doesn\u2019t have a family with the surname Yue?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s not a local. She\u2019s from the Myriad Sword Pavilion.\u201d\u201cMyriad Sword Pavilion?!\u201d Li Daoyuan was startled. Then, he suddenly thought of something and said in shock, \u201cIs she Yue Jianli?!\u201dLi Ran nodded. \u201cCongratulations, you\u2019re correct.\u201dLi Daoyuan grabbed his ear and said in exasperation, \u201cYou\u2019re too bold, even targeting Yue Jianli? You\u2019re a genuine demon! Do you have any conscience in your heart?\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s a demon? Do you mean your son?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not my son. I don\u2019t know you anymore.\u201d\u201cIs that necessary\u2026\u201d\u201cYou have Leng Wuyan covering you. You\u2019re not afraid! What if the people from the Myriad Sword Pavilion came to kill me?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that enough for a meal?\u201d\u201cI f**king\u2026\u201dThe two of them walked away arguing.\u2014The next morning\u2026Li Ran brought his breakfast and opened the door. \u201cBreakfast is here.\u201dBefore he could finish his sentence, he was stunned. He saw that the sheets were neatly folded.However, she had already disappeared.\u201cReally, leaving without a greeting.\u201dLi Ran shook his head and smiled. Just as he was about to turn around and leave, he found a note on the bed.He picked it up and saw that there was only a line of words on it.[I\u2019ll definitely kill you next time.]Li Ran was speechless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84: Li Ran\u2019s Compensation!Yue Jianli stood on the street and gazed at the entrance of Li Manor.Her eyes were not filled with sadness and disappointment but were full of vivid glow.She finally faced her heart.\u201cSo what if he has a marriage contract? As long as Li Ran is still a disciple of the Youluo Temple, he can not marry Xiao Qingge!\u201cI still have a lot of time!\u201d\u201cIf I want to break this rule, I only need to be stronger than Leng Wuyan!\u201d Yue Jianli smirked. \u201cCoincidentally, I\u2019m best at becoming stronger!\u201dShe turned around and left.Her green robes fluttered unrestrained.However, Yue Jianli did not know that this rule had long been broken by the rule setter, Leng Wuyan, herself.\u2014Boom!The door of the secret ground was kicked open. Li Ran was covered in blood as he strode over to Li Wuqiang.\u201cSo angry in the early morning?\u201d Li Wuqiang drank his tea calmly.Pa!Li Ran threw the Immortal Binding Rope on the table. \u201cI\u2019m returning this!\u201dLi Wuqi was amused. \u201cDid you use this rope?\u201d\u201cNonsense!\u201d Li Ran looked displeased. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be so old and still a pervert. You\u2019re trying to trick me into thinking that this is an immortal rope. Shameful!\u201d\u201cWho tricked you?\u201d Li Wuqiang said as a matter-of-fact, \u201cYou said there is something wrong with my description? It could tie her up, correct? Did I say something wrong?\u201dLi Ran had never seen such a shameless person.\u201cAnd this rope is indeed a treasure. Although it looks pretty cheap, it\u2019s really useful. Especially for female cultivators. No matter how high your cultivation is, you can bind her and even smell the mesmerizing fragrance.\u201d\u201cStop,\u201d Li Ran said disdainfully, \u201cYou can\u2019t be from the Hehuan Sect. You\u2019re too shameless.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to\u2026\u201d Li Wuqiang stretched out his hand and was about to retrieve the rope, but before he could finish speaking, Li Ran had already put away the rope.He said in a righteous manner, \u201cI don\u2019t trust you with such a vulgar thing. I\u2019ll take care of it myself.\u201dLi Wuqiang nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re more shameless than me, grandson.\u201dLi Ran cleared his throat and said, \u201cNo matter what, I have been traumatized. You have to compensate me.\u201dThe corners of Li Wuqiang\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cYou still want to be shameless?\u201d\u201cThen I won\u2019t cultivate any more. I will never cross the tribulation. You can just stay here obediently.\u201d\u201cHow ruthless! What compensation do you want? I\u2019ve already declared that the dharma treasure is gone.\u201dLi Ran shook his head and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want the dharma treasure. I just want you to protect someone.\u201dLi Wuqiang was taken aback. \u201cWho?\u201d\u201cXiao Qingge.\u201dLi Ran had been thinking about this.Wuyang City\u2019s matter was basically resolved. He was about to return to the sect immediately. The Li Family had an emperor overseeing it, so he wasn\u2019t worried.However, Xiao Qingge was different.The death of the Xiao Family\u2019s Ancestor meant that she had lost her supreme combat strength, and she didn\u2019t have the protection of a sect.Even though Wuyang City was still considered to be peaceful, he feared some unpredictable factors.With an Emperor-level expert like Li Wuqiang protecting her, he could still feel a little more at ease.\u201cIt\u2019s your little fianc\u00e9e, right? You really are a romanticist.\u201d Li Wuqiang stroked his beard. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t protect her, but you have to agree to two conditions.\u201d\u201cWhat conditions?\u201d Li Ran asked.Li Wuqi said, \u201cFirst, I\u2019ll only guarantee her safety for ten years. You\u2019ll have to cultivate until you have reached the Heavenly Tribulation Realm within ten years.\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201d Li Ran did not hesitate.This request was very difficult.There had never been a Heavenly Tribulation Realm expert who was under 30 years old in the entire Vast Lands.But no matter if he could succeed or not, ten years of protection was a guarantee. He was sure that he would make a profit.\u201cSecond, if you were to chance upon the personal disciple of the Tianshu Academy\u2019s head, beat him to death!\u201d A trace of hatred flashed in Li Wuqi\u2019s eyes.\u201cTianshu Academy?\u201dLi Ran was taken aback. \u201cYou have a grudge against them?\u201dIt was one of the top sects of the Righteous Path and the only top female cultivator sect.Li Wuqiang snorted coldly, \u201cThe head of Tianshu Academy, Yi Qinglan, has a grudge against me\u2026 But you definitely won\u2019t be able to beat her, so you\u2019ll just have to beat up her disciple.\u201d\u201cAlright, deal.\u201d Li Ran nodded.This request was not difficult.The Tianshu Academy was extraordinary, and their disciples seldom set foot in the mortal world, and the chances of finding the academy\u2019s head are even slimmer.And if they meet each other, so what?As the Devil, does he need explanations for beating up someone?After leaving the secret ground, Li Ran went to Xiao Manor again.He handed the \u2018Rakshasa Sutra\u2019 to Xiao Qingge and urged her to go to the Li family in secret.However, after she found out that Li Ran was going back to the sect, she couldn\u2019t bear it.She was like a koala, latching on Li Ran\u2019s arm and not letting go.Her black and white eyes sparkled with tears.\u201cLi Ran, I can\u2019t bear to part with you\u2026\u201dLi Ran pinched her fair face and consoled her, \u201cIf the relationship is long-lasting, why fear the morning and evening? The path to immortality is long, so is our lifespan. This is just a small interlude.\u201d\u201cThe relationship lasts for a long time, it can last forever\u2026\u201d Xiao Qingge mumbled these words, her eyes filled with admiration, \u201cDarling, you\u2019re really cultured!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only average. It\u2019s the third page in Haotu,\u201d Li Ran spoke shamelessly.Xiao Qingge looked at the \u2018Rakshasa Sutra\u2019 and suddenly said, \u201cLi Ran, I\u2019ve thought of a good way to get married!\u201d\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d Li Ran said curiously.Xiao Qingge put her hands on her waist and said, \u201cAs long as I work hard to cultivate and become stronger than your Master, I can force her to rewrite the rules of the sect. That way, we can get married!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLi Ran gave a thumbs up. \u201cWhat a great dream.\u201dBeyond Leng Wuyan?He knew how terrifying his master was.Even if his talent was as strong as her, he did not know when he would be able to reach his Master\u2019s realm.Even if they were both emperor ranks, there was still a huge gap.Otherwise, why would Li Wuqiang be so scared that he would pee his pants when he heard of Leng Wuyan\u2019s name?\u201cIsn\u2019t it just the Emperor Realm? If she can do it, so can I!\u201dXiao Qingge was full of confidence.In her heart, she had set the goal of 'surpassing Leng Wuyan\u201d.Li Ran looked at her and couldn\u2019t bear to refuse her\u2026\u2026\u2026It wasn\u2019t easy to bid farewell to Xiao Qingge who was sticking like glue. Li Ran returned home and tidied up.After talking to Li Daoyuan, he went to check on that little girl, Shen Ning.\u201cDid you remember what I told you?\u201dLi Ran asked.Shen Ning nodded vigorously. \u201cI remember. Next year, I\u2019ll get my talent tested. If I have any talent, I\u2019ll go find you.\u201d\u201cVery well, I\u2019ll be waiting for you at Mount Xuan Ling.\u201dEmbarking on the cultivation path was a cruel thing.If Shen Ning was lucky, then Li Ran would be willing to help her change her fate. However, if she really was just a mortal, then she would still live a safe life.Just as Li Ran was about to leave, a small hand touched his thumb.He turned around and saw Shen Ning looking at him timidly. \u201cYoung master, young master, I have a small request\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat request? Speak,\u201d Li Ran asked.Shen Ning grabbed his big hand and placed it on his head. Then, he gently stroked it with his eyes narrowed.\u201cJust for a moment.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85: The Righteous Path\u2019s Friendly Gathering!The vast lands were boundless.The geography of the vast lands can be divided into the northern, the southern, the western, the eastern, and the middle territory.The middle territory was the main gathering place in the mortal world, and it was also the area ruled by the Sheng Clan Imperial Court.Wuyang Capital was located in the middle zone of the middle territory.On the other hand, the other regions were in a bad state, such as the Grand Myriad Mountain Range in the southern territory and the eternal deep sea in the far east\u2026 It was very difficult for mortals to survive here.However, the more sparsely populated a place was, the richer the spirit energy would be, and that would be where the sects were located.The location of the Youlou Temple, Mount Xuan Ling, was located in the northern territory of the vast lands. The climate was cold and it was covered with snow all year round.Li Ran left Wuyang City by flight.Although the Heaven Seizing Technique was constantly circulating and replenishing his qi, it was unavoidable that he would feel tired after flying for a long time.He happened to pass by a small city.Li Ran rubbed his head and prepared to go over to eat and rest.\u2014Qingzhou City\u2026Unlike the prosperous and magnificent imperial capital, this small city wasn\u2019t large, and it was mottled with bricks that revealed its long history.At this moment, the city gate was wide open, and the flow of people was like a shuttle. Not even a single officer was present.\u201cAll right, it looks like it\u2019s still a three-way street.\u201d Li Ran slowly walked into the city with his hands behind his back.Stepping on the ravines of the bluestone road, there were white walls and black tiles all around.The streets were bustling with pedestrians\u2019 activity.Some were carrying longswords and sabers, some were wearing monk robes, and there were black figures treading over the roof from time to time.A muscular man with a bamboo hat on his head and a big knife on his back was bargaining with a cake vendor on the side of the street. He was excited as he spat.The scene of the market was overwhelming.\u201cThere are actually so many cultivators in this small city?\u201d Li Ran looked surprised.Just then, he saw no less than five Foundation Establishment cultivators.Qi Refinement Stage was even more outrageous.\u201cCould it be that another treasure has appeared? Or has a secret realm opened?\u201d Li Ran was a little curious.At this moment, a man descended from the sky, launching almost on the pedestrian\u2019s scalp, followed by the wind that brought a large amount of dust.The cake that the strong man had just bought was instantly covered in dust.\u201cF*ck your mother!\u201d He angrily pointed at the man and cursed.The man turned around and smiled disdainfully, \u201cA brainless thing\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish his sentence, a huge palm suddenly appeared in the air. With a \u201cbang\u201d, it smashed the man down like a fly.The man vomited blood, his tendons were broken, and his entire body was embedded in the brick.\u201cDo you think I\u2019m farting after saying that you\u2019re not allowed to fly in the city?\u201d An angry voice rang out from the void.\u201cI really don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d The man\u2019s face was filled with fear as he shivered.The muscular man walked over with a sinister smile. He pulled him out of the brick and dragged his legs out of the city.The blood mark dragged on the ground.The surrounding people\u2019s expressions were indifferent as if they were accustomed to this scene.Li Ran was speechless. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNo wonder there are no guards at the gate. So an expert is overseeing the city!\u201dPower was the order.To cultivators, no matter how many soldiers there were, there was no deterrence. They were far less useful than an expert.At this moment, he heard the whispers of others.\u201cXiang Cheng is really ruthless!\u201d\u201cIf you aren\u2019t ruthless, how can you suppress these sect disciples?\u201d\u201cXiang Cheng studies in the Dao of Traversing. This is his temperament!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that he has a neutral position and won\u2019t participate in the Demon Slaying Conference. Otherwise, our Righteous Path will have another hand!\u201d\u201cWhat a pity!\u201d\u201cDemon Slaying Conference?\u201d Li Ran raised his eyebrows and understood.No wonder these cultivators were gathered here. So they were all here for a gathering!\u201cInteresting. I would like to see what kind of devil these people want to kill.\u201d he smiled.Li Ran casually bought a mask at the roadside stall, then followed behind a few cultivators.\u2014In Yue Xuan, the largest restaurant in Azure Province City.At this moment, the door was crowded with people.The people who came were all dressed in luxurious clothes and armed with swords. They were all practitioners.There was a special receptionist at the door, and every guests\u2019 name would be shouted out.\u201cMisty Cloud Sect\u2019s Fairy Lin, Lin Qianyi, has arrived!\u201dThe white-robed lady walked into the restaurant with a graceful smile on her face.Fellow Daoists who were familiar with her came over to greet her, and those who weren\u2019t familiar nodded in greeting.\u201cThe Young Lord of Qilin Mountain Villa, Young Hero Luo Yong has arrived!\u201d\u201cA direct disciple of the Haotian Sect\u2026\u201dEveryone who entered smiled and cupped their hands in greeting.It was clearly a gathering of friends who were trying to get to know each other.\u201cMyriad Sword Pavilion, Inner Sect Eldest Brother, Chen Zhutian has arrived!\u201dThe restaurant suddenly quieted down, and all eyes were fixed on the door\u2026\u2026.One of the top sects, Myriad Sword Pavillion!\u201cI apologize to everyone for coming late.\u201d Chen Zhutian held his longsword in his hand, his eyes shining brightly as he strode through the door.\u201cSenior Brother Chen!\u201d\u201cSenior Brother Chen is here!\u201dEveryone surrounded him and gave him a warm greeting.Chen Zhutian responded with a smile. His manner was graceful, and he did not treat anyone coldly. He could be considered a socialite.\u201cSenior Brother Chen, please take a seat.\u201dEveryone brought him to the center seat.The receptionist stared blankly at a man wearing a pig\u2019s head mask.This mask\u2026 he didn\u2019t look like someone who was serious!\u201cMay I ask for your distinguished self your sect and name?\u201dLi Ran thought about it for a moment and came up to the receptionist, whispering something.After hearing this, the receptionist scratched his head. \u201cIs such a sect on the Righteous path? Why hadn\u2019t this little one heard of it before? And for your distinguished name\u2026\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard of it! What? You\u00a0dare\u00a0to look down on my sect?\u201d\u201cThis little one did not dare, this little one had no intentions.\u201d The receptionist hurriedly waved his hand.He was only a mortal. No matter which sect it was, he was not someone he could afford to offend.Moreover, although this person was wearing a pig\u2019s head mask, his figure was tall and handsome. He seemed to have some background.Li Ran snorted, \u201cThen why don\u2019t you let me in?\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dThe gatekeeper pondered for a moment and shouted loudly.\u201cThe Chief Grand Disciple of the Hard Bang Gang, Ji Er Bang Ying, has arrived!\u201dThe restaurant fell silent again.Everyone looked at the door curiously. This was the first time they had heard of such a strange sect.Li Ran, wearing a pig\u2019s head mask, walked in proudly and cupped his hands.\u201cEat and drink well, gentlemen.\u201dWhat a bizarre disguise!However, they didn\u2019t take it to heart.There were many cultivators who wore strange clothes. It was normal for them to wear masks.Perhaps there was a wound on his face?Chen Zhutian said curiously, \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve heard of this Hard Country Gang. I wonder what kind of sect it is?\u201d\u201cAnd for this brother\u2019s name, why does it sound pretty vulgar\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86: Mysterious First Brother!Faced with the curious gazes of the crowd, Li Ran was very calm. He casually found a seat to sit down on.Hiding behind the pig\u2019s head mask, he was unbridled as he sized everyone up.This time, the participants of the so-called \u201cDemon Slaying Conference\u201d were young disciples from various sects. The one with the highest cultivation was only at the Golden Core Realm. That was Chen Zhutian, who sat at the top.Coincidentally, Li Ran knew him.Back in Yunxiao Village, he wanted to forcefully break into the house, but he was scared witless by Li Ran\u2019s two divine abilities.However, right now, he was sitting upright and dignified, possessing the bearing of someone from a distinguished sect.Quite a few people surrounded him, flattering him with smiles.He didn\u2019t seem to have the appearance of a demon-killing cultivator. He was here to make friends.Li Ran shook his head.Last time in the secret realm, he had seen the so-called Righteous Path.Clearly, their heart was darker than anyone else, yet they were still pretending to be aloof from the worldly matters. Truly hypocritical.Of course, there was no lack of righteous people in the Righteous Path.However, they were scarce.At this moment, a system notification sounded in his mind.\u3010Mission Issued.\u3011\u3010The Demon Slaying Conference is just a method for the Righteous path to gain fame. Please employ your own methods to take down their facade.\u3011\u3010The quality of the reward will depend on the degree of completion!\u3011Li Ran laughed.\u201cA mission was triggered? Looks like I didn\u2019t come here for nothing.\u201dThe system had always been very generous.Although there were not many missions, the rewards for each mission were all extremely generous.Therefore, he would not let this mission go.But right now, he wasn\u2019t in a hurry. He had to observe the situation first.\u201cThis brother\u2026\u201dAt this moment, the man sitting next to Li Ran said in embarrassment, \u201cI am Luo Yong from Qilin Mountain Villa. May I ask for your name?\u201dQilin Mountain Villa, a second-rate sect.This Luo Yong was quite famous and had a first-rate talent. He had already reached the mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm at the age of twenty.Li Ran nodded and said, \u201cI, Ji Er Bang Ying, reign from the Hard Country Gang. Greetings Brother Luo.\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s Brother Ji Er. I\u2019ve known you for a long time.\u201d Luo Yong cupped his fists.Cough cough!Li Ran cleared his throat. \u201cBrother Luo, you should call me by name. That would sound more friendly.\u201d\u201cAlright, Brother Bang Ying.\u201d Luo Yong laughed, \u201cBrother is quite special.\u201d\u201cBecause my father\u2019s surname is Ji, and my mother\u2019s surname is Er, they hope that I\u2019ll be able to benefit the world, and fulfill my fate. That\u2019s why I\u2019m called Ji Er Bang Ying.\u201c\u201cFulfilling your fate? Great meaning!\u201d Luo Yong sighed.Li Ran smiled.If Li Daoyuan heard this, he would probably faint from anger\u2026Luo Yong continued, \u201cBrother Bang Ying, please forgive me for being ignorant, your Hard Country Gang\u2026 How come I\u2019ve never heard of it?\u201dLi Ran said, \u201cBrother Luo, it\u2019s normal that you haven\u2019t heard of it. We\u2019re just a third-rate gang.\u201dLuo Yong said seriously, \u201cNo matter if it\u2019s a third-rate or first-rate, we\u2019re all on the Righteous Path. Our goal is to destroy the Devil Sects, so you don\u2019t have to be so modest.\u201dLi Ran smiled.This person was quite eloquent.He continued, \u201cEven though our gang isn\u2019t big, we\u2019re all people with lofty ambitions, especially our leader, Jia Tengying. One hand has an eagle claw, and one hand has reached perfection. His skill is known as the Golden Finger. Our leader can kill enemies in three seconds!\u201dLuo Yong praised, \u201cWhat a Golden Finger! It sounds very powerful!\u201dJust as the two of them were having a passionate conversation, another yell sounded from the door.\u201cThe Chief disciple of the Tianshu Institute, Lin Langyue has arrived!\u201dThe air was quiet for a moment before boiling up!\u201cShe actually came?!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s Lin Langyue?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s going to join the Demon Slaying Conference this time. This is big news!\u201d\u201cThe Tianshu Institute, Myriad Sword Pavilion\u2026 this is a huge scene!\u201dEveryone stood up and looked towards the door.A few female cultivators stood on both sides of the door. A white-robed Daoist nun slowly walked in.She was a young Daoist nun. Her white Daoist robe was unspeckled. Every walking gesture of hers was filled with a gentle touch to it as if she was about to ride the wind in the next second.She had a pair of calm eyes that was devoid of impurity, seemingly indifferent to everything.She was like a bright moon on the horizon.Li Ran raised his eyebrows. \u201cTianshu Institute? That was what the old man said\u2026 What a coincidence!\u201dLuo Yong was shocked. He said in a low voice, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that she would come as well!\u201d\u201cDoes Brother Luo know her?\u201d Li Ran said curiously.Luo Yong smiled bitterly. \u201cDon\u2019t make fun of me, Brother Bang Yi. Who doesn\u2019t know Lin Langyue\u2019s name? That is an existence that was able to crush Yue Jianli and ascend to the top of the Heavenly Genius Rankings!\u201d\u201cNumber one on the Heavenly Genius Rankings?\u201dLi Ran really didn\u2019t know.He rarely went down the mountain and was not interested in the so-called Heavenly Genius Rankings.Moreover, the Tianshu Institute stayed in the secular world, and their disciples rarely set foot in the mortal world. The world knew very little about them.Li Ran rubbed his chin, \u201cWho would have thought that the mysterious First Brother of the rankings is a woman?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t dare speak nonsense!\u201dLuo Yong hurriedly stopped him. \u201cIt\u2019s rumored that she has an innate physique. Her cultivation speed is no less than a Saint-grade talent. I heard that she\u2019s even stronger than Devil\u2019s Sheng Zi Li Ran!\u201d\u201cStronger than Li Ran? That is impossible!\u201d\u201cDo you know who Li Ran is? He is a genius born with a Daoist Mark, a reincarnation of a great emperor, and the number one genius in a thousand years! Furthermore, he is handsome, handsome, handsome, and handsome! A mere Wolf Fangyue is worthy of being compared to him? That\u2019s funny!\u201dLuo Yong was speechless. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBrother Bang Ying, her name is Lin Langyue, not Wolf Fangyue\u2026 Why do I feel like you worship that devil very much?\u201dCough cough!Li Ran blurted out, \u201cI was just casually mentioning\u2026\u201dAfter Lin Langyue had entered, the entire restaurant fell silent.Everyone\u2019s eyes were filled with admiration, but no one dared to come up to greet her.This was because she was too cold, coupled with her identity.Finally, Chen Zhutian stood up and walked over quickly. He said excitedly, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect Fairy Lin to come here. You have made this gathering shine! Come, please take a seat!\u201dLin Langyue nodded and answered, \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201dChen Zhutian was grinning like a chrysanthemum.Lin Langyue sat down at the head of the table, while the rest of the female cultivators silently stood behind her.\u201c Tch, her style is quite impressive.\u201d Li Ran hated this seemingly innocent fairy the most.If she was so detached from the world, why would she come to participate in such a grand meeting?She must be a fake fairy, a real socialite!He revealed a cold smile as he thought to himself, \u201cDidn\u2019t the old man ask me to beat up the disciple of Tianshu Institute? I don\u2019t know whether this big sister from the Heavenly Genius Rankings can bear my beating or not!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87: Demon Slaying Conference? The Sugar-Coated Assembly!Chen Zhutian\u2019s eyes lit up with joy.He was the one who led the Demon Slaying Conference and sent invitations to the various sects.Naturally, this included the Tianshu Institute.Initially, he didn\u2019t hold high hopes. He expected that, at most, inner sect disciples would only attend. He didn\u2019t expect that Lin Langyue would personally come!Then, the influence of the Demon Slaying Conference would definitely reach another level.\u201cLin Yanyue, since you\u2019ve arrived, then you should host the grand meeting.\u201d Chen Zhutian bowed.Lin Yanyue shook her head. \u201cFellow Daoist Chen, let me just listen.\u201dShe happened to pass by this place and brought her disciples to see the world. She didn\u2019t have any intention of overtaking them.\u201cAlright.\u201d Chen Zhutian nodded.Everyone had already taken their seats.Chen Zhutian stood on the high platform in the center and said, \u201cThank you all for raising your voices. I, Chen Zhutian, will start this Demon Slaying Conference.\u201d\u201cGood!\u201d\u201cSenior Brother Chen is too modest!\u201dWarm applause rang throughout the stage.After all, he was the Eldest Senior Brother of the Myriad Sword Pavilion. His status was prestigious in everyone\u2019s hearts.Chen Zhutian\u2019s eyes flashed with satisfaction as he continued, \u201cEveryone knows that during this period of time, the Devil Sect demons have become more and more rampant, and the friction between the Righteous Path and Devil Sects has intensified.\u201d\u201cThree months ago, Elder Sha Shengyu from the Death Prison wanted to prove his Dao of Slaughter, therefore, he massacred the entire Tiger Sun City and turned it into a ghost city!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s also Liu Xunhuan of the Joyous Unity Sect. In order to raise the cultivation of the Sheng Zi of the sect, they\u2019ve taken young girls from all over the place and sucked their vitality, causing resentment to fill their hearts!\u201d\u201cJust a month ago, Yin Corpse Dao poisoned the village\u2019s water source to refine the Corpse Puppet, turning all the villagers into monsters!\u201d\u201cSuch a monstrous crime is truly devoid of humanity, a violation of human morals!\u201dChen Zhutian\u2019s voice was mournful, his eyes filled with tears.The audience became emotional as well.As long as they had a bit of righteousness, they would not be able to accept this atrocity.Chen Zhutian calmed down for a moment and said in a clear voice, \u201cTherefore, it\u2019s imperative to clear the devil\u2019s path!\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t a matter of my Myriad Sword Pavilion, it\u2019s a matter of the Righteous Path! It is a battle between the righteous and the unrighteous, a battle between justice and evil!\u201d\u201cWith the help of this Demon Slaying Conference, we will do everything we can to return a bright future to the world!\u201d He was indeed a bit of a hero in his generosity.\u201cAlright, I am willing to be the vanguard!\u201d\u201cPurge the Devil Sects and straighten things out!\u201d\u201cFor the sake of the Righteous Path!\u201d\u2014Everyone was excited as if they had become the embodiment of justice.Of course, they didn\u2019t know if Chen Zhutian\u2019s \u2018statement\u2019 was true or not.Li Ran sat below the stage, his brows furrowed.Up until now, he felt that there was nothing wrong with the Demon Slaying Conference.The actions of those Devil Sects were indeed not tolerable by the world.If these people were willing to join forces to fight against the top Devil Sects, they would truly be considered righteous.\u201cBut why would the system call them hypocrites?\u201d Li Ran was confused.Chen Zhutian looked at the crowd with satisfaction and enjoyed the attention on him. He signaled his hand down.The crowd gradually quieted down.He continued, \u201cI\u2019ve heard that the Devil\u2019s Gate \u2018Red Blood Hall\u2019 is devoid of human nature, adulterous, plundering, and committing every crime! That\u2019s why I suggest that we start with the Red Blood Hall as the first step in our exorcism!\u201dLi Ran was stunned.Didn\u2019t they just say Death Prison and Yin Corpse Dao?Where did the Red Blood Hall appear from?\u201cBrother Luo, I\u2019ve never heard of this Red Blood Hall before?\u201d Li Ran asked.Luo Yong didn\u2019t reply. Instead, he asked, \u201cBrother Bang Ying, this is the first time you\u2019ve come to this gathering, right?\u201dLi Ran asked suspiciously, \u201cCould the Demon Slaying Conference have been held many times?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Luo Yong nodded. \u201cThe Demon Slaying Conference is held almost every year. Usually, it is initiated by the disciples of the top sects. This year, it\u2019s the Myriad Sword Pavilion\u2019s turn.\u201d\u201cEvery year?\u201d Li Ran asked, \u201cThen why are the Devil Sects still so rampant?\u201d\u201cWho told you that we are going against the Devil Sect?\u201dLuo Yong looked left and right and said in a low voice, \u201cThe so-called exorcism convention is actually just a formality. It\u2019s just a show of face for the disciples under it. They\u2019re not exterminating any devil sects.\u201d\u201cIn last year\u2019s Demon Slaying Conference, a group of bandits was exterminated, but they declared to the public that they were Kui Xing Sect, second-rate devil sect.\u201d\u201cLast year, they killed a few flower collectors. To the public\u2019s eyes, they are the northwestern branch of the He Huan Sect\u201d\u201cThis \u2018Red Blood Hall\u2019 is actually a group of bandits outside Qingzhou Province. After a while, we\u2019ll go over and slaughter them. Then we\u2019ll be able to return to our respective sects.\u201d\u201cIn any case, ordinary people won\u2019t know that these bandits are not from a Devil Sect\u2026\u201dLi Ran was dumbfounded. \u201c\u2026.\u201dSo it was like this?\u201cThis isn\u2019t the Demon Slaying Conference, but a sugar-coated conference for the righteous sect?\u201d Li Ran smiled.\u201c Sigh, that\u2019s a good word. It\u2019s sugar-coated.\u201d\u201cDid you see those storytellers beside you? They were all arranged beforehand. When the grand assembly ends, the Myriad Sword Pavilion\u2019s Chen Zhutian\u2019s name would resound throughout the streets and alleys, becoming the hero in the hearts of everyone.\u201dLi Ran didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.It turned out that Chen Zhutian had shouted the slogan generously for a long time to provide materials for the storyteller.After all, the lowest cultivation here was at the late-stage of Qi Condensation, and the highest was at the Golden Core Realm. They were here to deal with just a few bandits?\u201cWhat a joke.\u201d Li Ran shook his head.Luo Yong patted him on the shoulder, \u201cThis is the first time you\u2019ve come here. I\u2019m used to it\u2026\u201dAt this time, Chen Zhutian asked, \u201cWhat do you all think of my proposal?\u201d\u201cMisty Cloud Sect\u2019s second the opinion,\u201d Fairy Lin gave a soft reply.\u201cThe Heavenly Handle Sect agrees.\u201d\u201cOur sect\u2019s the same!\u201d\u2014He looked at Lin Langyue. \u201cWhat about Fairy Lin?\u201dLin Langyue said indifferently, \u201cI\u2019m fine with it.\u201d\u201cGood! Since no one has any objections\u2026\u201dBefore he finished speaking, a languid voice sounded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have an objection.\u201dEveryone turned around and saw a young man with a pig\u2019s head mask with his legs crossed, Luo Yong beside him sweating profusely.Chen Zhutian frowned, \u201cSir is\u2026\u201dThe pig youth said, \u201cI\u2019m the first disciple of the Hard Country Gang. My name is Ji Er Bang Ying.\u201dChen Zhutian felt that he had heard this voice before and asked, \u201cThis Ji\u2026 Brother Ji, do you have any objections?\u201dThe pig-headed youth said, \u201cIt\u2019s right to exorcise the devils, but I think the target should be changed.\u201dChen Zhutian was taken aback. \u201cChange target? To whom?\u201dThe Pighead boy cleared his throat. \u201cWhat do you think of the Death Prison?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88: You\u2019re Surrounded!The restaurant became completely silent.Everyone looked at Li Ran as if they were looking at a retard.To deal with the Death Prison?That would be a mistake!The Death Prison cultivators cultivated the Dao of Slaughter. The more people they killed, the more stable their Dao hearts would be.There were ten people in the sect, nine of them were murderers, and the other one was a pervert.Even after combining the other Devil Sects, they probably wouldn\u2019t have killed as many people as the cultivators from the Death Prison!Not to mention that it was a top-level sect with an emperor rank guard. They wouldn\u2019t be able to even go there.Li Ran said excitedly, \u201cThe words of Senior Brother Chen woke up the deep sense of justice in my heart!\u201d\u201cDeath Prison is too savage. They even destroyed an entire city. It is an act that the heavens wouldn\u2019t tolerate. Let\u2019s go and fight them to the death!\u201dInwardly, Chen Zhutian was shaking. \u201cI really want to go all out with you\u2026\u201dHe shook his head and said sincerely, \u201cI can understand Brother Ji\u2019s feelings, but I still have to recognize my own strength. With our abilities, we\u2019re not strong enough to compete with the top Devil Sects.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cSenior Chen is right.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t give you a head for nothing.\u201dThe people below agreed.Li Ranz said, \u201cIf we can\u2019t defeat the sect leader, we can surround and attack the elders. If we can\u2019t kill the elders, we can kill their disciples\u2026 In short, for the sake of those who died unjustly, we must teach them a lesson!\u201dChen Zhutian felt bitter.This guy seemed to be serious\u2026Li Ran walked up onto the stage and patted him on the shoulder. He comforted, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we have the first-ranked sister on the Chosen List, the Wolf Mace, and our strength has grown considerably. We will definitely give the Devil Sects a head-on blow!\u201dLuo Yong covered his face. \u201cHer name is Lin Langyue\u2026\u201dJust as Chen Zhutian was in a dilemma, Lin Langyue said, \u201cThis Ji\u2026\u201d\u201cJi Er Bang Ying,\u201d Li Ran complimented himself. \u201cYou can also call me by my nickname, \u2018Ge Ge Awesome\u2019.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll call you Brother Ji,\u201dLin Langyue said, \u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re passionate about justice. It\u2019s not impossible, but I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll do something bad out of kindness.\u201d\u201cWhy did you say that?\u201d Li Ran asked.Lin Langyue said indifferently, \u201cIf we can\u2019t beat the demon from the Death Prison with one stick, we\u2019ll face recuperations. At that time, the innocent people will suffer.\u201dThese words were justified and there was no way to refute them.Li Ran thought for a moment and nodded, \u201cThat makes sense. Although my stick is very powerful, it really isn\u2019t realistic to think that I can kill them with a single stick hit.\u201dChen Zhutian heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cIt\u2019s still Fairy Lin who is far-sighted and thoughtful. If that\u2019s the case, then we will\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s deal with the Joyous Unity Sect instead,\u201d Li Ran answered.\u201cAh??\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you feel angry that they sucked the young girls\u2019 vitality dry?\u201dChen Zhutian said awkwardly, \u201cThe Death Prison and Joyous Unity Sect are similar in danger.\u201dLi Ran tilted his head and asked, \u201cWhat about the Yin Corpse Dao?\u201d\u201cSame reason\u2026\u201dLi Ran couldn\u2019t help but sneer. \u201cSo you\u2019ve been so generous with your words for half a day, yet you don\u2019t dare to deal with anyone except the bandits? What a worthy name of \u2018Demon Slaying Conference\u2019? It\u2019s clearly a group of shameless people.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cWhat courage!\u201d\u201cWhich sect are you from?\u201d\u201cHard Country Gang? It is definitely an unscrupulous gang!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t dare to show off your true face, and you think we\u2019re not a good person!\u201dEveryone was hit where it hurt, and they all jerked and cursed.Chen Zhutian\u2019s expression also turned cold, \u201cAre you here to ridicule us?\u201dLi Ran spread his hands and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve misunderstood. I just want to contribute to the Righteous Path.\u201dChen Zhutian snorted, \u201cThen don\u2019t make such unreliable suggestions!\u201dLi Ran knocked on the pig\u2019s mouth, \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll bring up a reliable one.\u201dChen Zhutian couldn\u2019t bear it any longer. \u201cI\u2019ll give you another chance. If you still can\u2019t pass, we\u2019ll follow the original plan!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll definitely do it this time.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go slaughter Li Ran,\u201d Li Ran said seriously.???Looking at the crowd\u2019s question marks, he began to seriously analyze them.\u201cFirst of all, Li Ran is a super genius. If he grows up, he will definitely become a great enemy of the Righteous Path.\u201cSecondly, Youluo Temple is not a bloodthirsty sect. Even if we kill their Sheng Zi, we don\u2019t need to worry about the commoners suffering.\u201d\u201cIn the end, that fellow really is too handsome. Even the female cultivators\u2019 dao hearts could go unstable if they were to get a glimpse of him. He is an extremely dangerous existence that must be eliminated.\u201d Li Ran looked around. \u201cEveryone, what do you think of my suggestion?\u201dEveryone looked at each other, their throats a little dry.Kill Li Ran?He was the Sheng Zi of a devil sect. How could he be so easy to deal with?Furthermore, Leng Wuyan was extremely protective. If something happened to Li Ran, none of them would be able to escape!However, this pig head youth\u2019s suggestion didn\u2019t provide them with any reason to refuse\u2026Li Ran looked at Lin Langyue and asked, \u201cWhat do you think of this, Fairy Lin?\u201dLin Langyue didn\u2019t refuse. She nodded and said, \u201cIf that\u2019s true\u2026 sure.\u201dUnder the pig\u2019s head mask, Li Ran smiled sinisterly. \u201cVery good, then it seems that my proposal has been approved?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dChen Zhutian said hesitantly, \u201cLi Ran rarely shows himself. His whereabouts are difficult to capture. Where are we going to find him?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t attack the Youluo Temple!\u201d\u201cKilling him is an easy matter, but what if you can\u2019t find him!\u201dThe crowd finally found an excuse and began to refuse.Li Ran shook his head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that troublesome. There\u2019s no need to look for him\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d Everyone was stunned.He took off his pig head mask and said with a beaming smile, \u201cBecause I\u2019ve already delivered him to your door.\u201dThe interior of the restaurant instantly quieted down so much that the sound of a needle falling could be heard.Everyone stared at him blankly, their jaws almost falling to the ground.\u201cLi, Li Li Ran?!\u201d\u201cWhy would he appear in the Demon Slaying Conference?!\u201dLuo Yong\u2019s legs went limp as he collapsed to the ground.The pig head masked man who he had been chatting with earlier was Li Ran?!Cold sweat dripped down Chen Zhutian\u2019s body as he flew away from the platform.Li Ran\u2019s devilish reputation wasn\u2019t a joke. He was a genius amongst all geniuses!This guy was fishing for law enforcement!Everyone felt as if they were facing a great enemy. There were even people who had already fled to the entrance, ready to flee.Li Ran opened his arms and a shadow spread out from behind him, enveloping the entire restaurant.Spots of light floated in the air.\u201cShadow Prison!\u201dEveryone\u2019s feet sank to the ground. The hard ground seemed to have turned into a swamp!There was a huge suction force, even walking was very difficult!Li Ran\u2019s voice echoed in the air. \u201cDon\u2019t move, you\u2019re surrounded.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89: Pretending to Be Hit by Lightning!Qingzhou City.City Lord\u2019s Mansion.Xiang Ze sat on a rocking chair and leisurely sipped his tea.Next to him was a young man dressed in official clothes. \u201cCity Lord, the city is now mixed with good and bad people. Do you want to send some more brothers out to patrol?\u201dXiang Ze shook his head. \u201cNo need. Those people outside are cultivators. No matter how many people you send, it\u2019s useless.\u201dThe first thing he did after he found out about the Demon Slaying Conference was to withdraw all the soldiers.In the face of cultivators, ordinary people did not pose any threat to them.Furthermore, with him in charge of the situation, ordinary sect disciples would not dare to act recklessly.The young man was a little worried, \u201cBut I\u2019m still worried that it will cause chaos. I\u2019ll go down and take a look myself \u201dThe young man was the Vice City Lord and a Foundation Establishment cultivator; his strength was considered quite strong.Xiang Ze put down his teacup and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need. Those people call themselves the Righteous Path. What they care about the most is face. There won\u2019t be any trouble\u2026 Furthermore, a great figure has arrived today.\u201d\u201cA great figure? Who is it?\u201d The young man curiously asked.There weren\u2019t many people who could be called great figures by Xiang Ze.Xiang Ze smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s the head of the Tianshu Institute, Lin Langyue. Powerful enough?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d The young man exclaimed, \u201cShe came as well?!\u201dThat was a genius with an innate dao body, number one on the Heavenly Genius Rankings, known as the Fairy of the Righteous path!Xiang Ze nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s right. With her around, I don\u2019t believe that anyone dares to cause trouble\u2026\u201dBoom!As soon as he finished speaking, a loud sound rang out.The two of them suddenly raised their heads and looked out of the window. They saw that the three-story restaurant had collapsed.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe young man gulped. \u201cCity Lord, someone is causing trouble.\u201dXiang Ze mumbled, \u201cI can see that\u2026\u201dBoom boom boom!Li Ran\u2019s qi spread out, and the Shadow Prison entrapped everyone.These people were mostly Qi Refinement and Foundation Establishment cultivators, so they were unable to break free from their restraints. They could only foolishly stand there.Li Ran raised his fists, and like disciplining a child, he beat them one by one to tears.\u201cDon\u2019t slap my face!\u201d\u201cI was wrong, wu wu wu!\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t come to the gathering again\u2026\u201d\u201cStop fighting! Stop fighting!\u201dThis group of dog-like Righteous Path disciples was beaten to the point of tears. There were even people crying and begging for mercy.The scene was extremely miserable.Li Ran planned to teach them a good lesson.Although the Devil Sect was devoid of humanity, it was not a good thing for them to take advantage of other people\u2019s calamity to gain fame and reputation.\u201cIf the system wants to expose their true faces, I\u2019ll slap their faces askew. That should have completed the mission, yes?\u201dBang!Li Ran kicked a strong man away.At this moment, Chen Zhutian broke free from the Shadow Prison\u2019s restraints, he unsheathed his sword.Just when Li Ran thought that he was about to make a move, Chen Zhutian actually turned around and ran!\u201cRun?\u201cThe bricks under Li Ran\u2019s feet exploded as he appeared above Chen Zhutian\u2019s head. Li Ran then slapped him down.Chen Zhutian fell to the ground, grimacing in pain.He looked at Li Ran, who was slowly approaching him; his eyes were filled with terror. \u201cWe have no grudges with each other. Why did you attack me?\u201dLi Ran grinned, showing his snow-white teeth. \u201cI am from a Devil Sect. Do I still need a reason to hit you?\u201dChen Zhutian\u2019s scalp went numb. \u201cI-I\u2019m a disciple of the Myriad Sword Pavilion. You cannot touch me!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d Li Ran swung his fist and beat him up.If he remembered correctly, this guy seemed to be interested in Yue Jianli?Thinking of this, Li Ran could not help but become even more ruthless.One slap at the left and one at the right, turning Chen Zhutian into a pig head\u2026\u201cEnough.\u201d A calm voice rang out behind him.Li Ran turned around and saw Lin Langyue looking at him indifferently.\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, but let\u2019s stop here.\u201d Her voice was indistinct as if it came from the Nine Heavens.Li Ran smiled disdainfully. \u201cIsn\u2019t that too hypocritical? You only stood out after the fight was done?\u201dHis Shadow Prison was too large and could only trap Qi Cultivation and Foundation Establishment, so it wasn\u2019t affecting the Golden Core Realm cultivators.If Chen Zhutian could escape, how could he possibly trap Lin Langyue?Lin Langyue said with a calm expression, \u201cBefore I save someone else, I have to guarantee my sect\u2019s disciples\u2019 safety first.\u201dThere was no one behind her.It turned out that she had already sent off the disciples of the Tianshu Institute.\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d Li Ran nodded.He looked at Lin Langyue and said, \u201cDid you know that I\u2019m really happy to hear that you\u2019re here?\u201dThis made her frown slightly. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201dLi Ran said, \u201cBecause of this, I can fulfill my promise to someone.\u201d\u201cWhat promise?\u201d Lin Langyue was confused.Li Ran moved his muscles and bones and gave a crisp cracking sound. His smile was brilliant.\u201cI\u2019ll beat you up.\u201dHe had just finished speaking. He appeared behind Lin Langyue like a ghost, his fist howling with the wind as he smashed his fist towards her!At the same time, he activated the spiritual pressure seal, making it impossible for her to move!Seeing that his fist was about to land on her face, her entire body disappeared like a bubble.His fist smashed through the air.Li Ran suddenly turned around, only to see her floating in the air. Her white clothes fluttering over the bright moon.\u201cAt the same level, no matter what divine ability you have, you won\u2019t be able to reach me.\u201dLin Langyue said indifferently, \u201cThis is the secret technique of the Tianshu Institute.\u201dAlthough her tone was calm, it was filled with extreme confidence.\u201cReally?\u201d Li Ran took a step forward. The sky suddenly darkened and a huge dark cloud gathered in the sky.Lin Langyue frowned.\u201cYour \u2018extraordinary\u2019 appearance is truly annoying.\u201d Following Li Ran\u2019s words, the aura of the Ancient Emperor surged out, causing one\u2019s heart to tremble.Lin Langyue landed on the ground under the immense pressure of heaven and earth. She felt that it would be very difficult for her to move.\u201cWhat dao technique are you using?\u201d She frowned.The corners of Li Ran\u2019s mouth twitched, and his smile became cold. \u201cThis move of mine is called the Golden Lightning Curse!\u201dBlack clouds gathered above the city.Lightning condensed in the dark clouds as a huge bolt of lightning rumbled.Heaven and earth suppresses the enemy, Nine Heavens Divine Lightning!*[TL/N: Incantation]\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Ripples appeared in Lin Langyue\u2019s pale eyes!Boom!Lightning flashed and everything was annihilated!\u2014On the other side, Xiang Ze and the Vice City Lord were aggressively rushing over.\u201cF*ck, who dares to behave so atrociously in my Qingzhou City?\u201d Xiang Ze angrily gritted his teeth.The Vice City Lord rolled up his arms. \u201cKill him!\u201dBoom!The two of them stopped in their tracks.Seeing the terrifying lightning in front of them, their throats tightened.\u201cThis is\u2026 heavenly tribulation?\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be that someone is going through tribulation here, right?!\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90: A Fight Between Gods!Li Ran hated two kinds of people the most.The first type was those who were more handsome than him.Of course, he hadn\u2019t seen this type of person up until now, and whether such a person would exist.The second type was a hypocrite.There were many people like this.Song Qingsong, Chen Zhutian, and those who had come to participate in the Demon Slaying Conference were all clear examples of this.Their hearts were clearly darker than anyone else, yet they assumed a dignified appearance. They expressed pride in being members of the Righteous Path, yet they are constantly looking for opportunities to eat up their kind.They were wearing the coat of justice and doing the dirty work of a dog.Especially Lin Langyue.She looked like she was aloof from worldly affairs, but she was extremely utilitarian. Otherwise, how could she have come to participate in this bullsh*t convention?Was it not for fame?In Li Ran\u2019s opinion, such a person was simply extremely hypocritical.It just so happened that he and Li Wuqiang had an agreement, and Lin Langyue was a personal disciple of the Tianshu Institute. Li Ran felt that beating her up was very reasonable.\u201cGood. Let\u2019s see how strong our first-ranked sister is!\u201dBoom boom boom!The heavenly lightning brought with it the aura of the wasteland, continuously smashing into the ground.Thunderbolts shot in all directions, causing the Righteous Path disciples to cry out for their parents.Especially Chen Zhutian, who was the closest to him. His eyes turned white as white foam oozed out from his mouth, his body shaking like a sieve.He was no longer conscious.Just the scattered might alone was already so terrifying. One could imagine the pressure at the center of the lightning.Li Ran rubbed his chin. \u201cStill not moving? Don\u2019t tell me she died from the lightning\u2026\u201dAfter the time for an incense stick to burn\u2026The lightning stopped and the dark clouds dispersed.The sunlight shined down\u2026Li Ran looked at the figure in front of him and smiled. \u201cInteresting.\u201dLin Langyue was still standing on the ground.She opened her mouth and muttered something to herself, and her body glowed with a sphere of light.Her shield was covered with spiderweb-like cracks. The moment the lightning dissipated, it shattered with a bang.Li Ran clapped. \u201cNot bad, not bad. You are indeed worthy of being the first-ranked Sister of the Heavenly Genius Rankings. I didn\u2019t expect you to take my move head-on.\u201dTo avoid hurting others, he weakened the power and range of the Golden Lightning Curse.Compared to using his full strength, he only used about fifty percent of his power.Even so, it was not something that an ordinary Golden Core cultivator could handle.Regardless of Lin Langyue\u2019s character, she was indeed quite strong.Lin Langyue\u2019s face was pale, and her aura surged. She almost coughed up a mouthful of blood.However, she tightly clenched her fists and forcefully endured the pain.Li Ran was too strong.The resonance between heaven and earth, heavenly lightning descending upon the ground.This was simply not the strength of a Golden Core Realm cultivator!If the lightning barrage were to continue for five more breaths, she would no longer be able to hold on!Lin Langyue\u2019s eyes became grave.This was the strongest enemy she had ever encountered. She absolutely could not show any signs of weakness.\u201cSuch a divine ability would use up a great deal of qi. He must be very weak right now. I still have a chance!\u201dEven against such a powerful enemy, she never thought of running away.This was the pride of the disciples of the Tianshu Institute.\u201cMy heart is as clear as ice\u2026\u201dBy the time Lin Langyue closed her eyes and opened them again, her gaze turned emotionless and calm.Her figure soared into the sky. With her white palm facing Li Ran, a dazzling glow appeared in her palm.Rumble!White light burst forth!Like a meteor shower, the ground was filled with holes. However, Li Ran had already disappeared.\u201cNot good!\u201dLin Langyue suddenly turned around and saw a streak of light approaching from behind her.Li Ran\u2019s fist came along the wind with his cold smile.Boom boom boom!The two of them transformed into lightning and clashed in midair. Daoist techniques collided, and rumbling sounds could be heard!Every once in a while, even the slightest ripple of their qi was devastating!The Righteous Path disciples hid in the corner, hugging their heads and trembling.Weak and helpless.This was simply a fight between gods!They couldn\u2019t do anything but pray for Lin Langyue\u2026\u2014Outside the ruins.Xiang Ze and the Vice City Lord watched this scene unfold.The Vice City Lord said bitterly, \u201cCity Lord, will you not stop them\u2026\u201dXiang Ze glanced at him. \u201cYou think this old man is not approaching death fast enough? Or do you want to take over my position?\u201dThe Vice City Lord was silent. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXiang Ze shook his head. \u201cOne is the head of Tianshu Institute, and the other is the Sheng Zi of Youluo Temple. Who the f*ck dares to interfere? As long as they don\u2019t kill me, even if they tear down Qingzhou City, I\u2019ll still praise them for it!\u201dSigh.The Vice City Lord sighed and said helplessly, \u201cThe Demon Slaying Conference was just a formality. Why did it attract these two great gods?\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201d Xiang Ze said with a teasing expression, \u201cGetting ruined by a single person. Who exactly is getting rid of who?\u201d\u2014Bang!The two figures split up.Li Ran grinned, \u201cThat\u2019s right, so you\u2019re already at the Perfect Golden Core stage!\u201dLin Langyue was silent.The delicate hand behind her back trembled slightly.\u201cIs this person\u2019s qi infinite?\u201dFor the first time, a faint sense of powerlessness appeared in her heart.\u201cI announce that the warm-up is officially over.\u201dLi Ran moved his neck and put on his gloves.The gloves were made of the Golden Ridge Sand, flickering with a faint golden light. At the joint of the fist, there were ten small stones embedded.This was something he had someone refine in Wuyang City.The glove was very ordinary. Other than being sturdy, it was useless. It could not even be considered an Earthly Treasure.The crux of the matter was that he had secretly taken down the ten stones from the secret gate\u2026Demon Suppressing Stone!Li Ran took a step forward and his body instantly expanded. His entire body was surrounded by blood energy, and his eyes slowly turned dark red.Bloodline power activated!Seeing his bloodthirsty smile, Lin Langyue\u2019s heart was alarmed.At the moment he activated his spell, a blood-red light appeared in front of him!As for the Daoist technique that was as solid as a rock, it shattered like a bubble the moment the fist touched it!\u201cWhat is this?!\u201d Lin Langyue exclaimed.She drew her body and dodged. As soon as she rose into the air, her gaze was covered by a large hand!Li Ran grabbed her head with his right hand and smashed it onto the ground. His eyes were cold and bloodthirsty!Lin Langyue quickly crushed a jade pendant, and a divine light appeared on her body. Then, she was smashed into the ground with a \u201cbang \u201c!Bricks and stones exploded and the earth collapsed!The dust slowly dispersed.A huge pit appeared on the ground.Lin Langyue laid in the pit, surrounded by deep divine light, like a transparent eggshell.As the successor of the Tianshu Institute, the most important thing was life-saving treasures. This barrier was not affected by the Demon Suppressing Stone. Clearly, it was of high quality!\u201c Tch, there are too many tortoise shells.\u201d Li Ran took off his gloves and coldly looked at Lin Langyue.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91: Women are Accustomed to Pain!Although the Demon Suppressing Stone was powerful and had the effect of breaking through techniques and suppressing demons, it could only be used against dao techniques from those below the Heavenly Tribulation Realm.Obviously, the divine light protecting Lin Langyue was no ordinary treasure.Additionally, he was worried about Old Li\u2019s wrath. The stones on Li Ran\u2019s gloves were too small. If he were to use it against normal techniques, it would be all right, but the stone would break if used against stronger dao techniques.Therefore, he simply put away the gloves to avoid damaging them.\u201cThere\u2019s no enmity between us. Why are we fighting each other?\u201d Lin Langyue said.She was indeed very pretty.At this moment, she was lying in the pit with her hair in a disorderly bun, her lips looked like fragments of jade, and her pretty face was as flawless as jade.Unlike the appearance of an Immortal Realm Fairy, she didn\u2019t have that icy cold feeling of desolation anymore. Now her beauty was more than capable of arousing people\u2019s hidden desires.Li Ran said indifferently, \u201cI have a promise with an old man that I will beat up a disciple of the head of Tianshu Institute.\u201d\u201cAn old man?\u201d Lin Langyue frowned.The Tianshu Institute never fought nor stole from anyone, isolating themselves from the mortal world, she never heard that their school had grudges with anyone before?\u201cThere\u2019s one more thing\u2026\u201dLi Ran said with a cold smile, \u201cI hate you, a whore who wanted to make yourself seem like a high-up fairy. Are you a moon hanging from the sky? If so, I will beat you down with my own hands!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d A trace of anger flashed through Lin Langyue\u2019s eyes.This devil said that she was a\u2026 She had never suffered such humiliation before!Li Ran\u2019s eyes were as red as blood. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d Lin Langyue was taken aback.His muscles tensed up as qi erupted from his entire body. Covered by a layer of thin flame, he smashed down like a comet.Boom!The protective barrier sparkled with divine light as it blocked the fist\u2019s impact. The ground beneath her exploded.Lin Langyue shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t waste your energy. This is a supreme treasure, the Wind Spirit Jade. It can block a full-strength blow from a late-Nascent Soul cultivator. You cannot destroy it.\u201dLi Ran\u2019s smile became grim. \u201cSo noisy.\u201dThen, another punch came.Boom boom boom boom!His entire body was suffused with blood energy as if he was a tireless humanoid beast.His two fists rained down on the barrier, each one faster than the previous, with might that multiplied each time!The ground shook violently, and as if there was a stampede here, the entire ruins trembled.The light on the barrier grew dimmer.In the beginning, the shield could still withstand the power, but with his torrential attacks, it began to show cracks.Lin Langyue opened her mouth, her eyes filled with fear.This was the Wind Spirit Jade, yet it was going to be broken by a Golden Core Realm\u2019s physical strength?Even the power of the backlash was supposed to kill him!Crack.A crisp sound seemed to ring in her heart.Lin Langyue\u2019s face was pale as an unprecedented fear enveloped her, making it difficult for her to breathe.Her heart seemed to be clenched together as she looked at the pair of ruthless eyes through the protective light.A thought suddenly came to her mind, \u201cSo I am also afraid of death.\u201dShe watched as the man smashed down one punch after another.Every time the light barrier trembled, her heart curled up even more.It wasn\u2019t that Lin Langyue hadn\u2019t killed anyone before.However, her enemies were all crushed, never has she faced a direct confrontation like this that could be comparable to a life and death struggle between beasts.\u201cHis technique is strong, and his physical body is powerful. How could there be such a monster? I\u2026 am no match for him\u2026\u201dHer firm dao heart wavered for the first time.Bang!Li Ran\u2019s fist smashed into the gap.Like a broken eggshell, the light barrier was covered in numerous cracks.Then, with a light crack, it turned into a speck of light and dissipated.The Wind Spirit Jade that could block a Nascent Soul practitioner\u2019s attack was broken.Lin Langyue was completely exposed.Her face was pale, her eyes filled with fear. She lay on the ground like a delicate lily.Li Ran smiled sinisterly. \u201cThe bright moon in the sky, right? See how I can break you apart!\u201dWithout any hesitation, his fists smashed down!When the Righteous Path disciples saw this, their scalps went numb.That was Lin Langyue!Innate dao body, the chief disciple of Tianshu Institute, the number one genius of the Righteous Path!How could she get hammered by Li Ran to the ground?After today, the news would definitely spread throughout the vast lands.Li Ran\u2019s reputation would become the nightmare of all chosen ones!\u201cWho the fuck can contend with such a devil?\u201d Everyone felt powerless.Luo Yong\u2019s legs trembled and his pants were wet.The Brother Bang Ying who had called him brother was the Sheng Zi of Youluo Temple!\u201cHard Country Gang? It\u2019s a good thing that I didn\u2019t say anything too excessive. Otherwise, I would\u2019ve already become a corpse!\u201d\u2014Outside the ruins\u2026\u201cCity Lord, are you still not going to take action? Soon, someone would die!\u201dXiang Ze gulped, \u201cThat\u2019s easy to say. I\u2019m too f*cking afraid of getting beaten up!\u201cThe Vice City Lord fell silent. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEven so, Xiang Ze couldn\u2019t sit idly.If Lin Langyue were to die here, Qingzhou City would suffer the wrath of the Tianshu Institute.That would be a catastrophe!Xiang Ze took a deep breath, braced himself, and rushed in, shouting, \u201cSheng Zi of the devil sect, keep your hand!\u201d\u201cScram!\u201dBefore he could finish, he was kicked away.Xiang Ze struggled to his feet and sighed. \u201cWhat a f*cking demon!\u201dHe soared into the air, his clothes fluttering in the wind. A blue mark lit up between his brows.An invisible gale condensed in his hand, forming an enormous storm hand.It was wrapped with a layer of swirling air currents, emitting terrifying air currents mid-air.\u201cStop it!\u201d Xiang Ze roared furiously as his storm hand slammed down!The Earth and mountains shook!Bang!A figure broke through the storm and instantly appeared in front of him. His dark red eyes looked at him with indifference.It was like a beast from the primordial era, without the slightest hint of human emotion.Xiang Ze\u2019s chrysanthemum tightened. With an embarrassed smile, he said, \u201cPlease calm down, my lord.\u201dSeeing that Li Ran\u2019s white eyes were about to be completely infected by the dark red, Li Ran exhaled a mouthful of turbid air, and the blood energy in his entire body returned.His eyes had completely recovered their clarity.\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d Li Ran frowned.Xiang Ze nodded and bowed. \u201cI, Little Xiang, am the City Lord of Qingzhou City. Greetings, Lord Sheng Zi.\u201d\u201cJust now, you were the one who slapped me?\u201d\u201cHow could that be! That\u2019s because you\u2019re too hot. I\u2019m just giving you a fan to cool you down!\u201d\u201c???\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s Lin Langyue?\u201dLi Ran turned around and saw that the other party had already disappeared.At this moment, her ethereal voice came from afar, \u201cLi Ran, I will remember today\u2019s humiliation. I repay this humiliation to you ten-fold in the future!\u201d\u201cHow dare you speak so harshly? Looks like I didn\u2019t beat you enough!\u201d Li Ran\u2019s eyebrows stood up and he rolled up his sleeves to catch up.\u201cHey, Sheng Zi, stop!\u201d Xiang Ze hurriedly stopped him and advised, \u201cYou\u2019ve already won. This is something everyone can see. Why bother bickering with her? Besides, Lin Langyue is a woman. You\u2019re a grown man bullying a weak woman. It wouldn\u2019t be nice if people were to hear about this!\u201dLi Ran glanced at him and raised his fist. \u201cWhat do you know? Women are accustomed to pain!\u201dXiang Ze was speechless. \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92: Lin Langyue\u2019s Nemesis!Looking at the mess on the ground, the broken walls, and the screams of the Righteous Path disciples\u2026Xiang Ze had a huge headache.Li Ran was satisfied, but how should this matter be resolved?Most of these young disciples who had been beaten were from first-rate and second-rate sects, and they were also core disciples.If it was one or two, it would be fine, but there were dozens of people here.Even the Eldest Brother of the Myriad Sword Pavilion got beaten back.Chen Zhutian looked as if he was electrocuted, and was still lying on the ground.Li Ran then patted his butt and returned to his sect, who would clean up the mess?This group of Righteous Path disciples didn\u2019t dare to deal with the Youlou Temple. They would definitely vent their anger on him.Xiang Ze thought for a moment and said to the Vice City Lord, \u201cI miss home. Tomorrow, I\u2019m going home to help my mother wash her chopsticks and dishes. I\u2019ll leave the city affairs to you.\u201dThe Vice City Lord carefully replied, \u201cLord, aren\u2019t you an orphan? Where did you get your mother?\u201d\u201cEh\u2026 Actually, it\u2019s like this\u2026\u201d Xiang Ze patted him on the shoulder and praised, \u201cYou\u2019ve been with me for so long, kid. I\u2019ve always recognized your ability, so I\u2019ve decided to give you a raise!\u201dXiang Ze held his hand. \u201cCongratulations, from now on, you\u2019ll be the City Lord of Qingzhou City!\u201dThe Vice City Lord looked at him suspiciously. \u201cAre you sure that I will become the City Lord and not the scapegoat?\u201d\u201c Cough cough, young people must know when to seize the opportunity!\u201d\u201cThen I have my own life too!\u201dXiang Ze sighed helplessly when he saw that he could not be fooled.\u2014Actually, Li Ran still held back.Although the scene was tragic, no one lost their life.Li Ran wasn\u2019t a homicidal maniac. He merely wanted to teach these people a lesson and complete the mission.\u201cThat\u2026 Little Xiang ah.\u201d Li Ran spoke up at this moment.\u201cAh, I\u2019m here!\u201d Xiang Ze came up to him and rubbed his hands together. \u201cWhat do you need from me, Sheng Zi?\u201dLi Ran replied, \u201cCalculate the damages and put it on my tab.\u201dOne yard at a time.If the restaurant owner is a mortal, their family could end up in the streets from this damage.Xiang Ze\u2019s head shook like a rattle drum. \u201cLook at what you\u2019re saying, this restaurant is broken and rotten. I\u2019ve long wanted to rebuild it. I should be thanking Sheng Zi for his help!\u201dSaying this, his heart was dripping with blood.Ting Yue Xuan was the largest restaurant in Qingzhou City, and it was also his main source of income. He had just renovated it last month, but it was demolished today\u2026However, how could he dare to make the other party pay?Li Ran raised his eyebrows and said, \u201cSo it\u2019s your business. I won\u2019t be polite then.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re too polite.\u201d Xiang Ze scratched his head. \u201cThis lowly one wants to ask a few more questions. Did you come to Qingzhou City to participate in the Demon Slaying Conference?\u201d\u201cOf course not. Do you think I\u2019m bored to death?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m got tired of flying, and I happened to be passing by to find a good rest.\u201d Li Ran said.\u201cAnd then?\u201d\u201cAfter that, I met this group of b*stards holding a meeting and beat them up.\u201dXiang Ze wanted to cry but had no tears.Wasn\u2019t this too f*cking coincidental?At this moment, Li Ran asked, \u201cIs there any other restaurant in Qingzhou City?\u201dHe was going to take a bath and rest.After all, beating someone was a tough job!Xiang Ze said enthusiastically, \u201cWhich restaurant are you visiting? You can stay there as long as you want!\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Li Ran asked curiously, \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of me?\u201dAs the Sheng Zi of a devil sect, many people didn\u2019t even dare to mention his name. Although the City Lord was cautious, he didn\u2019t have much fear.Xiang Ze smiled and said, \u201cBecause I know that you are not someone who kills indiscriminately. Otherwise, these Righteous Path disciples would not be as simple as being injured.\u201dActually, he had another intention in mind.Since no one was taking the blame, then he should create a false impression that his relationship with Li Ran was good. This might even make the Righteous Path sects hesitate before taking action\u2026\u201cAlright.\u201dLi Ran didn\u2019t refuse as he followed him to the City Lord\u2019s Mansion.\u2014Among the ruins, only Luo Yong stood there dumbly.He was the only person here who wasn\u2019t beaten\u2026\u2014On the other side\u2026Lin Langyue transformed into a streak of divine light and disappeared, appearing hundreds of kilometers away!Facing Li Ran\u2019s fierce attack just now, she could only barely defend, not daring to relax at all.Otherwise, she might really die under that heavy punch!Only when Xiang Ze\u2019s palm had diverted Li Ran\u2019s attention did she have a chance to breathe.Without any hesitation, she chose to flee for her life.Using the damage to her cultivation as a price, she instantly fled several hundred kilometers, not even daring to return!She flew straight to a small hill and then landed at the peak.Pfft!Lin Langyue coughed up a mouthful of blood, her face as pale as paper, and her lips as white as wax.She weakly leaned against the tree trunk, her entire body almost falling apart.Li Ran\u2019s physical body was too powerful.Even after exerting all her qi to resist, coupled with the fact that her white robe was still a high-grade artifact, she was still unable to contend with the terrifying fist force.Right now, her internal organs had been severely damaged with several bleeding spots; she was seriously injured.Feeling the pain in her body, her face suddenly turned strange, and she blushed.After Li Ran had activated his bloodline power, his thoughts would be muddled and he would become extremely furious.He didn\u2019t focus on attacking spots. He would hit whether his target was something big\u2026 and her towering and round vital points naturally became the focus of attention.\u201cThis fellow\u2026\u201dLin Langyue gritted her teeth. \u201cDamn it!\u201dShe was originally from a prestigious family.Ever since she was young, she had revealed astonishing cultivation talent. After confirming that she had an Innate Daoist Body, she was accepted as a direct disciple by the Sect Master of the Tianshu Institute.She faced no obstacles from breaking through from Qi Refining to Golden Core Realm.Naturally, she became the sect leader-to-be and the publicly acknowledged number one genius of the Righteous Path.It could be said that in her twenty years of life, she had never experienced any setbacks until she met Li Ran, the devilish genius.Not only was Li Ran\u2019s technique divine, but he was also able to communicate with the heavens and earth to send down divine lightning. Moreover, his physical body was so strong that even the Wind Spirit Jade could not block his fist!All sorts of strange magical treasures and divine abilities caused Lin Langyue to be utterly crushed!She closed her eyes and could still see those scarlet eyes.The bright moon in the sky, right? See how I can break you apart! Li Ran\u2019s voice echoed in her ears.Pu\u2026Lin Langyue\u2019s throat turned sweet as she spat out another mouthful of blood.\u201cOh no, my dao heart is damaged\u2026\u201dShe took out a medicinal pill and stuffed it into her mouth. At the same time, she poured her remaining qi into a jade pendant.Her accompanying disciples would sense her location.Lin Langyue sat down powerlessly. Her pure white Daoist robe was covered in dirt, yet she didn\u2019t have the time to care.This time, her losses were huge.She had been heavily injured, her Dao Heart damaged, her cultivation dropped, and her treasures destroyed\u2026Most importantly, her pride was thrown to the ground and trampled on!Lin Langyue bit her lip. \u201cLi Ran, I am not done with you yet!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93: Li Ran, First-Ranked Heavenly Devil!As the conflict between the Righteous Path and Devil Dao grew more and more intense, the entire vast land was sent into turmoil.It was as if a huge vortex was brewing, and all the sects couldn\u2019t escape.Right at the center of the storm, a shocking event occurred.The fairy of the Righteous Path, the undefeated Lin Langyue, was defeated!And it was a crushing defeat!Under the eyes of dozens of Righteous Path disciples, she had been severely injured by the Devil Sect\u2019s Sheng Zi. In the end, she could only ignite her cultivation to escape!On the other hand, the other party was unharmed and was even able to handle her with ease.This simply shocked the world!After all, Lin Langyue was the number one genius on the Heavenly Genius Rankings and was publicly acknowledged as the strongest in the Righteous Path\u2019s younger generation.She was defeated just like that?Didn\u2019t that mean that the Righteous Path was weak and the Devil Path was about to rise?At this moment, the rumor that the Righteous Path was ruined became even more widespread.Their top genius had lost, so Li Ran had become an invincible existence.Right now, he was only a Golden Core cultivator, but given the time to grow, who would be his match?If Li Ran was allowed to take the throne, he would most likely turn against the geniuses on the Heavenly Genius Rankings. The end of the Righteous Path was not far away!Everyone from the Righteous Path was in danger. Li Ran\u2019s shadow enveloped the hearts of all the young disciples.The Devil Sects were the opposite.One after another, they felt that the spring of the Devil Path was coming.There were even people who created the \u201cHeavenly Devil Rankings\u201d to rank the young experts of the Devil Sects.As for Li Ran, he was the undisputed first-ranked Heavenly Devil!\u2014Wuyang Imperial Capital, middle territory\u2026The atmosphere was murderous.A tall figure sat on the dragon throne in the center of the hall.He wore a twelve-tasseled crown on his head, a black gold dragon robe, and a sword in his right hand.A terrifying aura was emitted from him.It was none other than the Emperor, Human Emperor Sheng Feng!He opened his eyes slightly and looked at the young girl wearing a bright yellow embroidered Flood Dragon brocade robe. \u201cWhat is the matter?\u201dA young girl knelt on one knee. \u201cImperial Father, do you know what happened in Qingzhou City?\u201d\u201cWe already know,\u201d Sheng Feng said indifferently.Li Ran, the Devil Sheng Zi, crushed dozens of people and even heavily injured Lin Langyue.An hour later, this matter had already reached Sheng Feng\u2019s ears.The girl asked, \u201cThis demon is really arrogant! Right now, everyone from the Righteous Path is in danger, and the Devil Path is restless. Does Imperial Father have any countermeasures?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHow should we deal with it?\u201d\u201cDo nothing.\u201d\u201cImperial Father?\u201d The girl looked up in confusion.\u201cWithout evil, justice would no longer exist.\u201d\u201cAs long as the battle between the Righteous Path and Devil Path doesn\u2019t end, this world will forever belong to the Sheng Clan! If the Devil Path were to perish\u2026.\u201dSheng Feng\u2019s voice was bone-piercing. \u201cThat Righteous Path will be our Sheng Clan\u2019s greatest enemy!\u201dThe young girl was stunned for a moment before suddenly coming to a realization.Only with three legs could he stand.*[TLN: By this, he meant that he could only stay neutral, not taking any side.]If the royal family chose to stand on either side, then it would not be far from extinction.\u201cBut\u2026\u201dThe girl bit her lips. \u201cThe vengeful spirits that died in Tiger Sun City are all citizens of our Sheng Clan!\u201dCould it be that for the sake of stabilizing the country, the Devil Path would be allowed to run rampant?Sheng Feng said, \u201cDeath Prison naturally has to pay the price for this. Ren Tuo has already perished.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dThe girl suddenly raised her head. \u201cThat demon who slaughtered the city is already dead?\u201dHe was a top-tier devil sect elder. How could he have died so silently?\u201cThe day before yesterday, he died on the spot where you stood.\u201dSheng Feng\u2019s tone was calm as his gaze passed through the windows of the main hall, overlooking the entire Central City.\u2014Western Region\u2026Mount Wu Shan, Concord Sect\u2026In an extremely luxurious room.The fragrance was emitting from an incense burner, and the scene was melodious.A graceful figure could be seen lying on the bed through the Rinsuo Treasure Tent that was embroidered with silver thread crabapple.This was an extremely delicate and pretty girl. Her eyes were filled with an astonishing amount of charm.Dressed in a black veil, her slim figure was faintly discernible. Upon closer inspection, however, one could not see the spring scenery.Looking at the letter in her hand, she let out a silver bell-like smile.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be here, Lin Langyue?\u201d\u201cA high and mighty fairy, the moon that hangs in the nine heavens, being crushed on the ground? Hahahaha\u2026\u201dShe was about to burst into tears from laughing. Her delicate body trembled, and it was simply horrifying.The girl smiled for a while before wiping her tears.\u201cLi Ran? Big sister really needs to thank you\u2026\u201dHer lips curled up like a little fox.\u2014Mount Xuanling, Demon Peak.The Sect Master\u2019s bedroom\u2026Leng Wuyan leaned on her chin and looked out the window, her fingers unconsciously tapping the table.\u201cWhy isn\u2019t Ran\u2019er back yet? How many days\u2026\u201d\u201cHmph! He\u2019s definitely in Wuyang City, spending time with his fianc\u00e9e, and he\u2019s already forgotten about me!\u201d\u201cThis evil disciple is clearly already engaged. Why did he come to seduce me?\u201d\u201cWhen he returns, I must ask him clearly!\u201d\u201cNo, no, no. I have to hang on to him first. Otherwise, I really think I\u2019ll just be letting him bully me\u2026 But how long should I wait?\u201cA month? It seems a bit long\u2026 How about\u2026 seven days?\u201dJust as she was talking to herself, a knock came from the door.She sat upright and cleared her throat. \u201cCome in.\u201dThe door didn\u2019t open, and the shadow squeezed in through the cracks of the door, turning into a human form and kneeling on one knee.\u201cSect Master, urgent information has come from the central region.\u201d\u201cUrgent information?\u201dLeng Wuyan frowned. \u201cBring it up.\u201dThe shadow guard handed a jade letter to Leng Wuyan and she poured qi into it.A moment later.\u201c Pfft! Hahaha!\u201dUnder the shocked gaze of the Shadow Guards, she was laughing so hard that her flowers were trembling.\u201cThe chief disciple of the Tianshu Institute was beaten up by Ran\u2019er? Hahaha!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s really my good disciple. He\u2019s playing well!\u201d\u201cYi Qinglan, you can\u2019t beat me! Your disciple can\u2019t beat mine disciple either!\u201d\u201cAs a reward\u2026 Mn, let\u2019s only wait for him for three days.\u201d Leng Wuyan nodded in satisfaction.\u201cRan\u2019er\u2019s talent is indeed very strong. Even her innate dao body is no match for him! No, it should be because of my teachings to him!\u201dAt this moment, the shadow guard said, \u201cSect Master, there\u2019s still some verbal information left.\u201d\u201cSpeak.\u201d\u201cThe Tianshu Institute announces to the world that Sheng Zi Li Ran has been listed as the sect\u2019s arch-enemy. If the disciples of the sect were to encounter him, they were to kill him without a doubt! The others can bring Li Ran\u2019s head in exchange for three spirit treasures and five immortal materials!\u201dBoom!In an instant, the palace began to tremble. An ice-cold pressure enveloped the entire Demon Peak!The shadow guard trembled as he laid on the ground, unable to lift a single finger!A moment later, Leng Wuyan\u2019s cold voice rang out, \u201cPass down my message that the Youluo Temple has entered a state of war. The disciples of the Tianshu Institute will be hunted within the entire vast lands! From the elders to the inner disciples, order all of them to block the White Cloud Peak\u2019s entrance. If anyone from the Tianshu Institute dares to come out, immediately kill them!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d The Shadow Guard was terrified.It\u2019s over, the Sect Master has gone crazy this time\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94: Sect Master, Sheng Zi has returned!Wuyang, Li Family residence.\u201cHahahahaha!\u201d Li Wuqiang\u2019s laughter echoed throughout the entire mansion.The Li Family members were dumbfounded.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with the Patriarch? He\u2019s been laughing for an entire day\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I don\u2019t dare to ask!\u201d\u201cThe forefather has been in the secret ground for over a hundred years. Has he gone insane?\u201d\u201cI heard that the old ancestor is old. Could it be that he has Alzheimer\u2019s disease just like Second Elder Wu?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything wrong with the ancestor\u2026 but are you all tired of living and dare to badmouth the ancestor?\u201dLi Daoyuan was also worried.Could the forefather really be sick? That was not good news for the Li family.\u2014On the secret grounds, Li Wuqiang\u2019s old face was beaming like a chrysanthemum.\u201cGood grandson, truly my good grandson!\u201d\u201cI casually asked him to beat up Tianshu Institute Sect leader\u2019s personal disciple. He beat up the Chief Disciple!\u201d\u201cIs Yi Qinglan going to die from anger this time? Haha, for you to steal this old man\u2019s fortune back then, and for my Li Clan\u2019s descendants to beat up your disciple this time, this is truly a relief!\u201dRecalling Li Ran, Li Wuqiang nodded his head in admiration.\u201cAlthough that kid is a bit shameless and has extremely thick skin, he did keep his promise!\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll do what I promised him!\u201d\u201cXiao Qingge, I will guarantee your safety!\u201dHowever, Li Ran only fought in the spur of the moment, but his actions caused such a huge impact.He had enough food and drink in the City Lord\u2019s mansion before preparing to return to the sect.\u2026Qingzhou City gate\u2026Xiang Ze and the Vice City Lord were all smiles. \u201cTake care, Sheng Zi. Come and play again next time!\u201d\u201cAll right, you can leave now.\u201d Li Ran dismissed them with a wave.Then, with a thought, an enormous dragon chariot appeared beside him.Six white horses neighed, the horse had wings on its ribs, a horn on its head, and a faint glow on its body.It looked extremely miraculous.The horse was pulling on the carriage. The carriage was inlaid with jeweled pearls and engraved with dragon and phoenix designs. It was extremely grandiose.On the carriage was a huge golden palanquin. The breeze blew the bell and swayed, creating a beautiful ring like that of a phoenix.This was the reward for the mission he had obtained during the Demon Slaying Conference\u2013the dragon chariot.This was a flying artifact.Usually, it assumed a miniature size. As long as one pours qi into it, one could turn it into a chariot.As long as the dragon chariot was activated, it could fly according to the user\u2019s intentions. The horse would never be tired.The formation carved on the carriage would automatically absorb qi, so Li Ran didn\u2019t need to waste a single drop of his qi.In addition, this artifact had a certain defensive ability.According to the system\u2019s instructions, it could withstand attacks of a Golden Core cultivator.Although the defensive capability wasn\u2019t that strong, it was better than nothing.Li Ran boarded the chariot and sat in the luxurious sedan chair.The six stallions raised their legs and hissed, flapping their wings as they pulled the carriage into the air.The surrounding people released waves of cries of alarm.There were even some who knelt and kowtowed, thinking that the human emperor had descended.On the other hand, Xiang Ze and the Vice City Lord clasped hands in shock and watched the dragon chariot turn into a small dot on the horizon.\u201cHow extravagant! Worthy of being the Sheng Zi of the Youluo Temple! He\u2019s so magnanimous!\u201d Xiang Ze sighed.The Vice City lord was puzzled. \u201cOnly the imperial family can use the imperial chariot, right? Isn\u2019t he being too arrogant?\u201dXiang Ze glanced at him. \u201cHe has the right to be arrogant. Do you care? You, on the other hand, dare to say that Li Ran is arrogant? Aren\u2019t you too arrogant?\u201dVice City Lord was silent once more. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u2014Today, the Youluo Temple welcomed a special guest.In the Sect Master\u2019s bedroom, Leng Wuyan and a Daoist nun were staring at each other.The two of them stared at each other for an entire hour without blinking. The atmosphere was tense.The Daoist nun\u2019s face was covered with a veil and her face could not be seen clearly. However, her pair of water-cut eyes were clear, as if she could stare through one\u2019s heart.In the end, it was the Daoist nun who moved her gaze away first.Leng Wuyan clapped happily. \u201cYi Qinglan, you\u2019ve lost again!\u201dIf others heard these words, they would most likely be shocked.That white-robed Daoist nun was the head of Tianshu Institute, Yi Qinglan!The two leaders of the opposing path were staring at each other?No one would believe it.Yi Qinglan shook her head and said, \u201cLeng Wuyan, you should change your name to Leng Boredom!\u201dLeng Wuyan glared at her. \u201cSince when do you joke?\u201dYi Qinglan said indifferently, \u201cThis poor Daoist is not joking, you are really bored.\u201dLeng Wuyan gave a cut. \u201cIf you can\u2019t stare at me, then does that mean I\u2019m bored? Yi Qinglan, you\u2019re still so hypocritical.\u201dYi Qinglan didn\u2019t get angry and said calmly, \u201cSo you\u2019d rather be a devil that has been spurned by others than a hypocritical Righteous Path cultivator?\u201dLeng Wuyan shook her head. \u201cWho told you that I\u2019m a devil?\u201dYi Qinglan replied, \u201cThis is the consensus of the entire world.\u201d\u201cThe people of the world?\u201dLeng Wuyan sneered. \u201cWhat do the thoughts of the world have to do with me?\u201cWhat about the Righteous Path? What about the Devil Path?\u201cAccording to my thoughts, I am the Heavenly Path!\u201dYi Qinglan\u2019s breath froze for a moment before she sighed and said, \u201cYou\u2019re still so arrogant and don\u2019t place anyone in your eyes.\u201dLeng Wuyan shrugged. \u201cThis is my Dao.\u201dYi Qinglan was speechless for a moment.The atmosphere became quiet.After a long while, Leng Wuyan said, \u201cYou are not here to discuss the Dao, right?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Yi Qinglan\u2019s expression was complicated. \u201cYou want to start a war with the Tianshu Institute?\u201dLeng Wuyan snorted, \u201cSince you want to deal with my Sheng Zi, I\u2019ll naturally play with you.\u201dA trace of anger flashed through Yi Qinglan\u2019s eyes, and her voice grew even more stern. \u201cIt\u2019s him who damaged Lin Langyue\u2019s heart!\u201dLeng Wuyan did not back down and looked at her. \u201cThat\u2019s because your disciple\u2019s skills are inferior!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d The two auras collided, and the things in the hall were completely unharmed. However, the clouds above Demon Peak had disappeared!Yi Qinglan forcefully held back her anger. \u201cIf you want to continue like this, a great battle between the Righteous Path and Devil Path will begin. At that time, the Vast Lands will be left in ruins, can you commit such a terrifying sin?\u201dLeng Wuyan still refused to back down. \u201cI\u2019ll bear all the heavy sins! But to touch Li Ran was absolutely impossible!\u201dYi Qinglan\u2019s chest rose and fell, yet a wisp of faint helplessness arose in her heart.This Leng Wuyan was truly a madwoman\u2026\u201cHow can I make you stop?\u201d Yi Qinglan\u2019s tone softened.Leng Wuyan hugged her shoulders and snorted. \u201cI\u2019ll stop when the Tianshu Institute withdraws.\u201d\u201cNo, everyone in the world is watching. This is a slap to the face to the Tianshu Institute.\u201d Yi Qinglan shook her head and gave a firm refusal.Leng Wuyan shrugged. \u201cThen there\u2019s nothing we can do. Let\u2019s see who kills the other faster.\u201dAt that moment, a disciple\u2019s report came from outside. \u201cSect Master, Sheng Zi has returned!\u201dYi Qinglan\u2019s eyes turned cold.\u201cHe\u2019s back?\u201d Leng Wuyan was pleasantly surprised as she stood up.Sensing Yi Qinglan\u2019s strange gaze, she cleared her throat and slowly sat back down.Yi Qinglan sized her up and felt that something was wrong with the Demoness.\u201cYou can\u2019t be\u2026\u201dLeng Wuyan shook her head. \u201cNo, I am not.\u201dYi Qinglan pinched her chin. \u201cThis isn\u2019t an urgent matter, correct?\u201dLeng Wuyan\u2019s face was as cold as frost. \u201cSomeone, escort the guest away.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95: Strange Gift!Mount Xuanling\u2019s Training Grounds\u2026It was the midst of a lunch break. After the disciples had finished their lunch, they sat down at this training ground to rest.A group of disciples surrounded Lu Xinran, they blinked as they listened to her.\u201cThat\u2019s the Grand Myriad Mountain Range, with terrifying demon beasts residing everywhere. It\u2019s one of the most dangerous places in the vast land! Every year, there would be casualties in the sect.\u201cBut just because we were led by Sheng Zi, not only did we complete the mission as quickly as possible, we also achieved the miracle of not losing a single disciple!\u201d\u201cI remember that it was a big bear demon that was more than ten meters tall. It howled as it pounced. We were extremely afraid\u2026\u201cBut in the end, Sheng Zi\u2019s attack was enough to split the bear demon in half\u2026\u2026\u201dLu Xinran immediately gestured and spat. These disciples who had not participated in the training were listening with relish.In the end, she even imitated Li Ran\u2019s tone and said, \u201cThe Immortal Path is a bitter and cold journey, and the great dao is difficult to seek!\u201d\u201cOnly by treading forward bravely and holding your head high can we become immortals!\u201d\u201cThe most important thing in cultivation is talent, but what is more important than talent is the firm belief of never backing down!\u201dThese kinds of impassioned words caused the disciples\u2019 blood to boil.One of the disciples raised his hand and asked, \u201cSenior Sister Lu, when will Sheng Zi return?\u201d\u201cYeah, we really want to meet Sheng Zi.\u201d\u201cI heard that Sheng Zi is handsome.\u201dThose disciples\u2019 eyes were filled with yearning, and they had already taken Li Ran as their idol.Lu Xinran sighed. \u201cLet alone all of you, I want to know that myself\u2026 I miss Sheng Zi\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Sheng Zi! Sheng Zi has returned!\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d Lu Xinran suddenly raised her head, her eyes filled with excitement.A luxurious dragon chariot descended from the sky. Six stallions raised their heads and neighed. Accompanied by a series of dragon and phoenix cries, they slowly landed on the Daoist Rite.Li Ran pushed open the golden door and stretched lazily.\u201cI arrived so quickly? With this magical artifact, the ride was more comfortable than a first-class cabin!\u201d\u201cLord Sheng Zi!\u201dAccompanied by a familiar shout, a petite figure flew over.Lu Xinran crashed headfirst into Li Ran\u2019s arms, holding his neck and stroking his face.\u201cLord Sheng Zi, you\u2019ve finally returned. I\u2019ve missed you to death\u2026\u201dLi Ran\u2019s brows jumped as he lifted her collar and threw her away.The group of disciples looked at him, their eyes filled with stars.This was their Sheng Zi?So handsome!He was a hundred times more handsome than the legends!Whoosh!A group of young disciples rushed over and stood in front of Li Ran.Although their cultivation wasn\u2019t deep, everyone\u2019s eyes were determined. They were very different from those cutesy ones.These were all disciples who had followed him to the Grand Myriad Mountain Range to train.After returning from his training, a third of them had at least broken through a small realm, and half of them had been taken into the Inner Sect.The proportion was so high that even an elder would click his tongue in amazement.\u201cGreetings, Sheng Zi!\u201dThey all knelt on one knee in unison, their voices high, piercing through the clouds.Li Ran\u2019s gaze swept across everyone\u2019s cheeks. They held their heads and chests high, their eyes flashing with fervor and worship.\u201cCultivate properly,\u201d he said with indifference.\u201cYes!\u201d the disciples responded loudly.Yi Qinglan stood in the clouds and silently watched this scene.\u201cThis is Li Ran? He seems to be a good seedling. It\u2019s a pity that he entered a Devil Sect.\u201cThe people of the Devil Sect have always been arrogant and untamable, yet they trust him so much. I think he must be extraordinary.\u201d\u201cBut no matter what, he shouldn\u2019t have damaged Langyue\u2019s Dao-heart!\u201d A trace of anger flashed through Yi Qinglan\u2019s eyes. In an instant, a storm brewed on the horizon. However, when she recalled her conversation with Leng Wuyan, she shook his head and sighed.\u201d\u201cThat crazy b*tch\u2026 Forget it, I\u2019ll leave this matter to the young.\u201dShe took a serious look at Li Ran and turned into a streak of light, disappearing from the scene.Li Ran seemed to have noticed something. He looked up and saw that the sun was shining brightly. There was nothing strange about it.\u201cPerhaps it was an illusion!?\u201dUnder the gaze of all the disciples, Li Ran slowly left with his hands clasped behind his back.Back to his residence, Aqin had been waiting outside the door.Seeing Li Ran, she was pleasantly surprised. \u201cMilord, you\u2019ve returned.\u201dAqin wanted to welcome him, but her footsteps were somewhat hesitant. She stood there foolishly.In her heart, she was still just a servant.She had neither the qualifications nor the courage to get close to Li Ran.Li Ran didn\u2019t think too much. He reached out and rubbed her head, \u201cYes, I\u2019m back\u2026\u201dThen he pushed the door open and walked in.Aqin looked at his back, her tensed body softening, her eyes full of smiles.\u201cYou came back\u2026 great.\u201dIn the bedroom, Aqin poured him tea and obediently stood by his side.Li Ran drank the tea and suddenly thought of something.\u201cBy the way, I brought you some small gifts.\u201d\u201cA gift?\u201d Aqin was stunned. This word was too unfamiliar to her.Li Ran waved his hand and a pile of clothes fell onto the bed.These were all things that he had sent people to buy. They came from the best clothing store in the imperial capital. Whether it was the materials or the workmanship, they could be said to be the best.\u201cYou\u2019re always wearing that set of clothes. I already got tired of looking at it. This time, I bought you a bit more clothes. You can choose whichever one you like,\u201d Li Ran said.Aqin was still wearing the clothes of a servant, of which its color was ashen, and the cloth was extremely coarse.It just so happened that when he returned home, he had someone buy more.Aqin stared at him in a daze, tears quickly filling her eyes.Li Ran frowned. \u201cWhat, you don\u2019t like it?\u201dAqin wiped her tears and shook her head, \u201cNo, I like it very much. Aqin is just too happy. This is the first time Aqin has received a gift from Sheng Zi\u2026\u201dLi Ran said with a good smile, \u201cIt\u2019s just a few pieces of clothing. Look at how touched you are\u2026 Hurry up and try it.\u201d\u201cMn,\u201d Aqin replied.She walked to the side of the bed and looked at the dazzling array of clothes. For a moment, she did not know how to make a move, but in the end, she picked up a random piece.\u201cHmm? Sheng Zi, what is this???\u201dLi Ran turned around and saw that she was holding a pink dudou* in her hand with a somewhat confused expression.[TLN: Traditional Chinese undergarment. Google to know what it looks like.]There were very few hollow fabrics on the belly pouch, and it even emitted a faint fragrance, making one\u2019s mind sway.Li Ran almost spat out his tea.He had sent someone to buy these clothes because that person\u2019s figure was similar to Aqin\u2019s.But who would have thought that she would buy these strange things?\u201cIt\u2019s an accident\u2026\u201d Before Li Ran could finish, he was stunned.Aqin had already taken off her old clothes and changed into the dudou, revealing her slender arms and delicate collarbone.Her small face blushed, as she timidly asked, \u201cSheng Zi, how does this look?\u201dLi Ran felt his throat drying. \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96: A Gift For Leng Wuyan!Li Ran\u2019s eyes became dull.The air fell into an eerie silence.\u201cI told you to try it, but I didn\u2019t tell you to change in front of me!\u201d He covered his face helplessly.Aqin: (O_O)In the end, Li Ran blushed and helped her pick a set of clothes.After Aqin had changed clothes, her entire aura changed.The light pink robe was wrapped around her body, and inside was a white gauze robe, revealing her beautiful neck.The folds of her skirt reflected snow with brilliance. Three thousand black hair was tied up with a hair strap, and the faintly discernible red leaf on her cheeks added a touch of innocence to her.Aqin pulled at the hem of her robe and nervously asked, \u201cLord Sheng Zi, isn\u2019t it strange?\u201dLi Ran\u2019s eyes were filled with admiration. \u201cNo, it\u2019s very beautiful.\u201dAqin heaved a sigh of relief and became excited.Because of the transformation of the beautiful woman\u2019s body, her skin was as white and delicate as silk.Every move had a seductive aura.With the timid look in her eyes, there was a strong temptation to be charming and pure.Li Ran realized something and asked in confusion, \u201cYou\u2026 you broke through again?\u201dHer aura was much thicker than before.Aqin nodded. \u201cEver since you left the mountain, I\u2019ve been cultivating. I\u2019ve broken through to the late-stage of Qi Refining.\u201dLi Ran couldn\u2019t say anything. \u201c\u2026\u201dIf I remember correctly, when she first left the mountain, Aqin was still at the middle stage of Qi Refining.Not long after, she had already broken through to the late stage!This cultivation speed was even faster than his?Li Ran\u2019s talent was saint-grade.Theoretically speaking, he has the highest talent that had ever appeared in the Vast Lands.Other than some extremely rare constitutions, no one could break through the realm faster than him.The reason why Aqin was able to increase her speed was not only because of her \u2018master\u2019s mission\u2019, but also because of her constitution and cultivation methods.Previously, Li Ran had practiced the top-level cultivation technique, the Ethereal Sifting Holy Tome.This cultivation method was extremely obscure and had slow improvement. However, every small advancement would trigger a qualitative change. On the same cultivation, one\u2019s combat strength was extremely strong.And Aqin was cultivating the \u2018Mysterious Light Sutra\u2019.This was a dual cultivation technique in itself. It was to improve their companion\u2019s cultivation, so it was easy to cultivate.Coupled with the highly compatible Maiden Spirit Body, it was not surprising to have such an unprecedented cultivation speed.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Let\u2019s continue.\u201d Li Ran praised her.\u201cAqin will work hard. She will build her foundation as soon as possible!\u201d Aqin nodded happily.\u201dAt the same time, she muttered in her heart, \u201cI\u2019ll try to cultivate with the Sheng Zi as soon as possible!\u201dLi Ran came out of his residence and walked towards Demon Peak.Thinking that he was about to meet the Sect Master, he was both happy and nervous.\u201cThe cancellation of the engagement was so big that the Sect Master must have known about it\u2026\u201cI don\u2019t know if she\u2019ll be angry. What if she cuts me in one blow?\u201d\u201cHai\u2026 there\u2019s a knife at my head!\u201dJust like that, he let his imagination run wild and arrived in front of the Sect Master\u2019s bedroom.The black-clothed guard raised his hand to stop him. \u201cSheng Zi, stop.\u201dLi Ran stopped. \u201cI\u2019m here to see the Sect Master.\u201dThe guard said, \u201cThe master said that no one is allowed here today.\u201dLi Ran frowned and said worriedly, \u201cSect Master, are you injured?\u201dRecently, the situation has been surging. It seemed like the Devil Path was going to form some kind of alliance. Had Leng Wuyan run out to fight with someone?The guard shook his head and said, \u201cThe Sect Master said that she was tired. She just wanted to rest.\u201d\u201cShe is tired?\u201dLi Ran raised his head to look at the bright sunlight. \u201cIt\u2019s just noon. Is she going to rest?\u201dThe guard nodded seriously.At that moment, Deacon Wang walked past the two of them with a basket of spirit fruits and walked straight into the bedroom.Li Ran was taken aback for a moment and said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stop her?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d The guard stuttered for a long time.If Li Ran couldn\u2019t tell, he would be a fool.\u201cAll right, looks like the sect master didn\u2019t close the door to all guests. She merely didn\u2019t want to see me.\u201dLi Ran sighed and took out a box. \u201cThen please give this to the Sect Master.\u201dThen, he turned around and left dejectedly.\u2014In the bedroom\u2026Deacon Wang, who was placing the spiritual fruit, said, \u201cSect master, I just saw Sheng Zi. Don\u2019t you want him to come in?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to see him now,\u201d Leng Wuyan said sternly.\u201cOh, okay.\u201d Deacon Wang shivered and quickly left after putting down the spirit fruit.Leng Wuyan\u2019s expression fell as she mumbled angrily, \u201cDisloyal disciple, it\u2019s fine if you\u2019re fooling around outside, but you didn\u2019t come to see me immediately!\u201d\u201cThis time, I have to dry you up!\u201dAt this moment, the door knocked and a guard walked in. \u201cGreetings, Sect Master.\u201dLeng Wuyan asked, \u201cThe Sheng Zi has left?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already sent him away according to your instructions,\u201d the guard replied.Then, he presented a box. \u201cThis is what Sheng Zi asked me to pass to you before he left.\u201d\u201cYes, put it on the table,\u201d Leng Wuyan casually said.\u201cYes!\u201d The guard put the box down and left.As soon as he left, Leng Wuyan stood up and walked briskly to the table.Looking at the exquisite Immortal Wooden Box, the corner of her mouth curled into a smile. \u201c Humph, it\u2019s considered that you have some conscience. You even know how to bring me a gift! Well, since that\u2019s the case, let\u2019s not hang you for another four hours.\u201dShe carefully opened the box.The moment he opened it, she was stunned.One could only feel the immortal qi that is emitted from the box, followed by a bright divine light. If it weren\u2019t for the Immortal Wood, it would have caused a heaven and earth phenomenon.Thousand-year-old White Vine, Extreme Yang Grass, Divine Ning Flower, Black Blood Lotus\u2026It was a box full of immortal materials!Even she rarely saw these precious treasures. If she took them out, it would cause the sect to fight!Leng Wuyan\u2019s throat twitched. \u201cThis should be Ran\u2019er\u2019s harvest in the secret realm, right?\u201dShe knew the value of these immortal materials and their value to cultivators.This was a great fortune!And Li Ran gave it to her!\u201c Tch, you think you can please me with just this?\u201dLeng Wuyan pursed her lips, but the smile in her eyes could not be hidden anymore.It was not because of these treasures, but because of Li Ran\u2019s sincerity and affection for her.At that moment, Leng Wuyan noticed that there was another item in the box.\u201cThis is\u2026 a sculpture?\u201dShe reached out to take it out. Just as she took a look, she couldn\u2019t help but be stunned.This was a piece of sculpture carved from precious material.It was a woman with a candy man.The woman\u2019s clothes under the white robe were thin, revealing her slender neck. Her skirt fluttered, and her calves were slender and round.She was holding a candy man. It was unknown who had bitten off half of it.The woman\u2019s expression seemed to be one of anger and joy. Although she didn\u2019t appear in the slightest, Leng Wuyan still recognized her.This was her.This sculpture couldn\u2019t be said to be lifelike. Some of the lines were even very stiff, but one could see the sculptor\u2019s intentions.Leng Wuyan stared blankly at the sculpture as if she could imagine how clumsy Li Ran was when he was sculpting it.A wisp of mist rose in her eyes as she turned her head and said in a low voice, \u201cThis traitorous disciple is annoying\u2026\u201dShe solemnly put the sculpture away.In her eyes, this clumsy sculpture was far more meaningful than those immortal materials.\u201cForget it,\u201d Leng Wuyan said.Leng Wuyan rubbed her eyes and stepped out of the bedroom. \u201cI want to see him now!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97: It\u2019s hard to have a girlfriend\u2026Leng Wuyan hid herself and followed Li Ran back to his residence.She stood outside the door and hesitated for a long time.But in the end, she held back from meeting him.She knew Li Ran\u2019s charm.He was handsome and had a high talent. This time, he defeated Lin Langyue and became the first-ranked Heavenly Devil on the Heavenly Devil Rankings.It was unknown how many female cultivators wanted to form a bond with him.Not to mention the distance, in this sect, which female disciple didn\u2019t covet the body of the Sheng Zi?If it weren\u2019t for the restrictions of the sect, something even more outrageous than the Joyous Unity Sect would have happened.\u201cMm, I can\u2019t easily forgive him. Otherwise, I don\u2019t know how many girls he\u2019ll hook up with.\u201d Leng Wuyan made up her mind and quietly returned to her bedroom.\u2014\u201cAi~\u201dLi Ran propped his chin up, unable to move.\u201cIt\u2019s over. The Sect Master didn\u2019t even respond to my gift. Looks like she\u2019s really angry\u2026\u201dThe gift was carefully prepared by him.To finish carving that stone, he had failed countless times, and even the stone gate in Li\u2019s family secret grounds was nearly cut clean by him.Originally, he thought that he could fight for leniency, but who would have thought that it would be like throwing a stone into the sea and not receiving any splash.In the past, Leng Wuyan had always been angry and jealous, but she had never been so cold-hearted.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you beat me up and chop me twice?\u201dLi Ran rubbed his hair.As he recalled the details of how the two of them interacted with each other, a light flashed in his mind.\u201cYes!\u201cThis will move her!\u201dLi Ran spread out a piece of paper and dipped his brush in ink. After some thought, he began to write and draw.\u2014At sunset, the sky gradually darkened.Demon Peak also lit up with lights.\u201cSheng Zi, don\u2019t make things difficult for me. The Sect Master really doesn\u2019t want any guests.\u201d The guard looked helpless.Li Ran shook his head and took out a sandalwood box. \u201cI\u2019m not here to ask for an audience, but to trouble you to hand this over to the Sect Master.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dThe guard took it and nodded. \u201cOkay, no problem.\u201dLi Ran looked through the window. The lights in the palace were flickering, but he could not see his master.Leng Wuyan laid on the bed and carefully examined the stone sculpture in her hand.\u201cHow could I be so ugly? Idiot, how stupid.\u201dEven though she said that the smile on his face could not be hidden.Looking at the half-sugar man in the stone sculpture, she couldn\u2019t help but recall the scene of their first date.Li Ran took a bite and bit off the makeup on the candy man\u2019s face\u2026 Leng Wuyan blushed and her heart skipped a beat as she rolled on the bed with the sculpture in her arms.\u201cAre we\u2026 kissing?\u201cNo, not at all. At most, it can only be considered an indirect kiss.\u201d\u201cWhat would it feel like if I kissed him?\u201dJust as Leng Wuyan was having her fantasies, there was a knock.She immediately sat upright.The guard carefully walked in and respectfully said, \u201cSect Master, I\u2019ve disturbed your rest.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Leng Wuyan asked.The guard handed over a box. \u201cSheng Zi asked me to give you this.\u201dLeng Wuyan was taken aback.Another gift?\u201cPut it down.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The guard put it down and left.Leng Wuyan took the sandalwood box, her eyes full of smiles.\u201c Tsk, do you think you can move me by giving me a few more gifts?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see what you\u2019re giving this time\u2026\u201dShe looked at the box carefully and felt that it looked a little familiar.All of a sudden, she remembered that it was the same as the pillbox that Li Ran had originally put in the shadow stone.Recounting the confession, Leng Wuyan\u2019s heart skipped a beat.She opened the box. This time, there were no abnormalities or any light. She saw a booklet lying quietly inside.It was a stack of rice paper bound together.The paper was also reinforced, making it much harder and more flexible.Leng Wuyan opened the book and saw a picture on it.The painting was of a woman looking at the railing. In front of her was a snowy mountain.The brushstrokes of this painting were very strange. It was not the kind of painting that was popular in the mortal world but was drawn with a thin demonic fox brush.Using the most concise lines could produce a very realistic effect.She showed off the woman\u2019s cold beauty perfectly.Leng Wuyan\u2019s eyes flashed with astonishment. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect Ran\u2019er to have such ability.\u201dShe flipped back, and the scenes appeared before her eyes. From the moment Li Ran confessed to her, the two of them had gotten along with each other bit by bit.However, there was a lot of similarity in length, but there was a slight difference in movements.Leng Wuyan slowly flipped through it, her expression sometimes shy, sometimes happy, sometimes resentful.At the end of the day, she still wanted more.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect him to remember every moment of our relationship\u2026\u201dLeng Wuyan\u2019s lips curled into a smile as her eyes sparkled.At this moment, she noticed that there was still content on the back of the last page.There was a small line written on it.[Flip the album, press your thumb against the edge and quickly flip through it.]Below, there was a sketch set of sketches underneath that would create a motion upon flipping the pages*.[TLN: I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s a flipbook, created from when the drawer draws picture frame by frame per page, and when the page is flipped at a fast pace, each frame is flipped so fast it turns into an animation.]Leng Wuyan was taken aback. \u201cIs there more?\u201dShe did as she was told.She bent the album, pressed her thumb against the edge, and gently released it. She quickly flipped the page.Leng Wuyan was stunned.As the pages of the painting flipped, the characters on it started to move!From Demon Peak, Li Ran\u2019s loud confession, the \u201cunexpected\u201d spar at the back of the mountain.On the last date, Li Ran bit off the candy man. The two of them played in the snow, leaving a trail of footprints\u2026One by one, the static pictures showed a dynamic effect.Every move was vivid!This was completely different from seeing it for the first time!Like a sweet bullet, it instantly touched Leng Wuyan\u2019s heart.She clutched her burning cheeks, her eyes becoming watery.\u201cThis traitor\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, I cannot take it anymore. I want to see him right now!\u201dLeng Wuyan was in no mood to hang on to him anymore.The matter of the engagement had been forgotten, and all the complaints had disappeared. Now, she only wanted to sit with Li Ran, even if it was just a conversation\u2026\u201cSomeone come!\u201d Leng Wuyan called out.The guard walked in and knelt on one knee. \u201cWhat orders do you have, Master?\u201d\u201cIf the Holy Son comes back these two days\u2026\u201dLeng Wuyan turned her head and her ears turned red. \u201cYou, you\u2019re not allowed to stop him.\u201d\u2014In the bedroom\u2026Li Ran looked out the window at the distant Demon Peak and sighed silently.\u201cAi, it\u2019s hard to have a girlfriend\u2026 Chasing the Sect Master is like seeking for my ownAt this moment, Aqin knocked on the door and walked in. \u201cLord Sheng Zi, the water is ready\u2026 Eh? Why do you look so pale?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98: Y-y-you want me to take a bath with you?Aqin asked curiously, \u201cLord Sheng Zi, you don\u2019t look too good. Is there something bothering you?\u201dLi Ran shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re still young, you won\u2019t understand.\u201dAqin puffed up her chest and said proudly, \u201cLord Sheng Zi, Aqin is neither young nor old. She\u2019s older than you by a year.\u201dLi Ran rubbed his forehead. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m referring to.\u201dAqin had been following him since she was young. Other than him, she had never come into contact with the members of the opposite sex. How could she understand such a thing?Moreover, he couldn\u2019t tell her about the matter with the sect master.\u201cWell, to show my sincerity, I\u2019d better go to the Sect Master again. Even if she taught me a lesson, it would still be better than letting my imagination run wild.\u201dIn the end, it was his fault.He was engaged, yet he had confessed to Leng Wuyan\u2026Although these two things were not his subjective wishes, since they had happened, he would not escape responsibility.Thinking of this, Li Ran made up his mind.Aqin said at this time, \u201cLord Sheng Zi, the water is ready. Would you like to take a bath first?\u201dLi Ran put on his coat and walked out. \u201cNo, I have something to do.\u201d\u2014He stepped on reflecting moonlight on his way to Demon Peak.The guards were used to it. \u201cThe Sheng Zi is here again. Why aren\u2019t you resting this late?\u201dLi Ran scratched his head and said awkwardly, \u201cPlease convey my message again. I have something important to report to the Master.\u201dHe had to close the door several times and his face couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.The guard shook his head. \u201cNo need to report.\u201dLi Ran sighed. \u201cLooks like Master still won\u2019t see me\u2026\u201dThe two guards opened the door. \u201cPlease come in.\u201dLi Ran was stunned.He couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201cMaster finally let me in?\u201dThe guard nodded. \u201cThe Sect Master has instructed that the next time Sheng Zi visits, there\u2019s no need to stop him.\u201d\u201cLooks like Master has calmed down!\u201dLi Ran\u2019s eyes lit up with joy and he walked into his bedroom.\u2014Behind the silk canopy embroidered with gold and silver threads, steam rose in spirals.Leng Wuyan was soaking in the bathtub. The warm Sky Mountain Spring Water was soaking her delicate body, and she looked very satisfied.Although her body was clean and she was immune to cold and heat, she still enjoyed bathing.While she was taking a bath, the Sect Master\u2019s responsibilities, the sect\u2019s affairs, the Righteous and Devil battles\u2026 All the distracting thoughts had left her, and her mind had become clear and transparent.It was as if what was being washed was not the body, but the soul.Therefore, she had to bathe for a while almost every day.Leng Wuyan leaned against the edge of the pool. Her slender jade arms stretched out from the water as she toyed with the stone sculpture that Li Ran had given her.The more she looked, the more she felt like it.Because she was worried that the water vapor would wet the ink, she had already put away the album.These two items were the best gifts Leng Wuyan had ever received.Although it wasn\u2019t as valuable as those immortal materials, the sincerity and value behind it were incomparable to any treasure.\u201cAlthough he didn\u2019t tell me about his engagement, for the sake of his attention\u2026\u201dThe corners of Leng Wuyan\u2019s lips curled up. \u201cI\u2019ll reluctantly forgive him.\u201dShasha.At this moment, a series of footsteps could be heard.Leng Wuyan was suddenly startled. Just as she had been completely immersed in the stone sculpture, there was someone who had entered her bedroom without her knowledge!\u201d\u201cWho is it? Why didn\u2019t the guards stop him?\u201dHer spirit sense instantly caught sight of the other party and she couldn\u2019t help but be stunned.\u201cRan\u2019er?\u201dNo wonder there was no movement outside. She was the one who told the guards to not stop Li Ran.But she didn\u2019t expect him to come this late.\u201cWhat should I do now?\u201dAs the sound of footsteps approached, Leng Wuyan\u2019s brain turned off.Li Ran lifted the cover with hesitation.The two of them looked at each other and the air instantly became quiet.\u201cSect Master?\u201dLi Ran stared blankly at the woman in front of him.Leng Wuyan\u2019s black hair curled up as she immersed herself in the water, only revealing a beautiful clavicle.Perhaps it was because of the heat, her fair face was flushed.Through the pool filled with various spirit flowers, one could vaguely see a hint of grace, but it was also indistinct.*Cough cough*Leng Wuyan suppressed her shyness. \u201cRan\u2019er, why are you here?\u201dLi Ran swallowed his saliva and said honestly, \u201cI was worried that Master was still angry, so I thought I\u2019d come over to take a look. I didn\u2019t expect you to be taking a bath\u2026\u201dLeng Wuyan turned her head and said, \u201cThis is my usual bathing time.\u201dLi Ran scratched his head. \u201cI just wanted to try my luck. I didn\u2019t expect that I\u2019d come in\u2026 I was planning to take a bath too. The water has already been heated.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Leng Wuyan said, \u201cThen do you want to come and soak together?\u201dAfter saying that, she regretted it and secretly pinched herself.What was she saying?Who would invite someone to take a bath with them?\u201cAh?\u201d Li Ran was dumbfounded. \u201cThis is inappropriate, yes?\u201dTaking a bath with the Sect Master? He would never dream of such a thing!After saying that, Leng Wuyan had no choice but to hold on. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing inappropriate about it. This pool isn\u2019t small either. It\u2019s enough for the two of us.\u201dLi Ran said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of size\u2026\u201dThe main reason was that it was too sudden and he was not mentally prepared.Leng Wuyan took the opportunity to step down from the slope and said, \u201cIf you think it\u2019s inappropriate, you can wait for me to wash up. You can change the water before soaking it.\u201d\u201cChange the water?\u201dLi Ran thought to himself, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t soak it, Master wouldn\u2019t think that I would mind the dirty water, right? That\u2019s a huge misunderstanding!\u201dHe had finally managed to coax his master, so he couldn\u2019t make her angry again!Thinking of this, Li Ran said resolutely, \u201cThere\u2019s no need. I\u2019m willing to take a bath with Master!\u201dLeng Wuyan was speechless. \u201c\u2026\u201dHer throat was dry and she said with difficulty, \u201cBut I\u2019ve already used this water.\u201dLi Ran said firmly, \u201cI don\u2019t mind!\u201dNow that the matter had accelerated to this point, Leng Wuyan could do nothing about it.Li Ran walked to the pool and said awkwardly, \u201cMaster, I will take off my clothes.\u201dLeng Wuyan\u2019s face turned red. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to report this to me.\u201dLi Ran nodded and undressed at his fastest speed. Then, he plunged into the pool.Even so, Leng Wuyan caught a glimpse of his muscular body and her heart trembled with shame.The two of them sank into the pool and only exposed their heads.The atmosphere was a little awkward.This pool was for the Sect Master\u2019s personal use. Although it wasn\u2019t small, it wasn\u2019t very large.The distance between the two was roughly two arms apart. At the same time, she could reach out and touch him.Leng Wuyan\u2019s toes were about to reach him.She never thought that she would see Li Ran like this\u2026It was too strange!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99: Li Wuqiang\u2019s Notorious Past!Steam rose from the hot tub.Li Ran and Leng Wuyan were like two dumb geese, squatting foolishly in the tub, not daring to move.The two of them were both lovers and master and disciple.Their relationship carried a hint of taboo.At this moment, they were immersed in this pool together, all of the charming and ambiguous thoughts magnified.The water in the pond was so warm, did it carry a trace of the other party\u2019s warmth?As Leng Wuyan and Li Ran thought about this, their hearts almost popped out.Li Ran didn\u2019t even know where to put his eyes.This tub was the Sky Mountain Spring Water that could be drunk. It was already extremely clear.Although the surface of the water was sprinkled with spirit plants, Li Ran could still see her fair skin beneath the surface.\u201cToo deadly\u2026\u201dThe ripples in the tub shattered the beautiful scene, but the more he couldn\u2019t see it clearly, the more he wanted to find out.Suddenly, a bold thought appeared in his mind.Li Ran gulped and his pitch-black eyes were covered in gold.He quietly activated the Disillusioned Eye.Pfft!Li Ran\u2019s face turned red and his ears turned red. Blood slowly flowed from his nose.This is too exciting\u2026\u201cAre you alright? Isn\u2019t the temperature too high?\u201dLi Ran used his qi to stop his nosebleed. \u201cNo, it\u2019s because the disciple\u2019s blood pressure is too high.\u201d He shook his head.\u201cHmm??\u201dAlthough Leng Wuyan didn\u2019t know what blood pressure meant, after this interruption, her nervousness gradually relaxed.\u201cIsn\u2019t it just a bath? What\u2019s so great about it?\u201d She silently encouraged herself.After her mood eased slightly, Leng Wuyan took the initiative to say, \u201cEver since you came back, we haven\u2019t had a proper conversation. I heard that you entered the Burning Heaven Emperor\u2019s secret realm?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Li Ran raised his right hand and summoned a golden flame from his palm.\u201cBurning Heaven Sacred Flame!\u201d A trace of pleasant surprise flashed through Leng Wuyan\u2019s eyes. \u201cThis Heavenly Flame\u2019s rank is very high. This flame is the Burning Heaven Emperor\u2019s most important treasure. You have received a great fortune!\u201dLi Ran nodded.To be able to be described as a true treasure by his master, the flame was something extraordinary.Leng Wuyan\u2019s interest was piqued. \u201cTell me quickly, what happened in the secret realm?\u201dLi Ran told her everything that had happened in the secret realm.However, Xiao Qingge\u2019s existence was diluted.He wasn\u2019t deliberately lying to her.It was not a wise move to talk about another woman in front of her.After hearing that Li Ran had killed Song Qingsong, Leng Wuyan snorted. \u201cThat bastard Hao Yue still wants to cause trouble for you. I\u2019ve already given an ultimatum to the Supreme Dao Palace to not allow him to set foot in the Vast Land for a hundred years!\u201dThis was her style of doing things.Tyrannical, domineering, not explaining. Either fight or you have to endure.\u201cRight,\u201d Leng Wuyan thought of something, and then she said with puzzlement, \u201cBut I heard that the female disciple of the Myriad Sword Pavilion fought against the Supreme Dao Palace. She even dared to draw her sword against Chen Yundao\u2026\u201dShe sized Li Ran up. \u201cYou guys don\u2019t have anything, do you?\u201dOtherwise, why would a Righteous disciple protect a devil?Not to mention in front of Emperor-level experts.Li Ran laughed, \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s because this disciple saved her life!\u201d\u201cThen why did you save her?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201dSeeing Li Ran scratching his ears and cheeks, Leng Wuyan was both angry and amused.\u201cIn any case, pay attention to me. Don\u2019t mess around anymore. I haven\u2019t even settled the matter of your engagement with you!\u201dLi Ran said, \u201cThe engagement was made by the clan\u2019s ancestors. I didn\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\u201cAll right,\u201d Leng Wuyan rolled her eyes at him. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about this for now. When I want to hear about it, you can explain.\u201dNow that the two of them were bathing together, she did not want to hear about this.The bathtub was made of large pieces of spirit jade. The water in the pool would never cool down.At this moment, hot steam rose, and a strand of Leng Wuyan\u2019s black hair hung by her ear.She raised her hand to lift her hair, causing waves of ripples. Li Ran\u2019s blood pressure began to rise again\u2026He urgently needed to divert his attention.At this moment, he noticed the sculpture in her hand and said, \u201cMaster, didn\u2019t I give it to you? You won\u2019t even let go of it even during your bath.\u201dLeng Wuyan blushed, \u201cI just saw that it\u2019s a little dirty, so I brought it over to wash it together.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dLi Ran nodded with a smile and did not expose her.At this moment, Leng Wuyan asked, \u201cThis stone sculpture is made of a Demon Suppressing Stone. It\u2019s extremely rare in the Vast Land, yet you obtained it in the secret realm?\u201dLi Ran shook his head, \u201cThis was taken from a door.\u201d\u201cDoor?\u201dLeng Wuyan was somewhat puzzled.Li Ran gave her a brief account about the Li Clan Ancestor.Leng Wuyan said in surprise, \u201cYou\u2019re saying that Li Wuqiang is your ancestor?\u201dLi Ran was stunned for a moment and asked, \u201cMaster, do you know Old Li?\u201dLeng Wuyan nodded. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many Emperors in this Vast Land, so I naturally recognize them.\u201d\u201cLi Wuqiang\u2026 his strength was not bad in the past, but for the sake of fighting for an opportunity, he was injured by Yi Qinglan. He seemed to have damaged his Dao Foundation, so he rarely showed himself again.\u201dLi Ran suddenly understood.Li Wuqiang gritted his teeth when he mentioned the Tianshu Institute and even asked him to beat up the Sect Master\u2019s direct disciple. So that was the case.Leng Wuyan recalled. \u201cHe was a notorious pervert before. He used a broken red rope to tie up female cultivators everywhere, and he even called himself a binding artist.\u201dLi Ran was speechless. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cLater on, when he bound the disciples of the Youluo Temple, I couldn\u2019t bear to watch him any longer. I chased him from the north to the southern territory, and I destroyed more than ten of his holy treasures.\u201dThis matter was completely solved by her.No wonder Li Wuqiang was so frightened when he heard of Leng Wuyan\u2019s name, and he even call her violent.So there was such a thing in the past!An emperor-level pervert?Binding artist?Li Ran covered his face. \u201cHow embarrassing!\u201dIt turned out that his Ancestor wasn\u2019t stingy. Instead, his treasure had been destroyed by his master.Li Ran still admired him for saying that he couldn\u2019t leave the secret ground for the sake of his ancestors. Now it seemed that he didn\u2019t dare to come out\u2026Recalling the \u201cImmortal Binding Rope\u201d lying in his storage ring, Li Ran was completely certain that this was a tool for committing a crime.\u201cI cannot use this thing randomly in the future.\u201d He secretly made a decision.Leng Wuyan looked at him in amusement.In the past, she had taken Li Ran as her disciple because she had taken a fancy to his supreme talent and hadn\u2019t investigated his family background.Coupled with the fact that Li Wuqiang had stayed away from the world for a long time, she didn\u2019t expect them to have such a connection.Leng Wuyan deliberately snorted coldly. \u201cThen, in that case, you could be considered the descendant of my enemy. Tell me, how do you plan to compensate me?\u201dLi Ran thought for a moment before he tentatively said, \u201cHow about\u2026 a shot?\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100: Unfilial Disciple! You actually wanted to pounce his Master!After the words came out of Li Ran\u2019s mouth, he immediately regretted it.During the time he had been away from the sect, he had gotten used to flirting with girls. He had run his mouth in front of his master.His intuition told him that he might not see the sun tomorrow.However, Leng Wuyan chuckled and shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re good at planning\u2026 Forget it, I\u2019ll reluctantly agree to your request.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d!\u201dLi Ran was dumbfounded.Agreed?Happiness had come too suddenly!Li Ran was in disbelief and said cautiously, \u201cMaster, are you sure you want to be with this disciple\u2026?\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure.\u201d Leng Wuyan said matter-of-factly, \u201cHow can you be so serious about such a small matter? Do you think I\u2019m a stingy person?\u201d???A small matter?This was the harmony of life!Master didn\u2019t seem like such an open person?Could it be that there were hidden attributes?Li Ran\u2019s heart skipped a beat, and his throat was a little dry. \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, then I will not be polite.\u201dLeng Wuyan was taken aback. \u201cAh?\u201dLi Ran gritted his teeth and stood up from the water. He said shyly, \u201cMaster, where do we start?\u201dLeng Wuyan:(\u2299_\u2299)Leng Wuyan: \u2211(\u2299\u25bd\u2299\u2223\u2223\u2223Leng Wuyan: (O\u03c0O)Her cold and charming face instantly turned red. She hastily turned around and turned her back to him. \u201cYou, you, you, what are you doing?\u201d!\u201dSo direct?Li Ran wiped his nosebleed and raised his fist as if he was sworn. \u201cF*ck, of course!\u201dLeng Wuyan stomped her feet in anger. \u201cI mean, what do you want?\u201dLi Ran nodded. \u201cWant, I very much want!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThree seconds later.Li Ran squatted back into the pool with a swollen face. He was weak, pitiful, and helpless.Leng Wuyan\u2019s face flushed red as she hugged her shoulders and said angrily, \u201cAre you crazy?\u201dLi Ran said aggrievedly, \u201cDidn\u2019t you agree?\u201d\u201cThis master has agreed to forgive your family enmity. Who said we would do that?\u201d Leng Wuyan was very angry.\u201cAh?\u201dLi Ran was dumbfounded. \u201cWhat you\u2019re talking about is\u2026\u201dLeng Wuyan said, \u201cWhat I mean is, since we\u2019re all in the same bath, there\u2019s no need to mention the kindness and grudges from before\u2026 What do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201dLi Ran was speechless. \u201c\u2026\u201dIt wasn\u2019t an enemy\u2019s cannon!He clutched his face and wanted to cry but had no tears. Experiences had killed people!Recalling his actions just now, Li Ran felt like dying.It was too embarrassing!Leng Wuyan was not any different.\u201cSo he\u2019s always harboring evil thoughts towards me\u2026 How shameful!\u201d She wished she could find a hole in the ground.Since the matter has boiled down to this point, she couldn\u2019t continue taking the bath no matter what.Leng Wuyan flew out of the bathtub accompanied by a splash of water sound. She waved her hand and sucked in a towel, then wrapped it around her.Even though her movements were very fast, Li Ran still managed to catch a white figure with his keen insight.Leng Wuyan was wrapped in a towel and her figure was graceful. She coldly said, \u201cUnfilian disciple, you can continue soaking in the bathtub. Hopefully, you will sober up before you come out.\u201dShe turned around and left.She hadn\u2019t even taken two steps when her left and right feet were tangled with each other. She almost fell to the ground.An emperor-level expert who struggles to walk\u2026One could imagine how panicked she was.Li Ran leaned against the edge of the pool, tears streaming down his face. \u201cI was too careless!\u201dAfter putting in a lot of effort, he finally managed to coax his master, but she got angry again.Moreover, this time, it was not a small problem. He had completely exposed his wild intentions.\u201cSince Master wants me to reflect, then I\u2019ll just stay here and wait\u2026\u201dLi Ran decided to stay. He took the initiative to cultivate.\u2014On the other side\u2026On the carved immortal wooden bed in the bedroom, Leng Wuyan hid in the quilt like an ostrich.\u201cUnfilial disciple! You actually wanted to pounce at Master!\u201d\u201cDo you think I\u2019m that kind of casual woman?\u201dShe gnashed her teeth in hatred, but the moisture in her eyes seemed to be spreading.The honest image of Li Ran standing up appeared in front of her\u2026Pui, pui, pui, pui, pui, pui, pui, pui!Leng Wuyan wished she could erase her memories.Although her cultivation had shaken the past and surpassed the present, she had never seen such a scene.At that moment, her heart trembled.If it weren\u2019t for the last bit of rational control, the roof of the bedroom would have been lifted.Although she was conservative, she was not stubborn.She was not that opposed to the harmony of life.However, she felt that the development was a little too fast. After all, the two of them had been together for a very short time.They only went on one date, and their physical contact was limited to holding hands. How could they jump to the last step?After the humiliation, she gradually calmed down.\u201cAfter all, we\u2019re lovers. With the intimate atmosphere just now, Ran\u2019er couldn\u2019t help but think.\u201d\u201cDid I react too much just now?\u201d\u201cRan\u2019er doesn\u2019t think I hate him, does he?\u201dLeng Wuyan was a little worried about her gains and losses.She didn\u2019t look like the master of a sect. She was just a girl in love.\u201cHow about I\u2026 let Ran\u2019er come out?\u201dJust at this moment, a wave of qi came.Leng Wuyan squeezed out of the blanket and looked in the direction of the bathtub.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dLi Ran sat cross-legged in the bathtub. Golden ancient seals spread throughout his body, and the surrounding water seemed to boil.Half of the water had evaporated.She was a little stunned.Originally, he was just bored out of his mind to cultivate for a while, but as soon as his mind sank into his dantian, he started to cultivate madly.That amethyst-like figure continuously absorbed qi, the divine patterns on his body shone brighter than before.The spirit flowers in the pool instantly dried up and his qi was absorbed. In the air, a vortex was even created and qi swarmed towards him.However, the concentration of nature essence here could not catch up to the absorption speed of the Heaven Seizing Technique.Li Ran was filled with a desire for qi.Suddenly, a majestic qi surged. Without hesitation, Li Ran madly absorbed it.The source of spirit power was endless. After an unknown amount of time, the Heaven Seizing Technique finally stopped.Li Ran was about to let out a sigh of relief when he was stunned by the scene before him.The little amethyst figure in his dantian ate his Golden Core!Rather than eating, it was more like refining.The golden core, which contained boundless qi, exploded into a ball of extremely dense qi in his dantian, and then was completely absorbed by the little amethyst figure.The entire dantian glowed with golden light. The golden ancient seal was dazzling like a blazing sun!However, in the next second, the golden light suddenly disappeared, and the world fell into deathly silence.\u201cThis is?\u201dJust as Li Ran was puzzled, his qi flowed back.Instantly, it was as if he was enlightened, his body felt full, his spiritual platform shone with heavenly light and countless insights rushed into him.His perception of the world had undergone a transformation!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
