Suffering leads to death.Parting with one\u2019s desire leads to bitterness.Bitterness leads into what one does not desire,Being unable to obtain one\u2019s desires leads into Suffering. \u300dIn Buddhism, there are the Eight Sufferings; our protagonist had experienced no fewer than five of these sufferings. His whole life since birth had basically been a chronicle of tragedies. Fortunately, it was a short chronicle, because he only lived to the age of twenty-eight before facing his mortality.Perhaps his life ought to have ended at that point. However, at that moment, fate conceived a single turning point.Nie Yan turned over. A feeling of wetness arose from his back as his clothing clung closely to his skin. It was an uncomfortable sensation. He vaguely recalled having been shot in the back and collapsing onto the ground. His blood flowed out, seeping into the earth.Isn\u2019t it just death? He lay there calmly where he collapsed. To silently pass away like this... Couldn\u2019t this also be considered a peaceful death of sorts?He had lain in ambush for five whole days at the gates of the Cao Xu Mansion. There, he waited with great anticipation for his target to emerge. In the moment when Cao Xu nearly disappeared into his vehicle, Nie Yan pulled the trigger. Employing his sniper rifle, he delivered a bullet straight through Cao Xu\u2019s skull.\u300cBang!\u300dBlood dyed the ground. Gazing through the scope from a distance, he noticed a hole in Cao Xu\u2019s head with blood flowing out smoothly.Cao Xu\u2019s eyes stared vacantly before finally becoming blank as the light in them gradually faded away.Replaying the event in his mind, Nie Yan felt incomparable pleasure in his heart as he recalled the scene of the bullet piercing through Cao Xu\u2019s head. Naturally, it was because he had been unburdened of his hatred.Cao Xu possessed a lifetime of glory and splendor, yet he died at the hands of a nobody like Nie Yan. Even if he became a ghost, Nie Yan wouldn\u2019t be too particularly bitter. In the face of death, everyone was at an equal standing. Even if he had the wealth to rival nations, it still hadn\u2019t been able to save his life.Cao Xu had committed too many evils... It would be hard for him to escape retribution in the afterlife.Best n0vel 0nline free at \u24dd(0\u24e5)\u24d4\u24db\u24d1\u24d8\u24ddAt the same moment when Cao Xu\u2019s brains were blown out, Nie Yan came to a realization. His perspective on life underwent a complete transformation. S o everything in life could be determined by no more than a single shot of a sniper rifle. Perhaps tomorrow his picture would appear plastered on the front page of the morning newspaper. The headline would read \u201cMillionaire Cao Xu Assassinated!\u201d Below, a giant mug shot would lay on the page for the common people to revere and worship.Immediately after Nie Yan had assassinated Cao Xu, Cao Xu\u2019s personal bodyguards discovered his location and went in pursuit. They shot at Nie Yan, and a single bullet managed to hit him in the back.He felt a burst of sharp pain. So this is how it feels to get shot... His heart gradually grew colder as his life force rapidly escaped his body.Am I about to die? he thought, and let out a faint laugh. He laughed at the bitter shortness of life. He laughed at his life of confusion and hesitation. Only when he was about to die did he finally awaken to reality.Shortly after this realization, tears began to streak down his cheeks.The deep animosity he felt towards his parents had already ceased to exist. The events of the past were now replaying within his mind as if they were some kind of film. The only thing he longed for now in his fading time on this Earth was her faint, unblemished smile.She was Nie Yan\u2019s fellow classmate in high school. By now, she had already been engaged to someone else, yet her elegant and refined complexion remained engraved in Nie Yan\u2019s mind; the same as it was in the past. Following the passage of time, her image became all the more unforgettable. He wondered... When she receives the news of my death, of how I took Cao Xu out with me, how will she react? Will she sigh? Or perhaps... will she shed tears in grief?The old memories of the past seemed to breach through their constraints and began flooding in. They were now drifting and floating within his mind. He was quite regretful. Sometimes, when you finally realize or understand the truth of something... it is already too late to do anything about it. In this lifetime he truly had too many regrets, too many unfulfilled desires...Nie Yan reached out to grab at the empty air, wishing to grasp onto something... However, to his dismay, everything had gradually gone out of his reach. Alas, his life had finally reached its limit\u2014up ahead lay only an eternally silent abyss.Remorse and dismay resembled a dagger as it incessantly sliced at his heart; the pain in his chest was unbearable.What wrongs have I committed in my past life for the Heavens to torment and punish me in such a way!?Nie Yan\u2019s grievances soared to the Heavens. He was bitter. He screamed resentfully in his mind as teardrops continually tumbled down his cheeks.The moment seemed to last forever, and Nie Yan was actually completely unaware of how much time had passed. Eventually, his mind calmed down and gradually became serene.His mind was still active as he pondered away... Could it be...? Is this death? Perhaps, I\u2019m in spirit form now?For a long time Nie Yan felt sensations in his fingers, moreover, it felt real. Why, after all this time, why am I still conscious? He immediately sat up. Surveying his surroundings, he stared out blankly, at a complete loss.Could it be...? Is this the underworld?Nie Yan\u2019s dull eyes gradually began to regain their focus. As he looked around, a few old things entered his vision: a wooden bed, a chair, and a visibly damaged floor.Where is this place? Didn\u2019t I already die?He felt as if he were in a dream\u2014having a sort of illusory sensation. He began feeling his back; his entire hand felt wet and sticky. However, as he moved his hand into view, he saw that his palm wasn\u2019t covered in blood but rather sweat. The wet sensation he felt earlier was due to the clothing on his back having been soaked wet in his own perspiration.What\u2019s going on?Didn\u2019t I lose a lot of blood? He vaguely recalled his blood being red. It was just like red wine, except with a scarlet tint; it was the colour of his life gradually fading away.Nie Yan still felt pain after pinching himself. This really isn\u2019t a dream. Don\u2019t tell me... assassinating Cao Xu was a dream as well?Why did it feel so real?It was just as Zhuang Zhuo muttered as he awoke from a dream, \u201cAm I Zhuang Zhuo who dreamt I was a butterfly, or a butterfly who dreamt it was Zhang Zhuo?\u201dHow do I determine what is real, and what is a dream?He surveyed his surroundings with a hint of doubt. There were just too many questions left unanswered.Within the dim lighting, there was a shabby-looking wooden bed, chair, and desk. By the wall, there stood the grandfather clock his old man loved to exaggerate as a priceless antique.\u300cTick Tock Tick Tock\u300dThe sound it produced echoed into the silence. Nie Yan recalled that the clock\u2019s time had never been accurate, not even once.It was as if his past memories were stored in an old photo album, they slowly began opening up.This room here feels so familiar. Isn\u2019t this the house I lived in when I was in high school?Through the gap in the window curtains, sunlight shone in. He felt a stinging sensation as the sunlight entered his eyes, causing his pupils to violently contract. This was a type of dazzling awakening into reality.I\u2019m still alive... Nie Yan stretched his right hand forward. He gazed at its tenderness and slight immaturity before noticing the sickly pale skin tone.I... What\u2019s going on here? Am I myself from ten years in the past, or am I myself from ten years in the future? Nie Yan scratched his hair in great bewilderment.Aligning his train of thought, a few fragments from his memories began emerging. Gradually, they became clearer and distinct.This was the year he turned eighteen. It was summer vacation and his parents weren\u2019t home. He had developed a forty degree fever that summer and nearly died... Only through luck did he manage to keep his life.During that time, his parents had left him with a bit of money\u2014immediately afterward, they took off without a word of goodbye. They never returned home, not even after two or three months, and he wasn\u2019t able to reach them through their cellphones either. It was as if they had just vanished without a trace. At that time, he believed his parents didn\u2019t want him anymore. He was alarmed... terrified... scared. All kinds of emotions began to plague and burden him. In addition to this, he had also developed that high fever. The experience left a deep trauma within his heart. He became timid, cowering at the slightest breeze. It took him until the age of twenty-five to begin correcting that personality to some extent.Only afterwards, when he grew up, did he find out that his parents hadn\u2019t abandoned him on purpose. Rather, they had borrowed money from a family friend and started up a smuggling businesses at the country\u2019s borders. At that time, the country urgently needed a type of metal called polonium; it proved to be an important strategic resource. Following every nation\u2019s discovery of this metal\u2019s usage, they rapidly began placing restrictions on its export and started hoarding the resource for themselves. It was unknown how Nie Yan\u2019s parents were able to find such a source. Although, in the end, they managed to smuggle the metal back into the country, selling it to the government at several hundred times the price they purchased it for. As a result, they earned a huge sum of money.Their current circumstances at the time were very stressful and nerve-racking. Thus, Nie Yan\u2019s parents were unable to contact him through the phone. Furthermore, their matters were classified military secrets. If any information were to leak out, it would result in their deaths. As a consequence, Nie Yan and his parents\u2019 misunderstanding became buried in such a way. It took many years after the matter had passed for his father to inform him of the truth, and only then did Nie Yan forgive the both of them.It was that year when his father had earned his first major payout and used it to establish a smelting company. Furthermore, he undertook and completed several large projects, advancing the company\u2019s reputation by leaps and bounds. He resolved his family\u2019s plight, and as a result, Nie Yan was transferred over to a high-class school within the city.Is it possible? Have I really returned to that time?I can start all over again from the beginning?Nie Yan\u2019s current emotional state was hard to describe; pleasant surprise and nervous apprehension interweaved with each other as his emotions swayed all over the place. He was anxious that everything occurring now was simply a dream.Nie Yan climbed out of his bed and opened the window curtains. Rays of sunlight were scalding as they released their scorching heat onto his skin. The sensation clearly informed him that at present, he truly wasn\u2019t dreaming.He bent his head down to see that beside the windowsill lay his textbooks, arranged neatly on the table: mechanical theory, automation, language, advanced mathematics, A.I design, and so on...Nie Yan flipped open a few pages. The familiar characters were like a clear stream. Along with his past memories, they rejuvenated his mind. These textbooks represented the youth that had passed by. After reaching his senior year of high school, he transferred to a high-class inner-city school. The projects that his father had undertaken succeeded. From then on, any materialistic desires he had were easily satisfied. His rise into becoming a well-off son of an entrepreneur caused him to turn lazy and idle. By the time he had graduated high school, his academic marks were definitely less than stellar. Afterwards, his father spent quite a bit of money to allow him to attend a famous university. Only... by the time he graduated from university, he had learned absolutely nothing; he wasted every day sitting around idly.When he reached the age of twenty-five, his father\u2019s business started suffering from the attacks of the Cao Xu Century Financial Group. Several family friends who were also trusted confidants were bribed by Cao Xu into betraying Nie Yan\u2019s father. Thus, his company met with several setbacks in quick succession... Money, once more, had become a concern for the family. His father committed suicide by overdosing on drugs, and his mother fell ill due to the grief. She eventually passed away in the end as well. Only after suffering the pain of losing both his parents did Nie Yan begin making progress in his studies\u2014self-studying in numerous courses. However, by that time it was already too late. He had simply missed too many opportunities.Once full of longing, Nie Yan was prepared to hew out a piece of the world for himself. However, how could Cao Xu allow the son of his former enemy to make a comeback? With Cao Xu interfering behind the scenes, there wasn\u2019t a single company who dared to hire him, leaving Nie Yan with nowhere to go. If it weren\u2019t for him playing the Virtual Reality game Conviction\u2014scraping by with what little income he could earn by selling items, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to even eat a meal.He had no hopes of gloriously defeating Cao Xu by rising to prominence as an underdog. However, an anxious hare could still give a nasty bite. Being at an impasse, Nie Yan\u2019s final decision was to take Cao Xu out with him. The sound of the gunshot vented out all of Nie Yan\u2019s resentments and loathing.His destiny seemed bright and clear, so Cao Xu probably never thought his life would conclude in such a way.Nie Yan believed himself to have died and never expected Time to play a joke on him, returning him to the summer vacation of his second year in high school.And though he still wasn\u2019t able to contact his parents, he could at least be certain they were still alive. When he thought of this, tears began filling his eyes.When a son wanted to provide for his parents yet the parents were already gone... No other person was capable of understanding the bitterness and grief in Nie Yan\u2019s heart.The Heavens had given him another chance. He would absolutely never become confused and act indecisively again.It would take a little over twenty days for his mother and father to return home. Since it was summer vacation right now, at the moment, he had no choice but to stay at home.That year... in the second-half of the semester during my second year of high school, if I recall correctly, the Virtual Reality game, Conviction, had just recently been released. Nie Yan distinctly remembered the scene of countless financial firms establishing a presence in Conviction\u2019s rapidly rising popularity on the year of the game\u2019s release. They poured tremendous amounts of resources into the large-scale development of this Virtual Reality game. It was truly due to these numerous financial firms that Conviction deservedly became the second world for humanity.After he entered the high-class inner city school, he was finally introduced to the game by his best friend, by that time a semester had already passed. Only by then, many people were already at a very high level. He had already missed the best period of time to begin leveling. Left behind, he had no choice but to try and catch up with all his might.The faded pages of the photo album\u2014his memory\u2014once again turned anew, revealing their bright colours. The most unforgettable moments in his life had come from the time he\u2019d spent in the game. He had come to know so many friends in that game. In the calendar of his life, it was only because of them that those days of loneliness had not appeared too excessively senseless.Prior to assassinating Cao Xu, Nie Yan was formerly a Level 180+ Great Thief. Though he wasn\u2019t at the summit, he could barely be considered to be among the top experts.Nie Yan suddenly recalled there was a bank card containing all of his savings in the drawer.I have the money to buy a Virtual Reality helmet! Nie Yan thought to himself. Pulling open the drawer, he turned everything over, searching. At last, he found a silver-white bank card from the corner of the drawer. If he recalled correctly, the amount of money stored inside his bank account was two thousand credits; one credit the equivalent of one dollar. This money had come from him saving expenses on food and clothes over the course of several years. Back then, he wanted to buy the most advanced Model X3 computer. However, by the time he waited the several years needed to save up the money, the Model X3 had already become obsolete. Naturally, his pocket money was not merely this little after his father\u2019s business had become successful. Due to his father wanting to make it up to Nie Yan, he gave Nie Yan practically everything he asked for. Something he wanted...? If it could be bought, it would arrive.Nie Yan was eighteen years old this year. However, he possessed the soul of his twenty-eight-year-old self. Everything would once again start anew. From henceforth, a new chapter in his life would open up. However, without the sufficient capital, he wouldn\u2019t be able to accomplish anything. So, he would start from the game. Using his prior experiences of the game, becoming a professional gamer and earning a little bit of money was a very simple affair.Nie Yan remembered the time when Conviction\u2019s first gaming helmets had just begun selling. In an effort to make them spread, the prices were unusually cheap. There were three entry models: Model A, B, and C. Each entry model\u2019s configurations were unique. The immersion level of the Virtual Reality helmets ranged from 76%\u201398%. A sum of a thousand three hundred credits was enough to afford the cheapest model. With the current amount of money Nie Yan had stored in his savings, it was sufficient for him to purchase the lowest tier model Virtual Reality helmet.He could clearly and distinctly recall many items and things from the game. If he started all over again, it wouldn\u2019t be too difficult for him to procure some results.Placing his bank card within his pocket, he shifted his gazed towards the advanced mathematics textbook on the side. As if God himself had just slightly nudged the textbook up, it trembled a little bit before a crisp new hundred dollar bill emerged and fell out. At that moment, he recalled several things as memories once again began floating into his mind.He suddenly remembered that the first meeting between him and Xie Yao would occur today. He had taken the hundred dollar bill and left the house to buy medicine at the pharmacy.Xie Yao was his deskmate during his senior year of high school, as well as the prettiest girl in his class. Once again, he reminisced on this past event, a segment of his life that he couldn\u2019t bear to look at without causing his wrists to tremble. After nearly a decade had passed, Xie Yao and the publically recognized gifted student in his class, Liu Rui, had fallen in love; the two of them had moved together to the Moon. Only after he and Xie Yao communicated through several calls did he find out Xie Yao was not the least bit happy. When matters relating to the past in his senior year of high school were brought up, both of them would sigh incessantly.If he had just been a little bit more courageous... if only he wasn\u2019t so gutless and inferior in front of Xie Yao. Perhaps, he wouldn\u2019t have missed his chance...Sometimes... there were decisions that lasted for an entire lifetime; they would become regrets that one would never be able to resolve.At the time, Xie Yao always liked wearing a white skirt. Pure and beautiful, her appearance remained engraved deeply in Nie Yan\u2019s heart. This sort of melancholic yearning was just like the sound of a flute playing in the evening, tranquil and far away in the distance...Nie Yan glimpsed at the shabby-looking clock, the hands pointing to three o\u2019clock. There still might be enough time! He picked up the hundred dollar bill, rushed down the stairs out, and out the door.His family lived in a suburban district. It was extremely bleak. A shabby street that wasn\u2019t at all wide, and as the wind blew over, it picked up a lot of dust. Contrary to what one might expect, many trees were seeded on either side of the street. Under the blazing hot sunlight, they remained lush and flourishing, casting shade on the earth below them...Greeted with a hot afternoon, no pedestrians could be seen walking by. Cars were also few and far between... Occasionally, one or two hover cars would drive by...In the past, Nie Yan had loathed this town very much. However, after his reincarnation, as he once again met with this bleak place, Nie Yan did not feel loathing or disgust. To the contrary, he unexpectedly felt an amiable familiarity. This was the place he lived in when he was eighteen years old.Before Nie Yan reached the age of twenty-five he was timid and weak; it was not unrelated to the living environment of the former years of his life. He was just a little boy from a small town whose family suddenly became wealthy, and because of this, he was transferred over to a high-class city school. Originally during his first and second year of high school, his academics could actually be regarded as pretty exceptional. However, by the end, it was the complete inverse. He was also frequently ridiculed for wearing tacky clothing. In addition to the events that occurred during that hot summer, it caused him to have a very low self-esteem and left behind many psychological insecurities. By the time he moved to a new environment, he had already become insecure and timid, seemingly never fitting in with everything and everyone. If he hadn\u2019t come to know several good friends, it would be hard to say he wouldn\u2019t have suffered a mental breakdown.However, this was in the past. Presently, never did he expect that after going through an entire lifetime, he would return to where it all started. This time, he promised to himself that he would never repeat the mistakes of his previous self again.He sprinted off towards the pharmacy.The surrounding buildings looked somewhat shabby, there were no signs of human life... Following the increasing speed of the urbanization process, the people of this small town would migrate towards the dense crowds of large cities. And the area within this small town\u2019s borders would become increasingly desolate as the population became fewer and fewer. After a hundred years, this area would become demolished and once more change into an open field...Over here is the school, and on the other side is the supermarket... Like an old horse that knew the way, Nie Yan gazed at the surrounding buildings with familiarity. His frame of mind gradually became more optimistic. I\u2019ve gone back! I\u2019ve truly gone back!In the past, he had always held a lot resentment towards his unjust fate. However, now he was grateful towards the Heavens.I\u2019m going to start all over again! I\u2019ll do it right this time! Nie Yan was tempted to scream these words at the top of his lungs, venting out all of the indescribable emotions he had held within his heart.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2 - To Meet Once AgainPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 2 \u2013 To Meet Once AgainNie Yan increasingly neared the pharmacy. However, as he was crossing the road, as if by some supernatural occurrence, he tripped and fell hard onto the pavement.When one reaches the peak of happiness, sorrow is soon to strike.\u300cSsssss...ah.\u300dNie Yan hissed in pain. His hands felt numb from breaking the fall, and his knee was bleeding from scraping off the pavement.Nie Yan sat up with great difficulty; his knee had been badly cut open, exposing raw flesh and blood.At that time, a pink hovercar happened to be passing through the area. It halted, not far from where Nie Yan had fallen. The hovercar was of top quality, truly a rare sight in this peaceful little town. It appeared to be a limited edition hovercar, valued around ninety million dollars\u2014something an ordinary family certainly couldn\u2019t afford.A young lady in a white skirt appeared, stepping out after the car door was opened. Urgently, she ran over to where Nie Yan had fallen.\u201cFellow student, are you alright?\u201d A clear and pleasant voice appeared to be deeply concerned as it passed through Nie Yan\u2019s ears.Hearing this voice so familiar to his heart, his soul began to tremble. He turned his head to look; if the person appearing before his eyes wasn\u2019t Xie Yao, then who else could it be?She was wearing a white dress dotted with pink lace. Her hair was tied behind her back as her clear and charming eyes gazed on with concern. Her cheeks, appearing still somewhat childish, were brimming with youth and life. She was still as beautiful as ever.Nie Yan absentmindedly recalled the high school reunion that had occurred six years after his graduation. At that time, Xie Yao had become a successful businesswoman. She had worn a beautiful and enchanting OL dress.Time was indeed a wondrous thing\u2014changing a pure and innocent young girl into a charming and beautiful woman... and at present, once again changing her back.After a whole lifetime, I\u2019ve met you again... Perhaps this is fate, our destinies rewinding like magnetic tape, placing us two once again at where we first encountered. Melodious music slowly began playing in his soul; every single note so pleasant and beautiful to listen to.Nie Yan still kept the memories of the day he and Xie Yao had first come across each other; it had mirrored this exact scene. His eyes were moist, Xie Yao... I haven\u2019t seen you in such a long time. Are you still doing fine? In this lifetime, I\u2019ll never let you go again...\u201cAh! Your knee is badly scraped, and it\u2019s bleeding badly!\u201d Xie Yao called out in alarm. After recalling that the first aid kit in her car still had a few bandages, she quickly ran back to retrieve them.Nie Yan watched as Xie Yao returned to her vehicle. During his senior year, what he loved to do the most was follow her elegant little figure with his eyes. Glancing at her seductive figure, her knee length skirt revealed snow-white skin that resembled exquisite jade. On that topic, Nie Yan\u2019s appearance also couldn\u2019t be considered too bad. Following his father\u2019s success, his financial circumstances had also become pretty good; he wasn\u2019t the least bit inferior to Xie Yao. However, when facing her, he could never rouse up enough courage to interact with her.His state of mind during senior year was odd and hard to fathom. Looking back as an adult, he felt he truly was too immature at the time.Xie Yao grabbed the bandages and walked over to Nie Yan\u2019s side. She then began disinfecting the wound with antiseptics. Moving with extreme care, she picked off the tiny bits of gravel with her delicate fingers.\u201cHow can you cry? You\u2019re already a grown boy. How could a little wound like this cause you to tear up? It\u2019s not a very good appearance, you know!~\u201d Xie Yao smiled teasingly while using her thumb to massage Nie Yan\u2019s bruised knee.When she smiled, the corners of her mouth exposed her slight dimples, revealing a type of indescribably bright charm.\u201cWhen I fell, there was just a little dust that got into my eyes.\u201d Nie Yan\u2019s cheeks became a little red as he absentmindedly replied with an excuse. The real reason he had cried wasn\u2019t due to the injury on his knee in the slightest. It was Xie Yao\u2019s appearance which caused him to feel as if boiling hot water had been poured over his head. His state of mind was in a chaotic mess: an overwhelming amount of bitterness and joy mixed together wanted to surge out of him.Xie Yao\u2019s attention was singlemindedly focused on Nie Yan\u2019s bruised knee.Nie Yan raised his head and gazed at Xie Yao\u2019s face as she leaned in towards him. Her skin, like flawless white jade, was tender and supple. A strand of black hair hung down as he gazed at the beautiful earrings that hung from her earlobes.In the past when he and Xie Yao were deskmates, he always liked to secretly peek at her during class time. Though no matter how much he looked, he felt he could never look enough.Xie Yao was without a doubt the prettiest girl in their class; however, other classes had very pretty girls too. Nie Yan, on the other hand, firmly believed Xie Yao was the most beautiful girl in the entire school.After their first encounter, Nie Yan had never forgotten her. Later on, when he entered his senior year of high school, he was surprised to discover the both of them were in the same class. Not only that... but they were also deskmates as well. He came to believe this occurrence was predestined. It wasn\u2019t until ten years later that he came to understand... even if two people were fated to be together, if one didn\u2019t properly seize their opportunity, they would miss their chance. By the time he became aware of this, it was already too late.\u201cHow could you come here all by yourself!? This is a really dangerous area where a lot of criminals operate!\u201d Nie Yan said in a genuinely concerned tone. It truly was an area occupied by many criminal organizations. An especially dangerous place for a beautiful young girl like Xie Yao to be alone.\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate me! I\u2019m a third level black belt in taekwondo! After I turn twenty-one, I\u2019ll be able to advance onto the fourth level. If you don\u2019t believe me, then let me show you!\u201d Xie Yao took up an open stance, then suddenly halted as her face turned dizzily red. She stalled and said, \u201cActually, nevermind... I\u2019m wearing a skirt today, but I really am super strong!\u201d Xie Yao said innocently without the slightest trace of scheming.Nie Yan replied with a laugh, and after chatting with Xie Yao for a while, he confirmed that this young lady in front of him was indeed Xie Yao\u2014the girl who was so sincere, lovable, lively, and carefree. Yet after graduating university and meeting up once again, that sort of lively innocence soon became something he could never see again. It turns out going through a stressful period of time would indefinitely change anyone...Xie Yao began sizing Nie Yan up a bit. Compared to herself, he seemed to be younger than her by a few years. His height was also roughly the same as hers, appearing to be only around a hundred seventy centimeters. The clothes he wore were a little dirty, possibly from falling over just now. Appearance wise\u2014although he couldn\u2019t be regarded as handsome\u2014he was passable. Only, she didn\u2019t seem to know why, but she felt an indescribable sort of familiarity and closeness towards Nie Yan. Unknowingly, they ended up chatting for quite a while.\u201cWhat school are you from? From your appearance... it looks as though you should be studying in middle school, right?\u201d Xia Yao felt Nie Yan was a little bit foolish and empty-headed, so silly it was slightly adorable. Not minding the ground while he was running, many boys from middle school are foolish like this. They become a lot more mature by the time they reach high school though.Although Nie Yan was eighteen years old right now, he had the wisdom of a twenty-eight-year-old. When he met with Xie Yao once again, Nie Yan was no longer the confused, ignorant little boy he had been in the past. His spirit had been refined and tempered by the passage of time; he had become calm and collected.\u201cWho said I\u2019m in middle school? If it weren\u2019t for the country\u2019s child policy, my son would already be old enough to buy groceries himself!\u201d Nie Yan replied jokingly. As a person, one shouldn\u2019t be so deadpan and boring.\u201cYour son? Buying groceries himself? Stop joking around!\u201d Nie Yan\u2019s words had caused Xie Yao to burst out into laughter, causing her to giggle nonstop.\u201cI\u2019m eighteen.\u201d\u201cAre you really eighteen? You don\u2019t look like you\u2019re around my age,\u201d Xie Yao said in surprise.Due to being a bit malnourished, Nie Yan\u2019s present height was evidently a bit short\u2014around a hundred sixty-five centimetres tall. When his living conditions had improved later on, his height soared up to a hundred eighty centimetres by the time he had reached his senior year of high school. His current appearance still seemed that of a juvenile, and he really did look like a middle schooler. This was the reason why he had always looked a little depressed.The most unfortunate thing for him, as a twenty-eight-year-old, was unexpectedly being told he looked like a middle school student. However, he really did look baby-faced at present, so there was nothing that could be done. \u201cThis is because my face looks naturally younger compared to others.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re young, you\u2019re young. You still won\u2019t admit it?\u201d Xie Yao replied giggling. She came to feel this Nie Yan was a pretty amusing person. All the boys in her class were always either shy when they met her, never knowing what to say, or haughty delinquents that brought her disgust.The two talked for quite a while. Nie Yan appeared very comfortable when conversing with Xie Yao, occasionally teasing her with a few clever quips that made her laugh.Nie Yan gazed at Xie Yao\u2019s smiling expression that was simply beautiful. It reminded him of the time he had graduated high school. He and Xie Yao had been deskmates for a year, and he had always believed the two of them could never form any sort of connection. They were two people from completely different worlds. He continued to admire Xie Yao in secret, gifting Xie Yao whatever she asked for. However, he had never made a demand for Xie Yao to remember a lowly person such as himself. Never did he expect that after graduation he would unexpectedly receive a gift from her. Perhaps, he really had left an impression in Xie Yao\u2019s heart.What appeared in the gift was a photograph of Xie Yao as a twelve-year-old. At the time, she was still a chubby little fat girl. It was a picture that would only be shared with someone she considered herself to be close to.After graduation, Nie Yan remained incapable of forgetting Xie Yao and both of them continued to stay in touch.After being reborn, Nie Yan would never again allow himself to miss his opportunity.Having once more encountered each other, Nie Yan\u2019s state of mind fell into somewhat of a daze. In his past life, and in his current life, he and Xie Yao shared an unbreakable bond tied by fate.Her clear and limpid eyes stealthily glanced at Nie Yan\u2019s face, sizing him up. Although Nie Yan wasn\u2019t particularly handsome, even looking very ordinary at first, and despite looking very childish, he had a very indescribable calmness. Perhaps it has to do with his personality?\u201cMy name is Nie Yan (\u8042\u8a00). The Nie written with \u2018pair\u2019 (\u53cc) and \u2018ear\u2019 (\u8033), and the Yan written as \u2018word\u2019 (\u8a00) in \u2018language\u2019 (\u8a9e\u8a00),\u201d Nie Yan said while gazing at Xie Yao directly in the eyes.Xie Yao\u2019s charming face became flustered as she tried to avoid Nie Yan\u2019s gaze.\u201cI\u2019m called Xie Yao...\u201dNie Yan shifted his gaze downwards, stopping at Xie Yao\u2019s lips. They were a faint pink in colour\u2014soft with a glossy allure. The previous Nie Yan in his senior year of high school would absolutely never dare to gaze at Xie Yao\u2019s face in such a way. He had only dared to stealthily sneak glances at Xie Yao\u2019s beautiful face from the corner of his eye.\u201cMy father is still waiting for me, so I-I\u2019ll be leaving first... I felt very happy chatting with you today. But remember, you can only remove your bandage by tomorrow! You definitely can\u2019t remove it any earlier!\u201d Xie Yao didn\u2019t feel assured, so she repeatedly warned Nie Yan as she stood up.Nie Yan attempted to move his knee a bit, and noticed that he was able to do so without issue\u2014the wound was only superficial.\u201cI\u2019m alright. I can already walk again, so you should go back now. Also, thank you for today,\u201d Nie Yan replied. Despite wanting to talk with Xie Yao for a little while longer, he ended up walking back to the curb. They would be studying at the same high-class city school in the future, and he would have plenty of opportunities to get to know her then.\u201cI\u2019ll be leaving first then...\u201d\u201cBye bye,\u201d Nie Yan replied smiling, as he began strolling away. As he walked up to the pharmacy, he couldn\u2019t help but feel a little sentimental in his heart. After briefly meeting one another, they parted once again.Xie Yao sat in her hovercar and started it back up.Nie Yan turned his head and glanced back, but by that time Xie Yao\u2019s hovercar had already departed. They had met in the past like this, completely by accident. However, it didn\u2019t go as smoothly as this last time as the previous him hadn\u2019t even been able to form a single coherent word in front Xie Yao. The Xie Yao back then had wrapped up his leg with a bandage and left right after. Though it was this chance encounter, caused by his carelessness, that allowed Xie Yao to leave an inerasable mark in his heart. It was to the extent where he had never forgotten her.Reincarnating is such a wonderful thing; everything could once again start afresh. Nie Yan then came to think, his everything could very likely be snatched away by Cao Xu in a couple of years down the road. In his mind rose a strong sense of urgency... He had to become much more powerful to be able to protect everything that he held dear.Thinking about Cao Xu, Nie Yan\u2019s heart gradually grew colder. This was a loathing that penetrated deep into one\u2019s marrow\u2014to the extent where he felt not the slightest hesitation in putting a bullet through his enemy\u2019s head.However, for now, all he was currently able to do was seize his opportunity and enter Conviction as quickly as possible, to set up an early foundation in the game. Conviction was unlike any other game, naturally because it was humanity\u2019s second world. The game had transformed the entire globe. Nie Yan could obtain what he wanted by playing Conviction.At the pharmacy, he bought a few packets of cold medicine. As he swallowed it down, he immediately felt his body relax as his fever receded. At present, he felt the medicine\u2019s effects were very satisfactory.After he finished up in the pharmacy, he walked over to the department store in the area. He planned to buy a Virtual Reality helmet.Every department store had a dazzling lineup of products within. They had many kinds of appliances and devices; so many, they couldn\u2019t be counted. For the most part, they were all smart devices. There were some products Nie Yan wasn\u2019t even able to name. This place had no sales representatives; you only need swipe your card and you\u2019d be able to receive whatever you wanted to buy.Half a day had passed since Nie Yan left his house, and finally, he had reached the section where they sold Virtual Reality helmets. They were displayed one by one stacked on top of the wall. It was a feast for the eyes; there were three entry models differentiated by thousands of styles, patterns, and designs.Best n0vel 0nline free at \u24dd(0\u24e5)\u24d4\u24db\u24d1\u24d8\u24ddThe lowest price was thirteen hundred credits while the most expensive reached upwards of a million and two hundred thousand credits.The higher the price, the better the configuration. You get what you pay for, and at present Nie Yan could only afford the cheapest configuration.Besides the currently available Virtual Reality helmets, there were also limited edition ones that could be purchased only by making a reservation. Their prices reached upwards of sixty million credits.Regarding these helmets, at present, Nie Yan could only wish for them in his thoughts\u2014nothing more.Nie Yan swiped his card at the register. He had chosen a light-blue coloured helmet and furthermore bound it to his identity. Once his identity was registered to the helmet, it could only be used by him from then on.Conviction had only been released seven days ago, thus the highest leveled player was probably only level 5. So he still had plenty of time to catch up.After having been reborn, he should be able to effortlessly obliterate any opponent in his way in a grand and imposing manner. \u201cStep up to the highest peak, and all mountains below will be seen as insignificant.\u201d62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 - HagglingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 3 \u2013 HagglingNie Yan glanced back at the clock, it was already half past three. Conviction\u2019s game servers were open from five in the afternoon to nine in the morning\u2014sixteen hours total. In this way, it wouldn\u2019t be a hindrance to the common person\u2019s work schedule. Thus, everyone\u2019s game time was more or less equivalent. Hence, it made it unlikely for any single player to create a large disparity in level compared to the rest of the player-base. In addition, Conviction\u2019s Virtual Reality technology exceeded perfection. As a result, it gained increasing popularity, eventually becoming popular all over the globe. It gradually transformed into an absolute necessity in everyone\u2019s life.This was the world that had become dominated by Virtual Reality technology; it had become a perfect system. Five months later, Conviction would complete this system by connecting virtual currency with the real world economy, thus completely merging into humanity\u2019s livelihood.With such a high rate of player retention, the player-base was able to grow to a tremendous amount. It spurred the increasing consumption of Virtual Reality in the rest of the world. The amount of time the world spent playing Conviction every year was so astronomical, it was to the extent that it surpassed the amount of time they spent in reality. The emergence of numerous new consumer groups caused the creation of a great number of service industries, a vast majority of which targeted the professional gaming community.Almost every financial group had established a presence in Conviction. Following the establishment of his father\u2019s business\u2014after the company had produced decent earnings\u2014Nie Yan\u2019s father also began participating in Conviction\u2019s rising popularity. He put up a large sum of money into the game as well. Though in the end, due to suffering a crushing defeat, it resulted in the company and its assets being brought to ruin. This allowed Cao Xu the opportunity to seize even more of an advantage... Nie Yan absolutely wouldn\u2019t allow such a situation to occur again.Establishing an early presence in Conviction was essential, and it was crucial that he mustn\u2019t fail. Nie Yan needed to first help his father by paving the road ahead. Only when his father begins injecting funds into Conviction, will he be able to establish an uninterrupted chain of funding and take the first steps towards success. This would prevent any problems from arising in the future.Nie Yan made a stop and ate out for dinner, spending thirty dollars. By the time he had arrived home, it was already nearing five o\u2019clock.After putting on his helmet, he calmly waited for Conviction to boot up.Twelve minutes had passed. The helmet\u2019s display gradually illuminated, revealing the time to be [05:00 PM]. Abruptly, a lively jingle began playing, echoing through his ears. The tune felt familiar; it had been something he\u2019d heard countless times in the past. He never felt any particular attachment towards it. However, it currently felt strangely pleasant to his ears.\u300c System: Do you wish to create an account? \u300d\u201cYes!\u201d\u300c System: Please select your country. \u300dThere were three factions you could choose from when entering Conviction. The first was the righteous faction who guarded the light. This faction consisted of the Viridian (Ge-l\u00edn-lan) Empire and Satreen (Sa-te-en) Empire. The Viridian Empire was a nation ruled by humans and governed by an Elder Parliament. The Satreen Empire, on the other hand, was a nation formed from the alliance between dwarves, beastmen, and elves. The second was the evil faction who guarded the darkness; it was ruled by a tyrant who reigned over both the devils and undead. For people who didn\u2019t enjoy conflict, there was a third faction which was neutral and ruled by the irenic giant tribe.In the past, Nie Yan had chosen the Tempest Thief class of the Viridian Empire, which meant he was also quite familiar with the landscape of the empire. Furthermore, he was well acquainted with the Tempest Thief\u2019s skills and class quests. If he had chosen a different starting nation, then the superior advantage he had gained from being reborn wouldn\u2019t be worth much in the end.Nie Yan held a special type of affection for the Tempest Thief class. After all, he had dedicated nearly a decade of painstaking effort into it. The Level 180 Thief represented the height of his glory.When he considered all these factors, he selected the Tempest Thief as his class once again\u2014just as he had in the past.\u300c System: You\u2019ve chosen to start in the Viridian Empire. \u300d\u300c System: You\u2019ve selected Tempest Thief as your class. \u300d\u300c System: Please name your character. \u300d(\u6d85)Nie (\u708e)Yan\u201cNirvana Flame!\u201d Nie Yan chose the same name as he had in the past. \u201cNirvana Flame\u201d\u2014though these words were pronounced in the same way as his real name when they were spoken, they presented the meaning of a phoenix entering nirvana and being reborn.\u300c System: Successfully created character name. The character Nirvana Flame has been created. \u300dThe game automatically blurred the player\u2019s true appearance after entering. Then, the system would conduct minor alterations to the face of the player\u2019s character. Under normal circumstances, the appearance of the player\u2019s character and the player\u2019s actual appearance were vastly different. It would actually be quite difficult to recognize a player in real life. However, the actual beauty or ugliness of the character was more or less equivalent to how it would be outside the game.Nie Yan opened his status window and took a look at his own stats.These were the base stats for every type of Thief in the beginning of the game. Furthermore, at Level 0, the system gave five stat points and one mastery point.Nie Yan took a glance at his status window. When he had chosen the Tempest Thief class in the past, he had added one point in Strength, two points in Dexterity, and two points in Physique in order to make himself more durable. In turn, it caused him to have a very weak attack power and slow attack speed during the initial stages of the game, causing him to waste a lot of his time trying to level. In reality, thieves never required a lot of HP at the start of the game. In the past, when he thought about this failure and all the time he had wasted, Nie Yan couldn\u2019t help but drop his shoulders down and sigh many times, wishing he could delete and restart again. This time around, he wouldn\u2019t repeat such a disastrous mistake again.This time, he added three points into Strength and two points in Dexterity. He had concluded this was the most optimum ratio, after taking into account the leveling habits of his previous life. He took another glance at the status window after allocating all of his stat points.Attack 5 \u2192 6Hit Rate 10.0 \u2192 10.6Movement Speed 5.0 \u2192 5.4Attack Speed 5 \u2192 5.6There were also class masteries. Regarding these Thief class masteries, a majority of thieves from the Human race would choose to add their first mastery point into either Evasion, Weapon Mastery, or Cloaking. Nie Yan was also prepared to add his first mastery point into Weapon Mastery, but he stopped suddenly. After a moment of careful consideration, he decided to add his first mastery point into Marksman.Beginner Marksman \u2192 Intermediate Marksman: Rapid Reloading +3, Firing Range + 3, Attack when using crossbow/bow +3, Ignore Level +3 (Thief Class Modifier + 1),Class masteries were divided into five levels. Beginner\u2192Intermediate\u2192Advanced\u2192Expert\u2192Specialist. One could not advance further after reaching Specialist. However, there were many types of class masteries, and different class were allowed to upgrade different class maseteries.Human thieves were proficient in a variety of tools and enchanted items. Bows and crossbows belonged to this category, which is why those with Intermediate Marksman received an additional attack bonus when they were used.After assigning his stats, Nie Yan\u2019s scenery shifted and he soon appeared at the transfer point within Calore (Ka-luo-er) City. Encompassing the surroundings were rows upon rows of towering buildings. Every building in Calore City was pure white and possessed an incomparable brilliance. At the center of the city stood a white spire which towered through the skies. Not too far from the spire was an equally magnificent pure white sculpture that stood several hundred meters in height. Holding onto a Magician\u2019s sceptre, it had a solemn and dignified expression. This was, of course, the protector of the Viridian Empire, Jebiah the Great.People were arriving and departing as they moved through the main streets, which were bustling with noise and excitement.Evening in reality was actually early morning within the game. The light of daybreak enveloped and warmed the top of every building as if a blanket of silver white light had been laid over all of Calore City.Calore City was the capital of the Viridian Empire; it was a floating city that lay suspended over the Calore Prairies. From the city, numerous transfer points connected to various other cities, towns, and villages.\u201cSelling top rate White-grade dagger (Attack +2)! It\u2019s better than the novice dagger (Attack +1), and only costs two copper coins! Only three left in stock until they\u2019re all sold out!\u201d A Level 3 Arcane Mage had currently set up shop near the transfer point. Many beginners were crowding in front of his store.Every new person who enters the game receives ten coppers in their inventory as their starting capital. Even though they felt their hearts ache, many people still purchased one of these daggers for the sake of training a little bit faster in the initial stages of the game.Nie Yan snorted in disdain. On the map, the same daggers could be found in Level 1\u20135 villages being sold for only one copper. Furthermore, Level 0 players could easily walk up to a transfer point and teleport to one of these villages free of charge. They could purchase one of these daggers from an NPC, and then come back\u2014all within two or three minutes.In his previous life, he had also foolishly bought one of these daggers, only to find out he had been cheated later on.The nearby towns each had their own stores; the small town of Link had a clothing shop, Joseph Town had a hat and shoe store, and Locke Town had a shop that sold weapons. Nie Yan teleported back and forth three times through the transfer points. He spent six coppers to switch out his defenseless beginner equipment for better gear. Each piece of equipment gave him an increase in Defense. He gained 1\u20132 Defense each from equipping his new footwear, headgear, shoulder guards, and leg protectors. He also gained an additional 2\u20133 Defense from equipping cloth armour.These were all lessons he had learned from his past experiences. Taking a look at his Defense, it had now become 8\u201313. If beginner thieves at Level 2 or 3 weren\u2019t resourceful enough in keeping their equipment up with their levels, they would also have this little bit of defense.After taking a stroll around the marketplace, he discovered a Level 3 Paladin selling Thief class Stealth skill books. He was selling six books for six coppers each in his store. Many of the low-level thieves could only gaze from afar due to the price of these skill books being so expensive.The Paladin had the appearance of a man in his twenties. His stature was tall and robust. it would\u2019ve been pretty good if he had chosen to be a Warrior, but he was still passable as a Paladin.Paladins were guardians of the Temple of Light. They could learn holy skills passed down from the Temple such as certain offensive enchantments or healing skills. Furthermore, they had decent close combat skills and could provide supportive party buffs for teammates at the same time. They were a pretty balanced class in every aspect. Silencing Paladins were Paladins that could learn Silence\u2014a divine skill that could suppress Mages, Priests, and other Mage type classes.\u201cHow much for this Stealth skill book?\u201d Nie Yan asked as he bent down and picked up the skill book from the cloth mat that was spread out on the ground. The Stealth skill was an essential skill for a beginner Thief. Luckily, though, the Stealth skill book had a very high drop rate from the various monster spawn points, so it wasn\u2019t too expensive.\u201cYou\u2019ve already seen it, the price is six coppers,\u201d the Paladin replied, pursing his lips into a frown.\u201cAren\u2019t you just trying to rip people off? A Silencing Paladin like you can easily hunt down the Fallen Shamans around Link Town. You could easily farm out six skills books in a day, and still not lose any health. It\u2019s definitely much easier to make money this way compared to farming Goblins. Aren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself, selling at such a high price? Three coppers, and not a copper more.\u201d Nie Yan haggled down the price to half.Best n0vel 0nline free at \u24dd(0\u24e5)\u24d4\u24db\u24d1\u24d8\u24dd\u201cHow could it be as easy as you described? Do you even know much I spend on potions a day? If I sold it to you for three coppers, I basically wouldn\u2019t be making any money! My lowest offer is five coppers.\u201d The Paladin was shocked by Nie Yan\u2019s words and had taken quite a while to reply. He definitely wasn\u2019t the type of person who was calculating and skillful at deceiving others. At a glance, this new player in front was definitely a well-informed customer, definitely not someone to be easily fooled.\u201cThat\u2019s because the place you\u2019re farming monsters at is inefficient. If you farm the Fallen Shamans at these coordinates, 22385.21338.23329 , you can easily get at least ten skill books a day. Not only that, you won\u2019t waste a lot of money on potions as well. Three coppers, not a single copper more. If you don\u2019t want to sell, then I\u2019ll just take my leave.\u201d Nie Yan had inspected this Paladin. He had a squarish jawline with slightly grown out stubble, and his appearance didn\u2019t seem too despicable.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 - Flying StonePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 4 \u2013 Flying Stone\u201cW-wait a minute! What did you say those coordinate numbers were? Does that place truly drop many Stealth skill books?\u201d the Paladin hurriedly asked. After hearing the manner in which Nie Yan had spoken in, he somewhat began to believe this passing Thief.\u201c 22385.21338.23329 , the location is near the Fallen Shaman Camp, but it\u2019s still a fair distance away. The area should be absolutely safe. After farming for around twenty minutes, a Fallen Shaman should spawn once every five seconds. A Silencing Paladin like you can train there up until they hit Level 5. Brat, you\u2019re still too inexperienced. If this great master were to casually hand out even a little bit of game advice, you\u2019d be able to receive endless benefits!\u201d Nie Yan shamelessly boasted while patting the Paladin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHow about it? Give me another discount?\u201d\u201cFour coppers, I won\u2019t go any lower.\u201d The Paladin was still skeptical about Nie Yan\u2019s words. However, he was indeed able to obtain around six skill books a day by farming the Fallen Shamans outside of the Fallen Shaman Camp, just as Nie Yan had said. Though this Fallen Shaman Camp... he had gone there once before and nearly lost his life. The location in the coordinates Nie Yan provided should definitely lead him right outside of that same camp.Nie Yan\u2019s words completely matched this information, so it probably shouldn\u2019t be false. The Paladin muttered to himself and began pondering.... Should I head over to those coordinates and take a look myself?\u201cThree coppers, if you\u2019re not willing then I\u2019ll be taking my leave. However, if you\u2019re willing to give me this book as a gift, I\u2019ll give you some more valuable information regarding the Fallen Shaman Camp.\u201d Nie Yan gave an incentive. After seeing the Paladin still appearing hesitant, he turned his body and prepared to depart.Nie Yan was embarrassingly short on funds. He didn\u2019t have a lot of money to spend on the Stealth skill book. However, it was still essential for every Thief during the early stages of the game. This truly won\u2019t do. I\u2019ll have to put it off for later. At least until I can manage to get a bit of money grinding off Level 1 mobs in the beginning area....\u201cW-wait, hold up!\u201d Seeing Nie Yan about to leave, the Paladin hurriedly called out to him. He hastily picked up a Stealth skill book from the little shop he had set up and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it merely a single Stealth skill book...? I can easily farm out six of them in a day! Here! I\u2019ll give this to you as a present. Now tell me, what\u2019s information you have on this Fallen Shaman Camp?\u201d It just so happened that he and his companions would be setting off to train in that area shortly. Thus, he really wanted to be as informed as possible about the area. In the Paladin\u2019s eyes, Nie Yan certainly did appear to be a very knowledgeable person.Nie Yan glanced back at him. This Paladin does seem to be an honest person. I was able to secure a Stealth skill book, and I didn\u2019t even need to spend a single penny. Recalling this, Nie Yan was in a great mood.\u201cSeeing as you\u2019re being sincere. Don\u2019t head over to the coordinates I just gave you. If you really did head over there looking to train, then not even within five minutes passing, three Fallen Shaman Leaders would appear. A single cast of their Fireball would cause an explosion that would kill you instantly,\u201d Nie Yan casually informed.Upon hearing these words, the Paladin instantly broke out in a cold sweat as he felt a great chill run through his heart. When Nie Yan informed him that those coordinates were a good place to farm, he truly intended to head over there and try his luck. He never expected that not only were these coordinates false, they were also dangerous as well. If he hadn\u2019t hurriedly called Nie Yan back... one could only imagine the consequences. It would have truly been an injustice if he had been killed in such a way.Nie Yan was simply too cunning\u2014not even raising a single finger, and he entrapped someone.Originally, the Paladin still felt a bit regretful giving away the Stealth skill book. However, at present, he became incredibly overjoyed. There was basically no comparison between his life and a single Stealth skill book. Dying in the game would result in losing a level along with losing a random piece of equipment. It turns out being a kind and sincere really does have its own benefits.Noticing the Paladin gazing at him with such an aggrieved expression, Nie Yan flashed a slight smile and said, \u201cThe real coordinates are 22325.21383.23359 . You can farm out ten Stealth skill books from there. The spawn rate is pretty good too, so it\u2019s definitely a good place to train. I\u2019m not lying to you this time around. This is my way of expressing gratitude for gifting me this beginner skill book. Then, I guess this could be considered your payment? As for the Fallen Shaman Camp... naturally, it\u2019s a twenty-person instance. There\u2019s a requisite of seventy-two defense for Warriors. Regarding Paladins and Priests, the requisites are also similarly high. Paladins must have a willpower of eight and Priests are required to learn the Heal skill. The strength of their Heal must also reach thirty points. Not only this... but when entering the camp, you must bring an ample supply of health and mana potions.\u201d\u201cThe requirements are too high. Would I still be able to enter if my willpower is only seven points? The Heal skill books are also too expensive as well. The influx of new players has caused the skill book to skyrocket to an extremely expensive price. It\u2019s to the point where it has no set market value. Our party consists of only one Priest, and the reason we want to enter the Fallen Shaman Camp is because we need to obtain the Heal skill book for him. So tell me... if we don\u2019t meet these requirements, can we still enter the Fallen Shaman Camp?\u201d the Paladin asked.\u201cEntering is definitely possible. However, you\u2019ll need to use a special method to enter.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of special method?\u201d the Paladin asked curiously.Nie Yan smiled wordlessly. In the future, he would most likely enter the Fallen Shaman Camp as well. If others wanted him to inform them about this special method, then they must be willing to pay a sufficient price.\u201cAll party quests are divided into five difficulties: Easy, Normal, Hard, Expert, and Specialist. If you guys are unsure of yourselves, then you should select the Easy difficulty. Speaking of which, it really shouldn\u2019t be too difficult. If you guys don\u2019t meet the requirements, then you simply need to just keep upgrading, that\u2019s all.\u201d Nie Yan looked at him meaningfully. He can\u2019t possibly think that a single Stealth skill book would allow him to candidly obtain the special method for entering the Fallen Shaman Camp, could he?Although Nie Yan was only Level 0, he still gave off the appearance of a professional. The Paladin began weighing his thoughts and in the end, he still trusted Nie Yan\u2019s words.\u201cThank you,\u201d the Paladin sincerely expressed his gratitude.Nie Yan couldn\u2019t help smiling. The person before him was forced to give him a skill book free of charge, and he still thanked him in the end\u2014this was truly adorable. In his previous life, Nie Yan was also such a sincere type of person. Only after experiencing many difficulties and setbacks, he slowly became cunning and sly. Although he felt this Paladin was very stupid, Nie Yan had a good impression of him. While tossing the skill book in his hands, he muttered, \u201cWe each take what we need.\u201dJust as Nie Yan turned around and started to leave, the Paladin called out to him, \u201cExpert, what\u2019s your name? Why don\u2019t we add each other as friends? That way, if I ever meet up with a problem I can\u2019t solve, I\u2019ll still be able to ask you for advice.\u201d\u201cSure, but it\u2019ll cost you. I\u2019m not one who offers a free service,\u201d Nie Yan replied. He definitely didn\u2019t want to give out information for free.\u201cThat\u2019s not a problem,\u201d the Paladin replied straightforwardly.\u201cAlright then, my name is Nirvana Flame.\u201d If this person was able to give a sufficient price, Nie Yan felt there would be no harm in sharing some information. He\u2019ll just consider it earning a bit of extra income.\u201cMy name is Flying Stone, though all my friends just call me Stone,\u201d the Paladin named Stone replied. He had already considered Nie Yan to be one of his friends.\u201cThat\u2019s fine. I have a few matters to attend to. So, I\u2019ll be leaving first. See you later!\u201d Nie Yan said his goodbyes to Stone and walked over to the transfer point. He wanted to learn the Stealth skill quickly. A Thief\u2019s defense and health were too low when compared to other close combat professions. In the initial stages of the game, he would only be able to train on the weak mobs that were the same level as him. Not only that, but he could only fight them one on one too. If he were to face a more powerful mob or perhaps... two or more monsters, then his only option would be to flee for his life. Thieves were unlike Warriors, who possessed the ability to fight two monsters of the same level. if the Warrior had decent equipment, then they\u2019d be able to face off against three or more monsters. Therefore, unless a Thief was training in a party, their leveling from beginning to end was much slower when compared to Warriors, Mages, and other similar professions.Currently, the highest level player among them was Level 5, while the highest level Thief was only Level 4.At the start, thieves must continuously make money in order to buy skill books. Only after getting plenty of skills would their strengths finally begin to emerge\u2014which would additionally cause their training speed to gradually increase.At present, Nie Yan had gained the first ability in his skill bar, Stealth.Stealth was the bread and butter skill for all thieves\u2014their most basic and most powerful skill.Nie Yan transferred over to Tellak (te-la-ke) town. This was one of the most ordinary towns within the Calore Prairies\u2014it was an NPC settlement. The houses were made of clay and mud, which exuded prairie-like characteristics. There were many Level 2 players in the area. Hence, the place was bustling with movements.The monsters surrounding these small settlements ranged from Level 1\u201310.There were Level 2\u20133 players everywhere in small towns. They were either trading goods or looking to form parties to hunt monsters. The streets were filled with noise and excitement. When walking down the streets, one could easily feel a bit claustrophobic.If he recalled correctly, there was a silver treasure chest near the Wildcat region of Tellak town. In his previous life, he had discovered it while farming monsters in that region. He had obtained a high-quality Thief skill book from the chest. However, it was an area that contained Level 5 monsters. Fortunately, no one should have reached that location yet.Best n0vel 0nline free at \u24dd(0\u24e5)\u24d4\u24db\u24d1\u24d8\u24ddWhen teams formed parties to level, players would usually split into groups of three or four. Otherwise, the experience definitely wouldn\u2019t be worth it. If ten or more were to form a party to hunt, then the experience gained would be too minuscule after being split. In general, three to five people in a party were able to train in an area where Level 5 monsters spawned, however, this was also rarely seen.Treasure chests were graded from White Treasure Chests, Silver Treasure Chests, Gold Treasure Chests, Dark Gold Treasure Chests, Legendary Treasure Chests, etc... The higher ranked the treasure chest, the better the items that would come out of it. The items inside the chests were set, so once they were removed, the chest would disappear.Although he was only Level 0, after obtaining the Stealth skill, Nie Yan had come up with a few ideas on how to obtain that silver treasure chest.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 - Vital StrikePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 5 \u2013 Vital StrikeTowns contained only the most rudimentary of buildings: general stores, low-level equipment shops, personal storages, etc... Even NPCs were sparse in number, and these NPCs were quest givers. For the most part, these simple quests consisted of gathering and collecting various items, hunting and killing an animal to collect its fur, collecting herbs, ores, and so on. After completing these quests, one would be rewarded with either money or experience.After arriving at the general store, Nie Yan went forward and bought three Basic Health Potions. One potion would restore upwards of thirty health, and each potion was priced at a single copper. General stores only offered Basic Health Potions. Middle- or higher-tiered potions could only be purchased from an Alchemist.Following the purchase of his three potions, only a single copper remained in Nie Yan\u2019s pockets.Nie Yan walked outside and went out of the town\u2019s boundaries. After leaving the town, he hurriedly rushed over to the treasure chest\u2019s spawn point. If he met a monster, he would make a detour around it and maintain his distance.The place he was heading towards was a Level 5 monster area. At present, with his current level, the danger was very high. However, with his experience currently at Level 0: 0.00%, even if he died, he wouldn\u2019t lose any experience.Nie Yan passed through two Level 1 monster zones, a Level 3 monster zone, and a Level 4 monster zone. After four minutes, Nie Yan had finally arrived at the monster zone where Level 5 Wildcats spawned.After surveying the surrounding area, he saw dense pastures and lush grass that could reach up to one\u2019s waist. Gazing at a distant area in the dense pastures, he saw a tall willow rising above the vegetation. It appeared to be especially lofty and majestic as it occupied its own space within the pasture.The silver treasure chest wasn\u2019t far from this location. Nie Yan\u2019s heart began to tense up with nervousness as he grew closer.At his current level, the Level 5 Wildcats in this area weren\u2019t monsters that Nie Yan was capable of dealing with.Occasionally one or two Wildcats would pass through the area, and Nie Yan would hurriedly conceal himself.Thieves possessed a passive profession skill which raised their ability to conceal themselves. Once they went into hiding, it wouldn\u2019t be easy for other lifeforms to detect them.At the same time, he was still able to use his Stealth skill.Nie Yan began calculating the level difference formula for Stealth in his head. After activating Stealth, the safe distance between him and a Wildcat should be about two meters. In other words, if he went within two meters of a Wildcat while he was in stealth, he would be discovered. Between two and three meters was the buffer zone where he could possibly be discovered. Beyond three meters he was at an absolutely safe distance.Having spent over a decade playing the Thief profession in his previous life, Nie Yan\u2019s usage of these Thief skills had long been tempered to perfection. In addition, using his vision to estimate distance also wasn\u2019t too hard of a feat.Suddenly, the underbrush in the distance began to tremble and stir with movement. Nie Yan\u2019s complexion rapidly changed as he quickly went into hiding by activating Stealth.A Wildcat that was as large as a German Shepherd pounced out of the thickets. Its sharp eyes surveyed the surroundings, but it didn\u2019t discover anything strange. As it passed through the open space that lay ahead, it entered into another patch of grass and disappeared.Only when he was assured the Wildcat had gone far away did Nie Yan dare to continue moving forward.There was a stretch of open space in a ten-meter radius around the willow. A silver white chest quietly lay at the base of the willow tree. The nearby area had six to seven Wildcats roaming around freely.To clear out these Level 5 Wildcats would require a team of at least twenty Level 3 players.It would not be easy getting ahold of this chest.Nie Yan observed the movements of these Wildcats within the thickets of grass, as he attempted to find a safe route to the willow tree.Their movements appeared to have a fixed pattern.After observing for a while, Nie Yan removed all the equipment from his body and stored them in his inventory. He then re-equipped his defenseless beginner equipment. If his beginner equipment were to be sold to an NPC store, they wouldn\u2019t be worth even a single copper. Simply put, they were trash. Even if one were to throw them on the ground, no one would bother picking them up.Dying in Conviction would result in the loss of a level. Additionally, a random piece of equipment would also be dropped upon death. If the new equipment he had just recently bought dropped unexpectedly, then that would truly be wasteful. However, if the beginner equipment dropped, he wouldn\u2019t care. He was only equipping it to temporarily to cover his body anyway.While using his Stealth skill, Nie Yan slowly crept towards the willow tree. He walked for approximately ten seconds, before suddenly stopping and holding his breath. A Wildcat was making its way around Nie Yan\u2019s left flank\u2014within approximately two meters.After waiting for six seconds, Nie Yan pressed onwards once again\u2014carefully exercising control over his distance between each Wildcat.Gradually, the distance between him and the chest shortened.Nie Yan\u2019s heart rate sped up once again. He understood that as a Level 0, if he succeeded in grabbing this skill book, then it would be immensely helpful in the future.Two wildcats began moving towards Nie Yan\u2019s location.Nie Yan quickly halted, but the wildcats continued their advance. Fortunately, the distance between them was still about two meters apart. Nie Yan was frightened badly as he felt a cold sweat run down his back.Stealth had a total duration of two minutes, and time was ticking away. Knowing that Stealth\u2019s effects would end within thirty-two seconds, Nie Yan\u2019s state of mind began to fluctuate.There\u2019s not enough time...! Nie Yan slightly accelerated his pace.Not far from where Nie Yan was located, a Wildcat moved slightly. It became aware of Nie Yan\u2019s location almost immediately. After locking its eyes onto Nie Yan, the Wildcat exposed its sharp teeth and let out a hoarse growl.Best n0vel 0nline free at \u24dd(0\u24e5)\u24d4\u24db\u24d1\u24d8\u24ddNot good, I was discovered!The Wildcat moved, pouncing towards Nie Yan.The Wildcat\u2019s sudden attack was quick, and Nie Yan\u2019s movement speed meant that he was basically incapable of keeping up. However, Nie Yan still managed to sidestep out of the way of the Wildcat\u2019s attack by relying on his reaction speed\u2014something he had developed during his past life.The basic movements for a character were sidestepping, rolling, jumping, etc... Players were able to utilize these movements to dodge attacks\u2014as long as it was within the capabilities of the system.The sharp claws of the Wildcat swiped through empty air, missing Nie Yan\u2019s throat by just an inch.Just as Nie Yan had dodged, two more Wildcats appeared and pounced at him from the sides. One of them clawed at him from the back, while the other bit into his arm.****, I\u2019m finished!Under these circumstances, using health potions would be useless.\u221268\u221232Two damage values floated over Nie Yan\u2019s head. He collapsed to the ground as his health fell to zero.The scenery changed, and Nie Yan found himself resurrected at the cemetery in Tellak town.His failure was a result of using Stealth too early. When Stealth\u2019s duration was nearly up, he had become impatient and mistakes were made. This was the root cause that led him to failure.Nie Yan summed up all the causes of his failure and continued forward. As he glanced at the equipment on his body, he noticed that his armguards had been dropped. However, it was only a piece of beginner equipment. Even if it dropped, it wouldn\u2019t be too alarming. As for losing experience... it didn\u2019t matter because he was still at Level 0: 0.00%.He had already created a plan in case he ended up dying, which was why he dared to venture into an area with Level 5 monsters.Nie Yan set off once more. After he had left the boundaries of Tellak town, he went back over to where the Wildcats spawned.Once again, Nie Yan arrived at that open space. He soon discovered slight changes in the movement paths of the Wildcats. He had led the Wildcats near the chest before he died, and they continued to remain close by where he fell. Obtaining the silver treasure chest had just become a much more difficult task.The Wildcats were constantly roaming about in the area. Nie Yan began studying their movement again. He could possibly brave death by drawing these Wildcats away. Then, he could resurrect, use Stealth to easily slip the past, and get to the chest afterward.He ended Stealth prematurely. Gradually, his figure emerged about three meters away from the Wildcats.Five Wildcats in the surrounding area simultaneously discovered him and began their pursuit.Nie Yan made a mad dash away from the area, but his movement speed was slow compared to the Wildcats. Soon, they quickly caught up with him. One Wildcat pounced forward, causing Nie Yan to fall to the ground. The other Wildcats soon encircled him and went in for the kill.After a flash of white light, Nie Yan once again resurrected at the cemetery in Tellak town. This time, his leg guard had dropped.He once more set out of the town, rushing back to plunder the treasure after resurrecting. With the passage of ten minutes, Nie Yan had once again reached the open clearing.The Wildcats were now some distance farther from the treasure chest. As he calculated their movements in his head, Nie Yan\u2019s eyes lit up. There shouldn\u2019t be any problems this time around.Nie Yan activated Stealth and approached the silver treasure chest. He advanced for more than twenty seconds, before stopping in place after noticing two Wildcats coming up from behind. They came close to Nie Yan\u2019s location, before gradually walking away.All the Wildcats in the area were rather far away from Nie Yan\u2014at about a distance of approximately five meters. When he confirmed that he was finally safe, Nie Yan accelerated his pace and quickly arrived at the silver chest. Stealth still had a remaining duration of thirty-six seconds\u2014six seconds more than he had initially anticipated.Nie Yan crouched down to open the chest while still in stealth\u2014opening the chest would not cancel the skill.\u300c System: Opening chest... Estimated Completion: 20%... 50%... \u300dA Wildcat in the vicinity walked towards Nie Yan. It neared a little over two meters before eventually stopping.Nie Yan\u2019s pulse unconsciously sped up. Calm... must remain calm... He had to constantly console himself in his head before his pulse finally calmed down.The Wildcat glanced around for a short while, but eventually turned around and left after not detecting anything.Nie Yan\u2019s body eased up and he let out a sigh of relief.\u300c System: Chest successfully opened! Time taken: 27.0 s \u300dNie Yan opened the chest and began feeling around inside. When his hand came into contact with a book, his heart abruptly jumped. This is it!Taking the book out, he looked it over.Skill Book: Vital Strike|Description: Thieves can cause additional damage by attacking an enemy\u2019s vitals.Requirements: Action (requires weapon)Properties: Hitting a target\u2019s vitals causes 5% additional damage, marking the target with a damage debuff.Cooldown: 30 secondsRestriction: Thief, Warrior, Paladin, can be learned by any faction.Indeed this was the Vital Strike skill book. This was the best skill he was capable of learning at Level 0! This was what he had worked so hard to obtain. After Nie Yan grabbed the book, it became a ray of white light.Glancing at his skill bar, he noticed that another skill had appeared: Vital Strike!Following Nie Yan\u2019s removal of the Vital Strike skill book, the silver chest began to gradually fade away before disappearing without a trace.It\u2019s all settled! Heh... I can return to town for free too.As Stealth\u2019s duration ended, Nie Yan\u2019s figure slowly emerged. The few Wildcats in the area immediately discovered him and attacked.Nie Yan didn\u2019t have any experience to lose, so he was planning on dying and resurrecting in the town to avoid having to run back. Nie Yan peacefully awaited his fate.Once again, Nie Yan died and returned to the town cemetery. This time, his novice gloves dropped. However, compared to the Vital Strike skill book, the loss was negligible. By obtaining Vital Strike, his training speed would increase greatly.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6 - Making PreparationsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 6 \u2013 Making PreparationsNie Yan wanted to proceed forward with the second step of his training plan. However, he required twenty coppers in order to do so!Earning money while simultaneously training at a high speed, this is the only way to be efficient. Nie Yan thought for a moment, then began running deeper into Tellak town.Coordinates: (309.289.221) Tellak Town, NPC: Hunter KlausQuest: Collect 50 Giant Silverdust Rat SkullsCoordinates: (290.231.256) NPC: Farmer EndeQuest: Kill 50 Giant Silverdust Rats.Coordinates: (350.220.389) Tellak Town Outskirts, Hidden NPC: Alchemist OerQuest: Collect 21 Giant Silverdust Rat tailsNie Yan found two common NPCs and three hidden NPCs that handed out quests related to killing Giant Silverdust Rats. The coordinates for the hidden NPCs were provided in a strategy guide from his previous life. Countless players had come to experience great difficulty in finding these hidden NPCs because they were unaware of these coordinates.After he had received five quests, Nie Yan ran out of Tellak town and began heading towards the area where Giant Silverdust Rats spawned. Giant Silverdust Rats were a species of immensely large rodents that possessed a silver ashen gray coat. Their builds slightly exceeded that of a water buffalo\u2019s, and they appeared similar to small moving hills when they roamed about. However, their movements were quite sluggish, and their attack wasn\u2019t all that high.Giant Silverdust Rats: Level 1Health: 100/100The game\u2019s servers had already been up and running for a little over a week, and the vast majority of players have already reached Level 2 or 3. Hence, many of them had already moved on to hunt in higher-leveled regions. As such, only a sparse few players were still training in this Level 1 area.Nie Yan moved quickly after discovering a Giant Silverdust Rat. He attacked, leaving several stab marks on its back.\u221221\u221220\u221221Three damage values appeared, floating above the Giant Silverdust Rat\u2019s head.Best n0vel 0nline free at \u24dd(0\u24e5)\u24d4\u24db\u24d1\u24d8\u24ddThe Giant Silverdust Rat retaliated by turning its head to attack Nie Yan. Before it could, though, Nie Yan activated Vital Strike and stabbed the Giant Silverdust Rat in the eye.\u300c System: Vital Strike successful! Attack +5%, resulting in additional damage dealt! \u300d\u221238Another damage value floated over the Giant Silverdust Rat\u2019s head. The giant dust rat let out a miserable squeak and immediately fell to the ground.Not bad, Vital Strike is pretty decent. Nie Yan collected the Giant Rat Skull that had been dropped as loot.Vital Strike\u2019s cooldown was thirty seconds, giving Nie Yan just enough time to seek out another Giant Silverdust Rat.After finding an area where Giant Silverdust Rats spawned rather quickly, Nie Yan began to idly grind monsters. Numerous Giant Silverdust Rats were constantly defeated and fell to the ground.Nie Yan\u2019s experience bar gradually rose. 1%, 2%, 10%... after about two hours, Nie Yan had slain a little over two hundred Giant Silverdust Rats. He continued until his experience bar finally reached 15%.Giant Rat Tails, Giant Rat Skulls, etc... All these items were gathered in a large heap. Furthermore, he had also obtained three coppers total as loot drops.The drop rate for money was extremely low. Only under certain circumstances would the drop rate be higher. This was in order to make Conviction\u2019s in-game currency much more valuable.As Nie Yan\u2019s Vital Strike slew yet another giant rat, something appeared flickering under its corpse. Nie Yan\u2019s heart skipped a beat. Quickly, he bent over to pick up the item.Tough Leather Leg Protectors (White Equipment)Requirement: Level 0Properties: Defense 3\u20135Weight: 3lbUser Restriction: Warrior, can be equipped by any faction.Equipment drops in Conviction were quite rare. Only in a few relatively higher instances would the drop rate be increased. However, the level of difficulty for such instances would also be much higher. Nie Yan remembered very clearly in the past there were many players Level 10 or higher who had no choice but to equip Level 5 equipment. Simply because they couldn\u2019t find Level 10 equipment, they had to form parties and hunt monsters with lower level gear.Since this Tough Leather Leg Protector is meant for Warriors, it\u2019ll sell for at least seven coppers if I throw it into the auction house.He stored the Tough Leather Leg Protector into his inventory; a beginner bag had only twenty slots. Nie Yan filled his bag with so many items, there now were only eleven slots remaining.Inside the beginner bag was a dimensional space. Items stored inside this space wouldn\u2019t raise a player\u2019s weight value.A player\u2019s weight value was only affected by the player\u2019s equipment.With the three coppers that had previously dropped, and by selling off the Tough Leather Leg Protector... my funds should be brought up to ten coppers. Turning in these quests should also give me a few rewards... I ought to have a little over twenty coppers by then.Nie Yan glanced over at his bag space. The five quests he had accepted were all completed. So he started heading back to Tellak Town, as he no longer needed to hunt the Giant Silverdust Rats.Nie Yan was doing his utmost to catch up. First, he would bridge the level gap between him and the other players. Then he would use his past life\u2019s experience to progressively expand his superiority in the game.After returning to Tellak town, Nie Yan handed over all five quests, completing his missions. He obtained six hundred experience, which raised his experience bar to 55%. Furthermore, he had also received thirty-four coppers\u2014an amount which exceeded his expectations. The money and experience awarded by those three hidden NPCs were several times higher than what ordinary NPCs would\u2019ve rewarded. Besides the money and experience, he also received three Basic Health Potions.Nie Yan put the Tough Leather Leg Protector in the auction house and walked towards the weapon shop.Upon arriving outside of the place, he saw a small narrow shop front. However, after entering, the interior space was actually quite large\u2014roughly five by ten meters.Weapons for every class could be seen lined up on both the left and right sides of the wall. Common equipment for all classes could also be seen hanging from the rear wall of the shop: bows, crossbows, small daggers, etc...The store filled to the brim with equipment was a dazzling display for the eyes.The weapon shop\u2019s owner was a fierce looking blacksmith, appearing to be in his forties.\u201cThe weapons I forge are the best within the whole region of the Western Prairies! Respected adventurers, may I ask what you require?\u201d Seeing business arrive, the blacksmith came up to greet him in a lively straightforward tone.\u201cBow, or crossbow.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see... what kind of bow or crossbow are you looking for? The equipment I have here can meet all the requirements of adventures who are Level 5 or lower.\u201d\u201cLevel 0, one that I can use. Attack +3 or more, and Firing Rate of 12 or more.\u201d Nie Yan thought for a moment, and added, \u201cThe price should be within thirty coppers.\u201dNie Yan originally thought collecting twenty coppers would be sufficient to purchase an ordinary bow or crossbow. He didn\u2019t expect that he would exceed his target goal, and earn thirty-seven coppers. After the Tough Leather Leg Protector sold, his funds would surpass forty coppers. He had a complete abundance of money to splurge on a better bow or crossbow.\u201cI have three pieces of equipment that meet your criteria. The first is a short bow. Attack +3, Firing Rate is 13, Attack Deviation of 11%, and a Range of 20 meters. The price is seven copper coins.\u201d The Blacksmith took out a short bow, and presented it to Nie Yan.\u201cDo you have anything better? Perhaps something with a higher accuracy?\u201dHe had a task he wanted to complete. And though the short bow would suffice, having something better would save him time.\u201cWell, I also have this long bow. It has Attack +5, Firing Rate of 12, Deviation of 9%, and Range of 30 meters. The price is fifteen coppers.\u201d The Blacksmith took out a long bow and presented it. Afterward, he took out an exquisite one-handed crossbow. He loaded it with five bolts, then propped it up with his arm and aimed it around the shop. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t please you, then this is my finest piece of work, the one I\u2019m most proud of. A compact crossbow with a triple-shot effect, Attack +5, Firing Rate of 8. Furthermore, as a result of its supplementary firing ability, the Firing Rate of a single shot is tested at 15. It has a deviation of 5%, and a range 30 meters. The price is twenty-eight coppers.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take it. Give me nine low-grade crossbow bolt quivers as well,\u201d Nie Yan said. Each quiver contained a thousand low-grade crossbow bolts; it was definitely enough.Nie Yan spent thirty-seven coppers to complete the transaction, leaving him without a single copper remaining. He stored the crossbow and nine quivers he had recently purchased into his bag space.\u201cFeel free to come again respected adventurer. I wish you a safe journey.\u201dIn his past life, when Nie Yan had first entered the game, he believed the NPCs only possessed simple AI. He amazed at what he discovered. Afterward, he was able to keep his calm much more easily.As Nie Yan left the weapon shop, a system notification appeared.\u300c System: Your Tough Leather Leg Protector has been sold for eight coppers. \u300dAh, it finally sold... not bad. I now have eight coppers as my total funds. At least I won\u2019t be considered too poor right now.Nie Yan left the boundaries of Tellak town and hurried over towards the Level 8 Bison spawn area. The Bison monsters were even more dangerous than the Wildcats. They had extremely powerful attacks, and their movement speeds were also much faster than the Wildcats. In fact, they were more than three times faster than Nie Yan with his current stats. When facing against these Bisons, there was essentially only death and no chance of survival.Currently, there was not a single player whatsoever who dared to face off against a Level 8 monster. Even if they were currently the highest level player in the game, they still wouldn\u2019t dare.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As far as the eye could see, lofty and oddly shaped boulders were irregularly strewn throughout the area. Within this mess of boulders were narrow cracks and passageways.It should be right here. Nie Yan surveyed the expanse for a moment. After confirming without a doubt that these were the correct coordinates, he became especially vigilant and began slowly sneaking around. This region was where Bisons actively roamed about. The whole area permeated with a sense of dread and danger. Cautiously, he squeezed himself into one of the narrow passageways within the boulders.Coordinates (567.528.192)The topography of this region was strange and eccentric. The narrow passageways within these boulders only allowed enough space for a single person to pass through. As he looked out after going through the narrow passageway, a dark-coloured Bison in an area at a distance of about twenty-six meters away entered his vision. Large and robust, its entire body was densely packed with muscle. Above its head, two sharp horns resembling the tips of daggers protruded out.Bison Chief (Leader): Level 8Health: 300/300Nie Yan took out his crossbow and held it with his left hand. He began calibrating it, making sure the angle was just right.By lucky coincidence, the Bison Chief was within his attack range. Due to its body size being so massive, even if it were to discover his presence, it was still unable to traverse the narrow passageways within the mess of boulders. As a result, it was completely incapable of attacking him.This was a typical terrain exploit!This was an exploit his Arcane Mage friend had discovered within the game. However, at present, the only one who was aware of this terrain exploit was him!By employing this exploit, Nie Yan could bypass the level disparity and effortlessly kill this Bison Chief!Nie Yan began loading the crossbow with bolts. After three seconds, three crossbow bolts were completely loaded and the crossbow was cocked and ready to fire.\u300cWsh! Wsh! Wsh!\u300dThree bolts were fired in rapid succession, flying in a straight line right towards the Bison Chief.\u300cPut! Put! Put!\u300dThe three crossbow bolts hit the Bison Chief nearly simultaneously.Miss\u22121MissThree damage values floated above the Bison Chief\u2019s head. Due to the level disparity between both sides being too large, Nie Yan\u2019s attacks against the Bison Chief were weak. Most of the time it would be a miss and even if it did hit the target, it would only cause a little bit of damage.After it had been attacked, the Bison Chief huffed out a large amount of musty air and began its mad charge towards Nie Yan\u2019s location.\u300cBoom!\u300dA large crashing sound burst out. The Bison Chief had charged into the boulders and was repelled back. Its attack was unable to reach Nie Yan. It could only turn around and circle the boulders, without having any other course of action.Best n0vel 0nline free at \u24dd(0\u24e5)\u24d4\u24db\u24d1\u24d8\u24ddNie Yan skillfully finished reloading the crossbow and like before, shot out three bolts in rapid succession towards the Bison Chief.Although the damage was extremely low, under Nie Yan\u2019s continuous and unrelenting attacks the Bison Chief\u2019s health bar began showing signs of declining ever so slightly. However, it was awfully slow, merely falling by the smallest amount. Every now and then, it even recovered by a slight fraction.Nie Yan\u2019s rate of fire was quite stable. After suffering his attacks, the Bison Chief bellowed out furiously, precisely because it was incapable of even nearing Nie Yan.Everything went as smoothly as expected. Nie Yan was attacking the Bison Chief while figuring out the next step in his leveling strategy. After being reborn, if he were like others trying to find a place to level, it would truly be an asinine waste of his time.One must know, Nie Yan\u2019s mind possessed a vast amount of game knowledge. He followed his own reasoning and designed a perfect leveling plan.The seconds and minutes continued to pass by. After half an hour, Nie Yan had completely used up all of the crossbow bolts within one quiver\u2014a thousand crossbow bolts! At present, the Bison Chief still had approximately two-thirds of its health remaining.The uninterrupted process of reloading and shooting made Nie Yan feel himself about to fall asleep. However, he still spent great effort in maintaining his high frequency of firing, so as to avoid having the Bison Chief\u2019s health recover again after he ceased his attacks.The Bison Chief began getting somewhat weary. It continually strained for breath as it anxiously rammed against the rocks and collapsed a portion of the boulders.Nie Yan quickly retreated inward a bit and at that moment, his menu sounded out with a voice call notification.\u201cExpert, I went to the coordinates you gave us for farming monsters. It is indeed very fast! I\u2019ve already picked up two Stealth skill books from today alone!\u201d Flying Stone said. At the location where Nie Yan told him to train, leveling was fifty percent more efficient compared to the common training areas. This had made Flying Stone really excited. Gifting Nie Yan a single Stealth Skill book had given him such a treasure trove of a training area\u2014it was definitely a worthwhile trade!\u201cThat\u2019s natural of course. Fallen Shamans also drop the Owl Sight skill book. If you find any extra, don\u2019t forget to send me one.\u201d Nie Yan wasn\u2019t the least bit surprised. He had gone through numerous expert strategy guides in his previous life. Small tidbits like these\u2014the amount he remembered was definitely not few in number. In his life, Nie Yan was the type of person who was thick-skinned and furthermore very forgetful. There was an awful amount of things he would go through life forgetting or completely neglecting. However, the only things he remembered the most distinctly were definitely these game strategy guides.Every person had an exceptional memory when dealing with the things they were particularly interested in.\u201cIf the skill book drops, I\u2019ll send it to you through the mail. There\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wondering about, how did you find out about this training spot?\u201d Stone asked through the chat. When he had met Nie Yan, the latter had been nothing more than a Level 0.\u201cI used to play on a Warrior account, however, I deleted it to create a Thief.\u201d Nie Yan casually gave out an excuse without thinking. Naturally, he didn\u2019t want anyone to know the secret was that he had been reincarnated.\u201cSo it was like that... Your Warrior account must have been really high leveled, huh. Why\u2019d you end up deleting it? In a few days, one of my friends wants to form a group to enter the Fallen Shaman Camp. Expert, what are your thoughts on this?\u201d Stone asked expectantly in his message. Nie Yan certainly did appear to be a person who was very knowledgeable. Furthermore, his several friends were indeed only able to fight to the Fallen Shaman Camp\u2019s outer area and couldn\u2019t advance any farther.The Fallen Shaman Camp is a high difficulty instance. Instances are divided into special instances and basic instances. When a special instance is cleared by players, it disappears and becomes an ordinary area. As for basic instances, if they were cleared by players, they can still be repeatedly entered afterward. However, the equipment drop rate is much lower and the profits earned weren\u2019t that high either.The Fallen Shaman Camp is classified as a basic instance. It\u2019s divided into five difficulties: Easy, Normal, Hard, Expert, Specialist. The higher the difficulty, the better the equipment that would drop. If a party were to clear this instance, they would have to wait five days until they could enter and clear it again.\u201cA full walkthrough on how to clear the Fallen Shaman Camp will cost you two silvers, no bargaining,\u201d Nie Yan replied. Two silvers were the equivalent of two hundred coppers. Towards new players, this was definitely an extravagant sum of money. However, since Stone\u2019s friends were able to form a team to clear the Fallen Shaman Camp, two silvers shouldn\u2019t be regarded as much.\u201cI\u2019ll go back and discuss it with my friend.\u201d Stone was a little skeptical. He couldn\u2019t possibly have a complete Fallen Shaman Camp walkthrough, right? Such a thing doesn\u2019t even exist online.On an average run, profits from clearing the easy difficulty of the Fallen Shaman Camp should be about three silvers. If their luck were good, they might be able to obtain one or two high-quality drops with decent stats. Though the drop everyone wanted the most from the Fallen Shaman Camp was still the Heal skill book. Nie Yan demanding a two-silver information fee could be regarded as beyond excessive. If no equipment dropped, then they would\u2019ve paid Nie Yan for nothing.The difficulty of the Fallen Shaman Camp was a little high. After their party gets wiped out a few times, they\u2019ll naturally realize the fee Nie Yan had commissioned wasn\u2019t the least bit expensive at all.\u201cReply to me after your friend agrees. If he doesn\u2019t agree, don\u2019t bother me unless you have business.\u201d Nie Yan continued shooting at his target. Under his constant rain of fire, the Bison Chief gradually began showing indications of falling.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go and talk with our party leader.\u201d There was basically an equal sign connecting Nie Yan to the title of an expert. He wasn\u2019t slightest bit offended in regards to Nie Yan\u2019s cold attitude. Experts who have this kind of personality were also pretty common. Stone was wondering, What level did Nirvana Flame\u2019s previous warrior account reach? It ought to have been really powerful, but why did he end up deleting it? Could it have possibly been related to a matter that was difficult to discuss?Flying Stone finished speaking.\u300cDoot! Doot! Doot! ...\u300dA busy signal came from the voice chat.Nie Yan hung up and accelerated the firing rate of the crossbow in his hand. One after another, bolts rapidly left the crossbow.Firing for one and a half hours, he had consumed around thirty-six hundred crossbow bolts.\u300cMooo!\u300dAt long last, the Bison Chief let out a final agonizing cry before staggering to the ground. The massive body smashed heavily towards the earth, and Nie Yan could even feel the vibrations under his feet.Nie Yan estimated a bit: if he had used the short bow, killing the Bison Chief would have taken at least five hours in addition to consuming over ten thousand arrows. Fortunately, this single-handed crossbow with its additional skill saved him quite a bit of time.Two white lights shone upon Nie Yan\u2019s body as two clear and melodious tunes sounded out\u2014each one represented a single level up.\u300c System: You\u2019ve successfully slain a Bison Chief. +1800% experience for killing a monster above your level. You have received 8290 experience points. \u300dNie Yan glanced at his experience bar, he had reached Level 2 with 21% of his experience bar already filled. The experience gained from killing the Bison Chief was definitely enormous.After finally completing his task, Nie Yan put away the crossbow in his hand and walked over towards the Bison Chief\u2019s corpse. Searching under the Bison Chief\u2019s dead body, he found that it dropped five coppers. In addition, he also managed to pick up a dagger.Nie Yan glanced at the dagger\u2019s stats.Horn Dagger: BronzeProperties: UnidentifiedNie Yan\u2019s eyelids jumped up in excitement. It was a Bronze-grade dagger! Equipment was divided in these grades: White, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Dark Gold, and Legendary. Occasionally there would also be green-coloured sets. Only equipment at Bronze Grade or above had additional properties.The monsters within Conviction were classified into these classes: Leaders, Sub Elites, Elites, and Lords. These monsters were uncommon and very few in number as well as spawning infrequently. Equipment with additional properties only had a one in one thousand chance of dropping. The majority of players could only make do by wearing white-grade equipment. Due to this, equipment with additional properties were all fairly precious, and their prices would skyrocket to the extent that they were unbearable for ordinary players.Bronze grade weapons normally had an additional 20% attack above that of ordinary weapons. Furthermore, they also came with additional properties.The equipment that a Level 8 Bison Chief drops should be Level 5. At present, the price of a Level 5 bronze grade dagger is at least three silvers or higher. Furthermore, an average Level 3 player\u2019s total assets, for the most part, was only about twenty coppers. If one had assets valued at the level of silvers, they were definitely a very well-off person.According to his plans, he gathered the Bison Chief\u2019s drops and stored away the bronze grade dagger into his bag space. Nie Yan retreated from the narrow passageways within the boulders and headed back towards Tellak town.Tellak town\u2019s only appraiser was a short-statured white-bearded old man with narrow triangular eyes. He was very shrewd, making everyone who saw him feel very unnerved. However, he was the only appraiser in all of Tellak town.Nie Yan opened the trading window.\u201cYoungster, do you need me to appraise any items?\u201d the short old man asked.\u201cA dagger.\u201d Nie Yan put up the Horn Dagger into the appraisal window.\u201cThe appraisal fee is ten coppers. Do you still wish for an appraisal?\u201dNie Yan\u2019s heart skipped a beat. This Horn Dagger\u2019s appraisal fee was ten coppers. Typically, the appraisal fee for an item was five percent of the item\u2019s price, and this was only the NPC\u2019s price for the item. The market price was frequently more than six times higher than that. In other words, this Horn dagger had a value of at least twelve silvers!He thought for a moment. In the next few days, I won\u2019t be needing to go anywhere that requires a lot of money. Spending ten coppers also won\u2019t be that troublesome. He pressed confirm.The Horn Dagger blossomed with a cyan radiance; its brilliance was definitely not understated. This radiance was a distinctive characteristic of bronze grade equipment.The Horn Dagger\u2019s handle was cambered with the texture of wood, with an awfully sharp blade in the front. It was much thicker compared to ordinary daggers and possessed the unique characteristic of being shaped like a bull\u2019s horn.Horn Dagger (Bronze)Requirement: Level 5Properties: Attack 16\u201319, Strength +5Attack Speed: 2.3Weight: 1 lbUser Restriction: Thief, can be equipped by any faction.This Horn Dagger gave a bonus to his Strength stat. These five points in Strength were equivalent to five points of attack. Then add onto the fact that the dagger\u2019s base attack was already higher than an ordinary Level 5 dagger\u2019s by three or four points, it meant this Horn Dagger was better than an ordinary dagger by nearly ten points. The influence of these ten points of attack, speaking from a new player\u2019s perspective, was indeed very large.Looks like I\u2019ve picked up a reliable Level 5 dagger, Nie Yan thought.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 - The Price of UnderestimationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 8 \u2013 The Price of UnderestimationAfter finishing the appraisal of the dagger, Nie Yan had begun to walk outside. Lowering his head, he took a glance at his skill bar. There were only two skills there: Stealth, and Vital Strike.A perfect Thief should have numerous skills piled up at their disposal. A Thief could make do without equipment; however, they absolutely could not do without skills.Of the several areas where Thief skill books could be farmed in the beginning stages of the game, Nie Yan knew all of them like the back of his hand. However, he would be unlikely to take the great effort and pain of farming them out. If a skill book could be farmed out, then it could also easily be bought in the marketplace.Hmm... were there any other places where I could find rare beginner skill books?Best n0vel 0nline free at \u24dd(0\u24e5)\u24d4\u24db\u24d1\u24d8\u24ddNie Yan smacked his forehead. How did I manage to forget that?With regards to classes such as a Thieves, if they wanted to possess sustainable fighting strength they would often select either Alchemy Crafting or the Bandage skill. Alchemy Crafting allowed a player to manufacture every kind of health potion, drug, etc... In the middle of a battle, a health potion\u2014that could instantly restore lost health\u2014was tantamount to a second life for a player. Afterwards when a battle was over, drinking a recovery potion allowed a player to quickly restore their health and throw themselves back into combat again. Thus, accelerating their training speed as well. As for the Bandaging skill, in comparison to a health potion, it was a bit lacking\u2014the common Bandage skill could not be used during a skirmish.Nie Yan knew of a location where a rare skill, Combat Medic, could be learned. Unlike Bandage, it could be used while in combat.At higher levels, if a person wished to purchase middle- or higher-tiered health or recovery potions from the marketplace, their expenditure would be quite large. After all, their prices were quite costly\u2014for most players, health and recovery potions were items they could only acquire by digging through the gaps between their teeth. Unless one were rich, the average player wouldn\u2019t be seen commonly using health, or recovery, potions.However, Nie Yan was different\u2014his head was filled with many ways to earn money quickly and easily. He didn\u2019t need to worry about money. Later on, health and recovery potions were all things he could easily buy from the marketplace. Thus, it wasn\u2019t necessary for him to waste his time learning Alchemy Crafting. However, if he learned this Combat Medic skill, it would greatly enhance his survivability. Thinking to this, Nie Yan suddenly had an idea.I\u2019ll put that off for later. I should learn the Combat Medic skill first.Nie Yan spent two coppers and bought two Basic Underwater Breathing Pills from the NPC general store. Right after, he rushed towards Lake Rando which wasn\u2019t too far of a distance from Tellak town.After passing through several Level 2\u20133 areas, he had met many players that had formed parties to hunt monsters. They often occupied a single region in their own area. Warriors, Paladins, etc... all these close-combat classes worked to draw monsters. Right afterwards, the Mage would unleash an unceasing barrage of spells towards these monsters. Some parties would even bring their own Priest. Most Priests didn\u2019t currently have the Heal skill\u2014their ability to deal damage wasn\u2019t as good as Mages either. For the most part, they were dirty experience leeches. Despite this, every team still looked for a Priest as if they were a hot commodity. This was because if a team wanted to have any growth or development in the future, they absolutely needed to have a good relationship with their Priest. Lacking a Priest was the same as lacking an endless supply of health potions.As for Thieves, in the early stages of the game, many Thieves would be easily dumped by their team. However, Thieves were quite famous for their solo training speed. As long as they purchased all of the necessary skills they required, a Thief\u2019s training speed would not be inferior to a Mage\u2019s in any aspect. So, it wouldn\u2019t be much of a loss if they couldn\u2019t join a team.Level training in the various monster spawn areas was awfully monotonous and boring. However, these players could still chat with each other. Thus, the time would pass quite quickly when they chatted on idly.Nie Yan carefully passed through these areas where players were training because a lot of struggles would occur between players for certain training spots. If a player killed other players, they would receive a penalty with their names marked red. They would be barred from entering city walls as well. Having their names marked red meant other players could kill them without fear of recourse. Their loss of levels upon death would be even harsher, and every single piece of equipment would drop as well. Though, if that player killed monsters for a certain period of time, the red marking on their name would eventually disappear. Despite this, many players would still frequently take this risk for the sake of stealing another player\u2019s equipment. Not hesitating in the slightest, they would kill others for their equipment, regardless of having their name marked red. In order to do this safely, they would often target strangers in the wilderness far away from any city, Thus, one must be very cautious when travelling alone.Lake Rando... this area was inhabited by Fishmen monsters. According to rumours, these Fishmen were the descendants of the ancient Wicked Naga. After countless generations, they finally developed into their current form. They possessed the body of a fish, and four limbs just like a human. The weapons they employed for attacks were their sharp teeth and the tridents they held in their hands.Fishmen were Level 3 monsters that heavily populated the area with their massive numbers. Furthermore, there was even a Fishmen village within the vicinity. It was necessary for Nie Yan to pass through the borders of the village to enter Lake Rando. Afterwards, he would need to swim through the lake to arrive at his destination.Situated by the lakeside of Lake Rando was the Fishmen village with its several hundred wooden huts scattered sporadically by the sandy edges of the lakeshore. This Fishmen village contained at least three hundred or so Fishmen, several tens of Fishmen Leaders, and two Elite Fishmen. If one wanted to clear this area, they\u2019d need at least a thousand players or more.Just as Nie Yan was preparing to activate Stealth to bypass the Fishmen village, a system announcement rang out.Local Announcement: The Guild, Victorious Return, is planning to clear this location in three minutes. All players within the vicinity of the Fishmen Village, please depart immediately.Victorious Return? Nie Yan raised his eyebrow. In his previous life, he and the guild Victorious Return had a few run-ins and festivities together... Victorious Return\u2019s people ran rampant and acted arrogantly. They\u2019d clear the path and kill everyone in it whenever they wanted to. A long time ago, one of Nie Yan\u2019s brothers killed three members from Victorious Return because he was discontent from the guild forcing him out of a training area. A bit of a grudge was pillared down with those from the Victorious Return, and all of the guilds went chasing after him. They threatened to have his brother slaughtered back to Level 0. Nie Yan\u2019s and the others\u2019 strength was still pretty weak back then, thus he could only hide deep within the ravines in the mountain range. He continued to level up and trained like a madman for over a month. Only when he felt his level had reached high enough did he dare to come out. Even then, he was still barely able to defend himself. In the end, he never dared to have a direct open confrontation with a big guild like Victorious Return.The feeling of powerlessness back then... don\u2019t even bring it up.In this life, that sort of history absolutely won\u2019t repeat itself. This debt would definitely be one that I\u2019ll have repaid in full. However, it won\u2019t be today, for now...Nie Yan had just entered the game for less than a day. He still needed to gradually accumulate his wealth bit by bit.Immediately, he turned and ran towards the lakeside.As he looked ahead of him, he saw the clear waters merging with the reflection of the azure sky. The lake gleamed and sparkled as the sun\u2019s rays illuminated the top of the crystalline clear waters.Victorious Return\u2019s players had mobilized intensely and were surveying the area. There were many areas in the vicinity where one could discover the movements of Victorious Return\u2019s people. They definitely did not come with few numbers. It appeared that they were preparing to begin their operation on the Fishmen village.The Fishmen village wasn\u2019t an instance, but rather a spawning ground for monsters to congregate. These types of places would also frequently drop decent items.Nie Yan passed through a small grove of trees, arriving at about two hundred meters away from the lakeside.Suddenly, a ball of fire streaked through the sky, launching towards Nie Yan\u2019s location.As the ball of fire flashed, Nie Yan\u2019s line of sight shifted past the grove of trees. His eyes fell upon the body of an Elementalist wearing a red robe. The opposing player was a Level 3 Elementalist from Victorious Return!Mages were divided into three types of classes: Elementalists, Arcane Mages, and Holy Mages. Elementalists had the ability to control ice, fire, and lightning\u2014their power was the elements. Arcane Mages were able to control arcane might and finally, there were the Holy Mages. They were the least selected class. Their skills were the most difficult to train in, but their power was definitely the strongest. They could cast and unleash the power of divine spells.The killing power of fire spells was the highest among the spells at an Elementalist\u2019s disposal.By the time Nie Yan had noticed the fireball, it was already too late.\u300cBoom!\u300dThe fireball exploded on Nie Yan\u2019s body. It tore through Nie Yan\u2019s health, as his health bar plummeted by twenty-two points.\u300c System: The opposing player Violet Flame has attacked you. You are free to retaliate in legitimate self-defense. Time: 3 minutes. \u300dWhen coming across a Mage, you either run up to them and engage them in close quarters combat or hastily run away.After confirming there were no other players from Victorious Return nearby, Nie Yan dashed towards the Elementalist named Violet Flame.A Mage\u2019s strategy was to maintain as great of a distance from the enemy as possible and bombard them with magic spells.The Elementalist Violet Flame leapt back using the spell Flame Burst and cast Fireball once again. Afterwards, he turned around and fled in an attempt to gain some distance from Nie Yan.When facing incoming magic in a fight, players were usually able to dodge the spell by rolling. However, if they dodged the spell by rolling, they would undoubtedly give the opposing Elementalist the opportunity to gain some distance. Nie Yan directly confronted the Elementalist\u2019s fireball and continued to charge forward.\u300cBoom!\u300dThe fireball exploded on Nie Yan\u2019s body, causing him to lose twenty-seven points of health.Each time Violet Flame cast a spell, there would be a delay in the casting of the spell.There were some essential factors in casting magic. Gestures, language, material, and magical tools were all required in casting different types of magic. The requirements for casting different spell were distinct. Some only required for you to perform a chant to cast the spell. Some required gestures and others required chants, gestures, and materials\u2014all of these components at once in order to cast a spell.Every spell had different requirements in order to be cast, and the casting time would vary as well.Casting a spell used syllables and gestures as units\u2014one syllable per second and one gesture per second. Ten syllables formed into a set of syllables and ten gestures formed into a set of gestures. Syllables and gestures could also be layered over each other\u2014meaning they could both be done at the same time.The casting time for the Flame Burst spell was two syllables and two gestures for a total of two seconds. If they hadn\u2019t learnt a movement skill when casting the Flame Burst spell they would need to stay still for two seconds.Nie Yan took advantage of the time Violet Flame used to cast Flame Burst to press forward. Quickly, with a forward stab, he shaved off twenty-three points of health from Violet Flame. A Mage\u2019s defense was extraordinarily fragile.Violet Flame leapt backwards. Promptly, he cast Fierce Flame Ring. Four separate flames appeared launching towards Nie Yan.Fierce Flame Ring only required one syllable in order to cast.At such a close distance, Nie Yan was simply unable to evade it. Thus, he could only suffer through, receiving thirty-nine points in damage. With a flick of his finger, he took out the Basic Health Potion from his belt and downed it.Violet Flame\u2019s actions could be regarded as standard for a Mage. However, his movements were quite rigid and clumsy. Every Mage would tense up when a Thief neared them in close proximity.As the Fierce Flame Ring was flying through the air, Violet Flame took the opportunity to draw back.Nie Yan added many points into Dexterity. In terms of speed, Thieves were still quite remarkable. This time around, his speed gained him an advantage as he continuously wrapped around Violet Flame. He lunged out with two consecutive stabs causing Violet Flame to lose thirty-six points of health.Once more, Violet Flame cast another fireball towards Nie Yan.Conviction\u2019s combat system counted three seconds per round, and any magical spell that took less than three seconds to chant would be uninterruptible unless the caster died. Even though it was a close combat battle, Violet Flame would still be able to counter-attack Nie Yan.Under Fireball\u2019s high damage, Nie Yan was left with twenty-five health remaining. Violet Flame wanted to retreat back to pull some distance. Brandishing his staff, he began reciting another spell incantation. The fire elements rapidly began moving towards his staff and coalescing into a round mass.It appeared Violet Flame still had fifty-one health remaining. For the time being, he was safe because Nie Yan merely had twenty-five health remaining. As long as he casts another Fireball he could finish off Nie Yan.Following Violet Flame\u2019s chanting, the fire elements rapidly gathered together as it raged and blazed forward.\u201cDrop dead!\u201d Violet Flame felt everything was now within his control\u2014the flames from his staff illuminated the sinister expression on his face.Nie Yan was well aware of how dangerous his current situation was. He had already forced his way to Violet Flame\u2019s side. Glancing at his rage bar, he noticed it was fully charged and matched the requirements for an enhanced attack.Nie Yan\u2019s deep black pupils locked onto Violet Flame\u2019s throat. Quickly, he maneuvered the dagger in his hand into a reverse grip.\u201cVital Strike!\u201dNie Yan\u2019s and Violet Flame\u2019s body crossed paths. A streak of cold glint flashed past Violet Flame\u2019s throat. A deep cut appeared on his throat as it split open with blood gushing forth.\u300c System: Vital Strike successful! Attack +5%, causing additional damage! \u300d\u221251A damage value floated atop Violet Flame\u2019s head.A complete turnaround!How is this possible?His eyes were deeply permeated with an unfathomable sort of expression.Never underestimate the explosive power of a Thief. When facing a Thief, never feel that you\u2019re safe or secure, even if you occupy an absolute advantage... because in the very next moment, the one who ends up dead could very well be you.The light in Violet Flame\u2019s eyes gradually faded.\u300cPlop...\u300dHe collapsed on the ground, still unable to understand what had happened. How could a single Thief just suddenly burst out with so much damage... ?Vital Strike... this skill\u2019s damage is pretty good, Nie Yan thought.Nie Yan put away his dagger, then bent down to look through Violet Flame\u2019s corpse. Soon, he retrieved a dropped equipment and picked up a Level 0 Intelligence +3 Bronze Staff. He estimated he could sell it for around ten or so coppers.\u201cThere\u2019s an enemy over there! Violet Flame was killed!\u201d\u201cChase! Don\u2019t let him escape!Nie Yan had killed a member from Victorious Return. Such a large event was certain to attract the attention of everyone within the surrounding area. Six members from Victorious Return came from every direction and quickly rushed towards Nie Yan\u2019s location in an attempt to surround him.Seeing this, Nie Yan made a mad dash towards Lake Rando. His running speed was quicker than most of the average players at his level. Soon, he rapidly gained some distance between him and the other players.Though, a Swordsman appeared right ahead of Nie Yan, barring his way forward.\u201cYou want to run? It\u2019s not going to be that easy! Linear Slash!\"62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Borrowing the force of gravity, he sent his sword cleaving towards Nie Yan.By the time Nie Yan saw the Berserker\u2019s Bastard Sword whistling through the wind, it had already neared his forehead.Nie Yan leaned his body to the side as the sword brushed past.Within Conviction, long range attacks would automatically lock onto their target\u2014who could only roll to dodge. As for melee combat, one could sidestep to avoid certain attacks.The most important requirement while sidestepping to dodge head-on attacks was to have good reaction speed. The timing had to be extremely precise. In his previous life, Nie Yan had already trained this ability to an extremely proficient level. After he dodged the Berserker\u2019s attack, he made a mad dash towards the lake.As his sword slashed through empty space, the Berserker stared out blankly with a look of shock. That guy\u2019s reaction speed is quick, being able to even dodge an attack like that...By the time he turned his head, the Berserker had discovered that Nie Yan had already run out a far distance. Seeing this, he held his sword out and gave chase.\u201cThird Brother, what\u2019s going on with you?

Zi Huo was an extremely reclusive fellow, however, his skills were definitely not weak. Yet he still died by the hands of that Thief. Looking back, it appeared that the Thief was not as simple as he first appeared.\u201cEveryone! Gather up and bar his way forward!\u201dBoth the Fighter and Berserker accelerated their pace.As he drew increasingly closer to the lake\u2019s surface\u2014at about five or six meters away\u2014Nie Yan fished out the Basic Underwater Breathing Pill he had bought prior and popped it into his mouth.\u201cHe wants to dive into the lake to escape!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t let him get to the water!\u201dIn a moment of mutual understanding, both the Berserker and Fighter simultaneously leapt forward. The Fighter and Berserker were both professions of the Warrior class. Their attacks after borrowing the momentum of their leaps were much more fierce and quick compared to other melee professions.\u201cSudden Assault!\u201d\u201cFlame Slash!\u201dThe Fighter brandished his sword and charged forward, quickly advancing towards Nie Yan.As the Berserker cleaved downwards, his sword ignited and became enveloped in raging flames.Nie Yan and the two were still a bit of a distance apart. As he turned his head to look back at them, he immediately felt his face assaulted by the flames of the sword stroke. Suddenly, from the corners of his mouth, he revealed a strange smile and then leapt backwards... His back entered the waters first, as he plunged deeply into Lake Rando.Right after, concentric ripples began slowly dispersing through the surface of the tranquil lake waters.The Fighter and Berserker rushed over, finally stopping at the lakeside. The Berserker prepared to jump into the lake waters, but the Fighter pulled him back and stopped him. \u201cForget it... there\u2019s no need to chase after a cornered enemy. Besides, none of us have any Underwater Breathing Pills.\u201d The Fighter thought back to the strange smile Nie Yan had shown just moment prior. This was the root cause of his unwillingness to enter the lake\u2019s waters\u2014for fear that Nie Yan could possibly have some sort of malicious plan for them in the waters below. Ultimately, he was fearful that it would cause them to be left buried under the lakebed.\u201cForget it... just like that?\u201d the Berserker replied in an extremely depressed tone.\u201cJust consider it Zi Huo\u2019s bad luck. Who let him think he was so invincible that he could just separate himself from the team like that? Anyway, we\u2019ll let this be a lesson for him\u2014there are still many experts besides him.\u201dSeveral players from Victorious Return ran up to them breathlessly, most of whom were Mages, Priests, and so on. Their movement speeds weren\u2019t as quick compared to the Warriors. Hence, they were left far behind.\u201cHow\u2019d it go? Where\u2019d that guy run off to?\u201d one of the Mages asked.The Fighter shook his head and replied, \u201cWe didn\u2019t catch him. He ended up diving into the lake.\u201dThat Mage had an astonished expression as he gazed at the Fighter and Berserker. These two, Zi Yan (Violet Cliff) and Zi Ming (Violet Underworld), could be considered the top two Warriors within the guild. First, that Thief killed Zi Huo, and then he managed to escape even after being surrounded by Zi Yan and Zi Ming... Where the hell did that Thief come from?\u201cI wonder... what was that Thief\u2019s name? Go ask Zi Huo. He should have already revived at the graveyard.\u201d The Mage spoke in a curious tone.\u201cZi Huo just said the Thief\u2019s name is Nirvana Flame,\u201d Zi Ming replied and firmly kept this name within his mind.Best n0vel 0nline free at \u24dd(0\u24e5)\u24d4\u24db\u24d1\u24d8\u24ddIn a concerned tone, the Mage commanded, \u201cFrom now on, have the people under you stay cautious. If they encounter this Nirvana Flame, have them report back immediately.\u201d When the several of them came across Nie Yan, they were unable to gain any sort of advantage. As for the outcome, if ordinary members of the guild were to encounter him, one could well imagine the consequences.After Nie Yan dived into the lake, he began swimming about. The waters of Lake Rando were extraordinarily clear. The sun\u2019s rays penetrated through the water. As the light refracted through the water\u2019s surface, it formed brightly coloured pillars. The lake\u2019s vegetation drifted about gently\u2014slowly dancing with the waves. It formed an exceptionally beautiful and mesmerizing piece of scenery.As Nie Yan was submerged near the lake floor, shuttling himself between the lake\u2019s vegetation, he suddenly recalled that there was another chest within Lake Rando\u2019s waters as well. However, he was a little unsure of its exact location as his memory was still a bit hazy.It should definitely be near this area. That chest should contain the skill book of a supportive skill called Gatherer. Even though Gatherer is not some kind of rare skill book, it\u2019s still pretty scarce, considering the average level of the current player base. After a player learned the Gatherer skill, they could increase their income by quite a bit. Every team required at least one member to have this skill, and every solo player definitely required the Gatherer skill as well. The market demand for the skill book was huge, however, the supply was few. This caused the relationship between supply and demand to become unbalanced. In turn, it caused the price of the Gatherer skill book to soar to great heights.If I\u2019m able to find the treasure chest, it would be very good. One of the characteristics of Thieves is that they\u2019re able to reach many locations that other professions would be incapable of reaching. By acquiring the Gatherer skill I can make it display even more of its usefulness.Basic Underwater Breathing Pills can only last for fifteen minutes. If I had known earlier that I was going to be underwater searching for a treasure chest, I would\u2019ve definitely bought a few more. Nie Yan felt a considerable bit of regret.In the far distance, a figure slowly submerged itself into the water and began swimming over. After being illuminated by the sun\u2019s rays. Nie Yan could, at last, see the figure distinctly. It was indeed a Level 3 Fishman. It had the body of a fish, its four limbs continuously moving to and fro. The speed of its movement underwater was unusually quick. In addition, it held a trident which was grasped firmly in its hand.Nie Yan hurriedly concealed himself within the thickets of the underwater vegetation.If it were one versus one, Nie Yan could effortlessly kill this Fishman. However, Fishmen very much loathed fighting one on one. In a situation where they were attacked, they would produce a howl so intense that it draws all the Fishmen within the immediate vicinity over to its location.For the purpose of staying safe, Nie Yan definitely did not dare to provoke these troublesome fellows.The Fishman was in an area not far from Nie Yan and was swimming over. Pushing apart the underwater vegetation, it made its way through.While the Fishman was brushing past the underwater plants, Nie Yan\u2019s eyes peered through the thickets of vegetation, discovering an object faintly concealed within.Glancing at the Fishman who had swum a far distance away, Nie Yan carefully swam past. This was an area heavily surrounded by Fishmen activity. If he were discovered, it would become dangerous very quickly.Nie Yan brushed past the vegetation. After searching for a while, he finally found a small wooden crate within the vegetation. It was the lowest level of treasure chests\u2014White grade. However, he was unsure if it was the one from his memories that he was looking for.After opening the wooden crate, Nie Yan went about digging through it. Surprisingly, the sensation he felt in his hands when he touched the object in the chest wasn\u2019t that of a skill book, but rather that of a smooth pearl.Nie Yan examined this object\u2019s properties.Murloc Water Aversion Pearl: Special ItemAdditional effect: Allows the user to breathe underwater. Once activated, allows the user to breathe underwater for thirty minutes.Cooldown: Twelve Hours.It was the most basic of special items. Although the item wasn\u2019t anything particularly great, it would allow Nie Yan to save on a few Basic Underwater Breathing pills. So, he would still be able to use them in the future.It seems this place doesn\u2019t contain only a single chest. After thinking about it, it should be right. Within such a large lake, the developers definitely wouldn\u2019t place only a single treasure chest. Nie Yan continued his search through the thick plant growth, traveling back and forth. After finding the Water Aversion Pearl, he spent quite an ample amount of time searching for treasure chests underwater.There were some movements in one of the thickets not far from him, causing Nie Yan\u2019s heart to jump with fright. Hurriedly, he ducked into the undergrowth next to him and concealed himself.A single Fishman appeared swimming through the vegetation, not far from Nie Yan. It leisurely swam past the gaps between the aquatic plant life.In the next moment, another Fishman came swimming towards Nie Yan\u2019s location.A single Fishman appeared swimming through the vegetation. Not far from Nie Yan, it leisurely swam past the gaps between the aquatic plant life.In the next moment, another Fishman came swimming towards Nie Yan\u2019s location.Then another Fishman appeared and another one...The Fishmen were appearing with increasing frequency.Dammit, did I end up stumbling upon a Fishmen lair...? Or maybe it\u2019s just my luck that I ended up coming across a school of Fishmen swimming by.One of the Fishmen neared him; the distance between them became increasingly shorter. Nie Yan felt a lump in his throat\u2014his mind full of anxiousness and urgency. He firmly grasped onto the dagger in his hand. Hiding seems like it\u2019s going to be impossible now. I can only hope for an opportunity to escape. Only, my swimming speed can\u2019t be compared to that of a Fishmen. I\u2019m not confident that I can really escape...The number of Fishmen within the vicinity were simply too many. If all of them came over, the only path Nie Yan would have left to take was death.If I were to blame someone I can only blame myself for getting too greedy. For the sake of finding treasure, I completely forgot about the dangers.One of the Fishmen arrived in the area about three meters away from him. It seemed to have noticed something. Halting in place, it raised up the trident in its hand.\u300cKieeh! Croak!\u300dThe Fishmen opened its mouth and produced a bizarre call.Nie Yan gazed at his surroundings. At least ten or so Fishmen emerged, surrounding the area he had hidden himself in. The Trident, which was as bright as snow, had already completely sealed off his escape route.He was finished. There was no way he could beat these Fishmen. The speed at which they moved underwater was unusually quick. Furthermore, once their sharp teeth bit into their target, they wouldn\u2019t release their jaws until they tore their target to shreds.Escaping is absolutely impossible. It\u2019s also impossible to win, even if I try forcefully facing off against them.In his mind, Nie Yan was prepared to die. He quickly glanced at the body of the Fishmen directly opposite of him. They had a soft red patch surrounding their abdomens\u2014that area was their weak spot . Even if I die, I\u2019ll at least take one out with me!Just at that moment, the intense sound of a horn rang out from the distant direction of the lakeside. The quick tempo was filled with urgency, as the loud and clear sound continuously resonated into the far distance.This was the warning signal. The Fishmen tribe was being attacked!The ten or so surrounding Fishmen near Nie Yan all stopped their movements at the same time.\u300cGurgle, Croak!\u300dShifting their heads to listen carefully, they opened their mouths and spoke in a strange language. Right after, they all simultaneously swam towards the direction of the lakeside at a great speed.These ten Fishmen swam away, becoming increasingly distant. Over a hundred Fishmen rushed over from all directions, converging together towards a single point as if they were a shoal of fish.The Fishmen gradually disappeared from Nie Yan\u2019s view.Nie Yan still felt apprehension in his heart. By some stroke of luck, the outcome of those subsequent events was surprising. However, they were still within his expectations.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It seems they\u2019ve already started.The Fishmen tribe was suffering an attack by the Victorious Return guild. This was why the encircling Fishmen had abandoned their attack and returned to aid their tribe. I never thought Victorious Return\u2019s people would end up saving my life. Haha, this world is so wonderfully strange!After all the Fishmen had swum away, the surrounding vicinity was now completely safe. Hence, Nie Yan stepped up his search for nearby treasure chests. Eventually, he noticed another treasure chest hidden within the thick underwater vegetation. It was a white treasure chest, just like the last.The surrounding landscape... everything here coincides with the one in my memories. This is the location!Nie Yan opened the chest. Digging through it, he felt a skill book make contact with his hands. It was the Gatherer skill book! As he held it in his hands, it turned into a streak of white light. The skill bar for supportive abilities had another skill appear\u2014Gatherer!Pretty decent harvest... However, I don\u2019t know if there are any other treasure chests within this area. It would simply be a waste of time to keep searching. It doesn\u2019t matter; I still know many other locations where I can find treasure chests. When I level up a bit, I can go pick them up at any time.Nie Yan swam, shuttling back and forth between the aquatic plants. If he encountered a monster, he would avoid them by staying a far distance away. After about ten minutes of swimming, he noticed a single island in the middle of Lake Rando. Only after noticing this did he swim towards the surface.\u300c System: You\u2019ve discovered an island within the center of the lake .\u300dReaching the shore, Nie Yan checked his coordinates. As he was investigating the surrounding area, he discovered a person sitting in the far distance\u2014fishing by the shore.This NPC was a very odd old man. He would make a request to every single player who encountered him to retrieve Fine Silk. For every bundle of Fine Silk that was brought back, the player would receive one Silk Cloth.If Fine Silk was sold to an NPC, it would amount to three coppers. However, Silk Cloth could only be sold for two coppers. If one continued on like this, there would be a loss in profit. Even after continuously exchanging with him, this old man would still do absolutely nothing to compensate the player.There were many players who would complete this task. However, every one of them would continue to receive losses\u2014never to receive a reward of any sort.Nie Yan also did this task in his previous life. Only after delivering five Fine Silk did he finally give up accepting this quest. Exchanging Fine Silk for Silk Cloth was truly a waste of money.Sometime later, a person who did not believe he would continue to receive nothing, repeatedly accepted the quest. Only after delivering thirty Fine Silk did he finally receive a reward. This NPC would impart onto the player the Combat Medic skill\u2014not only this, but it would be at the Intermediate level as well. After this information came out, it caused an uproar among the player-base. One after another, they would continuously rush over to accept the quest. However by that time, the NPC had already left.Currently in the area where Nie Yan was located, there were Level 3 monsters known as Water Spiders that dropped Fine Silk. Obtaining thirty Fine Silk would probably require about three days of continuous grinding. It just so happened that he could farm these thirty pieces of Fine Silk while also leveling up. Exchanging thirty Fine Silk for thirty Silk Cloth was merely a loss of thirty coppers, nothing more. Compared to an Intermediate Combat Medic skill, it was truly a negligible amount.Nie Yan walked over to the old man.The strange old man muttered loudly to himself, \u201cAround this time of year, the Hilton Stronghold would be besieged by the devil creatures that arise from the remote underground. There are numerous warriors who defend the stronghold. For the sake of safeguarding this lush and prosperous land, they pay with their blood and lives. The wounded suffer in anguish every day and night. To them, yesterday is the same as tomorrow and tomorrow is the same as yesterday.\u201dHe turned his head towards Nie Yan and asked, \u201cYoungster, now tell me\u2014would it better if I fished here on the shore, or would it be better if I fished while on the waters?\u201dThe old man had grey hair and appeared somewhat senile with his age. Numerous wrinkles were spread across his face. As if withered, his skin looked similar to tree bark. Sagging like the folds of his skin, his ashen-grey cloak hung low by his fishing rod.From his impression, Nie Yan\u2019s felt this NPC was a funny muddle-headed old man. He always asked a series of strange and odd questions, and it was fine as long as you somewhat answered them. However at present, when Nie Yan heard the old man\u2019s words, \u201cYesterday is the same as tomorrow. Tomorrow is also the same as yesterday,\u201d they had a new type of meaning.This old man wasn\u2019t an old fool. Rather, he was actually quite wise!It was fine if you answered the question in whichever way you liked. However, as if goaded on by some supernatural force, Nie Yan answered, \u201cAs long as you\u2019re able to catch fish, shore or water, what difference does it make?\u201dHearing Nie Yan\u2019s answer, the old man\u2019s eyes flashed with a strange glint.Noticing the change in the old man\u2019s expression as it fell upon his eyes, Nie Yan became increasingly convinced\u2014this Old Man in front of him definitely wasn\u2019t simple.\u201cTime is akin to an illusion and moves like a pendulum. The months and years are wasted doing nothing and suffering eternally repeats. In the end, everything returns to dust. Even if those brave warriors are able to defend this vast great world, they won\u2019t be able to escape the pain of illness and the Reaper of Death. In the end, what meaning is there to life?\u201d the Old Man sighed.\u201cThe meaning of life is to stubbornly prevail\u2014to live without regrets,\u201d Nie Yan said, while deep in contemplation. These were the insights he had gained this life after living through his previous one. He continued replying to the old man\u2019s question. \u201cAll their loved ones, their fellow brothers... all of them are here alongside them in this vast world. They continue to resist the attacks of their enemies for the sake of bringing them happiness. They stake their lives in order to defend this conviction. That is their honor and that is their glory. In doing so, the God of Light will protect them.\u201dNie Yan speculated that this old man was very likely one of the NPCs from the Hilton Stronghold, who left and journeyed outside in search of Fine Silk.Listening to Nie Yan\u2019s words, the muddled expression in the old man\u2019s eyes became clear.\u201cYoung man, I need a lot of Fine Silk. Is it possible for you to help me obtain it?\u201d the old man asked.\u201cIt\u2019s my desire to help in any way I can,\u201d Nie Yan happily replied. These were the exact words he had waited for.\u300c System: You\u2019ve received a task. Physician Blevins has entrusted you the task of retrieving Fine Silk. \u300dNie Yan began to recall. In his previous life, he had simply answered all these questions without much thought. The task he ended up receiving was \u201cNameless Old Man\u2019s Request.\u201d It seems the name of this current quest and the one he had received in the past weren\u2019t exactly the same.This old man ought to be the NPC physician in the Hilton Stronghold... Did he come all the way from the Hilton Stronghold for the sake of finding Fine Silk?The fact that this old man also taught the Intermediate Combat Medic skill further confirmed Nie Yan\u2019s suspicions.All of that doesn\u2019t matter right now. First, I\u2019ll finish this quest and think about it later.Nie Yan bid farewell to the old man and headed south of the small island. That region of the lake was an area where Water Spiders roamed about. Although Water Spiders were Level 3 monsters, their combat strength wasn\u2019t that great. Only when they were on the water\u2019s surface would they become somewhat of a problem.Once more, Nie Yan plunged into the lake, then stuck his head out of the water. This region of underwater space didn\u2019t have a lot of monster activity. Thus, he didn\u2019t have to worry about any monsters launching a sneak attack from below.Soon, he discovered a Water Spider. They were a species of spider that grew to a very large size. They were capable of moving about at high speeds on the water\u2019s surface. Unlike other spiders, they didn\u2019t use venom to attack. Furthermore, they were even afraid of humans. As long as a player didn\u2019t attack them, they wouldn\u2019t take the initiative to attack the player.Water Spider: Level 3Health: 80/80Nie Yan gradually neared the Water Spider from behind. Swiftly, he raised his dagger and pounced forward. Stabbing into the Water Spider\u2019s back, he managed to attack it several times in quick succession.The Water Spider shrieked miserably before lunging towards its attacker. Nie Yan quickly dodged, and then returned with another stab. Saving enough energy for a Vital Strike, he stabbed the Water Spider in the eye.Letting out an agonized shriek, the Water Spider\u2019s legs shrivelled up and curled towards its body as it floated on the surface of the water.After dying, it dropped a single copper. Nie Yan caught the copper coin it dropped before swimming off towards another Water Spider.The drop rate for Fine Silk was 0.5%. In other words, Nie Yan needed to kill around six thousand Water Spiders in order to obtain the thirty pieces of Fine Silk. This would require about three days of nonstop grinding.Three days would be enough time for Nie Yan to raise his level to three, learn the Combat Medic skill, and return to town to purchase a few skill books. His strength would improve quite a bit.In the far distance, Nie Yan saw a Water Spider moving at high speed on the surface of the lake.A single spell fell from the Heavens and struck the Water Spider down. Soon, a damage value of thirty-six floated over its head.It was Holy Smite\u2014a spell used by Holy Mages.There\u2019s another person in this area?Nie Yan became vigilant and went on high alert. Looking far off into the distance, he noticed a person being pursued by a Level 3 Water Spider.It was quite far away, so Nie Yan could only see that this person belonged to the Holy Mage class. Not only this, but the Holy Mage was a woman as well. She was clutching a blue-coloured staff in her hand and was wearing a white mage robe over her body. However, he was still unable to clearly distinguish her features.It seemed that she was in a bit of trouble. Nie Yan stayed silent for a moment. Afterwards, he dived underwater and swam towards her. If she was a hostile player, he would kill her without hesitation. However, if there was no enmity, he would lend her a hand.That Holy Mage was dealing with the pursuing Water Spiders. By coincidence, she was also swimming over in his direction.At last, Nie Yan\u2019s head broke out of the water. He was now approximately five meters away from her.Noticing another person\u2014Nie Yan\u2014popping out of the water, the Holy Mage tensed up. Immediately, she changed directions and swam over to another location.She was currently being chased by several Water Spiders. If she encountered a person who took pleasure in kicking others while they were down, it would undoubtedly mean her death.Both parties were already in close proximity.When the Holy Mage turned her head around, Nie Yan could clearly see the other person\u2019s appearance. She was a beautiful looking young woman. Her hair was tied back in a ponytail, with a single lock of hair hanging down from the side of her face. Her cheeks were white, and her eyes were as clear as water.Although Conviction altered a player\u2019s appearance, they were only slight adjustments. The overall attractiveness of the player would not be altered. Hence, their level of attractiveness would fundamentally be the same as it was in reality. This was also one of the reasons why Conviction drew people in.Nie Yan was able to clearly see at a glance that the Holy Mage across from him was a real beauty.The Holy Mage worryingly gazed over at where Nie Yan was located\u2014their two eyes converged. She turned around and continued to fend off the Water Spiders. Simultaneously evading three Water Spiders was definitely a little challenging. However, she still remained very calm. Using a Haste scroll on herself, her speed immediately increased by several fold.After recognizing the opposite party\u2019s appearance, Nie Yan\u2019s mouth opened so wide a chicken egg could fit in it. How did I end up meeting her here!?He couldn\u2019t help emotionally sighing at how minuscule the world was.The beautiful woman across from him was called Yao Yao (Dark Mystery). Come to think of it, in his past life, the two of them actually had a rather complicated and ill-fated relationship. Never did he expect that they would meet again here. It appeared lovers or enemies could truly not avoid meeting with one another.Perhaps this type of chance encounter was meant to be.Nie Yan and his friends were going to enter an instance. However, they were short a Mage. Thus, one of his friends brought Yao Yao into the team. This was the first time they had met. Afterwards, they gradually grew closer when they found more opportunities to party up later on and had many more adventures together.Old friends are the same as before , Nie Yan sighed with deep sorrow.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Seeing this, Nie Yan quickly swam over in her direction.Yao Yao became even more nervous when she saw Nie Yan swim over. There were three monsters chasing her from behind. Perhaps if she relied on her excellent skills, then she would be able to slowly whittle away their health until they died. Even then, her hopes of survival wouldn\u2019t surpass ten percent. However, if Nie Yan were to take advantage of her situation, she would essentially have no chance of living.Noticing the three Water Spiders repeatedly launching themselves at Yao Yao, Nie Yan increased his pace and closed in from behind. Gradually, he overtook one of the Water Spiders. With his dagger in hand, he leaped out of the water\u2019s surface and stabbed at the center of its back.Yao Yao turned around and followed Nie Yan\u2019s attack by casting Holy Smite. The spell connected and blasted the Water Spider\u2019s body, killing it in the process.She gazed over and stared at her savior. Since Nie Yan had helped her deal with the Water Spider, Yao Yao presumed he didn\u2019t have any malicious intents.Nie Yan directed his attention to another Water Spider\u2014one that had only half of its health remaining. Using Vital Strike, he stabbed the spider in the eye and dealt fifty-two damage.In the blink of an eye, only one of the three original spiders remained standing.What a powerful attack! Yao Yao stared in astonishment at Nie Yan. In her mind, out of all her friends, she had never met anyone as strong as him. Looking again, he seemed somewhat unfamiliar.After Nie Yan finished killing the second Water Spider, he immediately swam over to the third.With two people against only a single spider, the situation immediately appeared to be much more relaxed.Yao Yao brandished the staff in her right hand and cast Holy Strike. The attack landed on the remaining Water Spider\u2019s body.\u201cThank you.\u201d Seeing that the three Water Spiders were completely wiped out, Yao Yao faced Nie Yan and expressed her gratitude. However, she still remained on alert, just in case Nie Yan decided to suddenly attack.\u201cNo need to be polite, it was only a slight effort. Hi, I\u2019m called Nirvana Flame.\u201d Nie Yan smiled brightly and began to recall how Yao Yao had been a very gentle and understanding girl. She was a very considerate person. Though she was a little headstrong as well\u2014for a girl, it wasn\u2019t too hard of a shortcoming to accept.\u201cMy name is Yao Yao.\u201d Evidently, she still remained quite cautious. She had never met Nie Yan before, so it wasn\u2019t very easy for her to let her guard down.Nie Yan wanted to add Yao Yao as a friend and find out what she was doing here. However, so as not to make it appear too sudden, he wouldn\u2019t ask these inappropriate questions immediately. After all, Yao Yao was still a girl. Despite understanding that she remained cautious when facing him, Nie Yan still firmly believed that from his understanding of Yao Yao, the two of them could still become friends like before.Back then, after he became acquainted with her in the game, it was always her who would stay by his side comforting and encouraging him whenever he felt really depressed or frustrated. The two of them still remained friends. However, a certain relationship had unwittingly occurred between the two of them. From thenceforth, the complications between the two could not be broken nor tidied up.Yao Yao quietly observed Nie Yan. Looking at him, he gave the impression of being very young and he didn\u2019t seem like a bad person.The two people didn\u2019t exchange any words afterward. Due to Yao Yao\u2019s cold nature, it caused the two parties to become somewhat silent.\u201cToday you saved me, so I want to thank you. How about we add each other as friends?\u201d Yao Yao broke the ice by speaking.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. So, why are you here farming Water Spiders?\u201d Nie Yan asked. This place was quite a far distance from any towns. Hence, few players would frequent this area.\u201cOne of my quests is to kill Water Spiders and collect their Water Sacks,\u201d Yao Yao replied. As she began to recall the prior events, she thought, That was quite a close call. Just a moment ago, I nearly died to the monsters here. If I died, then these past three to four days of painstaking efforts would\u2019ve gone down the drain.\u201cThat\u2019s great; I also happened to accept a quest that requires me to kill Water Spiders, but to gather their Fine Silk instead. We should party up and kill these spiders together. The Water Sacks will go to you, and Fine Silk to me. How about it?\u201d Nie Yan suggested.Yao Yao remained silent for a moment. Then she nodded her head and said, \u201cAlright, however, we both have to agree to one condition. If a person finishes collecting the materials they need, then they can leave at any time.\u201dShe chose to put forth these conditions so if she felt Nie Yan were being useless when they were killing monsters together, she could leave immediately.\u201cThat\u2019s only natural. I\u2019ll start the party.\u201d Nie Yan sent Yao Yao a party request.System: Yao Yao has become a member of your party.\u201cI have twelve Fine Silks on me right now. I\u2019ll give them to you. Just consider it a thank you gift.\u201d Yao Yao opened her trade window while she spoke.\u201cTwelve Fine Silks is the equivalent of thirty-six coppers!\u201d Nie Yan shook his head in refusal.\u201cAre you meaning to say that my level\u2019s worth of experience isn\u2019t even worth thirty-six coppers? Besides, I don\u2019t have any use for Fine Silk anyways.\u201d Yao Yao stared at Nie Yan. Her eyes were quite large and round, while her eyelashes were slightly raised. She appeared to be quite smart and quick-witted. Yao Yao clearly showed that she didn\u2019t want to owe him a debt. Furthermore, she also came up with an idea to pay him back. Since it was also favourable for him, Nie Yan didn\u2019t have any reasons to pester her more about it.\u201cFine.\u201d Nie Yan confirmed the trade. Once Yao Yao was set on a matter, she would become very stubborn. Hence, Nie Yan didn\u2019t want to argue further and cause the atmosphere to become too stiff.\u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201d Yao Yao let out a faint smile once she saw Nie Yan accept the trade.In this way, Nie Yan had taken a large step towards completing his quest.Nie Yan began organizing his inventory as he quietly observed Yao Yao. Compared to the time when the two had first met in his past life, she seemed slightly more immature. Her skin appeared white as snow, while the lake waters that had soaked into her clothes caused her tight-fitting robe to accentuate her curvaceous figure even more.Nie Yan distinctly remembered the day when they were in the dungeons under Fenarte city. When Yao Yao had taken off her clothes, her bare and perfectly curved body resembled the carving of a goddess.On that erotic and lascivious day, both of them became completely dominated by the most primal of urges.However, they clearly understood... this was only a game. Neither of the two had the courage to approach the other in real life. After that event, they gradually returned to the roles of just being good friends. Only, that one instance had ended up turning into a magnificent mistake. It became a lifelong memory that could never be erased, submerging itself deeply within their hearts.Nie Yan and Yao Yao chatted for a while, talking about topics related to nothing but the game. However, the two still chatted rather amicably.\u201cHow about we start going?\u201d Yao Yao blinked while staring at Nie Yan.Nie Yan\u2019s appearance could only be regarded as ordinary. Indeed, he was unable to compare to the several people on her team. However, the way he treated people wasn\u2019t bad. So in that sense, he was much more pleasing to the eye than her other companions.Two people hunting monsters was much faster than a single person alone. Nie Yan tanked, dealing with the monsters in the front while Yao Yao attacked from the back with Holy Smite and Holy Strike. A Holy Mage\u2019s damage output was really powerful. Compared to Nie Yan\u2019s damage, it was much higher. Though naturally, when it came to comparing attack speed, she wasn\u2019t able to reach Nie Yan at all.Nie Yan\u2019s mind went blank for a moment as he began to recall those matters in his previous life. Immediately, he regained his focus. Those matters in the past were already over. He\u2019ll become good friends with Yao Yao again, however, he absolutely wouldn\u2019t make that mistake again. Xie Yao was the only person who was engraved in Nie Yan\u2019s heart. After all, everything in a game is only an illusion. In the end, even the most harmonious of virtual lovers would also eventually part ways.\u201cHave you joined a team yet?\u201d Yao Yao asked.\u201cAt present, I still haven\u2019t.\u201d\u201cHow come? With your skills being so good, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there were a lot of teams competing to recruit you.\u201d Yao Yao felt rather puzzled.\u201cI\u2019m used to training alone. As for joining a team, I\u2019ll think about it in the future. There\u2019s no meaning in joining a team in the early levels after all.\u201dBest n0vel 0nline free at \u24dd(0\u24e5)\u24d4\u24db\u24d1\u24d8\u24ddNie Yan finished speaking and lunged towards a nearby Water Spider. Very quickly, Yao Yao followed up with a Holy Smite.Just as the Water Spider was about to make a move, Nie Yan\u2019s dagger had already stabbed into the spider\u2019s abdomen, killing it in the process. The pair coordinated extremely well and had a tacit understanding.This was the first time Yao Yao had felt so relaxed while farming monsters with another person. She couldn\u2019t help but have some doubts in her heart and wonder, could she have met Nie Yan somewhere before?\u201cNirvana Flame (Nie Yan), Nirvana Flame (Nie Yan)...\u00b9 it couldn\u2019t possibly be him, right?\u201d Muttering to herself, Yao Yao stared at the figure of Nie Yan\u2019s back. Dazedly, she began to feel he somewhat resembled a person she knew.\u201cOur team currently has only seventeen people, so it\u2019s still not full. Do you want to join us?\u201d Yao Yao suggested. Although Nie Yan is only Level 2, his skills are quite good. Big Sis Blue Feather (Yu Lan) would most likely welcome him gladly.\u201cI don\u2019t want to join any teams for now,\u201d Nie Yan said, declining her offer.\u201cOh.\u201d Yao Yao felt a slight sense of disappointment.\u201cAn Assassinate skill book for Thieves dropped,\u201d Nie Yan said.\u201cIt\u2019s a Thief skill book, so you should take it then. If a Mage item drops, just give it to me. We\u2019ll each take what we need.\u201dAfter having chatted for quite a while, the two gradually became more familiar. Thus, Yao Yao also wouldn\u2019t haggle over any drops with Nie Yan.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll be helping myself.\u201d Nie Yan gazed at the Assassinate skill book.Skill Book: AssassinateDescription: Thieves gain Rage after a successful strike.Requirements: Action (requires weapon)Properties: Hitting a target\u2019s vitals adds an additional Attack +2, Rage +1, Combo Count +1.Cooldown: 30 secondsRestrictions: Thief, Warrior, Paladin; can be learned by any faction.Nie Yan wasn\u2019t like those whom she had partied up with before. They would put on an act of sincerity and decline, only to accept it right afterward. Yao Yao\u2019s expression changed into a slight smile. While interacting with Nie Yan, she had unexpectedly developed a sort of familiarity that penetrated deeply into her bone marrow. Right here, she didn\u2019t need to act in the sort of manner she did in real life\u2014always putting on many false facades.Nie Yan finished learning the Assassinate skill. Thus, his skill bar had another skill added to it.A Thief\u2019s attack skills were divided into Basic Skills, Combo Skills, and Finishing Skills. Basic skills could be used at any time. Combo Skills were used to obtain a combo count, and to build up Rage when attacking an enemy. Vital Strike and skills similar to it were classified as Finishing Skills. They were only able to be used after building up a sufficient amount of Rage. Every additional point added to the combo count would give an additional +20% in attack. The upper limit for this combo count was ten stacks. Once they were used, the combo counter would reset to zero.As such, this was the beauty of the existence known as the combo system. If two Thieves possessing the same skills were to match up, the damage an expert level Thief would deal was often two to three times higher than the average thief\u2014sometimes even more.Under ordinary circumstances, it was considered quite normal for a Thief to have twice as many Basic Skills and Combo Skills than Finishing Skills in their skillset.After obtaining Assassinate, Nie Yan\u2019s Rage was now able to build up at a much faster rate. One normal attack followed by Assassinate would build up enough Rage to use Vital Strike.Nie Yan and Yao Yao became increasingly skillful in their coordination. Thus, the two of them acted more daringly as they accelerated the rate at which they hunted monsters. During the times when there were many opponents, Nie Yan would be dealing with three monsters at a time while Yao Yao frantically cast spells from behind.Her staff never stopped moving, continuously firing off Holy Smites and Holy Strikes. When she was out of mana, she would drink a mana recovery potion.As long as one wasn\u2019t interrupted by an attack from the enemy, a Basic Mana Recovery Potion would restore sixty mana in thirty seconds. The price was also inexpensive, so it was extremely cost-effective.\u201cHow many Water Sacks have you collected?\u201d\u201cFifty-two.\u201d\u201cHow much more do you need?\u201d\u201cEight more.\u201d\u201cIt seems you\u2019ll be finished collecting them very soon. You probably haven\u2019t learned Alchemy Crafting yet, right? After you\u2019ve handed in your quest, go to Moste Town ( 356.329.31) . That place should have a Hidden NPC who issues the quest called \u2018Rare Herbs.\u2019 After you\u2019ve completed the quest from the NPC, you\u2019ll be able to learn Perfect Alchemy Crafting,\u201d Nie Yan said. Perfect Alchemy Crafting\u2019s effectiveness was a lot more powerful when compared to common Alchemy Crafting.Ahhhh... I\u2019m going to complete my quest so soon. Yao Yao suddenly felt a sense of loss in her heart. Hunting monsters together with Nie Yan was far more enjoyable than leveling alone; at the very least, she had a companion to chat with.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12 - Extra IncomePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 12 \u2013 Extra Income\u201cWhy learn Alchemy Crafting?\u201d Yao Yao (Dark Mystery) asked in a puzzled tone.\u201cMages who don\u2019t learn Alchemy Crafting are certain to become poor beggars by the time they reach a high level. After all, magic potions are extremely expensive. The innate skill of a Human Mage is that they are able to skip a grade when creating magic type potions. It would simply be too much of a waste if a Mage didn\u2019t learn Alchemy Crafting,\u201d Nie Yan replied.\u201cAlright then, I\u2019ve recorded the coordinates. Thanks for the recommendation, Nie Yan.After noticing the movements of a water spider just ahead of him, Nie Yan began swimming towards its location. It was in an area about five meters away. Though suddenly, he stopped and swam no further. The Water Spider in front of him wasn\u2019t exactly the same as an ordinary Water Spider\u2014its build was slightly larger than average.Water Spider Leader: Level 3Health: 160/160\u201cIt\u2019s a Leader monster,\u201d Nie Yan turned his head and said to Yao Yao.\u201cCan we beat it?\u201d Yao Yao asked. Nie Yan was more knowledgeable than her. So somehow, she was starting to get used to asking Nie Yan whenever she had a question.\u201cJust barely. Only... it\u2019s going to be slightly difficult.\u201d Nie Yan surveyed the nearby area. The open water didn\u2019t have any terrain they would be able to make use of. Not to mention this region was a haven for Water Spiders.\u201cIf it\u2019s too dangerous, then we should let it pass,\u201d Yao Yao added. It would simply be too much of a loss if they ended up dying and dropping a level. For it would take two to three days\u2019 time at minimum if they desired to train back to their current state.\u201cDo you have any Underwater Breathing Pills?\u201d Nie Yan asked. The Water Spider was a type of creature that could only move on the water\u2019s surface. Hence, they were unable to dive underwater\u2014a fatal weakness of theirs.\u201cI don\u2019t have any more. I didn\u2019t carry enough and ended up using them all before.\u201d Yao Yao\u2019s expression had turned a shade of red. She hadn\u2019t expected that\u2014while on this journey\u2014she would be required to use up so many Underwater Breathing Pills. If she did have enough pills, she also wouldn\u2019t have met with such dangers. She could dive underwater whenever she encountered danger, and there would\u2019ve been no problems at all.\u201cI still have one more pill with me... Take it. Water Spiders can\u2019t dive underwater, so you\u2019ll be the one attacking it first. If you\u2019re forced into close quarters with it, then dive underwater immediately. I\u2019ll be in the distance shooting crossbow bolts to draw it away. Once it\u2019s gone far enough, resurface and continue casting. When its health nears zero, we\u2019ll regroup and face it then,\u201d Nie Yan said after contemplating for a moment.Using this method, they could gradually whittle at the Water Spider Leader\u2019s health until it died.\u201cI didn\u2019t see it before, but that head of yours is truly useful.\u201d Yao Yao couldn\u2019t help but stare at Nie Yan. In his hands, any sort of problem simply became a cakewalk to resolve.\u201cWhen I was younger, my IQ was tested to be at two hundred and six. Matters such as these are a mere trifle!\u201d Nie Yan smiled before swimming over to another side.Seeing the appearance of how pleased Nie Yan was with himself, Yao Yao couldn\u2019t help but break out into a grin. Really, this guy, give him a little praise and he gets so happy.Best n0vel 0nline free at \u24dd(0\u24e5)\u24d4\u24db\u24d1\u24d8\u24ddSeeing that he was about twenty meters apart from the Water Spider Leader, Nie Yan signaled Yao Yao.She waved her staff and cast Holy Smite. The spell struck the Spider Leader\u2019s body, dealing fifteen points of damage to its health.What\u2019s with this Leader monster? Its defense is actually higher by a lot!\u300cHiss!\u300dThe Spider Leader let out a strange screech and began sprinting towards Yao Yao. Before the Spider Leader was able to reach her location, she could still cast one more spell. She began to activate Holy Strike.\u300cBoom!\u300dA beam of light exploded forth, falling from the Heavens and smashing down onto the Spider Leader\u2019s body\u2014causing it to lose sixteen health.Once Nie Yan finished arming his crossbow, three bolts fired out in succession.\u300cPutt! Putt! Putt!\u300dAll of them hit their target. \u22126, \u22126, \u22126Three damage numbers floated above the Spider Leader\u2019s head. Afterwards, he continued to rearm the crossbow.Having finished casting Holy Strike, Yao Yao saw that the Spider Leader had charged close to her position. Almost immediately, she dove back into the water.After Yao Yao had dove underwater, the Spider Leader had no means of getting to her.The Spider Leader was skittering back and forth fretfully on the water\u2019s surface, where Yao Yao had submerged.\u300cWhsh! Whsh! Whsh!\u300dThree bolts arrived at their target, hitting the Spider Leader\u2019s head. Nie Yan immediately attracted its attention, and the spider went sprinting towards his location.Nie Yan anxiously resupplied his crossbow with bolts. Before he could even finish fully reloading, the Spider Leader had already rushed in front of him. He hurriedly swapped his crossbow for his dagger.\u201cAssassinate!\u201dNie Yan struck out with Assassinate, stabbing the Spider Leader in its flank\u2014dealing twelve points of damage to its health bar.The Spider Leader leapt forward and struck him, causing Nie Yan to lose sixty health.What a strong attack!If I suffer another hit, I\u2019ll undoubtedly die!Nie Yan originally wanted to fight it out for another round. However, when he was facing a danger of this degree, he didn\u2019t dare take the risk. In the next moment, he dove into the water.The Spider Leader\u2019s next strike hit empty air. Raising its sharp stinging legs, it stabbed into the water below. Its legs were similar to arrows raining down and entering the water\u2019s surface. One struck Nie Yan and pierced directly into his shoulder.\u221232A damage value floated atop Nie Yan\u2019s head.The Spider Leader had succeeded in hitting with one of its attacks. Soon after, another leg came piercing towards Nie Yan.Nie Yan did a quick roll within the water. The Spider Leader\u2019s awl-like leg pierced through the water, just past Nie Yan\u2019s cheek, causing a large streak of bubbles to emerge.Close call! Only after Nie Yan dived a bit deeper, did he finally leave the Spider Leader\u2019s attack range. He had a little less than twenty health remaining. Next time he wouldn\u2019t confront the Spider Leader head on.\u201cSacred Art!\u201dTaking advantage of the Spider Leader\u2019s attention on Nie Yan, Yao Yao cast her strongest spell dealing twenty-seven damage to its health.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Yao Yao asked in a worried tone. She saw two very large damage values float over Nie Yan\u2019s head.\u201cI\u2019m fine. The Water Spider Leader\u2019s attacks are too powerful. By all means, do not get hit by one of its attacks,\u201d Nie Yan said while still having some lingering fears. He had underestimated the Spider Leader\u2019s attack capability and nearly died.\u201cOkay, I understand,\u201d Yao Yao answered back and continued to brandish her staff.Under her unceasing bombardment of attacks, the Spider Leader\u2019s aggro shifted back to Yao Yao. Once more, it charged in her direction.\u201cHoly Smite! Holy Strike!\u201d\u221215\u221216After Yao Yao finished casting another round of spells, she once again dove underwater.The Spider Leader irritably skittered around the water\u2019s surface. Nie Yan then fired off another three bolts, hitting the Spider Leader in its butt.So after kiting it back and forth, the Spider Leader\u2019s health bar was gradually drained clean. Following Yao Yao casting one final Sacred Art, the Spider Leader\u2019s health bar dropped to zero. its body floated above the surface of the water, shrivelled and curled up.The entire process was simpler than they had imagined.Seeing the Water Spider Leader meet its death, Nie Yan finally relaxed and sighed in relief. After killing it, his experience bar rose to fifty-two percent.\u201cWhat item did it drop?\u201d Nie Yan asked.\u201cCome and see.\u201d Yao Yao put the two items she just picked up into the trade window.Fine Silk Gloves (Bronze Grade)Requirements: Level 0Properties: Defense 2\u20133, Magic +3Weight: 1.3 lbRestrictions: Mage; can be equipped by any factionRare Fine Silk (Raw Materials)Quantity: 5\u201cYou have the Appraisal skill?\u201d Nie Yan asked. It\u2019s reasonable to say that recently dropped items should be unidentified. He would\u2019ve never expected that Yao Yao\u2014with her Level being so low\u2014had already learned the Appraisal skill.Yao Yao nodded her head and said, \u201cCorrect! I learned the most basic Appraisal skill.\u201cThe gloves go to you and, since I need it, the Rare Fine Silk to me,\u201d Nie Yan said. What difference does this Rare Fine Silk have with ordinary Fine Silk? I wonder... will Physician Blevins accept this Rare Fine Silk, or not?\u201cEn, I won\u2019t be polite then,\u201d Yao Yao said. Fortunately, those gloves were just what she needed\u2014having Magic +3 as a property. To a Mage, an increase in Magic was the best property they could wish for in a piece of equipment. If it were placed in the market, it would go for at least fifty or sixty coppers. If one calculated, Nie Yan had received the raw end of the deal. Yao Yao felt slightly apologetic, but recalling that Nie Yan had also picked up the Assassinate skill book earlier, she became less flustered.Yao Yao placed the Rare Fine Silk in her trade window. Afterwards, both of them pressed accept.While the two were conducting the trade, they were both really close. Nie Yan glanced at Yao Yao\u2019s cheek. Her skin tone was as healthy as ever\u2014jade like porcelain so white, he couldn\u2019t find a single blemish.\u201cWhat are you staring at?\u201d Yao Yao asked in a panicked manner. Being gazed at by Nie Yan caused a deep red to emerge from her cheeks, lightly spreading across her face.Seeing Yao Yao\u2019s expression redden like a tomato, Nie Yan laughed and swam towards a nearby Water Spider.After an afternoon of killing monsters, Nie Yan had collected twenty-three Fine Silks, and Yao Yao finally finished gathering the Water Sacks she required.\u201cIn a few days, my team will be hunting in the Treant Forest near Tellak Town. We still have a few spots, do you want to join?\u201d Yao Yao pretended to ask in a casual and nonchalant manner. However, in her heart, she actually had some faint hopes and expectations that Nie Yan would accept.Treant Forest is a small Level 3 instance; it\u2019s one of the basic instances. The difficulty for basic instances is usually high. The final Treant King is pretty troublesome as well\u2014an Elite monster. If a Fighter\u2019s Defense stat didn\u2019t reach sixty, and their health wasn\u2019t at least two hundred and twenty, they basically have no chance.\u201cHow many people do you have?\u201d\u201cIncluding you, we have eighteen: two Fighters, two Berserkers, two Paladins, two Thieves, three Priests, and seven Mages.\u201d\u201cHow much defense and health do your Fighters have?\u201d Nie Yan asked. If her team is skilled, there\u2019d be no harm in going once. Treant Forest drops quite a few good Thief-related items.\u201cFifty-three Defense, and two hundred thirty health.\u201d\u201cTheir health is fine, however, their defense is too low. I\u2019d still advise you guys to not go,\u201d Nie Yan said as he shook his head. The Fighters\u2019 stats were lacking a bit.\u201cWhy?\u201d Yao Yao opened her eyes widely, staring at Nie Yan in bewilderment.\u201cThe Treant King has a two percent chance of landing a critical hit. Therefore the Fighters\u2019 defense and health must be high. The Priests\u2019 Heal skill also needs to be able to follow up. Otherwise, if a critical hit occurred and your Fighters are killed, then your whole team will end up being wiped. Although you don\u2019t drop equipment or levels in an instance, you\u2019ll still lose twenty percent of your experience. Which is enough to be unbearable for most people.\u201d\u201cHow do you know this?\u201dNie Yan faintly smiled, but he didn\u2019t reply.\u201cAlthough I feel what you\u2019re saying could possibly be correct, they\u2019ve already been preparing for many days. I can\u2019t just refuse to go, right?\u201d\u201cJust listen to my words. Have your Fighters get their defense to sixty, first, then you can go,\u201d Nie Yan said. If Yao Yao didn\u2019t listen to his warnings and went now, she was sure to lose twenty percent of her experience. Fortunately, twenty percent wasn\u2019t all that much. With less than a day\u2019s worth of training, she could gain it back.\u201cDefense of sixty... it\u2019s only possible if we get another piece of Bronze-grade equipment at the very least. That\u2019s going to be too difficult,\u201d Yao Yao said while shaking her head. A piece of Bronze-grade equipment was at least, but not limited to, five or six times the price of ordinary equipment. At minimum, it would cost at least three to four silvers. Their team definitely didn\u2019t have such financial power.\u201cIf you can refuse, then just refuse. However, if your friends really are determined to go, then there\u2019s no helping it. In any case, it\u2019s only twenty percent experience, nothing more.\u201d\u201cNie Yan, is what you said true?\u201d Yao Yao furrowed her beautiful brows and asked with concern.Nie Yan nodded his head and swam over to a nearby Water Spider that was off to his side.Yao Yao\u2019s intuition told her Nie Yan\u2019s words were credible, yet she was still quite puzzled. How did Nie Yan know about this information? Could it be... Had he already been to the Treant Forest before? Even if he did go there previously, it was still impossible for him to obtain such accurate data so quickly.\u201cI\u2019ve finished my quest, so I should get going. Today was quite enjoyable. Training together with you was very fun. Nie Yan (Nirvana Flame), how about we add each other as friends? So in the future, I can contact you again,\u201d Yao Yao said. In her heart, she felt a little reluctant to part. Nie Yan was the very first friend of the opposite gender she felt happy being around with. Of course, her intentions were for them to be within the boundaries of friends and nothing more.\u201cSure,\u201d Nie Yan responded, and added Yao Yao to his friend list.\u201cI\u2019ll be leaving first then. Bye bye!\u201d Yao Yao said while waving her hand in farewell.The figure of Yao Yao\u2019s back became increasingly distant.Once Yao Yao left, Nie Yan felt a bit of melancholy. However, very soon, he adjusted his mood and continued to kill Water Spiders.One after another, spiders continuously fell at the hand of Nie Yan\u2019s dagger.He looked at the time\u2014still three hours until the game closed.\u300cPururu! Pururu! Pururu!\u300dNie Yan received a voice notification.\u201cExpert, it\u2019s me,\u201d Stone said via a voice message.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Nie Yan replied back.\u201cI have a friend who wants to meet you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been very busy lately. I don\u2019t have the time.\u201d\u201cMy friend said he\u2019s willing to pay the two silvers required to obtain the guide for the Fallen Shaman camp.\u201d\u201cDid your team get wiped out by the wooden fences there?\u201d Nie Yan asked. That area was an extremely difficult hurdle. If you didn\u2019t know the trick to get through, then passing was extremely difficult.\u201cH-how\u2019d you know?\u201d Stone asked in surprise. Nie Yan had guessed correctly. He became more certain\u2014Nie Yan had definitely beaten the Fallen Shaman camp in the past.\u201cOf course, I know. You guys want the Fallen Shaman Camp guide? That\u2019s fine. First send the money over to my personal storage.\u201dA personal storage was the same as an account. Players themselves were free to access their own storage. They were even allowed to send money and items to another player\u2019s storage, but they were not allowed to take anything out.\u201cThis... I\u2019ll have to ask first,\u201d Stone said. It was evident he wasn\u2019t the one making the decisions. After a moment, he sent another voice message to Nie Yan. \u201cMy friend said we\u2019re able to send one silver in advance as a down payment. If your guide truly is effective, then we\u2019ll send the other half of the payment.\u201dNie Yan thought for a moment and said, \u201cAlright, that\u2019s fine.\u201d Due to Nie Yan having hit the mark several times on the things he spoke of, the other party was willing to do this trade. However, by paying first, they were taking on a huge risk. If by chance Nie Yan was actually a swindler, it would be the same as if they flushed their money down the toilet. Thus, they chose to send the first half as a down payment.\u300c System: Player Flying Stone has deposited one silver into your personal storage. \u300d\u201cThe money... I\u2019ve already sent it,\u201d Stone messaged again. He was a little bit nervous. If Nie Yan really was a scammer, then their one silver would completely go to waste.\u201cThe first hurdle you\u2019ll face is by the wooden fences. There are seven Fallen Shamans in that area. Don\u2019t send your Warriors to tank. At Level 5 and under, they\u2019ll be completely unable to resist a volley from seven Fallen Shamans attacking together. Instead, send your Thief over to the willow tree outside the fence and station them there. Tell them to use their bow or crossbow to shoot at the Fallen Shamans to the left. Remember carefully; there cannot be any mistakes in where you shoot. Only then will you be able to draw out three Fallen Shamans and kill them. After you\u2019ve gotten rid of them, the remaining four should be much easier to deal with. The second important location is off to the side of the altar; there\u2019s a Fallen Shaman Priest located there. When facing him, if you\u2019re not careful you\u2019ll end up aggroing the Fallen Shaman Leader as well. Once every five minutes, the Fallen Shaman Priest will start walking around. Wait until it walks past the altar and arrives next to the obelisk. Then, have your Fighter draw it outside to about five or six meters away, where you\u2019ll surround and kill it. Afterwards, you\u2019ll be able to kill the Fallen Shaman Leader. If you still have any problems, just send me a message,\u201d Nie Yan said. This was taking another\u2019s money to help them avoid disaster. In any case, it was just a small instance. Very soon, someone would come along and beat it. So it was quite good that he managed to exchange some information for a bit of spending money. What\u2019s more, it was two entire silvers.\u201cThat\u2019s all...?\u201d Stone asked in a daze.\u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201dJust this little bit of information was worth two silvers. Nie Yan had earned this money a bit too easily.However, this method for overcoming the hurdles was summed from the experiences of countless players. An average team needed to go through this instance at least several times before they could get a feel for it. In that perspective, perhaps the guide wasn\u2019t that expensive after all.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13 - Golden Electric EelPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 13 \u2013 Golden Electric EelKalore City transfer point.At present, a group consisting of twenty or so players were gathered together in a heated discussion.\u201cI definitely think that guy\u2019s a swindler. How could he possibly know the strategy for the Fallen Shaman Camp!?\u201d\u201cThat person shouldn\u2019t be a swindler. Otherwise, how was he able to correctly guess where our party was wiped? Only by having a deep understanding of this instance, could he have known where we would fall apart.\u201dEveryone had differing opinions. Hence, it was very hard for them to come to a conclusion.\u201cStone, what\u2019s up? Has he said anything?\u201d asked a Warrior on the side. He was Sleepy Fox, the captain of the team.Stone then proceeded to pass Nie Yan\u2019s words on to them.A Priest pondered to himself for a while, before looking at his teammates and asking, \u201cDo you guys think his words are trustworthy?\u201d\u201cHard to say....\u201d replied a teammate beside him. The several hurdles they had to pass in the Fallen Shaman Camp were too difficult for them. It was to the extent that they had all been wiped out before even having a chance to encounter the Fallen Shaman Priest.\u201cWe can\u2019t say for sure whether or not this Nie Yan (Nirvana Flame) has already beaten the Fallen Shaman Camp with a team.\u201d\u201cHe really is an expert. Remember the area where I was farming, near the Fallen Shaman Camp? It was he who had told me about it. He said that he used to have a Warrior account in the past, but he deleted it and made a new Thief account. I have a feeling his old Warrior account was around Level 4 at the very least. If not, how could he know so much?\u201d Flying Stone said as he argued in Nie Yan\u2019s defense. In regards to Nie Yan\u2019s words, Stone held a firm belief in him.\u201cSo we\u2019re gonna try his method then?\u201d\u201cEveryone! Begin your preparations. We\u2019ll be setting off in ten minutes,\u201d the Priest called out as he came to a decision.\u201cBig Brother Fox, are we actually going?\u201d another Mage asked.\u201cI believe his words hold some degree of credibility. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be so knowledgeable of the Fallen Shaman instance. Let\u2019s give it a try. If that person ends up being a swindler, then I\u2019ll make him pay the price,\u201d said Sleepy Fox in a confident manner. Truth or lie, he was still able to distinguish the two. If it weren\u2019t for them getting wiped at the instance prior to this, he wouldn\u2019t have allowed Stone to contact Nie Yan for help....Nie Yan was still killing Water Spiders and gathering Fine Silk. The whole process was rather mundane and boring.He was in the middle of fighting against a Water Spider; one that was already on the verge of being defeated.\u300cHiss! Eee!\u300dThe spider let out an intense high-pitched cry.In the distance, six Water Spiders were alerted by the noise. Their movements showed that they were heading to flank Nie Yan.Simultaneously dealing with two spiders was his limit. Any more, and he had absolutely no chance of winning.Nie Yan leapt forward. With a single Vital Strike, the lone Water Spider that had been surviving on low health was killed. As the spider fell, a single copper dropped from its corpse and floated into Nie Yan\u2019s hand. By that time, the six charging Water Spiders had already neared him.Without delay, Nie Yan dived into the water below and swam towards the lake floor.Upon arriving at their destination, the six spiders skittered about on the water\u2019s surface as they tried to find traces of Nie Yan.However, Nie Yan continued to swim a fair distance away. After about a minute, he felt himself start to suffocate. He turned his head and looked up to the surface of the water. Unexpectedly, the amount of spiders roaming around his location had increased in number. If he were to go up at this moment, he would certainly die.For the sake of not drowning, Nie Yan had no choice but to activate the underwater breathing ability of the Water Aversion Pearl. He prepared to resurface after finding an area with fewer Water Spiders.A ray of light was cast down upon the lake, illuminating its serene depths. Near the lake floor, Nie Yan\u2019s eyes noticed a faint flash of golden light. His heart skipped a beat. This... it couldn\u2019t be some kind of treasure, right?In any case, the duration of the Water Aversion Pearl\u2019s ability is pretty long. Nie Yan continued his descent, diving deeper into the depths of the lake.It was deep to the extent that one could not see the bottom, and the deeper he dove, the greater the pressure he felt bearing down on his body.Strange rock formations were clustered around the surrounding lake floor. Between these rocks were dim narrow passages where one\u2019s field of view would only extend to about two meters.Best n0vel 0nline free at \u24dd(0\u24e5)\u24d4\u24db\u24d1\u24d8\u24ddNie Yan was able to see a few Black Iron Crystals and other types of ores covering the tops of these rocks. It was a pity he didn\u2019t have the Mining skill. Thus, he could only leave them be.A stream of cold water flowed between the strange rocks, battering Nie Yan\u2019s body and causing him to feel a cold chill.Suddenly, a huge gold-coloured eel came out from the rocks and swam pass Nie Yan\u2019s side.The sudden appearance caused Nie Yan to jump out in fright. When he was finally able to see it clearly, he discovered that it was a Golden Electric Eel!Just a while ago, that golden flash of light he had seen from above was actually this eel!The Golden Electric Eel was a type of rare monster that ranged from Level 0 to 20. Their temperaments were gentle and docile, so they never attacked the player first. However, if a player attacked them first, they would retaliate by using the back of their tails to release an intense electric shock. In the water, this was a powerful killing move.Though, Golden Electric Eels would normally drop some good equipment when killed. At the very least, it would be Bronze-grade.Golden Electric Eel: Level 0Health 80/80Fortunately, it was only a Level 0 Golden Electric Eel. If the level were a little higher, Nie Yan basically wouldn\u2019t stand a chance.Nie Yan swam beside the eel and followed it closely. He was trying to find weaknesses as he observed its three-meter long body.The eel didn\u2019t seem to mind Nie Yan\u2019s existence in the slightest. To the point where it even swam a few laps around his body.It had been reported that the Golden Electric eel\u2019s weak point was its neck. Nie Yan swam over to check and discovered red-coloured scales covering its neck.That\u2019s the Golden Electric Eel\u2019s weak point!Nie Yan swam with the Golden Electric Eel until they finally reached a narrow crevice between the rocks. Raising his dagger, he swiftly stabbed towards the eel. Dark red blood gushed forth as Nie Yan activated Assassinate while the dagger entered the eel\u2019s neck.\u221211The Golden Electric Eel never expected that the player beside it would attack. It struggled violently, wanting to break free from its attacker.Nie Yan firmly held onto the eel. However, its entire body was covered in a slippery mucus\u2014making it very difficult to hold onto.The Golden Electric Eel swung its tail and a powerful electric shock bombarded Nie Yan\u2019s body.\u221232When the electric current struck, it felt as if ten thousand ants were stinging him all at once. He was unable to move as he felt his whole body go numb.The Golden Electric Eel\u2019s attacks have a paralysis effect!In his absentmindedness, Nie Yan noticed that the Golden Electric Eel was trying to escape. Once again\u2014with dagger in hand\u2014he stabbed into the eel\u2019s body. The dagger was imbedded near the eel\u2019s spine.He tenaciously held onto his dagger.The Golden Electric Eel swam forward, dragging Nie Yan with it. Once again, another electric shock blasted his body, causing a damage value of twenty-three to float above his head.Golden Electric Eels were a special class of monster. They were even a bit stronger than Leader monsters. If the Eel\u2019s level had been just a little higher, then Nie Yan would have already lost his life a long time ago.Feeling himself almost lose consciousness, Nie Yan forcefully shook himself awake.The eel swam at an extremely fast pace as it moved through the narrow crevices between the rocks. Blood kept gushing forth from its wounds, dying the surrounding water red.After a while had passed, the Golden Electric Eel once again let loose an electric shock, battering Nie Yan\u2019s body and dealing sixteen damage.The amount of electricity within the Golden Electric Eel\u2019s body was limited. Consequently, the more times it released an electric shock, the weaker its power would become.The eel dragged its attacker along, unceasingly attacking him as it swam about for five or six minutes. Nie Yan\u2019s health continued to drop until he was left with only twenty-three health remaining. With great strain, he managed to use a Basic Health Potion.The repeated electrical shocks had paralyzed his whole body. Even making the slightest of movements was incredibly difficult.After finally becoming exhausted, the Golden Electric Eel stopped. Nie Yan quickly seized this opportunity. Using the dagger in his hand, he activated Vital Strike and stabbed into its neck.The Golden Electric Eel continued to struggle by wrapping itself tightly around Nie Yan. He felt himself start to suffocate with the eel completely coiled around his body.\u22125, \u22125, \u22125 One by one, these damage numbers floated above Nie Yan\u2019s head; his health had only fifteen percent remaining.Seeing his health continuously drop lower and lower, Nie Yan quickened his attacks. The dagger in his hand unceasingly stabbed at the eel\u2019s neck.\u22128, \u22128, \u22128 The Golden Electric Eel\u2019s health appeared to have finally reached zero. It gradually loosened its coil, then flipped over and revealed its white belly.Nie Yan finally broke free from the eel\u2019s hold. Using his right hand, he caught a piece of equipment that the eel had dropped\u2014a pair of gloves.Soft Leather Gloves (Bronze)Properties: UnidentifiedA Level 0 Golden Electric Eel should drop Level 0 equipment. As for the properties, I still need to go back to the city to get it appraised. However, since it\u2019s leather equipment, a Thief can definitely use it.Nie Yan placed the Soft Leather Gloves in his bagspace. Gradually, the paralysis effect on his body wore off. He also didn\u2019t know where the Golden Electric Eel had dragged him off to, so Nie Yan began swimming towards the surface.As he swam through the dark narrow crevices between the rocks, Nie Yan discovered a small plant in the distance. It danced and fluttered about as it followed the movements of the currents, lying firmly planted atop the rock.This small plant was half an inch in length, with three tile-shaped green leaves that were as soft as silk.Looking at its features... this should be Waterscale Grass!Nie Yan\u2019s eyelids jumped. There were six recipes for creating mana potions. Among these recipes, Waterscale Grass was the main ingredient out of the raw materials required to make them. Generally, the lowest tier of Mana Potion was worth around thirty coppers. Therefore, this Waterscale Grass\u2014as the main ingredient\u2014would be valued at around twenty coppers.Not far from where the Waterscale Grass was located, two red-coloured water snakes emerged.Flowerscale Water Snake: Level 3Health: 100/100Nie Yan lingered by the side for a moment, waiting for the water snakes to swim away. Only after they moved away, did he swim over to the area where the Waterscale Grass was growing. The plant resembled a gecko as it sat firmly atop a rock. Nie Yan finally plucked it and placed it in his bag.This ought to be an area where Waterscale Grass grows. Nie Yan began searching around the area, eventually finding two more Waterscale Grasses. Heh... pretty good harvest.Nie Yan swam up towards the surface until his figure broke through the water. Spending such a long time within that dark underwater environment was truly oppressive. At last, he could breathe a sigh of relief.His location was still within the Water Spider\u2019s territory. So, Nie Yan continued farming Water Spiders. By the time the game servers were about to shut down, Nie Yan had managed to pick up a Paladin skill book\u2014Divine Light Slash. This was one of the beginner skills for a Paladin. At the moment, its price should be about thirty coppers.His luck wasn\u2019t bad. The drop rate for the Divine Light Slash skill book didn\u2019t exceed one in ten thousand. Some people could end up killing Water Spiders for several days, and they still wouldn\u2019t find this skill book.\u300c System: The servers will be shutting down in three minutes. We request that all players prepare to go offline. \u300dNie Yan found an area that seemed safer than others and concealed himself within. After three minutes passed, his vision went dark.By the time he logged off the game, it was already nine in the morning. A new day had begun, and people were getting ready for work. Due to the implementation of a three hour work day\u2014one hour of work in the morning and two in the afternoon\u2014their schedules were fairly relaxed. Students, on the other hand, were beginning the day\u2019s summer recreation.After finishing breakfast, Nie Yan began to exercise. His old man\u2014having a military background\u2014had harsh and strict expectations for Nie Yan. Thus, his foundations were pretty good. Back then, he persisted for two years in tempering his body for the sake of assassinating Cao Xu. He employed special forces training that he had gotten from the internet. The training methods were extraordinarily abnormal. Due to being too old at the time, he missed the optimum period of time to train his body. Thus, the results weren\u2019t that amazing. However, he still had the ability to easily knock out two or three grown men.When referring to two or three grown men, Nie Yan was referring to adults who had at least some training. The increasing productivity had liberated people from the toils of hard labour. Thus, the modern man placed an increasing importance on elite\u2014martial and intellectual\u2014education. Beside the core academic courses, electives such as kickboxing, taekwondo, and boxing could also be taken. Since people studied martial arts from a young age, everyone\u2019s physical fitness was pretty decent. At the very least, they would know a few martial arts techniques. Today, there was a never-waning abundance of huge martial arts tournaments of all kinds. Speaking precisely, the present society is one that promotes the martial spirit.He didn\u2019t have any equipment at home, so he could only do a few basic exercises. In the future when his family would have more money, he could buy equipment and body enhancing medicines; the effects would be much more distinct.He exercised for an hour and did twenty minutes of martial arts training. Afterwards, Nie Yan began to review his schoolwork. In this day and age, making use of one\u2019s knowledge was of the utmost importance, and the knowledge contained in textbooks covered just about everything. Starting from small\u2014such as simple physics and chemistry\u2014to the large\u2014such as manufacturing polymers, aircrafts, small scale nuclear batteries, etc... all of these were covered. If he managed to put all of the knowledge within these textbooks to use, let alone manufacturing aircrafts, even constructing a mecha wouldn\u2019t be a problem at all.People in this age\u2014with advancements of bio-electric stimulation in medicine\u2014had an average IQ of a hundred and sixty or higher. On the higher end, a person\u2019s IQ was even capable of reaching two hundred and sixty. However, throughout their wholes lives, these people would still be completely unable to master all of the accumulated knowledge left behind by their predecessors.During high school, scoring fifty or sixty percent on a test paper could already be considered not bad. There wasn\u2019t a failing grade in these tests. However, every test mark would be recorded and entered into an individual\u2019s overall evaluation.Nie Yan\u2014when he was in his first and second year of high school\u2014was ranked among the top three in terms of academics. However, after he transferred from his school to a high-class one in the city, his achievements could only be ranked at the bottom. In this world, perhaps you could do plenty of things if you had money. However, knowledge is what secured a person\u2019s position indefinitely. Perhaps Nie Yan\u2019s father, using his money, could pave a future of brilliant prospects for him. Though, whether or not he was able to walk down this path... Nie Yan was still required to rely on himself.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14 - Close FriendsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 14 \u2013 Close FriendsNie Yan studied for an hour, then went back to training. Whenever he was hungry, he would take out a portioned tube of nutrition tonic from the fridge and then go back to studying. He continued this cycle of studying, training, and eating until one o\u2019clock in the afternoon.\u300cRing! Ring!\u300dThe phone in Nie Yan\u2019s home rang out.\u201cHello. May I ask who this is?\u201d Nie Yan picked up the phone and asked.\u201cNie Yan! How about we go out and play? I\u2019m almost suffocating to death by staying at home.\u201dThe voice Nie Yan had just heard belonged to Tang Yao. The pages in his memories once again began turning. Tang Yao was his best friend\u2014the two had known each other since they were in diapers. Though Tang Yao\u2019s family eventually became quite wealthy, and they moved away to the city. However, their family ended up purchasing a villa near this town. So every summer, he would come over to visit and stay for a while.Tang Yao, this person was an especially loyal friend. In Nie Yan\u2019s previous life, when he had become very poor, it was Tang Yao who braved the risks of being discovered by Cao Xu and secretly provided financial support to him. This allowed him to pass those harsh days much more easily.However, Tang Yao had one fatal weakness; he loved frequenting bars and womanizing. One time while drinking at a bar, he got into a fight with another man over a woman and ended up being beaten to death by that person. Due to the other side\u2019s background being too great, the case was left unsettled.Tang Yao, you\u2019re still alive! This is great. In this lifetime, I will definitely not let that sort of thing happen again.All of a sudden, tears began gushing forth and pouring out of Nie Yan\u2019s eyes.\u201cHello? Nie Yan, don\u2019t just die on me. Say something.\u201d\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Nie Yan asked after restraining his emotions.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the PK bar. Are you interested? Recently, this Conviction game has been really popular. Have you play it yet?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been playing. I\u2019m a Level 2 Tempest Thief,\u201d Nie Yan replied. The PK bar is a gaming and entertainment club where players can transfer their characters from the game and compete with other players in various scenarios. This type of duel wouldn\u2019t raise a player\u2019s level, nor would it affect their progress in the game. Only occasionally were players able to win one or two pieces of equipment through gambling with other players.\u201cNot bad at all! You\u2019ve already risen to Level 2. When did you buy a game helmet?\u201d Tang Yao asked, somewhat astonished. He remembered Nie Yan\u2019s family was not well-off at all.Best n0vel 0nline free at \u24dd(0\u24e5)\u24d4\u24db\u24d1\u24d8\u24dd\u201cI\u2019ve had it for some time now.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s head out then. We\u2019ll have a stroll over to the PK Lounge. I have a Level 3 Arcane Mage by the way,\u201d Tang Yao flauntingly said in a somewhat proud tone.Nie Yan faintly smiled. Eighteen- to nineteen-year-old kids all want to show off even the smallest accomplishments. Naturally, this was human nature. However, Nie Yan had already long passed that age.At the current stage, anyone who was able to rise to Level 3 was a decently skilled player. Such players were in the top ten percent of the player base. However, Nie Yan knew that Tang Yao\u2019s skills were still a bit lacking if he wanted to go to the PK Lounge. The number of experts at the lounge were not few. It was a place where all sorts of experts gathered.\u201cUs going there to play is fine. However, it\u2019s best if you don\u2019t gamble,\u201d Nie Yan said. From his memories, Tang Yao loved to gamble, yet he would never win\u2014not even once. This never dissuaded him, however, and he continued to enjoy it. Luckily, the amount of pocket money Tang Yao had wasn\u2019t very much, so losing wasn\u2019t that big of a deal. With the current teachings, the head of the family wouldn\u2019t give their child too much money. This was to avoid having that child form bad habits and become a good for nothing in the future.\u201cSince when did you become such a naggy old lady? Hurry up, I\u2019m heading downstairs.\u201d\u201cAlright then,\u201d Nie Yan reluctantly replied with a hint of helplessness in his voice. He understood Tang Yao\u2019s character. Preventing him from gambling was definitely impossible. Nie Yan only wished to remind him to show a little restraint while he was by Tang Yao\u2019s side.In his past life, there was a time when he didn\u2019t go with Tang Yao because he had fallen ill and didn\u2019t feel well. He heard that during that time Tang Yao had lost over three thousand credits.Nie Yan washed up his sweaty body, changed his clothes, and headed downstairs.\u201cThat brat, why is he still dawdling around?\u201dBy the time Nie Yan came downstairs, Tang Yao had already arrived in his hover-car and parked next to Nie Yan\u2019s house.Nie Yan pushed down the emotions stirring within his heart. He hadn\u2019t seen his friend in ages. The current Tang Yao was still the simple short little fatty he remembered. He and Nie Yan were of the same stature; it wasn\u2019t until their third year of high school that they would grow in height. The handsome and confident Tang Yao from that time was entirely different from the one currently before him.\u201cI was taking a shower.\u201d\u201cGet in the car! Hurry up! It wasn\u2019t easy slipping away, and when I get home my old man\u2019s gonna call me to help him out with his work again,\u201d Tang Yao urged.Nie Yan opened the car door and got in.\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen each other in nearly a year, huh? You brat, you still haven\u2019t grown at all.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the same too,\u201d Nie Yan said with a smile. This type of close and familiar feeling came back to him again. Tang Yao, it\u2019s been almost three years since we\u2019ve last met...\u201cI lost over a thousand at the PK Lounge yesterday. Now this Young Master is burning with anger. I definitely have to beat those several brats until they only have their underwear left,\u201d Tang Yao hatefully said. He stepped on the gas pedal, and the hover car shot forward as if it were an arrow.\u201cThose guys, were they Wei Kai\u2019s group?\u201d Nie Yan recalled. He remembered those several people were the neighbourhood bullies. When he was still going to school in this area, he was bullied a lot by them.\u201cIt was exactly them. Yesterday I wanted to vent out some anger towards them in your place,\u201d Tang Yao gloomily said.In Tang Yao\u2019s mind, Nie Yan had always been very cowardly and timid\u2014the type who didn\u2019t dare to utter a word when they were bullied. Thus, Tang Yao was always very protective of him. However, he was unaware that the present Nie Yan was no longer the previous weak and afraid person he once knew.\u201cYo! You\u2019ve arrived Young Master Tang, and just on time.\u201d An eighteen to nineteen-year-old youth came walking forward. He was dark-skinned, with a skinny build. The clothing on his body looked like it hadn\u2019t been washed in several days. Once he spoke, he gave off a delinquent type of feeling.His name was Wei Kai. Due to his dark skin\u2014a shade that would make him seem invisible during the night\u2014Nie Yan and Tang Yao had once wondered if he were of African descent. Secretly, they started only referring to him as \u201cBlack Person.\u201d A nickname which ended up spreading later on. This caused Wei Kai to direct his hate towards both Nie Yan and Tang Yao. However, he was still a little afraid of Tang Yao, as Tang Yao\u2019s father was the CEO of Linzhou Airline\u2014someone he couldn\u2019t afford to offend. Consequently, from time to time, he would look for Nie Yan to start trouble with instead.There were also five others following behind him, though they were a bit younger. They were all a part of his group.\u201cOh, this brat Nie Yan also came. Tsk, tsk. He still hasn\u2019t learned enough of a lesson from last time.\u201dThose several brats grinned maliciously as they stared at Nie Yan.In his previous life, Nie Yan heard that Wei Kai caused some trouble and was exiled to another planet. Afterwards, there was no more word of him. The current Nie Yan, after reincarnating, could barely be bothered to keep these few delinquents in his mind. Regarding the bullying he received back then, what meaning was there for him to collect his debts now?\u201cNo need to worry, you have me here with you. They won\u2019t dare do anything to you.\u201d Tang Yao spoke in a low voice and attempted to comfort Nie Yan.Nie Yan nodded his head.Tang Yao couldn\u2019t help but look at Nie Yan. The latter seemed especially calm today. This brat. Looks like he finally gained some courage.\u201cLess bullshit. Did you bring the money?\u201d Tang Yao said to Wei Kai.\u201cNo worries, I brought two thousand. However, you\u2019ll be the one paying for our entry fee today.\u201d Wei Kai took out a bank card, shaking it in his hand.\u201cOnly a hundred or so credits and you\u2019re making such a hassle about it.\u201d Tang Yao slanted his lips in disdain as ruthless words came out of his mouth.\u201cI\u2019m not like Young Master Tang right here who\u2019s so well-off with money. Our little group of commoners has no choice but to bother about this small amount of money,\u201d Wei Kai smilingly replied without the slightest bit of anger.From an adult\u2019s perspective, Nie Yan reexamined Wei Kai. He discovered Wei Kai, although simply a delinquent, still carried an air of shrewdness about him. There were many people like Wei Kai, fumbling through society, gaining a lot of knowledge and experience along the way.\u201cGod damn. Isn\u2019t it just him having a rich old man? What\u2019s so amazing about that?\u201dThe several youngsters behind Wei Kai couldn\u2019t bear Tang Yao anymore, and began cursing at him one after another.Tang Yao treated his friends very well. The reason his words were so unkind today was most likely because of Wei Kai and his group frequently bullying Nie Yan.Tang Yao ignored those several youngsters and walked up to the counter. He took out two hundred credits, placed them on the reception desk and then said, \u201cBoss, open up a private room for us. No need to return the change. Also, have the attendants send some drinks over. No coke please.\u201d\u201cRoom number six. This is the card for your room.\u201d The manager handed over a card to Tang Yao as he spoke.\u201cPlease. You lead the way, Young Master Tang,\u201d Wei Kai said while laughing. Then briefly, he swept his gaze towards Nie Yan. Their eyes locked, as they met face to face. Nie Yan stared back at him calmly.Wei Kai was mildly surprised. Today, Nie Yan appeared to be distinctly different than how he was in the past. Previously, whenever Nie Yan met him, he would be timid and afraid. Yet today, he was unusually calm.The group of people went over to room number six.Nie Yan and the rest entered the room. The interior was separated into two areas. Each area had five platforms with recliners and machines. Players could hold 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5 battles. If they wanted to hold larger team battles, they were required to rent out a larger room.Nie Yan and Tang Yao entered one area and closed the door. Their area and Wei Kai\u2019s were separated by a glass wall.\u201cWhat level is Wei Kai?\u201d Nie Yan asked Tang Yao.\u201cA Level 3 Berserker,\u201d Tang Yao replied. Yesterday they had fought ten matches, and Tang Yao only won three of them. After he returned home, he had his father\u2019s underling find him an Arcane Blast skill book, as well as a Bronze-grade mage robe which he exchanged for his own. He was well prepared to beat Wei Kai in a few matches, and thoroughly return all the losses he had received yesterday.Ten matches. The prize for every match was two hundred.\u201cWhat skills do you have?\u201d Nie Yan asked. For good or bad, Nie Yan had played Conviction for many years. Even if you\u2019ve never eaten pork, you\u2019d still be able to recognize a pig. So although he never played Arcane Mage before, he had faced them countless times in battle. As such, he somewhat understood their abilities.\u201cArcane Missiles, Arcane Fireball, Arcane Blaze, Arcane Blast, and Magic Return.\u201d Tang Yao spoke without thinking. He never considered Nie Yan to know a lot about Conviction, as he had already trained up to Level 3, while Nie Yan was only Level 2.\u201cWhat\u2019s your health and mana?\u201d\u201cOne hundred and twenty health, and one hundred and fifty mana,\u201d Tang Yao replied. His equipment could be considered decent for a Level 3 Arcane Mage.\u201cHas Wei Kai learned Provoke yet?\u201d Nie Yan asked. He was really confused. With this set of skills, just how did Tang Yao manage to lose in his previous life?\u201cHe\u2019s learned it.\u201d\u201cNo wonder.\u201d Nie Yan suddenly understood. After a Berserker learns Provoke, if they were able to use the skill well, they could easily suppress an Arcane Mage.\u201cIt\u2019s about to begin,\u201d Tang Yao said as he put on his game helmet.Tang Yao was most likely going to lose. Nie Yan thought for a bit. He would continue observing for a while more. If Tang Yao started losing badly, then he would make a move.They swiped their IDs over the machine and then put on their game helmets. The machines here would automatically extract the player\u2019s character information from Conviction and duplicate it. They were able to conduct battles here, and since the data was only a copy, it would have no relation with Conviction.Everyone entered the game. Nie Yan and those five youngsters were placed in an auditorium, and the arena chosen was random. It appeared the first one would be in the mountains.The mountainous terrain was especially advantageous for Arcane Mages.Tang Yao and Wei Kai both finished their preparations. Following the sound of a system prompt, the two began the battle.\u201cHey, brat. Long time no see. A Level 2 Tempest Thief huh, not bad. Are you interested in having a match?\u201d The one who spoke was one of the boys from Wei Kai\u2019s group. Nie Yan faintly remembered that this guy\u2019s name was Shi Feng (Stone Mountain).A Level 2 Battle Thief!There was an essential difference between Battle Thieves and Tempest Thieves. Battle Thieves had a more elegant title called Knight-errants. They were the same as Tempest Thieves in that they both had the Stealth skill. However, when fighting, they placed a greater emphasis on combat. Usually, they used weapons such as daggers and had decent close combat abilities.The properties of classes are all unique. There was no division of strongest and weakest classes. Conviction had no weak classes\u2014only weak players.Nie Yan shot a glance at Shi Feng and said with indifference, \u201cYou\u2019re still unworthy. Picking such a skilless class like a Knight-errant, you have poor tastes.\u201d\u201cSeems you\u2019re missing a beating. Do you believe this grandfather won\u2019t give you one once we leave the game?\u201d Shi Feng cursed back at him. He didn\u2019t expect that Nie Yan\u2014who had always been a yes-man\u2014would dare to speak rudely to him.Nie Yan raised his eyebrow. They were just a few brats, nothing more. What did he have to fear? Even though his current body\u2019s health was a little weak\u2014to the point where it was poles apart from his previous peak condition\u2014by relying on his fighting skills, he would be able to deal with these kids who had barely reached adulthood, and still have energy left to spare. These good-for-nothings were a level inferior to Wei Kai. They were still a bunch of students, yet they dressed like delinquents and poured obscenities out of their mouths\u2014thinking of themselves as gangsters. They were very childish. Though, in reality, being a gangster was also a type of class that required skill to make a living.\u201cIf you have the guts, then come out and fight me next match.\u201d\u201cOnly one match? The stakes for this gamble are too small. I\u2019m not that interested,\u201d Nie Yan said. Wasn\u2019t it too simple of a task to take care of Shi Feng?\u201cThe brat\u2019s grown up, huh? I have three hundred here on me. Let\u2019s have a match. How about it?\u201d Shi Feng took out a bank card. Nie Yan, this brat\u2019s becoming more and more courageous. If I don\u2019t teach him a lesson, he truly won\u2019t know how high the heavens are and how thick the earth is.\u201cI\u2019ll only play one game. I\u2019ve got seven hundred.\u201d Nie Yan brought out his bank card. He swiped it to show the amount of money in the card was seven hundred credits. This amount of money\u2014to the eighteen-year-old Nie Yan\u2014was an amazingly huge sum of money.\u201cAny of you guys have money? Lend me a few hundred.\u201d Shi Feng turned his head and spoke to the friends beside him.\u201cI\u2019ve got two hundred.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve got a hundred.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve also got a hundred.\u201dAfter borrowing four hundred, Shi Feng finally had seven hundred credits. He hung out with Wei Kai, but after all, he was still a delinquent and never had much money on him.Nie Yan glanced at Tang Yao and Wei Kai\u2019s battle. In the mountainous terrain, Wei Kai wasn\u2019t able to fully display his Berserker\u2019s abilities, and the match was won by Tang Yao. The next match was in open plains. Tang Yao would likely lose this one.\u201cLet\u2019s go then.\u201d Nie Yan withdrew his glance, then spoke to Shi Feng.The scenery of the two people switched over. Soon, they appeared in a jungle. Thick vegetation surrounded them everywhere, and the two were separated by about fifty meters.\u201cLittle brat. Watch this grandpa teach you how to respect others.\u201dNie Yan faintly laughed. He didn\u2019t even bother having a verbal showdown with Shi Feng.Shi Feng muttered, whispering to himself, \u201cWhy is Nie Yan giving off a feeling that would make others feel unsettled today?\u201d\u300c System: Match start! \u300dNie Yan and Shi Feng both activated Stealth.Stealth didn\u2019t equal invisibility. When a Thief entered stealth, their body would melt into the background. If one didn\u2019t observe carefully, it was really hard to detect. However, if one concentrated their attention, they could still make out the flaws in the camouflage.Stealth was based on a Thief\u2019s Dexterity and their ability to hide themselves. Being discovered would depend on the other player\u2019s eyesight.At this time, the two were approaching each other. Nie Yan\u2019s footsteps were light and gentle. If he came across leaves and branches, he would carefully move around them. He left no footprints behind. After playing Thief for so many years, if he were to be discovered by a novice like Shi Feng, he\u2019d be losing too much face. Nie Yan\u2019s eyes moved like electricity as he scanned the area. On a branch in the far distance, there was a trace of unusual movement. Focusing his gaze, he was able to distinctly make out the vague figure of a person. He had quickly discovered his opponent\u2019s position.Shi Feng was moving about slowly and cautiously, carefully paying attention to his surroundings. However, to him, it seemed as if Nie Yan had disappeared completely. Shi Feng couldn\u2019t find any traces of him whatsoever.A Thief\u2019s ability to conceal themselves was very closely related to their surroundings. The more complex the background, the easier it would be to find them. However, if the background were simple and only had one colour, even if the enemy carefully observed, it would be very hard to discover them.Just like a stick insect sticking to bamboo, they would completely melt into the background. Even if a predator came up close to it, they would still be unable to discover anything.Stealth\u2019s effectiveness was also greatly related to a player\u2019s ability to control their movements. While in stealth, the route and pace you walked in were all things that required very careful attention.For Nie Yan, he basically didn\u2019t need to conceal himself in such a meticulous manner. The motions of concealing himself had become instinctive to him. These movements had long penetrated through the core of his being, down to the bone marrow.After ten years playing as a Thief, even an idiot would still turn into an expert, let alone Nie Yan\u2014whose comprehension abilities could already be regarded as quite decent.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 - Viewed in a New LightPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 15 \u2013 Viewed in a New LightShi Feng brushed Nie Yan\u2019s side. Though, unexpectedly, he had moved past without noticing his opponent.\u201cDammit... Where is that brat?\u201d Shi Feng muttered under his breath. He had yet to realize that he had already been exposed.Nie Yan trailed behind Shi Feng, following him closely. His gaze was focused on the area around Shi Feng\u2019s back.The dagger in Nie Yan\u2019s right hand resembled lightning as it swiftly stabbed towards the back of his unsuspecting victim.By the time Shi Feng felt something wasn\u2019t right, it was too late. Nie Yan\u2019s dagger had already arrived, penetrating deeply into Shi Feng\u2019s back.\u300cShlink! Splurt!\u300dThe dagger easily cut into him, dealing thirty-one points of damage to Shi Feng. Evidently, his defense stat wasn\u2019t very high.One attacked, and the other was being attacked. Immediately, the effects of Stealth for both players disappeared simultaneously.Having finally discovered his assailant, Shi Feng turned around and retaliated. He slashed back at Nie Yan, sweeping his dagger in a wide arc.Shi Feng\u2019s dagger seemed to be just a bit short in length. However, that lack in blade length signified a miss as his dagger passed by Nie Yan.Best n0vel 0nline free at \u24dd(0\u24e5)\u24d4\u24db\u24d1\u24d8\u24dd\u201cVital Strike!\u201dNie Yan\u2019s dagger seemed to carry a cold glint as it streaked through the air, slitting Shi Feng\u2019s throat.\u300c System: Vital Strike successful! Attack +5%, resulting in additional damage dealt! \u300dIn one fell swoop, the seventy-nine health Shi Feng had remaining was instantly depleted. His eyes were filled with disbelief as if he had seen a ghost.\u300cThud.\u300dHis body collapsed onto the jungle floor.The entire course of events had taken place in merely a few seconds. Nie Yan still had full health remaining.The corner of Nie Yan\u2019s mouth faintly curved into a sneer. He wasn\u2019t required to showcase even the least of his abilities to deal with this novice Level 2 Knight-errant.Both of them were returned to the auditorium at the same time.\u201cShi Feng, what the hell happened?\u201d\u201cJust how... how did it end so quickly...?\u201dThe several youths encircled Shi Feng and began asking questions. On the video screen, they saw the figures of both Nie Yan and Shi Feng in combat after they had come out of stealth. In that fleeting moment, they were basically unable to clearly see, nor understand, what had occurred near the end. Within the blink of an eye\u2014in simply a few exchanges\u2014Shi Feng had already collapsed on the ground.\u201cHis movements were really fast.\u201d Shi Feng recalled their earlier exchange. Nie Yan had only made a few simple movements, yet his speed was simply unbelievable. Moreover, Nie Yan had killed him in two strikes; one of them hitting him in the vitals. Inside the game, the system would assist a player\u2019s movements when executing skills. However, when it came to reaction speed, judgement, and so on, all of them relied on the player\u2019s own capabilities. Shi Feng had a hard time imagining what sort of disastrous outcome would occur if the two of them were to end up fighting in real life, especially if Nie Yan had a blade in his hand.As he stared at that person\u2019s figure, Shi Feng recalled all the times they went to him looking for trouble. He remembered how that person would always grin and bear through their humiliation without a hint of resistance. If that same person from the past had always been faking it... now that would be truly too terrifying. As he thought back to that dagger in Nie Yan\u2019s hand, Shi Feng felt a cold chill run through his heart.\u201cI lost.\u201d At that moment, Shi Feng didn\u2019t dare to refute his defeat. The facts were arranged right before everyone\u2019s eyes. Furthermore, he had also lost to Nie Yan\u2019s boldness during the fight.There was no need to fear those who acted arrogant and tyrannical. In reality, their tough appearances were merely poor disguises; Shi Feng was one such person. What people like him feared the most were those who possessed great strength and could endure without ever wavering.Shi Feng began to think of Fourth Elder Lei who opened a restaurant in Gatehead Village. He truly was an amiable and gentle person. In the past, this area used to have a bunch of gangsters who would frequently go to his place. There they would freeload food and vandalize the restaurant. Fourth Elder Lei had always let them do what they wanted, bearing through their humiliation. There was a time when Shi Feng had gone to his restaurant in order to freeload food with ten or so other people. By chance, they ended up meeting his daughter who had just returned. Fourth Elder Lei had grown into a hunchback, but that daughter of his was actually fairly lively and beautiful. Several of them couldn\u2019t resist trying to get their hands on his daughter.Fourth Elder Lei begged for mercy, but those gangsters wouldn\u2019t have it. They started to tear off his daughter\u2019s clothes which enraged Fourth Elder Lei. He grabbed his kitchen knife and cut down three of those gangsters\u2014they were instantly killed on the spot. Then, with his knife, he chopped off Boss Yin\u2019s arm. Fourth Elder Lei\u2019s whole body was covered in blood, yet he remained calm and unperturbed, allowing the customers on the side to call the police. At that time, Shi Feng was so frightened he nearly urinated in his pants.Since Fourth Elder Lei had acted in self-defense, he was only sentenced to half a year in jail. After that, no one dared to cause trouble at his restaurant, nor lay a hand on his daughter again.People who could endure silently were the most terrifying. It was because if they were to snap one day, they would reveal their full ferocity\u2014becoming fiercer than anyone else. Remembering the scene of that day, Shi Feng felt his body break out in a cold sweat.After experiencing something like that, Shi Feng had honestly and properly behaved himself for a while. Afterward, however, he began following Wei Kai\u2019s group. After experiencing the fight today, his whole body began to quiver. If they were to bully Nie Yan and push him to the brink one day, would he snap just as Fourth Elder Lei had? Would Nie Yan grab a blade and ruthlessly slash their throats akin to what Shi Feng had just experienced in the game?\u201cIn the future, it\u2019ll be better if we don\u2019t provoke that guy anymore. He\u2019s definitely hard to deal with.\u201d Shi Feng warned the several people beside him in a solemn manner.\u201cShi Feng! You can\u2019t be terrified after losing just one match, can you? From now on, we don\u2019t know each other.\u201d One of the youths by his side cursed at him. The others around him had also exposed expressions of disdain.\u201cI\u2019ll still pay you guys back the money. As for the loss, it\u2019s no big deal anyway,\u201d Shi Feng said. He suddenly understood. Although people like them felt good when they often bullied others, there would come a day when all their debts are repaid in full\u2014just like that matter with Fourth Elder Lei. On that day, Boss Yin lost both his arm and his position as the boss. Now he could only make a living by scavenging for trash. As for those three gangsters who were cut down, they couldn\u2019t even make a living as they had lost their lives.\u201cGet out. Scram.\u201dNie Yan no longer paid attention to Shi Feng and the others. He continued looking at the scene of the match. The competition between Tang Yao and Wei Kai was still in the second round. Since it was on an open field, this time, Tang Yao had lost his advantage. Eventually, he was killed by the slash of Wei Kai wielding his sword.One after another, the matches continued. After they had finished ten matches, Tang Yao had won two, while Wei Kai had won eight. As a result, Tang Yao lost a thousand and two hundred credits.\u201cF*ck, Wei Kai that bastard also learned a new skill. This time, it\u2019s the Berserker skill, Resist Magic Aura. This beating is truly depressing,\u201d Tang Yao said while he fumed with anger. Resist Magic Aura increased the player\u2019s magic resistance. A Berserker with this skill was practically the bane of all Mages.\u201cYou know, Resist Magic Aura only decreases your damage by a little bit. When you\u2019re PvPing as an Arcane Mage, your movements need to be quick. Secondly, you need to keep your mana expenditure at a stable rate. Third, your reactions have to be fast as well. Furthermore, when you were fighting, your timing for casting spells was incorrect,\u201d Nie Yan advised. In terms of strength, Tang Yao\u2019s Arcane Mage was stronger than Wei Kai\u2019s Berserker by a lot. The reason Tang Yao lost wasn\u2019t because Wei Kai was more skilled than him by any means. Rather, it was because Arcane Mages had a higher skill cap. A skilled Arcane Mage could effortlessly toy a Berserker of the same level to death. However, an unskilled Arcane Mage would easily be hacked to death by a Berserker of the same level. Simple professions like Berserkers, which were tanky hack and slashers, didn\u2019t require much skill to play at all.\u201cYou brat! I didn\u2019t expect that you knew so much,\u201d Tang Yao said in admiration. In retrospect, Nie Yan\u2019s words made quite some sense.After pushing open the door, Wei Kai and his group came over from the other side with Shi Feng following from behind. The latter glanced at Nie Yan with a somewhat complicated expression on his face.\u201cYoung Master Tang, it seems that your brother here is growing up more and more. Surprisingly, he even defeated Shi Feng.\u201d Wei Kai\u2019s narrow and slender eyes glanced over towards Nie Yan. In the past, Nie Yan had always been a well-behaved punching bag. Indeed, it appeared the Nie Yan of today and the Nie Yan from the past just weren\u2019t the same. Be it expression or temperament, there was quite a large change in both.Wei Kai switched the video on the screen over to the time when Nie Yan defeated Shi Feng in their fight. Afterward, he played it back in slow motion. The entire fight had concluded within three seconds. Looking at the screen, Nie Yan\u2019s movements and attacks were flawless and watertight.After watching the video, Tang Yao stared at Nie Yan with an astonished gaze, as if what he had seen was unimaginable. This brother of his, just when had he become so courageous and powerful?\u201cJust a few moments ago, you had a match with Shi Feng?\u201d Tang Yao was a little dazed. He still didn\u2019t dare to believe that person in the video was Nie Yan.\u201cJust a small match. He was too weak, though,\u201d Nie Yan replied in an unrestrained manner, not minding the people near him at all.Wei Kai gave a meaningful glance, signaling the youth who wore a flower pattern shirt next to him.This action caught Nie Yan\u2019s eye. That person was called Li Yang\u2014Wei Kai\u2019s right-hand man.\u201cBrat! Don\u2019t get too conceited. Do you believe I can\u2019t beat you down?\u201d Li Yang approached Nie Yan and came at him with a kick. His age was one or two years younger than Nie Yan, however, he was taller and more robust in comparison.Nie Yan was a little short. Combined with his poor nutrition, he was also very thin and weak.Nie Yan coldly smiled, then dodged Li Yang\u2019s attack. He followed up by kicking Li Yang\u2019s supporting leg, stamping on the knee joint. He was no longer the same youth who had been so easily bullied in the past.His current strength was not one bit inferior to a second grade mixed martial artist. It was just that his body was still weak. However, when it came to dealing with wannabe gangsters like them, he had more than enough energy to spare.\u201cAhhhh!\u201d Li Yang let out a miserable shriek as he reeled back, stumbled, and then fell.That blood-curdling scream sent chills through the hearts of everyone who witnessed this scene.With this show of force, Shi Feng was reminded of Fourth Elder Lei. At that moment, he felt becoming an obedient student at school would be quite a wonderful and fortunate idea.\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201d The several youths behind Wei Kai wanted to charge in and give Nie Yan a painful and thorough beating. However, they were all pulled back by Wei Kai.Li Yang\u2019s prior actions were simply Wei Kai\u2019s way of probing Nie Yan. Though admittedly, he was also greatly surprised. Unexpectedly, the timid and cowardly Nie Yan\u2014who was always grinning and bearing through humiliation\u2014actually had this kind of skill. From his experience, he had only seen those kinds of quick movements from a few people. Martial arts wasn\u2019t something one could quickly improve in only two or three days. It required long periods of training. Only then would one be able to slowly improve. Could it be...? Nie Yan\u2019s cowardice in the past, was it all just an act?Why is it that no matter how I look at him, Nie Yan seems completely different today?Ignoring Li Yang who was still clutching his leg and screaming on the floor, Wei Kai walked up to Nie Yan and said, \u201cYoung Master Nie, are you interested in playing a match?\u201d He had even changed the way he addressed Nie Yan. After drifting through society for so long, he knew which kinds of people he could touch, and which he could not. Nie Yan had just revealed his skill, and completely put Wei Kai in awe.\u201cThere\u2019s no harm in playing one or two matches. However, I won\u2019t play if the stakes are too small.\u201d Inwardly, Nie Yan felt unavoidably shocked\u2014this Wei Kai was quite a character. The criminal bosses of the underworld acted outwardly kind in appearance, but commit evil deeds in secret. In addition, many of them would reveal astonishing talents when they were at a very young age, fostering them as they grew older. In his past life, he heard Wei Kai had actually become pretty well regarded. It was only until later on when he invaded another criminal organization\u2019s territory and caused a major event, did he disappear without a trace.\u201cA thousand a match. I have three thousand,\u201d Wei Kai said. He had brought out all the money he had.\u201cThat\u2019s too unfair. A Level 3 Berserker facing a Level 2 Tempest Thief, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re bullying people too much?\u201d Tang Yao said in a dissatisfied manner. There was a difference in level, and it was a heavily armoured Warrior versus a lightly armored Thief. It was obvious which side was superior.\u201c\u2014Three thousand a match.\u201d Nie Yan interrupted Tang Yao\u2019s complaints and spoke to Wei Kai.\u201cFine. I\u2019ll keep you company then,\u201d Wei Kai replied. He didn\u2019t believe a Level 2 Tempest Thief was capable of turning the tables on him.\u201cNie Yan, Have you gone mad!?\u201d Tang Yao anxiously said. A Level 2 Tempest Thief versus a Level 3 Berserker; unless he was a Heaven-defying expert who could bypass the level gap, he would definitely lose this match.\u201cI only have fourteen hundred on me. Lend me sixteen hundred,\u201d Nie Yan said to Tang Yao while laughing.\u201cGod dammit. If you lose, it\u2019s whatever. You still have to pay me back, though!\u201d Tang Yao angrily muttered back.\u201cI\u2019ll pay you back,\u201d Nie Yan said. Although Tang Yao\u2019s old man was wealthy, he still didn\u2019t get a lot of pocket money. Not to mention, it would all be earned through working for his dad. In this era, all high-class elites would educate their children in this way, making them earn their own living and become self-reliant.\u201cBullshit. If you want to lose, just lose. Who wants you to pay them back anyways.\u201d Tang Yao swiped his card, transferring over sixteen hundred credits to Nie Yan.\u201cThanks,\u201d Nie Yan said. Tang Yao was the type of person who had a sharp tongue, but a soft heart. If Nie Yan lost, Tang Yao definitely wouldn\u2019t allow Nie Yan to pay him back those thousand six hundred credits.In his past life, Nie Yan had received too much of Tang Yao\u2019s grace. He had never once thought of letting Nie Yan pay him back. This is what a true brother should be like.\u201cPull Li Yang up, we\u2019re leaving,\u201d Wei Kai said. The group of people headed back to their respective area in the room.\u201cNie Yan, that brat! How did he suddenly become capable of fighting? God dammit... it hurts like hell. Next time I\u2019ll definitely find some people to beat that shitty brat to death.\u201d Li Yang walked over to the sofa and rolled up his pant leg. A large area on his knee was bruised completely black and blue.\u201cDon\u2019t waste your breath, he didn\u2019t even use any strength. Otherwise, your leg would\u2019ve been broken. I want you guys to remember this from now on. No one is to provoke Nie Yan. If you meet him, I want you to hide far away. If any one of you stirs up trouble for me, don\u2019t blame me for not being polite!\u201d Wei Kai warned. Their school taught Taekwondo, boxing, and mixed martial arts as academic programs. He was able to make out that the movements Nie Yan had made were standard in mixed martial arts. However, in comparison to the mixed martial arts that was taught in school, his movements were much more fierce and violent. When he took action, every movement would either cause serious, or even fatal, damage. Just what kind of person is this brat?He began to recall Nie Yan\u2019s former cowardly and timid manner. That guy\u2019s thoughts are really deep and mysterious. He was actually able to conceal himself for this long. Wei Kai felt a wave of coldness pour over his heart.\u201cHow can we just let it pass?\u201d Li Yang unwillingly asked.\u201cSo...? What about it? You ask yourself, are you capable of beating him? In the future, properly go to your Taekwondo classes, and you won\u2019t lose so miserably next time!\u201d Wei Kai replied.\u201cBoss, it\u2019s about to start.\u201d A youth next to him spoke.Wei Kai put on his helmet.In the adjacent area, Tang Yao was carefully observing Nie Yan. After a long while, he finally spoke. \u201cJust a moment ago, I was being stupid and forgot to ask. Brat, you\u2019re actually not too bad! When did you become so strong!? One move and you had Li Yang knocked down and rolling on the floor!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been training at home for a while now. It\u2019s more than enough to deal with those guys,\u201d Nie Yan said. His body\u2019s strength really was too weak, otherwise, his power wouldn\u2019t be this little. Li Yang and those good for nothings were like a bunch of pillows. Only Wei Kai would be a bit difficult to deal with. Even then, he still wasn\u2019t much of an opponent.\u201cYou brat. You\u2019ve certainly made me look at you in a new light. I\u2019m still suspicious of whether or not you\u2019re the same Nie Yan I\u2019ve known since childhood!\u201d Tang Yao said in quite a good mood.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how much I change, you\u2019re still going to be my brother!\u201d Nie Yan proclaimed. In his past life, even when he was at the lowest point of his life, Tang Yao still viewed him as a brother. Just as distance would determine the stamina of a horse, time would eventually reveal a person\u2019s true nature.\u201cFor the sake of those words, let\u2019s properly have a toast when we get back!\u201d Tang Yao said while patting Nie Yan on the shoulder.\u201cWei Kai\u2019s already waiting inside the game.\u201d\u201cAre you sure you can win?\u201d Tan Yao anxiously asked.\u201cNo worries, just watch and see. What? Could it be you don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll pay you back that thousand six hundred...?\u201d Nie Yan laughed, joking around with Tang Yao.\u201cGo have your match. As for money, that kind of thing is useless to me. Even if you lose, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s the end of the world. Besides, you don\u2019t get much of an allowance every month anyways... If you end up losing that fourteen hundred, you\u2019ll be eating boiled rice for a whole month, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d [1]\u201cWatch as I toy this Level 3 Berserker to death!\u201d Nie Yan said with a confident smile.\u201cGood man! You\u2019re getting wilder and wilder!\u201d Tang Yao laughed.Two people wore their helmets and entered the game.When he reemerged, the stage Nie Yan appeared in was an open prairie. There was an endless field of lush green grass. The dense underbrush was tall\u2014roughly reaching up to a person\u2019s knees.My luck is pretty bad. Turns out it\u2019s a grassland stage, thought Nie Yan as he knitted his brows. However, even if he were in the open fields, he still had his tactics. The green background of the grassland served as good camouflage for a Thief to conceal themselves with. The only flaw was that the dense undergrowth on the ground could possibly expose his whereabouts.\u201cThe current stage is an open field. If you think it\u2019s unfair, we can switch stages,\u201d Wei Kai suggested. There would be a large amount of luck involved if they were only playing a single match. Different terrains suited different professions, and the open prairie suited Warrior professions such as the Berserker\u2014who could freely charge around swinging their swords.Although Wei Kai was a bully, he surprisingly acted in a magnanimous manner.\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. If it\u2019s an open field, it\u2019s an open field.\u201d Nie Yan grasped his dagger and entered stealth. His opinion of Wei Kai had actually changed by quite a bit.A gentle breeze blew past the open prairie, causing the tall grasses to bend in its direction. Gradually, Nie Yan\u2019s silhouette faded into the background.He has this much ability? Wei Kai felt his heart sink; his expression becoming solemn. He was observing carefully, yet he couldn\u2019t find any traces of Nie Yan\u2019s whereabouts. He wasn\u2019t even able to find any peculiarities with the thick grass on the ground either.Nie Yan did indeed have some skill. Wei Kai grasped onto his greatsword and gradually drew closer. The shorter the distance between them, the easier it would be for him to find his opponent.Nie Yan walked alongside the wind, continuously changing direction in accordance with it. Even if he were to step on the grass, it would slant in the same direction the wind was blowing[1] Boiled rice is sort of like rice gruel. Putting already cooked rice in hot water and eating it like that. Pretty bland and tasteless. It\u2019s usually eaten by the poor.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16 - Arrogant Before, Respectful After!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 16 \u2013 Arrogant Before, Respectful After!Seeing Wei Kai draw near, Nie Yan gradually made his way around his opponent. He continued to slowly move until he was behind Wei Kai, and out of his range of vision. Then he began creeping towards his unsuspecting opponent\u2019s back, taking long and unhurried steps as he did so.Wei Kai turned his head, surveying the area in every direction. He was unable to find anything particularly odd. All he could see were endless fields of grass rolling about gently under the influence of the wind, like waves following the ocean breeze.Where the hell could he be?This was the first time Wei Kai had come across a Tempest Thief who was actually able to employ Stealth to such a perfect extent. It was reasonable to say that the thick grass beneath Wei Kai\u2019s feet was an easy place for a Thief to expose themselves. Yet, Nie Yan seemed to have no issues hiding in the field with the assistance of Stealth.Wei Kai carefully moved forward with his greatsword held close to his chest, keeping it at the ready. He believed that Nie Yan must\u2019ve been moving at an extremely slow pace, in order to remain unexposed while stealthed. Hence, he came to the conclusion that Nie Yan was most likely some distance ahead of him.However, he remained unaware of the fact that Nie Yan was already behind him, having circled around a long time ago.Approximately three meters were between Nie Yan and Wei Kai\u2019s back. Suddenly, a large gust of wind blew forth, turning the gentle breeze into a howling gale.Just as the wind began to howl\u2014as if he had been waiting for that exact moment\u2014Nie Yan abruptly sprinted forwards. The dagger in his grasp resembled lightning as it struck out, speeding towards Wei Kai\u2019s back.The sound of rapid footsteps and howling wind blended together, creating a mess of sounds that was hard for a person to distinguish. The gust of wind also greatly reduced Wei Kai\u2019s awareness.Assassinate!Nie Yan\u2019s dagger pierced into his target\u2019s back, dealing thirty-five points of damage.Wei Kai never expected his opponent to suddenly appear behind him. He held up the greatsword and swept outwards in a wide slash.Nie Yan dodged the strike and managed to reposition himself behind Wei Kai once again. He dashed forward, dagger in hand, and stabbed Wei Kai in the back for the second time\u2014causing him to lose twenty-three health.Out of the hundred and sixty health he had, only a little over a hundred points remained. Since the beginning of the fight, Wei Kai had been completely incapable of keeping up with Nie Yan\u2019s speed.A Berserker\u2019s speed relied on their ability to quickly charge forward. A Thief\u2019s speed, on the other hand, relied greatly on their ability to make agile and nimble movements. The type of movements the two professions specialized in clearly differed.Nie Yan\u2019s movements were fast and agile, as he stuck close to Wei Kai\u2019s back. In this short period of time, he had already managed to attack Wei Kai two times in quick succession.This bastard is as nimble as a monkey. Wei Kai suddenly roared in anger. An aura began radiating from his greatsword as he started spinning around in circles.\u201cWhirlwind Slash!\u201dWei Kai resembled a top as he spun around with his greatsword.The moment Wei Kai brandished his sword, Nie Yan judged from the movements that Wei Kai was about to execute Whirlwind Slash, so he quickly retreated back about two meters.The greatsword unleashed a strong gust of wind as it streaked through the air. The slash barely grazed past Nie Yan, almost directly hitting him.\u22129 A damage value floated over his head.Despite missing, the Whirlwind Slash still managed to cause some damage to Nie Yan.Wei Kai\u2019s attack finally ended after he had rotated three times. He gasped for breath as he thought, This bastard is so quick at dodging!In the split second Wei Kai stopped spinning with his sword, Nie Yan dashed forward; the dagger in his hand aiming straight for Wei Kai\u2019s throat\u2014 Vital Strike!Tang Yao, Li Yang, and the others were watching the match from outside with dumbstruck expressions. Nie Yan\u2019s movements were simply a perfection of art. From the moment he escaped Wei Kai\u2019s Whirlwind Slash, to when he attacked with Vital Strike as it ended, the timing of his every action was at the peak of perfection.After watching Nie Yan, they now understood what PvPing truly meant. It wasn\u2019t two opposing sides simply slashing their swords at each other, but rather a battle of awareness and skill.Within his mind, Tang Yao had a sudden flash of insight. He finally understood why Nie Yan said that his timing when casting spells was incorrect. Depending on whether or not a player took action at the right time, two entirely different outcomes could arise.He never expected that Nie Yan, whom he had known and grown up with since they were in diapers, would possess this kind of skill. The amount of skill Nie Yan displayed really expanded Tang Yao\u2019s horizons. There was a saying: \u201cWhen a scholar disappears for three days, view them in a greater light.\u201d These words were the most appropriate to describe what Tang Yao was feeling at the moment.Nie Yan\u2019s dagger slashed across Wei Kai\u2019s throat!\u221295Vital Strike was still as powerful as ever. In just a few attacks, Wei Kai had already been reduced to a mere seven health. Meanwhile, Nie Yan\u2019s health was still close to full. It was clear which side had established their superiority.It was only then that Wei Kai realized the immense gap between the two of them.\u201cFlame Slash!\u201dWei Kai was unwilling to be defeated in such a manner. Just as Nie Yan\u2019s Vital Strike ended, he took advantage of the opening that was revealed and brandished his sword towards Nie Yan. The greatsword in his grasp was enveloped by a raging flame as it cleaved downwards in a blazing radianceThe raging heat assaulted his face as it drew closer.The might of a Berserker\u2019s Flame Slash was immense. Nie Yan deeply understood this as a result of firsthand experience. He decisively pulled back, in an attempt to avoid the sharp blade.Despite this, Wei Kai still managed to catch up to Nie Yan after suddenly accelerating his pace, and the Flame Slash struck him right in the middle of his chest.Best n0vel 0nline free at \u24dd(0\u24e5)\u24d4\u24db\u24d1\u24d8\u24dd\u221256A single damage value emerged, floating atop Nie Yan\u2019s head.Nie Yan took the brunt of Flame Slash. Just when he finally managed to regain his footing, Wei Kai activated his Charge skill. He approached with his sword raised, resembling a tank as he came crashing forward.\u201cLinear Slash!\u201dThe sword aura formed a straight line as it came slashing down.Nie Yan had only half of his health remaining, and the Charge skill had a brief stun duration. If he collided into Wei Kai, the Berserker\u2019s explosive power would be more than enough to kill Nie Yan in a matter of seconds.So, Nie Yan quickly decided to pull back and retreat again. At that moment, Wei Kai\u2019s sword brushed past Nie Yan\u2019s face barely by just a few inches. Nie Yan\u2019s pupils violently contracted as he sidestepped in an attempt the avoid the attack. He then switched the dagger in his hand to a reverse grip and slashed at Wei Kai\u2019s throat.In the end, he was still sent flying back after being struck by Wei Kai\u2019s charge.As Nie Yan fell to the ground, his opponent\u2019s health bar finally depleted. He staggered back up and stood firmly on both feet, then he gazed at his own health; only twenty-five points remained.Mhmm, as expected... Facing a Level 3 as a Level 2 is a little troublesome.Nie Yan\u2019s gaze fell on Wei Kai\u2019s corpse. Seeing that he died, Nie Yan put away his dagger.Moments later, the two were transported away from the PvP arena and back to the auditorium.\u201cI\u2019m impressed, brat. Who knew you were so capable?! Hahaha.\u201d Tang Yao approached Nie Yan as the latter took off his helmet.\u201cThe win was a fluke, I just happened to be a little lucky,\u201d Nie Yan said. He had almost been killed by Wei Kai as well. In the end, there just wasn\u2019t enough time for him to acquire enough equipment and skills. If he had a few more skills at his disposal, then defeating Wei Kai would\u2019ve taken much less effort.\u201cA win is still a win. Not to mention that it was a Level 2 versus a Level 3. Hey, do you know how to play Arcane Mages? Teach me how to play them when we get home, okay?\u201d Tang Yao said as he rubbed his hands together. It seems Nie Yan really does know a lot.\u201cI\u2019m not very knowledgeable when it comes to Arcane Mages. They have various unique skill builds, all of which requires different tactics. I\u2019ll teach you what I know, though,\u201d Nie Yan replied. When it came to Tang Yao, he wouldn\u2019t conceal things and act selfishly.\u201cThat would be great!\u201d Having witnessed Nie Yan\u2019s abilities in battle firsthand, Tang Yao held a firm belief in him.Nie Yan gazed at his bank card, which displayed a total of six thousand credits. He took three thousand and transferred it to Tang Yao. \u201cThe thousand six hundred is what I owe you. As for the other fourteen hundred... consider it me helping recoup your loses.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only a few thousand credits. How could that kind of money be anything between us brothers?\u201d Tang Yao said, sounding a bit displeased. From the start, this money he had never regarded this money with any importance. Nie Yan bothering about it actually made him feel quite unhappy.\u201cTrue brothers always repay their debts. If you\u2019re still unhappy about... tonight, you can treat me instead,\u201d Nie Yan said with a smile.\u201cYou\u2019ve made so much money today, while I barely broke even. Yet you still have the nerve try and freeload off me!? You\u2019re the one treating me to dinner tonight\u2014end of discussion!\u201d\u201cFine then. Eating a small loss is no big deal.\u201d\u201cWhat are we eating tonight? In any case, let\u2019s head to a restaurant!\u201d\u201cA bowl of wonton noodle soup is five dollars. That should be enough to fill you up,\u201d Nie Yan said as he stashed away his bank card.\u201cI say, aren\u2019t you being too much of a miser here?\u201d\u201cTakes one to know one.\u201d Nie Yan laughed. He and Tang Yao could be considered birds of the same feather.Wei Kai and his group walked into the room, having come over from the other area. Tang Yao\u2019s expression became grave upon seeing them. He knew that Wei Kai and his people had lost a lot of money today. They wouldn\u2019t fly into a fit of rage, would they?A smiling expression still remained on Nie Yan\u2019s face. Compared to Tang Yao, he certainly looked a lot calmer.\u201cWei Kai, you wouldn\u2019t be trying to shamelessly take back the money you just lost, would you?\u201d Tang Yao had inadvertently placed himself in front of Nie Yan. Subconsciously, he still considered Nie Yan to be the same as he was in the past\u2014an easily bullied youth.\u201cHow could I? Money lost is money lost after all, and money won is also money earned. Even this one knows this much when it comes to gambling. You know, they say that even disputes will eventually lead to friendship, so how about we settle our debts and makeup? Young Master Nie and Young Master Tang, when you two have time in the future, you should pay a visit to our little establishment. Hmm?\u201d Wei Kai said with a smile.Wei Kai had been drifting through society for many years now. Contrary to what one might expect, he had actually learned how to conduct himself properly during those years. He understood which types of people he should not provoke, and as a result, he did not mention their past grievances at all.\u201cWe\u2019ll be sure to visit when we have the time.\u201d Nie Yan nodded his head. Wei Kai this guy, he also knows when to advance and when to retreat.\u201cThis one will take his leave first then. Young Master Tang, Young Master Nie, you two have fun,\u201d Wei Kai said while smiling, bringing his lackeys with him as he departed.\u201cWhat happened to him? Why did he suddenly become so formal and courteous? That\u2019s way too abnormal! God damn, it\u2019s really making me uncomfortable,\u201d Tang Yao said in a baffled tone as he stood by Nie Yan\u2019s side.\u201cWho knows?\u201d Nie Yan let out a faint laugh.Wei Kai and his group had just left the PK Lounge when one of his underlings spoke.\u201cBoss, why were you treating that brat Nie Yan so politely? \u2018Young Master Nie,\u2019 does he even deserve it?\u201d Li Yang walked up to Wei Kai and asked in bewilderment.\u201cYou know there\u2019s a saying, \u2018Do not bully the youth when they are poor.\u2019 [1] Have you heard it before? In the future when you judge someone, don\u2019t just look at the present, you also need to gaze a little further into the distance,\u201d Wei Kai replied. He was able to discern that Nie Yan was a hidden dragon. Sooner or later, he would fly up high into the Heavens. It would be in his best interest not to become enemies with such a person.Li Yang was still at a loss as to what those words meant. However, in comparison to the rest of them, the boss was much more knowledgeable and experienced, thus he thought, The Boss\u2019s words are definitely correct, so I\u2019ll listen to him!Nie Yan and Tang Yao got into a car and drove off in the direction of a nearby restaurant.\u201cWhat\u2019s your in-game name?\u201d Tang Yao asked. Nie Yan was a Human thief, so Nie Yan was definitely the same race as him. They both started out in the Viridian Empire!\u201cNie Yan (Nirvana Flame). The \u2018Nie\u2019 in Nirvana, and the \u2018Yan\u2019 in fire,\u201d Nie Yan replied\u201cI\u2019ll come and find you when I get home then,\u201d Tang Yao said. He couldn\u2019t help but get excited when he thought of how he could level together with Nie Yan.\u201cI\u2019m in the middle of a quest right now, so I can\u2019t return to the city,\u201d Nie Yan said. He still needed to hand in the quest from Physician Blevins. Moreover, he already had arrangements for future matters, so he would be unable to level together with Tang Yao.\u201cEh? Nevermind then... How about you just teach me how to play Arcane Mage now, and I\u2019ll practice it when I get back home.\u201d Tang Yao felt a slight touch of disappointment, though he quickly went back to being excited in a few moments.\u201cArcane Mages are basically divided into three groups. First, you\u2019ve got the ones that are the most universal\u2014Arcane Fire Mages. They wear all sorts of equipment in order to raise their magic damage. Also, the skills they learn are all similar to ones like Arcane Flame Burst; the type that has a high kill potential. Arcane Mages like these are welcome in all teams. Another kind are the Arcane Speed Mages. They wear equipment that gives a bonus to movement speed. Once they start moving, they end up being really fast. Add in the Arcane Mage\u2019s relatively short cast time, and you\u2019ve got a build that\u2019s great at PvPing. The remaining group is essentially a balance between the last two. So, what path do you intend to take?\u201d Nie Yan asked.Tang Yao thought for a while, then started smiling in embarrassment as he asked, \u201cWhich group has skill requirements that are a bit on the lower side?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s definitely going to be an Arcane Fire Mage then. As long as they have good equipment, and high damage, all teams will want them. When fighting in a team, all you need to do is keep on attacking and you\u2019ll be fine. However, that kind of Arcane Mage has no chance when PvPing.\u201d With just a glance, Nie Yan could tell that Tang Yao wanted to be lazy. This scoundrel\u2019s brain isn\u2019t dumb; he\u2019s just too lazy to use it.\u201cI won\u2019t be able to PvP!? Ahhhh! That\u2019s way too boring!\u201d PvPing was just too exciting of an activity for him. Without it, half of the excitement in his life would be gone! Now, Tang Yao felt rather unwilling.\u201cIt\u2019s better if you choose a balance of both then. Before you allocate your points, make sure you consult with me first,\u201d Nie Yan advised. Conviction was designed so that every five levels from Level 1 to 30 would grant a player five stat points, and one mastery point to allocate. Therefore, for a player, every five levels prior to Level 30 was a minor watershed in combat power.\u201cAlright then, I understand.\u201d Tang Yao happily agreed. If he had Nie Yan helping him allocate his points, then he would be saving himself a lot of trouble. What he hated the most was thinking about these types of complicated matters in the game.\u201cI still have some business to attend to after we finish dinner. We\u2019ll contact each other in the evening when we get in the game, alright?\u201d Nie Yan said.\u201cAlright.\u201dAfter the two had dinner, Tang Yao dropped Nie Yan off and then went home himself.Having been out for so long, Nie Yan had wasted a lot of time. Upon arriving back home, he immediately went off to train, then study once again.[1] Courtesy of Deathblade: \u201cIt\u2019s better to bully an old poor person than a young person. If you bully a poor young person, you never know what that young person will grow up to be, and how rich and powerful they might become\u201d62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17 - LaceratePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 17 \u2013 LacerateAs Nie Yan opened up his textbook, various equations ranging from complex mathematics to theoretical physics appeared in front of his eyes. He managed to quickly solve all of them in a surprisingly short amount of time. In light of this development, he noticed that his cognitive abilities had vastly improved since his reincarnation. Though it hadn\u2019t reached the point where he developed photographic memory, his memory had still improved quite significantly. Moreover, he sensed that his mind had become sharper as well. For example, he had finished twice the amount of work in half the time when he was studying.In addition, there was an even more astonishing discovery. He felt neither the slightest bit of fatigue nor weariness despite having intensely exercised for quite a long period of time. In fact, after every training session, he felt his strength increasing in small yet noticeable increments.Nie Yan was quite satisfied with his current body. As long as he received the proper amount of nourishment, it would rapidly transform and rise in stature\u2014 similar to how it had in the past during his senior year of high school. However, there was only one complication: the nutritional supplements he required were simply too expensive. At present, the expenses weren\u2019t something he could handle. In fact, the lowest quality nutritional supplements had a price tag of around five hundred dollars, while medium quality ones could cost upwards of several thousand. Sadly, his household carried only two portions; one of which he had already used earlier in the morning.Finally, at five o\u2019clock in the afternoon, Nie Yan entered the game once more.Upon reconnecting, he discovered a nearly endless swarm of Water Spiders skittering around him in all directions. It appeared that every single monster in the vicinity had respawned.Fortunately, players were invulnerable for the first thirty seconds upon reconnecting. They would appear in an ethereal state as if they were a spirit. In this state, they would not only be unable to attack, but monsters would be unable to attack them as well. Nie Yan took a detour around these Water Spiders and swam away from the area where he had concealed himself.After thirty seconds had passed, he began farming the spiders in the surrounding area once more. Currently, he had already gathered twenty-five Fine Silks and five Rare Fine Silks which came from the Water Spider Leader the day prior.With his current hunting speed, Nie Yan estimated that it would take around three more hours for him to complete this quest.When I return to town, I\u2019ll definitely have to make more money. That way, when I come across another gathering quest like this one, I can just buy the needed materials from the market instead. With this plan, Nie Yan would have no need to go through the tedious labour of gathering the materials himself.Another hour passed by, and Nie Yan received a notification\u2014it was from Yao Yao.\u300c Nie Yan (Nirvana Flame), where are you right now? \u300d\u300c I\u2019m still farming Water Spiders. Why, you need something? \u300dHe didn\u2019t stop killing Water Spiders, even while he chatted with Yao Yao. After activating Assassinate with his right hand, he stabbed a nearby Water Spider with his dagger. As it died, it miserably flipped over and curled up.\u300c My friends and I went to the Treant Forest earlier this morning. \u300d\u300c Oh. \u300d\u300c Huh, you\u2019re not going to ask how it went? \u300d\u300c There\u2019s no need for me to ask. \u300dRegarding this Treant Forest, Nie Yan already understood this instance quite well. In the past, it had taken him and his friends five attempts to pass the instance. If the party didn\u2019t have Warriors with at least sixty defense and two hundred and twenty health, they wouldn\u2019t stand a chance. Therefore, it would be impossible for them to clear the instance.\u300c Alright, it was just like you said. Our party was completely wiped. We didn\u2019t even manage to get to the Treant King. But nevermind that, one of my friends wants to meet you. We\u2019re gonna try and clear the forest again tomorrow. So... can you join us then? \u300d\u300c Come back when your Fighters upgrade their defense, then we\u2019ll talk. I\u2019ll see if I have the time by then. However, make sure you tell your friend this: In exchange for joining you guys in the Treant Forest, I want to act as the party leader. Furthermore, every single Thief item that drops will go to me. \u300dThere was a rather decent Thief cloak that dropped from the monsters within the Treant Forest, one that Nie Yan wanted.\u300c You want to be the party leader? Why? \u300d\u300c I don\u2019t trust anyone else with leading a team. \u300d\u300c This... I\u2019ll have to ask. Giving every Thief drop to you is going to be a bit difficult. After all, we have a Thief in our party as well... \u300dYao Yao\u2019s party was set so that drops were distributed equally among their members.\u300c If your team captain doesn\u2019t agree to it, then so be it. \u300dNie Yan really didn\u2019t want to make things awkward and difficult for Yao Yao on purpose. However, in Nie Yan\u2019s eyes, this thief in Yao Yao\u2019s party was especially unpleasant.\u300c I\u2019ll go ask our captain... \u300dNie Yan\u2019s harsh demands lowered Yao Yao\u2019s impressions of him by quite a bit.The team captain Yao Yao spoke of was a woman named Yu Lan (Blue Feather); a Berserker. Nie Yan\u2019s first impression of this woman was her large pair of breasts. Her Berserker armour, which was tightly fitted around her body, accentuated her curves\u2013particularly in the chest area. Moreover, the gap in her armour also exposed an extreme amount of cleavage. When he recalled this memory of her, he couldn\u2019t help but slightly tremble.However, Nie Yan would never dare to provoke Yu Lan. Normally, she was quite friendly and amiable; however, if someone were to irritate her, then her fiery temper would become as large as her breasts. He remembered that there was a time when another player decided to tease her. Yu Lan ended up chasing and killing that player until he dropped five levels.It was because of such things that this beauty could only be gazed at from afar. She could neither be toyed with nor treated with disrespect. Otherwise, one would most likely find himself being the one toyed with instead.\u300c Also, there\u2019s one other thing... Other than the Thief equipment, I also want the jewel that the Treant King drops when it dies. \u300dNie Yan said without a hint of politeness or restraint.\u300c We all just want to try and run the dungeon together... But you...! How can you act in such a selfish way!? \u300dYao Yao stomped her feet and ended the call. She was furious and frustrated to the point where glistening tears began to flow from her eyes. After fighting and completing their quests together yesterday, she noticed that they actually matched each other quite well. Because of this, she felt that Nie Yan was a rather decent person and even wanted to get to know him better and befriend him. Yet she never thought that, again and again, Nie Yan would continuously crush her good impression of him that she held deep within her heart.Nie Yan indifferently smiled. Sometimes attempting to explain was superfluous.Yao Yao hung up the call in anger.\u300cHa...\u300dNie Yan sighed softly. If they were to run an instance together, then it would be better to make some things clear at the start. Otherwise, when the time came, disputes would certainly arise.At the Tellak Town transfer point, Yu Lan\u2019s team had assembled together in the area. In total, there were nineteen individuals gathered together. Among them, the most conspicuous were Yu Lan, who was wearing blue armour, and Yao Yao, who was wearing a White coloured mage-robe while standing in the center.Like the stars gathering around the moon, everyone there had gathered around, placing these two beauties at the center. Naturally, the team had other decent looking women as well. However, compared to the two beauties in the center, they could only entirely serve as the background.With her tall curvaceous figure and long slender legs that were almost too alluring, Yu Lan had grown up to be quite a beauty. Her looks could be rated at the highest quality. Despite appearing to be only in her twenties, she gave off the full charm of an adult woman. Though the main reason for this was her large voluptuous chest that easily attracted one\u2019s eyes.On the other hand, Yao Yao was another sort of beauty. With her whole body covered by a white robe, along with her delicate oval-shaped face, and her hair that was tied in a ponytail, she looked pure and beautiful. Anyone who looked at her would\u2019ve been moved by her charm.\u201cYao Yao, what\u2019d he say?\u201d Yu Lan asked when she saw that Yao Yao had disconnected her voice chat.\u201cHe said that if we\u2019re gonna go together, then he wants to be the party leader, get all the Thief equipment drops, and he also wants the jewel that drops from the Treant King!\u201d Yao Yao\u2019s face was nearly red from anger. Originally she had been quite excited about having Nie Yan as a good friend, and introducing him to Yu Lan. Never did she expect that Nie Yan was actually that kind of person.\u201cYao Yao, you\u2019re just really too naive. These kinds of people are everywhere. He\u2019s definitely just a weak liar who\u2019s trying to cheat us out of our drops,\u201d said a Thief by her side. He was Chen Bo, a rather handsome man who appeared to be around twenty years old.Yao Yao wanted to refute those words on Nie Yan\u2019s behalf, but after giving it a second thought, she realised that she was too angry to bother. She didn\u2019t know why, but for some reason, she still somewhat sided with Nie Yan in her heart. After all, he was actually quite strong. Not to mention that, unlike Chen Bo, she truly didn\u2019t think he was trying to scam them for equipment or anything that intolerable.\u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily true. He already knows that the Treant King drops a jewel, which means that he\u2019s definitely gone to the Treant Forest before. Not only that but cleared it as well. The fact that he was able to make it through the instance with a party of his own, is more than enough to prove his ability to work in a team. Moreover, he\u2019s significantly more experienced than us. So it wasn\u2019t that excessive for him to request to act as party leader, nor was it excessive for him to receive both the Thief drops and the jewel. Since he bluntly stated his demands to Yao Yao, it shows that he did so with a clear conscience.\u201d Yu Lan patted Yao Yao\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYao Yao, you don\u2019t need to mind it.\u201dAfter listening to Yu Lan\u2019s words, Yao Yao revealed a relieved smile. Though she was still a little angry at Nie Yan, in her heart she was already feeling significantly better.Seeing the beautiful smiling expression on her face, Chen Bo felt his heart sink. He didn\u2019t know why, but the sudden appearance of this Nie Yan gave him a sense of foreboding.\u201cWe\u2019ll rent a piece of Bronze-grade Fighter equipment for tomorrow. Oh yeah, make sure to tell him that we\u2019re running the instance tomorrow and that he\u2019s invited to join us,\u201d Yu Lan said. She had already begun her arrangements.\u201cHmph, I\u2019m still gonna ignore him for the rest of the morning. I\u2019ll talk to him again in the afternoon.\u201d Yao Yao pouted.\u201cAlright, you can contact him again in the afternoon.\u201d Yu Lan nodded while smiling.During all this, Nie Yan continued to kill Water Spiders. His luck wasn\u2019t bad at all, considering that three Fine Silks had dropped in succession. Looking in his bag, he already had twenty-nine of them. Only one more was needed to finish his quest.Nevertheless, it appeared that hunting monsters early in the morning had its own benefits. For one, the drop rate for various items was comparatively higher.After killing another Water Spider, Nie Yan reached out with his right hand to collect the loot. What\u2019d I get? As he held up the item to get a closer look, he realized that it was a Thief skill book.Skill Book: LacerateDescription: Thieves can use their daggers to slice into an enemy, causing them to bleed profusely. Targets hit by this attack will take bleed damage every second.Requirements: Action (requires weapon)Properties: Cuts into a target creating an open wound. Attack +1. Causes five points of bleeding every second for six seconds.Cooldown: 30 secondsRestrictions: Thief, Warrior, Paladin; can be learned by any faction.Lacerate was a Basic Skill that synergized well with Assassinate. It could be used to follow up after Assassinate, causing additional lacerations that would make an enemy bleed for five health every second for six seconds.However, as for it\u2019s killing power... the damage from Lacerate, even including its additional bleed damage, was slightly weaker than Vital Strike. Even so, it was still a considerably decent skill.Presently, this exact skill was what Nie Yan lacked the most.After learning the skill, Nie Yan turned to face another a Water Spider. Suddenly he received another notification from his voice chat. This little girl... she\u2019s sending another call request .Nie Yan answered the call. However, there was an awkward silence between the two that lingered on for what seemed like an eternity.\u300c You know... I originally planned to ignore you and never talk to you again. But... I\u2019m an adult who\u2019s willing to be magnanimous, so I won\u2019t bother stooping to your level and arguing with you. My party is going to run the Treant Forest tomorrow. So are you going to come or not? \u300dNie Yan couldn\u2019t help but reveal a knowing smile after imagining Yao Yao\u2019s adorable pouting expression.\u300cTomorrow... I\u2014 \u300d\u300c No need to explain yourself if you\u2019ve other business to attend to tomorrow. Just tell me whether you\u2019re coming or not. Yes or no? \u300dNie Yan was interrupted by Yao Yao just as he was about to speak.\u300c Alright. Just tell me the time for tomorrow, and I\u2019ll definitely be there. \u300d Nie Yan smiled helplessly. When it came to this little missus, he had already thoroughly given up.Best n0vel 0nline free at \u24dd(0\u24e5)\u24d4\u24db\u24d1\u24d8\u24dd\u300c Hmm... now that sounds better. Good! We\u2019ll call you over tomorrow morning. What, are you going to be busy? \u300dYao Yao was quite pleased with Nie Yan\u2019s reply. She immediately hung up, not even giving him a chance to speak further.Hmph! Little boy, we\u2019ll see if I can\u2019t discipline you, Yao Yao thought proudly to herself. When she imagined the distressed look on Nie Yan\u2019s face, she couldn\u2019t help but giggle to herself.\u300c Doot! Doot! \u300dUpon hearing the sound of the call ending, Nie Yan could only smile bitterly. It seems that tomorrow I\u2019ll have to go for a run in the Treant Forest. With the distraction gone, Nie Yan continued to kill Water Spiders while steadily speeding up his pace.After receiving the Lacerate skill, a significant increase in his hunting speed could be seen. By attacking with Assassinate and then following up with Lacerate, he was able to effortlessly kill a Water Spider.\u300c Ding! \u300dA melodious jingle could be heard as a system notification rang out. Nie Yan had risen to Level 3.After a while, he finished collecting the thirty Fine Silks.I\u2019m finally done. Nie Yan swam back towards the island to hand in his quest.\u300c System: Player Flying Stone has deposited one silver into your personal storage. \u300d\u300c Expert, the strategy you provided us with was really useful! Thanks to it, we\u2019ve managed clear the Fallen Shaman Camp. As such, the other silver has already been deposited into your storage. \u300dStone informed Nie Yan in excitement.\u300c I\u2019ve received it. Is there anything else you need? \u300dWith the two silvers from Stone plus his recent earnings, he had almost three silvers. With this, he could be considered to have some capital.\u300c One of my friends said that they\u2019re gonna form a party to hunt in the Agmota Muddy Wetlands the day after tomorrow. Do you wanna come? \u300dStone asked with a hint of expectation.\u300c I\u2019m going to be busy the day after tomorrow. \u300dThe Agmota Muddy Wetlands was a somewhat difficult instance. Though seeing as Stone\u2019s party was able to clear the Fallen Shaman Camp, it seemed like their strength wasn\u2019t too bad.\u300c Ah... nevermind then. Expert, would you happen to have a guide for the Agmota Muddy Wetlands as well...? \u300d\u300c Ahhh...!? Do you think I\u2019m some kind of god? Agmota Muddy Wetlands is the most difficult Level 3 instance. You think I\u2019m able to make up a guide for it so quickly? \u300dHe couldn\u2019t keep offering to sell guides for dungeon instances. Otherwise, he\u2019d end up attracting too much suspicion from others. Besides, it would be better for him to wait for a good offer, which would inevitably come after Stone and his team were wiped during their first few attempts.\u300cAh. I\u2019m sorry. I was just thinking out of habit... haha. \u300dStone laughed in embarrassment.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18 - Hidden QuestPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 18 \u2013 Hidden QuestNie Yan and Stone briefly exchanged a few more words before hanging up the call. By this time, he had already arrived back at the island. There, he found Physician Blevins still fishing by the lakeshore.\u201cYoungster! How many bundles of Fine Silk did you manage to collect?\u201d Physician Plevins asked after seeing that Nie Yan had returned.\u201cEsteemed Senior, here are the thirty bundles of Fine Silk I\u2019ve gathered. I\u2019d like to request that Senior have a look,\u201d Nie Yan replied in a polite and formal tone that was standard when turning in quests.\u201cYoungster, I must thank you for your generosity. Please take these thirty Silk Cloths with you as a means to repay your kindness. Furthermore, I have also decided to impart upon you a skill.\u201d\u300c System: Physician Blevins wishes to teach you Intermediate Combat Medic. Will you learn it? \u300dNie Yan felt his heart skip a beat. This was exactly the skill he wanted to learn. Without showing the slightest hint of hesitation, he immediately hit accept.\u300c System: The Great Mage, Blevins, has taught you a skill. You have learned Intermediate Combat Medic. \u300dIntermediate Combat Medic: Allows the player to create and use Intermediate Combat Bandages while in combat. Requires 10 Silk Cloth. Each bandage replenishes 20 health every second for 10 seconds. Healing can be interrupted after 3 seconds of applying bandages. Bandages can also be used on other party members.Ten silk cloths were equivalent to twenty coppers. Although it was a tad expensive, this was still a skill that could save lives in a moment of crisis!\u300c System: The task Physician Blevins has entrusted you with is 20% complete. \u300dBest n0vel 0nline free at \u24dd(0\u24e5)\u24d4\u24db\u24d1\u24d8\u24ddNie Yan stared blankly at this notification. Reasonably enough, he believed that the quest would have ended after handing in the thirty Fine Silks, but reality proved otherwise. What the hell? Why is it only twenty percent complete?\u201cYoungster, thirty bundles of Fine Silk is still far from being enough. I still need much more. Would you be willing to help me find more?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m willing to aid you in your task,\u201d Nie Yan hurriedly replied. It appeared that the Combat Medic Skill was merely one of the rewards in this lengthy quest. He was clueless as to what other quest rewards would lie further ahead. \u201cEsteemed Senior. Here are five Rare Fine Silks that I\u2019d chanced upon, though I am unsure of their usefulness.\u201d\u201cFine Silk becomes Rare Fine Silk after it has undergone processing. Each bundle of Rare Fine Silk is equivalent to six bundles of common Fine Silk,\u201d the Old Man explained to Nie Yan. Afterwards, the Old Man inquired further, \u201cSo youngster, are you willing to give them to me?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Nie Yan replied. Five Rare Fine Silks were equivalent to thirty ordinary Fine Silks. He had been killing Water Spiders for so long, yet he never once thought to hunt Water Spider Leaders despite them giving better drops.However, this was to be expected, as killing a Leader-ranked Water Spider was truly too dangerous of a task. In any case, it wasn\u2019t something Nie Yan could simply accomplish by himself.\u300c System: You\u2019ve received 30 Silk Cloths. \u300d\u300c System: You\u2019ve received Headhunter\u2019s Silver Leather Armour. \u300d\u300c System: The task Physician Blevins has entrusted you with is 40% complete. \u300dNie Yan felt a pleasant surprise after reading the second system announcement. After opening his bag, he found a silver-coloured piece of armour within his inventory.Who knew what kind of animal hide was used to make this piece of leather armour. It was tough, durable, and radiated a silver-white lustre. Furthermore, it didn\u2019t need to be appraised.Let\u2019s take a look at its properties.Headhunter\u2019s Silver Leather Armour (Silver)Requirements: Level 5Properties: Defense 13\u201317, Strength +5, Dexterity +5Weight: 3 lbRestrictions: Thief, Paladin, can only be equipped by a member of the Righteous faction.The properties of Silver-grade equipment were at least thirty percent higher than normal equipment. Furthermore, they also included two additional properties. With current market prices, Nie Yan estimated that he could sell this piece of armour for at least five silvers if he put it up in the auction house.Nie Yan\u2019s equipment would improve significantly upon reaching level 5, as he would finally be able to replace his current equipment with the Horn Dagger and Headhunter\u2019s Silver Leather Armour.With these thoughts in mind, he suddenly felt more motivation to level up.This Old Man sure is generous with his quest rewards, and sixty percent of the quest still remains unfinished. If I try to farm ninety more Fine Silks myself though... I\u2019d end up working myself to death! I\u2019ll just spend some money to buy the materials off the auction house instead. Ninety Fine Silks... that would be about three silvers. Ah... looking at it this way, I\u2019m still a long ways off from having enough money to spend freely.How can I make some money fast? Nie Yan was trying to rack his brain for a solution to this difficult problem. Eventually, he remembered a certain online guide that he viewed in the past.It was then that Nie Yan had a sudden flash of insight. Back when the game was first released, the most worthless item in the game was a drop by the name of Bat Teeth. It was a material used for crafting Level 0 beginner weapons. Even more laughable, these weapons would come out with pitifully low attack. Thus, for the most part, no one, aside from the occasional player who would purchase a few to level up their Blacksmithing after learning the skill, would buy the Bat Teeth. Other than that, there were just no other players who would bother buying any. Not to mention even if you sold five stacks of them\u2014a hundred bat teeth\u2014to an NPC, you would only receive a single copper. For these reasons, there were quite a few Bat Teeth littered across the ground in the Level 3 Bat spawning area, as few would bother picking them up.Many players would rather throw them away than have this trash material take up space in their bag. As a result, only the poorest of players would bother picking them up and selling them to the NPC stores.Nie Yan, however, knew these Bat Teeth had another use. They could be given to a high-level blacksmith in Calore city after triggering his hidden quest. In exchange for ten Bat Teeth\u2014half of a full stack\u2014you would receive a little bit of experience and one copper. Furthermore, you could exchange an unlimited amount of Bat Teeth with this blacksmith. As more and more players discovered this blacksmith, the market price for these Bat Teeth rose accordingly.This sort of business is actually doable... Nie Yan couldn\u2019t help but have this thought. All he needed to do was head to the Level 3 Bat spawn area and advertise that he\u2019s buying a stack of Bat Teeth for one copper. He\u2019d soon have a massive amount of Bat Teeth delivered right to his doorstep. Afterwards, he could exchange all of them with that blacksmith in Calore city and receive his quest reward. This way he could make a profit while also leveling up at the same time. How could he have forgotten something like this!?Nie Yan no longer hesitated and immediately ran off towards Tellak town. After returning to the town, he retrieved his two silvers from the storage, threw all his unwanted equipment up in the auction house, and then finally went to the appraiser to appraise the Soft Leather Gloves that he looted from the Golden Electric Eel. The gloves ended up being a Level 0 equipment with an additional property of Dexterity +2.The properties were fairly decent for Level 0 equipment. Nie Yan put the gloves on; they were the first piece of Bronze-grade equipment that he could actually equip.The gloves radiated a faint cyan glow until Nie Yan turned off the visual effects in equipment settings. It was still best if he kept a low profile. If his equipment was too conspicuous, then he would very likely be followed after leaving the city. After finishing up his business in town, Nie Yan went through the transfer point to Calore city. From there he went directly to the Kade Smithy within the city center.Calore city housed over sixty smithies that offered various blacksmithing services. You could buy everything from large siege equipment to weapons, armour, and even horseshoes. Only the Kade Smithy differed from this norm. Of all the smithies in the city, it was the most unremarkable.It was the high-level blacksmith, Kade, who issued the quest to gather Bat Teeth. In his former life, the player who first discovered it was a Paladin. After discovering that this blacksmith, Kade, gave out such a quest, he immediately bought a large amount of Bat Teeth and exchanged them with Kade for a large amount of profit and experience. He wanted to keep this his own secret, so he worked especially low key. However, as this Paladin purchased an increasingly large amount of Bat Teeth, other players began to grow suspicious. What could this Paladin possibly need so many Bat Teeth for? Afterwards, a Thief ended up shadowing him to the Kade Smithy, and the secret became publicized. However, by that time, most players were already over Level 10. The price of Bat Teeth had increased, and no players were willing to sell them for a low price now. It already wasn\u2019t worth it for them to go back to the area and farm Bat Teeth for the quest. When those Level 10 players recalled all the Bat Teeth they threw away in the past, they could only helplessly shake their heads and sigh. As for the Paladin who had first discovered this hidden quest, he had already earned overflowing basins full of money from doing this quest in secret for such a long time.However, at present... the only person who knew of this hidden quest was Nie Yan and Nie Yan alone!Nie Yan entered the Kade Smithy. Its shopfront was extremely narrow, nevertheless, it was still one of the many smithies designated by the Viridian Empire Military.As Nie Yan entered the smithy, he saw an NPC apprentice blacksmith.\u201cDear customer, may I ask if there is anything you require?\u201d the Apprentice came up and asked.\u201cI\u2019m looking for Mister Kade.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but my master has already gone out,\u201d the Apprentice replied apologetically.\u201cI have some business with him. May I ask when he\u2019ll be back?\u201d The Apprentice\u2019s reply came as no surprise. This was precisely how the hidden quest was triggered.\u201cMay I ask what business you have with my master? I can pass along a message.\u201d The Apprentice sized up Nie Yan, a sharp expression filling his eyes.\u201cPlease let Mister Kade know that I can help him with the current problem he\u2019s facing.\u201d\u201cPlease wait a moment!\u201d The Apprentice hastily ran out the door.After a while, the Smithing Apprentice came back with a tall and sturdy-looking blacksmith in his middle ages. He had messy sideburns, and his upper body was completely bare. His whole body was robust and covered in muscles from head to toe. Not only that, but his skin had also turned a dark shade of red after being exposed to the heat of a blazing furnace all year round.\u201cMister Blacksmith, rumours say you\u2019ve met with some worrisome troubles. May I ask what they might be? Perhaps I might be able to help you out,\u201d Nie Yan said and then thought to himself, There should be no problems with my wording here...\u2018Coming this autumn, the situation in Hilton Stronghold will become more and more intense. We need much more weapons in order to meet the demands of the soldiers on the frontlines. I need materials\u2014a great amount of them. And at present, I\u2019m clueless as to how I can amass such a large amount of these materials...\u201d Blacksmith Kade said in a distressed manner.\u201cMay I inquire what kind of materials you need? Perhaps I can help you find them.\u201d\u201cI need a large quantity of Bat Teeth. I\u2019m willing to purchase a stack for two coppers if you have them,\u201d Blacksmith Kade replied. For Kade, these Bat Teeth were crucial materials he was in desperate need of.NPCs didn\u2019t have much intelligence; they simply followed the instructions given by the main system A.I. They could only issue and receive quests. Hidden NPCs like Blacksmith Kade would not announce their quest publically.\u300c System: Do you wish to accept Blacksmith Kade\u2019s request? \u300dYes!\u300c System: You have accepted Blacksmith Kade\u2019s request. \u300d\u201cPlease be at ease. I will definitely help you find these materials.\u201d Nie Yan reassured Blacksmith Kade, then went through a transfer point to the town of Mordor.There was a large expanse near Mordor where a large amount of Level 3 Bat monsters congregated.With about several hundred people in it, the town was quite crowded.\u201cRecruiting people Level 3 or higher for Level 3 Instance, Warriors Tomb. I\u2019m a Mage that deals over thirty magic damage!\u201d\u201cRecruiting people to hunt bats! I\u2019m a Level 3 Fire Elementalist!\u201dPlayers were looking to form parties. Some would end up joining parties, while others would be buzzing around like houseflies. Those who had good equipment would often have an easy time finding a party to join. Meanwhile, those with poor equipment would find themselves being ignored by most parties.Parties formed one after another and left the town.It was currently early morning in the game. Once players formed a party, they would farm monsters for the whole day, only disbanding late in the evening.Nie Yan had set up a booth near the player storehouse. There he put up a sign that read: \u2018Buying Bat Teeth. One stack for one copper.\u2019He had just put up the sign, yet there were already many players gathering around him. Many of them always hung around this area hunting Bats, thus their bags were filled with many Bat Teeth. Once they gathered a hundred of them, they would go back and sell them to the NPCs. One copper wasn\u2019t much, but no matter how insignificant the amount was, it was still money. Besides, Nie Yan buying Bat Teeth for one copper per stack was a much better deal than selling the materials to an NPC.The players thought, Huh? These Bat Teeth litter the ground everywhere. I can actually sell a garbage drop like this for such a high price? Doing the math, I can make a decent profit selling these Bat Teeth.The everyday income for the average players wasn\u2019t very high. Add on their need to purchase equipment and healing items, most players would only have ten or twenty coppers on them at most. Naturally, they were all very willing when they learned that they could make a few extra coppers off of Nie Yan.\u201cHey, brother! I have three stacks of Bat Teeth here. Do you want them?\u201d\u201cOf course. If you have any, I\u2019ll take them,\u201d Nie Yan said while nodding his head. After briefly sweeping a glance at the ten or so people circling around him, he noticed that five or six of them were already organizing their inventories. Several others were hastily opening up their personal storages, fearful that Nie Yan had collected enough Bat Teeth and no longer wanted any more.\u201cWhat are these Bat Teeth used for?\u201d Some players probed and asked.\u201cI\u2019m using them to level up my Beginner Blacksmithing skill,\u201d Nie Yan would reply.\u201cHow does leveling up the Beginner Blacksmithing skill require so many Bat Teeth?\u201d\u201cI have ten or so friends who are all learning Blacksmithing as well, and they\u2019re having me buy the materials all at once. If you\u2019re going to sell then sell already. If you\u2019re not, then stop standing around and blocking the line,\u201d Nie Yan replied indifferently.\u201cHere, I have two stacks.\u201dNie Yan glanced at the trade window. He put in two coppers and then hit confirm.\u201cHere are mine. There are three stacks.\u201dOne after another, players continuously made trades with Nie Yan. Those who had more would sell around three or four stacks. While those with less would sell only one or two stacks. There were even a few who hadn\u2019t traded anything; they stood off to the side and gazed helplessly. They were the ones who had either already sold all their Bat Teeth to the NPCs, or thrown them away. In either case, they all stood there filled with regret.While trading, Nie Yan was also depositing the Bat Teeth into his personal storage. His bag only had twenty slots, and simply didn\u2019t have enough space to hold all the materials.More and more people came to trade with Nie Yan. The players who had sold their Bat Teeth would pass this information onto their friends. Then those friends who had Bat Teeth would come over one after another, bringing their Bat Teeth with them.Before long, Nie Yan had collected over two hundred stacks of Bat Teeth.Nie Yan hurriedly made an announcement. \u201cEveryone, please wait a moment! All of you, please wait! I\u2019m already out of money. Let me get some more money from my friends first. I\u2019ll be back in just a moment\u2014fifteen minutes at most. Everyone, please come back after fifteen minutes, I\u2019ll be back here by then.\u201d\u201cI still have some here!\u201d\u201cWait! There\u2019s mine too!\u201dNie Yan pushed through the crowd as he walked out. Finally, he took a deep breath. \u201cHah... these players are way too enthusiastic...\u201d62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19 - New MoneyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 19 \u2013 New MoneyNie Yan arrived back at Calore city after passing through the transfer point. As soon as he arrived, he turned a corner and entered a nearby alleyway. There he activated Stealth after making sure no one was following him. Only after making seven or eight detours through the alleyways, did he finally arrive at the Kade Smithy.This was a lesson learned from the past. He definitely wouldn\u2019t allow the location of the Kade Smithy to be disclosed.Nie Yan would retrieve the Bat Teeth he had collected from the other player in batches, then transfer and sell them to Kade.A while later, over two hundred stacks of teeth were sold for four silvers. Two silvers had become four in only half an hour. In addition, he also gained nine hundred experience. Nie Yan noticed his experience bar had already risen to five percent when he glanced at it.He went back to Mordor after handing over all the Bat Teeth, and continued buying more.Those players who saw Nie Yan return, fearful that he might soon leave again, immediately lined up and waited to trade.Mordor was bustling with an unusually high amount of activity due to Nie Yan\u2019s actions.\u201cEveryone, there\u2019s no need to feel anxious. After I buy everything I need this morning, I\u2019ll be coming back around eight in the evening to buy some more.\u201d Nie Yan issued an announcement to the crowd. These players would most likely amass quite a few Bat Teeth after farming monsters for the whole day up till eight in the evening.By the time he had purchased over two hundred stacks, the amount of Bat Teeth being traded had gradually lessened. After purchasing another one hundred stacks, Nie Yan saw there were no more players coming to trade. Thus he went through the transfer point back to Calore city.Two Thieves were following him closely. Nie Yan had bought these Bat Teeth all in one go, yet he still had the appearance of someone who looked like they still hadn\u2019t had enough. With that sort of behavior, trying not to attract the suspicion of others was difficult in itself.Nie Yan\u2019s mouth curved into a faint smile when he detected these Thieves attempting to track him. At present, those who were able to track him... haven\u2019t even been born yet!Nie Yan turned a corner into an alleyway and activated Stealth, very quickly disappearing from sight.By the time those Thieves made their way over to the alleyway, all traces of Nie Yan were gone.\u201cWhere\u2019d that guy go?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t find him.\u201d\u201cBrother, what do you think that guy\u2019s gonna do with all the Bat Teeth he bought?\u201d\u201cWho the hell knows... It definitely isn\u2019t for leveling his Blacksmithing though, that\u2019s for certain. There\u2019s no way in hell Blacksmithing would take that many Bat Teeth to level up, even if he\u2019s buying them for his friends. Not to mention he\u2019s even coming back for more in the evening. Let\u2019s wait until next time.\u201dThose two Thieves who stood at the corner spoke a few more words, then turned around and left.Gradually, a silhouette emerged from a wall not far from where those two Thieves had been. It was Nie Yan coming out of stealth. He had been just two meters away from them at most, yet they hadn\u2019t detected anything in the slightest.Nie Yan smiled coldly as he gazed at the backs of their retreating figures. It was simply wishful thinking, believing that they could pry into his secret. He wouldn\u2019t be so stupid as to reveal Blacksmith Kade\u2019s location. He turned around and went further into the alleyway.Having exchanged all three hundred stacks of Bat Teeth with Kade, Nie Yan now had seven silvers in his pockets. With the current average level of the player base, this could be considered a massive sum of money.He then ran to Carter town and Yeme town to purchase more Bat Teeth. After exchanging them with Kade, he had a total of twenty-six silvers.He now understood what it felt like to be rolling in money.\u201cAhh... how refreshing.\u201dThe amount of money a player had early in the game was essential to their growth in the future.That Paladin from his past life had made over ten gold coins from this quest. Earning such an amount seemed inconceivable to him when he first entered the game, but now he knew it was possible firsthand. Those players who knew about Nie Yan buying Bat Teeth for a high price would never imagine he was selling them to an NPC. Thus he would be able to make even more money down the road!A person\u2019s confidence would change when they had money, and Nie Yan was no exception. He immediately went off to the largest auction house in Calore city. The equipment and weapons being auctioned there were all at least Bronze-grade or higher. In addition, there were also various uncommon skill books and materials being auctioned off as well. For the most part, players who traded here were those who would often partake in raids.While on his way to the auction house, Nie Yan decided in advance that he would buy ninety Fine Silks at the lowest possible price. After making the purchase, he deposited his new materials into storage, so he could retrieve them whenever he wanted to hand in his quest. Afterwards, he strolled into the large hall of the auction house.As expected of the largest auction house in Calore, its construction was quite grand. The pillars within the main hall were built to be dozens of meters high to support the immense roof. The entire length of the hall spanned over a hundred meters. It was as if it was the hall of some vast temple or shrine.Nie Yan had routinely walked through these halls in his former life. After finding a corner to sit down at, he picked up his bidding device and marked down the quoted prices of the various merchandise that would appear on the magic screen.He look at page after page of merchandise. Everything listed on the magic screen was separated into categories, making it easy for players to find a specific item they were searching for.Nie Yan unchecked all the categories that were of no use to him. All that remained on the screen were items that could used by all classes, such as defensive daggers, small round shields, bags, etc...Player could equip up to five bags. They were divided into slots of sixteen, twenty, twenty-four, twenty-eight, and so on. The larger the bag space, the higher the price.Each player would be given a starter bag with twenty slots when they began the game. If they wanted more bag space, they could buy a sixteen-slot bag from the market place for ten coppers. As for twenty slot bags... their prices were even higher. Though at any rate, money wasn\u2019t really an issue for Nie Yan at the moment.Money spent could still be earned back in the future. In reality, the real loss was letting it waste away in your pockets.Nie Yan was using this money to outfit himself with the best equipment.The auction house had no more than eleven twenty-slot bags up for auction, each one being auctioned off for around twenty coppers. Nie Yan placed bids on four of these twenty-slot bags.Although the price of the bags Nie Yan bid on gradually rose, his maximum bid never exceeded twenty-two coppers. Before long, he managed to secure four twenty-slot bags.God dammit... tailors are the ones that make the real money, Nie Yan couldn\u2019t help but think to himself. However it was necessary to have the right connections if one wanted to be successful in a crafting profession. For example, a player could be at ease leveling their crafting skill if they had a guild to rely on and have the guild supply them with an endless amount of materials. Tailors were like this as well. And although many normal players would learn a crafting skill as well, they couldn\u2019t compare to those players who specialized in their crafting skill.Nie Yan\u2019s need for money still hadn\u2019t degenerated to the point where he needed to become a player that specialized in crafting.Best n0vel 0nline free at \u24dd(0\u24e5)\u24d4\u24db\u24d1\u24d8\u24ddAfter spending half a silver, he opened up a page that was exclusively for Thief merchandise.He skimmed through the page, searching for anything that looked interesting. As long as the item was useful, he would buy it without the slightest hint of hesitation. It didn\u2019t matter if the item was a little overpriced, he would still purchase it regardless.The items he bought were all Bronze-grade; a pair of Soft Leather Pants with Dexterity +3, a set of Azure Fur Armour with Strength +2, a pair of Horsehide Boots with Balance +2, and a Silver-tip Dagger with Strength +3. Nie Yan had spent a hefty sum purchasing these four pieces of Level 0 equipment. After replacing his current equipment with his new gear, he was now wearing only Bronze-grade equipment. Any one of these four pieces of equipment would cost a fortune for the average player. If it wasn\u2019t for him taking advantage of Kade\u2019s hidden quest to make a profit, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have dared to spend so much money.Nie Yan glanced at his equip load after replacing his equipment\u201416 lb. His weight was still classified as a \u201cLight Load\u201d (0\u201320 lb), thus his movements wouldn\u2019t be hindered at all.In addition to those four pieces of equipment, Nie Yan also bought three Thief skill books. The first was the passive skill, Enhance Stealth: Stealth and Cloaking receive an additional bonus of +3. The second book taught an attack skill called Concussive Blow: Directly strike an opponent, confusing them and preventing movement for three seconds. This skill has a cooldown of thirty seconds. Finally, the third book taught a skill called Smothering Strike: Strike an enemy from behind, putting them in a dazed state for six seconds. Target will awaken from the stun if attacked. This skill has a cooldown of thirty seconds.These three skill books taught only Level 0 Thief skills, however the market price for them was roughly twenty coppers each. Thieves would be very poor when first starting out in the game. In that respect, Thieves and Mages could be considered fellow sufferers in the same boat, as both classes would end up spending practically all their wealth buying skill books!Thieves were a class that couldn\u2019t survive without skills, but each skill book was quite expensive! Thus they had no choice but to bear through the hard times, living frugally each day so they could purchase a single skill book. Sometimes these players would even be forced to continue wearing their old worn out equipment, just so that they could save a few coppers. Even the Thief players who were somewhat wealthy in real life would sometimes have no choice but to head to the transaction platforms and spend some money to buy in-game currency.A Thief\u2019s true power, their formidable ability to control a fight, would only emerge if a player could endure through these hard times and buy the skills they needed.Nie Yan had also endured these hardships before, slowly making his way up bit by bit before being reincarnated. Though he was able to easily buy his way through this barrier in his current life.His skill bar looked that much less empty after learning those three skills. He pulled up the page for skill books again to see if there were any other skills up for sale. As he browsed, the name of an uncommon skill caught his eye.Skill Book: ParryDescription: Parry an opponent\u2019s attack with your weapon.Requirements: Action (requires weapon)Cooldown: 30 secondsRestrictions: Thief, Warrior, Paladin; can be learned by any faction.Nie Yan couldn\u2019t forget this skill. It was something that every close-combat class yearned for\u2014the most valuable asset of any melee class. It didn\u2019t matter what kind of situation a player was in, whether PvPing or fighting a monster, being able to parry an attack was a lifesaver.Parry was a skill that had a one in ten thousand chance of dropping from demonic monsters.Only one or two players had learned the skill when he participated in a hundred man battle full of Level 60s in the past. This exemplified how rare of a skill it was. Its value was only slightly less than the skill book for Vital Strike.It didn\u2019t matter though... he would buy it anyway!Nie Yan glanced at the current bid\u2014two silvers. Not only that but the bidding price was constantly rising by at least fifty coppers each time.The ones who made bids on these uncommon and rare skills were usually wealthy players, teams, or maybe even guild leaders. More often times than not, they wouldn\u2019t mind spending a few silvers for the sake of a single skill book.Two silvers and fifty coppers, three silvers, three silvers and fifty coppers...The fierce bidding on the Parry skill book attracted the attention of many players.\u201cIt\u2019s a rare skill!\u201d\u201cNo wonder the bids are so high...\u201dThree silvers... it was roughly the same amount that a team would make after clearing a common Level 3 dungeon. Even then the most they could earn would be five silvers.After a short while, the bidding came to a halt. The auctioned item would go to the highest bidder if ten minutes passed without any further bids.\u201cFour silvers...\u201d Nie Yan placed his bid. He was determined to get this Parry skill book.\u201cFour silvers and fifty coppers!?\u201d He didn\u2019t know who, but someone increased the bid yet again.This price could terrify the overwhelming majority of players in the game.At this moment, it was simply a matter of which side was more willing to throw their money away. \u201cFive silvers!\u201d Nie Yan increased his bid once more... No matter what he\u2019d still have many more opportunities to earn money in the future. This amount wasn\u2019t something he\u2019d be lacking in the slightest.\u201cGod damn. Who the hell is that rich? To spend that much money for a single Parry skill book...\u201dAll of the players at the auction were already discussing it in private. A single Thief skill book being auctioned for such a price... This was just too terrifying.\u201cThere truly are a lot of wealthy people.\u201dThe price didn\u2019t increase for a while. It seemed the other party had been scared off by Nie Yan\u2019s bid. The Parry skill book entered his bag after ten minutes passed.After learning the skill, he bought a vial of poison used by Thieves to coat their daggers for thirty coppers. It could be applied three times before running out, and would cause an enemy to lose ten percent of their defense after being poisoned.Finally he was done purchasing everything he needed. Furthermore, the items he had auctioned earlier had been sold. Currently he still had sixteen silvers remaining in his pockets.Despite having learned so many new skills, Nie Yan didn\u2019t need to practice with them at all. This was because he was highly familiar with both the Thief Skills and the class itself. He could use these skills with ease right off the bat, thus his strength had increased significantly after learning them.Nie Yan now had a lot more confidence when comparing himself to those who had started when the game first released. Using the game knowledge of his past life, he could now pave a path for his future development. Then in the future he could walk down this path unobstructed.Afterwards he crafted the Silk Cloths in his bag into bandages, which could be used in case of emergency. He also bought bread and other useful items that could replenish his strength. Furthermore he now had a bag full of Basic Health Potions and Basic Recovery Potions.Intermediate Combat Medic: Skill Mastery 10/500Should I head off and level then? Nie Yan immediately thought of several leveling locations that were very suited for Thieves to train in.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There should be a few treasure chests there, not to mention the drops aren\u2019t too bad either. Though I don\u2019t know whether or not the chests have already been found by someone else. \u300cDing!\u300d While contemplating this matter, Nie Yan suddenly received a notification.\u300c System: Player Yao Zi (Young Sparrow Hawk) has sent you a friend request. \u300d\u300c Nie Yan, it\u2019s me, \u300dTang Yao said in an anxious tone.\u300c What\u2019s the matter? \u300dNie Yan asked. The anxiousness in Tang Yao\u2019s tone caused him to furrow his brows.\u300c I\u2019ve been cornered at Levin Hills, \u300dTang Yao said depressingly. The only person he could think of who could help him out at this moment was Nie Yan.\u300c What, who\u2019s got you cornered? \u300d\u300c People from the Radiant Sacred Flame guild. There\u2019s at least twenty of them! All five of my teammates were killed by those bastards. Only I alone managed to escape... If it wasn\u2019t for Lei Zi (Young Thunder) shielding me, then I would\u2019ve died as well. Right now those guys are blocking the only two exits from Levin Hills. \u300d Lei Zi was Nie Yan and Tang Yao\u2019s classmate in middle school. However, unlike Tang Yao, he wasn\u2019t very close to Nie Yan, as they had only made brief contact in the past.Radiant Sacred Flame... Nie Yan had actually heard of this guild before. It was a large guild, similar to Victorious Return. In the past, around the time he had reached Level 60, Conviction\u2019s developers implemented the guild ranking system. Radiant Sacred Flame was one of the guilds that had ranked in the top sixties. Even as the years went by they never fell below the top one hundred.\u201cHide well. I\u2019ll be there in just a moment,\u201d Nie Yan advised. Tang Yao would very likely be killed if he was late by even a few moments. Dying meant the loss of a level. This would be an extremely unfortunate outcome for Tang Yao.Nie Yan entered a scroll shop and bought five Return Scrolls, five Basic Haste Scrolls, and five Basic Strength Scrolls. He only needed to give Tang Yao a Return Scroll and the latter would be able to be safely teleported to the nearest city or town. As for the other scrolls, he prepared them in case he needed them later on.A single Return Scroll would cost upwards of thirty coppers. As for the Basic Haste and Strength Scrolls, they were slightly cheaper at twenty coppers each. Both these scrolls had a duration of thirty seconds. Basic Haste Scrolls would increase movement speed by twenty percent, whereas Basic Strength Scrolls would increase strength by five points.For players who weren\u2019t so wealthy, these scrolls were items that many of them couldn\u2019t bear to use. No one would dare act like Nie Yan and buy this many scrolls in one go.He also bought more Basic Health Potions in preparation for the future.Nie Yan put away the scrolls and hastily made his way towards the nearest transfer point. He was equipped with Bronze-grade equipment that gave stat bonuses such as Dexterity +5 and Move Speed +2. As a result, his current movement speed vastly outstripped the average player.He quickly arrived at the transfer point and teleported straight to Link town. After emerging in the town, he immediately sprinted off towards the north.\u300c How\u2019d you guys get into a scuffle with them in the first place? \u300d\u300c We met a Leader-class monster in the area where we were hunting Level 3 mobs. While we were fighting it, a group of people came over and tried to forcefully steal the kill from us, just because they had the advantage in numbers. In the end, our party\u2019s Thief managed to grab a piece of Bronze equipment when the Leader-class monster died. Those guys weren\u2019t willing to accept that, though, so they tried to kill us afterwards. Now three of them have their names marked red. \u300dTang Yao seemed to be out of breath while he said all this. It appeared that he was still hiding from his pursuers.\u300c How much longer do you think you can hold out for? \u300d\u300c Luckily, Levin Hills is a pretty wide area. So as long as I keep moving around, they shouldn\u2019t even think about catching me within the next hour, especially considering how few people they have. That is... unless they call for more reinforcements. \u300d\u300c One hour is enough. I\u2019ll make sure to thoroughly have fun with them. \u300dNie Yan was beginning to grow restless. He was equipped from head to toe with Bronze-grade equipment and had learnt many new skills. He was just itching to go, now that he had found new opponents to test them out on.\u300c What\u2019re you gonna do? \u300d\u300c This brother is going to vent some frustrations on your behalf, \u300dNie Yan confidently replied.\u300c How many people do you have with you? \u300dTang Yao asked, bewildered. He couldn\u2019t help but wonder if Nie Yan actually managed to bring a lot of people with him.\u300c None, just me. \u300d\u300c Is this some kind of joke!? \u300dTang Yao felt this was simply too ridiculous.\u300c Haha! W hat do you think? \u300dNie Yan replied. At present, most players in the game weren\u2019t that strong. After all, they\u2019ve only been playing the game for about a week. To put it simply, they were all still novices. Even guilds like Radiant Sacred Flame would be hard pressed to find even a single member that could rival Nie Yan, let alone having the bottom ranking runts facing him.\u300c I can\u2019t wipe them all out, but taking care of a few of them shouldn\u2019t be a problem. \u300dBest n0vel 0nline free at \u24dd(0\u24e5)\u24d4\u24db\u24d1\u24d8\u24ddNie Yan had ten years of experience playing a Thief. He knew all the skills used by each and every class for PvP. Not to mention he understood combat strategies like the back of his hand. Even if they have more people... so what?\u300c Don\u2019t go getting yourself killed, though. If the situation starts looking dangerous and you can\u2019t help me, then so be it. Even if I die, I\u2019ll only lose one level. It\u2019s nothing to lose your head over. \u300d\u300c No worries. Find a place to hide and don\u2019t come out. Just sit back and watch. \u300dThe entrance to Levin Hills was a small ravine that allowed only three to four people to pass through at a time. Steep vertical cliff faces flanked the ravine on both sides.There were three players guarding this entrance: a Level 3 Berserker, a Level 3 Elementalist, and a Level 2 Priest.Among the three, only the Elementalist had their name marked red.Their companions had already gone in to chase after Tang Yao, leaving only these three to guard the entrance.And the hapless Tang Yao was trapped inside, just like a turtle in a jar.\u201cDamn! That bastard is as slippery as a loach. Even after all this, we still haven\u2019t managed to catch him. What\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t even know when this red mark on my name is going to disappear. I can\u2019t even enter any towns or cities until it goes away,\u201d the Elementalist cursed while chatting with his teammates.\u201cCaptain Dian Cang (Blue Drop), don\u2019t be angry. There\u2019s no problem as long as you don\u2019t get killed by someone before your red name disappears. Besides, we gained a lot of profit from this. Each of those five people we killed dropped a piece of equipment,\u201d the Berserker consoled.\u201cPeh! Those five pieces of garbage aren\u2019t worth ass. If it weren\u2019t for those brats thinking they could actually steal our equipment, putting me in a shitty mood, then this old man wouldn\u2019t even have bothered with them.\u201d the Elementalist named Dian Cang replied disdainfully.\u201cCaptain Dian Cang you\u2019re truly like an invincible god. You managed to single-handedly take out three of them by yourself. Remember when you cast Scorching Flame Explosion earlier? The way you used it was simply too exquisite!\u201d the Priest next to him began flattering and fawning.\u201cHmph! Those three were just weak. It only took one Scorching Flame Explosion to take out over half of their health. If it weren\u2019t for their small amount of magic resistance, they surely wouldn\u2019t have survived!\u201d Dian Cang said, somewhat pleased with himself.The nearby Berserker and Priest were simply followers of this ill-tempered Elementalist. It seemed that his position within the Radiant Sacred Flame guild was rather high.The three chatted on idly like this.\u201cAh! A red name. Looks like today\u2019s meal will be rather decent.\u201d Nie Yan cackled with a strange laugh while hiding far off in the distance. If a player with their name marked in bright red like this Elementalist were to be killed, then not a single a piece of equipment on their body would remain. Everything equipped would drop!Furthermore, the equipment this Elementalist donned didn\u2019t look half-bad. He wore a blazing red mage gown that resembled flowing flames. He held in his hands a dark crimson redwood mage staff with a fiery blaze that circulated at the top. It appeared to be a part of the Fire Chaser set, but Nie Yan himself wasn\u2019t too sure.This Elementalist was going down a route that focused on fire damage. The high damage from his fire spells was going to be a slight pain to deal with. The nearby Berserker also looked like he would be hard to handle. As for the Priest by their side, he could simply be ignored. Most priests still haven\u2019t even learned Heal this early in the game. Therefore, they would just follow the team from behind and leech experience.Dian Cang swept his eyes over the surroundings. The steep inclines of the nearby mountains made the background slightly difficult to blend into. However, Nie Yan had learned the Enhance Stealth passive skill, so it wouldn\u2019t be much of a problem.He entered stealth and slowly moved towards those three players.He grasped the dagger in his right hand, holding it in a reverse grip, and slowly crept closer. At about five meters away, he was able to clearly make out the expressions on each of their faces.The Elementalist Dian Cang felt something peculiar and glanced over the nearby area. Seeing this, Nie Yan quickly halted his steps and exercised control over his breathing. Seems this Elementalist has a rather high Awareness .\u201cCaptain Dian Cang, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d the Berserker asked with a bewildered expression. He looked around, but all he saw was empty space.Dian Cang searched the surroundings once more with a more focused gaze, but still didn\u2019t discover anything. He shook his head and said, \u201cNothing, probably just my imagination.\u201dNie Yan faintly knitted his brows. He could tell this Dian Cang was experienced in PKing, because he was able to vaguely sense Nie Yan\u2019s presence from such a far distance.The more points a player had in Awareness, the easier it would be for them to detect hidden enemies such as Thieves.I can\u2019t take my opponents too lightly. Nie Yan inwardly reminded himself. Numerous bitter experiences in the past reminded him that underestimating an opponent would often lead to defeat.Nie Yan lightly tread forward, occasionally altering his walking speed. After calming his mind, he gradually entered a Thief\u2019s stealthing state, and completely merged with the background.\u201cCaptain Dian Cang, who knows where that Arcane Mage could be hiding up in the hills. Maybe Bai Mao (White Hair) and the others have already lost him,\u201d the Berserker said after taking a quick glance at Dian Cang\u2019s expression.\u201cOh,\u201d Dian Cang absent-mindedly replied.\u201cThat brat is pretty cunning. He nearly killed Dong Zi (East Child) just now,\u201d the Priest informed after looking at the party chat.\u201cMhmm... his defense is too weak,\u201d Dian Cang answered back. He seemed preoccupied with something else.The Berserker and Priest were quite puzzled. What\u2019s going on with the Captain? Why is he so absent-minded?By this time, Nie Yan had made his way behind Dian Cang, and was unable to see the expression on the latter\u2019s face.He was now only two meters away from Dian Cang. Nie Yan attentively gazed at his target\u2019s back. After making some quick measurements, he found that he was about three meters away from the other two. It\u2019s about time. He resembled a cheetah as he patiently stored up power in his legs before suddenly pouncing towards his target\u2014Dian Cang!\u201cBrat! I was waiting for you to show yourself!\u201d Dian Cang laughed sinisterly. He retreated back and brandished the staff in his hand. \u201cFierce Flame Ring!\u201dHe had discovered Nie Yan long ago! His eight points of Awareness weren\u2019t something to be trifled with.Even if they were stealthed, it would still be incredibly difficult for a Thief to leave behind no traces in front of an expert.The Elementalist had intended to lure Nie Yan closer so he could kill him with the help of the nearby Berserker and Priest!\u201cYou took a fancy to this old man\u2019s equipment? Do you think you\u2019ll still have a life to snatch it with?\u201d Dian Cang smiled disdainfully. He thought Nie Yan was no more than a passing Thief who was lusting after his equipment. One who was urged on after seeing his red name and the type of gear he was wearing. From the start, he never thought Nie Yan and Tang Yao were connected.Dian Cang finished casting his spell. Immediately, a blazing ring of fire emerged out of thin air, expanding outwards in every direction as it headed towards Nie Yan.After casting Fierce Flame Ring, the Elementalist immediately retreated backwards.Nie Yan was assaulted by the sensation of scorching flames!Nie Yan was inwardly surprised. This guy\u2019s reaction speed is pretty quick...\u201cThief!\u201d The nearby Berserker and Priest finally reacted to the situation and immediately began taking action.At present, it was much too dangerous for Nie Yan to turn his back on them and try to make an escape. If the Berserker were to start off with Charge, and then the Elementalist and Priest were to follow up with their attacks, he would undoubtedly die!\u201cKill him!\u201d Dian Cang forced Nie Yan to halt his steps by casting Fierce Flame Ring. The Berserker seized this opportunity and went to cut off his escape. Meanwhile, Dian Cang started putting more distance between himself and Nie Yan so that he could calmly cast spells from the back.How could Nie Yan not understand his intentions? He knew that retreating at this moment was the same as asking Dian Cang to barrage him with spells.With a flick of a finger, a scroll appeared in his hand. Although he was a little regretful, he still used it without the slightest bit of hesitation.\u300c System: Your movement speed has been increased by 20% for 30 seconds! \u300dNie Yan\u2019s base movement speed was already quite high. However, with the twenty percent increase, it had reached an astonishing level. He welcomed the oncoming blaze head on and rushed forward.\u300cBoom!\u300dAn explosion rang out as the Fierce Flame Ring struck Nie Yan.\u221235\u300c System: The opposing party led by player Dian Cang (Blue Drop) has taken the initiative to attack you. You are free to retaliate in legitimate self-defense. Time: 30 minutes. \u300dThe retaliation period increased to thirty minutes when facing a small party. It would increase even further in team battles or guild wars.The magic damage from Dian Cang\u2019s Fierce Flame Ring was quite high. If Nie Yan hadn\u2019t changed his old gear to his current Bronze-grade equipment, this Fierce Flame Ring would\u2019ve surely taken out at least the greater half of his health!Sparks scattered in every direction as Nie Yan rushed through the Fierce Flame Ring, rapidly drawing closer to Dian Cang. He stabbed out with his dagger, aiming directly at his opponent\u2019s chest.Dian Cang had originally hoped that his Fierce Flame Ring would force Nie Yan to withdraw. He never thought that Nie Yan would be so unwavering in his offense, pushing ahead instead of retreating. His speed was even faster than it was just moment prior. Moreover, he hadn\u2019t expected that his spell would do so little damage to Nie Yan. He honestly thought that it would deal around fifty damage at the very least.He hastily retreated backwards while casting Small Fireball.\u201cAssassinate!\u201d\u300cSplash!\u300dBlood gushed out and splattered everywhere. Nie Yan had met the spell head on as his dagger penetrated Dian Cang\u2019s chest.Finally, within melee range, his dagger flashed with a chilling light.This wasn\u2019t the first time Dian Cang had faced a Thief in combat, but it was definitely the first time he had felt such enormous pressure. Nie Yan\u2019s damage was quite high, and his movements were extremely quick.He used a scroll!Dian Cang hurriedly drew back and pulled out a talisman for his next spell. As he put some distance between himself and his opponent, he prepared to cast Scorching Flame Explosion.Scorching Flame Explosion required five syllables, two gestures, and a magic catalyst to cast; the spell wouldn\u2019t cast if even one of these components were missing. Fortunately, the talismans could be bought in stores and weren\u2019t expensive at all.The Berserker came around from the side, then leapt into the air and cleaved down towards Nie Yan with Flame Slash. He was covering for Dian Cang so that the latter could cast their spell.The two had fairly good teamwork. The Berserker had managed to block Nie Yan at a crucial time.Red coloured fire elements began rapidly coalescing. In Dian Cang\u2019s arsenal of spells, Scorching Flame Explosion had the highest amount of damage. If the opponent\u2019s magic resistance was low, it was even possible for them to be instantly killed on the spot.The magic resistance of Thieves could only be considered average. Their base magic resistance was equal to sixty percent of their defense.The casting time for Scorching Flame Explosion was five seconds.Seeing the Berserker leap at him from the side, Nie Yan waited until the edge of the oncoming blade was in front of his eyes. In that moment, Nie Yan swiftly and elegantly raised his dagger, parrying the blow.The six-inch dagger and Berserker\u2019s greatsword clashed against each other. A sharp metallic sound rang out, jolting both players at the same time. The Berserker\u2019s greatsword struggled to advance by even half an inch.Dian Cang continued retreating backwards while chanting out cryptic sounding syllables one after another. His voice radiated out with a muffled yet explosive power.This voice was beckoning the elements to his call.\u300cBang!\u300dA ray of holy light had struck Nie Yan, dealing thirteen damage. Although this Priest\u2019s damage output was limited, he still continued to attack Nie Yan regardless.Nie Yan quickly went in pursuit of Dian Cang once more after he had parried the Berserker\u2019s attack.The Elementalist\u2019s heart shook in awe after witnessing this Thief who was still advancing forward, even after facing an onslaught of fierce attacks. What a valiant Thief!Nie Yan clearly understood that he had no time to think because he would lose his life if he hesitated in the slightest. In order to preserve his life, he could only put it at stake.He bravely faced the enemy head on so that he could achieve victory.Countless years of PvP experience from his past life gave Nie Yan extremely sharp instincts. He wouldn\u2019t lose!Three seconds... four seconds... blazing flames were rapidly coalescing into a huge mass atop Dian Cang\u2019s staff. Soon the flames had rotated into a chaotic mass of deadly scorching fire essence.Nie Yan dashed forward at full speed and arrived in front of Dian Cang.\u201cConcussive Blow!\u201dIn the end, Dian Cang was just a step slower. Nie Yan bashed his dagger into the Elementalist\u2019s skull. The Scorching Flame Explosion rapidly collapsed before completely dissipating into thin air.Concussive Blow had the effect of interrupting attacks. Therefore Nie Yan attacking Dian Cang with Concussive Blow in the middle of casting caused Dian Cang\u2019s spell to be cancelled.Nie Yan felt the tight heartstrings in his chest loosen by a bit. I barely made it. If I had let him successfully cast Scorching Flame Explosion, I just can\u2019t imagine what sort of consequences there would\u2019ve been.The Berserker\u2019s Flame Slash had been parried, and in the blink of an eye, Nie Yan had already gotten out of his attack range. Furthermore, he had also managed to interrupt and stun Dian Cang.Too fast. The Berserker felt a chill in his heart. Nie Yan\u2019s speed was much faster than any other Thief he had seen before. However, he didn\u2019t have the time to continue staring out blankly. He brandished his sword and activated Charge. The Berserker resembled a tank as he came crashing forward in Nie Yan\u2019s direction.\u201cVital Strike!\u201d Nie Yan completely ignored the incoming Berserker. He took advantage of Dian Cang\u2019s dazed state to activate Vital Strike and pierce his dagger into Dian Cang\u2019s heart.\u300c System: Vital Strike successful! Attack +5%, causing additional damage! \u300dThe sixty or so health Dian Cang had remaining immediately started to plummet, then completely disappeared.\u300cThud!\u300dEverything he was wearing, from his upper body to his lower body, dropped. From his headgear to his mage robes, gloves, pants, and boots, not a single piece of equipment remained. Every single piece of equipment had dropped and fallen on the ground.\u300c System: You have killed a red name player, and receive Fame +1! \u300dIn the game, it was possible to receive a little fame for killing a player who had their name marked in red. However, you wouldn\u2019t receive any more fame after killing the same red-named player more than three times. Killing red-named players wasn\u2019t the only way to earn fame, though, players would also receive it for completing missions. The higher a player\u2019s fame, the easier it would be to receive certain missions. Fame would also allow players to receive more preferential treatment in towns and cities.By the time Nie Yan had killed Dian Cang, the charging Berserker had finally arrived and came slashing down with his sword. Nie Yan dodged by side stepping, and their shoulders brushed as the charging Berserker missed his target.Nie Yan was right before his eyes. The Berserker had been absolutely certain his attack would hit Nie Yan. He never expected that Nie Yan would actually dodge all of a sudden, leaving him to continue charging far off into the distance.\u201cAll of the captain\u2019s equipment dropped! Quickly, pick it up!\u201d the Berserker anxiously shouted. Dian Cang was an important figure within the Radiant Sacred Flame guild and someone who frequently participated in guild dungeon runs. Every piece of equipment on his body was extremely valuable and rare. Even if you compared it to the entire guild, it would still be considered more valuable. If one were to estimate their value, they would be worth more than ten silvers!However, the dropped equipment was just too far away from him. When he looked back, he found that Nie Yan was already beginning to pick the equipment up.The Priest quickly ran over to where Dian Cang dropped his equipment after dying. Just prior, he had run off into the distance, casting spells from the back in order to evade Nie Yan. How could he possibly make it back in time to grab some of the equipment?Just as Nie Yan had bent over and stuffed two pieces of equipment in his bag, a ray of holy light struck his body.\u221217A damage value floated above Nie Yan\u2019s head.Linear Slash!The Berserker came leaping forward with his sword, slashing towards Nie Yan.Nie Yan ignored the oncoming Berserker\u2019s slash and continued stuffing one piece of equipment after another into his bag.Ah... that\u2019s everything. Picking up equipment sure does make a person happy. By the time he lifted his head back up, the Berserker had already arrived in front of him.\u300cBang!\u300dThe Berserker\u2019s sword aura struck Nie Yan\u2019s body, causing him to lose twenty-two health.Nie Yan only had twenty-three health remaining, yet he still maintained a cool head. He rapidly fell back and drank a Basic Health Potion.\u201cBrat! Let\u2019s see if I can\u2019t hack you to death!\u201d Dian Cang had been killed. If he didn\u2019t kill Nie Yan, then he would have a hard time facing Dian Cang. As a result, he frantically pursued Nie Yan with bloodshot eyes.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Thief was already an inherently nimble class. Yet now, with the dexterity bonus from his Bronze-grade equipment and the movement speed bonus from the scroll, Nie Yan vastly outstripped the Berserker in terms of speed.Nie Yan had already retreated five yards back.\u201cDon\u2019t let him run away, or else we won\u2019t be able to explain ourselves to the captain!\u201d the Berserker shouted anxiously. He was too slow. There was absolutely no way he\u2019d be able to catch up. As he took a quick glance at Charge on his skill bar, he lamented the fact that it was still on cooldown.\u201cI know.\u201d The Priest attacked once more. A beam of holy light struck Nie Yan, dealing sixteen damage.The Berserker relentlessly pursued from behind.However, from the start, Nie Yan never intended to escape. He was simply stalling for time so that a few skills could come off cooldown.Just as the Priest finished casting, Nie Yan pulled back and began applying bandages to himself.+20... +20... +20... +20\u2014Gradually, his health began restoring every second. On the fourth tick, the Priest struck Nie Yan with another beam of holy light, interrupting the healing.Though by this time, Nie Yan had already been restored to full health.At present, with the average level of the player base, Intermediate Combat Medic was an existence that defied the Heavens.\u201cHe has a Medic skill!\u201d the Berserker exclaimed in surprise; a hint of fear could be heard in his tone. What kind of Medic skill is this!? The Medic skills he had seen in the past could only be used when combat ended. Nonetheless, they would still only restore five health every second. Yet... Nie Yan\u2019s skill restored twenty! He had never even encountered a Medic skill like Nie Yan\u2019s that could be used in the middle of combat, let alone one that had such outrageous healing effects too.It was a painstaking effort trying to get Nie Yan down to low health. His death was right before their eyes. Then all of a sudden, the situation completely reversed!By now all of Nie Yan\u2019s skills had come off cooldown. The corner of his lips faintly curved into a smile. Now it\u2019s your turn! He turned around and dashed in the direction of the Berserker.The Berserker\u2019s complexion turned deathly white as he watched Nie Yan pounce towards him. Hurriedly, he raised his sword in an attempt to resist.Nie Yan at full health could kill their captain even while being attacked on three sides. Now that Dian Cang was dead, how could just the two of them possibly be a match for Nie Yan!?The dagger in Nie Yan\u2019s hand sliced in a wide arc, then suddenly changed direction mid slash. Concussive Blow! \u300cThwack!\u300dThe Berserker\u2019s greatsword crashed into Nie Yan\u2019s chest. At the same time, the pommel of Nie Yan\u2019s dagger hit the Berserker directly on the forehead!The Berserker sunk into a dazed state.Assassinate! Nie Yan plunged the dagger into the Berserker\u2019s chest. He then followed up with Vital Strike, sending the dagger even deeper into his target. Instantly, the Berserker lost the greater portion of his health.Seeing the Berserker about to come back to his sense, Nie Yan circled behind him and used Smothering Strike, putting him in a dazed state once more.Due to performing a series of attacks and having been in combat so long, Nie Yan was running somewhat low on stamina. Taking a deep breath, he plunged his dagger into the Berserker\u2019s back.Through the sequence of explosive attacks, the Berserker\u2019s health had gone from over a hundred and eighty to a mere sixty within just a few short seconds.If this continues, I\u2019m dead for sure!The Berserker was distraught with fear as he emerged from his dazed state. He frantically fled in the other direction in an attempt to preserve his life.If the Berserker had turned around and attacked Nie Yan, he might\u2019ve still been able to cause some damage. However, he chose not to because he was self-centered and cowardly. Instead, he panicked as soon as he saw his health was low, desperately running for his life just because he was afraid of losing a piece of equipment upon death.\u201cYou think you can escape?\u201d Nie Yan pursued, effortlessly arriving behind the Berserker\u2019s back. He raised his dagger, then successively slashed his opponent several times in the back.\u221223\u221221\u221216\u201cArgh... Dammit\u2014!\u201d The Berserker cursed as his health fell to zero and his vision faded to black. His body collapsed and landed flat on the ground. Just a moment later, a piece of equipment dropped from his corpse.\u201cHeh. It\u2019s finally your turn.\u201d Nie Yan dashed towards the Priest after picking up the Berserker\u2019s dropped equipment. He had taken quite a sore beating from this Priest. From the time he was fighting Dian Cang up until the Berserker just now, this Priest was constantly firing off attacks at him like a buzzing fly.Seeing the Berserker collapsed on the ground, the Priest stared out foolishly. How did he suddenly become the only one remaining in the blink of an eye? He was just a low-level Priest who hadn\u2019t even learned any healing skills. How could he possibly be a match for this Thief?The Priest turned his back and broke into a mad sprint. At that moment, he had completely thrown away any thoughts of trying to fight Nie Yan. No matter what course of action he took, he would still end up dead. Therefore his first instinctual reaction was to flee for his life.Nie Yan was already in pursuit. Mage classes like this Priest were inherently rather slow, so where could a Priest like him possibly escape to?As Nie Yan slashed in quick succession, his dagger easily tore through the Priest\u2019s cloth armour.\u221231\u221232\u221232Several damage values floated above the Priest\u2019s head. Before he had even made a few steps, his body fell forward and collapsed on the ground.Nie Yan walked up to the Priest\u2019s corpse and picked up the piece of equipment that dropped.The equipment the Priest and Berserker dropped were rather ordinary\u2014two pieces of Level 0 equipment that were both White-grade. The best pieces of gear were still the ones that were dropped by the Elementalist: headgear, gloves, mage robes, staff, pants, and boots. Six pieces of equipment in total, and not one less.Fire Chaser Crown: Fire Damage +5Fire Chaser Gloves: Balance +3Fire Chaser Robes: Fire Damage +10Fire Chaser Pants: Willpower +2Fire Chaser Boots: Movement Speed +2It\u2019s the Fire Chaser set! No wonder that Elementalist\u2019s damage was so high! The equipment for this set came from the Level 3 instance, Black Flame Forest. Before Level 5 instances were released, this set was regarded as the best possible equipment for Mages that focused on fire magic. Of course, because it was good, the set pieces had a rather low drop rate. It would take at least four or five runs through the Black Flame Forest to collect all the pieces required to complete the entire set.Besides the Fire Chaser set, there was also a Silver-grade Level 0 Tempered Blue Staff. It had the additional properties of Magic +3 and Elemental Damage +5.Nie Yan reckoned that Dian Cang\u2019s intestines were now green with regret. Even if Dian Cang continued killing Tang Yao and his party members until they dropped back to Level 0, it still wouldn\u2019t be worth losing every single piece of equipment on his body.Not bad... he even had a Silver-grade staff, Nie Yan thought to himself. If he were to put this staff up for auction, it would at the very least sell for three silvers.This Bronze-grade Fire Chaser set can be equipped by both Elementalists and Arcane Mages because both of these classes have fire magic. Elementalists are able to control the fire elements, whereas Arcane Mages are able to control arcane fire. Nie Yan could gift Tang Yao this Fire Chaser set as a present. As for the Silver-grade staff, Tang Yao wasn\u2019t able to use it. As such, Nie Yan thought about selling it and using the money for other expenses. If not, he could always exchange it for one or two pieces of equipment instead.\u300c Where are you right now? Tell me your coordinates. \u300d\u300c 231.395.285, there\u2019s a cave in that area where Level 5 monsters spawn inside. I\u2019m in that cave right now, hiding in a corner and afraid to come out. \u300d\u300c I killed three members from the Radiant Sacred Flame guild. One of them was called Dian Cang or something. \u300d\u300c You killed Dian Cang? You\u2019re not lying to me, are you? That bastard was too damned overpowered. He took out three of my party members all by himself. With his magic damage, a single Fireball was able to take out half our health. \u300dTo Tang Yao, Nie Yan killing Dian Cang was an amazing and unimaginable outcome.\u300c The guy\u2019s name was marked in bright red. He dropped every single piece of equipment from his body when he died. Here, this is his equipment. It\u2019s the Fire Chaser set. I\u2019ll give it to you as a gift. \u300dBrother, I was lucky to have you watch out for me in my past life. I\u2019ve burdened you with much too many things. Before I even got to repay you back, I ended up reincarnating. Brother! In this life, I\u2019ll be the one to watch out for you instead! Nie Yan inwardly thought as he shared the Fire Chaser set with Tang Yao.Tang Yao\u2019s mouth was agape. His face was filled with surprise as he stared at the equipment Nie Yan shared with him.\u300c This isn\u2019t real, right? \u300dTang Yao slapped himself in the face to confirm he was seeing things clearly. \u300c This set... are you sure you want to gift this to me? \u300dTang Yao naturally knew what this Fire Chaser set signified. It was only possible to get this set after running the Black Flame Forest four or five times. Not to mention that teams would often get wiped while running it as well. If he were to wear this set and enter an instance with another party, then it could be said that from the value of this set alone, it was certain that those members would rush to recruit him into their team.\u300c Do you think I\u2019m making fun of you or something!? \u300dNie Yan scolded Tang Yao and laughed.\u300c Even if I die today, it\u2019ll still be worth it. Although I\u2019m only eighteen years old this year and still haven\u2019t experienced many serious matters in life, what I\u2019m most proud of is that I managed to find a brother like you ! \u300dTang Yao emotionally exclaimed. He naturally understood Nie Yan\u2019s financial situation. This Fire Chaser set... if Nie Yan were to put it up at a transaction platform for real money, the price he\u2019d fetch would be quite considerable. Yet Nie Yan was actually preparing to send him this set as a gift. This proved that Nie Yan truly regarded him as a brother.Nie Yan thought back to the past. What he had wanted to say the most to Tang Yao in his past life were those words as well.\u300c When it comes to brothers like us, there\u2019s no need to be polite! Wait up, I\u2019m going to kill a few more of them, \u300dNie Yan informed. He still had twenty-five minutes remaining where he was allowed to retaliate in self-defense.\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd42 \ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd41 \ud83c\udd44\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd3b\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd33 \ud83c\udd35\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd41\ud83c\udd42\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd3d\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd45\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd3b-\ud83c\udd31\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd3d.\ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd3c\u300c I never thought that a guy like you would be so gifted at playing this game. When I listened to your advice earlier in the day, everything suddenly became clear to me, and my skill significantly improved. Otherwise, I would\u2019ve never been able to hold on up until now, \u300dTang Yao informed. He admired Nie Yan from the bottom of his heart. After seeing his performance today, he couldn\u2019t help but view Nie Yan in a whole new light.His equipment would vastly improve with this Fire Chaser set, and he would enter the ranks of experts.In the past, Tang Yao had regarded Nie Yan as a poor and pitiful brother. One whom he would have watch out for in everything. But now, Nie Yan\u2019s actions had caused him to look up to and admire Nie Yan. For the first time, he felt this brother of his was quite truly, a capable person.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22 - Deer ChiefPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 22 \u2013 Deer Chief\u300c Arcane Mages only have so many skills. So all you need to do is put on that Fire Chaser set, practice your skills for a bit, and you\u2019ll find yourself improving in no time. \u300d\u300c There are over twenty people. How do you plan on dealing with all of them? \u300dTang Yao asked. No matter how strong Nie Yan was, he was still just a single person.\u300c This is the difference between Thieves and other professions. Thieves don\u2019t necessarily have to attack head on! \u300dThe expertise of a Thief lay in their ability to set ambushes.Tang Yao somewhat understood when he heard these words. Nie Yan was preparing to mount a sneak attack, catch them off guard and take them out one by one. However, this wasn\u2019t going to be easy to pull off. If he wasn\u2019t careful and ended up getting caught, then he would most likely end up dead. Tang Yao couldn\u2019t help but think that perhaps Nie Yan was being a bit too confident.Small hilltops stretched out as far as the eye could see. They were covered in dense thickets of trees and strangely shaped boulders that towered over the landscape. Small streams flowed at the base of each hillside, where dense amounts of stone and rubble could be seen littering the nearby area. The terrain of this place was quite complicated. It was no wonder that Tang Yao could hide in this area for so long without anyone discovering him.Off in the distance, a few indistinct figures could be seen at the top of one of these hillsides. Nie Yan sprinted off in that direction.Tang Yao was hiding within a cave on that exact hilltop.This group of scoundrels was rather unrelenting. They seemed to be fine wasting their time trying to completely exterminate Tang Yao\u2019s party, simply because a minor conflict had arisen between the two of them. They were truly too vicious, and the only reason they dared to act in such a way was because they noticed that Tang Yao\u2019s group didn\u2019t have a guild backing them up. Therefore, even if Tang Yao and his friends were killed off, they would have no one to bring up their grievances to. Today the Radiant Sacred Flame members were killing Tang Yao\u2019s group in order to make them drop a level. They did this with the intent of impeding their progress. This was to prevent Tang Yao and his party from becoming more troublesome when they leveled up in the future.Nie Yan traveled through the dense thickets. He was only around a hundred meters away from the cave that Tang Yao was hiding in.\u300c I\u2019m not too far away from you. For now, it\u2019s best you don\u2019t come out, so just keep hiding. \u300d\u300c Be careful, they aren\u2019t weak. \u300dTang Yao knew what Nie Yan wanted to do, and couldn\u2019t help but worry a little.\u300c No worries. With their levels, I\u2019ll be able to easily toy with them to death. \u300dNie Yan\u2019s bag was full of potions, his gear was Bronze-grade, and he had learned many new skills. Furthermore, he possessed the immensely overpowered Intermediate Combat Medic skill. Killing one or two of them wouldn\u2019t be a problem for him at all.Tang Yao felt that Nie Yan had changed a great deal. In fact, he had changed so much that Tang Yao didn\u2019t even recognize him anymore. The cowardly Nie Yan of the past wouldn\u2019t dare to say such words.Nie Yan had become a lot more confident compared to his past self. Not only that, but he also gave off the feeling that you could firmly place your trust in him.While Nie Yan and Tang Yao were talking, a slight rustling noise could be heard off in the distance.\u300cThey\u2019re here.\u300dNie Yan\u2019s eyebrows raised as he took cover behind a tree.A party of five was moving through the nearby thickets.Nie Yan observed the composition of their party: an Elementalist, a Holy Mage, a Berserker, a Fighter, and a Paladin. The frontliners took the lead while the two casters followed from behind. This was a rather standard formation. Their equipment didn\u2019t look like anything special either. Within the current player base, those who could wear Bronze-grade or Silver-grade equipment were few in number.The dense thickets were full of branches that grew without restraint and got in the way. These branches made it very difficult for the group of five to move forward, as they had no choice but to duck their heads and travel through small gaps between the trees. The Berserker even had to use his sword to chop down the occasional thick branch that would obstruct their path.\u201cCaptain Dian Cang was killed,\u201d the Fighter said as he looked at the team chat.\u201cHow\u2019s that possible? With the Captain\u2019s strength, there are very few people capable of beating him,\u201d the Paladin replied in a surprised tone. Dian Cang\u2019s strength was publicly recognized amongst all of them. With the Fire Chaser set, his damage was at least within the top ten in the entire guild. Not to mention his skill in combat wasn\u2019t bad either.\u201cThe Captain\u2019s name was still marked red. Which means that all that equipment on his body...?\u201d the Elementalist raised his head to look at everyone and discovered the gloomy expressions on each of their faces. None of them dared to ask what happened next.\u201cEverything dropped,\u201d the Fighter gloomily exclaimed. They truly were unlucky today.\u201cWho did it?\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd42 \ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd41 \ud83c\udd44\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd3b\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd33 \ud83c\udd35\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd41\ud83c\udd42\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd3d\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd45\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd3b-\ud83c\udd31\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd3d.\ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd3c\u201cThey must have had a lot of people, right?\u201d the Elementalist questioned. In his mind, there should have been no other way. Whoever killed Dian Cang must\u2019ve brought many people in order to do so. \u201cWhich team was it, or was it perhaps the work of a guild? We\u2019ll exterminate them!\u201d\u201cThe enemy was only a single Thief,\u201d the Fighter replied. When he had heard the news himself, he too felt that it was inconceivable.\u201cWait, weren\u2019t there two other people with the Captain?\u201d\u201cIndeed. However, that one Thief managed to kill all three of them.\u201dWhat? How is that possible!?\u201cWhat level was the Thief?\u201d\u201cLevel 3.\u201dA single Level 3 Thief managed to kill Dian Cang and his party. This was simply too crazy! Everyone felt that such a thing was simply outrageous.\u201cAre you sure you aren\u2019t mistaken?\u201d\u201cThis piece of information came straight from the mouth of the Captain himself.\u201dThe information couldn\u2019t be false. After all, a single Level 3 had wiped out his entire party. For Dian Cang, this definitely wasn\u2019t something he was proud of. If the information wasn\u2019t true, then he wouldn\u2019t be proclaiming it everywhere.\u201cWhat was that Thief\u2019s name?\u201d the Elementalist asked. Currently, the level difference among the player base wasn\u2019t high. Being able to fight one versus two was already a huge accomplishment, but being able to win one versus three... this person must have had some kind of god level combat ability.\u201cHe\u2019s called Nie Yan (Nirvana Flame), and the guild\u2019s put out a hit order on him. The reward for killing him once is five silvers. In the future, if anyone encounters this player, they are to remain vigilant. Captain Dian Cang said that person has a lot of skills. Unless your party is over three members, it\u2019s best not to seek him out with the intent of provoking him,\u201d the Fighter announced. Although the reward for killing Nie Yan was luxurious, they were still required to put their lives on the line to do it. Dian Cang was unable to defeat him, let alone them.\u201cFive silvers is a lot of money!\u201d the Elementalist and the others exclaimed in amazement. Five silvers was more than enough for them to buy several pieces of Bronze-grade equipment.While these people were deep in discussion, Nie Yan had stealthily made his way over to them.A kill order from the Radiant Sacred Flame Guild? Interesting... I\u2019d like to see how you intend to do that. Nie Yan smiled disdainfully as he approached from behind and confirmed the positions of the five people.The closest one to him was the Holy Mage at about three meters away. The next was the Elementalist at about five meters. The furthest away were the Berserker, Fighter, and Paladin, who were clearing the way ahead.Occasionally, one or two Level 3 Deer would appear in this area. However, they would be swiftly killed by these five people. Three powerful members who could fight in close combat, along with two Mages who had high magic damage made killing monsters especially quick.Nie Yan was waiting for the right opportunity as he leisurely followed them from behind.The Holy Mage seemed to have sensed something and turned his head back to look around.Nie Yan hurriedly hid behind a nearby tree. He hadn\u2019t activated Stealth yet, instead, he was relying entirely on his own awareness. As he ducked away from this Holy Mage\u2019s line of sight, the shade from the tree concealed his body. The Thief\u2019s innate concealing abilities would automatically reveal its effects.Everything was serene. The Holy Mage didn\u2019t discover anything strange. Could it have just been my imagination?\u201cThere are monsters ahead. Hurry up and catch up with us,\u201d the Elementalist turned his head and said to the Holy Mage who was lagging behind.\u201cOh, alright,\u201d the Holy Mage replied, and quickened his pace to catch up.Hearing the conversation between those two people, Nie Yan\u2019s heartbeat jumped. His opportunity had arrived. He entered stealth and slightly accelerated his pace.\u201cThere\u2019s a Leader-class Deer. Everyone be careful!\u201d the Fighter yelled out as he raised his round wooden shield and slowly proceeded forward.\u201cWe\u2019re not searching for that Arcane Mage anymore?\u201d\u201cWe have no idea where that brat ran off to. In any case, the situation has turned out like this. Let\u2019s kill this Deer Chief first, then we\u2019ll discuss it afterward.As it was five of them versus a single Deer Chief, they expected an easy fight.A huge Deer emerged from the thickets ahead. It had a build similar to that of a Bison, and its entire body was covered in white spots. Immense antlers that resembled overgrown coral sprouted from its head. The deer lowered its head, its antlers reaching down past its knees, and prepared to charge.The moment the Deer Chief moved, the muscles in its forelimbs incessantly trembled, brimming with an explosive power.The moment it saw the Fighter approaching, it lowered its antlers and issued a warning cry, then slowly began moving forward.Deer Chief (Leader): Level 3Health: 200/200\u201cAre you guys ready?\u201d the Fighter nervously shouted back to his allies. His Wooden Round Shield and the Deer\u2019s antlers were only a few meters apart, yet he was still able to feel the powerful and imposing pressure that emanated from this Deer Chief\u2019s robust body.\u201cReady.\u201d\u201cWe have to kill this Deer Chief before Fei Zha, Xia Ku, and the others arrive,\u201d the Fighter instructed. If the five of them killed this Deer Chief now, then the loot would be distributed evenly amongst the five of them. However, if the others were to arrive, then they wouldn\u2019t receive much after distributing it evenly.The Berserker and Paladin were flanking from both sides, while the Holy Mage and Elementalist took their positions away from the front.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Due to their ability to wield a shield, Fighters had a much higher defense when compared to other professions. Because of this, the Deer Chief was only able to deal ten or so damage to the Fighter when it attacked. However, if the Deer Chief were to switch aggro onto the Berserker or Paladin... they would at most be able to survive five attacks.Monsters would initially focus their aggro on whoever attacked them first. However, in the event that there was someone who dealt too much damage to a monster, or a player\u2019s level or power was exceedingly low, the monster\u2019s aggro would switch onto them.\u201cWe know. You can relax,\u201d replied the Berserker and Paladin.The Holy Mage and Elementalist at the back began casting spells and dealing damage.Their coordination would be considered about average. It seemed that killing the Deer Chief within the next few moments wouldn\u2019t be a problem for them. Only, they weren\u2019t aware of the danger that was quietly approaching from behind.Nie Yan stealthily made his way behind the Holy Mage and Elementalist. Only a few steps more and he would close the distance between them. The two Mages were standing quite close to each other, and their attention was focused entirely on the Deer Chief.It appeared that the Deer Chief would be dead within the next thirty seconds. The party members were filled with an endless amount of excitement when they thought about all the loot they would receive.Before Nie Yan\u2019s eyes, the heads of the Holy Mage and Elementalist were completely exposed.Nie Yan\u2019s pacing slowed as he drew closer, as he needed to be more cautious when he neared his target. Otherwise, there was a possibility that the prey within his grasp would slip away.Patience was another major quality that defined a Thief\u2019s competence. After all, the outcome of their battles often depended on whether their first strike was a success or not. Of course, there was also an endless amount of sneaking and preparation which led up to that first strike. If a Thief lacked patience, it would be very easy for others to find flaws and catch them.The battle between this group of players and the Deer Chief was about to reach its climax. The Deer Chief had been unceasingly ramming its antlers against the Fighter, causing the latter\u2019s health to rapidly fall. When his health fell to around twenty, the Fighter took out a Basic Health Potion and drank it.\u201cKeep it up, everyone! The Deer Chief only has half its health remaining!\u201d the Fighter shouted as he raised his shield and slashed forward with his sword again.The Berserker and Paladin followed suit, increasing their attack speed. While in combat with the Deer Chief, their health had fallen to about half. The only ones who hadn\u2019t received any damage were the two Mages in the back.\u201cLei Zi, fall back a bit. Why are you so far forward?\u201d the Fighter admonished to the Berserker.\u201cI know, I know.\u201d The Berserker hurriedly pulled back.Evidently, out of the five people in this group, it appeared that this Fighter had the most combat experience.\u201cWhen we\u2019re running a dungeon in the future, you guys absolutely cannot go too far forward. Otherwise, you\u2019re looking to get yourself killed. Realize your mistakes today, and tomorrow we\u2019ll run a small five-man dungeon together. Once you guys get more familiarized with team-based combat, then we can start running larger dungeons with a full team,\u201d the Fighter said. He then took a few steps back, luring the Deer Chief in between two large trees.\u201cWhat activities has the guild been doing lately?\u201d The Berserker\u2019s eyes lit up as he asked.\u201cThere have always been guild activities. The Guild Leader and some of the others have been running the Treant Forest and Dark Wetlands for a while now. You think you\u2019re good enough to accompany them?\u201d the Fighter asked rhetorically.The people running Treant Forest and Dark Wetlands were all elites in the Radiant Sacred Flame guild. In terms of a player\u2019s defense, attack, health, etc... their guild had harsh requirements. So unless a player\u2019s equipment reached a certain level, or they had good skills, there was basically no chance that they would be allowed to run a dungeon with the elites. In other words, this group of five shouldn\u2019t even dream of going.\u201cThere\u2019s no Level 2 dungeons? You know, like Moose Rat Cavern or Skeleton Cave?\u201d the Berserker asked. These dungeons were also twenty-person instances. They were easier and the equipment that could be looted wasn\u2019t bad either. That was why running one of these dungeons would help them upgrade their equipment in preparation for the higher ranked ones.\u201cThe Guild Leader will be organizing something in a few days, so let\u2019s focus on raising our levels for now. Be careful and don\u2019t let your attention wane. But for now, let\u2019s get rid of this Deer Chief. Who knows? It might drop some decent equipment.\u201d The Fighter took two more steps back. His retreat was firm and stable.The Holy Mage and Elementalist copied him and retreated a few steps back as well.Nie Yan noticed the opposing Fighter was rather decent. His ability to pull aggro was quite good. As soon as he noticed the Deer Chief was about to switch its aggro, he would strike it with his shield and attract its attention again.With its aggro constantly being attracted and pulled, the Deer Chief was unable to display its full fighting strength.Were it not for this Fighter, this team wouldn\u2019t have stood a chance against this Level 3 Deer Chief.Nie Yan\u2019s movements were extremely cautious in order to prevent being detected by the Holy Mage and Elementalist. However, they unexpectedly started retreating back towards him.\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd42 \ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd41 \ud83c\udd44\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd3b\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd33 \ud83c\udd35\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd41\ud83c\udd42\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd3d\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd45\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd3b-\ud83c\udd31\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd3d.\ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd3cFor f*cks sake... Nie Yan thought. The Holy Mage had already retreated back to where he was hiding.Nie Yan raised his dagger and struck down, aiming at the back of the Holy Mage\u2019s head.\u201cSmothering Strike!\u201dHis dagger hit the Holy Mage and put him under a dazed state.\u201cSomeone\u2019s trying to steal our kill!\u201d the Elementalist beside them noticed the commotion and turned his head, immediately discovering Nie Yan. Yet before even half of these words could come out of his mouth, Nie Yan dashed over and used the handle of his dagger to strike the Elementalist in the forehead.\u201cConcussive Blow!\u201dAfter successfully stunning his target, Nie Yan followed up with Assassinate, Lacerate, and finished it off with a Vital Strike aimed at his opponent\u2019s throat.Nie Yan\u2019s actions were quite fast. In just a short amount of time, he managed to inflict a massive amount of damage.\u221220\u221222\u221229\u221236Four damage values floated above the Elementalist\u2019s head. By the time the Elementalist came out of his dazed state, he was left with only eighteen health remaining.The Mage had gone into a state of panic\u2014Nie Yan\u2019s damage was just too terrifying.\u22125\u22125Two more damage values floated above the Elementalist\u2019s head in succession.The Elementalist hurriedly took out a Basic Health Potion. Just as the bottle touched his lips... Nie Yan\u2019s dagger flashed into view and lightly slashed across his chest.\u22128 A damage value floated atop his head.The Elementalist staggered back and reached out as if to grasp something, but his hand found only empty air. Soon after, he collapsed on the ground as his health bar fell to zero.\u201cThat\u2019s one down,\u201d Nie Yan whispered to himself as he picked up the piece of equipment that the Elementalist dropped.By this time the Holy Mage had come out of his daze. But, unluckily for him, Nie Yan had already finished off the Elementalist. The Holy Mage turned tail and attempted to escape, but how could Nie Yan possibly give him such an opportunity?Nie Yan brandished his dagger and gave chase to the fleeing Mage. After catching up, he unleashed a barrage of attacks on the Holy Mage\u2019s back.\u221212\u221213\u221215Without exception, every single one of his skills was on cooldown. Therefore Nie Yan could only use a normal attack. However, due to a Thief\u2019s attack speed being innately fast, the damage dealt was still quite considerable.The Holy Mage wasn\u2019t about to go down without a fight, though. He turned around and hit Nie Yan with Holy Strike, then followed up with Holy Smite\u2014dealing a total of fifty-three damage.During all this, the Fighter, Berserker, and Paladin had continued fighting with the Deer Chief. They became aware of the situation after noticing that, all of a sudden, the constant damage from their Mages in the rear had suddenly disappeared.\u201cSomeone mounted a sneak attack! It\u2019s that Thief, Nie Yan (Nirvana Flame)!\u201d the Fighter anxiously shouted. Why did this scoundrel have to suddenly appear during such a crucial moment in their fight against the Leader class monster?In addition, Nie Yan still had over twenty minutes of Retaliation Time left!\u201cWhat are we gonna do!?\u201d Little by little, the Berserker slowly retreated. Their current circumstances were quite unfavourable. They were suffering from a pincer attack, with the Deer Chief attacking from the front and Nie Yan attacking from the rear. The three frontliners had been constantly dealing with the Deer Chief, which was why each of them had a little under half their health remaining. If they were even a little careless, it was very likely that all five of them would die here today. In the blink of an eye, Nie Yan had taken out their Elementalist. Their other Mage was still alive, but he barely had any health left. The way things were looking, the situation was about to become even more worrisome!\u201cFirst, kill the Deer Chief; we\u2019ll deal with the rest later!\u201d the Fighter instructed. The Deer Chief\u2019s aggro was completely focused on them. If they ignored the Deer Chief and went after Nie Yan instead, it would definitely cause them trouble later on.The Deer Chief doesn\u2019t have much health left!\u201cCleave!\u201dThe Fighter cleaved down with his sword. The Berserker and Paladin also quickened their pace as they unceasingly hacked at the Deer Chief.\u201cFlame Slash!\u201d\u201cRadiant Slash!\u201dThe Berserker and Paladin each used their most powerful skills, with the intent of causing high amounts of damage. One after another, damage values drifted up from the Deer Chief\u2019s head.It was a race against time for both sides.The battle between Nie Yan and the Holy Mage was also nearing its climax. The two continued to battle as they ran, with one fleeing from the other. Nie Yan constantly maneuvered his way around the Holy Mage and repeatedly slashed at his exposed back. Wherever the dagger struck, blood would spurt out.The Holy Mage continuously unloaded magic spells as he attempted to break away from Nie Yan.Gradually, both their health bars fell. However, it was clear that the Holy Mage\u2019s health was falling faster. He hurriedly took out both a Basic Health Potion and a Basic Recovery Potion, then drank them.+3+3Before even a few seconds had passed, Nie Yan struck out and interrupted the healing from the Basic Recovery Potion.\u221218\u221215\u201cRun over here!\u201d The Fighter was burning with anxiety as he yelled out. He was fighting the Deer Chief while also keeping a close eye on the battle between Nie Yan and the Holy Mage. It was clear to him that his teammate wasn\u2019t much of a match for this Thief.The Holy Mage was down to only thirty-six health.\u201cDamn that bastard. Isn\u2019t he targeting us on purpose?\u201d the Fighter cursed as he continuously slashed at the Deer Chief. After taking out Dian Cang and his group, Nie Yan suddenly appeared here. This definitely wasn\u2019t a coincidence. Don\u2019t tell me... this Thief is friends with that Arcane Mage and his group?\u201cNie Yan, I\u2019ll remember you! Our Radiant Sacred Flame guild definitely won\u2019t let you off easily!\u201d the Berserker furiously shouted.\u201cI\u2019m extremely honoured. I\u2019ll gladly await you maggots at any time,\u201d Nie Yan replied with an indifferent expression. At this point in time, Radiant Sacred Flame was but a small guild. Even if you were to add up all their members, they still wouldn\u2019t surpass a thousand. They certainly didn\u2019t have the time or energy to search everywhere for Nie Yan and Tang Yao. Granted, even if they were able to find Tang Yao and Nie Yan, they still couldn\u2019t possibly dispatch the entire guild after them. Besides, if they were to send everyone over and he decided that he couldn\u2019t afford to take them on, then couldn\u2019t he just hide instead?In the past, Nie Yan had single-handedly caused the five guilds under the Cao Xu Financial Group to scramble after him. Even their several hundred thousand people were incapable of dealing with him, so why would Nie Yan fear a small fry like Radiant Sacred Flame guild?Not to mention that the reincarnated Nie Yan was definitely much more difficult to deal with than the Nie Yan from the past.So what was there for him to be afraid of?\u201cEven if your backup arrives, they\u2019ll simply be sending side dishes!\u201d [1] Nie Yan said with contempt. He stabbed his dagger into the Holy Mage\u2019s chest, finishing him off. Glancing at his own health bar, he saw that he still had a little over fifty remaining. This number was within his expectations.Nie Yan dashed over to where the Warriors were. The Deer Chief\u2019s health had been whittled down to where it had only around ten percent remaining. Nie Yan was preparing to snatch whatever equipment dropped from the Deer Chief.\u201cKill!\u201d the Fighter furiously yelled while using Shield Strike to push the Deer Chief back.Suddenly, the Deer Chief started to waver.\u201cLinear Slash!\u201d the Berserker tightly gripped his greatsword and slashed at the Deer Chief.\u221215A damage value floated above the Deer Chief\u2019s head. It was a critical strike!The Deer Chief let out a miserable whine and then collapsed.The Fighter quickly bent down, picked up the item that the Deer Chief dropped, and threw it into his bag.\u201cI was just a step too late.\u201d Nie Yan halted his movements upon seeing the Fighter pick up the loot, and then began retreating back.The Fighter only had a quarter of his health remaining, the Berserker had about forty percent, and the Paladin had thirty-five percent. Although they had low health, facing these three close combat professions together certainly wasn\u2019t as simple as it seemed. Not to mention his dagger wouldn\u2019t do much damage against professions with thick armour\u2014such as the Fighter. I can\u2019t deal with the three of them. I\u2019ll be better off not taking this risk, Nie Yan thought to himself.The Fighter and the two others weren\u2019t willing to take such risks to block off Nie Yan either, as they didn\u2019t have much health remaining. Thus they just stood and waited as their health slowly recovered. Having only gained a single piece of Bronze grade equipment after losing two people in the fight against the Deer Chief, they certainly weren\u2019t looking at a profitable outcome.\u201cTwo more were killed,\u201d the Fighter whispered under his breath as he stared daggers at Nie Yan. If they were to calculate their losses now, a total of five members from the Radiant Sacred Flame guild had been killed by Nie Yan\u2019s hands today.Nie Yan wasn\u2019t very far from his enemies. Both sides stood still, simply staring at each other. Neither party dared to attack rashly. Although they all had low health, the three of them together could definitely take on Nie Yan. However, if they were separated, then who could say what the outcome might be.A single Thief had frightened these three Warriors to the point where they didn\u2019t dare to take action. This was simply a huge loss of face. Their expressions showed a hint of anger and humiliation.Nie Yan extended his right hand forward, raised a certain finger, and made an amusing yet disdainful gesture.\u201cThe three of you aren\u2019t going to come? If you\u2019re not coming, I might as well leave then.\u201d Nie Yan glanced at the three and laughed mockingly. His eyes seemed to be focused on something deeper within the thickets. Movement and activity could be seen to the south, east, and west of his current position. He reckoned that the other Radiant Sacred Flame members were moving closer in an attempt to encircle him.Nie Yan didn\u2019t dare to be careless and hastily started retreating back. He moved like a hare as he dashed through the gaps between trees.\u201cReinforcements have arrived! Block him and don\u2019t let him escape!\u201d The Fighter ordered as he gave chase to Nie Yan.The Berserker and Paladin followed closely from behind.\u300c Why did it take you guys so long to get here? \u300dthe Fighter said gloomily in voice chat.\u300c We found out where that Arcane Mage was hiding and almost managed to catch him. If you guys hadn\u2019t gotten in trouble, that bastard would already be dead. What happened over on your side? \u300d\u300c Dao Zi and Huang Ni were killed, \u300dthe Fighter replied.\u300c What happened? Weren\u2019t they together with you guys? \u300d\u300c It was the work of that Thief called Nie Yan (Nirvana Flame) again. He mounted a sneak attack against us and killed Dao Zi and Huang Ni, \u300dthe Fighter explained. He hid the fact that he and his party members had been fighting a Deer Chief at the time.\u300c F*ck, it\u2019s that damn Thief again! \u300dThey had never met such a powerful Thief before. Moreover, this scoundrel had been specifically targeting them this whole time.\u300c I reckon he\u2019s friends with that group of people we killed earlier. He escaped north! Let\u2019s chase him! \u300dSeveral figures made their way through the gaps in the thicket.Nie Yan was quite fast. In the blink of an eye, he had already put a large distance between himself and his pursuers. Up ahead, several silhouettes emerged from the trees and flanked him on both sides. He couldn\u2019t go any further forward, and the Fighter and the others were pursuing him from behind. No matter where he ran, he would definitely end up surrounded.Seeing no escape route, Nie Yan hid behind a tree and entered stealth.The Fighter, Berserker, and Paladin, who were pursuing from behind, met up with the several figures who appeared up ahead.\u201cWhat happened? Where is he?\u201d asked the Fighter. He scanned the surroundings and found naught but trees and empty space. Where had Nie Yan disappeared to?\u201cDid he run off?\u201d\u201cI think he went into stealth. Let\u2019s stay here and search.\u201dThe players spread out and began searching every nook and cranny in the surrounding area.Nie Yan maintained his breathing and made his way out while still under the effects of Stealth.However, people from the Radiant Sacred Flame guild were everywhere, which meant that the crisis was still unabated.\u300c Where are you? What\u2019s the situation? \u300dTang Yao asked through the voice call.\u300c I killed another two, \u300dreplied Nie Yan as he glanced at his knapsack. Although there were two new pieces of equipment inside, they weren\u2019t anything special. Even if he put it up for auction, it would only sell for a few coppers at most.\u300c Awesome! Brat, I\u2019m impressed! \u300dTang Yao exclaimed in admiration. The Radiant Sacred Flame members usually operated in groups of three or four. Tang Yao couldn\u2019t help but wonder how Nie Yan managed to accomplish such a feat.\u300c Where are you right now? \u300dasked Nie Yan.\u300c I encountered a group of Radiant Sacred Flame members just a moment ago. I almost ended up being caught by them, so I fled deeper into the cave. In the end, they left the cave and went back outside. But now I can\u2019t get out; there\u2019re Level 5 monsters everywhere and they\u2019ve got me trapped, \u300dreplied Tang Yao. He guessed the reason why those Radiant Sacred Flame members left was to deal with Nie Yan. This meant Nie Yan had indirectly saved his life. However, the problem was... he was currently in an even more dangerous predicament. The deeper parts of the cave were filled with Level 5 Rock Spiders. If he was even a bit careless, he would most likely lose his life.\u300c Just stay put. I\u2019ll give you a Return Scroll when I get there. \u300d\u300c Having a Return Scroll would make things a lot easier, but can you even get here? The passage is completely blocked by Rock Spiders now. \u300d\u300c We\u2019ll deal with that later. There\u2019s a bit of a problem over on my side, so I\u2019m gonna hang up first. \u300d[1] The side dishes part is a pun because the Chinese slang for \u201cnoob\u201d is the same character as vegetable/side dish. Nie Yan is basically saying that, even if they send more people, they\u2019re all noobs and are going to be food (equipment dropped) for him.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 - Rock Spider CavePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 24 \u2013 Rock Spider CaveNie Yan hung up the call. Gradually his body became more and more transparent until he completely blended in with the dense green thickets that surrounded him. He carefully observed the players who were constantly passing by.Several of these players ran straight past Nie Yan, yet not a single one noticed his presence.\u201cI couldn\u2019t find him. Where the hell could he have gone?\u201d\u201cForget about it. He\u2019s probably already escaped by now,\u201d the Berserker named Lei Zi suggested. A slight fear still lingered in his mind, urging him to leave. After all, ever since Nie Yan had appeared they were always the ones being attacked, never the ones attacking. By now the number of dead on their side totalled five people, yet they weren\u2019t even able to touch a single hair on their opponent\u2019s body. He was an extremely dangerous individual, and it definitely wasn\u2019t worth the risk to continue chasing him down like this. What if they were unable to catch him and were killed instead?\u201cWhat about that Arcane Mage, Yao Zi?\u201d\u201cWe chased him into the Rock Spider Cavern. When that Thief Nie Yan appeared we were called over to help catch him, so we couldn\u2019t chase that Arcane Mage any longer. But don\u2019t worry, I aggroed a bunch of Rock Spiders and lured them near the passage, so I reckon he won\u2019t be getting out anytime soon.\u201d\u201cHang on, I think we should continue searching for that Thief. His stealth should be coming to an end soon, and he\u2019s definitely still in this area!\u201d the Fighter said, unwilling to give up the search. How could he just allow Nie Yan to escape?Nie Yan locked his gaze on the Berserker who only had forty-five percent health remaining. As the Berserker had just been in combat, he didn\u2019t have the time to sit down and recover his health. In addition, the system still considered him to be in a state of combat, which meant that his natural health recovery would be slowed considerably. Though his nearby guildmates gave him a sense of relief, he still kept a tight grip on the Basic Health Potion he was hiding in his left hand .Yet there was one other reason why nobody was restoring their health: the Fighter wouldn\u2019t allow it. He was hoping that their low health would lure Nie Yan out into the open.Even though they couldn\u2019t see Nie Yan, his mere existence forced them to remain cautious.The Berserker also had a Silencing Paladin at full health by his side. The two of them began walking in Nie Yan\u2019s direction.Steadily, they drew closer and closer to where Nie Yan was hiding, yet they still didn\u2019t discover him. It was starting to look like the two would walk right into him.If an enemy were to make contact with a Thief under the effects of Stealth, the skill would immediately come to an end.Nie Yan focused his eyes on the Berserker\u2019s throat, waited for the right moment, and then pounced. Vital Strike! The dagger slashed across the Berserker\u2019s neck, sending blood gushing out.\u221251\u201cHe\u2019s here!\u201d the Berserker cried out in alarm. He quickly retreated back and drank the Basic Health Potion that he had in his hand.However, how could Nie Yan let this Berserker get away? He lunged forward and stabbed his dagger into the Berserker\u2019s chest, then followed up with Lacerate. His dagger ruthlessly cut into his opponent\u2019s flesh. The Berserker\u2019s health, which just been replenished, was once again depleted.Now the Berserker was at low health and suffering from the bleed effect of Lacerate.\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201d Nie Yan\u2019s movements were so quick that the nearby Paladin had only now reacted. He charged towards Nie Yan and slashed down with his sword, which was burning with a radiant splendor.Nie Yan had planned on continuing to pursue the Berserker, but the Paladin coming up from behind forced him to change his plans.Nie Yan\u2019s max health wasn\u2019t very high, so he didn\u2019t dare neglect the oncoming attack. Without a further thought, he dodged to the side, avoiding the blow.The Paladin quickly put himself between Nie Yan and the Berserker, saving his teammate\u2019s life.\u201cWhere is he!?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s over there!\u201dAll of the ten or so members of the Radiant Sacred Flame guild who were in the surrounding area came rushing over. Several of them shot spells in Nie Yan\u2019s direction.When Nie Yan looked at his current situation, he had no choice but to forget about killing the Berserker. Instead of continuing his pursuit, he rolled to the side and dodged the incoming spells. By the time he stood up, the Berserker had already run away.\u300cBang! Bang! Bang!\u300dNie Yan\u2019s location was bombarded with spells. Most of them missed their target and harmlessly exploded off the surrounding trees.However one of them managed to hit Nie Yan.\u221223With the nimbleness of a hare, Nie Yan madly dashed through the thickets and quickly put more than twenty meters between himself and the Mages behind. He would soon be out of their attack range.At this moment, the Berserker who thought he was a safe distance away from the combat was actually not all that safe.\u201cDammit, I\u2019m bleeding!\u201d the Berserker gloomily cursed. His Basic Health Potion was still on cooldown, so he had to resort to drinking a Basic Recovery Potion. However not even the healing from the potion could overcome the constant damage from bleeding.\u22125, +3, \u22125, +3, \u22125In the end, his struggle was futile. Five seconds after drinking the potion, the Berserker\u2019s health fell to zero and he died.With his death, Nie Yan had taken out yet another one of the Radiant Sacred Flame guild\u2019s members!However the Berserker suffered a bit of injustice in his death. Unlike the others who died in combat, he just watched as his own health bled out until he died.The Fighter felt a slight chill run down his spine. This Thief by the name of Nie Yan (Nirvana Flame) truly was just too terrifying! They had no way of restraining him. The Fighter picked up the equipment that the Berserker dropped\u2014a Bronze-grade piece of armour. Thankfully for them, it didn\u2019t end up in Nie Yan\u2019s hands.Though Nie Yan had taken out one of his opponents he wasn\u2019t out of danger just yet. Up ahead, a Battle Thief and a Paladin blocked his way forward.\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd42 \ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd41 \ud83c\udd44\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd3b\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd33 \ud83c\udd35\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd41\ud83c\udd42\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd3d\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd45\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd3b-\ud83c\udd31\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd3d.\ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd3cMeanwhile, several spells were being launched at him from behind.Seeing this, Nie Yan hurriedly applied a bandage to himself. +20, +20, +20\u300cBang! Bang! Bang!\u300d \u221223, \u221222, \u221220 A bombardment of spells smashed into Nie Yan, interrupting the healing from his bandages.Nie Yan lowered his head and glanced at his health bar\u2014seventeen health remaining. While doing this he also sucked in his stomach and made some slight maneuvers, causing two attacks to pass through empty air. The Paladin\u2019s greatsword had just barely grazed Nie Yan\u2019s cheek as it streaked by, and the Battle Thief\u2019s dagger had harmlessly cut into the air where his stomach had been moments prior.What mattered most in a direct confrontation such as this one was who had sharper eyes and quicker hands.This was because these confrontations would finish in mere seconds.Though in this confrontation, it was evident that Nie Yan\u2019s skills were much higher.He broke through the blockade that the Battle Thief and Paladin had formed and disappeared into the thickets. In doing so he had put even more space between himself and his opponents.\u201cDamn, this bastard\u2019s fast!\u201d\u201cF*ck! We let him escape again!\u201dThey had been unable to gain any sort of advantage against Nie Yan, even when engaging him in close combat. In the end he escaped after taking the Berserker\u2019s life, putting the total number of dead to six. One after another, the members of the Radiant Sacred Flame guild were being killed off by Nie Yan.\u201cForget it. Let\u2019s just head back,\u201d the Fighter suggested. Unexpectedly, he no longer wished to pursue such an abnormal person like Nie Yan any further.Everyone who heard this looked at each other with gloomy expressions.\u201cAlright...\u201dA hint of helplessness could be heard in their tone. Nie Yan had already successfully escaped, so what else could they do?Thus, the players from the Radiant Sacred Flame guild gathered into groups and departed. While leaving they didn\u2019t dare move more than two meters away from their teammates, as they were still fearful that Nie Yan might suddenly emerge from hiding again.\u300c I killed another one of their members; a Berserker this time. Also their group has just left, \u300dNie Yan informed Tang Yao.Despite being encircled by over ten people, Nie Yan was still able to kill one of their members and then successfully escape. What kind of unimaginably impressive feat was this? Tang Yao burned with excitement as he thought about it. He felt it was a pity that he had chosen to be an Arcane Mage instead of a Thief.\u300c Brother! You should continue taking care of me in the future! \u300dTang Yao laughed happily. The tree that he could rely on for shade was truly refreshing.\u300c No problem, \u300dNie Yan replied straightforwardly. Just as distance determined the stamina of a horse, time would also reveal a person\u2019s true nature. When Nie Yan was at his lowest in his past life, he watched as people deserted him left and right. It was then that he finally understood what it truly meant to have a brother. Brothers would always put each other first. Naturally, he would do the same for Tang Yao.After the players from the Radiant Sacred Flame guild left, Nie Yan made his way over to the cliff face where the Rock Spider Cave was located.The cave entrance was well hidden and emanated a serene darkness. Who knew where it would lead to? Inside, long strands of silk hung from the cave walls and stalagtites above. This silk resembled a veil of vines as it hid the interior of the cave from view.This was a Level 5 area. The number of players who were able to train in this area were few.\u201cRock Spider Cave huh... this place is pretty good,\u201d Nie Yan muttered to himself as he recollected all the information from his past life regarding the cave.Brushing away the webs outside, Nie Yan made his way into the cave. As he went deeper, the floor became slightly muddy and the main entrance began branching off into numerous narrow pathways.Every single one of the Rock Spiders in this area was a Level 5 monster. If he were to face them one on one, then perhaps he would be able to handle them. However, in the event that he encountered more than one, he could only flee for his life.\u300cScritch! Scritch!\u300dSharp cries could be heard reverberating from the depths of the cave until they finally faded away.All that remained was an eerie chill from the occasional gust of cold wind that blew in from the depths of the cave.\u300c Tell me your coordinates, \u300dNie Yan said through the voice call.\u300c 352.238.235. Be careful though, there\u2019s over ten Rock Spiders blocking the way here. Are you sure you can reach me? \u300d\u300c I won\u2019t know if I don\u2019t try. \u300dNie Yan glanced at his current coordinates and found that he wasn\u2019t far from Tang Yao. After finishing his conversation, he continued to carefully move through the tunnels.\u300cScritch! Scritch!\u300dNie Yan heard a sharp cry echo out from just an earshot away. A nearby Rock Spider had climbed down from the walls and pounced at him.Nie Yan hurriedly moved backwards after noticing that the spider had launched itself at him. After avoiding the pounce, Nie Yan then stepped forward and retaliated with Concussive Blow.The Rock Spider sunk into a dazed state.Rock Spider: Level 5Health: 108/130Using the momentum from his previous attack, Nie Yan followed up with several more strikes. In addition, he also used Assassinate, Lacerate, and Vital Strike.The Rock Spider continuously threw itself at Nie Yan and attacked. It was two levels higher than him, and thus its damage was fairly high. Every attack that hit dealt at least thirty damage to him.Nie Yan started falling back while still keeping the Rock Spider within his attack range. As he retreated, he would repeatedly stab his dagger into the spider. After twenty seconds of fighting like this, the spider collapsed on the ground and let out a miserable shriek.Nie Yan used this short respite to glance at his health bar. He only had around twenty percent remaining. It appeared even a single Rock Spider was still a threat to him. However there was one upside to fighting them: Rock Spiders granted a great deal of experience upon death. Each spider gave two hundred and eighty experience points. The amount alone was quite generous.The only downside was that no useful drops came from these Rock Spiders.Nie Yan sat down to rest and then ate some bread. Slowly but surely, his health recovered to full and all his skills came off cooldown.With his health recovered and skills once again ready for use, Nie Yan stood up and continued advancing into the darkness of the cave. Up ahead, he noticed three Rock Spiders moving about. After observing the location of each spider, Nie Yan took out his crossbow. He moved close to the nearby wall and aimed at the closest Rock Spider.\u300cWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u300dA line of bolts pierced through the air as they shot out towards their target.\u22125, \u22123, \u22125Three damage values floated upward above the spider\u2019s head.After taking the hits, the spider rushed over to where Nie Yan was hiding.\u300cScritch! Scritch!\u300dIt let out a furious shriek as it pounced towards the one who had injured it.With this, Nie Yan had succeeded in drawing out a single Rock Spider without alerting its companions. When the spider neared his location, he drew his dagger and rushed out to greet it. The two engaged in close combat, with Nie Yan dishing out consecutive attacks. As they fought, numerous damage values appeared one after another above the spider\u2019s head.Within twenty seconds, the Rock Spider was dead. Surprisingly, this spider had dropped something. Nie Yan walked over and picked up the loot: a single copper...After waiting for his health to recover, Nie Yan used his crossbow to draw out the other spiders and kill them one by one, just as he had earlier.Using this tactic, he continued to make his way forward. By the time he finally arrived at Tang Yao\u2019s coordinates, several more spiders had died by his hands. Up ahead there was a wide area where many tunnels intersected. In that area no less than ten Rock Spiders could be seen wandering around.Nie Yan didn\u2019t immediately rush in; instead he just observed the surroundings. It seemed as though passing through this area safely would be quite difficult. Especially considering that he might draw out more than one spider if he were to use his crossbow like before.Two of them, huh... Can\u2019t say for sure if I\u2019ll be able to deal with them, Nie Yan thought to himself. He did have one plan in mind, but it required the use of one of his bandages. There was a problem with this plan though: he didn\u2019t have many bandages left. Not to mention that a single Intermediate Combat Bandage would cost him upwards of twenty coppers in materials. An average person would be hard-pressed to use even a single one due to the high cost.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25 - Silver ChestPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 25 \u2013 Silver ChestNumerous spiders had converged within the wide space where the tunnels intersected. They were constantly patrolling the area, which meant that their positions were ever-changing.Nie Yan patiently waited for an opportunity to arise. He didn\u2019t need to wait long; about half a minute later, the spiders began congregating towards the center. It was then that Nie Yan noticed there was one lone spider that had lagged behind. It loitered off to the side, not too far from where he was.Nie Yan\u2019s eyes lit up; this was his chance! There was no time to lose. He raised his crossbow, aimed at the lone spider, and fired.\u300cPa! Pa! Pa!\u300dThree crossbow bolts lodged themselves into their target, enraging it. The spider immediately turned to face its aggressor and charged.Fortunately, none of the other spiders followed, thus, Nie Yan welcomed its assault with open arms.When their skirmish reached its conclusion, the spider fell to the ground, dead. Nie Yan walked over to its corpse and picked up the single piece of equipment it dropped as loot: a White-grade Level 5 Dark Leather Thief Tunic.The drop rates for equipment were extremely low regardless of which class it belonged to, to the extent that prices for equipment always remained high. For instance, if this leather tunic were to be placed on the marketplace, it would sell for at least six or seven coppers.Nie Yan tossed the leather tunic into his knapsack, then went back to waiting for another opportunity.Within the span of roughly six minutes, he had drawn out and killed another three spiders. Afterward, Nie Yan tallied up the remaining monsters and found that there were still twelve remaining.Unfortunately, these spiders were clumped too closely to be drawn out one at a time.Nie Yan searched for quite some time but was unable to find a suitable position to repeat his earlier tactics.Hmm... this seems to be the best position, though it\u2019s still a bit lacking. I suppose I\u2019ll give it a shot from here, though things might get a little dangerous.Nie Yan raised his crossbow once more and fired. Subsequently, three bolts were sent piercing through the air.\u22125, \u22125, \u22125These bolts struck the body of a nearby Rock Spider.\u300cScritch! Scritch!\u300dThe spider furiously cried out as it charged towards the one who had harmed it. Unlike the previous spiders he had lured, however, this one was being followed closely from behind by another.I aggroed two of them... Nie Yan\u2019s heart tightened as he made a hasty retreat back to one of the narrow tunnels within the cave. The narrowness of this passage meant there would be no room for two spiders to move side by side.When they drew close enough, Nie Yan pulled out his dagger. He directly engaged the Rock Spider he had aggroed first and unleashed a continuous chain of attacks upon it.The spider repeatedly lunged at Nie Yan. One after another, a line of damage values floated up above Nie Yan\u2019s head as they exchanged blows.Ninety-two percent, eighty-seven percent, seventy-two percent... Slowly but surely, Nie Yan\u2019s health continued to fall.While in combat, Nie Yan made sure to maintain awareness of both his surroundings and the positioning of his footsteps. Currently, the only spider capable of attacking him in the narrow tunnel was the one he aggroed first. As for its partner, who had closely followed from behind, it could do nothing more than cry out helplessly.The spider met its end when Nie Yan finally finished it off with Vital Strike. He glanced at his health bar\u2014around a quarter of his health remained\u2014then quickly retreated back from his current positionAlmost immediately after the first spider was killed, its ally who had been helplessly crying from behind lunged forward.Seeing this, Nie Yan hastened his retreat and began applying a Combat Bandage.+20... +20... +20...With each passing second, his health was being restored by a large amount.The Rock Spider repeatedly lunged at Nie Yan as the latter dodged and leaped back in retreat. However, he soon reached an impasse. Approximately five meters behind him, there was another spider. If Nie Yan were to continue moving like he was, then it would undoubtedly be aggroed. Thus, retreating was no longer an option. By this time, his health was restored to eighty percent, so he raised his dagger and ran forward to face the spider head-on.The two parties finally met and clashed. Unfortunately, all of Nie Yan\u2019s skills had yet to come off cooldown. Met with such a situation, all he could do was lash out with regular stabs and slashes.After evading the spider\u2019s lunge, Nie Yan would step forward and counter with successive attacks.Under the barrage of violent attacks from the spider, Nie Yan\u2019s health was quickly dropping. Whereas the spider currently had over sixty percent of its health remaining, Nie Yan only had a third left. In the end, the damage that could be dealt with regular attacks was rather limited. After all, Thieves were a class that relied heavily on their skills to deal damage.Twenty seconds later...Assassinate, Lacerate, and Vital Strike had finally come off cooldown.For Nie Yan, this was undoubtedly a great boon.Not even a moment later, the Rock Spider came leaping forward while baring its fangs.This is my chance!Nie Yan slipped his dagger past the spider\u2019s legs and aimed directly for its head\u2014all while it was still leaping through the air. After his dagger was implanted deeply within the spider\u2019s eye, Nie Yan used the momentum to ruthlessly slash outwards, causing a thick green liquid to ooze from its mutilated head.Despite this, the Rock Spider still managed to use one of its legs to pierce through Nie Yan\u2019s shoulder, dealing thirty-three damage and sending a number floating above his head.Nie Yan quickly glanced at his health bar and found that he had a little over a tenth of his health remaining.That was dangerous!+30He had hastily pulled out a Basic Health Potion and gulped down its contents. His last hit with Vital Strike had taken out thirty-nine points from the spider\u2019s health, but the fight still wasn\u2019t over. The Rock Spider dashed towards Nie Yan with the intent of ramming into him.When the two collided, the spider crashed into Nie Yan\u2019s chest and dealt thirty-five damage to him.After receiving the blow, Nie Yan quickly retreated back several steps.The Rock Spider turned its body to face where its opponent had retreated.Nie Yan swept his eyes over the spider\u2019s health bar and noticed it that only had fifteen health remaining. In comparison, after drinking the Basic Health Potion and taking the spider\u2019s attack directly, he barely had a tenth of his health left. Right now if one of the spider\u2019s attacks were to even slightly graze him, then he would likely meet his end.He quickly took several more steps back as the spider lunged in pursuit.If he were to engage this spider, and if their battle was to be anything like the last, then it would be a mutually assured destruction.\u22125... \u22125...As the spider pounced forward, two damage values popped up above its head one after another.In its final moments, the spider raised its forelimbs and attempted to stab Nie Yan as its lumbering body descended forward.Nie Yan instantly reacted and dodged the spider\u2019s final attack by rolling.\u300cCrash!\u300dThe spider\u2019s body smashed into the ground beside him, creating a large pit in the earth.If he had been just a millisecond too slow, then he would\u2019ve been struck by that attack. Nie Yan broke out into a cold sweat as he thought of how he had just narrowly escaped death.\u22125Finally, the spider\u2019s health had been bled dry. The legs that had been struggling to get up earlier suddenly lost all their ability to support the main body, causing the spider to collapse to the ground.\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92\u300c System: You\u2019ve gained 280 experience points. \u300dThe second Rock Spider had finally met its end... using this short respite, Nie Yan breathed a sigh of relief. Using both arms to support himself, he pushed his body off the ground and propped himself up against the cave wall. Soon, his health gradually started to recover.Pitifully, this spider hadn\u2019t dropped even a single item upon death. What\u2019s worse was that he had been forced to expend a Combat Bandage against a common mob like this Rock Spider. The cost of crafting a single bandage was such that the payout of this battle wasn\u2019t worth his efforts.After a few moments of rest, his health was at last fully restored. That was just too dangerous... If I\u2019m going to lure out more Rock Spiders, then I should definitely avoid aggroing more than one of them at a time.Nie Yan picked himself up off the ground and walked over to the intersection. There was a lot more space to maneuver there now, as only ten spiders remained.However, these ten spiders were moving together in groups of two or three, which made it incredibly difficult for Nie Yan to find an opportunity to strike.At least there\u2019s more room to move around now... I should be able to use Stealth to make my way through here. At Stealth\u2019s current level, I should be able to pass within a meter of these spiders without being detected.Gradually, Nie Yan\u2019s body became increasingly transparent until it completely blended in with the darkness of the cave. Shortly after, he began to slowly make his way forward.As he moved, Nie Yan spotted three spiders approaching him from behind. One was off to his left, about three meters away. The other two were off to his right, about five meters away.Nie Yan carefully observed the positions of each spider and determined their patrol routes as he continued moving ahead.Suddenly, two spiders crawled until they were just two meters away from his current position. Seeing this, Nie Yan quickly halted his footsteps. After a short period of time, the two spiders slowly moved on without having noticed his presence.While Nie Yan was moving forward, he suddenly happened to spot something over in the corner of the room. Nestled between several large rocks was a single chest that faintly glowed with a silver light.The rocks had obstructed his line of view, thus he was only able to see the edge of the silver chest.Son of a b*tch... they really hid it well.Unexpectedly, it\u2019s a silver treasure chest! Nie Yan\u2019s heart rate involuntarily sped up.At the same time, three spiders abruptly halted their movements and looked around.These actions were akin to a bucket of cold water being dumped over his head, causing him to immediately calm down. Right now, it was still too soon to get excited. The duration of Stealth was finite, and he couldn\u2019t afford the luxury of spending the time to open the chest. Thus, he was forced to give up on the chest and leave it for another time.Nie Yan maintained his breathing,Having not discovered anything, the three spiders resumed their patrols and crawled further and further away.Nie Yan carefully crept his way around the remaining spiders until finally making it out of danger. He breathed a sigh of relief. This kind of work definitely wasn\u2019t suited for an average person.After proceeding forward for a while longer, Nie Yan glanced at his coordinates. Finally, I\u2019m here!\u201cTang Yao, where are you?\u201dThe next moment, a figure slowly emerged from the nearby shadows. Who knew what hole this guy had deeply burrowed himself into? By the time he finally crawled out, his body was completely covered in dirt.\u201cHaha, not bad... you hid yourself pretty well,\u201d Nie Yan said with a smile.Tang Yao patted the dirt off his body and gloomily replied, \u201cDon\u2019t say anymore... Anyways, there were so many Rock Spiders over there. How\u2019d you manage to get through?\u201d\u201cStealth,\u201d Nie Yan answered back.\"You can even do that?\u201d Tang Yao\u2019s mind went blank for a moment. That intersection was littered with Rock Spiders. How the hell could a Thief stealth their way through that? It was an incredibly difficult task to pull off!62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 - Locked ChestPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 26 \u2013 Locked Chest\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be able to?\u201d Nie Yan chuckled as he sent Tang Yao a trade request. After the latter accepted, he placed the Fire Chaser set and a single Return Scroll inside the trade window.\u201cY-you\u2019re giving all of this to me?\u201d Tang Yao stared out with a blank face. He never thought the Fire Chaser set would have such high property bonuses.\u201cI got these off of Dian Cang when they dropped from his corpse. There was a staff among those items as well, but it\u2019s not suited for you. Anyways, take this Fire Chaser set with you. As for the Return Scroll... don\u2019t use it just yet, I want you to stay here with me for a bit,\u201d Nie Yan replied. He and Tang Yao were brothers who had known each other since childhood. To put it simply, compared to their friendship, this Fire Chaser set didn\u2019t amount to much.\u201cMhmm... alright. I guess I can\u2019t refuse.\u201d A hint of anticipation flashed through Tang Yao\u2019s eyes.After donning the Fire Chaser set, Tang Yao\u2019s outer appearance improved significantly. If he were to go out now, he would undoubtedly attract many women.\u201cWhat\u2019s your magic damage at now?\u201d Nie Yan asked.\u201cFifty.\u201d To Tang Yao, this amount was something he couldn\u2019t even imagine reaching in the past.\u201cNot bad, you should be able to run some of the harder dungeons and quests with that much. Though it seems your current weapon is still a bit lacking. You should try and find yourself a better one when you return to town,\u201d Nie Yan suggested. Tang Yao receiving this Fire Chaser set for free so suddenly was tantamount to Nie Yan helping him reach the Heavens with a single step. The path he would need to walk in the future had become a lot shorter.Tang Yao kept gazing at the current equipment he was wearing, seemingly unable to stop himself from admiring it.\u201cLet\u2019s stay here and train for a bit. There\u2019s a silver treasure chest up ahead and I want you to tag along and help me retrieve it. Here, I\u2019ll make the party.\u201d With how high Tang Yao\u2019s damage was now, killing Rock Spiders in this cave would be a piece of cake.There was a treasure chest just waiting to be opened. If he didn\u2019t retrieve whatever was inside today, then he wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep soundly at night.\u201cSilver chest, where!?\u201d Tang Yao began burning with excitement. Up until now, he had only ever managed to find and open a single chest, not to mention, it was only a common white one. He had never even seen a silver chest before, let alone open one.\u201cLet\u2019s clear out those Rock Spiders back at that intersection first,\u201d Nie Yan replied. Now, with Tang Yao\u2019s assistance, there would be a lot less pressure on him when dealing with two Rock Spiders. Three Rock Spiders might not even pose a challenge.After arriving at the intersection, Nie Yan took out his crossbow and loaded it. Then he took aim at a nearby spider and fired, sending three bolts flying out of the crossbow in quick succession.\u300cPa! Pa! Pa!\u300dHe ended up aggroing two Rock Spiders with his attack\u2014the one that was hit and its companion in tow. Nie Yan positioned himself in the front while Tang Yao brandished his staff and released an Arcane Fireball and Arcane Blaze from the rear. Every spell he launched would deal over thirty or so damage. Occasionally, he would even score a critical hit, causing two fifties to appear.\u201cThey\u2019re two levels above me, yet I\u2019m able to deal this kind of damage...?\u201d Tang Yao exclaimed while seemingly in a daze. His own damage output had shocked him.Under the combined efforts of their attacks, the two spiders collapsed on the ground by the time Nie Yan\u2019s health had fallen to around fifty percent.Afterward, the two victors took the time to rest up. While Nie Yan sat down and recovered his health, Tang Yao took out some Spring Water and used it to replenish his mana.\u201cWhat\u2019s your experience at?\u201d Nie Yan asked as he stood up, his health having fully recovered.\u201cLevel 3, 56%. How about you?\u201d Tang Yao replied. He had played for over a week to get to this level.\u201cLevel 3, 9%.\u201d Leveling in Conviction was extremely difficult. Each level required an insane amount of experience to level up. Considering that he had just started playing a few days ago, his leveling speed was fast enough to frighten someone. Not even two days had passed and he was already Level 3. If word were to get out, it would definitely frighten many people.\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92While they chatted, Nie Yan used his crossbow to lure out another two spiders and killed them. Repeating this tactic, the entire area was soon completely cleared of monsters.Nie Yan bent down and picked up an item that had dropped from the last Rock Spider. It was a Charge skill book for Warriors. Hmm... The market price for a Charge skill book should be around twenty some coppers right now.Indeed, the drop rate in a Level 5 area is much higher compared to the low-level ones.\u201cWhat\u2019d it drop?\u201d\u201cA Charge skill book.\u201dTang Yao waved his hands and said, \u201cI\u2019m pretty satisfied with just this Fire Chaser set, so you can take all the drops. Besides, I won\u2019t need to start looking for new equipment until I reach Level 5.\u201dTo Nie Yan, however, a single skill book wasn\u2019t of much value either. In the end, he didn\u2019t even try to argue with Tang Yao and threw the Charge skill book into his knapsack.Since the two of them were in a party, they had to share the experience gained through combat. Thanks to Tang Yao\u2019s high damage, however, their pace had sped up significantly. Therefore they were gaining experience at a much faster rate than when they were by themselves, which made up for the fact that it was being shared.With the spiders all cleared out, Nie Yan walked over to where he had spotted the chest earlier.As he neared its location, he discovered many strange engravings and patterns etched into the top of the chest. These designs were extremely elaborate. In addition, there was a lock on this chest that kept it firmly sealed.\u201cDamn, I haven\u2019t learned Lockpicking yet.\u201d Lockpicking was a skill that could only be learned after reaching Level 5. Not to mention, the skill book that taught it was extremely expensive as well. And since this was a Level 5 map, a locked chest appearing wouldn\u2019t be unexpected.\u201cWell, what are we going to do then?\u201d Tang Yao asked. This was the first time he had ever come across a silver chest, and it was going to end with this kind of outcome?\u201cLet\u2019s leave it for now and try to get to Level 5 as quickly as possible. Who knows? By that time, that chest might still be here,\u201d Nie Yan helplessly replied.Just as Nie Yan and Tang Yao were preparing to leave and go back to training, a nearby boulder suddenly began trembling.\u201cW-what\u2019s that?\u201d Tang Yao asked after being startled.The trembling boulder was quite large, roughly twice the size of an ordinary Rock Spider, and had a hard and coarse surface. Had it not been trembling, it would\u2019ve perfectly blended in with the numerous other boulders that were strewn about the area.Abruptly, eight legs extended out of this \u2018boulder\u2019 as it stood up. Once it was fully upright, it gradually opened its eyes, revealing eight mossy green lights.\u300cScritch! Scritch!\u300dIt let out a shrill cry. The boulder was actually a Rock Spider!\u201cIt\u2019s a Leader-class Rock Spider!\u201d Nie Yan\u2019s heart tightened. He immediately entered stealth and made his way around it, positioning himself behind its back.Rock Spider (Elite): Level 5Health: 180/180The spider glanced at its surroundings and quickly locked its gaze onto Tang Yao\u2019s position.Tang Yao looked back at the spider and saw his own image being reflected in its eyes. This, combined with the spider\u2019s sinister appearance, was especially terrifying to him. He immediately turned back and began to retreat.\u201cWhat are we gonna do!? This is a Level 5 Leader-class Rock Spider!\u201d Tang Yao nervously exclaimed. The strongest mob he\u2019d ever encountered up until now was a measly Level 3 Leader-class. Not to mention, this was his first time entering a Level 5 area and unexpectedly, he had already come across such a powerful opponent.\u201cKill it! Blast it with magic!\u201d Nie Yan answered back. It was far more dangerous to try and run instead of fighting it. They would definitely die while trying to escape. In addition, there was also the possibility of aggroing other spiders while on the run. As for escaping with a Return Scroll, it required twenty seconds to activate and would cancel upon being hit, which meant that it was out of the question as well. Under these circumstances, they were better off fighting it.Would the two of them even be able to kill a Level 5 Leader-class monster? Tang Yao was skeptical.\u201cMake sure you get far away from it, at least twenty meters. Then find a narrow tunnel and bunker down inside. Don\u2019t run too far in, though, otherwise you might aggro some more spiders!\u201d Nie Yan warned. Tang Yao was still a novice and entrusting him with such a dangerous task would be difficult.In this situation, Nie Yan was perfectly safe and could escape at any time. As for Tang Yao, however, Nie Yan couldn\u2019t guarantee his survival if he were to fight.Thus, they could only resign themselves to fate.\u300cScritch! Scritch!\u300dThe Rock Spider furiously cried out as it charged towards Tang Yao.\u201cOh... for f*cks sake!\u201d Tang Yao hurriedly sped up his pace. While running, he followed Nie Yan\u2019s advice and fired an Arcane Fireball at it.\u300cBang!\u300dThe fireball exploded when it crashed into the spider\u2019s body and dealt eighteen damage, causing a damage value to float above its head.Its defense was absurd! Fire magic was supposed to deal bonus damage to Rock Spiders, but even so, the damage was still just too low!However, this was to be expected. It was a Leader-class monster after all, so the damage was still alright. There\u2019s my chance! Nie Yan\u2019s eyes lit up as he struck the back of the Rock Spider with a Smothering Strike.The spider trembled and stopped in place.It\u2019s only going to be stunned three seconds!Normally, Smothering Strike would daze an enemy for six seconds, but this Rock Spider was a Leader-class monster! It had a certain resistance to crowd control effects. Thus, Nie Yan\u2019s control skills were only half as effective against it. Regardless, these three seconds were still more than enough!\u201cHit it! Don\u2019t just stand there and watch!\u201d Nie Yan shouted.Upon hearing Nie Yan, Tang Yao immediately cast Arcane Blaze.\u300cBoom!\u300dThe fiery blaze exploded when it hit the spider\u2019s body.When the spider woke from its dazed state, Nie Yan took the initiative and struck out with Assassinate. After using his dagger to stab into its fleshy abdomen, he followed through with Lacerate and slashed outward.His attack opened up a gaping hole on the spider\u2019s underside where a thick green liquid began oozing out.Even though Nie Yan had begun attacking, the spider was still aggroed onto Tang Yao. After coming out of its dazed state, it continued its pursuit.Seeing this, Tang Yao rapidly retreated into a narrow passage.\u300cBam!\u300dThe spider\u2019s immense body rammed itself into the opening of the passage, but couldn\u2019t make it in. The surrounding walls trembled from this, causing several rocks to break from the ceiling and come crashing down to the ground.\u300cScritch! Scritch!\u300dThe spider cried out furiously as it tried to squeeze its massive body into the passage.\u201cCome and see how this elder will take care of you!\u201d After realizing the spider couldn\u2019t enter, Tang Yao suddenly became much more courageous. He brandished his staff and fired off an Arcane Missile, then followed up with an Arcane Fireball. \u201cDammit! Arcane Missile is only dealing half as much damage as an Arcane Fireball.\u201dThe cooldown for Arcane Missile was very short because it was a regular spell. The casting time was quite short as well, requiring only a single second. Meanwhile, Arcane Fireball had a ten-second cooldown and required three seconds to cast. So it was impossible for him to continuously cast Arcane Fireball.As Tang Yao fired off spells, the Rock Spider continued to unceasingly ram itself into the entrance of the passageway, causing the walls on both sides to shake. Soon cracks began emerging in the walls, and the ceiling of the passageway gradually began to show signs of a possible collapse.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27 - MeteorPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 27 \u2013 MeteorNot only was Tang Yao the first one to attack the Leader class Rock Spider, but he was also the one putting out the most damage. It was because of this that the spider\u2019s aggro had been firmly placed on him. Meanwhile, the spider had completely ignored Nie Yan who was attacking it with a combination of skills, leaving the latter behind as it continued pursuing Tang Yao. Nie Yan took advantage of the current situation and, while the spider was still distracted by Tang Yao, fished out the vial of poison within his knapsack and used it to coat his dagger.Five seconds later, he finished applying the poison. He approached the spider from the rear and stabbed his dagger into its abdomen while using Vital Strike.\u221210% Defense\u221252The Rock Spider became poisoned and a status debuff was applied.Additionally, Nie Yan\u2019s Vital Strike was a critical hit and dealt quite a bit of damage!\u300cScritch! Scritch!\u300dThe spider shrieked out in pain. It switched its focus to Nie Yan and pounced towards him.The spider\u2019s sudden change in targets caught Nie Yan off guard, forcing him to hastily fall back.\u221278Despite his attempts to flee, however, the Rock Spider\u2019s attack still managed to connect\u2014draining the larger half of his health. Seeing his health bar quickly deplete, Nie Yan didn\u2019t dare to be careless. He immediately fished out a Basic Health Potion and downed it, then rolled away and began retreating.The spider followed in pursuit.With the spider\u2019s attention elsewhere, Tang Yao was free to fire off a salvo of spells. He sent off Arcane Missile, Arcane Blaze and Arcane Fireball in quick succession.\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92\u201cI\u2019m going to be out of mana soon...\u201d Tang Yao glanced at his health and mana bars and found that he had roughly a quarter of his mana remaining. His mana expenditure was too ferocious, there was simply no chance his natural regeneration could keep up.\u201cDo you have any Mana Potions?\u201d Nie Yan asked.\u201cI have a Basic Mana Potion.\u201d\u201cThen hurry up and drink it. We\u2019ll deal with it later,\u201d Nie Yan instructed. When he turned back to face the Rock Spider, he found that it had already neared his position. In response, he brandished his dagger and struck out with Concussive Blow, forcing the charging spider to abruptly halt its movements. Nie Yan took advantage of this and put some more space between himself and the spider.Even though the spider had been struck by Concussive Blow, it still managed to land an attack during the exchange. Nie Yan glanced at his health bar and found that roughly an eighth remained. Seeing this, he hurriedly used a Combat Bandage on himself.+20... +20... +20...During all this, Tang Yao had fished out a bottle filled with a blue liquid from his knapsack and drank it. Drinking the potion actually gave him a slight heartache; not because of the potion itself, but because that single bottle of blue liquid was worth ten coppers. To him, it was a life-saving treasure, one that he wouldn\u2019t use even in dire circumstances.Tang Yao\u2019s mana was instantly restored to ninety percent. With his mana now replenished, he unleashed several spells in succession. Each and every one of them exploded on contact, dealing a high amount of damage.Before two seconds had even passed, the Rock Spider woke from its dazed state. Upon waking, it immediately abandoned its attempt to pursue Nie Yan and instead rushed towards Tang Yao.Its aggro had shifted once again.\u201cKeep at it! It\u2019s almost dead!\u201d Nie Yan shouted. Once his health was fully restored from the Combat Bandages, he rushed to the spider\u2019s side once again.The damage he and Tang Yao were dealing was by no means low. Even though their opponent was a Level 5 Leader-class monster, it was still unable to withstand this kind of assault. By now, it only had a little over ten percent of its health remaining.\u300cScritch! Scritch!\u300dThe spider cried out manically as its entire body suddenly turned a shade of crimson red.\u201cNot good! This son of a b*tch became enraged. Keep your distance and be careful of its attacks,\u201d Nie Yan nervously shouted.Even though Tang Yao still didn\u2019t understand what was going on, he followed Nie Yan\u2019s instructions regardless and began hastily retreating while continuing to cast spells.During his retreat, a spike jutted out from the ground below and pierced towards him.Fortunately, Tang Yao was still moving when this rock spike emerged, and as such, it only managed to barely graze him. However, this slight scratch still dealt thirty-two damage to his health.If this rock spike had hit Tang Yao directly, Nie Yan estimated that he would\u2019ve lost at least two-thirds of his health.The attack nearly frightened Tang Yao to death, but the fact that he survived made him rejoice inside.\u201cKeep running and don\u2019t stop. Oh, and make sure to avoid stepping on any areas where you see the ground trembling or cracking!\u201d Nie Yan shouted. If Tang Yao paused for even a moment, then he would meet his end.Sure enough, as soon as Nie Yan finished talking, more rock spikes began jutting out from the ground. Tang Yao listened to Nie Yan\u2019s advice and paid close attention to the earth beneath his feet, occasionally dodging from side to side. Even so, aside from the first rock spike, not a single one managed to hit him.Tang Yao couldn\u2019t help but wonder how Nie Yan discovered this method for dodging the rock spikes. Could it be that he had slain a Leader-class Rock Spider in the past?In the end, he put this thought in the back of his mind and concentrated solely on evading the rock spikes erupting beneath his feet. He would occasionally see an opportunity to attack with a spell or two, but he never had the time to act.The spider seemed to become even more enraged as it watched attack after attack miss. It began to unceasingly ram itself into the tunnel walls in anger. Suddenly...\u300cCrash!!\u300dThe walls finally crumbled and collapsed. The spider climbed over the pile of rubble and rushed inside the tunnel, pouncing towards Tang Yao.\u201cRun quickly!\u201d Nie Yan shouted.\u201cI can\u2019t, there\u2019s another Rock Spider behind me! If I run any further I\u2019ll end up aggroing it!\u201d Tang Yao nervously called out as he looked back at the spider\u2019s immense body which was fast approaching.Nie Yan looked at the spider\u2019s heath bar. Five percent... it only had a sliver of life left!\u201cIt\u2019s fine! Keep running!\u201d Nie Yan shouted as he checked his skill bar. By now, several of his skills had come off cooldown.He chased after the spider and arrived near its rear.Assassinate! Lacerate!\u22122, \u22123It still has two percent remaining!Vital Strike!Nie Yan lunged forward and pierced his dagger into the spider\u2019s abdomen.\u300cScritch! Scritch!\u300dThe spider let out a miserable shriek as it fell to the ground with a heavy crash. The impact made the entire cave tremble and shake.\u201cWe finally killed it.\u201d Nie Yan finally relaxed as he breathed a sigh of relief. He walked over to the Rock Spider\u2019s corpse and picked up the loot.\u201cHey, over here! I\u2019ve still got one chasing me!!\u201d Tang Yao ran over to Nie Yan with a smaller Rock Spider in tow him. When he was evading the Leader class Rock Spider just a moment ago, he was unable to avoid alerting one of the spiders in the area. Thankfully it was only a common monster.Tang Yao ran behind Nie Yan and let the latter hold back the spider while he cast spells from the back.The two made short work of the spider, and it soon collapsed on the floor.\u201cMy God... I\u2019m going to die of exhaustion.\u201d Tang panted as he propped himself up against a nearby wall and began to slowly recover his health and mana. How they ever managed to kill this Leader-class Rock Spider, which was two levels above them, was beyond him. Nonetheless, it was most likely his greatest achievement since starting the game, \u201cYou know... I think I\u2019ve just realised how awesome I actually am.\u201dNie Yan took out the two items that the Leader-class Rock Spider had dropped: a single skill book and a silver white key.Skill Book: MeteorDescription: Beckon forth meteors to smite your enemies.Requirements: One syllable, three gestures, and one Talisman.Properties: (Beginner) Summon five meteors. Each meteor deals five bonus damage; ten points of burn damage in a five-by-five meter area.Cooldown: 120 secondsRestrictions: Elementalist, Arcane Mage; can only be learned by the Righteous Faction that protects the light.This was an uncommon Arcane Mage skill book and an extremely rare one at that. At the Beginner level, it could summon blazing fireballs that would rain down from the sky like meteors. Each fireball could strike five targets within a designated area simultaneously. At later levels, it would become a powerful area-wide spell.\u201cEven something like this can drop...? You lucky son of a b*tch.\u201d Nie Yan was almost speechless. The Meteor skill was exceedingly rare, as it could only be found in Level 1 to 30 areas where Rum Spiders, Rock Spiders, and Flame Spiders spawned. Moreover, it would only drop from Leader-class or higher versions of said monsters. What\u2019s worse was that the drop rate for this skill wasn\u2019t more than one in ten thousand. With the current level of the majority of the player base, this skill would be priceless in the marketplace. They really did meet with unexpected success today. As for the rare drop, it was most likely due to killing a Leader-class monster that was two levels higher than them.\u201cWhat did it drop?\u201d Tang Yao asked in surprise.\u201cLooks like your luck isn\u2019t half-bad today. It dropped a Meteor skill book. At the Beginner level, it serves as an unparalleled area of effect skill, dealing high damage in a small area. At the later levels, it becomes a pretty decent mobbing skill.\u201d Nie Yan felt a slight hint of envy as he summarized the skill to Tang Yao. An Arcane Mage acquiring Meteor during the first two weeks of the game... This truly was too much of a blessing.\u201cReally?\u201d Tang Yao suddenly stood up in surprise. \u201cLet me see!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not bad. You can use it. But compared to Templar magic, Giant magic, or Dragon magic, it\u2019s still somewhat lacking.\u201d Nie Yan threw the Meteor skill book over to Tang Yao and then looked at the other item that had dropped.Silver Key: Used to open Level 0\u201320 treasure chests that are Silver or lower.Uses: 3/3\u201cWhat\u2019s Templar magic and Dragon magic?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll find out in the future. For now just take this Meteor skill book; I\u2019ll be taking the key,\u201d Nie Yan replied. He and Tang Yao would both be getting the items most useful for themselves. Nevertheless, the key was still better in Nie Yan\u2019s hands, because only he would be able to get the most value out of it. Not to mention that, with this key, he could now finally open that locked silver treasure chest.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I won\u2019t be polite!\u201d Tang Yao went ahead and learned Meteor. Afterwards, when he read the skill\u2019s description, he felt extremely satisfied. He had been thoroughly depressed due to being pursued by the Radiant Sacred Flame guild all day. Who would\u2019ve guessed that Nie Yan\u2019s arrival would\u2019ve completely reversed his dire situation, turning all of his sorrows into joy in the process.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28 - Silk Spinner RingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 28 \u2013 Silk Spinner RingNie Yan walked over to the silver treasure chest and began unlocking it with the Silver Key.\u300c System: Opening treasure chest... Estimated Completion: 20%... 50%... \u300d\u300cClick!\u300dThe chest was unlocked.He glanced at the key which now had its durability reduced from three to two. Not bad... I can still use this two more times. Nie Yan threw the key into his knapsack and then started to feel around the inside of the chest. Eventually, he grasped an item; it was small, round, and felt smooth inside his hand. It\u2019s a ring! Nie Yan\u2019s surprise echoed in his thoughts as he fished out the item from the chest.The band had an ashy gray colour and he found it difficult to discern what material it was crafted from. Upon the setting attached to one side of the band sat an opaque white jewel adorned at the very center. Engraved on this opaque white jewel was the image of a spider. Despite its small size, the engraving was vivid and lifelike. It made it appear as though a jade white spider truly did exist within this jewel.Silk Spinner RingProperties: Unidentified\u201cIt\u2019s a Silk Spinner Ring!\u201d Nie Yan gasped in surprise.The Silk Spinner Ring was a Bronze-grade accessory that could only be found in areas where spider type monsters spawned. Moreover, it was a ring that retained its usefulness all the way up to Level 60. This was due to the ring\u2019s unique properties; it could shoot out a tough resilient thread of spider silk that adhered to most surfaces and could extend up to ten feet in length. In essence, it was the perfect treasure for scaling or jumping over obstacles such as rooftops, walls, ledges, or trees.\u201cWhat\u2019s a Silk Spinner Ring?\u201d Tang Yao asked in bewilderment.Nie Yan faintly smiled and replied, \u201cJust look at the craftsmanship. It should be at least a Silver-grade accessory.\u201dAlthough the properties of this ring were yet to be appraised, he was able to discern the grade of equipment like this just by glancing at the name.\u201cOh... so it was a Silver-grade accessory? No wonder you were so excited!\u201d Tang Yao replied as he came to a sudden realization.From Nie Yan\u2019s perspective, this Silk Spinner Ring was much more valuable than the Meteor skill book. This was because this ring would make him significantly more versatile, therefore he would have plenty more options to consider when working towards a specific goal. In his heart, he couldn\u2019t help but think: Now if only I can get a hold of that jewel from the Treant King, then everything will be perfect.\u201cA friend of mine invited me to run the Treant Forest with her tomorrow and there\u2019s still a few open spots. Do you want to join?\u201d\u201cSure, but... would they even agree to have me?\u201d Tang Yao asked in a somewhat anxious tone. He and his friends had wanted to form a team and run a dungeon in the past; however, not a single team wanted them or agreed to let them join.\u201cNo worries, you have me with you after all. Besides, your magic damage is fifty now. Such a high damage Arcane Mage... even if they wanted to find one they wouldn\u2019t be able to. Have some confidence in yourself. You\u2019re my brother after all!\u201d Nie Yan smiled and patted Tang Yao on the shoulder.\u201cUnderstood! If you have any more advice to give, then please let me know now. Whatever you tell me, I\u2019ll practice it. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anything I can\u2019t learn!\u201d Listening to these words, Tang Yao was in high spirits and felt touched by Nie Yan\u2019s words.\u201cWell, I\u2019ve already told you all that you need to know in regards to improving your skills. The most crucial aspect now is whether you\u2019ve practiced enough or not. As long as you practice, improve your reaction time, and put in the effort to avoid making any large mistakes, you\u2019ll have nothing to worry about. Try finding people to duel with early in the day to improve your skills. When you get to Level 5, I\u2019ll find some people and we\u2019ll form a team to run Secret Cavern. There I\u2019ll help you grab the Arcane Mage\u2019s Exile Disciple set. I\u2019ll have you so satisfied, you\u2019ll explode from happiness,\u201d Nie Yan said. With him here, it would be difficult for Tang Yao not to become an expert\u2014even if he didn\u2019t want to.\u201cReally? Then it won\u2019t do if I don\u2019t make an effort!\u201d Tang Yao was now full of motivation. In the past, he felt it didn\u2019t matter how much he practiced his skills because in the end, he would never catch up to the people who were considered elites. However now, after listening to Nie Yan\u2019s words, he felt a bright future lay ahead of him.Afterward, Nie Yan gave Yao Yao a call through voice chat.\u300c What do you want? \u300dYao Yao asked in an annoyed tone. In truth, she was no longer angry at Nie Yan. When she answered the call, however, she pretended to still be angry with him.\u300c Do you still have any extra spaces for Treant Forest tomorrow? \u300dNie Yan smiled helplessly.\u300c Two more open spaces. \u300d\u300c I have a friend who I want to bring along. Are you guys willing to take him? \u300d\u300c What level is your friend, hmm? He\u2019s not joining just to leech experience, is he...? Cause if he is, I\u2019ll have to ask my Senior Sister first. Also, what class does this friend of yours play? \u300dYao Yao answered in an abrasive tone.\u300c Arcane Mage. \u300d\u300c Oh...? What\u2019s his magic damage? \u300d\u300c Over fifty.

Her magic damage as a Holy Mage was only at thirty-seven\u2014a number which was considered to be quite high among others at the same level. She never expected that Nie Yan\u2019s friend would possess more magic damage than her, and by such a large margin at that.\u300c Hold on, I\u2019ll go ask my Senior Sister. She\u2019ll most likely agree to it. \u300dFor an Arcane Mage to possess such high magic damage, they definitely must\u2019ve cleared many dungeons in the past. These people were top experts. Even if their team found one and begged them to join, they still might not necessarily agree to join. And now, one of these experts had been delivered right to their doorstep. Her senior sister would have absolutely no reason to refuse. Normally it would be quite the opposite, with Tang Yao being the one doing the refusing or accepting.\u300c Alright, go and ask. I\u2019ll be waiting for your reply. \u300dA few moments later, she sent a reply.\u300c I\u2019ve asked Big Sister Yu Lan. She agreed to let your friend join, so bring him with you when you come tomorrow morning. \u300d\u300c Mhm... alright. \u300dNie Yan nodded his head and hung up the call.\u300cDoot! Doot!\u300d\u201cHello? Hello?\u201d Yao Yao still wanted to ask Nie Yan why his friend would even want to join them. From their perspective, this kind of expert wasn\u2019t easy to find, and they definitely weren\u2019t someone who would casually join up with a team like theirs. However, Nie Yan had already hung up on her. The only noise she heard from the call now was the busy signal that signified that the call had ended, which ended up infuriating her to no end as she madly stamped her feet on the ground. \u201cHanging up on me so quickly... Now that you\u2019ve got an expert by your side, you suddenly think you\u2019re too good for me, is that how it is? Hmph! How infuriating!\u201d\u201cSo, how\u2019d it go? Are they willing to let me join?\u201d Tang Yao asked in an anxious tone as he fiddled with his hands.Up until now, Tang Yao had always been someone who would join Pick-Up Groups. Occasionally he would join a group and run some common instances with them. However, he had never formed a regular party or team. The teams that were able to run Level 3 or higher instances also tended to be ones with a significant influence among the player base. Not to mention, these teams usually had fixed members. In almost all cases, there was simply no chance for an ordinary player to join. This was because if a team were to accept a weak player, that player would only hold the team back. This was why teams had harsh requirements and were particularly picky when recruiting new members. However, as long as a player met their requirements and joined their ranks, then they would easily become a part of the team. Such recruits would be called upon to join the ranks whenever the team was lacking in members.Hence why Tang Yao waited with heated expectation when Nie Yan had hung up the call.As a person who had also been unable to enter an elite team in the past, Nie Yan understood his feelings well. Tang Yao\u2019s eagerness and anticipation made Nie Yan reminisce about when he had first entered a team in the past; his feelings had been about the same back then as well.\u201cThey agreed. All you need to do is tag along with me tomorrow and you\u2019ll be fine. Your stats alone would make any team eager to have you, so relax. After all, playing an Arcane Mage requires a significant amount of skill.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d Tang Yao excitedly exclaimed. Tomorrow was going to be his first time running a high-level instance like the Treant Forest. This was an opportunity he had been yearning for even in his dreams. \u201cAre there any requirements to this instance?\u201d\u201cFor this instance, there are no specific requirements for Arcane Mages. Just make sure not to draw any aggro and you\u2019ll be fine. By the way, Treants have a fairly low resistance against fire magic, so who knows? Maybe you\u2019ll have done the most damage by the end of tomorrow!\u201d Nie Yan said while smiling. Meanwhile, Tang Yao was taking this matter seriously. When he recalled his first time running an instance, he didn\u2019t fare any better...\u201cDid you bring any Talismans with you?\"\u201cI\u2019ve got five.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s have a look at Meteor then. Cast the spell for me before we leave here in a bit.\u201d\u201cWhere am I going to cast it?\u201d The surrounding area only had one or two Rock Spiders at most. Using the skill here would be too much of a waste.\u201cI\u2019ll gather them up, so just get ready!\u201d Nie Yan replied as he ran off deeper into the cave.\u201cOkay!\u201d Tang Yao fished out a Talisman from his bag. He was filled with anticipation and was quite eager to find out just how powerful his new spell was.Nie Yan continued running deeper into the cave. Whenever he encountered a Rock Spider, he would attack it once and, instead of tangling with it any further, continue on his way. After these spiders were attacked, they would chase after him. The number of spiders chasing him steadily increased until they began slowing down due to the crowding.Nie Yan was quite nimble as he moved back and forth through the cave. The mass of twenty plus Rock Spiders following behind him as they cried out made him resemble a train.Tang Yao was busy tidying up his knapsack when he heard the sound of activity coming from deeper within the cave. When he walked over to take a look, he discovered a deluge of twenty plus spiders surging through the passage. They appeared as though they were going to swallow up everything in their path.\u201cOh... my... God...! How did you manage to aggro so many of them!?\u201d Tang Yao cried out in alarm as he turned around and began running for dear life.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 - Book of OrderPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 29 \u2013 Book of Order\u300c Stop dawdling! Hurry up and cast Meteor already! \u300dNie Yan pestered through voice chat.\u300c Meteor takes ten seconds to cast! By the time I finish casting, it\u2019ll already be too late! \u300dTang Yao anxiously replied. He estimated he would be overrun by spiders before he could even finish casting the spell.\u300c I don\u2019t care, just start casting! C\u2019mon, hurry up! \u300dTang Yao clenched his teeth and unravelled the Talisman. After brandishing his staff, he began casting Meteor. Soon, large amounts of fire essence from the surrounding area began converging at his location.As the fire essence gathered, the sheer heat from the scorching blaze caused the temperature in the surrounding air to rise.Tang Yao watched as Nie Yan led the twenty plus Rock Spiders through the passageway and into the cave intersection. As spiders surged into the intersection like a massive wave, Nie Yan ran into to the narrow passage where Tang Yao had retreated. The passage was so narrow that only a single spider managed to squeeze itself through, but in doing so, it blocked off access to the passage for the rest of the spiders behind itself.\u201cConcussive Blow!\u201d Nie Yan turned around and struck the leading spider in the head, causing it to enter a dazed state and stop the movements of the spiders behind itself.Eight seconds... seven seconds... six seconds... five seconds...As time slowly ticked by, the fire essence which was steadily gathering around Tang Yao became increasingly intense.For the most part, the spells that required a set of syllables to cast were also the ones that had a relatively large area of effect. From Nie Yan\u2019s knowledge and experience, Meteor was the only area of effect spell that Elementalists and Arcane Mages could learn at Level 0, and it was quite efficient at killing many monsters. However, even if you were to gather up a thousand Elementalists and Arcane Mages, you still might not necessarily find one that possessed Meteor.After three seconds passed, the spider woke from its dazed state and immediately pounced towards Nie Yan. In reaction, Nie Yan raised his dagger and began skirmishing with the Rock Spider. He kept the spider firmly in place and prevented any of its attacks from reaching Tang Yao, so as to avoid interrupting the spell.Ten seconds\u2014whether this moment was long or short depended on one\u2019s perspective. The truth of the matter, however, was that the moment would simply be over once you counted from one to ten.While in a trance-like state, Tang Yao raised his staff and chanted lines of strange syllables that even he didn\u2019t know the meaning of. When he finished casting, an enormous fireball fell from above\u300cBoom!\u300dA deafening explosion echoed out as the fireball crashed into the group of spiders. The fireball resembled a heavenly maiden upon impact\u2014scattering fiery blossoms in every direction. These blazing flowers didn\u2019t immediately extinguish upon landing on the ground. Instead, they continued to burn, dealing a fixed amount of damage every second to the spiders that were caught in the explosion.\u300cScritch! Scritch!\u300dThe twenty plus spiders caught in the explosion were in a state of upheaval as they cried out in agony. No matter what kind of state they were in, however, they were still unable to attack Nie Yan and Tang Yao.So, he had already calculated everything. No wonder he dared to aggro so many monsters at once.Nie Yan and Tang Yao were only able to kill monsters like this by taking advantage of the unique topography of this intersection. Attempting to use this tactic and unleash a fireball upon a large group of enemies would\u2019ve been suicidal if they were out in an open field. Normally the destruction caused by Meteor would be extremely limited in narrow spaces such as this. As it turned out, however, the intersection within the cave was quite suitable for casting the spell.Tang Yao couldn\u2019t help but admire Nie Yan even more. For him to be able to think of a tactic like this...A second later, another fireball rained down from above and exploded after hitting the ground.The brilliant flames expanded into the surroundings upon impact.Three more enormous fireballs subsequently rained from the sky. Of the spiders that had been hit by Meteor, six were directly crushed, sixteen burned to the death from continuous area of effect burn damage, and the remaining were all dying or near death. The destructive capabilities of Meteor had been clearly displayed before their very eyes.Tang Yao gazed blankly at the pile of Rock Spider corpses that laid before him. He had singlehandedly caused all this destruction, a realization which hard for him to conceive!\u201cNie Yan... did I really do all this?\u201d Tang Yao asked foolishly. Only after looking at the enormous amount of experience, did he finally come to accept it. Just a moment ago, he really was the caster of that formidable Meteor spell.\u201cWhat\u2019ve you got that blank look for? Come on, let\u2019s take care of the remaining spiders,\u201d Nie Yan smiled and said.\u201cI\u2019m out of mana.\u201d Tang Yao gazed at his mana bar that was almost completely bereft of any colour. He still had enough to cast a few Arcane Missiles, but he wouldn\u2019t be able to cast anything like Flame Explosion.After hearing Tang Yao\u2019s words, Nie Yan recalled something; Meteor was a spell that voraciously consumed mana. That fact that Tang Yao was able to cast it was already quite impressive. Not to mention, he even had a little bit of mana left over to cast other spells!Besides the mana consumption, Meteor also required Talismans which weren\u2019t cheap either. Therefore, if he was to continue casting this spell while grinding monsters, then Tang Yao would find his funds being quickly eaten away.Nie Yan pounced towards one of the remaining Rock Spiders and used Vital Strike to kill it. Following this, he and Tang Yao quickly began quickly cleaning up the remaining spiders.\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92Soon, every single of one of those twenty plus spiders had met their end and collapsed on the floor. Nie Yan walked over to the corpses and gathered up the loot which amounted to a total of three coppers. In the end, not a single piece of equipment had dropped. Nie Yan glanced at his experience bar; it had risen by another three percent after killing so many Rock Spiders.\u201cWe\u2019ve cleared out all the monsters in this area. Let\u2019s head deeper in,\u201d Nie Yan suggested. Mob grinding in such a manner could only be experienced every once in a while, as the monsters wouldn\u2019t respawn fast enough to make it a viable tactic.\u201cWhat!? Why are we going even further in?\u201d Tang Yao asked in a surprised manner.\u201cThere\u2019s something I must do deeper in the cave. Besides, the scenery inside this cave is quite mystical,\u201d Nie Yan replied as he smiled mysteriously. Upon arriving inside this cave, Nie Yan had vaguely remembered something unique about it.There was a spring at the very end of the Rock Spider Cave. Not only was the water in this spring quite deep, but it also contained many strong currents which weaved and intersected with one another underneath the surface. As for why these currents existed, it was because the spring connected to an underground lake. After passing through the lake, you would find yourself arriving at a secluded ravine where all kinds of exotic medicinal herbs grew in large abundance. However, there was something even more valuable inside this ravine. Something which countless players could only yearn for in their dreams; a torn page from the Book of Order.In the game\u2019s lore, the Book of Order and Book of Chaos were both divine objects which had been handed down since the Era of Shared Governance (873\u20131235). Even after five or six hundred years had passed, the legend of these two books continued to spread. Their emergence was a mystery, as well as the origins of their author.Order and Chaos represented the laws of the world.Each of the two books contained six volumes, thirty-six chapters total. These books represented two distinct and opposing powers which were scattered across the world.Legend has it that if one were to gather every page and complete the Book of Order, they would be able to revive the God of Order and gain immense power. Moreover, the owner of the Book of Order would become the Supreme Pontiff of the Righteous Faction and control all the Holy Shrines in the continent. On the opposite side of the spectrum, if one were to complete the Book of Chaos, they would gain immense destructive power and become the Ruler of Darkness, arch-nemesis of the owner of the Book of Order.The Book of Order and the Book of Chaos were both legendary existences.When the first six-chapter volume emerged, a cinematic played showing the long history of the Viridian Empire and Satreen Empire.The six chapters from the first volume of the Book of Order were as follows: the Chapter of Justice, the Chapter of Virtue, the Chapter of Courage, the Chapter of Wisdom, the Chapter of Harmony, and the Chapter of Freedom.These six chapters fell in the hands of six people, each of whom were experts that possessed a seat as one of the top hundred members in the Righteous faction. The owners of the Chapter of Justice, the Chapter of Courage, and the Chapter of Wisdom were respectively the first seat, the third seat, and the sixth seat. As such, the correlation between the two caused these chapters from the Book of Order to be viewed as divine existences by the public.It was correct that each of these chapters from the Book of Order possessed a powerful strength, but the caveat was that they could not be stored in a player\u2019s personal storage. Thus, the player would be forced to carry them on person. When the owner of a chapter was killed by another player, the chapter would always drop, unless the player possessed all six chapters. Due to this, the fighting and killing instigated by the Book of Order was almost never-ending.The Chapter of Justice, Chapter of Courage, and Chapter of Wisdom eventually fell into the hands of the leaders of three super guilds. The owners of the remaining chapters also gained formidable power, but they had to always keep a low profile whenever they set out. They would also try to avoid using their chapter\u2019s powers in the presence of other players. Even so, Nie Yan had still witnessed the powerful might of these chapters from the Book of Order in videos before.The holder of the Chapter of Justice was the president of Angel Corp, a Demon Hunter from the Elf race\u2014Angyi Tianshi. He once confronted and defeated over one hundred hostile enemies by summoning sixteen Righteous Knights. One person had defeated over a hundred players. This event later became a legend.The holder of the Chapter of Wisdom was Holy Judgement\u2019s guild leader, a Holy Mage\u2014Emperor Killer. He had withstood the invasion of the Undead, during which he used the Forbidden Magic Resplendent Brilliance and eliminated three hundred liches, thus creating another legend.The holder of the Chapter of Courage was the guild leader of the Holy Empire Guild, a Berserker\u2014Sleepy Fox. During a guild war, he rushed deep into the enemy ranks all by himself, killing an enemy every few steps and personally beheading over two hundred of them. He had slaughtered everything before him.Nie Yan couldn\u2019t help but burn with excitement when he thought of this.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30 - Search for the Chapter of CouragePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 30 \u2013 Search for the Chapter of CourageThe Book of Order truly was an item of immense temptation. And now, in his new life, Nie Yan had the chance to gather all six chapters of the first volume. There was only one problem, he didn\u2019t know if he could.Nie Yan knew the whereabouts of the six chapters in the first volume quite clearly. As for the other thirty chapters that were scattered across the world, he roughly knew most of their locations! The one he was currently searching for was the third chapter of the Book of Order \u2014 the Chapter of Courage.\u201cWhat are we going to do when we get further in?\u201d\u201cJust follow me to the end of the cave. After that you can head back and continue training. The place I\u2019m planning to go to is somewhere you\u2019re not capable of reaching,\u201d Nie Yan replied. His destination would be somewhat difficult to reach even for a Thief like himself. Thus, there was no need to consider an Arcane Mage like Tang Yao.\u201cIs it dangerous?\u201d Tang Yao curiously asked.\u201cYes, very.\u201d Nie Yan nodded and replied.\u201cIf it\u2019s that dangerous, then why do you want to go there?\u201d Tang Yao asked while deep in confusion.\u201cThere\u2019s a certain item there I want to retrieve.\u201d Nie Yan laughed as he responded. The game had just recently come out, and players like Tang Yao wouldn\u2019t know just how alluring a single chapter from the Book of Order was.\u201cI see.\u201d Tang Yao slowly nodded his head. He still didn\u2019t understand why Nie Yan wanted to go despite being aware of the danger. However, it seemed Nie Yan already had a plan, so he didn\u2019t inquire any further.After finishing their conversation, the two headed deeper into the cave. The passages were extremely narrow, which massively reduced Meteor\u2019s effectiveness. As a result, the two had to resort to using ordinary methods to clear the way as they slowly advanced.Rock Spiders fell one after another. Under Nie Yan\u2019s guidance, Tang Yao felt his skills improve significantly.\u201cYou\u2019re making rapid progress. Keep practicing like this and you\u2019ll find yourself becoming an expert in no time. Oh yeah, since we\u2019ll be heading to a dungeon tomorrow, let me give you a rundown on a few of the basics. The key aspects are aggro management and positioning. The dungeon we\u2019re running tomorrow is going to be a bit difficult, so it\u2019s best that you take caution, especially since we\u2019re dealing with the Treant King,\u201d Nie Yan said while facing Tang Yao. He went on and passed down all his knowledge regarding Arcane Mages and dungeoneering to Tang Yao. From time to time, he would also explain a few of the key parts of Treant Forest.Tang Yao keenly listened to every word he said. Before meeting Nie Yan, he could\u2019ve been considered an average player. Neither his skills nor his equipment would\u2019ve been considered anything special. In the end, he could only continue lagging behind others in the lower levels. But right now he was wearing the Fire Chaser Set, which meant that his equipment was among the very best. Not only did this great success make him feel self-conscious, but it also put an immense pressure on him. In order to live up to his own expectations, Tang Yao began to work as hard as an actual expert would. In truth, Tang Yao\u2019s aptitude was pretty decent. Though it couldn\u2019t be considered at the apex, he would still be considered quite skilled. After receiving Nie Yan\u2019s pointers, however, he completely transformed. Even if he wasn\u2019t regarded as an expert, in respect to his skills, it was evident that he knew how to improve.\u201cWhat else do I have to take note of?\u201d\u201cThe most important stats for an Arcane Mage are Intelligence, Awareness, and Focus. Among these three, Intelligence is the primary stat and undoubtedly the most important. Now this leaves the remaining two, Awareness and Focus, which are auxiliary stats. Awareness improves your survivability when confronting enemies that are able to stealth, whereas Focus makes it harder for your spells to be interrupted. Hence these two stats are extremely important as well. You can\u2019t improve auxiliary stats by leveling up, thus you must rely on passive skills to improve them. So if you want to keep up with others, make sure to possess the relevant passive skills. By the way, if you see any suitable skill books in the future and want to buy them but lack the money, let me know. I\u2019ll help you pay for them,\u201d Nie Yan said.\u201cMoney isn\u2019t something I\u2019m lacking, so you don\u2019t have to do that. I\u2019ll just need to hang around the auction house some more in the future, that\u2019s all,\u201d Tang Yao said as he shook his head. He took all of Nie Yan\u2019s advice to heart.As the pair neared the end of the cave, the faint sound of running water could be heard.\u201cWell, now that we\u2019ve reached our destination you should head back. There are three Leader-class Rock Spiders up ahead, and I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t be able to make it past them,\u201d Nie Yan suggested. In his past life, he had seen a video online about how the Chapter of Courage was found. From this video, he had completely memorized the path to the chapter.\u201cI see... Well, you be careful then.\u201dNie Yan nodded his head. \u201cI\u2019ll call you before heading over to the dungeon tomorrow, so go train and level for now.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be leaving then.\u201d Tang Yao took out the Return Scroll, unravelled it and read it out loud. After twenty seconds, he became a streak of white light and teleported away.Nie Yan watched as Tang Yao was spirited away, then headed further into the cave.Originally, he had planned to wait until his level was higher before retrieving any chapters from the Book of Order. At his current level, retrieving the Chapter of Courage would be quite troublesome. Since he was already here, however, he decided that he might as well try it out. After all, if he was successful in obtaining the Chapter of Courage, then it would certainly make it much easier for him to level in the future.Nie Yan travelled deeper into the cave, where the secret area was located, and hid among the shadows.After walking for three minutes, he found himself in an open space. Off in the distance, he could see three giant Leader-class Rock Spiders patrolling the area. Even further back, beyond the Rock Spiders, he could see an area entirely composed of water\u2014roughly around two hundred square meters. The water circulated from a narrow channel which eventually led underground. This was the source of running water that he had heard from before.\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92Three Leader-class Rock Spiders blocked his path to the pond. They frequently moved about in the open space, only stopping in place to scratch their heads with their legs every once in awhile. Nie Yan carefully observed them. He estimated that roughly ten meters lied between him and the water\u2019s edge.For non-Thief classes, it was absolutely impossible to pass through this area without alerting the Leader-class Rock Spiders. Other classes would have to resort to killing them if they wanted to make it through the area.I guess there\u2019s no choice but to go in regardless!Nie Yan understood the risky nature of such a tactic, but he had overcome situations that were several times more dangerous than this one before.The most alluring characteristic of the Thief class was the sheer excitement it provided. Thieves did what no other classes dared to do, and in doing so, they experienced the feeling of dancing between life and death.Perhaps his own nature was one that welcomed risks and dangers.What mattered most was that Nie Yan enjoyed this feeling. He strived to achieve the impossible and overcome dangerous situations one after another because it was proof of his own ability.After some quick calculations, he estimated that two and a half meters was the closest he could get to one of the spiders without alerting it.As long as I\u2019m not within two and a half meters, I should be safe.Nie Yan entered stealth and began making his way forward.The three Leader-class Rock Spiders continued to move about the area, their large eyes constantly reflecting images of their surroundings. Within the area, not a single thing was overlooked under their vigilant watch.In his past life, a player once calculated the statistics of the various types of monsters. They discovered that among animal type monsters, spider types were ranked number seven when it came to Awareness. To put this into perspective, the number of animal type monsters in the game amounted to approximately six thousand. This alone proved just how high the Awareness of spiders was.Nie Yan carefully maintained the distance between himself and the Leader-class Rock Spiders. He gradually moved towards the water\u2019s edge while simultaneously controlling his breathing.Using clock position, the locations of all three spiders were respectively three and a half meters at nine o\u2019clock, five meters at twelve o\u2019clock, and six meters at eleven o\u2019 clock. His body resembled a gecko as he stuck himself to the cave wall and gradually shuffled his way forward.Every action was made with meticulous care. From the loose stones near the cave wall to the scattered gravel underneath his feet, they were all variables that he had to take into consideration.Caution was a ship that sailed for ten thousand years; Nie Yan felt he could never be too careful. The six years of experience he had gained in his past life granted him a deep understanding of this kind of reasoning. It was something he truly learned only after experiencing countless bitter lessons. In total, he had died over three hundred times outside of instances. Needless to say, the times he died while in them was even more. An expert who had never experienced death was never an expert to begin with.If one wanted to be looked upon as an expert, then it was absolutely essential to take risks and gain experience in PvP. It was because experience could only be gained in such dangerous situations that death was unavoidable. In the eyes of an expert, players who had never experienced death or only grinded monsters to reach Level 100 were still considered beginners.It was truly only because of his numerous experiences with death that Nie Yan became a somewhat well-known Great Thief and was only a hair\u2019s breadth away from obtaining the title of Shadow Dancer. The difference between Shadow Dancer and an average Thief was only a single title. At that time, however, only six other people within the entire Atlanta continent held the title of Shadow Dancer.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31 - Assassins DecreePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 31 \u2013 Assassin\u2019s DecreeAs Nie Yan moved forward, he gradually came within roughly three meters of one of the nearby Leader-class Rock Spiders. The spider suddenly trembled and turned its gaze towards Nie Yan\u2019s location.Fortunately, Nie Yan was completely immersed within the darkness of the cave. The shadows here provided him an excellent environment to conceal himself.Even so, the Rock Spider\u2019s gaze was so intense that it actually appeared to be capable of piercing through the darkness.The tenseness in his heart reached an extreme as he held his breath and stuck as close to the cave wall as possible.The spider trembled as it saw a distinct silhouette gradually come into view.\u300cScritch! Scritch!\u300dIt let out a cry and rushed towards its newfound opponent.Dammit, I\u2019ve been discovered. Nie Yan\u2019s heart sank as he activated a Speed Scroll and sped towards the spring as fast he could.In that same moment, the two other spiders also took action and attempted to flank Nie Yan.They blocked off his path while the previous spider attempted to ram him.Nie Yan bent his knees to their limit and then leapt out of the way of the attacking spider.His character\u2019s weight load was currently light, thus he had a maximum jumping distance of three meters and jump height of half a meter. In a flash, he leapt out of the Rock Spider\u2019s attack range.\u300cBoom!\u300dThe spider\u2019s immense body rammed into the wall. The impact fractured the wall, sending rubble falling to the ground.Meanwhile, the other two spiders simultaneously pounced at him from the front and left flank.However, Nie Yan\u2019s senses were sharp. He quickly went into a roll after landing, avoiding the oncoming charge of both spiders.\u300cBang!\u300dThe two spiders collided with each other, and as a result, they flipped over and sprawled out on their backs.The three Leader-class Rock Spiders had nearly blocked off all paths of escape with their massive bodies alone.Nie Yan successfully escaped their encirclement by passing through a small gap between the three spiders, after which he continued running forward. Upon reaching the five-meter mark, he increased his pace even more as he bolted towards the spring.One of the spiders managed to recover faster than the others and pounced towards Nie Yan. Seeing this, Nie Yan leaped into the air, and with a splash, dove head first into the spring.The three Rock Spiders hovered around when they arrived at the water\u2019s edge. However, in the end, none of them dared to enter.It was yet another narrow escape. As Nie Yan dove deeper, he activated the Water Aversion Pearl\u2019s ability.There was even less light underwater, which meant that his view distance was extremely limited. Meanwhile, the underlying currents posed a huge challenge as they pushed him every which way, making it more difficult to swim. At times they would even forcefully push or pull him away from his destination.Nie Yan stabilized himself and carefully observed his surroundings. After reclaiming his bearings, he swam forth once more.There shouldn\u2019t be any monsters here , Nie Yan thought to himself. He swam for another ten minutes before seeing gentle pillars of light shine down through the waters above him.I remember this place! There\u2019s a treasure chest near this location! Nie Yan thought as he swam through the dark waters at the bottom of the lake. In his previous life, every inch of this area had been thoroughly searched by others. Even the hidden nooks and crannies weren\u2019t exempt from this search. It was because of this that Nie Yan knew there was someone who had found a treasure chest in this location before.Aside from the water far above, the surrounding region was pitch black. Therefore, Nie Yan could only rely on his sense of touch as he navigated through the area. He felt a slight pain as his feet hit the ground and he came into contact with several protruding rocks; he had reached the lakebed.Ignoring the pain, Nie Yan continued to fumble his way through the rocks on the lakebed.He reached his hands into the soft, delicate sand below and searched around. His hands soon came into contact with an object seemingly hidden underneath the lakebed. Immediately he began digging his way through layers upon layers of sand until a faint golden shimmer entered his eyes, causing his pupils to sharply contract.I struck it rich! It\u2019s a gold treasure chest!The golden treasure chest emitted a brilliant luster within the darkness of the lakebed. Every inch of its surface was covered with delicate carvings. Although these engravings seemed somewhat worn and aged, it didn\u2019t affect the overall aesthetic of the chest. On the contrary, it gave off the appeal of an artifact with historical value.What was even more remarkable was a certain symbol on the chest that caught Nie Yan\u2019s eye: a delicate engraving of a wolf. The engraving was roughly the size of an adult\u2019s fist. When Nie Yan looked closely, he could even make out each individual hair on this extremely detailed engraving.Both equipment and objects within the Atlanta continent were filled with a strong historical value from all eras. Each and every sculpture, painting, handiwork, and weapon carried the historical characteristics of their respective era. Therefore, no matter what the decade, century, or era, there would always be relevant research on that certain time period.With ten full years of experience with this game, Nie Yan had a meticulous understanding of the history behind these engravings, paintings, and so on.This particular engraving was the symbol of an infamous pirate group that roamed the Sinse Sea Region during the Era of Shared Governance (873\u20131235). They were an endless headache for the Republic until their legislative body finally decided to act. The Republic dispatched their most elite naval forces to exterminate the pirates. The allied navy formed by the coalition of humans, giants, elves, and beastmen forced these pirates to flee for their lives. In the end, these pirates were eventually defeated. However, rumors have it that, before the war between the pirates and the Republic broke out, the pirates hid their treasures and scattered them in various locations throughout the continent. In response, the Republic decreed that ownership of the lost treasures would go to whomever finds them. As a result, countless treasure hunting groups were formed in hopes of finding lost treasure. Indeed, many of these lost treasures ended up being found during this time period. However, many remained hidden, lost within the Atlanta continent for centuries.This golden chest was one such relic left behind from the Era of Shared Governance. The historical value of this ancient chest alone would make historians lose their minds.Nie Yan only knew that someone from his past life had found a chest in this area. He thought that the treasure chest would just be an ordinary one. Never did he expect that it was actually a golden treasure chest left behind from the Era of Shared Governance. Whoever found the chest must\u2019ve meticulously and deliberately hid the chest\u2019s rank because of this.Nie Yan opened the chest and reached inside. After feeling around for a bit, he grabbed onto what appeared to be a dagger. When he felt the dagger in his palm, Nie Yan couldn\u2019t suppress the fierce excitement within his heart.He hastily took the dagger out from the chest and gazed at its properties.Assassin\u2019s Decree (Dagger)Properties: UnidentifiedAs the dagger needed to be appraised, he couldn\u2019t tell what its properties were yet. However, despite having been worn down after sitting here for centuries, the cold glint reflecting off the blade\u2019s edge showed that it was still sharp. This dagger had a unique design, vastly different from a common dagger. The handle was embroidered with various multicoloured jewels, which made it look extremely beautiful. There was also a blood groove on the flat side of the blade, which made the dagger look streamlined and sleek. The tip was not unlike a barb with the blade curving inwards. This dagger looked like it could easily cut through flesh.Assassin\u2019s Decree? Nie Yan tried to recall of any information related to this dagger, but nothing surfaced. He had never come across this dagger before, and thus he was unable to guess its properties. Despite this, he was still able to discern from the design of the dagger alone that it was at least a Gold-grade piece of equipment.\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92Nie Yan understood just how significant owning a Gold-grade piece of equipment this early in the game\u2019s existence would be. He would have many opportunities in the future which wouldn\u2019t have presented themselves had he not obtained this dagger.Knowing this, Nie Yan was filled with endless excitement as he stored the dagger into his knapsack. Even if he failed to retrieve the Chapter of Courage this time, this dagger alone would\u2019ve made the trip worthwhile.According to how the game was designed, it was highly unlikely that two chests of the same quality would appear in the same area. The chances for such a situation to occur were slim to none. Thus Nie Yan didn\u2019t bother searching the lakebed anymore and instead began swimming up towards the surface where rays of light gently shone down into the water. As he neared the surface, the light became increasingly intense.\u300cSplash!\u300dWhen Nie Yan\u2019s head broke through the surface of the water, he found himself in an extremely small spring.He surveyed his surroundings and discovered a beautiful valley. The clear spring he found himself in flowed down the valley gulch and into a flourishing forest below. An abundance of grass grew freely in the rest of the valley, resembling a thick green carpet which covered everything aside from the forest itself. Various kinds of wild flowers were littered across the area. These flowers gave off a delicate fragrance which wafted throughout the region.Surrounding the valley were steep green mountains that acted as a natural barrier from the outside world. These mountains were home to a diverse range of vegetation, which meant this area was most likely sealed off from the rest of the world.A short while later, Nie Yan was now walking through the deeper parts of the forest below. The dense foliage blocked off most of the sunlight from above, however, some light still managed to pass through the tender green leaves and shine down upon the earth below. It was because of this that the forest was not dark, but instead tinted a shade of viridian which gave off a mysterious yet warming sensation.As Nie Yan walked through the forest, the surroundings made it seem as though he had entered a completely different world.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32 - The Third Chapter of the Book of OrderPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 32 \u2013 The Third Chapter of the Book of OrderNie Yan swept his gaze over every nook and cranny in the forest. When he spotted a certain shrub at the base of the mountain, he was incapable of looking away.This particular shrub reached up to his knees and had many branches. Its appearance was not unlike a jade sculpture\u2014pure, translucent, and radiating with vibrant colours. Tucked away within the shrub\u2019s leaves was a single scarlet red fruit that resembled a cherry\u2014tender and glistening.This is a Red Urnberry! I didn\u2019t think a plant like this could appear in such a low-level area!Nie Yan\u2019s memories were still quite clear; during the latter years of his past life, the selling price of a single Red Urnberry reached up to several hundred gold. Moreover, each and every Red Urnberry held different properties.Nie Yan walked towards the steep mountain wall and carefully harvested the Red Urnberry from the shrub. Fortunately he had already learned the gatherer skill, otherwise he would\u2019ve had no chance inretrieving this fruit\u2014an event which would\u2019ve been truly unfortunate.Red Urnberry (Rare Fruit)Description: The player who eats this fruit will gain +2 Willpower permanently.Restrictions: Each player may only consume this fruit up to three times. Further consumption will not yield any additional benefits.Considering the Red Urnberry\u2019s inherent rarity, and the fact that it could also permanently increase a player\u2019s stats, it was no wonder this fruit could sell for upwards of several hundred gold.Nie Yan contemplated for a while before finally deciding to eat the fruit. After all, this was a rare opportunity. Besides, this fruit was meant to be eaten; only a fool would actually sell it.An additional two Willpower was quite decent. Willpower was a stat that reduced the effectiveness of debuffs (such as sickness, poison, curses, resistance debuffs, etc) on a player. It didn\u2019t matter if it was PvP or PvE, Willpower was a stat that would always be useful. After all, the number of mobs and classes that could cast debuffs on a player were more than just a few.Nie Yan put the fruit into his mouth. It melted almost instantaneously and became a warm current that flowed directly to his stomach.He took a quick glance at his Willpower stat. It had gone from zero to two.Having two willpower at such a low level was rather useful. After eating the Red Urnberry, he didn\u2019t dally any further and headed deeper into the forest.After walking down a path hidden in the grass for roughly five minutes, he finally entered the deeper part of the forest. Here the trees were more lush and exuberant, but the lighting was much dimmer due to the light having to penetrate through much more vegetation to reach the ground below.The forest floor was covered in a layer of dead leaves that stretched as far as the eye could see.Within the dark forest, a single bright ray of light could be seen shining through the dense foliage. The absence of any other lights only served to make it all the more prominent and clear.At the centre of the ray of light was a meter high cylindrical column that seemed to have been carved out of stone. Placed atop this column was a thick book which seemed to have been eroded by the elements. Its worn state seemed to be a testament to the book\u2019s long and distant history.This book was, according to Nie Yan\u2019s memories, aptly named \u201cAnnal of the Era of Shared Governance.\u201d Its contents detailed all of the historical events that occurred during the Era of Shared Governance.It was within this thick history book that the Chapter of Courage was hidden.Nie Yan walked up to the column and extended his right hand towards the cover of the book. The moment his fingers made contact, the book opened up by itself and began rapidly flipping through its pages.Suddenly, a narration began playing.\u300c Within this secret forest, you\u2019ve discovered a thick book that chronicles the history of an ancient era. Upon placing your hand on the book, you suddenly feel a mysterious force enter your body. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d you inquire to yourself while brimming with curiosity. Shortly after, the pages in the book begin turning by themselves, revealing mysterious silver leafed characters. From these characters, you learn this \u201cAnnals of the Era of Shared Governance\u201d was written by a combination of three languages: the Kasate Giant language, Ancient Universal language, and Dragon language. You record this newfound knowledge in your head. \u300d\u300c System: You\u2019ve learned the language of the Kasate Giants. \u300d\u300c System: You\u2019ve learned the language of the Dragons. \u300d\u300c System: You\u2019ve learned the ancient language of the common people. \u300d\u300c System: You\u2019ve received the \u201cAnnals of the Era of Shared Governance.\u201d \u300d\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92The Atlanta continent contained over three hundred languages. Before, Nie Yan had only learned the current common language, which was the language of the Humans. Yet suddenly, he had learned three new languages. He quickly glanced over his information page and realised it had a new section titled \u201cAnnals of the Era of Shared Governance.\u201d Within this section was a description of every notable event that had occurred during that era.This sort of data was invaluable. In the future, it could help Nie Yan accomplish many tasks and identify various items.This \u201cAnnals of the Era of Shared Governance\u201d will save me a lot of time and trouble when completing quests related to that era, Nie Yan couldn\u2019t help but think to himself.\u300c \u201cEh?\u201d Looking closely at the book, you are surprised to discover a separate piece of paper tucked away between the pages of the book. Numerous rows of mysterious, dark golden characters dotted this page. As you look over the lines of gibberish, you slowly realise that these characters belong to the language of the Kasate Giants and spell out \u201cChapter of Courage\u201d. \u300dI\u2019ve finally found it! Nie Yan pleasantly thought to himself as he glanced at the chapter\u2019s properties.Description: The third chapter of the first volume of the Book of Order. A fragment of a Legendary item. Whoever shall possess this chapter will receive the inheritance of the God of Light. Your mission is to spread the glory of light!Properties: Receive 2 stat points and 1 mastery point every 5 levels. Focus +15, Willpower +15, Resilience +16, Jump +15, Reflex+15, Speed +16Transcendent Insight: Gain the ability to see through your enemies. Allows you to view enemy character information. Also grants the ability to appraise items.Passive: Awareness +10Adjudicator of God: Grants immunity to all magic, gain 500 health, and summon an advanced life-saving shield that absorbs sixty percent of all incoming damage for five minutes. (This skill cannot be used in instances)Cooldown: 10 days (1/10)Restrictions: Can only be bound by a member of the Righteous Guardian of Order.Note: Item effects are applied immediately upon entering the player\u2019s inventory.Nie Yan stared out blankly as his hands began to tremble lightly. He had seen the properties of this chapter on the internet in his past life before, but now, as he held the chapter in his hands, he experienced an entirely different feeling. He reckoned this Adjudicator of God was the very skill the guild leader of Holy Empire, Sleepy Fox, had used to slaughter his way through two hundred players in his past life. Not to mention the skill even made the player immune to every single type of magic for five minutes. What kind of overpowered ability was this? What was even more disgusting was the fact that Sleepy Fox already had top-tier equipment in the first place. If you added immunity to all magic, five hundred health, and a shield that absorbed sixty percent of all damage, then his strength would undoubtedly become excessive beyond reason. To meet him on the battlefield would simply be meeting a god of death. However, the cooldown period of the skill was still quite high. After all, it would take ten days before the skill could be activated again, which was why most players wouldn\u2019t rashly use the skill unless they were at a critical juncture.And that was just the Adjudicator of God skill. The chapter\u2019s other properties were quite powerful as well, especially the one that allowed a player to gain an additional two stat points and one mastery point every five levels. Nie Yan was practically bursting with happiness. From his knowledge, the only classes that had a bonus that came close to this were Shamans, Paladins, and Demon Swordsman who also gained two additional stat points every five levels. Due to their characteristics, however, they had to evenly distribute their stats between strength and intellect, because they would practically be useless if they only focused on a single stat. However, a Thief was different. On top of the five stat points and one mastery point he would gain every five levels from Level 0 to 30, he would now also gain two additional stat points and one mastery point every five levels thanks to the Chapter of Courage. Nie Yan understood what this meant.If you included the other stat bonuses and properties of the chapter, Nie Yan had effectively leapt up to become one of the top experts, if not the strongest player in the game. This chapter from the Book of Order clearly lived up to its name as a legendary existence.After placing the Chapter of Courage into his knapsack, Nie Yan glanced at his stat page and found that several of his stats had risen by a large amount.When Adjudicator of God came off cooldown, he would become unequalled in terms of combat strength.However, from now on, he would have to take extra caution whenever he was killing mobs or fighting players. This was because the Chapter of Courage would immediately drop from his body if he died. The only way to prevent this was to find the other five chapters and complete the first volume of the Book of Order.Despite having finally retrieved the Chapter of Courage, Nie Yan didn\u2019t relax or loosen his guard at all. After storing the chapter in his knapsack, he took out a Return Scroll and began channelling it.\u300c System: Unable to activate Return Scroll from this location. \u300d62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33 - The Boss Emerges: Guardian of OrderPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 33 \u2013 The Boss Emerges: Guardian of OrderAlarms rang out in Nie Yan\u2019s mind. He understood well what this announcement signified: he was currently in a sealed region. How could the game allow him to get the Chapter of Courage so easily?It was reasonable to assume that the chapter would have a guardian protecting it, which was a boss known as the Guardian of Order. However, up until now, why had it still not made an appearance?In the past, Nie Yan had merely skimmed through the video regarding the chapter. There was one thing, however, that remained deeply engraved in his mind: the imposing figure of the Guardian of Order.As Nie Yan thought about this, the ground beneath his feet began to violently tremble and crack. It was as though something below was attempting to force its way up. Nie Yan glanced at the path he took to get here, but found it had been obstructed by falling boulders.Shit... I have to make a run for it! He looked around but there wasn\u2019t even a single exit anywhere in sight. With no other options left, he began heading towards the mountain.Upon arrival, he found a slope that didn\u2019t seem too steep and began nimbly climbing his way up.Many trees grew atop the mountain slope, giving him plenty of handholds.While climbing, Nie Yan suddenly recalled something, Oh right, the Silk Spinner Ring! Up until now, he still hadn\u2019t found an opportunity to appraise the ring. However now, with Transcendent Insight, appraising it would be a cinch. He took the ring out from his knapsack and appraised it.Silk Spinner Ring (Bronze): Unique AccessoryRequirements: Level 0Properties: Release a thread of silk that can adhere to certain surfaces. The thread can extend up to five meters in length and has a tensile strength of two hundred pounds. (Cooldown: 20 seconds)Weight: 0.05 lbRestrictions: Can be equipped by all factions.After equipping the Silk Spinner Ring, he wanted to appraise Assassin\u2019s Decree as well. At that very moment, however, a powerful gust of heat was expelled from the valley below as the ground shattered into countless pieces. Like a volcanic eruption, countless boulders and rock fragments were sent flying into the air. Many of the trees in the valley had been uprooted and were strewn across the area, while others had spontaneously combusted\u2014a scene of utter and absolute destruction.At the very centre of the valley, a horrifying crater of lava emerged and swallowed up everything within its reach.A dormant giant, awoken from its slumber, pulled itself up from deep beneath the ground. It was the servant of God and possessed the power to bestow divine judgement.I don\u2019t have much time... The suddenness of it all prevented Nie Yan from appraising the dagger, as he had to divert his attention back to scaling the mountain. The burst of heat had caught him off guard and he nearly slipped and fell back down to the valley below.Standing atop one of the many trees growing horizontally on the mountainside, Nie Yan glanced upwards, looking for the next handhold. After spotting one about two meters away, he leapt high up into the air and grabbed onto a protruding rock, then clambered up. With this, he had made some more progress scaling the mountain.Meanwhile, back at the valley, a giant head emerged from the cracks in the earth, followed by immense arms, a torso, and legs.From head to toe, the giant was roughly sixty meters in height. Two wings covered in pitch black feathers sprouted from its back. In its hand was a thirty-meter-long crystal scepter. When it emerged from the earth, its entire body ignited with a blazing red aura, causing a whirlwind of scorching heat to rise and form at the centre of the valley.With Transcendent Insight, Nie Yan could see the giant\u2019s stats.Guardian of Order (Low-level Intelligence): Level 100Health: 200,000/200,000The giant spoke with a bellowing voice that stretched far into the valley. Though whatever he was saying sounded like gibberish, it was actually the language of the dragons. His words roughly translated to \u201cLight and darkness alternate in cycles. I am the protector of God\u2019s will and guard his Order. If there is a sinful person who desires to purloin the chapter from the Book of Order, then they shall receive divine judgement!\u201dLegends say that the Guardians were birthed from the merging of giant and dragon. Viewed as freaks of nature, they were banished into the deep wilderness where they eventually received God\u2019s baptism. Entrusted with a task from God, they protect the various chapters scattered across the world.The Guardian\u2019s gaze swept across its surroundings, finally coming to rest on a figure that had almost climbed to the mountain\u2019s peak. With a single beat of its massive wings, the giant\u2019s immense body rapidly rose up into the air.The giant bellowed, \u201cBlack Flame Tempest!\u201dAs if answering the giant\u2019s call, a scorching black cloud of flame emerged out of thin air and began rapidly congealing into a sphere. Afterwards, the ball of black flame shot towards Nie Yan. \u300cBOOM!\u300dThe Black Flame Tempest exploded on the mountainside, scattering pitch black fireballs in every direction and setting the entire area ablaze.Not far from Levin Hills, in a small forest town by the name of Link, the earth violently shook and trembled. Players who had gathered at the town were left frightened and anxious due to the sudden commotion.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on!?\u201d\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92\u201cLook over there, where the mountains are!\u201dThe entirety of the mountain\u2019s peak had been engulfed in a cloud of black flame. And within those black flames emerged the immense silhouette of a figure hovering in the air. It was as though an apostle of destruction had arrived from the gates of hell itself.Soon, a disaster warning was issued in Link.\u300c Warning: A dragon has emerged south of Link. We advise all nearby players to depart the area immediately! \u300dAfter a few brief moments, a flash of brilliant light was emitted from the transfer point in Link. A group of fully armed NPC soldiers wearing bright silver armour had arrived in town. On the chest of each of these soldiers was a medal engraved with the insignia of the Holy Crusaders. The soldiers rapidly assembled in the public square, their numbers reaching an excess of several hundred.Within the Viridian Empire, there existed two elite armies which were considered to be the empire\u2019s most powerful fighting forces. The first belonged to the Imperial Church and were known as the Holy Crusaders. This army was composed of over five hundred thousand troops and their Commander-in-chief was the Holy Mage, Jebiah the Great. They were tasked with the duty of protecting the entire empire. The second army was the Guardian Legion of the Temple of Light, known as the Temple Guards. They numbered less, at around fifty thousand strong. Unlike the Holy Crusaders, however, their sole duty was to safeguard the Temple of Light and uphold the religion of the entire empire.These several hundred soldiers who had arrived to guard the town belonged to the Holy Crusaders.\u201cNo wonder, it was a monster from the dragon race!\u201dThe players vigorously chatted amongst themselves while gazing at the Guardian of Order who was hovering in the sky.The dragon race: an existence that was both powerful and distant to mankind. During the Dark Era (\u22122678\u2013230), dragons had reigned supreme and established a mighty empire on the continent, which enslaved all other races. Eventually, their rule was toppled by the combined alliance of giants, humans, dwarves, elves, and beastmen. To prevent facing retaliation from the dragons in the future, the alliance enacted a mass genocide of all dragons throughout the continent. Thus, the former glory of the dragon race was no more; however, they didn\u2019t simply fade from existence. There were still many dragons scattered across the continent, hidden away in their secluded abodes.The Viridian Empire had classified the Guardian of Order as a member of the dragon race. Although they were technically wrong, at least in regards to exterior appearances, there were only minute differences between the two.With the appearance of the NPCs, the minds of players began working. A monster of the dragon race had emerged, along with a large number of NPC soldiers. In such a scenario, the two parties were most certainly going to clash, which left the players wondering what sort of profits they could fish out from this spectacle.Soon the information became widespread, and with it, guilds began appearing one after another through the transfer point at Link. The three most prominent guilds were Splendid Temple, Dark Massacre, and Holy Empire. Each of which had sent anywhere from a thousand to over several thousand players.The equipment the dragon might drop truly represented an irresistible enticement for these guilds.In just a short period of time, Link had suddenly become armed to the teeth. Even the ballistae in the guard towers were being loaded and prepped.A few moments earlier...Nie Yan lifted his head and gazed at the immense figure hovering in the sky. The pair of wings on its back were large enough to blot out the entire sun. When the Guardian displayed its might by casting Black Flame Tempest, clouds of black flame emerged and covered the sky, before congealing into a dense fireball. As if it were a meteor, the dense ball of black flame crashed towards Nie Yan, engulfing everything in its path.The large black fireball exploded upon colliding with the mountain, sending several smaller fireballs scattering across the surroundings. On impact, they smashed boulders to rubble, created deep craters everywhere, and charred the earth black.Even when faced with such a situation, Nie Yan still didn\u2019t panic. Instead, by relying on his experience, eyesight, and judgement, he remained cool-headed and found a safe place to hide after calculating the fireball\u2019s trajectory. Fortunately, the fireballs weren\u2019t concentrated in a single area, but the explosive power of each individual fireball was still quite a terrifying sight to behold.Shit... he\u2019s coming down. Nie Yan tilted his head and gazed upward. He saw the Guardian of Order\u2019s immense body descending towards his general location like a hawk swooping down to catch its prey. This creature, which looked like it had come from the deepest layers of hell, definitely wasn\u2019t something he was currently capable of contending with.Compared to the Guardian, Nie Yan was such a frail existence that even so much as a slight touch from the Guardian of Order could end his life.Nie Yan didn\u2019t spare a single second as he began rapidly descending down the mountain. He made it about half-way before stopping at a steep cliff. As he peered downwards, he noticed it was roughly an eighty- to ninety-meter drop.Taking a quick glance behind, he saw the Guardian fast approaching his location. Without a second thought, he made a leap of faith and jumped off the cliff.\u300cBOOM!\u300dThe Guardian of Order descended onto the cliff where Nie Yan had just been standing moments ago. The impact of his landing shattered the surrounding rocks and boulders.As Nie Yan fell from the mountain, his speed rapidly increased. He could feel the vegetation growing on the cliffside sweeping past his ear. Occasionally, one or two branches would briefly break his fall, only to immediately snap after bearing the full force of his impact.\u22127\u22129\u22125...Each collision caused damage values to appear above his head one after another.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With his left arm extended, he activated the ability from the Silk Spinner Ring. A web line shot out and adhered to the cliff face between the vegetation, slowly decelerating his descent. The line was tough and resilient and resembled a rubber band as it gradually stretched itself to the limit.The tension on the web line continuously increased.The force of Nie Yan\u2019s fall surpassed the silk line\u2019s tensile strength and the line gave out with a snap, taking many of the branches and rubble from the cliff face along with it.Despite snapping, the web line still managed to significantly slow down his falling speed.\u221256\u300cThud!\u300dNie Yan fell onto the ground. Fortunately, the fall damage wasn\u2019t too high and was within the limits of what his health could handle.In normal circumstances, if a player didn\u2019t have an item such as the Silk Spinner Ring to cushion the fall, they would most certainly die!Having climbed and fallen over the other side of the mountain, the distance from his current location to Link wasn\u2019t too far off. With safety being his number one priority, Nie Yan entered stealth and activated a Basic Haste Scroll. From a half-withered bush at the base of the mountain, he made a sprint towards Link. The large crowds in the town should offer a little protection.Having failed its attack, the Guardian of Order beat its wings and hovered in the air. Nie Yan had already escaped the valley by entering stealth and disappeared without a trace.After the fall, Nie Yan and the Guardian were more than one hundred meters apart. Even if the level disparity between them was high, it still couldn\u2019t make up for the distance. Hence, even if the Guardian had a clear view of Nie Yan, it would still be unable to see through his stealth.With regards to how stealth detection range was calculated, it depended on level disparity, the Awareness stat, and observation ability. With some rough estimations, Nie Yan was confident that as long as he stood at least one hundred meters from the Guardian, he would be safe from its detection. Even if it was a Level 100 Elite-class, its level, Awareness, and observational abilities couldn\u2019t make up for such a large gap in distance.Nie Yan turned his head to look back. At this point, the Guardian of Order still hadn\u2019t left the area. Rather, it was heading over in his direction to investigate.Without delay, Nie Yan held his breath and hid behind a large boulder.The Guardian beat its wings and flew over. As it hovered in the sky, it investigated the area below it for any signs of movement, but didn\u2019t manage to discover Nie Yan.\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92The hunter and the hunted: the Guardian of Order was like the eagle in the sky, while Nie Yan was like the prey on the ground.There was still roughly a kilometer between him and Link. Under the attentive gaze of the Guardian, there was no way for him to safely travel such a large distance.There\u2019s still another method. I can use the Return Scroll!It was possible to use the Return Scroll in this location; however, it would take a full twenty seconds to activate. Moreover, when channeling, the scroll would emit a bright light which would definitely attract the Guardian of Order\u2019s attention.With its flying speed, the Guardian wouldn\u2019t need more than ten seconds to fly over to Nie Yan and kill him after discovering his location.As the Guardian gradually descended from the air, the distance between it and Nie Yan became increasingly near.This\u2019ll be troublesome... Nie Yan anxiously thought. If the Guardian were to enter a range of less than a hundred meters, it was possible for his hiding location to be detected. With every step, danger was slowly approaching.Since I can\u2019t hide and avoid it, I might as well try fleeing for my life. Only... I\u2019m not sure if I can make the half mile run.Just as the Guardian prepared to descend onto the ground...\u300cWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u300dThree arrows swiftly came flying over, all shot from afar. Each arrow separately aimed for its head, throat, and heart. The Guardian avoided them by flying to the side, causing all three arrows to miss their target.In the distance, atop a large withered old tree, a tall NPC archer wearing silver plated armour drew his bow.\u300cWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u300dAnother three arrows were fired into the air.The Guardian of Order let out a hiss. Seemingly resentful of the provocation of these low-level beings, it pounced towards the NPC.Several soldiers approached the archer in the tree. \u201cCommander Nisode, the defensive perimeter has been built. We\u2019re awaiting further instructions,\u201d reported the several fully equipped soldiers.\u201cIt\u2019s approaching. Withdraw to Link! This foolish dragon will experience the divine judgement of the Holy Crusaders!\u201d Commander Nisode shot a glance at the Guardian of Order speeding towards them in the air. Afterwards, he returned the bow to his back, leapt from the tree, and gracefully landed on the ground.Under Commander Nicole\u2019s provocations, the Guardian of Order flew over Nie Yan\u2019s head and headed straight for Link.\u300c System: Level 1 Disaster Warning! Invasion of a dragon! \u300dThe Guardian bellowed in the dragon language, \u201cBlazing Meteor!\u201dThe Guardian brandished its scepter. An enormous meteor formed out of blazing flames fell from the sky and streaked towards Link.Flames were set ablaze in the sky. The meteor, fifty to sixty meters in size, would most likely engulf the surrounding twenty-five hundred square meters.\u201cActivate the basic defensive formation!\u201d Commander Nisode climbed up to the tallest tower in Link and issued the order to those below him.Afterwards, a blue barrier began forming and protected the entire town within it.\u300cBOOM!\u300dThe meteor exploded over the barrier while fire blossoms scattered in all directions. The barrier trembled violently due to the impact. Even all the players within the town could feel the barrier trembling as the remnant heat and fire elements assaulted their senses.\u201cATTACK!\u201d Commander Nisode issued out another order from the command tower. Immediately, every ballista within the town aimed at the Guardian of Order and fired.\u300cWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u300dCountless bolts flew through the air in a densely packed salvo.Simultaneously, several thousand Archer and Mage players also fired a volley of attacks.Meanwhile, the Guardian of Order unceasingly fired off its own magic attacks. Under its barrage of attacks, the barrier began showing signs of breaking as cracks appeared everywhere.\u300cBANG!\u300dA loud explosion echoed throughout the town as the barrier was shattered into pieces. With the barrier shattered, the Guardian rushed into the town and descended to the ground. With a single step, the Guardian crushed a nearby building, sending smashed tiles, bricks, and other building materials flying everywhere.The appearance of the Guardian wreaked havoc among the players in the town.\u201cHoly shit! It\u2019s a Level 100 Elite monster! Fighters, don\u2019t rush forward!\u201d\u201cMages! Where are the f*cking Mages!? All of you, fire your spells!\u201d\u201cShi\u2014f*ck, dammit!! All of our attacks are misses! The level gap is too high!\u201dPanic and confusion spread through the players and the town was in a state of chaos and upheaval. Over ten heavily armoured Holy Crusaders rushed forward to engage the Guardian. Surrounding the Guardian, the soldiers began their assault, but their countless attacks fell short and were the equivalent of raindrops as they landed on the guardian\u2019s body.The Guardian was glowing red as a flaming aura surged from its scales. It was a terrifying existence which brought about destruction. With every swing of its scepter, a Holy Crusader would be smashed and sent flying. Buildings were crushed or knocked down, and the ground was scorched and charred, leaving a path of ruin wherever it passed.\u201cBy the glory of the Holy Crusaders, my name is Commander Nisode and I will pass divine judgement upon this sinister dragon! Tyrant Impaling Arrow!\u201d With these three words spoken, Commander Nisode placed his hand on the bowstring. He grunted heavily as he pulled back until it reached its maximum draw weight.\u300cBOOM!\u300dHe released the bowstring. The arrow fiercely spiralled forward and carried a biting cold rotating energy along with it.\u300cBang!\u300dThe arrow briefly encountered some resistance when it met with the Guardian\u2019s scales only to immediately pierce into and bore its way through the Guardian\u2019s body.\u221287,829An unfeasibly high damage value had appeared above the Guardian\u2019s head.The acute damage made the Guardian of Order release an indignant roar containing its wrath and fury. It raised the immense scepter in its grasp high into the air. The surrounding fire elements along with the smoldering remnants of its previous spells began to gather around and took the shape of an immense rotating pillar of flame.The fighting in Link became increasingly intense. As for the origin of such a disaster, Nie Yan, he was inwardly rejoicing in his mind. Fortunately, the soldiers from Link led the Guardian of Order away; otherwise, I would have undoubtedly met my end.Nie Yan was lingering around the outskirts of the town. Under the numerous attacks of the town\u2019s soldiers, the Guardian of Order would soon be unable to resist any longer. He was curious what sort of equipment such a high level monster like the Guardian would drop. As he thought of this, Nie Yan\u2019s mind was full of anticipation. He drew slightly closer to the Guardian at roughly sixty meters away and hid under the cover of a ruined building.Since there was still a bit of time, Nie Yan took out Assassin\u2019s Decree from his knapsack and decided to appraise it with Transcendent Insight.Assassin\u2019s Decree (Gold): Secondary WeaponRequirements: Level 5Properties: Attack 26\u201329, Strength +16, Accuracy +12Attack Speed: 2.5Weight: 3 lbRestrictions: Can be equipped by all factions.It was a secondary weapon and was truly worthy of being Gold-tier\u2014Level 5 with an attack of nearly thirty. He would be able to equip it once he learned Dual Wielding and reached Level 5. His attack would then rise tremendously when he possessed such a powerful weapon. After glancing at its properties, Nie Yan put Assassin\u2019s Decree back into his knapsack.As for whether the Guardian of Order would drop any equipment, Nie Yan didn\u2019t have high hopes. After all, the Guardian of Order was merely a protector and its existence was simply to safeguard the chapters from the Book of Order. These types of beings frequently dropped no equipment. However, there were naturally always exceptions to these cases.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Therefore, the Guardian of Order only acted by instinct and its aggro system was the same as any other ordinary monster.Therefore, Commander Nisode\u2019s arrival had saved Nie Yan\u2019s life at the most critical juncture.There\u2019s actually quite a few people here... Nie Yan swept his gaze over the surrounding environment and noticed many other players eyeing the current battle like tigers watching their prey. The moment the Guardian of Order died, these hundred or so players would all simultaneously take action in an attempt to pilfer whatever equipment that dropped!There\u2019re so many people here. Even if the equipment does drop, I definitely won\u2019t be able to snatch it. I already got the Chapter of Courage... I should be satisfied with what I have, Nie Yan inwardly contemplated.He was an easily satisfied person. Thus he never held high hopes when situations occurred where it was certain he would not obtain anything.Nie Yan focused his gaze after peering past several obstacles and caught sight of a few acquaintances.Splendid Star: a twenty-something-year-old man with a squarish jawline. He was the guild leader of Splendid Temple. Even though he couldn\u2019t be regarded as handsome, he was still passable in terms of looks. His clean-shaven face gave off a bright and refreshing kind of look. In Nie Yan\u2019s past life, he had friendly interactions with Nie Yan. Having helped Nie Yan on several occasions, he had a reckless personality but valued loyalty and friendship. In turn, Nie Yan had also accompanied him and his friends during several guild expeditions.Swift Slash: a sloppy looking man and the thirty-six-year-old guild leader of Dark Massacre. According to rumours, he was part of the criminal underworld and had quite a few underlings under his command. His personality was nothing great and on would every so often butt heads with Splendid Star. As such, Nie Yan himself didn\u2019t have too great of an impression on this person.Sleepy Fox: a player who was roughly thirty years old. Nie Yan wasn\u2019t too familiar with him nor did they have any sort of relationship. However, as the guild leader of Holy Empire, he was a somewhat well-known name. It was rumoured his prestige within the guild was fairly high\u2014he was capable of leading Holy Empire into becoming one of the top ten largest guilds. This achievement alone was proof of his strength.He was also the holder of the Chapter of Courage in Nie Yan\u2019s previous life!Splendid Star and his group were lying in wait among the ruined buildings in the west. Swift Slash and his group were located in the southwest. Both sides were watching like tigers awaiting their prey, ready to act any moment. On the other hand, Sleepy Fox was located in the east. The corner of his mouth curved into a ridiculing smile as he gazed at the two sides ready to duke it out. He planned to swoop in when both sides were exhausted.As he watched such a scene unfold, Nie Yan couldn\u2019t help thinking... what if Sleepy Fox were to know he had taken the Chapter of Courage which was supposed to belong to him? What kind of reaction would Sleepy Fox have? Would he grab all his men and unrelentingly chase him down?\u201cSwift Slash, with our Splendid Temple members here, your Dark Massacre guild should just step off to the side. Don\u2019t be so unwilling to accept it. I was the first to reach Level 5 before you. I was also the first to clear the Treant Forest and Blackflame Forest before you. No matter in real life, or in the game, I\u2019ve always been ahead of you!\u201d Splendid Star bluntly proclaimed as he stared at Swift Slash in an unyielding manner.Swift Slash\u2019s face turned ashen. Splendid Star\u2019s words had infuriated him quite a bit. He sneered, \u201cSo what if your Splendid Temple guild cleared the Blackflame Forest? Your clear rate was only sixty-eight percent\u2014it\u2019s nothing to brag about. Your guild\u2019s Honour is only higher than ours by two hundred points. Given some time, we\u2019d easily catch up.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re two hundred points ahead of you right now, but who knows? Maybe by tomorrow, we\u2019ll be ahead by a thousand, then the day after, two thousand. Trying to overtake us? Try again in your next life!\u201dGuild reputation was a representation of a guild\u2019s strength; otherwise, why else would they care about such a tiny gap in Honour points?\u201cBastard! You\u2019re looking to die!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s so terrific about Splendid Star and his guild? Come on, let\u2019s kill them!\u201d A member of Dark Massacre passionately shouted from within the group.\u201cBrat! If you have the guts, then come up here!\u201dOver on Splendid Temple\u2019s side, their members were itching to go as well. However, neither side made a move and only continued cursing at each other. The main goal of their trip was still to secure the equipment the Guardian of Order might drop.This equipment was the target of all three guild leaders.Meanwhile, the Holy Crusaders vehemently resisted the Guardian of Order, not yielding by even a single inch. The archers at the rear continued to fire a rain of arrows with every single one concentrated solely on the Guardian\u2019s body.The Guardian of Order thundered furiously and cast its magic. The deep and archaic dragon language echoed above Link with spells one after another pouring down like a torrent of raindrops.\u201cThe Guardian of Order doesn\u2019t have much health left! Quick, snatch the equipment!\u201dNo one knew which person shouted those words, but immediately, a deluge of players pounced towards the Guardian of Order.After Commander Nisode let out an explosive shout, a single arrow shot out from his bow and pierced the Guardian of Order\u2019s shoulder, causing blood to gush out everywhere. The Guardian issued a mournful cry before transforming into white light and vanishing in the air. A single gold piece of armour fell from where it had been.\u201cIt\u2019s the equipment! Get it!\u201d Splendid Star coldly shouted.\u201cKill whoever manages to snatch the equipment!\u201d The guild leader of Holy Empire, Sleepy Fox, also ordered from the guild chat.Three to four hundred players pounced from all directions and charged towards the armour that had fallen from the Guardian of Order. Every guild within the game could be seen included in the crowd\u2014an especially chaotic scene to behold.He never expected the Guardian of Order would actually drop a piece of equipment. Moreover, it appeared the equipment dropped was Gold-grade as well. Seeing this, Nie Yan also charged into the fray. He was already here, so why not give it a try anyway?A Berserker from Holy Empire had taken the lead by activating Charge which increased his speed by a significant amount. Soon, it appeared as if he were about to snatch the equipment at any moment. However, ten spells immediately came flying over, bombarding his body simultaneously. After being hit by so many spells at once, his body transformed into a beam of white light and vanished.\u201cF*ck!\u201d Sleepy Fox, seeing the piece of equipment just within his grasp fly away once more, cursed loudly. \u201cKeep fighting!\u201dThe three major guilds still didn\u2019t approach the dropped equipment. Instead, they began fighting and fired barrages of spells at one another. Seven or so players approached the dropped equipment and were immediately met with an explosion of spells that turned them into ashes.Nie Yan was roughly twenty meters from the dropped equipment with a member from Dark Massacre, a Fighter, obstructing the path ahead. The Fighter noticed Nie Yan and came forward to intercept him.With his body lowered, Nie Yan evaded and weaved his body past the Fighter\u2019s attack.The Fighter\u2019s body shot into empty space. He stared out blankly before turning his head. By that time, Nie Yan had already run far away.\u201cCHARGE!\u201d As a Berserker, Sleepy Fox took the lead and rushed forward.Immediately, a dozen spells came bombarding towards him. As he was about to be hit, Sleepy Fox dodge rolled at the last moment. Of the dozen spells, only three managed to land on his body.The equipment belongs to me! Sleepy Fox felt ecstatic as he bent down to pick up the equipment on the ground.\u201cDon\u2019t be so quick to get happy!\u201d Swift Slash coldly shouted.\u201cImmobilize!\u201d Swift Slash brandished his staff, chanted several syllables, and cast Immobilize. Sleepy Fox\u2019s body immediately became rigid as he was rooted in place.\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92While Swift Slash was a Shadow Priest, Immobilize was still a rarely seen spell that could cause a player\u2019s body to become rigid. At Beginner level, it could root a player in place for three seconds.Dammit! Sleepy Fox cursed in his mind. He was unable to move any part of his body.At the same moment, Swift Slash and Splendid Star both simultaneously pounced towards the armour and drew increasingly near.Five meters, three meters...In terms of speed, Swift Slash would definitely be able to snatch the armour before Splendid Star.Nie Yan had entered stealth and followed Swift Slash and Splendid Star closely from behind. However, the two were still faster than him by a pace which meant he definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to snatch it away. Since he couldn\u2019t get the equipment himself, why not send it to a friend?Nie Yan swept his left leg out!Tripping was a basic movement in Conviction. In melee combat, a player could trip their opponent and cause them to stumble. The success rate depended on the person\u2019s Strength stat and the opponent\u2019s body weight.Fortunately, Nie Yan\u2019s left leg managed to stop right in front of Swift Slash\u2019s foot, causing him to immediately lose his balance and fall once his leg was hooked.\u300cThud!\u300dSwift Slash fell onto the ground while Splendid Star extended his right hand and grabbed the armour before stuffing it into his bag.Only then did they realize there had been a Thief following them closely from behind.After retrieving the equipment, Splendid Star gave Nie Yan a grateful glance and said, \u201cThank you.\u201d He discovered he didn\u2019t recognize this Thief\u2019s face at all. He wasn\u2019t a part of their guild and Splendid Star had never met him before. However regardless, this Thief had still helped him at this moment.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If Swift Slash hadn\u2019t abruptly rooted him in place, that Gold-grade armour would have belonged to him!Some felt elated and others felt upset, but no one could surpass the joy Splendid Star currently felt because he had become the biggest winner this time around. He glanced over and observed Nie Yan. Earlier, the timing of this Thief\u2019s trip\u2014albeit a basic movement\u2014was simply perfect. No matter the timing or position, he was not even a single iota off. The perfection of his timing and positioning definitely wasn\u2019t by coincidence; it was intentional!Moreover, Nie Yan was closer to him at that time. Reasonably enough, if Nie Yan had attempted to trip him instead, he\u2019d have no way to evade. However, Nie Yan still purposefully chose Swift Slash. If it weren\u2019t for this, the Gold-grade armour would have never fallen into his hands!\u201cAh... I didn\u2019t manage to get anything.\u201d Nie Yan shrugged his shoulders and spoke in an indifferent manner, then turned around to leave.\u201cYou want to leave after all that!? Don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to be let off that easily!\u201d Swift Slash coldly snorted. If it weren\u2019t for Nie Yan, the equipment would have definitely belonged to him!In the same moment he spoke, several dozen Dark Massacre members in the area coldly shouted and began converging around Nie Yan, blocking his exit in a semi-circle.\u201cWhat...? You people want to detain me here?\u201d Nie Yan\u2019s replied with an unperturbed smile. However, his mind was still deeply scheming. It would be somewhat difficult if he wanted to break out of Swift Slash\u2019s encirclement with his power alone. Moreover, if Swift Slash wanted to come to blows, Nie Yan felt he wasn\u2019t a good person to provoke either.\u201cHe\u2019s my friend. Swift Slash, if you want to cause him problems, first ask yourself if our Splendid Temple members will approve or not!\u201c Splendid Star interrupted, seemingly determined to oppose Swift Slash as he stood shoulder to shoulder with Nie Yan. While behind him, the Splendid Temple members\u2014after hearing their leader voice out his opinion\u2014stepped up as well.It was only because of him that Nie Yan ended up provoking Swift Slash. So naturally, he wouldn\u2019t stay himself from the matter at hand.\u201cSplendid Star, are you certain you want to contend against me!?\u201d Swift Slash coldly threatened.\u201cCorrect, our Splendid Temple isn\u2019t afraid of your Dark Massacre guild. Brothers, tell me if I\u2019m correct?\u201d Splendid Star turned back and asked his guild members.\u201cCORRECT!\u201d The people from Splendid Temple roared in unison.\u201cIf you Dark Massacre people have the guts, then come up and fight! This old man will happily accompany you!\u201d\u201cYou ball-less sons of bitches! Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re suddenly afraid!?\u201d\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92The people from Splendid Temple began shouting obscenities with both sides entering a shouting match afterwards. With swords drawn and bows bent, either side began forming their respective ranks. The atmosphere smelled of fresh gunpower. A fight was going to break out at any moment. Splendid Temple had over seven hundred players remaining while Dark Massacre had nearly a thousand. From the look of things, each side had taken heavy losses from the Guardian of Order. Thus, in terms of numbers, Splendid Temple was at a disadvantage.Nie Yan glanced at Splendid Star by his side. This guy was the exact same in Nie Yan\u2019s past life\u2014he valued loyalty quite a bit. It appeared Nie Yan didn\u2019t make a mistake in helping Splendid Star today. However, if they were going to face off against Dark Massacre, Nie Yan had to bear the brunt. It seemed the upcoming battle was going to be considerably dangerous and fierce. If he died, the loss in level and experience were of lesser importance. What was most important was the Chapter of Courage\u2014an item he absolutely didn\u2019t want being dropped!\u201cIt appears I have no business being here.\u201d Sleepy Fox laughed, bringing his companions off to the side. If a large spectacle were about to begin then why not have it play out a little quicker? Either way, the matter was unrelated to him, so he could not get involved with it. As for the Gold-grade armour, there was nothing he could do since he wasn\u2019t able to get his hands on it.Among the Holy Empire members, a certain Paladin wearing bright silver armour walked to the front and leaned over beside Sleepy Fox\u2019s ear. \u201cBoss, that Thief is the expert I mentioned before!\u201d the Paladin said as he pointed his finger towards Nie Yan. Astonishingly, he was the Paladin Nie Yan had crossed paths with before, Flying Stone.\u201cEh?\u201d Sleepy Fox exclaimed in surprise. He then observed Nie Yan from the distance. It appeared this Nie Yan was still quite young; however, his skills were fairly good. From his actions earlier, he resembled a leopard as he went to trip Swift Slash. \u201cHe\u2019s only Level 3... Don\u2019t tell me his team was so strong they were able to clear Fallen Shaman Camp at that level?\u201d\u201cBoss, what are we gonna do?\u201d Stone asked. After all, they were still somewhat acquainted with Nie Yan. Moreover, at this moment, he sincerely believed that they should help Nie Yan.\u201cLet me think it over.\u201d Sleepy Fox pondered for a long time. For Nie Yan, was it worth it to make an enemy out of Dark Massacre solely for his sake?After a brief moment, he had his answer.Since the beginning, Sleepy Fox had never attached importance to a small fry guild such as Dark Massacre.\u201cHey, Brother Nie Yan! In a few days, our Holy Empire guild is planning to run Agmota Muddy Wetlands. I wonder if you\u2019re interested in joining?\u201d Sleepy Fox loudly called out.Sleepy Fox\u2019s abrupt interruption immediately caught everyone\u2019s attention. Even Swift Slash and Splendid Star simultaneously cast their gaze over in Sleepy Fox\u2019s direction.Splendid Temple and Dark Massacre were currently in a deadlock. Thus, the intentions of the Holy Empire guild were especially important to take note of, because whoever Holy Empire decided to help would directly influence the outcome of the battle.How does Sleepy Fox recognise me? Nie Yan shot a glance at Sleepy Fox and saw Stone standing by his side. Ah... So, it was like this.\u201cThe Agmoto Muddy Wetlands, huh? Sure, I can think it over. However, if you want me to clear a dungeon with you, I have one condition. I get the first pick on any Thief equipment I have use for,\u201d Nie Yan replied.At this moment every player\u2014be they Dark Massacre, Splendid Temple, or even Holy Empire\u2014focused their gaze on Nie Yan. They discovered he was no more than an average player who hadn\u2019t even joined a guild yet. However, why would the guild leader of Holy Empire, Sleepy Fox, invite him on a dungeon run?Even more outrageous was the fact Nie Yan didn\u2019t immediately accept. He even made excessive demands. Getting first priority on all Thief equipment, who the hell does he think he is!?Holy Empire was a famous guild among the player base. With fifty-six thousand Honour points, it was an existence which far overshadowed the likes of Splendid Temple and Dark Massacre.In the eyes of players, guild prestige was the index for whether a guild was strong and powerful. Every cleared instance as well as completing quests for the first time guaranteed some Honour points. Naturally, the Honour points received increased with instance difficulty. Therefore, the higher the guild prestige, the more likely it was to find strong experts within the top rankings of the guild. Another benefit was the ability to attract elite players to the guild.At any rate, the guild leader of Holy Empire, Sleepy Fox, could be regarded as a celebrity.Moreover, this celebrity surprisingly invited an obscure no-name player like Nie Yan to run a dungeon with him. This was truly a strange and unforeseen turn of events.Many players looked at Nie Yan with differing expressions. However, what they all shared in common was the extreme jealousy and envy in their heart. After all, most players would be extremely honoured and elated to have been personally invited to a dungeon run by the guild leader of Holy Empire himself.A lone Tempest Thief moved closer to Sleepy Fox\u2019s side and berated, \u201cLeader, that guy\u2019s way too outrageous! The moment he opened his mouth he requested first-pick on all Thief drops. Who the hell does he think he is!?\u201d He then shot a cold glance at Nie Yan. If Nie Yan were to enter their team, wouldn\u2019t that mean all the Thief equipment would go to him? What would there be left remaining for himself then?\u201cLike I said before. Nie Yan is an expert! Trying to invite him definitely won\u2019t be easy,\u201d Stone instantly refuted back.After hearing Nie Yan\u2019s demands, Sleepy Fox laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s truly got quite an ego. Previously, I still didn\u2019t believe he was an expert. However, this time, around, I could be considered more or less convinced. Since he dared to be so arrogant with his requests, it must mean he has a little skill.\u201dStone nodded his head and took a glance at the Tempest Thief to his side.Since the guild leader voiced his opinion, that Thief could only turn his head off to the side dejectedly.\u201cBrother Nie Yan, if you\u2019re willing to agree, then naturally all Thief drops will go to you first,\u201d Sleepy Fox straightforwardly replied.Sleepy Fox unexpectedly agreed to Nie Yan\u2019s excessive demands? Everyone present stared with widened eyes. This was too unbelievable. The expression of all the surrounding players turned strange as they gazed at Nie Yan. Just who was this person if he was capable of making Sleepy Fox concede so much just in order to befriend him?62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37 - Joke Becomes a RealityPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 37 \u2013 Joke Becomes a RealitySince Sleepy Fox was capable of leading the Holy Empire to a position of reverence, it meant he had a little boldness in him. Nie Yan pondered for a brief moment. If he wanted to be fully equipped with top-tier gear, it wouldn\u2019t be possible unless he ran dungeons. The equipment that could be bought in stores and the auction house were mostly second-rate gear because most guilds were unlikely to sell the equipment if it was a rare drop. The only method for obtaining the best gear was by running dungeons with a team. Although Holy Empire\u2019s elite team wasn\u2019t as strong as the one in his previous life, they were still a decent alternative.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, send me a message when you\u2019re ready to run the dungeon,\u201d Nie Yan replied.Swift Slash was also listening to the conversation going on between Nie Yan and Sleepy Fox. At this moment, Dark Massacre had been put in an awkward situation. If he wanted to deal with Nie Yan, not only would he have to go up against Splendid Temple, he\u2019d have to face Holy Empire as well. How could his own forces possibly stand up against two entire guilds?\u201cSwift Slash, spare me some face. Let\u2019s forget about the matters that occurred today, alright? Brother Nie Yan is a friend of mine,\u201d Sleepy Fox said with a smile. His smiling expression contained a trace of danger. If Swift Slash wasn\u2019t willing to look past his grievances, Sleepy Fox\u2019s Holy Empire certainly wouldn\u2019t be as easy to deal with as Splendid Temple.\u201cSince Guild Leader Sleepy Fox has spoken, I\u2019ll let this matter pass.\u201d Swift Slash swept his gaze at Nie Yan and Splendid Star and coldly snorted. He then turned to face his party. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201dSwift Slash brought the rest of Dark Massacre with him and departed.After his departure, Sleepy Fox began walking over to Nie Yan\u2019s side.Seeing Sleepy Fox walking over, Splendid Star looked beside him and said, \u201cWow, I never thought you were friends with the guild leader of Holy Empire. As for today\u2019s matters, thank you.\u201dSplendid Star made conjectures but no definite conclusions regarding Nie Yan\u2019s identity. However, since Sleepy Fox was treating him so courteously, he must have some kind of background.\u201cWe just happened to meet by chance, nothing too close,\u201d Nie Yan replied with a faint smile.\u201cEh... Is that so?\u201d Splendid Star examined Nie Yan\u2019s facial expression and determined it was unlikely he was lying. However, if that were the truth, the manner in which Sleepy Fox treated Nie Yan really was worth thinking over.\u201cBrother Splendid Star, your harvests today were rather decent,\u201d Sleepy Fox interrupted. An amiable smile lay on his face and his tone was serene. He did not mention the conflict that had occurred moments ago, as if what they were fighting for was merely a single piece of equipment. This was expected of the leader of Holy Empire, Sleepy Fox did indeed have a fairly broad heart.\u201cAh... Brother Fox, please don\u2019t bring that up. If you want this Gold-tier armour, there\u2019s no harm in giving it to you as a gift,\u201d Splendid Star replied dejectedly.\u201cEh? Why is that? Don\u2019t tell me the equipment\u2019s properties are bad?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that... The properties aren\u2019t bad. You\u2019ll understand when you see it for yourself.\u201dAfterwards, Splendid Star shared the properties of the Gold-tier armour he had just recently obtained.Unyielding Armour of Courage (Gold)Requirements: Level 100Properties: Defense 585\u2013621, Thorns Aura +5, Strength Blessing +12, Counter +15Weight: 38 lb\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92Restrictions: Warrior; can be equipped by all factions.Sleepy Foxed sucked in a breath of air. \u201cIt is a Gold-tier armour! Ah, what a pity...\u201d Sleepy Fox sighed after exclaiming in admiration. This armour was strong but it was currently useless as it could only be equipped at Level 100. Who the hell knew how long that would take to reach!\u201cIndeed, it\u2019s a pity. Moreover, the properties on it are rather decent too. I went through such hardships to get this armour only to discover I have to wait until Level 100 to equip it. Even if I threw it up in my shop, I doubt many people would want it.\u201d Splendid Star sighed.It was no wonder Splendid Star felt so dejected.\u201cNo matter, just chuck it in your storage and treat it as a treasure,\u201d Sleepy Fox comforted with a smile.\u201cHaha. Indeed, it is a treasure!\u201d Splendid Star laughed loudly. He then stored the armour back into his bag.\u201cExpert, we meet again! Next time, we\u2019ll able to run a dungeon together!\u201d The Paladin Flying Stone walked over and greeted with an excited laugh.\u201cMhmm...\u201d Nie Yan replied with a slight nod.When everyone from Holy Empire suddenly began referring to Nie Yan as \u201cExpert,\u201d Splendid Star stared at him with an astonished expression. Just how high was his degree of skill?\u201cI still have business to attend to, so I\u2019ll be leaving first. I won\u2019t be troubling you two guild leaders any longer.\u201d Nie Yan excused himself and said his farewells. He still had many matters left unattended.The current highest leveled player within the game was already Level 6. Moreover, the experts of top guilds like Sleepy Fox and his group were all Level 5. Although Nie Yan did indeed obtain quite a few good pieces of equipment, this time, around, the fact remained that he still had to slowly catch up bit by bit. Hence, he didn\u2019t want too much of his time being squandered.\u201cBrother Nie Yan, don\u2019t forget your promise!\u201d Sleepy Fox, seeing Nie Yan wanted to depart, quickly called out and reminded him of their promise.\u201cI\u2019ll be fine as long as you give me three hours\u2019 prior notice,\u201d Nie Yan replied.\u201cI\u2019ll add you as a friend then,\u201d Sleepy Fox suggested and sent Nie Yan a friend request.\u201cMe as well,\u201d Splendid Star interrupted and sent Nie Yan a friend request at the same time. He also sent Sleepy Fox one as well. Holy Empire was much stronger than Splendid Tempest. Thus, adding Sleepy Fox as a friend undoubtedly gained him a powerful ally as well.\u300c System: You\u2019ve added Sleepy Fox as a friend. \u300d\u300c System: You\u2019ve added Splendid Star as a friend. \u300dIn his previous life, Nie Yan and Splendid Star had only been mere acquaintances. He had sold many pieces of equipment to Splendid Star with methods such as real life credit exchanges. However, whenever Nie Yan sold to Splendid Star, he would always buy them ten percent above the market price, which aided Nie Yan out of several desperate situations. Thus, their relationship in Nie Yan\u2019s past life carrying over in this one could also be considered a type of fate.After leaving Sleepy Fox and Splendid Star, Nie Yan headed in the direction of Link\u2019s transfer point.Due to the devastation and havoc caused by the Guardian of Order running amok, Link had become a ruin of its former self\u2014barely any buildings remained standing.I can finally finish Physician Blevins\u2019 quest. However, it\u2019s still best if I purchase more Bat Teeth first, Nie Yan pondered. Quite a bit of time had already passed, so the players should\u2019ve picked up quite a few Bat Teeth by now. As for Physician Blevins, since he had already issued the quest, he wouldn\u2019t leave before the deadline ended.Nie Yan arrived at Mordor and hung up his sign: \u201cOne Copper for One Stack of Bat Teeth!\u201d Immediately, the area bustled with activity and a large crowd of players gathered around his shop. From Nie Yan\u2019s perspective, these players were akin to an oncoming wave of money.\u201cBrother, you\u2019re here to purchase Bat Teeth again?\u201d\u201cI have a stack here with me.\u201cI have a stack as well!\u201dThe business was even livelier than it had been earlier in the morning.Nie Yan\u2019s storage began rapidly accumulating with Bat Teeth. Only after an hour did business slow down. However, by that time, his personal storage had no less than three thousand stacks of Bat Teeth piled up. He also made trips to two other towns and purchased two thousand more stacks. Afterwards, he exchanged all five thousand stacks of Bat Teeth with Blacksmith Kade for a net profit of fifty silvers.In addition to his remaining capital, he had a total of sixty-one silvers in inventory.The average beginner player regarded this amount as an unimaginably large sum of money.I\u2019ve purchased quite a few Bat Teeth today. I\u2019ll wait until tomorrow and continue buying more, Nie Yan thought. He glanced at the time\u2014June 7th. It appeared the day after tomorrow would be the announcement for the opening of a new dungeon, Sosil Valley. When the time came, he guessed many large guilds would be lining up to explore the area. Suddenly, Nie Yan recalled a certain something and smacked his head. How did I manage to forget this too!?The final boss in the Level 3 dungeon, Sosil Valley, named Bousso the Roaming Werewolf was quite difficult to deal with. Moreover, the claws of the werewolves in the dungeon were all coated with a highly toxic poison. Perhaps, not few would horrendously fall victim to this dungeon. For example, in his previous life, he and his friends had been met with such a fate when they first made their attempts. Before the dungeon had opened, one of the known cures for the poison, Black Phenol, only sold for two coppers each and the recipes to create it only sold for sixty coppers each. However, once the dungeon opened, on that day alone the price of Black Phenol shot up by five hundred percent and the recipe\u2019s price shot up by a thousand. One of his friends joked around about the matter saying if he could go back in time, he would have stocked up on Black Phenol and Black Phenol Recipes with the intent of striking it rich once the dungeon opened.At that time the matter had only been a joke, but who could have known Nie Yan would actually go back in time? This joke had ended up becoming a reality!62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38 - Boots of Swiftness (Gold)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 38 \u2013 Boots of Swiftness (Gold)Nie Yan\u2019s train of thought suddenly diverged. It wasn\u2019t only Sosil Valley. Similar situations had occurred during the future openings of other dungeons. For example, with the opening of Golden City, the prices of equipment with Dark Resistance +5 or higher increased by tenfold; when Specter Gorge opened, the prices of equipment with Focus +7 or higher increased by twentyfold. This sort of situation occurred frequently with the opening of a new dungeon, so by no means was a case like Sosil Valley isolated.After going back in time there were opportunities to strike it rich everywhere, yet he had still worried about not making enough money?Nie Yan arrived at the auction house and opened their catalog page. Within their alchemy section, he found a large amount of Black Phenol. Altogether there were a little over a hundred and eighty bottles for sale with each bottle selling for around two coppers. The current amount of uses this Black Phenol had were quite limited, which made them hard to sell and was the reason their price could not rise any higher. Nie Yan bought all one hundred and eighty bottles without the slightest hesitation. He then checked the subsection for Alchemy Recipes\u2014fifty-six Black Phenol Formulas in total, each selling for twenty or so coppers. He bought all of these in one go as wellAt this point in time, Black Phenol was classified as a useless material. However, very soon, players would quickly learn of its value. The moment Sosil Valley opened, they would return to purchase Black Phenol only discover its price had already sharply increased to a nearly unimaginable level.From then on, the market price of Black Phenol would stabilize at no less than ten coppers per bottle. Moreover, it could be frequently sold for higher.When he finished purchasing what he needed from the auction house, Nie Yan began walking over to the personal storage. He planned to leave these items there until the day Sosil Valley opened. After all, it was too much trouble keeping them on his body.Five Alchemists, each wearing a silver moon-shaped badge, strolled past Nie Yan. They paid him no heed as they passed by, seemingly enveloped in their own banter.\u201cHow strange... I wanted to buy a Black Phenol Recipe to level up my Alchemy, but who would have they were sold out. I had no choice but to buy a Silver Phenol Formula instead.\u201d\u201cHow is that possible? How many people if any ever buy that kind of item? When I checked in the morning, there were still fifty or sixty formulas for sale in the auction house.\u201d\u201cWhy would I lie to you? If you don\u2019t believe me, go check for yourself. Not only the formula, even the item itself was all sold out!\u201d\u201cIndeed, that\u2019s strange...\u201dWhen Nie Yan listened to the conversation of these Alchemists, the corner of his mouth couldn\u2019t help curving into a slight smile as these several players walked by.When he arrived, Nie Yan deposited all of the Black Phenol Formulas and bottles of Black Phenol inside his storage. Afterward, he purchased a few more consumables: Haste Scrolls, Strength Scrolls, Underwater Breathing Pills, etc... He then arrived at Tellak town through the transfer point and ran in the direction of Lake Rando.There was still half an hour until the servers shut down. So if possible, he\u2019d like to hand in the quest before going offline.Nie Yan used a Basic Haste Scroll and increased his speed by twenty percent. After thirty seconds the buff would fade away. However, he would immediately use another one to maintain his high travel speed after the Basic Haste Scroll\u2019s cooldown disappeared.If word of Nie Yan\u2019s actions were to spread, he would certainly receive a flurry of angry complaints from other players. The average player, even when encountering danger, wouldn\u2019t be willing to rashly use a luxury item such as the Basic Haste Scroll. However, Nie Yan was simply using this scroll for no other reason than to slightly increase his speed so he could save a bit of time.The Fishmen Village appeared at the edge of Nie Yan\u2019s vision. However, as he neared, he discovered the village had been turned into ruins. There were Fishmen corpses littered everywhere. This was the work of Victorious Return. However, all of their members had already departed. Under the glow of the sunset, the broken down huts of the Fishmen Village appeared especially bleak. However, after the servers shut down, everything would respawn by tomorrow.After clearing the Fishmen Village, at the very least, Victorious Return received ten pieces of Silver-grade equipment. If their luck was good, they may have even obtained one or two pieces of Gold-grade equipment. Additionally, they also obtained a large quantity of Fishscale Leather that was used to craft equipment.Turns out the members from Victorious Return move pretty quickly... Nie Yan thought. He felt a slight sense of crisis developing in his heart. Though his enemies were great in number, the most important point was that even if he was developing on his own, their growth wouldn\u2019t halt either!After passing the Fishmen Village, Nie Yan dived head-first into Lake Rando and quickly swam towards Physician Blevins\u2019 little island.Around ten minutes later, Center Island was finally within his vision. When he gazed at the island, he could make out the lonesome figure of an elderly man off in the distance. He appeared to be fishing from the shoreline underneath the waning light of the setting sun.I wonder what sort of reward I\u2019ll obtain this time around... When Nie Yan thought of this, he couldn\u2019t help but increase his pace.\u201cYoungster, you\u2019ve returned. How are you doing with the task I entrusted you?\u201d Physician Blevins asked, after seeing Nie Yan come ashore.\u201cSenior, I\u2019ve gathered all of the materials you requested. These are the ninety Fine Silks Senior tasked to me to retrieve. I hope they are enough to aid in Senior\u2019s task.\u201d Nie Yan then handed the Fine Silks to Physician Blevins.\u201cAt last, I\u2019ve collected enough Fine Silk. It seems I can return to the Hilton Stronghold by the next day. The brave warriors at the stronghold will remember your kindness. Generous and benevolent adventurer, may the Holy Radiance bless you. The darkness will finally disappear and light will spread throughout the continent,\u201d Physician Blevins replied in a hopeful tone as he stored the Fine Silks into his satchel.\u300c System: Your Influence in Hilton Stronghold has increased by 11. \u300dNie Yan glanced at the system announcement that had just appeared. In certain regions, the higher a player\u2019s influence, the easier it would become for that player to receive specific quests. Moreover, the player would also receive preferable treatment and discounts when purchasing items. When can I head to the HIlton Stronghold for a visit? I can\u2019t let these eleven Influence points go to waste! Nie Yan couldn\u2019t help but think.\u201cMay God bless the brave warriors stationed at the stronghold,\u201d Nie Yan acted in a sincere manner and replied with a prayer as well. This type of tone and speech when speaking to an NPC absolutely made a difference.\u201cThese things can be regarded as a token of my heartfelt appreciation. Generous and benevolent adventurer, I wish you a pleasant journey.\u201d\u300c System: You have received 16,523 experience points. \u300d\u300c System: You have received Boots of Swiftness (Gold). \u300d\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92Nie Yan thought he would receive three pieces of equipment as a reward for the quest, one for every twenty percent. He never expected in reality, he would only receive one. Maybe this was one of those quests that gave a better reward the more you handed in at once. Unexpectedly, the reward, this time, was a pair of Gold-grade boots!He examined the properties for this pair of boots.Boots of Swiftness (Gold)Requirements: Level 5Properties: Defense 19\u201321, Resilience +11, Movement Speed +12Weight 2 lbRestrictions: Thief, can be equipped by all factions.It adds eleven points of resilience and twelve points in movement speed! What a good item! Every point of resilience increased health by two and slightly increased defense. Eleven resilience was an increase in twenty-two health and eleven defense. Moreover, the boots also had the property of movement speed +12. It was simply one of the best pieces of equipment you could get at the early levels.I finally have a good pair of boots to use at Level 5.Nie Yan stored the Boots of Swiftness into his bag. Afterward, he expressed his gratitude to Physician Blevins. When he checked his experience bar, it was already at ninety-seven percent. He would level up very soon!There were still ten minutes or so before the servers shut down. He swam over to the nearby Water Spiders in the area and began killing. After ten minutes of nonstop training and ten spiders later, he had only risen to ninety-eight percent. It looks like I won\u2019t be able to level up today. I\u2019ll randomly kill a few mobs first thing tomorrow and I should be able to level up by then.Ah... whatever, I\u2019ll just get off now , Nie Yan thought. Since there was less than a minute remaining, it wasn\u2019t enough time for him to kill another monster. Thus, he logged off and lifted the gaming helmet off his head.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39 - Frail, Sickly, and PoorPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 39 \u2013 Frail, Sickly, and PoorWhen Nie Yan exited the game, he immediately began an intense and rhythmic exercise regimen consisting of resistance training, squats, boxing, martial arts, and reflex training. He completed each set of exercises ten times, only stopping once every five minutes to rest and replenish his stamina with nutritional supplements.Besides punching force, strong kicking power was also an important requirement in martial arts as well.Nie Yan was prepared to do weighted squats. His two legs immediately felt strained when he attached thirty kilograms of weight to his body.He placed both hands behind his head and began lowering his body from a standing position. He stopped when his knees bent at a near ninety degree angle, and then he began returning to his original position. One repetition... Two repetitions... After three repetitions not much time had passed, yet his back had already began to sweat. When he completed twenty repetitions, he felt his entire body was on the verge of collapse. However, after drinking some nutrition tonic and resting for two minutes, he continued onward with his second set of squats.Within his moment of rest, his stamina progressively recovered while his exhaustion was swept away.After going back in time, my current body\u2019s recovery ability is rather decent. With such a good aptitude, I definitely can\u2019t let it go to waste, Nie Yan couldn\u2019t help but think.When his body began gradually adapting to the additional weights, he added another five kilograms. He then picked up his machine dynamics textbook and began studying while doing squats.Read m0re at nO\u03bdE\u2113n(E)X\u0442His body was pushed to its physical limits, yet he clenched his teeth and continued to persevere.\u201cThe combined application of the lever arm and torque inside the machine... The calculation of current strength... The problems I had so much trouble with in the past were actually this easy.\u201c Nie Yan began writing and drawing on his notebook. His writing speed was fairly quick. In but a brief moment, he had solved a highly difficult problem regarding current strength.His body was exhausted at this moment. However, his mind was exceptionally active.Even if he returned to the past, he had still experienced a lifetime\u2019s worth of bitterness and solitude. Therefore, Nie Yan knew it was not easy to come by his current happy life. He wanted everyone in his life to be happy. He wanted himself to become stronger. No matter if it was in game or real life, economical ability or personal fighting accomplishments, he had to be strong in all those areas. Only then could he have the power to protect all that he held dear.Cao Xu, if you\u2019re unwilling to let my family go in this life as well, I\u2019ll definitely kill you! Nie Yan\u2019s expression flickered with murderous intent. He then added another five-kilogram weight and quickened his pace.One, two, three, four, five...The sound of his heavy breathing echoed out of the room.The affection for his loved ones and the hatred for his enemies, these were two emotions were at extremes. However, either one of them could cause a person to burst with endless potential and ability. And, at this moment, both were propelling him to move forward.\u201cNinety-seven... ninety-eight... ninety-nine...\u201d Nie Yan had reached his limit long ago. He was persevering solely through willpower alone. The weights were pushing down on his body; he was unable to breathe. However, at that moment, he explosively roared, \u201cOne hundred!\u201dNie Yan put every single muscle fibre within his being to use. Bearing the forty kilogram weights which weighed down on his body, he shakily pushed himself upright. In the instant he straightened out his body, he felt he had drained every last ounce of strength he had. An intense fatigue rushed forth as he collapsed on the floor.\u201cHah... I reached my limit.\u201d Nie Yan lay on his back while repeatedly gasping for breath, every muscle aching with pain.Even under this extreme fatigue, he could still feel the exhaustion gradually lightening in the same way as before.Nie Yan crawled back up after resting on the floor for five minutes. He felt his fatigue had significantly lessened as he stretched his four limbs.Perhaps, I should go out and test my strength, Nie Yan thought.This was an era where everyone engaged in some form of physical tempering. Nearly every citizen practiced taekwondo, kickboxing, or some other form of martial arts. There were martial arts facilities littered everywhere along any street. Usually, these martial arts facilities had several experts hired as instructors to teach patrons. Fitness equipment and exercise machines were incorporated into these facilities much like a regular gym. These facilities charged a fixed fee every hour for patrons who wished to use the equipment and machines. The working hours for the average person were quite brief, so most people liked to spend their spare time exercising at these facilities. People who didn\u2019t exercise were looked down upon by the rest of society. Even when it came to picking up girls, men who knew martial arts would have a much easier time. Furthermore, there were frequent appearances of beautiful women with fantastic figures at these martial arts facilities.Nie Yan had been through it all in his past life. He had gone mad from grief, insane from hopelessness, and debaucherous as well. He became even more of a silkpants when his father gained success. He had loitered around at all types of locations, and he especially never forgot or neglected those facilities where all the beautiful women frequented. Occasionally, he would even play around all through the night. At that time, he truly had the type of disgusting personality people could not bear. Xie Yao was the only thing that acted as a restraint in his mind and prevented him from crossing the line. Only when his father had suffered under Cao Xu\u2019s attacks did he finally return to being studious and well behaved. However, by then it was already too late.When he was well-off in his previous life, he had never gone to the martial arts facilities to actually train, but to chase girls instead. This time around, his mentality and experiences were widely different.Nie Yan walked over to the nearest martial arts facility in his area, Lin Family Martial Arts Facility. It was a facility run by the father of one of his classmates. However, this classmate wasn\u2019t someone he could particularly stand, so he hoped he wouldn\u2019t encounter her when he entered the facility.The Lin Family Martial Arts Facility couldn\u2019t be counted as particularly large, but it was still of a decent size. The interior decorations weren\u2019t bad either, and the various kinds of equipment and exercise machines were all available. In other words, within the local area, it could still be considered well-known.Nie Yan stepped into the facility. As he lowered his head and looked at the reception counter, a familiar figure entered his eyes. Dammit! Why is she at the desk today?The one receiving customers at the desk was Lin Jia. Truthfully, he and Lin Jia could be said to have a slight connection. They both lived near each other and were classmates in elementary school, middle school and high school. Her looks weren\u2019t bad either\u2014she was one of the prettiest girls in middle school. Though, when they reached high school, her looks became sorely outclassed compared to the other girls he met. In Nie Yan\u2019s eyes, there was no need for comparison when it came to her and Xie Yao. It was debatable if you tried to pass the one off as good looking, while the other was undoubtedly a beauty that moved many hearts. Despite this, during middle school, he did indeed have a crush on this girl. He had even written her a love letter, which was promptly rejected when it was received. Some time after the event, she began proclaiming publicly that Nie Yan was secretly in love with her, which left him with basically no face. This event left him with a shadow in his heart that he wasn\u2019t able to break free from until he transferred schools to the city.As he gradually grew older, he came to understand that Lin Jia was a very vain type of person. How could someone like her ever be together with an impoverished person like him? Later on, after Nie Yan turned from a poor boy into a silkpants, she and Nie Yan crossed paths again during a gathering at his place one night. That night Nie Yan threw three hundred thousand dollars worth of banknotes at her. During the whole ordeal she remained surprisingly tactful. After taking the money, she left and never tried to tangle with or get close to Nie Yan again.As he recalled this annoying memory, Nie Yan became unwilling to think of it any further.Nie Yan turned to leave. However, after pausing for a moment, he had a change of heart. Mentally, he was already a twenty-something-year-old man. There was no need for him to be bothered because of this little girl. In any case, he was going to transfer schools in the future. By then, he would have no relation to her at all, why would he have to hide?\u201cBoss, give me a card for two hours.\u201d Nie Yan placed fifty dollars on the desk counter.The voice could still be regarded as somewhat familiar to her. She lifted her head to look at the person who spoke and discovered it was Nie Yan. Waving him away, she revealed a disdainful expression and said, \u201cYou came here to find me, right? Well, I don\u2019t have any free time, so leave.\u201d In her heart, there was no difference between Nie Yan and a loudly buzzing housefly.Lin Jia was indeed a little pretty. She wore a silk dress with a neckline that exposed a large area of white skin. Her cheeks were smooth and clean. Her eyebrows were drawn in a curve with eyeliner. Paired with her bright eyes, it did indeed make her seem somewhat coquettish.However, before Nie Yan\u2019s current gaze, Lin Jia was nothing more than a little girl who knew how to dress up slightly, that\u2019s all. During middle school, his eyes must have truly been covered with shit to have been infatuated with a girl like her. Later on, during several student gatherings, he had found girls more beautiful than her everywhere. At that time he realized, she was only considered more beautiful because she was slightly better than her peers at dressing up, and putting on makeup. This was the sole reason she was able to stay popular during their time together in middle school and high school.\u201cI want a two-hour card to use the gym.\u201d Nie Yan indifferently glanced at Lin Jia.\u201cNie Yan, I already told you. Stop coming around to pester me. With a scrawny matchstick appearance like yours, you still want to come here and exercise?\u201d Lin Jia replied with a sneer on her face. She then waved her hand and threw a card at Nie Yan.This girl has been watching too many television dramas... Nie Yan was too lazy to bother with this girl. He picked up the exercise card and headed farther into the facility.Lin Jia still wanted to say a few more words, but Nie Yan had already turned around. Thus, what was left facing her was only his back. The few words she had left to say were swallowed back down her throat. However, she then followed with a sneer and said, \u201cYour family owes five, six hundred thousand dollars in debt, making you a penniless bum. Your group of relatives drop by every day demanding repayment, and your parents are nowhere to be found. You still have the whim to come here and exercise?\u201dWhen her harsh words reached Nie Yan\u2019s ears, his heart rose with a slight anger. If this were the previous him, perhaps he would have already rushed up in a rage. However now, as a twenty-eight-year-old man, it just wasn\u2019t worth his time arguing with a snobbish brat who had barely reached adulthood.Lin Jia gazed at the receding figure of Nie Yan\u2019s back. She stared absentmindedly as if she were looking at an illusion. From when she last recalled, Nie Yan didn\u2019t seem this muscular or robust.\u201cPeh, how is that possible? This guy is a famous matchstick known for always being frail and sickly. Even if he didn\u2019t move, he\u2019d get sick and ask for a leave of absence.\u201d The tone of her voice contained a trace of mockery.\u201cLin Jia, who was that person just now?\u201d asked a young man who went over to Lin Jia\u2019s side. His hair was dyed blonde and he appeared to be in his early twenties.\u201cThat was one of my classmates. One of our \u2018honour students\u2019 who ranked third in literature!\u201d Lin Jia replied. Her expression immediately revealed a charming smile when she saw this young man coming over.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In my eyes, he\u2019s no more than fart. With a tiny body like that, I bet I could send him flying with a single punch. Hey, babe... What say you and I head over to the hotel tonight and have some fun?\u201d The young man named Bao Wei groped Lin Jia\u2019s perky buttocks with his perverted hand. A moment later, the hand began reaching deeper under her skirt.\u201cHehe. You know this is my father\u2019s place, right? If he catches you, he might even beat you to death.\u201d Lin Jia rejected his advances and pushed his hand aside. Nevertheless, her actions and tone were quite gentle as she giggled while reprimanding him.Nie Yan inwardly sneered when he caught a glance of what was occurring back at the desk counter. Turning his back, he proceeded to the machines to test his strength.The first machine was to test his pulling strength. Nie Yan sat back and placed both hands on the grips of the machine. \u201cNhgh...\u201d He heavily grunted and pulled down on the machine handles. Under the sudden change in force, the machine\u2019s display began rapidly flashing with numbers.\u300c60 kg\u300d\u2192\u300c80 kg\u300d\u2192 \u300c100 kg\u300d\u2192\u300c161 kg\u300d\u2192\u300c162 kg\u300dNie Yan released his grip on the handles when he couldn\u2019t hold on any longer. \u201cHah...\u201d He gasped heavily for breath.The value was too lacking when compared to his previous self. However, relatively speaking, it could already be regarded as pretty good with his current physique.The following machine tested how much weight he could squat. Nie Yan walked up to it and began bearing its increasing weight on his back.\u300c80 kg\u300d\u2192\u300c90 kg\u300d\u2192 ...The number displayed on the machine steadily increased. It soon reached ninety kilograms, a weight which surpassed the limit of some amateur athlete fighters.\u201cHey, what are you looking at?\u201d Bao Wei asked, nudging Lin Jia beside him.\u201cHow is this possible...?\u201d Lin Jia muttered to herself while gazing in a certain direction. Her mind which was reeling back in extreme shock.\u201cWhat\u2019s not possible?\u201d Bao Wei turned his head to look in the same direction. He was left momentarily stunned as he stood there with his eyes widened and a blank expression on his face.It was quite evident Nie Yan\u2019s stature was on the somewhat small and thin side. Yet at this moment, his small body, which bore several times its own weight, was gradually lowering as he squatted down. If one looked, the screen on the squat machine displayed a value of over one hundred and sixty kilograms! Such a scene was simply terrifying... What kind of monster was he?In international competitions, there was no lack of athletes squatting well over a thousand kilograms. However, these people were all unequaled strong men who\u2019ve gone through specialized training. For the average fighter, it was already quite excellent if they could squat two or three hundred kilograms. Within a small town like Ningjiang, the number of people who could squat over one hundred and sixty kilograms could still be counted on two hands. Just how did Nie Yan possess such a terrifying amount of strength with such a small and thin physique?After getting one hundred and sixty kilograms on the squat machine, Nie Yan arrived beside the machine that tested punching strength. After a moment of stretching, Nie Yan entered a basic fighting stance. He resembled a cheetah in the moment he struck his fist out.\u300cBOOM!\u300dThe sound of his fist hitting the machine reverberated. The screen on the machine displayed a punching force of one hundred and thirty kilograms.\u300cPunch Strength: A new record has been set!\u300dSince Ningjiang was a small town, it was even rarer for an expert to frequent a place like the Lin Family Martial Arts Facility. One hundred thirty kilograms was all it took to set a new record in a facility? Others in less remote regions would have felt this was some sort of joke.Read m0re at nO\u03bdE\u2113n(E)X\u0442My body\u2019s foundation isn\u2019t bad, Nie Yan thought, before walking over to the machine that tested reaction time.Leg strength, arm strength, core strength, etc... were the basic foundations of a fighter. Therefore, even if Nie Yan hadn\u2019t learned any fighting techniques, he could still become a city-level athlete fighter. He could easily enter the finals of a city-level competition solely by relying on his physical prowess.\u300cReaction Speed: A new record has been set!\u300d\u300cKick Strength: A new record has been set!\u300d\u300cRunning Speed: A new record has been set!\u300dLin Jia was stunned as she watched Nie Yan set new records one after another in the facility. The world must have gone crazy. Was the person she looked at truly Nie Yan? As she recalled, Nie Yan had always been a feeble boy who would fall over from the slightest breeze. Who would have ever thought his inner aptitude was so surprisingly strong to an extent like this? All of the previous records in these machines were set by her father. However, six of them were now broken by Nie Yan. As for the others, Nie Yan\u2019s numbers were about the same as her father\u2019s. Since this was the case, wouldn\u2019t that mean Nie Yan was even stronger?\u201cWho is that guy? He\u2019s a monster...\u201d Bao Wei asked as his voice slightly trembled. This guy is even stronger than the bodyguards back home. Thank god I didn\u2019t mess with him earlier. Otherwise, with his strength, a single kick would break several of my ribs...Lin Jia had a sour feeling in her heart. Nie Yan had never shown off in front of her in such a way before. If she had known he was this strong, she would have already tried getting in bed with him long ago. From her perspective, a woman needed to be conquered by a man. The stronger the man was, the more sense of security she would feel. If only she had known he was this strong earlier... So what if he was poor as hell? With his strength, if he applied to enter the number one military academy after graduation, she had no doubts he would easily be accepted. Entering the number one military academy was equivalent to possessing a bright future. She only now understood how blind and foolish she was in the past. She had mistaken a precious jade for a useless pebble.My reaction speed still isn\u2019t fast enough , Nie Yan inwardly criticized. Reaction speed directly influenced the outcome of a fight. Moreover, reaction and thinking speed were both very important factors when playing Conviction as well.A large crowd was gathered in a circle around the facility\u2019s arena. They were there to spectate the two fighters who were in the middle of a spar. At this moment, however, everyone\u2019s attention was drawn solely onto Nie Yan.The crowd couldn\u2019t help but wonder, who was this terrifying brat?A quiet sense of fear radiated throughout the facility. Nie Yan raised his head and discovered everyone was staring at him. He glanced at the arena and saw two heavily built men standing there. They were both around one hundred and eighty centimeters tall and their bodies were covered in robust muscles. With a single look, anyone could tell they been training for a long time.At that moment, Nie Yan was slightly itching to test out his skill. He stared at those two men and asked without a second thought, \u201cHey, you two over there. Are you guys interested in having a spar?\u201d\u201cN-no, there\u2019s no need!\u201d The taller man in blue gym shorts hurriedly declined as he felt his legs go somewhat soft.\u201cNo thanks, I\u2019m fine as well!\u201d The other man in red gyms shorts quickly declined as well. This was some sort of joke. Who in their right mind would fight someone who had a punching strength of a hundred thirty kilograms and kicking strength of two hundred sixty kilograms? Let alone them, this kind of monster would even sweep all of his competition in city-level tournaments. A single punch from him, and they\u2019d most likely be hospitalized for three months.Nie Yan felt slightly disappointed after hearing their responses. It seems he wouldn\u2019t get the opportunity to experience the pleasure of a fight today. He looked at the time and noticed his two hours were almost up. He then turned back and headed for the reception desk.When Bao Wei who was standing beside the desk saw Nie Yan arriving, he revealed a flattering smile and made way for Nie Yan by retreating off to the side.Lin Jia tidied up her hair and revealed what she considered a charming smile. Nie Yan, however, felt it was quite nauseating.\u201cI\u2019m returning this.\u201d Nie Yan threw the card on the counter.\u201cBrother Nie, there\u2019s no need to pay the fee for the two hours here. Consider it as me treating you. Furthermore, here\u2019s the reward for setting new records in the facility. Altogether, it\u2019s twenty-six thousand.\u201d Lin Jia took out a bank card and handed it over to Nie Yan.All training facilities gave out established rewards. If a patron came in and set a new record on one of the machines, they would receive some reward money. This was a sort of business. The records for the various machines were connected throughout the entire country. If a record was set, and the higher the test results, it could raise the influence of a facility. Thus, in order to attract more experts to their place, establishments used methods such as giving out rewards.Twenty-six thousand was roughly the amount of profit a large training facility made in a day.\u201cThanks.\u201d Nie Yan put the bank card in his pocket. Although he was disgusted by a person like Lin Jia, he wasn\u2019t one to make life difficult for someone who was handing him money. After receiving this money, he could use it to buy better nutritional supplements.\u201cBrother Nie, I have some free time later tonight. Are you interested in having a drink with me at the Evening Trance tonight? It\u2019s my treat,\u201d Lin Jia asked, revealing an expression she considered to be seductive.The Evening Trance was a well-known drinking establishment in Ningjiang. It was also rather high class with many sectioned off private rooms installed inside the establishment. Many of which were used to commit unsavory actions. Needless to say, Lin Jia\u2019s invitation was undoubtedly a dubious one. A man and a woman entering together in a private room, who wouldn\u2019t know what was going to happen?Although Lin Jia was somewhat good looking, Nie Yan had met numerous beautiful women in his past life. Furthermore, how could Lin Jia ever compare to Xie Yao?\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll have to decline,\u201d Nie Yan disinterestedly replied. He turned around and walked towards the exit.Lin Jia originally believed that by relying on her beauty she could seduce Nie Yan. She never expected that she would immediately have the door slammed right in front of her face. She stood there momentarily puzzled. Wasn\u2019t Nie Yan always secretly in love with her? Wasn\u2019t she returning the feelings he had written for her in that love letter? Nie Yan\u2019s cold and indifferent attitude left her somewhat angry and resentful.Before walking out of the door, Nie Yan turned around and said, \u201cWhen school starts, tell everyone in our class that I transferred schools and I\u2019ll visit them sometime in the future.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re transferring schools? Where?\u201d Lin Jia asked in surprise.\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business,\u201d Nie Yan replied, walking out of the facility.\u201cSince that guy rejected you, I\u2019m free tonight. How about we head to the Evening Trance together?\u201d Bao Wei happily laughed. He then walked up and pinched Lin Jia\u2019s soft bosom.\u201cScram!\u201d Lin Jia was in a terrible mood and angrily slapped Bao Wei\u2019s hand away.\u201cTsk... You\u2019re just a cheap slut who\u2019d sleep with anyone. What\u2019s so great about you?\u201d Bao Wei sneered after being rejected by Lin Jia and turned to leave.Lin Jia gazed at Nie Yan\u2019s retreating back and spat out in disdain. Peh! Aren\u2019t you just a poor brat, yet you\u2019re so high standard that even this lady here isn\u2019t good enough for you? However, Lin Jia understood the reality of the situation. Nie Yan\u2019s talent would most likely allow him to soar into the heavens. Thus, she could only stand there sourly and let out a few curses.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although he was quite lacking compared to those expert fighters, he should still be able to handle himself if he came across unexpected circumstances.With twenty-eight thousand dollars in reward money, Nie Yan headed to the department store to purchase ten or so tubes of nutritional supplements, which were enough to last him for the rest of the month.Nie Yan continued exercising when he returned home. During the past few days, aside from gaming, he spent the rest of his time exercising and studying. As for other matters, he\u2019d have to put them aside until his parents returned.Just like this, half a day quickly passed by. It was near five in the evening and the game servers would be opening soon. Nie Yan reclined on the bed with the gaming helmet on his head.As soon as he entered the game, he began to diligently train by grinding the surrounding Water Spiders. As several spiders met their deaths one after another by his hands, his experience bar gradually rose. He would level up shortly after ten or so mobs.\u300c Nie Yan, where are you right now? \u300dYao Yao asked Nie Yan through voice chat.\u300c I\u2019m still at Lake Rando killing Water Spiders. \u300d\u300c Come to the Tellak town transfer point in five minutes. We\u2019re about to set off very soon. Bring that friend of yours over as well. \u300d\u300c Alright, \u300dNie Yan replied.\u300c If that\u2019s all, I guess we\u2019ll meet in five minutes then. \u300d\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92After disconnecting from the voice chat with Yao Yao, Nie Yan contacted Tang Yao.\u300c Tellak town transfer point. Our team is about to head out soon. Quickly get over there. \u300d\u300c This early? \u300dTang Yao replied in surprise. His tone contained eagerness and pleasant surprise.\u300c Generally, people run dungeons as early in the day as possible rather than later. Besides, it\u2019s better to set off in the morning compared to the afternoon or evening. \u300d\u300c Gotcha, I\u2019ll head there right now, \u300dTang Yao replied and hurriedly prepared himself to leave.Nie Yan checked his experience bar\u2014Level 3, 99%. Filling up the remaining one percent would still require ten minutes of grinding at the very least. Since it appeared he didn\u2019t have enough time, he took out a return scroll and began unravelling it. After twenty seconds and a brilliant flash of light, the scenery before his eyes shifted. He had returned to town.\u300c Where are you? Coordinates? \u300dNie Yan asked Tang Yao through voice chat.\u300c Hey, I can see you. I\u2019ll come over, so stay where you are. \u300dTang Yao came walking over from the plaza in the distance. He was garbed from head to toe in a fiery red mage robe. It appeared especially conspicuous within the crowd and attracted the envious gazes of the surrounding players. Tang Yao had even unconsciously straightened his back and puffed out his chest.The equipment he wore was a symbol of high honour because it represented the presence of an expert.\u201cSo, how\u2019d your practice at home go?\u201d Nie Yan asked. Tang Yao appeared to be full of energy when Nie Yan gazed at him. He no longer looked like the depressed and dispirited player he remembered in his past life.\u201cNot bad. You\u2019ll know in just a bit. I didn\u2019t improve by just a small amount either! Hey, listen to this! When I logged off, that brat Wei Kai actually called me up. That guy surprisingly wanted to curry some favour with us. He even asked for your phone number. Anyway, I made him my training partner and had several dozen matches with him. That guy didn\u2019t even win a single match!\u201d\u201cYou sure he didn\u2019t just let you win?\u201d Nie Yan asked with a smile. In his mind, he knew this was exactly Wei Kai\u2019s style of handling affairs.\u201cYou\u2019re underestimating me too much. I\u2019m actually quite skillful now, y\u2019know? Hey, when Wei Kai called me up in the afternoon, he said you went to the Lin Family Martial Arts Facility. You didn\u2019t go there looking for Lin Jia, did you? I really couldn\u2019t believe it. How could you possibly like that woman? I heard she\u2019s already slept with many guys.\u201d\u201cThat was back in middle school when I was still naive and young. Now, I don\u2019t have any interest in her. I only went to the facility to test out my strength.\u201d\u201cWhen I thought it over, I believed this was the most likely case as well. How could you possibly be attracted to Lin Jia? If you\u2019re looking for a girl, this brother here can help introduce you to one!\u201d Tang Yao laughed while he pat on Nie Yan\u2019s shoulder.\u201cWith the type of girls you\u2019re acquainted with, it\u2019s better if you keep them to yourself.\u201d Nie Yan rolled his eyes at Tang Yao\u2019s antics.A sweet fragrance entered Nie Yan\u2019s nose. The scent belonged to a lily perfume sold in NPC stores. It was simple, elegant, and pleasant to the nose. He knew exactly who had arrived the moment this scent entered his nose.\u201cAll you think about is things like picking up girls all day. I knew you weren\u2019t a good person.\u201d Yao Yao muttered to herself.Nie Yan knowingly smiled when he heard this voice. He turned his head and saw Yao Yao\u2019s charming figure standing right behind him. She was dressed in a pure white mage gown. It was like mercury falling, complementing her perfect body. Her hair hung down, and the pink kerchief she had tied over her head made her appear all the more lovely.It was as if she walked out from the canvas of a beautiful painting.Tang Yao stared at the beautiful Yao Yao standing by Nie Yan\u2019s side with saliva almost dripping from his mouth. He stood there with a blank expression for what seemed like half a day before elbowing Nie Yan in the side. \u201cSo beautiful! A first-rate beauty! Oh my God... Nie Yan, is this your girlfriend?\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying? Who are you saying is his girlfriend?\u201d Yao Yao\u2019s eyes widened into a furious glare. She was absolutely fuming. Before her eyes, this vulgar fellow surprisingly said she was Nie Yan\u2019s girlfriend. \u201cHmph! Indeed, birds of a feather do flock together...\u201d\u201cExactly, birds of a feather do flock together. Otherwise, you also wouldn\u2019t have come here looking for us!\u201d Nie Yan laughed while teasing Yao Yao.\u201cY-you... Hmph! This magnanimous lady is going to ignore you. Senior Sister Yu Lan (Blue Feather) and the rest of them are already at the transfer point. Let\u2019s go and meet up with them.\u201d Since she couldn\u2019t outwit Nie Yan, Yao Yao quickly changed the subject.Tang Yao suddenly realized something as he watched the Nie Yan and Yao Yao bickering. What was it called again? He seemed to have forgotten. Oh, that\u2019s right, it\u2019s definitely this! It was a lovers\u2019 quarrel. He had seen many couples that enjoyed bickering like this before. Although Tang Yao himself was a person who was usually lecherous and full of hormones, he still held some principles. He might take away another person\u2019s woman, but when it came to his own brother\u2019s, he definitely wouldn\u2019t interfere.Tang Yao mentally gave Nie Yan\u2019s a thumbs up and secretly whispered, \u201cYou do have some skill after all.\u201dTang Yao\u2019s mentality immediately diverged. From then on, he viewed Yao Yao as nothing more than a potential friend. Seeing this, Nie Yan couldn\u2019t help smiling; however, he was too lazy to explain. Besides, when it came to these matters, explaining them would only make things messier.The three began walking in the direction of the transfer point.\u201cNie Yan, is this your friend? That guy has a vulgar appearance, but it looks like his equipment is pretty good. What kind of equipment is he wearing?\u201d Yao Yao curiously asked.Tang Yao\u2019s cheeks were streaming with tears. Why was this beautiful woman right beside him, when describing his appearance, not using words like confident, dashing, or crushingly handsome, but instead using words like vulgar?\u201cFire Chaser Set,\u201d Nie Yan replied. He noticed Yao Yao\u2019s hair beneath her kerchief was folded into several layers. The irregular arrangement was quite charming and revealed it was done with the utmost care.\u201cThe Fire Chaser Set dropped from Blackflame Forest?\u201d Yao Yao exclaimed in surprise. She knew Blackflame Forest was a much more difficult dungeon compared to Treant Forest. Only the elite teams from large guilds would enter these dungeons! After realizing this, Yao Yao couldn\u2019t help but look at Tang Yao in a new light. Those who were able to run Blackflame Forest were definitely experts. \u201cI never expected this wretched fatty was actually a powerful expert.\u201dTang Yao had advanced from a vulgar person into a wretched fatty.However, after Yao Yao added that he was a powerful expert, Tang Yao felt slightly better\u2014even somewhat proud of himself. He also had somewhat of a guilty conscious. This title of \u201cexpert\u201d was merely a forgery. When compared to genuine experts, he was still lacking by a whole grade.\u201cNie Yan, my kerchief is pretty isn\u2019t it? It was a drop I got from farming in the Radiant Ruins. It\u2019s Holy Damage +3.\u201d Yao Yao did a little spin. Her fluttering mage gown resembled a snow lotus in bloom as her kerchief danced in the air. To an onlooker, it was especially moving. It seemed she still held the slight temperament of a child. If she had something nice, she couldn\u2019t help but show it off. Moreover, the displeasure she held towards Nie Yan from their prior conversation appeared to have been completely forgotten.\u201cMhmm, it does look very pretty,\u201d Nie Yan replied with a nod of his head. Yao Yao had this magical characteristic about her. She was able to let any person completely forget about their worries.\u201cBrother, not bad... You should make your move at the first opportunity. Otherwise, she\u2019ll get taken away by another person and it would be too late to regret by then!\u201d62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There, a group of ten or so players was waiting together, crowded together like how the stars cupped themselves around the moon. At the center of their attention was a curvaceous beauty in azure armour.\u201cSenior Sister Yu Lan (Blue Feather), they\u2019re here.\u201d Yao Yao walked to Yu Lan\u2019s side.The two gorgeous beauties standing side by side were an especially stunning sight to behold.\u201cWhat luck! We\u2019re encountering beauties as soon as we set out. So beautiful! So gorgeous!\u201d Tang Yao softly whispered. This little scoundrel was a lecherous pervert who wouldn\u2019t change even if you beat him to death. He enjoyed looking at beautiful women, but he knew very well that most of these beauties would never put him in their eyes. Therefore, he did nothing more than ogle.\u201cPleasure to meet you,\u201d Yu Lan said, facing Nie Yan and Tang Yao. She carefully observed Nie Yan. Although his appearance seemed somewhat juvenile, his calm and unhurried bearing made him look quite composed. The most noticeable trait was the air of confidence and decisiveness that surrounded him. Since she could still be regarded as experienced and knowledgeable, she could discern he possessed some of the special characteristics of an expert. As for the fatty standing by his side... She didn\u2019t know what to make of him.\u201cLikewise.\u201d Nie Yan slightly nodded in reply. Yu Lan\u2019s complete set of azure armour perfectly revealed the curves of her model-like figure. A glimpse of her deep cleavage could be seen in the opening near her chest. From head to toe, she radiated a fatal, wild attractiveness. She undoubtedly possessed the best figure out of all the women he had met before. Moreover, she had a beautiful face as well. This devastating combination was practically capable of seducing men to their deaths.In spite of this, Nie Yan held no interest or desires towards her.Tang Yao, however, had a little trouble shifting his gaze. When comparing Yao Yao and Yu Lan, the latter evidently suited his tastes much more.\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92\u201cTake care, this beauty is someone even I don\u2019t dare to provoke,\u201d Nie Yan secretly informed Tang Yao.\u201cH-hello,\u201d Tang Yao stumbled as he greeted her in an overly reserved manner.Nie Yan\u2019s eyes widened in surprise. This little scoundrel often couldn\u2019t restrain himself when in front of beautiful women due to his perverted nature and natural tendencies as a chatterbox. However, today, Nie Yan was witnessing an unprecedented event. This chatterbox was acting quite shy and reserved! Am I dreaming? Did the sun rise from the west this morning?\u201cAlright, let\u2019s get ready to set off for the dungeon. If you have something to say, we\u2019ll talk on the road there.\u201d Yu Lan consistently paid attention to efficiency, thus she didn\u2019t want to waste any more time standing around.\u201cRemember our prior agreement. I\u2019ll be acting as team captain during the run, so I want everyone listening to my arrangements,\u201d Nie Yan promptly reminded Yu Lan. His gaze was sharp and resolute.\u201cAlright.\u201d Yu Lan nodded in reply. She turned around and addressed the rest of her team. \u201cI\u2019m disbanding the team. In a moment, accept Nie Yan\u2019s invite to form a team. He\u2019ll be temporarily acting as team captain, so listen to his arrangements!\u201dThe rest of the members began heavily discussing. They were unfamiliar with Nie Yan. Therefore, in their hearts, they were somewhat unwilling to take commands from this stranger.\u201cYu Lan, why do we have to take orders from this guy? If by any chance he doesn\u2019t know anything and ends up getting our team wiped, what do we do then?\u201d The one who spoke was Chen Bo[1. Chen Bo appears in chapter 17 for the first time.]. Nie Yan and Yao Yao\u2019s seemingly intimate relationship had caused a sense of crisis to arise. As a result, he regarded Nie Yan with an intense hostility.Nie Yan wasn\u2019t unfamiliar with this Chen Bo. He was a classmate of Yu Lan and they were quite familiar with each other. In the past, he had always been pursuing Yu Lan, but after meeting Yao Yao, his mind went into a state of chaos. He liked all beauties. So, he didn\u2019t know which one he should pursue. Therefore, he decided to make both his property and became unwilling to let any others come near the two. However, to his misfortune, both girls greatly disliked him and as a result, he ended up getting neither. Simply put, he was merely a useless brat with some wealth who got smitten with any beauty he laid eyes on.In Nie Yan\u2019s past life, this scoundrel was a walking tragedy. In this life, after encountering Nie Yan, it appeared he was still destined to become a walking tragedy.\u201cYou are...?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m called Chen Bo!\u201d\u201c Morning Wood? Ohh~ I see... So it was Elder Brother Morning Wood !\u201d Nie Yan\u2019s tone dripped with sarcasm. He feigned surprise and acted as if Chen Bo\u2019s input held great importance.\u201cI said my name is Chen Bo!\u201cThe same \u2018Chen\u2019 as in the surname.\u201cAnd the \u2018Bo\u2019 in \u2018enormous\u2019!\u201d Chen Bo replied in an irritated tone.\u201cI did say Morning Wood ! I didn\u2019t speak incorrectly, did I?\u201d Nie Yan innocently gazed at Tang Yao by his side.Tang Yao clearly understood what was going on. Nie Yan was simply messing with Chen Bo and mispronouncing his name on purpose. Tang Yao was practically dying as he held back a belly full of laughter. He restrained himself and said with a smiling expression, \u201cRight, you didn\u2019t speak incorrectly. You did say Morning Wood .\u201d Tang Yao even purposefully enunciated the two words in a serious tone.However, from the smiling expressions on their faces, it was clear they weren\u2019t pronouncing Chen Bo\u2019s name correctly and were pronouncing it as \u2018Morning Wood\u2019 instead.Granted even if the person were an idiot, they would clearly understand what was going on. Yao Yao flashed a beautiful smile as two dimples emerged on her face. She shot a glance at Nie Yan, feigning displeasure. This guy is too awful. You can\u2019t just humiliate people like this...The majority of people she and Yu Lan met were quite reserved while in front of them. That being said, Nie Yan\u2019s frank and forthright manner of speaking didn\u2019t arouse her disgust. On the contrary, she felt Nie Yan was different from people like Chen Bo who often hid their true intentions and acted in an extremely hypocritical manner.Yu Lan also slightly showed signs of being unable to hold back her laughter. Seeing Chen Bo on the brink of lividness, she hurriedly took on the role of peacemaker and said, \u201cForget it, he was just joking around. Nie Yan, go create the team.\u201dNie Yan sent everyone in Yu Lan\u2019s group an invite, Chen Bo included.Chen Bo had the faint urge of lashing out.Nie Yan fixed his expression and announced in a stern and severe tone, \u201cIf you\u2019ve accepted me as team captain, you will unconditionally obey my commands as long as you\u2019re within my team. If you have any misgivings or objections, you can come looking for me after the run and settle it then. Anyone unwilling is free to leave the team right now. We can still find others to fill your spot. If you attempt to cause mischief or join with malicious intent, even if the team is completely wiped during the run, the ones suffering losses, in the end, are still yourselves. Twenty percent of your experience bar... I think it\u2019ll still take quite some time to fill back up, right?\u201dAs Nie Yan spoke, he simultaneously swept his gaze over everyone present. His imposing stature was reminiscent of a true leader. Not a single person dared to look him straight in the eye. The crowd slowly discussed amongst themselves. After a short while, the people in the group began subsequently accepting the invitation.\u300c System: Yu Lan has joined your team. \u300d\u300c System: Yao Yao has joined your team. \u300d\u300c System: Bottled Water has joined your team. \u300d...Nie Yan was quite imposing. Yu Lan\u2019s eyes flashed with praise after evaluating his performance. Perhaps he really could carry them through the Treant Forest.Yu Lan followed in a stern tone as well, \u201cRegard Nie Yan\u2019s orders as team captain as if they were given by me. Anyone who fails to comply might as well quit the team, because in the future... our team will no longer have such a person.\u201dThe crowd immediately quieted down. As her own team members, they knew this type of order was extremely severe. After being in a team with each other for so long, they were quite familiar with one another and had established amicable friendships with their surrounding teammates. If they were forced to leave the team, where would they go? Even if they found another team, one that was capable of running a twenty-player dungeon like Treant Forest was extremely difficult to find!Chen Bo held a resentful expression and was prepared to speak out.However, Yu Lan\u2019s severe gaze suddenly focused on him. Chen Bo, who was on the verge of speaking his mind, immediately swallowed his words back down his throat.\u300c System: Chen Bo has joined your team. \u300d\u201cSince all of you have already entered my team, don\u2019t blame me if I immediately kick you for disobeying orders. Our objective here is the same. We\u2019re here for the sake of getting some equipment and nothing else. If things go smoothly, we may be able to pick up even more equipment. If no issues arise, everyone here can gain at least twenty percent of a level. If there\u2019s anyone who wants to secretly sabotage the run, the damages inflicted on the entire team will be solely placed on them. The people next to you are all your fellow companions! Don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to make things difficult for your own people. If it appears I\u2019m unsuitable to lead and cause mistakes to arise, I\u2019ll hand over ten silvers to your captain, which can be considered compensation for you team!\u201d Nie Yan said. He swept his gaze over everyone present and stopped on Chen Bo.If it weren\u2019t for the fact that this high-level dungeon dropped a certain jewel, he wouldn\u2019t have even bothered coming here.Many players within the group were quite dissatisfied with Nie Yan. However, they had no choice but to concede. Nie Yan\u2019s words were quite reasonable. If they absolutely wanted to make things difficult for him, it would be the same as making things difficult for themselves. Harming others without benefitting yourself? It wasn\u2019t worth the trouble. They could only oblige themselves to listen to Nie Yan for the time being. He even gave his word and said he\u2019d compensate the team with ten silvers if huge mistakes occurred because he was unsuitable as team captain. This could already be regarded as extremely benevolent.\u201cWe\u2019ve already been wiped in this dungeon twice. It wouldn\u2019t be a strange matter if we ended up getting wiped once again. Besides, those elite teams from the large guilds frequently get wiped all the time too. We\u2019re going to the Treant Forest simply to feel things out. As for those tens silvers, how could we possibly be so shameless as to ask Brother Nie Yan for it?\u201d The one who spoke within the team was a Fighter called Bai Kaishui (Plain Boiled Water). He could be regarded as one of those players who were fair and just.One by one, the surrounding members also began agreeing with his reasoning, and their impression of Nie Yan somewhat changed as well.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 - Prior to DeparturePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 43 \u2013 Prior to Departure\u201cSince that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll start handing out orders now. If anyone\u2019s dissatisfied with me, they put can forward their own suggestions. As long as it\u2019s within reason, I\u2019ll be happy to oblige,\u201d Nie Yan said. Since his previous speech was effective, and Yu Lan\u2019s leadership could still be considered competent, he shouldn\u2019t have any problems leading this group of players through the dungeon.\u201cI\u2019d like everyone to announce their names and character information, starting from the Fighter over there,\u201d Nie Yan announced. If the most basic stat requirements weren\u2019t met, even if the team possessed a strong expert, it would be incredibly difficult for them to clear the dungeon. In other words, even if he knew how to pass through the dungeon, he\u2019d first need each member of his team to meet the basic stat requirements to even attempt it.\u201cBai Kaishui (Plain Boiled Water), Fighter, sixty-one defense, two hundred and thirty health, and twenty-seven attack,\u201d Bai Kaishui replied. He was the one who had spoken up for Nie Yan earlier. He had the appearance of a slightly rugged man in his late twenties and a robust body that resembled an ox. He was the team\u2019s main tank. With a single glance, you knew he was made to be a Warrior.\u201cSteamed Dumpling (Feishui Zhujiaozi), calling me Dumpling is fine. I\u2019m a Fighter, fifty-one defense, one hundred and sixty health, and twenty-eight attack.\u201d\u201cBlaze, Elementalist, thirty-two magic damage.\u201d...\u201cBai Kaishui, I want you to go and buy a Basic Haste Scroll. Pumpkin (Nan Gua), I want you to go and buy a Basic Strength Scroll...\u201d Nie Yan issued orders after they were all accounted for.Many of the players within the team looked at each other with embarrassed expressions. Among the average player, they were considered relatively strong experts with deep pockets, but in reality, the total wealth they had on hand absolutely didn\u2019t exceed one silver. Items like Basic Haste Scrolls, Basic Strength Scrolls, Basic Intellect Scrolls, etc., easily cost upwards of twenty coppers. Wasn\u2019t this kind of expenditure rather extreme? Even if they cleared Treant Forest, they were still unsure of the profit they\u2019d receive.\u201cHmph! Buying so many scrolls... If I was the leader and had so many scrolls, we\u2019d be able to clear the dungeon too,\u201d Chen Bo muttered to himself.Chen Bo was repeatedly making things difficult for Nie Yan. Tang Yao, who had witnessed all of this on the side, was put in quite a foul mood.\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92\u201cCould it be that you can\u2019t afford it? If you don\u2019t have the money to buy something as cheap as a scroll, I can always lend you a bit first,\u201d Tang Yao provoked, staring at Chen Bo with a disdainful gaze.\u201cTwenty coppers is nothing. It\u2019s not like this young master here can\u2019t afford it. However, this guy here clearly has selfish motives. Why isn\u2019t he making you buy Basic Intellect Scrolls, and instead making us spend all the money?\u201d Chen Bo retorted without holding back any accusations.Chen Bo\u2019s accusations gave rise to doubts among the crowd as they stared suspiciously at Nie Yan. They were all in a team together. However, if Nie Yan clearly favoured his own people and deliberately made their side spend more money, then that would simply be an extremely callous and deceptive behavior\u2014one that they could not tolerate.During the whole ordeal, Tang Yao wasn\u2019t able to give the reason why. The corner of Chen Bo\u2019s mouth curved into a sneer and he said, \u201cWhat? You don\u2019t have anything to say now?\u201dThe surrounding crowd waited for Nie Yan\u2019s reply. If he didn\u2019t give them a suitable explanation, the crowd most likely wouldn\u2019t let him off so easily.\u201cYou figured something out? You haven\u2019t figured out piss. My brother is wearing the full Fire Chaser set. His magic damage is already over fifty. Does he need to buy Basic Intellect Scrolls then? He already has a hard enough time controlling his damage as it is. Does he need a Basic Intellect Scroll to increase his magic damage further? Do you want the boss to switch aggro and split him in half?\u201d Nie Yan ruthlessly rebuked.Nie Yan\u2019s words held another implication: With the equipment Tang Yao possessed, the elite teams from large guilds would be more than happy to have him if he wanted to run a dungeon with them. Accompanying Yu Lan\u2019s team into the dungeon was the same as using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut; it was simply a waste of his talents! It was already a show of respect by showing up here, yet they still wanted to make more demands and even threw out accusations?Many of the team members after hearing Nie Yan\u2019s words held faces full of shame. Their expressions greatly changed as they gazed at the equipment on Tang Yao\u2019s body. This was, in fact, the Fire Chaser set. It was a symbol of honour. It was a sign that a player had conquered Blackflame Forest! If Tang Yao had already cleared Blackflame Forest, it meant he had long since gotten everything he needed from a lower level dungeon like Treant Forest. Yet, he had still come back here to run this dungeon with them. This alone meant he was giving their team a tremendous amount of face.Seeing the changed expressions of the surrounding crowd, Tang Yao subconsciously straightened his back. Being adored and respected by the crowd made him feel rather satisfied. Thus, Tang Yao inwardly confirmed his resolve. If I\u2019m going to wear this kind of equipment, I shouldn\u2019t lose any face. At the very least, I\u2019ve got to show the bearing of an expert.Chen Bo was momentarily left speechless. Nie Yan had ruthlessly suppressed him, and he simply had no means to retort.Yu Lan glanced at Tang Yao and carefully examined the equipment on his body. Even I couldn\u2019t recognize it at first... This wretched fatty is actually an expert!\u201cI want everyone who was called out to go and buy their respective scrolls,\u201d Yu Lan ordered. However, she was left wondering... Even if they cleared Treant Forest, would they still be able to gain a positive return after buying so many scrolls?The members whose names were mentioned left to purchase scrolls. They had already bought all the consumables they needed beforehand, so making a return trip to the stores wouldn\u2019t waste too much time.\u201cNie Yan, do we really need so many scrolls to clear Treant Forest?\u201d Yao Yao asked while her elegant eyes stared fixedly at Nie Yan. From her memory, the larger teams she knew didn\u2019t use this many scrolls when they cleared Treant Forest.\u201cYou\u2019ll know when the time comes. I am absolutely not wasting money by making them buy these scrolls,\u201d Nie Yan replied. Even if it were the elite teams from the large guilds, he reckoned they only cleared the Normal difficulty Treant Forest. However, the difficulty he was aiming for was the hardest one\u2014Specialist!\u00b9 It was impossible for them to clear the run without these scrolls.\u201cEn.\u201d Yao Yao blinked and nodded her head. Despite only knowing Nie Yan for several days, she was certain of one little thing: He was definitely someone who was capable and in no way would do something for no reason.After a short while, the people who were called out returned with their scrolls purchased.Nie Yan did roll call. All nineteen people\u2014including him\u2014were present and accounted for.\u201cIs there anyone here who can invite a strong Mage to join us? I\u2019d be more reassured if there was another high damage Mage with us,\u201d Nie Yan asked Yu Lan and her team.\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a little hard to do...\u201d Yu Lan replied in a somewhat awkward tone. For the most part, Mages who had high damage were already in fixed teams, so where could they go looking for one?\u201cI can find one. I have a classmate who belongs in Radiant Sacred Flame guild\u2019s elite team. Their team has recently been preparing for Blackflame Forest, but by chance, my classmate has some free time today,\u201d Yao Yao interjected.\u201cMale or female? How\u2019s their skill?\u201d Yu Lan asked.\u201cHe\u2019s a male and really strong too,\u201d Yao Yao replied.\u201cRadiant Sacred Flame guild? Forget it then,\u201d Nie Yan shook his head and said.\u201cWhy?\u201d Yao Yao inquisitively asked.\u201cI\u2019ve already killed several of their guild members. Right now, they have a hit order on me,\u201d Nie Yan straightforwardly replied without holding anything back. Even if the Radiant Sacred Flame guild knew he was here, what could they do about it?\u201cLast time, everyone in my party except for me was wiped out by the Radiant Sacred Flame guild. My brother here singlehandedly killed seven or eight of them to save me.\u201d Tang Yao proudly flaunted Nie Yan\u2019s accomplishments. He couldn\u2019t help but show off to everyone present that he and Nie Yan were brothers.\u201cThey were a weak group. All their players were full of beginners,\u201d Nie Yan didn\u2019t feel it was anything significant.\u201cI say, you only killed off a few noobs and you think you\u2019re so terrific? I\u2019ve killed entire teams before!\u201d Chen Bo suddenly interrupted. A sneer was on his face, and his expression was full of ridicule.Chen Bo\u2019s words infuriated Tang Yao by no small amount. The players Nie Yan killed were by no means beginners. Among them, there was even a player with the full Fire Chaser set! He was just about to retort, but Nie Yan held him back. Thus he could only suppress his anger in silence.Yu Lan crossed her arms across her chest and examined Nie Yan. Since he wasn\u2019t a brash person who liked to flaunt his accomplishments, it appeared Tang Yao\u2019s words were most likely true. After all, those who were able to corner an expert level figure like Tang Yao definitely couldn\u2019t be simple. It seemed Nie Yan wasn\u2019t only skillful in dungeons, but in player versus player situations as well.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44 - Dusk, the Arcane MagePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 44 \u2013 Dusk, the Arcane Mage\u201cWho are we going to find then?\u201d Yao Yao asked. She believed even if her classmate was part of the Radiant Sacred Flame guild, it wasn\u2019t as if he and Nie Yan were ever in direct conflict. Therefore, it didn\u2019t necessarily mean their tensions couldn\u2019t be eased. Perhaps in the future, she could even introduce them to one another and have them get to know each other. However, she chose to put this idea off until another time.After giving it some thought, Bai Kaishui (Plain Boiled Water) interjected with his own suggestion. \u201cI know a person. They\u2019re an Arcane Mage from Holy Empire. His name is Dusk (Huang Hun) and his magic damage is fifty-two. Though... I don\u2019t know if he\u2019d be interested in running this dungeon with us. He and his team have already cleared Blackflame Forest and are preparing for Agmota Muddy Wetlands, so I don\u2019t know if he\u2019d be willing to come back to Treant Forest again. I\u2019ll give him a call anyway.\u201d...A brief moment later, Yu Lan asked, \u201cBai Kaishui, how did it go? Is he willing?\u201d\u201cHe agreed!\u201d Bai Kaishui replied in excitement. This truly was unexpected. They had only met several times in the past when they partied up to grind mobs. Dusk had given Bai Kaishui quite a bit of face by agreeing to come.\u201cGreat! We now have exactly twenty players. We\u2019ll set out the moment he arrives,\u201d Nie Yan said, nodding his head. Surprisingly, it was someone from Holy Empire. A great opportunity was presenting itself to him.\u201cAh! Brother Bai Kaishui does indeed possess a lot of face. He\u2019s even able to invite someone from Holy Empire!\u201d Chen Bo praised. He shot a glance at Nie Yan and Tang Yao. If this dungeon run were to go without a hitch, he couldn\u2019t say for sure they wouldn\u2019t be frequent additions to their team activities. He had to find some way of driving these two uninvited guests out of the team and maybe even rope in a few others to help him.\u201cHow can that be? He\u2019s the one who\u2019s giving me face.\u201d Bai Kaishui was practically glowing with joy. He also felt quite proud of his accomplishment.\u201cThat kind of person is a true expert. His team is already preparing to run Agmota Muddy Wetlands! He\u2019s definitely cleared Treant Forest, so I think it\u2019s best if we make that person the team captain instead.\u201d Chen Bo shot a glance at Nie Yan and Tang Yao.This bastard Chen Bo infuriated Tang Yao by no small measure. If it weren\u2019t for Nie Yan who held him back, he would have lashed out long ago.\u201cTrue, if he\u2019s cleared Treant Forest before, it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to let him be team captain,\u201d Nie Yan replied in a dull tone.\u201cOh, so you realized your own incompetence? If you had realized it earlier, then there wouldn\u2019t have been a need for you to foolishly show off!\u201d Since Chen Bo was given an inch, he attempted to take a mile. He was a person with no sense of propriety.\u201cChen Bo...\u201d Yu Lan knitted her brows and called out in a displeased tone. She was rather annoyed with his behavior.Met with Yu Lan\u2019s reaction, Chen Bo muttered a few words to himself but no longer said anything more....\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92After a short while, the surrounding area flashed with a brilliant light and a figure emerged from the Tellak town transfer point. It was an Arcane Mage who wore a black-coloured mage robe. The man had the appearance of a person in their late twenties. His black mage robes were inscribed with various strange magical runes and he exuded a mysterious and dignified aura. Nie Yan gave him a quick glance. He could tell this person was wearing the Arcane Mage\u2019s Dark Winter set. Presently, it was a top-notch equipment set for Arcane Mages. This set and Tang Yao\u2019s Fire Chaser set were both on the same level. However, the Fire Chaser set suited Elementalists more while the Dark Winter set suited Arcane Mages. Therefore, for an Arcane Mage, the Dark Winter set was much more preferable than the Fire Chaser set.\u201cHey, Brother Dusk. Long time no see!\u201d Bai Kaishui walked forward to welcome him.\u201cLong time no see.\u201d Dusk also walked up and exchanged greetings with Bai Kaishui. He gave the crowd a quick glance and said, \u201cHello everyone.\u201d These words were spoken with a slight arrogance. He was a member of Holy Empire\u2019s elite team. His elite team and Yu Lan\u2019s small team were on a completely different level. He decided to come because Bai Kaishui\u2019s personality was decent and he had a slight friendship with him. Moreover, he had some free time because his team was making preparations for Agmota Muddy Wetlands. If it weren\u2019t for these two factors, he wouldn\u2019t have even bothered paying this small team any attention.\u201cThis is our team captain, Yu Lan.\u201d Bai Kaishui introduced Yu Lan to his friend.Dusk nodded at Yu Lan and smiled. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect your team captain was actually such a beauty. Pleased to make your acquaintance,\u201d Dusk greeted Yu Lan. This was their first meeting, and he didn\u2019t reveal the slightest bit of impoliteness when met with a beauty such as Yu Lan. He appeared refined and courteous without lacking the slightest bit of elegance.Yu Lan replied with the slight nod of her head. \u201cPleased to meet you.\u201d This Dusk did indeed possess the bearing of an expert.Chen Bo shuffled to Bai Kaishui\u2019s side. He hoped Bai Kaishui would lend him a helping hand in introducing him to the expert. However, when Dusk noticed Nie Yan standing at the back of the crowd, his eyes widened in surprise and he walked over to greet Nie Yan.\u201cI never thought Brother Nie Yan would be in a place like this!\u201d Dusk exclaimed in a pleasantly surprised tone.\u201cYou are?\u201d Nie Yan mumbled as if trying to recall who this person was. He remembered now. Back at Link town, there was such a person standing by Sleepy Fox\u2019s side.\u201cYou don\u2019t recognize me, but I recognize you! Previously when our guild leader invited you to run Agmota Muddy Wetlands, I was standing right behind him. Brother Nie Yan truly is skilled. You managed to trip Swift Slash and cause him to fall at the most crucial moment!\u201d Dusk was in high spirits as he mentioned Nie Yan\u2019s accomplishment.When the surrounding crowd heard Dusk\u2019s words, they cast their curious gazes towards Nie Yan and wondered just what kind of background he had. He even knew Holy Empire\u2019s guild leader! As for Swift Slash, they seemed to recall he was the Dark Massacre\u2019s guild leader. Every person Nie Yan had come in contact with had a terrifying amount of influence.\u201cYou know Brother Nie Yan?\u201d Bai Kaishui asked with an astonished expression.\u201cNot only do I know him, Brother Nie Yan is even currently a celebrity among our Holy Empire guild members. When our guild leader invited him to run Agmota Muddy Wetlands together, Brother Nie Yan imposed the harsh demand of getting the first pick on all Thief equipment. Not a single person in our guild would have dared to speak in such a way to our guild leader, but surprisingly our guild leader agreed to Brother Nie Yan\u2019s conditions!\u201d Dusk replied. He was a straightforward person and he didn\u2019t attempt to conceal any of the admiration he held for Nie Yan.The crowd looked at each other in shock. Who was Sleepy Fox? He was the guild leader of Holy Empire\u2014a legendary player among the player base! Nie Yan even set conditions when the guild leader of Holy Empire invited him to run Agmota Muddy Swamplands together? Didn\u2019t this clearly signify Sleepy Fox was the one currying favour with Nie Yan?As the guild leader of Holy Empire, how could Sleepy Fox\u2019s judgement possibly be lacking?Going by that logic, wouldn\u2019t this mean Nie Yan was a god-like figure who didn\u2019t heed the most elite teams even if they begged him to come? If that was the case, Nie Yan\u2019s conditions for running Treant Forest with their own team were actually rather light.Dusk was a member of Holy Empire. It was unlikely his words were a lie.\u201cYao Yao, it seems you actually invited an esteemed expert to help us,\u201d Yu Lan teased in a joking manner.Yao Yao\u2019s eyebrow curved into crescents. Her face was brimming with joy from the pride she felt.Chen Bo didn\u2019t anticipate Nie Yan to have such a powerful background. He finally became aware that he and Nie Yan weren\u2019t on the same standing. As if he were a shrivelled eggplant, he stood foolishly to the side, seething in anger when a malicious thought came to mind. He definitely had to make Nie Yan pay a heavy price for crossing his path.When the crowd gazed at Nie Yan, their eyes flashed with a peculiar glint. Each and every one of them was trying to guess what sort of background he had.Tang Yao was the happiest among all of them. He elbowed Nie Yan in the side and whispered, \u201cNot bad! You really did conceal yourself well. When did you meet the guild leader of Holy Empire?\u201d\u201cYesterday,\u201d Nie Yan calmly replied. The respect he gained wasn\u2019t given by others. Rather, it was acquired by himself. Truthfully speaking, if he didn\u2019t have any skill, it wouldn\u2019t have mattered how much face Sleepy Fox gave him\u2014it would all be useless. His present goal was still to clear Treant Forest. He put other matters aside for now.He was attempting a difficulty even the most elite of teams didn\u2019t dare to rashly attempt\u2014Specialist!\u201cSince everyone\u2019s here, let\u2019s set off,\u201d Nie Yan ordered. He then began walking in the direction of the town exit.\u201cBrother Nie Yan, why are you still running Treant Forest?\u201d Dusk curiously asked. He reasonably believed Nie Yan had absolutely no reason to waste his time on this sort of low-level dungeon with his level of skill.\u201cI want the Treant King\u2019s Featherfall Jewel. Also, this dungeon drops some of the better Thief equipment. Perhaps one or two of them will drop during this run,\u201d Nie Yan replied. In any case, everyone would eventually find out what he was planning when they arrived at the dungeon, so it wasn\u2019t necessary for him to hide anything. Besides, his impression of Dusk was rather decent.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What kind of item is that? We\u2019ve run this dungeon five or six times in the past and we\u2019ve never once gotten any \u2018Featherfall Jewel,\u2019\u201d Dusk exclaimed in surprise.Dusk didn\u2019t know what the Featherfall Jewel was because it was only a drop on the Specialist difficulty. Moreover, it\u2019d only drop from the Treant King. The dungeon\u2019s difficulty changed depending on the overall level of the team\u2014if there were more high-level players in the team, the dungeon\u2019s difficulty would increase to compensate.If players wanted to clear the Specialist Treant Forest, it definitely wouldn\u2019t be an easy task. Even the elite teams from large guilds would have quite a hard time in clearing the dungeon. With this fact in mind, the Featherfall Jewel\u2019s value became even more apparent.\u201cYou\u2019ll know when the time comes,\u201d Nie Yan replied in a dull tone.Dusk felt slightly puzzled. However, after giving it some thought, he realized since Nie Yan wasn\u2019t telling him now, he\u2019d eventually find out with the rest of the team later!\u201cThis Tang Yao\u2019s equipment is a bit strange. He\u2019s clearly an Arcane Mage, but why is he wearing the Fire Chaser set?\u201d Dusk asked in a confused tone.Normally, with the way equipment distribution was managed in teams, the Elementalists of the team would definitely have priority on drops such as the Fire Chaser set. So, it was quite strange for the set to be given to an Arcane Mage.Nie Yan replied with a faint smile but didn\u2019t bother explaining.Tang Yao slightly reddened in embarrassment upon hearing their conversation. He really did have somewhat of a guilty conscious when wearing this Fire Chaser set. However, this made him even more determined. He definitely needed to get a hold of a first-rate equipment set for his class with his own power. Only then could he gain some confidence and have some self-respect for himself.\u201cNie Yan, how did you meet the Holy Empire\u2019s guild leader?\u201d Yao Yao asked. Her bright and curious gaze made her appear especially cute.\u201cIn reality, it isn\u2019t as amazing as you\u2019re all thinking it to be.\u201d Nie Yan then narrated yesterday\u2019s events to Yao Yao. However, he left out the matter regarding the Chapter of Courage.\u201cI still can\u2019t help but think you\u2019re quite amazing,\u201d Yao Yao earnestly said. However, if this matter wasn\u2019t related to Sleepy Fox, she also wouldn\u2019t have thought this highly of Nie Yan.\u201cI still feel the event was a little strange. Why would a dragon all of a sudden invade the town for no reason? Generally, Elite- and Lord-class monsters don\u2019t leave their territories,\u201d Dusk curiously remarked. He still remained quite puzzled over the whole situation. Calling this sort of event rare was quite an understatement.Nie Yan glanced at the Chapter of Courage in his bag. He sincerely hoped no one connected the appearance of the Guardian of Order with him.\u201cWhat\u2019s so strange about that? The game developers probably had the monster siege the town as an event for the players. You know, to spice things up and add some excitement. Something like this isn\u2019t rare at all in these sort of games,\u201d Tang Yao said in a matter-of-fact tone. His comment had unintentionally aided Nie Yan by explaining the matter away.\u201cAh, you\u2019re probably right.\u201d Dusk nodded in agreement.After the party of twenty players passed through a wide open prairie, they were met with a lush and verdant forest at the base of a faraway mountainside. There an eerie mist lingered, appearing as if it would encircle the dense forest eternally. This area was a well known twenty-player dungeon\u2014Treant Forest. It took more than ten minutes of travel time to reach this destination from Tellak town.\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92Many players idled at the entrance of the forest. Most of them were other twenty-player teams who were here to run the dungeon as well.\u201cIt seems Treant Forest is also pretty lively. There sure are many people here.\u201d\u201cThe average players have leveled up. If they want better equipment, they have no choice but to run the dungeons.\u201dTreant Forest was still relatively difficult for the average player. The equipment dropped was also much better than the ones dropped from common dungeons. Most teams were unable to clear the dungeon, but it was still worth the run for the experience and potential dropped items. After all, if a team was unable to advance any further, they could simply withdraw from the dungeon. Although the Honour points they\u2019d be missing out on wasn\u2019t few, the majority of teams running the dungeons weren\u2019t elites from the large guilds, so they didn\u2019t care much about gaining Honour. Therefore, whether Honour points were lost or not, it was fine as long the team wasn\u2019t wiped.Presently within Conviction, there were in total thirty-six Level 5 or below twenty-player dungeons scattered across the Viridian Empire\u2019s domain. Their difficulties differed, but out of the thirty-six, six of these dungeons were particularly challenging. They even required teams to attain a certain amount of Honour before being allowed to enter. The rest of the dungeons had no such requirements.\u201cI\u2019m a thirty-seven magic damage Holy Mage! Looking for a team to enter Treant Forest with!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a thirty-five defense, one hundred seventy health, and sixty-seven attack Berserker! Looking for a team to enter Treant Forest with!\u201dThe entrance of the dungeon was bustling with activity. Many of the players gathered there were seeking teams. When they saw Nie Yan\u2019s group arriving, they ran towards him asking if there was any space.\u201cBoss, invite me to the team please.\u201d\u201cBrother, is your team lacking any members?\u201dBai Kaishui (Plain Boiled Water) walked forward to deal with the crowd. \u201cWe\u2019re full. Everyone, go look somewhere else please.\u201dUpon hearing Bai Kaishui\u2019s words, the surrounding players had no choice but to leave in low spirits.\u201cYou guys wait here. I\u2019m going to apply to enter the dungeon,\u201d Nie Yan announced and began walking over to the glowing monolith near the dungeon\u2019s entrance. When he neared it, he extended his hand and touched it whereupon he felt a bizarre sensation enter his mind.\u300c Before entering this lush forest, you happen upon a strange block of stone. The stone block is engraved with various eccentric writing, which read as follows: \u201cForest Walkers (Treants): they absorb dew under the light of the early morning sun. The sound of a caretaker\u2019s flute floats between the leaves. The tree spirits that have slumbered since the times of antiquity, awaken!\u201d You are reminded, an official from the Viridian Empire told you there were signs of activity from dark elves in this area. You mutter to yourself, \u201cThese damn dark elves! When will they stop?\u201d \u300d\u300c System: Do you wish to enter Treant Forest? \u300dYes!Nie Yan hit confirm.\u300c System: Please select a difficulty. (Easy, Normal, Hard, Expert, Specialist) \u300dSpecialist!\u300c System: Are you sure? \u300dYes!In the moment Nie Yan confirmed his selection, a brilliant light flashed through the eyes of each and every team member. When they regained their vision, they noticed they had emerged on a thick patch of grass within the forest. Although the sunlight was still able to penetrate through the foliage of the trees, the atmosphere surrounding the area still remained somewhat sinister and eerie.\u300c System: You have entered Treant Forest! (Difficulty: Specialist) \u300dThe other nineteen members of the team also received the same notification. Each and every one of them looked on in horror upon reading it.\u201cWhy is it Specialist difficulty?\u201d\u201cCaptain Nie Yan, did you pick the wrong difficulty! Why is it Specialist?\u201d\u201cYeah, how can we possibly clear Specialist difficulty?\u201d The surrounding team members were anxious and worried.Yu Lan looked over at Nie Yan and noticed his expression was still unperturbed. From what she knew of his personality, how could he possibly make such a rudimentary mistake? Unless... he intentionally chose this difficulty! If she recalled correctly, no one had ever cleared\u2014or more so, even dared to attempt\u2014Treant Forest on Specialist so far. Let alone Treant Forest, even the lowest level dungeons would become unreasonably difficult on Specialist difficulty,\u201cSince I brought you guys in, I naturally have a method to bring you out,\u201d Nie Yan calmly announced.\u201cWhat kind of bullshit are you spouting!? Up until now, there hasn\u2019t been a single team who\u2019s been able to clear Treant Forest on Specialist and you think we of all people can do it? Our team can\u2019t even clear this f*cking dungeon on Easy! Don\u2019t drag us into your mess just because you want to show off!\u201d Chen Bo ridiculed in an extremely irritated tone.\u201cIs this guy really your friend?\u201d Upon witnessing Chen Bo\u2019s rude outburst, Dusk who was by Nie Yan\u2019s side could no longer remain silent.\u201cNo, he\u2019s not.\u201d Nie Yan shook his head.\u201cIf a team member dared to speak so rudely to our captain in the team, he would\u2019ve been kicked by the captain long ago. No one would allow such a person to speak so much rubbish in the first place!\u201d Dusk sneered. However, he didn\u2019t look at Chen Bo. He didn\u2019t even bother acknowledging the existence his words were referencing to. He turned to face Nie Yan who was by his side, and said with a smile, \u201cI must say, Brother Nie is quite a tolerant person.\u201dFrom Dusk\u2019s perspective, Nie Yan chose the Specialist difficulty because he had the confidence to clear it. This run actually held some meaning to it now. Initially, he only came here to grind mobs to kill time. Who would have expected he\u2019d meet a rare opportunity instead.Chen Bo was infuriated, but what could he do? Dusk was invited to the run by Bai Kaishui, so offending him was the same as offending Bai Kaishui. If this were to occur, it would inevitably lead him to become ostracized on the team.\u201cChen Bo... Nie Yan is a friend I personally invited to the run. If you have any complaints regarding my decision, be upfront about it and tell me instead,\u201d Yao Yao sharply rebuked and knitted her brows. It was most likely for her sake that Nie Yan didn\u2019t bother with Chen Bo, or lower himself to Chen Bo\u2019s level. After all, Nie Yan didn\u2019t want Yao Yao to be shunned for inviting a friend who made trouble within their team. If she didn\u2019t speak out for Nie Yan now, it would be too much of a disgrace.\u201cYao Yao! It\u2019s not like that...\u201d Chen Bo hurriedly tried to explain when he saw Yao Yao was getting upset.However, Yao Yao coldly snorted and turned her head away.\u201cI\u2019m only someone who was invited to their team. I\u2019ll be leaving after we clear this run. Everyone else is simply cooperating with me. After all, I\u2019m not the captain of any team. The real team captain is this beauty over there,\u201d Nie Yan explained to Dusk and glanced at Yu Lan by his side. Truthfully, Nie Yan wasn\u2019t such a tolerant person. Chen Bo had already crossed the line and offended him long ago. Therefore Nie Yan would certainly teach him a proper lesson in the future. However, when handling a type of person like Chen Bo, Nie Yan would simply be degrading himself if he were to deal with him directly.\u201cYou\u2014\u201d\u201cChen Bo, shut your mouth right now! Otherwise, don\u2019t blame me for being impolite!\u201d Yu Lan scolded. She then apologized to Nie Yan. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. He just has this sort of unpleasant temper. I\u2019d like to apologize to Brother Nie Yan on his behalf.\u201dYu Lan also felt quite humiliated because of Chen Bo\u2019s behavior. She and Chen Bo had been classmates for over ten years. Their parents were on good terms with each other, so she couldn\u2019t afford to act too coldly towards Chen Bo.Chen Bo never thought even Yu Lan would speak up against him for the sake of these strangers. He stared daggers at Nie Yan and Dusk, then resentfully turned his head away.Dusk also felt bickering with Chen Bo would only be degrading himself, so he changed the topic. \u201cI assume Brother Nie Yan has already made the necessary preparations? Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t have selected Specialist difficulty.\u201d Since he was one of the people under Sleepy Fox\u2019s command, he also wanted to examine how much ability Nie Yan had.\u201cSpecialist isn\u2019t actually that difficult. The mob health is only increased by thirty percent. It\u2019s quite easy to handle if we have tanks with enough defense and Mages with high damage. However, the changes to the boss, Treant King, are quite distinct. I\u2019ll let you guys know about them when the times comes,\u201d Nie Yan reassured the rest of the team.Nie Yan had spoken as if the whole matter was trivial, but Dusk understood the true significance of mobs gaining thirty percent extra health. What did it mean? It meant if the tank fell short by even one percent of health, or lacked even a single point of defense, their team would be wiped. It meant if the Mages were lacking by even a single point of damage, their team would be wiped! Just where did Nie Yan\u2019s confidence come from?62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The expression in her eyes was filled with worry.\u201cRest assured, there won\u2019t be any problems.\u201dYao Yao\u2019s actions couldn\u2019t be considered excessively intimate; however, Chen Bo thought otherwise. He believed Nie Yan was stepping out of line by being too overly close with Yao Yao. As a consequence, the resentment and hatred in his eyes only grew all the more extreme as he covertly gazed at the two.The team of twenty slowly advanced deeper into the forest. The Warriors and Paladins were on the frontline, and the Mages were in the back. Under Nie Yan\u2019s repeated warnings, no players were more than two meters apart from each other.\u201cBrother Chen, how about you come in front and scout the path ahead?\u201d Nie Yan suggested. The corner of his eyes flashed with a cold, peculiar light. Chen Bo had a hypocritical and petty personality. Therefore, he would firmly hold onto a grudge if even the slightest enmity occurred between the two of them. By making him lose face, Nie Yan had already thoroughly offended him. Despite this, Nie Yan wasn\u2019t the slightest bit fearful. Chen Bo, you\u2019re just a useless brat who\u2019s barely capable of the simplest tasks. Do you really think you can stir up any trouble with me leading the team?\u201cYou\u2019re a Thief too! Why the hell are you making me go!?\u201d Chen Bo coldly replied.\u201cI\u2019m the team captain, so I have to lead the team. Would you rather have me scout ahead and have you lead the entire team instead, Brother Chen Bo ?\u201d Nie Yan countered.\u201cHmph, no need! I want to see how exactly you plan to lead us through this dungeon on Specialist difficulty!\u201d Chen Bo coldly snorted and walked to the front of the team. Utilizing his classes\u2019 nimbleness, he then began scouting the path ahead.From Chen Bo\u2019s movements, Nie Yan could tell he was barely decent for an average Thief. If Chen Bo ever tried to compare with him, he would find that Nie Yan was of an entirely different caliber.A cold breeze from the depths of the forest occasionally blew past, leaving the team with a strange sensation, almost as if they were being watched by some other entity. Nie Yan\u2019s mind was on constant alert. With his keen sense, he caught glimpses of shadows hiding in the distance. They were dark elves, experts of camouflage and hiding in the darkness to mount ambushes. They were impossible to perceive unless the player had an Awareness of above ten.Chen Bo moved forward and began scouting ahead for the rest of the team. On either side were thick branches with lush foliage which blocked his path. Beneath his feet were jungle vines and tree roots which resembled thick serpents as they lay strewn across the path ahead. They were tripping hazards and made advancing forward quite difficult.\u201cUgh! Damn these things to hell!\u201d Chen Bo tried kicking away one of the vines lying on the path. However, it seemed to have to mind of its own. As if it were an actual snake, the vine coiled around his legs, whipped upwards, and left him dangling in midair with his head facing the ground. \u201cSave me!\u201d Chen Bo miserably shrieked.\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92The towering tree beside him suddenly came alive, whereupon vines stretched as far as the eye could see. Chen Bo saw the tree grow a pair of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Even the vines surrounding the trunk grew into what seemed like a beard. Chen Bo had been caught off guard by a Treant!\u201cIt\u2019s a Treant! Bai Kaishui (Plain Boiled Water), Dumpling, attack from the right. Paladins, form a wall. Mages, start casting spells,\u201d Nie Yan calmly ordered. He had actually noticed the Treant in disguise earlier when Chen Bo was scouting the area. However, he intentionally chose not to warn Chen Bo in order to give him a good lesson. You impolite brat, I\u2019ll have this Treant teach you in my place.Dumpling rushed forward from the right side as he held a wooden shield in his hand. \u201cShield Bash!\u201d\u300cBang!\u300dA loud sound echoed out as the wooden shield collided with the Treant.The crowd of frontliners firmly stood in place, surrounding the monster, while the Mages in the back fired off volley after volley of spells. A shower of magic flew up into the air and went streaking towards the Treant.\u300cBoom! Boom! Boom!\u300dSeveral explosions rang out in quick succession as they bombarded their target. The Treant issued a painful roar whereupon it transformed into a lump of wood debris that lay collapsed on the ground. The one they encountered was merely an ordinary mob. Therefore, it was impossible for the Treant to withstand such a concentrated assault.The vine\u2019s grip on Chen Bo loosened and he was sent hurtling towards the ground.\u300cThud!\u300dHe fell flat on his face.Seeing his sorry figure, everyone on the team couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\u201cWhat did it drop?\u201d\u201cThree coppers.\u201dChen Bo felt embarrassed. He cast an angry gaze at Nie Yan and said, \u201cYou did that intentionally, didn\u2019t you!?\u201d He knew Nie Yan noticed the Treant earlier but still chose not to warn him. Otherwise, how could Nie Yan have reacted so calmly in such a sudden and urgent situation?\u201cBrother Morning Wood, you\u2019ll have to speak a bit more clearly. I\u2019m finding your reasoning a little strange. It was you who wasn\u2019t careful and ended up getting caught by the Treant. What does that have to do with me?\u201d Nie Yan gave a barely discernible smile as he gazed at Chen Bo, his expression telling otherwise. I did notice the Treant earlier, and I did intentionally not warn you. What can you do about it?\u201cYou\u2014\u201d\u201cChen Bo, stop causing trouble,\u201d Yu Lan interrupted. She was also unclear about whether Nie Yan had noticed the Treant earlier or not.\u201cPeh! I guess it\u2019s just my bad luck.\u201d Chen Bo spit out some of the dirt in his mouth. He turned around and continued moving forward.\u201cBrother Morning Wood , take care of what you step on.\u201d When Nie Yan spoke, he deliberately slowed down his speech as he watched Chen Bo accidentally step on a trap. The moment Chen Bo turned around to look at Nie Yan, a large wooden beam came swinging over and struck him in the stomach. Chen Bo was sent flying into the air.\u300cThud!\u300dHe once again fell flat on his face. Fortunately for him, Thieves had higher Reflex compared to other classes. Therefore, even if they stepped on a trap, they\u2019d receive much less damage compared to other classes. Despite this, the trap had still taken more than half of Chen Bo\u2019s health away. To add insult to injury, Nie Yan continued to taunt him. \u201cI did tell you to be careful, yet unfortunately... you still didn\u2019t listen to me. You\u2019re playing the Thief class. Don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know how to avoid traps? I really don\u2019t know how you could act as the team\u2019s Thief. A good Thief can increase a team\u2019s survival rate by over fifty percent, but with a Thief like you\u2014Ah, never mind. Forget it. I won\u2019t say any more. I don\u2019t want to hurt your pride or anything.\u201dIt was already bad enough that he had fallen for another trap. However, when Nie Yan deliberately taunted him in such a manner, Chen Bo looked as if he could spit fire as he stared daggers at Nie Yan.Nie Yan didn\u2019t care in the least how Chen Bo stared at him. He wasn\u2019t some sort of kind and benevolent person. As soon as he entered their team, Chen Bo had always been mocking and ridiculing him. If he still continued to tolerate such behavior without acting, his name wouldn\u2019t be Nie Yan.\u201cWhy are you still trying to show off if you\u2019re so unskilled? You got yourself in such a sorry state, and you\u2019re still trying to blame others?\u201d Tang Yao added in a mocking and drawn-out tone.\u201cYour equipment\u2019s wasted on you. We\u2019d probably find a better Thief than you by randomly pulling one off the streets.\u201d Dusk also joined in while standing by Nie Yan\u2019s side. Chen Bo\u2019s current reputation within the team wasn\u2019t great. At the moment, no one was willing to speak out and help him.\u201cNie Yan, you really didn\u2019t notice earlier?\u201d Yao Yao\u2019s beautiful face was full of doubt. Chen Bo stepping into another trap right after being caught by the Treant did seem like more than just a coincidence. However, when she looked back on those incidents, it still seemed that it was his own fault for being inattentive.\u201cWhat does his carelessness have to do with me?\u201d Nie Yan innocently replied.\u201cYou\u2019re just full of evil tricks, aren\u2019t you? No one can tell whether you purposefully baited him into those traps or not,\u201d Yao Yao teasingly whispered into Nie Yan\u2019s ear. The faint fragrance of her perfume paired with her soft and gentle voice left him feeling slightly refreshed.\u201cIf I were Captain Yu Lan, I wouldn\u2019t be so lenient in keeping such an unskilled Thief. I bet if I were to meet a hundred Thieves, ninety-nine of them wouldn\u2019t be as weak as you. Do you want me to teach you how to play this class?\u201d The provocative tone in Nie Yan\u2019s words was even clearer.If the opposite party was determined to make an enemy out of him, he\u2019d make sure to give them a few more kicks when he had them beneath his feet. Such was Nie Yan\u2019s true character.Nie Yan played with his dagger. His fingers were nimble as it twirled around his hand.\u201cMy teammate lacks ability. Please just see this incident as nothing more than a joke. Chen Bo stepping in those traps while scouting ahead was due to his own carelessness.\u201d As the team captain, Yu Lan also felt embarrassed when Chen Bo was ridiculed like so. Therefore she helped speak in his place.\u201cI guess it\u2019s up to me then. It seems this task is something Brother Morning Wood is unable to accomplish,\u201d Nie Yan announced. Since Yu Lan had spoken, it wouldn\u2019t be quite appropriate for him to continue taunting Chen Bo. Besides, the only person he couldn\u2019t bear was Chen Bo. He could get along fine with everyone else in Yu Lan\u2019s team.\u201cI\u2019ll have to trouble Brother Nie then,\u201d Yu Lan replied. The change in topic eased the tension in the atmosphere.Nie Yan rapidly inspected for traps as he scouted the path ahead. His eyes swept through the entire forest and he was extremely attentive as he examined every area where traps could potentially be placed. He noticed a peculiarly placed branch lying across the path ahead and instantly knew what it was upon examining it.He extended his hand and lightly tapped the branch before quickly taking a few steps back.\u300cWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u300dSeveral dozen arrows were set flying across his previous position.\u300cPut! Put! Put!\u300dA short moment later, all of the arrows could be seen embedded in a nearby tree.He had long since ducked out of their path, so these arrows were unable to harm him in any way.Nie Yan disarmed trap after trap as they travelled deeper into the forest. Yu Lan, Yao Yao, and Dusk could only see his figure continuously travelling back and forth between the trees. They were inwardly frightened by his astonishing efficiency in discovering and disarming traps. During this whole time, their team had never once stepped into another trap.Disarming traps was a Thief\u2019s responsibility because of the unique characteristics of the class. Moreover, the class also gained an additional bonus in the Reflex stat, which allowed them to have a fifty percent higher survival rate compared to other classes.Since Chen Bo was a Thief as well, he felt if he stayed idle with the rest of the team, he\u2019d be losing too much face when compared to Nie Yan. With no other choice, he forced himself to look busy and traveled through the forest while pretending to look for traps. Only now did he realize the disparity between himself and Nie Yan. However, he was unwilling to admit it due to his pride. He inwardly sneered and muttered sourly, \u201cHe\u2019s only good at playing a video game. What\u2019s so amazing about that?\u201d62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47 - Not All Men Are Created EqualPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 47 \u2013 Not All Men Are Created EqualThere were hidden dangers lurking everywhere within the forest such as the traps regularly encountered along the pathway. Chen Bo himself had narrowly escaped death by barely avoiding a fall into a spike pit. Fortunately, he was attentive enough to notice the pit before stepping in. Otherwise, he would have embarrassed himself further by dying to such a simple trap. After that incident, he changed his mind. He no longer went searching for traps along unexplored paths. Instead, he switched to areas Nie Yan had already scoured through and made himself look preoccupied, by pretending to search for any traps Nie Yan may have overlooked.Even after ten minutes, no further mishaps occurred to Chen Bo; not because he was more attentive, but because every trap had already been disarmed in the areas he passed through.Chen Bo pretended to examine a nearby area while he made his way over to a small clearing just ahead since he had just seen Nie Yan walk through it. As he arrived at the centre of the clearing, he noticed the ground beneath his feet was a little soft; however, he paid it no heed and negligently strode forward.\u300cCrash!\u300dThe ground trembled and a giant hole opened up underneath him, whereupon he fell into a pit of sludge. Chen Bo\u2019s entire body was covered in filth. Moreover, since this filth was a mix of toxic sludge and mud, he was inflicted with the poison status which caused him to lose two health per second. With a disgruntled expression, he raised his head to gauge how far of a distance he had fallen. The dirt walls surrounding him were roughly three meters in height. Since this pitfall was so deep, climbing out would require him to expend quite a bit of effort.Having walked over to the pitfall, Nie Yan stuck his head over the hole and said, \u201cAh? Brother Chen Bo , how did you manage to fall into another trap? Didn\u2019t I warn you earlier? As a Thief, you must always be wary of your surroundings. How could you just stride forward and step right into one again?\u201d\u201cYou bastard! I clearly saw you walking past this area without any problems! You intentionally set me up!\u201d Chen Bo angrily cursed. He might be an idiot but he still managed to figure out what had happened.\u201cYou stepped in there yourself. I never pushed you in, so how is it my fault? You were simply careless, that\u2019s all. I also have another piece of advice for you: Just because I passed through an area safely, it doesn\u2019t mean you will as well. Not all men are created equal.\u201d Nie Yan gazed at Chen Bo disdainfully before shaking his head. \u201cYou\u2019re too useless!\u201d Even before he reincarnated into the past, Nie Yan had long understood what type of personality Chen Bo possessed: petty, vindictive, and unable to tolerate any kind of offense. If he held a grudge towards someone, he would simply carry out that grudge to the bitter end. Since this was the case, whatever schemes he had planned in his head, Nie Yan was ready to receive them all!\u201cNie Yan, you son of a bitch, I\u2019ll remember this! F*ck your ancestors down to the eighteenth generation! I\u2019ll kick your ass if you\u2019ve got the guts to fight me!\u201d Chen Bo was foaming at the mouth with anger.\u201cYou\u2019d be useless in that aspect as well. Maybe you should bring a few people with you too; otherwise, it\u2019d be too boring.\u201d Nie Yan was unfazed by Chen Bo\u2019s outburst. He turned around and called out to Dumpling and his group. \u201cCome pull him up. We still need to continue the run.\u201dAs Dusk, Tang Yao, and the others glanced over, they felt Nie Yan had tormented Chen Bo into quite a miserable state.\u300c System: Player Chen Bo has withdrawn from the team. \u300dChen Bo felt too embarrassed to stay any longer, so he gave himself an out by leaving the team.\u201cGood! Since that annoying fellow has left, let\u2019s continue with the run. We\u2019re better off without him anyway.\u201d Nie Yan felt Chen Bo acted rather tactful by leaving when he knew he was unwelcome.\u201cAren\u2019t you going a little too far?\u201d Yu Lan said while knitting her brows. Although she somewhat loathed Chen Bo as well, he was still a member of her team. She felt rather displeased when Nie Yan drove him away.\u201cYou all saw what happened earlier as well. I wasn\u2019t the one who had him foolishly walk into a slumbering Treant, nor was I the one who made him carelessly walk into traps. His actions were his own, and their consequences were due to his incompetence. I barely said more than a few sentences to him before he quit in a fit of anger. You really can\u2019t blame those things on me, can you?\u201d Nie Yan turned to face Yao Yao and innocently asked, \u201cAm I in the wrong here?\u201dSeeing Nie Yan\u2019s appearance, Yao Yao was already on the verge of bursting into laughter. This guy had already got what he wanted, but he still wanted to act as if he was being wronged.\u201cBig Sister, Chen Bo\u2019s attitude earlier was quite bad as well. Even if Nie Yan was a little excessive, all of the mishaps that occurred during this run really was due to Chen Bo\u2019s own carelessness. Besides, he shouldn\u2019t have been shirking off his own duties and pushing them onto Nie Yan.\u201d Yao Yao didn\u2019t have a favourable impression of Chen Bo either. Therefore, she spoke on Nie Yan\u2019s behalf as soon as she opened her mouth.\u201cAh, never mind. Let\u2019s focus on the dungeon run first. We\u2019ll discuss this after the run,\u201d Yu Lan said, shaking her head.\u201cIn any case, my cooperation with your team ends after this run. As long as Chen Bo remains on your team, even if you invite me to another run, I won\u2019t come. As they say, what the eye doesn\u2019t see, the heart won\u2019t grieve over. Since these circumstances will never occur again, you no longer have a reason to get upset further. It will have nothing to do with your team even if he comes to me looking for trouble in the future,\u201d Nie Yan added. Were it not for Yao Yao\u2019s invitation, he would have never considered running a dungeon with Yu Lan\u2019s team. Chen Bo was too much of an eyesore; so what if he drove him away? Even Buddha could be angered to some degree. He\u2019d have been a weakling with no backbone if he let Chen Bo walk all over him like that.\u201cNie Yan, I\u2019m really sorry...\u201d Yao Yao said apologetically. Nie Yan had suffered because of her invitation.Yao Yao really was too much of a sweetheart. This incident had been Chen Bo\u2019s fault, yet she still directed the blame towards herself.\u201cIt isn\u2019t your fault. I\u2019m just that sort of a person. If there\u2019s someone I\u2019m not on good terms with, I\u2019ll keep looking for trouble. I\u2019ve already gotten used to being a solo player and staying as one is fine too. If I enter a team, who knows what sort of restrictions they\u2019ll put on me. In the future, it\u2019ll be fine and dandy to just make my own team if I want to run a dungeon.\u201d Nie Yan laughed in a carefree manner.\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92He had played down the incident and skirted around the issue. From Yao Yao\u2019s perspective, Nie Yan appeared quite easy-going and unworried. Her impression of him somewhat changed once again.\u201cRight! After some time, we\u2019ll find our own people to make a team with!\u201d Tang Yao enthusiastically added.Nie Yan believed if he were going to invite people to create a team, at the very minimum, the members needed to be super experts if they wanted to join.\u201cIf you guys make your own team, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t join you,\u201d Yao Yao apologetically said. She was already in a fixed team. Although she loathed Chen Bo, Yu Lan was in the team as well. She would never betray Yu Lan to join another person\u2019s team, even if it was Nie Yan\u2019s.\u201cHaha! Don\u2019t worry. I already know. Alright everyone, let\u2019s switch our focus back to the dungeon run. Let\u2019s not give Brother Chen Bo something to mock at by getting wiped during the run,\u201d Nie Yan smiled and said.\u201cBrother Nie, well done,\u201d Dusk said with a smile. He felt Nie Yan was quite an interesting person....Deeper within the eerie forest near an opening between the trees, a community of Treants were sauntering around, blocking the path ahead. Nie Yan drew closer to these enemies and counted their numbers\u2014eighteen Treants in total. They possessed thirty percent more health than their Normal difficulty counterparts and gained noticeable bonuses in stats as well. Furthermore, there was also Bind\u2014a crowd control skill\u2014and Lash\u2014a skill that increased their damage\u2014to be wary of. Their team could only handle three Treants at once. Any more, and things could get a little dangerous. If they were unlucky enough to encounter more than five at once, they were guaranteed to be wiped. Since the game was still new, most Priests still didn\u2019t have a healing or resurrection skill. In fact, the main purpose of coming to Treant Forest for most teams was to get a hold of a Lesser Heal skill book.\u201cThere\u2019s eighteen of them up ahead. I want you guys to stay where you are for now,\u201d Nie Yan ordered. He examined the terrain of the nearby area and began to formulate a plan.\u201cThere\u2019s no way we can deal with so many Treants,\u201d Yu Lan said. Frankly, the moment she found out they had entered this dungeon on Specialist difficulty, she had already begun feeling a little restless. If they were wiped again, several of their members were going to drop a level, and climbing back to their previous levels would take quite a long time.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not stupid enough to have you guys deal with so many of them at once.\u201d Nie Yan began gauging their distance. The nearest Treants were roughly ten meters away. He raised his head and surveyed the forest canopy. It was quite fortunate that there was a tall tree right next to him, and there was a branch that could support a person. He could get a better vantage point from a higher elevation. As he extended his hand, he shot out a line of webbing from his Silk Spinner Ring, which adhered to the thick branch of the tree above. After making sure the line was secure, he nimbly scaled the tree.\u201cWhat is he going to do?\u201d Yao Yao asked puzzledly as she looked to her side at Yu Lan and the others.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48 - Godly AbilityPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 48 \u2013 Godly Ability\u201cBrother Nie has impressive perception. He was actually able to find such a good vantage point!\u201d Dusk exclaimed in admiration. He was much more knowledgeable compared to Yu Lan (Blue Feather), Bai Kaishui (Plain Boiled Water), and the others. Naturally, this was because he frequently followed his captain, Sleepy Fox, into difficult dungeons. How could he not be knowledgeable regarding dungeon specific techniques?\u201cHey, tell us. What\u2019s he planning to do?\u201d Yu Lan asked. Although she held the position of team captain, she was only the captain of a run-of-the-mill team. Therefore, she and her team weren\u2019t proficient in aspects such as dungeoneering, otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have been wiped out in this dungeon on Easy difficulty.\u201cWhen running dungeons, there\u2019s always one person assigned a certain designated task. That task is to find a suitable position to attack certain monsters within a large group. Optimally, that person should aggro one or two monsters over to the team without alerting the other monsters in the group. Using such methods, teams can break down large crowds of mobs into more manageable sizes. Generally, this job is assigned to the Thief who uses a crossbow to carry it out. Presumably, you should all know these things by now. Those eighteen Treants just ahead are quite close to each other. The moment one of them is aggroed, many others will follow in tow. This difference in mob density is likely also one of the key differences in running a Specialist dungeon. Even the minor obstacles are this difficult to deal with. Earlier, I had surveyed the area but was unable to find a suitable position to start. It wasn\u2019t until I saw Brother Nie Yan scale the tree that I realised I was mistaken in my judgement. His current location is the most optimal for luring mobs. If one didn\u2019t have exceptional perception, they would be hard-pressed to find such a great spot! If we had such a Thief in our team, our survival rate would increase by at least thirty percent or higher,\u201d Dusk explained. He was not in the least bit shy in expressing his praise and admiration for Nie Yan\u2019s skills.Yu Lan remained taciturn. Initially, she believed herself quite capable, for being able to properly manage a team. However, it appeared that notion was simply due to her lack of experience.When Yao Yao gazed at Nie Yan standing at the top of the branch, her eyes shone with a peculiar splendour. Nie Yan\u2019s position within her mind had once again been elevated a few steps. Other than her senior sister, Yu Lan, there was no other person she admired more.\u201cHowever, finding a suitable position is one thing... actually luring the monsters without attracting the rest of the group is another. The latter is a test of a Thief\u2019s perception and reaction. If he\u2019s even a little off in the timing or hitting of his target, worst case scenario, he\u2019ll aggro the whole group towards us and cause us to be wiped. Even the most elite Thieves have lapses in judgement and make mistakes,\u201d Dusk gazed at Nie Yan and said in a nervous tone.While standing on top of the branch, Nie Yan sheathed his dagger and wore it on his waist. He promptly retrieved his crossbow from his bag and propped it up on his shoulder. As he observed the Treants\u2019 movements through the sight, his forehead dripped with a bead of sweat. The pressure and nervousness in his mind reached its apex. At this moment, the lives of all nineteen members of his team would be decided by his hands!As the tension in the atmosphere increased, Nie Yan gradually tuned out the distractions around him until what remained was only the crossbow in his hand and the target through his sight.Even after the seconds ticked into minutes he patiently awaited his opportunity to strike.Most of these Treants stood idle. Occasionally, one or two of them would uproot themselves and roam about. However, they consistently remained within two meters of each other. The close proximity put him in an extremely risky situation. A single badly timed shot could cause a chain of aggro that would lead the entire group to his team.Below Nie Yan were eighteen other players watching his every movement attentively. Earlier, they had been ignorant of the severity of their situation. It wasn\u2019t until Dusk\u2019s explanation that they realised their lives were held in Nie Yan\u2019s hands. Since this dungeon was a sealed space, they would have nowhere to run to if those Treants came lumbering over after discovering their presence.With the crossbow propped on his shoulder, Nie Yan remained motionless atop the tree branch almost as if he were a statue.Time seemed to have stood still.Through the crossbow sight, Nie Yan\u2019s eyes focused on several Treants in the distance.Periodically, a gust of wind blew past the trees causing the leaves to fall and flutter as if they were butterflies.Nie Yan glanced at the fallen leaves floating in the wind. Wind speed, medium...He abruptly pulled the trigger. The crossbow recoiled acutely after the first bolt fired. Before the second bolt flew out, he sharply shifted the crossbow in another direction.\u300cWoosh! Woosh! Woosh!\u300dThree bolts fired from the crossbow. As these bolts flew through the air, they surprisingly weren\u2019t shot out in a single line but in three separate directions.\u201cWe\u2019re done for... Brother Nie\u2019s hands were unsteady when he fired!\u201d Dusk called out in alarm. When firing a crossbow, the user shouldn\u2019t be nervous and absolutely shouldn\u2019t have shaky hands. Otherwise, a single slip-up could cost the lives of the entire team.No matter what class they were, the shooter must first have a calm and steady mind because a single shot could decide the fate of their comrades. Under this kind of intense mental pressure, even an experienced expert could have a lapse in judgement due to nervousness. Consequently, such a lapse in judgement guaranteed death of the entire team.It seems Brother Nie couldn\u2019t handle the pressure ...Every member of the team felt their hearts sink upon hearing Dusk\u2019s words.\u201cBai Kaishui, prepare to hold position [289.288.212] !\u201d After firing the crossbow, Nie Yan didn\u2019t bother watching to see if the three bolts were on target. He leapt off the tree branch onto the ground and began running towards the team.Dusk and the rest of the team looked over in the area where the bolts were fired.\u300cPut! Put! Put!\u300dThe first bolt passed in between the Treants and struck a tree further in the back while the second bolt struck a sapling in the west. Despite both bolts missing their supposed targets, the noise from the bolts striking bark alerted the nearby Treants and over ten of them moved towards the two points to investigate the sources of the noise.The remaining bolt struck the Treant nearest to the team and alerted a companion as well, whereupon the two Treants began lumbering over to Nie Yan.These two Treants quickly separated from their group as they chased Nie Yan from behind.He managed to lure two of them without aggroing the others!\u201cHoly shit, that was amazing!\u201d Dusk exclaimed in surprise. The others might have not clearly seen what had happened but how could he not? The crossbow in Nie Yan\u2019s hand was a type of semi-automatic crossbow that fired in three-bolt bursts. The three bolts were fired in different directions. The first two bolts had drawn most of the Treants away while the last bolt drew two Treants towards the team. He had been mistaken earlier in believing Nie Yan had unsteady hands when firing the crossbow. Rather, it was actually Nie Yan quickly changing directions to fire at different targets! He had only heard about this kind of highly-advanced skill in rumours!Even with the same crossbow, if it were another person firing, the outcome would likely be vastly different!Dusk had been secretly recording during this entire run. Although this type of video couldn\u2019t be publically viewed online if it was recorded without the consent of the person in the video, it could still be shared privately with friends. He would definitely show this clip to his captain, Sleepy Fox.A true top-class Thief!This method of drawing aggro was an innovation in dungeoneering! If publically disseminated, it would certainly become textbook among Thieves!\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92Two Treants were nothing difficult. Since Bai Kaishui had already gotten into position, he easily intercepted one of the incoming Treants while Nie Yan used Concussive Blow on its companion. The rest of the frontliners arrived to surround the Treants and the Mages began casting their magic.\u300cBoom! Boom! Boom!\u300dA rain of spells exploded over the Treant\u2019s bodies.One of the Treants swept its arm out repelling most of the frontliners away. However, Bai Kaishui held his position, refusing to retreat. He loudly roared and struck the Treant using Shield Bash.\u201cThe key to being a successful Fighter isn\u2019t necessarily the ability to be aggressive. It\u2019s the ability to be firm and stable. It doesn\u2019t matter what situation, you mustn\u2019t create any openings that could lead to a break in the ranks,\u201d Nie Yan frankly advised, after seeing Bai Kaishui\u2019s action. Although Nie Yan believed Bai Kaishui was a decent player, he was still far from being an expert in Nie Yan\u2019s eyes.In reality, before he reincarnated, those who were stronger than him could be found everywhere. It was just that everyone, in the present, was simply new to the game. The players were still gradually familiarising themselves with the combat and different skills and techniques in the game. However, Nie Yan was different. He had over ten years of experience in the game as a Thief and was already quite familiar with the various aspects of the game. The saying goes, \u201cPractice makes perfect,\u201d and Nie Yan, with his ten years of gameplay knowledge, had already far exceeded any current player in the game. The techniques he used now that would cause others to exclaim in admiration would be standard ten years later. There were still a few genuinely difficult techniques that even he wasn\u2019t able to grasp. Those were the true highly-advanced techniques!Bai Kaishui tuned down his aggression after listening to Nie Yan\u2019s advice. When they first met, he wasn\u2019t particularly impressed with Nie Yan\u2019s ability. However, after witnessing Nie Yan\u2019s display of skill just a moment ago, he became thoroughly convinced even if he wasn\u2019t able to see it clearly. Since Nie Yan was elevated to the status of a super expert in his mind, he would firmly believe in any advice that he was given by Nie Yan.After focusing more on defense, even though the Treant\u2019s attacks were fierce, he found it easier to hold his ground. He stood more stably and the pressure he felt had immediately lessened.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 - Insane Levelling SpeedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 49 \u2013 Insane Levelling SpeedAfter all was said and done, Nie Yan had knowledge of the next ten years of gameplay, events, and updates. Just a few words from him to Bai Kaishui (Plain Boiled Water) would allow the latter to reap endless benefits.Another wave of spells struck the Treants. After the third wave, the first Treant collapsed and exploded into a pile of wood debris. Ten seconds later, the second Treant collapsed as well.Nie Yan walked over their corpses and rummaged through the wood pile. He found a few coppers and a pair of Bronze-grade Mage gloves with Focus +2.\u201cA pair of Mage gloves dropped. Decide who should have it among yourselves,\u201d Nie Yan said and threw the gloves over to Yu Lan (Blue Feather).Naturally, Tang Yao and Dusk declined as they had no use for such gloves. Even though the Bronze-grade gloves were decent, it was still inferior to their set equipment.In the end, the player named Pirate had the winning bid and received the pair of gloves for twelve copper. The money from his bid was then evenly split among the other team members. In this fashion, players could obtain equipment inexpensively rather than paying higher prices in the marketplace.\u201cNie Yan, that move earlier was amazing! How did you pull it off? You should teach me next time!\u201d Yao Yao (Dark Mystery) exclaimed excitedly, since crossbow techniques similarly applied to magic as well. She was considered an expert amongst her friends but in reality, she felt there was quite a large gap between herself and the true experts like Nie Yan.Nie Yan replied with a faint smile and said, \u201cSure. Actually, it\u2019s not really that difficult. I\u2019ll tell you later when we get out of the dungeon.\u201d After he finished speaking, he walked back to his prior position so they could continue the run. Nie Yan lured the Treants over one after the other. Sometimes, only one lumbered over; other times, they brought one or two companions with them. However, there were never more than three Treants at once. Since they ran the dungeon on Specialist difficulty, the drop rate was increased by over five hundred percent. Moreover, the type of equipment dropped was of a much higher quality. When all eighteen Treants were killed, the team obtained two more pieces of Bronze-grade equipment with decent properties and one piece of Silver-grade equipment.When Yu Lan and her team ran this dungeon on Easy, they obtained no more than five pieces of Bronze-grade equipment per run. The properties of the equipment they picked up weren\u2019t spectacular either. Yet, at present, the value of their recently dropped equipment far surpassed the profits of an entire run for them on Easy. Moreover, this was still the beginning of the dungeon! Such a fact put the members of the team in higher spirits.\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92\u201cThe profits from running a Specialist dungeon are staggering!\u201d Dusk exclaimed. He felt the current drop rate was unimaginable.\u201cThis is only the beginning,\u201d Nie Yan replied. From his experience, these profits were simply a drop in the bucket. The total amount earned in a Specialist run was much more.\u201cThe path splits up ahead,\u201d Dusk called out. Everyone cast their gaze forward. The path between the forest thickets forked into two different directions.\u201cWe\u2019ll head west,\u201d Nie Yan replied.\u201cAren\u2019t we supposed to go east?\u201d Dusk asked in surprise. He and Sleepy Fox always went east when running this dungeon because the path to the west was a dead end. Regardless of the selected difficulty, the map for the Treant Forest always stayed the same.\u201cYou won\u2019t go wrong by listening to my instructions. While it\u2019s true the west path leads to a dead end, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s odd for the path to exist for no reason? In fact, that area actually contains something very special! However, we\u2019ll have to be a little more cautious. Many Treants lurk on the path ahead, making it quite dangerous,\u201d Nie Yan replied. The secret to the dead end was hidden quite deeply. Very few people were able to discover it. If it weren\u2019t for the information from his past life, he might have missed out on a great opportunity.Everyone followed Nie Yan and took the west path. While on the path, they encountered many Treants roaming around. Sometimes, the Treants even charged towards the team. However, thanks to Nie Yan\u2019s reminders, they were able to prepare in advance.\u201cSmothering Strike!\u201d Nie Yan struck a Treant from behind and stunned it. He then turned around to attack another one nearby.Bai Kaishui and the rest of the frontliners rushed up to take aggro while the Mages followed in tow.\u300cBoom! Boom! Boom!\u300dA volley of spells bombarded the two Treants....The two Treants finally collapsed to the ground.From their corpses, they found three coppers and a single skill book.Skill Book: Uncanny Dodge (Passive)Description: Increases the player\u2019s senses and ability to evade attacks.Properties: Evasion +2, Awareness +1Restrictions: Thief, Warrior, Paladin; can be learned by any faction.\u201cSince it\u2019s a skill book I can learn, I\u2019ll be taking it,\u201d Nie Yan said to the team. The skill book was quite rare. Even its drop rate on Specialist was very low.The skill could be learned by Thieves, Warriors, and Paladins. If he were to put it up for auction, it could sell for at least two silvers. Furthermore, at present, it was a skill book that had yet to appear on the marketplace. If such a skill book appeared in a run beside theirs, that team\u2019s members would certainly fight or even become enemies over it.However, Nie Yan directly took it without any opposition. Although many members drooled over the skill book, no one dared to say anything since they had already accepted Nie Yan\u2019s conditions before setting out. Besides, without him, let alone obtaining such a good item, they wouldn\u2019t even be able to take one step forward in this Specialist dungeon.Each class had a maximum of fifty skill slots. For an average Thief to fill even twenty-five of those slots was an accomplishment. Most players were able to comfortably get by with around ten active skills. Players able to attain more than twenty active skills were in the top ranks among the player base. Therefore, the majority of players had their skill bars padded with passive skills.Some skills could be improved as time went on; however, those were few and far between. The bulk of skills obtained by players generally couldn\u2019t be improved. Skills could also be forgotten to free up space in the skill bar. Therefore, once some lower level skills outlived their use, they could be replaced with higher level ones.Uncanny Dodge was classified as one of the skills that couldn\u2019t be improved.Nie Yan glanced at his character page after learning the skill. His Evasion and Awareness had increased. The stat bonuses from passive skills were permanent. He felt passive skills were much better because the stat bonuses from equipment would disappear once the gear was unequipped....The team had walked half-way through the path\u2014just enough to see the edge of the forest. They could hear the gentle melody of a flute as the sound drifted between the leaves and floated into their ears. The clear melody moved the hearts of the members in the team.\u201cThere\u2019s a delirious old man who speaks nothing but gibberish at the end of the forest. No matter how we inquired or interacted with him, he wouldn\u2019t give us any sort of quest. Since we could beat the Treant King regardless and the old man didn\u2019t seem to do anything, we figured he was just a useless NPC. Don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s actually part of a quest line or something?\u201d Dusk asked and turned to face Nie Yan. He didn\u2019t know whether Nie Yan had any thoughts on this old man.\u201cThere\u2019s never an NPC who appears in a dungeon without reason. They have a ninety percent chance of being related to the main storyline,\u201d Nie Yan replied before continuing on the path.Dusk looked on in confusion. Could Nie Yan have found some clues regarding this old man? In any case, he feared this attempt would be futile as well.Nie Yan had read over detailed guides for every dungeon in the game. Moreover, he himself had personally experienced ninety-nine percent of these dungeons. The matter of the senile old man was an easy case for him to solve.\u201cNie Yan, have you been through this dungeon before?\u201d Yao Yao asked. She was quite curious. Why did he seem to know everything about this dungeon?\u201cI\u2019ve run this dungeon with a team before,\u201d Nie Yan replied with a nod.\u201cOn Specialist as well?\u201d\u201cNope, only on Normal difficulty.\u201d\u201cWhy were you so confident in entering the dungeon on Specialist then?\u201d\u201cLike I said before, Specialist isn\u2019t actually that hard. You simply need to have enough skill and if you understand the dungeon well enough, passing it on Specialist won\u2019t be difficult at all,\u201d Nie Yan replied.When Nie Yan spoke in a confident and certain tone, it almost seemed as if every matter that appeared before him could be easily resolved. Yao Yao quietly gazed at Nie Yan. The outline of his face, as well as his overall appearance, still looked somewhat childish; a little bit of stubble had barely grown out of his chin. He wasn\u2019t particularly handsome but he had a peculiar personality that made her subconsciously feel she could trust and rely on him.As Yao Yao stared longer than what was considered polite, a thought suddenly emerged into her mind and she quickly turned away. A faint tinge of red could be seen on her elegant face.\u201cYao Yao, how did you meet him again?\u201d Yu Lan asked as she stood right beside Yao Yao. She also became quite interested in Nie Yan. The game servers had barely opened a week ago, so such a strong player was a rare sight.\u201cRemember when I was killing Water Spiders in Lake Rando? He was the one who saved me that day. If it weren\u2019t for him, I\u2019m afraid I would be a level lower right now,\u201d Yao Yao replied. She shuddered at the thought of losing one level. Actually, she didn\u2019t know how she got into such a mess in the first place but she had found herself being surrounded by six Water Spiders. She managed to kill three of them after using up two scrolls and a Basic Health Potion. However, the remaining three nearly ended her life.Yu Lan couldn\u2019t help thinking Yao Yao was extremely lucky to have met Nie Yan back then. Even if you searched every nook and cranny, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily find someone as skilled as him....Along the path, the team had killed another Treant and a jingling sound rang out. A white light then surrounded Nie Yan\u2019s body.\u201cI levelled up,\u201d Nie Yan said and glanced at his character page. He had finally reached Level 4.\u201cCongratulations.\u201d\u201cCongratulations,\u201d the team members applauded one after the other.\u201cNie Yan, you levelled up already? How are you so quick!?\u201d Tang Yao exclaimed in surprise. Just yesterday, he was almost fifty percent ahead of Nie Yan in experience! How did Nie Yan suddenly get so far ahead of him in only one day!?62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It gave some fairly decent experience, so my level rose by quite a bit.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of quest gives so much experience at once? Tell me, where is it? I want to try it too!\u201d\u201cIt was a unique quest.\u201d\u201cAh, so it was a unique quest. Oh well, forget it then,\u201d Tang Yao replied in a disappointed manner. Unique quests were generally quite hard to trigger. Though their difficulties varied, the rewards for these quests were always extremely generous.\u201cNie Yan, you\u2019re already Level 4?\u201d Yao Yao exclaimed in shock. Nie Yan was only Level 2 when she first encountered him, yet he reached Level 4 after only two days? Wasn\u2019t this levelling speed a bit too monstrous?\u201cMhmm.\u201d Nie Yan nodded.Even more shocked to hear this news was Dusk. He had heard from Flying Stone three days prior that Nie Yan had only been Level 0 when they first met. Barely several days have passed and he\u2019s already Level 4. No wonder he dared to start all over again... It\u2019s because he had the confidence to rise up. That\u2019s why he dared to delete his old Warrior character!\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92This guy is impressive! And not the average kind of impressive either! Dusk said to himself.Several days ago, Nie Yan didn\u2019t put much thought into his explanation for Stone. He made up a story by telling Stone he simply deleted his old account and was restarting. After all, it was an easy explanation for why he knew so much about the dungeons.Finally... Level 4. Nie Yan glanced at his experience bar. Currently, the highest level player in the game had only reached Level 6. Even groups like Sleepy Fox and his team averaged around Level 5. If he kept going at his current pace, he was certain to overtake them; it was only a matter of time.As the team neared the edge of the forest, the members could see a distant cliff face ahead. Trees, shrubs, and flowers, along with other various plants flourished and grew vigorously on its near vertical incline. Presumably, this steep rock face was the end of the west path.In addition to the cliff face, the team caught sight of a lone NPC at the edge of the forest\u2014an elderly man in a shabby looking cap. He sat beside a nearby tree with his back supported by the trunk, absorbed in playing the flute he held in his hands. The song was dreary and distant, as if its melody had drifted through the forest since antiquity.Nie Yan examined the old man. The name displayed above his head read \u201cNameless Old Man,\u201d but Nie Yan knew this NPC\u2019s actual name: Einpat the Treant Caretaker. He was this forest\u2019s protector. Under his supervision, humans and Treants coexisted peacefully. However, around a month ago, the Treants suddenly went out of control and began slaughtering any humans that entered the forest. When traces of dark elf activity were discovered in the area, the Viridian Empire\u2019s council of elders issued a statement. They called for the brave adventurers of the empire to enter the forest and kill the most dangerous being inside\u2014the Treant King. This was where the main storyline of the Treant Forest dungeon begun.\u201cAdventurers, you have travelled a long way but please turn back now. This area is very dangerous. The Treants will kill anyone who enters the forest, so please hurriedly depart. When night descends, beneath the light of the moon, they gain a strange demonic power that increases their strength immensely.\u201d The Nameless Old Man stopped playing his flute upon seeing Nie Yan approach and advised him to turn back.\u201cRespected Caretaker Einpat, it\u2019s an honour to grace your presence. We\u2019ve come here in order to exterminate the evil Treant King. While these Treants have gone berserk, it is my hope that God will allow them to be saved,\u201d Nie Yan replied in a sincere and righteous manner.\u201cDamn those wretched beings from the underground! They should receive divine judgement! They stole my flute and hid it somewhere while snickering in the shadows!\u201d Caretaker Einpat furiously exclaimed.\u300c This! Right here! It\u2019s clearly a prompt for a quest but this old guy never gave it to us. No matter how we talked to him after, the old coot would only tell us to hurriedly leave. After that, we didn\u2019t bother with him anymore and went straight to killing the Treant King, \u300dDusk said in the team chat.\u300c That\u2019s because you guys ran this dungeon on Hard difficulty. If we don\u2019t trigger this NPC\u2019s dialogue in Specialist difficulty, we\u2019d have no way to beat the Treant King. The boss on Specialist is much more difficult than its counterpart on Hard, \u300dNie Yan replied. He then glanced at the shadows in the distance before turning his head and continuing his conversation with Einpat. \u201cIt is them. I immediately discovered their presence the moment I entered the forest. May the radiance of light purify these wretched demons.\u201d\u201cAdventurer, you can actually detect their presence? Good! If not for those two damned dark elves snatching my flute, the Treants wouldn\u2019t have gone berserk. Here, I personally created this Disillusioning Powder. It can reveal their true appearances and prevent them from escaping into the shadows again. Please, kill them and retrieve my flute, then you\u2019ll be able to defeat the Treant King.\u201d Caretaker Einpat rejoiced in surprise.\u300c System: You\u2019ve obtained Disillusioning Powder. Quantity: 3 \u300dDisillusioning Powder: Reveals all hidden players and monsters within a thirty meter radius for twenty seconds.After receiving the powder, Nie Yan glanced at the distant shadows once more. Along with Transcendent Insight, his Awareness far exceeded other Thieves of the same level. Therefore, he was able to keenly sense the malicious entities stalking the shadows ever since he and his team entered the dungeon.Out of everyone in the team, only Nie Yan had managed to notice the presence of those two dark elves.\u201cYou... received the quest?\u201d Dusk asked blankly. Prior to this, he, Sleepy Fox, and their team had tried numerous methods but were unable to retrieve even a single clue from this old man. He never expected it would be so simple to receive the quest while under Nie Yan\u2019s lead.\u201cYeah, let\u2019s keep moving. We\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do,\u201d Nie Yan replied.\u201cReally? Was there really something following us?\u201d Yao Yao followed Nie Yan\u2019s gaze. Besides the shadows, there was absolutely nothing there. She suddenly felt a deep chill run down her spine.\u201cJust a bunch of frail dark elves. There\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201dNie Yan then began strutting towards the darker areas in the forest.With eighteen others following from behind, Nie Yan led the team out of the opening where the elderly NPC resided. He took them through a long and narrow path between the trees and brought them to the cliff face. At the base of the cliff, everyone could see a dense blanket of green covering the entire rock face where all sorts of vegetation grew.\u201cWhy did we come here?\u201d Tang Yao asked.It wasn\u2019t just Tang Yao, everyone else also felt puzzled as to why Nie Yan led them here.Nie Yan glanced upward at the cliff face above them and said, \u201cWe came here to look for an opportunity to catch those two dark elves... Hold on, I think I saw something over on that side.\u201d Nie Yan walked alongside the wall and jumped. He leapt three meters into the air before clinging onto the vegetation on the cliff face. He then shot a web line at a shrub three meters above him. Resembling a nimble monkey, he climbed higher and higher by grabbing onto nearby protruding rocks.\u201cGuys, look over there!\u201d Yao Yao pointed above.Everyone looked in the direction Yao Yao pointed. Only then did they discover a faintly shimmering object slightly sticking out on the cliff face. From its appearance, it was likely a treasure chest and a silver one at that. There was actually a chest so well hidden in this area. If it weren\u2019t for Nie Yan, they would have never discovered it!The real reason Nie Yan brought everyone here was solely for the sake of this chest as it only appeared in the Specialist version of this dungeon. Thus, in order not to arouse the team\u2019s suspicions, he acted as if he were looking for the dark elves.Nie Yan reached over and found the chest embedded deeply inside the crack on the cliff face. He didn\u2019t know who discovered this chest first, but the person who discovered it was surely an expert. After all, it was nearly impossible to notice such a well-hidden chest unless the player possessed exceptional observational ability. Even without his exceptional eyesight, this location could be found on the guides in his past life. Be it hidden chests, items, or information regarding their respective dungeons, they were all written down. The knowledge came from the experiences of the high-level experts before him. When these experts reached a higher level, they would write down this information and sell it to online publications for a hefty sum. Nie Yan had always looked at these guides and thoroughly researched them before actually entering a dungeon with a team. This aided him greatly in avoiding disastrous mistakes and taking the wrong paths.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51 - Dark ElvesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 51 \u2013 Dark ElvesThis chest wasn\u2019t locked so Nie Yan stretched out his arm and opened it.\u300c System: Opening chest... Estimated Completion: 37%... 53%... \u300d\u300cClick!\u300dThe treasure chest\u2019s lid popped open. Nie Yan reached in and dug around. For the most part, items found inside dungeon chests were generated randomly, so anything could appear. Now it was all just a matter of luck.After digging around for what seemed like half a day, Nie Yan picked up a skill book and a necklace from the chest.Ah! It\u2019s an accessory. Guess my luck isn\u2019t too bad. Nie Yan felt pleasantly surprised. Accessories such as rings, necklaces, and medallions were the rarest type of equipment players could receive. Since they were so difficult to find, they fetched a high price on the marketplace and most players could only leave their accessory slots empty.Forest NecklaceProperties: UnidentifiedNie Yan appraised the item using Transcendent Insight.Forest Necklace (Silver)Requirements: Level 0Properties: Defense 2\u20133, Dexterity +2, Awareness +1Weight: 1 lbRestrictions: NoneWhat a good accessory! It\u2019s a Silver-grade necklace! Nie Yan felt quite elated. He then turned to look at the skill book. It\u2019s a Lesser Heal skill book! The Lesser Heal skill was the lowest level healing skill of the Priest class. However, it was difficult to acquire since its skill book could only be found within dungeons. This was also one of the reasons its market price remained so high, to the extent it was even more valuable than some Silver-grade equipment. Having received the Forest Necklace, Nie Yan didn\u2019t mind too much about losing the Lesser Heal skill book. If he were to place it up for auction, he\u2019d only receive around three silver. Such an insignificant sum wasn\u2019t worth batting his eye over.Nie Yan descended the cliff and met up with the team.\u201cWe\u2019re pretty lucky. The chest dropped a necklace and a Lesser Heal skill book. You guys can have the skill book since I don\u2019t need it, but I\u2019ll be taking the necklace,\u201d Nie Yan said. He didn\u2019t have to pay a single cent when taking an item. On the other hand, Yu Lan (Blue Feather) and her team had to share their profits with Dusk and Tang Yao. After all, the two were invited here and couldn\u2019t just leave empty-handed.\u201cIt\u2019s a Silver-grade necklace!\u201d Bai Kaishui\u2019s (Plain Boiled Water) and the others\u2019 eyes practically fell out of their sockets. A Silver-grade necklace! Now just how much was that worth? The group watched in anguish as Nie Yan put the necklace away. Ah, it\u2019s such a pity... Why does it have to belong to someone else?\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for him finding this chest, we would\u2019ve never gotten this Lesser Heal skill book in the first place. It would be better if we just buy this skill book off of you, Brother Nie,\u201d Yu Lan said. She wasn\u2019t willing to take advantage of Nie Yan\u2019s generosity. The skill book was brought back by his own efforts. They hadn\u2019t done anything to help at all.\u201cSince you put it that way... I\u2019ll be straightforward and sell it to you. The market price for a Lesser Heal skill book is around three silvers, possibly even more. However, I\u2019ll lower the price and sell it to you for cheaper\u2014two silvers! How does that sound? This price can\u2019t be considered disadvantageous to you, right?\u201d Nie Yan replied. He wasn\u2019t the least bit reserved in agreeing to Yu Lan\u2019s request.\u201cCouldn\u2019t you have just politely declined instead?\u201d Yao Yao interjected, stamping her feet.Nie Yan calmly laughed and replied, \u201cSince someone is so adamant about spending their money, why should I refuse? Only fools would refuse money. If you want this Lesser Heal skill book, I can give it to you. Even if you wanted ten of them, I would still help you find them. However, your captain wants to buy it instead because she doesn\u2019t want to owe me any favours. Let\u2019s say I disregard her sentiments and politely refuse her offer... Even if you wouldn\u2019t mind me being a hypocrite, I\u2019d still be despising myself for being one.\u201d\u201cOur team funds are only around five silvers... Would it be possible to pay you the two silvers at a later date?\u201d Yu Lan asked in slight embarrassment. If she paid the two silvers now, their funds would be even more lacking than they were now.\u201cAre your funds that lacking? You even need to owe someone two silvers? Ah, whatever, whatever! You can pay me back whenever you want,\u201d Nie Yan replied and waved his hands. An entire team couldn\u2019t even bring out two silvers... Although that appeared quite pathetic, most teams only had two silvers! In reality, Yu Lan and her team were quite well off. They were just naturally no match when paired up against a walking money bag like Nie Yan.The entire team stared at Nie Yan. These were two silvers! It wasn\u2019t a paltry amount! Yet he still didn\u2019t attach any importance to them. This man was truly rich and overbearing.Yao Yao pulled at Nie Yan\u2019s sleeves and gazed at him while blinking her innocent eyes. She asked in a harmless and sincere tone, \u201cNie Yan... would you really be willing to gift me ten skill books?\u201d\u201cUh... Sure, but you never told me where I could find those ten skill books to give you.\u201d Nie Yan felt a cold sweat run down his forehead. He knew exactly what sort of wicked thoughts were running through this enchantress\u2019 mind.\u201cHmph. You don\u2019t even have the least bit of sincerity,\u201d Yao Yao replied and feigned anger. Nevertheless, the corners of her mouth curved into a smile. Of course, she would never actually ask Nie Yan to give her ten Lesser Heal skill books. She only wanted to tease him a bit, that\u2019s all.Tang Yao glanced at the overhanging cliff. He was actually able to spot that chest all the way over there? He was increasingly unable to make sense of Nie Yan. The changes in this childhood friend of his became even greater and greater, to the point where even he was having slight troubles recognizing him. However, one thing remained certain. No matter how much Nie Yan changed, he would always remain as his brother!\u201cAlright, let\u2019s focus on the matter at hand. We\u2019re going to have to kill those two dark elves that have been stalking us from behind. There\u2019s a ravine in the area. We\u2019ll split up into two groups. I\u2019ll lead the first group into the ravine while the second group trails us. Those two dark elves are quite crafty, so we\u2019ll have to lure them into the ravine and trap them in there by blocking their exit. Afterward, we\u2019ll use the Disillusioning Powder to reveal them. However, I want everyone to stay on full alert. Even though those two dark elves don\u2019t possess much fighting strength, they make up for it with their speed. We have to make sure they don\u2019t escape; otherwise, it\u2019ll be very difficult to make them fall for the same trick twice,\u201d Nie Yan ordered and began carrying out his strategy.The team separated into two groups. The first group of ten remained on standby while the second group advanced into the ravine.While moving forward, Nie Yan paid careful attention to his surroundings. He noticed the slight movement of a silhouette eleven meters ahead. The other one didn\u2019t follow? Nie Yan questioned inwardly. However, he was then able to sense something following them from behind. The entity kept ten meters of distance between them.They\u2019re both here. Nie Yan\u2019s lips curved into a faint smile. These two elves are quite cowardly, afraid to even separate from themselves. Good, we\u2019ll wipe them both out at once.Nie Yan and the group entered the ravine. On either side of them were towering walls of rocks around ten meters high. In between was a small trail that was able to fit five or six players walking side by side.\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92This narrow ravine was the perfect site to set up an ambush. However, they had to succeed on the first try. Those two crafty elves wouldn\u2019t be easily fooled twice.Nie Yan sensed the two elves were hesitating at the entrance of the ravine. After a brief moment, they entered and followed.They took the bait. Good, now they\u2019re trapped just like a turtle in a jar! Nie Yan inwardly rejoiced. He then ordered through the team chat,\u300c Yu Lan, you guys can come over now. Block the ravine\u2019s entrance and by all means, don\u2019t let those crafty buggers escape! \u300dYu Lan felt strange and somewhat uncomfortable when Nie Yan addressed her without any honorifics, but this wasn\u2019t the time to bother with such a matter. She led the remaining team members and rushed over to the ravine.\u300c We\u2019re here! \u300dYu Lan informed.Nie Yan retrieved the Disillusioning Powder and threw it in the air, whereupon the powder scattered and floated across the ravine. The powder\u2019s area of effect constantly expanded and eventually covered the entire ravine. When the powder landed on the nearby shadows, the figures of the two impish elves were gradually revealed.With pointed ears, their emaciated figures were nearly all skin and bone while the colour of their skin was a dark ashy grey. Besides their physical features, the clothing on their bodies were shabby and worn out.While the high elves in the game were beautiful and handsome, these two dark elves were so shamefully ugly it was no wonder they were always hidden in darkness.\u201cRRYyeeKGgthh!\u201d One of the elves let out an ear-piercing screech.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Like a pair of hares, their movements were quite nimble. Nonetheless, they were quite fragile as well and only had around a hundred health. A single round of spells was enough to kill them instantly.\u201cYou want to run? In your dreams!\u201d As if he were an arrow released from a bow, Nie Yan quickly shot out from behind.The rest of the group trailed him and followed in pursuit.Right now, Yu Lan\u2019s group should\u2019ve already blocked off the exit.Before the two elves made it too far, they were immediately stopped in their tracks upon reaching the ravine\u2019s passage. Sure enough, Yu Lan and her group had already arrived and firmly stood in place, blocking off the elves\u2019 only path to freedom.They were already trapped with no hope of escape!The two elves quickly glanced at each other before dashing towards the cliff face. When they had scaled three meters of the cliff, Nie Yan arrived right behind them and suddenly leaped into the air. He reached out with his arm and managed to grab one of the elves by the leg. He then extended his left hand and shot out a line of webbing from his Silk Spinner Ring. As the web line wrapped itself around the other elf\u2019s leg, he pulled back sharply and flung the two elves off the cliff face.\u300cCrash!\u300dTheir bodies made heavy contact with the ground, causing a cloud of dust to form and rise in the air.With Nie Yan\u2019s Dexterity and jump range being so high, his range of movements and speed were astonishing to a frightening degree. These two dark elves simply weren\u2019t his match.Shortly after the rest of the team arrived and surrounded the two elves, the Mages raised their staffs and prepared to unleash a rain of spells.\u201cRyeehgh... Ryeghkh...\u201d The two elves revealed pleading expressions on their faces.\u201cHold up! Don\u2019t kill them for now.\u201d Nie Yan\u2019s heart jumped in excitement. In his previous life, the player only needed to kill these two elves and Einpat\u2019s flute would drop. When they handed the flute back to Einpat, they could proceed with the dungeon. However, he had never come across a situation such as this, where the elves wouldn\u2019t fight back and instead pleaded for their lives.In his previous life, the highest completion rate attained for this dungeon was only around seventy-five percent. Even ten years into the game, no one beat the dungeon to full completion. Yet at present, he couldn\u2019t say for sure these two elves wouldn\u2019t lead him to any information regarding the missing twenty-five percent.When he was Level 4 in his previous life, the stats of his game character simply couldn\u2019t compare with his stats right now. At that time, he was only an average low-level player, unable to obtain even a simple set of Bronze-grade equipment for himself. There was no need to even mention ludicrous aspirations such as attaining the legendary Chapter of Courage. In short, the Dexterity and jump range of his previous character were too inadequate. Let alone capturing these dark elves, even overtaking them was impossible. Therefore every team at the time\u2014including his own\u2014could only blast them with magic when they attempted to scale the ravine\u2019s walls.With their two bodies curled up like potato bugs, the two elves knelt on the ground and gazed at Nie Yan with begging expressions in the hopes that he would spare their lives.The elves spoke in an ancient language Nie Yan wasn\u2019t proficient with, the language of the elves. However, from their body language and expressions, he could roughly tell they were begging for forgiveness.\u201cWho here can speak Elvish?\u201d Nie Yan turned around and asked the team.The surrounding team members gazed at each other before shaking their heads. They only knew one language in the game, and that was the common language spoken in the empire. As for Elvish? From the start, let alone understanding it, no one had even heard of its existence before.Nie Yan silently pondered. If no one knew Elvish, communicating with these two dark elves would basically be impossible.He glanced at his own language menu. At present, there were only four languages: Common, Dragon, Ancient Common, and Kasate Giant. Suddenly, he had another thought, These dark elves are an ancient race and possess extremely long lifespans. Perhaps they\u2019ll understand other languages?\u201cPetty and frail dark elves, why have you come here?\u201d Nie Yan spoke in Dragon Tongue.Nie Yan spoke various syllables in a deep tone. The sound of his voice frightened the surrounding team members; however, they soon realized he was simply speaking another language.Upon hearing the Dragon language, the two elves were badly frightened, even trembling as they gazed at Nie Yan. One of the elves who was somewhat more courageous continued to stare at him with caution and bewilderment. Eventually, he drummed up enough courage and crawled towards Nie Yan\u2019s feet, kissing them before he fell back and began to speak.The elf also spoke in Dragon Tongue. \u201cLong live the Dragon God. This one\u2019s name is Vasa Rhine. M\u2019lord, I sincerely ask of you... are you of the dragon race, disguised as human?\u201dDuring the distant Dark Era, the dark elves were unlike the other races. As one of the races enslaved by the dragon race, they didn\u2019t join the rebellion with races such as humans, high elves, and dwarves in fighting for their freedom. Their society and faith remained pious in their belief of the dragons. Even now, those existences that were currently hidden within the deepest corners of the world were still worthy of their reverence and loyalty.Nie Yan felt elated. Humans who knew Dragon Tongue were few and far between. This dark elf had been scared witless and mistook him for an actual dragon. It\u2019s best if I take advantage of this misunderstanding!\u201cIndeed! Long live the Dragon God! Vasa Rhine, I do not wish to repeat myself. Why have you come to this place?\u201d Nie Yan spoke in Dragon Tongue once again.\u201cM\u2019lord, our Drow Dark Elf Tribe suffered a crushing defeat at the Hilton Stronghold. In the chaos and confusion, my companion and I passed through the plains and escaped to this forest,\u201d Vasa Rhine replied.\u201cAh? Vasa Rhine... So it turns out you two were deserters from the battle at Hilton Stronghold!\u201d\u201cM\u2019lord, we are not deserters! This one named Vasa Rhine is a brave and courageous soldier! We are gathering intelligence for our tribe. In the evening three days from now, our Drow Tribe will strike back at the Hilton Stronghold. At that time, Vasa Rhine will once again return to the battlefield!\u201dVasa Rhine spoke with courage and conviction.\u300c System: New quest received! Bring the heads of the two dark elves to Sir Kavrote in the HIlton Stronghold and inform him before the Drow Tribe commences their counterattack. \u300dA branching quest line! This was an exciting discovery; however, Nie Yan still maintained a calm and collected outer appearance. He continued to speak to Vasa Rhine as if everything was normal. As for the opposite party, Vasa Rhine believed Nie Yan was a dragon. He truthfully answered each and one of Nie Yan\u2019s questions without exception and didn\u2019t dare to conceal even a shred of information.As Nie Yan and the dark elf continued to speak in the strange language, the team members had various thoughts. Just what were they talking about? Those dark elves seemed to be quite fearful of Nie Yan as well. Why was that? Everyone felt shocked. Just when did Nie Yan learn the language of other races?\u201cVasa Rhine, the Treant Caretaker is a friend of mine. He informed me that you\u2019ve stolen his flute. Tell me, how shall I enact your punishment?\u201dUpon hearing Nie Yan\u2019s words, Vasa Rhine kowtowed repeatedly and begged for forgiveness. He then took out the flute and handed it to Nie Yan.The entire flute was lacquer black while its surface was carved in turtle shell patterns. As Nie Yan examined it, he noticed the flute appeared very simple and unadorned.He then glanced at its properties.Einpat\u2019s Flute (Quest Item)Requirements: Level 0Description: A flute used by the Treant Caretaker. Able to affect surrounding Treants.Properties: Willpower +20, Strength +20, Reflex +20, Health +300. Reduces the stats of surrounding Treants by 50%.Restrictions: Can only be equipped within the Treant Forest.No mistake, that\u2019s the flute we\u2019re looking for. Once Nie Yan put the flute away, he sent an order through the team chat.\u300c Kill them! \u300dThe surrounding Mages raised their staffs and began chanting their magic. To the team\u2019s surprise, the two dark elves didn\u2019t resist and remained kneeling on the ground. They stayed motionless and silent as they awaited their deaths.\u300cBoom! Boom! Boom!\u300dThe spells rained down on the two elves. They remained firmly kneeling even when suffering the assault. It was only until their health bars fell empty that the two could no longer hold themselves up. Their lifeless corpses slumped to the ground, collapsing with a gentle thud that brought a small cloud of dust into the air....\u300c System: You\u2019ve obtained Dark Elf\u2019s Head. Quantity: 2 \u300d\u201cAlright, now that\u2019s settled and done with. Good! They even dropped a pair of Warrior boots when they died. Decide between yourselves who gets it. We\u2019ll be heading off to kill the Treant King next,\u201d Nie Yan announced. This is going to be the first time in history a team finishes this dungeon with a perfect completion rate. Capturing those two dark elves led to a pleasant surprise.\u201cNie Yan, what did you and those dark elves talk about? Why did it seem like they were very afraid of you? Not to mention when we were attacking them, they didn\u2019t even dare to retaliate,\u201d Yao Yao asked after walking to Nie Yan\u2019s side.The rest of the team also stared at Nie Yan with inquisitive gazes. Even Yu Lan couldn\u2019t help but focus her attention on him.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 - Top Quality Round ShieldPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 53 \u2013 Top Quality Round Shield\u201cHmm... Oh that? That was nothing. I just spoke to them in Dragon Tongue, and they mistook me for a real dragon. The dark elves have been slaves to the dragon race since the ancient Dark Era. Even in the present, their society still considers themselves servants of the dragons which is why they were so respectful and fearful of me. Thanks to the information they provided, I also received a branching quest line so I\u2019ll be handing it in after we return to town,\u201d Nie Yan replied.\u201cDragon Tongue? When did you learn the Dragon language?\u201d Yao Yao asked. It appeared Nie Yan still held quite a few secrets since he continued revealing surprises one after the other.\u201cYeah! I heard dragons were extremely rare,\u201d Tang Yao added. Nie Yan was truly becoming more and more outstanding; even the language of the dragons wasn\u2019t out of his reach.In the same moment, Dusk\u2019s eyes sparkled as he thought of a certain possibility. Could Nie Yan\u2019s ability to speak Dragon Tongue be related to the emergence of that dragon in Link town?Nie Yan soon realized his slip of the tongue and turned to look at Dusk. From the expression on the latter\u2019s face, he could tell this fellow had grasped onto some clues.\u201cYesterday, actually. I ended up accidently stumbling into a ravine where I found an old book. When I turned the pages, I discovered it was actually an old history which recorded the events of past eras. Before I knew it, I received an announcement telling me I learned Dragon Tongue, Kasate Giant, and Ancient Common. Afterward, that dragon emerged and chased me around before I managed to make a lucky escape,\u201d Nie Yan replied in a casual manner.This explanation was specifically directed towards Dusk. He felt it was better to partially tell the truth than to allow the existence of the Chapter of Courage to be leaked.Dusk readily accepted the explanation. After all, he didn\u2019t feel too good sticking his nose so deeply into another person\u2019s secrets either.\u201cTruthfully, learning new languages isn\u2019t that hard at all. Head over to the library when your levels are higher, and if you pay one gold, you\u2019ll be able to learn the Ancient Common language. Also, if you head to the libraries belonging to the Giant race, you\u2019ll be able to learn the Kasate Giant language after paying three gold.\u201d\u201cHow do you know all this?\u201d Dusk and the others asked in astonishment.\u201cHead over to the library and look for yourself. Just browse through some of the books there, and you\u2019ll have an even better understanding of the entire Atlanta continent. There are various class-related books as well. If you manage to read them all, I guarantee you\u2019ll be experts as well.\u201d\u201cAhhh? Who the hell goes to the library? An entire library has so many books. Even if you randomly pull one off the shelf, it\u2019ll still have up to million characters! If I had to read every class and history related book in the library, it would take me a month at the very least! Who the hell has that much free time on their hands?\u201d\u201cYeah! Who has the time to read those thick and heavy books?\u201dIn his past life, Nie Yan often suffered setbacks while playing his Thief and developed an interest in reading as a result. After spending over a month reading at the library, he couldn\u2019t help but admit the history of the Atlanta continent as well as its stories were quite fascinating and engaging. From the origins of his class to the biographies of legendary Thieves and their abilities, he read it all without missing a single word. Thanks to his exceptional memory, he gained many insights. By the time he walked out of the library, he left with a thorough understanding of his class. After several more years of polishing his skills, he ranked as one of the top fifty Thieves and was somewhat famous.\u201cI\u2019ve only read a few myself. The biographies there are pretty well written,\u201d Nie Yan said with a smile.Nie Yan still had the leisure to go to the library and read? They had frequently risked life and death to reach their current level, yet they were still easily overtaken by Nie Yan. The crowd couldn\u2019t help but feel a little disheartened at such a thought.Many of the team members sighed deeply and no longer had the heart to inquire any further.\u201cWho knows what sort of rewards you\u2019ll receive after turning in that quest!\u201d Bai Kaishui (Plain Boiled Water) exclaimed, voicing out a similar thought among the crowd. Ultimately the topic everyone still cared for the most was the quest rewards.\u201cWhat was that flute that dropped just a moment ago?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a quest item called Einpat\u2019s Flute. We\u2019ll have to return it to that old man before we exit the dungeon.\u201d Nie Yan displayed the flute\u2019s properties for the rest of the team to see, whereupon everyone inhaled a breath of cold air. The flute\u2019s properties were simply astonishing. If it could be brought outside of the dungeon, it would most certainly cause every player to go crazy over it.However, Nie Yan didn\u2019t feel too much of a loss regarding this flute because he already possessed the Chapter of Courage.\u201cAhhh! It\u2019s such a pity! Why do we have to return it to the NPC?\u201dMany of the team members felt aggrieved.Nie Yan opened the trade menu and traded the flute over to Bai Kaishui. This item had to be handed over to the team\u2019s main tank for it to be used to its fullest potential.\u201cHoly crap! I have over seven hundred health! Even if it\u2019s the Treant King, I\u2019ll have nothing to be afraid of!\u201d Bai Kaishui confidently boasted after checking his improved stats.\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate the Treant King on Specialist. That thing is really difficult to deal with. Wait and see. You\u2019ll be eating your own words very soon.\u201d After splashing cold water over Bai Kaishui\u2019s parade, Nie Yan said, \u201cSince our Priests aren\u2019t able to learn Revive yet, we\u2019ll have a much easier time if two of them can cast Lesser Heal. I know another location that drops a Lesser Heal skill book so we\u2019ll be heading there next.\u201d\u201cNo way, right? Is the Treant King really that difficult to deal with on Specialist difficulty?\u201d Bai Kaishui asked in shock.After all, he had never faced the Treant King on this difficulty before. He quickly reigned himself in after listening to Nie Yan\u2019s words....From the moment they entered this dungeon to now, the profits the team earned surpassed everyone\u2019s expectations. Even if they discounted the items Nie Yan took for himself, the amount of equipment and skill books they obtained still far exceeded their imaginations. They even thought it would be great if Nie Yan could continue carrying their team just like this. However, this was nothing more than wishful thinking. He was never part of their team in the first place, and his cooperation with them would end after this run. Furthermore, he would never join their team in another dungeon run again. When they thought back to his previous statements, they couldn\u2019t help but feel a little angry. They grumbled and voiced complaints in their hearts. Why did Chen Bo have to go and piss off Nie Yan? Originally, they too had felt somewhat dissatisfied when they witnessed Nie Yan driving Chen Bo out. After all, Chen Bo was still a member of their team and Nie Yan\u2019s actions at that time really did seem excessive. Yet at present, they were having a subtle change of heart.Having obtained Einpat\u2019s Flute, Bai Kaishui became a genuine and formidable meatshield. With a Priest casting Lesser Heal from the backline, he became an unequalled tank that was able to contend against five Treants alone. After he equipped the flute, it became much easier for the team to clear the path ahead.As they progressed through the run, the amount of equipment they looted quickly piled up. They obtained another Lesser Heal skill book and two pieces of Silver-grade equipment. One of them was a pair of Thief gloves which was given to Nie Yan. They increased Strength by three and Awareness by two. The other piece was a recently dropped round shield that raised defense by fifteen percent and increased Physique by five. When the shield dropped, everyone\u2019s eyes went wide with shock because it was the first time they had seen such a high-quality shield.Round shields were fundamentally different from normal shields. Their defense was relatively lower compared to regular shields. However, their low weight meant they didn\u2019t hinder a player\u2019s movements as much as a regular shield would. Thus, round shields with high defense were a hot and very costly commodity in the marketplace.\u201cDamn! Even the round shield we got from Blackflame Forest wasn\u2019t as good as this one.\u201d Dusk widened his eyes in shock. What kind of drop rate was this? Good equipment was just dropping one after another as they progressed towards the boss. He didn\u2019t mind passing on the previous drops because they were only Bronze-grade. However, at present, such an amazing Silver-grade round shield suddenly appeared! \u201cIf you guys are willing to sell, I guarantee my captain would be willing to pay ten silvers or even higher for that round shield!\u201dEveryone present understood the significance of a Heavy Knight with a good shield. A tank that was able to withstand a boss\u2019 attacks ensured the survival of the whole team. Therefore, Heavy Knight equipment with high defense was extremely expensive on the marketplace. The bidding on this type of equipment in the auction house reached new records. However, even so, they remained targets for teams from the larger guilds.\u201cWe don\u2019t plan on selling this shield!\u201d Yu Lan took in a deep breath of air. This shield meant they could still try and take on higher level dungeons even without Nie Yan\u2019s help. Let alone ten silvers, even if it was for twenty silvers, she still wouldn\u2019t sell.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54 - Treant KingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 54 \u2013 Treant KingYu Lan (Blue Feather) glanced at Nie Yan who stood off to the side in a laissez-faire manner. She thought of the ever-increasing amount of favours they owed him. If this continued, it would soon reach a point where they couldn\u2019t possibly repay him.\u201cYao Yao (Dark Mystery), give Nie Yan our thanks. We would\u2019ve never been able to get all this good equipment if it weren\u2019t for him,\u201d Yu Lan suggested. In retrospect, Nie Yan\u2019s conditions hadn\u2019t been excessive at all.\u201cMhm,\u201d Yao Yao replied. She then walked to Nie Yan\u2019s side, her bright eyes examining his expression as she approached.\u201cWhat are you looking at me for?\u201d Nie Yan glanced at Yao Yao and smiled.\u201cWe\u2019ll be taking the round shield. You really don\u2019t mind losing out on it?\u201d Yao Yao faintly smiled and a pair of dimples emerged on her unblemished face.Nie Yan\u2019s pulse slightly raced after seeing her elegant yet bewitching smile. However, when he thought of Xie Yao, he immediately regained his composure. \u201cIt\u2019s just a round shield. Do you really think I\u2019m that stingy of a person? In any case, I\u2019m already pretty satisfied as it is. I get to take any useful drops I want, and the Featherfall Jewel from the Treant King goes to me as well. When we entered the dungeon, did you guys not put in effort too? I definitely couldn\u2019t clear this dungeon on my own,\u201d he replied.\u201cWell, that shield is worth quite a bit of money. My captain asked me to thank you on the team\u2019s behalf.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Nie Yan glanced at the nearby Yu Lan. She was tall, slender, and had a voluptuous figure which could be called perfect. If there were a few more smiles on her face, then she would be rated as quite decent. Moreover, from his memory, he recalled she was quite a prideful figure. It was seldom that she would ever lower her head to someone.As for what he knew about her, it was limited to a certain event where a player took too many liberties with her, and she retaliated by going on a rampage and killing him until he dropped back to Level 0. At that point in time, the only thought on Nie Yan\u2019s mind was that this woman was extremely terrifying. However, after becoming more familiar with each other, he came to understand she had a quiet and amiable personality. Thus, she never left him with any sort of bad impression. Besides glancing back at her figure every once in a while, he didn\u2019t really have many opinions of her. He had never really chatted much with her either and by the end, they were nothing more than nodding acquaintances....With the new equipment spurring them forward, the team members became even more spirited as they cleared mobs, especially Bai Kaishui (Plain Boiled Water) who charged into every battle. Nie Yan and the others took a detour and headed onto a smaller path where they encountered a group of five Treants. Shortly after making swift work of those Treants, another Lesser Heal skill book dropped from one of their corpses, just as Nie Yan had said earlier. From then on, the number of Priests who could cast Lesser Heal on their team rose to two.As their group progressed, they completely cleared the path of any and all Treants. Eventually, they penetrated into the deepest part of the forest and entered a clearing. The surrounding vegetation visibly lessened. Moreover, no more Treants emerged on the path and even the presence of fauna and insects disappeared.\u201cWe\u2019re almost there. Be wary of the vines beneath your feet,\u201d Nie Yan warned as he raised his guard. He walked at the front of the group and opened up a path by disarming each and every trap along the route. As the team drew closer to the centre of the forest, two vines which were lying motionless on the ground suddenly sprang to life. Like real serpents, the two vines snaked their way closer and shot towards Nie Yan.Nie Yan sidestepped the attack and switched to a reverse grip.\u300cSlash!\u300dThe vines were severed upon meeting his blade and fell to the ground.The people in the back also suffered attacks; however, they were safer due to their numbers. Even if actual danger befell one of the members, the others around them could come to the rescue. Therefore, no problems occurred in the back.After passing through the clearing, Nie Yan and the team finally caught sight of the Treant King. It resembled an immense tree towering at over ten meters high and several meters wide\u2014many times larger than the average Treant. Its leaves and branches shrouded the entire sky and cast an immense shadow over the area. However, its most distinct feature lay in the ash black bark that covered its entire body.The Treant King awoke from its deep slumber, aware of the approaching players as a cold, sinister glow radiated from its ancient eyes.Treant King (Lord): Level 5Health: 10,000/10,000\u201cIt\u2019s Lord-class!\u201d Dusk screamed in shock. The Treant King had only been an Elite-class monster when he and his team ran this dungeon. Not only did this version have much more health than its normal difficulty counterpart, it was even upgraded to a higher class!If it weren\u2019t for such an overpowered item like Einpat\u2019s Flute, even if the entire elite team from Holy Empire came over and joined them, they\u2019d likely still end up being wiped.\u201cEveryone, prepare yourselves and get into formation. Wait for the Heavy Knight to engage before going in. There\u2019s no need to feel anxious. Just listen to my commands,\u201d Nie Yan reassured before sprinting towards the Treant King.He stopped upon entering the boss\u2019 line of sight.\u201cWretched humans! For trespassing onto my territory... DIE!\u201d The Treant King roared deeply and slammed a gigantic branch towards Nie Yan.\u300cBOOM!\u300dIts gigantic arm left a deep mark on the earth. However, Nie Yan had already rolled out of the way.At that moment, Nie Yan had already fled and circled around its side. The Treant King raised its gigantic arm again and swept it towards Nie Yan.As he watched the massive arm spanning towards him, Nie Yan abruptly lowered his body and slipped into a slide.\u300cVOOM!\u300dThe Treant\u2019s sweeping attack hurtled above and past his head. The fierce pressure alone was enough to cause pain as the wind scraped against his cheek.Just a little bit slower and I would\u2019ve been swatted into the air by its attack.Nie Yan got up and fled in the other direction. Although the Treant King was overbearing and fierce, during the whole course of events, none of its attacks were able to reach Nie Yan who evaded like a slippery loach.An average team would have most likely sent their Heavy Knight, who held Einpat\u2019s Flute, to engage first since only that player could withstand the attacks of the Treant King. However, they would have neglected one key point: Heavy Knights, as their namesake would suggest, wore heavy armour which caused their movements to be hindered and clumsy. They were unable to dodge the Treant King\u2019s attacks which had a strong knockback effect. Thus, they had no chance of closing in on the Treant King without others covering for them. However, if another player were to be struck by an attack, they would undoubtedly die.Nie Yan\u2019s movements seemed awkward whenever he evaded the Treant King\u2019s attacks. Each time the team believed he was going to die from one of the attacks, they would discover he miraculously survived by dodging, rolling, or jumping out of the way at the very last second. More or less, he appeared to be more scared than hurt as he survived every encounter without mishap.Dusk, however, felt shocked by Nie Yan\u2019s actions. Holy shit! He can even do this? What a godly Thief! He subconsciously began comparing Nie Yan with the other Thieves in his team. However, he suddenly came to the realization that there wasn\u2019t a single Thief within Holy Empire who could compare to Nie Yan! If there were a Thief with even half of Nie Yan\u2019s skills in his team, they\u2019d already be quite terrific.From Nie Yan\u2019s perspective, the Treant King\u2019s attacks were slow and predictable. Each attack gave more than a second of reaction time to get out of the way. Thus, evading its attacks really wasn\u2019t much of a problem.It was simple and extremely easy, just like an adult being asked to do a grade schooler\u2019s math homework.After making sure the boss\u2019 aggro was fully on him, Nie Yan gave an order through the team chat.\u300c Bai Kaishui, take the lead and engage the boss. The rest of the frontliners will follow after. Backline, under no circumstances are you to go within thirty meters of the boss! \u300dBai Kaishui rushed towards the Treant King. Since the boss\u2019 attention was completely focused on Nie Yan, he quickly arrived in front of it. He struck the boss with Shield Bash and followed with Heroic Strike.\u221236\u221252\u201cDammit! The Treant King has such high defense!\u201dEven with Einpat\u2019s Flute, his attacks still dealt so little damage to it.\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92Shortly after Bai Kaishui engaged the boss, the other frontliners arrived as well and firmly surrounded the Treant King.Under Bai Kaishui\u2019s fierce assault, the boss\u2019 aggro quickly shifted. It swept its arm and began attacking him instead.\u300c Mages, attack! \u300dJust when Nie Yan finished speaking, numerous spells flew into the air.\u300cBang! Bang! Bang!\u300dThe spells bombarded the Treant King\u2019s body.Roughly a dozen damage numbers appeared above the Treant King\u2019s head before drifting upwards and fading away. Most of them were in the low tens and some of them were even misses. However, two of them were in the thirties. These were the attacks from Dusk and Tang Yao.Dusk\u2019s Dark Winter set and Tang Yao\u2019s Fire Chaser set were both from Blackflame Forest. Thus, both of their damage numbers were rather decent.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Therefore, the damage they dealt could be considered quite decent.The king indignantly roared as it hoisted its massive arm into the air and swiped at Bai Kaishui (Plain Boiled Water).\u300cBang!\u300dIts gigantic branch of an arm slammed into his shield. However, Bai Kaishui kept his centre of gravity low and allowed the shield to absorb the majority of the impact. It resulted in him being pushed back a few steps; however, he ran forward and closed the distance immediately. Bai Kaishui felt grateful for the advice given to him prior, of how he should remain stable and firm. Sure enough, it became quite useful in this situation. Ordinarily, he wouldn\u2019t have merely been pushed back a few steps in such an exchange; rather, he would have likely been sent flying.Those strikes were quite horrifying, each one reducing his health by eighty or so points. However, he was the sole person able to withstand its attacks, as the other frontliners would inevitably die within two strikes.Beams of gentle light fell on the players who were in a melee with the boss. In the meantime, Nie Yan evaluated the strength of the team\u2019s healers. Of the three Priests who knew Lesser Heal, the main one healed roughly sixty health while the remaining two barely reached fifty. Not that high. Things will likely get dangerous later. Seems like it\u2019s best to remain careful and not leave anything to chance.Due to the efforts of Bai Kaishui and the other frontliners, the flow of the battle stabilized. Thus, the Mages could begin steadily casting their magic.\u300c Cast fire elemental magic as much as possible and avoid ice magic. It won\u2019t be effective since the boss\u2019 ice resistance is too high, \u300dNie Yan ordered and circled round the Treant\u2019s back since his class received a damage bonus, thirty percent, while attacking opponents from behind. Paired with his exceptional equipment, his attacks easily pierced its strong defenses.Sparks flew off its body and into the air as magic poured from the sky. Its health had been gradually chipped away and now neared seventy percent.\u300c Do any of our Priests have Dispel? \u300d\u300c One of them does! \u300d\u300c Great! Pay attention to Bai Kaishui! Immediately cast Dispel when the boss casts the fear debuff on him. Don\u2019t be slow; even a second can cause us a lot of trouble! \u300dNie Yan said.The Priest felt somewhat anxious as he listened to Nie Yan\u2019s instructions. After all, he was still a novice at the game.\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92He was nicknamed Bamboo Pole by Bai Kaishui and the others due to his naturally lanky build. He felt quite nervous at the moment, anxiously gripping his staff while his muscles appeared to have been frozen stiff. However, Nie Yan noticed his apprehension and spoke reassuringly.\u300c Relax a bit. I\u2019ll remind you when the time comes, so all you\u2019ll have to do is cast Dispel on my signal. \u300dAfterward, Bamboo Pole shot a grateful glance at Nie Yan.Just as its health reached seventy percent, the boss released a deep roar that sent shivers down everyone\u2019s spine.Meanwhile, Bai Kaishui halted his attacks and involuntarily retreated back while his movements became extremely rigid.\u300c Dispel! \u300dNie Yan shouted through the team\u2019s voice chat. Without delay, Bamboo Pole cast Dispel and a bright light illuminated Bai Kaishui from above.Bai Kaishui had only retreated a few steps when feared. He charged back into battle and slammed his shield at the Treant King with Shield Bash.\u300c Not bad! \u300dNie Yan praised.Bamboo Pole instantly felt relief seeing as his spell succeeded.Following Nie Yan\u2019s directions, the entire team fell into the rhythm of battle. Coupled with the fact that he knew the Treant King\u2019s actions in advance, its health bar steadily fell lower.It\u2019s using Lash!The Treant King lifted its vines and sent them lashing at Bai Kaishui.\u300c Priests, prepare to heal Bai Kaishui in three... two... one... now! \u300dA gentle shower of light shone on Bai Kaishui and his health continuously teetered up and down; the line separating life and death lay on a razor thin edge. However, thanks to the Priests, his health managed to hold until the end.Nie Yan, on the other hand, released a flurry of attacks from behind. Roughly three minutes later, the entire team had steadily chipped away as its health fell to merely twenty-five percent.\u300c Priests, how much mana remaining? \u300d\u300c 67! \u300d\u300c 56! \u300d\u300c 23! \u300d\u300c The Priest with twenty-three mana, drink your Mana Potion! \u300dThe Priest downed a Basic Mana Potion after Nie Yan called him out....Suddenly, the Treant King transformed into a shade of red.\u300c Finally... Everyone, get ready! Bai Kaishui, switch to a defensive stance! Mages, increase your damage output! Priests, prepare yourselves! \u300dNie Yan shouted. Bai Kaishui, in the moment he heard these instructions, held the shield to his chest and switched stances.The Treant King let out an explosive roar. It raised its arms and slammed down on Bai Kaishui.\u300cBang!\u300dThe Treant King\u2019s gigantic arms landed on Bai Kaishui\u2019s shield and sent him several steps back, losing over two hundred health in the exchange. However, even after such a terrifying attack, the Treant King was unwilling to give up. It raised its arm once more and relentlessly smashed.\u300cBang! Bang!\u300dThe assault left two more craters in the earth while a gentle shower of light fell on Bai Kaishui in between the attacks.\u2212221+60\u2212256+52Above Bai Kaishui\u2019s head, four numbers floated upwards as he was repelled back.\u300c Such high damage! \u300dIf it weren\u2019t for Einpat\u2019s Flute, just one of those attacks would instantly kill even the most powerful Fighter.Bai Kaishui felt a cold chill run down his spine as he glanced at his health bar. If it weren\u2019t for the timely heals from the Priests, he would have long been dead.The Treant King had finished its three-hit combo and seemed to have come to a rest. However, a moment later, it continued its onslaught of battering their tank.\u300c Bai Kaishui, pull back! The rest of you guys, hold the line for a bit! \u300dNie Yan began running to Bai Kaishui\u2019s side.Bai Kaishui dodge rolled the Treant King\u2019s next attack and downed a Basic Health Potion. However, the amount of health restored was basically negligible compared to his current total health.The other frontliners rushed up to take Bai Kaishui\u2019s place, forming a human shield as they blocked the Treant King\u2019s advance. However, they could only hold it off for a limited time since their defense and health were much lower in comparison to the one they were replacing.Nie Yan arrived at Bai Kaishui\u2019s side and applied an Intermediate Combat Bandage.+20... +20... +20...\u201cDrink a Basic Recovery Potion!\u201d\u201cI already drank one.\u201d\u201cWait for the next round of healing from the Priests!\u201dTwo Priests cast Lesser Heal on Bai Kaishui. After ten seconds, more than half of his health had recovered.The other frontliners couldn\u2019t hold on much longer. There was no one left to take another attack. After all, two hits and any one of them would be dead. If the Treant King scored a critical hit, even if they were full health, they would instantly die. Furthermore, two of their members had already been killed and sent to the graveyard.\u201cBai Kaishui, go back in!\u201d Nie Yan ordered when Bai Kaishui\u2019s health had recovered past four hundred.Bai Kaishui raised his shield and ran up to meet the boss. They had been in a state of crisis just now. Thus, no one dared to be any more careless. Tang Yao, Dusk, and the rest of the backline took out their most powerful spells, unloading each and every one on the Treant King.\u300c I\u2019ll be out of mana soon! \u300dTang Yao anxiously said.\u300c Cast Arcane Fireballs! It expends the least amount of mana. Warriors and Paladins, go all out! Use Flame Slash! \u300dNie Yan replied. They only needed to hold out for a little longer. Victory was right before their eyes. They absolutely couldn\u2019t fail at the final stretch of the battle. He circled behind the Treant King and used Vital Strike followed by Assassinate.The Treant\u2019s health steadily fell: nine percent... eight percent... six percent...The team became increasingly nervous; none of them were willing to slow down by the slightest degree.\u300cBang! Bang! Bang!\u300dFireballs landed on the Treant King\u2019s body and left deep wounds upon impact.Three percent!\u300c All frontliners, retreat! Mages, give it everything you\u2019ve got! \u300dNie Yan suddenly instructed through the team chat.The Warriors and Paladins didn\u2019t understand why Nie Yan would have them retreat at such a crucial moment. However, they still listened to his orders without the slightest hint of hesitation and pulled back. Nie Yan had been the one who carried them to this point in the run. Thus, they had unwittingly come to acknowledge his ability and held faith in his commands.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Soon, large fractures began forming on the surface, spreading to the nearby surroundings, appearing as if they would rend the entire world asunder.Then powerful shock waves erupted from the depths, pouring volatile magical energy onto the surface.The frontliners felt their hearts tighten as they witnessed the tyrannical might of this skill because likely then and there, they would have been instantly killed were it not for Nie Yan ordering them to retreat. Furthermore, with their absence and only the ranged units remaining, the team would certainly lack the damage necessary to finish off the boss, leading to a possible wipe as a consequence. Often times even the slightest of mistakes could reverse the outcome of a battle.\u201cRe-engage! The boss doesn\u2019t have much health left. Faster everyone, faster!\u201d Nie Yan shouted. Their next step was to simply finish off the Treant King, then everything would be fine. Besides, with so little health remaining, it couldn\u2019t possibly do any more to reverse the situation.\u201cHeroic Strike!\u201d\u201cRadiant Slash!\u201dA volley of magic poured into the sky.\u300cBang! Bang! Bang!\u300dThe spells blasted its body, depleting the boss of what little health it had remaining. Upon entering its death throes, the Treant King mournfully moaned as cracks began appearing all over its body. A moment later...\u300cBoom!\u300dAn explosion rocked the area as its body splintered into pieces and fell to the ground as a pile of wood debris.\u201cThe Treant King is dead!\u201d\u201cWe succeeded!\u201dAll of the team members excitedly cheered. For a team like theirs, clearing this Specialist dungeon was simply a remarkable and unimaginable achievement.In the exact moment they toppled the Treant King over, everyone felt like they were in a dream as if everything that happened wasn\u2019t real. However, this dream was in fact reality, and an indescribable feeling of admiration arose in their hearts. Before meeting Nie Yan, their team hadn\u2019t even been able to clear this dungeon on Easy difficulty. Yet while following his lead, they were able to directly beat it on Specialist difficulty\u2014truly an inconceivable feat.\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92Seeing everyone\u2019s joyous and excited expressions, Nie Yan broke into a smile because he was very much the same when he cleared a dungeon for the very first time.Tang Yao, Yao Yao (Dark Mystery), Yu Lan (Blue Feather), and Bai Kaishui (Plain Boiled Water) were among the eight people who leveled up. Meanwhile, Nie Yan\u2019s experience bar had risen to fifty-two percent. As one could quite easily tell, the Treant King had given an ample and generous amount of experience.Nie Yan dug through the pile of wood debris. Despite finding two pieces of equipment, they weren\u2019t the item he was looking for so he continued his search. He brushed aside the branches and twigs and jolted in elation when a bright blue gem entered his vision. This is exactly what I was looking for!This gem was completely different from ordinary gems. Resembling a diamond, it was carved with many facets and blossomed with a dazzling radiance.He quickly appraised the gem with Transcendent Insight. Featherfall Jewel... Ah, it\u2019s the Featherfall Jewel! I finally have it in my hands...\u201cTwo pieces of equipment and a jewel dropped. One of them is a Silver-grade hat for Arcane Mages, and the other is a Silver-grade armour for Paladins. As for the jewel, I\u2019ll be taking it for myself,\u201d Nie Yan announced. Even if he wanted to take the equipment, he wouldn\u2019t have to pay money. However, the other members had to pay the rest of the team with their bid if they wanted the equipment.At this moment, not a single person raised any objections.The Arcane Mage hat went to Dusk for the low price of one silver and fifty coppers. Thanks to this, he didn\u2019t come out of the trip empty-handed. The Paladin armour was taken away by Yu Lan for two silvers. Since many of the members were part of her team, and its value was divided evenly, most of the money stayed with her team and she only had to pay Dusk, Tang Yao, and Nie Yan a few coppers.\u201cWhat kind of jewel is that? Share the properties with me,\u201d Dusk asked. He was rather curious about the jewel in Nie Yan\u2019s hands. After all, the only reason the latter ran this Specialist dungeon was for the sake of this jewel.Nie Yan shared the Featherfall Jewel\u2019s properties.Featherfall Jewel (Dark Gold): OrnamentRequirements: Level 0Properties: Defense 8\u201310, Strength +7. Can be equipped with the accessory slot or embedded into jewelry slot where applicable.Featherfall: Activate to allow the player to fall like a feather through the air. Duration: 3 minutes.Weight: 1 lbRestrictions: None.Excluding rings, necklaces, and medallions, every player had five slots which players could equip accessories. Nie Yan equipped the Featherfall Jewel into one of his accessory slots.\u201cSo it was a Dark Gold accessory! No wonder you cared about it so much!\u201d Dusk exclaimed in surprise. The properties on this Featherfall Jewel weren\u2019t that great but its Featherfall ability was quite rare; otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t be classified as a Dark Gold-grade.Through this entire run, even if they were to add up all the equipment they received up till now, it still wouldn\u2019t be equal in value to the equipment Nie Yan obtained for himself. Some team members felt this was a little unfair; however, they quickly erased this thought and quickly got over it. Without Nie Yan, let alone clearing this Specialist dungeon, they wouldn\u2019t have even obtained a single hair.\u201cHow many Honour points did your team receive?\u201d Nie Yan glanced at Yu Lan and asked.\u201cAround twelve hundred. Thank you,\u201d Yu Lan looked at Nie Yan and sincerely thanked him.\u201cSo much? Even when my team cleared Blackflame Forest, we only received eight hundred,\u201d Dusk exclaimed in fright. He began to think Specialist difficulty truly wasn\u2019t simple. This was merely Treant Forest. If they were to run Blackflame Forest or Agmota Muddy Wetlands on Specialist, he\u2019d imagine the rewards would definitely be much more generous.\u201cYou guys can head to Blackflame Forest or Fallen Shaman Camp now. If you haven\u2019t gone to those dungeons before, you should take some time to prepare,\u201d Nie Yan said.\u201cWill you come with us?\u201d Yao Yao gazed at Nie Yan and asked.Yu Lan and the rest also perked their ears up while waiting for Nie Yan\u2019s reply. However, Yu Lan also understood her team\u2019s little temple wasn\u2019t big enough for a deity such as Nie Yan to stay in.Nie Yan faintly smiled and said, \u201cLike I said before, I won\u2019t be following you guys to Blackflame forest.\u201d He definitely wouldn\u2019t have a pleasant time running a dungeon together with a person like Chen Bo. However, if Yu Lan and the others kicked Chen Bo out of the team, he would think it over. Even then, it was simply thinking it over. He\u2019d have to check whether he had the free time.\u201cOh...\u201d Yao Yao felt somewhat disappointed.\u201cIn a few days, Brother Nie is going with us to run Agmota Muddy Wetlands,\u201d Dusk interjected. He was now thoroughly convinced of Nie Yan\u2019s ability. Being able to run another dungeon with this expert was truly a wonderful matter for him.Tang Yao gazed at Nie Yan with expectation in his eyes. He wanted Nie Yan to bring him along as well.Nie Yan sent a whisper to Tang Yao.\u300c Your skills aren\u2019t there yet. Agmota Muddy Wetlands has very high requirements for Mages. You can practice by following Yu Lan and her group for now. Then when you\u2019re good enough, I\u2019ll bring you along on the harder dungeon runs. \u300d\u300c Alright, I understand. \u300dTang Yao nodded his head. Nie Yan wouldn\u2019t lie to him. If he did tag along for Agmota Muddy Wetlands and couldn\u2019t keep up, he\u2019d likely lose face for Nie Yan. He calmed himself before resolving to run a few more dungeons with Yu Lan and her team. That way he could polish up his skills.\u201cHow about letting Tang Yao tag along with you guys for Blackflame and Fallen Shaman Camp? As for those dungeons, I can give you guys a bit of advice,\u201d Nie Yan suggested.Yu Lan nodded her head and said, \u201cWe\u2019re extremely glad to have him. From now on, he\u2019ll be part of our team.\u201d Tang Yao\u2019s magic damage was quite high. His contributions in this run were great as well. For this kind of person to be willing to stay on their team, she couldn\u2019t be any happier. Moreover, with Tang Yao here, Nie Yan would definitely give them some advice instead of keeping it from them.With the item distribution finished, besides the Uncanny Dodge skill book, the Forest Necklace, and the Featherfall Jewel, Nie Yan also received three silvers. Meanwhile, Tang Yao earned his first large profit and received roughly sixty coppers.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 - Generous RewardsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 57 \u2013 Generous Rewards\u201cIs there anything we still need to do?\u201d Dusk asked.\u201cReturn the flute to Einpat,\u201d Nie Yan replied. He glanced at Bai Kaishui (Plain Boiled Water) and said, \u201cHand the flute to me.\u201dAt the end of the day the flute was a quest item and never belonged to him in the first place. Bai Kaishui inwardly sighed and handed the flute back to Nie Yan.Nie Yan eyed the forest thickets and spotted a decrepit old man walking unsteadily towards them.\u201cRespected Senior, we\u2019ve punished those despicable dark elves and retrieved your flute.\u201d\u201cGood! Yes, this is indeed my flute! Thank you, brave adventurers. There\u2019ll be no need to navigate the winding and twisting paths on your return. I\u2019ll send you all to the exit myself. May the Divine bless you!\u201dHad Nie Yan and the others tried to keep the flute, they would have incurred Einpat\u2019s wrath and likely found themselves in a perilous situation. Ultimately the Treant Forest would have become a resting place for their bones.\u300cSystem: Side quest \u201cEinpat\u2019s Missing Flute\u201d has been completed. You have received 28,596 experience points.\u300dShortly after Nie Yan received this notification, a thick fog emerged and enveloped the team; the elderly Einpat disappeared as well. When the fog finally dissipated and everyone could see clearly again, they discovered they had been returned to the entrance of the forest.\u201cWe can still collect another reward by going to the commander in Calore!\u201d Nie Yan glanced at his experience bar. Among his teammates, he received the largest share of the experience because he had contributed the most during Einpat\u2019s quest. Moreover, after gaining the experience from the side quest, his experience bar rose to seventy-three percent.Everyone was in high spirits. It truly felt great following Nie Yan into a dungeon. After receiving the reward, their experience bars once again rose by a large chunk....After travelling back to Tellak town, the entire team took the transfer point to Calore.Upon arriving, Nie Yan headed directly for the barracks.\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92Their destination was to the southwest of the city. When they arrived at the outer perimeter of the barracks, they saw tall walls with many sentries posted atop. Overall, it appeared the defenses and security of this place were fairly tight. Nie Yan and his group didn\u2019t enter the barracks but rather the lofty white tower that stood beside it. This was the building where Commander Kavrote was stationed.As they entered, the group could see there weren\u2019t many NPCs within the building. However, a tall middle-aged man still walked over to greet them. He had a face full of scars and wore the military uniform of the Viridian EmpireNie Yan used Transcendent Insight to examine this NPC\u2014Commander Kavrote.\u201cYoungsters, what business do you have coming to this place?\u201d\u201cLord Commander, we caught two dark elves lurking inside Treant Forest. After interrogating them, we received some information that concerns the safety of Hilton Stronghold. Here are the heads of the two dark elves we caught.\u201dCommander Kavrote followed up with a few more questions while Nie Yan answered accordingly in the formal manner which was standard in player-to-NPC interaction. Afterward, he handed the Dark Elf Heads over to Commander Kavrote.\u300cSystem: Side quest \u201cDeliver the Information\u201d has been completed.\u300d\u300cSystem: Your Influence in Hilton Stronghold has increased by 11.\u300d\u300cSystem: Your Influence in Calore has increased by 11.\u300d\u300cSystem: You have received 32,320 experience points.\u300d\u300cSystem: You have learned Fighting from Commander Kavrote.\u300d\u300cSystem: You have gained +2 Strength.\u300d\u300cSystem: You have received 2 silvers.\u300dSome hidden quests gave additional stats as quest rewards. Nie Yan never expected this quest was one of them or to be so lucky as to receive two additional points in Strength.Each member of the team received decent experience and money as rewards. Meanwhile, Nie Yan\u2019s experience bar rose to ninety-seven percent. As for the two silvers he also received as a reward, they simply didn\u2019t count for much considering the amount of wealth he already possessed.Rather than grinding mobs, it seemed much easier to level up by doing quests. However, quests were divided into different levels. The higher the difficulty of the quest, the more experience points it would give. For example, relatively simple quests such as gathering animal furs would give very little experience as a reward. While in team quests, the rewards each individual received would be based on their own contribution in the quest. In the case of this quest as well as Einpat\u2019s, Nie Yan had contributed the most, thus he received the most experience, while the other members received much less in comparison.\u201cWell we\u2019ve handed in the quest so I should probably get going now,\u201d Nie Yan said to Yao Yao (Dark Mystery) and the others.\u201cWhat are you gonna do now after handing in the quest?\u201d Yao Yao asked. She was somewhat reluctant to part.\u201cKilling monsters and levelling up. However, where I\u2019m going you guys are certainly unable to follow,\u201d Nie Yan replied. Since he now had both the Featherfall Jewel and Silk Spinner Ring, there were many places he could try going to.\u201cSince he\u2019s busy, let\u2019s make our team and level up,\u201d Dusk suggested. With so many high damage Mages on this team, it would be too much of waste if they separated now.\u201cFatty over here has the Meteor spell. It\u2019s got good area of effect and is decent at mobbing groups of monsters, so you probably won\u2019t be levelling slowly with him on the team,\u201d Nie Yan suggested. He was planning to have Tang Yao familiarize himself with the others so he would no longer have to worry about not being able to find a team. After receiving numerous pointers from Nie Yan over such a long period of time, Tang Yao\u2019s skills had soared in proficiency. Though he still couldn\u2019t be called an expert, he would have absolutely no problems assisting this team. After all, low-level dungeons and killing mobs generally weren\u2019t too challenging for an Arcane Mage.\u201cMeteor!?\u201d Everyone was surprised. At this point in the game, Mages who knew offensive area of effect spells could best be described as being as rare as a phoenix feather.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t we see you use it earlier in the dungeon?\u201d Bai Kaishui asked.\u201cUsing that skill in the dungeon? Do you think I\u2019m looking to die!?\u201d Before entering, Nie Yan specifically warned him not to cast Meteor while in the dungeon. Tang Yao had taken this warning very seriously. Therefore he sounded quite blunt and forceful in his reply.\u201cOh right. Haha...\u201d Bai Kaishui awkwardly smiled and scratched his head. Casting large area of effect spells would frequently alert many mobs and build up a lot of aggro at the same time. In such a case, the frontliners wouldn\u2019t be able to keep the monsters from getting to the backline.\u201cSo it turns out he actually he had Meteor! Why are we still wasting our time here?\u201d Dusk rubbed his hands together. He was getting a little impatient to see the might of the rare Meteor spell for himself.\u201cI\u2019ll be taking my leave first then,\u201d Nie Yan said goodbye to everyone. Though after seeing Yao Yao\u2019s unhappy appearance, he laughed and said, \u201cNext time, I\u2019ll kill monsters with you guys. How about it?\u201d\u201cRemember those words because you\u2019re not allowed go back on them!\u201d Yao Yao widened her eyes, sounding pleasantly surprised. Her bright and colourful smile was as dazzling as the sun. She didn\u2019t know why but she felt like she had known Nie Yan for a very long time despite them only being acquainted for a few days. They seemed to have a sort of unusual familiarity and understanding with each other.Nie Yan laughed and said, \u201cSure.\u201dAfter leaving the group, Nie Yan began walking over to Calore\u2019s auction house.Meanwhile, the others in the group gazed at Nie Yan\u2019s departing back. Only when his figure disappeared into the crowded streets did they finally regain their senses.\u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s go and train.\u201dWhen Dusk saw Nie Yan disappear into the crowd, he turned around and said, \u201cYeah, let\u2019s head out.\u201d As they departed the area, he sent a message to Sleepy Fox.\u300c Captain, take a look at this video. \u300d\u300c What kind of video? \u300d\u300c Just watch it, and you\u2019ll know. \u300d...In the Lesser Werewolf spawn area near Tellak town, a group of players was in the middle of combat. At the front of the group amongst those players was Sleepy Fox. He turned to the Warrior nearby and said, \u201cHold the line for a moment!\u201d before retreating from the fight.\u201cAlright!\u201dAs he retreated, several spells whizzed past him and blasted the Lesser Werewolves behind him.He was currently in the middle of levelling. For Dusk to dare disturb him at this point in time, it would definitely be an important matter. He opened up the video and pressed play and was surprised to discover the person in this video was Nie Yan. His interest was now piqued; thus, he continued to watch. While he observed Nie Yan and the others killing the mobs, he furrowed his brows. This is Treant Forest, right? Why do the Treants have such high health? He was quite knowledgeable in the game. With but a glance, he was easily able to spot something strange about this video.They\u2019re running the dungeon on Specialist!\u300c Treant Forest on Specialist... D id you guys actually clear it? \u300dSleepy Fox sent a message to Dusk. He was shocked; however, he soon regained his wits. S uch crappy equipment and their team still dared to enter a Specialist dungeon? Quite a rare sight indeed...62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was on the part of the video where Nie Yan first began luring the Treants with the crossbow. Even if one had exceptional skills, accurately firing those three bolts in such a short time frame and under such pressure was nearly an impossible feat. Nie Yan\u2019s skills were beyond exceptional.The players at present had just entered the game, so in regards to skill, they were a far distance away from Nie Yan. These three bolts might be nothing more than a common everyday skill in his former timeline. However, in the eyes of Sleepy Fox, Dusk, and the others, it was no different from the skills of a god!Sleepy Fox had never valued or noticed the importance of a Thief during a dungeon run. After all, many teams who lacked one still managed to clear dungeons just fine. Therefore, he never attached any importance to what Nie Yan could do as a Thief when he invited him. Though at present, he began to think having a good Thief in a dungeon expedition team was somewhat of a significant matter!He had always felt the team was lacking a certain something yet only now did he realize what it was. What they were lacking was exactly an expert-level Thief like Nie Yan!\u300c Stone was correct. He really is an expert, \u300dDusk said. Stone\u2019s judgement had always been somewhat lackluster, yet this time around... They didn\u2019t know how or what, though a good analogy would probably be something like a disabled cat finding a dead mouse, but he somehow managed to invite a godly expert to their team.\u300c We should be able to clear Agmota Muddy Wetlands now. \u300dAfter finishing the video, he understood the phrase, \u201cA successful Thief can increase the team\u2019s survival by thirty percent or higher,\u201d slightly better. This line didn\u2019t only apply to three-player parties nor only five-player parties, it meant the same with twenty-player and even thirty-player teams as well!Besides his individual skill, Nie Yan\u2019s leadership abilities were certainly commendable too. Were it not for him, Yu Lan and the others would have found it impossible to pass the dungeon because of their sub-par equipment.The moment Nie Yan found out Dusk was part of Holy Empire, he knew the progression of the run would be seen by Sleepy Fox. Therefore the least he could do was to eliminate some of the doubts in Sleepy Fox\u2019s mind.Now that the Featherfall Jewel was in his hands, Nie Yan was reminded of a famous Elite Monster, Gato the Lion King. He still needed to make quite a few preparations if he wanted to get rid of that overgrown feline.Nie Yan took a stroll around the auction house. Since the demand and selling price of Black Phenol wasn\u2019t bad, many Alchemists gathered whatever leftover ingredients they had and concocted it into Black Phenol to put up on the auction house. At the moment, there were a little over a hundred bottles and several dozen recipes for sale. In but a few days the value of these items would soar considerably. However, a few days hadn\u2019t arrived yet so Nie Yan pressed purchase without the slightest hesitation and cleaned the entire auction house out of all its Black Phenol, Black Phenol Recipes, and even the ingredients used to create Black Phenol.After purchasing all of the Black Phenol and Black Phenol related items, Nie Yan sorted by price and bought nine of the most expensive crossbow quivers up for sale: two thousand Blackgold Bolts, three thousand Nightmare Bolts, and four thousand Tempered Poison Bolts.Blackgold Quiver (1000 bolts): Damage +12 | Price: 2 silverNightmare Quiver (1000 bolts): Damage +10 | Price: 1 Silver, 50 copperTempered Poison Quiver (1000 bolts): Damage +9 | Price: 1 Silver, 10 copperThese bolts cost Nie Yan a pretty penny. Besides a few players from the larger guilds who were in charge of luring monsters, absolutely no one could bare to use these expensive bolts. Truthfully, even those wealthy guilds would find it a bit too wasteful squandering these bolts on luring monsters. Therefore the demand for these types of bolts wasn\u2019t much at all. However, their prices still remained high because they were relatively uncommon. Hence, only ridiculously rich players like Nie Yan would purchase these things.After purchasing the quivers, Nie Yan teleported to Mordor using the transfer point and headed off in the direction of Violet Dream Hills.He went past the town walls and travelled north for roughly ten or so kilometers before encountering an unbroken chain of mountains. Arriving at the base of one of these mountains, he ran up the path leading to the mountain peak. Upon reaching the peak, he gazed far into the distance and saw an open plain. Due to how high up he was, everything on this plain looked extremely small. He then looked at the landscape directly beneath him which was nothing but desolate terrain.Standing atop the peak where the wind whistled through the air, he observed the forest of conifers that ran along the mountain range; the trees flowed like the waves in an ocean of green.The peak he stood on top of was roughly several hundred meters above ground. For the average player, it would mean certain death if they tried to jump off this peak.Nie Yan paced back and forth around the peak, occasionally glancing down to examine the landscape directly below. However, he halted upon finding a certain tree situated near the peak\u2019s edge.He stood directly under this tree and faced east. One step, two steps, three steps... This should roughly be it.\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92Yep, it\u2019s right here. There\u2019s no mistaking it. Nie Yan then leaped off the mountain peak.Though his actions stated otherwise, the purpose of making this trip wasn\u2019t really so he could commit suicide. It was because the lair of the Level 7 Elite monster, Gato the Lion King, was located beneath this cliffside. This monster was the field boss who ruled over this desolate terrain, and many unsuspecting players who came to this area to train would find themselves killed by this mighty lion.Gato would respawn within a day if he was killed. Moreover, he had a high probability of dropping the Blackblood Set which consisted of three items: cloak, gloves, and shoulder guards. At Level 5 Silver-grade, the set was currently one of the best Thief equipment sets in the game, coming second to the Covenant Set which could only be found in the yet-to-be-opened Sosil Valley dungeon. By obtaining the Blackblood set, Nie Yan could at least guarantee that he was fully geared in first-rate equipment. Beside the aforementioned set, Gato also dropped various Thief skill books.In Nie Yan\u2019s previous life, many players gathered here to hunt Gato the Lion King. Plenty of chaotic battles occurred for the sake of snatching the equipment he dropped. Often times a large expanse of players covered the entire area, so wanting to grab the Blackblood set wasn\u2019t a simple matter. While trying to complete the set was even more of an ordeal. This was due to the fact that Gato would also spawn several hundred Lions with him each time he respawned. Therefore players needed to clear the surroundings of Lions before facing off against the boss safely. However, the numerous ordinary Level 7 Lions were extremely difficult to deal with as well.The player base at present was too low level. At the very least, it would take twenty-five Level 5 or higher players to hunt Gato. However those sort of players were few and far between. Moreover, those who were at that level were certainly experts as well. In any case, gathering so many top ranked players together certainly wouldn\u2019t be easy.Let alone Gato, players didn\u2019t even dare to come to this area to hunt the ordinary Lions. This vicinity was a Level 7 monster spawn area so very few people would come. Even if they did, none of them would be able to reach Gato\u2019s lair. This was the reason Nie Yan could feel at ease while carrying out his plan.The wind blew past his hair as he continued descending in altitude. When Nie Yan reached four fifths of the way to the ground, he activated the Featherfall Jewel\u2019s skill, whereupon he immediately began slowing down. He felt like he was as light as a feather as his speed slowed down to a steady rate.Under the effect of Featherfall, Nie Yan\u2019s falling speed was only somewhat faster than the actual falling speed of a feather.The distance between him and the ground grew increasingly short. He estimated his current altitude at about twenty meters above ground. He shot out a web line from his Silk Spinner Ring which stuck to the rock face and stopped his fall. Now suspended in the middle of the air, he looked below to discover a robust brown Lion with a large mane of hair and an imposing royal aura.By coincidence, this Lion was also within his firing range.Obviously, this was Gato the Lion King. Nie Yan recalled this was the exact location where he spawned.Perfect. The web line connected to Nie Yan\u2019s left hand was firmly secured on the vegetation growing on the rock wall above. His right hand reached into his bag and took out a crossbow. He lined the sights on the Lion...\u300cWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u300dThe bolts shot out of the crossbow and went in a straight line towards Gato.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 - Gato the Lion KingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 59 \u2013 Gato the Lion KingSince the majority of the player base was too low level, very few players were able to reach this destination, which led Nie Yan to believe his actions were far from prying eyes.However unbeknownst to him, in an area not far from the cliff face he overhung, a group of ten or so players were hunting mobs. The strongest among them reached Level 6 while the lowest was Level 4. Even their highest level member was still a level lower than these Lions, thus none of them dared to penetrate too deeply into Violet Dream Hills.Although they received three hundred percent bonus experience for killing these Level 7 Lions, it was offset by their numbers. Moreover, their expenditure was too great. In the game\u2019s current state, even a single Basic Health Potion was an expensive luxury. Yet they were consuming these potions at a ludicrous rate. Were it not for the fact that their profits were somewhat decent after recently picking up a Leo Shield and a few fur pelts, they would have long stopped hunting these high health hard-to-chew monsters.\u201cBladelight, let\u2019s leave after another hour or two. We should have enough Lion Pelts by then,\u201d said the Priest to the Level 6 Fighter at the front of the group.The Fighter named Bladelight raised his shield and blocked an incoming Lion\u2019s attack. Brandishing his sword, he countered with Heroic Strike and kited the Lion as the Mages whittled its health away. Once its health fell below a certain point, he finished it off with Whirlwind Slash.\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll leave in an hour then. Since we\u2019ve already got a Leo Shield, it\u2019d be perfect if the Leo Armour dropped as well,\u201d Resplendent Bladelight nodded and replied He unhurriedly collected the items that dropped from the monster\u2019s corpse.\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. I read online that the drop rate for Leo Armour is one in five hundred,\u201d said an Elementalist who walked to his side. He and Resplendent Bladelight were the only Level 6s in their team.His character was named Hei Zhuo (Black Amazing). The two of them could be counted as experts in the game. Although they were friends, neither was willing to admit they were weaker than the other. In terms of skill, Bladelight was superior but Hei Zhuo\u2019s influence in their guild was higher. Their guild was named Unhindered and was established using both of their names. Since Bladelight wasn\u2019t interested in the management aspects of the team or guild, Hei Zhuo naturally took on this role. Under his leadership, not only did Unhindered become a successful guild, it became somewhat famous as well.\u201cWhat? The Leo Shield\u2019s drop rate is only one in a thousand yet we still managed to get one anyway.\u201d Bladelight rebuked.\u201cThat\u2019s only cause you got lucky...\u201d Hei Zhuo\u2019s complexion paled. Bladelight\u2019s tone made him somewhat speechless and angry; however, he still managed to mumble out a few words in reply.\u201cIf I can equip the Leo Armour, I\u2019ll have the highest defense out of any player in the game!\u201d Bladelight said in a confident tone.Egotistical prick... Hei Zhuo thought in disdain. His expression, however, did not betray his inner thoughts.He and Bladelight, on various occasions, competed in sparring matches in the arena, though the difference between them was clear. Out of ten matches, it\u2019d be considered amazing if he could even beat Bladelight in two of them.Bladelight was famous, quite skilled, and he was well-respected among players in several professions. In truth, Unhindered was established solely on his reputation alone. Thus, Hei Zhuo had no choice but to rely on Bladelight. However, as the guild continued to expand, Hei Zhuo\u2019s authority over it grew as well. As a result, he was slowly inching out Bladelight in terms of position within the guild.As he and his team prepared to continue their hunt, Bladelight happened to gaze over at the distant cliff face and was surprised to discover a player jumping off its peak. Jeez... I\u2019m seeing stranger things by the day. People are even committing suicide in video games. Can\u2019t this guy be a little less morbid? However, to his astonishment, that player\u2019s falling speed continued to decrease, to the extent where they were unlikely to die even if they hit the ground.\u201cGuys, look at the cliff face over there!\u201d Bladelight exclaimed in an amazed manner.\u201cHmmm, why?\u201d Hei Zhuo asked as he inadvertently looked to the side, whereupon his expression immediately froze. He also noticed Nie Yan. At that moment, he saw Nie Yan shoot out something from his hand and suspend himself in midair, whereupon he took out a crossbow and began firing below.\u201cWhat the heck is doing?\u201d The surrounding members stared blankly.\u201cAmazing, this guy can even think of a strategy like this! Haven\u2019t you guys figured it out? He\u2019s killing monsters!\u201d Bladelight straightened his back and replied. The player overhanging this cliff deeply interested him. For being able to figure out such a unique method of killing mobs, this certainly wasn\u2019t an average player.\u201cThat item on his hand should be the Silk Spinner Ring!\u201d Hei Zhuo recognized this item because he was knowledgeable of most equipment in the game.\u201cIf we also had this Silk Spinner Ring, could we also be like him and hunt monsters like that?\u201d\u201cNo, even if we had that ring, we still wouldn\u2019t be able to. Unless we have equipment with the Featherfall ability like him, the force of the fall would likely snap the web line,\u201d Bladelight replied. The Silk Spinner Ring was already quite a rare accessory that held considerable value. There was even less of a need to discuss equipment with the Featherfall ability which happened to be rarer. These two unique items couldn\u2019t necessarily be bought even if one did have the money. Yet for the sake of hunting monsters, this person obtained both? Just who the hell was he?\u201cDamn! I\u2019d like to be able to kill monsters like that. If I never have to worry about being attacked while firing bolts, I\u2019d be able to rise several levels in no time!\u201d\u201cNot necessarily. The number of mobs in his range is limited. His levelling speed won\u2019t be that high because the mobs don\u2019t respawn fast enough at the rate he\u2019s killing them. After clearing all the mobs in his range, he\u2019ll have no choice but to go back,\u201d a somewhat knowledgeable member of the team voiced their opinion.Hei Zhuo didn\u2019t utter a single word while listening to his teammate\u2019s discussion. They couldn\u2019t penetrate too deeply into the area because the nearer they approached that cliff, the higher the mob density. Since they didn\u2019t dare to get anywhere near that area, they would never know what sort of monsters that player was hunting.\u201c ROAAAR \u201d The deafening sound travelled all the way from the cliff face to where they were standing. The surrounding members paled as they all looked on in horror.A robust Lion leapt five meters into the air and threw itself at the cliff face. The pounce was quite powerful and ferocious, even managing to shake the cliff face on impact. Yet no matter how high that Lion leapt, it was far from being able to reach Nie Yan. Its body halted on the cliff face and involuntarily slid off. All the while, Nie Yan dangled calmly in midair and steadily fired more bolts.\u201cIt\u2019s the Elite-class monster, Gato the Lion King!\u201d Hei Zhuo shouted, his voice cracking in astonishment.Each member of the group looked at each other in dismay and shock. Gato the Lion King, even if they were to form a twenty-player team right now, they still wouldn\u2019t be able to kill this Lion. Yet this Level 7 Elite-class monster was currently being turned into a pin cushion as it was slowly shot to death by a single player overhanging a cliff. When they thought of this, they felt resentment boiling up inside of them, perhaps even more so a feeling of envy and jealousy.\u201cCan we rush in and steal the equipment from him after he kills it?\u201d one of the members asked.\u201cImpossible. We simply don\u2019t have any means of going there, unless Guild Leader Hei Zhuo can call a bunch of people over here. However, the losses we would suffer far outweigh our potential gains.\u201d\u201cAh... Forget it then.\u201dAs Bladelight, Hei Zhuo, and the others contemplated, the earth violently trembled. The vibrations they felt on the ground resembled a stampede. Each of their faces paled, and they quickly looked into the distance. What they saw was a giant dust cloud rising into the air and several hundred Lions running in their direction. The Lion King\u2019s roar had stirred up the Lions in the vicinity!\u201cWe\u2019re done for! Everyone, retreat immediately!\u201d Hei Zhuo shouted in alarm, but it was already too late. The stampede of Lions had discovered their presence. At that moment, they were simply awaiting their impending doom.Bladelight realized how difficult it would be to escape, so he raised his shield to welcome the enemies.Meanwhile, the perpetrator of this disaster was hanging leisurely over the cliff face. He didn\u2019t need to expend much strength. All he needed to do was steadily fire his crossbow. The bolts that were fired all had the additional property of dealing bonus on-hit damage. Even if it was the Level 7 Lion King, it still had no more than five or six thousand health. Under his steady fire, it soon had less than half of its health remaining.The Lion King\u2019s aggro was fully on Nie Yan but it was incapable of attacking him. Thus, there was nothing it could do. Since it only knew physical attacks, all of its abilities were related to raising its physical damage. Even when it leapt at its highest, it only reached six or seven meters while its opponent was suspended twenty meters in the air.\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92Killing monsters that surpassed him in level became much simpler with these bolts that dealt bonus on-hit damage. Each and every bolt would deal real and genuine damage.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 - Resplendent BladelightPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 60 \u2013 Resplendent BladelightNie Yan specifically chose this location after making certain the Lion King didn\u2019t have any ranged attacks. Gato was the boss that resided at this cliff base, and Nie Yan recalled that there were at least ten other monsters like him. However, Gato happened to be the easiest one to deal with because it only knew physical attacks. Naturally, Nie Yan would choose to challenge the pushover over the others.The Lion King tried every which way to get its claws on Nie Yan. However, as time elapsed, its health eventually fell below twenty percent, and it entered a berserk state. Its robust and muscular body, though weakened, suddenly filled with energy and unyieldingly pounced at Nie Yan. However, no matter how hard it struggled, all of its efforts were futile in the end.Before another half hour even passed, its health bar fell empty. The Lion King raised its head to the sky and resentfully roared, unwilling to resign to its fate, before collapsing onto the earth.Gato the Lion King, the boss that would be fought over by numerous players in the future, had its life ended just like that. Nie Yan hadn\u2019t lost a single drop of health in the process of whittling it to death.\u300cDing!\u300dA clear melody rang into the air. He received eight hundred percent bonus experience for killing a monster that surpassed him in level. After hitting Level 5, his experience bar continued filling up and only stopped upon hitting thirty-six percent.The Lion King had dropped two pieces of equipment. Both items lay sparkling on the ground beside Gato\u2019s corpse.Equipment dropped! Excitement arose within Nie Yan; however, he still couldn\u2019t come down.He could see ten or so Lions still roaming around in an area not far from Gato\u2019s corpse. In order to retrieve the dropped items safely, he needed to clear them out first. Thus, he continued firing the crossbow until each Lion was shot to death.Unlike other games, dropped items never disappeared after a certain amount of time. The game resembled real life as in items thrown on the ground would never just evaporate into thin air. As for items players didn\u2019t need or couldn\u2019t sell, they could be broken down into raw materials by the Recycler to recoup some of their value.Seeing as there were no monsters left in the area, Nie Yan released the web line and dropped to the ground. After falling twenty meters, he only lost sixty health. This sort of height wasn\u2019t enough to kill him with fall damage.Nie Yan walked up to the Lion King\u2019s side and collected the two pieces of equipment that dropped. Since both items were unappraised, he revealed their properties with Transcendent Insight.Blackblood Cloak (Gold)Requirements: Level 5Properties: Defense 19\u201321, Resilience +5, Mov. Speed +6Weight: 2 lbRestrictions: Thief; can be equipped by all factions.Lion King\u2019s Shield (Gold)Requirement: Level 5Properties: Defense 39\u201351, Block Chance +12%, Resilience +5, Magic Resist +7Weight: 10 lbRestrictions: Fighter, Paladin; can be equipped by all factions.\ud835\udd7f\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd86\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd93\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd91-\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd93.\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd92Nie Yan felt quite satisfied when he saw that a piece of equipment from the Blackblood set had dropped, though he didn\u2019t expect the Lion King\u2019s Shield to drop as well. Its value was much higher than the Blackblood Cloak! To illustrate a point, if he brought it to the marketplace, he absolutely wouldn\u2019t sell it for anything less than twenty silvers. In the best case scenario, he could exchange it for a couple pieces of Thief equipment.The price for a Fighter\u2019s shield remained high in the marketplace, always occupying the top positions in terms of price. Out of the ten most expensive pieces of equipment sold in the marketplace, eight were Fighter shields.What a good piece of equipment! Along with the Blackblood Cloak, I\u2019ve made a decent profit. Nie Yan stored the shield and cloak into his bag.I\u2019m finally Level 5... Nie Yan glanced at his stat page. Due to the Chapter of Courage\u2019s effect. he gained two additional stat points and one additional mastery point upon reaching Level 5, meaning he had a total of seven stat points and two mastery points to allocate. He allocated two points in Strength and five in Dexterity. Since Intermediate Marksman couldn\u2019t be improved any further at his current level, he distributed his two mastery points into Dagger and Dual Wielding. As a result, he gained a ten percent attack bonus along with increased proficiency in wielding daggers. Moreover, he could at long last dual wield weapons.Nie Yan brought out all the Level 5 equipment he had been carrying with him just for this occasion. After switching out all his Level 0 equipment, he glanced at his character info.Main Weapon: Horn Dagger (Bronze)Secondary Weapon: Assassin\u2019s Decree (Gold)Armour: Headhunter\u2019s Silver Leather Armour (Silver)Cape: Blackblood Cloak (Gold)Boots: Boots of Swiftness (Gold)Nie Yan\u2019s upgraded equipment drastically changed his appearance. The Headhunter\u2019s Silver Leather Armour, with its dull silver-white lustre, gave off a chilly aura of slaughter and death. From his back hung a dark, blood-red cloak that emitted a faint golden glow. In addition, the pair of daggers he held in his hands flickered with a cold glint. The style of Thief equipment was generally reserved compared to other classes, and Nie Yan had also concealed the equipment\u2019s visual effects, but from a quick glimpse, one could still discern that his equipment was out of the ordinary.Nie Yan became much faster with his Level 5 equipment. He moved like the wind, leaving afterimages behind him.\u201cNot bad,\u201d he muttered to himself. He felt quite satisfied with his new equipment.In this period of time where good equipment was still scarce, his own equipment would cause the overwhelming majority of players to look at him in admiration.This new equipment would enable him to freely roam around any Level 6 or 7 monster area as he pleased.Nie Yan would need to wait a day for Gato to respawn, so he began heading out of Violet Dream Hills. His next objective was the Level 8 Elite-class monster Ogre Devourer, who resided in an area not far from this one. The loot the Ogre Devourer dropped was also rather decent, as it dropped items for every class. In his past life, there was even a player who\u2019d obtained a piece of Dark Gold Thief equipment. Of course, the drop rate for equipment of this grade was extremely low. The Ogre Devourer was also a monster that took a day to respawn.Nie Yan made sure to carefully avoid the Lions as he left the area. Moving forward, he heard a rustling sound coming from a nearby bush. Nie Yan looked over just in time to see a Fighter clad in white armour with an ashen silver greatshield in his hand leap out of the bush and come running in his direction. Just moments later, three Lions also emerged from the bush and pounced after the Fighter.That Fighter\u2019s footsteps were steady and unhurried. However, his situation was a little unfavourable, as his health was running low and the Lions\u2019 attacks became increasingly ferocious.Intimidate!The Fighter\u2019s sudden and explosive roar startled the Lions and halted their movements for a brief moment. Taking advantage of this small opening, he followed with Tendon Break and targeted the closest of the three Lions before rapidly pulling back.The Lion struck by Tendon Break temporarily entered a crippled state. The two other Lions fiercely growled and leapt into the air, pouncing on the Fighter.The Fighter retaliated with Heroic Strike, striking one of the Lions and repelling it. He then firmly raised his shield to meet the other Lion\u2019s attack. Even for a Level 6 Fighter, it was still quite difficult to deal with three Level 7 Lions while low on health.Nie Yan had activated Stealth the moment the Fighter appeared and blended in the background. Instead of leaving, he idled around the Fighter.If Nie Yan were to take advantage of the situation and act, the Fighter would undoubtedly die. However, he still held some reservations. Judging by the other party\u2019s firm and collected movements, he could tell with a single glance that they were an expert. He was currently contemplating whether it was worth becoming enemies with this expert over a single piece of equipment. In the end, he decided it was best to wait for the three Lions to kill this expert first. After all, when two sides fought, it would always be the third party that benefited the most.As for saving this person, Nie Yan had no interest in such an idea. He had been in too many situations where the person he saved repaid his kindness with malice. In this world, everyone fought for their own interests, so it was necessary for him to learn how to be cold-hearted.Since this person dared to come to this area, they were presumably not weak. Nie Yan examined this Fighter with Transcendent Insight.Resplendent BladelightLevel 6 FighterNie Yan raised an eyebrow after reading this player\u2019s name. He knew almost all the players who rose to fame in Calore, even if they held just a little bit of reputation. Naturally, this Resplendent Bladelight was no exception.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 - FavourPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 61 \u2013 Favour\u201cHow could it be him...?\u201d Nie Yan muttered to himself. Though he had no dealings with Resplendent Bladelight, he still recognized this name because it was quite influential in his past life.Bladelight held impressive renown as he stood amongst the top three Fighters in the game. That said, the rankings were an inadequate indicator of their strength due to the minuscule gap between him and his two rivals. This made it near impossible for others to determine who truly reigned supreme; therefore, despite not being the absolute strongest, Bladelight was still a celebrity Nie Yan had heard of.Now that Nie Yan thought about it, he seemed to recall there was a story surrounding Resplendent Bladelight. It was about one of his friends, an Elementalist named Hei Zhuo (Black Amazing). The two, who jointly established a guild named Unhindered, were considered the closest of friends. However, Bladelight didn\u2019t care much for managing Unhindered, so full authority over the guild eventually fell to Hei Zhuo. Later on, Bladelight found out his girlfriend was having an affair with Hei Zhuo while he, of course, had absolutely no clue this had been occurring. He was a proud and arrogant person, so how could he bear this sort of humiliation? In retaliation, he brought many of his brothers away and left the guild. From then on, Unhindered separated into two factions with irreconcilable differences. As for what happened after... Bladelight could be considered a hero of sorts\u2014he kept to his promises, valued loyalty, and was well respected among other players. Moreover, no one disputed his position as one of the top three Fighters in the game. Hence, without Bladelight, Unhindered went on a continual decline and eventually degenerated into a second-rate guild.As Bladelight resisted the three Lions, he felt a cold chill run down his spine and a peculiar sensation arose in his heart. He steadily retreated as he fought, occasionally glancing behind to look around, yet he saw nothing but empty space.However, his instincts would never betray him. He knew this odd feeling came from the gaze of a Thief.Even with six points in Awareness, he was still unable to locate the other party\u2019s position. This isn\u2019t an ordinary Thief!\u201cBrother, since you\u2019re already here, why don\u2019t you show yourself? My name is Resplendent Bladelight. If you\u2019ve decided to attack, I won\u2019t attempt to struggle since I\u2019m done for in any case. However, if you\u2019re willing to save me, you\u2019ll have my thanks. In addition, I\u2019ll even swear on my name that I\u2019ll remember this favour.\u201d Bladelight spoke in a clear tone. At the same moment, the Lion that had been left behind recovered from its crippled state and joined back with its two companions. All three pounced forward and intensified their assault.Hoh? I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to notice me. Nie Yan pondered for a short while. He would only obtain a single piece of equipment if he killed Bladelight. The equipment he\u2019d acquire wasn\u2019t for his class and its value wasn\u2019t something he highly regarded. In contrast, being owed a favour by a top-tier Fighter held much greater appeal than a single piece of equipment. Moreover, from his previous life, he knew Bladelight was known for being a trustworthy person.The lights and shadows in the background blurred, followed by a figure emerging into sight roughly three meters from Bladelight. Nie Yan had emerged! He lowered his body and swiftly struck one of the Lions with a sweeping kick.Concussive Blow!The blade of his daggers flashed with a cold glint. Among the three Lions, the one he struck with Concussive Blow was low on health. Nie Yan chained his prior attack with Assassinate followed by Vital Strike and instantly killed the Lion, whereupon he drew back immediately and pulled out a crossbow.\u300cWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u300dThree bolts shot out of the crossbow and pierced the air.\u300cPut! Put! Put!\u300d\u221237\u221238\u221232Nie Yan\u2019s attacks caused the two remaining Lions to switch aggro. They turned around and pounced on him.Taunt!Bladelight knew that at this moment, his best course of action was to support Nie Yan. His taunt came at just the right time. The Lions stiffened mid-pounce and the aggro switched back to him.\u300cWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u300dNie Yan fired his crossbow once more and three bolts shot through the air.\u300cPut! Put! Put!\u300dThe Lion that was already low on health from being struck earlier died after the second round of bolts.Nie Yan withdrew his crossbow and pounced toward the remaining Lion.Cleave!Bladelight leapt high into the air and struck the remaining Lion. The attack ensured its attention was fixated fully on him while Nie Yan circled round its back and released a flurry of attacks.\u221252\u221250\u221251Thieves dealt thirty percent more damage when attacking an enemy from behind. A brief moment later, the Lion went limp and collapsed to the ground.Bladelight felt a mix of shock and relief when he saw Nie Yan\u2019s nimble movements and high damage. What a strong Thief! Just a moment ago, if he had decided to attack me instead, I\u2019d have zero chance of survival.Nie Yan walked up to the three Lion Corpses and searched around. To his disappointment, nothing had dropped.\u201cWell, that\u2019s settled. Too bad nothing dropped. Anyway, if you plan on keeping your promise, this means you owe me one now. My name is Nie Yan (Nirvana Flame),\u201d Nie Yan said, examining Bladelight. He appeared to be near his mid-twenties. He also looked mature and rugged, giving off the impression of someone who could be relied on and trusted.\u201cI, Resplendent Bladelight, am a man of my word. I\u2019ll remember this favour. In the future, just call if you need me. As long as it\u2019s within my capabilities, I\u2019ll do my best to lend a helping hand,\u201d Bladelight replied in a straightforward manner. He wasn\u2019t the type of person who backed out on his promises.Bladelight then glanced at Nie Yan\u2019s face and was shocked at his immature appearance. He never thought this Thief would be so young. He only looked to be eighteen or nineteen years old. Moreover, he didn\u2019t think Nie Yan would appear in this area for no rhyme or reason. Presumably, the player he had seen earlier, suspended over the cliff face and shooting the Lion King, was Nie Yan.\u201cWhy did you come here all by yourself?\u2019 Nie Yan asked. It was quite dangerous for a lone Fighter to burst into a high-level monster area. Thieves might not have a problem coming here but that was only because they could avoid danger by activating Stealth.\u201cI entered this area in a party with my friends but we got separated when we met a large group of Lions. I\u2019m the only one remaining; everyone else died. I was constantly fending off those Lions and there was never a chance for me to use a Return Scroll. If it weren\u2019t for my high health and defense, I would\u2019ve likely died as well,\u201d Bladelight replied in a calm manner; however, Nie Yan could imagine how bitter and desperate of a situation he had been in.\u201cI guess you\u2019re lucky then.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. I am pretty lucky for being able to somehow survive. How about we add each other as friends? Resplendent Bladelight is too much of a mouthful. You can just call me Bladelight.\u201dNie Yan accepted Bladelight\u2019s friend request. His new friend was a powerful Fighter, which was worth being happy over. At least from now on, he\u2019d no longer have to worry about finding a good tank when running a dungeon.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a safe place for you to idle around. It\u2019s best for you to hurry up and return to town,\u201d Nie Yan suggested. If a pride of Lions were to catch sight of them, he could still easily escape, but Bladelight was different. He had no way to hide himself. Moreover, with his large build and bulky equipment, he\u2019d likely become a free meal for the Lions in this area.For Bladelight, these words weren\u2019t pleasant to the ears but he had no means to refute them. Besides the fact Nie Yan seemed to be much stronger than him, Fighters couldn\u2019t compete with Thieves when it came down to survivability.\u201cAlright then, I\u2019ll leave. I owe you a favour, so if you ever need me just send a message. As long as it\u2019s within my capabilities, I\u2019ll try my best to help!\u201d Bladelight nodded his head and retrieved a Return Scroll from his bag. It really wasn\u2019t safe for him to stay here for too long.\u201cWait a second!\u201d Nie Yan shouted, stopping Bladelight just when he prepared to activate the scroll. His impression of Bladelight was quite good.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cI have a shield that you might want. I don\u2019t mind selling it to you if you can give me a decent price,\u201d Nie Yan said. It would be too much of a pity selling this shield through the auction house. If an acquaintance could afford it, he might as well sell it to that acquaintance instead. Either way, by selling the shield, he\u2019d have more money to do other things.\u201cHuh? Let me take a look at it.\u201d Bladelight seemed quite interested. Nie Yan was the person who suspended himself over the cliff face to kill the Lion King. To be able to use such an ingenious method of hunting a boss, he was certain to have good equipment.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62 - OgrePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 62 - OgreNie Yan placed the Lion King\u2019s Shield inside the trade window.\u201cThis shield should be worth over twenty silvers, but I don\u2019t mind selling it for only twenty.\u201d\u201cT-this... dropped from the Lion King when you killed it?\u201d Bladelight was left shaken after examining the shield\u2019s properties. He couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine how much better the Lion King\u2019s Shield was in comparison to his own. In fact, there really was no comparison; the two weren\u2019t even on the same level.Nie Yan furrowed his brows. How did Bladelight know he killed the Lion King?Seeing Nie Yan\u2019s reaction, Bladelight hurriedly explained, \u201cOh, my apologies. It seems I got a bit too excited. However, you can rest assured that I won\u2019t leak this information.\u201d Then, he returned his gaze to the shield. \u201cThis Lion King\u2019s Shield really is worth over twenty silvers. If it were to appear in the marketplace, it definitely wouldn\u2019t sell for less than twenty-five silvers. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have that kind of money on me right now. Would you be willing to wait for me to scrape up enough funds after returning to the city?\u201d\u201cSure. I can wait,\u201d Nie Yan replied, nodding his head.\u201cOh! I also have a few pieces of Thief equipment in my personal storage. Several of them are pretty decent, and some of them should hold your interest. Would you be interested in exchanging them in place of money?\u201d Bladelight asked.\u201cAs long as I can use them, I\u2019m fine with it,\u201d Nie Yan replied. He had actually been worrying about being unable to find good Thief equipment, so Bladelight\u2019s suggestion came at the perfect moment.\u201cAh, alright then. I\u2019ll contact you after I collect the money. Please don\u2019t sell the shield to anyone before then!\u201d Bladelight felt tense and anxious as he stared the Lion King\u2019s shield in Nie Yan\u2019s hand.Nie Yan thought for a moment before he replied, \u201cI\u2019ll wait a day. If you\u2019re not able to to raise enough money by then, I can only look elsewhere to sell.\u201d Out of the people he had frequent contact with, only Bai Kaishui (Plain Boiled Water) from Yu Lan\u2019s (Blue Feather) team was a Fighter. However, it was highly unlikely, if not impossible, that Bai Kaishui could afford the twenty silvers he wanted for the shield. Nie Yan felt a little hesitant, putting the shield up in the auction house. He\u2019d much rather keep the fertile waters flowing in his own fields. After all, it was more beneficial to give such equipment to his acquaintances rather than strangers.\u201cOne day is enough!\u201d Bladelight promptly replied.He was a straightforward person and didn\u2019t haggle over the shield\u2019s price because he understood he had already received a great bargain. Normally, if it was sold to someone else, such a shield wouldn\u2019t sell for any bid less than twenty-five silvers. For it to sell for thirty silvers or higher was a reasonable albeit unlikely possibility as well. Nevertheless, twenty silvers was still a significant sum. Hah... Seems that I\u2019ll have to borrow some money.Filled with excitement and anticipation, Bladelight activated the Return Scroll so he could raise the funds he needed in the city.\u201cOh, there\u2019s one other matter. Is Hei Zhuo (Black Amazing) your friend?\u201d Nie Yan asked. After thinking it over, he still felt it was best to warn Bladelight. The type of people he detested the most were two-faced backstabbers. Hei Zhuo and Bladelight were friends. Yet the former still chose to have an affair with the latter\u2019s girlfriend. This sort of behavior... Nie Yan truly found it condemnable.\u201cYes, he is. How did you know?\u201d Bladelight asked, a hint of bewilderment mixed in his tone.\u201cI\u2019ve heard many unpleasant rumours surrounding what kind of person he is. A little incident happened between him and one of my friends. My friend met him and a woman called Zhi Yan (Beautiful Angelica) at Midnight Charm at Calore, and they got into a scuffle.\u201d Nie Yan glimpsed at Bladelight\u2019s expression. In his previous life, this bar was where Bladelight discovered his girlfriend and Hei Zhuo were committing acts of adultery. Nie Yan didn\u2019t mind exposing Hei Zhuo\u2019s deeds at an earlier date.Sure enough, after listening to Nie Yan\u2019s words, Bladelight\u2019s complexion slightly paled.Zhi Yan was his girlfriend whom he met online. Later on, they met each other in real life and had been living together since. If she and Hei Zhuo really were committing indecent acts within the game, it would truly be difficult for him to find out.Hei Zhuo and Zhi Yan were the most trusted people in his life. He didn\u2019t believe this was true... No, he wasn\u2019t willing to believe it could be true. Yet, deep in his heart, he felt a hint of uncertainty and restlessness.Could it be what he\u2019s saying is actually...? No... Bladelight shook his head. It\u2019s absolutely impossible.\u201cIf I ever meet Hei Zhuo, it won\u2019t be on friendly terms. Of course, it\u2019ll have nothing to do with you.\u201d Nie Yan was only warning him out of the kindness of his heart. Regardless, he wasn\u2019t the one being cuckolded. \u201cIf there comes a day where you plan on leaving Unhindered, come and find me. I\u2019d be happy to have you by my side.\u201d Nie Yan said all that he wanted to say; he turned around and began walking into the distance.\u201cI\u2019ll never leave Unhindered,\u201d Bladelight coldly replied. He convinced himself Nie Yan was just another one of those people trying to poach members for their guild.Truthfully, Nie Yan really did have the intention of recruiting him. After all, it would be a great boon for him to successfully pull Bladelight to his side. However, this little setback was of no matter. He had never hoped for immediate results. His goal was already accomplished. A seed of doubt had been planted deep within Bladelight\u2019s heart. Sooner or later, as it slowly germinated, he would one day at last... catch whiff of what was being done behind his back. And at that moment, once he realized his short-sightedness, he\u2019d recall Nie Yan\u2019s invitation; this much was enough.Nie Yan didn\u2019t bother explaining. He activated Stealth and disappeared from Bladelight\u2019s view.For a short while, Bladelight stood there in a daze. Eventually, he unfurled the Return Scroll and activated its magic within. A brilliant light flashed through the surroundings, and he was teleported away.Nie Yan was currently dashing through Violet Dream Hills. At the base of a mountain in the distance, he could see an enormous tree several dozen meters in height. It would take at least seven full grown men to link their arms around this tree, and its immense treetop resembled a roof blocking out the sun. Such a landmark seemed especially lofty when placed within Violet Dream Hills.Surrounding this tree was a forest of smaller trees and vegetation. The Ogre Devourer he had been searching for was located here. A Level 8 Elite-class monster: if he and it were to go head-to-head, he\u2019d stand absolutely no chance. However, when it came to hunting monsters, he didn\u2019t necessarily need to face this Ogre Devourer in direct combat.The boss frequently roamed around the vicinity. Therefore there was no set position where it could be found. If one were unlucky or careless, they would end up encountering it by accident. Unlike Gato the Lion King, the Ogre Devourer wasn\u2019t as well-known, and the items it dropped were a bit worse. Add on the fact that its skin was coarse and thick while its health was high, many players would find it very difficult to deal with. Furthermore, it possessed a skill named Petrifying Gaze which had the effect of paralysis. Average players were advised to keep as far away as possible if they encountered this boss.Nie Yan neared the giant tree as he passed through some thickets. His Cloaking stat wasn\u2019t low. Thus, once he hid in the background, even if he wasn\u2019t in stealth, he wouldn\u2019t be so easily discovered by monsters or players.The wind was surprisingly strong at the base of the mountain, and it carried the faint scent of blood.Amid the sounds of leaves rustling in the wind, Nie Yan also heard distant footsteps. He hurriedly hid behind a nearby bush and looked towards the origin of the sound. Whereupon, an obese, two-meter-tall, blue-skinned, two-headed ogre entered his vision.The Ogre wielded a giant wooden club in its hand. Its movements were clumsy and its two heads were looking around endlessly. Only after a long while did they finally start walking again.With a single glance of its body, Nie Yan could tell this wasn\u2019t the Ogre Devourer but merely a common Ogre.Nie Yan didn\u2019t have any interest in killing small fry. He took a detour around the Ogre and continued his search. After exploring the area for what seemed like ages, he finally heard the sound of heavy footsteps coming from the depths of the forest.He could distinguish these Ogres from the sound of their footsteps. The one approaching him definitely wasn\u2019t ordinary.Finally... The Ogre Devourer is coming. Nie Yan dashed towards the immense tree at the end of the forest which was roughly eighty meters away. Near the large tree, there were six other smaller trees. They were also thick and sturdy; roughly two grown men were required for their arms to surround a single tree.He decided on these several trees as the location for his Ogre hunt.Best n0vel 0nline free at \u24dd(0\u24e5)\u24d4\u24db\u24d1\u24d8\u24ddAs he arrived near the source of the sound which also happened to be in the direction of the immense tree, he gradually recalled the incident that prompted him to head to this area. Before he reincarnated, after the servers had been open for over two years, a Level 5 Thief single-handedly killed the Level 8 Elite-class monster, Ogre Devourer. Despite the player base having outgrown this boss, such an unprecedented event had still caused quite a stir.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63 - Art of WeavingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 63 - Art of WeavingAn enormous figure entered Nie Yan\u2019s sight after ten or so seconds. It stood at an evident twofold the height of an ordinary Ogre while it spanned a much greater width; this was the Ogre Devourer.Nie Yan hid behind a tree with one of his knees on the ground. He retrieved his crossbow, holding it up with his left hand while his right gripped the trigger. He gazed forward and aligned the crossbow sight with his target.A Level 5 Thief had killed the Ogre Devourer with a crossbow by chipping away its health. Nie Yan had to admit... that person must have been quite courageous. Nonetheless, if they were to compare, Nie Yan wouldn\u2019t lose to this Thief in any aspect; there was absolutely no doubt he too could accomplish this feat. After all, he was a Great Thief who had been on the cusp of becoming a Shadow Dancer. He reckoned the Shadow Dancers in his era could also do the same.Nie Yan had a thorough understanding of the process used to whittle the Ogre Devourer to its death. Nevertheless, the execution was still going to be a challenge. In his past life, that Thief had killed the boss without a hitch, but his success was partially attributed to luck.Through the sight, the figure of the Ogre Devourer drew increasingly near. Nie Yan redirected his aim to a certain area on the boss\u2019 chest\u2014its weak point, the heart.He held his finger on the trigger and prepared to launch a few bolts. However, out of nowhere, two common Ogres entered his line of sight. They were roaming in the vicinity of the boss.Nie Yan stopped himself from pulling his trigger finger and paused for a moment. Though there was a sudden introduction of two unknown variables, whether they could influence the success of his plan remained to be seen. The Ogres are big and clumsy. I should be fine as long as I don\u2019t get hit...That said, it still isn\u2019t an easy task to shave their health down without receiving any damage.Raising his crossbow once more, Nie Yan took aim at the Ogre Devourer.\u300cWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u300dWith the pull of the trigger, three bolts shot out, aimed directly at the Devourer\u2019s heart.The three bolts whistled in the air.\u300cPut! Put! Put!\u300dAs if the bolts had struck thick bark, hard muffled sounds rang out.Ogre Devourer (Elite): Level 8Health: 6,000/6,000Although this boss didn\u2019t deal as much damage as the others, it made up for it with high health and thick skin. Either way, the Ogre Devourer certainly wasn\u2019t easy pickings.Due to its strong defense, normal crossbow bolts dealt limited damage. Nie Yan\u2019s current attack only enabled him to deal two to three points of damage at most using normal bolts. Fortunately, he had bought those special bolts which dealt on-hit true damage. One of those bolts would take out at least fifteen health which was quite impressive.The Ogre Devourer turned around in the direction of its assailant. It lumbered forward and moved towards Nie Yan while brandishing its large wooden club. The Devourer\u2019s heavy five-ton body resembled a humanoid fortress as each of its steps caused tremors in the earth.Best n0vel 0nline free at \u24dd(0\u24e5)\u24d4\u24db\u24d1\u24d8\u24ddSeeing that he had successfully aggroed the boss, Nie Yan dashed towards a nearby tree and chose a path with denser vegetation. The Ogre Devourer was awkward and clumsy, and it seemed as if it were running slowly due to its large build. However, its large strides covered quite a bit of distance, and it was actually closing the gap as it chased Nie Yan. The other two Ogres could also be seen following the Ogre Devourer from the rear, though it soon became apparent that they weren\u2019t going to catch up. They continued trailing further and further behind.After running for about fifty meters, Nie Yan deaggroed the Ogre Devourer because it wasn\u2019t able to catch him. It turned around and looked as if it wanted to depart.However, Nie Yan turned around and shot three more bolts at it before dashing off again. After being attacked again, the Ogre Devourer reaggroed onto Nie Yan and chased him with renewed zeal.While running, Nie Yan noticed only the Devourer was chasing him. The other two Ogres had long stopped chasing and were now wandering around in a distant area.Eh? I guess my luck isn\u2019t bad. It\u2019ll be much easier dealing with the Ogre Devourer alone.The boss gradually closed the distance, and only twenty meters separated them.As it chased Nie Yan, the Ogre Devourer began emanating a dangerous aura. Its four eyes suddenly turned red, and its body radiated a scorching light like a cartoon bomb on the verge of exploding.The two pairs of eyes locked onto Nie Yan.Petrifying Gaze!Nie Yan felt his chest tighten when he noticed the Ogre Devourer\u2019s abnormal behavior. These types of monsters that could lock the player down were especially terrifying. If one were careless for just a moment, that player would find themselves unable to even budge an inch.In the same moment the Ogre Devourer used Petrifying Gaze, Nie Yan rolled out of the way and ducked behind a tree.MISS!The Ogre Devourer roared in anger when it failed to hit its target. It strode forward and covered a large distance with each step while it charged at Nie Yan. The two Ogres behind it were also alerted. However, after only a few meters, they turned around and began wandering around again.Nie Yan sucked in a deep breath of air while he hid behind the tree. The information he previously read in a guide was correct! After attacking the Ogre Devourer twice, it would use Petrifying Gaze six seconds later. If a player was struck, they would become frozen for six seconds, incapable of any movement. At present, the only method of dodging Petrifying Gaze was to get behind cover before the skill activated. Furthermore, the player couldn\u2019t be a second late.In the event that the skill hit Nie Yan, the Ogre Devourer would have caught up and smashed him to death with its giant wooden club.This was the reason why it was considered extremely difficult soloing the Ogre Devourer. Not just anyone could accomplish this task. Even long after the video of it being killed had been published, it still remained as one of the toughest early game bosses to contend against.\u300cWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u300dNie Yan fired another round of bolts. He nimbly traversed between the trees and fired the crossbow from time to time.\u300cCrash! ... Crash! ... Crash!\u300dThe Ogre Devourer continued brandishing its club. Each swing proved fruitless since trees were all they struck.The key point in killing this boss revolved around making sporadic movements while traversing past obstacles. Although its running speed wasn\u2019t slow in spite of its immense size, it was rather lacking in agility. An excellent Thief could take advantage of this weakness by circling around several large trees, making it so that the Ogre Devourer would miss its attacks.However, this strategy was not one that could be pulled off well by anyone. If the player lacked spatial awareness, couldn\u2019t properly judge the Ogre Devourer\u2019s movements, or carelessly got hit by Petrifying Gaze, they\u2019d likely be sending their lives to the boss.In order to avoid being caught, the player had to always run in a curve and never in a straight line. They also couldn\u2019t stop moving for more than three seconds.With so many years of combat experience supporting him, many actions became instinctive and ingrained on the deepest level, enabling him to easily fire the crossbow while smoothly navigating the terrain.Seeing as the Ogre Devourer wasn\u2019t too difficult to deal with, Nie Yan felt much more relaxed. His nimble body weaved between the large trees while he fired the crossbow between the gaps. The boss had no way of dealing with Nie Yan. Unable to figure out how to catch him, its two heads turned in every direction, eventually getting dizzy and confused.With top-quality gear and ten years of experience, if he couldn\u2019t even match that Level 5 Thief in his past life, he shouldn\u2019t have even bothered playing this game.\u300cPut! Put! Put!\u300dThe bolts nailed themselves into the Ogre Devourer\u2019s skin. Its health was gradually being chipped away as it repeatedly roared and brandished its club, smashing it at Nie Yan.\u300cCrash!\u300dThe club smacked the large tree. Nie Yan had leapt backwards and avoided the attack. It was unable to harm even a single hair on his body.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64 - Slow DeathPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 64 - Slow Death\u300cWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u300dAnother three bolts pinned themselves on the Ogre Devourer, eliciting furious roars that brought over two normal Ogres.Now this was a bit troubling. Nie Yan glimpsed at the Ogre Devourer\u2019s health bar\u2014only a third remained after thirty minutes. If he put aside this Sub-Elite monster to deal with the normal Ogres, its health would return to full, and his work would go to waste. Whatever! Finish it off first!Nie Yan accelerated his rate of fire as the two normal Ogres joined into the battlefield. The pressure he felt rose precipitously.There was no end to the three monsters\u2019 pursuit. They made attempts to surround and kill him, but they underestimated his agility. He was as slippery as a loach; through the gaps between several large trees, he shot bolts that seemingly came from nowhere.An enraged roar came from the Ogre Devourer\u2019s throat, and it swung its enormous club at Nie Yan\u2014but the swipe could not reach him. The two normal Ogres weren\u2019t of any help to the Ogre Devourer either due to Nie Yan\u2019s meticulous pathing. Not only that, they even became obstructions. Every time it attempted to move, there were two Ogres blocking its way like brainless pigs.Nie Yan was unperturbed by his perilous surroundings. When he prepared to fire another round of bolts between the trees with one knee on the ground, the Ogre Devourer\u2019s eyes suddenly emitted another dark-red light.Shit, it\u2019s Petrifying Gaze again!Nie Yan put away his crossbow and rolled under the cover of the trees.MISS!Nie Yan now had a greater understanding of Petrifying Gaze after successfully avoiding the skill three times\u2014he\u2019d be able to dodge so long as he hid behind a tree when it started casting.Before he even found his footing, however, a massive shadow loomed from above. One of the two Ogres had circled behind Nie Yan, avoiding his detection entirely, and its enormous club strewn with nails smashed down.Nie Yan didn\u2019t have the slightest thought of staying still; he threw himself forward, out of the club\u2019s range of attack.\u300cBoom!\u300dThe impact left a small pit and sent fragments of stone and dirt into the air.Nie Yan had no issues imagining his fate if he had delayed by even a second.The knockback effect from the Ogre\u2019s attack would have sent him flying.Disastrous consequences would occur during the two seconds it\u2019d take to travel through the air, fall to the ground, and climb back up.Nie Yan regained his stability, but much to his surprise, he had been surrounded by the three Ogres during that time. With their clubs raised high into the air, the Ogre Devourer and two normal Ogres approached steadily.I\u2019m done for. It seems that this is the end of the line. Such an accident was beyond his expectations. He swept his gaze over the surroundings: his path had been completely sealed by several large trees and the three Ogres. There was no escape in sight.The Ogre Devourer bellowed and a deafening roar reverberated through the forest. It raised its club, then slammed it down at Nie Yan.Within the blink of an eye, a spiked club covered his entire field of view\u2014he could even see the individual nails embedded in the wood. Nie Yan tried retreating; however, the two Ogres flanked him from behind. His situation couldn\u2019t be any direr and his heart felt like it was going to burst out his chest. In the brief moments before his seemingly imminent demise, he happened to notice the branches in the tree above.They were roughly eight meters from the ground and flourished with leaves of a vibrant green. However ordinary they were, they seemed like an extension of a holy tree.\ud83c\udd63\ud83c\udd57\ud83c\udd58\ud83c\udd62 \ud83c\udd52\ud83c\udd57\ud83c\udd50\ud83c\udd5f\ud83c\udd63\ud83c\udd54\ud83c\udd61 \ud83c\udd64\ud83c\udd5f\ud83c\udd5b\ud83c\udd5e\ud83c\udd50\ud83c\udd53 \ud83c\udd55\ud83c\udd58\ud83c\udd61\ud83c\udd62\ud83c\udd63 \ud83c\udd50\ud83c\udd63 \ud83c\udd5d\ud83c\udd5e\ud83c\udd65\ud83c\udd54\ud83c\udd5b-\ud83c\udd51\ud83c\udd58\ud83c\udd5d.\ud83c\udd52\ud83c\udd5e\ud83c\udd5cThere! Nie Yan leapt to the side, slipping away from the Ogre Devourer\u2019s club. He put full force into his legs and jumped, simultaneously shooting a line of webbing from the Silk Spinner Ring.The power of his jump brought him three meters in the air, while the Silk Spinner Ring ejected a line of webbing of roughly five meters\u2019 length.The line of webbing shot through the gaps between the leaves and stuck on the branches. He was suspended in the air, but with a nearby foothold, he leapt up again and flew past the Ogre Devourer\u2019s head.\u300cBoom! Boom! Boom!\u300d Three clubs smashed onto Nie Yan\u2019s position, sending dirt and pebbles scattering into the airHowever, no blood nor flesh stained the ground.All three Ogres\u2019 attacks struck naught but air and earth; their dazed expressions revealed their confusion.Upon landing, Nie Yan bolted to build up some distance. He stopped between two trees and knelt. With his right hand supporting the crossbow and his left finger over the trigger, he shot three bolts.\u300cPut! Put! Put!\u300dAlthough the Ogre Devourer had briefly lost its target, the oncoming attack prompted it to turn its head towards Nie Yan, whereupon it raised its club and charged.Contrary to expectations, Nie Yan did not stop shooting, even when the Ogre Devourer had approached.Seeing as the enormous club was about to crush him, Nie Yan didn\u2019t dare to hesitate. He rolled to the side and evaded the Ogre Devourer\u2019s attack.Its health had already been dropping quickly, and since Nie Yan now intensified his assault, the Ogre Devourer would soon fall.Only forty or so health remained. Nie Yan circled to the Ogre Devourer\u2019s back and withdrew his crossbow. He unsheathed his dagger and pounced at this Sub-Elite monster.Vital Strike!Lacerate!Taking advantage of the few moments the Ogre Devourer took to turn its head, Nie Yan\u2019s dagger left deep gashes on its back and scarlet blood stained the air and earth.Nie Yan\u2019s new set of equipment raised his attack significantly. In addition to the extra thirty percent given to a Thief when striking monsters from the back, he dealt fairly impressive damage.As it felt a sharp pain shoot up from its back, the Ogre Devourer waved its club and let out a miserable roar.Due to his honed reflexes, Nie Yan ducked his head as he could sense an object quickly flying towards his head.\u300cVOOM!\u300dA giant club swiped over his head, only missing by a hair\u2019s breadth.Phew! Too close. He raised his dagger and struck the Ogre Devourer\u2019s chest with Assassinate.At last, the final sliver of its health dwindled away. A short stagger, then its colossal figure collapsed.\u300cBANG!\u300dDust rose into the air and gently floated amidst the thunderous noise.From the side, the two remaining Ogres charged towards Nie Yan. He quickly fished the items from the Ogre Devourer\u2019s corpse and backed away swiftly before he retrieved his crossbow and fired rapidly while darting between the trees. The normal Ogres\u2019 strengths weren\u2019t all that noteworthy, nor were their health points even close to the Ogre Devourer\u2019s. So, when facing the assault of Nie Yan\u2019s fire, they both fell to the ground in quick succession.The party of Ogres was now dead, finally allowing Nie Yan a brief respite. Another field boss down. If it weren\u2019t for such an ingenious method of killing monsters, there was absolutely no chance Nie Yan, with such a great disparity in levels, could have challenged that Sub-Elite monster and come out alive. This was the culmination of countless players\u2019 knowledge in his past life.He glanced at his experience bar\u2014it had risen greatly once again. The Ogre Devourer had thick skin, high health, strong attacks, and a special ability: Petrifying Gaze. As a result of all those factors, the experience received was naturally a generous amount. By killing the Ogre Devourer, Nie Yan received a tenfold experience bonus as a reward\u2014his experience bar rose by thirty-seven percent, and he was now Level 5 with nearly three-fourths of his experience bar filled.Nie Yan had only killed one Elite monster and one Sub-Elite monster\u2014Gato the Lion King and the Ogre Devourer respectively\u2014yet the amount of experience other players obtained after grinding for several days could not even come close to what he received from those two monsters. His level was rising like a rocket! One would never feel greater satisfaction in grinding normal monsters than killing Elite monsters levels above themself. Unfortunately, there were quite few Elite creatures that could be killed by using terrain bugs or special techniques, and since Elite monsters had quite a long respawn rate, Nie Yan could only take this slowly.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65 - Crossbow of BloodPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 65 - Crossbow of BloodNie Yan would have to wait until tomorrow for Gato the Lion King and the Ogre Devourer to respawn. As for leveling, his speed was already sufficiently quick so there was no need to grind normal monsters. With the time remaining, he could do some small businesses on the side.The Ogre Devourer dropped a total of two items, both of which were rather decent.Crossbow of Blood (Gold): Single-handed CrossbowRequirements: Level 5Properties: Attack +11, 10% Armour-piercing Effect, Triple-shot.Shooting Speed: 16, Deviation 3%.Restriction: NoneStaff of Moonlight Worship (Gold)Requirements: Level 5Properties: Attack 32\u201338, Level Three Holy Explosion. 20% extra damage against demons.Restriction: Holy Mages; can only be equipped by a member of the Righteous Faction.Nie Yan had challenged the high-level Elites alone and had successfully defeated them despite the level gap. As such, the chances of receiving additional drops were multiplied and reasonably, the system\u2019s rewards were especially munificent. Nie Yan had acquired four pieces of Gold-tier equipment by now, and every single piece was extraordinary\u2014the Crossbow of Blood particularly. It brought a great surprise to him; the ten percent armour-piercing effect was fairly decent.When compared to such a substantially superior crossbow, the one in Nie Yan\u2019s current possession was of such a poor quality that there was absolutely no need to hesitate in switching. When comparing goods, there would always be one inferior. The crossbow bought from the NPC had finished its quest. It had served him well, and its times of glory were now coming to an end.Thus, Nie Yan equipped the Crossbow of Blood. As for the old one, it should still fetch some money on the auction. It had a price tag of thirty-seven copper coins when he bought it, so its resale value should be some dozen copper coins.Nie Yan returned to Calore, having finished examining the new equipment he acquired. There were quite a few people within the city, but the vast majority of players had gone outside for leveling. The streets were bustling with people, many of whom were visiting Jaden\u2019s shop, the high-level Alchemist, on the corner. All players who exhausted their stock of potions when leveling outside had to replenish their supply at that place.The auction house that sat in the heart of the city teemed with an even greater number of people. On the nearby streets, many players laid out their booths and once in a while, some eye-catching items would appear.Nie Yan entered the auction house and sold off equipment he no longer had any use for. He also continued buying all available Black Phenol Formulas, Black Phenol, and the ingredients required. He left nothing unbought. After the opening of the new instance tomorrow, many guilds would go and spearhead the investigation. They would discover, to their amazement, that all traces of the low-priced and relatively unknown Black Phenol had vanished. Alchemists would occasionally produce several bottles of Black Phenol, but they\u2019d be bought before one even had time to blink. As for the Black Phenol Nie Yan collected... they became commodities worth being stockpiled. He could starve the marketplace and slowly rid himself of the Black Phenol and Black Phenol Formulas bit by bit, thus inflating the prices. The larger the development into the new instance, the greater the players\u2019 need for Black Phenol, and the easier the prices would rise. He could start by first selling Black Phenol and its ingredients, then he\u2019d sell the formula at the later stages. He could gather a large sum of wealth with a method like this. Other investment options would be considered only after earning the money since he had spent quite a sum purchasing Black Phenol.As usual, Nie Yan went over to several small towns to collect Bat Teeth. He sold them off and earned thirty or so silver coins. He even bought most of the Bat Teeth on the marketplace, and he was now waiting for players to continue grinding. When they came by more Bat Teeth, he would return.However, Nie Yan felt slightly puzzled because he hadn\u2019t even bought a single set of Bat Teeth at Link. Odd, as it was one of the larger sources of Bat Teeth.\u201cMr. Kade, these are the Bat Teeth you asked for.\u201d\u201cSir Nie Yan (Nirvana Flame), I am grateful for your assistance.\u201dAfter Nie Yan\u2019s Influence in Calore had been raised, the NPC started using honourifics with him. It was evident as Kade was much more amiable.He came out of Kade\u2019s store, the high-level Blacksmith. Nie Yan raised his head and saw a Paladin with Silver armour entering with a hammer in his hand.This person seemed a bit over thirty years old. He was very tall and a bit fat; he had quite a unique appearance.The Paladin looked at Nie Yan with a cautious gaze. They brushed past each other before the Paladin walked into Blacksmith Kade\u2019s store and went to chat with him.Nie Yan recalled this person: he was the Paladin who discovered the blacksmith quest in his past life\u2014the person who made over ten gold coins. The person who truly discovered this Bat Teeth quest had arrived, increasing the total number who knew of this money-making method to two.If there were two people simultaneously collecting Bat Teeth, one would raise the prices to increase competition. The opposing side would raise the prices as well, and it would turn into a repeated back-and-forth situation until the profits became marginal. The players would also begin to suspect whether the Bat Teeth held special uses and thus start holding onto them. Last time, there was a Thief that followed Nie Yan and now, there were a total of two players buying Bat Teeth for high prices. That would elicit more suspicion and soon, someone would follow that Paladin and Blacksmith Kade would be revealed.I won\u2019t be making much profit of off this quest any longer.But to Nie Yan, Kade\u2019s Bat Teeth quest was now dispensable. He had already acquired sufficient starting capital, and he also had many other methods of making money. This quest was not a necessity for him.Nie Yan checked his total assets: there were over sixty silver coins in his bag, and there were also large amounts of Black Phenol, its ingredients, and the formulas, all of which were going to inflate exponentially in value.It was absolutely fine even if he lost this source of income.\ud83c\udd63\ud83c\udd57\ud83c\udd58\ud83c\udd62 \ud83c\udd52\ud83c\udd57\ud83c\udd50\ud83c\udd5f\ud83c\udd63\ud83c\udd54\ud83c\udd61 \ud83c\udd64\ud83c\udd5f\ud83c\udd5b\ud83c\udd5e\ud83c\udd50\ud83c\udd53 \ud83c\udd55\ud83c\udd58\ud83c\udd61\ud83c\udd62\ud83c\udd63 \ud83c\udd50\ud83c\udd63 \ud83c\udd5d\ud83c\udd5e\ud83c\udd65\ud83c\udd54\ud83c\udd5b-\ud83c\udd51\ud83c\udd58\ud83c\udd5d.\ud83c\udd52\ud83c\udd5e\ud83c\udd5cWithout even realizing it, he arrived at the Alchemist Guild\u2019s entrance after finding his way through the crowd. His mind had been wandering about before a vender disrupted his thoughts.\u201cHigh-level potion ingredients and a Swift Retreat skill book for Thieves! It\u2019s a pretty decent skill book! This brother here, would you like to have a look?\u201d yelled a white-robed Holy Mage. He had laid out a booth at the Alchemist Guild\u2019s entrance, and when Nie Yan passed by, his eyes brightened. He decided to draw attention to himself.The Holy Mage was a shrewd person. With a glimpse, he knew Nie Yan\u2019s equipment wasn\u2019t common gear and several of them were quite high-quality. This skill book, Swift Retreat, was something good for early-level Thieves. However, it went for a rather expensive price\u2014he demanded a silver.Obviously, it was tough to find a buyer for such a costly item. If it were put on the auction, he\u2019d likely find someone but he would only receive money and there was even a fee! The reason he chose to set this booth here was because he wanted to trade this skill book for Holy Mage equipment. His chances were greatly increased while people were converging here to form groups for the new instance.Normal Thieves simply couldn\u2019t afford to buy such a skill book. As a result, even though he had been yelling for twenty minutes and there were Thieves who came up to inquire the prices, they all shook their head as they departed. However, the Holy Mage couldn\u2019t help but call out for Nie Yan since he appeared rather well-off.Nie Yan turned his head around and glanced at the Holy Mage. With an ash-black staff in his hand, he was clad in a white mage robe and seemed to be around twenty years of age. With his sharp judgement, Nie Yan instantly recognized his equipment. The robe he wore was called the Holy Walker and the ash-black staff was the Wind of the Fallen Moon. Although these weren\u2019t the best equipment at this level, they were still rather decent.\u201cYou\u2019re pretty lucky! Swift Retreat dropped for you,\u201d Nie Yan said, faintly smiling. It was a very useful skill.\u201cYeah! My luck\u2019s always been good. I have a few friends who were grinding for several days at Holy Canyon, yet they haven\u2019t even gotten anything good. I, on the other hand, just grinded for three hours and this Swift Retreat dropped! Right now, one of these is even more expensive than a Silver-grade equipment on the marketplace!\u201d Nie Yan\u2019s response to the Holy Mage\u2019s advertisement immediately triggered this chatterbox. He was like a radio that had been turned on!62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66 - Godslayer of YorePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 66 - Godslayer of Yore\u201cThe Holy Apostles at the Holy Monastery have pretty decent drop rates. Have you guys gone there? Assuming your group cleared that instance, you should have more than just the Swift Retreat skill book. Just wondering... do you have the Desperate Strike skill book as well?\u201d Nie Yan asked in a casual tone. Since the other party had Swift Retreat, he might as well try to procure the other skill book he needed.The Holy Mage was momentarily dazed upon hearing his mention of the Holy Monastery. He examined Nie Yan from head to toe and shook his head. \u201cNo, we\u2019re far from being able to obtain a Desperate Strike skill book. We haven\u2019t gone there yet because the monsters are too strong for us. Friend, seeing as your equipment is good, I take it that you\u2019ve already cleared dungeons around that level?\u201d\u201cNo, I just know a bit about it. I\u2019ve never gone there myself. Anyway, how much for the skill book?\u201d Despite his disappointment obtaining Swift Retreat wasn\u2019t too bad either.The Holy Mage felt a little skeptical. Most players who wore such good equipment should have already been through every dungeon at least once. Moreover, as a Thief player, how could Nie Yan not have entered the Holy Monastery? The dungeon was practically brimming with all sorts of Thief items, and it was a location all expert-level Thieves visited at least once.\u201cI\u2019m looking to trade this skill book for equipment. Elementalist, Holy Mage, or Paladin equipment; any of those are fine,\u201d the Holy Mage replied. He believed that the value of the Swift Retreat skill book was sufficient for several pieces of equipment.Nie Yan made an awkward expression. He had already thrown all the equipment he didn\u2019t need up on the auction house. The only equipment he had right now was the Staff of Moonlight Worship, but he didn\u2019t know if Yao Yao (Dark Mystery) wanted it or not.\u201cI can still sell it to you instead of trading if you don\u2019t have equipment. Give me an offer my friend! If it\u2019s reasonable, it\u2019s yours. My name is Godslayer of Yore. There might be some distance between us right now, but second encounters will bring us closer. Even if our trade fails, I hope we\u2019ll remain on good terms!\u201d He noticed the other party\u2019s calm demeanor, and he considered his own judgement to be decent; therefore, he felt that Nie Yan was definitely an expert.\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd42 \ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd41 \ud83c\udd44\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd3b\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd33 \ud83c\udd35\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd41\ud83c\udd42\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd3d\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd45\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd3b-\ud83c\udd31\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd3d.\ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd3cGodslayer of Yore...? Of the people he knew, Nie Yan vaguely recalled of hearing such a player in the past. Though just slightly famous, Godslayer of Yore was known for having gotten into a conflict with Victorious Return at some point. He and his friends massacred several hundred members of their guild, only to vanish into thin air afterward. Alas, solo players who didn\u2019t have strong backings were destined to always be met with setbacks if they tried to take on a guild.Numerous players had suffered at the hands of Victorious Return, Nie Yan himself being one such person. And perhaps because he felt they had experienced similar fates, he now held a more favourable impression of Godslayer of Yore. At that point in time, Godslayer of Yore\u2019s fame outstripped his by a great margin. He had chosen to fight, unlike Nie Yan and his friends who had no choice but to hole up in the mountain ravines when they were being hunted by Victorious Return. \u201cI\u2019m Nie Yan (Nirvana Flame). Since you want me to make an offer for the skill book... One silver and fifty coppers; how does that sound?\u201d Nie Yan was rather wealthy so he could offer a high price without even batting an eye.No matter how expensive the Swift Retreat skill book became, it certainly wouldn\u2019t be worth more than one silver and fifty coppers.\u201cThat\u2019s too much. Even this skill book wouldn\u2019t be sold at such a high price. One silver\u2019s enough.\u201d Godslayer of Yore didn\u2019t shy away from Nie Yan\u2019s frank and straightforward attitude. Since the other side wanted to befriend him, why shouldn\u2019t he reciprocate? Inside the game, having another friend meant having another option. Be it trading equipment or forming a team for a raid, befriending a few more experts would make all these things much easier.\u201cHow many people are in your group?\u201d Nie Yan asked. Since he needed a team to run dungeons, he\u2019d eventually have to find some members to form one. Perhaps he could follow Godslayer of Yore and his friends into a dungeon run.The game had just recently opened, so the number of players who had fixed teams were quite few. As for experts, they needed to carefully choose the right team before entering any instances. However, good teams were hard to come by. Thus, many of these players who were looking for teams were likely to group together to form one.Nie Yan\u2019s inquiry brightened Godslayer of Yore\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou want to run a dungeon? I have six people on my side. They\u2019re all classmates from the same university and decently skilled. We have five players who are Level 4 and one that\u2019s Level 6, but he always runs dungeons with other people. However, he\u2019ll definitely come with us if we call him since we\u2019re all classmates. Our group is divided into one Berserker, three Mages, and two Paladins.\u201d\u201cI might make a team, but I haven\u2019t made any plans for now. Depending on the circumstances, we\u2019ll see when the time comes,\u201d Nie Yan said with a light smile.\u201cOh...\u201d Godslayer of Yore felt slightly disappointed, but Nie Yan\u2019s answer made more sense after some thinking. After all, forming a team wasn\u2019t an easy affair. \u201cOur equipment is more than a little lacking. So, it\u2019ll be somewhat inconvenient for us to run the lower level dungeons just to improve our gear. Not to mention, with the way our group is composed, we often can\u2019t find a team to join.\u201d\u201cThe equipment isn\u2019t a problem. How about this? When I find some more people in the future, I\u2019ll come looking for you guys, alright?\u201d Nie Yan replied then sent a friend request to Godslayer of Yore.\u201cNo worries. Just call me whenever you\u2019re ready!\u201d Godslayer of Yore\u2019s heart was filled with expectation.Nie Yan felt if he wanted to continue developing in the future, it was a must that he secured his own team. While finding the right players was a troublesome matter, randomly picking people off the streets would often lead to mixed results. It would be a tragedy if he ended up recruiting a bottom-feeder who didn\u2019t put in any effort and impeded the team instead. However, this sort of matter should be set aside for after he formed the team. In any case, even if they were bad eggs, all he needed to do was kick them.Since Godslayer of Yore insisted on one silver, he didn\u2019t argue any further and bought the skill book for that price. Swift Retreat was an escape skill. In other words, it was a skill used in a situation where a player couldn\u2019t beat an opponent and chose to run\u2014a situation that was fairly common. Swift Retreat increased a Thief\u2019s movement speed by thirty percent for one minute when escaping, enabling them to quickly put some distance between their pursuers or even completely escape. Occasionally, such skills aided the player in avoiding a disaster.Nie Yan continued to chat with Godslayer of Yore. In any case, he wasn\u2019t in a hurry to level because there were plenty of opportunities out there. It was a matter of time before he\u2019d catch up with those top ranked players.\u201cWhere did you guys find so many medicinal plants?\u201d Nie Yan asked. He noticed that plants occupied the majority of items for sale in Godslayer of Yore\u2019s booth.\u201cWe can\u2019t help it. Three of the members in our five-player group learned the Gatherer skill. We didn\u2019t really train much and picked herbs instead,\u201d Godslayer of Yore replied and forced out a somewhat helpless smile.Nie Yan more or less understood what he meant. For players without a guild, if they didn\u2019t improve other side skills such as Gatherer, they\u2019d have a difficult time keeping up. Godslayer of Yore he was doing well for himself since he could equip Holy Walker and Wind of the Fallen Moon. His equipment was even better than many players who joined guilds.Nie Yan pondered for a moment. He thought about the people he could call when he wanted to form his own team. There was Tang Yao, Godslayer of Yore, and his five friends. As for a good Fighter, he wasn\u2019t confident that Bladelight would come. However, since he was selling the Lion King\u2019s Shield to Bladelight, it was certain he would reciprocate this favour by giving face. Perhaps he could call a few others to join as well. After that, he could recruit a few strangers to fill the remaining spots and form a passable team.\u201cNo wonder you set up next to the Alchemist Guild\u2019s doorway!\u201d Nie Yan laughed. Only Alchemists would want so many medicinal ingredients. \u201cYou keep on selling your things then. I\u2019ll be taking my leave. We\u2019ll talk some other time!\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d Godslayer of Yore replied.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67 - Alchemy KingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 67 - Alchemy KingAmidst Godslayer of Yore and Nie Yan\u2019s farewell, two players near the entrance of the Alchemist Guild erupted into a heated argument. One of the quarrelers, a young man who looked barely twenty, wore plain cotton clothing and the Alchemist Guild\u2019s badge on his chest. His level was low, so most likely he was only an apprentice in the guild. The other quarreler, an Elementalist who looked to be in his thirties, wore equipment of much higher quality. Tall and robust, he dwarfed his opposition so much that the Apprentice Alchemist seemed like a child.\u201cThe failure in concocting isn\u2019t my fault this time!\u201d\u201cNot your fault? Are you implying it\u2019s mine!?\u201d\u201cYes! They set me up to fail when I was concocting!\u201d\u201cPeh! Our captain provided you with so many ingredients, yet they were all turned into useless garbage. We can\u2019t even recoup our losses! I heard you got lucky and learned some sort of hidden skill. Good, get lucky and get out of my sight before I make you eat shit too!\u201d Obscenities and curses poured out of the Elementalist\u2019s mouth. The moment he finished speaking, he slapped the Apprentice Alchemist in the face and knocked several alchemy tools and other items to the ground.The slap sent the Apprentice Alchemist tumbling down the guild entrance staircase. As he lay sprawled out, he lifted his head and hatefully glared at the Elementalist.\u201cAhhh!? What the hell are you staring at? You got something to say? Keep staring and I\u2019ll make you eat the dirt even harder! Get lost!\u201d The Elementalist\u2019s eyes bulged out of their sockets as he glared threateningly at the Apprentice Alchemist.The Apprentice Alchemist glanced at the Elementalist once more. Eventually, he lowered his eyes and silently collected his tools off the floor.\u201cBitch!\u201d The Elementalist stamped on the Apprentice Alchemist\u2019s chest and knocked him back to the ground. The Apprentice Alchemist didn\u2019t retaliate; he remained silent, simply staggering back to his knees and continued picking up his things....\u201cIsn\u2019t he too much of a pushover? After being kicked, he didn\u2019t even make a sound!\u201d Godslayer of Yore couldn\u2019t help voicing his opinion. The scene had left a bad taste in his mouth.\u201cThe way he dealt with the situation isn\u2019t wrong. Right now, he probably has no choice but to endure. I believe by the time he rises in standing, it still won\u2019t necessarily be too late for him to retaliate,\u201d Nie Yan said with a peculiar expression in his eye. Despite taking on the abuse, the determination still hadn\u2019t faded from the Apprentice Alchemist\u2019s eyes. Those who could patiently tolerate were especially terrifying.Godslayer of Yore tilted his head back to look at Nie Yan. Those words took him by surprise. Nie Yan was likely someone similar to himself, a person who refused to be on the short end of the stick. If anyone were to offend him, then they would definitely be met with an appropriate retaliation. However, Godslayer of Yore suddenly saw Nie Yan\u2019s expression change to pleasant surprise. He was gazing at the apprentice Alchemist like he found some kind of treasure.\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd42 \ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd41 \ud83c\udd44\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd3b\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd33 \ud83c\udd35\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd41\ud83c\udd42\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd3d\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd45\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd3b-\ud83c\udd31\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd3d.\ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd3c\u201cSo it was him... It really is true; be they enemies or friends, both are bound to be met on a narrow path!\u201d Nie Yan muttered to himself in a low voice. He recognized this Apprentice Alchemist, but it wasn\u2019t because they were friends. No, rather they were enemies. If things stayed on course, this person would eventually become one of Victorious Return\u2019s most faithful dogs. In his original timeline, over a tenth of Victorious Return\u2019s various high-level potions, pills, tonics, and other concoctions were prepared by this one person; several of which could only be concocted by him.Nie Yan had suffered heavily due to the oppressive manpower Victorious Return possessed, but those vile concoctions were also one of the factors that led to his many defeats. While in the wilderness, he had once encountered a squadron of Victorious Return members. At that time, he was unaware those players were escorting this Alchemist on a quest, and usually, he and his friends wouldn\u2019t be at a disadvantage when facing off against such a group. However, beyond their imaginations, each and every one of those players had taken out some crafty, eccentric pill that bolstered their combat power by many times. Under the effects of those pills, he and his friends were beaten to a wretched state.The Apprentice Alchemist before him was called Bird Leaves No Eggs. Owing to the fact that his name was unpleasant to the ears, as the \u201cBird\u201d in his name could also be read as \u201cPenis,\u201d the members of Victorious Return didn\u2019t feel comfortable addressing him directly by name. Thus, they gave him the nickname of Alchemy King. This title was rather suitable, considering the numerous contributions his concoctions brought to the guild.However, at this moment, Bird was merely an Apprentice Alchemist. He had just been kicked, both literally and figuratively, out of the Dark Hero guild. In a month\u2019s time, Victorious Return would recruit and attach great importance to him due to their guild leader showing him kindness and recognizing his worth. This was the reason for his unwavering loyalty and dedication to the guild. In other words, he was a person who did have somewhat of a moral compass.Even if he\u2019s the Alchemy King, he\u2019s only an Apprentice Alchemist right now... Whether he\u2019ll be worth the investment remains to be seen. Nie Yan pondered for a while. Bird\u2019s success wouldn\u2019t have been possible without Victorious Return\u2019s generous support. They had supplied him with an ample amount of alchemic ingredients and slowly nurtured him until he became the Alchemy King in both title and ability, to the extent his name resounded throughout the entire Atlanta continent.After considering his current financial resources, Nie Yan decided fostering the Alchemy King would pose absolutely no problems. If he wished to succeed in the future, he needed to slowly build up his influence in the present. He wanted to set up his own line of businesses in the game: an alchemy store, equipment shop, auction house... he couldn\u2019t lack a single one. However, what he was in most urgent need of was talented people, and fortunately, an opportunity to recruit one such person had presented itself. He felt taking Bird under his wing would undoubtedly be the correct choice.The Elementalist departed after abusing Bird a few more times, his mouth still spitting out obscenities as he walked away.While Bird picked up his tools, he lifted his head and coldly swept his gaze over the Elementalist\u2019s back.A few moments later...\u201cHey! What was that Elementalist\u2019s name?\u201d Nie Yan asked as he walked up to Bird\u2019s side. He slightly bent his knees and overlooked Bird who was still tidying up the mess.\u201cRazor. Why does this concern you?\u201d Bird glanced at Nie Yan.\u201cIt concerns me because it concerns you. Tell me, don\u2019t you feel humiliated? Don\u2019t you want revenge? However, you\u2019re powerless, and those without power are destined to walk down the path of being disdained by others. Follow me, and I can have them see you in a different light. I can make them regret ever offending you with today\u2019s actions.\u201d\u201cWhy should I trust you?\u201d Bird replied in a suspicious tone. He raised his head and stared at Nie Yan with sharp focus. He couldn\u2019t comprehend such a sudden appearance. A stranger had just walked up to him and wanted to recruit him after a single exchange. Wasn\u2019t that just a little bit too conspicuous and bizarre?\u201cMy intuition is telling me you\u2019re not some sort of useless waste. After being kicked out of your guild, you probably feel quite resentful, correct? Well... I just wanted to see if you had the determination and ability to confirm that assessment. Besides, you\u2019re broke and have nothing to your name. From the moment I approached, I had nothing to gain in scamming you, no?\u201d Nie Yan finished his speech, turned around, and began walking away.During his departure, he anticipated the moment when Bird would run up from behind and catch up. If this was the Alchemy King he knew from the past, then Bird wouldn\u2019t let this opportunity slip by once it presented itself in front of him.\u201cWait up!\u201dNie Yan faintly smiled.Bird had resolved himself when he saw Nie Yan\u2019s back farther and farther away, his expression betraying the conflicting emotions in his heart. He had just been miserably humiliated and shunned by the Dark Hero guild. This was a disgrace he would never forget. He held an extreme wariness towards Nie Yan, because he wasn\u2019t completely clear on his intentions. Moreover, the sudden appearance was rather odd. Despite this, one point remained certain\u2014he was completely broke and penniless. Even his funds in real life were barely enough for him to live for two or three more months before being kicked out. Those who walked in bare feet didn\u2019t fear others in shoes; in other words, he had nothing to lose so he wasn\u2019t afraid. So what if he was swindled? What other choice did he have?Belonging to the lowest rung of society, he was a cockroach who held the will to survive. As long as someone gave him a lifeline to hold onto, he would continue to live on.Bird struggled back onto his feet and followed Nie Yan.Godslayer of Yore witnessed all the entire course of events while still sitting beside his items laid on the ground. He stared pensively at their receding silhouette and felt that Nie Yan\u2019s ambitions couldn\u2019t be satisfied by merely forming a team. However, this was good as well. There would be plenty of shade under a big tree. Increased influence also came with increased benefits....\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d Bird asked, while following Nie Yan\u2019s footsteps. Besides concocting, there was nothing else he was good at. Even then, he would still end up messing up the simplest of recipes when creating medicines. He couldn\u2019t count how many materials he ended up squandering. If not, why else would he have been kicked from his guild?\u201cNaturally, it\u2019s still concocting. Out of curiosity, what was that hidden skill that Elementalist mentioned?\u201d Nie Yan asked, while continuing to walk.\u201cAfter successfully concocting a potion, pill, tonic, or other medicines, there\u2019s a two percent chance of strengthening its effects.\u201d Bird quickened his footsteps. As he followed from behind, he didn\u2019t know why but he had a strong premonition, from the moment he decided to chase after Nie Yan, that his destiny had subtly changed. He didn\u2019t know what the future held, whether it was good or bad, but he was sure of one thing... He had already made his choice, and he was going to walk down the path he chose.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Not a bad hidden skill.\u201d\u201cBut what use does it have for me? When I concoct pills, my success rate is only a third of those around me! If someone came looking for me to create a pill, potion, or whatever, it\u2019d only be a fluke if I succeed!\u201d\u201cSince I took the effort to recruit you, naturally it means I believe in you. If you\u2019re willing to follow me, sign this agreement.\u201d Within the game world of Conviction, any contract was valid as long as it was within the scope of the real world\u2019s laws.Bird suspiciously glanced at the contract in Nie Yan\u2019s hands before taking it and carefully reading over its contents. As he slowly read it through, word for word and line by line, he realized the clauses were rather simple. In layman\u2019s terms, Nie Yan would provide him with the ingredients and materials required to train his Alchemy. In exchange, jurisdiction over how his creations\u2014pills, elixirs, tonics, potions, and so on\u2014were used would all be decided by Nie Yan. Moreover, he would receive a thirty percent share if the sales of his concoctions produced a net profit.The conditions on this contract were roughly the same as the ones given by guilds when they recruited an Alchemist. However, he could see one key difference: the contract Nie Yan presented him stated a thirty percent cut. In contrast, nearly every guild would only share twenty percent of the revenue at most, even if the Alchemist was highly valued. In terms of benefits, Nie Yan\u2019s terms were much more generous than those guilds. Yet, nurturing an Alchemist gave rise to enormous expenditures, all of which would be taken on by Nie Yan. The number of responsibilities he needed to assume were staggering.\u201cThis contract... You\u2019re really willing to let me sign this contract under these terms?\u201d Bird asked, his heart stirring with emotion. Even if you searched high and low, it would still be quite difficult to find such generous terms.\u201cMhmm.\u201d\u201cSince the moment I learned Alchemy, I\u2019ve always been a failure in concocting. Why else would have my guild kicked me? Calculating the worth of all those medicinal ingredients I\u2019ve destroyed to this day, it would probably reach two silvers at the very least! Please don\u2019t blame me if you end up making a loss. Consider carefully; it\u2019s still not too late to renege on this.\u201d Bird presented the contract back to Nie Yan, gesturing he could take it back. As the piece of paper fluttered in his hands, he felt a mix of apprehension and anxiousness in his heart. What if Nie Yan were to take it back? What would he do then?\u201cI\u2019m not lacking in money. Even if I make a loss, then so be it. I know how to recognize my own faults. However... my insight has never been wrong. Rarely do I ever make mistakes when it comes to these things.\u201d\u201cStill... Isn\u2019t thirty percent too high of a price to pay for me?\u201d Bird\u2019s voice was lacking in confidence. Even in those guilds that paid well, their Alchemists would still receive no more than twenty percent.\u201cIt\u2019s already been decided. I believe you\u2019re worth the price,\u201d Nie Yan replied, waving his hand and motioned Bird to hurry up. To gain his absolute loyalty, it wouldn\u2019t do if he simply gave him money. No, Bird needed to have good will, and bolstering his confidence and making him feel appreciated was a good place to start.Bird truly didn\u2019t understand just where Nie Yan\u2019s trust in him came from. However, he could tell, from both actions and words, that Nie Yan believed in his ability. When a person was at their lowest point and felt like a failure, what they needed the most wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s pity, but rather only a single line of acknowledgement. Nie Yan\u2019s words were unremarkable; his tone was normal, and there was no hidden meaning. Yet they were able to bypass the guard Bird had raised and entered his heart.\u201cAlright.\u201d Bird paused for a moment to compose himself. \u201cI\u2019ll sign the contract! I\u2019m also fine with you lowering my share, but please don\u2019t blame me if you make a loss.\u201d Bird couldn\u2019t help but repeat the last clause as he gave his response.\u201cRest assured. Even if you fail, I won\u2019t blame or trouble you,\u201d Nie Yan replied in a calm tone. After travelling back to the past, he had absolute confidence in himself, and he certainly wouldn\u2019t be short on money, be it inside the game or real life. The first opening month of the game was merely the starting point of when the real world economy would connect to the in-game one. Roughly two and a half weeks later, in-game property would be available to purchase or bid on: shops, auction houses, land, and so on would all transform into privately owned entities. Various guilds backed by financial groups would certainly go into a bidding and buying frenzy for them. When real world currency could be converted into in-game currency and vice versa, the value of these properties would skyrocket. The players would discover the shops they bought for tens, hundreds, or even thousands of gold would go for millions, possibly even tens of millions of credits. As for auction houses, even if you listed them up for a hundred million credits, they would sell in an instant. This was the result of various large financial groups and adventure capitalists frantically investing in the scene. Nonetheless, owning a store or auction house truly would enable a player to reap enormous profits.By using prophetic foresight, earning a profit certainly wouldn\u2019t be a problem. Why would he be afraid of raising an Alchemist like Bird? Come the day this Apprentice Alchemist truly becomes the Alchemy King, his returns would be well worth the initial investment!The reason failure struck his father after he invested into Conviction was because... he had come too late! He had missed the opportunity to buy in-game properties before the real world and in-game economy fully connected. By the time his father entered the scene, the large financial groups had already long divided the game world\u2019s assets between themselves and formed stable markets. When his father tried to forcefully enter, he was inevitably met with an iron plate known as the large financial groups.Nie Yan entered Conviction before his father did in order to lay out a path. Only then could his family avert the tragedy that befell them in his original timeline.The number of tasks he needed to complete in the first month before the real world economy connected were many. He needed to amass great wealth, and he needed to coax others to join him so he could increase his influence. In the future, the properties he would need under his banner included equipment shops, alchemy shops, auction houses, banks, large amounts of land, and general stores. Although he possessed the enormous advantage of being from the future, he still understood the logic that a lone tree could only support so much. What did this world need the most? Talent! And in front of his eyes was one such talent! He had stolen Victorious Return\u2019s future Alchemy King from right under their noses, and he was now fostering their Alchemy King under his own banner! Weakening your enemies\u2019 strength while simultaneously increasing your own\u2014what reason could he possibly have in not doing this?The sole reason he became Bird\u2019s benefactor was because he wanted his loyalty and dedication.After receiving Nie Yan\u2019s unconditional trust, Bird couldn\u2019t deny that he wasn\u2019t at least somewhat swayed. He silently made his resolve. Come hell or high water, he would dedicate himself to Nie Yan in order to live up to that trust. He had been similar to a drowning person, in desperate need of a lifeline. The lifeline happened to be someone\u2019s acknowledgement, and Nie Yan happened to be the person who threw it. As for why Nie Yan would go out of his way to recruit him or trust in his ability so much, he didn\u2019t know. Though, he felt this was fine, because those questions no longer mattered to him. Bird grabbed hold of the game generated pen and scribbled his signature on the contract.Hereafter, all of Bird\u2019s crafting profession related expenses would be recorded by the system and covered by Nie Yan. In the event Bird violated his contract, he would have to pay an exorbitant fee. However, if Nie Yan voluntarily chose to null the contract on his own, he wouldn\u2019t receive a single cent from Bird.\u201cFollow me,\u201d Nie Yan said before directly heading to the auction house.\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd42 \ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd41 \ud83c\udd44\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd3b\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd33 \ud83c\udd35\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd41\ud83c\udd42\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd3d\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd45\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd3b-\ud83c\udd31\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd3d.\ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd3cAs he followed Nie Yan, he still had no clue what fate had in store for him. Am I really suitable as an Alchemist...? he wondered. In the future, if he still remained a failure, would Nie Yan tell him to pack it up and go? All these questions were like a riddle that lingered in his mind. The expenses required to improve the Alchemy skill were immense. Would Nie Yan really be able to provide him with the necessary supplies?...Two people, one in the front and the other in the back, entered the auction house.\u201cAs long as you concentrate on concocting, I\u2019ll be satisfied. Let me prepare a few ingredients and materials to start you off. If you run out, feel free to send me a message at any time,\u201d Nie Yan said. As they walked down the auction house\u2019s halls, he turned on his bidding device.Nie Yan began to sort through the prices of the goods and bought four bags in a row.\u201cWhy did you buy so many bags?\u201d\u201cHow could I not? An Alchemist\u2019s bag is too small.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re for me...?\u201d Bird asked in surprised tone. Out of the guild leaders he had met in the past, not a single one was willing to purchase these bags for their Alchemists. The only times these guild leaders would go out of their way to purchase various gifts were when the Alchemist was extraordinary or in danger of being snatched away by others.\u201cWho else would I be giving them to?\u201d Nie Yan replied in a matter-of-fact tone. He also purchased an entire set of Alchemy-related wares. They were of a higher quality and possessed the additional property of increasing an Alchemist\u2019s success rate by five percent when concocting. The price for the set cost him three silvers. Apart from the set of wares, he also purchased a large quantity of medicinal plants and formulas.Bird witnessed one item after another being purchased, and all of them were for him! Besides being surprised, he couldn\u2019t help but feel touched as well. He had good reason to be surprised too; Nie Yan was so wealthy! He felt truly fortunate to have found a backer with such large capital. The reason he felt touched was because Nie Yan was actually spending so much money for his sake! This boss of his was definitely worthy of his admiration and respect. However, at the same time, a certain question popped up in his head. Was Nie Yan certain he had to ability to return a profit?Nie Yan had a large sum of wealth in his pockets. He could use it to rapidly nurture Bird into the Alchemy King. In the coming years, a high-level Alchemist would become as precious as gold! Many of them would be valued at upwards of a hundred million credits. The Alchemy King in his original timeline had a worth in the several hundred millions, and out of all Alchemists, he was ranked number three!Considering his current financial strength, he didn\u2019t believe he wouldn\u2019t be able to nurture Bird into the king he was before.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69 - Sulgatas ShadowPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 69 - Sulgata\u2019s ShadowNie Yan\u2019s act of generosity proved effective at persuading this Apprentice Alchemist\u2019s heart, though the unbridled manner in which he spent his money held a much more devious purpose. The further he invested into Bird, the further he would become irrevocably bound to his ship, thus making it all the more difficult to leave. In the event Bird truly wanted to leave, he\u2019d have to pay an exorbitant price to do so, and considering his financial situation, trying to break away was basically impossible. In other words, Nie Yan had accomplished another one of his objectives.By the end of his shopping spree, he had bought Bird ten silvers\u2019 worth of alchemy recipes and a vast quantity of ingredients and materials, filling all five bags until they were practically bursting.\u201cHere, use these supplies for now. Even when I\u2019m not around, focus on raising your skill,\u201d Nie Yan said. These alchemical ingredients were enough to last Bird a long period of time.The bags packed to the brim with various plants and recipes moved Bird\u2019s emotions. No matter how much of an idiot he believed himself to be, he could tell these ingredients were more than enough to rank him up to a Junior Alchemist. His experiences with Nie Yan after his termination from the Dark Hero guild felt like being pulled out of the depths of hell and placed into heaven. There were even several instances he believed this to be simply nothing but a dream.\u201cYou show me such kindness... I don\u2019t really know how I could ever repay you. So for now, I\u2019ll simply say thanks,\u201d Bird said, his voice trembling in gratitude.\u201cEnough of that, these lines are getting too cheesy. It\u2019s not like I recruited you solely from the kindness of my heart; there was a purpose as well. As long as you earn me more money by becoming an Alchemy Master or even a Grandmaster, that\u2019ll be the best way to repay me,\u201d Nie Yan replied, waving him to stop. He couldn\u2019t help but ponder over a certain problem. After returning to the past, this was the first time he significantly changed history. Without Victorious Return\u2019s support in this timeline, would Bird still become a Grandmaster Alchemist? At the moment, he couldn\u2019t be sure since the answer wasn\u2019t yet clear. He could only try his best to make it happen. After all, every investment held their risks. \u201cNow that everything\u2019s settled, go and improve your Alchemy. I still have a lot of other business to attend to.\u201d\u201cGotcha, boss! I\u2019ll be excusing myself then,\u201d Bird answered. If he failed to attain any results even after spending so much of Nie Yan\u2019s money, he simply wouldn\u2019t have the dignity to show himself. From being kicked from his guild to being picked up by a stranger, an ember of hope and a certain desire had arisen from the ashes of his despair. Thus, he felt nothing but grateful towards this saviour of his.He expressed his gratitude once more and took his leave....Nie Yan paused for a moment and began to ponder. Such a chance encounter was analogous to having picked up a gem off the streets. Even if Bird couldn\u2019t reach the Grandmaster level, only reaching the Master level wouldn\u2019t be too much of a loss either.\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd42 \ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd41 \ud83c\udd44\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd3b\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd33 \ud83c\udd35\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd41\ud83c\udd42\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd3d\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd45\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd3b-\ud83c\udd31\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd3d.\ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd3cHe planned to slowly gather a few people to serve his purpose in the future. Alchemy King Bird from his original timeline had become the first among these individuals he successfully recruited.After returning to the past, Nie Yan was filled with wild ambition. Establishing his own elite team, acquiring an alchemy shop, recruiting a Master Tailor... there were many things he wished to do. Perhaps one day, he would even be able to establish his own guild! He might not interact alongside them all the time but there were other methods to manage the guild as well. By using his knowledge of the game and future events, he could still develop his elite forces from afar.Many mysterious and wondrous new areas would be released in future patches. Included, of course, would be new dungeons, crafting materials, and other items as well. Furthermore, there would be intense struggles over strongholds and enormous guilds wars beyond the scope of one\u2019s imagination. Even cities, provinces, or entire nations could get involved in these virtual battlefields.In the previous timeline, countless financial firms across the globe had established their presence within the game; the potential commerce and booming economy within the game left many of these firms watering at their mouths. These major figures split for themselves slices of this enormous cake. They opened stores, established guilds, took over cities, and even became powerful forces reigning over their regions.Armed with the knowledge of the future, he was absolutely unwilling to surrender himself to surviving in the cracks and crevices these numerous figures overlooked. Therefore, he required power and influence of his own in order to contend against them. He might not have any significant influence at present, but do remember: great oaks grew from the smallest of acorns, and even the tallest skyscrapers were built from the ground up. The foundations to realizing his wild ambitions were already steadily budding.He withdrew from his daydreaming and began thinking of more immediate matters. No matter what the future held, his most urgent goal right now was still to speed his progress in the game and strengthen himself and his assets.He worked hard to recall the locations of the several other chapters from the Book of Order. As he quietly deliberated over the problem of acquiring them, he also began wondering which ones were attainable at his current level.However, after a brief moment, he reluctantly decided that it was best to abandon such thoughts. All chapters were protected by a Guardian of Order. Were he to even attempt to retrieve another chapter in the hopes of surviving and succeeding, his actions could only be accurately described as foolishly throwing his life away. A few days ago, prior to his decision in retrieving the Chapter of Courage, he didn\u2019t have much to lose. He didn\u2019t have any valuable equipment on him, and at worst, he\u2019d only drop a level. However, even he didn\u2019t expect himself to succeed in the end as he had only gone in with a try-and-see attitude. Moreover, the reason it was a success had a lot to do the Chapter of Courage\u2019s location: a closed ravine by the mountainside. They were natural barriers he could cross over and take advantage of, and the ravine itself was a near a town. The other chapters certainly weren\u2019t located in such convenient places. In addition, he now held the Chapter of Courage. If he were to go and retrieve the other chapters and somehow an accident befell him, he\u2019d lose that as well. The risks compared to the rewards were simply too high.Ever since he entered the game, he had never played with the intention of levelling up at the fastest possible pace. Yet, he still managed to amass quite a few good things: the Silk Spinner Ring, the Featherfall Jewel, the Chapter of Courage, and numerous skills and stat points. These things represented the strength he had slowly built up for himself and would allow him to walk even further in the future.What else can I do? Diverting his train of thought, he began to recall of something else. The chapters from the Book of Order might be the sacred objects of those who guarded order. However, for Thieves, there was another item that was heavily coveted: a pair of Legendary boots called Sulgata\u2019s Shadow. If he were to equip a piece of Legendary-grade equipment, he imagined his stats would be high enough to frighten others. Unfortunately, in the distant past during the War of Sulgata, these boots were damaged and separated into three pieces, which were scattered across the Viridian Empire. Only by retrieving and assembling these three pieces together could this Legendary item be restored to its original form.A piece of Sulgata\u2019s Shadow was located in an area not far from Calore. The area was an ancient city that became swallowed by marshland.There were some memories from the Dark Era that remained in Sulgata City.\u201cThe Ancient City of Sulgata... Tsk, what a troublesome area,\u201d Nie Yan muttered to himself. In the previous timeline, he had been to this location before but by that time, the piece had long been taken. Over the course of centuries, the city had transformed into an extremely peculiar place. The respawn rate and density of the monsters there were high as well, and trying to enter without a team certainly wouldn\u2019t be a simple matter.However, for a Thief, it wasn\u2019t necessarily an impossible feat. Perhaps he would be able to enter without arousing notice.Legendary-grade equipment was truly too difficult to collect. Simply having an opportunity to retrieve Sulgata\u2019s Shadow, even if only a part of it, was extremely valuable, and he wasn\u2019t willing to let it slip by since, after some time, he couldn\u2019t say for sure that there wouldn\u2019t be a guild preparing to storm the city.I should give it a try. Who knows? I might actually succeed in collecting all the pieces.Before departure, he purchased a few consumables that he deemed necessary for this trip before leaving through Calore\u2019s west gates and teleported to the surface. After reaching solid ground, he travelled to his destination and passed through a patch of wilderness. The warm sunlight shone down on the abundant vegetation like a blanket of green over this stretch of land.Passing through the wilderness, he eventually encountered an open plain. After traversing through for about ten minutes, he turned around and gazed east, looking off into the horizon. There, he could see Calore, with its enormous walls and pearly white buildings, suspended high in the vast azure and over the open fields. Above the highest buildings, above the city itself, he saw a hovering ring of light revolving in the air. Under the illumination of the mid-afternoon sun, the ring shone with a dazzling splendorThis indestructible, impenetrable city in the sky represented the Viridian Empire\u2019s greatest achievement in architecture.The Viridian Mages, with all their wisdom and matchless abundance in mana, had controlled powerful magic beyond imagination to prop this imposing city into the sky, where it would stay suspended for past and future generations.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 Natlan MarshPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 70 \u2013 Natlan MarshGoing by foot is too slow. How long will it take for me to start riding a horse? It\u2019d be so much faster and more comfortable. However, Nie Yan knew it would actually take over two months for horses to become commonplace as a method of transportation. They were simply too expensive. At present, even the lousiest of breeds still cost upwards of ten gold. It just wasn\u2019t worth it.He retrieved a Basic Haste Scroll from his bag and crumpled it in his hand, activating it, before sprinting off towards Sulgata.If there were players nearby, they would see a silhouette dashing across the open field and soon disappearing into the distance.Half an hour later, he encountered a new area as the surroundings transitioned into a dark marshland. This location was far from town so very few players could be seen hunting here. Almost no one actively sought out this strange place inherently filled with danger. However, every so often, a rare bunch would decide to explore this marsh. Many of them were thrillseekers who happened to be high-level experts as well. On his journey here, he had encountered many such players travelling in groups.Short stubby bushes flourished all over. A dense fog lingered in the air and blocked the sunlight from above. Once in a while, a cold wind blew past. The marsh left an eerie impression on those who came across it.The earth was muddied and filled with basins of festering waters, where one would occasionally discover the corpse of some unlucky animal rotting inside. A slight rustle or movement periodically came from the shrubs as a few snake-type monsters slithered by. All sorts of hidden dangers lurked inside this dark marsh.\u300cS ystem: You\u2019ve discovered Natlan Marsh! \u300dI\u2019m finally here. He examined the everlasting fog of the Natlan Marsh. Passing through this area will take a bit of effort.He cautiously moved between the bushes, wary of the potential monsters lurking nearby. He did his best to evade their sights. However, after passing through a dense patch of shrubbery, his high Awareness warned him of impending danger.\u300cRustle! Rustle! Rustle!\u300dA large silhouette charged past the shrubs and pounced at him.He instinctively dodge rolled and avoided the sudden attack, but not before getting a good look at the enemy\u2019s appearance. It was a Marsh Monitor, a species of large lizards that roamed this map. The one that appeared was over two meters in length, and black speckled its dark green skin. Sharp protrusions grew from its head and tail; these protrusions along with its claws were covered in a viscous green poison which caused paralysis, and those unlucky enough to be struck by this poison would be unable to move for three seconds. It was the Marsh Monitor\u2019s most dangerous weapon.Ah, it\u2019s these guys. He felt a bit apprehensive. Although these lizards had relatively low health and were quite frail, the consequences of being struck by their attacks were fatal.In his previous life, an expert had once left some words of advice: Under no circumstances should you underestimate a monster, since even the weakest of Marsh Monitors were still capable of killing you.At the lower levels, these lizards were the nemesis of all Mages and Thieves as these classes relied on their mobility to survive. In the event a Thief or Mage became paralyzed, these Marsh Monitors could freely rip them to shreds. Even heavy-armoured Fighters were susceptible to being killed by these lizards if they were careless.Marsh Monitor: Level 6Health: 360/360The Marsh Monitor\u2019s attack struck nothing but air as it fell back to the ground.\u300cCrash!\u300dIts heavyset body sent mud and water flying.At the end of the roll, Nie Yan retrieved his dagger and wielded it in his right hand in a reverse grip. He returned with Concussive Blow, Assassinate, and Vital Strike.\u221279\u221283\u221297Then he finished with a flurry of attacks before Concussive Blow\u2019s stun duration timed out. The Marsh Monitor trembled and collapsed.These lizards truly were frail. As long as the player wasn\u2019t hit, they were extremely easy to kill.\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd42 \ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd41 \ud83c\udd44\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd3b\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd33 \ud83c\udd35\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd41\ud83c\udd42\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd3d\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd45\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd3b-\ud83c\udd31\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd3d.\ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd3cUnder Nie Yan\u2019s assault, the Marsh Monitor hadn\u2019t been given the slightest bit of leeway and was killed in their first exchange.After switching over to Level 5 equipment, his Attack rose to over sixty points. Honestly, to the present player base, such a high attack was simply unimaginable on a Thief. Coupled with his class\u2019 innately fast attacks, his damage per second rose to an unprecedented degree. Apart from the leaders of the major guilds, very few players wore equipment of his quality. Even if they did, he still possessed the Chapter of Courage.Even though he had fought and killed the Marsh Monitor, which was above his level, he didn\u2019t feel the slightest bit of tension, as he held complete control over the entire battle. This was the result of his high Willpower and Awareness, overbearing attack power, extreme maneuverability, and fast attack speed.He killed several more Marsh Monitors along the way. Due to his agility and speed, not a single one was able to reach him with their attacks.The further he travelled into the marsh, the denser the fog became which obscured his vision even more. This forced him to vastly raise his guard and attentiveness with every step forward. Although he could easily kill these Marsh Monitors, if he were struck even once, they could do the same to him.The dense fog rolled and drifted in the air. From time to time, he would see strange shadows appearing and disappearing within it.These illusions were the remnants of a forgotten battlefield. The sounds of soldiers roaring and cavalry charging into battle could be faintly heard in his ears. However, as soon as the cold wind blew again, these desolate illusions of a distant play would drift away with it.Suddenly, he heard the sound of approaching footsteps. They were heavy but amidst the other sounds, he couldn\u2019t distinguish if they were real.He didn\u2019t notice anything unusual until he felt the ground begin to shake. Only then did he realize his disastrous situation. He swept his gaze towards the footsteps and saw a lizard crawling out of a nearby brush. The moment he saw its scarlet red tongue flicking out of its mouth, a strong fishy smell assaulted his nose.This lizard was five meters in length. It was supported by four powerful limbs and a thick, long tail that was covered in spikes. Its entire body was shrouded in ash-black scales save for a patch of white which formed a strange pattern on its neck.Even for the native inhabitants of Natlan Marsh, this lizard was a horrifying existence. The white pattern on its neck represented an old mystery as well as death.This lizard was clearly different from the others he had met.The giant lizard noticed his presence and charged. Its tail twisted and turned as it ran in an awkward gait. Though odd as it may be, its speed was not to be trifled with. In reality, this unique gait was the reason it could move so quickly. In merely a brief few seconds, it had already come up to Nie Yan.He activated Swift Retreat to build up some distance while simultaneously examining it with Transcendent Insight.Serpentine Lizard (Sub-Elite): Level 7Health: 1,200/1,200Shock washed over his heart when he read its name. Why the hell did I end up meeting this guy!?These lizards only roamed around the Natlan Marsh and were Sub-Elite monsters. At his current level, let alone a Level 7 Sub-Elite, even if he met a Leader-class monster at his own level, he\u2019d still have no choice but to flee. The only reason he was able to take on Gato the Lion King and the Ogre Devourer was because they spawned in areas with exploitable terrain. However, in this marshland, there was no such terrain to speak of, and it was impossible for him to face it head-on. These lizards were the true overlords of this map.Although the Serpentine Lizard didn\u2019t have very much health compared to other Sub-Elites of the same level, it compensated with an exceedingly high attack. It could also release its poison into the mud and spread it through a mist. Level 10 or lower players were simply no match for this monster in a one-on-one fight. Only a party of five or more Level 10 players would dare to take on this overgrown lizard. In his original timeline, since many players ended up dying at their hands while training in this area, it was nicknamed the Killer of the Marsh.The Serpentine Lizard closed the distance in an instant and spewed out poisonous mist. The green mist rapidly dispersed into the surroundings upon leaving its mouth.Only a slight whiff within this mist was sufficient to cause one to become confused and dazed.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He rolled out of the poisonous mist, slipping past its head, and landed right next to it. In fact, he was so close he could see each ashen black scale.The Serpentine Lizard immediately swept its thick and powerful tail at him in response.The tail resembled a whip as it whistled through the air at a ridiculous velocity.He\u2019d be done for if the lizard\u2019s attack were to land. Even if he was lucky enough to survive, he\u2019d still end up losing the greater half of his health!Swift Retreat!His movement speed explosively increased by thirty percent. Even then, it barely allowed him to keep up with the Serpentine Lizard. He quickly pulled away and evaded the attack by a hair\u2019s breadth. Then, he turned tail and leapt over a large patch of shrubbery whereupon he gracefully landed back on the ground and fled for his life.The Serpentine Lizard shifted its massive five-meter body and went in immediate pursuit.Two silhouettes, one large and the other small, rapidly traversed the marshes.Nie Yan glanced back from the corner of his eye and noticed the Serpentine Lizard shortening the distance by every second. He activated a Basic Haste Scroll and bolstered his speed by another twenty percent.Although its target had pulled further away, the Serpentine Lizard didn\u2019t falter and continued to give chase. They were known as the most difficult monster to deal with in the marsh. The moment they set their sights on their prey, as long as it was still within the boundaries of the marsh, they would be unrelenting in their pursuit.Nie Yan\u2019s mind was in turmoil. He knew Swift Retreat\u2019s duration wouldn\u2019t last long, and when the timer ran out, the Serpentine Lizard would close the distance and catch up.His eyes frantically swept over the surroundings as he searched for some way to live. Although he knew it would be incredibly difficult to survive this encounter, he didn\u2019t want to sit and wait for death.When all seemed lost, a surge of electricity emerged amidst the gaps of some distant thickets. His pupils contracted as his heart rapidly beat with excitement. He immediately moved towards the source of this magic.Though a forbidden zone for low-level players, the Natlan Marsh was a wonderland for experts, a statement which held especially true for elite teams. Many of them came here for no other reason than to retrieve a certain item that could be found in this marsh\u2014the Revive skill book!The Marsh Monitors had a one in ten thousand chance of dropping this skill book. Despite its low drop rate, it was heavily sought after because of its incredible value in a team, so much that its importance far outstripped everything else. A Priest who learned the skill could revive a fallen teammate. Such an effect was a substantial buffer against potential losses in a run. At times, it could even save the team from being completely wiped!Other than the Revive skill book, players could find decent equipment such as the Moon Chaser Staff, which gave Lightning Damage +9 and Intelligence +5, and the Sacred Wind Mallet, which gave Holy Shield +8 and Resilience +5. The common mobs in the marsh did drop Silver or Gold-grade equipment but like the Revive book, their drop rates were quite low.The equipment that came out of this map were of good quality. Moreover, since a team had recently found the Revive skill book while training here, increasingly more players flocked to this map in search of it. Therefore, the number of experts in the marsh weren\u2019t all that few....Elsewhere at an earlier time.\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t Candy returned yet?\u201d asked a dark-faced man in crimson bone armour. His name was Dark Eternal Sin. He could be considered a well-known figure, though his fame lay outside the game. Before Conviction\u2019s release, there were several other famous Virtual Reality Games such as Kings Tree and Purgatory. Dark Eternal Sin was the guild leader of Dark Empire and a powerful overlord in these games. However, to the surprise of others, he had chosen not to re-establish his guild when he entered Conviction, and instead he had only formed a team with his close friends. Nonetheless, he and his team were not to be underestimated. In fact, they were quite amazing. His Death\u2019s Sacrifice +2 armour set was proof of this. It belonged to a Level 5 Gold-grade equipment set, and he had successfully upgraded it twice with Fortune Gems. Its properties could be rated as one of the highest among similar equipment.Dark Eternal Sin chose Berserker as his class. He had a tall stature, a fairly tan skin tone, and a ferocious appearance. Wherever he stood, he seemed like an immovable iron tower. At the centre of his bone armour was a giant skull that radiated a crimson glow. His weapon of choice was a black greatsword which he currently held in his hands. It was excessively broad, over two meters in length, and permeated with destructive power.Dark Eternal Sin had brought over six of his members to train here. Excluding him, there were three Mages, one Priest, and one Thief. The person he had previously mentioned was the team\u2019s Thief.\u201cThere are probably no more monsters left for her to aggro,\u201d the Holy Mage replied. She wore a pure-white robe that emitted a faint glow. Her staff appeared to radiate light as well, specifically from the clear crystal embedded at the end.Her appearance was beautiful, and she held a faint seductive charm. Her figure wasn\u2019t bad either. She was relatively tall, and her cleavage was full of allure. When paired with her Dancing Light Gown, she became quite enchanting.\u201cYou\u2019re probably right. There aren\u2019t many monsters in this spot anymore. If she doesn\u2019t go a bit farther, she won\u2019t be able to pull any over.\u201d Eternal Sin nodded his head in agreement.At the same moment, a Thief appeared within their sights. She could be seen leading roughly a dozen Marsh Monitors towards their location.Her appearance was exceptionally delicate and pretty. Her skin was fair and worthy of making any woman feel jealous. However, for some reason, she gave off a dark, murderous aura that couldn\u2019t be put into words.She was quite agile; she gracefully dodged the Marsh Monitors\u2019 attacks while bringing them over.In the former Dark Empire guild, she was absolutely someone who shouldn\u2019t be overlooked\u2014she was known as the deadliest member of their roster. The type of classes she previously played in other games were always Assassins, Thieves, and the like. During her run in these older games, numerous experts ended up dying by her hands. Her reputation was so terrifying that expressions would change into horror upon the mention of her name.\u201cSu Yan (White Smoke), prepare your magic!\u201d Eternal Sin commanded. He prepared himself for Candy\u2019s approach alongside the monsters in tow by grasping both hands on his greatsword firmly. The spot they chose to station at held advantageous terrain.Su Yan and the two other Mages, an Elementalist and an Arcane Mage, brandished their staffs and began casting their spells. Soon, magical energy rapidly gathered in the air.\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd42 \ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd41 \ud83c\udd44\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd3b\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd33 \ud83c\udd35\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd41\ud83c\udd42\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd3d\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd45\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd3b-\ud83c\udd31\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd3d.\ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd3cHowever, the one that brought the most attention among the three seemed to be the Elementalist. The air above him flashed and surged with electricity. As he held his staff with one hand, the other was raised in the air with his palm facing the sky. The electricity slowly began condensing above his head and transformed into a massive sphere.Yet the Elementalist continued to chant his magic. It seemed like a high-level spell that required at least one set of syllables to cast. As he persisted with his incantation, the magical symbols appeared like tadpoles swimming in the air, dissipating as they rose into the sky.Eternal Sin observed the ten or so Marsh Monitors charging closer. In the next moment, he brandished his greatsword and ran up to meet them. He let out a roar and used Whirlwind Slash, clashing with three of them in close distance.At the same time, a brilliant beam of light and an Arcane Fireball fell over the group of Marsh Monitors.\u300cBoom! Boom!\u300dThe two spells exploded on impact. Even after their spells landed, the Elementalist named Lei Fa (Lightning Magic) was still in the middle of casting.Meanwhile, on the frontline, Eternal Sin was chugging an Anti-Paralysis Potion. After he finished drinking it, he violently cleaved at a nearby Marsh Monitor that was low-health and killed it. \u201cDammit! Elemental Hall Magic is too inconvenient. It\u2019s been so long yet it still hasn\u2019t finished casting!\u201dJust as he spoke, a giant of ball of lightning whistled past his head and flew towards the group of Marsh Monitors ahead.\u300cBoom!\u300dThe sphere of lightning exploded like fireworks. Electric sparks crackled and scattered in every direction. In a single flash, the spell had annihilated six Marsh Monitors.\u2212360, \u2212360, \u2212360...A cluster of damage numbers rose above the group of lizards.There was a wide crater left in the earth from the impact of the spell. Marsh Monitor corpses were littered everywhere while the ones that weren\u2019t directly hit suffered heavy damage nonetheless.\u201cThough its destructive power is pretty good...\u201d Eternal Sin swept his gaze over the scene. This spell was extremely powerful, but it was only good for mobbing. A spell that took such a long time to cast was completely worthless in PvP situations.After casting the spell, the Elementalist\u2019s mana bar was completely drained. He sat to the side cross-legged and drank a flask of Spring Water to replenish mana.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72 - ThiefPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 72 - ThiefElemental Hall Magic, which could only be learned by Elementalists, came from the various Elemental Shrines scattered across the continent. It was divided into sixteen ranks, with rank sixteen denoting the highest possible rank. The Thousand Swallows Burst from just a moment ago was classified as a rank one Elemental Hall Magic. It had a long channeling time, requiring a full set of syllables to successfully cast. The long casting time made it impractical in one-versus-one battles. As for team battles, it could be easily cancelled by a Paladin using Silence. Such reasons made it unsuitable for PvP. Not to mention its lengthy cooldown period, which came to a total of two entire days. Hence, Elementalists that learnt rank one Elemental Hall Magic would only cast them during emergencies. Naturally, if it was a high-level Elemental Hall Magic, for example the rank sixteen Mantra of Silence, it would be an entirely different case.After Thousand Swallows Burst ended, Candy stealthily circled round a Marsh Monitor\u2019s back. She raised her dagger and struck the back of its head with Smothering Strike. The dagger flickered with a cold glint as she arced the blade through her target\u2019s neck. Her methods were efficient and brutal. The low-health Marsh Monitor stood no chance and collapsed to the ground.\u201cFlame Slash!\u201d Eternal Sin cleaved down as his greatsword was enveloped by an intense blaze.\u300cBoom!\u300dHis blade directly beheaded and cauterized a Marsh Monitor\u2019s neck. The raging flames continued burning until its entire body was charred black.The five remaining Marsh Monitors charged past and made a bee-line for the three Mages in the rear. However, Eternal Sin roared and stopped them in their tracks by using Taunt!The moment his Taunt came out, the five lizards immediately aggroed onto him and unleashed a flurry of attacks. \u221215, \u221216, \u221218 ... Several damage values emerged and rose above his head.Fortunately, his defense was solid, so despite being encircled, these lizards posed no threat.The Priest in the rear cast Dispel, removing the paralysis debuff, then followed up with Lesser Heal. As a result, Eternal Sin immediately recovered a large chunk of health.With all five Marsh Monitors aggroed onto him, Eternal Sin brandished his greatsword and activated Whirlwind Slash. Immediately, his spinning blade swept through their bodies and dealt over fifty damage to each.Su Yan (White Smoke) and the Arcane Mage continued casting spells in the rear.Despite being besieged by Marsh Monitors, Eternal Sin firmly held his ground like an immovable boulder. The earth was splattered with blood, some from the lizards and some his own. Amidst the madness that shone in his eyes, he erupted in a frenzy intertwined with ruthlessness and bloodlust. His entire being was akin to an enraged beast, his every action hammering fear into one\u2019s heart.Su Yan and the others couldn\u2019t help but tremble when witnessing Eternal Sin in such a state. He was simply a killing machine that maniacally swung his sword for slaughter.The only one who remained unperturbed was Candy. She curled her lips and uttered, \u201cBoring...\u201d before lightly yawning. She then rummaged through her knapsack and took out a piece of fruit candy that could be bought at the NPC general store. Popping it into her mouth, she entered Stealth and approached a Monitor Lizard from the rear. Smothering Strike! Upon activating the skill, she struck the lizard on the backside of its head with the pommel of her dagger. Now that it was stunned, her blade easily pierced its flesh and sent out a spray of blood.Eternal Sin and his team had fairly good synergy. Within a brief timespan, they were able to easily make short work of the dozen or so lizards.Candy retrieved her dagger from a Marsh Monitor\u2019s corpse and calmly wiped off the blood.\u201cBig Guy, the monsters here are too scarce. Let\u2019s go somewhere else,\u201d Candy said to Eternal Sin.Only Candy would dare to call him in such a way since the others didn\u2019t have the nerves to do so. This sense of familiarity came from having known each other for a long time. As for how long? No one knew. However, one fact remained consistent throughout the years: whenever Dark Empire was overturning the entire world of those previous games, Candy was never absent.Although Candy and Eternal Sin didn\u2019t establish a guild, the rallying power they held within Conviction was still extremely astonishing.Eternal Sin strapped his greatsword on his back and turned to face the other members. \u201cLet\u2019s take a small break. We\u2019ll switch locations afterwards.\u201dAnd so, atop a mound of dry earth under the shade of a tree, six players rested while eating Bread and drinking Spring Water....Although the clamour of battle had recently ended, Nie Yan continued heading towards its source as he dashed through the marsh. Eventually, six players entered his sight.At the same moment, Eternal Sin and his party also discovered him and quickly stood up in response.\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd42 \ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd41 \ud83c\udd44\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd3b\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd33 \ud83c\udd35\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd41\ud83c\udd42\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd3d\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd45\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd3b-\ud83c\udd31\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd3d.\ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd3cNie Yan observed the other party\u2019s equipment as he neared, and he was particularly surprised by Eternal Sin\u2019s equipment. What a strong group of players! Even then, the Serpentine Lizard was closing in from the rear, so he no choice but to disregard their strength and press on.\u201cIt\u2019s a Thief...\u201d Eternal Sin said, after getting a better look at Nie Yan, though in no way did he believe this single Thief would pose a threat. Why? Because the strongest Thief in the game was standing right here beside them. Not to mention, with his high health and defense, there was simply no reason to fear any Thief in the first place. Even if Nie Yan\u2019s equipment did look somewhat decent to him, to this day, there had never been a single Thief that could defeat him. This wasn\u2019t confidence born out of arrogance but rather confidence that came from absolute strength.\u201cOh?\u201d Candy\u2019s figure gradually faded before completely merging with the greenery in the background.As Nie Yan ran, his eyes fell on a certain patch of shrubbery off in the distance. The other side\u2019s prowess using Stealth was near flawless. Ordinary players or even experts might not be able to detect her presence, but she definitely wouldn\u2019t go unnoticed by him.Candy felt a tinge of surprise as she saw Nie Yan\u2019s gaze focus on her. Oh...? It seems they encountered an interesting fellow.Though he could clearly sense the open hostility in the moment he appeared before them, his circumstances were quite dire since the Serpentine Lizard was already close to his heels. He had to take this gamble, but he wasn\u2019t naive enough to believe these six would help him out of the kindness of their hearts. So, he was left with no other choice. He would pass the Serpentine Lizard off to them and make use of their power in order to survive!He accelerated his pace and bolted straight for Eternal Sin and the others.Eternal Sin unstrapped his greatsword and firmly grasped it in his hand. The blade was at an inclined angle and firmly planted on the earth so he could be ready to receive his opponent. He stood no further than two meters from his Mages. Though he personally wasn\u2019t afraid, things could get quite dangerous if he let this Thief enter their rearline.Eternal Sin, who wore the Death\u2019s Sacrifice set, resembled an iron wall that blocked the path to the three Mages behind him.Just as Eternal Sin was prepared to cut down this Thief, the bushes in the distance stirred with activity, causing his heart to leap in surprise. Don\u2019t tell me there\u2019s more people at his rear?He soon discovered what followed the Thief from behind wasn\u2019t a player but rather... a gigantic lizard! It was several times larger than the ordinary lizard monsters in this area.\u201cShit... It\u2019s a Serpentine!\u201d Candy drew in a breath of cold air upon seeing the lizard\u2019s distinct gait. They were a terrifying existence: apex predators, killers of the marsh, and capable of reaching lightning-fast speeds.\u201cLevel 7 Sub-Elite?\u201d Eternal Sin stammered and retreated several steps back to the mound. They could have easily handled the situation if the second figure had been another player, but what arrived was a Level 7 Sub-Elite instead! It was an existence that was difficult to deal with even at their levels. Not to mention their Priest had yet to learn Revive. It would be a disastrous loss if one or two of them ended up dying due to this.As Nie Yan drew increasingly near, the Elementalist at Eternal Sin\u2019s rear brandished their staff and sent lightning crackling toward him.This Thief\u2019s intentions were already quite obvious to them. He wanted to pass the Serpentine Lizard off to them. Naturally, Eternal Sin and his group wouldn\u2019t be polite. None of them dared to receive such a flaming hot potato.Behind the bolt of lightning, Su Yan and the Arcane Mage\u2019s attacks arrived in tow.By this time, the Serpentine Lizard was basically nipping at his heels. It wound up its body, and in the next instant, pounced at him like an arrow. In response, Nie Yan rolled to the side and evaded its attack and incidentally, Lei Fa\u2019s (Lightning Magic) bolt of lightning.\u300cBang!\u300dHowever, he was unable to avoid a Holy Strike aimed prior to where he rolled to.\u221267\u300c System: A member of the party led by player Eternal Sin has taken the initiative to attack you. You are free to retaliate in legitimate self-defense. Duration: 30 minutes. \u300dDammit! What kind of damage is that!? Nie Yan inwardly cried out in alarm. He rolled again and avoided the oncoming Arcane Fireball. Just as the spell passed by him, he felt a murderous intent nearing his back.Their Thief!62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 - TrickedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 73 - TrickedCloaking and Awareness were directly opposing stats. In situations where the opponent was a Thief under the effects of stealth, they could only be seen clearly if the other party\u2019s Awareness was higher than the Thief\u2019s Cloaking by fifty percent or more. When the two stats were equal, the Thief could be spotted if the other player concentrated hard enough while searching. If the Thief was good, however, then in situations where Cloaking exceeded the defending side\u2019s Awareness, the opposing player would be stunned before they even had a chance to react.Naturally, this wasn\u2019t to say that when a Thief was discovered their attacks could be easily avoided. After all, Thieves were innately fast, whether it be in terms of movement or attack.In a certain region within the marsh, the air distorted to reveal a silhouette. Its owner was Candy, who had activated Stealth and disappeared earlier on. She had re-emerged at Nie Yan\u2019s rear. Her attack was terrifyingly fast as she attempted to strike him in the back of the head.A single Concussive Blow would leave him stunned long enough to allow the Mages to send him directly to the graveyard.However, before Candy even approached his back, he had already discovered her presence. Those nineteen points in Awareness weren\u2019t just for show. He smoothly leaned to the side and avoided her strike.After dodging, he pivoted his foot and struck back with his own Concussive Blow, aimed directly at her temple.What a decisive attack! Candy rapidly pulled back, evading by just a hair\u2019s breadth, before distancing herself from Nie Yan.This Thief had somehow discovered her!? Just how high was his Awareness? Not to mention his quick reaction speed and even fiercer counter. His movements were as natural as the floating clouds and flowing waters, a matchless style which left her heart in shock. What a strong guy!At the moment, the average player was still quite low level, and although there weren\u2019t many methods of attack, close-combat was the best judge of the opposing player\u2019s experience and skills.An expert! Candy was instantly convinced of this thought, though she wasn\u2019t disheartened. In fact, she was delighted since things wouldn\u2019t be interesting otherwise.Just as their exchange ended, the Serpentine Lizard chose this moment to charge at Nie Yan from the side. Its gigantic body drew increasingly closer as its gaping maw appeared wider with each passing millisecond. He sidestepped the attack, locked his eyes onto a tree in the distance, then extended his left hand and shot out a line of webbing from his Silk Spinner Ring.He jerked the web line and pulled himself out of immediate attack range.The Serpentine Lizard\u2019s attack had struck thin air yet again, enraging it to no end. It swung its body around and charged at Nie Yan once more.In the brief moment when it had lost sight of him, Nie Yan activated a Basic Haste Scroll and bolted towards the three Mages at Eternal Sin\u2019s rear. For the sake of preserving his life, he had no choice but to lead the Serpentine Lizard towards them; otherwise, he\u2019d have no chance of surviving.Eternal Sin firmly grasped his greatsword and blocked the approaching opponent\u2019s path. He readied himself and prepared to attack when Nie Yan entered his range. A Thief\u2019s innately frail defense meant that as long as he got in a few strikes, they could be easily killed.As Nie Yan drew closer, Eternal Sin stared fixedly at him and the Serpentine Lizard in tow. At this point, it would be hard to avoid a confrontation with the lizard, though the most immediate issue was Nie Yan. They needed to kill him off; otherwise, it\u2019d become quite annoying if he started wreaking havoc while they fought it.Although Nie Yan initially had no enmity with Eternal Sin and his group, when he lead such a disaster towards them, it\u2019d be quite normal for them to hate his guts.Yet at the same time, this was also the wilderness, a place where life or death depended on skill. So even if they died, they would have no one to blame but themselves since they lacked the strength to survive.By now the Serpentine was about to overtake Nie Yan, but the latter was likewise about to enter Eternal Sun\u2019s range.Eternal Sin brandished his blade and completely sealed off his path. It appeared he was going to match the Serpentine Lizard and perform a pincer attacker.Nie Yan fully understood that the other party really wanted him dead. There was an enemy in front and another chasing from behind. He was being forced onto a narrow path. If he were to have the slightest slip-up, the Serpentine Lizard would pounce on him and Eternal Sin wouldn\u2019t hesitate in cutting him down where he stood.Seeing his opponent enter striking distance, Eternal Sin directly slashed down as a blade of light flew towards Nie Yan\u2019s face. In the same instant, Nie Yan fiercely pivoted and leaped toward a nearby thicket.The blade of light struck Nie Yan mid-leap and drew blood, followed by two explosions as a Holy Smite and a bolt of lightning landed afterwards.\u221265\u221289\u221272Several damage values rose above his head, and he had nearly lost all of his health with a little over a tenth remaining.Shit! Just how far can he leap!?Eternal Sin immediately felt his heart sink after seeing Nie Yan successfully escape through the bushes.How high or how far a player could leap was based on the Strength and Jump stats as well as weight load. The upper limit of how high a player could leap was five meters. The higher Strength and Jump were, the more powerful the leap. On the other hand, as weight increased, jump range decreased.Fortunately for Nie Yan, his weight load was light, and he possessed the Chapter of Courage which provided fifteen points in Jump. It was no wonder his leap was so astonishing.Eternal Sin was confident in obstructing and pinning Nie Yan down. He had even perfectly matched the timing of his attack with the Serpentine Lizard. If things had proceeded without a hitch, his opponent would have been dead in less than five seconds. Yet, never did he expect that Nie Yan would turn into a frog and bound across the bushes to escape.In the next moment, the Serpentine Lizard arrived at Nie Yan\u2019s previous position. It had lost sight of its target. Fortunately, there was new prey standing right beside it. It immediately turned around and pounced at Eternal Sin.He had been tricked! As he stared at the giant lizard already in mid-leap, he knew he didn\u2019t have the chance to retreat. He brandished his greatsword and stepped forward to meet it head-on.\u201cEveryone, be careful of that Thief! Candy, go after him!\u201d Eternal Sin promptly commanded, then focused on repelling the Serpentine Lizard\u2019s attacks. He feared Nie Yan would turn back and sneak attack the Mages in the backline.The situation could get dangerous if Nie Yan got within melee range of the Mages. His could easily overwhelm them using his skill and agility, especially against the Priest who couldn\u2019t put up much of a fight.\u201cNo worries. Just leave it to me.\u201d Candy\u2019s eyes flashed with a peculiar expression. This guy\u2019s quite skilled.After successfully baiting Eternal Sin into engaging the Serpentine Lizard, Nie Yan turned around to examine the scene. Seeing as Eternal Sin and the Serpentine were already fighting, he felt somewhat alleviated of his stress. I finally got that lizard off my tail.Should I take advantage of the situation to get rid of them or should I just leave? Nie Yan pondered for a moment. Let\u2019s watch and see for now...\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd42 \ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd41 \ud83c\udd44\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd3b\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd33 \ud83c\udd35\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd41\ud83c\udd42\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd3d\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd45\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd3b-\ud83c\udd31\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd3d.\ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd3cNie Yan entered stealth and began blending in with the background before completely disappearing from view.The Mages at the rear spotted Nie Yan\u2019s dissipating silhouette from across the bushes. When they noticed they couldn\u2019t detect his presence, they couldn\u2019t help bunching up a little. Despite their surroundings seeming completely empty, they felt an enormous pressure weighing down on them.Candy also entered stealth and scanned the surrounding for traces of Nie Yan. However, she didn\u2019t dare to stray too far from the Mages. A Thief in the shadows posed too much of a danger to lightly armoured professions.The only sound that emanated from the scene was the battle between Eternal Sin and the Serpentine Lizard. Eternal Sin\u2019s defenses were high so he could hold it off temporarily. After a short while, the Mages and the Priest also began casting their spells.Nie Yan glanced at his health bar; only a slight sliver remained. He hid behind the cover of the bushes and began applying bandages.+20... +20... +20...He restored two hundred health after ten seconds. Only then did he loosen his mind that had been on edge ever since he encountered the Serpentine Lizard.Afterwards, he quietly observed the battle. Eternal Sin firmly held his ground as the Priest healed him and Mages dealt damage. Their composure and synergy left him wondering why he didn\u2019t recognize them. They were such a strong team! However, after thinking about it for awhile, it made sense. In his original timeline, there were countless experts who were reserved and didn\u2019t reveal their strength. It was quite normal that he didn\u2019t recognize them.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 - Foiled AmbushPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 74 - Foiled AmbushThe Serpentine Lizard\u2019s attacks were especially ferocious, and Eternal Sin found them somewhat difficult to endure despite having very high defense.\u300cHiss! Hiss!\u300dJust as its scarlet tongue flickered in and out, the lizard opened its jaw and spat out a green globular substance. Upon contact with the air, it near instantaneously turned gaseous, rapidly expanded, and enshrouded everything within a two-meter radius in a poisonous mist.\u221230... \u221230... \u221230... Damage values continuously rose above Eternal Sin\u2019s head with each passing second.Each one of the Serpentine\u2019s attacks dealt more than eighty damage to his health. At the rate the battle was currently going, he wouldn\u2019t be able to hold on for much longer.\u201cDeath Speech, hurry up and cast Dispel!\u201dThe team\u2019s Priest, Death Speech, responded and hurriedly cast Dispel as a gentle ray of pure white fell on Eternal Sin\u2019s position. The light reacted with the poisonous mist and within an instant, caused it to dilute by a great degree.Eternal Sin glanced at his health bar which only had a hundred and sixty health remaining, though he didn\u2019t have much time to ruminate over it as the Serpentine Lizard resumed its assault. He raised his greatsword in an effort to resist its attack, but the lizard latched onto him and bit out a chunk of flesh.\u221276Tendon Break!Eternal Sin struck out in retaliation. The Serpentine Lizard\u2019s movements immediately turned sluggish as it temporarily entered a crippled state. Taking advantage of this brief window, he hurriedly drew back in order to create some distance.Just at that time, Lei Fa (Lightning Magic), the Elementalist, finished his incantation and cast Freeze Frost, whereupon a thin layer of ice began covering the Serpentine Lizard and slowed its movements even more.This freeze effect was a trademark of an Elementalist\u2019s Ice Magic.Death Speech promptly followed up by casting Lesser Heal, while Eternal Sin downed a Basic Recovery Potion to supplement the healing. After the initial burst of healing, the red of his health bar continued to steadily rise.Even while recovering, Eternal Sin stayed on full alert as he knew that Thief didn\u2019t go too far. If he emerged and caught them off guard, it would be difficult to predict the outcome of the battle.Just as his health replenished by three fourths, the cripple and freeze debuffs wore off, and the Serpentine Lizard came rushing forward.Sub-Elite monsters were truly too difficult to deal with. Even Eternal Sin, who wore Death\u2019s Sacrifice +2, lost health at such a rapid pace. If it were another team with worse equipment, they would\u2019ve long been wiped by now.Despite their combined efforts, the Serpentine Lizard still had a little over seventy percent health remaining.\u300c Candy, have you found him yet? \u300d\u300c No, I have no idea where that slippery bastard ran off to. \u300d\u300c Everyone, remain alert. Su Yan (White Smoke), be ready to use that spell! \u300d\u300c Understood, \u300dSu Yan replied promptly. After having known each other for so long, Eternal Sin only needed to say a few words and she would understand what was needed of her.Although Nie Yan couldn\u2019t listen in on what Eternal Sin and his team were conversing about, he knew it concerned him. However, they were heavily overestimating themselves. As a Thief with over ten years of experience, he wouldn\u2019t allow himself to be caught so easily.Their team isn\u2019t bad. They might actually be able to kill it... He stared intently at the ferocious Serpentine Lizard. A Level 7 Sub Elite, who knows what sort of items it\u2019ll drop?For the time being, he didn\u2019t have any immediate plans of going against Eternal Sin and his team. However, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be too late to decide after the two sides wore each other out a little further.Eternal Sin brandished his greatsword. He fiercely slashed down on the Serpentine Lizard\u2019s body and dealt incredibly high damage.\u300c How much mana left ? \u300dEternal Sin asked in the team chat.\u300c 67%. \u300d\u300c 78%. \u300d\u300c 32%. \u300dLei Fa cast his gaze at Eternal Sin\u2019s expression, afraid that he would get angry.\u300c Why is it so low? \u300dEternal Sin furrowed his brows and asked.\u300c When the battle started, my mana wasn\u2019t fully recovered. Then later on, I used several high-damage spells... \u300d\u300c Enough, just conserve what\u2019s left of it. \u300dEternal Sin didn\u2019t say more after listening to Lei Fa\u2019s explanation.Lei Fa switched to the low-mana-cost Ice Arrow. After a while, his mana was still low, so he drank a Basic Mana Potion and restored his mana to sixty-seven percent....Under the constant battering spells, the Serpentine Lizard\u2019s health eventually fell to a little over twenty percent.It only has around two hundred health left! By this point, Eternal Sin\u2019s mind was already tense to the point of snapping.Once its health fell below the twenty percent line, the Serpentine Lizard\u2019s skin began changing into a peculiar red.\u300cHISS! HISS!\u300dIt let out a strange cry, and subsequently, the ground beneath Eternal Sin\u2019s feet turned muddy.He was inwardly alarmed when he discovered he couldn\u2019t pull out his feet which began to sink.Not even a second later, the Serpentine Lizard leapt at him again. He activated Whirlwind Slash and successfully repelled it several steps back.Seeing Eternal Sin trapped in the mud pit, Candy suddenly thought of something and anxiously commanded,\u300c Death Speech, use Illuminate! \u300d\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd42 \ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd41 \ud83c\udd44\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd3b\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd33 \ud83c\udd35\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd41\ud83c\udd42\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd3d\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd45\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd3b-\ud83c\udd31\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd3d.\ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd3cThe Priest didn\u2019t dare to dally after hearing Candy\u2019s order. He extended his palm and sent a sphere of light flying into the air, whereupon it released a blinding radiance that fell to the earth like a curtain of silk.Illuminate was a spell that revealed everything within a five-meter radius of the Priest. As the spell revealed its effects, the outline of a silhouette wielding two daggers gradually emerged behind the Priest. The silhouette was already mid-strike, the pommel of its dagger going straight for the back of the Priest\u2019s head!\u201cHe\u2019s there!\u201d Candy raised her dagger and dashed in to intercept Nie Yan.The sound of blades clashing against each other reverberated through the air.Nie Yan had been hard pressed to find an opening. Nonetheless, his patience had persevered. Taking advantage of the havoc caused by the Serpentine Lizard\u2019s skill, he silently approached the Priest\u2019s back, and just as he was about to deliver fate-sealing blow, his intentions had been unexpectedly seen through, and he was intercepted mid-attack. Now, he was forced into a passive state defending against Candy\u2019s attacks.His plan had been to kill the Priest named Death Speech first. With the healer down, Elemental Sin, who was fighting the Serpentine Lizard, would soon follow. It was killing two birds with one stone.He just never expected that he would be seen through in spite of his flawless stealth.This was the first time he failed an ambush since reincarnating!After Candy intercepted him, the Priest successfully escaped. Since his sneak attack had failed, he activated Swift Retreat and pulled back rapidly.\u300cBoom!\u300dHe dodged the bolt of lightning just in the knick of time.Following the bolt of lightning, he had been struck by a ray of light, though it had dealt no damage.Standing in the distance, Su Yan\u2019s lips curved into a smirk. Let\u2019s just see where you can hide to now that you\u2019ve been marked!As Nie Yan retreated, a bright floating mark had appeared floating above his head. No matter where he went, the mark would follow and reveal his position.I\u2019ve been marked! he inwardly cried out in alarm and hastily made his retreat.Candy followed in pursuit but she was noticeably slower than him. After activating Swift Retreat, he had become too fast for her. She had no chance of catching up to him. The gap increasingly widened, and he soon broke away.These players were simply too strong. It would be rather difficult taking advantage of them. Thus, he had no choice but to give up and dashed out of the area....\u201cCandy, how did you discover him?\u201d Death Speech excitedly said, after being barely rescued from the clutches of death. That Thief had been really close to his position. If she was even a second later, not only would he have died but Eternal Sin would have as well.\u201cI didn\u2019t. My Awareness isn\u2019t that high. I was actually puzzled for quite a long time. Why hadn\u2019t that Thief acted by now? There were already several good opportunities that had gone by. So, I put myself in his shoes and thought to myself, \u2018When would be a good time to attack?\u2019 When I saw Tall Guy sink into that quagmire, I guessed that was probably the best opportunity, which was why I had you cast Illuminate. I didn\u2019t expect that I\u2019d actually discover him...\u201d Candy replied. If she had been a step slower, Death Speech would have lost his life. Truthfully, that Thief\u2019s stealth abilities could be described as perfect. The reason she had found him could be mostly attributed to good luck.She peered past the thickets and into the distance. That Thief had long disappeared within Natlan Marsh\u2019s fog.Since Glimmer Mark had a duration of two minutes, if he were to come again within that time, they would immediately discover him. Thus, they could rest assured that he wouldn\u2019t mount another ambush.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 - Turn of EventsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 75 - Turn of EventsNie Yan fled the battle but he didn\u2019t immediately leave the area. Instead, he took a detour and circled round the perimeter before stopping to scan his surroundings. Eventually, he spotted a slope not too far in the distance. He dashed toward the slope and promptly arrived at its peak, whereupon he looked over in the direction of Eternal Sin and his team. Despite the somewhat low visibility, the light show of magic and clamor signalled that the battle was still ongoing and quite fierce.At first, for the sake of preserving his life, he only planned to borrow their hand in killing the Serpentine Lizard and nothing else. However, since they tried to kill him, he wouldn\u2019t sit by idly and let them enjoy their meal in peace.No, the temptation of obtaining the equipment dropped by a Level 7 Sub-Elite couldn\u2019t be abandoned so easily.Thus, Candy and the others were unaware that Nie Yan hadn\u2019t actually fully retreated but was instead spying on them from atop a slope.After believing they had finally driven that hateful Thief away, Eternal Sin and his team inwardly breathed a sigh of relief. Just a moment ago, he was in quite a panic due to being rooted by the quagmire. If anything had happened to the Priest in the rear, he would\u2019ve been a goner as well. Luckily, Candy discovered that Thief before it was too late and helped them avert a disaster that could\u2019ve wiped the team.\u300c Good work! You all did well, \u300dEternal Sin praised in the team chat.\u300c We were just lucky. That guy isn\u2019t so easy to deal with. We need to be careful if we ever encounter him in the future, \u300dCandy replied, ending the celebrations early.Eternal Sin assumed that with her skills, the other side wouldn\u2019t be able to gain the slightest advantage over her, but it was clear that assumption was wrong. That Thief was quite astonishing.After forcing Nie Yan away, killing the Serpentine Lizard became much more relaxed.\u300cBang! Bang! Bang!\u300dThe Serpentine Lizard was bombarded by several spells. Its body was charred and bloody, and many of its scales had been split open. The barrage shaved a hundred and sixty points off its health and left it at death\u2019s door; it simply lacked that one final nudge. Yet even in its death throes, the lizard did not give up and revealed its final card. It suddenly spat out a peculiar mist which, unlike the previous times, was far denser and pitch-black in colour. It rapidly expanded and encompassed everything within a twenty-meter radius, completely obscuring everyone\u2019s vision.Su Yan (White Smoke) and the other Mages had hastily retreated when the mist began to expand. While Eternal Sin, who was at the epicenter of the skill, missed his attack and saw the shadow of the lizard bolt away.The sudden change took him by surprise, causing him to be dazed for a brief moment before realizing what was going on.\u300c Over there! It\u2019s trying to escape! \u300dEternal Sin roared.This was the first time they had come across a Sub-Elite that ran away when at low health. However, it didn\u2019t mean they had never heard of them. Several Elite-class field bosses would also use a skill to try and flee after falling below a certain health.\u300c Where? \u300dasked one of the Mages.Under the cover of the mist, their vision was completely blocked and it was impossible for them to find their target.Su Yan suddenly saw a shadow flash past some bushes. She raised her staff and prepared to cast a spell. Just as she spoke the first syllable to the incantation...\u300c System: Target is outside of spell range. \u300dShe helplessly cancelled the incantation.By the time the mist dissipated, any traces of the Serpentine Lizard would have long disappeared!\u300c It escaped... \u300dSu Yan lowered her staff.\u300c In which direction? \u300dEternal Sin asked. They had poured enormous amounts of effort into getting the Serpentine Lizard\u2019s health bar to barely a sliver of health. If it escaped just like that, wouldn\u2019t that mean all their hard work had gone to waste?\u300c Over there! \u300d...At an earlier point in time. As Nie Yan silently observed the battle from the slope, a black mist emerged and covered his view, causing his heart to jump in excitement. It\u2019s about to make a break for it! Just as he expected, from within the mist, he saw a shadow escaping towards the southeast.The reason he didn\u2019t entirely leave the area was because he had known the Serpentine Lizard would try and escape. So, he camped out atop this slope in order to cut off its escape.The low-health Serpentine Lizard wouldn\u2019t be able to run too far, around eight hundred meters at most. He planned to kill it before Eternal Sin and his team arrived and snatch the dropped items for himself.He pondered for a moment, calculating the most optimal route, then bolted down the slope towards the nearest path and rushed to intercept the Serpentine Lizard.There was an old line from a poem: \u201cMaking a beautiful dress only to give to others.\u201d The line held a deeper meaning. It referred to others who, despite working hard and toiling for hours, gained no benefits and had instead given it to others. This would be an accurate portrayal of Eternal Sin and his team.Nie Yan activated a Basic Haste Scroll and ran like the wind as he traversed the marsh.The marsh was full of wandering Marsh Monitors. Therefore, he inevitably ran past quite a few of them, who would aggro onto him and chase. Though in the end, he was too fast for them and quickly broke away. After a while, they would de-aggro and resume roaming around.After travelling for a while, he heard explosions in the distance and wrinkled his brows. There are others in this area?As he drew closer, the figures of another group of players entered his sights. There were six of them in total, and they appeared to be training in the marsh.However, he didn\u2019t slow down and soon entered their sights. Seeing him approach, the group eyed him suspiciously.\u300c It\u2019s a Thief! Everyone, be careful. \u300dAll six players raised their guards.\u300c He\u2019s probably just passing by. \u300dthe leader of the group said. If this Thief really wanted to ambush them, he wouldn\u2019t have emerged in front of them and exposed himself in plain sight.\u300c I think he\u2019s just aggroing monsters for his team. \u300dThese six players remained prudent and didn\u2019t take the initiative to intercept him. If by chance, this Thief belonged to a team and they barred his way, it would bring them unnecessary trouble.Nie Yan had more important fish to fry, so he didn\u2019t want to get in a tangle with these players unnecessarily. Plus, they didn\u2019t pose much of a threat. He ran past them and disappeared within the thickets.Those six players were astonished by his speed as he dashed past them. He had closed the distance between them in almost an instant.\u300c What kind of speed is that? \u300dThat Thief was simply too fast. Even if they had tried to intercept him, not only would they likely fail to stop him, they would have probably ended up worse for wear as well. These six players felt like they dodged a bullet.\u201cForget it, let\u2019s go back to levelling.\u201d\u201cHey Yi Wang (Forgotten), do you have any more health potions? I ran out. Share some with me.\u201dThe Thief\u2019s unexpected appearance was just a minor incident for them, so they quickly went back to training.As Nie Yan travelled further through the marsh, he finally began finding traces of the Serpentine Lizard.Finally found you. So I just need to keep going this way! He accelerated his pace. There were too many players in this area, and he didn\u2019t want the Serpentine Lizard falling into another person\u2019s hands.After running several dozen meters, he caught sight of the Serpentine Lizard resting behind some bushes.Likewise, the Serpentine Lizard noticed him as well. Its scarlet tongue flickered in, hissing as it watched him attentively. Like a lamp that had spent the last of its oil, there was no more strength left in its body. The final sprint had put it in a weakened state. By now, it no longer had the ability to flee.Nie Yan retrieved his crossbow, took aim, and fired.\u300c Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! \u300dThree bolts went flying through the air.\u221217\u221218\u221216The Serpentine Lizard let out a mournful cry as it writhed in pain.Nie Yan put away the crossbow, retrieved his daggers, then dashed toward it and dealt the final blow.\u221251\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd42 \ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd41 \ud83c\udd44\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd3b\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd33 \ud83c\udd35\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd41\ud83c\udd42\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd3d\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd45\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd3b-\ud83c\udd31\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd3d.\ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd3cA bright red damage value rose above the lizard\u2019s head. It struggled briefly before going limp and collapsing on the ground.\u201cI saw it running over this way!\u201d\u201cLook, I see its footprints on the ground!\u201dThe several voices belonged to Eternal Sin and his teammates. However, they had arrived too late. Nie Yan stooped down to the ground and picked up the item that dropped from the Serpentine Lizard\u2019s corpse. Hmmm... It\u2019s a skill book.After passing through some thickets, Eternal Sin and his team finally arrived and almost immediately noticed his presence.\u201cIt\u2019s that Thief!\u201d\u201cStop him!\u201dA spell came flying straight towards him.Goodbye~ He faintly smiled and gazed at Eternal Sin, Candy, and the others before bounding over the shrubbery and disappearing from their sight.Eternal Sin and his team anxiously went in pursuit but by the time they arrived at the lizard\u2019s corpse, all signs of Nie Yan had long disappeared. They turned to look at each other and saw the similarly dismayed expression in their teammate\u2019s eyes.It took them an enormous amount of effort to get the Serpentine Lizard to low health. Yet somehow, it still ended up in that Thief\u2019s hands. Could it be that he had never left the area and was waiting for another opportunity to appear the whole time? If that was the case, he must have possessed a terrifying level of patience.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As for Eternal Sin, Candy and the rest of their team, they had played all their cards already. Besides holding a grudge, there was nothing they could do.After fleeing from Eternal Sin and his team, Nie Yan resumed his main objective and headed for the ruins of Sulgata. As he ran towards his destination, he retrieved the skill book that he had obtained from the Serpentine Lizard from his bag. Since he had been in a hurry to escape, he hadn\u2019t checked to see what it actually was.Dammit! It\u2019s just a Revive skill book!He couldn\u2019t help letting out a sigh. Though, in truth, his luck wasn\u2019t actually bad. This skill book was a vital necessity for teams if they wanted to progress in the future, and the sooner they obtained it, the better. Due to this, the current market price was ludicrous. Even if a player listed it for one gold, there would still be plenty of teams making a mad scramble to obtain it.\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd42 \ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd41 \ud83c\udd44\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd3b\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd33 \ud83c\udd35\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd41\ud83c\udd42\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd3d\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd45\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd3b-\ud83c\udd31\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd3d.\ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd3cSkill Book: ReviveDescription: Allows a Priest to revive a fallen comrade.Requirements: Incantation, Gesture, and MaterialProperties: Revive a fallen comrade; can only be cast while outside of combat. This skill requires 10 seconds to channel.Cooldown: 30 secondsRestrictions: Priest; can only be learned by a member of the Righteous faction.He skimmed through its description before storing it back into his bag. It would become quite valuable to him in the future, so he didn\u2019t plan on selling it. Besides, he wasn\u2019t short on money either.After traversing through a vast stretch of thickets, he eventually encountered a ruined city constructed at the center of the marshland. As he approached the city\u2019s perimeter, his gaze fell on the once towering walls that had been eroded by the elements. Upon closer inspection, he could still see traces of its former majesty. Looming past the walls stood an imposing pyramid constructed out of stone slabs, placed at the city center. Even from afar, he could see various characters from the Dark Era carved on each slab, every single one of them radiating an ancient aura.This ancient stronghold experienced countless battles and wars. No one knew what year or what month it happened, but the city had long since been devoid of life. All that remained were the aged pillars and walls that whistled a lonely ballad as the wind passed through them.No mistake, I\u2019ve found the right place!Nie Yan circled the outer perimeter of the city for some time until he found the main gates.He sorted out his inventory before setting foot inside the city gates. As he crossed the threshold from the gates into the passageway, he was met with the sight of countless ruins. Moreover, the instant he entered the walls, the sky suddenly turned dark. It was almost like he had been transported into another dimension. Darkness enshrouded everything, and he could no longer see outside the city. There was only the eerie sight of the ancient ruins in front of him.\u300c System: You\u2019ve discovered the Sulgata Rampart! \u300dHe saw rows upon rows of dilapidated buildings that led to the giant pyramid off in the distance. As he peered through the passageway at the main road, he saw the ghastly bones of the dead littering the pathways, streets, and sidewalks.Suddenly, he felt a cold chill assault the back of his neck. A cold wind blew, and the scattered bones began moving on their own. Seeing this, he hurriedly climbed to a higher vantage point.Shortly after reaching a reasonable height, the countless bones of varying sizes began to assemble together. There were some of short stature, seemingly belonging to Dwarves. Another group looked almost reptilian in nature, if you ignored the enormous bony wings that were growing out of their backs. Presumably, these belonged to the Dragon race. The rest belonged to the Human and Giant races.These undead were what remained of an ancient battle. Countless lives belonging to various races were lost inside this stronghold. Their souls couldn\u2019t move on to the afterlife, so they persisted through the ages and lingered by their remains. As soon as they sensed the breath of the living, they would reanimate their bodies and seek to exterminate its source without fail.Nie Yan scanned over the nearest ones using Transcendent Insight.Skeleton Sentinel (Extremely Frail): Level 10Health: 120/120Skeleton Mage (Extremely Frail): Level 10Health: 80/80Skeleton Ripper (Extremely Frail): Level 10Health: 150/150The skeletons had small health pools, and their attacks weren\u2019t powerful. In addition, they possessed the Extremely Frail modifier, so the level disparity between him and the mobs could be ignored. Even so, their sheer numbers couldn\u2019t be underestimated; the entire passageway was filled to the brim with skeletons. Moreover, since they were undead, they couldn\u2019t bleed nor be stunned. Stealth was also useless against them since they detected the living through the presence of life, not sight.He hurriedly distanced himself from these undead. If they discovered him, they would charge over in a rush to exterminate him.After putting some space between them, he slowly made his way forward. Eventually, he encountered a lone Skeleton Sentinel. He unsheathed his daggers and dashed in. Opening with an Assassinate, he then followed up with Vital Strike and instantly smashed it into smithereens.\u300c System: You\u2019ve successfully slain a Skeleton Sentinel. +200% experience for killing a monster above your level. You\u2019ve received 230 experience points. \u300dThough these skeletons were relatively weak, the experience they gave was quite decent.Just as Nie Yan killed the lone Skeleton Sentinel, a group of Skeleton Sentinels and Skeleton Rippers from across the passage noticed his presence and bolted towards him. There were over a dozen of them running at him like an incoming wave. The Skeleton Rippers were the first to approach as they brandished their blades. The Skeleton Mages behind them raised their staffs. Crimson and pale-white energy coalesced together, forming an otherworldly blaze, and a rain of ice and lightning magic followed as well.God dammit! Why are there so many of them!? he inwardly cried. After a quick glance behind him, he discovered the exit had been sealed off as well. There were skeletons everywhere. He fled from the fight and dashed toward a fork in the path.Although their numbers were great, their movements were clumsy and awkward. Thus, if he didn\u2019t act carelessly, they wouldn\u2019t pose too much of a threat to him.\u300cBang! Bang! Bang!\u300dSeveral spells exploded by his side as he dashed around the corner and escaped the Skeleton Mages\u2019 attack range. As he fled from the skeletons, he observed the path ahead of him and noticed another mob of enemies aggressively charging in his direction.He couldn\u2019t retreat since the rear path was sealed off by skeletons, and he couldn\u2019t advance into the charging skeletons. Nie Yan quickly looked at the walls beside him. They were roughly five meters high, and littered with footholds due to their eroded state. He leapt into the air and scaled the walls.After reaching the top, he gently landed on the other side. There were several Skeleton Mages scattered around the vicinity of this path. In addition, many bones littered the ground, seemingly yet to reanimate.He didn\u2019t dare to be neglectful and dashed towards one of the Skeleton Mages with his daggers raised.After a brief exchange, the Skeleton Mage collapsed to the ground and shattered into fragments.The other Skeleton Mages had already noticed his presence and were in the middle of casting their spells. However, he was lightning fast and quickly finished them off one by one. Afterward, as he began picking up the items that dropped, the bones on the ground trembled and began reassembling themselves.He didn\u2019t stay any longer and promptly fled towards the exit.However, as his feet stepped past a few tiles on the floor, he felt a slight vibration beneath his feet. Though it had been extremely minute, he still detected it immediately.Traps!He hastily jumped to the side.\u300cBoom!\u300dThe tile he had stepped on exploded, sending debris flying everywhere. Several of the nearby skeletons had been caught by the explosion and were blown away. The shock from the blast destroyed them as they collapsed into a pile of bone fragments.Some of the shrapnel from the explosion also struck his body and caused several damage values to rise above his head.\u221212\u221213\u221215He broke out in a cold sweat as he lay sprawled on the ground. These landmines were extremely terrifying. If he had taken the full brunt of that explosion, he wouldn\u2019t have even left a complete corpse behind.Although the landmines were dangerous, with a single explosion being able to instantly kill a Thief, there was a slight two-second window before they actually detonated. As long as he maintained his awareness, he could pass through safely without a hitch.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 - Cursed SkullPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 77 - Cursed SkullNie Yan climbed back to his feet and dashed toward his destination, clearing out the skeletons as he travelled along the narrow, twisting passages of the Sulgata Rampart. After clearing out several passages, and finishing off the last nearby Skeleton Mage, his experience bar had risen by two percent. Along the way he had picked up many items, though he still hadn\u2019t had the time to sort them out yet.As he advanced onwards, he eventually encountered an area with no skeletal remains. Finally... This ought to be a safe area.He sat down and began sorting through the items he had recently picked up: twenty-seven coppers and two subpar pieces of Bronze equipment.Just as he was about to close his inventory menu, a shabby-looking scroll at the bottom corner of the window caught his eye. Only then did he recall that he had obtained such an item. He must have picked it up from that Skeleton Mage he destroyed earlier.Written on this yellowed scroll were the ancient characters of the Dragon race. It read: \u201cAncient spirits awaken from within the shadows.\u201dIt was a special one-use item called a Spirit Summoning Scroll. As the name suggests, the player could summon an ancient spirit by activating this scroll. However, there were downsides. In the event that the player failed to control the spirit, they would be devoured in turn.It was quite an uncommon item. In Sulgata, the likelihood of it dropping was one in two thousand. So, if one were lucky, they\u2019d obtain it every so often while killing skeletons in the area. The ghost summoned by this item wasn\u2019t all that strong. At best, it could be used as a meat-shield. However, in an area like Sulgata that was filled with countless roaming skeletons, this item was surprisingly handy.Though, there was a slight problem. His low level would make it difficult for him to control the summoned ghost, which meant that it was highly possible it would try to devour him.Hmm... should I use it or not?Nie Yan pondered for a moment. If I\u2019m capable of controlling it, then I\u2019ll have a meat shield at my disposal. If I fail, however, my only loss will be a scroll.With those thoughts in mind, he turned and surveyed his surroundings. It\u2019s pretty spacious here, and for the time being, there won\u2019t be any monsters to disturb me.After thinking for a bit, he bit into his thumb and pressed it onto the scroll, using his blood to draw a dark red mark.As his blood gradually seeped into its fibres, the scroll began to radiate with a faint glow.The ancient seals written on the scroll were slowly beginning to activate.Soon, a dark ghastly energy emerged from the scroll and gradually condensed into the form of a person. The spirit he summoned was a Ghost Assassin. It appeared translucent and held a shadowy dagger in its hands.Ghost Assassin: Level 10Health: 230/230Its stats actually weren\u2019t bad for a Level 10 summon. In his previous timeline, he had also used this item when he was Level 10 or so. In those days, the price of a Spirit Summoning Scroll was about eight silvers, which wasn\u2019t considered to be very expensive as the average player was able to buy them. If he were to sell the scroll at the marketplace now, then considering its current rarity, it would probably go for around ten silvers.The Ghost Assassin\u2019s combat strength was decent, and it had a summon duration of thirty minutes. It also possessed three skills: Shroud, Concussive Blow, and Self-Detonate. With this summon at his side, his levelling speed would certainly increase significantly.After being summoned, the Ghost Assassin didn\u2019t move at all. Instead, it scanned the surroundings with its cold eyes.Nie Yan attempted to control the ghost, but it didn\u2019t budge an inch. He tried once more, and this time, it actually moved.I succeeded? His heart filled with pleasant surprise. With the Ghost Assassin by his side, he\u2019d have an extra hand to help fight the skeletons.Contrary to his expectations, however, the Ghost Assassin\u2019s dagger flashed with a cold glint as it suddenly dashed toward him.Shit, this asshole is trying to devour me!This wasn\u2019t entirely unexpected, though, as he never had high hopes to begin with when he summoned it. His level was simply too low. Moreover, the ghost wasn\u2019t merely a level or two above him, it was five entire levels above him. Controlling it couldn\u2019t have been an easy matter.In the event that the player failed to control the summoned creature, they would be the first thing the summon would aggro onto.As it sped toward him, Nie Yan rapidly pulled back and dodged the Ghost Assassin\u2019s oncoming attack. Then, seeing an opening, he quickly pounced forward and went on the offensive.\u201cVital Strike!\u201d Nie Yan shouted out as he slashed his dagger across the Ghost Assassin\u2019s neck.Yet, the attack seemed to be ineffective as its shadowy neck simply restored itself almost instantly after being cut. Brandishing the dagger in its hand, that ghastly being dashed forward and answered with an attack of its own.Nie Yan was forced back onto the defensive and had to constantly retreat as they fought. Their positions were ever changing as they moved about the area. This ghost was much stronger than those frail skeletons. Thankfully, he had only summoned a Ghost Assassin and not something tankier. So although he was five levels below it, his damage wasn\u2019t insignificant.\u221223\u221225Two damage values rose above the Ghost Assassin\u2019s head.After losing a sizable chunk of health, the ghost\u2019s body began to sway and fade, eventually disappearing from sight.Nie Yan had lost sight of his target. No matter how hard he concentrated while searching, he was unable to detect its position. The level discrepancy between them was just too large, so he was unable to see through the Ghost Assassin\u2019s Shroud.He cautiously retreated to a nearby wall, then pressed his back against the stone so he would only have to face attacks from the front.Suddenly, the nearby shadows flickered and a silhouette emerged at his side. The dagger in its hands deftly struck towards his head.The Ghost Assassin was also capable of using Concussive Blow, and Nie Yan was a goner if he let himself get stunned.Seeing the dagger approach, he quickly sidestepped the attack and avoided a perilous situation.But just as he dodged the attack, the Ghost Assassin turned its blade back and lashed out at Nie Yan again, though this time, its dagger transformed into three flashes of light before it struck.\u221252, \u221257, \u221256\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd42 \ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd41 \ud83c\udd44\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd3b\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd33 \ud83c\udd35\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd41\ud83c\udd42\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd3d\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd45\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd3b-\ud83c\udd31\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd3d.\ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd3cThe unexpected chain of attacks cost him the greater half of his health. Nie Yan hurriedly pulled back, just narrowly evading the Ghost Assassin\u2019s second flurry of attacks, then leapt away to put some distance between them.He took out a Basic Health Potion and poured its contents down his throat, instantly restoring thirty health. Seeing the Ghost Assassin draw near, Nie Yan swung out his right arm and attempted to hit it in the head with a Concussive Blow.The Ghost Assasin\u2019s head split in two from the force of the strike, but rapidly began recovering to its original shape.While its head recovered, the ghost halted its movements for several seconds. And those few seconds were all Nie Yan needed to unload enough attacks to bring it down to a third of its health.He proved to be a bit too greedy with his attacks, though, as he continued attacking even after the stun had worn off. He didn\u2019t have time to react as the Ghost Assassin slashed at his chest.\u221276A critical hit! The attack reduced his health to thirteen percent, leaving him badly frightened. Without sparing a second, he quickly fell back with Swift Retreat and applied a Combat Bandage.+20... +20... +20...The Ghost Assassin had no intention to let him rest as it rushed towards him with a dagger aimed right for his head.Nie Yan dodge rolled to the side, evading the attack, then swiftly retaliated with Assassinate. His dagger slashed across the Ghost Assassin\u2019s chest.His attack also dealt a critical hit and brought the Ghost Assassin down to five percent health.The Ghost Assassin suddenly let out a cry as its body turned a dark shade of red and began to rapidly expand and violently surge with energy.It wants to self-destruct!The explosion from a Ghost Assassin self-destructing was especially terrifying. He had been caught in such an explosion before in his past, and it caused him to lose over eighty percent of his health. But that was when he was Level 10. As a Level 5, he probably wouldn\u2019t even be left with a complete corpse.Judging that it was too late to escape the blast radius, he rushed at the Ghost Assassin and planted his dagger in its throat.Vital Strike!The Ghost Assassin\u2019s health fell to zero, and its Self-Detonate was cancelled. As it dissolved into thin air, it let out a single mournful cry.\u201cHah... Hah... Hah...\u201d Nie Yan gasped for air. That bastard was more difficult than I thought.As he recovered his stamina, his eyes happened to glance over the ground. It actually dropped something!Although the Ghost Assassin was a summon, as soon as it broke away from the summoner\u2019s control, it would become indistinguishable from common mobs. This meant that it could drop items upon death like any other mob.Nie Yan bent down and grasped the item that had dropped. Upon further inspection, it appeared to be a skull that was roughly the size of his palm. Numerous delicate patterns and designs were carved onto the top of the skull, and there were even two green gems embedded in its sockets.Cursed Skull (Fate Item)62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78 - Fate DicePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 78 - Fate DiceFate Items were spread by the powers of the Chaos Faction. They were extremely rare items and often possessed unimaginable effects.This information came from the dark region known as the Underworld, an area filled with pestilence and blight. There, countless creatures roamed amongst the lands dotted with ancient tombs. In addition to that, the land was also where the undead flourished, being home to wraiths, skeletons, ghouls, and all other sorts of dark entities. Aside from evil Necromancers, who beckoned the unliving with their magic, no others could approach this land.The Spirit Summoning Scroll was an item used to bypass countless layers of earth and summon spiritual entities directly from the Underworld, most of which had never seen the light of day.Some Fate Items served as catalysts for Necromancers to summon spirits, while others were dark items that contained powerful curses. Though no matter what their use was, not even Necromancers were fully capable of controlling these items as they desired.Just like their name suggested, the outcome of using a Fate Item could only be left up to fate.Nie Yan read over the Cursed Skull\u2019s description.In order to activate its effect, the player was required to crush the skull, whereupon three Fate Dice would be summoned. Once activated, there was no turning back. The player must roll each die; otherwise, they would be cursed. If a four or higher was rolled, then the player would receive a reward. If the player rolled a three or lower, however, they would be inflicted with a curse based on the result\u2014the lower the roll, the heavier the penalty. Inversely, the higher the roll, the greater the reward.Be it a reward or a curse, opportunity and risk were two sides of the same coin.Additionally, the Cursed Skull would disappear if it wasn\u2019t used within five minutes.After he finished reading the description, Nie Yan felt an indescribable sensation in his chest. The outcome of using this item was hard to predict. This was because the summoned dice were rolled by the system, which meant it was impossible to cheat, and thus the end result depended entirely on luck. This meant each roll had a fifty percent chance to be a boon and an equal chance to be a curse.Nie Yan calmly sat on the ground and started eating a loaf of bread to replenish his health, though his state of mind was anything but tranquil.Gaaaah! It all depends on my luck! Even he couldn\u2019t say for sure whether his luck was good or bad. While pondering about what his next action would be, Nie Yan closely examined the skull in the palm of his hands. The skull had a gem embedded in each eye, and they were flickering with a ghastly light. As he stared into the eyes, he felt as though they were staring back, watching him.It was calling to him, telling him that it was simply providing him an opportunity. As for whether he dared to challenge fate, that choice was solely up to him.The future was filled with uncertainty.Nie Yan firmly grasped the skull in his hand, despite still being entirely hesitant about what he should do. If he delayed his choice any longer, then the Fate Item would vanish without a trace.He endlessly questioned himself to the point of torture. In such a situation, no one would dare make a rash decision.As the minutes and seconds continued to pass by, he suddenly recalled an old folktale in the game. It was about an old man who arrived in a village carrying a sealed chest. The old man entered the village square and told the residents that he would unlock the chest and give all the contents within it to whomever paid him a silver. Yet in the end, not even a single villager was willing to spend the money for the chest. Eventually, the old man left; however, from then on the residents of that village would often lose sleep as they tossed and turned in bed, recalling the old man and his mysterious chest. They regretted not paying the silver and getting to the bottom of that chest.The moral of the story was quite simple, and it applied to his current situation rather well. If he didn\u2019t use this Cursed Skull and let it fade away, then perhaps he would end up like those villagers, endlessly thinking back to one event with regret.There\u2019s no harm in trying my luck... Nie Yan firmed his resolve and gradually exerted more strength on the skull in his right hand.\u300cCrack!\u300dIt began to split under the pressure as he gritted his teeth.\u300cPop!\u300dthe Cursed Skull was crushed into pieces.The next twenty seconds passed in complete silence, as if everything in the vicinity had been frozen in time.Suddenly, an enormous bone-white, six-sided Fate Die emerged in the sky, suspended directly above Nie Yan. Each face had a different number carved into it; one to six appeared in ancient, crimson red characters belonging to the Spirit race.It awaited his attempt to challenge fate!After taking in a deep breath, Nie Yan slowly extended his right arm. As his hand hovered over one of the floating die, it began to spin at an incredible speed, with the number facing him changing at a rapid pace.The scene was easily capable of making a person\u2019s head spin from dizziness.\u201cStop!\u201d As soon as he called out, the rapidly spinning Fate Die immediately came to a rest, and the number was revealed before him. The bolded character was in a shade of red that resembled blood.Shit... I\u2019m out of luck.Almost immediately, a sinister, malicious energy covered his entire body and slowly drained his Strength.\u300c Pestilence of the Frail: Your Strength has been permanently reduced by 10. \u300dThe terrifying curse sent chills down his spine and caused his heart to freeze over. Even if he was a top expert, losing ten Strength was still incredibly difficult to bear.Each stat point was as precious as the next. Not to mention that, outside of leveling, permanently raising a stat by even a single point was an extremely challenging task.To Nie Yan, it seemed as though the scarlet number painted on the die had transformed into the slithering tongue of a devil; flamboyant and alluring, it gazed at him in a mocking manner.The die had only landed on a three yet it had permanently reduced his Strength by ten points. He had a hard time imagining what sort of severe curse he would\u2019ve come under if it had landed on a two or even possibly a one.Even worse, he still had two more rolls to go. He didn\u2019t dare think about the consequences that potentially awaited him. Would he end up a cripple? In that case, he would have to delete his character and start all over again.His fate was unknown.And because it was unknown, it was all the more terrifying to think of.However, he couldn\u2019t back out now. The next Fate Die was quietly floating in the air. If he didn\u2019t roll before a certain amount of time passed, he would be automatically cursed regardless.Was he regretting his decision? No. To be more accurate, he didn\u2019t have the time for regret. He hovered his right hand over the second die, causing it to rapidly spin in the air. He didn\u2019t know if the next roll was going to be a dazzling reward or a debilitating curse. Though, no matter the outcome, he was unable to escape this trial of fate.What if it\u2019s another curse...? No, it definitely won\u2019t be!\u201cStop!\u201d Nie Yan called out. The tone of his voice revealed his faltering resolve compared to earlier, but he still pressed on regardless.The ivory-white Fate Die was akin to a snake coiling itself around his heart. The sound of the die stopping practically caused his heart to stop beating.Five! It landed on a five! Then, a white radiance descended over him, and he felt as though a huge weight had been lifted. It\u2019s not a curse!As long as it\u2019s not a curse, then it\u2019s okay!Nie Yan regained his calm and checked the system announcement, whereupon he immediately checked his skill window. There was an extra skill in one of the slots!Undead Rite (Undead Temple Magic - Rank 1): Sacrifice 30% health for a 20% chance of controlling a targeted undead for three hours. The player can only control a maximum of 5 undead at one time.

When he saw Undead Rite, he couldn\u2019t help but feel excited. It was actually Temple Magic! Elemental Hall Magic and Undead Temple Magic were both classified as high-level skills. After losing ten points of Strength, this seemed like a reasonable return. After all, since he had the Chapter of Courage, it was possible to make up for the permanent loss in Strength after twenty-five levels. In addition, this rare skill was a priceless treasure! In the future, he\u2019d have an advantage when levelling and traversing areas filled with undead!Unfortunately, that was where the celebrations would come to an end. The last die floating in the air caused him to gaze at it with a complex expression. This item could truly allow a player to reach the heavens in a single bound. At the same time, however, it could also consign a player to the deepest layers of hell.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It could grant a person a short respite during their time of suffering, only to send them straight to eternal damnation afterwards.Life, or death? Nobody knew for certain what fate had in store for them.If he wasn\u2019t willing to take on the risks, he wouldn\u2019t have crushed the skull in the first place.Nie Yan forcefully calmed his mind and extended his hand over the die. A bountiful reward, or a malignant curse, the final result of his gamble would remain shrouded in mystery until this final die came to a stop.The Fate Die began to spin and tumble in the air as his unknown fate beckoned to him.Seeing the die rotating at a dizzying speed, he broke out in a cold sweat. Please... Please don\u2019t let it be a curse!\u201cStop!\u201d He felt like his heart was going to explode out of his chest.The die immediately halted, and the strange demonic character revealed before his eyes was shockingly... a five! Another five! Perhaps five was his lucky number!The surprising result of the final roll left Nie Yan feeling an indescribable amount of bliss. His only hope was that he wouldn\u2019t roll another curse. He never actually thought that he would receive a reward, much less what the reward might be.After all, rolling three Fate Dice wasn\u2019t something an ordinary player could afford. This extremely dangerous gamble made him feel as though his heart had been constricted from all the stress.\u300c System: You\u2019ve received Pandora\u2019s Box. \u300dPandora\u2019s Box (Fate Item)What the hell! Another Fate Item!? The first one had already given him enough of a headache, yet he was given a second one! If this one was just like the first and could cause him to be cursed, then he\u2019d rather have it disappear. After experiencing the fickle nature of the Fate Dice, he vowed to never partake in such a terrifying gamble again.Partaking in a dangerous gamble like that just once was more than enough, so he wouldn\u2019t regret letting the second chance disappear.Pandora\u2019s Box was a perfectly shaped, silver-gray cube. On each face was a different carving depicting various things such as a sinister skull, a fiendish devil, an angel, and so on. Not only were the carvings both vivid and lifelike, they were also meticulously detailed.In addition, these carvings seemed to be imbued with a peculiar energy.Nie Yan examined Pandora\u2019s Box a bit more closely. Fortunately for him, it didn\u2019t fall under the same category as the Cursed Skull. In fact, it was actually quite the treasure!Pandora\u2019s Box (Fate Item)Item Description\u27a2Insert three pieces of equipment of equal grade into Pandora\u2019s Box for a 10% chance of obtaining a piece of equipment of a higher grade. All pieces of equipment are destroyed upon failure.\u27a2Insert a piece of equipment and a Fortune Gem for a chance of raising its grade by one. Upon failure, the piece of equipment is demoted by a grade.\u27a2Counter (cycle = 3 seconds) begins when activated. If cycle number is even, Luck +5. If cycle is odd, Luck \u22125.User Restriction: Can be used by all factions.This item was actually quite a rarity. Although he had heard of such an item in the past, Nie Yan had never actually come across one himself. In addition, it didn\u2019t lose out one bit to Legendary-grade equipment in value. He could put three pieces of Gold equipment inside Pandora\u2019s Box for a ten percent chance of getting a piece of Dark Gold equipment in return. Of course, there was a ninety percent chance of failure as well, which meant the loss of all the items he had inserted, but the potential return was well worth the risk. For example, if he inserted three pieces of Dark Gold equipment into the box, he had a chance of obtaining a piece of Sub-Legendary equipment! The slight caveat was that very few players would actually dare to stake three pieces of Dark Gold equipment on such a gamble. After all, equipment of that rarity was extremely expensive and hard to obtain.The second method allowed the player to raise the grade of their equipment by using Fortune Gems. These gems were expensive items created by Jewelcrafters that increased the success rate of inserting gems into equipment sockets. Usually their market price averaged around five silvers, but the real challenge was actually finding them being listed up for sale. Moreover, most of those who bought these gems couldn\u2019t bear to actually use them.The item\u2019s ability to affect Luck was also very useful. It could influence the drop rate, crafting success rate, etc... Five points might not sound like much, but it was actually quite a significant amount of Luck. It could increase the drop rate when killing monsters by two hundred percent, crafting success rate by one-fifth, and so on. As for the inverse when the player\u2019s Luck was reduced by five points... Let\u2019s just say that, at that point, anything that could go wrong, was guaranteed to go wrong.This item would basically divide the player\u2019s time into two periods: one where they would be the luckiest man in the world, and one where they would be the most unfortunate soul in existence.Nie Yan pondered for a moment. It wasn\u2019t necessarily a lucky item, but he could try his best to trigger events when the timer was on an even cycle. Even though three seconds passed by in the blink of an eye, he was confident he would be able to gauge the timing properly.This blessing had arrived so abruptly that he had yet to figure out what item grade Pandora\u2019s Box belonged to. This was quite the conundrum, one he\u2019d certainly need to slowly research lest he miss any details. But that was a task for the future, right now he needed to get moving. After standing up, Nie Yan stored Pandora\u2019s Box away in his bag. It seemed that in this gamble, the risks had brought more reward than punishment.Realizing that he was one step closer to understanding one of the many mysteries of fate, Nie Yan felt his heart beat fluctuate.As soon as the Fate Dice disappeared, time in the area seemed to start moving again. The frozen skeletons in the distance resumed their movements and once again began closing in with the intent of surrounding him.Many skeletons who had seen Nie Yan while patrolling the area attempted to get closer to him, but upon drawing near, they simply stopped in their tracks. It wasn\u2019t until the Fate Dice disappeared that they finally resumed their pursuit. Because of this, a large mob of skeletons had gradually built up nearby. When Nie Yan looked over, he saw them packed tighter than sardines in a tin can.\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd42 \ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd41 \ud83c\udd44\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd3b\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd33 \ud83c\udd35\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd41\ud83c\udd42\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd3d\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd45\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd3b-\ud83c\udd31\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd3d.\ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd3c\u201cSo many skeletons!\u201d Nie Yan didn\u2019t dare stay here any longer and hastily fled towards a nearby wall.The outer district of Sulgata resembled an immense labyrinth. He didn\u2019t even know his own location. He was simply relying on his own judgement as he moved towards the gigantic pyramid that stood at the center of the city.While navigating the city, the distant pyramid made for a convenient landmark.The skeletons didn\u2019t stop their pursuit. As soon as the Skeleton Mages got within range, they raised their staffs and rained magic down upon his location.Nie Yan leaped into the air, and just as he set foot on top of the wall...\u300cBoom! Boom! Boom!\u300dThe volley of spells battered the wall and sent a large amount of debris flying everywhere.\u208b21, \u208b27, \u208b25...Numerous damage values rose above Nie Yan\u2019s head, bringing his health down to a third after only a single round of spells. There were just too many Skeleton Mages below him.After drinking a Health Potion, he jumped down to the other side.His landing was graceful, but that didn\u2019t mean he was out of danger yet. The only way Nie Yan saw to shake off the skeletons was to deviate from his current path, which would bring him further and further from the pyramid at the center. However, he had no other choice. He had to lose the skeletons that were pursuing him.Nie Yan eventually came across an opening that seemed to lead to one of the city\u2019s public squares. Even further off in the distance, he was able to make out a colosseum. It must\u2019ve surely been an imposing sight back in its prime, but now it was nothing more than ruins\u2014surely the work of several centuries of erosion. Even though it was now in ruins, when Nie Yan stared at the dilapidated relic from a long gone era, he was still able to imagine how it would\u2019ve looked in the past.\u300c System: You\u2019ve discovered Sulgata Colosseum! \u300dSo it was the city\u2019s colosseum. Nie Yan had been through this area in the past, but he never actually took the time to look around and explore this colosseum.While making his way through the plaza, Nie Yan suddenly felt something give underneath his foot. It\u2019s a pitfall! He had been too distracted by the imposing sight of the colosseum in the distance, and didn\u2019t bother to examine the area for traps. Thus, in his carelessness, he ended up stepping right into a trap.Nie Yan suddenly leapt forward in an attempt to jump away before the ground beneath him completely collapsed. To his shock, however, he discovered that the pitfall trap he had stumbled into was gigantic. It spanned over twenty meters wide. How could he possibly leap that far away?Before he could get away, the ground collapsed, sending Nie Yan into a free fall.He didn\u2019t know how deep the pitfall was, so he readied his Featherfall Gem. If the pitfall was too high, he\u2019d have no choice but to use it to prevent himself from dying from fall damage.\u300c Thud! \u300d However, those worries seemed to be unnecessary as he landed on the ground and only a twenty-six rose above his head. It seemed the pitfall wasn\u2019t too deep, only around ten meters at most.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 - Controlling the UndeadPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 80 - Controlling the UndeadNie Yan had fallen into a square room surrounded by prison cells. Above him hung several Night Pearls which illuminated the area below. As he took a good look at his surroundings, he then realized just what kind of place he had fallen into.He was likely dropped into an underground dungeon. On either side of him were two enclosures with stout metal bars which firmly prevented escape. As he peered through the gaps and into the enclosures, he saw a gigantic set of bones in each one. The bone piles reached roughly four meters in height, and he could see enormous tails, skeletal wings, and lizard-like skulls mixed in. These two skeletal remains had most likely been dragons when they were alive!Since this dungeon wasn\u2019t too far from the Sulgata Colosseum, it seemed these dragons were forced to fight in the gladiatorial arena.As prisoners of the colosseum, all of their freedoms were wrested away, and they were made into tools of entertainment for the nobility. When Sulgata finally fell, they were most likely abandoned and kept locked in their cells, left to starve, and eventually turning into skeletons.While Nie Yan was lost in thought, the two bone piles suddenly trembled and slowly began to reassemble.\u300cRoaaaar! Roaar!\u300dThe two skeletons let out indignant cries which reverberated across the entire dungeon. They resembled two vicious beasts as they charged at Nie Yan.\u300cBang!\u300dThe iron bars of their cells violently shuddered after being rammed by their large skeletal frames. Their cages slightly contorted as the bars had been bent askew from the collisions.The skeletal dragons cried out furiously as they repeatedly slammed into their enclosure, causing the metal bars to warp just a little more each time. Nie Yan felt their cages wouldn\u2019t be able to hold on much longer due to the continuous impacts.These dragons probably held great resentment and vexation during their passing. Thus, their souls were unable to move on, and they became undead. They were much stronger than ordinary undead, and their dark red bones possessed a metallic lustre.Nie Yan used Transcendent Insight to examine these skeletal dragons.Undead Dragon Gladiator (Leader): Level 10Health 600/600They were Leader-class monsters, and they shared a common trait among most skeletal undead. Their healths were much lower in comparison to their living counterparts. Even then, these two Level 10 Leader-class monsters still weren\u2019t something he could handle.The Undead Dragons could easily kill him.He glanced at the walls of the pitfall above him; it was too high. It would be impossible for him to climb out of it even with the aid of the Silk Spinner Ring. As he looked around for somewhere to escape, his eyes happened to fall on a tunnel in the distance that appeared to be the dungeon\u2019s exit. However, the tunnel was sealed off by an iron gate. The gate was firmly clamped shut by a giant padlock. He didn\u2019t have any thoughts of smashing the gate open, it simply wasn\u2019t possible. He wasn\u2019t like those Undead Dragons who possessed large bodies and robust frames.After the repeated collisions from the Undead Dragons, many metals bars were visibly damaged and bent out of shape. The cages were becoming increasingly weaker with every passing second, and eventually, they collapsed, freeing the skeletal dragons as they charged towards Nie Yan.Simultaneously facing off against two Level 10 Leader-class monsters in a such a confined space would result in his untimely demise.The two large skeletal frames came barreling towards him from the sky. They possessed bones even stronger than metal, a powerful body that was full of strength, and a giant tail covered in bony spikes. No matter what he did, it would be impossible to defeat them.It was hopeless to try and fight them directly; thus, he quickly scanned his eyes over his skill bar. He could only entrust his life into this final hope\u2014Undead Rite!This skill was the only thing that could save him since it had a twenty percent chance of controlling a targeted undead. Whether he lived or died all depended on this skill succeeding!Due to the level disparity between him and the Undead Dragon, he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d succeed in controlling it.In the same instant the skeletal dragons neared, Nie Yan activated the skill and targeted one of them.Undead Rite!\u300c System: You\u2019ve targeted Undead Dragon Gladiator with Undead Rite. Your health has been reduced by 30%. \u300d\u300c System: Undead Rite has failed! \u300dAs soon as he read the system notification, Nie Yan activated Swift Retreat and rolled out of the way.A giant tail whipped towards where he had just been standing.\u300cBoom!\u300dClouds of dust rose into the air, and large cracks were left on the ground where the tail had struck.Since the two dragons had charged at him at the same time, one of them ended up ramming the other, so they were both sent staggering several steps back due to the impact.Taking advantage of this brief window, Nie Yan activated Undead Rite once again, though the attempt was shortly followed by an announcement of the spell\u2019s failure. Thus, before the dragons recovered from the collision, he rolled past their legs. Managing to stabilize himself with some difficulty, he then fled to the nearest corner.Not only did the Undead Dragons miss with their attacks, they lost track of their target as well. Ghastly green flames flickered in their eye sockets as they searched for Nie Yan\u2019s whereabouts, eventually finding him hidden in the corner.Shortly after discovering Nie Yan, one of the skeletal dragons lifted its leg and attempted to crush him.Read m0re at nO\u03bdE\u2113n(E)X\u0442Nie Yan hastily ducked out of the way.\u300cBoom!\u300dThe stomp left a deep imprint in the floor.Following the first one\u2019s attack, the other skeletal dragon attempted to stomp him as well.He was frightened half to death as he continuously evaded their attacks. Fortunately for him, the narrow passages of this dungeon further limited the movements of the already clumsy undead, and since their attacks were relatively slow, he was able to barely hang onto his life. However, if this battle continued to drag on at its current pace, he would probably end up dead regardless.Undead Rite!\u300c System: You\u2019ve targeted Undead Dragon Gladiator with Undead Rite. Your health has been reduced by 30%. \u300d\u300c System: Undead Rite has failed! \u300dNow that Undead Rite had failed three times in a row, Nie Yan only had a tenth of his health remaining. While evading the attacks, he pulled out a Basic Recovery Potion, downed its contents, and then applied a Combat Bandage to himself.After evading the skeletal dragons\u2019 attacks for several breaths of time, Nie Yan cast Undead Rite once again when his health bar recovered to fifty-two percent.In the same moment, the two skeletal dragons attacked!\u300c System: Undead Rite has succeeded! \u300dShortly after the system announcement appeared, Nie Yan felt a strange energy being birthed in his mind. The energy rose above his head and shot straight at one of the skeletal dragons, disappearing into its body.With Undead Rite succeeding, Nie Yan rolled out of the way and evaded the oncoming dragons.\u300cBoom!\u300dThe dragons missed their target and rammed into each other, the impact stunning both and sending them staggering several steps back.In the meantime, Nie Yan hid in a corner and attentively gazed at the dragon he had taken control of using Undead Rite.Did I actually succeed? What\u2019s the result?Nie Yan didn\u2019t have high expectations in successfully controlling the Undead Dragon due to the level disparity between them. Thus, despite the announcement, he didn\u2019t dare to confirm if he had truly succeeded. This was possibly his last chance at survival; if he missed this opportunity, there would be no more.Two skeletal dragons and Nie Yan formed a triangle as they stood in this narrow underground dungeon.However, at this moment, the two dragons were staring at each other.Time seemed to flow in reverse. returning Sulgata to its prime. When beasts and gladiators fought in the barbarous colosseum. Blood splattered everywhere, painting a vibrant scenery of crimson red.The dragon who had been targeted by Undead Rite stood there blankly, staring out into space. The ghastly flames in its eyes seemed to be affected by some sort of foreign energy.\u300cBoom! Boom!\u300dIt slightly shook about as if trying to break free of the fetters binding it.\u201cPlease, God... Please let it succeed!\u201d Nie Yan prayed for the skill to succeed. In reality, he was an atheist and didn\u2019t actually believe in God or any divine deities. However, there was a certain entity in Conviction\u2014God of Light\u2014that could be considered God, and at this point in time, he became a devout and pious follower.The other dragon suddenly took action and leapt at Nie Yan.It pressed toward him and aimed to end his life.Just as the skeletal dragon leaped into the air, the other dragon, who had been targeted by Undead Rite prior, rammed into its side.\u300cBoom!\u300dThe two dragons collided again, and the one that was attacking Nie Yan was sent flying.Perhaps some divine existence took pity on Nie Yan and answered his prayers because Undead Rite had unexpectedly succeeded in controlling the dragon just in the nick of time!Under the effects of Undead Rite, a glowing black aura emerged over the dark reddish hues of the skeletal dragon\u2019s bones, transforming it into a huge metallic beast that brimmed with berserk power.\u300c System: Set a name for your new servant? \u300dNie Yan thought for a moment and decided to name this dragon, Dark Gladiator. It seemed appropriate, considering its appearance.After being successfully controlled by Undead Rite, Dark Gladiator\u2019s stats rose by ten percent. The already formidable skeletal dragon had become even more of a matchless powerhouse. Its only weak point was it could only act as a temporary companion and only lasted for three hours, whereupon its soul would be consumed by Undead Rite.It was hard to imagine that someone could possess control over such a terrifying monster.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81- Dark GladiatorPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 81- Dark GladiatorDark Gladiator relentlessly attacked the other skeletal dragon and flung it across the underground dungeon, smashing it heavily into the walls.\u300cBoom! Boom! Boom!\u300dThe sound of thunderous strikes reverberated through the air as the skeletal dragon was battered left and right across the dungeon. Amidst the relentless assault, the skeletal dragon found an opening and retaliated, whipping its tail at Dark Gladiator\u2019s chest!\u300cBoom!\u300dThe force of the attack forced Dark Gladiator several steps back. However, Dark Gladiator seemed virtually unaffected as it resumed its assault and rushed at the skeletal dragon again.As the fighting intensified, Dark Gladiator and the Undead Dragon resembled two ancient behemoths in a life-and-death struggle.While the two dragons fought, Nie Yan retrieved his Crossbow of Blood from his inventory and adeptly loaded it with the Blackgold Bolts that dealt on-hit true damage. Propping the crossbow to his chest, he aligned the sights on his target and fired.\u300cWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u300dThe bolts struck the skeletal dragon causing three damage values to rise above its head. Although the damage wasn\u2019t ludicrously high, it was still significant. At the minimum, the bolts dealt thirty to forty points in combined damage. In one instance, an armor-break occurred, and Nie Yan was able to deal upwards of a hundred damage.The two dragons were engaged in an all-out brawl, and despite the hectic battle, Nie Yan was still able to fire at the other skeletal dragon with pinpoint accuracy.Nie Yan felt it was quite unfortunate that it took him four attempts to control one of the skeletal dragons using Undead Rite. Moreover, in order to cast it the fourth time, he had been forced to use all of his recovery items to replenish his depleted health as quickly as possible.He glanced at his remaining health\u2014not even sufficient to cast another Undead Rite. Although he felt uncomfortable with his health being so low, he could do nothing about it since his Combat Bandages and other health recovery items were still on cooldown.Dark Gladiator\u2019s relentless attacks and Nie Yan\u2019s continuous fire eventually brought the skeletal dragon down to critical health.He originally planned to turn this remaining skeletal dragon into his servant as well, but looking at the current situation, such an idea was no longer possible since Dark Gladiator didn\u2019t have much health remaining either. If he allowed the battle to drag on and purposefully delayed dealing the killing blow, Dark Gladiator would certainly end up being killed by the other skeletal dragon. After spending so much health obtaining one skeletal dragon, he wasn\u2019t willing to let it die without serving him to its full potential.At the twenty-second mark since the battle began, Dark Gladiator lashed out with its claws and struck the other skeletal dragon in the chest, simultaneously alleviating the opponent of its remaining health. Following the other skeleton dragon\u2019s death, a ghastly ball of flame emerged from its chest and floated upward before gradually disappearing in the air. The skeleton, now a shell without an owner, shattered and loudly crashed to the floor.\u300cJingle! Jingle!\u300dAs soon as the dragon collapsed, a melodious tune rang out as a bright radiance emerged from Nie Yan\u2019s body. He had finally levelled up to Level 6.He gained a sizable amount of experience for killing the Level 10 Undead Dragon Gladiator. Due to it being five levels above him, he received seventeen-fold of its base experience value.Nie Yan walked toward the bone pile and collected the items that dropped from the Undead Dragon. The item was surprisingly a pair of Gold-grade shoulder guards: 57\u201362 defense, Strength +13, and Resilience +17. It was definitely a good piece of equipment. He reckoned he could sell it for quite a bit in the auction house.Let alone one that gave bonuses in Strength and Resilience, even if a pair of Gold-grade shoulder guards had undesirable properties, based on the raw defense they provided alone, they would still sell for a decent price. The value of this piece of equipment was only slightly lower than the Lion King\u2019s Shield he planned to sell to Bladelight.No buyer should even think of taking these shoulder guards off his hands if they didn\u2019t offer at least twenty silvers. Naturally, this didn\u2019t apply to acquaintances or friends who wanted to purchase them. In that case, it would depend on how friendly he was with the person.After killing the Undead Dragon Gladiator and reaching Level 6, his experience bar filled by thirteen percent. When he checked the player ladder, the current top rank player was a Level 8. Moreover, they were a Mage. In Conviction, no matter how fast a Thief could kill monsters, they would still never compare to a Mage. Some powerful Mages were even able to easily kill monsters above their levels by kiting, taking advantage of terrain, or casting high-level spells. Skilled Mages could even solo-kill certain bosses without taking damage, an incredibly difficult task for melee professions. Of course, these norms didn\u2019t apply to an extreme outlier such as him.Nie Yan glanced at Dark Gladiator who lumbered over to his side. Its enormous body was covered with scratches and deep cut marks. However, they were healing at a pace even visible to the naked eye, and it wasn\u2019t a simple recovery either. Rather than restoring to their original state, razor-sharp talons resembling blades began forming on the skeletal dragon\u2019s claws, and its appearance became much more terrifying. The ghastly, pale cyan flames in its eye sockets flickered, radiating a deathly cold energy that made others not dare to stare at it straight-on.Despite its imposing appearance, Dark Gladiator lowered its enormous skull as it kneeled in front of him.As a controlled monster, it was now completely subservient to him, answering his every beck and call!Hence, he was free to command it as he pleased.Nie Yan tilted his head upward and peered at the opening of the pitfall. I should be able to escape from here now.He stepped onto the palm of Dark Gladiator\u2019s bony claws and ordered it to raise him higher. As he was elevated to a suitable height, he leaped out of its claws and returned to the surface. Dark Gladiator followed soon after and leaped out of the pitfall as well, the weight of its skeletal frame shaking the ground upon landing.With this super meat-shield at his side, he would no longer have to fear those common skeletons.Nie Yan would be under Dark Gladiator\u2019s protection for roughly three hours, so he would definitely make use of the time by retrieving Sulgata\u2019s Shadow.Having escaped the underground dungeon, Nie Yan strode forward and headed for Sulgata\u2019s center. Following behind was the enormous Dark Gladiator who dwarfed him and the surrounding ruins in size.As soon as Nie Yan arrived in a new area, waves of skeletons would surge towards his position; however, like autumn leaves, they would be smashed apart by Dark Gladiator\u2019s sweeping tail. In such a way, his experience bar steadily rose while he advanced toward his destination.Every so often, after letting Dark Gladiator clean up most of the skeletons, he would find a suitable time to cast Undead Rite on the remaining Skeleton Mages. Hence, in this fashion, he soon formed a party of six consisting of Dark Gladiator, four Skeleton Mages, and him. Two of the Skeleton Mages specialized in ice magic, one in fire, and the other in lightning. All four guarded his side.As he travelled through the intricate paths of the outer district, he thought back to the fragmented memories of the time he spent levelling here and seeking out the entrance to the inner district.Levelling here is pretty fast. Nie Yan glanced at his experience bar. In the span of a few dozen minutes, it had already risen by eight percent. In the wake of his monstrous clearing speed, the surrounding undead in the vicinity couldn\u2019t respawn fast enough.Just as he finished clearing the mobs in an area, he heard sounds of activity at his back. Nie Yan furrowed his brows since it didn\u2019t resemble the sounds made by the undead. Voices? There are players here?...\u201cLevelling here is pretty good but there\u2019s just too many skeletons. We almost lost our lives there. How about we go back and call another Priest over? Two isn\u2019t enough. We\u2019ll need three if we want to continue training here.\u201d\u201cHaving too many Priests is inconvenient. How about we call a Holy Mage? They deal double damage to undead, so our mobbing speed will increase.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. Let\u2019s go back and recruit a Holy Mage.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a Leader-class Skeleton Mage near the end of this path. We\u2019ll need to circle around it first?\u201dThe voices of several players coming from behind startled Nie Yan. Just as he spun around, he happened to see eight players facing him in the distance after they turned the corner at the end of the path.In the same instant, the voices of the chattering players immediately came to a halt.\u201cHuh? Why did you guys stop talking? Did you all go stupid?\u201d an Arcane Mage among them asked in a puzzled tone. He then followed his companions\u2019 gazes, he immediately lost his voice as well.There, at the end of the path, stood a player dressed in a Thief\u2019s attire. They could tell with a single glance that his gear, especially the pair of daggers in his hands, was completely out of the ordinary. Why did this Thief suddenly appear out of nowhere? What was even more shocking, however, was the enormous bone dragon standing at this player\u2019s side. As they stared at its dark metallic red bones, towering body, immense spiked tail, and razor sharp claws, they could instantly tell it was a tier higher than the common undead roaming around this area.Besides the skeletal dragon, four Skeleton Mages guarded the Thief as they loosely gathered by his side. The flickering flames in their eye sockets stared back at the group of player that had just recently emerged.The existence of the enormous bone dragon alone made this Thief seem all the more mysterious.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Is he a Necromancer?\u201d\u201cNo, he appears to be a Thief!\u201dNie Yan stood silently with the Dark Gladiator, just looking at them, but also giving them a formless feeling of oppression. This was because he was manipulating the strings of their fates at this moment. If he commanded that enormous skeletal dragon to charge over and added the attacks from the four skeletal mages as well, those assembled would have no hope of survival at all.The gloomy, cyan flames in the Dark Gladiator\u2019s eyes flared. It was waiting for Nie Yan\u2019s command. It would immediately make a move if he gave the word to attack.Nie Yan used Transcendent Insight to view the information of these players.Leader Young Seven, Forgotten, Yi Yan... all sorts of familiar names floated into view. Level six, six, and five. These people were influential personages in their past lives. Although they hadn\u2019t joined any other guilds, they\u2019d formed a team called True Dragon Mark. The strength of this team was roughly on par with the elite teams of the guilds.It was then that Nie Yan recalled that he\u2019d met these players when he was tracking the Serpentine Lizard.This made sense when he thought about it. Players who dared come to Sulgata Ancient City at this level naturally wouldn\u2019t be bumbling fools.Leader Young Seven was a player who would be known as one of the Seven Archbishops in the future. A strong Priest was of utmost importance to a team. They would even have the effect of saving the entire team at critical moments.As for Forgotten, he\u2019d been superior to Nie Yan in his past life and was also one of the Thieves who received the moniker of Shadow Dancer. While he had been on roughly the same level as Nie Yan in terms of techniques, he had entered the game earlier and had an elite team. His level and equipment were both superior to Nie Yan. However, circumstances were different now. Nie Yan had more than ten years of experience as a Thief over Forgotten, and in this timeline, they both entered the game at the same time. So their positions would be sure to be rewritten in this life.Perhaps one day, they would be the ones to learn to look up to Nie Yan.As for the others, they weren\u2019t as renowned as Leader Young Seven or Forgotten, but they had a small bit of fame as well. Yi Yan for instance, was not a bad Fighter. Although he wasn\u2019t ranked in the top ten of the Fighter rankings, he was at least in the top 50. This was still quite a high ranking. After all, the entire Righteous faction would have hundreds of thousands of teams ten years from now.Read m0re at nO\u03bdE\u2113n(E)X\u0442Although Nie Yan had heard of these people before, he\u2019d never come in contact with them.They stared at each other for a while, with the hand that Leader Young Seven was using to grip his staff breaking out in a cold sweat. He didn\u2019t display his internal nervousness on his face however. If Nie Yan made a move, the six of them would most likely not make it out alive. They\u2019d naturally be gifting Nie Yan several pieces of equipment.If Nie Yan made a move, it would be a single sided slaughter.However, Nie Yan had his own thoughts about this matter. These people weren\u2019t weak, and although their current levels were low, they would be sure to be elite experts in the future. If Nie Yan gave the order for the Dark Gladiator to charge and kill them, he\u2019d at most get his hands on a few pieces of equipment and a red name. Those pieces of equipment weren\u2019t worth much money at all, and he wasn\u2019t short on money. Why make so many enemies? They didn\u2019t know what he had come to Sulgata for, and he didn\u2019t need to worry about someone seizing Sulgata\u2019s Shadow at this current level.Nie Yan smiled faintly and paid no more attention to these players, heading towards the depths of the city.The Dark Gladiator looked at Nie Yan\u2019s back, swiveled its head to look at the players, and then turned to follow him.Several skeletons came pouncing towards Nie Yan. The Dark Gladiator lifted its tail high and sent it crashing down heavily, smashing the skeletons into fragments.No one dared to follow. Whoever followed Nie Yan was courting death.Nie Yan walked away quite dashingly. They\u2019d only had one glance at his face, but it was something that Young Seven and the others would never forget.\u201cWait!\u201d Forgotten called out towards Nie Yan.Nie Yan didn\u2019t turn back as he left straight ahead, vanishing at the end of the path.Countless numbers of skeletons poured in, blocking their line of vision and making it so that even the tall Dark Gladiator disappeared from sight as well.\u201cJust who was that fellow? He was damn awesome, and he really had summoned those skeletons!\u201d Yi Yan mumbled off on the side. This was too frightening if this was the case.\u201cPerhaps they weren\u2019t summoned creatures. Didn\u2019t we get a Spirit Summoning Scroll drop too? He might\u2019ve gotten something else.\u201d Young Seven spoke, deep in thought. \u201cEven if this is the case, he\u2019s got some skills to dare come to Sulgata alone.\u201d\u201cOh right, Forgotten, what did you call out to him for just now?\u201d Yi Yan asked, perplexed.\u201cSince he turned to leave, that proved that he wouldn\u2019t do anything to us. It\u2019s a good idea to interact more with someone like that.\u201d\u201cOther people may not be willing to join our team.\u201d Young Seven said. Otherwise, Nie Yan wouldn\u2019t have turned without another word. It was obvious that he didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with them.\u201cThat\u2019s fine too. We\u2019ll become familiar with each other after some chatting. I used Inspect just now, that guy\u2019s called Nie Yan.\u201d Forgotten didn\u2019t know what he was feeling now either. As a fellow Thief, there seemed to be a great gap between him and Nie Yan.\u201cNie Yan? I seemed to have heard this name before. One of my friends said once that someone called Nie Yan slaughtered a lot of people in Radiant Sacred Flame. It looks like he\u2019s the one. I\u2019ve also heard that he has some relation to Sleepy Fox.\u201d Leader Young Seven said. He had friends in all sorts of places, and his sources of news were more timely. He often gossiped when chatting about news, like which guild had gotten a face full of dust from someone, which guilds had fought each other, etc.\u201cIs he someone from Holy Empire?\u201d\u201cNo idea, I didn\u2019t see him wear a guild emblem just now. I don\u2019t think so.\u201dNie Yan had left them with a deep impression with just one glance. A lone Thief had dared to charge into Sulgata\u2014this was why they felt deep respect for him. If they stumbled upon a chance to create good relations with Nie Yan or recruit him into their team, they would definitely jump on it.Nie Yan moved towards the center of the city following along the passages within the maze-like outer district. He didn\u2019t know about the intentions and plans of those behind him. If he knew that they wanted to recruit him for their team, he would\u2019ve told them to give up. Nie Yan wouldn\u2019t listen to anyone else\u2019s commands. He\u2019d joined the elites of Holy Empire only to get his hands on some equipment. He did want to form a team, but the reigns of command had to be in his hands.The Dark Gladiator rushed forward fiercely, slamming groups of monsters to death. Under this freakish speed of mob killing, Nie Yan\u2019s experience bar filled up rapidly.He made his way through a patch of maze and entered an open square. It measured several thousand meters in radius and the tall, rugged pyramid structure was in the center.Scores of tall and stocky Skeleton Executioners were patrolling around the center of the square. They were at least five meters tall, and were moving skeletons. Their right arms were noticeably thicker as they carried heavy axes.

Although he had visited Sulgata in the original timeline, these Skeleton Executioners had long been exterminated. Presumably, they were placed there for the sole purpose of guarding and preventing intruders from stealing the piece of Sulgata\u2019s Shadow. Even though he knew a group of players had retrieved the piece from this city in the past, he wasn\u2019t aware of the price they had to pay to do so.He could imagine the bitter struggles those players must have gone through as he observed the Skeleton Executioners roaming this area.Read m0re at nO\u03bdE\u2113n(E)X\u0442\u201cI didn\u2019t expect there to be so many Sub-Elites...\u201d Nie Yan muttered under his breath as his brows furrowed. However, thinking it over, it made sense that a Legendary-grade item such as Sulgata\u2019s Shadow would have the protection of many strong monsters, even if just a single piece.He calmly observed the area\u2019s topography to determine if it was possible to make a detour. Unfortunately, the area was too open, meaning he would be spotted as soon as he showed himself. As for any cover he could make use of, he spotted a lone pillar standing in the distance\u2014something far from being adequate.Another possible method was to have Dark Gladiator lead the Skeleton Executioners away, giving him an opportunity to sneak in; however, he felt uneasy facing the hidden dangers that might lurk within the pyramid with no help accompanying him. Sacrificing Dark Gladiator simply wasn\u2019t worth the risk.He retreated for now and pondered over the matter while farming the weaker undead mobs in the vicinity.Is it possible to turn the Skeleton Executioners into servants?Nie Yan ordered Dark Gladiator to retreat inside the outer district and remain on standby. He jumped onto the outer district\u2019s border walls and retrieved the Crossbow of Blood from his inventory, then aligned the sight on the Skeleton Executioners.\u201cFifty-two meters, too far... Fifty meters, still too far...\u201d Just as he was about to leave to find a more suitable position, a lone Skeleton Executioner started moving towards him, drawing progressively close.Perfect! Nie Yan pulled the trigger.\u300cWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u300dThree bolts pierced the air and successively struck their target.The cyan flames in the Skeleton Executioner\u2019s eye sockets flickered as it tilted its head and locked its gaze onto the aggressor positioned atop the wall. It immediately brandished its gigantic axe and charged at Nie Yan.The Skeleton Executioner emitted an odd roar that resembled the grinding of a bulldozer, swinging its axe wildly as it lumbered over.The commotion also caused the nearby thirty-plus Skeleton Executioners to come forward.Seeing the Skeleton Executioner about to smash the wall with its gigantic axe, Nie Yan jumped off the wall and withdrew at the last possible moment.\u300cBoom!\u300dThe large axe struck the eroded wall, breaking it as if it were rotten wood and bringing down large chunks of stone.\u300cBoom! Boom! Boom!\u300dSeveral dozen thunderous strikes followed the first, and the walls rapidly collapsed, allowing the Skeleton Executioners to enter the outer district.Nie Yan ran backwards, his eyes remaining fixed on the crumbling wall as he avoided the flying debris. He found a suitable opening and cast Undead Rite, which took away thirty percent of his health in an instant.A wisp of light struck a Skeleton Executioner and entered its body.Its movements momentarily froze; however, in the next moment, the Skeleton Executioner broke free of the spell\u2019s bindings and charged towards Nie Yan with its axe raised.\u201cDammit, it failed...\u201d He promptly rolled out of the way, dodging the oncoming axe. He then dashed toward a nearby wall, scaled over it, and hopped off on the other side. In this fashion, he traversed through the labyrinth-like outer district with the Skeleton Executioners in tow.After destroying several walls without finding Nie Yan, the Skeleton Executioners finally gave up and returned to the pyramid.There were just too many of them, which made it quite difficult to find a suitable opportunity to cast Undead Rite. Not to mention the low success rate, even if he succeeded by some lucky fluke, his new servant would be hacked to pieces by the other Skeleton Executioners almost immediately. Although there\u2019d be one less to deal with, he could only imagine how tedious and inefficient it would be to use this method to enter the pyramid. At the very minimum, it would take him two to three days to clear the area of Skeleton Executioners.Retrieving that piece of Sulgata\u2019s Shadow is going to be more problematic than I initially thought...In the end, Nie Yan had no choice but to helplessly linger around the outer district, allowing Dark Gladiator to clean up the surrounding mobs. Fortunately, the levelling speed was quite fast, which could count as a small consolation.Before three hours were fully up, Nie Yan had cast Undead Rite three more times but made zero headway in recruiting a Skeleton Executioner. In a mere half hour or so, Dark Gladiator would disappear.Don\u2019t tell me... I have to just forget about it and try again later? However, if he decided to give up today, he might not be as lucky next time in finding an amazing servant like Dark Gladiator again. In addition, there was no guarantee another player wouldn\u2019t snatch the piece of Sulgata\u2019s Shadow before he returned.Just as he was racking his brain over this problem, he heard the voices of nearby players enter his ear.\u201cIt\u2019s these guys again...\u201d Nie Yan wrinkled his brows. Since the last time he met them, those players had finally explored their way here. With the presence of outsiders, he wouldn\u2019t be able to execute his plans without a hitch. Before he retrieved the piece of Sulgata\u2019s Shadow, he didn\u2019t want to allow any others to become aware of its existence. However, he realized that even if they arrived here, once they saw how many Skeleton Executioners there were in the vicinity, they wouldn\u2019t even dare to take half a step forward, let alone have any thoughts of entering the pyramid.Unless they were all over Level 10 and brought a much larger group of players along with them, it would be impossible to clear the opening of all the Skeleton Executioners. Nie Yan still had ample time to retrieve Sulgata\u2019s Shadow.In the same moment, six players entered Nie Yan\u2019s view.The players were greeted by the sight of an enormous skeleton dragon standing by Nie Yan\u2019s side like a dutiful guardian; the ghostly flames in its eye sockets seemed to follow their every move. Meanwhile, beside the Thief also stood three Skeleton Mages with their staffs brandished, ready to attack at any time, not letting their guards down in the slightest.While within the safety of a city or a town, players maintained amiable attitudes and often befriended others. As soon as they stepped into the wilderness, however, their demeanors would completely reverse. Any stranger could become a potential enemy since everyone feared being plotted against or being ambushed by other players. Often times, even simple misunderstandings could lead to an endless bloodbath.So even though Nie Yan had Dark Gladiator at his side, if those six players simultaneously attacked him, he\u2019d still end up dying in a short amount of time. Thus, he had no choice but to keep his guard up against them at all times.Leader Young Seven, Forgotten, and the others also noticed Nie Yan\u2019s presence at the same time and halted.\u201cGreetings, we mean no harm!\u201d Forgotten was the first one to speak up. Their group of six were also extremely cautious. After all, their life and death lay in how Nie Yan viewed them.\u201cWhether your intentions are bad or not makes no difference to me,\u201d Nie Yan indifferently replied, taking the initiative to establish which side held dominance.Young Seven and the others glanced at Dark Gladiator that stood by Nie Yan\u2019s side. In truth, his statement was absolutely correct. With such a terrifying servant under his command, it really didn\u2019t matter if they had come to provoke him or not.\u201cWe came here simply because we wanted to befriend you. Besides, I believe there haven\u2019t been any cases where we\u2019ve offended you in the past,\u201d Young Seven answered as he calmly took a step forward and gazed at Nie Yan.Although they appeared to be at a complete disadvantage, Young Seven\u2019s bearing was neither servile nor overbearing.Pretty courageous... He was certainly worthy of being called one of the most outstanding players in his original timeline. Seemingly disregarding life and death, he staked his life in order to move one step closer toward Nie Yan.Nie Yan had a change of heart. Since he hadn\u2019t found a way of entering the pyramid on his own, Young Seven and his team might be able to help.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84 - Aggroing MonstersPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 84 - Aggroing MonstersAs Young Seven observed Nie Yan\u2019s taciturn appearance, a certain thought drifted through his mind. Why did he enter Sulgata all by himself? There must\u2019ve been a reason... Maybe a quest of some sort?\u201cI assume you came here for a reason. Do you need any help?\u201d Young Seven took the initiative to ask.\u201cEven with these undead servants, I\u2019m still not confident I\u2019ll be able to succeed. Are you certain you want to help?\u201d Nie Yan stared at Young Seven and the others as he narrowed his eyes.Upon hearing Nie Yan\u2019s rather straightforward response, Young Seven and his squadmates felt their minds turn to mush. If he couldn\u2019t accomplish his task even with that giant bone dragon by his side, then what use would they be?\u201cEncountering each other here could be considered fate. At the very least, we\u2019re not enemies, so if we can provide any assistance, we\u2019ll do our best to provide it. Even if we can\u2019t, we\u2019ll have at least made another friend, right?\u201d Young Seven replied in an affable manner.Nie Yan slightly relaxed his mind. In his previous life, he never interacted with Young Seven, Forgotten, or anyone else in their group, so he wasn\u2019t sure of their personalities. Right now, however, they seemed to be pretty easy to get along with. Perhaps they really could become friends.He went on to ponder in silence. The Skeletal Executioners always seemed to move together. If Young Seven and his team could draw them away, then perhaps he\u2019d have a shot at entering the pyramid. There would certainly be monsters guarding the interior, but he could just let Dark Gladiator deal with them. If things went smoothly, he might actually reach the room where the piece of Sulgata\u2019s Shadow was located.While Nie Yan continued to ponder deeply, Young Seven, Forgotten, and the rest of the team shot meaningful glances at each other. Although they didn\u2019t know exactly what he was thinking about, he was still a dangerous figure that could annihilate their entire team. If Nie Yan still declined their offer to help, they would have no other choice but to stay as far away as possible.\u201cIf we can\u2019t help, then let\u2019s just leave,\u201d suggested Forgotten.Young Seven suddenly came to realization upon hearing Forgotten\u2019s suggestion. Since Nie Yan definitely came here with a purpose, perhaps for a secret quest of some sort, their presence here might actually be a hindrance to him! If that was the case, wouldn\u2019t they be worsening their relationship with him instead by attempting to help?Even now, Nie Yan still hadn\u2019t given a reply.It\u2019s best if we just take our leave then, Young Seven concluded. He turned to Forgotten and replied, \u201cSince we won\u2019t be able to help, let\u2019s forget it. It\u2019s about time we return to town anyway.\u201d His voice just happened to be within earshot of Nie Yan. Their conversation dispelled any misgivings he might\u2019ve previously held and informed him they were willing to leave.\u201cIt\u2019s not that you won\u2019t be able to help. But first, how about we make a little deal?\u201d Nie Yan suddenly interrupted.\u201cWhat kind of deal?\u201d Young Seven asked.\u201cI need you to help me with a certain task. It\u2019s quite dangerous, but if you succeed, I\u2019ll give you a Gold-grade piece of equipment.\u201d Nie Yan still had the shoulder guards in his bag. Although it was a Gold-grade item with decent properties, it was negligible when compared to Sulgata\u2019s Shadow.If Young Seven and the others were truly willing to help him, he wouldn\u2019t be miserly when it came to rewards.In the game\u2019s current stage, Gold-grade equipment was fairly rare.Young Seven, Forgotten, and the rest of the team privately conversed amongst themselves. To illustrate just how rare Gold-grade equipment was, their team had only managed to acquire two Gold-grade pieces of equipment since the game started. Not to mention, they had to go through hell and back each time just to retrieve them. Yet Nie Yan, a player unassociated with any guilds, was actually willing to give one out so easily. This meant his skill was clearly on another level. Young Seven made a firm resolve in his mind. They definitely had to befriend him!\u201cBrother, since you\u2019ve asked this of us, we can only try our best. As for compensating us, you don\u2019t have to bother,\u201d Young Seven replied in a bright tone. A measly Gold-grade item was nothing as long as they could establish a good relationship with Nie Yan. If they helped him without accepting a reward, then he would owe them a favour.\u201cAccepting help without giving anything in return? That won\u2019t do. So long as you help me here, I promise to pay back the favour in the future.\u201d\u201cSounds good. So, what do you need us to do?\u201dYoung Seven asked.\u201cWell, how about we introduce ourselves first. My name is Nie Yan (Nirvana Flame).\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Leader Young Seven, but you can just call me Young Seven.\u201d\u201cAs for me, I\u2019m Forgotten.\u201dAnd thus, the rest of Young Seven\u2019s team introduced themselves. Although their skills couldn\u2019t be compared to Nie Yan\u2019s, they were still all talented individuals who weren\u2019t half-bad.\u201cWe don\u2019t have much time, so just follow me for now,\u201d Nie Yan said as he headed deeper into the outer district.Young Seven and the rest followed close behind.The numerous Skeleton Executioners had wreaked havoc upon the outer district. The already eroded buildings had become even more ruined, and many of the walls were collapsed.After Nie Yan and the others arrived at the limits of the outer district, they hid behind a collapsed wall and gazed over at the plaza which led to the pyramid. There they saw over thirty Skeleton Executioners roaming around freely, each one a Level 13 Sub-Elite monster.He can\u2019t possibly be thinking of having us fight these monsters, right...!? Young Seven and his team couldn\u2019t help but have this thought as they felt their scalps turning numb. However, they didn\u2019t voice out their concerns. They didn\u2019t want to look weak in front of Nie Yan. Killing a single Skeleton Executioner wouldn\u2019t be a problem for their team, but taking on a group this large was surely impossible.\u201cLet me explain the plan. There are thirty-three Skeleton Executioners total. They all move in one group, so if you attack one of them, the others will follow. What I want you guys to do is to lure them away,\u201d Nie Yan explained. If Young Seven and his team could lead these Skeleton Executioners away, then he would be able to pass through the plaza and safely enter the pyramid.Read m0re at nO\u03bdE\u2113n(E)X\u0442\u201cYou only want us to lead them away, right?\u201d Young Seven asked, mentally sighing a breath of relief. Thankfully that was all he was asking of them. Although the task was still dangerous, it was nothing compared to actually fighting them.\u201cYeah, I only need you to draw them away. It doesn\u2019t have to be for long either. Around thirty seconds will be enough,\u201d Nie Yan replied. Half a minute was more than sufficient for him to pass through the plaza and reach the pyramid.\u201cAlright, that makes things a bit easier.\u201d\u201cI want you guys aggro them from here. Let me move to another location first. When I\u2019m ready, I\u2019ll give you guys the signal. Dissolve your party and accept my invite,\u201d Nie Yan instructed. With other players helping him, entering the pyramid was going to be much easier.\u201cAlright.\u201dOnce Young Seven disbanded his party, Nie Yan promptly invited everyone into his own.\u201cPerfect, I\u2019ll be leaving it up to you then,\u201d Nie Yan said, his tone sounding not nearly as cold as before.\u201cRest assured,\u201d Young Seven nodded his head and replied. Nie Yan was quite polite. It seemed this was going to be the start of a beautiful friendship.Nie Yan brought Dark Gladiator and the Skeleton Mages with him to another position.His figure gradually became smaller in the distance.\u201cI just took a look. That bone dragon by Nie Yan\u2019s side is a genuine Sub-Elite monster!\u201d Forgotten exclaimed in shock. \u201cWhat a godly player. Even a Sub-Elite undead isn\u2019t out of his reach. I wonder how long it lasts. Maybe it\u2019s permanent!\u201d\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be permanent. I was able to see more information when I used Inspect. That thing only has twenty minutes left before it disappears,\u201d Young Seven replied. Still... even if that was the case, Nie Yan was still pretty incredible.\u201cNo wonder he seemed to be in a rush. Hey, what do you think he wants to enter the pyramid for?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s probably a hidden quest.\u201d\u201cComing here to do a quest at this level, does he not care about dying?\u201d\u201cWho knows?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s in position. I\u2019ll go out and draw aggro,\u201d Forgotten said after glancing at the team chat.\u201cYou be careful now, we\u2019re dealing with thirty-plus Sub-Elites after all,\u201d Young Seven warned Forgotten.\u201cUnderstood. Heh, I can handle myself. You don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d Forgotten sheathed his dagger and took out a small crossbow, then walked closer to the square.Young Seven and his team were positioned to the northeast of the square, while Nie Yan was positioned to the northwest. Coincidently, Nie Yan was able to see their situation from his position, so after he sent a message through the team chat, he saw Forgotten stepping out from behind a rock pile and slowly approach the Skeleton Executioners while crouching,crossbow in hand.By the time Forgotten found an adequate position, the closest Skeleton Executioner was already within the range of his crossbow. He aimed at the Skeleton Executioner and fired.\u300cWhoosh!\u300d A single bolt pierced through the air.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 - Secret CompartmentPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 85 - Secret CompartmentThe crossbow bolt arced through the air and struck the nearest Skeleton Executioner directly in the chest. After being suddenly attacked, it let out a furious roar and charged toward Forgotten.The roar also alerted the surrounding Skeleton Executioners, who stampeded toward Forgotten in a large mob.\u201cCrap, they\u2019re all coming over!\u201dSeeing this, Forgotten immediately turned tail and leaped over the pile of rocks, fleeing for his life. After all, who would dare stay still when faced with such a terrifying sight.Yet this was only the beginning. They had been tasked with keeping these Skeleton Executioners distracted for at least half a minute, which meant their job was far from over.Nie Yan watched from the sidelines as the Skeleton Executioners stampeded toward the northeast. As their silhouettes grew distant, the plaza was soon emptied of their presence; thus, Nie Yan brought Dark Gladiator and the rest of his undead toward the pyramid\u2019s entrance.\u300cBoom! Boom! Boom!\u300dThunderous noises reverberated from northeast of the plaza as the mob of Skeleton Executioners wreaked havoc upon the remaining ruins, causing the walls to topple over and collapse. In addition, volleys of magic could periodically be seen flying through the air, raining down upon the mob.The spells were coming from Young Seven and the others, who, for the sake of stalling for time, didn\u2019t hesitate to attack the group despite being well aware of the risks.It appeared these players were quite earnest in helping him out. If they truly did end up helping him retrieve the fragment of Sulgata\u2019s Shadow, then not only would he honour the favour he owed them, he would also gift them the Gold-grade shoulder guards regardless of their prior refusal. Even in games, if a person gave their word, then they should keep it. It was by far the simplest way to get along with others. And getting along with others was essential to establishing a large network of contacts. When one encountered a situation and required assistance, it became more convenient to find help.\u300c System: Player Round Stool has died. \u300dAs he glanced at the party window, Nie Yan saw the highlighted text of a player\u2019s name turn dark. This meant a member from Young Seven\u2019s group had been killed. Aggroing these Skeleton Executioners was a dangerous task; it came as no surprise that one or two players would end up dying.As the battle in the northeast raged on, Nie Yan became ever more concerned about how much longer they could hold out for. At this point, however, all he could do was hope for the best as he accelerated his pace towards the pyramid.Bringing the Skeleton Mages along would be much too cumbersome. Thus, before he and Dark Gladiator moved towards the pyramid, he ordered them to farm monsters in the surrounding area and left them to their own devices. He and Dark Gladiator dashed through the plaza and safely arrived at the pyramid\u2019s entrance.The entrance, which appeared to be two solid metal gates carved with ancient, intricate designs, wasn\u2019t all that large. Though, through the passing of the ages, their beauty had long since faded, giving way to rust and the dilapidation of time.\u300c I\u2019ve already entered the pyramid. Hurry up and leave, \u300dNie Yan said through the party\u2019s voice channel. However, just as those words exited his mouth, another player\u2019s name turned dark; a second member of Young Seven\u2019s team had been killed. For the sake of aiding him, they had made sacrifices that couldn\u2019t be considered negligible. Fortunately, they were able to retrieve the equipment that had dropped from those who died.\u300c Roger, we\u2019ll be taking our leave then, \u300dYoung Seven replied. If they stayed any longer, it would be hard to predict what else might happen, so after receiving Nie Yan\u2019s go-ahead, the remaining members immediately withdrew from the battle.\u300c Thanks for this, I\u2019ll give you the equipment when I get back. \u300d\u300c No problem, we\u2019ll be in the area farming mobs for a bit before returning to town. \u300dAfter entering the pyramid, Nie Yan walked through a dark, long and narrow passageway along a flight of stairs. Relying on his past knowledge, he carefully avoided all the hidden traps along the path.The hidden mechanisms in this passage were all extremely dangerous and would result in instant death for anyone unlucky enough to trigger them. Nie Yan was quite cautious as he advanced along the path, not daring to reveal the slightest degree of carelessness.Fortunately, no matter what manner of trap appeared, none of them were new to him since he had encountered every single one in his previous life. Therefore, as long as he wasn\u2019t careless, none of these traps would pose any threat to him.Advancing down the path, an eerie chill that made his blood run cold seemed to come from the depths of the pyramid.As Nie Yan reached the end of the passageway, he was met with a dead end. All that lay ahead was a large stagnant pool of water.The way leading to the interior of the pyramid was underneath this pool!Nie Yan dived into the water and swam towards the depths while Dark Gladiator followed from behind. As an undead, Dark Gladiator didn\u2019t need to breathe. Thus, it wouldn\u2019t matter how long it stayed submerged underwater.It was a sealed underwater passage. In every direction, left and right, above and below, were smooth stone walls while the path ahead was dark and foreboding. The path was so dark it was nearly impossible to make anything out.Nie Yan continued to swim ahead, though he wasn\u2019t rushing at all, so if by any chance he encountered a monster while underwater, he\u2019d have ample time to react.Just at that moment, Nie Yan suddenly felt something peculiar about the stone wall to his left, and his heart leapt out in alarm. There was a hidden mechanism inside the wall!He only had time to see two sharp, black arrowheads emerge from it.\u300cWhoosh! Whoosh!\u300dTwo arrows shot out, leaving a trail of bubbles behind them while flying directly at Nie Yan.He did an underwater roll and leaned his head to the side, and almost immediately after, an arrow streaked past his cheek and left side. Just by a hair\u2019s breadth, he had nearly been struck in the head and heart. Luckily though, he had a good reaction speed.The two arrows merely ended up embedded on the opposite wall.Read m0re at nO\u03bdE\u2113n(E)X\u0442After this close call, he became even more cautious and prudent.Proceeding further into the depths of the underwater passage, his eyes happened to glance over at a certain area on the wall to his right where he discovered peculiar scratch marks, other markings, and what appeared to be ancient characters above them.In the previous timeline, very few players, if any at all, who arrived here would be able to recognize these characters scribbled on the wall. Nie Yan, on the other hand, recognized these marks and characters. They were the secret totemic marking of the dragons, and as for the two eroded characters above...They were also the language of the dragons!Since Nie Yan had learned Dragon Tongue from the Annals of Shared Governance he was immediately able to recognize these characters.Legends told that before city perished, the Lord of Sulgata secretly hid all his treasures somewhere inside the city. Believing these legends to be true, in his previous life, players searched every nook and cranny of the city, yet no one was able to find even a hint of their whereabouts.The dragons believed in destruction, exercising their faith in flame and incineration which desired the eradication of everything in existence. It was certain the totemic marking on the wall possessed a unique origin!Upon feeling a sense of suffocation suddenly come from his chest, he realized that he seemed to be running out of breath, so in response, he activated the underwater breathing ability of the Water Aversion Pearl and began searching around the wall. However, excluding a few minute cracks, it was as smooth as a mirror, and he couldn\u2019t find any peculiarities whatsoever.Could I just be overthinking things?He was convinced the dragon totemic markings appearing in this location wasn\u2019t a simple matter.Paying heed to his conviction, he expanded the range of his search and reached his hands into a nook beneath the wall.There, his hands happened to pass over five cavities roughly the size of a fingerprint. These five cavities were so faint that they were extremely easy to miss if one passed over them carelessly.Perhaps, a secret lay in these five cavities.He placed the fingers on his right hand over the cavities, and as he slowly exerted pressure over them, they began sinking inward.\u300cRumble! Rumble!\u300d A slab of stone an arm\u2019s length away from him slowly protruded outward.There was a secret compartment inside this wall! The activating mechanism to this compartment was extremely well hidden. Unless someone searched for a lengthy period of time, they would have no hopes of discovering it.Although he didn\u2019t know if any players discovered the totemic markings in his previous life, he definitely never heard of anyone finding this hidden compartment.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86 - GemPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 86 - GemIn the moment the slab fell out and the secret compartment was revealed, a rainbow-coloured radiance blossomed out and illuminated the dark, underwater passage. Nie Yan swam over and looked inside, but was blinded by the intense brilliance. However, as his eyes slowly adapted, he saw a mess of items loosely scattered around the interior. It appeared much of the compartment\u2019s contents had already been removed, presumably by NPCs. Nonetheless, quite a few items remained behind, all of which were precious gems of various quality and type.Nie Yan collected all of the gems and sorted through them. Five were Fortune Gems (1), and the rest were even more precious Resilient Gems (1) and Life Gems (1), which there were two and three of respectively. Although one was the lowest quality rating for a gem, they were still fairly uncommon in the game\u2019s current stage. A single Fortune Gem (1) could go for roughly five silvers. As for the two other gems, the Resilient and Life ones, it was a bit difficult to determine their prices since they had yet to appear on the marketplace. However, once a Jewelcrafter socketed these gems into equipment, their corresponding properties would increase significantly.Equipment didn\u2019t generally come with sockets, so players were required to pay a two silver commission fee to a Jewelcrafter to create one. Gold equipment could possess up to two sockets, Dark Gold up to three, and Legendary up to five. Once the sockets were created, for three additional silvers, the player could then have the Jewelcrafter socket a gem, and once they were socketed into a piece of equipment, Resilient Gems (1) would increase Resilience by five and Life Gems (1) would increase health by fifty.Due to their effects, practically all the major guilds fought over these gems. However, since their production rate was extremely low, they were almost never listed for sale and thus didn\u2019t have a set market value. In addition, due to their rarity, it would be a waste to socket them into anything lower than Dark Gold-grade. In some circumstances, though, it was acceptable to socket rare Gold-grade items such as shields, rings, necklaces, and so on.I\u2019ve struck it rich this time! Nie Yan inwardly exclaimed. Today\u2019s harvests were fairly abundant. So no matter what happened next, the trip had at least paid for itself. If he were to list these gems up on the auction house, it would cause hordes of players to scramble and fight over them. Naturally, he had no plans of selling since, with so many gems, he could raise the overall quality of his gear significantly! Even if he did sell any of them, he would do so only if any remained after he had finished using them for himself and only to friends and acquaintances.Nie Yan felt endless elation when he thought about these gems.He threw these gems into a small sack and continued searching the compartment to confirm he hadn\u2019t overlooked anything. Only then did he leave the secret compartment and proceeded deeper into the passage, resuming his original objective.Nie Yan paid closer attention to the surrounding walls, but it led to no further discoveries.A dozen or so minutes later, as he swam along the narrow passageway, he saw a sliver of light shining from above. Following it, he swam and eventually reached the water\u2019s surface, whereupon he was greeted by the sight of an enormous room that could seemingly fit several hundred people. At the very center was a golden sarcophagus. It was five meters long, two meters wide, and two meters tall, and its surface was covered in delicate carvings, most of which were depictions of various dragons.Besides the sarcophagus, the room was void of anything else.It doesn\u2019t seem like there are any monsters here. Nie Yan leapt out of the water and onto dry ground, then walked toward the giant sarcophagus. Right behind him, Dark Gladiator burst out of the water and positioned itself in a location not far from him.Sulgata\u2019s Shadow was a legendary Thief item and possessed much history behind it. Reportedly, the Lord of Sulgata, Seres Thoth, wore this piece of equipment during his reign in the Dark Era. However, when the conflict broke out, the item was shattered into three fragments. Now, it merely awaited the day when it would be restored. When all three fragments were retrieved, the powerful magical item would then finally make its reappearance in the world.Each individual fragment was useless on its own. Thus, he could only wait until he possessed all three fragments for the item to have any effects. More importantly, however, was the fact that Nie Yan knew the location of the two other fragments. The second fragment was located in a Level 30 area, and the third was located in a Level 60 one. Although Level 30 and Level 60 seemed far away, he at least had definite goals for the future.Legendary-grade equipment were items countless players coveted but were unable to obtain. Since there was an opportunity to obtain one, there was no chance Nie Yan could possibly let it pass by. He\u2019d seize this fragment first and then wait until his level rose appropriately before seeking out the other two. Although it wouldn\u2019t provide any immediate benefits, he was laying a path for the future that would pay off in the long-term.Read m0re at nO\u03bdE\u2113n(E)X\u0442As he drew closer, he discovered lines of characters carved on the stone above the sarcophagus. Like the totemic carvings he saw before, the characters here were also written in Dragon Tongue.\u300c TOMB OF LORD SERES THOTH \u300d\u300c WHOEVER DISTURBS HIS REST WILL BE CURSED! \u300dThe item Nie Yan had been searching for was located inside this sarcophagus, so it was, of course, necessary for him to open it!The fragment of Sulgata\u2019s Shadow was within his reach!However, the very same moment, Dark Gladiator suddenly walked over and stood by Nie Yan\u2019s side. The pale cyan flames in its eye sockets flickered even more intensely as it stared at the golden sarcophagus. Although it was a lower life form without intelligence nor a sense of fear, its instincts had driven it to protect him.In response, Nie Yan glanced at Dark Gladiator\u2019s information window. It seemed it had been inflicted with a status effect when they entered this tomb.Dark Oppression: All stats are reduced by 20%.Dark Gladiator\u2019s stats had actually been reduced by a full twenty percent.As Nie Yan began to wonder what sort of terrifying entity lurked inside this sarcophagus, traces of hesitation arose in his heart. If he was unable to retrieve the fragment of Sulgata\u2019s Shadow and died instead, it would be a situation where he tried to steal a chicken and ended up losing the rice used to lure it.Regarding the pyramid, all of the information he possessed came from hearsay, so he wasn\u2019t knowledgeable of the finer details, and he was even more clueless when it came to the golden sarcophagus before him.Will I be able to use a Return Scroll inside this tomb?Nie Yan took out a Return Scroll and tested it to see. He was able to activate it without a problem! After confirming that he could still use the scroll to escape, the tension he felt abated significantly. In the worst case scenario, he\u2019d grab the item and use the Return Scroll to escape. Besides, no matter how useless Dark Gladiator became, at the very least, it could still act as a meat shield for a brief period of time.Risk and reward were two sides of the same coin. If he didn\u2019t take any risks, how would he be able to reap any rewards?Nie Yan resolved himself and walked up to the sarcophagus. Feeling around it, he found a small metal button protruding to the side. This was the activating mechanism for opening the sarcophagus! He reluctantly pushed the button and swiftly retreated behind Dark Gladiator. If anything dangerous emerged, he could only rely on Dark Gladiator to shield him.The interior mechanisms of the sarcophagus slowly turned, emitting a sound that could cause a person to quake in fear. The lid slowly began moving away, and the friction of metal grinding against metal produced a sharp sound resembling nails on a chalkboard.After the sarcophagus completely opened, a mummified corpse wearing a set of heavy armour appeared before Nie Yan\u2019s eyes. It had completely rotted away; all that remained was skin and bones. The corpse wore a golden crown on its head. Its arms were folded flat across its stomach where both palms grasped a golden longsword pointed upwards. It was clear that, at the time of burial, the person died with a solemn and dignified expression.Crusadium, Blacklight Crystal... Nie Yan scanned his eyes over the materials of the armour as his heart rate progressively increased. These were all priceless items!Unfortunately, the equipment on this corpse weren\u2019t items he could use. They were all incredibly heavy, and in his current state, even if he exerted all of his strength, he would be unable to budge it by so much as an inch.At a first glance, when Nie Yan swept over the rest of the coffin and found a wooden case resting by the corpse\u2019s side, it seemed exceedingly ordinary. For it to be put in such a luxurious sarcophagus made it seem somewhat out of place. However, his expression brightened immediately upon laying eyes on it. This box was exactly what he came for.At this point, Nie Yan felt like his heart was going to leap out of his chest.Sulgata\u2019s Shadow: an item that would cause countless Thieves to drool over it, was quietly sitting right in front of him! It was right within reach and so readily available as well! This sort of situation would cause not only him but anyone to feel like they were on cloud nine!62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 - Sulgatas BootsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 87 - Sulgata\u2019s BootsNie Yan picked up the wooden case and carefully removed the lid. Almost immediately, like the rolling tides, swells of magical energy began diffusing into the expanse of the tomb. The source of such a phenomenon was a shimmering pair of fine boots situated quietly within the case.No mistake, this is it! Nie Yan inwardly exclaimed. He nearly choked from his own excitement when he was greeted by the dazzling radiance of these boots.In his previous life, Legendary-grade items were out of reach existences he could never hope to obtain. Although the item in his hands was merely a fragment, its price was high enough to make people faint. Even when he advanced into a Great Thief in the later years of the game, he had only been able to obtain a single fragment from a different Legendary-grade item. It was part of a breastplate only Fighters could equip, and for the sake of putting food on the table and supporting himself, he reluctantly sold it. With the money he obtained from selling the fragment, he was able to purchase a full set of Dark Gold equipment and enough Fortune Gems to upgrade said set to +9 while still having more than enough leftover to cover his living expenses.Given this example, one could well imagine how high a price an intact Legendary item could fetch.Sulgata\u2019s Shadow was divided into three fragments: Sulgata\u2019s Boots, Sulgata\u2019s Feather, and Sulgata\u2019s Cloth.He needed to collect them for the remnant magical energy to restore the boots to its original form.Sulgata\u2019s Boots (Legendary)Requirements: 130 StrengthDescription: A fragment of Sulgata\u2019s Shadow that has been broken into three pieces. These boots contain remnant magical power and so can still be equipped. The player must seek out the other fragments, as all three, Sulgata\u2019s Boots, Sulgata\u2019s Feather, and Sulgata\u2019s Runic Cloth, are required to restore Sulgata\u2019s Shadow.Properties: Dexterity +30, Speed +10, Jump +10, Stealth +10, Cloaking +10, Reflex +10.Steal (Rank 3): Allows the player to steal money or items from other players or monsters.Shadow Waltz (Rank 3): Stealth +30, Cloaking +30, Speed +30; cannot be detected through stealth for 6 s upon activation. Afterward, stealth has a chance of being seen through.Restrictions: NoneAs a fragment of a Legendary item, the properties of Sulgata\u2019s Boots were indeed astonishing. It raised Speed, Jump, Stealth, Cloaking, and Reflex uniformly. Moreover, it also bestowed upon the player two additional skills, Steal and Shadow Waltz, both of which were rank three. They were high-level skills that could only be learned once the player reached Level 30. Not to mention, if the player wanted to improve these skills to rank three, they needed to be at least Level 40 or higher.Steal enabled a Thief to reap additional profits from players or monsters. However, only items from a player\u2019s bag could be stolen, meaning Thieves were unable to steal gear directly equipped on a player\u2019s body. The success rate of the skill and what sort of item was stolen depended on the level gap between the Thief and the target; though, the formula for calculating the rate was complicated since many variables besides level were also factored in. Generally, successful uses of the skill stole money from the target, and in some rare circumstances, equipment and other items could be stolen as well. As for Shadow Waltz, it was quite useful for retreating or stealthily approaching a target since a multitude of things could be done within six seconds. Despite that, even if the player\u2019s stealth couldn\u2019t be seen through, it didn\u2019t mean they were invincible. All it meant was the opponent wouldn\u2019t be able to see them. In other words, after the first six seconds of the skill, the opponent had a chance of detecting the player every three-second interval, which counted as a round within the game. If the opponent failed to detect the player, they would continue every round until the player revealed themselves or their stealth was seen through.\u201cOne hundred thirty strength? Ah... Why does it have to be so high?\u201d Nie Yan wrinkled his brows. He was still seventy-three strength away from being able to use it. Such a high requisite was extremely harsh for him, especially since Thieves mainly focused on Dexterity while Strength was only secondary to them. If he put everything into Strength now, levelling in the future would become much more difficult. Fortunately, Sulgata\u2019s Boots somewhat made up for it by providing thirty Dexterity. \u201cGod dammit! Why did I have to end up losing ten Strength!?\u201dAssuming they worked hard, an average player would probably need to be Level 40 or higher to put sixty points in Strength. If their equipment was good, however, then it was possible to have one hundred and thirty Strength by around Level 30.Had Nie Yan not been cursed and permanently lost ten Strength, he would\u2019ve reached one hundred and thirty Strength by Level 25.Now I have to wait until Level 30 to equip this.I\u2019ll have to come up with a way to make up for this loss ... Earlier, when he had noticed Sulgata\u2019s Boots gave him rank three Steal, his eyes had lit up with anticipation. He knew better than anyone else what it meant to have Steal, let alone obtaining it at rank three, prior to Level 30.Getting one hundred thirty Strength before Level 30 wasn\u2019t impossible. In fact, after thinking over it some more, it was possible for him to reach it by Level 15!Of course, there was a time and place for everything, and now wasn\u2019t the time to be thinking about such things. The moment Nie Yan stuffed Sulgata\u2019s Boots into his bag, Dark Gladiator suddenly trembled, causing him to feel an emerging sense of crisis. It wasn\u2019t suitable to stay in this tomb any longer. He needed to flee, immediately!Read m0re at nO\u03bdE\u2113n(E)X\u0442Just as he planned to turn his head and flee, a terrifying scene played out before his eyes. The mummified corpse of Seres Tothe suddenly moved, and a pale cyan flame ignited in his eye sockets. Albeit an insignificant ember, it pulsated and gradually grew in intensity.Without a doubt, this was the signal for him to retreat, lest he planned to lose his life. This mummified son of a bitch wants to revive!Nie Yan didn\u2019t dare to dally and dashed toward the exit. However, to his dismay, the pond he had emerged out of became sealed as larger and larger boulders came crashing down!From the moment he opened the sarcophagus, his escape route had already been blocked.Nie Yan glanced at the Return Scroll in his bag. Good! I can still use it! He had already checked earlier, but this confirmed it. The tomb wasn\u2019t a sealed room; he could at least teleport out!In the next instant, the tall armoured corpse slowly rose from its sarcophagus.Shit, there\u2019s no time... The Return Scroll needs twenty seconds to activate!In spite of that, he quickly put aside these thoughts and began channeling the scroll. As the ancient script within the scroll glowed with ever increasing intensity, a faint radiance soon enveloped him and a bright teleportation circle appeared beneath his feet.The seconds seemed to stretch longer and longer.By now, Seres Tothe, or more accurately his corpse, had fully arisen. Wearing a full set of golden armour, it wielded an equally dazzling longsword in its hands and emanated the aura of a ruler.In life, he was a powerful lord who governed over Sulgata. After his death, he was buried in this tomb and eventually turned undead like the other inhabitants of the city.Seres Tothe (Lord): Level 15Health: 50,000/50,000A Lord-class monster possessed a terrifying amount of health. Nie Yan knew that if an elite team of Level 15 players came, they\u2019d stand no chance of defeating Seres Tothe. Discussing the possibility of him defeating this boss by himself was even less necessary. If he was even just a step too slow, he would subsequently lose his life.Three seconds... Four seconds... Five seconds... He impatiently counted down as time seemed to slow to a crawl.Nie Yan felt like he was going to explode from the nervousness building in his heart.In the next second, the pale cyan flames in Seres Tothe\u2019s eyes locked onto Nie Yan while he emanated a powerful aura of death, nearing ever closer with every step.At Nie Yan\u2019s level, Seres Tothe\u2019s damage was simply too monstrous. There would be little suspense if they fought. With a single slash of that sword, his body would be cleanly bisected while his health bar fell to zero. It was impossible for him to withstand a single attack. Even if he was a Fighter, the end result would be the same.Seres Tothe gradually drew closer, and the sense of crisis bore down on him even more intensely, yet he couldn\u2019t move a single step. Otherwise, the Return Scroll\u2019s channeling would be interrupted.\u201cCrap, just a little bit longer... Wait!\u201d Nie Yan turned his head and glanced at Dark Gladiator, who patiently awaited his command, and ordered it to hold off Seres Tothe.Without the slightest hesitation, Dark Gladiator lumbered over, brushed past his side, and then stood in front of him in order to obstruct Seres Tothe. Although it was a being with minimal intelligence, it still possessed an innate fear and reverence toward the existence that lay ahead. However, its loyalty and drive to protect Nie Yan was even more absolute. With the sliver of consciousness in its mind, Dark Gladiator understood it was heading toward its demise; however, regardless of all costs, it would protect its master to the bitter end.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88 - EscapePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 88 - EscapeBefore the imposing five-meter tall Seres Tothe, Dark Gladiator appeared to be naught but a feeble house gecko.The golden armoured lord, who resembled a titan that had resurrected from antiquity, emanated an incredibly oppressive aura.Things would get dangerous if Seres Tothe was allowed to get within striking range!Upon receiving Nie Yan\u2019s command, Dark Gladiator suddenly soared into the air and then, after reaching an optimal height, plummeted towards the earth in an attempt to dive-bomb its opponent.Seeing Dark Gladiator closing in on him, the pale cyan flames in Seres Tothe\u2019s eyes pulsated. He gazed over the frail skeleton dragon, his eyes showing utter disdain, and raised his arm up towards it. With a single flick of the wrist, he sent it crashing into the ground before it even had a chance to reach him.\u300cBOOM!\u300dDark Gladiator fell to the ground and tumbled along until finally colliding with one of the tomb walls. \u2212139Seres Tothe\u2019s damage output was truly terrifying. Even Dark Gladiator, who possessed a formidable defense, instantly lost over twenty percent of its health in a single strike.Regardless, Dark Gladiator still stumbled back to its feet and charged at Seres Tothe once more.If Dark Gladiator couldn\u2019t hold off the boss, then Nie Yan would have no hope of escaping.It was truly an unfortunate situation, as a servant like Dark Gladiator was hard to come by. However, in a life or death plight such as this, he didn\u2019t really have any other choice. Besides, there wasn\u2019t much time left on Undead Rite.Read m0re at nO\u03bdE\u2113n(E)X\u0442Once Dark Gladiator drew near, it pounced on Seres Tothe and latched onto his waist, firmly refusing to loosen its grasp. In response, however, Seres Tothe simply raised his golden longsword.\u300cSlash!\u300dA streak of light cleaved through Dark Gladiator\u2019s shoulder and cleanly lopped off its arm. Then, he followed with an elbow strike, which knocked aside the frail bone dragon like a ragdoll.Like most undead, Seres Tothe\u2019s actions were extremely clumsy and stiff. Because of this, Dark Gladiator was just barely able to avoid a fatal blow.However, the undead dragon was only hanging on by a thread. With merely twenty-one percent of its health left, it wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand another one of Seres Tothe\u2019s attacks.Now, with Dark Gladiator nearly out of commision, Nie Yan felt as though his heart would burst from anxiety. Although Dark Gladiator had slightly hindered Seres Tothe\u2019s movements, it still failed at holding him back.Twelve seconds... Fourteen seconds... Fifteen seconds...The plan had failed, Seres Tothe couldn\u2019t be stopped. Presently, the golden armoured lord was standing before him with his massive body ominously looming over Nie Yan. Seres Tothe\u2019s sword flickered with a sharp glint as he gradually raised it high above his head. Nie Yan knew only one thing was certain, he\u2019d die if he allowed that sword to hit him!Staring at the sword, Nie Yan couldn\u2019t help but imagine himself being chopped in half. He quickly glanced over at Dark Gladiator who was still struggling to get up. C\u2019mon! C\u2019mon! Hurry up!Dark Gladiator crawled back to its feet. Though it still appeared to be somewhat unsteady, it charged at Seres Tothe once again.\u300cBang!\u300dJust as Seres Tothe\u2019s sword was about to come down on Nie Yan and cleave him in half, Dark Gladiator rammed its skeletal frame into Seres Tothe and caused him to stumble. Seemingly infuriated that a lower being had caused him to stagger, Seres Tothe brandished his longsword and attacked in retaliation.A cold arc of light followed his sword as it slashed across Dark Gladiator\u2019s skeletal frame, splitting it in half. The bone dragon\u2019s halves collapsed to the ground and shattered.After turning Dark Gladiator into a pile of bone fragments, Seres Tothe turned its attention back to the other pest that he had been too preoccupied to deal with.Eighteen... Nineteen... Twenty!Luckily, by then, the Return Scroll had already finished channeling. A bright radiance shone from the teleportation circle beneath Nie Yan\u2019s feet as he disappeared from the tomb.The scenery in front of Nie Yan changed as he emerged from Calore\u2019s transfer point. Yet, despite his successful escape, his heart was still racing. I finally got away from that bastard. It\u2019s unfortunate I ended up losing Dark Gladiator in the process though...Ah, whatever. There was nothing else I could\u2019ve done. Even if I didn\u2019t sacrifice him, he would\u2019ve disappeared soon anyway.Nevertheless, he had still accomplished his objective, which of course was retrieving Sulgata\u2019s Boots. Now he just needed to figure out how he could equip them as quickly as possible.\u300c Where are you guys? \u300dNie Yan messaged Young Seven and his crew.\u300c We\u2019ve already returned to Calore. We\u2019re at the alchemy shop right now, \u300dYoung Seven replied. They had actually returned pretty early on to restock. Since there were simply too many mobs in Sulgata, they ended up burning through their supply of consumables fairly quickly.\u300c Alright, meet me at the auction house. \u300d\u300c No problem. See ya there. \u300d...After some time, Young Seven and his team arrived at the auction house and spotted Nie Yan waiting just outside.\u201cNice to see you,\u201d Nie Yan greeted and nodded his head in acknowledgement. If it weren\u2019t for their help back in Sulgata, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to to find those gems or retrieve Sulgata\u2019s Boots.\u201cLikewise,\u201d Young Seven replied, followed by Forgotten and the others who joined in.\u201cDid you complete your quest?\u201d Forgotten asked. He didn\u2019t bother to pry any further than that though, as the contents of Nie Yan\u2019s quest were his business and his alone.\u201cI completed it.\u201d Nie Yan nodded in reply. \u201cAccording to my original offer, I owe you all a Gold-grade piece of equipment.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t need to compensate us,\u201d Young Seven replied.\u201cTwo of your members ended up dying. I can\u2019t just leave you empty-handed! How would I be able to live with myself?\u201d Nie Yan insisted as he sent Young Seven a trade request. He held a favourable impression of Young Seven and his team. They were sincere and kept to their word, so he\u2019d be sure to keep in contact with them in the future.Urged on by Nie Yan, Young Seven finally hit accept, which brought up a trade window in front of him. However, when he saw the item that appeared in the window, his eyes widened in surprise.It was a pair of shoulder guards for Fighters! Although it could only be equipped at Level 10, it didn\u2019t detract from the fact that it was definitely a good piece of equipment! Strength +13, and Resilience +17... This sort of item would definitely sell for at least thirty silvers or higher on the marketplace!Young Seven initially thought Nie Yan would simply give them some random piece of Gold-grade equipment. After all, even the most average pieces of Gold-grade equipment were still quite expensive since their base properties were innately higher. He could never have imagined that Nie Yan would actually give him something of such high quality. Thinking of how beneficial it would be for them, he no longer had any plans of refusing Nie Yan\u2019s kindness. Otherwise, he\u2019d be failing his responsibility as a leader to his team considering that a Fighter\u2019s defense played an incredibly significant role in most teams.\u201cSince you insist, refusing would be impolite. Brother Nie Yan, if anything comes up and you need our help, please don\u2019t hesitate to ask. We\u2019ll definitely do our best to lend a helping hand!\u201d Young Seven replied in a truly sincere manner, unlike earlier when he was putting on a pretense of being polite.Truthfully, Nie Yan did in fact plan to give them an ordinary Gold-grade item in his bag. However, when he saw them giving an earnest effort to help him, to the point of even losing two of their members in the process, he changed his mind. He couldn\u2019t possibly let them suffer a loss. Besides, he didn\u2019t mind giving it away since it wasn\u2019t an item he could equip. As for the money he could have potentially received from selling it, he couldn\u2019t care less for an amount he considered pocket change.Nie Yan would have ended up disliking Young Seven if he had continued refusing out of politeness. He preferred people who were straightforward with their actions and didn\u2019t mince their words. These kinds of people were easier to interact with; plus, they weren\u2019t hypocrites. He glanced at Young Seven, then at the members in the back. \u201cIf I need any help in the future, I\u2019ll keep you guys in mind. I might even ask you to form a team with me.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019d gladly oblige!\u201d Forgotten interrupted from the side. They never had a set team in the first place, and though they liked the idea of forming one, they always lacked the time. Nie Yan\u2019s willingness to form a team with them was exactly what they were looking for. When they had met him near the pyramid earlier, they actually came with the intention of recruiting him. In retrospect, however, that didn\u2019t seem all too likely because, after witnessing his prowess, they realized their little temple was much too small to host a deity like Nie Yan.With the game servers having only been open for approximately two weeks, the number of players capable of forming a team wasn\u2019t very high. For Nie Yan to have won over so many exceptional players during this short period was without a doubt an extremely good opportunity. It wasn\u2019t like his current circumstances were all that bad either, though. He was able to frequently collect good items, farm high-level monsters, and occasionally join with other teams in dungeon runs.With the transaction complete, Nie Yan continued chatting with Young Seven, Forgotten, and the others a little longer, which caused his impression of them to grow even more favourable. In the end, he had ended up adding all of them to his friends list so it would be easier to contact each other in the future.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019ve already got the twenty silvers. Tell me where you are, and I\u2019ll head over there shortly. \u300dThe person on the other end of the call was Resplendent Bladelight.\u300c I\u2019m just outside the auction house. \u300d\u300c Alright , wait for me. I\u2019ll be there soon. \u300d\u201cIt was one of my acquaintances. He\u2019s coming here to meet me,\u201d Nie Yan informed Young Seven and the others.\u201cAh, no problem. We aren\u2019t exactly in a hurry to do anything right now, so we can continue chatting for a while longer,\u201d Young Seven replied. After finding out that Nie Yan was interested in forming a team, he began to weigh his options. Should he proceed with his original plan, or should he follow Nie Yan? He had always liked the idea of forming his own team, but after realizing that he lacked skilled players, he decided, albeit reluctantly, to stall this pursuit for a later date. Even so, he still couldn\u2019t help but feel a little unenthusiastic about the prospect of joining another person\u2019s team.Bladelight soon arrived in the area and began heading towards the auction house. On the way there, he spotted Nie Yan chatting with a few others near the entrance and promptly headed over.\u201cHello,\u201d Bladelight greeted Nie Yan.Young Seven and the others were inwardly shocked by Bladelight\u2019s appearance as they gazed at his equipment in awe. He was clad in silver-white armour and was holding an extravagant, golden shield in his left hand. Be it the armour or shield, from the design of the equipment and the runes engraved on their surface, they could immediately discern that his equipment was certainly out of the ordinary.That\u2019s some amazing equipment! Young Seven, Forgotten, and the rest couldn\u2019t help but have this first impression in their collective mind.Bladelight wasn\u2019t in a particularly a good mood as a hint of dejection could be seen on his face. Seemingly, the matter Nie Yan warned him about had likely already occurred, and this was reinforced by the fact that the guild emblem he previously wore on his chest was now gone.\u201cYou left the guild?\" Nie Yan asked.\u201cIt was a trash guild. I wouldn\u2019t have been happy staying there any longer,\u201d Bladelight replied in a riled up manner.Read m0re at nO\u03bdE\u2113n(E)X\u0442Nie Yan figured Bladelight must\u2019ve had a falling out with Hei Zhuo (Black Amazing) after hearing his response, and considering the lack of a guild emblem on his chest, arriving at such a conclusion was par for the course. Regardless of who it was, no one would be in the right frame of mind after finding out their lover and best friend were having an affair together behind their back, hence Bladelight\u2019s departure from his guild. Speaking of which, the sole reason the guild Bladelight and Hei Zhuo founded together, Unhindered, had reached such soaring heights in his previous life was because of Bladelight\u2019s prestige. It wasn\u2019t until later, when their expansion stabilized, that his influence waned due to the hidden machinations Hei Zhuo employed to seize full control of the guild. However, at present, Nie Yan\u2019s actions had unwittingly left Unhindered teetering on the brink of collapse right in the midst of their growth!\u201cIt\u2019s just a guild. Nothing to get down over,\u201d said Nie Yan as he attempted to comfort him. Although Bladelight could be somewhat overbearing, his overall character wasn\u2019t bad; otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have gone out of his way to warn Bladelight about Hei Zhuo.\u201cHaha, no worries! I\u2019m not taking things too hard.\u201d Bladelight forced a smile. Though he wore an uncaring expression, his inner feelings were anything but. He was the only one who truly knew his own feelings regarding the matter; however, he would never share these thoughts in public. He had already thrown away enough face in front of this person.If he didn\u2019t wish to bring this topic up, then Nie Yan had no reason to rub salt in an open wound.\u201cWell, since you\u2019ve left your guild, have you found a new team by any chance?\u201d Nie Yan asked. In his previous life, Bladelight was ranked as one of the top three Fighters in the game. Without a team supporting him, would he still be able to reach such heights?\u201cNo, I still haven\u2019t. Why, you decided to form one?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been thinking about it.\u201d\u201cWell, if you\u2019re able to establish a fixed team, I wouldn\u2019t mind joining. However, let me say this in advance. If I don\u2019t see any signs of this team being successful in the future, I\u2019ll probably leave,\u201d replied Bladelight in a rather frank manner. Although it was somewhat unpleasant to the ear, at least he was speaking truthfully, which was much better than those hypocrites who put on a facade of friendliness.\u201cNo problem, do as you wish. I\u2019m just forming one for the fun of it. The only thing I\u2019ll ask of everyone is to gather once in a while to run dungeons together. I don\u2019t plan on restricting the freedom of my members or anything,\u201d Nie Yan replied. He had always been a relaxed person, and he didn\u2019t want to go through the trouble of managing a team. If a team wished to retain their players, especially those who could overcome the challenges of a dungeon, restricting their freedom wasn\u2019t the way to achieve it. Instead, there needed to be a balance of goodwill, loyalty, and enticing prospects in order to encourage members to stay.Nie Yan\u2019s goal was to have an elite team that surpassed all other elites at his disposal, one that could help him obtain the best equipment. Once he possessed a group of loyal followers, he\u2019d be able to gather them for dungeon runs while giving them helpful pointers and advice. In doing so, he would be able to slowly nurture his forces.Nonetheless, Nie Yan still preferred to act on his own. Not to mention, his knowledge of the game far exceeded that of any other player. Even if he continued walking the path of a solo player, he\u2019d still be able to become an incredibly powerful Thief.\u201cThat sounds fine too. Just give me call whenever you plan a raid,\u201d Bladelight said.\u201cIt\u2019s still a bit early right now, so I\u2019ll let you know in a few days.\u201dMeanwhile, Young Seven had been listening in on their conversation from the side and was becoming riled up. If Nie Yan was capable of recruiting a Fighter who already had such amazing equipment, then there definitely wouldn\u2019t be any harm in joining his team. For their hodgepodge group of players, finding a good Fighter had always been an incredibly frustrating task.\u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready, count us in too!\u201d Young Seven interjected.\u201cAlright.\u201d Nie Yan nodded. His team now included a Fighter in the top three, one of the Seven Grand Priests, and a Thief that had once been on par with him. Tang Yao\u2019s damage was still passable, and he wouldn\u2019t have any problem recruiting a few more Mages with high magic damage either. Then, if he found a few more reliable members, he\u2019d have the makings of an elite team.Only after a little bit of chatting, Nie Yan received another call. This time it was Stone.\u300c Expert, are you busy today? \u300d\u300c Why? What is it? \u300d\u300c Erm... The game developers released an announcement that a new dungeon called Sosil Valley will be opening tomorrow. Since we want to be one of the first to explore the dungeon, our guild rescheduled the Agmota Muddy Wetlands run to today, \u300dStone replied. He felt rather embarrassed. Earlier they had discussed with Nie Yan and decided that the run would occur tomorrow, but now they had suddenly moved it to today.\u300c That\u2019s alright. I don\u2019t have any other plans for today. There should be enough time for a run. \u300dWhen Sosil Valley opened tomorrow, he would patiently wait until the players burned through the current supply of Black Phenol on the marketplace. Then, once the supply dried up, he would distribute his own stock at a gradual pace. However, that would be left for tomorrow. There wasn\u2019t much time left in the day, so he might as well spend it doing a dungeon run.\u300c I have a few friends with me, so let me say goodbye to them first. Let me know when and where we\u2019re meeting up. \u300d\u300c In five minutes at the Calore transfer point. \u300d\u300c Gotcha. \u300dAfter ending the call with Stone, Nie Yan turned around to face Bladelight, Young Seven, and the others, and said, \u201cSorry guys. It seems my friends want me to run Agmota Muddy Wetlands with them. Let\u2019s meet up again some other time.\u201d\u201cNo worries, I was planning to go off and grind some mobs anyway. Let\u2019s get this trade out of the way and then I\u2019ll head off,\u201d replied Bladelight as he nodded his head.Young Seven, Forgotten, and the rest gazed at Nie Yan with envious expressions. They had yet to form a fixed team and were already having a hard enough time finding players to run even the simplest of dungeons, let alone a high level dungeon like Agmota Muddy Wetlands. This bit of information only firmed the resolve in Young Seven\u2019s mind. Following Nie Yan would definitely be the right choice. Since it seemed other teams frequently invited him to join them in their dungeon runs, they could probably benefit a lot from his guidance.Nie Yan traded the Lion King\u2019s Shield to Bladelight, making his bag twenty silvers heavier. Afterwards, he said goodbye to all of them and headed for the transfer point.Upon receiving the item, Bladelight impatiently swapped out his current shield with the new one. The Lion King\u2019s Shield was an exceptionally stable tower shield with a brown, metallic hue. Moreover, the entire shield was reinforced by magic and emitted a dazzling, golden aura.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90 - Holy Empires Elite TeamPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 90 - Holy Empire\u2019s Elite Team\u201cWhat\u2019s the quality of that shield?\u201d Young Seven hesitantly asked. The brilliance coming from the Lion King\u2019s Shield could be described as dazzling. If this really was a Gold-grade shield, he could scarcely imagine the sort of price it would fetch if it was put on the auction house.\u201cGold-grade. Nie Yan sold it to me,\u201d Bladelight replied.\u201cFor how much?\u201d\u201cNot much. He gave me a friend discount, so it was only twenty silver,\u201d answered Bladelight. Speaking of which, aside from the shield, he probably owed Nie Yan a few favours now.Young Seven was slightly envious; Bladelight definitely received a great bargain. If a shield of that quality were to appear on the marketplace, it wouldn\u2019t be sold for anything less than thirty silver, quite possibly even more. Although players sold items to friends below market price, such a deep discount was certainly on the rare side. Unless Nie Yan\u2019s pockets were overflowing with money, no one would give away such a great shield for that low of a price. Yet in retrospect, this was most likely the case. Could a person who casually gave away Gold-grade equipment like they were stickers really be lacking in money?From the way Nie Yan normally acted, handled affairs, and treated his friends, they could tell he wasn\u2019t stingy when it came to his own people.After Nie Yan\u2019s departure, Young Seven and company continued chatting with Bladelight.\u201cYou guys wanna come level with me?\u201d Bladelight offered.\u201cSure, we\u2019d love to!\u201d\u201cBut before that... You know the shield you switched out? Would it be possible for you to sell it to us?\u201d\u201cSure, I don\u2019t have any use for it anymore anyway. Since you\u2019re Nie Yan\u2019s friends, I\u2019d feel embarrassed taking too much. Let\u2019s see... How does five silver sound? I had to take out a few loans from friends in order to buy that shield, and I still have to pay them back, so that\u2019s the best I can do,\u201d Bladelight replied. This was practically factory price. The Leo Shield he switched out absolutely wasn\u2019t worth only this much. The sole reason he gave them such a bargain was out of respect for Nie Yan.\u201cDeal!\u201d Young Seven exclaimed in an excited manner. When he gazed at the Leo Shield\u2019s properties, he knew he got it for considerably cheap. And just like that, their party obtained a rather decent shield.When Nie Yan arrived in the general area, he saw Sleepy Fox and several dozen others, totalling almost thirty players, already gathered and waiting at the transfer point.The equipment on their bodies was quite extravagant. The Arcane Mages were all suited in the Dark Winter set, and Priests, the Radiant Prayer set. The gear of the Warriors was out of the ordinary as well. For such a gaudy assembly to not attract attention while gathered around the transfer point was nigh impossibleThe players in the vicinity were awestruck and were making inquires about the identities of these elites.\u201cWhich guild does that team belong to?\u201d\u201cWhat? How you could not recognize them? They\u2019re from Holy Empire. The player wearing the silver-white armour, that\u2019s their leader, Sleepy Fox!\u201dThe Holy Empire players felt their hearts well with pride but even more so with arrogance as these passing murmurs entered their ears. Each of them was an elite carefully selected by the top brass of their guild. Even in the previous VRMMOs before Conviction, they had all been members of Holy Empire.Sleepy Fox glanced at the stream of players entering from the main street and happened to spot Nie Yan walking amidst the crowd.\u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d Sleepy Fox declared to his teammates.Without exception, every member of the team turned their gaze toward Nie Yan. None of them understood why their captain, Sleepy Fox, held this Thief in such high esteem. Who among them wasn\u2019t a handpicked veteran elite? They were thoroughly unconvinced by this stranger.Many of these members were unfamiliar with Nie Yan, some even expressing misgivings, but regardless of their opinion, all eyes were focused on him. However, even while under the scrutiny of their gazes, Nie Yan remained quite collected as he directly made his way to Sleepy Fox.As soon as they made eye contact, Sleepy Fox acknowledged him with a slight nod. He could tell how much ability a person had from the way they carried themselves. Only by having self-confidence could a person achieve success.\u201cExpert, you\u2019ve arrived!\u201d Stone was the first one to step out and greet him.\u201cMhm...\u201d Nie Yan acknowledged Stone\u2019s greeting, then turned to face Sleepy Fox. \u201cWe meet again.\u201d\u201cIndeed,\u201d answered Sleepy Fox.Dusk was also there amongst the group. After running Treant Forest together, the two could be considered well acquainted, so he also stepped forward and greeted Nie Yan with a smile.While the four chatted, the surrounding members were surprised to discover that, despite their captain being the prestigious guild leader of Holy Empire, Nie Yan\u2019s presence was not the least bit inferior, as he spoke in neither a subservient nor overbearing tone. Not only this, but at many points in the conversation, he was the one taking the leading role. After witnessing such a scene unfold, the identity of this Thief once more became shrouded in a veil of mystery.\u201cI hear he\u2019s some expert who\u2019s already cleared Agmota Muddy Wetlands, and this time around, he\u2019s only here to guide us through the dungeon.\u201d\u201cHow is that possible? In the entire server, there are only several dozen teams who\u2019ve cleared Agmota Muddy Wetlands. Are you sure?\u201d\u201cIt should be, right..?\u201d The person who spoke had never personally confirmed this fact, so his confident tone immediately faltered.The members behind Sleepy Fox quietly discussed amongst themselves, occasionally stealing glances at the equipment on Nie Yan\u2019s body in order to determine whether he had really cleared Agmota Muddy Swamplands only to quickly find themselves disappointed. He didn\u2019t have a single piece of equipment on him that came from that dungeon, but that didn\u2019t mean his equipment was ordinary either. In fact, it was quite extraordinary\u2014this was undeniable.\u201cBrother Nie, will you be leading us through the dungeon this time around?\u201d asked Sleepy Fox. He fixedly stared at Nie Yan as if he was trying to figure something out from the other party\u2019s expression while even making conjectures about his background. Then, he lowered his gaze and glanced at the dagger by Nie Yan\u2019s hip. He could discern that its quality was of at least Gold-grade.Sleepy Fox\u2019s words immediately attracted the attention of the members around him.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me. If you wish to lead, I\u2019ll simply follow your pace. However, if you want me to guide all of you, beside first dibs on all Thief drops, I also want the Unknown Transfer Scroll that drops from the King Manticore,\u201d Nie Yan calmly replied. It\u2019s not as if he didn\u2019t know Sleepy Fox was trying to probe him. He figured Sleepy Fox also wouldn\u2019t be so rash as to easily hand over the leadership of this run to him.What kind of arrogant tone is that? The members behind Sleepy Fox couldn\u2019t help having this thought. Each and every one of them was filled with indignation. Just who the hell does this guy think he is?Nie Yan acted as if he didn\u2019t notice the uproar he caused and simply stared at Sleepy Fox while awaiting his response. If Sleepy Fox couldn\u2019t make up his mind, he\u2019d simply withdraw from this dungeon run and enter later with his own team.Read m0re at nO\u03bdE\u2113n(E)X\u0442Though, truthfully, the Unknown Transfer Scroll was an extremely attractive item that he\u2019d like to obtain early on. Although it was just another consumable, to Nie Yan, it held incredible value!Even though many of the members of the team doubted Nie Yan\u2019s abilities, Dusk and Stone held their belief in him firm, and they quickly intervened to pacify their enraged teammates.At this point in time, Sleepy Fox finally took notice of Nie Yan\u2019s level. His heart shook in surprise, and he couldn\u2019t help but recall what Stone had told him. When Stone first met him, Nie Yan had been a complete beginner, fresh at Level 0. Yet now, only several days later, Nie Yan had already reached Level 6 and caught up right to his footsteps. Wasn\u2019t his levelling speed a bit too monstrous? When Nie Yan had informed them that he deleted his old character and restarted, he hadn\u2019t really been convinced. However, the evidence in front of him clearly stated otherwise. Not to mention, if he didn\u2019t delete and start over, how could he be so informed. How else would he be able to reach Level 6 in such a short period of time?Perhaps Nie Yan really did have some ability.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 - Trembling Milos HousePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 91 - Trembling Milo\u2019s HouseSleepy Fox pondered for a moment before coming to a decision. He turned around and swept his strict gaze over each and every member, quelling the uproar with but a glance.This very scene evidenced just how influential Sleepy Fox was to his team.\u201cEveryone, listen up! I\u2019m going to dissolve our team and have Brother Nie invite you into his own. Today, he\u2019ll be acting as the leader of this run in my stead,\u201d informed Sleepy Fox to his team.Another commotion erupted from the crowd as players looked at each other in dismay. For their captain to allow a complete stranger to lead them through a run, this was the first time such an event had ever occurred. What if he didn\u2019t know what he was doing and caused them to wipe? If that happened, then wouldn\u2019t they all end up losing twenty percent of their experience bar?!\u201cCaptain, how is that alright? Please reconsider!\u201d\u201cYes, please reconsider! What\u2019ll happen if we end up getting wiped?\u201d\u201cCan we trust in his ability? Does he even have any?\u201d\u201cIf I say it\u2019s alright, then it\u2019s alright. Now enough chit chat, hurry up and accept the invite. I want you all to follow Brother Nie\u2019s orders as if they were mine. If you still refuse to listen, then don\u2019t blame me for kicking you out of the team. Also, to anyone who doesn\u2019t put in their full effort and causes us to fail the run... Well, I\u2019m sure you already understand what the consequences are,\u201d Sleepy Fox replied sternly. He followed a simple principle: Those he felt were incompetent would never be relied upon, and those he relied upon would never be doubted! If Nie Yan was going to act as team captain, a role which required Sleepy Fox to put his faith in him, then he would grant him the highest authority.After watching the video of him leading another team through Treant Forest, Sleepy Fox also felt a veil of mystery hanging over this person.When their captain responded in such a way, they had no choice but to accept his decision, and the members who had expressed dissatisfaction promptly fell into silence. They all understood an order given by their captain could not be violated lest they be expelled from the guild. From the very beginning, Sleepy Fox had always ruled over his subordinates with an iron fist.Nie Yan slightly nodded his head in approval. In both discipline and strength, Holy Empire\u2019s elite team was far above Yu Lan\u2019s (Blue Feather) team. The difference in atmosphere and quality was almost palpable. They certainly didn\u2019t have a smug bastard like Chen Bo who put everyone beneath his eyes. Even though several Thieves were rather unhappy with their captain\u2019s arrangements with Nie Yan, they absolutely wouldn\u2019t dare to voice their dissatisfaction.\u300c System: Sleepy Fox has joined your team. \u300d\u300c System: Flying Stone has joined your team. \u300dRead m0re at nO\u03bdE\u2113n(E)X\u0442In the brief span of a few moments, a thirty-player team was formed. Although Nie Yan was the captain of the team, it was still under Holy Empire\u2019s name.\u201cAlright, now to inspect your stats. Mages, announce your magic damage; Fighters, announce your defense; and Priests, announce the strength of your Lesser Heal.\u201dAnd so, in a quick and orderly fashion, each member reported their respective stats. Nie Yan reviewed the information of these players. All of their equipment was excellent, and except for three players who were slightly lacking, everyone\u2019s stats met the minimum requirements for clearing Agmota Muddy Wetlands on Specialist difficulty. Before they set off, Nie Yan ordered those three players to purchase a few scrolls.\u201cIs there anything else we need? We\u2019ve already bought enough Anti-Paralysis Potions,\u201d asked Sleepy Fox. He had a certain premonition, which made him believe Nie Yan wouldn\u2019t merely be leading them through Agmota Muddy Wetlands on Easy or Normal. Otherwise, why else would he have had ordered some of their players buy scrolls to supplement their stats? Their team absolutely possessed the raw stats to conquer the dungeon on those difficulties without using such items.\u201cWhich of you Fighters have Demoralizing Shout?\u201d Nie Yan swept his gaze over the group but received no response.\u201cI have it and one other,\u201d Sleepy Fox answered. He felt bewildered and surprised by Nie Yan\u2019s sudden question. Did clearing Agmota Muddy Wetlands really require such a high-level skill?\u201cAlright, not bad!\u201d Nie Yan nodded. He didn\u2019t explain himself and proceeded to the Priests. \u201cHow many of you have Dispel?\u201dAll five Priests in the crowd promptly raised their hands in response.Sleepy Fox did have some brains. He understood Dispel was extremely useful and didn\u2019t spare expenses to obtain the skill for each of his Priests. Naturally, the only reason he could do so was because his guild had a strong foundation since even a single Dispel skill book cost quite a pretty penny.\u201cHow many of your Paladins have Repel Evil?\u201d\u201cOne,\u201d Sleepy Fox answered.Nie Yan wrinkled his brows.\u201cIt\u2019s not enough?\u201d asked Sleepy Fox after seeing Nie Yan\u2019s change in expression.\u201cThen what about Remove Blind?\u201d\u201cNone.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll need to purchase two Repel Evil skill books and a Remove Blind skill book then. It\u2019s also best if you have your Shadow Priest learn Immobilize, but unfortunately, that skill book is a bit too rare. So even if we don\u2019t have it, we\u2019ll just have to make do.\u201d\"The Shadow Priest in my team has already learned Immobilize. As for the Repel Evil and Remove Blind skill books, I\u2019ll go and get them. Give me around half an hour at most.\"\u201cI need to buy a few things. So once you find those items, notify me, and I\u2019ll be over shortly,\u201d Nie Yan just recalled there was an essential item required to clear the dungeon. Following the end of their conversation, he left the transfer point area and headed for the northeast district.Nie Yan wanted to buy two different items that were exceedingly useful at this early of a stage in the game. If not for the dungeon run being moved to today, he would\u2019ve nearly forgotten about it.The northeast district of Calore was basically one giant slum, and rows of dilapidated buildings ran along every street and pathway. Just about any point in the slum was accessible through an alleyway. The infrastructure of the district was incredibly complex, resembling one giant labyrinth, and it was quite easy for players who entered the area to lose their way in these narrow paths. Even the largest streets were merely two meters across while the much more numerous alleyways could only fit a single person.Nie Yan entered the winding and twisting paths of the district. The alleys were paved with slabs of stone while trash collected at the sides of the buildings.I wonder if I\u2019ll still able to find it, Nie Yan pondered.Countless forks in the path connected with each other to form one giant, confusing network. It had been quite a while since he last visited this area, so his memories of it had become fuzzy and indistinct. Though no matter how vague these recollections were, he could only rely on them and fumble his way through while hopefully going along the correct path toward his destination.The location he sought was extremely remote, so finding it wasn\u2019t a simple matter, especially since he only remembered the general direction it was in.Hidden within this slum was actually a secret shop. The items sold there were decent, but they were too expensive and were only useful at the lower levels. He himself had only been to this shop two or three times in his previous life, specifically when he planned to run Agmota Muddy Wetlands and needed to purchase the necessary items. This was the main reason why he had suddenly recalled the existence of this shop when they were about to run the dungeon.He meandered around the alleys for ten minutes, taking a wrong turn several times, before finally finding a certain house. He gazed over at the plaque that hung over a giant wooden gate.\u300cTREMBLING MILO\u2019S HOUSE\u300dI think it\u2019s this place... Nie Yan was slightly hesitant. He vaguely recalled that it did seem to have such a name.No, this should be the place, Nie Yan reassured himself. He slowly pushed opened the gate and entered the courtyard where he was greeted by the sight of a broken down thatch building.His vague memories began clearing up. He had found the right place!He walked past the dark hallways, down the staircase, and entered the basement. At the bottom, aged magic lamps shone through the darkness with a pale yellow glow.Rather than saying this was a cellar, it was better to call it a display room for trash. The walls were lined with shelves that stocked goods and various potion bottles filled with green, blue, red... liquids of all colours.There, an unkempt old man with a scraggly beard in a worn robe was examining a potion bottle that he had just shaken in his hand. The old man noticed Nie Yan just as he walked down the staircase. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201dthe old man greeted in a somewhat rude tone.Then, a small window appeared in front of Nie Yan, displaying an assortment of special items.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 - AgmotaPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 92 - AgmotaThis old fogey had always been one to treat his customers in a cold and indifferent fashion, an attitude that hadn\u2019t changed one bit since Nie Yan had first met him in the previous timeline. When he stumbled upon this shop by accident back then, his level was already in the thirties. The items sold there were low-level and overpriced, so he only shopped there once or twice to buy a few things. As a result, he only vaguely remembered the location of the shop.Very few players were willing to put in the time and effort to explore this area due to its remoteness, meaning even fewer were aware of this old man\u2019s existence. Perhaps aside from Nie Yan, no other players had yet to discover this shop, but this would change in the future. The slums of the northern district would be demolished and redeveloped into a new area for commerce. Despite that, Trembling Milo\u2019s House would somehow persist through this process and remain in business. The new commercial area would bring in players which finally led to the public uncovering him. However, the new exposure didn\u2019t stop this old man from continuing to price gouge his customers; thus, only well-off beginners would frequent the shop.Nie Yan scanned over the merchandise listed in the window. The items he currently sought were two different scrolls and a particular pouch of dust: Web Scroll, Sheep Transformation Scroll, and Flash Powder.He purchased a dozen pouches of Flash Powder for fifty coppers each, three Web Scrolls, and two Sheep Transformation Scrolls.Milo was probably a Mage since he often created scrolls out of basic spells and offered them for sale. The scrolls Nie Yan bought contained Web and Sheep Transformation. Web was a spell that provided decent crowd control and could only be learned by Mages once they reached Level 10. The Web Scroll, however, could be activated by any player as soon as they hit Level 5. As for the Sheep Transformation spell, it couldn\u2019t be learned until Level 20. Correspondingly, the requirements of the spell were also lowered in scroll form. The caveat being these scrolls came at a hefty price, costing two and three silvers respectively.The prices of the scrolls increased accordingly with the usefulness of the spells they contained.These items were so costly that even Nie Yan, who was filthy rich, would feel a slight ache in his heart when employing them. Thus, they would only be used sparingly; otherwise, he\u2019d be spending more money than he earned. Outside of the major guilds, perhaps no other players were willing to purchase these things.When Nie Yan thought back to the previous timeline, he remembered he had been penniless at this level. If he had been able to, he would have broken copper coins in half just to save a little money, so how would he have been willing to use such items? Fortunately, his present circumstances were substantially different, so much so that he could be described as rich and imposing.After purchasing the items, he left Trembling Milo\u2019s House and headed for the transfer point.\u300c We\u2019ve gathered the skill books, and we\u2019re all ready to set off. We\u2019ll all need to hurry, though, since the servers go down in two hours, \u300dSleepy Fox messaged.\u300c I\u2019ll be there shortly, \u300dNie Yan replied.The return trip was much quicker, and he soon arrived at the transfer point.\u201cYou\u2019re here. Did you get what you needed?\u201d Sleepy Fox greeted. He was quite curious. Just what did Nie Yan buy for him to take so long to return?\u201cYeah, I got it.\u201d Nie Yan nodded.However, since Nie Yan didn\u2019t bother explaining, he wouldn\u2019t make any further inquiries.With no other issues delaying them, everyone was ready to set off. Soon, the members of the team began stepping into the transfer point. Their destination was a small town called Nate, which meant \u201cmarshland settlement\u201d in the Ancient Common language. Since the town was situated in a remote area, the price of the transfer was ten coppers per player.Built in the middle of the marsh, Nate was besieged by poisonous beasts almost daily. This environment tempered the residents of the settlement into strong hunters, as evidenced by the ones who regularly passed through the town entrance, carrying crossbows along with the day\u2019s hunt. The town\u2019s main source of income came from selling these animal products, so the goods that could be purchased from the shops were mostly claws, fur pelts, and other items along these lines. In addition, materials of much higher quality would spring up for sale every once in a while, making this place a paradise for players who focused on a crafting profession such as Tailoring.After arriving in the town, Nie Yan and company didn\u2019t dally, promptly heading to the quest giver.Unlike in Calore, the players on the street didn\u2019t seem too surprised by the emergence of Nie Yan, Sleepy Fox, and the rest. Since many major guilds passed through this town en route to Agmota Muddy Wetlands, such a strong entourage of players was no strange sight to them.While walking through the town, Nie Yan and the others arrived at the entrance of an imposing manor. Not only was this the most luxurious home in town, possessing a style that befitted a residence constructed in the marshland, it also stood atop a small hill, filled with vibrant, lush willows and other plant life as it overlooked the rest of the town. A small path cut across the hill; despite its winds and curves, it lead directly to the manor.Read m0re at nO\u03bdE\u2113n(E)X\u0442All of the team members halted their steps and gazed at Nie Yan.\u201cI\u2019ll go receive the quest,\u201d Nie Yan announced to the team and then walked over to the entrance gates.After pushing open the metal gate, he proceeded along the path and shortly arrived at the manor\u2019s doors. Then, he entered the building and walked straight past a luxurious looking living room, through a long a winding hallway, and into a dusky bedroom. Upon reaching his destination, he found an old man lying in bed, surrounded by numerous servants and townsfolk who stared at him with worried expressions. His complexion was sickly, and it looked like he was on his last breath.\u201cMayor Monda was inflicted with the King Manticore\u2019s poison. If we don\u2019t find an antidote soon, he\u2019ll...\u201d\u201cRoss! Stop speaking drivel!\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry...\u201d\u201cSigh... It\u2019s fine. At this point, the only thing that can save the mayor\u2019s life is the King Manticore\u2019s eye.\u201d\u300c System: You\u2019ve arrived at Mayor Monda\u2019s residence and accidently overheard some discussion. The mayor has been poisoned by the King Manticore. The vile creatures of the marsh have taken many innocent lives. \u300d\u300c System: Are you willing to save Mayor Monda by slaying the King Manticore and retrieving its eye? \u300dYes!\u300c System: You speak out and agree to save the mayor\u2019s life. The townsfolk and servants cast a grateful gaze. You\u2019ve received their respect. Your Influence in Nate has increased by 3. \u300dPlayers received three Influence when accepting the Agmota Muddy Wetlands quest for the first time. Subsequent attempts would garner no further benefits.\u300c System: Explore the Agmota Muddy Wetlands in search of the King Manticore. Please select a difficulty. (Easy, Normal, Hard, Expert, Specialist) \u300dSpecialist!\u300c System: You\u2019ve selected Specialist. All members will have their stats increased by 10%. Withdrawing from this instance is not possible. \u300dOnce the quest was accepted, the team was not allowed to get into conflict with other players. In return, they received the protection of the town. So, if they were provoked by other players, the guards would come forward in their aid.After receiving the quest, Nie Yan walked out of Mayor Monda\u2019s manor. If they completed the quest, they could return here to receive a certain reward.Seeing Nie Yan come out of the gates, Sleepy Fox walked forward to greet him. \u201cSpecialist? Are you confident we can beat it?\u201d\u201cIt should be fine,\u201d Nie Yan replied. More accurately, it should be fine as long as no accidents occurred.As usual, Nie Yan\u2019s habit of not explaining things gave Sleepy Fox a headache. He simply couldn\u2019t understand this person\u2019s way of thinking. In comparison, Dusk was much more confident about this run. Although Agmota Muddy Wetlands was several tiers higher than Treant Forest in terms of difficulty, he still held absolute faith in Nie Yan\u2019s skills.The teammates who were unaware of the circumstances also felt shocked. Why was it Specialist? They all believed this had to be some sort of mistake. They had already run Agmota Muddy Wetlands three times but failed to clear it even once. In one of the runs, they had managed to reach the King Manticore, only to be defeated miserably shortly after. Their main tank possessed over one hundred and thirty defense and over three hundred and sixty health. Although these stats couldn\u2019t be considered the best, they were still top-tier. In spite of this, the King Manticore demolished their frontline in a matter of seconds. Even now, the only reason they were willing to make another attempt was because their Priests had recently learned Radiant Barrier, a spell that could shield an ally from incoming damage.Yet Nie Yan, in all his overbearing arrogance, had actually decided to pick Specialist. How could they not be incensed? It was fine if he wanted to court death, but why did he have to drag them along with him!?Despite this, they had no choice but to swallow their indignation. The quest difficulty had already been selected, and there was no way to withdraw. Moreover, their guild leader, Sleepy Fox, hadn\u2019t voiced his opinion on the matter. Thus, they could only wait and see how this situation developed.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93 - ManticorePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 93 - ManticoreNie Yan and the others walked along the trail that cut through the marsh and advanced south. As dusk encroached, the scenery around them gradually grew darker. They encountered few players enroute to the dungeon, so much of the journey was uneventful and even somewhat bleak.After several minutes, Nie Yan and company arrived at a checkpoint in the middle of the trail. Just ahead were two watchtowers, one erected on each side of the path, and stationed in each of them was a crossbow-carrying NPC guard.\u201cBeyond this point is the King Manticore\u2019s territory. This is a forbidden area, so please turn back,\u201d one of the guards called out.\u201cWe\u2019re adventures who wish to proceed to Agmota. We\u2019re seeking to slay the King Manticore and retrieve its eye in order to treat Mayor Monda\u2019s poison,\u201d Nie Yan replied in a tone that was standard for advancing the quest.\u201cSo it was like this... Brave adventures, the King Manticore is a dangerous and vile creature. I advise you to bring items that can cure paralysis,\u201d forewarned the guard. \u201cThe mayor\u2019s life is at stake, so I hope your mission ends in success!\u201d The two guards allowed Nie Yan and the rest of the team to pass.As soon as he stepped past the watchtowers, the entire team was transported inside the instance.On arrival, an intense stench of blood and decay assaulted their noses as it freely permeated the air. Numerous corpses scattered the bog; some were fresh while others had completely rotted away, leaving only skeletal remains behind. The temperature plummeted, steeply , turning the atmosphere to one of cold and gloom. Suffice to say, the environment inside the dungeon was noticeably different from the one outside.Signs of death could be seen everywhere across this long stretch of marsh.Ahead of Nie Yan and the team was a small den. Manticores usually gathered in prides, so their dens often contained ten to several dozen individuals. Some were tasked with hunting prey, and others stayed behind to rear the young. Prides were headed by an Alpha Manticore, a Leader-class monster, while the rest of the pride consisted of females and the young. Manticores were monsters possessing the head and body of a lion and a scorpion\u2019s poisonous tail. If struck by the stinger at the end of their tails, the player would become poisoned and lose a certain amount of health each second. Furthermore, there was also a chance of paralysis. Therefore, if the player didn\u2019t bring Anti-Paralysis Potions, they would end up maimed to death before the poison had any meaningful effect.For the most part, as long as the team\u2019s Fighters made sure to cure their paralysis as soon they were inflicted with it, no problems should arise.\u201cHow many Manticores do you think are in that den?\u201d\u201cI already investigated. They number around sixteen,\u201d Nie Yan replied. Since he was already at the front of the group, he had taken the initiative to survey their surroundings.\u201cSixteen!? Oh my God!\u201d\u201cWhen we ran it on Easy or Normal, the most we\u2019d ever get was a group of five or six...\u201dAll of the team members wore expressions of dismay. Manticores, with their high health, were notoriously difficult to deal with. This held even truer for the Alpha Manticore who was several times more powerful than their normal counterparts. Even on lower difficulties, they often faced great peril whenever they encountered a group of five or six Manticores. If they were careless for even a moment, their team would end up surrounded and killed.Yet that den had sixteen of them! Even if they had received a ten percent stat boost, it was still impossible for them to deal with so many Manticores.Nie Yan activated Transcendent Insight to examine the pride.Alpha Manticore (Leader): Level 3Health: 1830/1830Read m0re at nO\u03bdE\u2113n(E)X\u0442Manticore: Level 3Health: 620/620Although only one of the Manticores was a Leader-class monster, since Nie Yan and the team had entered the dungeon on Specialist, even the common mobs would have their health, defense, and other stats increased significantly, so if all of those Manticores came charging over, the team would undoubtedly end up wiping in an instant.\u201cThe Manticores move as a group. Do you have any plans?\u201d asked Sleepy Fox after he turned to Nie Yan. He had to admit, Nie Yan\u2019s use of the crossbow in Treant Forest was ingenius, but that kind of tactic might not necessarily work against these Manticores.The slow witted Treants simply weren\u2019t on the same level as Manticores.\u201cIf I entrusted this task to you, how would you deal with this?\u201d replied Nie Yan with a question of his own.Sleepy Fox wrinkled his brows. He wasn\u2019t willing to show weakness in front of Nie Yan, so after pondering for a moment, he replied, \u201cI\u2019ve got an idea.\u201dDespite there being so many Manticores, he actually thought up a plan? It seems I\u2019ve been underestimating him.\u201cOh? How do you plan on clearing the den? Let\u2019s go with your plan first, and I\u2019ll follow along. Just tell me what I need to do,\u201d Nie Yan replied before retreating to the side. He was trying to think of a way to gain the team\u2019s trust. Otherwise, players might not follow his instructions correctly during tense situations. If that were to frequently occur, they\u2019d have no hope of overcoming the King Manticore.In the event Sleepy Fox\u2019s plan failed to subjugate the Manticore and he acted afterwards, the team would naturally be more willing to accept his orders. On the flipside, if Sleepy Fox did actually succeed, he would be saved the effort of doing the work himself.\u201cAlright.\u201d Sleepy Fox thought for a while, then began arranging the members into formation. The foe was a pride of sixteen Manticores, so naturally, he was still somewhat nervous. After he was done, he faced Nie Yan and said, \u201cNone of my teammates are comparable to you, so I\u2019ll have to trouble you with aggroing the Manticores.\u201cNie Yan inspected Sleepy Fox\u2019s arrangements. The formation took advantage of the boulders and trees in the vicinity by positioning the frontliners in a chokepoint. The Mages were safe, as they occupied the high ground. The Priests were well-hidden and stood in relatively safe spots in the rear, while the Paladins were positioned directly behind the frontliners, ready to provide assistance at any time.It appeared Sleepy Fox did have some skill in arranging his troops. The current formation was capable of dealing enormous amounts of damage.\u201cAre you confident we can succeed?\u201d Nie Yan asked in a worried tone. Although the formation was formidable, in a direct confrontation, the end result would still be their defeat. Why was he so sure that this formation would hold up against so many Manticores at once? Unless... maybe he had a hidden card of some sort? If so, Nie Yan was curious to see. After all, this was Holy Empire\u2019s elite team. How could they not have a few tricks up their sleeves?Sleepy Fox gave a confident nod.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll aggro them over,\u201d Nie Yan replied. He then drew closer to the den, with crossbow in hand, and found a suitable vantage point to shoot from.\u300cWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u300dSeveral bolts fired from the crossbow. Two bolts struck trees at the far rear of the den, and a split second later, the third bolt landed on the Manticore closest to them.The third bolt aggroed three Manticores over to Nie Yan while the rest of the pride was momentarily distracted by the sounds in the rear. However, after noticing three of their members charging in the opposite direction, they also stormed towards him.\u201cNot bad!\u201d Sleepy Fox hardly held back on his praise. Nie Yan\u2019s movements were swift and agile, he had sharp senses, and he possessed techniques that were extremely unique and innovative.Sleepy Fox inwardly schemed. If he were to offer, would Nie Yan be willing to join his guild? Once Nie Yan became his subordinate, he would definitely receive a prominent position in Holy Empire. However, after getting more familiar with him, he vaguely sensed Nie Yan wasn\u2019t the sort of person who would agree to lodge under another person\u2019s roof. In other words, Nie Yan probably preferred to lead instead of being led.When Nie Yan returned, the three Manticores also followed.\u201cViolent Waves, block them!\u201d Sleepy Fox ordered. Violent Waves Rampant Surge was the number one Fighter in Holy Empire, his role being the team\u2019s main tank. In the previous timeline, he was also considered a remarkable player. However, he and the other outstanding members were mostly overshadowed by the brilliance of their guild leader. One had to know, when Sleepy Fox retrieved the Chapter of Courage, he had eventually reached the apex and obtained the entire Holy Viridian set. From then on, only a scarce few players were able to rival him. As a consequence, many of the outstanding members serving under him ended up being overlooked. However, without an elite team supporting him in the shadows, how could a player like Sleepy Fox grow to be so powerful?62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 - Templar MagicPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 94 - Templar MagicViolent Waves Rampant Surge stepped forward and intercepted one of the Manticores. He opened with Heroic Strike followed by Shield Bash. As soon as they witnessed their companion being attacked, the other two Manticores immediately switched targets and joined the fray. Against all three Manticores, Violent Waves raised his golden tower shield and firmly defended against their assault.His movements were extremely nimble and adept, especially for a Fighter. However, if he didn\u2019t at least possess this little bit of skill, how could he have received the role of main tank in Holy Empire\u2019s elite team?A line of damage values rose above Violent Waves as he endured the relentless onslaught of the Manticores. Soon, a gentle radiance enveloped him, replenishing a large portion of his missing health.His health bar continued to fluctuate as the battle raged on. Though, ultimately, the Priests weren\u2019t able to keep pace as his health fell progressively lower. It appeared even Holy Empire\u2019s best Fighter wasn\u2019t able to endure against these fierce attacks.The rest of the frontliners, which included Sleepy Fox, rushed forward and entered the battle in order to alleviate some of the pressure.\u201cRemember to use Anti-Paralysis Potions!\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201d Violent Waves replied.Meanwhile, the Mages in the rear were emitting a brilliant radiance as magical energies coalesced. Some were still channeling high-level magic while others had already finished and were firing off their spells.\u300cBang! Bang! Bang!\u300dMagic bombarded the Manticores and instantly obliterated the one they first engaged.Nie Yan circled behind one of the two remaining Manticores and assailed it with Concussive Blow followed by Vital Strike.\u2212103\u2212123\u201cHoly shit! What kind of damage is that!?\u201d Many of the team members felt their minds turn to mush. Were those really the attacks of a Thief? Why did they seem so much fiercer than some of the attacks of the Warriors in the team?From their perspectives, Warriors naturally had the higher attack because Thieves accounted for it with high attack speed. This was common sense. So, when they saw Nie Yan deal so much damage, they were astonished.While dual-wielding daggers, Nie Yan possessed both high attack speed and high damage. This combination was simply too overpowered!\u300cThud! Thud!\u300dWith that, the remaining two Manticores collapsed on the ground. The entire team worked with quick efficiency, so even by Nie Yan\u2019s standards, he still had nothing to complain about.After the first three Manticores were killed, the other thirteen had finally arrived.All six frontliners, Sleepy Fox included, readied themselves to engage the Manticores. Directly behind them were the Paladins. Since they were a class that wore plate armour, they could occasionally serve as frontliners as well. Moreover, Paladins with good equipment possessed defenses no lower than a Warrior\u2019s.\u201cDammit, these Manticores deal a lot of damage. Violent Waves, try to hold off that Alpha Manticore,\u201d Sleepy Fox ordered. As their guild leader, even he felt incredibly nervous when he saw Violent Waves\u2019 health continuously fall lower and lower. Needless to say, the other team members weren\u2019t faring much better.The amount of damage these Manticores could dish out exceeded Sleepy Fox\u2019s expectations. Even though there had been just three of them, they were barely able to cope with it. Yet now, there were thirteen of them. Thankfully he placed their formation in a choke point; otherwise, if so many powerful Manticores were allowed to freely get to their backline, he imagined the consequences would be disastrous.It was probably a bad idea to continue gauging a Specialist dungeon by using their experiences on Normal.\u201cCold Maple, cast Scorching Meteor. Otherwise, it\u2019ll be too late,\u201d Sleepy Fox declared solemnly. The healers were under far too much pressure. Even the slightest mistake could lead to serious consequences. He didn\u2019t dare to dally any longer. He had to play all of the cards in his hand.Wait, what? Scorching Meteor? Templar Magic?\u201cWai-!\u201dNie Yan wanted to stop him, but it was too late. That Holy Mage called Cold Maple had already taken out a golden coloured talisman and begun chanting the spell.Ahh, what a waste! Why would you use Templar Magic in this kind of place! Nie Yan felt quite annoyed.If he had known they had such a spell in their arsenal, he would\u2019ve prevented them from using it until the boss. The King Manticore was the most dangerous when it reached critical health, so the burst damage of a spell like Scorching Meteor would\u2019ve been perfect for such a situation. Not only would it have saved them much time and effort, it would have also prevented potential casualties. However, by now, it was too late. The spell had already begun channeling; even if it was cancelled, it would still go on cooldown.Out of the many classifications of magic, there were over several that were considered the strongest. They comprised Humanity\u2019s Templar Magic, Giant\u2019s Kasate Magic, Beastmen\u2019s Berserk Magic, Elves\u2019 Lunar Spirit Magic, Demons\u2019 Black Magic, Undead\u2019s Fate Magic, and a few others. Furthermore, there were also powerful magics just a tier lower such as Elemental Hall Magic, Undead Temple Magic, and so on. Each one possessed cultural and regional characteristics and was tied rather closely to the factions of the players.There was no doubt that all of these magics were incredibly powerful.Templar Magic was also divided into sixteen ranks.Scorching Meteor was classified as the weakest rank one Templar Magic. Make no mistake, just because it was the weakest Templar Magic didn\u2019t mean it was actually weak. Among the spells available to the current player base, Scorching Meteor was an exceedingly formidable skill. Its cooldown was two days, and the requisites for casting it were notoriously harsh.The spell required a Templar Talisman that needed to be prepared in advance, which meant inscribing and imbuing. It would take nearly an hour to inscribe a spell like Scorching Meteor onto a talisman. Then, for there to be sufficient energy to power the spell, the talisman needed to be imbued with mana. Even the most common rank one spells required at least a thousand or more mana points. In other words, for a player like Cold Maple, he would have to drain at least three bars worth of mana to cast the spell.Moreover, after casting Scorching Meteor, the spell required two entire days for it to be cast again. So, it seemed quite obvious that this spell shouldn\u2019t be used rashly.Naturally, Templar Magic wasn\u2019t easily obtainable. A single skill book could cost upwards of one gold or more. Moreover, just because someone had the money didn\u2019t mean it was necessarily purchasable.Sleepy Fox had ordered Cold Maple to cast the spell. The main reason was because the situation seemed desperate, but the other reason was because he wanted to show Nie Yan his power and wealth.After all, very few teams possessed spells as powerful as Templar Magic.Under the ferocious assault of the Manticores, Sleepy Fox and the other frontliners were gradually being pushed back as they tried to buy as much time as possible.Ten seconds. Twenty seconds. Thirty seconds. Scorching Meteor required three sets of syllables to invoke. Finally, the golden talisman in Cold Maple\u2019s hand emitted a dazzling brilliance, whereupon a giant, scorching sphere emerged in the sky and burst into countless white meteors that streaked toward the Manticores.\u300cBang! Bang! Bang!\u300dThe meteors fell like rain as they battered the earth below.\u2212302, \u2212321, \u2212301, \u2212310, \u2212310... A stream of damage values rose into the sky. Each meteor blossomed into beautiful fireworks of light, resembling white lotuses as they bloomed into the open air.After the third wave of meteors, almost all of the Manticores were killed. The only one remaining was the Alpha Manticore, but the meteors continued to fall. \u300cBang! Bang! Bang!\u300dAfter the fifth wave, even the Alpha Manticore was on its last legs.The frontliners charged forward, and due to it being severely weakened, the Mages easily finished it off with another round of attacks.Were it not for Scorching Meteor, they would have had a very tough time dealing with the Alpha Manticore. Perhaps without it, their team would have even been wiped out.The area in front of them was littered with Manticore corpses. The few Thieves in the team walked over and began retrieving and sorting the dropped items.Read m0re at nO\u03bdE\u2113n(E)X\u0442\u201cSo, what do you think of that spell?\u201d Sleepy Fox asked. He felt somewhat smug, but he didn\u2019t reveal it in his expression. After all, he believed there was a chance Nie Yan hadn\u2019t seen such a powerful spell before. He might have even broadened Nie Yan\u2019s horizons.Nie Yan forced out a smile. \u201cWhy did you have to use Templar Magic here. It\u2019s simply too wasteful, don\u2019t you think? If that had been your secret plan all along, what\u2019s going to happen when we encounter the next den?\u201dNie Yan wasn\u2019t some newbie who just joined the game. His experiences far exceeded Sleepy Fox\u2019s wildest imaginations, so he hadn\u2019t been the least bit surprised, much less impressed, by a rank one Templar Magic like Scorching Meteor.In fact, he was incredibly vexed and disappointed. Sleepy Fox using Templar Magic here was complete overkill. By the time they encountered the next den, not only would they not have the spell as back up, they would be stuck with no way to advance!Sleepy Fox felt slightly embarrassed after listening to Nie Yan\u2019s comments. If there were another way, he also wouldn\u2019t have been willing to use Templar Magic, but their previous situation had been dire. Furthermore, the other reason he decided to use the spell was because he wanted to impress Nie Yan. Unfortunately, he garnered the complete opposite reaction and criticism instead, with Nie Yan identifying the spell as Templar Magic with just a single glance. Not only that, but Nie Yan seemed to know much more than him. Just who in the world was this person?62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95 - ConvincedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 95 - Convinced\u201cBut if we didn\u2019t use Scorching Meteor, the team would have definitely been wiped. How else are we supposed to deal with so many Manticores at once?\u201d Sleepy Fox asked. He didn\u2019t quite believe Nie Yan could clear such a large den of Manticores without the use of large-scale magic.\u201cWe could\u2019ve cleared it without wasting Scorching Meteor, but my method requires an extremely skilled Thief,\u201d Nie Yan replied. Since he dared to bring them into a Specialist dungeon, naturally, it meant he knew how to clear the dens. Spells like Scorching Meteor were only one-offs since they couldn\u2019t be repeatedly cast during a run.Sleepy Fox didn\u2019t reply; instead, he stayed taciturn and sunk into deep thought. If Nie Yan really could clear such a large den of Manticores by relying solely on skill and this current group of players, wouldn\u2019t that mean Nie Yan was more capable of leading the team than him, their captain and guild leader?\u201cAlright, then let\u2019s try your way out,\u201d conceded Sleepy Fox, finally breaking his silence. He wasn\u2019t a narrow-minded person who only cared about his reputation. If there was someone more capable, he would readily submit. He admired those who possessed ability and talent. And in Holy Empire, players who were more talented than him in one aspect or another could be found everywhere, yet he still remained as the guild leader!\u201cCaptain! A piece of Gold equipment dropped!\u201d one of the members called out in a pleasantly surprised tone.\u201cWhat kind of equipment? Come here and show me,\u201d Sleepy Fox replied.Sleepy Fox, Nie Yan, and the others examined the piece of equipment. It belonged to the Priest\u2019s Divine Blessing set.\u201cDon\u2019t get too excited yet. Out of all the current dungeons, Agmota Muddy Wetlands on Specialist has the highest drop rate for top-quality equipment, so one dropping here isn\u2019t all that strange. Just wait a bit, you\u2019ll be seeing much more equipment of this quality or higher the further we get into the run,\u201d Nie Yan said. He was quite accustomed to seeing equipment of this quality. After all, in comparison to Legendary equipment, they were no different from other ordinary drops.As for how the team would decide who this piece of equipment went to had nothing to do with him, since by the end of the run, he would receive his promised share regardless.Beside being knowledgeable and experienced, Sleepy Fox sensed Nie Yan was also quite self-reliant. These types of people were the most difficult to recruit as subordinates since they didn\u2019t like being ordered around. It seemed roping Nie Yan into Holy Empire wasn\u2019t going to be as easy as he initially thought.Sleepy Fox gave the set item to one of the stronger Priests, and with that, they then set out for the next area.Not much time passed before they encountered another den. This one was roughly the same size as the one from earlier which contained seventeen Manticores.Sleepy Fox turned to Nie Yan and said, \u201cLet\u2019s see your method now.\u201dNie Yan nodded and scanned the surrounding terrain for a suitable location. Under his command, he and the other Thieves in the team, numbered from one to three, set out to their specified positions.These four soon arrived in their designated positions and took up a square formation. Then, Nie Yan proceeded to explain in detail what role each member would have.The Manticores lazily roamed the area around their den, completely oblivious to the players who were lurking nearby and eying them like prey.\u300c Remember, don\u2019t tangle with them. Run away as soon as you see them aggro onto you. Don\u2019t dally either. They\u2019re too fast for you. If you\u2019re even a second too slow, you won\u2019t be able to get away, \u300dNie Yan carefully reminded.After listening to these instructions, Sleepy Fox suddenly had a flash of insight. It seemed Nie Yan planned on splitting the Manticores into more manageable groups. The only problem was the other Thieves in the team were simply too slow. Pulling these Manticores exceeded their abilities.Although these Thieves were able to evade the Manticores for a period of time, they definitely couldn\u2019t do it forever, and even then, it wouldn\u2019t be for that long. Eventually, they would get overtaken, and then they would be screwed.When the other Thieves finished their preparations, Nie Yan announced through the intercom,\u300c Once we begin, don\u2019t stray from my commands. \u300dThe three Thieves were completely focused. All of them took a deep breath when they saw Nie Yan take out his crossbow and aim at the Alpha Manticore.Read m0re at nO\u03bdE\u2113n(E)X\u0442Eh...? They\u2019re not all attacking together? Sleepy Foxwas a bit taken by surprise.As Nie Yan peered through the sight, he lined up the target and fired.\u300cWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u300dThree bolts flew through the air before striking the Alpha Manticore. Immediately, after being attacked, the Manticore discovered the location of its assailant. It roared in indignation then pounced toward him.The numerous common Manticores also followed closely from behind. Upon seeing this, Nie Yan turned tail and fled.He actually dared to take on all the aggro by himself? How courageous, Sleepy Fox thought. If Nie Yan didn\u2019t have complete confidence in his ability, there was no way he would even attempt to take on such a difficult task that was tantamount to throwing his life away.\u300c Number Three, attack the three Manticores at the rear! \u300dNie Yan yelled through the intercom. Number Three didn\u2019t dare to idle any longer and immediately drew the string back on his short bow and shot out three arrows.\u300cWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u300dThe arrows whistled in the air and hit their respective targets, one manticore each.Upon being attacked, the three Manticores in the rear diverted their aggro, separated from the group, and began pursuing the Thief with the short bow instead.The Thief hastily retreated to the forces waiting at the sidelines and pulled the Manticores along with him.Nie Yan was madly dashing through the bog, inwardly counting the seconds as they passed. Three... Two... One... \u300c Number Two, go for the next three! \u300dNumber Two didn\u2019t delay and shot three arrows at the three rearmost Manticores. Thus, another three were peeled off from the main group.Since the Thieves would only pull three at a time, the frontliners didn\u2019t feel too much pressure and were able to easily hold them off. Therefore, the Mages could freely fire their spells, requiring only three rounds to kill the Manticores.Nie Yan ran like the wind as he continuously evaded the pursuit of the Manticores. Thanks to his speed and agility making him as slippery as a loach, their attacks would always fail to hit their target. It appeared even if they were given all the time in the world, these Manticores still wouldn\u2019t be able to touch a single hair on his head.While Nie Yan was distracting the main group, the three Thieves took turns in aggroing a few Manticores at a time. As they pulled three Manticores off of the main group with each rotation, they gradually shaved down what was once a formidable pride.Spells fell like rain as the Manticores dropped like flies. Nie Yan\u2019s method was undoubtedly a success. However, it could only be accomplished by a Thief with excellent fleeing abilities and spatial awareness. If someone else were to attempt this strategy, they definitely wouldn\u2019t have the ability to pull it off and would only end up as food for the Manticores.\u201cDamn, he\u2019s really fast!\u201d Sleepy Fox couldn\u2019t help but exclaim. He watched as Nie Yan made fools out of these Manticores while running circles around them.\u201cGuild Leader, who the hell is this guy!?\u201dThe members in the team couldn\u2019t help but wonder. Just where did their guild leader find such an obscenely overpowered Thief?\u201cShut up! Stop slacking!\u201d Sleepy Fox shouted.The chattering immediately stopped, and they immediately focused their attention back onto the incoming Manticores, not daring to utter a single additional word. After several rounds, another wave was annihilated.\u201cShit! I\u2019m out of mana.\u201d\u201cUse a Mana Potion!\u201dOn the third wave, Sleepy Fox was shocked to discover that each time they had finished one wave, another Thief would arrive with three Manticores in tow. In neither a slow nor rushed pace, the next wave would always arrive in a timely manner.Sleepy Fox was left speechless by Nie Yan\u2019s impeccable timing.None of the players here were fools. They all understood how challenging of a task it was to evade such a large group of Manticores. Their hearts were only filled with admiration, and they no longer dared to look down on him like they did when he arrived.Initially, none of the members were convinced Nie Yan would be able to guide them through Agmota Muddy Wetlands. Now, however, they were convinced of his ability.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 - King ManticorePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 96 - King ManticoreSpeaking truthfully, the pressure Nie Yan felt while evading these Manticores was immense, but such actions were required for the sake of convincing the team of his ability, which was also why he refrained from using the items he purchased beforehand.The Alpha Manticore was much faster than its brethren. So despite the use of a Haste Scroll, it eventually closed the distance and leaped forward.As it pounced toward him, baring its fangs and claws, Nie Yan suddenly dodge rolled the fatal attack that was mere inches from taking off his head.A bright blue light trailed behind the Alpha Manticore as it swiped only thin air. In spite of its quick attack speed, Nie Yan had avoided the attack in a timely manner, resulting in its massive frame barrelling past him.Nie Yan quickly recovered from the roll and fled in a different direction.This bold display of skill, where he was merely an inch away from death, left the onlookers endlessly shocked and excited. Nie Yan was truly a fearless person for daring to perform such a risky maneuver.Upon landing, the Alpha Manticore veered its body and then continued after Nie Yan.In order to keep buying more time for the rest of the team, Nie Yan deliberately ran in a zigzag pattern.Every six to eight seconds, the three rearmost Manticores pursuing Nie Yan would be peeled from the main group. The formidable group of Manticores gradually dwindled until only the Alpha Manticore and an ordinary Manticore remained.If not for the team members being there to personally witness it themselves, they would never believe a single Thief could be capable of evading such a large pride of Manticores for so long, especially one with an Alpha Manticore leading the chase.At this moment, no member in Sleepy Fox\u2019s team dared to call his ability into question. They finally understood their captain taking the time to invite Nie Yan and even conceding leadership of the run to him wasn\u2019t without reason!A player of Nie Yan\u2019s caliber was definitely deserving of such consideration!Despite there being no real evidence, Sleepy Fox surmised Nie Yan was quite possibly a member of a powerful team that must have already beaten Agmota Muddy Wetlands on Specialist difficulty before; otherwise, Nie Yan wouldn\u2019t be so familiar with luring such a large pride of Manticores. Assuming this conjecture was true, didn\u2019t that signify the strength of Nie Yan\u2019s team had already reached a terrifying level?With each and every revelation, Nie Yan\u2019s origins were becoming more and more mysterious.Never in his wildest dreams would he think that Nie Yan was actually someone who had reincarnated into the past. Nie Yan did indeed beat Agmota Muddy Wetlands on Specialist difficulty, but that was in the previous timeline where walkthroughs for all low-level dungeons were widespread and publicly available. By then, the number of teams that had cleared the Specialist dungeons were as numerous as the grains of sand on a beach shore.As Sleepy Fox pondered over this matter, he saw Nie Yan leading the remaining Manticores over to them.\u201cEveryone, get ready for battle!\u201d Sleepy Fox hurriedly announced. The Leader-class Manticore was still going to be rather difficult to deal with.Violent Waves raised his shield and ran over to intercept the Alpha Manticore.Though, before he could reach Nie Yan, the Alpha Manticore suddenly pounced.\u201cWatch out!\u201d several people cried out in alarm.Seeing Nie Yan about to be killed, many members couldn\u2019t bear to watch any longer. It appeared, even after persisting for long, he was still going to fall at the final stretch.In that instant, as if he had grown eyes at the back of his head, Nie Yan suddenly pivoted his foot and dodged to the side.The abrupt change in direction resulted in the Alpha Manticore\u2019s claw harmlessly brushing past him.Sleepy Fox and a few other who witnessed the scene all broke out into a cold sweat. The attack had missed by just the tiniest fraction of an inch. However, it was this small gap\u2014this line of demarcation\u2014that represented the pinnacle of skill.Unlike the others, Nie Yan wore an expression of complete calm on his face despite having been just a hair\u2019s breadth away from death; he acted as if such a haggaring situation was merely an everyday occurrence.\u201cShield Bash!\u201d Violent Waves rammed his shield into the Alpha Manticore and helped take aggro off of Nie Yan. Following immediately after were the numerous spells arriving from the rear line.\u300cBang! Bang! Bang!\u300dThey bombarded the Alpha Manticore\u2019s body as damage values rose above its head.Meanwhile, another Fighter charged ahead and took the aggro of the other Manticore, assuring it wouldn\u2019t attack anyone else.During all this, Nie Yan circled behind the Alpha Manticore and unleashed a chain of attacks.\u221267\u221273\u221278The damage Nie Yan dealt was quite considerable, causing the Alpha Manticore\u2019s aggro to switch back to him. However, a moment later, Violent Waves let out an ear piercing roar that carried an intimidating force.Demoralizing Shout!The shout resulted in the Alpha Manticore immediately halting its movements. Then, in response, it turned back to Violent Waves and furiously started attacking him once more.Demoralizing Shout was able to intimidate a monster for several seconds and interrupt their attack. At the same time, it was also able to attract aggro. This was the bread-and-butter within the toolkit Fighters had at their disposal to pull monsters.Since the Alpha Manticore had become isolated, the battle was much easier and ended without much suspense. Under the constant barrage of spells, the Alpha Manticore was quickly, and simply, blasted into smithereens.After collapsing onto the ground, the Alpha Manticore dropped a piece of a Silver equipment for Paladins.Read m0re at nO\u03bdE\u2113n(E)X\u0442Unfortunately, in a Specialist dungeon, getting a Silver equipment drop seemed a bit lackluster.They really could clear an entire Manticore den without the need for Scorching Meteor. Completely amazed at this fact, Sleepy Fox was now thoroughly convinced Nie Yan\u2019s skills were beyond exceptional. He was an incredibly talented player. Sleepy Fox really wanted to recruit him into the guild and even offered very generous conditions, but he was tactfully refused. Now, since it appeared Nie Yan becoming his subordinate was unrealistic, he decided the next best plan was to maintain a friendly relationship.Afterward, the team proceeded to clear over a dozen dens of similar size. Sleepy Fox was the first to reach Level 7 while the other members followed in succession. Seeing everyone else level up, Nie Yan glanced at his experience bar. He was still thirty-five percent away from levelling up, so he wasn\u2019t far off either. During this period of time, where they cleared den after den, Sleepy Fox and his team acquired many good pieces of equipment. Among them was a pair of Thief Gold-grade leg guards: Strength +10, Balance +6. It could be considered decent and was better than the ones he had currently equipped, so Nie Yan directly took it. With the events that had transpired, the other Thieves in the team no longer had the courage to quibble with Nie Yan over it either. Regardless, by the end, the entire team had upgraded their gear in one way or another.Nie Yan calculated in his head. From this run alone, he would receive at least ten or so silvers. Although it wasn\u2019t much, it was still better than nothing.Continuously employing the same tactics, Nie Yan and the team gradually approached the King Manticore\u2019s den which was located at the center of the marsh. It was wide open space with many Manticores roaming around with roughly sixty to seventy of them. If one looked into the distance, over a hundred meters away, they would catch sight of a gigantic, golden-maned Manticore wandering about. It was many times larger and significantly more muscular than the other Manticores around it. This was the one and only King Manticore.\u201cIf only we had Scorching Meteor for this boss...\u201d Sleepy Fox mumbled in embarrassment. He couldn\u2019t help but feel regret over wasting it in such a rash manner so early in the run.\u201cNo worries, the area here is big enough that we can lure the Manticores without attracting the attention of the others. The only difficult part is actually killing the King Manticore. It\u2019s Lord-class,\u201d Nie Yan said. The boss\u2019 Easy and Normal difficulty counterparts were Sub-Elites while the Hard and Expert ones were Elites. Only in Specialist would the players have to confront the Lord variant of the boss.Although the Specialist counterpart was rather difficult to beat, the quality of the drops scaled accordingly with the increase in difficulty. Naturally, the kind of equipment that could be retrieved from this boss was on an entirely different level than ones from its lower difficulty counterparts. At the very least, an item of Gold-grade would drop, and occasionally, a Dark-Gold item would drop as well. Besides equipment, the boss also frequently dropped special items such as gems, special crafting materials, and unique consumables.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97 - Fog and LighthousePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 97 - Fog and Lighthouse\u201cStill, if it weren\u2019t for your help, we would\u2019ve never made it here,\u201d Sleepy Fox said.During the journey, many members started to view Nie Yan in a different light. Their gazes were still filled with a complicated emotion, but more than anything, they were feeling deep admiration. Now, they heeded his every word with almost absolute faith. His leadership had borne excellent results.The fact he was able to bring them to this point alone was already ample proof of his ability to command.People like Nie Yan were destined to become legends.\u201cBrother Nie, are you absolutely certain you don\u2019t wish to join our guild? Even among the other guilds, our Holy Empire is ranked quite highly. If Brother Nie is willing to join, then our treatment would be just as good as, if not better than, the other guilds\u2019. If that still isn\u2019t enticing enough, then how about you enter our guild as an honorary member for now? You won\u2019t even be obligated to do anything. All we\u2019ll ask is that you keep in contact with us.\u201d Sleepy Fox tried throwing out another one of his recruiting pitches. Nie Yan didn\u2019t bear any sort of emblem on his body, which meant he shouldn\u2019t be a member of any guild. This was rare for a player as skilled as Nie Yan, so he wasn\u2019t willing to give up just yet.\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d Nie Yan lightly chuckled as he politely declined the offer. He understood that Sleepy Fox was simply trying to rope him into becoming involved with the guild. Once he was an honorary member, Sleepy Fox would gradually attempt to change his mind until he became a full-fledged member of Holy Empire. Although honorary membership would grant him many benefits, he knew there was no such thing as a free lunch in this world. He didn\u2019t want to spend his time being a dog for some guild.\u201cEh... Alright, then so be it,\u201d Sleepy Fox replied, clearly disappointed.\u201cHowever, if any opportunities arise in the future, we should look to cooperate again,\u201d Nie Yan added. This virtual world would birth countless legends of financial windfalls. More than just being a second world in name, this game turning into one would become a reality. It would be viewed by numerous figures as a new land of growth and opportunity. In his previous life, when Cao Xu was at the peak of his power, he had five large guilds at his beck and call and owned various businesses spread across Calore, Nisode, and Radiant City. Not only that, but the industries under his control were quite diverse as well, covering over ten different markets. As a result, his assets in the virtual world were valued in the hundreds of billions. Nie Yan needed to become more powerful than Cao Xu, powerful enough to thoroughly crush him. He needed to become so powerful that Cao Xu would be forced to think twice before acting against him. Only then would his mind be at ease. Nie Yan wouldn\u2019t allow the events of his past life to repeat themselves in this one. This, however, was impossible to achieve alone, which was why he needed to gradually build up a network of reliable contacts. The person who currently stood before him, Sleepy Fox, was one such person who was worthy of developing a relationship with.\u201cOf course, I\u2019d be glad to.\u201d Sleepy Fox believed Nie Yan was merely talking about running another dungeon together. Never did Sleepy Fox consider that he might\u2019ve actually meant something else.\ud835\udd17\ud835\udd25\ud835\udd26\ud835\udd30 \ud835\udd20\ud835\udd25\ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd2d\ud835\udd31\ud835\udd22\ud835\udd2f \ud835\udd32\ud835\udd2d\ud835\udd29\ud835\udd2c\ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd21 \ud835\udd23\ud835\udd26\ud835\udd2f\ud835\udd30\ud835\udd31 \ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd31 \ud835\udd2b\ud835\udd2c\ud835\udd33\ud835\udd22\ud835\udd29-\ud835\udd1f\ud835\udd26\ud835\udd2b.\ud835\udd20\ud835\udd2c\ud835\udd2aHowever, Nie Yan didn\u2019t bother expanding upon this any further and instead turned his attention back to hunting down the Manticores.\u201cSeven Nights, I want you to expand our coverage by scouting out the southeast. Be wary of the traps, especially the quagmires,\u201d Nie Yan said. Seven Nights Showstopper was the weakest Thief on the team, a handsome young man who had just turned twenty. Currently he didn\u2019t amount to much in Sleepy Fox\u2019s eyes, but his talent and potential weren\u2019t bad. According to Nie Yan\u2019s past life, this man was to mature into the guild\u2019s number one Thief in the future. Though Seven Nights was very quiet and reserved, which made it hard to gauge his thoughts, he had a gentle personality, so Nie Yan had a good impression of him. Because of this, Nie Yan had subconsciously favoured Seven Nights a bit more than the other Thieves when issuing orders.\u201cAlright,\u201d replied Seven Nights. It was finally his turn to show off. After receiving Nie Yan\u2019s order, he quickly dashed toward the southeast without feeling even the slightest bit of hesitation.As someone who played the same class, Seven Nights felt nothing but admiration for Nie Yan, even to the point of prostrating before him. What made him extremely happy was the fact that Nie Yan treated him quite politely despite not paying any attention to his companions, the other two Thieves in the team. Once he began his designated task of scouting the southeast, a thought popped up in his head. When this run was over, he would definitely make sure to ask Nie Yan for some advice on playing a Thief.Nie Yan was completely unaware this slight discrepancy in treatment had birthed great waves in Seven Nights\u2019 heart.Why scout the southeast? Sleepy Fox thought to himself, slightly puzzled. Logically speaking, since the King Manticore was right in front of them, shouldn\u2019t they just directly head for it instead of creating extra work for themselves by scouting the southeast?\u201cYou\u2019ll find out why in a bit,\u201d Nie Yan said, as if he knew what Sleepy Fox was thinking.Several minutes later, Seven Nights spoke through the team intercom.\u300c I discovered an old light house, but there are a few Manticores guarding the area around the entrance! \u300d\u300c Good, climb the lighthouse and turn on the light at the very top. Use Stealth to circle to the back and enter through the entrance there. Make sure those Manticores don\u2019t detect you! \u300dNie Yan ordered. Seven Nights was quite fast, and with his skills, avoiding those Manticores shouldn\u2019t pose much of a challenge.Then, after another several minutes, a shabby lighthouse in the distance began emitting a little light.The light grew increasingly brighter until its radiance became so intense that it penetrated the dark fog of the marsh and arrived at Nie Yan and the team\u2019s location.Under the illumination of the lighthouse, the dark fog that shrouded the Agmota Muddy Wetlands surprisingly dispersed.The dark fog that once stifled everyone\u2019s mood had mostly cleared out right away.Sleepy Fox finally understood. This lighthouse was quite possibly the essential factor required in order to beat the King Manticore!\u300c You did well! \u300dSleepy Fox praised Seven Nights.Upon hearing this, Seven Nights felt quite happy since their captain rarely praised his subordinates, but he was also fairly pleased because Nie Yan had given him the chance to display his skills!\u201cAlright, since the lighthouse is lit, let\u2019s proceed to the next step. There are three Elite-class Manticores roaming the area near the King Manticore. We\u2019ll have to draw them out one at a time and then eliminate them,\u201d Nie Yan explained. This was one of the more difficult steps in clearing the dungeon on Specialist. It required a lot from the players, but he had a simple solution.Sleepy Fox felt as if his heart had skipped a beat. One had to know, even on Hard and Expert, only the final boss was an Elite. Yet, on Specialist, not only did they have to deal with the King Manticore, a Lord-class monster, they had to contend with three Elite Manticores as well!It could be seen rather clearly just how difficult dungeons on Specialist were. Thinking about what they were about to face, Sleepy Fox felt somewhat nervous and apprehensive. Even if they were able to kill the three Elite Manticores, with what could be lying in wait for them, would it really be possible for them to beat the final boss?The only thing that was of some comfort was the fact that, despite this being a dungeon on Specialist, they had still been able to arrive at this point. Even if they wiped here, the number of items and pieces of equipment they had obtained so far would be able to make up for their losses. Since their losses were no longer an issue, they could commit everything to the final battle without fear.The entire team shared this resolve.So with this attitude, many of the members were prepared to go all out!These three Elite Manticores were the queens of this entire pride, so their strength also couldn\u2019t be looked down upon.Nie Yan and company proceeded to clear the area of all the common Manticores. Afterward, the only monsters that remained were the three Elite Manticores and the King Manticore. The only problem was that they were fairly close to one another. In this wide open patch of dry land in the center of the marsh, they would occasionally roam around in a leisurely manner, and at other times, they would lay on their stomachs and briefly rest.Everyone in the team was currently sitting down and resting under the cover of shrubbery. They were replenishing their health and mana. Only after they all fully recovered would they dare to finally engage one of the Elite-class Manticores.During this time period, Nie Yan was the only one who wasn\u2019t recovering with the others. He was actually searching for a suitable spot.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98 - Repel EvilPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 98 - Repel EvilNie Yan peered through his crossbow sight from behind the brush he was using for cover. After a short while, he lowered his gaze and shook his head. This place won\u2019t do either... With such thoughts in mind, he got up and moved to another area, only to repeat the same actions and move on yet again.\u201cWhat do you think he\u2019s doing?\u201d Dusk asked, flabbergasted, as he observed Nie Yan busily moving from one area to another. It was still too early to be aggroing the Elites, wasn\u2019t it?\u201cWell, he shouldn\u2019t be looking for a vantage point, that\u2019s for sure. He hasn\u2019t been within firing range this entire time,\u201d Sleepy Fox replied. He was also rather curious as to what Nie Yan was up to.After all, it was impossible for a crossbow to hit from this far away!Nie Yan walked behind a tree and began gauging the distance. This should do! Finding a suitable spot, he raised his crossbow and fired in the direction of one of the Elite Manticores.\u300cWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u300dThree bolts flew out in succession.Sleepy Fox was taken aback. Wait, are you really aggroing them? Isn\u2019t it still too early? We haven\u2019t even fully recovered yet! However, he suddenly recalled. Wait, that\u2019s not right. They\u2019re still out of his attack range.As expected, the bolts gradually lost momentum and slowly dropped until they eventually hit the ground.They had fallen just ten meters short of the closest Elite Manticore and thirteen away from the next closest.An Elite Manticore\u2019s detection range extended out to ten meters.This knowledge was the result of compiling the numerous experiences of players who had run Agmota Muddy Wetlands on Specialist in Nie Yan\u2019s past life.Nie Yan just so happened to know of a little trick that made use of this information, and with his skills, he could easily pull it off even with his hands tied behind his back.Out of the three Elite Manticores roaming around, only the closest one heard the sound of the bolts hitting the ground. Thus, it was also the only one that moved towards the source with the intent of investigating. After walking two or three meters, it stopped in place and began scanning the surrounding area, yet it wasn\u2019t able to find anything, so it turned around and began to head back\u300cWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u300dBefore it could take even a single step back, however, Nie Yan fired off another round of bolts which landed just ten meters away from the Elite Manticore yet again. The Manticore halted and resumed its search for the source of the sound, but it still couldn\u2019t find anything. Then, just when it was about to head back, another sound came from an area ten more meters away.Nie Yan repeated this action several more times. Whenever the Elite Manticore was about to turn and leave, he would send three more bolts to a spot just barely within its detection range. Meanwhile, Nie Yan did his best to avoid being spotted by the Manticore as he attracted its interest with crossbow bolts.In this fashion, the Elite Manticore was continuously drawn away all by its lonesome self. The distance between itself and the other Manticores was growing increasingly wider with every repetition.Sleepy Fox and the other members were shocked as they watched this scene unfold before their very eyes. Never did they expect that Nie Yan would use such a method to draw out the Elite Manticore.If they continued like this, then it might actually be possible to kill the Elite Manticores and the King Manticore individually, one after another.This method was something they could\u2019ve never come up with on their own. Furthermore, it wasn\u2019t a tactic that just anyone could employ either. Nie Yan\u2019s timing and accuracy were both simply impeccable.\u201cEveryone, get into position. Since Brother Nie has revealed his skills, we mustn\u2019t show any weaknesses either, unless you want others to look down on us. Remember, you\u2019re the handpicked elite of Holy Empire. Show some vigour! Who knows, perhaps today we really will be able to beat Agmota Muddy Wetlands on Specialist!\u201d Sleepy Fox stood tall and puffed up his chest. Seeing their captain stand up, the other members all followed suit, standing up one after another. Their eyes blazed with determination as they followed Sleepy Fox\u2019s orders and began getting into formation.The final hurdle was to clear these three Elite Manticores and the Lord-class King Manticore, a hurdle so insurmountable that even Sleepy Fox originally felt they had no hope of succeeding. However, who would have thought that Nie Yan randomly moving about would actually cause such an utterly drastic change in their circumstances.Perhaps they really would be able to clear this dungeon!After being drawn out by Nie Yan, the lone Elite Manticore was well over twenty meters away from its companions.Nie Yan raised his crossbow and took aim once more.\u300cWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u300dThree bolts flew out once again, but this time they actually hit the Elite Manticore.Upon being struck, the Elite Manticore immediately discovered Nie Yan\u2019s presence. The attack had enraged it, and after letting out a low growl, it pounced toward its aggressor.With that, Nie Yan turned around and fled towards the rest of the team.\u201cEveryone, prepare for battle!\u201d Just as Nie Yan spoke, he discovered Sleepy Fox and company were already in formation.Violent Waves raised his tower shield, charged forth, struck the Elite Manticore with Heroic Strike, and then followed with Taunt in order to completely grab its aggro. Afterwards, he retreated back, raised his shield, and moved into a defensive stance.Now, the Elite Manticore\u2019s aggro was fully on Violent Waves. It raised its paw and furiously swiped at his shield with a force so tremendous that he was knocked back several steps.\u2212123 A damage value floated above his head.Such terrifying damage!Violent Waves only had three hundred or so health. If the Manticore managed to land a critical hit, then he\u2019d be in immediate peril.\u201cPaladins, cast Repel Evil on Violent Waves!\u201d Nie Yan yelled. The Elite Manticore\u2019s claws were strengthened with a sinister magic that made their attacks deal enormous damage.Shortly after Nie Yan made the order, a shallow blue light enshrouded Violent Waves. Immediately, the damage he was receiving from the attacks fell by thirty perecent.Only then did Sleepy Fox and the others discover that a Paladin\u2019s Repel Evil was effective at reducing the Elite Manticore\u2019s damage. The effect was even better than the Barrier spell. Furthermore, Barrier could only absorb so much damage before breaking. Under the Elite Manticore\u2019s attacks, it would\u2019ve shattered almost instantly. However, Repel Evil would last for ten seconds regardless of the damage it reduced. After the ten seconds were over, a different Paladin could cast another Repel Evil. No wonder Nie Yan wanted to have at least three Paladins with Repel Evil in the team. It was because three Paladins would mean Repel Evil would have a hundred percent uptime on the main tank as long as they took turns and cast it immediately after the previous one expired.With a significant portion of the damage being negated, the whole fight progressed in an orderly manner. Violent Waves was able to easily tank the Elite Manticore\u2019s attacks while the Mages at the rear gradually chipped away at its health.The Elite Manticore opened its mouth and spewed a poisonous green mist in Violent Wave\u2019s face.Violent Waves, who was firmly blocking the Elite Manticore\u2019s attacks, suddenly found himself deprived of his vision, causing him to fumble and lose sight of his target. However, this didn\u2019t last more than a moment, and he was soon able to see clearly again. This was thanks to a Priest who had cast Remove Blind in a timely manner. Having regained his vision, Violent Waves immediately discovered that the Elite Manticore was about to switch its aggro to someone else. If someone else were to pull aggro, the Elite Manticore would proceed to wreak havoc on the backline which would most likely end up killing many of the Mages.\ud835\udd17\ud835\udd25\ud835\udd26\ud835\udd30 \ud835\udd20\ud835\udd25\ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd2d\ud835\udd31\ud835\udd22\ud835\udd2f \ud835\udd32\ud835\udd2d\ud835\udd29\ud835\udd2c\ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd21 \ud835\udd23\ud835\udd26\ud835\udd2f\ud835\udd30\ud835\udd31 \ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd31 \ud835\udd2b\ud835\udd2c\ud835\udd33\ud835\udd22\ud835\udd29-\ud835\udd1f\ud835\udd26\ud835\udd2b.\ud835\udd20\ud835\udd2c\ud835\udd2aDemoralizing Shout!Violent Waves\u2019 use of Demoralizing Shout intimidated the Elite Manticore, forcing it to retreat several steps. After waiting to be healed some more, he charged forward and struck it with Shield Bash, pulling the Elite Manticore\u2019s aggro back onto him. He felt a cold sweat run down his forehead. If he had to wait even a second longer for the Priest to cast Remove Blind, then the team would\u2019ve most likely been wiped.Nie Yan\u2019s leadership gave rise to extremely important results.All of the frontliners tightly surrounded the Elite Manticore and let loose every attack skill they had. Nie Yan also circled behind it and unleashed a flurry of skills.The sound of explosions endlessly rang out as the Elite Manticore was bombarded with spells, sending damage values rising up into the air one after another.When the Elite Manticore\u2019s health fell below five percent, its fur transformed into a bright red that dazzled the eyes.It was about to go berserk!62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When it entered a berserk state, its attack power increased threefold. Being the one who had to deal with this increase, Violent Waves felt immense pressure as he tried his best to endure its assault while the Priests cast Lesser Heal with reckless abandon as they struggled just to keep him alive.\ud835\udd17\ud835\udd25\ud835\udd26\ud835\udd30 \ud835\udd20\ud835\udd25\ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd2d\ud835\udd31\ud835\udd22\ud835\udd2f \ud835\udd32\ud835\udd2d\ud835\udd29\ud835\udd2c\ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd21 \ud835\udd23\ud835\udd26\ud835\udd2f\ud835\udd30\ud835\udd31 \ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd31 \ud835\udd2b\ud835\udd2c\ud835\udd33\ud835\udd22\ud835\udd29-\ud835\udd1f\ud835\udd26\ud835\udd2b.\ud835\udd20\ud835\udd2c\ud835\udd2aNoticing the situation turn dire, Nie Yan flicked his wrist as a pouch of Flash Powder emerged in his hand and then lobbed it at the Elite Manticore.\u300cPoof!\u300dThe pouch exploded and scattered white powder into the air. This fine powder was akin to thousands of tiny needles as it released a blinding radiance that pierced into the Elite Manticore\u2019s eyes.The members of the team were also affected by the Flash Powder, but to a much lesser extent unlike the Elite Manticore that had lost all vision.The pouch of powder was something Nie Yan had purchased prior from Trembling Milo. This item was able to release an intense flash of light that could momentarily blind the enemy for several seconds. The player could then take advantage of this time by either fleeing or attacking their opponent. Although the item cost a pretty penny, it was nevertheless extremely useful.\u201cKeep attacking, don\u2019t slow down!\u201d Nie Yan yelled.The team had been taken aback and confused by the sudden burst of light. However, they soon regained their wits when they realized Nie Yan was the one who caused it. The enemy was completely blinded and helpless to retaliate, so they were able to freely let loose an even more ferocious barrage of magic and attacks at the Elite Manticore.After a final round of spells, the Elite Manticore uttered one last, mournful roar before collapsing to the ground.It wasn\u2019t unreasonable to say the Elite Manticore was the most dangerous when its health fell below five percent, but due to the crowd control effects of the Flash Powder and Immobilize, it was basically rendered harmless, allowing it to be easily slain.On the other hand, under normal circumstances, an encounter with an Elite Manticore definitely wouldn\u2019t have ended so pleasantly!\u201cWhat sort of item dropped?\u201d Nie Yan asked Sleepy Fox.Sleepy Fox walked over to the Elite Manticore\u2019s corpse and picked up the dropped item. It was a Thief\u2019s dagger, and not only that, it was Dark Gold-grade as well.Blood Pact (Dark Gold)Requirements: Level 0Properties: Attack 23\u201326, Dexterity +11, Critical +12, Lifesteal 3%Attack Speed: 2.3Weight: 3 lbRestrictions: Thief, can be equipped by all factions.\u201cIt\u2019s a Thief\u2019s dagger!\u201d Sleepy Fox shared the dagger\u2019s information with Nie Yan.As soon as the information window popped up, Nie Yan examined the dagger. Its properties weren\u2019t bad for a Level 0 weapon, and the attack was only slightly lower than his Level 5 Gold dagger, Assassin\u2019s Decree. Furthermore, the additional lifesteal and critical rate placed it a bit higher than Assassin\u2019s Decree overall and much higher than his Horn Dagger!I can finally switch out my dagger!This Blood Pact that they found in Agmota Muddy Wetlands on Specialist was probably one of the best Level 0 daggers possible.\u201cI want this dagger,\u201d said Nie Yan as he stared at Sleepy Fox.When such an amazing dagger appeared, all of the Thieves in the team gazed at it covetously. Of course, from the moment Nie Yan opened his mouth, they knew it would be impossible for them to obtain it, but speaking truthfully, this wasn\u2019t all too surprising. There was no way Nie Yan would be willing to pass on a weapon like Blood Pact.Sleepy Fox didn\u2019t bicker and willingly handed Blood Pact over. After all, Nie Yan had been the one guiding them through this Specialist dungeon this whole time. If it weren\u2019t for him, they would have never been able to reach this point. Yet, besides a pair of leg guards, Nie Yan had never taken anything else up until now, which left Sleepy Fox feeling slightly embarrassed. Taking all this into consideration, naturally, this Dark Gold dagger would go to Nie Yan.Upon receiving the item, Nie Yan promptly replaced the Horn Dagger in his hand with Blood Pact which in turn improved his damage significantly. Furthermore, he estimated that he would be able to farm the complete Black Blood set in the next few days. When that time came around, his gear would be upgraded another level.By utilizing the same tactic, Nie Yan lured the other two Elite Manticores to the team one after another where they were swiftly dealt with. Two decent pieces of equipment dropped from their corpses as well. However, Nie Yan voluntarily passed on them since they weren\u2019t Thief items.\u201cOh right! What were those pouches you threw at the Elite Manticore\u2019s eyes?\u201d Sleepy Fox couldn\u2019t hold back his curiosity any longer and finally asked.This question also prompted Dusk, Flying Stone, and the rest of the team members to turn their attention to Nie Yan as well. That strange pouch really was a useful item. Blinding an enemy in the middle of combat could achieve amazing results, especially during crucial moments.\u201cFlash Powder, it\u2019s a special item, but it\u2019s only effective against enemies Level 10 or lower.\u201d\u201cDo you have anymore remaining?\u201d\u201cIn fact, I actually do, but I only have nine pouches left,\u201d Nie Yan replied after pondering for a brief moment. Since Sleepy Fox and his team had already seen the item, he felt there was no harm in revealing it to them.\u201cIs this item really rare? I\u2019ll buy two pouches for a silver each. How does that sound?\u201d Sleepy Fox offered. Whether it was used against other players or against monsters, this queer item would likely show surprisingly good results. Hence, even if he bought them for a silver each, he still didn\u2019t consider it very expensive.Nie Yan\u2019s eyes brightened after hearing these words. Given that Sleepy Fox was really willing to purchase the Flash Powder for one silver per pouch, then it was certain even more players would be willing to pay a high price as well. Trembling Milo was a hidden NPC, and at present, no other players had yet to discover him. If he were to return to the shop and purchase a large quantity of Flash Powder, Web Scrolls, and Sheep Transformation Scrolls and then sell them on the marketplace, he would undoubtedly earn a fortune!At least until the average player base surpassed Level 10, items like the ones found in Trembling Milo\u2019s House would all be extremely useful.\u201cHow about we put this off until later? Let\u2019s clear the dungeon first,\u201d Nie Yan replied. Once they were out of the dungeon, he could list some of these items for sale and observe how the market would react.\u201cAlright, if you have any extra in storage, please sell a bit more to me,\u201d Sleepy Fox said. For a guild as large as his, spending a few silvers wasn\u2019t really a problem. Besides, after witnessing Flash Powder\u2019s effects in person, he really wanted to get his hands on some for himself.Now the only monster that remained was the boss. Whether they cleared the quest, which involved saving the mayor, would also be determined by the outcome of this final battle.Calling this King Manticore much stronger than its Easy and Normal counterparts would be a gross understatement. So as the team prepared to face off against this behemoth of a boss, many of the members, as well as Sleepy Fox, were filled with fear and apprehension.This would be their first encounter with a Lord-class monster that was actually within their level range!With this thought running through their minds, the surrounding team members were all somewhat tense. Although they had been able to miraculously reach this point due to Nie Yan\u2019s leadership, when facing against absolute strength, they couldn\u2019t help but feel a sense of dread.\u201cPaladins, be ready to cast Repel Evil once the duration times out. Priests, constantly take note of Violent Waves\u2019 health while managing your mana properly as well. When facing the King Manticore, there are certain to be casualties. Other players can die, but the only member on this team who absolutely cannot die is Violent Waves! If he ends up dead, the entire team will also end up wiping. Therefore, I want the Priests to only focus their healing on Violent Waves. Other frontliners, if your health gets low, immediately disengage from the battle because no Priests will be able to heal you. You\u2019re only going to be able to heal yourselves once you\u2019re out of combat. Shadow Priest, hold onto your Immobilize. I\u2019ll tell you to cast it when the time arrives.\u201d Having reached this point, Nie Yan began gradually informing everyone of their individual roles in the battle.All of the team members committed their full attention, not daring to overlook even a single detail.\u201cAs for the minor things, I\u2019ve explained those as well. In the end, the King Manticore is simply like that, so there\u2019s nothing for you all to get so nervous over,\u201d Nie Yan said in a casual tone.After hearing such a statement, Sleepy Fox, Dusk, Flying Stone, and all the other team members looked at each other and forced out a smile. Perhaps the only player in the game who could utter such words was Nie Yan. One had to know, the boss in front of them was a genuine Lord-class monster!62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 - Adapting to Unforeseen CircumstancesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 100 \u2013 Adapting to Unforeseen CircumstancesNie Yan scanned his surroundings. Eventually, his eyes came across a nearby area that was flourishing with shrubbery, a place most suitable for facing the King Manticore. As such, he ordered the members of his team to set up their formation over there.\u201cEveryone ready? If so, then I\u2019m going to pull,\u201d asked Nie Yan as he turned to face his team.\u201cWe\u2019re good to go.\u201dNie Yan raised his Crossbow of Blood and took aim at the King Manticore.\u300cWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! \u300dThree bolts flew through the air and directly struck the boss.The King Manticore discovered Nie Yan nigh instantly and pounced toward him with incredible speed.Seeing this, Nie Yan hastily dashed toward the location of his team, continuously firing off his crossbow as he fled.\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd42 \ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd37\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd43\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd41 \ud83c\udd44\ud83c\udd3f\ud83c\udd3b\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd33 \ud83c\udd35\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd41\ud83c\udd42\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd30\ud83c\udd43 \ud83c\udd3d\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd45\ud83c\udd34\ud83c\udd3b-\ud83c\udd31\ud83c\udd38\ud83c\udd3d.\ud83c\udd32\ud83c\udd3e\ud83c\udd3cThe King Manticore increased its speed, steadily closing the gap between it and Nie Yan.Nie Yan only needed to take a single glance at the fearsome beast pursuing him from behind to understand that whoever was unlucky enough to suffer one of its attacks would undoubtedly die. Even Violent Waves wouldn\u2019t be able to endure repeated strikes from the King Manticore. If it could build up enough momentum during its charge, then even a Fighter with five hundred health and a hundred and fifty defense would be easily dispatched with a single swipe of its paw.Violent Waves hadn\u2019t the slightest idea of just how dangerous the King Manticore was right now. He raised his shield and came forward with the intent of intercepting the beast after Nie Yan passed by.When it was just thirty meters away, Nie Yan brought out a Sheep Transformation Scroll and bit his thumb, then used the blood to activate the magic dwelling inside.A strange magical energy spilled out of the scroll and into the surrounding area.By now, the distance between the King Manticore and Nie Yan had shortened to just twenty meters.Once the Sheep Transformation Scroll\u2019s channeling time of two seconds was up, the scroll suddenly emitted a dazzling radiance as countless magical runes flew out into the sky and began revolving in midair. Then...\u300cPoof!\u300dThe scroll exploded and vanished without a trace.As the scroll disappeared, a bright light fell down upon the King Manticore, enshrouding it. Then, all of a sudden, the gigantic beast began to shrink until it was reduced to the size of a small sheep. Realizing that the situation had changed, the King Manticore attempted to halt its charge, but the sudden change in body mass, coupled with the momentum that it had built up from its earlier charge, made it difficult. It placed its newly acquired hooves firmly on the ground and awkwardly slid forward until... \u300cPoof!\u300dThe King Manticore transformed, regaining its original appearance just two fleeting seconds after becoming a sheep.The Sheep Transformation magic inside the scroll could transform ordinary monsters into sheep for ten seconds. During this time, if the player were to attack the transformed monster, then the spell would be cancelled prematurely. However, since the King Manticore had a high resistance against transformation magic, the spell\u2019s effects would last for no more than two seconds.By the time the King Manticore had returned to its original form, its charging speed had been drastically reduced.And Nie Yan didn\u2019t plan on giving it the opportunity to build its momentum back up either as he pulled out another scroll.Web Scroll!Suddenly, a gigantic cobweb appeared out of nowhere and fell on top of the King Manticore, trapping it.The massive beast roared angrily as it thrashed about underneath the web. Though the web was quite strong, the King Manticore was even stronger, and it broke free just a moment later.Though the web didn\u2019t last long, it had still done its job by trapping the King Manticore, if even for a moment. Although it hadn\u2019t received any injuries, its previous speed had vanished without a trace.Nie Yan\u2019s two scrolls had neutralized the most crucial, most ferocious, and most powerful strike from the King Manticore and, in doing so, had averted the imminent catastrophe that was about to befall the team.At this point, the King Manticore had reached Violent Waves, who had been waiting to engage it with his shield raised. He opted to get the first strike in by fiercely bashing the beast with his shield. Immediately after, two spells, Repel Evil and Radiant Barrier, were cast on him by a Paladin and a Priest respectively.Taunt!Violent Waves quickly used the skill to draw the King Manticore\u2019s aggro onto himself.Enraged by the taunts of the pest, the King Manticore roared as it raised its giant paws and swiped at him twice.\u2212150\u2212152After seeing the damage values float above their teammate\u2019s head, the other team members suddenly realized that the King Manticore on Specialist wasn\u2019t as terrifying as they had imagined. After all, the first time they encountered the King Manticore on Easy, Violent Waves had been sent to an early grave with just its first strike. Of course, this was due to many reasons. The first being that they had allowed the King Manticore to build up enough momentum in its charge, thereby significantly increasing the destructive force of its attack. Under such circumstances, a critical strike was very likely to occur as well. The second reason was because they had never cast Repel Evil while fighting the King Manticore, a spell which was extremely effective at restraining its killing power. The third reason was because the equipment Violent Waves wore at that time wasn\u2019t nearly as good as his current gear. The fourth and final reason was that most of the team members were around Level 3, so they didn\u2019t have Radiant Barrier which could absorb some of the damage.Yet, right now, Violent Waves was able to endure the King Manticore\u2019s attacks without much difficulty even though it was a Lord-class monster. Thanks to the constant healing of the Priests, his situation was stable, at least for the moment.At this very moment, Sleepy Fox had an epiphany. It was only now that he realized why Nie Yan had used the Sheep Transformation Scroll and the Web Scroll earlier. The actions which seemed silly and pointless actually had an underlying meaning. It was all for the sake of dispelling the team\u2019s fears which had been left behind from their previous encounters. Only, Nie Yan never said it outright.Perhaps the Lord-class King Manticore really isn\u2019t as terrifying as we imagined, Sleepy Fox thought as he stared at Nie Yan\u2019s back. If they had a Thief in their team as capable as Nie Yan, then any dungeon would become easy.Spells arced through the air and battered the King Manticore\u2019s body as they lit up the sky like a brilliant display of fireworks.Meanwhile, Nie Yan circled behind the King Manticore and unleashed a flurry of attacks, each hit dealing at least seventy to eighty damage. Out of all the frontliners currently fighting alongside him, not a single one was able to match his damage. Those Fighters, Berserkers, and Paladins would only deal forty to fifty damage at most.It didn\u2019t come as much of a surprise to him though. After all, not only were his equipment and weapons decent, but his stats were also greatly bolstered thanks to the Chapter of Courage. Not to mention, Thieves already possessed innately high attack speed. This, when paired with the fact that he also gained an additional thirty percent attack when striking an enemy from behind, was probably why he had the highest damage output among all the frontliners. It was even higher than some of the Mages in the rear.As it suffered the team\u2019s fierce assault, the King Manticore\u2019s health gradually fell lower and lower.80%... 70%... 60%...Due to his ridiculous damage, the King Manticore suddenly showed signs of aggroing onto him, so Nie Yan immediately stopped his attacks and retreated.Demoralizing Shout!MISS!The King Manticore had the potential to ignore a Fighter\u2019s Demoralizing Shout. And of course, exactly at this moment, it had ignored Violent Waves\u2019 Demoralizing Shout.Violent Waves cried out in alarm. If he couldn\u2019t keep its aggro, the consequences would be absolutely disastrous.Before Violent Waves could get in another attack to pull back its aggro, the King Manticore abruptly switched targets and knocked down the nearby Warrior and Thief. It raised its sharp claws and swiped down with a trail light following behind the attack. A Thief and Berserker were instantly killed by the attack and sent to the graveyard. At the same time, it attacked another Fighter, who, after receiving the attack, was only left with a sliver of health as he hurriedly retreated.Violent Waves finally intervened and struck the King Manticore with Assault followed by Heroic Strike.Heroic Strike was the most common offensive skill used by Fighters. Its damage was average, but it also had the effect of generating additional aggro.Despite being hit by Violent Waves\u2019 Heroic Strike, the King Manticore still seemed unwilling to pay attention to this hard-to-chew bone of a player and began pursuing Nie Yan instead.Out of all the bugs it had to deal with, Nie Yan\u2019s attacks were the most painful, and he also dealt the highest damage. So once the King Manticore saw Nie Yan was nearby, it immediately pounced toward him.In response to the King Manticore charging toward him, Nie Yan retrieved a pouch of Flash Powder and lobbed it at the King Manticore.\u300cPoof!\u300dThe glittering white powder scattered in the air and released a radiance so intense it almost burned and blinded the King Manticore\u2019s eyes. After being struck the by the Flash Powder, the King Manticore thrashed about on the ground.Nie Yan seized this brief opening and quickly retreated several steps. Then, he took out a Web Scroll and activated it, trapping the King Manticore long enough for Violent Waves to arrive, who struck it several times with his shield and then subsequently used Taunt.Throughout this string of events, the Mages in the team had adjusted their positions, but even then, they never stopped firing spells. Magic constantly bombarded the King Manticore without end.Similar to how Sheep Transformation and Web\u2019s effects were reduced by its magic resistance, the King Manticore was merely affected for a short while. When it regained its vision, its attention was once again on the closest enemy to it, Violent Waves.Nie Yan\u2019s response to such an unforeseen event could be considered satisfactory.62d67767f92eb560e77c9100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
