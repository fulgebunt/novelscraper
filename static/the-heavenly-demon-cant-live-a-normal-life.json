    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1 - Dmitry\u2019s Fool (1)Hans, a servant of Baron Dmitry's family, could not hide his difficulties with the young master's abnormal behavior.\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying that I am the eldest son of the Dmitry family?\u201d\u201cAnd this is the kingdom of Cairo on the Salamander Continent. The world of Murim doesn\u2019t even exist.\u201dIt was strange.The young master wasn't someone who was usually called smart, but he wasn\u2019t normally this stupid.Hans wondered if he was high on drugs.Recently, the deviance of the children of noble families has become a social issue, but it was a problem since it would be suspicious if it happened to Young Master Roman Dmitry.Dmitry's Fool.While the younger brothers had already moved to the capital and grew up steadily, he could see the reality of Roman Dmitry just by watching him rot in the outskirts by the time he reached the age of 25.Hans said calmly, \"Young master, today is the day the esteemed daughter of the Lawrence family, who is promised to marry you, visits the estate of Dmitry. As you may have heard, the daughter of the Lawrence family is a person who values dignity and courtesy as a nobleman. So, it is better to prepare ahead of time. It's the first time you will see each other, so it would be great to make a good impression\u2014\u201d\u201cThere is something more important than that.\u201dRoman cut him off while he was talking.No matter how he looked at it, the young master, who seemed to not be in his right mind, spoke in a voice that had a different weight to it than usual.\u201cTake me to the eldest man here. It is more important for me to meet him and get to know the world in which I will be living in the future, than to meet this esteemed daughter, whom I do not know.\u201dIt was bizarre.The young master, who has lived in Dmitry's estate for 25 years, said it's important to know about the world for the future.But what can I even do?\u201cI understand, young master.\u201dIt was Hans' role to fulfill his duty as a servant.The place Hans guided Dmitry to was a village outside the Dmitry Castle.After the war, many of their permanent residents lost their homes; however, the castle could not accommodate all of them, so they formed a village outside of it.At first, the village was made up of houses with quite plausible shapes, but the proportion of shacks gradually increased as they moved inside.Splash.Hans frowned as he stepped on the muddy water.At the stench creeping up from all directions, he glanced at Roman's eyes.\u201cDo you really want to meet the oldest man in Dmitry's estate? If it's related to the history of the territory you're talking about, it's better to use Dmitry's sage or the library. We can still head back.\u201d\"It\u2019s fine.\"Roman didn't care about what was in his surroundings.Like Hans, he stepped into the muddy water without hesitation, and the hem of his pants got wet in the splashing water.\u2018Oh, his pants got wet.\u2019Hans was perplexed.Of course, he expected Roman with wet pants to make a fuss, but Roman did not show any particular reaction.It was a situation that Hans could not understand at all.The Dmitry family was not very prestigious. Still, Roman was a person who was usually quite boasting about the fact that he was the son of a noble family.The residents often gathered to gossip about the fact that Roman was a nobleman who threw fits wherever he went and had absolutely no talent.But to see something like this.He questioned whether he was the same person who said that he did not want to leave the castle even if he died despite the lord's orders.\u2018...Did he get a head injury?\u2019As he walked frantically, he arrived at his destination.He stopped in front of the shack that was slowly being demolished, and Hans looked at Roman cautiously.\u201cIt\u2019s here. He is an old man who followed the lord even before he was granted the Dmitry estate and worked as a blacksmith. He's already ninety years old, so it won\u2019t be surprising if he dies anytime soon. The problem is\u2026 he\u2019s a bit immobile, so you will have to go inside to talk to him.\u201dSlowly, he looked around.The stench was so extreme that his nose was clogged, and the spider webs formed throughout the shack made the people, who were looking, frown.This was no place for the children of noble families to enter.So, Hans kept requesting him to head back on the way, but Roman kept moving on despite his words.\u201cWait outside.\u201d\"Gasp.\"There was no hesitation to be found.Reaching out his hand and clearing the web, Roman went inside and checked his surroundings.\u201cAre you the owner of this house?\u201d\u201cYoung master, you came to such a shabby place like this?\u201dThe old man lying inside was startled.He hurriedly got over the bulky blanket and tried to get up, but he couldn\u2019t get up entirely because of an injury.\u201cSit down and listen.\u201dRoman sat down in front of him.The old man didn't know what to do as he sat down on the dirty ground, so he only looked at Roman's eyes.\u201cI want to know everything about Dmitry's estate. What kind of land is this place and what kind of history does it have? It's probably going to be a long story, so why don't we talk slowly while enjoying the alcohol I brought?\"Swish.Roman showed a bottle of wine hanging from his waist.Seeing the stunned old man with wide-open eyes, Roman made a smile that melted away his vigilance.\"Quickly.\"At the rock bottom of life.Roman chose to adapt to this world in his own way.At first, the old man could not speak properly.However, as he was getting tipsy and Roman showed a serious listening attitude, his vigilance was gone.\u201cLord Dmitry was originally a famous blacksmith. He was running a profit-making business by selling iron pieces he made himself; however, he suddenly got the opportunity to supply weapons to the kingdom of Cairo. There was a war going on for a while, so it was a great opportunity to transcend the limits of one's status. After the war, the lord who received the rank of baron at the award ceremony...\u201dThe talk was extremely long.Most of what he said was what the eldest son of the Dmitry family should know, but the unbridled old man narrated all the stories he knew at length.Roman's judgment was correct.He asked Hans what the old man liked, and he replied that he couldn\u2019t keep a secret while he was drunk, so he purposely prepared a drink to suit his taste.Thanks to him, he was able to get all the information he wanted.He, who was not yet accustomed to the person named Roman, gradually built up new information in his head.\u2018Roman huh.\u2019Roman Dmitry.No, his real name was Baek Joong-hyuk.Baek Joong-hyuk had lived most of his life as the head of the Heavenly Demon Cult, which unified Murim.He was someone who had lived a fierce life as a martial artist.Having accomplished everything he wanted to, he calmly accepted his death.It was a great blessing to conquer all the heavenly beasts1\u00a0and die, but when I opened my eyes, I was in Roman Dmitry's body.It was absurd.In fact, at the moment of his death, Baek Joong-hyuk had entered the realm of ascension2.Although divine energy enveloped his soul, Baek Joong-hyuk did not want a life where he could not live as a human being.So, he refused to climb.Most warriors ultimately want to achieve ascension, but Baek Joong-hyuk wanted to die as a human.And now, at the crossroads of new choices, Baek Joong-hyuk quickly accepted the reality he faced.\u2018Is this a gift from heaven, or is it God\u2019s punishment for refusing ascension?\u2019It didn\u2019t matter.A new life.A new environment.For Baek Joong-hyuk, that was important.His last years as the Heavenly Demon were boring, but the scenery around him gave meaning to his life.\u2018People must live with a purpose. Having accomplished everything I wanted to, I could not live like a human being even though I could do everything. Rather, it's a good thing. Roman Dmitry, the kingdom of Cairo; this world full of unknowns will be a new challenge for me.\u2019His heart raced.Baek Joong-hyuk lived a life that will remain in the history of Murim. However, looking back at it now, his life before that, when his life was at risk and fierce every day, made him live as a person rather than in his last peaceful years.He is someone who cannot live normally.That\u2019s the kind of person Baek Joong-hyuk was.\u201c\u2026This is all I know.\u201dThe talk was now over.Maybe because it had been a long time, the old man he had seen for the first time felt familiar now.\u201cThank you, it was a big help to me. We will compensate for this separately later.\u201d\u201cNo, young master. Just having a conversation with someone as precious as the young master was a great blessing for me.\u201dBaek Joong-hyuk, no, Roman laughed.It was now time to go back.But, at that moment.Bang!Thump!\u201cYou bastard!\u201dLoud noises were coming from outside.It seemed like something was going on near him.It was just as he expected.When he went out, he saw a group of men beating a boy who was not an adult yet.Bam!Bam! Bam!\u201cYou damn bastard.\u201d\u201cJust die!\u201dThe boy did not make a single sound despite the intense beating.Perhaps that fueled the men's anger even more, and the men indiscriminately beat the boy intending to kill him.The boy's body shook with each punch.The skin exposed outside his clothes was already stained red with bruises, his face was also messed up, and his nose was dripping blood.People gathered around the noisy situation.However, when they saw the fang tattoos on the men's bodies, they looked away in fear.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\"Young master!\"Roman stood next to Hans.Hans was watching the scene, and he said in a cautious voice when Roman appeared.\u201cThey seem to be a part of the Blood Fang gang. It is a usury group that is active not only in the Dmitry estate but also in the neighboring estates and seeing them do that, it seems that the boy owes a great debt to Blood Fang. You should just pretend you don't know. There is nothing good about being tangled up with them.\u201dRoman's gaze looked at the Blood Fang crew.Usury.Because of the high-interest rates, people can\u2019t pay it back, leading to violence.\u2018The problem is that the punishment is not to be carried out by the citizens of this land.\u2019This was the land of Dmitry.As explained by the old man, they were obliged to judge and solve any problem by taking it to the lord.Roman Dmitry.I still haven't quite figured out how to act as Roman.What is certain is that Roman is dead.When he woke up, the first things he found were a suicide note, believed to have been written by Roman, and drugs scattered on the floor.The contents of the will showed him how weak Roman was.The kingdom of Cairo is a kingdom that is always under the threat of war, so there is a law that requires each family to select a certain number of troops and one person to represent the family and forcibly perform their national defense duties for two years.Roman was included in it.Since it was impossible to force the two younger brothers with bright futures to death, Dmitry's Lord decided to send Roman to the battlefield.So, Roman chose his death.Trembling at all the vicious rumors about the battlefield, he chose to end his life on the day he got severely drunk.\u2018From now on, I am Roman Dmitry.\u2019The previous life was omitted.No matter what kind of life Roman has led, he will believe and follow the \u2018values of Baek Joong-hyuk\u2019 from now on.\u201cStop.\u201d\u201cYoung\u2026 young master!\u201dHans was startled at Roman's abrupt move forward and tried to stop Roman.However, it was already too late.Roman's voice was loud, and the Blood Fang gang, who had stopped beating the boy, looked at him with puzzled eyes.\u201cRoman Dmitry?\u201dIt was a sight to behold.The problem was that Roman's reputation had reached them as well.The man with a vicious face, who seemed to be the gang leader, spoke out with a smirk.\"Don't mind this, Young Master Dmitry. We will take care of this.\u201d\u201cTsk, trying to show off because he\u2019s a son of a noble.\u201d\u201cStop it, he says. Kekeke, retarded bastard.\u201dThe gang whispered from behind and laughed.Hans said in a quiet voice as the others might hear as well.\u201cYoung Master Roman, we have to return. The Blood Fang gang members are violent people. If a problem arises outside the castle, not even the Dmitry family can do anything about it. So, please calm down...\u201d\u201cHans.\u201dRoman looked at Hans.The robust and low-pitched voice immediately caught the attention of Hans, who was trembling in fear.\u201cI don\u2019t know the laws of this place very well yet. So, please explain. Who has broken Dmitry's decrees here? And for breaking the law, what kind of punishment is appropriate?\u201dHans was stunned.He felt like he was being sucked into Roman's eyes.Dmitry's Fool.The unsightly man who lived in pleasure every day caught him with a powerful force that he could not escape now.In the current situation, it was suitable to run away.However, Hans unwittingly told the 'truth.'\u201cThe boy was guilty of not paying the debt on time. It certainly deserves punishment, but the Blood Fang gang has no right to punish it directly. Above all, they dared to speak insulting words against the eldest son of the Dmitry family in Dmitry's land. It is a felony that cannot be forgiven even with their lives. According to the law, it is not at all strange that they receive the death penalty.\u201dHans bowed his head.His heart was pounding, and his legs were trembling, but now he felt like he had to reply truthfully to show respect to Roman.The onlookers held their breath, and a smirk appeared on the faces of the Blood Fang gang.Let\u2019s go with that.\u201cYou have violated Dmitry\u2019s law\u2026\u201dRoman stepped forward.While everyone was watching, he picked up a branch from the ground and pointed it like a sword at the Blood Fang gang.\u201cFrom now on, as the eldest son of the Dmitry family, I will execute the sentence for you all who have broken the law.\u201dThe Five Heavenly Beasts\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fAscension refers to becoming immortal, allowing one to continue living in the afterlife.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2 - Dmitry\u2019s Fool (2)The Blood Fang gang looked at each other with bewildered expressions.In particular, the man with a ferocious face, who seemed to be the captain, looked around to see if there were any unknown variables.\u2018Why the hell is the young master acting so unruly?\u2019There was nobody around.The general population had already retreated. Not even any enlisted soldiers of Dmitry were visible, and the surroundings had become utterly empty.There were only two people facing the Blood Fang gang.Only Roman Dmitry and his servant, Hans.\"Young master, I understand that you are a child of aristocrats who does not know much about the world, but it will be a problem to show such a disrespectful attitude towards others outside the castle and even more towards us, who have fang tattoos. In this low life, protecting your pride is what puts food on the table. So, if we just step down, we will lose face as the members of the Blood Fang, even if the opponent is the son of the Dmitry family.\u201dSlide.All the gang members behind him pulled out their weapons.Showing their fierce eyes, they had the will to attack immediately when the commander's command was given.Roman laughed.\u201cThis makes me sure.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cYou guys are literally trash. If you treat this land\u2019s owner like this, I don\u2019t even have to find out how you treat the others.\u201d\"Trash?\u00a0This son of a\u2014huh?!\"The captain couldn't even swear.The moment the captain\u2019s face turned red at his remarks, his pupils widened at the sudden change in the appearance of Roman.\u201cAttack him!\u201d\"Haaaa!\"The Blood Fang gang members rushed in all at once.With the dagger he held in his hand, the captain also attacked Roman's vital points without hesitation, but he dodged the attacks with a hair\u2019s breadth.His black hair blew beautifully in the wind. Roman's sharp eyes met the captain\u2019s.At that moment.Thud!\u201cKeuk, Kugh.\u201dThe captain, whose neck had been pierced by a branch, tried to stop the leaking blood.The situation happened so quickly.The Blood Fang gang members attacked Roman in desperation.At the attack of nearly ten men, Hans stomped his feet fast, hurriedly grabbed a large stone around him, and tried to help Roman.Surprisingly, he soon realized he didn't need to.Roman, who had dealt with the captain, was able to dodge all of his men's attacks with a movement that almost seemed inhuman and finally dealt with them one by one.It was curious enough to see him fight a dagger with a branch, and every time he attacked with the branch, a hole was punctured in the vital points of one of the men.\u201cHe\u2019s a monster, a monster\u2026!\u201d\u201cIs this really Roman Dmitry?\u201dThe men were perplexed.At first, they risked their lives to fight, but they were terrified when they saw their comrades dying helplessly.However, the tides of the fight had already turned.The men fell one after the other.When the last remaining man was about to run away, Roman's tough hand grabbed the man's hair.Grasp!\u201cAhhh, let go, let it go!\u201dThe man was furious.At the sight of his colleagues\u2019 unconscious bodies scattered around him, his face became pale and tired.Roman said, \u201cYou have violated Dmitry\u2019s law. However, you tried to cover up the situation by threatening me instead of reflecting on it. In order for an organization to carry on in the right manner, it is necessary to abide by the law. I will not take your life, but I will show people the fear of the law by setting you as an example of what they shouldn't become.\u201dA man who was called the Heavenly Demon.In Murim, Roman was the law.As a lifelong leader, Roman knew what choices he had to make for the law, even if he was cruel.Shove.\u201cUgh.\u201dHe knelt the man down.Then he tilted his head back, and with his other hand, he pulled his tongue out.\u201cThe sin of playing with the tongue in the wrong way. Pay the price accordingly.\u201d\"Euu\u2026 euuuu, euuuuk!\u201dThe man struggled desperately.However, there was no way he could escape.Roman's tough hand strongly suppressed the man's body, and Roman grabbed the dagger that had fallen on the floor and cut off the man's tongue. His blood splattered. The man groaned, and his voice roaring in pain echoed around him. The villagers tightly closed their eyes at the brutal scene. However, Roman had already cut off the man's tongue neatly without the slightest change in expression.Thud.The cut-off tongue fell to the ground.The man lowered his head.He wept with a bewildered look on his face, and his palms struggled to stop the gushing of blood from his mouth.\u201cMy name is Roman Dmitry. If you don't like the punishment you\u2019ve been given, you may come to me at any time.\"The Heavenly Demon Cult.In the world of the survival of the fittest, the price of breaking the law was always paid with blood.Roman looked at Hans.When Hans saw the young master's changed appearance for the first time, he was startled and stepped backward.\u201cCall the guards. Report today's events to them, and send troops here to do a follow-up.\"\u201cAh, I see\u2026\u00a0Gulp, it\u2019s disgusting.\u201dHans hiccuped.He checked their corpses once and hurried to the castle with a pale expression on his face.An overwhelming victory.However, Roman's expression was not good.\u2018You have such a garbage body.\u2019Roman.No, Baek Joong-hyuk.In Murim, he was the one who reached the top.Hundreds and thousands of warriors were slaughtered because they could not handle one Baek Joong-hyuk, and when the blood flowed as large and wide as a river, the Heavenly Demon Cult admitted that he was the ruler of Murim.As a man with the spirit of Baek Joong-hyuk, he could not help but be dissatisfied.'The flow of energy is messed up. The amount of qi he has in his body is so small.\u2019It was the worst.Still, there were traces of training in martial arts, but it was close to someone who had no training in Baek Joong-hyuk\u2019s expectations.\u2018I have to start over with my body every now and then. Fortunately, I have past experiences of honing my martial arts skills as Baek Joong-hyuk. If I set the right direction from the start and practice martial arts, I can get meaningful results even in the worst conditions.\u2019He had various thoughts in my mind.First of all, it was necessary to quickly gather information and proceed with the metamorphosis of the bones to create the basis of the body.It was then.\u201cYoung master, thank you very much for your help.\u201dHe was the boy who had been beaten earlier.He bowed his head and showed manners while limping his legs, perhaps because of his lack of mobility.A pitiful sight.Nevertheless, Roman's voice was cold.\u201cI didn\u2019t help you out of pity. I executed the Blood Fang\u2019s punishment because they broke Dmitry's laws, and you can't escape that responsibility either. So, explain your situation without the slightest lie. If your words are judged to be false, even your tongue will not be safe.\u201d\u201c\u2026I understand, young master.\"The boy's expression calmed down.He was quite determined.It was impressive that he did not shed a single sound even when beaten, but it certainly looked unusual.\u201cAs you know, Blood Fang is a group that lends money with high-interest rates. My parents borrowed money from Blood Fang to rent the land; if the crops were harvested normally, the money could be fully repaid. However, due to the intentional interference of the Blood Fang, the crops were ruined. At first, I didn't know why they did this, but I later found out that they did it because they coveted my sister. Young master, I feel sad. Although we don\u2019t have a lot of money, we don\u2019t do any harm to others. There is no lie in my words. Please save us from the abyss of this evil.\u201dThe boy bowed his head.The words were coherent, and there was not even a slight tremor in the boy's voice announcing the situation.Roman responded with interest.His face was black and skinny, without muscles, but the boy's eyes showed a sense of brilliance.'I found the Crazy Demon, one of the Four Heavenly Kings1, in such a shabby environment. At that time, he was just a little boy, but later, he grew up and became a stronger ally than anyone else. It's kind of like I\u2019m seeing him again.'\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s Kevin.\u201d\u201cKevin, hmm. I will remember your name and within a few days, I will make sure this case is handled through the right process.\u201d\"Gasp! Thank you! Thank you so much!\"The boy named Kevin expressed his gratitude several times.Roman grinned.A new life.A new relationship.Already, his heart was beating excitedly.After sorting out the situation, Roman put on a robe with the help of Hans.Soon, it was time for Lawrence's daughter to arrive.She was a typical aristocratic young girl, and he couldn't meet her wearing clothes stained with blood and filthy muddy water.And in the process of changing clothes, he could hear the story of the two families' engagement through Hans.\u201cTo be honest, this marriage is an arranged marriage in which mutual interests are met. The Lawrence family has recently waged several wars due to strife with neighboring estates, and their financial situation has become very poor. So, to solve the financial problem, they proposed an arranged marriage to the Dmitry family. The good news is that the young master actively supported this marriage. The young girl of the Lawrence family had a good reputation as a beautiful woman in the vicinity, so the young master saw her and fell in love at first sight.\u201dIt looked like a painting.The two houses, Lawrence and Dmitry.Lawrence needed money, and Dmitry needed the background to establish himself as a particular aristocratic family.It was a mutually beneficial transaction.The only problem was that Lawrence wanted the second son of the Dmitry family, but Roman Dmitry actively expressed his intention to marry, and the two set to be married.And today was the day the two would meet for the first time.Roman had only seen Lawrence's daughter from afar at an aristocratic party, so the two never met and talked in person.\u2018Marriage huh.\u2019In fact, it was something that Roman did not even want to do.He allowed himself to go with the flow because of the reality he had faced; however, he was already willing to overthrow this marriage.\u2018Marriage is something that happens when both have feelings of love for each other. In the process of forming a lifelong relationship, conditional issues such as family background are not important. I'll have to look for an opportunity and find a way to break this marriage.'The esteemed daughter\u2019s beauty and her background.Neither of them mattered to Roman.Surprisingly, the problem was quickly resolved.That afternoon, as scheduled, Viscount Lawrence's daughter visited Dmitry.\u201cMy name is Flora Lawrence.\u201dAs rumored, she was a beautiful woman.The blonde hair that had grown down to her waist was luxurious enough to arouse admiration from the viewers, and nothing was lacking in her features.A typical beauty. In particular, the clear and calm eyes, like a lake, made me feel like I was being sucked in as soon as I saw them.He seemed to understand why Roman Dmitry wanted to marry her.She was already a woman of considerable value with just her appearance alone.Flora asked to walk separately.Then, as she reached a quiet space where no one was watching, her face turned cold.And she said, \u201cI wish that our marriage doesn\u2019t happen.\u201dBreaking the engagement.That was the reason Flora Lawrence had visited the Dmitry estate.They were the most loyal and strongest allies of the Heavenly Demon.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 - Dmitry\u2019s Fool (3)About a month ago, Lawrence and Dmitry both talked about getting married.Flora's father, Viscount Lawrence, sat Flora in front of him and said with a troubled look on his face.\u201cMy wise daughter, I don't think it's necessary for me to explain how bad the land\u2019s situation is right now to you. We need strength now. It could be financial power, and it would be even better if it were military forces. What is certain now is that in order to receive a force sufficient to solve our difficulties, the Lawrence family's treasure, you, must be presented for the arranged marriage. I am so sorry. Because of this ugly father, you have to endure such a choice.\u201dOn that day, Flora's world collapsed.Although most noble daughters are sold in arranged marriages, Flora still had her own values. Forging her lifelong bond with the person she truly loves. She believed that even if the person was not a prince on a white horse, conditional problems could be overcome if there was love between them.But to think it would be Dmitry!This was out of the blue.\u2018Twenty years ago, the Dmitry family was an ordinary commoner\u2019s family. I was not expecting a prince on a white horse but to have to make a lifelong bond with Dmitry, who is infested with workers in the mines.\u2019It is said that the conditional issue is not very important, but that is acceptable when I actually love the other person.No matter how hard I think about it, I don\u2019t love Dmitry. I don\u2019t want to dedicate my dream of marriage, which I always had, to Dmitry's miner like this.The problem wasn't just that.At first, she tried to marry Dmitry's second son, who had a promising future, but at some point, the subject of marriage changed to Dmitry's eldest son.I've heard rumors about him. What a lousy person he is; even my father knows that Roman Dmitry is called Dmitry's Fool.\u2018I really hate it.\u2019It was terrible.Dmitry's Fool.This person has the rumor that he is confined to the territory of the outskirts and immersed in enjoyment without even dreaming of entering the capital until his mid-twenties because he lacks talent in both martial arts and cunningness.At a noble party which was held a while ago, I had heard that he wasn\u2019t even good-looking.In my mind, there wasn't even the slightest bit of intention of marrying Roman Dmitry or loving him.So, I was worried.Flora had been living a good life as a wise daughter, but this was an area she could never compromise on.\u2018This cannot be real.\u2019The land\u2019s situation?Of course, I know it well.But even so, I don\u2019t want to be sold to Dmitry's Fool.She wasn't as wise and devoted daughter as her father thought she might have been, and she decided to leave the situation to the heavens after breaking her engagement.Although the purpose of the visit to Dmitry is to meet and spend time with the target of the marriage, which was arranged in advance without her permission, her actual purpose is to inform him of breaking the engagement.That's how she met Roman Dmitry.And she was sure.'As the rumors say, he's unattractive.'His height seemed to be around 170cm.The impression from his dark hair was sharp and manly, but his charisma eroded as his skin was not in great condition.Above all else, there was a strong scent of perfume coming from Roman.Nobles originally liked to use perfume, but right now, Roman had clearly used too much of it.Flora was unaware of the fact that it was Roman's consideration to get rid of the smell of blood; she thought that Roman, who was immersed in pleasure as rumored, had been buried with the scent of a woman.The more she saw him, the more certain she became.Flora said firmly, \u201cI wish that our marriage doesn\u2019t happen.\u201dRight, he will probably object.As a person who actively argued for an arranged marriage for her beauty, it would take considerable effort to convince him otherwise.Flora clenched her little fist.No matter how Roman Dmitry reacted, she would give her all to persuade him to end this marriage.However.\u201cYes, let\u2019s do that.\u201dRoman's answer was completely unexpected.At the unexpected answer, Flora's eyes widened.\u201c\u2026Are you really fine with breaking up the marriage?\u201dFlora's voice trembled slightly.She tried to manage her expression somehow, but her overall awkward expression showed a sign of embarrassment.\u201cI am a human too, so I am well aware of what others are saying about this marriage. You are called Lawrence's flower, the beauty that every man wants, but I, who is called Dmitry's Fool, am too lacking to embrace you. So, I thought about it a lot. I pondered every night whether this marriage was the right thing to do, but in fact, our families had already made the decision, so there was no way for me to stop the marriage with just my own opinion. However, that\u2019s not the case now. Now that I know what you think, I must go forward with my decision as well.\u201dRoman was glad.In fact, from the moment he heard the word breakup, Roman thought that things were going according to his intentions.Flora Lawrence.She was, as rumored, a beautiful woman.However, for Roman, the criterion for judging a woman is not limited just to her appearance.When he was living as Baek Joong-hyuk, the number of women who would dedicate their whole bodies and mind to him was large enough to cover The Great Sea.The Murim world\u2019s apex and his handsome appearance. Along with that, because of Baek Joong-hyuk's humane attitude towards people, women tried to win over Baek Joong-hyuk by any means and methods.Of course, there were also conspiracies from hostile forces in the process.Baek Joong-hyuk, who had to think a lot when meeting people, naturally put the value of their appearance in the background.She\u2019s beautiful, of course.However, that is all.Roman is now in the midst of designing a new life, and he has no intention of carrying the burden known as Flora Lawrence.Flora asked, \u201cAre you really serious?\u201d\u201cWhy would I lie?\u201d\u201cHowever, isn\u2019t this marriage happening because you wished for it? Originally, I was in a situation where I was getting married to the second son of the Dmitry family, and I heard that you strongly wanted to marry me, so the situation ended up like this. And now you\u2019re telling me that you're going to accept the divorce without any conditions? It just doesn't make any sense to me.\u201dPfft.Roman laughed.She was truly a strange woman.In the spirit of persuading him by any means, she asked for the breakup, and when he readily accepted it, she became rather curious.\u201cSo, do you want to marry me?\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s not it.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s not do something that makes each other tired for nothing. I respect your opinion and plan to break up the marriage because we both agreed. Also, I will take full responsibility for the breaking of the engagement. I'm called Dmitry's Fool anyway; even if I get another title as a man who broke his engagement, there won't be any big problems, but it\u2019s surely different for the flower of Lawrence, who has a bright future, isn\u2019t it? If you were to be the reason for the breaking of the engagement, rumors would be everywhere. I think this should be a satisfactory answer.\u201dHonestly, there was no consideration for Flora.A man who broke his engagement.That title will be a good excuse to cut off the troublesome conversation that I might get into in the future.It was entirely for his own sake, but Flora had to take it differently as she didn't know the truth.\u2018What the hell is this man?\u2019Flora's eyes fluttered wildly.She was embarrassed.According to rumors, Roman\u2019s insides are as ugly as his looks, but the more you look at Roman's words and deeds, the more I realize it doesn't match Dmitry's nickname of a fool.One's own clear subjectivity and the ability to act on it. A person who meets at least these conditions cannot be small enough to be called an idiot wherever he goes.Her mind was intricately intertwined.However, the water has already been spilled, and the breakup has already become a reality.\u201cThe more important the task, the better it is to be dealt with quickly. So, drink some tea and wait. I will go speak to my father about this matter.\u201dShe couldn't hold Roman back any longer.Seeing Roman walking away so casually, Flora looked at his back with a confused look for a while.Slam!\"What do you mean?! Breaking off the engagement?!\u201dThe reaction was as Roman had expected.The moment he mentioned the word of breaking off the engagement, Baron Romero, the lord of Dmitry, could not hide his exploding anger.\u201cIt is just as I said. I don\u2019t want to do this marriage. Since I have already finished talking to Lawrence\u2019s esteemed daughter, I don\u2019t think we can reverse this decision.\u201d\u201cThis, this\u2026!\u201dBaron Romero's face flushed red.This was a notice.Rather than asking for permission to make a choice, Roman had already made a decision and informed him about it unilaterally.\u201cWhat a stupid bastard! Even if people called you Dmitry's Fool, I tried to pass on a good environment to you as a father's duty. You are different from my other children. They enjoyed wealth and honor as children of the aristocracy from the moment they were born, but you and I experienced the days of commoners together. So, I still accepted you even if you acted like a fool. Since your environment had changed suddenly, you must have wanted to do things you dreamed of ever since you were a child.\u201dHis beard was trembling.It was just as Baron Romero had said.Baron Romero had an only son, Roman, when he got the opportunity to supply weapons to Cairo.A child who was a commoner became the son of a nobleman.Roman's childhood went like this.As the children who looked down on him scratched his head, Roman's personality worsened.And now, Roman had become Dmitry's embarrassment.It symbolizes that Dmitry was a commoner, and that's why he doesn't want to show it to others.\u201cThe union with the House of Lawrence is a very important matter for Dmitry to fully establish himself as a nobleman. Did I expect a big role from you? All you have to do is marry the pretty noble young girl you so desperately wanted, and you can't even do that.\"\"I\u2019m sorry.\"\u201cThis is not a matter of apologies!\u201dSmack!Baron Romero threw an object he could get his hands on at Roman.A strong shock hit Roman's head, but Roman calmly bowed his head despite the blood dripping from his head.This is a matter of responsibility.He broke his promise, so it is right to accept the price for it.\u201cIf all goes well, I was trying to somehow solve the problem of you performing your national defense duties. But now, things have become messed up, so you have to leave for the battlefield within the next six months. Do you have anything to say about this?\u201d\"I do not.\"\u201cAnd I heard that there was an incident with Blood Fang. Witnesses say you punished them, but I don't believe it. Well, that doesn't make sense anyway. How can a guy, who can't even wield a sword properly, punish them? I am sure someone helped you. The problem is that Blood Fang is a beehive that even I cannot touch. Son, the moment you fail to fulfill your duties as a child, you are obliged to solve your own problems. So, you have to solve this problem yourself. I am not going to give you any help on that.\u201dIt was not a rational decision.Baron Romero was furious and uttered every word that could punish Roman.Military duty and Blood Fang.They were problems that an ordinary Roman could not handle by himself.Of course, Baron Romero expected that Roman, as usual, would get down on his knees and weep for his forgiveness.\u2018If the news of the breaking of the marriage is not known externally, there is still a chance for the resolution of this issue.\u2019It was his judgment.He thought of breaking Roman's spirit completely and doing things as intended.However.\"I understand, father. I will take care of it myself.\u201d\"What?\"\u201cIt happened because of me. As father said, I think it is right for me to deal with it.\u201dBaron Romero was perplexed.An unexpected development.Roman lowered his head, stood up, and spoke one last time.\u201cThen I will solve all the problems and come back.\u201dRoman left.Baron Romero was so stunned that he couldn't even catch Roman.Roman came back outside.He wiped the blood dripping from his forehead with his sleeve, and right in front of him was a person staring at him bewilderedly.It was Flora Lawrence.She heard all the conversations from outside the room and unwittingly told him her inner feelings.\u201cAre you really crazy?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 - Dmitry\u2019s Fool (4)Loud noises were heard from inside the room.Baron Romero's wrath was expected, but the problem was that the punishment imposed on Roman was too harsh.That was why I couldn\u2019t understand Roman\u2019s actions.It would have been better for him if he had revealed that I had proposed to break up first, but Roman did not even mention Flora's name.\u201cAre you really crazy?\u201d\"I don\u2019t know. Anyway, I'll be fine.\"Roman's reaction was blunt.Even as Flora looked up at him, he only wiped the blood flowing from his head with his sleeve.The wound on his head was not severe.Baron Romero had no intention of inflicting any serious harm, and blood was only dripping from the areas where his skin had torn off.\u201cDo you know what you\u2019ve just done? It's Blood Fang, the Blood Fang. It's a group known to be atrocious in the vicinity. How are you going to solve it without the help of your family?\"Blood Fang.Their notoriety wasn\u2019t limited to Dmitry.There were many incidents in Lawrence, especially the terrorist attack on the nobles, which raised their notoriety.\u201cThe reason Blood Fang is scary is that it has nothing to lose. They never invade the nobility's realm unless they touch their rice bowls, but if they think the nobility has harmed them, they will not spare their lives and retaliate unconditionally. They're not normal. They even put magic bombs on their bodies and commit suicide attacks. Do you really think you can handle them? It's okay to just tell the truth, so go straight to Lord Baron Dmitry and get down on your knees and ask him for mercy.\"\u201cWhy do I have to do that?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018why\u2019?! There are plenty of reasons...\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a funny person.\u201dRoman sighed and laughed.Roman did not waver while looking at the eyes that seemed to melt the hearts of many men at once.\u201cI know what you mean. However, when proposing to break up the marriage, you didn't think about my circumstances at all, but when I said that I would take on all the responsibility and solve the problem myself, then you\u2019re worried. Well, that\u2019s not right, is it?. From the moment you mentioned \u2018breakup\u2019 when you first met me, you had no right to worry about my circumstances. That is the relationship between you and me.\u201dFlora.After meeting her, Roman showed respect as her fianc\u00e9e.He got rid of the smell of blood from his body, sprayed a lot of perfume on his body that was bad enough to distort his expression, and wore a robe that seemed to choke his breath.It was the least he could do to show his courtesy to her.Roman was thinking about breaking up with Flora, but he still didn't want to ruin things by hurting a woman who didn't harm him.However, Flora didn\u2019t feel the same way as him.The first day she saw me, the first words she said to me were, \u201cLet\u2019s break off our engagement.\u201dLooking at the cold expression on her face, Roman knew he didn't need her consideration.So, he easily accepted the breaking of their engagement.He said he would take full responsibility because he didn't want to be associated with Flora anymore.\u201c\u2026\u201dFlora was perplexed.This was something she had never experienced in her life.Ordinary men take her words positively, but Roman was extremely temperamental.Flora was at a loss for words.Looking down at her, Roman said coldly.\u201cWe are strangers now. So, I will take care of my own business.\u201dHe drew a line.Even though it is a flower that many men admire, its value varies from person to person.Roman looked at Flora as if she was nothing and just left his place, leaving Flora behind.All the commotion finally cleared up.Alone in the office, Baron Romero drank until the sun went down.\u201cYou are drinking too much.\u201dRihanna Dmitry.Roman\u2019s mother and Baron Romero\u2019s wife checked her surroundings and sighed softly.The place was a mess.Objects thrown by Baron Romero were scattered on the ground, and the table was full of empty wine bottles.The smell of alcohol emanating from the bottle was enough to make her face frown.Baron Romero, whose face grew red from drunkenness, looked at Rihanna with a painful expression on his face.\u201cRihanna, I used violence against Roman today. I know better than anyone how wrong that is, but when I got myself together, I saw blood running down Roman's head. Aren't I a horrible father? Using violence just because my son is not growing up the way I want him to.\u201dHe shook his head in pain.Baron Romero is not of noble origin.Born as a commoner, he had a difficult childhood, being beaten to death by his father, a blacksmith, every day.Wasn\u2019t it like that?The moment Baron Romero obtained the title of nobility, he vowed not to pass on that experience to his children.In fact, the three sons lived without knowing any difficulties.The problem was that blind love was also not the right way, and Roman, who had experienced the days of commoners together, was mistaken.A sore finger.That was Roman.Baron Romero, who had never used violence even if Roman was wrong, could not stand it this time.Rihanna walked up to Baron Romero, hugged him, and patted his head.\u201cI don't think violence is the right thing to do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when a child strays onto the wrong path, only the parent can correct it. So don't fall for the guilt. The Romero Dmitry I know is a strong man, and he's not the kind of person to sit by and watch his son go astray.\u201d\u201cI am not as great as you think. Considering that Roman said he wanted to break off the engagement immediately after Lawrence's daughter's visit, he must have received a message of breaking off the engagement from Flora. And yet, I vented my wrath on Roman. Despite knowing that there was nothing he could do about it, he chose a kind way, not blaming Lawrence.\u201d\u201cI know your heart. However, there is still a chance to set things right.\u201dRihanna.He knew what she was talking about.From the days when Baron Romero was a commoner, Rihanna always offered him a smart way.\u201c\u2026Are you talking about Blood Fang?\u201d\"Yes. Roman is a proud child. So, that child must have said that he was going to deal with Blood Fang alone. But if you leave it like this, you never know what will happen. So, you must protect Roman.\u201d\u201cYes, you are right.\u201dBaron Romero nodded his head.Blood Fang.I didn't think Roman could handle a group that was reputed to be atrocious.Since I didn't know what would happen if he picked a beehive for nothing, I needed a countermeasure for Roman's safety.Rihanna said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you call the Knights\u2019 Commander, Jonathan? Even Roman will not be able to handle the task alone, so he will surely try to convince the Knights\u2019 Commander. Then, Captain Jonathan will just pretend he can't win and deal with Roman's wishes.\"\u201cYou are right.\u201dJonathan is the leader of the Dmitry Knights and a powerful person who uses the three-star aura1.If it\u2019s him, we can trust him.Baron Romero called his servant.\u201cCall the Knights\u2019 Commander, Jonathan, right now.\u201d\"Understood, my lord.\"However, there was one thing they had overlooked.Roman Dmitry.The fact that he wasn't the same son whom they knew before.He risked his life for the words he spit, and that was the new Roman they would soon come to know.* * *A few days later, Roman left the inner city.As Hans accompanied him without any security, he followed Roman's steps, but he could not hide his worries.\"Young master, going out like this is really dangerous. The Blood Fang gang is a heinous group that has also waged terrorism against nobles. They must have been thinking of retaliating against the young master for the last incident, but what would happen if you walked the streets openly and without security? Please head back to the inner city.\u201dIt was as Hans said.In the past few days, Roman researched about the Blood Fangs and learned that they were a famous dangerous group.Roman said, \u201cAs you said, Blood Fang is a dangerous group. It\u2019s an organization whose stronghold and size of forces are unknown; people cannot help but fear them because they do not know when and where they will attempt terrorism. Nevertheless, that's it. At what point do you think this Blood Fang group gained this level of power?\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cIt started by accident. The Blood Fangs once waged wars with the usury powers that opposed them and gained notoriety by brutally killing them. That was the start. Notoriety bred fear, and they realized how efficiently they could use it to get things done.\u201dIt was a strange thought.Hans looked at Roman with an expression like he did not understand English.\u201cStill, it\u2019s dangerous, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\"It is.\"Roman sighed and laughed.That's right.Blood Fang is seriously dangerous.Notoriety swelled up, and in order to protect that notoriety, they had to do something worthy of the notoriety.Even in Murim, those with nothing to lose need to be careful, but the problem was that the current Roman was the Heavenly Demon.Heavenly Demon.The apex of his cult.What happened for something from dirty muddy water to reach the top spot?Suicide bombings?That was a typical day.There were dozens of assassins attacking him every day, and the poisonous eyes that promised to curse him to death were so many that he couldn't even remember them.Baek Joong-hyuk is a person who overcame such adversity and rose to the apex of the cult.If the opponent looked directly into his eyes, he would gouge their eyes out, and if they cursed him, he would cut off their tongue.That man is now Roman.Blood Fang's notoriety did not bring any fear to Roman.\u201cLet\u2019s go over there first.\u201d\"Huh?\"Roman stopped walking.Seeing Roman suddenly entering the restaurant, Hans followed Roman while panicking.The food came out quickly.The variety of foods that filled the table had a fragrant smell, but Roman spoke to Hans in a calm voice.\u201cI\u2019ll go out for a while. You should eat and wait here.\u201d\"What do you mean?\"Hans, who was drooling, was surprised.What do you mean go out by yourself?Doesn't that mean you want to become prey for Blood Fang?\u201cFrom now on, I have to deal with it myself. You don't have to be in danger.\"\u201cIt can never be. Even if I am in danger, I cannot send you alone.\u201dHans was adamant.At any moment, Hans was ready to run out with Roman, with a steak knife in hand.Roman let out a laugh.Hans.He was truly a good person.Leaving aside the barriers of being a master and a servant, at least he was genuinely concerned for Roman's well-being.Roman said, \u201cYou are my person. Am I right?\"\u201cOf course, I am the young master\u2019s person.\u201d\u201cThen do what you can for me. I do not wish for meaningless sacrifices. Doing what you cannot do is not for me, but for your own greed. So all you have to do is sit here and enjoy the food as I commanded you. Just coming out here with me was enough for you to fulfill your role.\u201dRoman.Living a new life, he built a fence.And, for the first time, a man named Hans was put inside it.His identity doesn't matter to him.Roman accepted Hans as his man, and from now, his life will never be taken lightly.\u201cI will be back soon.\u201dFinally, Roman got up from his seat.Hans was left alone.He repeated Roman's words with a shocked expression on his face.\u201cYou are my person.\u201dYoung Master Roman.I've never heard anything like this while serving him.Seeing him sincerely accepting him, who was only a poor man, Hans was moved without realizing it.\u201cI have to let them know about this.\u201dWe can't allow Young Master Roman to die like this.I don't know what he\u2019s thinking, but if he goes out alone, there's a good chance something will happen.Hans sprinted out of his back seat.Dmitry Knights.Now was the time to tell them that Dmitry's young master was in danger.When even Hans left the place, the food that had lost its owner grew cold.Aura is a kind of Qi used by swordsmen who have reached a certain level of swordsmanship. On the other hand, wizards usually make magic circles within their bodies and use mana to cast spells. The higher the number, the more proficient a person is in using their Qi or mana.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 - Blood Fang (1)The Outer Castle1.This is a place where ordinary citizens live.Unlike outside the castle, it was not a slum but had well-made streets, restaurants, and a plaza where people could rest.In particular, the statue of Hephaistos, located in the center of the square, was a symbol of Dmitry.\u2018It\u2019s noisy.\u2019The surroundings were noisy.A large crowd was coming and going, and it was crowded with people selling things and others trying to buy stuff from them.Roman walked down the street.Of course, there were many people who recognized Roman.Most of the people of the Dmitry family live in the inner castle, but Roman often goes out of the inner castle for entertainment and other things.While outside, it wasn\u2019t just once or twice that Roman made a scene.People whispered at Roman's appearance, but they did not walk up to him and talk to him.What? Courtesy to the lord's family?It isn\u2019t something that involves Roman.Dmitry's people respected Baron Romero but didn\u2019t respect his fool of a son the same.'Since I, Roman Dmitry, the target of revenge, am roaming the streets without a single guard, the Blood Fang should soon get to know where I am.\u2019It was the actual reason I came here.Roman had deliberately wandered the streets with Hans.It was the appearance he had deliberately shown before, but when he judged that his location had been exposed to a certain extent, he left Hans at the restaurant to be safe.Hans had done enough for his role.Hans' absence was used to make them careless and also because I had no intention of putting him in danger.\u2018If the Blood Fang is a group that attacks even nobles as the rumors say, now is the perfect opportunity for them to get revenge.\u2019Roman's outing today was no accident.After Roman was assigned by his father to take care of Blood Fang's affairs, he stayed in his room alone to get to know them well. In reality, their power was not that strong. The Dmitry Knights were enough to deal with them, but the problem was that it was impossible to eradicate the whole Blood Fang at once. So, people didn't usually touch Blood Fang. This was because if you touched them but did not deal with them properly, you would have to live with the fear of being the target of revenge for the rest of your life.An intangible force.Therefore, Roman made a plan.If you can't find them first, you just have to make them come to you.\u201cThe fish is fresh today!\u201d\u201cSouthern silk for only one gold!\u201d\u201cMove quickly, Max!\u201dIt was crowded with people.Roman walked between them, slowly calming his emotions.\u2018Today is the day the Dmitry Knights will conduct regular training. Since the number of guards has been significantly reduced compared to other times, even if something happens in the outer castle, they will not be able to respond quickly. As the Blood Fang, you wouldn\u2019t want to miss a day like this. It's not a common opportunity to see Dmitry's young master, who just goes out on a whim, wandering the streets without a guard on a day when the Dmitry Knights are training.'That\u2019s correct. It\u2019s a bait.Roman had presented himself as an attractive bait.He used this method quite frequently in Murim as well.Even the great assassins, who showed no traces, naturally turned on their eyes and rushed in when they saw loopholes.\u2018Three in the back.\u2019Slowly, he gained a tail.The people who watched from afar at first were now openly pursuing him.\u2018Now, I\u2019m tempted.\u2019Naturally.Roman turned and walked into a quiet alley.It's the direction of the entertainment district that Roman loved very much, so there was no suspicion in the eye of the pursuers.He gently waved the bait.Let them take the bait.Roman hid his true feelings and disappeared deep into the alley with a cold expression.- - -\u201cCaptain of the Knights, Jonathan! Knights\u2019 Commander, Jonathan!\u201dJonathan, who had been instructing the Knights for a long time, frowned at the sight of Hans running towards him.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cThe, the young master is haa\u2026 in\u2026 haa.\u201d\u201cSpeak slowly.\u201dHans could not speak properly as he was gasping for air.Rushing here from the outer castle made his face pale, but it was more important for Hans to warn others of the danger to Roman\u2019s life.\u201cYoung Master Roman is in danger!\u201d\u201cThe young master is?\u201d\"Yes! The young master went out to the outer castle without a single guard, and it seemed like he was trying to fight with the Blood Fang. We never know what will happen if we leave him like this. We must find the young master as soon as possible!\u201dHans's voice was very intense.It was a voice that actively appealed to how dangerous Roman\u2019s situation was, but Jonathan responded as if he was confused and had heard something absurd.\u201cI think my ears aren\u2019t working properly. Now, are you saying that Young Master Roman, who can't even use a sword, let alone aura, went out alone to the outer castle to fight Blood Fang?\"\"That\u2019s right!\"\u201cThat sounds really absurd.\u201dJonathan grinned.He has been a knight of Dmitry since Baron Romero received the Dmitry estate and has experience teaching Roman and other young masters of Dmitry. The other young masters showed excellent qualities as swordsmen. In fact, they made rapid progress and advanced to the capital, but Young Master Roman was an exception.He was weak, even among the weakest candidates.Above all else, his cowardly heart was a big problem.He sat on the floor and shivered if he saw a bit of blood, so Jonathan decided that Roman had no talent as a swordsman.His head is stupid, and he doesn't know how to use his body.The evaluation of being a fool initially originated from the Knights Templar.To say that Roman went out to fight Blood Fang, it was natural for Jonathan not to believe it.\u201cThere is no time for this! We must save the young master!\u201dHans ran wild on the road.2Jonathan didn't like it, but he couldn't ignore Hans' words.\u2018There was also a special order from the Lord.\u2019A few days ago, Baron Romero summoned Jonathan and ordered him to help Roman. Although the knights of Dmitry and Jonathan did not like Roman very much, they could not refuse the orders of the lord they followed.If what Hans said is true, the stupid fool caused a seriously huge problem this time.Why the heck is a guy who doesn't even know how to use a sword doing something like this?Jonathan cried out.\u201cRight now, all knights, go and get armed.\u201dClack. Clack.The knights were sorted in a row.Jonathan looked down at Hans with a fierce expression on his face.\u201cGuide me to where the young master is. In our land, it is unacceptable to dare to touch Dmitry's young master.\u201d- - -Step. Step.The sound of footsteps echoed through the alley.The men who quietly followed Roman's footsteps revealed their true colors as they entered the isolated space.Step. Step.\u201cThis is the Blood Fang\u2019s revenge!\u201dIt happened in an instant.A man rushed at him instantly and stabbed Roman with all his might with the dagger in his hands. A surprise attack suddenly occurred without warning. Ordinary people would have been helpless in this situation, but Roman's reaction was quick.Swish.Roman dodged to the side by a hair\u2019s breadth.Then, he grabbed his opponent's arm with his armpit and snapped it.Crack.\u201cAaaaaaaaah!\u201dThe man screamed.When he dropped the dagger in his hand due to the pain in his bizarrely broken arm, Roman caught the falling dagger and stabbed the man in his neck several times.Instantly, blood gushed out like a fountain.With a pale face, the man hurriedly tried to stop the blood from spurting from his neck, but there was nothing he could do about the blood seeping between his fingers.\u201cShit!\u201d\u201cThis son of a bitch!\u201dThe men's expressions changed.They pulled out their weapons and attacked Roman at the same time.Swish!Weapons were swung from all sides, aiming for Roman's life.The sharp blades shone brilliantly in the sunlight, but they did not achieve their purpose and only ripped through the air.The men's faces suddenly hardened.If it was the Roman they knew, it didn't make sense for him to make such moves and dodge the attacks without much effort.Smack!\u201cKeuk.\u201dRoman's kick explosively hit the man's stomach.The man tried to counterattack with a distorted expression of pain, but Roman escaped the attack range with a quick movement.Sensing his opponent's location quickly, Roman's fist pierced his face.His head spun around.Blood dripped from his mouth, and his teeth splattered on the floor like corn.Soon.\u201cKuak!\u201dAnother man's scream was heard.While the man who had been beaten could not come to his senses, the dagger that Roman threw stuck into his thigh.The men were lying on the ground.In an instant, three people were defeated.The two men, who were still alive, were startled by the sight of their dead companion with a hole in his throat.\u2018How can this be? Is this really Roman?\u2019The intel was incorrect.No, their general knowledge was wrong.As far as they knew, he was never the kind of person who could produce an outcome like this.\u201cIs it just you guys?\u201dRoman's voice was dull.Roman wiped the blood off his face as if nothing had happened, and he looked around to understand the situation.There are no other enemies.At least, Roman's senses were saying that.\u2018There is no one capable of avoiding my senses in Blood Fang.\u2019In the next few days, Roman made a leap in physical development in just a short period of time.It was impossible for ordinary Murim members, but nothing was impossible for the Heavenly Demon who stood at the top of Murim.The Heavenly Demon Arts.Murim\u2019s best breathing technique developed Roman's body quickly just by breathing.Only the Heavenly Demon and the Heavenly Demon Arts could make such a miracle possible.It would take a considerable amount of time for Roman to reach a satisfactory level. Still, even if he recovered only 0.1% of his original strength, there would be no problem while dealing with Blood Fang.Roman was holding his breath.In his lower abdomen, some mana reacted.Roman's body, which was far from the ideal state, was already accumulating mana and entering a new state.\u201cIf\u2026 if you kill us, you won\u2019t be safe either!\u201d\u201cWe are the Blood Fang!\u201dThe men were desperate.Since they were terrified, they tried to destroy Roman's will with words.\u201cYou\u2019ve already tried to assassinate and threaten me. Are you just stupid, or is that all you have to say?\u201dRoman squatted in front of them.Then, he cut their legs once more with a dagger.Slash!\u201cKugh!\u201d\u201cOnly answer the questions asked from now on. If you answer me honestly, I'll give you a special chance to change your ways.\"\u201cWhat kind of\u2014Ahh!\"Smack!\u201cJust answer my questions.\u201dRoman looked into their eyes.The people, who were terrified, did not dare to look into Roman's eyes.How to take care of an organization?It\u2019s actually pretty simple.When you cannot know their true nature, you will figure out the leader at some point if you kill them one by one from the bottom.Roman laughed.\u201cWho is your superior?\u201dThe conversation was short.The Blood Fang gang tried to keep the information secret, but they immediately gave out the information as soon as the torture began.He cut off the knuckles of the fingers.They could not hold out any longer when their eyes were being gouged out.\u201cThere is a pub called Dawn\u2019s Dew. We\u2026 we get our missions from there. If you say a special code, that's when they give you a mission, so we don't know more about it.\u201d\u201cGood. You should just have told me something like this first.\u201d\u201cThen, are you going to spare our lives?\u201d\u201cNo, the only way to rehabilitate garbage is death.\u201dStab!He pierced the man's heart with a dagger.There was no guilt.The Heavenly Demon Cult was a place of survival of the fittest.Showing mercy to the enemy was not a virtue of the Heavenly Demon Cult.Roman wiped the blood from his face with his sleeve and walked back into the bustling streets.'One by one.'Roman started laughing.He knew that he wasn't a good person.His heart was pounding.The feelings he could not feel when he reigned supreme in the world came alive after a long time and stimulated his senses.While the Dmitry Knights went wild, Roman walked alone towards the lair of the Blood Fang.The Castle was divided into the Inner Castle and the Outer Castle. The Inner Castle was for most rich and high-class people, while the ordinary citizens lived in the Outer Castle. Outside the castle, there were slums where poor people lived.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fIt means that Hans behaved in an uncontrollable manner.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6 - Blood Fang (2)[Dawn's Dew]The town\u2019s center was a place frequently visited by people.In that place, Blood Fang was proudly doing business with a sign in the streets.Ding ding.\"Welcome.\"As Roman opened the door and entered, the bell rang loudly.The scenery inside the building was no different from other pubs in the locality.People around the round table and the bar were chatting, and in front of them was a man who seemed to be the owner, busily carrying beer.There were dozens of people in the pub, probably because the business was doing well in its own way.\"Huh?\"\u201cHey, it\u2019s Young Master Roman.\u201dFor a moment, people's eyes turned to Roman.There was no way they wouldn\u2019t recognize the young master of the Dmitry family, which rules the estate. Accordingly, the people who had been bad mouthing him until now quieted down as if it was preplanned.Roman Dmitry.No matter how much people call him an idiot, Roman was a powerful person whom commoners could not even make eye contact with.People quickly looked away.Roman calmly moved forward and sat down at the bar when the stillness subsided.\u201cTears of Dawn, 27 years old.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we don\u2019t have a drink called Tears of Dawn in our store. Can I recommend another drink?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good too. Please make it as strong as possible. I have a lot of work to do in the morning, so I think I need to get a little drunk.\u201dThe owner froze.His expression suddenly hardened.Tears of Dawn.A strong drink.Something you have to do in the morning.These lines, in succession, were the code set by Blood Fang.The problem was that the opponent was a familiar face, Roman Dmitry.People's eyes alternately looked at the owner and Roman in the quiet space.Some people showed pure curiosity, while others showed complex emotions in their eyes.A fleeting moment.A smile formed on Roman's lips, and the owner swung the dagger that he had hidden under the table like a thunderbolt.\"Attack\u2014Kugh!\u201dThud!Clang!Roman hit the owner's head with a beer mug.At the same time, he threw his body backward, and several customers who had been drinking around until now attacked Roman.Thud thud!Two daggers were nailed to the bar table.Under the dark lighting, the Blood Fangs revealed their fierce eyes.Roman had found the information accurate, and several men disguised as guests rushed to Roman at once.\u201cAhhh!\u201d\u201cRun away!\u201dCustomers screamed and ran out of the pub.Thanks to this, finding who needed to be killed was easier.\u2018Eight people.\u2019Roman fought with the opponents.The dagger wielded at close range threatened Roman's vital points, but Roman dodged all those attacks while staying close and with minimal movements.Not only that, he immediately counterattacked and punctured a hole in his opponent's neck.Roman knew that his opponent would fall to the floor, dripping blood, if he simply swung the dagger in his hand.\u201cThis bastard!\u201d\u201cKill him!\u201dThe pub was not so peaceful anymore.The Blood Fang members revealed their true natures rather than acting like workers who soothe their tiredness with beer after a day's work.However.The opponent was a predator that would definitely devour them all.Even if they rushed from all directions simultaneously, the Blood Fang members were eventually defeated.Thud!Slam!He slammed the face of the last remaining man on the table. The rigid table shattered, leaving the man stunned, and Roman, without hesitation, kicked him in the face as he threw him to the floor. The man squirted blood and rolled around. Dropping to the floor, his body showed that his soul had already left him.\u201cWas that it?\u201dIt ended in an instant.All the men who rushed to Roman died.Just one man was left.The owner, who was beaten by a beer mug at the beginning, looked up at Roman with a blood-stained face.\u201cWhy\u2026 why are you doing this?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018why\u2019? You must clearly know\u2014why I visited this place and attacked you guys. You wouldn't have attacked me if you hadn't known that.\"Roman chuckled.The terrified owner suddenly fell back when he saw Roman sitting right in front of him on a chair.He recognized it. That was the expression of a ferocious demon.The owner cried out in an evil voice.\u201cWe are the Blood Fang. Even if I die by your hands, my comrades will definitely avenge me by taking your blood. Nobility? Do you think something like that will protect you? Aristocrats are, after all, humans just like us. The reality is that even the body of an aristocrat will have a hole in it and can be found screaming like a pig when a sword is stabbed in.\u201d\u201cDo you seriously think that saying that will save you?\u201d\u201cHah, kill me! Members of Blood Fang are not afraid of death.\u201dRoman's smile widened.The more his opponent struggled, the more confident Roman became that this was where he wanted him to be.\u201cYeah, I wanted to meet a guy like you. A person who is not afraid of death; someone who will keep his mouth shut even if he is tortured and will somehow hide the information. A guy like that definitely knows valuable information.\u201dRoman stood up.Then he looked around and said in a very calm, subdued voice.\u201cLet\u2019s check out if you really are such a strong person who does not open their mouth to any threats.\u201dThe will of the owner was strong.Unlike the guys who screamed and spewed out information like a child, even when he cut off his finger, he didn't open his mouth.However.Roman knew very well how to attack such a person.\u201cIs that a picture of your son?\u201dThe owner's expression turned pale.In a single photo, which was placed in a drawer, he was happy with his son, who looked exactly like the pub owner.\u201cNo\u2026 no, it\u2019s not.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018no\u2019? He looks just like you.\u201d\u201cYou bastard! You aristocrat bastard, are you seriously resorting to threatening my family?\u201dThe owner shook his body and screamed.I chose right.Roman walked back to the pub owner and waved the picture in front of him with a cold expression.\u201cWhile researching the Blood Fang, I found some very interesting information. The reason people fear Blood Fang is that they will surely retaliate, even at the cost of their life. However, all suicide terrorists have one thing in common. They are people who owed a great debt to the Blood Fang, but were not members of the Blood Fang from the beginning. Obviously, this means that people who weren't malicious enough to commit suicide attacks turned into demons at some point. Why did they change like that? What the hell happened to them that they changed so much as a person?\u201d\u201c...\u201dThe owner kept his mouth shut.It didn't matter.With that kind of reaction alone, Roman's decisions were correct.\u201cBlood Fang commits all sorts of crimes to pay off debt. In the process, taking the debtor's family into slavery is a common occurrence. And that's the truth about Blood Fang. Blood Fang isn't really a group of demonic humans that are willing to risk their lives, but people who have been put into a corner to get revenge by threatening their families as hostages. How is it? Isn\u2019t that a pretty plausible hypothesis?\u201d\u201cStill, nothing has changed. Blood Fang will surely take revenge.\u201dPfft.Roman laughed.What stupid people.From the moment he admitted Roman\u2019s hypothesis, the pub owner had no idea what trap he had fallen into.\u201cI promise in the name of Roman Dmitry. If you don't give me any information, I'll go back to the Inner Castle and give orders to the knights of my family. The four children in this photo\u2014find them and kill them. And killing them quickly would not be good, right? So, I will order them to kill your children, who will surely beg to be killed off quickly, a slow and painful death.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 what did you just say?\u201d\"What? Do you think I can\u2019t do that?\"\u201cYou are a noble! How could a noble\u2026?!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just prejudice. If our family is being held hostage and used, then we have no reason to leave your family alone.\u201dThe world of survival of the fittest.In that world, defeat means death.Justice?Don\u2019t make me laugh. That doesn't mean anything.In reality, you have to do anything to win, and the fact is that Roman has no hesitation in doing such actions.Because he had shown all the respect he could to his fianc\u00e9e, who was soon to part ways with him.Because he accepted Hans, who was only a servant, as his own person.The origins of Roman have not changed.Humans have various aspects, and Roman, who had lived as the Heavenly Demon, also had one aspect as the appearance of a demon.Roman said coldly, \u201cRemember wisely. I'm not at all concerned about the well-being of the guys I classify as enemies. No matter how they die or what kind of pain they get, I am the type of person who can regard the lives of those who disturb my well-being as less than a fly. So, think very carefully. If the lives of your family are in danger anyway, will you bet on Blood Fang, who enslaved your family, or will you give accurate information to me so that I can take care of Blood Fang before they touch your family?\u201dRoman spun the dagger round and round.Then, he banged the dagger on the head of his son in the photo.\u201cCome on. Choose quickly.\u201dAt that moment.The owner was sure.Roman Dmitry.He knew that he wasn't the person he knew before.The owner finally lowered his head, looking at his son's face torn so cruelly that his figure could not be recognized.After getting the required information, Roman started leaving.At the site that had become a mess, the knights of Dmitry arrived with Hans in the lead.\u201cWhat the hell is this\u2026\u201dJonathan's expression hardened.He had heard the testimony of eyewitnesses.He found out that when Roman communicated with the owner, the owner and his guests attacked Roman by surprise.However, what was more shocking than that was the current scene in front of him.Men with strong physiques were lying on the floor with broken bones.\u2018Did Young Master Roman deal with them all by himself?\u2019He couldn't believe it.Roman was a weakling with no talent for battle. He was an idiot who trembled when he saw the slightest of blood and couldn\u2019t even wield a sword properly. That was why he couldn't believe that Roman had dealt with so many men just by himself.There was a sense of disparity.He was different from the Roman he knew before from what the eyewitnesses told him.At that moment.\u201cCaptain! Here are the survivors!\u201dThe owner of the pub was alive.When he hurriedly ran, he saw the miserable shape the owner was left in.\u201cKugh!\u201dThe owner spat out a handful of his blood.From the looks of it, he had been tortured. All the fingers of his right hand were cut off, and the thick blood he spat out showed pieces of intestines.At a glance, anyone could tell that he would die at any moment. However, he hadn\u2019t given up on his life yet.He spoke to Jonathan in a clear voice, as if he had had a flashback.\u201cYou must follow Young Master Roman immediately!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI told Young Master Roman everything. The fact that Blood Fang's stronghold is not here in Dmitry, but in the heart of Lawrence. As soon as he heard that, Young Master Roman left this place. It seems like he is trying to get things done on his own, but he will never be able to handle them on his own. So, hurry up and help Young Master Roman! Help the Young Master now. We must get rid of the Blood Fang at its roots!\u201dThe owner's voice was desperate.He had already become a traitor in exchange for his information.Then, as Roman said, his family will be safe only if Roman takes care of the Blood Fang.The owner crawled on the ground.He gripped the ankles of Knights\u2019 Commander, Jonathan, with his blood-stained hands and said in a desperate voice.\u201cPlease, please, kill them all.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dJonathan's eyes shook.It was a complicated situation.The appearance of the Blood Fang members crying out, requesting him to help Roman was also embarrassing. But the biggest problem was Roman's actions.\u2018Are you seriously going to deal with them alone?\u2019Lawrence.It wasn\u2019t Dmitry's realm.Still, he froze at the words that he had just heard.If it weren't for Hans, Jonathan would just have been sitting there for a long time.\u201cKnights\u2019 Commander Jonathan! We must leave quickly! The young master is in danger!\"\u201cRight.\u201dJonathan came to his senses.Roman.We cannot let Dmitry's eldest son die in another territory.Although he did not request for cooperation with Lawrence beforehand, he couldn\u2019t afford to wait for the approval of such a request at this time.The Dmitry Knights left in a hurry.Their destination was the city of Lawrence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7 - Blood Fang (3)Information often travels faster than people.As soon as Blood Fang\u2019s branch in Dmitry collapsed, news about it reached the headquarters in Lawrence.\u201cIs that really true?\u201d\"Yes. According to the sources, Roman Dmitry single-handedly killed all Blood Fang members in the Dmitry branch. What should we do? The Dmitry Knights have also moved, so everything could be in danger if things keep going on like this.\u201d\u201cDamn it.\u201dBen Miles, the leader of Blood Fang, distorted his expression.\u201cI can't believe it. The Roman Dmitry, as we know him, is by no means such a person. The sources said that the whole branch in Dmitry was destroyed by a guy called Dmitry's Fool, who was also denied admission to the Royal Swordsmanship Academy? This doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201dA few days ago, Ben Miles saw a golden opportunity when he heard that Roman had killed his minions.Most groups do not dare to take revenge if their opponent is a noble.Nobles are people who value honor too much.Considering that they will rush to avenge the family, it is best to solve problems with the nobles in a good way.Due to this specific reason, Blood Fang was able to acquire great notoriety.Even though they were not a great force, they risked their lives to terrorize the nobility.This case was similar.By killing Roman Dmitry, Ben Miles wanted to rekindle the fading infamy of the Blood Fang.The opponent was perfect too.Dmitry's Fool.Despite him being Dmitry's eldest son, Baron Romero is rumored to fully support his two younger sons rather than Roman.Maybe he would rather like Roman's death. When he had finished calculating his profit and loss, Ben Miles boldly ordered his subordinate to kill him in the center of Dmitry for everyone to see.He was sure that his plan would work without a hitch.Nobles are, in the end, humans as well.The opponent is bound to bleed and die if the sword protruding from the shadow pierces the body.However, the results were much different from what he expected.Not only did the gang members who followed Roman suffer, but the Blood Fang\u2019s Dmitry branch was also completely destroyed.\u2018If we run away like this, our notoriety will end here.\u2019His reputation was the problem.I thought it would be easy because he was known as Dmitry's Fool, but if rumors spread that such a guy defeated us, our future activities would definitely become difficult. In the end, it was a situation where it was necessary to make a choice. Of course, disbanding the gang members will ensure immediate safety, but gaining back the same notoriety as before will become virtually impossible.Ben Miles asked, \u201cWhere is Roman now?\u201d\u201cWe were informed that he just left Dmitry. Apparently, he got the information from Dawn\u2019s Dew. Since he and the Dmitry Knights are moving separately, I think Roman will arrive in Lawrence early, so if we deal with him before the knights arrive, it won\u2019t be much difficult to escape.\u201d\u201cAfter all, he is alone.\u201dBen Miles smiled coldly.It was ridiculous.How lowly did he think of Blood Fang that he would have dared to attack Dmitry\u2019s stronghold by himself?He is even coming as far as Lawrence, which is several tens of kilometers away from Dmitry.This is an issue that we should never run away from.I have no intention of clashing with the Dmitry Knights, but I have to at least deal with the kid who doesn\u2019t know his place.\u201cGather the members right now. Today, we will kill Dmitry\u2019s young master and once again make the Blood Fang notorious.\u201dHe had a leader-like determination.At least at that moment, Ben Miles was convinced he was right.- - -The time when the Dmitry Knights arrived at Lawrence's estate was when the sun that had risen in the middle of the sky was setting a little bit.It took longer than expected.As an incident occurred during training, there were many factors that slowed down the knights.Lawrence's wall could be seen from afar.Captain Jonathan, who took the lead, revealed the purpose of the visit.\u201cThis is Jonathan, the commander of the knights of Lord Baron Dmitry\u2019s family! I know that Young Master Roman, the eldest son of the Dmitry family, has entered Lawrence! Open the gates now! Right now, Blood Fang is aiming for Young Master Roman's life!\"Each second was precious.He shouted so hard his veins popped out of his neck. He did it to ensure the voice would go through the wall; however, Lawrence's gate didn't move an inch.Suddenly, above the wall, a man who appeared to be the guard's captain showed his face.The man with a square chin and a determined impression did not respond positively to Jonathan's urging.\u201cSorry, but armed forces aren\u2019t allowed to pass through the gates. If you wish to enter Lawrence, disarm everyone and go through the formalities.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I just tell you?! Young Master Roman is in danger! We need the armed forces to save the young master!\u201d\u201cPlease understand our position as well. Which province opened the gates to the armed forces that came without notice? I understand the urgency, and if Young Master Roman Dmitry is in danger, we will send our own troops. So choose. Either turn around and head back or throw away all the weapons and follow the formal procedure. Those are the only options.\u201d\"Ugh!\"Jonathan's face flushed red.Lawrence and Dmitry.They weren\u2019t lands that didn\u2019t have any communication.However, even though he notified them of the urgent situation, the gates were not opened, and even though he understood it in his head, fire erupted from within.\u201cYou fucking bastards. If anything happens to Young Master Roman during this time, I will not leave you alone. I am Jonathan, the leader of the Dmitry Knights. I will surely keep the words I spit out, and I will remember this. So, open the door. Now is not the time to waste on procedures, but it\u2019s the time to work together as soon as possible to find the young master.\u201dKrrrr.The sword on his waist started to vibrate.A three-star aura knight.Jonathan's strength was not at a level that a single guard commander could handle.The captain of the guard knew only then that the situation was dire, but he could not make a hasty decision.As it was a volatile situation, tension was rampant.It was then.\u201cGuard Captain! There is a serious problem!\u201dA soldier hurriedly ran to the captain of the guards and whispered to him in a voice that could not be heard from outside.The Guard Captain's face turned pale.It could be seen that he was startled.\u201cIs that true?\u201d\"Yes. Right now, there\u2019s a riot going on at Lawrence Square.\u201d\"Oh, no.\"Lawrence Square.What was going on there?In a moment, his heart dropped, and Jonathan's patience exploded.\u201cOpen this door right now, you sons of bitches!\u201d- - -Lawrence Square.Just a few minutes ago, it was peaceful.It was a place that commonly depicted a normal scenery everyday , but the appearance of a man drowned the people's peace.\u201cAhhhh!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 what is that?\u201dDrip drip drip.Roman suddenly appeared.After reaching Lawrence an hour before the arrival of the Dmitry Knights and taking care of the situation, he grabbed the man's hair, whose face was covered in blood, and Roman dragged him into the center of the square.Those who saw it and were terrified ran away.However, at the unusual sight, people suddenly gathered around Roman, one by one.\"Oh my god.\"\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t we stop this?\u201dThe people were confused.Still, Roman didn't care about that.Rather, as he gripped the rebellious man's hair more harshly, the man spoke earnestly with his dry mouth.\u201c\u2026Please, spare me.\u201dThe man's true identity was Ben Miles.He was the leader of the Blood Fang.He hadn't expected anything like this to happen when he gave orders to his subordinates to deal with Roman.His opponent was known as Dmitry\u2019s Fool.He decided it would be enough to deal with him quickly and hide, but what happened after that was still unbelievable.Roman had arrived at the base of Blood Fang. Soon after that, the massacre began.Dozens of gang members rushed at once, but Roman didn't back down, and when the sword flashed, the gang members fell while spurting blood.An unbelievable sight.His eyes twitched.The boundaries of common sense have already crumbled within his sight.\u2018Is this really the one who\u2019s called Dmitry\u2019s Fool?\u2019He couldn't believe it even though he saw it himself.Since information is everything, criminal gangs knew how pathetic and insignificant Roman was.If Roman were such a great person, he wouldn't have even dared to fight him.But the reality was different.Ben Miles was terrified to see a completely different look from the usual Roman.\u2018I have to run away.\u2019However, his decision was too late.When he decided to take care of Roman, he already had his options limited down.As a result, Ben Miles ended up like this.He couldn't wake up due to the tingling pain and couldn't even see the blood dripping down from his forehead.\u2018I am sure that I will die.\u2019It was instinct.It was pure instinct.He grabbed onto Roman's pants and wept while begging for his life.\u201cI was really wrong. If you only spare my life, I will do anything for you, Young Master Roman. I will dedicate the Blood Fang organization to the young master, and I will also give you all the gold and silver treasures I have collected. So, please spare me. You can just think of it as sparing a petty dog that doesn't even know its place. If the young master shows mercy to me just once, he will gain a dog that will give its life for him.\u201dHe was totally desperate.The people\u2019s stares and his reputation weren\u2019t important to him now.He struggled and laid down everything he had just to live.He begged for his life.Roman stopped walking.\u201cA dog that will give its life for me\u2026\u201dPfft.Roman laughed.As soon as he reached the center of the square, he looked down at Ben Miles.\u201cYou should have made that decision before you showed your teeth to me.\u201d\u201cYoung master, please\u2026\u201dGrip!He grabbed his head tightly.Then, he announced to those who were watching.\u201cThis person I am holding now is the leader of the Blood Fang. He is the one who sucked up the blood of innocent citizens with usury. You already should know it well, what a heinous force the Blood Fang is.\u201dMurmur murmur.The people agreed.Conversations began on the two sides.The identities of Roman Dmitry and Ben Miles forced them to panic.Seeing the leader of the Blood Fang, their blood boiled.In the heightened mood, Roman did what he had been trying to do since he set foot at Lawrence.\u201cBlood Fang even extended their demonic beasts to Dmitry. With their obscene methods, they plunged Dmitry's citizens into hell and even showed intent to kill me, who interfered with them. Blood Fang's sin is clear as crystal. Therefore, in front of you, I will get rid of this evil at its very roots.\u201dThere was no time for them even to blink.As soon as the words were finished, Roman slammed Ben Miles' face to the ground.Slam!Blood splattered on the ground.His face crushed, and Ben Miles' pupils dilated.That was the end of it.Ben Miles, who had begged countless times for his life while being dragged along, became limp and did not move.People held their breath.Even in a world where death was commonplace, what they were witnessing now was too shocking.And then.\u201cYoung master?!\u201dJonathan and the Dmitry Knights looked at him with shocked faces.They had arrived late at the scene.While the incident was happening outside, Flora stood in front of her father's office.\u201c\u2026haa.\"A sigh came out of her mouth.Immediately after visiting Dmitry's estate, she officially announced her intentions to break up with Roman, and then she returned to Lawrence. However, she had yet to tell her father anything about it.For Lawrence, breaking off the engagement will be extremely terrible.All of her father's plans to solve the problem based on Dmitry's capital power will fail, and his disappointment will be great as a father who raised Flora like a princess.She couldn't afford to face her father's disappointment.Even when she announced her breakup, she had judged that this was the right thing to do for her own life, but the reality that befell her was that Flora had become a coward.\u2018Yeah, let\u2019s talk. I am sure he will understand. It's my life. I can\u2019t be sold to a man I don\u2019t care about, even if it\u2019s an arranged marriage.\u2019She finally made her decision.Even if it's an arranged marriage, she wanted to be with a guy she could respect in the slightest, but not someone like Dmitry's Fool.This is the right choice.Just when Flora was about to open the door, a soldier rushed forward.\u201cLord! Lord!\u201dOn the way, he found Flora. He then greeted her quickly and went straight into his office.It was a situation beyond Flora\u2019s comprehension.As the door closed in front of her, a question appeared on Flora's face.\u201c\u2026What's going on?\u201dShe didn't know.What was shocking was the incident that Roman, the man she decided not to marry, had caused outside the building.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 - Change (1)Viscount Lawrence's office.A meeting was being held there for quite a while.\u201cWhat are the movements of the Barco family?\u201d\u201cI think they made a decision. According to recent information, the Barco family commissioned the Golden Bank to get a large loan. The only thing the Barco family, who has no special source of income, could be preparing for is war. We need to make sure to secure skilled mercenaries before they can recruit all of them. Now, war is only a matter of time.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huuu.\u201dAt the words of Doppler, a family vassal and a strategist, Viscount Lawrence could not hide his troubled expression.\u201cTo think it would end in a war.\u201dIt was a year ago.The conflict had started back then.Lawrence and other families were located in the North-East of the kingdom of Cairo, but there was not much land for farming due to the mountainous nature of the country.At least Lawrence had a lot of fertile lands compared to other estates, and it was even said that most of the crops produced in the North-East came from Lawrence.Then one day, the Barco family presented them with a document.It turned out that the ancestors of the Lawrence family were in debt to the Barcos, and fertile land was at stake as collateral.Due to this, a conflict between the two families began.Being the Viscount of Lawrence, he insisted that he could not fulfill the promise of the document as it couldn\u2019t be accurately authenticated. In contrast, the Barco family insisted on the document's authenticity and tried to pressure Lawrence.In fact, even back then, Viscount Lawrence didn't think the situation would get as bad as it was now.The authenticity of the documents of the Barco family was unclear, but the problem was that a relative of the Barco family occupied a place in the central government.Due to that, the rights of the Barco family were eventually recognized.At the choice of either paying off a huge debt or giving up the land, the Lawrence family locked their doors and raised their voices of protest.However, even then, the trouble was not resolved.Now, there was only one way to solve this problem.War.The Barco family prepared for war.Lawrence had heard several conversations about them, and now he even heard rumors that they had borrowed money from the Golden Bank.Doppler said, \u201cWar is now inevitable. If the Barco family's request is accepted and the family pillar is to be pulled out at the roots, it is better to be prepared for war and fight a desperate struggle. Fortunately, Miss Flora will marry Roman Dmitry of the Dmitry family. Although Dmitry is originally from a family of commoners, isn't he now a rich man known throughout the North-East? I don't know how much the Barco family borrowed from the Golden Bank as collateral, but I seriously doubt they have more money than the Dmitry family.\"\u201cThat\u2019s probably right. Only because of that, I sent my sole daughter to Dmitry's Fool.\"\u201cLord, it was a decision for Lawrence. You have made the right decision as a lord, so you need not blame yourself.\u201d\u201c\u2026I know.\"However, his expression was different from his answer.Thinking about the future of her daughter, Flora, his heart was broken.\u2018The moment we give the land to Barco, our family is over. Different families will try to bite us from all sides. This is the right decision for my daughter as well. The moment the status of the family falls, the future of the beauty that everyone admires is bound to be hopeless. At least if she gets married in a situation where the family is strong, my daughter will be treated well even in Dmitry.\u2019He swallowed the pain.This was reality.There were times when he had to make a decision, even though he knew it would be painful, just in order to solve the problem in front of him.The meeting soon finished.After the marriage with Dmitry takes place, we will get mercenaries and prepare for war.No matter how strong Barco was in the northeast, Dmitry's support could never be ignored.However, it was then.*Bam!*The door swung open!\u201cLord! There is a big problem!\u201dA soldier walked past Flora and stormed into the office.The news he delivered to Viscount Lawrence was genuinely shocking.\u201c\u2026Is that really true?\u201d\"Yes.\"\u201cHmm.\u201dHe couldn't believe it.Roman Dmitry.It is said that there is no silkworm under the hood1, but rumor has it that Roman was even worse than a typical supremacist bastard.But then, how did he get rid of Blood Fang?It didn't make any sense.First of all, it's hard to believe that Roman had enough power, and even then, Blood Fang was an organization whose base had not yet been revealed.If it had been an organization whose identity could be revealed so easily, Blood Fang would not have survived until now.He asked the soldier in detail.He wanted to know from start to finish, just what exactly the soldier had seen.\u201cWhen Young Master Roman Dmitry visited the estate, nothing special happened. He was promised to marry Miss Flora, so I allowed him to enter the estate without any questions. However, it was about an hour later. As I was returning to my quarters for a shift, I witnessed Roman grabbing a man's hair and dragging him away towards Lawrence Square. Later, he revealed that that man was the leader of Blood Fang, Ben Miles. I don't know what happened between Roman and the Blood Fang, but Roman dragged the leader of the Blood Fang in front of the people of Lawrence and finally executed him.\"It was beyond common sense.It was unbelievable.The execution of the leader of the Blood Fang was definitely something to be proud of and glad of.However, the situation was not so simple.Even though Roman was Flora's fianc\u00e9e, he acted hastily while dealing with Blood Fang on Lawrence's land.Just as Viscount Lawrence expected, Doppler said sternly, \u201cThis is a murder committed without the permission of the Lord, the owner of Lawrence. This is an issue that cannot be overlooked.\u201dA resolute voice.Viscount Lawrence's expression turned complicated.A problem with an order?Right now, that wasn\u2019t important.It\u2019s his own future son-in-law.He wanted to see the face of Roman Dmitry, who was said to have dealt with Blood Fang single-handedly.\u201cCall Roman Dmitry right now. I will see him face-to-face and hear the circumstances of this incident.\u201dIt wasn't long before Roman was brought in.Lawrence's guards were securing Roman's troops, so he showed up in the office as soon as he was called.Roman was not alone.Viscount Lawrence showed a sign of disappointment as he walked along with the Dmitry Knights\u2019 Commander, Jonathan.'As expected.'This case was not a problem that an individual could solve.Judging by the fact that the commander of the knights of Dmitry was following along, it seemed that Blood Fang had been dealt with with his help.\u201cI, Roman Dmitry, greet Lord Viscount Lawrence.\u201d\u201cForget the formalities. Explain to me in detail. Why the hell did you come all the way to Lawrence to do such a cruel thing?\u201dA sharp and straightforward question.Nevertheless, Roman's expression remained calm.There was no tremor in his voice, even when those around him were staring at him.\u201cTo explain the situation, I need to go back a few days from now, to the beginning of the problem. The Blood Fang members were persecuting the innocent citizens of Dmitry, so I executed them on the spot. Then, Blood Fang eventually came after my life. I attacked them after luring them in on purpose and later decided that I couldn't leave them like this. That's the whole story of what happened in Dmitry. After hearing that Blood Fang had a central base in Lawrence, I rushed here and executed the leader, Ben Miles.\u201d\u201cWhat I want to ask is who gave you the right to do such a thing in Lawrence. You have no right to execute anyone here.\u201d\"I know.\"Rights.They were important.It was just for a cause, and even Roman had no intention of crossing the line.However, that was until he dug up Blood Fang's information and confirmed one fact.\u201cBut I had my doubts about whether I should be the one to punish Blood Fang in Lawrence properly. Ben Miles is not a faceless figure. He was not identified as the leader of the Blood Fang, but he was quite famous in Lawrence for all kinds of charges. However, how did Lawrence deal with it? I was on guard. Although Ben Miles has been caught in several incidents, he has been released on massive bail on several occasions. So I just made a decision. I didn't believe in Lawrence's method, so I had to do it my own way.\u201d\u201cHow dare this guy?!\u201d\u201cYoung master!\u201dHe was making extremely bold remarks.Doppler shouted, hardening his face, and Jonathan stopped Roman in embarrassment.The opponent is Viscount Lawrence.A Viscount family is higher than the Dmitry family.However, even with such a person in front of him, Roman did not admit his guilt but showed that he believed he was right.Roman said, \u201cTo be honest, I was a little disappointed. I thought you would congratulate me for dealing with Blood Fang, but I didn't know that you would punish me for a problem with the procedure of things. I solved the Blood Fang problem that was being discussed as a problem not only in Lawrence, but in the whole North-East area. I put my own life at risk to solve the problem while Larence was sitting around. I ask you, Viscount Lawrence. Did I really do something wrong?\u201dViscount Lawrence's expression hardened.He saw Doppler.\u201cIs that true?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about\u2026\u201d\u201cBen Miles is a known figure. I asked if that was really true.\u201dDoppler was stunned.Ben Miles.He knew it too.I didn't know he was the leader of Blood Fang, but he was so notorious that I remember hearing his name.Doppler started murmuring his response in hesitation. Seeing this, Viscount Lawrence was sure that no more questions were needed.Viscount Lawrence's gaze turned to Roman, who was looking at him.\u201cI will not take this issue any further. Although you don't have the right to execute anyone in Lawrence's land, this wouldn't have happened if we had done things right in the first place. In this regard, we will compensate separately later.\u201d\"Thank you.\"\u201cThen, you may go.\u201d\"Yes.\"Roman bowed his head.Jonathan, who had seemed to be walking on thin ice until just now, hurriedly followed Roman and left the office.The moment they left and the door closed.Clack.\u201cKahahahahahahaha, I took a solid blow. That guy is really Roman Dmitry, right?\u201dViscount Lawrence.A smile bloomed across his face.Like father like son.2Looking at Roman's dignified attitude, Viscount Lawrence evaluated him from the perspective of his son-in-law.\"Right. It is natural for a man to have such courage. An heir that got blood on his hands for the sake of his citizens. Who the hell is calling that guy a fool? He is a badass man.\u201dLaughter came out.Roman's words were sophistry, and he should have been punished.Still, he didn\u2019t punish him.Thinking that a man like Roman would be his future son-in-law, a bond formed that he didn\u2019t know yet existed, and he couldn\u2019t stop smiling.His eyes were looking straight at me.A dignified attitude.He was so fucking cool.When he heard that he was called Dmitry's Fool, he imagined a miserable image, but when he saw him in real life, he was totally different.\u201cHowever, my lord. You cannot overlook this incident.\u201d\u201cWhere would something like this not be allowed? He's going to be Flora's husband soon. In order for a man to do big things, he needs that kind of determination and attitude. And he didn't kill innocent civilians either. Since he has dealt with the Blood Fang problem that has been tormenting us for so long, wouldn't it be right to congratulate him as he said?\"\"However\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s overlook this situation. I\u2019m in a good mood. Roman will be a great fit for Flora.\u201dHe was excited.Earlier, an arranged marriage with Dmitry broke Viscount Lawrence's heart.But now, he was on cloud nine.Flora.He wanted to see his daughter.He wanted to tell her what a great man Roman was.\u201cCall Flora right now.\u201dHowever, he didn't know back then that the marriage of two families was, in fact, already over.Silkworm under the hood is a Chinese saying that means even a great father can have a horrible son.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fThis means that a son's character or behavior can be expected to resemble that of his father.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9 - Change (2)At first, she didn't know what was going on.Flora grabbed the soldier coming out of the office, and only after talking to him did she get to know what had happened in Lawrence.'Oh my god.'Blood Fang.A faction called a heinous criminal group even in Lawrence.At one time, the noble families made a move to wipe them out but eventually gave up because they were determined for revenge.So, for Flora, Blood Fang remained a problem that couldn\u2019t be solved.As long as you don't touch them, they won't cause you any problems, so I tried to stay away from them as much as possible.Roman said he would deal with them the day I talked about breaking the engagement.Because he took on the responsibility of breaking up by himself, Flora unwittingly tried to stop Roman.However.\u201cWe are strangers now. So, I will take care of my own business.\u201dRoman drew a line.Since the bond of arranged marriage has been broken, they have clearly stated that they should not get involved in each other's lives.Flora was stunned.I was angry, but my partner didn't understand.Is this his last remaining pride?Is he not being nice to me because I wanted to break off the engagement? Will he feel better after treating me this way?I had a lot of thoughts.Of course, I didn't think Roman would put what he had said into action.However.\u2018You really took care of the Blood Fang.\u2019What I thought was absurd became a reality.What others would not have dared to do, Roman had done in just a few days.This didn\u2019t make any sense.Dmitry's Fool?That was a false rumor.Even if Knights\u2019 Commander, Jonathan, had helped, the person she met and experienced wasn\u2019t a fool.He knew how to take responsibility for his actions, and he also kept his word on what he said he would do.And if he had personally killed Ben Miles, the leader of the Blood Fang, the rumor that he could not even wield a sword was also highly likely to be false.Why?Could Roman have kept his mouth shut to escape the world's evaluations?If she truly knew what kind of man Roman was even a little earlier, Flora would have made an effort to get to know Roman better.It was too late to regret.The cup had already spilled, and now, Flora was called by her father.Her father suddenly started praising Roman Dmitry.I don't know what happened in his office, but her father\u2019s face clearly showed that he was in awe of what Roman did and had taken a liking to Roman.\u201c\u2026We decided to break up the engagement.\u201dFlora's words.For Viscount Lawrence, it was out of the blue.Flora.She was Viscount Lawrence's princess.He was extremely protective of her. She was the daughter he had raised all his life dearly, but he could not tolerate her this time.\u201cYou already announced the breakup?!\u201dViscount Lawrence got up from his seat.Flora's heart raced at her father's anger, whom she had never seen before, and he struggled to express his thoughts with a calm face.\"Yes, father. The last time I visited Dmitry's estate, I expressed my intentions to Roman. I also wanted to do things for my family according to your will, but no matter how much I thought about it, marrying someone I can't respect\u2014\u201d\"Flora. I thought you were a smart kid. But\u2026 this is not it.\u201dHe interrupted her speech.Unlike usual, he didn't want to listen to her daughter.\u201cI have already told you. How serious our land\u2019s situation right now is. Now, the Barco family has borrowed a large sum of money from the Golden Bank to prepare for war against us. Did you make that choice knowing what that meant? There is no longer any compromise with the Barco family. They will bring us to our knees for this matter and take everything in the name of a good cause. It's not just about gold and silver. Our land, our honor, and even you, Lawrence's flower. It means taking it all away.\u201d\u201cLawrence is not weak. Even if it\u2019s Barco, isn\u2019t it impossible to win?\u201d\"Right. If it was only the Barco family who had come forward, it would have been possible. The problem is that the \u201ccentral government\u201d approved the document, even if its authenticity was not confirmed, and the Golden Bank lent money to the Barco family without any special collateral. This is not just a battle between two families. The forces that lent power to the Barco family will create a battle in which we have no choice but to lose, even for their own benefit.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dFlora's eyes shook.She was smart.She was called gifted from an early age and boasted of her brilliance enough to finish her academy course early.However, that was only her academic knowledge.Neither the academy nor the library showed her the cold reality as there was no way she could learn that from books.She thought Lawrence had nothing to lose, but the reality she believed in was far from real.Viscount Lawrence said, \u201cAn arranged marriage with the Dmitry family was an unavoidable choice. From the family located in the North-East, they were the only family who could add the power and forces to solve the Barco family's evil intentions, so your father asked for your permission. I asked if you could sacrifice yourself for the family crisis. Of course, it would\u2019ve been difficult for you to refuse, but if you had still refused back then, I wouldn't have been as angry as I am now. It's a matter of choosing the marriage partner you like from among other prestigious families, so you must have taken a step back. However, this is different. Previously, you were the flower of Lawrence that everyone admired, but now you have left a scar with the choice of breaking a marriage. Other families will try to keep an eye on the situation as it would be very risky to marry you under the current circumstances.\u201dThe world of power.In that world, choices often come at a great price.Lawrence, who had gained the help of Dmitry through the arranged marriage, lost what they gained because of the breakup.Just a while ago, Viscount Lawrence met Roman.He was a good guy.His eyes were sharp, and he was a man with an attitude that did not waver even in front of a Viscount.And seeing how he handled Blood Fang for the citizens, his own people seemed to be particularly fond of him.Due to all of this, he was in a good mood.He was in a good mood, even if it was an arranged marriage.The sole reason was that he discovered that Roman wasn\u2019t a fool like the rumors said.Lawrence had no other option, so he felt that the arranged marriage was not bad.However, the cup has already been spilled.Due to that, everything they had prepared to face the Barco family became useless.\u201cIn the past, the Barco family asked us to get in an arranged marriage. Perhaps they coveted our fertile land. Back then, I flatly refused. No matter what advantage they gave us, the eldest son of the Barco family had many women which made me refuse the proposal. And if we lose this war, you will not be a part of Dmitry, but a woman of the Barco family. That's the reality. At least before the war, you were in a position where you could choose your husband, but now, things are completely different.\u201dReasons for the arranged marriage.The reason why I had no choice even though that decision broke my heart.Because the opponent is Barco.Knowing what it meant to be defeated by those who had been targeting Lawrence for a long time, Viscount Lawrence accepted the reality.Flora's heart sank.The way she sees it.There were no such stories in that world.What were Barco's intentions, and what would be gained by marrying into the Dmitry Family?She was na\u00efve.Because she had a pure heart in a cruel world, she chose to break up, not knowing what the outcome would be.But now, she faced the cold reality.Viscount Lawrence took in his breath.Of course, there was still time to pick up the spilled water.\u201cTake some time to think about what mistakes you have made. I will make an appointment with Dmitry again and I will try to undo the breakup. My daughter, we are aristocrats. We are not in a position to worry about our daily lives like common people. This is a position that has much more responsibilities than them. So, please pray that this problem will be resolved. If Dmitry rejects our offer this time, our chances of winning the war against the Barco family will be extremely slim.\u201dFortunately, the breakup was not yet known to the public.The only way to avoid mistakes is to do something right away.Viscount Lawrence left Flora in her shocked state and left her at the office.There was a lot of work to be done from now on.At the same time, Roman left Lawrence with the Dmitry Knights.They were moving.Knight Commander Jonathan looked at Roman's appearance.\u2018Is this really the Young Master Roman I know?\u2019Roman.From what he knew, Roman wasn't born with enough confidence to look straight at Viscount Lawrence.Along with that, all the things he did concerning the Blood Fang.It was seriously questionable.He hadn't really talked to Roman, but now he couldn't stand his itchy mouth.\u201cYoung master, was it really necessary to provoke Viscount Lawrence like that? I'm glad he didn't take it seriously, but if Viscount Lawrence had been angry, even the young master wouldn't have been able to escape punishment.\"At the place where he was being reprimanded, Roman rather criticized his opponents.Jonathan was so startled back then that he almost tried to stop Roman.\u201cWas there a need to?\u201dRoman laughed.A need?There wasn\u2019t.It was best to solve it on the spot, but he deliberately changed his attitude in the atmosphere of reprimanding himself.\u201cLawrence is not free from responsibility in this case. Their negligence allowed the Blood Fang to exist, and as a result, the people of Dmitry's estate were harmed. So, I was just pointing out the facts. The fact that they have no right to reprimand me on the spot. Even if things weren't the same, Viscount Lawrence wouldn't have punished me. Judging by the atmosphere, it seemed that he did not know the fact of the breakup yet, and he would not make stupid judgments to punish his soon-to-be son-in-law.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dRoman behavior.It wasn't a reckless act.Roman was judging the situation, and he uttered enough remarks to handle.\u201cOur families don\u2019t even have proper communication between us to inform them of the breakup. Do you still think that I will need to ask for forgiveness from them? I took care of a problem that they couldn\u2019t, if I was going to get anything, it would be praise and not punishments.\"A confident attitude and along with a confident voice.At that moment, Jonathan became sure.\u2018The young master has changed.\u2019Roman Dmitry.He wasn't the fool he used to be.- - -Roman arrived at his home.He immediately immersed himself in the bathtub and flushed the blood from his body with warm water.\u2018Even in my new life, my fundamentals do not change.\u2019I killed a person.Actually, he killed at least dozens.Blood Fang was slaughtered like that, but he felt no guilt for them.\u2018It was necessary.\u2019Roman, no, Baek Joong-hyuk.He lived in a world of survival of the fittest.If he showed the weakness of hesitating when he had to kill someone, Baek Joong-hyuk's life would have ended when he was young.So, if he makes a decision, he must act.If anyone were blocking his road, he would cut them down without any hesitation and, if necessary, torture them in many cases.That was Baek Joong-hyuk's life.Nothing changed when he became Roman.If there was someone that showed their murderous intent, eliminating them with whatever means necessary was the way of Baek Joong-hyuk's life.If the same thing happens again in the future, Roman will make the same judgment.Whether the opponent is the remnants of Blood Fang or someone stronger than them, Roman will always live a life as a predator by devouring those who oppose him.\u201cYoung Master Dmitry, Lord Dmitry is calling you.\u201dIt was when he finished taking a shower.At Hans' words, Roman changed into clean clothes and started walking.Soon, he arrived at the office.However, Baron Romero, who he thought would criticize his reckless move, looked at him with a dazzling gaze.An expression that cannot hide his great anticipation.Baron Romero asked, \u201cSo, you dealt with Blood Fang just by yourself?\u201dJonathan was standing next to him.Right, he must have told him the situation.The meaning of the question was clear.Romero Dmitry, as the father of his son, not the lord of Dmitry, couldn\u2019t hide his excitement after discovering that his son had finally changed for the better.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 - Change (3)I couldn't believe it at first.Roman.Did he deal with Blood Fang himself?Baron Romero would have thought the other person was insulting him if it wasn't for the Knights\u2019 Commander, Jonathan.\u201c\u2026I don't know how to explain this situation, but one thing is for sure, Young Master Roman seems to have changed. He executed Ben Miles, the leader of the Blood Fang, in front of everyone. And even when he met Viscount Lawrence, he showed an attitude of proudly explaining what he had done and why he had done so. That was not the Young Master Roman I knew before.\u201dJonathan is not a liar.Baron Romero, who had heard of the situation, gained hope for his eldest son, whom he had given up on.\u2018Did Roman really change?\u2019Romero's three sons.Among them, Roman was a sore thumb.Roman experienced a time when he was a commoner like himself, so he was a crooked child trying to take care of himself.It hurts my heart to look at him.A long time ago, Baron Romero was working hard to secure the tunnels of the iron mines by putting in a great deal of his workforce.It was such an important task that it would have taken Baron Romero\u2019s entire lifespan to finish, but at one point, he worked so hard that he lived in an iron mine all day.Roman was only three years old at that time.Roman, unable to walk, crawled over to his father and gave him a small cookie.I still remember how cute it was.Baron Romero, whose face had turned black due to the tunnel work, hugged Roman with a big smile.Maybe that was why he wanted Roman to live a happy life.Unlike the other two sons, he didn't know how to do anything properly, so he gave him a lot of pocket money, hoping that he wouldn\u2019t be looked down on anywhere.He didn't know that it would become the start of the problem.Roman resolved the grievances that had accumulated in his heart with luxury, and then Dmitry's Fool was born.Baron Romero was an inexperienced father.Although his son was not the best, the marriage with Flora Lawrence was a gift for Roman.However, now it's changed.He had no choice but to be happy.The process didn't matter.Even if Roman had hired people to bring down the Blood Fang with his own money, it was important to Baron Romero that Roman took the lead in doing something.Baron Romero was ready to dedicate himself to his son at any time if his son showed him the slightest good change.\u201cI greet you, father.\u201dRoman.He showed his face.It was hard to believe that a terrible incident had just happened because his expression was so calm.He knew instinctively.Roman has changed.His gait, his attitude, and his expression; those things alone made him realize that his son had changed.No, he may have anticipated the current situation from the moment he raised his voice proudly against himself.\u201cSo, you dealt with Blood Fang by yourself?\u201dHe blurted out those words.Even though he knew it instinctively.Baron Romero hoped to ascertain the truth from Roman himself.The answer to the question is simple.Yes or No.Telling the truth is good enough.He doesn't need to think about it, and if he tells the truth about what he's been through, this case will be resolved naturally.His father's trust.Roman could gain a lot from this.However.\u2018Exceeding expectations will come back to hit me just like a boomerang.\u2019Baron Romero\u2019s expectations for Roman were literally zero.However, if a person who would be amazed by even seeing one good result saw ten good results at the same time, it would be a tremendous event for them.This would have a huge effect on his future as well.What should I do?Should I reveal myself or should I hide my capabilities?In Murim, showing off your talent is extremely dangerous.If he showed such prodigious talent, he would inevitably end up getting his head crushed by a hammer.Only one in ten thousand.People who survived the attention of those around them were called masters in Murim.\u2018I have not yet fully grasped this world. The guy named Roman Dmitry possessed an insignificant force like an ant compared to when I was Baek Joong-hyuk, and exposing myself too much would not be good for my safety. What I need now is time to be aware of this reality and grow up enough. Dmitry's reputation as a fool is very appropriate to buy time.'Pfft.Laughter came out.A rational judgment.He knew what was right, but from the first confrontation with Blood Fang, such a premise meant nothing.I will reveal myself.Roman didn't know how to hide it.\u201cYes, I did.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon, Baek Joong-hyuk, was a person who could not live a normal life.Everyone had a period when their parents protected them.But Roman\u2014No! Baek Joong-hyuk was different.When Baek Joong-hyuk gained some strength to move his body, he was left on the cold cave floor.While he was inside a dark cave, Baek Joong-hyuk's father said, \u201cYou are the son of the Heavenly Demon. If you are truly worthy as my successor, prove yourself from the cold bottom and survive. Listen carefully, I have 12 sons. If one of you dies, nothing will change, and even if all twelve of my sons die, I will just create another son. So, remember this. Domination is the only way to prove your worth to me.\u201dThe 12th son.The life of Baek Joong-hyuk, the youngest of the 12, began like that.He was desperate.The children who lived together in the cave did not take care of each other because they were the sons of the Heavenly Demon, and they lived a life of brute force, competing by stealing each other's things.At that time, Baek Joong-hyuk was very weak.His dwarf physique made it difficult to win in competition with others, but Baek Joong-hyuk instinctively knew what to do.To reveal his presence.He knew that even though his strength was weak, he could reign if he inflated his body greatly and showed malice to others.And just like that, Baek Joong-hyuk smashed the head of the strongest child with a stone.Blood was dripping from the stone as it was struck several times, and the children around him looked at Baek Joong-hyuk in surprise.The king of the 12 sons.At that moment, Baek Joong-hyuk's position was decided.Baek Joong-hyuk always revealed himself and survived to the end despite numerous threats.The Heavenly Demon was born through adversity.If he hadn't walked the thorny path, Baek Joong-hyuk knew he would not have ascended to the throne of the Heavenly Demon.\u2018There is no such thing as perfect preparation in the world. In the reality I know, it is only important to prove myself to the best of my ability.\u2019In the new life of Baek Joong-hyuk, his interests were familiar and far from ordinary.But did he want his new life to be normal?That's funny.The life he has lived previously has made Baek Joong-hyuk who he is today, and now he has become a person who cannot live an ordinary life.Roman.With his new name, he had no intention of hiding himself at all.For this incident, only a little explanation was needed.Based on the information he had heard from Hans, Roman gave an answer that people could understand with common sense.\u201cActually, I was doing swordsmanship training separately.\u201d\u201cWhy were you hiding that? If you had told me, as your father, I would definitely have given you full support.\u201d\"I know. However, there was a time when I was distracted and wandered aimlessly, so I could not confidently ask for something from my father. People called me Dmitry's Fool. For my own greed, I wanted to show you that I could do certain things on my own, and although I was self-taught, I would be able to reach a certain level.\u201dIt was an ambiguous answer.Are you saying you learned swordsmanship by yourself?Given that Roman had the power to deal with Blood Fang with his swordsmanship, the question was not quickly resolved.\u201cHow did you deal with Blood Fang?\u201d\u201cAccording to my research, I found out that Blood Fang was not a group whose members had strong trust in each other. Intimidation and conciliation that started from the bonds formed a small organization, and a small number of leaders took full control of that organization. It was like a sand castle, and most of the members were scoundrels. I thought that cutting off its head would destroy it at once, so I lured them with a bait and attacked Ben Miles directly.\u201d\u201cBen Miles? You mean you lured him in?\u201d\"Yes. Blood Fang has shown a clear pattern of behavior in the past. A powerful noble family kept their notoriety by keeping their mouths shut when they touched a member of the gang, and by always retaliating for friction with a noble aristocrat. It's a bit embarrassing to say, but I'm called Dmitry's Fool. I was sure they would come after me. So I used myself as bait, and when the troops were dispersed, I attacked Ben Miles and cut off the head of the group.\u201d\u201cIt was a very risky plan. If they had decided to take revenge, they would have given up on Ben Miles and tried to kill you anyway.\"His heart sank.Roman's plan.It was extremely dangerous.Baron Romero's eyebrows trembled at the fact that his son had made and executed it.Roman said, \u201cAs father said, it was a risky plan. So, if father could grasp my actions, I thought that the Dmitry Knights would move. And such information must have been delivered directly to the Blood Fang\u2019s leader. Now, I ask you, father. If you were a member of the Blood Fang with no idea when the Dmitry Knights would arrive, would you risk your life to rescue the leader, Ben Miles? The premise of my plan was that they were sandcastles. There is no reason for them to risk their lives when they became a gang member through intimidation and pressure if they could regain their freedom by simply ignoring their leader\u2019s death.\u201dThe explanation was similar to reality.Roman had attacked Blood Fang.There was no inducement, and after slaughtering all the enemies that filled the space, he secured Ben Miles, who was about to run away.Subsequently, the members of Blood Fang abandoned Ben Miles.As Roman explained, in a situation where the gang members did not know when the Dmitry Knights would arrive, they couldn\u2019t delay themselves any longer.Some of the explanation was true, but most of it was a lie.Roman solved the situation with common sense.The fact that Dmitry's Fool killed Blood Fang with pure force does not end with revealing himself but may raise suspicions about his existence.So he gave a realistic answer.It seemed plausible that he caught the leader himself, and he did not deny the fact that he had done it himself.The explanation is over.Baron Romero, who questioned it over and over, as if in disbelief, was unable to speak for a while.\u201cSon.\u201dHe was thrilled.Roman.The sore thumb.The son he thought couldn\u2019t do anything had executed such a plan flawlessly.Baron Romero had never given up on his son.This feeling in his heart and his action of even striking his son across his face revealed Baron Romeo\u2019s true feelings.\u201cYou did a really great job. My son has done what no one else in this land has been able to do.\u201dIs it because of excitement?He wanted to see his son's transformation for himself.\u201cCan I ask for something?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI want to check your swordsmanship skills. How my son has changed, what kind of sword he used to deal with Blood Fang. Knights\u2019 Commander, Jonathan, can you prepare the Dalian right now?\u201d\"That is possible.\"The gaze turned to Roman again.A father\u2019s heart.Roman understood it.A son who was called a fool has accomplished something, and he must, of course, want to see it for himself.Roman nodded.\"I understand.\"A new life.Roman was faithful to his new reality.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 - Change (4)The knights' training ground.The knights, who had been training for a long time, bowed to show respect to the people who visited them.Clack Clack.\u201cWe greet the lord.\u201d\u201cWe greet the lord.\u201dThe Dmitry family.In terms of the entire kingdom of Cairo, it was only a small estate on the outskirts, but the status of the Dmitry family within the estate was tremendous.In particular, the respect received from the Dmitry Knights was the highest in the area.The respect for Baron Romero in their hearts could be understood just by looking at the knights who formed the ranks in perfect harmony.The Knights\u2019 Commander, Jonathan, came forward and announced, \u201cToday, we are going to conduct a swordsmanship battle with Young Master Roman. Those who wish to duel with him should come forward.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThere were no volunteers.Jonathan's words were so sudden that the knights glanced at each other with puzzled expressions.It was, of course, natural.The opponent was Roman Dmitry.They wouldn\u2019t gain anything even if they won, and if they lost, they would need to worry about being kicked out from the Dmitry Knights.Aside from their respect for Baron Romero, they didn't want to be a puppet in Roman\u2019s banter.\u201cIf there are no volunteers, I will choose Young Master Roman\u2019s opponent myself.\u201dJonathan's eyes scanned through the knights.Excluding Jonathan, the Dmitry Knights consisted of 15 people.They were called knights, but including Jonathan, only two people had actually received a knighthood.The remaining 14 were, on paper, commoners. Of course, they all hoped for a knighthood, but their skills were still lacking in many areas.The problem was the current situation.If it were the old Roman, it would be okay to call anyone and get it over with. However, now that Roman had changed, he could not be evaluated easily.\u2018I can\u2019t let the lord see the Dmitry Knights being easily defeated by the young master. Therefore, the young master's opponent must be a strong person who can completely subdue him. Only then will we be able to preserve the prestige of the Dmitry Knights and prove the true skill of Young Master Roman, who subjugated the Blood Fang.\u2019In fact, he wanted to go out and test his skills himself.However, the Knights' Commander, Jonathan, was not in a position to draw a sword recklessly. Therefore, he had no choice but to swallow his regret.He made his decision.From the time he accepted Baron Romero's proposal, he had already decided who Roman's opponent would be.\u201cChris, come forward.\u201d\u201c\u2026Me?\"Chris was called.The blond, handsome man distorted his expression at Jonathan's call.Chris.He doubted his ears.He's not just any ordinary knight; to think the commander would call on the vice leader of the knights.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s something I should do.\u201dInsubordination was an extremely serious issue.Normally, he would have obeyed the commander\u2019s orders without any complaints, but he couldn\u2019t accept them this time.The reason was simple.It was because the opponent was Roman.Even Chris, who truly loved Dmitry's people, hated him.\u2018Only if he wasn\u2019t Lord Dmitry\u2019s son.\u2019A long time ago, Chris had gotten into an incident involving Roman.A violent incident broke out in the night-time, and the cause of it was Roman Dmitry.Roman was making a fuss while drunk, and being Dmitry's eldest son meant no one could touch him.When other people were waiting idly, Chris, who was on patrol with the guards, discovered the scene. He needed to solve the problem of the territory, and while he was courting Roman with a respectful attitude, he suddenly got a hot shock on his cheek.Slap!He had been slapped suddenly.Seeing Roman screaming at him while asking how he dared to touch his body, he genuinely felt the urge to kill him.However, he had to suppress it.Roman Dmitry.He was, without a doubt, an asshole; however, he was also a man who had the surname of Dmitry.Chris showed utmost patience and solved the case safely, but from then on, he hated Roman Dmitry enough to get goosebumps whenever someone talked about him.Moreover, even the Knights\u2019 Commander, Jonathan, didn't know about it.Intrinsically, he thought he would be excluded from the competition, but a voice of protest inevitably came out when the commander chose him.Jonathan said, \u201cYoung Master Roman is a person who is strong enough to defeat the Blood Fang by himself. In order to compete on an equal footing, a competent person must come forward, and the person who can represent the Dmitry Knights is you, Chris.\u201d\u201cThis Blood Fang incident\u2014\u201d\"Chris.\"Jonathan's expression hardened.Chris understood that it meant he would not take no for an answer.He bowed his head.'Damn it.'\"I understand.\"With the Blood Fang incident, Roman's actions became famous even among the knights.There was even a debate about whether Roman possessed such great strength that he could have dealt with Blood Fang alone; however, Chris adamantly rejected that.Didn't he know from his own experience?I was slapped in the face by Roman just two years ago. Back then, I realized that was the strength of an ordinary person who had never trained with a sword.Win or lose?I am not worried about that.However, I want to teach him a proper lesson since I got the opportunity.\u201cI have some conditions.\u201d\u201cWhat are they?\u201d\u201cI was taught to always fight as if my life was on the line. No matter who my opponent is, I have no intention of going easy on them, even if it\u2019s just a spar. If you allow this, I will accept the honor of sparring with Young Master Roman Dmitry.\u201dGlance.Jonathan\u2019s gaze shifted toward Baron Romero.As he nodded, Jonathan confirmed his will.But\u2026Pfft.'You\u2019re laughing?'Roman just laughed.It was obvious that it meant he was fine with those conditions.His reaction made Chris even more angry.Chris wasn\u2019t dumb.He knew Roman was Lord Dmitry\u2019s son.He had no intention of destroying him horribly in front of the lord he served.But.Seeing him laugh, he forgot all reason.\u2018This bastard.\u2019A blonde, handsome man.Contrary to his appearance that looked like he couldn't even wield a sword properly, he was called Dmitry's fighting dog.It meant he was a man who always finished the fights he started.People were worried about Roman fighting against such a powerful opponent.Two men faced each other at the training ground, holding wooden swords.Finally, I will get to teach him a lesson.Tap.\"Start!\"The spar began.Chris, who had been waiting for the signal with his hands and legs twitching, immediately slammed them into the ground at Jonathan's signal.Tap tap.\u2018I\u2019ll show you the difference in our level.\u2019It was at an incredible speed.Chris closed the distance with Roman in an instant, and in the blink of an eye of the onlookers, he swung his sword toward Roman's forearm.Fortunately, it was an attack that avoided a vital point.Thinking that Roman would not be able to stop such a sudden and quick attack, he made a rational decision to choose a part that would not cause a problem even if he was injured.However.Clack!\u2018\u2026Clack?!'He suddenly felt an opposing force in his hands.Roman and Chris' gazes intertwined in the air.At the sight of Roman, who did not even blink despite the surprise attack, Chris got goosebumps for a moment.Swish!Swoosh!Chris made a quick recovery and consequently made an attack that swung toward Roman horizontally; however, Roman calmly blocked the attack this time as well.The block this time was certainly not a coincidence.From the force transmitted through his hand, he understood the defense posture of Roman was quite stable.\u2018What is this?\u2019It was unexpected.I didn't know that Roman knew the basics of swordsmanship.I never believed it was Roman who actually subjugated Blood Fang.Chris knew that if that was true, it would mean Roman was as powerful as Jonathan. However, now that he faced him in a fight, it didn't matter anymore.The spar had already begun.Chris felt that his anger would only be relieved by defeating Roman.Clack Clack.Tap tap tap!While taking aggressive steps, he continuously swung down attacks from above. Those who were watching the fast and powerful combo attack burst into an exclamation, and Roman stepped back while urgently blocking the attacks. His defense was undoubtedly good. However, the moment Roman took the fifth step back, Chris' eyes suddenly lit up.\u2018Now.\u2019Swoosh!The final blow.He attacked the gap Roman showed for an instant.He was sure the attack would work this time; however, the wooden sword only slashed through Roman's hair.Fwoosh.His hair blew in the wind.Aside from that, only Roman's cold eyes could be seen.Chris didn\u2019t know why but even though he could properly grasp Roman's movements with the naked eye, he instinctively swung his sword to block him.Clack!'How?!'Suddenly, Roman was right in front of him.Roman's sword quickly swung toward Chris' head. It was a powerful attack that would have ended the match if it had not been blocked. Chris now understood that Roman was not only good at defense. His attacking basics were excellent, too, and as soon as the attack was blocked, he disappeared from Chris' view. He sidestepped out of Chris\u2019 sight as if he was flowing water. Then, he swung his wooden sword from bottom to top. Chris caught his breath at the abnormal attack.\u201cKeuk.\u201dSwoosh!He was stunned.Is this Roman's skill?He couldn't believe it even though he saw it with his own eyes.\u2018This feels like shit.\u2019He clenched his teeth.He didn't want to lose.It was unacceptable to be defeated by none other than Dmitry's Fool in front of other people.I will wait for the perfect time.While counterattacking, Roman always aimed at Chris\u2019 gaps.It was then.Shwoop!A wide-open chest.Roman's actions were large.Chris took his first step to counter him, thinking now was the right time.Smirk.\u2018\u2026!\u2019Roman smiled.Chris instinctively knew.This is a trap.This is dangerous.Seeing Roman casually dodging his attack and immediately counterattacking, Chris instinctively released his suppressed power.Slam!Kurreung.Explosions occured inside his body.It was the manifestation of the aura.What differentiated Chris from ordinary knights was his 1-star aura.It was the power that made humans superhuman.As Chris released his aura, Jonathan, who was watching, widened his eyes.\"Don\u2019t do it!\"It was too dangerous.The clash of aura and wooden swords.The result is obvious.Not only will the wooden sword be shattered, but also, you don't know what injuries Roman will face in the aftermath of that power.The fact that it's not an actual sword doesn't matter. The power of aura enables the user to cut through people with just a wooden sword.His heart was pounding.This was a mistake.If he had known that Roman was no match for Chris, he would have given up and dueled with Roman himself.However, just then.Step.Roman leaped toward Chris.Even in the face of a blow aimed at his life, he did not hesitate to move forward.Just one step caused a miracle.Roman's face was slightly cut, some blood splattered, and he attacked Chris, who was stained with embarrassment and astonishment.The fight was over.He had disarmed Chris.Chris would have fought back if he still held his sword, but he couldn\u2019t make any excuses now. His defeat was as clear as crystal.However, Roman didn\u2019t let things pass just like that.\u201cThose who show hostility must be eliminated.\u201dIt was the rule of Baek Joong-hyuk, the Heavenly Demon.Even if he didn't kill him, he had to pay the price for making Roman fight with his life on the line.Swing!Crack!\u201cKeuk?!\u201dThe wooden sword exploded in his face.Chris, who was hit with the sudden blow, rose to his feet. He noticed his face was splattered with warm blood, and a few teeth were scattered on the ground.Many people often said that Chris, who was a disciple of Jonathan, a three-star knight, was Dmitry's greatest genius since he developed the two-star aura at a young age.He was later evaluated as a talent who would rise beyond Dmitry to earn fame in the kingdom of Cairo. Even in Dmitry, it was clearly visible that there was no one who could match him other than Jonathan.And someone like that suddenly fell backward.The dilated pupil clearly showed that he had lost consciousness.Flop!Chris had been knocked out.And then.\u201c\u2026What in the world?\u201dJonathan's expression was stained with astonishment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12 - Ki and Mana (1)The final attack.Even though it lasted only a brief moment, Jonathan clearly saw how Roman counterattacked.\u2018It can\u2019t be.'It was just one step.Moreover, that spot was the only safe place.If he stepped back, he would\u2019ve been hit by the wooden sword enveloped by Aura, and even if he moved sideways, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to escape the range of the attack.Auras were explosive powers.Aura's eruption was specialized for instantaneous power, and the longer the distance it would cover, the more power would be transmitted. This fact made it even more disadvantageous to try and block it.Of course, he thought the attack would be dangerous for Roman, who was only an ordinary person. However, the sight that had unfolded before him was much more different than his expectations.He destroyed the possibility of Chris\u2019 attack being completely unleashed.Just taking one step prevented his opponent from fully unleashing his powers, and with a slight twist of his body, he boldly evaded the attack right in front of his eyes.It was really dangerous.However, even in a situation where his face might be smashed in, Roman managed to subdue Chris while maintaining an unshakable posture.It was astonishing.It was literally unbelievable.Jonathan could not accept the reality that unfolded right in front of him.\u2018\u2026I didn't know anything about Young Master Roman all this time.'Roman was a fool.Since he had personally taught him, he knew Roman was someone who had no talent. Due to that, he felt terrible and gave up on him without even making an effort.However, the Roman who was in front of him right now was different.Roman not only had the temperament of a fighter who never gave up, but even his basic skills as a swordsman were excellent and sharp.A counterattack that knocked down the opponent in a brief moment could never be compared to something like a lucky punch.The person must have excellent basics and the ability to quickly put their thoughts into action to succeed in battles this quickly.A solid defense.An attack flowing as naturally as water.Jonathan became certain.Roman's skill was not something that could be manifested by training for one or two years. It was obvious that much more time had been put into training than just a few years.\u2018When did he grow up like this?\u2019Jonathan thought back to the events of a month ago.In fact, even back then, I only saw Roman wandering the streets while he was drunk.He clearly remembered how pathetic he was.His notoriety of being Dmitry's Fool grew even worse when he saw him chanting loudly.In Jonathan\u2019s memory, Roman was nothing more than a pathetic human being.But now, starting with the Blood Fang incident, even Chris, an Aura Knight, had been defeated.It was then.Baron Romero, who had been watching the duel together with Jonathan, said with a bewildered expression.\u201cKnights\u2019 Commander, Jonathan.\u201d\"Yes, my lord.\"\u201cWhat the hell just happened? How did Roman defeat Chris? Wasn\u2019t the vice commander a 2-Stars Aura Knight that Dmitry is proud of?\u201dHonestly, he was feeling the same as him.Baron Romero needed an explanation for the unbelievable sight that took place before him.He wanted to hear directly from Jonathan how his son had grown so fast.There was a slight hesitation for a moment.Then, Jonathan looked at Roman and Baron Romero alternately with complicated eyes and finally gave out the most plausible answer after much thought.\u201c\u2026It seems that Young Master Roman is a genius in swordsmanship.\u201dRoman caught his breath.His cheek was stinging.He noticed blood was dripping from the thin cut when he raised his hand to touch the painful area.\u2018Pathetic.\u2019Chris.He wasn't so bad.He knew how to aggressively push his opponent, and his eyes to read the flow of the fight were quite sharp.However, the thing is.\u2018He\u2019s not bad only by the standards of this world.\u2019He knew how strong he was because he had dealt with the Blood Fang crew, including Ben Miles.If it was Chris, he could wipe out dozens of them with his skill.He seemed to be the strongest of all the people, excluding Jonathan, whom Roman had encountered in this world.But, what about Baek Joong-hyuk\u2019s standards?The worst.Even if he picked the lowest soldiers of the Heavenly Demon Cult, they would be much stronger than Chris.The eruption of Aura at the end was a bit threatening, but it was sloppy compared to the techniques used in Murim.'At the end, that was a pretty sloppy eruption of energy. It\u2019s similar to Ki, but I don\u2019t understand why he used it like that. I think it's the power of mana that Hans talked about. However, this world uses it in a much different way than Murim does.'I was curious.Let\u2019s see.I want to find out about it.To survive in the world, it was necessary for Roman to know exactly what kind of power his opponents would be using.However, just then.\u201cHahahaha.\u201dBaron Romero's laughter was heard.He was thrilled after hearing his son was a swordsmanship genius by none other than the Knights\u2019 Commander, Jonathan.\u201cOh my god. To hear that my eldest son is a genius in swordsmanship. Commander Jonathan, are you really sure of that?\u201d\"Yes, my lord. No other reason can explain the growth of Young Master Roman. In the meantime, it seems that I have not been able to recognize the true skills of Young Master Roman because my abilities are lacking. Young Master Roman is, without a doubt, a genius.\u201d\"Is that so? To think my son really is a genius.\u201dHis face suddenly got brighter.Baron Romero looked at Roman proudly and signaled him to come closer.\u201cSon.\u201d\"Yes, father.\"\u201cI've never been in a better mood than today. I am extremely proud of you. As even the Knights\u2019 Commander admitted it, I want to applaud the fact that my son, Roman, accomplished something by himself, and not because he\u2019s a genius in swordsmanship. If there's anything you want, tell me now. A reward should definitely be given. For the sake of my special son, I will prepare a special reward for you.\u201dRomero Dmitry.This was his true personality.He was angry at the behavior of his son, but he was a fool who was recognized by all.He was not good at raising children, so he couldn't express his feelings properly. However, there was no doubt that he truly loved Roman.A reward.The table was set.Usually, he would receive rewards with a smile, but Roman's reaction today was slightly different.A reward, huh.Roman wasn\u2019t familiar with this world, but when Baron Romero mentioned a reward, something came to his mind.\u201cI am aware that my enlistment in the military is inevitable as my marriage to the Lawrence family has been broken. My two younger brothers, who left for the capital, cannot fulfill their military service duties either, so I will have to leave for the battlefield in six months. So, I request you to give me the authority to choose the troops I'm going to take with me. Also, I would like you to support the costs generated during the process as well.\u201dIt was a straightforward request.Baron Romero looked startled at the fairly specific proposal.\u201c\u2026Huh.\u201dMilitary service obligations.It was a bittersweet reality just thinking about it.As the Dmitry estate belonged to the kingdom of Cairo, it had no choice but to share the dangers faced by the kingdom as well.That was an unavoidable reality.Married nobles could be temporarily exempted from military service, but Roman's view of trying to avoid the military service had suddenly changed.Nevertheless, Romero wanted to believe in his changed son.In Roman\u2019s life, what he could do as a father was to help him soar.\"I understand. I will grant you full authority for the matters related to the military service.\u201d\u201cAlso, I have one last request.\u201d\u201cTell me. This father could do anything for my son if you continue to show a side of you like this.\u201dWas it because his expectations were previously low?Baron Romero's faith was blind.Roman smiled lightly and looked at Chris lying on the floor.\u201cI want to learn Aura in the future. So, for private tutoring, please assign me that swordsman I dueled.\u201dThis new world.Now is the time to get to know this world a little more.How much time has passed?Chris opened his eyes.As the blue sky was pouring down on his eyes, he burst into tears without realizing it.\u201cWow, this is fucking embarrassing.\u201dDefeat.It was an uncomfortable reality.The fact that he was defeated by no one else but by Dmitry's Fool made him want to hide his face even in a mouse hole.But what can I do?This is reality.The fact that he was defeated by Roman would never change.After he woke up, he saw his own reflection in the mirror. He looked miserable.He was often called handsome, but now he could only see a fool with two missing front teeth in the mirror.This was a situation worse than any normal defeat. He hurriedly found his broken teeth, but there was no way to put them back into their place.\u201c...Should I just die?\u201dIt was a moment of serious concern.The problems didn\u2019t end with just that.Even though he couldn\u2019t escape the abyss of despair, an order was suddenly given to him, which was as straightforward as possible.\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cI know how you feel. However, this is the command of Lord Dmitry, Chris.\u201d\u201cKnights Commander\u2019\u2014No. Master, this can\u2019t be right. I understand that I was somehow defeated by Young Master Roman and have become a fool with missing front teeth. But are you saying that I need to teach Young Master Roman about Aura? This is unacceptable. Even if my head is blown away as a punishment for opposing you and the lord, I won\u2019t accept it.\u201dHe laid flat on the floor.It was a desperate will.He truly didn't want to see Roman's face again.He had a bad relationship with him in the first place, so losing to Roman felt more humiliating than anything else.Jonathan said, \u201cThen, I will make an offer to you.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cGo and understand exactly how he changed so much under the pretext of teaching Roman. As long as you handle this matter well, I will allow you to learn the secret skill that I have been putting off until now.\u201d\u201c...Are you serious?\u201d\"Of course.\"\"Damn it.\"Chris jumped up from his seat.The secret skill.It was the secret that made Jonathan into a 3-Stars Aura Knight.Chris, who had always longed for his secret skill, could not refuse Jonathan's offer.He spoke in an annoyed voice.\u201cYou can\u2019t take this back.\u201dAt this moment, Chris crossed a river of no return.The next day.Chris met Roman in the training field.But\u2026Pfft.Roman just laughed.For a moment, Chris\u2019 eyes twitched, but he managed to suppress his anger.For quite some time, the two didn't talk at all, just looked at each other's faces, but Roman\u2019s suppressed smile was obvious.\u2018Fuck this.\u2019The wind blew through the place where two front teeth were supposed to be.Chris already regretted accepting the offer, but he knew that in order to achieve his goal, he had to take on the worst.Calming his boiling anger, Chris said with a nonchalant face.\u201cNow, let me explain about Aura.\u201dAura.It was a branch of mana and also the power used by Aura Knights.If wizards store mana in their magic circles, knights basically spread mana throughout their bodies.\u201cThe inventor of Aura was Emperor Alexander, who is called the harbinger. Unlike wizards1, he was the first to figure out how to strengthen the human body by spreading mana throughout his body. Aura is a power that instantaneously releases this mana. Mana, which was normally spread throughout the body, is released in an instant according to the user's will, creating a powerful force.\u201d\u201c...\u201dRoman's attitude was serious.He didn't take any offense to Chris' explanation or show a playful attitude.When Chris started teaching, Roman showed a serious side. Due to this, his animosity subsided to a certain extent.\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s not important to know the history of Aura. Mana is a power that only the chosen can use; one in thousand can walk the path of an Aura Knight, and one in ten thousand can walk the path of a wizard. Therefore, it is important to check if you have the qualifications first. The minimum requirement for an Aura Knight is to feel mana. It is usually at this stage that most people get frustrated. In my case, it took me half a year to feel mana, but in fact, if you just feel mana in a year, you would be considered above average. So, in the end, it mostly depends on talent.\u201dIt was a statement with a bit of arrogance.He was quite proud of himself.As Jonathan's disciple, when he felt mana for the first time in half a year, there was an uproar in Dmitry that a genius had appeared.Chris.He was such a person.However, Roman did not give him the reaction he wanted.\"You said 1 year. That means the possibility of becoming or not becoming an Aura Knight will be decided in that time.\u201d\"That\u2019s correct. If you don't feel mana within a year, it would be within your best interests to give up the path of an Aura Knight.\"\u201cThen, can you explain what you did after you felt mana? Can you explain the way you experienced it?\u201d\"Of course.\"His confidence went down a little.However, it was fine.Once Roman started mana training, the winner would be inevitably decided. It would either be Roman or Chris.\u2018Even if Young Master Roman is a genius in swordsmanship, mana talent is a different matter. This training will give you a taste of the harshness of reality. And as the years go by without feeling mana, you will realize how great a person I am. Heh heh heh, thinking about it now, this wasn't a bad offer at all.'He was so excited.In the past, he had seen many people who were desperate for mana training.Roman was no different.Chris hid his true thoughts and taught him how to train his mana.\u201cThe mana training method\u2026\u201dWith Chris' teaching, Roman gradually began to immerse himself in his own world.Wizards\u2019 bodies are usually much weaker than those of Aura Knights. This is because wizards usually store mana in the magic circles, focusing it on a single place. However, Aura Knights spread it throughout their body, resulting in the body becoming much stronger than that of a normal person.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13 - Ki and Mana (2)Honestly, the premise of this training was wrong from the beginning.Roman had already felt the mana of this world, and he had even accumulated a small amount of mana through the Heavenly Demon God Art.Still, he had a reason to be taught by Chris.\u2018Blindly following only my common sense is a shortcut to regression. In Murim, it is called Ki, and in this world, I need to experience a similar power expressed as mana and Aura. From start to finish, I should do it in the way of this world. Even if I can't understand it in my head, I should follow their way, for now at least.'He abandoned his common sense.Chris' teaching was utterly different from Murim's, but Roman did not want to remain bound by a particular method.He took several breaths.Chris had told him it was important to feel something tickling his skin. That was the process of feeling mana in the Salamander Continent, and even though Roman didn't breathe out a few times, mana eventually gathered around him. Truthfully, it was natural. As Roman had lived his whole life assimilating the energy of nature, he knew what kind of character it had and how to induce mana.Less than a minute.The time it took Chris to reach 1-Star was one year; however, Roman had accomplished the same in less than a minute.After feeling the mana around him, he began the induction of mana.He accepted it.When the foreign and mysterious energy entered his body, Roman guided it throughout his body and along the blood vessels.\u2018It\u2019s definitely different from Murim. In Murim, the purpose is to remove waste from the blood vessels by controlling mana and ultimately build it up in the lower abdomen. But this world is different. In the process of inducing mana, people want mana to naturally accumulate in various parts of the body. However, there is no binding force. Is there any particular reason for doing this? The energy that settled would be easy for people to control, but when doing it this way, there\u2019s no way they will be able to reach the peak of their abilities.In short, the method was much more inefficient than Murim\u2019s.There was also a problem with the characteristics of mana of this world.If Murim\u2019s mana is described as heavy but barren, this world's mana is light but rich.No matter how much mana is absorbed, a similar amount is lost inevitably.In his heart, he wanted to grab it all.However.\u2018Let\u2019s try the method of this world.\u2019He suppressed his desire.He knew he could go back to Murim\u2019s method whenever he wished.Roman knew better than anyone how to be strong, but it was time for him to embrace a new world.Suddenly, Chris' voice was heard.\u201cOnce you reach a stage where you can use a certain amount of mana, you will be able to manifest your Aura. Gathering the mana spread throughout the body at one point is known as the manifestation of Aura. Aura manifestation can be utilized in several ways. There is a way to increase the destructive power by overlaying Aura on the sword, or it can be applied to the body for instantaneous explosive power. What is certain is that the manifestation of Aura means that you have become a 1-Star Aura Knight.\u201dChris didn\u2019t know that Roman had already entered the stage of accumulating mana.He was merely explaining, but Roman was moving mana in the same way according to the explanation.He easily accepted mana from the surroundings.Moreover, Roman's binding power made it impossible for the mana circulating in the body to escape.Mana gradually built up.In an instant, Roman had entered the stage of Aura manifestation.Whoosh!His body started glowing blue.Even though it wasn't something Chris had taught him yet, he temporarily strengthened his body by concentrating his mana at one point.A familiar phenomenon.Roman had come up with a similar method.'It's similar to Murim\u2019s meditation but different. On the other hand, exercising is a way to achieve a stronger body, but the way Chris was talking about was neither one nor the other. It doesn't make your body stronger, nor can it build up mana on the inside. The method of releasing mana in an instant is very inefficient as the mana that is not gathered in one place from the beginning spreads out in all directions. The thought that came to my mind when I saw Chris manifesting his Aura was not wrong.\u2019He was certain.From his own experience, he was able to draw a firm conclusion.\u2018The method of using mana in this world is garbage.\u2019There was no reason to proceed any further with the training with Chris.When Roman manifested his Aura, Chris opened his eyes wide in shock.\u201cHuh?!\u201dWhen Chris started this training, he didn't even expect Roman to feel mana.According to him, it would\u2019ve been surprising even if Roman simply understood what kind of training it was and what Chris was talking about; however, now, something completely unexpected had happened.His skin is glowing with a bluish color.Chris knew what this meant. It was the characteristic of the manifestation of Aura.He rubbed his eyes and checked again, but the scene in front of him didn\u2019t change.\u2018Uh, how can this be possible?\u2019It was beyond common sense.It took him half a year to feel mana. Moreover, he had to train hard for three years to release it.Still, he was often called a genius.Being Jonathan's disciple from a young age, he steadily learned swordsmanship. Due to that, when he achieved 2-Star in his mid-twenties, everyone recognized him as a genius.But\u2026What the hell does this mean?Roman\u2019s progress right now couldn\u2019t be called an accident.\u201c...Phew.\u201dRoman slowly opened his eyes.Seeing him catch his breath, Chris asked as if he was waiting.\u201cHow did you do it? Did you really just manifest Aura?\u201d\u201cYou should know it better. You saw it in person.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the reason I am asking you that! I mean, it doesn't make sense. Someone released Aura after spending three and a half years, but Young Master Roman succeeded within 30 minutes. Tell me honestly. You already knew how to use Aura and just called me here to make fun of me, right? Ah, of course, now I understand. It was strange that I, a 2-Star Aura Knight, was defeated by the young master in the first place.\u201dHe just decided to believe his own guess.It was more plausible that Roman was a recluse master than a genius who could release Aura in 30 minutes.The problem was that this guess was also beyond common sense.So, two years ago, did Roman hide his power?But why?Chris' gaze on Roman became confused.\u201cCan you tell me the standard of the stars that distinguish the strength of an Aura Knight? What is the level of the stars I have achieved now, and how many stars are the skills of those who are currently called the best.\u201d\u201c...Once the Aura manifestation was successful, the young master met the conditions for a 1-Star Aura Knight. And if you manage to cut steel with Aura manifested on an object, you'll be called a 2-Star Aura Knight from then on. The real thing starts from 3-Star. Stars are classified according to the strength and destructive power of the Aura, and knights who manage to reach 3-Star receive special treatment within the kingdom. Therefore, the Knights' Commander, Jonathan, is an Aura Knight recognized by the kingdom. And 4-Star are also recognized by the kingdom. If you manage to achieve 5-Star, you are recognized by the entire continent. By the way, the ones who are called the strongest swordsmen on the continent are known as 6-Star swordsmen. No one is known to have reached beyond that level yet.\u201d6-Star. Those who had achieved it were called the strongest of this continent.As Roman had already met Jonathan, he could picture their power in his mind.\u2018Based on Murim\u2019s standards, Jonathan is slightly inferior to second-rate warriors. No matter how highly rated the 6-Star Aura Knight is, it is definitely not at the level I expected. Perhaps the main martial art of this world is not swordsmanship. It was said that if an aura is a talent per thousand, then magic is a talent per ten thousand. You will know for sure only when you experience them yourself.\u2019It was fun to hear.He had found a different path than Murim.He wanted to go out into the world and experience everything related to that and other similar paths.\u201cTo be honest, star distinctions are not a perfect indication of strength. There is a thing called ranking on this continent. Although the 6-Star Aura Kfnights are called the best on the continent, not all of the knights in the top 10 rankings have reached the 6-Star level. Anyway, since when did you start honing your mana? It took me 10 years to reach the level of 2-Star. Even I, who is called a genius, was like this, but considering the appearance of the young master I met two years ago, this doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201dChris' words made sense.It was said that it took him 10 years to feel mana, release Aura, and manifest it through a sword.Pfft.Roman burst into laughter.If what Chris said was true, the level of this world was way below Roman\u2019s expectations.At Roman's reaction, Chris' face inevitably turned red.He didn't say it out loud, but he couldn\u2019t help but be angry seeing Roman laugh.\u201c...Why are you laughing?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s funny.\u201d\u201cDo you mean that my efforts are funny?\u201dThe atmosphere turned cold.Chris.He was called Dmitry's talent.Although Roman had defeated him, his pride was not broken yet.To Chris, who seemed to explode at any moment, Roman only responded with a smile.\u201cI will ask you one thing. Have you ever had any doubts about the way you trained while getting to your current level?\u201d\"What do you mean?\"\u201cSometimes people inevitably misunderstand things. Just because it\u2019s a method that has been passed down from generation to generation, people often believe the illusion that it is unconditionally correct. I had that doubt while learning how to train mana from you. Why are you insisting on me using the method I can see as lacking? Didn't you have any doubts? Or is it because you strongly trust the Knights\u2019 Commander, Jonathan, who taught you?\u201d\u201c...\u201dIt was an unexpected statement.Chris, who was trying to let out his anger, was hit with the sudden question, but he couldn\u2019t say anything with his bewildered face.A different way of training.As Roman guessed, Chris had never questioned it.\u201cDo you know the reason? It\u2019s quite simple. It's just easy to follow. When someone follows the way which has already been through trial or error more than a thousand times, there is no reason for them to lose or be criticized if they decide to follow it too. I won\u2019t deny the fact that you have worked hard for ten years. However, I can\u2019t help but find it funny that in the process of doing so, you never questioned the way you pursued even once. In this world, there is no perfect answer. The path you chose to follow blindly is, in the end, a path that only started when someone decided to go through troubles.\"Before Roman was called the Heavenly Demon, he did not follow his father's teachings.Even though his father was a person who had reached the pinnacle of the Heavenly Demon Cult, he continued to analyze and study techniques on his own.After his constant efforts, Roman finally created his own Heavenly Demon Martial Arts.Even those who had criticized Roman's actions at first eventually exclaimed in admiration for the perfect and unbelievable power of the Heavenly Demon Martial Arts.Roman had always lived his life like that.Don\u2019t just blindly believe others.He did not accept it just because it was passed down from generation to generation, but he pondered why he had to accept it and whether it was truly the best option for him.Of course, such questions made his life much more painful than an ordinary person's.I had to go through trial and error repeatedly, and whenever I met a failed result, I had to taste the despair and criticism from others.However, even so, change was necessary.As if he knew that something handed down from ancestors had started with a question, Roman always threw a question on himself when learning.\u201cI will ask you once again. Did you really try your best for the past 10 years?\u201d\u201c...\u201dChris was left speechless.He looked back on his life.Of course, Chris had worked extremely hard.However.The training method Chris followed at that time always relied on blind faith.He always did as Jonathan told him to. Even this time, he had only accepted to teach Roman so he could learn the secret trick from Jonathan.Roman had hit the nail on his head.1Despite his remarks against the world's ways, he could not refute what Roman said.'It's not a bad way to follow the knowledge passed down from generation to generation. Chris may grow steadily like this and rise to the heights of what others call a genius. But that's it. People who do not question their own lives cannot reign at the apex. Chris is one of the strongest people I have met so far, but frogs in wells are bound to rot in the end.\u2019Roman\u2019s advice was out of pure goodwill.Since Chris had helped him, Roman helped him realize the reality of his situation.From now on, it's up to Chris.If he decides not to accept reality and stays angry due to his pride, he won\u2019t be able to become much stronger in the future.\u201cLet\u2019s finish this training.\u201dRoman finished talking.And then, just as Roman was about to walk away, Chris asked, \u201c...Then, please tell me the correct answer. What am I supposed to do from now on?\u201dAt Chris\u2019 question, Roman halted and looked at him again.Pfft.\u2018How interesting.\u2019He just let go of his pride.This has suddenly become a critical matter.Chris, who could have been just a passing person in Roman\u2019s life, for some reason, looked different right now.To hit the nail on the head means to be exactly right about something.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14 - Ki and Mana (3)It was peculiar.Just like how he had thought of the Crazy Demon while looking at the boy named Kevin, he was suddenly reminded of someone else when he looked at Chris just now.\u2018He resembles the Blood Demon.\u2019The Blood Demon and the Crazy Demon.They were two of the strongest subordinates who followed Roman in his previous life.While the Crazy Demon was called that because he would throw himself into a fire if it was Roman\u2019s command, the Blood Demon was already a strong master in the Murim before he met Roman and started following him.He was the head of the Blood Demon Cult. Due to their opposing positions, it was inevitable for him to clash with Roman to decide on the ruler of the unified Demonic Cult. Finally, the Heavenly Demon and the Blood Demon began their battle on the vast plains.The battle was fierce.One step of the Blood Demon turned the ground upside down, and the moment he swung his sword, the sky roared as if it would split.However, that day, the Blood Demon was defeated for the first time in his life.He was a historical figure who had unified the Blood Demon Cult, but the power of Baek Joong-hyuk, the Heavenly Demon, was beyond belief.A Demon God.The Blood Demon eventually fell to his knees.He, spitting out blood, looked up at the Heavenly Demon and said, \u201c...In my whole life, it's the first time I've seen a guy as strong as you. I admit my defeat. From now on, the Blood Demon Cult will follow the Heavenly Demon, Baek Joong-hyuk. Please tell me\u2014how can I become as strong as you? I will follow you regardless of your answer, but it will be beneficial for both of us if I get stronger.\u201dHe was a cheeky but unique person.While facing death, the Blood Demon abandoned his pride and asked how to become stronger.At first, I didn't like the attitude of the Blood Demon, but I realized he was not a person who deceived others with his words.From then on, he blindly followed the Heavenly Demon. He also put down his pride in being the pinnacle of the Blood Demon Cult and tried to become even stronger.Thanks to that, the Demonic Cult\u2019s conquest of Murim became much easier.The head of the Namgung Sega1, known as one of the three great masters of the righteous sects, was killed by the sword of the Blood Demon, not Baek Joong-hyuk, the Heavenly Demon.Chris and the Blood Demon.They were really similar.His flushed face couldn't hide his wounded pride, but his desire to become stronger suppressed it.'Expressing one's desire straightforwardly is the most human one can be.'He liked it.Roman had always liked honest people. They were the ones who confidently requested Roman to fulfill their wishes while standing beside him. They were much better than those who told him they wished for nothing other than standing beside him but would betray Roman in a matter of seconds behind his back.Whatever the purpose of their wishes was didn't matter to Roman; if he deemed it reasonable, he wouldn't hesitate to fulfill them.If they wished for money, he would give them money, and those who wanted to become stronger would be guided for that.The fact was that the stronger their desires were, the less likely they would betray him.Why?It was because they knew how their betrayal would end.People with strong desires and wishes quickly faced reality, and they understood Roman was a mountain they couldn't dare climb.\u2018What should I do with this guy?\u2019His interest suddenly piqued.It was obvious that Chris hated him.They had some bad interactions in the past, but that didn't matter to Roman now. His desire to become stronger rather than staying like that was more important to him.Also.'His talent isn't bad.\u2019Chris' bones were strong.He was gifted with such promising talent that if he had steadily trained his martial arts in Roman's way, he would have already surpassed the level of Murim's first-class warriors.However, he isn't using his talent properly. He's just wasting it.Roman, who looked closely at Chris, said while smiling, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you the answer.\u201d\u201c...So, what should I do?\u201d\u201cI already told you. Don't blindly follow what someone tells you. If I tell you the answer, it will be no different from the life you've lived till now. So, if you want to find the answer, stay by my side from now on. When I leave for the battlefield in 6 months, make sure to pay close attention to how I become stronger while dealing with numerous enemies and defeating them simultaneously. If you remain by my side even after 10 years...\u201dChris' eyes shook.Roman looked straight at him.Then, he said in a clear voice, \u201cYou will definitely find your answer.\u201dThe training was over.Chris, left alone after Roman had gone, looked up at the blue sky and sighed deeply.\"Haa.\"War.It's something I have to experience someday.I know that it is the fate of a knight, but I never imagined that I would go to war alongside Dmitry's Fool.It would have been better if it was the second son.He would be proud to follow him, who already had a reputation in the capital, but the current situation was completely unacceptable.\u2018Make your own way.\u2019Roman's advice.It was the first time I had heard anything like that.Roman's remark had caused something to stir inside him. He had often heard others calling him a genius even though he had learned the techniques passed down from generation to generation.He tried to ignore Roman's words at first. Hearing him, he felt that the hard work and training he had done for years was being denied, so he dismissed it as nonsense; however, the more he listened to Roman's words, the faster his heart raced.He's not wrong. The knowledge passed down from generation to generation originally came from a human being.It's obvious that there is more than one way one can become a strong swordsman, so why did I always stick to Commander Jonathan's methods?If I had thought a little more and gone through trial and error by myself, I might have found a way that was more suitable for me.His mind was intricately intertwined.If only...If only Roman was a man of words, Chris wouldn't have been in so much pain.However, Roman, whom he had seen earlier, was not the kind of person who could be called Dmitry's fool.'The young master's talent was unbelievable. At first, I didn't understand how he became so strong in such a short time, but it's clearly visible that the young master, who had less muscular strength than ordinary people just two years ago, has completely changed. He might've had a talent for swordsmanship and Aura, considering he released it after training for less than an hour. However, it's not that he's been hiding his power since childhood; he must have found his own way.'The former possibility didn't make sense.There was no reason to hide his true power, and there was no reason to reveal it now.That only left the possibility that Roman had become this strong in a short period of time.Seeing Roman speak clearly while looking into his eyes, Chris gained trust that could not be described in words.For the rest of the day, Chris kept thinking of his problems.The sun went down and rose again.He even forgot to eat that day. Later, he finally made a decision and went somewhere with a haggard face.\u2018I want to be strong.\u2019That was his main goal in life.He was helpless.He visited his mentor, the Knights' Commander, Jonathan, and notified him that he would follow Roman to the battlefield in the future.Alright, let\u2019s do that.\u201c...Something must have happened.\u201dJonathan.He looked at Chris with a calm face.On a battlefield with corpses strewn about, Jonathan had seen a young boy weeping as he grabbed his mother's limp body. That was the first time he met Chris.He was a gifted kid and had a strong desire to be strong. Due to that, he grew up quickly.And Jonathan knew that he was like a father to him.So, there must have been a reason for Chris to leave his side and follow Roman.Mutual trust.Chris and Jonathan both trusted each other.Even if Chris didn't bother explaining why, Jonathan nodded his head.\u201cIf you say that, there must be a special reason. From now on, you will not belong to the Dmitry Knights. As Young Master Roman\u2019s escort, no matter what happens, remain by his side and achieve your desired purpose.\"\u201c...Thank you, Commander.\"Pfft.Jonathan laughed.Young child.The roughed-up boy had already grown up, and he felt saddened that he was leaving his side.\u201cThanks to you, I managed to learn one thing. Since you said you would follow Roman, then Young Master Roman is no longer the fool people used to call him. Make some time for yourself tomorrow. To survive on the battlefield, you must have at least one secret weapon.\u201d\u201c...Master!\u201dChris' eyes widened.No matter what kind of days awaited him, Jonathan was, no matter what anyone said, the teacher that Chris followed by heart.Half a year.When the time comes, Roman will leave Dmitry of his own will.Other nobles would weep and riot, but thinking of his departure, Roman's heart was already racing.\u2018I am a person who cannot grow like a flower in a greenhouse. I will be satisfied only when I experience many things and eventually lead a life in which I reign over everyone else. So, for the future, I must prepare myself starting now.\u2019Roman knew that there was no perfect preparation in the world. In the end, variables were inevitable.However, training yourself to overcome any adversity you face was a different matter.He was convinced that if he laid the groundwork to overcome any adversity, he would achieve his goal no matter what happened.After parting with Chris, Roman went to the library of the Dmitry estate.There he read various kinds of books.<...The 6-Star state means one has transcended human limits. The size of the Aura that erupts through the sword reaches tens of meters, and the attack that condenses and explodes mana in an instant is powerful enough to wipe out dozens of soldiers at once. There are currently 12 people on the continent known as 6-Star Aura Knights. They are known as the \"Twelve Swords of the Continent\" and are treated as distinguished guests in any country.>Twelve Swords of the Continent.They were strong people just by looking at the information written in the book.If they could release an Aura that reached several tens of meters even with an ineffective eruption of ki, they had undoubtedly reached the pinnacle of the unique way of using mana in this world.Although they might not be the strongest by the standards of Murim, they were not the kind of people Roman could deal with lightly at his current level.And...<After one reaches the stage known as the \"7th Circle,\" they are referred to as 'Archmage.' They are half-human and half-god and considered a walking calamity. With just a single spell of theirs, the ground is overturned, and the sky collapses. Also, in a situation where one has to deal with many people at once, an Archmage is considered a better asset than a 6-Star Aura Knight.>Magic.It was a power that didn\u2019t exist in Murim.The more he read about this new world, the clearer it became what Roman needed to do now.\u2018I never know when the characters in this book will appear as my enemies. The probability of such an ordeal in Dmitry is extremely slim, but variables are always unpredictable. So, it is still dangerous. As I am now, I cannot perfectly respond to these variables. Therefore, before the problem arises, I have to become stronger.\u2019Tap.He closed the bookI need to do work from now on.Roman called for Hans.Anytime, anywhere, he appeared as if waiting for Roman's call.\u201cDid you call me, young master?\u201d\u201cI have a favor to ask of you.\u201d\u201cWhat do I need to do?\u201dHans' attitude was polite.After the Blood Fang incident, this was his first time seeing Roman again.Although he was only a servant, Hans had vowed to risk his life for Roman.Some might laugh at Hans.Speaking words was considerably easier than staying true to them.It's a frivolous thing to risk your life.However, each person had a different view of the world, and for Hans, Roman had become a special existence.\u201cI need a space where I can practice. It doesn't matter if the size isn\u2019t large, but it should be a space completely blocked from the outside. In particular, the more reliable the soundproofing, the better. Being interrupted during training is the worst.\u201d\"I understand.\"He politely bowed his head.He didn't ask anything.Most people would ask many questions like what kind of training Roman would do or why he needed such a space, but Hans simply complied with Roman's orders.\u201cAlso, do you know the whereabouts of the boy we met before?\u201d\"Yes. I thought the young master might want to meet him, so I set up a separate residence for Kevin.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dThere was a smile on his face.He's reading the mind of his master and taking action accordingly in advance.Roman recognized that he was doing his best for him.\u201cTell me a little bit about Kevin and take me to him. We made a promise to him. We promised to deal with the problems he was encountering through the right processes. Now that we have eliminated the threat of Blood Fang as he wished, we should visit him and deliver the good news. Additionally, there is something that I want from Kevin.\u201dKevin was a child who resembled the Crazy Demon.Maybe it\u2019s the effect of meeting Chris, but I want to see him again.Sega usually refers to a powerful family/house/clan in Murim.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 - Ki and Mana (4)It is said that rumors move faster than people.The rumor that started in Lawrence eventually spread to Dmitry in just one day.\u201cDid you hear that rumor?\u201d\u201cWhat? The rumor that Young Master Roman subdued the Blood Fang? Does that make any sense? Young Master Roman can\u2019t even wield a sword properly.\u201d\u201c...That said, the testimonies of people who saw it in person were so vivid.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s a rumor anyway. Even if a person like Young Master Roman went out to the hunting grounds and managed to catch a wild boar, the reality is that the rumor would be inflated as if he had beaten a legendary dragon. I heard Young Master Roman had shown something unbelievable in front of the residents of Lawrence, but perhaps the Dmitry Knights set it up. That day, the knights had left the castle hurriedly.\u201d\"Oh, they did? You must be telling the truth. After all, how would Dmitry's Fool even do such a thing?\u201dMost people didn't believe it.Just as people didn't trust the boy who cried wolf1, Roman's image in Dmitry was far from trustworthy.In the end, the residents of Dmitry only classified the incident as an absurd rumor.People were so deeply rooted in their beliefs.Even when the merchants from Lawrence told them the truth repeatedly, their only reaction was ridicule.\"Next to a group of men talking about the rumors, a boy who was tidying things up pricked his ears.\"\u2018...Young Master Roman subdued the Blood Fang?\u2019Thud.His heart sank.The boy's name was Kevin.Through Roman\u2019s help, he was making a living by doing chores Hans had given him.He could not forget the day he met Roman.The moment his life seemed to be hell while being beaten by the Blood Fang members, Roman appeared like an angel and delivered judgment on the evil hordes.He still clearly remembered the screams of the Blood Fang members and how Roman had shoved a dagger into one of the members' mouths to cut off his tongue. It was just too fucking cool for Kevin to forget.After that day, Kevin had a dream.\u2018I want to become a strong man like Young Master Roman. A strong person who can protect my people from any danger. In a barren world where you can't trust anyone, that's the only way for my family to survive.'He clenched his teeth.It was unclear when and where the Blood Fang gang would strike again. Also, his father's failure to act as head of the household forced him to fend for himself.Then, he heard the rumors.All the residents of Dmitry treated it as a rumor, but Kevin was convinced it was true.Thump Thump.His heart raced.He had clearly seen that Roman had defeated the Blood Fang members with a tree branch.Due to that, it didn't seem far-fetched for him to wipe out the Blood Fang alone.The hero who promised to solve the problem turned a miracle into reality in just a few days.\u2018Ah, young master.\u2019He almost cried.He didn't know if Roman really did such a dangerous thing for him, but the fact that he didn't forget his promise to him, who was only a commoner, came to his mind.He wiped away his tears.He had to work and couldn't focus on the emotions that kept churning inside him.When will I be able to see Young Master Roman again? If that day ever comes, I want to express my gratitude to him without forgetting my current feelings.He had a busy day.Just when he was about to finish his last job, he heard a voice.Tap.\u201cYoung... master?!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201dSeeing Roman Dmitry visit him, Kevin unknowingly dropped his tools on the ground.He was lost for a moment.Kevin, doubting whether this was real, was startled and bowed down.\u201cThank you, young master! Thanks to you, my family can live without the Blood Fang troubling us. Thank you so much!\u201dHe was emotional.Kevin's face flushed red as he uttered sincere words.Roman asked, \u201cKevin, how have you been?\u201d\"Ah...!\u201dHe was speechless.Roman remembered his name.Others might think of it as a small thing, but Kevin could never think of it like that.To him, it was shocking.His emotions inevitably mixed with his voice, and Kevin said in a seemingly weeping voice, \u201cThanks to the young master, we have been living well. The Blood Fang gang no longer bothers us, and the work that Mr. Hans gave me saved us. Due to the young master's grace, we were even able to solve our problems of livelihood. I don\u2019t know how to express my gratitude.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re thankful, huh. Well, I would like to make an offer to you.\u201d\u201c...What do you mean?\u201d\u201cIf you accept my offer, your family will never have to worry about their livelihood again. In a warm house that blocks the cold wind, eating three delicious meals every day, they will not only live a life in which they won't need to work hard but will also be able to enjoy hobbies. Living like that is simple. I plan to do the same in the future.\u201dHe got goosebumps.He didn't know exactly what Roman was trying to say, but Kevin instinctively knew he was about to be given an opportunity the likes of which he might never get again.\u201cHence, live for me. I will give you a new life if you swear allegiance to me.\u201dWhen Roman finished saying his words, it was as if lightning struck Kevin's head.He had never dreamed of being able to follow such a great figure as Young Master Roman.However, the reality was that Roman suggested it first.He asked Kevin to become his person.He was worried at the thought that it might not be true, but Kevin knew he couldn't afford to miss Roman's offer.It was instinct.Kevin, lying face down, slammed his forehead on the ground.Slam!\u201cFrom now on, I will live for Young Master Roman. If you ask me to die, I will die; if you tell me to kill someone, I will kill them. Your promise to take care of my family, just that much is enough.\u201dHe raised his head.Drops of blood ran down his forehead.Drops of blood dripped down his eyes, but Kevin was looking at Roman without even blinking a single time.He looked like a fool.He showed his loyalty through his own blood.\u2018But... even his foolishness resembles that of the Crazy Demon.\u2019The Crazy Demon was like that as well.At Roman's command to keep the enemies at bay, the Crazy Demon would stand up against hundreds of religious sects at once.At that time, he was nothing more than a nameless man, but later, he was given the nickname \u201cCrazy Demon\u201d due to his actions and loyalty.Even though his whole body was covered with wounds from the attacks that came from all sides, and the blood flowing from his body flowed as wide as a river, the Crazy Demon stopped the righteous sects without groaning a single time.He swore his allegiance to Roman just like the Crazy Demon did to the Heavenly Demon, Baek Joong-hyuk. When he met the Crazy Demon for the first time, he had also sworn his allegiance to him by slamming his head on the ground.\u201cMy life belongs to the young master from now on.\u201dKevin's voice.It was more than just resembling the Crazy Demon.With each passing moment, Kevin looked more similar to the madman known as the Crazy Demon.Looking at him, Roman laughed.He looked like a child who had been charmed by Roman's actions.That day, Roman readily accepted a new bond in his new life.\u201cYes, you are mine from now on.\u201dAt a time when no one was paying attention to Roman yet, he found someone who would give his life for him.Roman brought Kevin along with him.He then asked Hans to help Kevin adjust for the time being. Afterward, he went to the place Hans had set up for him.Soon, he arrived at a shabby workshop in the inner castle. It was originally the place where Baron Romero used to work at.Therefore, the entry of outsiders was strictly prohibited. Also, there was a barrier outside the place. Due to that, it was suitable for Roman's training.\u201cFrom this moment onwards, I will spend a week training and strengthening myself. While doing that, I won't need anything like food, so make sure to never let anyone inside. Unless Dmitry's in immediate danger, you won\u2019t need me.\"He gave the order and then went inside.In the training ground, there weren't many things.A cool wind blew, and he noticed straw was spread across the floor, which Hans had prepared beforehand.It was a meticulous detail showing how much Hans cared for Roman, but he didn't need it for his training. Thus, Roman put all the straw aside and sat cross-legged on the ground. This was important to absorb as much energy as possible from the environment.He was previously the Heavenly Demon, so he could easily control the ki surrounding him.Roman instantly became immersed in his own world, and slowly guided the surrounding mana to accumulate in his lower abdomen.'The first stage of the Heavenly Demon Martial Arts.'Roman had yet to begin training his body with the Heavenly Demon Martial Arts. This was because he needed to lay a foundation for his weak body, and in order to enter the first stage of human (\u4eba), he needed to be content with only accumulating mana.Eventually, Roman's body collected the minimum amount of mana to start using the Heavenly Demon Martial Arts.In order to perfectly use the techniques of the Heavenly Demon Martial Arts, it was necessary for him to enter the human phase.\u2018The human phase begins with the removal of waste ki from the body.\u2019Whoosh.Mana suddenly moved.Mana, which had been moving intensely through his blood vessels, was suddenly blocked by a huge wall.Thud.That wall was the waste ki in Roman's body.The original Roman had never lived a productive day in his life until he died in his mid-twenties.There were more impurities piled up in his body than others of his age, and Roman's face grew red as he was blocked by the impurities from the beginning of training.However, he did not lose his composure.It was the situation he had expected in the first place, so he made a plan to collect the minimum mana to enter the human phase.In the future, Roman must be strong.Beyond making new connections, he needed strength to achieve his goals while protecting them.The human phase was the beginning of Roman preparing himself for the future.Roman calmly meditated and focused on his internal energy.\u2018I have to remove all of the waste ki at once.\u2019Thump.Kuuuu.To Roman's actions and thoughts, mana responded.The Heavenly Demon, Baek Jung-hyuk.As he had been training martial arts all his life, the impurities began to melt according to Roman's strong will.The power of mana originally depends on the user's will. If someone who did not understand mana could only use one-tenth of the power even with a potential of 100, Roman was a person who would exceed the limit and exerted the power of mana to the potential of 150.Mana moved strongly according to Roman's will, and blood began to drip from Roman's nose at the powerful impact.Drip.It was a symptom that meant Roman's purification of ki was working.As the impure ki of the body was discharged, dark blood flowed down his face.Time continued to pass.First, a day passed.Then, two days....Later, three days passed.Nevertheless, Roman was completely absorbed in meditation.His face was drenched with sweat, and the blood that flowed only out of his nose at first could now be seen leaking through every pore of his body.Slowly, without rushing his mana, Roman ejected the waste ki from his body to enter the human phase.And also to regain the power of the Heavenly Demon he was in his previous life.Eventually, Roman went into a state of trance.2Due to that, Roman spent his time in a space cut off from the outside.Hans headed somewhere hurriedly.If everything had gone according to plan, he was supposed to meet Roman in the evening, but the events that took place that day did not allow for that.\u201cIs the young master going to come out now?\u201dA week earlier, when Roman had entered the training room, Viscount Lawrence suddenly announced that he would visit Dmitry.The reason was obvious; it was due to the breaking off of the engagement.The meeting was eventually postponed when Hans reported Roman's situation to Baron Romero, even though Roman should have done it himself by meeting his father in person.And today, he suddenly received a report that Viscount Lawrence and his daughter had arrived at the Dmitry estate early in the morning.As a result, he had no choice but to go find Roman hurriedly.'The atmosphere is not extremely serious.'The breakup of the engagement had not yet been revealed to the world.Of course, some people knew about it, but he wondered why Lawrence hadn't revealed it yet.Nevertheless, he continued running towards the place Roman was training at.Hans, who arrived at the training ground, stood in front of the door and waited for Roman even though he had instructions to call Roman right away.Keep in mind, Hans. If Dmitry isn't in a dangerous situation and I am not needed right away, do not call me.Hans remembered Roman's orders.Of course, many people were waiting for Roman in the castle.However, it was more important for Hans to obey the orders of his master, Roman.Roman, who had recently changed, was not a person who would speak meaningless words.He must have had a clear reason to ask Hans not to call him out unnecessarily. Due to that, even though he was given instructions to bring Roman immediately, he waited for Roman to come out.How much time had passed?Several people came to find Hans.However, Hans, who had sent them all back, only sensed movement from the training ground after the sun began to set.Creak.The door opened.Then, a familiar face came out.Hans, who was about to welcome Roman with a bright face, was taken aback when he saw Roman's appearance for a moment.\u201cYoung... master?\u201dHe noticed his eyes were much sharper than before.He looked at his skin which seemed as smooth as milk.And finally, he saw the muscular physique which resembled a warrior.He became certain.Roman's appearance and attitude had become utterly different than before.The boy who cried wolf is a story that teaches us a moral lesson: people refuse to believe a liar even when he is telling the truth.\u00a0It's a short and fun story, so click on this hyperlink if you wish to read it.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fA trance is a half-conscious state characterized by an absence of response to external stimuli, typically induced by hypnosis or entered by a medium. It's often observed in martial artists who are about to break into a new stage.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16 - An Impulsive Choice (1)At the same time Hans had been sent to bring Roman back, within the castle, following the servant's guidance, Viscount Lawrence and Flora were walking towards the guest room.\"Flora.\"\u201cYes, father.\u201d\u201cThis meeting was prepared to undo your mistakes. Be especially careful with your words and actions.\u201d\u201c...I understand.\"Flora nodded her head with a helpless expression.The day Roman subjugated the Blood Fang, the norm that made up Flora's world totally collapsed.Roman Dmitry, who was known as Dmitry's Fool, was a greater man than she thought, and the Lawrence family was in such a desperate situation that they had no choice but to cling to the Dmitry family.An impulsive choice that Flora thought was the right thing to do for her life had ruined everything for Lawrence.Now, she understood the reality that her father, who was always kind and gave Flora everything she ever requested, had a reason to proceed with the wedding even after hearing about Roman's reputation of being Dmitry's Fool.It was truly sad.Honestly, she didn't regret the fact that Roman was a different man from the rumors, but she hated her own actions for not being able to face the family's difficulties and solve them.How hard has it been for you, father?The appearance of her father telling her the truth about Roman and yelling at her overlapped with the image of him discussing her arranged marriage with difficulty.However, even in that difficult situation, her father hadn't forced her.He had given her a choice, and Flora made her own decision; however, since she couldn't take responsibility for her choices, she had to face her father's anger.\u2018It\u2019s a problem I have to solve. Not because Roman Dmitry is someone different from his reputation, but because Lawrence needs Dmitry's power to survive the conflict with the Barco family. So, let's accept reality. I'm an adult and can't always remain as Lawrence's flower.'She clenched her teeth.Then, they arrived at the guest room.However, there was no host welcoming them.Only a cold wind blew in the spacious waiting room, and the servant said he would return to serve the tea and then left the waiting room.\u201cIt looks like we will have to wait.\u201dThis meeting was unscheduled.However, even if he came in the morning without notice, the fact that he had the title of Viscount and was here to discuss the arranged marriage should be enough reason for him to be welcomed by Baron Romero immediately.Regardless, he was guided to a waiting room without meeting Baron Romero or Roman Dmitry.Also, the servant saying he would bring the tea first meant that Lawrence's visit was not pleasant to Dmitry.He sighed and sat down on the sofa.He was determined to accomplish his visit\u2019s purpose.Viscount Lawrence and Flora both expected this was how Dmitry would react, so they just drank tea in the silent space and waited endlessly.However...Waiting also had limits.One hour, maybe even two hours.But when even more time passed, Viscount Lawrence's expression began to harden with each passing moment.I don't know how much time has passed.He had certainly reached Dmitry before the sun had fully risen, but now he could see the sun setting outside the guest room's window. They were being blatantly ignored. He understood Flora had made an unforgivable mistake, but it was unreasonable to spend such a long time sitting and waiting in the guest room.Eventually, he reached his limit.\u2018It shouldn\u2019t be like this.\u2019Boiling inside, Viscount Lawrence jumped up from his seat.\"I'll have to go and meet Baron Dmitry myself.\"Baron Romero's office.The tightly closed door suddenly opened.With a face flushed with anger, Viscount Lawrence had slammed the door open and entered the office. Then, he spoke reproachingly, \u201cBaron Dmitry! What kind of family etiquette is it to keep guests waiting this long? If you were not satisfied with our visit, you could have just told us to return back when we arrived. However, I did not know that the Dmitry family could be so rude to their guests!\u201dWaiting for a long time, he was severely hurt.He couldn't even continue speaking properly because of the thought of Dmitry being deliberately retaliatory to them.Tap.Baron Romero put down his pen.He, who had just looked through the payment documents, looked at Viscount Lawrence without the slightest change in the expression on his face.\u201cI understand why you are angry, Viscount Lawrence. However, was today\u2019s meeting scheduled in advance?\u201d\u201cI admit that we came unannounced. However, we are only here now because you had turned down our offer to meet with Roman a week ago and then didn't contact us any further. If you had made your intentions clear from the beginning and hadn't treated us like this, I would not have been as much hurt as I am now.\u201d\u201cHow can I dare to humiliate and ignore the Viscount? I just want to convey that this problem only arose because it was an unplanned meeting.\u201dA week ago, Roman had gone into closed-door seclusion.1It wasn't that he had intentionally avoided the meeting with the Viscount, but it was a situation in which he had no choice but to refuse the meeting, even if he was Baron Romero.But there was another problem.\u201cHowever...\u201dBaron Romero's expression suddenly hardened.His calm voice was clearly distorted, and the anger he had struggled to suppress till now finally erupted.\u201cAre you this upset after merely waiting until the sun went down? The day Flora visited Dmitry for the first time, Roman came to me and informed me about the breakup. Back then, I was angry at him and asked him to take responsibility. However, even a three-year-old kid would have known that the breakup was not done by Roman but by Flora. I believed that\u2019s how he wanted things to be, so I forgot about that problem nevertheless. I just kept my mouth shut and acted like I didn\u2019t know about it.\u201dA few days after that, Roman subjugated the Blood Fang.But was he happy with that fact?Of course not.His heart pounded while he sat down.He was afraid his precious son might have gotten hurt.Baron Romero couldn't keep his composure until he was informed that his son was fine.And... the culprit behind it all was Lawrence.Flora Lawrence.If she had revealed the fact of the breakup herself, there would have been no danger to Roman.\u201cWe were notified of the breakup without any discussion beforehand. It was Lawrence who wanted the marriage first; however, regardless of our will, we had no choice but to accept a one-sided breakup. However, Viscount Lawrence, now you come to me and rebuke me for not greeting you any earlier. Even though it was a meeting that was not scheduled in advance, you just came here boldly while acting like you hadn't done anything wrong!\u201dSlam!His hand hit the table.As Baron Romero rose from his seat, his majestic appearance overwhelmed Flora, who had arrived after Viscount Lawrence.\u201cAre you kidding me right now?\u201dHis expression was ferocious. It clearly showed his hostility towards the Viscount.The situation had taken a turn for the worse.Baron Romero.He had crossed the line.Although he was of lower status in terms of titles, he had no hesitation in expressing his anger towards the Viscount.\u201cWhat did you think this marriage meant, Viscount Lawrence? A marriage between two people who love each other? The union of two families? Such fancy words have nothing to do with this marriage.\u201dDue to his contribution to the war, Romero Dmitry was gifted the title of Baron.He was someone who had barely made his way into the world of nobility.However, among the nobles who settled in the North-Eastern part of the Cairo Kingdom, no one could openly ignore Baron Dmitry.Yes, the world is like that.Power and identity both decide where someone stands in society.The owner of the iron mines, Baron Romero, possessed incredible wealth.Due to that, Viscount Lawrence couldn't say anything.Moreover, what the Baron had said was actually true.Viscount Lawrence knew that Dmitry had power, so he made a request to Baron Romero for the marriage between their families.It would have been a real bonus if the marriage proceeded with his second son and not Dmitry's Fool, but still, the union with Dmitry was a necessity for Lawrence's future.Due to this, Baron Romero's anger was natural.His voice, which was calm at first, had now turned ferocious as if it would prey on Viscount Lawrence.\u201cThe Viscount and I are well aware of the essence of the arranged marriage. This is not just a matter of the relationship between the children of both families. The Barco family is aiming for the fertile land of the Lawrence family. As they have already gotten the central government's approval, it wouldn't be unusual for the two families to go to war at any time. A month ago, I was contacted by the Barco family. They said that if we married Barco instead of Lawrence, they would not only give us a connection to the central government but also give us part of the Lawrence estate. Still, I turned down the Barco family's offer. What do you think was the reason, Viscount?\u201d\u201c...Why did you refuse them? The Barco family\u2019s proposal would have been much more beneficial to Dmitry.\u201d\u201cThe reason is simple. The Dmitry family has power, so we were able to choose what we wanted.\u201dThe Barco family was a dangerous enemy.Holding hands with them meant a peaceful future, but it would be different otherwise.However, those who have power do not need to seek compromise.\u201cRoman wanted to marry Flora. He said that there was no one more beautiful than her in the whole world. Due to the sole reason that Dmitry's eldest son admired Lawrence's Flower, I decided to go to war with the Barco family. There was no other reason than that. Even if my decision shed a lot of Dmitry's blood, I just hoped my eldest son would get what he wanted.\"Refusing the offer of Barco was undoubtedly a loss for Dmitry.Many people were saying that Dmitry made that choice to enter the aristocratic world in earnest; in fact, even Baron Romero gave a similar reason when he had punished Roman.However, the truth was different. If it had not been for the marriage Roman wished for, Dmitry would never have suffered any loss.Still, he held hands with Lawrence despite understanding the situation.From the beginning, the Lawrence family was the one in a favorable situation, but they did not understand the whole truth.However, the cup had already been spilled.The breakup was a huge mistake.From the time Flora Lawrence mentioned breaking up with Roman, the Lawrence family had already stepped into muddy water.\u2018\u2026I made a huge mistake.\u2019Viscount Lawrence's expression turned pale.He realized it just now.I should have endured it until the end.Even though Roman Dmitry refused to meet and made him wait for the sun to go down, Viscount Lawrence should have maintained his composure until the end.It wasn't a normal relationship in the first place.It was the Lawrence family who had a reason for marriage, and besides, there was no right to be angry since they were the ones who mentioned the breakup first.It was honestly stupid.Due to his low self-esteem, Viscount Lawrence thought that Dmitry was ignoring Lawrence.\u2018I ended up making a mistake myself after telling Flora to be careful with her words and actions. Dmitry's anger is understandable. Since we made a fool of them by unilaterally breaking the marriage, we shouldn't have had anything to say about how they treated us.'It was a miserable reality.Baron Romero spoke the truth once again.\u201cLawrence\u2019s Flower and Dmitry\u2019s Fool. We both know better than anyone else that the reputations of the man and woman do not match. However, Lawrence should have kept in mind who Roman was. Even if the daughter of the Lawrence family is the flower that everyone desires, the moment Dmitry is attached to Roman's name, his value changes. Therefore, it is Lawrence, not us, who hangs on to this marriage and desperately needs for it to happen.\u201dDmitry's Fool.A blacksmith house.The nobles looked down on Dmitry's roots, but no one could dare to belittle them out loud.Why?It was because Dmitry had power.Dmitry was considered the head of the North-East region.Still upset, Baron Romero shifted his cold eyes from Viscount Lawrance and looked straight at Flora, who was standing there without saying a word.\u201cAm I wrong?\u201dAn impulsive choice.Because of that foolish choice, Lawrence's pitiful situation was exposed.This is also known as closed-door training. Martial artists often go into this to focus on only themselves and cut off the outer world. It can last anywhere from a few days to many years.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17 - An Impulsive Choice (2)The Heavenly Demon Can\u2019t Live a Normal LifePublished onJun 27, 2022\u202210 min read\u2022553 viewsIn her childhood, Flora attended a prestigious academy.Lawrence\u2019s name value and wealth were derived mainly from their fertile land. Due to their power, Flora was served by servants every morning, and she quickly developed her skills as a noble. Honestly, her memories of that time were nothing special.However, a memory of her time at the academy came flooding back in that situation.\u2018He was from the Joel family.\u2019The Joel family were almost imaginary nobles in the North-East, as only their name was known.In fact, considering the lackluster reputation of their family, admission to a prestigious academy should have been impossible. Still, somehow, a member of the Joel family attended the academy at the same time as Flora.Flora didn\u2019t look at \u2018him\u2019 with a particularly biased gaze.She got along quite well with all her classmates. However, not everyone in their class felt like that towards the boy of the Joel family.The fence named prestige was separating them.Joel was an outsider that nobody wanted to befriend in a world where people considered themselves noble.One day, Joel made a minor mistake.Whenever the children of the prominent families caused a huge problem, nothing happened to them. However, when Joel caused even a small problem, he was severely punished for it.There was even the danger of expulsion. While the teachers were shouting at Joel, a man who appeared to be Joel\u2019s father came to the school in dull clothes and lowered his head.He requested them to forgive him just once and promised to make sure his son would be more careful in the future.Looking at the middle-aged person earnestly asking for forgiveness, Flora indirectly experienced the harsh reality of the world.\u2018Pitiful.\u2019If only the status of the Joel family was great, if only they had power, would Joel\u2019s family head need to bow his head?Of course not.It wouldn\u2019t have been considered a problem in the first place.They would have taken care of Joel\u2019s child just like everyone else.However, since he had no power, Joel\u2019s family head had no choice but to apologize.And\u2026The situation right now wasn\u2019t so different.In front of Baron Romero, who was expressing his anger, Flora\u2019s father resembled the Joel family head to her.\u201c\u2026As the family head of Lawrence, I have no excuse for what I have done. What Baron Dmitry said is true, even if it\u2019s repeated a hundred times. It was I who put forward the marriage proposal in the first place, but my daughter made a big mistake because she was still immature. I should have started by apologizing for my daughter\u2019s actions, but I sincerely apologize for making you angry with my negative comments.\u201dViscount Lawrence bowed his head.Lawrence didn\u2019t have the strength to handle Dmitry\u2019s wrath.The fact that Dmitry was the way to settle the dispute with Barco meant they had immense power.Viscount Lawrence faced reality. He had no other choice but to apologize.Flora felt a twisting knot form in her stomach as the tears she couldn\u2019t shed collided with the overflowing emotions bubbling inside her.\u2019\u2026It\u2019s all because of me.\u2019Joel.He was a pitiful kid.He was pitiful, so I wanted to treat him as well as possible.However, she was now in the same position as the one whom she pitied back then.It was stupid.I was pathetic.Even when she was in the academy, she showed kindness to others, but with the downfall of the Lawrence family, she realized not everyone was like that.From her childhood memories, she now realized that while looking at the Joel family\u2019s situation from a distance, she didn\u2019t know what the responsibilities of nobles were.\u2018I never thought my father would be treated like this because of me. It\u2019s my fault. If I had fully taken on the responsibility of the breakup rather than shifting the blame to Roman Dmitry, we wouldn\u2019t have made the Baron this angry. I\u2019m really sorry, father. I shouldn\u2019t have judged Roman so hastily, and I should have taken responsibility for my actions.\u2019Grip.She tightly clenched her fist.She had realized the root of the problem was her.Along with that, she realized this problem couldn\u2019t be solved with her father\u2019s apology alone.\u201cLord Dmi\u2014\u201dClack!\u201cLord.\u201dIt was then.Just as she was about to open her mouth, a soldier came in and announced, \u201cYoung Master Roman has arrived.\u201dShe felt like the situation was getting worse with each passing moment.When Roman Dmitry entered the office, Flora took a deep breath unknowingly.\u2019\u2026This is Roman Dmitry?\u2019In front of her, there was a man who was completely different from what she remembered.Her first meeting with Roman was as bad as it gets.Although it might have been like that because of the public rumors of Dmitry\u2019s Fool, his unmanaged looks and dreadful perfume made Flora frown.Of course, it was only later that she found out that perfume was out of consideration for her; but even then, she was stricken with prejudice and did not think well of Roman.But now\u2026Now he looked like a completely different person.Roman\u2019s gait was charming, and his body gave off a fragrant scent that was not artificial. He had changed entirely from his toes to his head.He now looked taller than before, with his posture straight as a renowned warrior. Moreover, his face, which had plenty of blemishes earlier, was now as white as white jade, and his dark hair and red lips looked particularly prominent because of his skin.Previously, he had a normal appearance, but now he looked good enough to be called handsome.However, what truly surprised Flora the most was the unique aura of Roman Dmitry.\u2018It\u2019s like meeting a warrior.\u2019He looked confident.It\u2019s like he\u2019s looking down on everyone else and saying he has no reason to be afraid of anything.Right, he was now like a sharp-edged and well-maintained sword.Her first meeting with him was surprising, the second was shocking, and the third was mesmerizing.Just now, she had a thought. She knew it was pathetic, but\u2026Roman\u2019s figure looked very similar to her ideal type.Tap.He stopped walking.Roman, who was not shaken in the slightest while receiving all the gazes on his body, looked up at Baron Romero and spoke calmly, \u201cI, Roman Dmitry, greet you, father.\u201dIt had been just one week.However, the results of the closed-door seclusion were enough to shock everyone.Even Baron Romero was equally flustered. His son\u2019s appearance had dramatically changed.He had a lot of things he wanted to ask, but right now, he had others watching him, so he tried hard to maintain a calm face.\u201cDid you finish your training well?\u201d\u201cYes, father.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about that separately later. The reason I called you here is because the Lawrence family wishes to forget about the breakup and proceed with the arranged marriage again. As a father, I have no desire to continue the relationship with the Lawrence family, who took our relationship so lightly, but this problem started with your decision. As your father, I will accept whatever choice you make.\u201dIf it was a month ago, Baron Romero would have proposed marriage to the Barco family, intending to oppose and retaliate against Lawrence.However, now, he trusted his son.He believed that if he was the same son who subjugated the Blood Fang by himself, he would be able to make the right choice for himself.\u201c\u2026I understand what you mean.\u201dWith the awkward atmosphere around him, he quickly realized the situation.He presumed that although they wouldn\u2019t have fought in the beginning, after some time passed, Baron Romero lost his patience, and things escalated between the two family heads. The stern expressions on Viscount Lawrence and Flora\u2019s faces made it even more apparent.The Dmitry family, which Roman knew, had immense power.He didn\u2019t like to cause problems, so he didn\u2019t use their family\u2019s power often, but Dmitry is by no means a weak family.It was one of the strongest forces in the North-East area of Cairo.Whatever choice he would make, he was sure Dmitry could handle it.Roman said, \u201cI know what the union of Dmitry and Lawrence means. When the Lawrence family considered me as their marriage partner, they didn\u2019t want a man named Roman Dmitry but instead needed Dmitry\u2019s wealth. In a situation where the Barco family threatened Lawrence, Dmitry\u2019s wealth would have ensured Lawrence\u2019s safety.\u201d\u201c\u2026Did you want to go through with the marriage even though you knew that?\u201d\u201cYes. At that time, I thought the marriage was worth it.\u201dAt Roman\u2019s words, Baron Romero was utterly surprised.He thought that his immature son had thoughtlessly wished to marry Flora.Although he never explained the situation to him, he never thought Roman would grasp the complicated relationship with the Barco family.It was just as Baron Romero had said earlier. Roman had already figured out what was going on just with the atmosphere, so he would choose the right answer himself.\u201cThe union with Lawrence comes at the expense of Dmitry. As the central government has already approved the Barco family, Dmitry\u2019s participation in the war will not cause them to back off. Then, the woman I have to marry should be worth at least that much. Leaving aside our families\u2019 benefits, this is someone to whom I need to devote my life to. Of course, Flora is known as Lawrence\u2019s flower. However, the very first time I met her, she told me she didn\u2019t want to marry me. At that moment, my image of her completely changed.\u201dBoth the parties for the marriage didn\u2019t know each other.The two of them imagined an image of each other in their heads based on the rumors, but it was only an illusion, not the person\u2019s real nature.Nevertheless, Flora had made a hasty decision.She thought that the perfume he sprayed out of consideration for her was proof of him playing around with women, and the lousy skin on his face was a look that suited Dmitry\u2019s Fool.Flora was too hasty with her choices.She believed information she didn\u2019t confirm for herself and ruined her relationship with an unwise attitude, even though she hadn\u2019t talked to her partner herself.\u201cWhat was Flora thinking before deciding to nullify the engagement? She must have heard the rumors that I was Dmitry\u2019s Fool, and would\u2019ve concluded that she could not marry such a person. However, the real problem was her thought process. She was unwise in handling her family\u2019s critical issues and judged someone she had never met solely on the basis of rumors. Marriage is about finding one\u2019s lifelong partner. I cannot live a happy life with my partner simply because she is pretty or her family is great. What matters is her wisdom. How she deals with the challenges that come her way in life matters a lot. Understanding that gives me the confidence to believe that person and the promise she makes to spend the rest of her life with me.\u201dRoman\u2019s words were relentless.Every time he said something, Flora\u2019s face flushed red, and she couldn\u2019t dare to look straight at Roman.She was still young.She made a mistake because she had no experience with the world of nobility, but as it was a serious problem, she could not easily be freed from the responsibility of her choices.\u201cI am proud of the Dmitry family. Starting as a blacksmith, my father built the base of the family and crossed the wall of status that others would not even dare to touch. And I wish to marry a woman like my mother, who was always proud and supportive of my father. No matter how the world thinks of Roman Dmitry, I hope to find a companion who believes in what she sees and judges for herself.\u201dThe question had been finally answered.Roman then looked at Flora.Just as Flora had unilaterally notified him of the breakup in their first meeting, Roman left no room for compromise or retaliation from Flora.\u201cThus, I wish for the breakup to continue without any changes.\u201dNow, the cup has been wholly spilled.That\u2019s it. The water was now completely scattered on the floor, and there was no way to put it back in its original state.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18 - An Impulsive Choice (3)The Heavenly Demon Can\u2019t Live a Normal LifePublished onJun 28, 2022\u202212 min read\u2022402 viewsBreakup.Viscount Lawrence squeezed his eyes shut at those words.He understood that there was no longer any room for compromise.It might have been possible if Roman had wanted them to continue with the marriage. However, he only wished for the breakup to proceed without any changes.\u2018It\u2019s over.\u2019He suddenly got dizzy.Arranged marriage was Lawrence\u2019s last option.Judging that he could not stop Barco by other means, he had to use his precious daughter for an arranged marriage.As the head of the family, he was responsible for protecting his family.He thought sacrificing his daughter and marrying her off to Dmitry\u2019s Fool was better than the downfall of the entire family.But now, the breakup was confirmed.No matter how beautiful Flora is, there is no family that will go to war for a woman with flaws.This was their only chance at gaining an ally through marriage.Now, the crisis must be resolved only with the strength of the Lawrence family.Furthermore.\u2018I need to soothe Baron Romero\u2019s anger. If he holds hands with the Barcos as a means of revenge, our defense\u2019s slim chances of success would be reduced to ashes.\u2019Dmitry.Being the head of the family, Baron Romero\u2019s wrath was great.If it was Baron Romero, who was displaying his hostility as if he was ready to rally his troops, it wouldn\u2019t be too strange to see him unite with the Barcos and take them up on their offer instead.If that happened, it would definitely mean the downfall of Lawrence.If Barco and Dmitry, the strongest powers in the North-East region, united, there would be no way to withstand their attack.The situation had gone from bad to worse.In his heart, he wanted to tell his daughter it was okay.Although the viscount was a father who always made good choices for his daughter, right now, he was no different from the family head of the Joel family, as, in the current situation, the future of the family was at stake.As the family head of Joel had bowed his head to the teacher even though he was of aristocratic status, Viscount Lawrence bowed his head deeply to Baron Romero.\u201c\u2026This situation is entirely Lawrence\u2019s fault. Therefore, Lawrence will take responsibility for the breakup. And as an apology, for the time being, we will accept neither tolls nor taxes from the merchants of Dmitry who will visit Lawrence. Of course, such a thing would be meaningless to the owner of the iron mines, but please think of it as a sincere apology from the Lawrence family for their mistakes.\u201d\u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to do that. Dmitry has no desire to profit from the breakup of my eldest son. Just let the public know that Flora Lawrence has broken up the marriage because of personal issues and end this matter. If you do that, I promise that Dmitry will never unite with the Barcos.\u201d\u201cThank you, Baron Dmitry. Thank you very much.\u201dBaron Romero\u2019s reaction was kinder than he thought.At that sincerity, Lawrence shook his head, yet his heart sank.\u2018Marriage to Dmitry was perhaps the best option we could have chosen.\u2019Romero Dmitry is a father who truly loves his son.Also, Dmitry\u2019s eldest son is completely unlike the rumors about him.How could I waste such an opportunity? I don\u2019t know why people call him Dmitry\u2019s Fool, but from my experience, he is an extraordinary man. He subjugated the Blood Fang by himself. He even boldly revealed his beliefs in front of me. He was so confident while facing a Viscount.In particular, when he saw Roman making choices for his family even in the face of a breakup, he truly fell for him.Roman is an imoogi.1If his true worth is revealed to the world in the future, there is no doubt that Flora will be ridiculed for breaking up with him.Right, that\u2019s what a breakup is like. From this point onwards, Roman will now be an inseparable label in Flora\u2019s life.\u2018I wonder if my daughter would have liked Roman if she had known his true nature sooner. Had I known the true value of Roman myself even a little earlier, I would have prevented Flora from making hasty choices. This is my mistake as well.\u2019He swallowed his regret.The breakup had already happened.Viscount Lawrence repeatedly apologized, and only left when Baron Romero\u2019s expression softened.Now, only Roman and his father were left in the room.Baron Romero\u2019s gaze eventually turned to Roman.Throughout the conversation, he couldn\u2019t concentrate on the situation because of a single question in his mind.\u201cSon. What the hell happened during the past week?\u201dRoman looked back at him.There was an issue that needed explanation.During his time in closed-door seclusion, Roman managed to enter the human phase.The human phase created a foundation for demonstrating the divine powers of the Heavenly Demon Martial Arts; however, it was not so great by Murim\u2019s standards.But in this world, it was a substantial change. The mana floating in nature was abundant, and Roman\u2019s body had a deep level of waste, so just creating a foundation had a dramatic effect.With this, the Heavenly Demon adjusted to Roman\u2019s body completely.The fact that his appearance changed due to metamorphosis was evidence that he had become a completely different person from before.Roman said, \u201cIt seems I had a realization while practicing alone. I don\u2019t remember exactly how, but it seems that now, there is a mana cycle going on inside my body.\u201d\u201c\u2026Did you just say a mana cycle?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHuh.\u201dBaron Romero was surprised.A mana cycle was a rare phenomenon that occurred among people who dealt with mana. If one managed to achieve it, mana would naturally circulate throughout the body and turn it into its optimal state. It was so incredible that only a few people could do it. Roman had thought it would be the best answer, but Baron Romero\u2019s thoughts became more complicated due to that.\u2018A mana cycle\u2026\u2019Recently, Roman had shockingly changed fundamentally.Baron Dmitry\u2019s son, known as Dmitry\u2019s Fool, suddenly announced the breakup of the marriage. After that, he started doing things the Baron wouldn\u2019t have even imagined before, like subjugating the Blood Fang. In particular, he could not comprehend the victory over Chris, known as Dmitry\u2019s prodigy, in the duel and the mana cycle he mentioned just now.He felt like he didn\u2019t know his son.He had clearly seen him grow up and knew what sort of things his son liked doing.But now, rather than calling him a genius, it\u2019d be more appropriate to call Roman\u2019s changes unfathomable.However.\u2018Nevertheless, it\u2019s clear that you are my son.\u2019His face, eyes, and voice that called him father were still that of his son.Due to those things, Baron Romero buried the doubts.He didn\u2019t know what changed Roman; however, for Baron Romero, only the fact that Roman was his eldest son was important.Baron Romero said calmly, \u201cAs you go forward, be sure to keep this one fact in mind, my son. I am your father. As your father, no matter what difficulties you face, I will stand by your side and face them with you. And I am also the person who will eagerly await and celebrate your development. So, never forget that your name is Roman Dmitry. I, Romero Dmitry, will always support you to achieve your goals and become a better person.\u201dHearing his father\u2019s words, Roman felt something unfamiliar stir inside him.This was something unfamiliar to the person known as Baek Joong-hyuk.The father he remembered was cruel and cold-hearted to the point that he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to drive his sons to their death.However, the father in front of him was completely different from his original father.\u2018Not bad.\u2019Is this what fatherly love is?Roman laughed.\u201cThank you very much, father.\u201dWhen he left the office, Roman encountered a familiar situation. Flora was waiting outside for him, just like when she had visited Dmitry for the first time.Back then, Flora had said, \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d with a bewildered face. But now, she bowed her head with a different look.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m extremely sorry. It is I, who judged you hastily, and made decisions on important family matters on my own.\u201dFlora was bowing in front of him.Due to the previous circumstances, she couldn\u2019t even look straight at Roman.\u201cThere is no need for an apology.\u201dNevertheless, Roman\u2019s reaction was cold.Revenge?It wasn\u2019t something like that.Roman truly felt that an apology was not necessary.\u2018Everything that happened was just consequential, and Flora\u2019s choice was not wrong.\u2019If it hadn\u2019t been Baek Joong-hyuk, who now possessed Roman\u2019s body, Roman truly would have been a man worthy of being called Dmitry\u2019s Fool. He already knew the past Roman\u2019s will was so weak that he would commit suicide if he were even a little cornered.Attaching themselves to Dmitry through marriage would\u2019ve immediately solved the problem for the Lawrences; however, as a woman, it would be hard to spend the rest of your life with someone like the past Roman.Because of that, he understood Flora.Moreover, there was no reason to express his anger towards a woman who had decided to take responsibility for her mistakes.However, as Flora didn\u2019t know what Roman was thinking, she interpreted his reaction differently.\u201cI fully understand why you are angry. You can\u2019t help but be angry. Even though it was an arranged marriage where the feelings of the partners were not important, I unilaterally broke the engagement. Still, I just wanted to tell you one thing before I went away. There was a special reason I decided to break the engagement.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dRoman didn\u2019t show any particular reaction. He just stood still.To Roman\u2019s staring gaze, Flora spoke in a low voice.\u201cHonestly, now I think it was just a rumor. It\u2019s not a rumor that suits someone who subjugated the Blood Fang by himself and didn\u2019t lose his morals. Still, I\u2019m telling you because I think you need to know. The source of the rumors was a social gathering led by nobles in the North-East area. When rumors spread that I was going to marry Dmitry\u2019s Fool, the nobles I knew told me that Roman Dmitry was a drug addict. Moreover, he used the kind of drugs that would make him lose his senses slowly. Hearing things like drug addiction, I couldn\u2019t forget what they told me.\u201dIt was the first time Roman had heard that.Still, he remained quiet.Roman was neither flustered nor did he show any particular reaction to Flora\u2019s words.Eventually, Roman said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter that you notified me of the breakup for some reason, Flora. You did not want to marry me, so the only choice was to break up.\u201dWhen they met for the first time, and even now, Roman did not allow Flora to get closer to him.\u201cSo don\u2019t get involved in my life anymore.\u201dRoman spoke coldly and moved forward.That was the end of it.A woman like Flora had no right to be inside Roman\u2019s fence.2On his way back to his room, Roman was lost in thought.Flora and Viscount Lawrence.Although he had sorted out the troublesome relationships with them, before returning to Lawrence, Flora had said something he could never ignore.\u2019\u2026A drug addict.\u2019His eyebrows twitched.Doing drugs was an issue that could not be overlooked in Roman\u2019s life. Even when he was living as Baek Joong-hyuk, Roman killed all Demonic Cult members who did drugs.They did not simply plunge their own lives into the abyss of evil but polluted everything around them like a disease.How did Roman get into such a dangerous thing?This meant that Roman\u2019s suicide, which was the beginning of a new life, had to be interpreted as having a slightly different reason from now on.\u2018Roman may not have committed suicide simply to avoid enlistment. In fact, there were a lot of puzzling parts from the beginning. He himself would have known that he could solve the military enlistment problem with the arranged marriage to the Lawrence family, but he took the extreme step too early. This means there were other reasons for his suicide.\u2019Pfft.Roman suddenly laughed.Roman had recently undergone a metamorphosis.So, no matter what Flora said, he knew that Roman\u2019s body had no bad energy that could be from an addiction to drugs. Of course, he did have impure energy, but the Heavenly Demon presumed it was due to suicide. It was wiped out recently when he underwent metamorphosis anyway.Nevertheless, this meant the rumors that Flora had told him were evidence of slander.\u201cHow interesting.\u201dThere is something people misunderstand.Just like when Roman put Hans inside his fence, he acted the same in his previous life, and people said he might be a holy warlord when they saw the Heavenly Demon ruling over people.That, of course, was a huge misinterpretation.If they saw his behavior from the eyes of his enemies, Roman always trampled on them and condemned even the smallest things.He was far from fair to them.The survival of the fittest; that was the way of the world he once lived in.In that world, it was natural to press down on others from the top, and the fear engraved in their bones became the basis for the subjugation of the Murim.\u201cI need to check the facts.\u201dDing ding.He rang the bell immediately.I should ask him.\u201cDid you call for me, young master?\u201dThe first person in this world to be inside his fence, Hans, carefully opened the door.An imoogi is a lesser dragon that can become a full-fledged dragon in the future. They usually look like serpents while having the size around that of an actual dragon.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fRoman puts those whom he values and trusts most inside his fence.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19 - Blind Trust (1)The Heavenly Demon Can\u2019t Live a Normal LifePublished onJun 29, 2022\u202211 min read\u2022433 viewsRoman\u2019s question to Hans was straightforward.\u201cHans. Have you ever seen me taking drugs, or have there been any situations where it was presumed that I took drugs?\u201d\u201cHuh?!\u201dHans was startled.What does he mean by taking drugs?Hans thought he had been called to run an errand as usual, but he couldn\u2019t hide his embarrassment at Roman\u2019s sudden question.And Roman was sure he would have that reaction.Hans was close to the past Roman, so he would definitely know whether Roman was taking drugs or not.Roman continued, \u201cI don\u2019t mean to punish you or anything. However, I just want to take some time to reflect on my past life and actions. I want to check how I lived my life through the eyes of a bystander, not my own memories.\u201dHe didn\u2019t add any excuses.He didn\u2019t know Roman\u2019s memories due to his reincarnation.Some would ask many questions and search for an explanation, but it wasn\u2019t necessary for Roman.He just asked his question straightforwardly.The problem was with Hans.Unlike usual, he showed some signs of hesitation, but then, he had a serious expression as if he had made his decision.\u2018The young master I recently experienced is not someone who would ask things like this in vain. He really wants to check the circumstances and know if he was using drugs from another person\u2019s perspective, so I should be honest about what I know.\u2019\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve never seen the young master take drugs. However, there was a time when your behavior was a little strange.\u201d\u201cWhen was that?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 I think it was a fortnight ago. The young master had gone to a banquet for the first time in a long time. Actually, the banquet wasn\u2019t anything special, but after returning from it, the behavior of the young master was a bit strange. From that day onwards, you refrained from going out and stayed in your room while demanding excessive amounts of alcohol every night and looked lifeless. During that period, I suspected the young master might have taken some manner of drugs at the banquet.\u201dOn the day Roman committed suicide, Hans looked at Roman, possessed by Baek Joong-hyuk, while being suspicious of drugs being used.Recently, it had been a problem among the nobility, so he was considering the possibility that Dmitry\u2019s Fool had taken drugs as well.But.\u201cOther than that, I don\u2019t think there were any other incidents. Honestly, now I know how foolish I was back then. There is no way the strong and intelligent young master would have ever touched drugs.\u201dNow it was clear that it was simply a matter of suspicion.Hans trusted Roman would never take drugs.The cleverness he had shown in the process of subjugating the Blood Fang was something that a drug addict could never show.\u2019It was at the\u00a0banquet*.\u2019*Roman was deep in thought.The Banquet\u2026It was a familiar word to Roman now.Things had changed after Roman attended a banquet, and not long after that, he had made the drastic decision of suicide.Even the rumors that Flora had heard had come from a banquet.Then, he asked, \u201cWho was in charge of the banquet I attended?\u201dThe root of the problem.It was essential for Roman to find it.And then, Hans answered, \u201cYou had attended the Barco family\u2019s banquet, young master.\u201dBarco.It was that moment when things entered a new phase.The explanation of Hans was simple.\u201cYou had known the eldest son of the Barco family for a long time. After the marriage conversation with Lawrence, the relationship began to falter; however, none of the noble children got along with the young master as well as he did. So, it wasn\u2019t too unusual for you to attend the Barco family\u2019s banquet. I thought you would still have a good relationship with him because you knew each other even before the marriage conversation.\u201dBarco\u2019s eldest son, Anthony Barco, was a man who had a bad reputation among the nobles, just like Roman.That was how the two bonded.Coming from two powerful families in the North-East region, the two men with bad reputations often played together.\u2018The two of them probably weren\u2019t close friends. Since they had a similar reputation, it must have been that they were simply hanging out together as friends for entertainment. However, the relationship then became entangled due to Flora. Anthony Barco wanted to marry Flora, and Roman was no different. And the winner of that battle was Roman. It\u2019s because the Lawrence family, who ultimately rejected Barco, decided that Dmitry was better than Barco.\u2019The puzzle pieces were finally put into place.Roman received Barco\u2019s invitation and attended the banquet.As Roman decided to resort to suicide after that, the cause was definitely in Barco.\u2018The only reasonable conclusion I can reach in a situation like this is that Barco induced Roman\u2019s suicide. If Dmitry became one with Lawrence, Barco would not be able to claim Flora or Lawrence\u2019s fertile land. And the simplest way to solve that problem is to prevent the marriage from happening in the first place. From what Hans had heard, Barco had previously wished to marry Lawrence, so now the only way left for them to do so was to either induce a breakup or create a situation in which Dmitry and Lawrence could not get married.\u2019Roman saw the big picture.The people who would benefit the most from Roman\u2019s death were Barco.I don\u2019t know how they led Roman to commit suicide, but they must have tried various methods to achieve their goal.Spreading obscene rumors and inducing a breakup were simply things they tried since it could have driven Roman to commit suicide.\u2018There is trash everywhere.\u2019The truth was not great but disappointing.Since he decided to live the life of Roman, the name Barco automatically touched Roman\u2019s nerves now.Just then, Hans said, \u201c\u2026In fact, a few days ago, Barco sent an invitation to a banquet. I couldn\u2019t deliver it to the young master because you had gone into closed-door seclusion; how do we deal with this?\u201d\u201cDid Barco invite me?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dPfft.Roman started laughing.They were blatantly ignoring him.No matter what kind of harm Anthony did to Roman, he was bold enough to confidently send invitations to see him again.\u2018It\u2019s annoying.\u2019I don\u2019t like it.It was now clear as day that the enemy was Barco.In order to continue living peacefully as Roman in the future, it was necessary to quickly clean up the annoying parts of his life.\u201cTell them that I will be attending the banquet.\u201dFace the problems head-on.That was the way Roman would live in the future.The banquet was scheduled to be held two weeks later.Roman, who had time to spare, went to visit Kevin, who had been waiting for him since he entered closed-door seclusion.\u201cWhat should I do now, young master?\u201dKevin lowered his head.He had accepted Roman\u2019s offer back then, but the problem was that there was nothing he could do for Roman.He was just a teenage boy.He was born with a talent as ordinary as a pebble on the side of the road. He could not come up with an answer about his role, no matter how much he had thought about it for the past week or so.So he decided to ask about his own role in Roman\u2019s life.Why did he accept someone like him?Roman said, \u201cI want to use you as my sword. However, the use of a person is not determined by the will of others. So, from now on, I will tell you three ways so that you can choose for yourself.\u201dIt was surprising.He wanted to use Kevin as his sword, even though Kevin had never touched a sword in his life.It was a remark that could not be understood with common sense, but Kevin did not raise any objection to Roman\u2019s words.\u201cThe first is to give up your use as a sword. If you are afraid to hold the sword and don\u2019t want to bleed, then be my hands and feet, not my sword. You can do your part by following Hans, learning what he does, and doing the non-dangerous tasks I order you to.\u201dThat was a safe option.Roman did not force him to risk his life for him.Forcing others to risk their lives created variables, and Roman did not want to keep a weak human being by his side as his sword.\u201cThe second is to protect me as a sword. However, in your mid-teens, there is no way for you to become strong quickly, as you have never touched a sword or trained till now. The world is not a beautiful fairy tale. It takes a lot of willpower to become strong, even if you train for a long time. I will test your will myself if you choose the second option. It will be a method in which you will suffer pain as if your muscles and bones were being torn apart at the same time. It won\u2019t be an easy decision, but it will show me a result that will prove your will.\u201dJust hearing those words made Kevin anxious and his mouth dry.Honestly, when Roman accepted Kevin, he thought maybe Kevin could handle his final ordeal.\u201cThe third\u2026\u201dHe drew his sword.And then.Clank.\u201cCut off your hand with this sword. If you can endure the pain of cutting yourself, you will be able to grow faster than anyone else.\u201dHe threw the sword in front of him.For the first time, a feeling of fear erupted on Kevin\u2019s face, who had shown his willpower until recently.The Crazy Demon.When I first met him, the crazy demon was just a little boy, like Kevin, who didn\u2019t know the M of martial arts.However.How was he able to grow and become one of the Four Heavenly Kings?Thanks to his natural talent?No.His growth came solely from his strong will.\u2018There are numerous ancient martial arts in the Demonic Cult Treasury. Among them, the Demonic Spirit Art turned several members who pursued strength into lunatics with powerful demonic energy. The Crazy Demon learned how to become a sword that could be useful to me. By overcoming the ordeal of learning the Demonic Spirit Art, he became a sword I could trust.\u2019Demonic Spirit Art.It\u2019s a dangerous martial art.When one uses that martial art, their mind is inevitably eaten away by demonic energy. In exchange, it allows them to exert explosive power while feeling pain as if their body was being torn apart.In fact, the pain is so terrible that ordinary people cannot even think of facing it.Roman gave the last suggestion because the Demonic Spirit Art can be learned by one who can handle the pain of cutting off their own arm.However, no one with an ordinary will can even dream of learning it.That\u2019s precisely why I chose the Demonic Spirit Art.I don\u2019t think Kevin can really handle the Demonic Spirit Art, but I want to give him a choice at least.Roman said, \u201cIn order for an ordinary person to transcend the limits of their talents, it takes a lot of sacrifice and willpower. You are already mine. Whatever choice you make, I will make sure to use you as well as I can. So, you should decide how you will be useful to me.\u201dThe ball was in his court.Kevin swallowed dry saliva.His eyes looking down at his sword trembled with terror, and his mouth was so dry that there was no saliva to swallow.Cutting off one\u2019s own arm was brutal.How could Roman suggest such a thing?\u201cPant, Pant.\u201dHis breath became heavy.He wasn\u2019t sure if this was the right thing to do, but at least he had faith in Roman, who was looking at him.He completely believed in Roman.Just like when Roman had saved him from the Blood Fang, he believed that Roman would save his life this time as well.\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201dHe clenched his teeth.In fact, he clenched them so hard that he could almost feel his teeth grind.Clack!Kevin grabbed the sword.Just when Kevin was about to cut off his arm, Roman\u2019s eyes lit up.\u2018Demonic Art of Hallucination.\u2019At the same time, mana began to swirl.Kevin\u2019s eyes turned hazy as soon as Roman used the Demonic Cult\u2019s martial arts. The Demonic Art of Hallucination, known to have deceived many people\u2019s souls in Murim, was displayed by him.Then, Kevin fell to the floor.In the real world, his face is buried dead on the floor, but in his hallucination, it\u2019s not much different from when he was about to cut off his hand with the sword.Now, Roman focused on the hallucination.And finally,Slash!Kevin\u2019s face contorted in pain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20 - Blind Trust (2)The Heavenly Demon Can\u2019t Live a Normal LifePublished onJun 30, 2022\u202212 min read\u2022441 viewsKevin was born outside the Dmitry Castle.He lived in a shack so run down that it could not even be called a home, and he followed his parents from a young age to help earn money.He started with simple errands, and there was nothing he didn\u2019t end up doing.He lived the life of the poor and didn\u2019t even dare to dream big or set goals because he was born in poverty.But still\u2026He wanted to live like everyone else.Rather than the life of a hero from a fairy tale, he just hoped for a life where he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about tomorrow\u2019s meal.And that\u2019s why\u2026Shudder.\u201cPant, Pant.\u201dHis hands trembled.A cold sweat ran down his forehead, and his gaze on his hand was blurred due to vertigo.His own hand.Was it okay to cut it?Roman did not force him to make a specific choice.Following Hans would obviously give him the life he had hoped for for a long time, but in Kevin\u2019s mind, he could still vividly remember the day he first met Roman.Roman was strong.He was a man who could take responsibility for his words, and he casually subjugated the Blood Fang, whom Kevin could not even dare to touch.The fact that Roman had power seemed so great.He had always lived a life in which he was used by others and was robbed of the things he wanted, so he couldn\u2019t ignore this moment when Roman presented him with a choice.\u2018Young Master Roman promised me a new life. So, I have to become someone who\u2019s useful to him.\u2019He clenched his teeth.And then,Slash!\u201cArghhhh!\u201dHe slashed at his hand.Due to the sensation of the sword cutting through his flesh, his mind, which had been accustomed to the pain of being beaten by others, was destroyed at once.Moreover, the problem was that he hadn\u2019t completely cut off his hand yet.The blade Roman had given him was blunt, and as he was a young boy with low physical strength, it took him dozens of slashes to cut through his hard bones.Crackle, Crunch.A dull sound was heard.It was the sound of forcibly cutting through the bones, a sound that made one experience goosebumps just by hearing it.Kevin\u2019s face went red as if it would explode at any moment, and he didn\u2019t even know what he was doing anymore.However.He just hoped.Roman had told him he could become strong.For the first time in his life, a \u2018dream\u2019 was created in his mind. And due to that dream, Kevin suppressed the pain and continued slashing.And finally,Thud.He had completely cut off his hand.His body was now completely drained of strength, and unable to control his body anymore, he fell into a pool of his own blood.And then, everything disappeared as if it had been a mirage.The blood that was splattered on the floor, the hand that rolled over it, and even the pain that seemed as if it would tear his mind apart at any moment. All of that was suddenly gone. He didn\u2019t know how that happened, but what was certain was that he had passed the trial.\u201cFrom now onwards, you will live as my irreplaceable sword.\u201dKevin\u2019s world suddenly changed.He got up despite his still-not-recovered spirit and fell on his face in front of Roman.\u201cI will follow my lord\u2019s orders.\u201dRoman.His life was going to be intertwined with Roman\u2019s for its remaining duration.Afterward, Roman parted ways with Kevin.When Roman returned to the room, Hans ran towards him while trembling.\u201cNo, young master! Where are you hurt? There is blood on the sword!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026\u201d\u201cHans.\u201dHans, who was checking Roman\u2019s body with a worried face, slowly moved his hand away after hearing the resolute voice.Young Master Roman is strong.Roman did not blink an eye even after subjugating the Blood Fang, so he knew that he was making a fuss over nothing.Also, there were no visible wounds. That meant the blood on Roman\u2019s sword belonged to someone else.Pfft.\u2018Tough brat.\u2019Roman laughed.In the incident with Kevin, Roman didn\u2019t want him to actually cut off his hand.He merely meant to test his will with a temporary illusion, but Kevin slashed down towards his hand before he could fall into the illusion completely.That was what resulted in the blood on the sword.Fortunately, the sword did not penetrate the flesh entirely due to Roman\u2019s quick reaction, but if the hallucination had been activated even a little later, Kevin\u2019s hand would have been completely cut off.He was tenacious.He wasn\u2019t the type of genius that is often praised, but his willpower was so great that no one could rival him in terms of that.And seeing Kevin swear his allegiance to him, Roman said in a blunt tone.\u201cThe mana cultivation method I will teach you in the future is extremely dangerous. When your strength is low, the pain isn\u2019t that bad, but the stronger you get, the more the pain worsens. It gets much worse than the pain you experienced earlier. Still, there is only one reason why I will be teaching you that method. This is a way for a boy in his mid-teens, who doesn\u2019t even know the fundamentals of using mana, to quickly become strong, and if you master this technique to the fullest, you will definitely have the strength to protect those around you.\u201dDemonic Spirit Art.As it cannot be properly explained by the terms of this world, I will just call it a mana cultivation method.Hearing Roman\u2019s words, Kevin was in awe.In this world, the mana cultivation method was not something insignificant commoners could learn.Although the risk was significant, when Roman said he would teach him a mana cultivation method, Kevin had no choice but to doubt reality.Roman was, of course, a good person.He saved him from being beaten, subjugated the Blood Fang, and presented a previously unimaginable future to him, a mere commoner.But why?Why does he believe in him?Kevin might learn the mana cultivation method and run away, so he couldn\u2019t understand why Roman had trusted him blindly.So, he simply asked him.\u201cWhy do you trust me, young master?\u201dRoman laughed.Kevin\u2019s words.They once again reminded him of the Crazy Demon.Once upon a time, the Crazy Demon was also an ordinary boy, and normally, there was no way he would be able to learn the martial arts of the Demonic Cult.He was only able to learn Demonic Spirit Art through Roman.At first, he did not take Roman\u2019s consideration seriously, but after years of subjugating Murim, the Crazy Demon asked why Roman trusted him blindly.The answer was simple.\u2018In order to receive blind trust, I must first trust the other person, even if that results in me being betrayed.\u2019That was Roman\u2019s belief.It was simply blind trust.He didn\u2019t need a reason; he just believed in others.However, Roman didn\u2019t explain it to Kevin.Blind trust loses its value as soon as reasoning is added.Moreover, Roman never worried about betrayal throughout his life.The stronger the people who follow you, the bigger their heads get.But they all eventually realize how dangerous it is to betray the person known as Baek Joong-hyuk.That\u2019s why he ended the conversation with just that.And now, Roman stared intently at his sword.He remembered a madman with a sword stained with blood, and from now on, he will have to do his best with Kevin, who resembled the madman.\u201cThings are going to get busy for me.\u201dThere were now two weeks until the party and about six months until the war.From now on, I have a lot to teach Kevin.Time is relative.While Kevin began to lead a fierce life, Chris had such a boring day that he wondered if it was okay to follow Roman.\u201cI\u2019m bored.\u201dHe yawned dozens of times.Chris saw Roman and Kevin training from a distance.\u201cEverything is about the foundation.\u201d\u201cEven if you do one thing, do it right.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t lose your concentration.\u201dHe knew what Roman was doing, but he couldn\u2019t understand it.\u2018Why on Earth did you pick up a strange kid from somewhere and are trying to teach him swordsmanship?\u2019If the kid were a great genius, it would be understandable.However, Kevin was neither a great genius nor had a status that would make others teach him.He was just a commoner.Moreover, he didn\u2019t know anything about swordsmanship.A sigh eventually came out of Chris\u2019 mouth.When I decided to follow Roman, I could never have imagined something like this.\u2018*I thought that if I followed Roman, I would learn the secret to becoming strong in a short time, just like he did. But what is this? He hasn\u2019t taught me anything yet. And unlike Kevin, he treats me as if I don\u2019t even exist. If I knew this would happen, I would have stuck with Master Jonathan and would\u2019ve swung my sword at least one more time. That would\u2019ve benefited me, at the very least.\u2019*His stomach was boiling.He wanted to run to Roman and scream at him.Still, he endured it because he had decided to follow him.He thought if he waited patiently, Roman would eventually teach him.But.\u201cOh, fuck this.\u201dThud!He threw his gloves on the ground.It\u2019s been a week already.Not being able to contain his anger after seeing Roman abandoning him and teaching only Kevin, Chris approached Roman and said, \u201cYoung Master Roman.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt has been over two weeks since I started following the young master. The first week went by as you decided to go into closed-door seclusion, and you only practiced with Keving for the second week. I sincerely apologize if you\u2019re doing this because you\u2019re not happy with me. Still, please teach me something like you are teaching Kevin. I am confident that I will be able to absorb your teachings well.\u201dHis will was strong.Seeing him express his will, Roman turned his gaze away from Kevin and stared at Chris.\u201cDid I not tell you already? Watch and learn.\u201d\u201c\u2026Was it really meant to be \u2018watch and learn\u2019? Aren\u2019t you supposed to teach me something special?\u201dChris was astonished.What does he mean?He thought that learning from those around him meant teaching, but he could not understand what Roman meant at all.\u201cYoung master! Even though I suffered a disastrous defeat in our duel, I am a person who reached 2-Star aura knight status in my mid-twenties. I can\u2019t waste my talent like this.\u201dChris\u2019 backlash was fierce.As he raised his voice as if he would not back down, Roman swallowed his feeling of laughing.It is as expected.He never thought Chris would tolerate being neglected forever.Roman said, \u201cEveryone has their own way. Since Kevin is ignorant, he needs someone to set the right way for him and guide him from start to finish until he reaches a certain level. However, you are different. No matter what instruction I would give you, you wouldn\u2019t really understand it and try to swallow the teachings by force. Do you know why? That\u2019s because I\u2019m the one who defeated you. All of that would inevitably result in your talents backfiring at you.\u201d\u201c\u2026So, are you telling me to keep watching?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dRoman waited for Chris to respond.Now was the time for him to show the reality to those who chose to follow him.\u201cIn order to accept reality, we need definite results. How about it? Do you want to have a duel with Kevin once? If you think you are right even after the duel, then I will teach you directly.\u201dRoman\u2019s suggestion didn\u2019t make sense to Chris.A duel with Kevin?It\u2019s just bizarre.Chris\u2019 doubts were quickly resolved with Roman\u2019s explanation.\u201cThe reason for the duel is simple. Kevin will fight against you by himself, but I\u2019ll be instructing him throughout the match on how to defeat you. So, prove your will to me by defeating Kevin, the \u2018avatar\u2019 that will be my sword in the future.\u201dRoman\u2019s words were that of a madman.And Chris was undoubtedly angry.\u2019\u2026Does this bastard think I\u2019m retarded?\u2019He admitted that he was defeated by Roman.Every morning, when I looked in the mirror, I looked at my flat, empty teeth and thought about that moment countless times.However.This is just not it.The opponent is a beginner who clearly doesn\u2019t even know all the basics of swordsmanship.Whether it is a duel or not, how can he defeat me?\u2018Yeah, I see how it is. Breaking my teeth wasn\u2019t enough for you, huh? You want to tame me. What you want from me is blind loyalty. However, I\u2019m not that easy. Even if it hurts someone loyal to you, the eldest son of Lord Dmitry, I can\u2019t stand still after being treated like this.\u2019His eyebrows were twitching.He truly wanted to do well.After speaking bitterly to my master and leaving the Dmitry Knights, I had a strong desire to accomplish many great things and return back to him.Moreover, I had to go for two weeks with no income.The dissatisfaction that had barely been suppressed until now exploded at Roman\u2019s provocations.\u201cFine. Let\u2019s do this. I\u2019m going to show you I\u2019m not such a weakling.\u201dChris thought that this time the result would be different.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21 - Blind Trust (3)The Heavenly Demon Can\u2019t Live a Normal LifePublished onJul 1, 2022\u202211 min read\u2022372 viewsKevin was just as embarrassed as Chris was in the current situation.As it was a duel Kevin did not intend for, he said with a pale face, \u201cYoung master, are you saying that I should have a duel with Knight Chris? That\u2019s just nonsense. At best, I\u2019m just a kid who\u2019s been practicing swordsmanship for a week, but isn\u2019t Knight Chris a skilled swordsman and a 2-Star Aura Knight?\u201dIt was a natural reaction.Chris.Who was he?He was the disciple of Jonathan, the Dmitry Knights\u2019 Commander, and a genius swordsman recognized by all of Dmitry.He was definitely not an opponent that average swordsmen could fight.Moreover, Kevin wasn\u2019t even an average swordsman; he was just a teenage boy.No matter how much willpower he had, there are some battles in life where the outcome is obvious, no matter how much one tries.Roman said, \u201cI know that you are at a disadvantage. Regardless, do you have anything to lose if you lose the duel?\u201d\u201c\u2026I do not.\u201d\u201cThere is something you need to keep in mind from now on, Kevin. There are countless others stronger than you in this world. Blood Fang, who oppressed your family and went as far as to use violence against them, was the same, and Chris, who is staring at you right now, is no different. Will you take a step backward every time because your opponent is stronger than you? If not, handle this situation differently.\u201dKevin was young. In fact, he was just a boy who was in his mid-teens.He was still at an age that needed mental care, but as he chose to be Roman\u2019s sword, he needed to live differently from before.\u201cThis duel is not a real battle. The only thing you will get from this fight is the frustration of being defeated and physical pain. Since it\u2019s like that, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a great opportunity? You have a chance to let loose and use everything you\u2019ve got against an enemy who is far stronger than you. I don\u2019t believe Chris can break your will. After all, you\u2019re someone who was willing to cut off their own arm in order to become stronger.\u201dThe life of commoners, the life of an aristocrat, and even the life of a swordsman who is willing to sacrifice his life in order to become strong; no matter whose life it was, it had boundaries.Nevertheless, Roman looked at Kevin, who was still a teenager, and told him to completely break down the boundaries.Just like when he had told him to cut off his own hand, he now told him to face the enemy known as Chris.Even if this was a real battle, Kevin needed to prove his worth as a sword by dealing with the enemy.\u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201dGulp.Kevin swallowed his dry saliva.His relationship with Roman was a series of choices.Roman never forced him to take a single path and told him to walk on his own path while following him.His throat burned.Chris.He had to fight an opponent whom he had looked up to whenever watching the procession of the Dmitry Knights.It was a previously unimaginable reality, but from the moment he had cut off his hand, Kevin became a completely different person.\u201c\u2026I will fight him.\u201dHe has malice.Seeing Kevin\u2019s firm grip on the sword, Roman let out a small smile.Kevin and Chris.The two men looked at each other.Kevin\u2019s shabby physique and posture proved it was an unfavorable fight. Seeing that, Chris felt his blood gushing upside down.\u2018I don\u2019t even need to compete with such a beginner to figure out who the victor will be.\u2019It was a miserable feeling.He looked at his opponent and noticed Kevin\u2019s posture was a mess.Nevertheless, he had thought there might have been a reason why Roman proposed a duel, but the appearance of Kevin holding a sword while looking at him completely shattered those thoughts.It was clear that he had no experience as a swordsman at all.At a glance, he was full of openings. In fact, Chris was skeptical of whether he could even defend properly with his unbalanced lower body.Kevin had been training only for a week. It was clear as day that there wasn\u2019t enough time to digest all the teachings Roman had given him.Kevin wasn\u2019t a genius at swordsmanship, as Chris had guessed. Moreover, he wasn\u2019t even qualified to be called a swordsman yet.That\u2019s why,\u2018Pathetic.\u2019Chris had that thought.Chris was currently 25 years old. He was taught swordsmanship by Jonathan from an early age. The time he spent shedding blood and sweat as a swordsman was much more than the time he lived as a commoner. It was definitely unlike any other commoner anyone had seen in Dmitry.His swordsmanship was his pride. In addition to his natural talent, he trained whilst aiming to become much stronger than anyone else; due to that, he achieved the feat of earning the title of 2-Star aura knight just in his mid-20s.Moreover, if he manages to achieve 3-Star before becoming 30 years old, he, who was considered only a genius, could possibly become the most powerful swordsman in the kingdom of Cairo.That\u2019s who Chris is.Just because he\u2019s rotting in Dmitry does not mean his talent can be ignored.\u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking, but you\u2019re wrong this time, young master. Variables also have limits. If I lose this duel against Kevin, I will completely give up my life as a swordsman.\u2019It was a desperate promise to himself.In his mind, he didn\u2019t want to duel with Kevin.However, the only reason he was standing with his sword until he made up his mind to fight Kevin was because of the look in his eyes.\u201cEverything about you is annoying.\u201dHis eyes were clearly filled with malice.It was evident that Kevin was serious.He was showcasing a sincere attitude as if he could truly defeat Chris.Due to that, Chris got even angrier.His opponent had no idea what was going on.He did not know how meek and lowly he was, and was trying to deal with Chris, a knight who had dedicated himself to the sword for decades, even though he had barely begun understanding basic swordsmanship.Chris acknowledged Roman\u2019s strength in the past. That was because Roman, whose swordsmanship he had experienced directly, was a man deserving of his acknowledgment. However, only seeing Kevin\u2019s gaze made his blood boil and made him want to punish him.\u2018I\u2019ll finish it within a minute.\u2019Grip.He clenched his sword firmly.Just then,\u201cStart.\u201dRoman gave the signal.As soon as Roman signaled for the duel to begin, Chris instantly kicked the ground.There was no reason for him to waste time on this duel.Chris instantly dug into one of Kevin\u2019s openings and attacked him, who had not yet come to his senses.Smack!A dull sound was heard.He didn\u2019t know if it was intentional or a coincidence, but Kevin barely blocked Chris\u2019 attack.However, just then, the difference in their strength caused Kevin\u2019s arms to shrink.Kevin tried to cover his exposed chest with a bewildered expression, but Chris\u2019 kick hit his stomach first.Thud!\u201cKeuk!\u201dHe screamed.It was such a shock that Chris knocked him over with just one kick. Now, Kevin was lying flat on the floor.Clearly, the duel had ended with just one attack.Chris didn\u2019t push his opponent further but glanced at Roman to see how he was judging the situation.\u2018Are you sure you want to continue seeing this match?\u2019Nevertheless, Roman remained calm.He explained the rules of the match silently, so Chris turned his gaze away and immediately attacked Kevin.\u2018Let\u2019s finish it at once.\u2019His sword was aimed at the opponent\u2019s arm.Kevin, who had been moaning in pain until now, jumped up from the ground when he saw Chris attacking him. To dodge that, he threw himself to the side.At that moment, the sound of the floor cracking rang in Kevin\u2019s ears.He understood that if he had been hit, it wouldn\u2019t have been strange if his arm had been broken. Naturally, his whole body was covered in goosebumps now.The difference in their skill was clear as day.Chris was a mountain that Kevin couldn\u2019t climb. However, Kevin still initiated a counterattack right after dodging the attack by swinging his sword.Swish.The sound of the sword was different this time. It was slow and light.Chris simply let him attack and dodged without hesitation. Once again, he kicked Kevin\u2019s abdomen.Thud!\u201cKhuk!\u201dKevin swallowed a cry.Kevin, who had previously pushed past the pain of cutting off his hand, staggered with a face that looked like it would explode at any moment.However, he did not fall even with the strong impact of the kick. He barely took a step and avoided the follow-up attack from Chris, but Kevin was so helpless and weak that continuing this duel was virtually pointless.It was literally a one-sided confrontation.Indeed, it was strange. Roman had offered a duel as if Kevin would win on his own, but he failed to demonstrate even the basics of swordsmanship, let alone winning the duel.\u2018What the hell were you thinking, allowing him to fight?\u2019Ten steps away from Chris, Roman was silently watching the duel.The meaning of the duel was to use Kevin, teach him how to fight in a duel, and make him grow up.In the end, the duel was going as expected.The situation would not have changed even if Roman had taught him a secret method, but he was rather angry at the futile duel.Smack!Facing continuous attacks from Chris, Kevin\u2019s arms trembled. Clearly, his willpower alone could not withstand Chris\u2019 attacks, and while his posture was disturbed, Chris\u2019s attacks burst all over Kevin\u2019s body.Ironically, it was Chris\u2019 way of showing mercy.Even though the duel was fought using a wooden sword, Chris deliberately did not use the sword to attack his vitals, hoping his opponent would not be fatally injured.Even just that, inevitably, showed the difference in their skills.Even if Kevin struggled with his incredible willpower, he couldn\u2019t get over the wall known as Chris, who had been training with a sword for decades.In the end,Smack!\u201c\u2026Ugh.\u201dA fist to his stomach left him choking on his own blood. Kevin staggered while struggling to stay on his knees, and Chris raised an angry voice and said to Kevin, \u201cGive up.\u201dThe fight was clearly over.Even though he had already had several chances to finish it, Chris only cared about winning by making him submit.Regardless, Kevin endured. Grasping his trembling leg, he aimed his sword at Chris as if trying to block the next attack that would come his way.\u2018Why the hell are you doing this?\u2019Kevin\u2019s current appearance was the definition of miserable. As he had rolled over the ground several times, his clothes had become ragged, and his torn top revealed a reddish abdomen. Furthermore, he was currently spewing blood out of his mouth.It was clear that he had suffered a tremendous shock to his internal organs, and as blood leaked out of them, his heart cooled down.That was his limit.This could be a really dangerous situation for him.However, even though victory and defeat were clear as crystal, Kevin\u2019s appearance of him still aiming his sword at Chris was beyond his understanding.\u201cDon\u2019t assume you\u2019re a talented person just because you\u2019ve been attacked only a few times. From the beginning, and throughout the match, I never did my best. I could have smashed your tofu-like head at any given moment, but I showed mercy since this was a duel. That\u2019s the difference between you and me. I don\u2019t know what you were thinking when you accepted this duel, but for a normal person who doesn\u2019t even know how to use mana, I think you\u2019ve done well considering how much you endured.\u201dChris simply told the truth. Back when he had fought Roman, it was, obviously, different. He couldn\u2019t defeat Roman even though he gave it his all; however, for Kevin, he didn\u2019t even need to do his best.It was truly sad and regretful. That made Kevin feel even more miserable.Also, this was as patient as Chris could be.\u201cI will say this one last time. Give up. If you show the will to fight anymore, I will cripple at least one of your limbs.Truly, it was his last warning.It was the last mercy he would show to Kevin in this duel.Kevin is just a puppet. He had no reason to offend Chris. However, when he was told to admit the reality, a smile appeared on Kevin\u2019s face, much to Chris\u2019 surprise.\u201cKeke.\u201dHe suddenly started laughing.As if he didn\u2019t mind smiling, Kevin didn\u2019t even bother to hide the laughter that rose from within.Then, he said while smiling, \u201cLet\u2019s go all the way.\u201dHe gripped the sword tightly.He knew that what Chris had said was correct.However, this one-sided duel was completely different in Kevin\u2019s mind.That was because, from the start until now, Kevin was following Roman\u2019s instructions and had no intention of giving up in this duel without Roman\u2019s orders.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22 - Blind Trust (4)The Heavenly Demon Can\u2019t Live a Normal LifePublished onJul 4, 2022\u202212 min read\u2022193 viewsWhen the duel began, Kevin heard a familiar voice in his ears.- Raise your sword and block the front. Chris will attempt a surprise attack.It was Roman\u2019s voice.Kevin did not know the identity of the telepathic message that transmitted voice through mana, so he was not sure what judgment to make at that moment. There was a momentary hesitation. He couldn\u2019t fully understand what had happened to him, but when he realized that Roman was the owner of the voice, he instinctively followed what he said.And then,Clack!\u201c\u2026!\u201dThere was a tingling shock in his hand.He had only blocked the front as Roman instructed, but he unknowingly blocked Chris\u2019s pre-emptive attack as well.- Move to the side. After that, aim for Chris\u2019 chest as he tries to kick you.Kevin wanted to follow Roman\u2019s next command. However, his reaction speed was slower than expected, and Chris\u2019 kick that Roman had predicted had hit his stomach before he even saw it.Thud!\u201cKuak!\u201dHe naturally screamed.His breath stopped in his throat for a moment, and Kevin, who had fallen to the floor, grabbed his stomach. Afterward, thick saliva dripped from his mouth.Kevin had cut off his hand just a week ago. Nevertheless, the pain was hard to get used to.Just then,- Throw yourself to the right.A voice penetrated his mind.Kevin knew that in order to live, he had to obey the commands.He forced himself to swallow the pain and threw himself to the right while seeing Chris swinging his sword at him, as Roman had expected.- Attack Chris\u2019 left chest.There was a momentary opening.Chris swung his sword broadly, which created an opening, and Kevin knew that he would be able to defeat him in a single blow if he attacked him now.However, this time as well, the attack was unsuccessful due to Kevin\u2019s lack of ability. His speed of swinging the sword was slow enough for Chris to yawn, and the attack couldn\u2019t reach Chris due to his tangled steps. In short, it was a complete failure.It was so bad that Chris didn\u2019t even know that his opponent was aiming for his opening. It was an attack that could be easily avoided, and with Chris\u2019 counterattack, Kevin was once again kicked in the stomach.Thud!\u201cKeuk!\u201dIt was a one-sided fight.Kevin was devastated without even being able to counterattack; he wanted to sit down immediately because his blood had come up, and he was suffering from excruciating pain. Regardless, the words of giving up did not come out of his mouth even once.Aside from the fact that Roman hadn\u2019t given him an order to give up, what was happening now was also funny.\u2018Young Master Roman is omnipotent. Chris is acting like a puppet and doing the same actions he had said.\u2019Roman\u2019s voice was like a prophecy. When he said Chris was going to attack from the right, the same thing happened in reality. Moreover, Roman\u2019s instructions also gave him an opportunity to actually knock Chris down.However, Chris\u2019 skills were much higher than that of Kevin\u2019s. Thus, he was unable to fight and follow Roman\u2019s instructions that well. If he could follow Roman\u2019s advice, this was a duel that Chris would have lost right at the beginning, but his useless body wasn\u2019t able to follow the simple instructions.How funny. Chris is a 2-Star aura knight. He\u2019s someone that ordinary people like myself look up to, but Young Master Roman is making fun of him by controlling him as if he were in the palm of his hand.Kevin now understood\u2014Why did Roman send him to have a duel with Kevin?Roman was telling him something indirectly.\u2018This is the level of Young Master Roman. Even Chris, known as Dmitry\u2019s greatest genius, can\u2019t even touch his feet when we compare their true abilities. Such a person is the young master I will be loyal to for the rest of my life. And, even if he instructs me to do something that is out of the boundaries of common sense, I have to blindly follow what he says.\u2019His way forward and his future goals; Along with them, a figure of Roman appeared in front of him.Just as when he had followed Roman\u2019s words and cut off his own hand, he now developed a blind trust that if he followed Roman, he would definitely be able to become stronger.In just one match, Roman had given him the basis for why he should put his faith in him and follow him. At the same time, he also showed why he should be respected.Kevin now ignored the physical pain and completely immersed himself in the duel, so Chris\u2019 warning didn\u2019t work.\u201cI will say this one last time. Give up. If you show the will to fight anymore, I will cripple at least one of your limbs.Truly, it was his last warning.Kevin chuckled, \u2018*Is he telling me to give up?\u2019*It doesn\u2019t matter. Chris doesn\u2019t know the truth\u2014that he is a puppet. Young Master Roman is someone who can toy with a knight like Chris. But then, why would he train me, a boy in his teens with no talent? No matter how much I think about it, there is only one answer. Trust and Loyalty. If my body is weak, then I need to prove my mental strength isn\u2019t.\u201cLet\u2019s go all the way.\u201dThat sentence was Kevin\u2019s decision. Even if this battle got even more bloody, Kevin wanted to prove his worth.Their perspective and the world they saw were completely different. Chris didn\u2019t understand Kevin\u2019s determination, so he exploded at the sight of Kevin, who didn\u2019t give up until the very end.Clack.His patience had now entirely run out. The heart that earlier felt sorry for his opponent was now overshadowed by anger.\u201cYou don\u2019t even know your place\u2026!\u201dTap tap.He kicked off the ground violently.Chris had initially thought Kevin had nothing to do with this. However, it\u2019s a different story if he ignores the decades Chris had devoted to the sword and shows the spirit of a fighter who does not give up until the end. Now, there was a need to win this fight overwhelmingly and make Kevin regret his mistake for the rest of his life. As a result of the disastrous choice he had made, he would need to live with the consequence of being crippled.Chris was swift.Like a ray of light, he quickly dug into Kevin\u2019s opening in an instant and swung his sword at an unbelievable speed while aiming for his opponent\u2019s shoulder.Losing his arm\u2014That was the price he would have to pay for his mistake.However, the moment the wooden sword was about to cut his arm, Kevin took a step forward.- One step forward.Clack.\u201c\u2026!\u201dChris opened his eyes widely.One step forward\u2014That was a safe spot.Still, it was like presenting his head where the wooden sword would fall, and it was also similar to the time Roman defeated Chris.Nevertheless, Kevin did not hesitate.Even knowing he might die, he stepped forward. That gave him a chance to attack before his opponent.And then,- Attack with all your might.He followed his last orders.Kevin clenched his teeth and swung his sword from the bottom up, and a crude blow split the wind and aimed at his opponent. It was extremely close. Their bodies were entangled. And as a result,Crack!There was the sound of something breaking.While dripping blood, a man\u2019s body fell backward like a puppet with a broken thread.With his momentary victory, the winner stood right there.\u201cTenacious bastard.\u201dThe winner was Chris.As he looked at him with weary eyes, he saw blood flowing from Kevin. Clearly, the fight was now over. And fortunately, Kevin\u2019s life was not in danger.Due to Kevin\u2019s difference in fighting style, Chris had to overcome the crisis by blocking the subsequent attack with the wooden sword; it only tore his skin as it rubbed against his forehead. However, the wooden sword was broken due to the powerful blow. And in the final kick that dug into his stomach, Kevin, whose pain had accumulated and become unbearable, fell backward.He was really tenacious.His will to see the match until the end, even though it could endanger his life, made complicated emotions arise in Chris and changed the way he looked at Kevin.Nevertheless, the winner was Chris.While taking care of Kevin, Roman said, \u201cAs promised, if you want, I will teach you from tomorrow. From now on, the choice is yours.\u201dThat was the end of it.Roman was now busy treating Kevin\u2019s wounds as if Chris wasn\u2019t even there anymore.Nevertheless, it was an ironic scene. Roman was the one who had made Kevin fight recklessly in the duel, but he was now treating Kevin as if he was extremely precious to him.\u201c\u2026Why the hell did I fight?\u201dChris returned home while lost in thought.He initially intended to get Roman\u2019s attention by defeating Kevin, but the unexpected development had now complicated his thoughts. In fact, accepting the duel was already his loss.In a lose-lose battle, Chris was overwhelmed by Kevin\u2019s resilience\u2014especially in the last part. At that moment, Chris remembered his past.\u2018It was like Young Master Roman. The judgment of taking a step forward was both a perfect attack and a perfect defense.\u2019What if\u2026What if I hadn\u2019t experienced the same judgment while fighting Roman? That duel is still a shame for me, but I am not sure if I could have completely dodged Kevin\u2019s attack without using mana.Memories of his past became experiences. He reacted quickly to the situation only because he had pondered that moment countless times in his head. That was exactly why Chris tried to counterattack after dodging Kevin\u2019s attack in reverse.A strange thrill arose in him thinking about that. Even though the opponent was just an ordinary person, Chris burst out laughing, shockingly realizing the fact that he had improved from the past.Roman didn\u2019t teach him anything, but he still made progress. Only the experience of fighting Roman became the foundation for his development and helped him become a swordsman who could respond differently in the same situation.Not only that\u2026\u2018Looking back, Kevin\u2019s judgments were outstanding. I thought Young Master Roman hadn\u2019t given Kevin any instructions, but now it feels like he did. Honestly, if Kevin had been a little quicker and stronger than a commoner, that last judgment might have made me the loser.\u2019Chris recalled the memories of his duel. He imagined failing a surprise first strike and getting a counterattack, and thought of another way to deal with it. He carefully analyzed each moment. Looking at each one, he tried to figure out how Roman judged situations.\u2018I thought Young Master Roman was Dmitry\u2019s fool, just like the rumors floating around. However, I lost the duel with him back then, and this time, I gained confidence by playing a duel with Kevin. Young Master Roman is not just a genius. I can\u2019t understand him no matter how much I try. However, I am certain of one thing. He\u2019s reached a level that even my mentor, Knights\u2019 Captain Jonathan, can\u2019t reach.\u2019He couldn\u2019t even begin to fathom the realm Roman was living and thinking in. It was not just about physical strength, but the world that Roman\u2019s mind saw was different.What does he even see?Just by clashing swords with Roman once and only trying to understand Roman\u2019s judgment in the duel, his mind was mixed with countless teachings. It was a world he had never experienced when he was in the Dmitry Knights. The more he analyzed his own experience, the more Chris came out with pure admiration.He could now see the meaning of what Roman earlier said. He didn\u2019t mean to simply stay by his side, but he meant to look at him and find a way to become stronger by himself.\u201cWas I such an idiot?\u201dPfft.He began laughing. Now that he thought about it, Roman had given him a lot of hints.While teaching Kevin, he said a lot of things directed at Chris, but as he was teaching the basics, Chris did not pay much attention to it.He rejected them due to prejudice. As he was a swordsman who had reached a certain level, he bowed his head to learn, but he was not in the position to receive basic instructions.But\u2026Now I understand.Just by watching Roman and realizing and improving himself, he could reach a different level.\u201c\u2026I, Chris, don\u2019t know you properly yet. The Roman Dmitry I remember is a flawed human being called Dmitry\u2019s Fool, but what you\u2019ve shown me lately is beyond my understanding. What is certain is that I acknowledge you. From now on, by your side, I will observe and learn everything until I surpass you.\u201dIt was a promise to himself. Talking to himself, Chris had set a new goal.And the next day, Chris went to Roman and said, \u201cYou do not need to teach me yourself, young master. I will find a way to become stronger by myself while following you.\u201dThat day, Chris thought that until he surpassed Roman, he would live as Roman\u2019s sword.However, did he know?\u2014These remarks he spat out with blood were a lifelong vow to decide which lord he would follow for the rest of his life. And it was also the moment his future in Cairo had been decided.Eventually, time passed.A week later.Today was the day of Barco\u2019s party.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 - What Happened at the Banquet (1)Around the time when Kevin\u2019s training was getting more intense, Baron Romero officially announced something that shook the entire area around Dmitry.\u201cThe marriage of Dmitry and Lawrence has been broken.\u201dThe breakup\u2014People knew what that meant. It meant that Dmitry\u2019s protection to resolve the conflict with Barco had disappeared, leaving Lawrence to prepare for war by themselves.In such a situation, naturally, people started gossiping. Baron Romero had announced that the Lawrence family\u2019s irresponsible attitude was the reason for the breakup, but the public\u2019s interpretation was different.\u201cThe reason for the breakup? Obviously, the flower of Lawrence decided to marry for the sake of her family, but when she experienced Dmitry\u2019s Fool firsthand, she couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. Other than that, why would Lawrence demand a breakup? Even though Barco\u2019s blade was reaching the front of her neck, the fact that she still made such a decision means that Dmitry\u2019s Fool was worse than the rumors.\u201d\u201cNo way. Making that decision even if the family is destroyed? But what about the rumors that Dmitry\u2019s eldest son subjugated the Blood Fang?\u201d\u201cDo you seriously believe those rumors? There\u2019s no way someone who\u2019s been called Dmitry\u2019s Fool for decades could subjugate Blood Fang out of the blue. He probably pulled some strings to improve his reputation to avoid a breakup. It\u2019s not that the new Roman Dmitry wasn\u2019t enough, but Lawrence demanded a divorce because he wasn\u2019t up to their expectations.\u201dThat was the public opinion. Roman\u2019s reputation was terrible. He had lived his whole life as a fool, and Flora Lawrence was praised as the flower of Lawrence.With one incident, he had achieved a different reputation from his past. However, the people had seen how badly responsible Roman Dmitry was, and although his reputation was improved by the subjugation of the Blood Fang, the one-sided perception could not be changed entirely.Nevertheless, the Dmitry family did not take any action. The Baron knew that it was not a fact that could be changed by using every word in the dictionary, and it was an undeniable reality that Roman Dmitry had lived his past life like a fool.However, he trusted the changed Roman. He was completely different from the rumors, so the Baron was able to laugh at people\u2019s reactions and continue his work without minding them.In such a situation, the bright day for Barco\u2019s social party came.\u201c\u2026Do you seriously want me to wear this?\u201dRoman\u2019s expression hardened, and his eyes trembled. He looked tired of the clothes that caught his eye, luxurious and decorated with gold thread splendidly.Hans said, \u201cYoung master, this is your first public appearance after the breakup with Lawrence. The status of the young master and the Dmitry family is on the line, so you can\u2019t just wear any clothes. By the way, to explain this garment, it is the work of Pierre, a craftsman working in the North-East area, and we spent a lot of money to get rid of the waiting time due to dozens of people ordering from him and to make the custom-made clothes. The man was not driven solely by money, so it took quite a while to convince him even though we carried a lump of money. But now, are you saying you won\u2019t wear this masterpiece created through blood and sweat?\u201dTwo weeks ago, shortly after Roman announced his intention to attend the banquet, Hans started to go and look for clothes for Roman every day. He even checked the fabric and if the color would suit Roman\u2019s tastes. Seeing Hans contact famous artisans for him, he again realized how unusual he was.Regardless, seeing his assertive attitude that seemed as if it wouldn\u2019t tolerate rejection, Roman had no choice but to smile and nod.\u201cI get it. I\u2019ll wear it.\u201dIn the past, people often thought of the devil when they heard the word \u201cHeavenly Demon.\u201d They believed him to be a monster that had neither blood nor tears, and someone who would cut off their heads at once even if they asked to be his prisoner.In fact, when he was on his way to reaching the peak of his martial arts, there were many instances when he would condemn his subordinates with a cruel heart. However, Roman never ignored the devotion of his subordinates.And Hans was a man who showed his devotion to him thoroughly. Although the Dmitry family grants him daily bread and salary, he has a sincere heart for Roman. That\u2019s why he even went in search of the best craftsmen and asked them to make clothes for Roman. However, what was his reason behind those actions? Honestly, Hans didn\u2019t want material rewards; he just hoped that Roman would happily accept the dress he brought for him.Roman smiled\u2014just because it was a particularly effortless action. Even though the colorful clothes looked burdensome to him, he showed a smiling face to Hans while struggling to hide his hardened expression.\u2018Just looking at it makes me choke on my breath, but if the rules of this world are like this, then I need to follow them.\u2019When someone stays in the kingdom, they often hear a saying that they must obey the kingdom\u2019s laws. And now was the time for Roman to adapt to them\u2014just as he had adapted to reality as a child by following instructions that came from above in a dark cavern. Now, Roman clearly knew when to take the lead and when he had to follow what was made in advance. He decided to wear the fancy clothes. It meant accepting reality, and also meant Roman was adjusting to the new world.It took him quite some time to change into them. Regardless, Hans\u2019 eyes suddenly turned into hearts when he finally saw Roman come out with the changed clothes.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s really, really cool.\u201dThe clothes were a combination of black and gold. In the golden light that bloomed on a serious and charismatic black background, Roman looked like a nobleman with a high reputation.At that moment, Hans became sure\u2014the main character of Barco\u2019s banquet would be his young master, Roman Dmitry.Chris and Kevin\u2014They were the two people who would accompany Roman to the banquet. As they were following him as escorts, they were armed differently than usual.Clack clack.The rustling of the armor resounded loudly. As Chris was in the knight uniform, he wore a custom-made armor. The armor, which was silver, adequately fitted to his body and shimmered in the sun. Also, his golden hair was fluttering gracefully in the wind. That figure proved why Chris was called a handsome swordsman. His posture and appearance right now were just confident and gorgeous.Glance.He looked at the sword hanging from his waist. A sword of a suitable length so as not to touch the ground was engraved with a pattern symbolizing Dmitry.\u201cWhy is he so late?\u201dKevin hadn\u2019t come out yet. As the principle was that the escort should finish their preparations before their master, Chris showed a slight dissatisfaction at Kevin\u2019s delay.Just then, from afar, a silhouette of a dwarf stature jumped out.Clack clack.\u201c\u2026Sorry!\u201dIt was Kevin. And his look\u2026 was the exact opposite of Chris.As it was only recently decided that he would be the second escort, custom armor couldn\u2019t be made for him, who was only a commoner. Moreover, due to him being in his mid-teens, an armor that could fit him couldn\u2019t be found either.So he just put on armor that matched the size of the blacksmith. The problem was that even that was too big for Kevin, and Chris gave an absurd smile seeing a helmet big enough to cover most of his sweaty forehead.\u2018I have to escort Roman with this guy.\u2019Kevin\u2014He was just like a boy soldier. Even if you ignored his sloppy appearance and ignorance of the etiquettes of escorts, Kevin couldn\u2019t even hold his center properly in his armor.The day the two fought each other, Chris didn\u2019t like Kevin\u2019s tenacity. It was not that he didn\u2019t understand Kevin\u2019s plight, but his ignorance of Chris\u2019s training and devotion to his sword sparked something inside him.Was that why?Seeing Kevin grabbing the helmet that kept dropping down, Chris said sharply, \u201cWe are the lord\u2019s escort and the face of Dmitry. Whatever happens outside, don\u2019t act hastily. The young master\u2019s reputation depends on our actions as well, so we should be especially careful with our words and actions.\u201dThe last duel\u2014because of that, Chris decided to sincerely follow Roman.Back in the day, I wouldn\u2019t care Dmitry\u2019s Fool or whatever he was known as, but now I can\u2019t afford to see Roman being ignored or disrespected. He\u2019s my own master.Roman Dmitry\u2019s reputation would soon be that of his own, so he knew that from now on, he had to be extra careful with his words and deeds, just for the sake of his master. On the other hand, Kevin was worried. As he didn\u2019t know anything about a knight\u2019s etiquette, he might make a mistake at a banquet where etiquette is extremely important.That was why Kevin nodded his head seriously after hearing Chris\u2019 words.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll keep that in mind, sir knight.\u201d\u201cGreat.\u201dA smile appeared on Chris\u2019 face when he was called by the title of knight. He and Kevin are in the same position right now, but Kevin still called Chris \u2018Knight\u2019, probably because it was difficult for him to evaluate himself on the same level as Chris.Maybe it was because he was a little relieved now? Chris suddenly walked over to Kevin and fixed the crooked helmet.And\u2026The time has arrived. Seeing Roman come out, Chris and Kevin packed their things.Now it was time to leave for Barco.Barco\u2019s banquet.The hottest topic of discussion at the banquet was that Lawrence\u2019s Flower and Dmitry\u2019s eldest son\u2014both who broke their marriage\u2014would be attending the banquet.The banquet had already started. And seeing that Roman Dmitry had not yet appeared, the drunken nobleman at the banquet said to the man standing next to him, \u201cWhat the hell is that guy, Roman, thinking? Even though he knew that Barco\u2019s eldest son wanted Flora, he insisted on an arranged marriage, then abruptly broke the marriage and announced his intention to attend Barco\u2019s party.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why he\u2019s called a fool. He would have chosen one of the two things if he was a smart guy.\u201d\u201cI guess. It is common sense to either fight against Barco by pushing the arranged marriage to the end or to turn away from Lawrence for the sake of a smooth relationship with Barco in the first place. Because of Roman Dmitry\u2019s actions, the Dmitry family\u2019s position has become really ambiguous now. They are indeed a dominant force in the North-East region, but marrying Lawrence and trying to maintain a good relationship with Barco in the future is just too greedy and unrealistic.\u201d\u201cAnd they say Roman Dmitry is coming to the banquet to make up for his mistakes. What a funny guy, hahaha.\u201dThe nobles laughed. Roman was an object of ridicule for them. He was now known as the guy who ignored the relationship between the families and behaved in his own way, but was eventually abandoned due to the breakup of his marriage with Flora.It was obvious why he was coming to the banquet\u2014abandoned by both sides, he seemed to be trying to restore his relationship with Barco now.All over the banquet, conversations on the topic of Roman blossomed. Most of them were people who had experienced Roman by meeting him themselves, so there was no hesitation in remarks that demeaned Roman at the banquet.Even among an aristocratic crowd, Roman\u2019s reputation was low. Dmitry\u2019s name prevented him from being ignored while in front of them, but they couldn\u2019t help but gossip behind his back.In that situation, a noblewoman who didn\u2019t know about him asked, \u201cWho is Roman Dmitry?\u201d\u201cYou will see it for yourself. He has a dirty look and a small physique, so he\u2019s not a good-looking guy. By the way, he is so pretentious only because he is Dmitry\u2019s eldest son. He always had a bad reputation from the beginning among the nobility. To put it bluntly, if I were Flora Lawrence, I would have objected to marrying him, even if I had to bite my own tongue.\u201d\u201cIs he that bad?\u201d\u201cWould he be called Dmitry\u2019s Fool for no reason? A lit chimney must smoke. Once he drinks alcohol, he will naturally reveal who he really is.\u201dJust then, when the party is about to ripen more, Barco\u2019s servant exclaimed with a deep voice.\u201cRoman Dmitry, the eldest son of the Dmitry family, has arrived.\u201dRoman.Hearing that name, the attention of the people, who had been gossipping about him until now, was simultaneously focused on a single place.And\u2026At that place, the door opened, and Roman entered the banquet hall.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 - What Happened at the Banquet (2)In the current situation, most nobles attending the banquet had already experienced Roman\u2019s true nature. He often appeared at banquets while hanging out with Anthony, and those who watched him always thought how pathetic he was while doing drunken acts with his face flushed red.Therefore, the nobles naturally saw the scars and weaknesses of Roman. They didn\u2019t know the reason for the breakup. So, they thought Flora had broken up due to seeing how he behaved at banquets and couldn\u2019t see him positively anymore.However, everyone held their breath when Roman appeared at the banquet today. He seemed to be truly representing Dmitry\u2019s title, unlike in the past, and people saw a different person from the Roman they knew.\u2018Is that seriously Roman Dmitry?\u2019\u2018How is he so different from before?\u2019In their memories, Roman was a man who wasn\u2019t even good-looking. His not-so-tall stature made him look even smaller due to his small physique, and his dirty skin ultimately destroyed Roman\u2019s image. Moreover, even his gait was terrible.Knowing that Dmitry\u2019s second son was different from Roman, rumors circulated that Roman was an illegitimate child and could not hide his vulgarity.But now, Roman was utterly different from the past. His gait was calm, and his broad shoulders and muscles that could not be hidden even with clothes were visible to everyone. Moreover, his skin was so clean as if it were milk. In the past, his face had many problems, so his eyes also didn\u2019t show any charm, but now, his black eyes and red lips seemed to highlight his milk-white skin and make him look even more handsome. And finally, everyone noticed the gorgeous clothes, which exuded the aura of a dragon. The clothes having gold thread on a black background emphasized Roman\u2019s charisma to the fullest.Murmur murmur.\u201cDid Roman really look like this?\u201d\u201c\u2026Absolutely not. In the past, he was definitely shorter than me, but now, even at a single glance, I can see the difference in our height.\u201dThe nobles murmured.In the past, Roman often tried hard to decorate himself and win people\u2019s hearts, but he could not create the atmosphere like now. It wasn\u2019t just a difference in appearance; it was the difference in the atmosphere and aura that people have accumulated over the course of their lives. And the frivolity of the life of Roman, who could not achieve anything, was now changed\u2014even fundamentally.Roman and Baek Joong-hyuk\u2014The two had lived completely different lives.Baek Joong-hyuk, who stood on the apex of Murim and looked down on others, had the power to catch others\u2019 focus with his appearance alone.A person\u2019s appearance is an extremely important factor in their life. As proof of that, at first, everyone had thought of staying away from Roman, but seeing the change made people want to talk to him at least once.Was that why? Some nobles started to approach Roman. The first noble to approach him was a woman. After asking other nobles about Roman and hearing the bad rumors, she couldn\u2019t contain her curiosity at the fact that he was so different from his reputation.\u201cIt is an honor to meet you. I am Sophia of the Grisel family.\u201dTap.Roman stopped walking. As his calm, sunken eyes turned to Sophia, Sophia said with a slightly blushed face, \u201cYou are probably not familiar with the Grisel family name. My father, Baron Grisel, and ancestors have dedicated themselves to the kingdom of Cairo from generation to generation. It\u2019s not a great family, but it doesn\u2019t have a bad history.\u201dSophia was the daughter of a lower aristocrat. He had settled in a small land on the outskirts, and his position in the kingdom was so low that people did not know that the family named Grisel had inherited the Baron title from generation to generation. Still, the reason she was able to attend the Barco family\u2019s banquet was because Sophia was beautiful. Her beautiful appearance and the condition of being a noblewoman were enough for her to receive Anthony Barco\u2019s invitation.Was that why Sophia needed to describe her family? The fact that she came from a lower aristocracy lowered her self-esteem and status, so she needed to explain herself to whomever she met. On the contrary, Barco and Dmitry were different. There was no need for them to explain about their families to whomever they met. Not knowing their names in the North-East area of the kingdom of Cairo was the same as not having the qualifications to be a noble.Just then, Roman spoke, \u201cI know the Grisel family well. As a nobleman of Cairo, there is no way for me to not know the name of a family with a history of more than 100 years.\u201d\u201c\u2026Do you really know about the Grisel family?\u201dHearing Roman\u2019s words, Sophia\u2019s eyes widened. She initially just wanted to have a normal conversation with Roman, but she didn\u2019t think that Roman would know about the Grisel family.\u2018Is he just pretending to know?\u2019\u00a0Doubts naturally arose in her mind.Not recognizing a noble family was an act of rudeness, so occasionally, people would pretend to know even if they didn\u2019t know.She thought Roman was the same. Otherwise, how would he know the Grisel family, who had never made a name for themselves outside the outskirts?But\u2026\u201cI once heard my father explain about the Grisel family. They are a family that has established their home in the North-East area for many years, and the wood they produce is famous for its excellent quality in the whole kingdom of Cairo. And, isn\u2019t the pattern of the family also a giant tree with wide branches? I heard your brother recently succeeded in mana sensitivity, and I sincerely congratulate him on his achievement.\u201d\u2019\u2026Ah!\u2019\u00a0Hearing those words, Sophia\u2019s doubts were utterly shattered. Now, she was sure\u2014Roman truly knew about the Grisel family, and she didn\u2019t need to explain herself further to him.He\u2019s brilliant and knowledgeable.The mere fact that Roman recognized the Grisel family made Sophia think so.\u2018Maybe Roman Dmitry is a different man than the rumors.\u2019Hearing the first conversation of Roman at the banquet, people\u2019s eyes widened as if they had seen something unbelievable.Two weeks earlier.Announcing his intention to attend the banquet, Roman asked Hans a favor he had never asked for before.\u201cHans, when you\u2019re free, bring me all the information we have about the families located in the North-East. It should definitely contain what kind of families there are in the North-East area of the kingdom of Cairo, what the pattern of that family is, and what has happened recently in their estates. To attend a banquet, I need to at least know the background of the people I will be meeting.\u201dIt was an unexpected request. However, Hans did not ask questions, just as usual, and brought all information from the surrounding area as Roman had asked him to. Roman read the information whenever he had free time.It was definitely annoying to learn the patterns of a family he didn\u2019t even know and to read information about people he had never met. Nevertheless, Roman knew that this was necessary.\u2018I am not a commoner. I will be attending Barco\u2019s banquet as the eldest son of Dmitry, on behalf of the family. So I need to have the minimum amount of courtesy. What kind of family the people I will meet will belong to, and how has that family been from older generations? As I am considered to be Dmitry\u2019s Fool, it will take a lot of effort to win other people\u2019s hearts.\u2019Before he reached the peak of the Demonic Cult, Baek Joong-hyuk studied the role of a ruler. In the world of survival of the fittest, strength was the number one value, but experience had shown him how important it was to remember names while and after forming human relationships.Thousands, tens of thousands of servants\u2014When he called out their names, even though he had never talked much with them, they gave their lives for Baek Joong-hyuk.How funny. Just because he remembered their names, people shouted Baek Joong-hyuk\u2019s name and said it was worth giving their life for him.\u2018Relationships between people start with the smallest things. People who know me as Dmitry\u2019s Fool will be prejudiced from the start, but if I remember and recognize their names, their attitude will definitely change. In order to get people\u2019s attention, I need to give them attention first, and since I have decided to live as Roman Dmitry, I need to put a lot of effort into it.\u2019Sophia Grisel\u2014Roman hadn\u2019t ever seen her. However, when she spoke to him and identified herself as Grisel, Roman remembered everything about her.\u2018The Grisel family\u2026\u2019\u00a0Their patterns, their history, and all the big things that happened in their estate recently\u2014Roman remembered it all.Eventually, seeing the friendly atmosphere between Roman and Sophia, nobles who had hesitated earlier began to flock to Roman.The banquet suddenly got noisy. And at the center of it all was, of course, Roman.\u201cIt\u2019s lovely to meet the eldest son of the Bolt family. Of course, I know the Bolt family well. Didn\u2019t Viscount Bolt go to the battlefield and make great achievements in the past? As I read the events of that time in a book, I thought that later on, I would have to deliver myself on the battlefield just like Viscount Bolt.\u201d\u201cIs your mother doing well? I recently heard rumors that she has a chronic illness, and the colder the weather, the more she needs to take care of her health.\u201d\u201cWas it 10 years ago? The deal with the Heros family made Dmitry a great profit. My father always told me how caring the Heros family was, so I am also very grateful to the Heros family.\u201dRoman\u2014He was the pinnacle of the Demonic Cult, and at one time, he had established undisputed control along with power. People often said that it was thanks to his mighty strength, but the wise ones knew that it wasn\u2019t simply because of his strength.Those who were in power also needed to follow virtues, and Roman knew the importance of socializing. Simply remembering the other person and creating an environment in which the other person can speak freely is also often extremely hard for leaders. However, at Barco\u2019s banquet, the situation was going differently than anyone would have thought.At first, everyone thought that Dmitry\u2019s Fool, as usual, would be bullied, but the nobles flocked to him as they saw his changed appearance and someone who knew of their achievements and praised them. Those who did not know Roman earlier now had a crush on him, and those who knew him earlier saw the fact that Roman had changed differently.Roman\u2019s reputation had piled up as Dmitry\u2019s Fool for decades. Nevertheless, today, he, who should have been ignored by others due to his breakup, melted the atmosphere with his few noble words.A certain noble said, \u201cIt seems that I misjudged you all this time, Roman. You were always drunk, so I thought it would be hard to have a conversation without alcohol, but I didn\u2019t expect it to be so much fun and hilarious! I hope that the Bolt family and Dmitry family will continue to maintain a good relationship in the future as well.\u201dThe Bolt family\u2014because Roman complimented his father once, he was in a good mood, and he smiled briskly with a blushing face. Ironically, the atmosphere was reversed and the complete opposite of what anyone had expected. Now, no one hated Roman. Moreover, the people who were recently bad-mouthing him were also now sneaking up to him and laughing and chatting together.The Dmitry family\u2014They were the absolute powerhouse in the North-East area. Nevertheless, people never treated Roman well, even though he was a Dmitry. The reason for that was that even though he was the eldest son, the chances of him inheriting the family were extremely slim, and the person himself was light and frivolous. That was why most people tried to avoid him.However, now, it was different. Roman, who had changed in appearance, knew how to deal with people, and in a friendly atmosphere, people finally realized Roman\u2019s position, although a bit late. Roman was Dmitry\u2019s eldest son. And, if he was actually a decent guy, there was nothing wrong with being friendly to him.Just then, passing through the crowd, Barco\u2019s servant approached Roman and said, \u201cRoman, the Barco family\u2019s young master has invited you to his private room.\u201dThe servant was talking about his young master. Of course, it had to be him\u2014Anthony Barco. After getting the invitation for the meeting he had been waiting for, Roman asked the aristocrats around him for forgiveness and said to Barco\u2019s servant, \u201cGuide me to his room.\u201dFrom this point onwards, it was his turn to find out the truth about Roman, which he had been recently curious about.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25 - What Happened at the Banquet (3)Anthony Barco\u2019s impression was more natural than Roman had expected. When he saw Roman looking completely different than before, his eyes widened, and he trembled.\u201cRoman! What the hell happened?!\u201dHe had heard that Roman had changed through his servants just a while ago. However, he could never have dreamed, even in his wildest dreams, that the change would be this dramatic. Thus, he looked at Roman with a genuinely surprised look.Roman said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand it myself. When I lavishly used a lot of money to care for my appearance, nothing changed, but now it suddenly changed. Anyway, nice to see you after a long time.\u201d Roman had said that casually, in a light and frivolous tone. It was mainly because of the advice of Hans, who had been observing his relationship with Anthony Barco.\u2018There is only Anthony Barco in this room.\u2019\u00a0Roman looked around and took notice of his surroundings. He noticed that Anthony Barco, who was enjoying the banquet with other noblewomen until recently, sent them all away when he heard that Roman had arrived. That was also why the tabletop was really messed up. Not only were there so many bottles of wine lying around, but Roman also saw things he presumed to be women\u2019s underwear. Due to that, he could easily guess what kind of person Anthony Barco was and how he played in his private room under the pretext of a banquet.Nevertheless, Roman kept that to himself. As he had often dealt with the cunning squirrels of the Demonic Cult, he knew that the correct method wasn\u2019t always the best method for dealing with such people.\u2018Anthony Barco sent all the nobles out of the private room when his servant said I was here. That meant that what Anthony Barco would talk about were secrets someone else should never hear. And, I need to act at least a bit drunk to hear them.\u2019He laughed. While hoping that Anthony Barco remembered Roman, he drank a glass as soon as he sat down on the chair.Tap.\u201cAhh, that\u2019s good.\u201d The alcohol energy that passed through his esophagus was suddenly eradicated. Contrary to his appearance, Roman was actually waiting for Anthony Barco to speak. He kept his calm, subdued eyes focused on him.Anthony Barco\u2014I don\u2019t have enough information about him.Through Hans, he understood how they usually acted with each other, but there was no way to find out the secret relationship between the two. That was why he kept his mouth shut. By waiting quietly, he was indirectly inducing his enemy to speak first.Alright.Anthony Barco eventually opened his mouth, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you after a long time. I guess I can take it positively. In fact, even back then, I really wondered what your intentions were. When you, who ignored our close friendship, told me you were going to marry Lawrence while we were in this private room\u2026\u00a0Haah. Honestly, no matter how secretive the banquet was, I didn\u2019t think you would be like that.\u201dThe banquet and the bed of the private room; in a situation where fragments of the truth popped out of his mouth, Anthony Barco continued humorously, \u201cSo, does you attending this banquet mean that you accepted my offer? No, since you already proved your will by breaking the marriage with Lawrence in the first place, I don\u2019t think I even need to ask for an answer. We\u2019ll keep it a secret, so let\u2019s discuss the marriage with Barco.\u201dThe marriage with Barco!\u00a0As soon as the keyword was mentioned, Roman\u2019s mind suddenly removed a lock from something.Clack.And with that, he accessed the original Roman Dmitry\u2019s memories and remembered the memories of the past.On that day, Roman was very nervous about attending Barco\u2019s banquet.\u201cCome on, Roman Dmitry. Don\u2019t be too nervous. Even though you betrayed Anthony Barco and accepted an arranged marriage with Lawrence, you can\u2019t just avoid them forever, can you? So, let\u2019s take this opportunity to put our relationship back as it was.\u201dAfter hesitating countless times about accepting Barco\u2019s invitation, he finally decided to meet Anthony in person to solve the problem.The enemy was Barco. Nevertheless, he wanted to solve the problem as much as possible by talking as he didn\u2019t want to wage war with them because of his petty desires.Naturally, his father had turned completely hostile to Barco from the time he accepted an arranged marriage with Lawrence. However, Roman Dmitry felt in his young heart that there were still chances of the problems being solved through discussion.And due to that, Roman went to the banquet. Unexpectedly, Anthony Barco welcomed Roman naturally, and as he relaxed, he drank a lot of alcohol without realizing it.And\u2026 that was the true problem. His consciousness had ended there. He couldn\u2019t remember anything after that. Later, when he woke up holding his head as if it would split due to the hangover, an utterly unfamiliar scene unfolded before his eyes\u2014On the bed in the private room, there were women whose faces he had never seen before.Roman was startled and ran outside, and Anthony Barco caught him. From that point onwards, Roman\u2019s life plummeted.Anthony Barco and Roman were usually promiscuous, so he thought Anthony would just let it pass, but he said with a ferocious face as if he would eat Roman at any given moment, \u201cRoman. I\u2019m not going to say anything about the fact that you, who are about to get married by arrangement, are promiscuous with women. But now, do you know who you\u2019re messing with? One of the women you were with was named Emily Barco. It wasn\u2019t enough that you betrayed me by agreeing to marry Lawrence, but now you even dare to touch Barco\u2019s woman?\u201dEmily Barco was Barco\u2019s collateral. And, from that day onward, Anthony Barco often threatened Roman by using that fact as an excuse.\u201cChoose right now. Should I expose this fact and end your marriage, or will you re-establish our relationship by marrying a direct descendant of our family? I still feel anger at what you did, but if you become Barco\u2019s man, I intend to contain my anger and forgive you.\u201dRoman, naturally, was in despair. He locked himself in his room as soon as he returned from the banquet and shouted at Hans to bring him a drink. It was a painful day for him. He was given two options, and both of them were the worst.If the marriage with Lawrence was broken for touching Barco\u2019s collateral, Dmitry\u2019s honor would fall to the ground. Even then, Roman Dmitry, who knew that he had a reputation as a fool, wouldn\u2019t be able to bear the wrath of his father, Baron Romero, for what had happened.Nevertheless, Roman could not choose the other option either. He truly loved Flora. He was completely obsessed with her since the first day he saw her, and he asked his father, even though he knew what their family would have to pay for that, for an arranged marriage with Flora.And\u2026 he could not go to Flora and ask for a breakup, as that would mean he would inflict the disgrace of being a \u201cdivorced woman\u201d on the woman he truly loved.He couldn\u2019t tolerate it anymore. He was in dire trouble. Anthony Barco was sending him letters from time to time to pressure him, and eventually, the moment of choice came\u2014that day, Roman committed suicide.He was definitely a weak human\u2014A human who had not accomplished anything properly by his own strength and had no confidence to solve his own problems. Therefore, he believed that if he died, all problems would be solved naturally.The death of the firstborn\u2014that would be a big disgrace to the Dmitry family. However, it would still be better than being unilaterally divorced because of her son\u2019s promiscuous behavior. He also thought that bereavement would still be a much better option for Flora Lawrence rather than being labeled a divorced woman.Yeah, it was pathetic.At the memories of the past, Roman showed a disappointing smile.\u2018It was an unfortunate reality.\u2019Roman\u2019s reason for suicide wasn\u2019t that great. Barco performed tricks that are common in politics, and Roman, a weak human being, gave up his life in fear of his father\u2019s wrath and his sincerity towards Flora.If only Roman had trusted his father and told him about it, Baron Romero would never have allowed his son to make the extreme choice of suicide. But\u2026 Roman didn\u2019t know\u2014how much his father loved him. So, he chose the burden of taking pills and committing suicide.Eventually, he came back to reality. When he looked ahead, he saw Anthony Barco happily waiting for Roman\u2019s answer.When he had first heard the news of Dmitry\u2019s breakup, Anthony Barco was on cloud nine.\u2018You idiot! You really suicided over something you couldn\u2019t even remember.\u2019Roman\u2019s memory was utterly different from the truth. It was true that he woke up on the same bed Emily and the other women were on in the private room. However, Roman hadn\u2019t even touched them in the slightest.Of course, Anthony thought they would do it for real. He thought the job would be easy for Roman, who usually led a promiscuous life, but Roman\u2019s reaction was completely out of his expectations.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m about to get married. Thus, I have no intention of hanging out with other women in the future.\u201dAnthony Barco\u2019s face was completely twisted when he heard him saying that Roman would not have any other romantic relationships with others now\u2014It was utterly out of his expectations. So, he planned. He made Roman get drunk and persuaded his powerless friend to believe he had slept with others.For Roman, it was something he had no choice but to be defeated at. He didn\u2019t know anyone who wasn\u2019t promiscuous in the first place, but since he was also promiscuous, he firmly believed it was his fault.And thus, he succeeded in threatening Roman. As planned, Roman chose to break up with Flora, and Anthony Barco knew what the finale would be now.\u2018Now the Lawrence family is completely in a corner. Still, I will fight to the end to protect my humble pride. What if Barco and Dmitry get married by arrangement in this situation? The game is totally over for them. No force can withstand Barco and Dmitry\u2019s combined power in the North-East area because they\u2019re the powerhouses of the North-East.\u2019It\u2019s perfect now.Anthony Barco, who swallowed a laugh inwardly, spit out an eloquent discourse towards his puppet, Roman, \u201cRoman, the combination of Barco and Dmitry is a huge topic that will send all of North-East into an uproar. No one will be able to surpass our stronghold, and you will also be able to claim unparalleled power in the North-East area. Also, as you know, my sister, whom you will marry, is a beauty whom everyone recognizes. For you, it\u2019s an offer you have no reason to turn down.\u201dIt was really sweet. It was a proposal that any man would be deceived by, and Anthony Barco thought that someone like Roman would, of course, accept it.Nevertheless, Roman\u2019s reaction was, once again, out of his expectations.\u201cI don\u2019t think I need to accept the arranged marriage for that reason alone.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dAnthony Barco\u2019s expression suddenly hardened. He thought he had heard something wrong for a moment, so he reminded him again, \u201cYou seem to have misunderstood, but this is not something you can reject. If you reject Barco\u2019s offer, I will have no choice but to disclose what happened on the bed of the private room to the entire world. And then, what will be the status of Dmitry? You broke up with Lawrence, but people probably think the reason for the breakup is because you love other girls. So, think carefully\u2014if you want to walk with your head lifted in the future.\u201dIt was an undeniable threat. Nevertheless, even while facing Anthony Barco\u2019s ferocious face, Roman smiled timidly without the slightest bit of agitation. He then crossed his legs and looked straight at Anthony Barco.A few days ago, Roman had investigated the Barco family\u2014What kind of place it was and how strong they were. And he also made a decision.\u201cI just said it. For that petty reason, Dmitry does not need to accept Barco\u2019s offer.\u201dThe North-East area\u2014The strongest powerhouse in that land was Dmitry, not Barco.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 - What Happened at the Banquet (4)Anthony Barco was speechless. He was not at all concerned about something like this when he was told that Roman would be attending the banquet. It was, of course, natural. Back then, Roman had broken up. It meant that his threat worked, and he was holding the sword\u2014No, he thought so, to be precise.\u201cRoman, from now on, it will be better if you think carefully about each word before saying anything. You didn\u2019t just have a promiscuous time with other women ahead of your arranged marriage; you touched Barco\u2019s woman. That means you have to join the Barco family. I allowed you to marry not just anyone but a direct descendant rather than using them as collateral; that was my last consideration because of my relationship with you. But just now, did you dare say \u2018for that petty reason\u2019 in front of me?\u201dHis voice obviously swelled with anger. As if his anger could never naturally subside, he drank wine from a bottle and spoke savagely, \u201cHey. I am different from you. You are Dmitry\u2019s disgrace who was pushed out of the succession, but I am the heir who will inherit everything from Barco. Taking Lawrence\u2019s flower that I wanted wasn\u2019t enough for you? Do you think you\u2019ll be fine after touching Barco\u2019s woman? You are making an irreversible mistake now.\u201dHis attitude had changed. His close friend vanished, and Anthony Barco, the successor of Barco, pushed the sword he was holding under Roman\u2019s chin. He thought that as he had said this much, if he was the Roman he remembered, he would bow down with his eyes closed and ask for mercy.However, Roman smiled rather coldly and said, \u201cDo whatever you feel like.\u201dThe opponent\u2019s weapon was not a real \u2018sword.\u2019 Roman did not waver at his words, which was something that Anthony couldn\u2019t have imagined even in his wildest dreams.\u201cI\u2019m known as Dmitry\u2019s Fool anyway. As I am already treated like garbage, even if you add the rumors of touching several women even though I accepted the arranged marriage, it won\u2019t change anything. Alas, as you said, Dmitry\u2019s honor will be tarnished. But, it was originally like that, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cThis bastard\u2026!\u201d\u201cAnthony, you should act in moderation.\u201dThe Barco family had a misunderstanding\u2014Although they were a powerhouse in the North-East region, their power didn\u2019t come from their own authority; it was solely due to their connections with the central government.Nevertheless, power from connections could never allow them to succeed Dmitry in terms of influence in the North-East region of Cairo.Roman continued, \u201cYou should also know that the reason I chose to break up is not because of your threats. I myself decided that the marriage with Lawrence was not necessary, so I made the decision to break up despite the criticism from those around me. This enabled you to achieve what you wanted as well. Now that Dmitry has turned their back on Lawrence, Barco\u2019s plans for the future will surely be much easier. But now, as you, Barco\u2019s eldest son, show your teeth to me, I wonder\u2014what should I do? Wouldn\u2019t it be possible for me to help Lawrence and interfere with Barco, even if that\u2019s just for settling my personal resentment?\u201dAt that moment, Anthony Barco felt his heart simmer down as if it had been plunged into an ice bath.After eliminating Anthony\u2019s threat, Roman had thrust a knife into his enemy\u2019s neck instead.\u2019\u2026Was Roman originally someone like this?\u2019No, he wasn\u2019t. Roman was originally a weak person. Despite being the eldest son of Dmitry, he had good reason for being ignored by others.However, just then, a rumor he had recently been hearing came to his mind.- Roman Dmitry subjugated the Blood Fang by himself. Dmitry\u2019s Fool was, in fact, a sleeping dragon with hidden power.\u201cThat rumor\u2014I thought it was bullshit!Knowing what kind of guy Roman was, Anthony didn\u2019t think he had the power to subdue Blood Fang by himself.However, now, it was different.The way Roman looked at him and the pressure he exuded made Anthony\u2019s mouth dry. It eventually forced him to correct his assessment of Roman.\u2018I\u2019m sure of it. Roman has changed.\u2019The person known as Dmitry\u2019s Fool was no longer there.The silence went on for quite some time.And at the look of Anthony Barco in trouble, Roman\u2019s eyes became cold.\u2018You don\u2019t have a choice anyway. If you had been in a position to choose from in the first place, the cumbersome process of feeding me alcohol and making traps would not have been necessary.\u2019The current situation was simple\u2014Despite Dmitry overtly denying Barco the goal he had hoped for, Barco never officially raised his voice of protest. Why? It was because Dmitry\u2019s power was absolute. Anthony couldn\u2019t do anything while knowing what would happen if he was hostile to Dmitry. Roman had simply made him face reality. And Anthony Barco had no choice but to accept the reality, even though his self-esteem was hurt and his face blushed.\u201c\u2026Okay. If I forget this matter, you won\u2019t meddle with Barco and Lawrence\u2019s matters in the future, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s end this here.\u201dAnthony Barco saw a compromise and accepted that. However, even while seeing Anthony Barco bowing his head, Roman hid his true intentions.\u2018If I am to live as Roman Dmitry and have a peaceful future, I must destroy the Barcos, who threatened me.\u2019It was obvious now that the Barcos were enemies who would stand against Roman. And Roman was gracious to his people, but he showed no mercy to his enemies who showed him hostility. The situation wasn\u2019t much different right now. The reason he offered Anthony Barco temporary peace was not because he wanted peace for himself but because he knew there was no reason for Dmitry to bleed.\u2018There is no need for Dmitry to be on the stage and oppose Barco. When Barco and Lawrence go to war, clawing at each other\u2019s throats in a desperate bid for survival, I will strike Barco and become the final nail in their coffin.\u2019Until reaching the peak of the Demonic Cult, Baek Joong-hyuk had many experiences of being threatened by women and also defeated his enemies with the same strategy.Showing an angry face and asking to fight means you\u2019re a fool who is ready to cut off your own head. Sometimes, you need to wear a mask; Sometimes, you need to do what they don\u2019t expect you to.Ironically, because Roman recognized the Barcos as an enemy, he offered Anthony Barco a brief moment of peace.\u2018I\u2019m thirsty.\u2019\u00a0Roman grabbed the glass. Then, while looking at Anthony Barco, who could not lift his face due to his shattered pride, he drank.Gulp.His throat was parched.After drinking water, Roman left the private room. Now that he had learned the veiled truth, he had no reason to stay at the banquet anymore.\u2018I\u2019m going to be a lot busier in the future.\u2019\u00a0Indeed, there was a lot of work for him to do. After half a year, he had to perform his national defense duties, but before that, he was thinking of resolving his grudge against the Barcos by himself. He had no intention of using the power of the Dmitry family. In the first place, this problem had originated because of Roman, and it was necessary for him to rely on his own abilities to see how much he would be capable of in the future as well.How timely.\u00a0Roman had recently gotten impressive authority from his father.\u00a0\u2018My father gave me the authority to recruit my troops by myself. I have to use that to create my own army.\u2019Roman had started a new life. He didn\u2019t yet have a clear goal of what to do, but there was one thing that Roman could be sure of\u2014that he should rule. That was the life the Heavenly Demon needed to live. As he couldn\u2019t live a normal life, Roman knew that from now on, he had to prepare and complete his goals one by one.The war between Lawrence and Barco would be an excellent stage to gain experience, and furthermore, Roman would also use the duty of national defense as a stepping stone for growth.On his way out, many nobles spoke to him. Roman had quickly become the main character of the banquet, and when he said he was leaving, certain nobles were truly sad about it.However, just then, as he was greeting others and leaving the banquet, Roman suddenly heard a loud noise.\u2018Kevin?\u2019The cause of the noise\u2014At the center of it was Kevin, surrounded by a group of knights.He was now an escort. He was someone who needed to protect his liege. Kevin, who followed Roman to the banquet, could hardly hide his excitement.\u2018I became the escort of a nobleman.\u2019And it isn\u2019t for any ordinary nobleman either. I became the escort of Roman Dmitry.With the fact that he had become an escort for someone he admired, Kevin wanted to do his job better than ever before. Naturally, he got greedy and asked Hans for an armor. Then, he came out wearing a nice armor that fit him, and put on a helmet that didn\u2019t fit his head and showed a serious expression.Roman Dmitry\u2019s escort, Kevin\u2014following Chris\u2019 advice to be careful with his words and actions, he tried his best to make him look like the right person for the role. However, the perspective of others was different. No matter how hard Kevin tried, he couldn\u2019t help but look like a mid-teenage boy.\u201cWho is he?\u201d\u201cI heard he\u2019s Roman Dmitry\u2019s escort.\u201d\u201cPfft, stop joking. I\u2019ve heard rumors that Roman Dmitry is the eldest son who is abandoned by Dmitry, but why is his escort a young kid who can\u2019t even wield a sword?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s Dmitry\u2019s level, I guess?\u201dIn front of the banquet\u2019s door, in a situation where each noble\u2019s escorts guarded their positions, the knights engraved with Barco\u2019s pattern were speaking about Kevin. Nevertheless, Kevin tried to stay calm and listen. However, at the sight of them not lowering their voices at all, Kevin blushed in anger.\u201cHold it in.\u201d It was Chris who said that. Of course, he was also listening to the knights, but he knew it was not good to argue with the knights of Barco.\u201cThey are knights of the Barco family. If we react hastily in a situation where we don\u2019t know what kind of relationship the young master has with the Barco family, then he may get in trouble because of us. I already told you before we left for the banquet\u2014we are Dmitry\u2019s face, and our lord\u2019s reputation depends on our words and actions. So, no matter what they say, keep your composure and show your dignity as an escort.\u201d\u201c\u2026I understand.\u201d He nodded his head. He knew he would be disrespected. However, that was nothing special for him. Instead, it was normal for Kevin, who lived in a slum, so he tried to ignore the gossip of the knights. However, as time went on, it got progressively worse. They approached Kevin and looked at him.\u201cWow. How could someone seriously think of bringing a kid like this as an escort?\u201d\u201cLook at this. The helmet doesn\u2019t even fit his head. What an escort. He seems to have picked up a matching piece of armor from the smithy, but still, he\u2019s deficient. I guess that\u2019s why your lord is called Dmitry\u2019s Fool.\u201dKevin raised his eyes. He had tolerated them swearing at him; however, the moment they mentioned Dmitry\u2019s Fool and disrespected his lord, he retorted, \u201cWatch your mouth.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYoung Master Roman isn\u2019t someone who is going to listen to that. So, be careful now.\u201d\u201cThis bastard!\u201dThe knights\u2019 expressions suddenly became harsh.Barco and Dmitry\u2014The relationship between the two families was not good due to Lawrence. Moreover, since Anthony Barco usually ignored Roman Dmitry, his knights did not feel the need to treat the people of the Dmitry family well. Their background was their strength. Even so, a knight who was annoyed by the Dmitry family swung his large hand toward Kevin\u2019s face.Slap!\u201cSay that again, you bastard.\u201dKevin\u2019s head turned. Seeing blood gushing from Kevin\u2019s face, Chris put his hand on his sword. However, he couldn\u2019t unsheathe it. Of course, it was right to defend Kevin, but he was worried that his liege would be the one who would need to take responsibility for their actions. And Kevin understood that. In the ghetto, he was taught to pay back for what he suffered, but the moment his eyes met Chris, he suppressed his anger.\u2018I am the young master\u2019s sword.\u2019Roman\u2019s escort and his sword\u2014Having decided to become a useful person to Roman, Kevin turned his gaze away from the knights with a stiff face. It was him expressing he didn\u2019t want to deal with them anymore.Seeing that, the knights of Barco spoke angrily, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s see how long you can keep your pride.\u201dOnce again, the knight raised his arm. And, the moment he was about to slap Kevin\u2019s cheek,Slap!A satisfying sound rang out.Surprisingly, it wasn\u2019t Kevin who was slapped. Roman, who had suddenly appeared at the scene, had slapped the hell out of Barco\u2019s knight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27 - What Happened at the Banquet (5)Barco\u2019s knight, Benson, could not accept reality even after feeling the tingling shock on his cheek.\u00a0\u2019\u2026Did I just get slapped in the face?\u2019\u00a0His cheek was hurting.As an escort of the Barco family, who had a huge reputation in the surrounding area, he could not accept the act of being hit in the face rather than the pain. He confirmed the other person\u2019s face\u2014Roman Dmitry. He understood why Roman Dmitry hit him, but due to his reputation as a fool, Benson could not contain his wrath.\u201cHow dare this bastard?\u2014Keuk!\u201dSlap!Once again, his head spun. Embarrassed, Benson grabbed his cheek and tried to stop Roman, but Roman\u2019s hand slapped his cheek again.Slap!Slap! Slap!Once, twice, and even thrice\u2014Each time Roman attacked him, Benson couldn\u2019t even counter his slaps. Nevertheless, Roman did not stop hitting Benson\u2019s face even when his face had not returned to its original position, and Benson, who was confident and angry at Roman in the beginning, withdrew. His head was spinning as if he had rolled down from a cliff. Consecutively, the pain outweighed his poor self-esteem, and while staggering, Benson waved his arms and begged earnestly.\u201cP-please\u2026!\u201dHis cheek was hurting. It was hurting so much as if someone had poured molten lava over it. Although he had lived a life accustomed to suffering, Roman\u2019s touch had the power to make people powerless. At that moment, he understood\u2014he had made a huge mistake.Regardless, Roman neither gave him a chance to apologize nor did he allow him to make any excuses. Even though aristocrats from the banquet began to gather while seeing the commotion outside, he slapped Benson\u2019s face countless times with a cold expression.Benson\u2019s blood splashed on the floor, and even his teeth came out. He was staggering even while he was on his knees, and before he knew it, he was holding onto Roman\u2019s legs.Clearly, the situation had gotten dire. Belatedly, Kevin and Chris tried to stop him.\u201cYoung master!\u201d\u201cThis is enough punishment, my liege! The opponent is Barco\u2019s knight. Even considering your relationship with them, it isn\u2019t good to go this far!\u201dThey were correct. However, even though they uttered advice, Roman glanced at them with a blood-splattered face and said, \u201cI will be the one who will decide the standard of sufficient punishment. Chris, Kevin, what kind of punishment do you think is appropriate for a knight who bad-mouths me, Dmitry\u2019s eldest son? Even if this guy dies by my hands today, it\u2019s only the price he needs to pay for the words he uttered. Even with that, I won\u2019t be going beyond any boundaries.\u201dRoman\u2014Right now, he wasn\u2019t a benevolent lord. Benson had crossed the line set by Roman, resulting in a little bit of the cruelty of the Heavenly Demon being revealed to others.Good sociability and kindness towards his subordinates\u2014They were the necessary elements to maintain power. However, in the end, there are certain things that must also be kept in order to rule well and maintain one\u2019s throne. One of them was a punishment to set an example to others.There was a clear standard of punishment. In front of everyone, Roman was showing how he would deal with those who crossed the line.And once again, he pulled his hand back to slap Benson. However, at the moment he grabbed his head and was about to slap him,\u201cWhat the hell is this?!\u201dAnthony Barco appeared.He couldn\u2019t believe it. Roman Dmitry dared to punish the Barco family\u2019s knights in front of everyone even though it was Barco\u2019s banquet. Certainly, it was beyond his authority. And, with a face so blisteringly red as if it would explode at any given moment, Anthony Barco shouted, \u201cRoman! Even though you are the eldest son of the Dmitry family, it is absolutely unacceptable to meddle with the Barco family\u2019s knights. So, stop that right now and apologize directly for your rude behavior!\u201dThe recent conversation in the private room-He had totally forgotten about it. Back then, he bowed his head for peace and mutual interest, but being openly ignored in front of everyone was something he could not tolerate.Alternately looking at Anthony and Roman, a look of interest appeared on the faces of the nobles who were holding their breath. Now, Anthony Barco put even more strength into his voice. He had thought Roman had obviously crossed the line. Thus, he truly deserved his anger.However,\u201cWhy should I apologize?\u201dRoman was not agitated even a little bit. Still holding Benson\u2019s head, he said coldly while looking at Anthony Barco, \u201cWhen I left the banquet, I heard a Barco knight bad-mouthing me. Moreover, as he continued bad-mouthing me, he even made demeaning remarks to the Dmitry family. And in front of me, he dared to touch the face of someone from Dmitry. Anthony Barco, do you still think what I did was wrong?\u201d\u201c\u2026Even so, this has crossed the line!\u201d\u201cLine, huh.\u201dPfft.Anthony, of course, also knew that this was Benson\u2019s responsibility. Still, the reason he could not back down was not because he wanted to protect Benson but because of the gazes of the people around him. He was desperately asking Roman to back down just once. Nevertheless, despite Anthony Barco\u2019s gaze asking to save face, Roman did not follow his intentions in the slightest.\u201cDid you already forget what I said back in the private room? I don\u2019t know how the relationship between the two of us, and furthermore, the relationship between our families, will change due to my personal resentment. From now on, you should be clear about your attitude towards me, Anthony. Will we continue to maintain our current relationship, or will we devour each other every time we meet? My patience is not as great as you think. So, decide your attitude right now.\u201dPeople who were gathered there were perplexed. Initially, they had thought that it was a simple dispute, but they didn\u2019t know that it would turn into a problem that would bring up the relationship between their families.Moreover, the current situation was also Roman\u2019s intention. During his lifetime, the original Roman Dmitry had lived like an idiot\u2014An idiot who was not treated properly outside, even though the Dmitry family was the powerhouse of the North-East region of Cairo. It cannot be said that it was the fault of others. Truthfully, it was Roman Dmitry\u2019s fault for not taking advantage of his own strengths, and the current Roman wanted to rectify that fact as he began his new life.\u2018My name is Roman Dmitry.\u2019The eldest son of the Dmitry family, Roman Dmitry.Even though he was up against Barco, he showed everyone that he was a man who could utter such rude remarks to them. Benson\u2014He was just an excuse. From the moment Roman entered Barco\u2019s banquet, he was looking for an opportunity to prove his worth even after he had won the favor of the surrounding nobles through conversation. That was his intention when he had accepted to go to the banquet.And, in a situation that arose from his opponent\u2019s mistakes, Roman chuckled and attacked Benson like a predator who had finally cornered his prey. His bloody teeth were exposed to Benson. Seeing Roman\u2019s predator-like attitude, Anthony Barco could not hide his embarrassment.\u2018Damn it.\u2019Roman\u2019s enmity and the gazes around him; in his heart, he wanted to fight. However, he knew that if he did, his mistake could not be undone through any means. It was not an exaggeration to say that Roman had changed due to their conversation in the private room, and their family relations could be disrupted due to Roman\u2019s personal resentment.What if that happens? One-sidedly, it is definitely Barco\u2019s loss.With a bit of patience and perseverance, he could get his hands on Lawrence\u2019s fertile lands and Flora Lawrence. Thus, he didn\u2019t think it was necessary to upset Dmitry and ruin his grand plans. Little by little, Anthony Barco fell into self-rationalization. Nevertheless, he struggled to ignore the gazes around him, thinking that he had no choice but to choose one option.Eventually, he said, \u201c\u2026Thinking about it, you are correct. If Dmitry\u2019s knight had insulted me in front of others and touched a member of the Barco family, I would have punished him similarly. This is absolutely our fault.\u201dHe took a step back. After bending his pride, he struggled to add meaningless excuses, saying he would have punished him similarly if he had been in the same situation. And that was the end of it. Roman smiled and pulled Benson\u2019s head forward, \u201cYou think so?\u201dAnd when Benson\u2019s eyes, tinged with fear, turned to him, Roman forced his head to the floor and said, \u201cShow some respect.\u201dAt those words, Benson squeezed his eyes shut. In the end, he was carried away on a stretcher. He was beaten so severely that his face had become bloody, and fragments of his teeth and blood flowed where he initially was.With that, Roman\u2019s aim of coming to the banquet had been achieved. He wiped the blood off his hands with his handkerchief and left the party with Chris and Kevin.On the way back to Dmitry, Kevin, who was silently following Roman, said with a face as if he had committed treason, \u201c\u2026Sorry. Because of me, my liege had to suffer embarrassment.\u201d He truly felt miserable. If only he had been a knight like Chris, Barco\u2019s knights would not have dared to argue with him, and Roman would not have been involved in useless things.Chris also added, \u201cI\u2019m sorry as well. Even while seeing Kevin being beaten, and them insulting Dmitry, I did not respond. If I am to be punished for this, I will accept that punishment and never let this happen again in the future.\u201dChris had power. Still, he kept calm for Roman. If he had known that Roman would be angry enough to be hostile to Barco, he would have drawn his sword and fought from the beginning.Tap.Roman stopped walking. Then, he turned to his men and spoke calmly, \u201cYou guys made the best choice for me. It must have been difficult to be patient but thank you for being calm.\u201dToday, neither of them was responsible. From anyone\u2019s perspective, the Barco family had power, and Roman Dmitry had no power or authority to treat them badly. If Roman was unprepared and had an argument with the Barco family, he might have faced trouble in front of everyone. Chris and Kevin knew that. They acknowledged Roman\u2019s strength, but his position as Dmitry\u2019s successor and authority was unstable, so his self-esteem would have suffered injuries if they had taken any different actions. However, that didn\u2019t mean their response was perfect either.\u201cBeing mistreated, of course, leads to anger. Your choice did avoid the worst, but it wasn\u2019t the choice I wanted you to make. In the future, remember how to behave when someone spits in your face. If you do that, nothing like today will ever happen again. At least in the region of North-East in the kingdom of Cairo, there will be no one who will dare to disrespect the Dmitry family.\u201dWhile living at the bottom of the cave in his original life, Baek Joong-hyuk was powerless. So, he used his tools and smashed everyone\u2019s boss\u2019s head with a stone, making him the new king of the 12 children of the Heavenly Demon.However, the situation right now was different from back then.You can do anything when you don\u2019t have power, but when you take on power, you risk the life of your comrades as well. And for that, I knew what actions to take at what time.When it was not the right time, he smiled, and when the time was right, even if others judged him to be reckless, he cut off his opponent\u2019s head without hesitation. In that process, he crossed numerous life-or-death situations.Chris and Kevin\u2019s judgment was in their best interests, but if they had known \u201cwhat actions to take at what time,\u201d they wouldn\u2019t have stood still today.Just like the situation with the Barco family and even the Blood Fang, if Dmitry\u2019s strength was accurately grasped, even if they crossed the line, there would be no problem.And,\u201cEven if it is something you have to endure, keep your opponent\u2019s face clearly in your eyes. There is a difference between simply being patient and bowing helplessly. You must not lose the intent of crushing your opponent at the right time in your eyes. I\u2019m not the type of person who can tolerate someone being higher than me. You will also have to get used to it\u2014if you want to follow me, you need to place everyone else in this world under your feet.\u201dAt that moment, Chris and Kevin thought\u2014Roman Dmitry is a man who will lead a reigning life. And in order to become a person suitable for him, they must strive not to remain in the realm of everyone else\u2019s common sense and thoughts.Roman walked ahead; Chris and Kevin followed him. Looking at Roman\u2019s reliable back, the two men\u2019s footsteps felt were more firm, and they felt a stronger trust in him than they had ever felt.The Heavenly Demon\u2014The power that dominated all of Murim was now, little by little, taking shape here in the kingdom of Cairo.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28 - Recruitment (1)On the next day, Roman received the material he had requested from Hans.\u201cThis is information about the Barco family, young master. According to the intelligence guild, their recent behavior seems unusual.\u201dA few days ago, Roman had researched the Barco family. He had a rough idea of their level but was determined that detailed information was required for future plans. So, he sent a commission to the Black Moon, an information guild active in the North-East region of Cairo.- I want you to collect information about what the Barcos have been up to lately and how powerful they are.After Hans left, Roman confirmed the information.Flip.[The Barco family was established in the North-East region over a hundred years ago. However, they became a true powerhouse when the people of the Barco family entered the central government. In fact, their military power is not as strong as one might think, but the influence of the central government is absolute in the kingdom of Cairo.]The Cairo Kingdom\u2014Among the two empires and six kingdoms that make up the Salamander Continent, it was a small country surrounded by other countries. Except for the mountains in the North-East, as the Cairo Kingdom bordered other countries, it suffered from foreign invasions from a long time ago. As a result, the central government was naturally empowered. Basically, local nobles had the authority to train private soldiers. Still, since there were menacing enemies outside the country, they had no choice but to work together with the central government to survive.In particular, the power of conscription was absolute. If the conscription was not followed, one would be regarded as outside the boundaries of the Cairo Kingdom. Then, the central government would dispatch troops to subdue the rebellion and retake the territory inside the kingdom of Cairo. Moreover, the surrounding lords who helped in the process received a certain amount of land as a reward, and the rest introduced a new noble who listened to the central government. As a result, the central government\u2019s authority was absolute. And this meant the power of the capital aristocrats had to be strong. The Barco family had such a central government backing them; thus, the system granted them intangible power.[The Barco family recently took advantage of their connection with the central government to get a large loan through the Golden Bank. It would be impossible for most other nobles to get that large of a loan, but it is assumed that the Barco family made this transaction with a credit guarantee without any particular collateral. And the money they secured was used to recruit the Berge mercenaries. The Berge mercenary group has about 100 A-class mercenaries, and their main job is to intervene in the strife between territories and receive commissions.]The information was extremely detailed. It explained how Barco secured the money and what they intended and did with it.[Also, considering their conscription of their citizens, it\u2019s estimated that they will attack in 2 weeks.]Clearly, Barco had finished their preparations. After Dmitry revealed that the marriage with Lawrence had been broken, they moved in fast, and now, Lawrence would have to block Barco\u2019s attack alone with any mistake. This was a situation in which war was imminent. According to the rumors, Viscount Lawrence was meeting with the surrounding nobles and trying to get some kind of support.\u2018The Barco family gained strength by utilizing their connections with the central government. The difference in their power is obvious, and leaving Dmitry aside, there is no family who will dare to risk helping Lawrence and going against Barco. Even if I wait and see, it will be virtually impossible for Lawrence to hold on for more than a month.\u2019Now, the result was obvious. Therefore, Roman now thought of a different premise.\u00a0\u2018What if Barco and Dmitry get together?\u2019\u00a0He scrutinized his enemy; he calculated the variables and thought of the worst-case scenario, but his conclusions about the contingency never changed.\u201cEven if we fight hundred times, Dmitry will hold victory every single time.\u201d\u2014An overwhelming difference\u2014That was Roman\u2019s conclusion.There was something people often misunderstood\u2014They thought wealth and power were separate things, but for a family like Dmitry, who had enormous wealth, it was different. Normal aristocrats usually kept around 200 enlisted soldiers in their private army. Since the cost of maintaining more soldiers than that was too high, they used appropriate troops to rule and maintain control over the territory, and in special situations such as war, they recruited ordinary people to increase their troops. And the Barco family wasn\u2019t much different. However, the employment of the Berge mercenaries, who specialized in battle, was a problem that could have a significant impact on the war.On the contrary, the Dmitry family was different. They always maintained more than 300 enlisted men and fostered an armed group much more capable than ordinary soldiers\u2014the Dmitry Knights. Even if one doesn\u2019t consider that, most of the soldiers conscripted by other nobles were poorly armed, and Dmitry, befitting the reputation of a blacksmithing family, fully equipped their conscripts. They did not simply throw a bamboo spear in their hands and push the conscripts into the battlefield. At the very least, they provided them with leather armor and a hard iron spear as supplies to protect themselves. Thus, even if the conscripts were ordinary citizens, Dmitry\u2019s fighting power had to be slightly higher than other nobles. And finally, Dmitry started with good connections in the first place\u2014They basically needed the means to protect themselves in order to do business across the continent, so they had a close relationship with Benjamin\u2019s mercenaries for decades. In the beginning, Benjamin\u2019s mercenary corps was not large, but with the support of Dmitry, they eventually became a group that had more than 500 mercenaries.In other words, if anyone wanted to have a dispute with Dmitry, they needed to consider the involvement of Benjamin\u2019s mercenaries in the dispute as well. Barco and Dmitry\u2014The difference between the two was enormous. The intangible power of the central government alone could not overcome Dmitry in the North-East region, at the very least.\u2018What Dmitry lacks is not wealth and power. The thing is that Romero Dmitry\u2019s origins were that of a commoner. Due to the short history of the family and its common origin, the nobles of Cairo do not recognize the Dmitry family as nobility. Nevertheless, regardless of their perception, it is an undeniable truth that Dmitry is the absolute powerhouse in the North-East region of Cairo.\u2019Dmitry had power. If Roman borrowed the power of his family, punishing the Barcos\u2014who caused the death of the original Roman Dmitry\u2014was as simple as breathing. However, Roman had no intention of doing that. Now at the crossroads of making a choice, he knew what he had to do to make a leap in this world.\u2018Even if one looks at the situation with the knights of the Barco family, the nobles in the North-East region don\u2019t think of Roman Dmitry as such a big threat, regardless of his background. While the original Roman lived a life worthy of being treated like that, I, Baek Joong-hyuk, am different. Anthony Barco dared to mess with me. Therefore, he will pay a reasonable price, and borrowing the power of my family is not the right way to prove who I am.\u2019In the cave, in front of all his brothers, Baek Joong-hyuk had smashed the boss\u2019s head by himself. At that moment, his reputation changed drastically. He, who was only seen as the weakest, had made a necessary and huge leap forward.Roman was lost in thought.How will I be able to achieve maximum results with minimum effort? Well, what is certain is that to build something of my own, I need people to support me.Ding.\u201cHans.\u201dRoman called for Hans. Before these two weeks passed, he had much work to do.Around the time the news about the imminent war between Lawrence and Barco was spreading in the North-East region, a man arrived in Dmitry.\u201cDmitry remains the same as ever.\u201dThat man\u2019s name was Lucas; he was a B-class mercenary. As a mercenary, he had experienced everything and spent a lot of time in the recent battle at the border. There were even moments when he seriously thought he would die. Fortunately, he managed to survive by stepping on the corpses of his comrades, and in need of rest, he left the battlefield without even renewing his mercenary contract.And now, Lucas had come to Dmitry for reorganization. Although he wasn\u2019t born in Dmitry, Dmitry\u2019s forge was extremely famous among mercenaries for its high quality.\u201cFuck, I won\u2019t even go anywhere near the border next time. My ten-year mercenary life almost ended that day because the bastards with brains for decoration ran wild without knowing anything.\u00a0Sigh, damned dog-like bastards.\u201dA sigh came out of his mouth. Looking down, he noticed how bad the chained armor had gotten.The one I bought for a large amount of money got torn in several places and exposed my wounds, and it seemed that even my bare skin would be completely cut if the armor was hit a little more.Due to that, he spat out swear words bitterly during the battle. He almost lost his one and only precious life due to purchasing the armament from a new place. And Dmitry\u2019s iron and armaments were considered one of the best. So he headed straight to Dmitry, and as soon as he arrived, he went to the blacksmith\u2019s shop and put in a request for the production of a new weapon.\u2018Let\u2019s stay in Dmitry for a while and do some recuperation.\u2019The battlefield was tedious. Whenever he thought of the moment he was covered in blood from head to toe, he could already feel his teeth trembling. Lucas took a step forward. He was planning to go to a restaurant and have a meal, but in the city square, he noticed many people were gathered and gossiping about something.Murmur murmur.\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019He was curious. Living as a mercenary for decades, it was natural for him to live out of curiosity and almost die of curiosity\u2014That was something in his DNA, and he cut through the crowd and burrowed inside as naturally as if he were being dragged by a magnet. There was a bulletin board in front of him. It was mainly used by the lord of the estate to give orders or to convey information to the general public, but one article on the bulletin board caught people\u2019s attention.[Recruitment of private soldiers]-Eligibility requirements: A healthy body and a desire to be strong.-Number of spots: 30-Salary: 8 silvers per month.-Special Note: The recruited soldiers will belong solely to Roman Dmitry, not the Dmitry family. Keeping this in mind, I hope only those willing to give their lives for Roman Dmitry will apply.It was a recruitment notice\u2014and honestly, the conditions were not bad. The average cost for a family of four to live well per month was around 5 silvers, but giving 8 silvers was extremely good, even considering the risk allowance. Besides, there was nothing special about the requirements and qualifications needed to apply. Of course, the conditions were harsh enough for ordinary people, but it was different for Lucas, a B-class mercenary. He showed a serious expression.\u2018This recruitment has nothing to do with me.\u2019Being a B-class mercenary, he wasn\u2019t in a position where he needed to enter the ranks as a private soldier. If he was going to swear allegiance to the nobleman, he would have to be paid at least 50 silvers every month, so it was a matter he didn\u2019t even need to consider.However, just then,\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking of applying, forget it. There must be hundreds of applicants already.\u201dThe old man next to him said something unexpected. To Lucas, it seemed the old man had misunderstood that Lucas was interested in the recruitment notice. Normally, he would have ignored it, but Lucas couldn\u2019t just listen to the old man\u2019s seemingly foolish words.\u2018Hundreds of people want to become Roman Dmitry\u2019s private soldier? Is he even worth it?\u2019Roman Dmitry was, of course, famous in the area. Lucas also visited Dmitry often, so he knew just how pathetic Roman Dmitry was.Was it two years ago? That was when I last visited Dmitry, and watching Roman Dmitry lose money at the gambling house and do foolish things, I thought that the baron known as Romero Dmitry had failed in raising his children properly.However, today, hundreds of people were supporting him. Of course, no matter how important money was, the future under Roman Dmitry was clear as crystal.Was that why?\u2014Lucas asked curiously, \u201cIs this seriously worth it? Even if he gives me 8 silvers every month, isn\u2019t he still Roman Dmitry, who is known as Dmitry\u2019s Fool? You never know what hardships you will face when you become his private soldier.\u201dHearing those words, the old man\u2019s eyes widened. He looked at Lucas with a puzzled expression on his face.\u201cI\u2019m a foreigner, so I don\u2019t know much about this situation myself. However, Roman Dmitry isn\u2019t the person we earlier used to know. He not only subjugated the Blood Fang by himself, he cares for his people from the bottom of his heart!\u201dRecently, a rumor had spread among Dmitry\u2014and the enthusiasm for this private soldier\u2019s recruitment announcement had originated from that rumor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 - Recruitment (2)The day Kevin was called by Roman, his family got rid of the threat of the Blood Fang in their lives and cleaned up their messy house.\u201cDamn those guys. They have completely messed up our house.\u201d\u201cWell, at least we made it back home. If it hadn\u2019t been for Young Master Roman\u2019s actions, I don\u2019t know what we would be going through now.\u201dHis wife, Michelle, optimistically answered the words of her husband\u2014Clark. Back then, the Clark family had a hellish day. They were robbed of their savings, and the nasty men who visited them daily were screaming and breaking stuff all around the house. Clark always had a bruised face, and Michelle could only sit down on the ground and weep. Nevertheless, he still said he would watch over his daughter even while suffering from such circumstances, so she always clenched her teeth and endured the pain.Due to a single transaction, a farmer\u2019s dream of cultivating his own land had gone to hell because he met a vicious criminal group.\u201c\u2026But is it true that Young Master Roman subjugated the Blood Fang by himself? The young master I know is not a person who can do that. Kevin made a lot of fuss and told me that Young Master Roman was a great man, but I can\u2019t believe it because of what I\u2019ve seen and heard about him.\u201dThe last few days had been unbelievable for Clark. It wasn\u2019t enough that Roman Dmitry rescued Kevin; he even went to Lawrence and subjugated the Blood Fang. The hell they had been experiencing for such a long time was finally over. And Roman\u2019s servant, Hans, also came to take care of the Clark family, which allowed them to return home safely.Roman was undoubtedly their benefactor. Nevertheless, they were doubtful and anxious because their only son had left the house to follow Roman.Dmitry\u2019s Fool\u2014Knowing how such a reputation had been built, they were worried about whether it was worth it for their son to dedicate his to him.Michelle said, \u201cThe truth is not important to us.\u201d She squatted down on the floor and cleared the messy and shattered bowl pieces. Those shattered pieces clearly represented the hard times they had been through until now.\u201cAs rumors say, the Dmitry family may have manipulated the situation to control Young Master Roman\u2019s reputation. However, the important thing is that we got help from him. If Young Master Roman hadn\u2019t helped us, we don\u2019t even know what the Blood Fang would be doing right now. So the truth doesn\u2019t matter. We have been greatly blessed by Young Master Roman, and no matter what the world may say about him, we must live with gratitude for Young Master Roman for the rest of our lives.\u201dShe trusted Roman\u2014For the single fact that he blessed their family with help, Michelle was wary of anyone bad-mouthing Roman. Also, he was the one whom her son would be following in the future. Indeed, her trust was well-founded. Naturally, Michelle herself could also do anything for Roman.Just then,Knock knock.\u201cAre you there?\u201dA man\u2019s voice was heard from outside the house.For a moment, the members of the Clark family were nervous. The memories of bad guys storming into their house surfaced back in their minds, and they feared something like that would happen again.However, when they opened the door, they were greeted with a warm and kind smile. Hans said while smiling, \u201cThis is an order from Young Master Roman\u2014I will guide you to the new house you will be living in in the future.\u201dHans\u2019 words were like a blessing that had come down from the heavens.They were stunned\u2014At the sight unfolding before their eyes, Kevin\u2019s family could not come back to their senses.\u201c\u2026Are you seriously telling us to live here from now on?\u201dClark\u2019s voice was trembling as if he would burst into tears. The house in front of his eyes was utterly different from the shack he and his family had lived in earlier. Seeing the natural reaction to the beautifully built wooden house, Hans smiled and explained, \u201cOf course. Also, this isn\u2019t Young Master Roman\u2019s only gift for you. A part of the land owned by Young Master Roman will be leased to Mr. Clark. Of course, you don\u2019t need to pay any additional charges for that. The young master had made a promise to Kevin to look after his family, so you can think of the house and land as him keeping that promise and rewarding you.\u201dA good house and land\u2014That was a dream they had been dreaming of all their life. Suddenly being in a situation where it had been accomplished instantly, Clark spoke cautiously while suppressing his trembling emotions, \u201cWe already received a lot of grace from Young Master Roman just by him subjugating the Blood Fang. Nevertheless, may I ask you the reason why he is being so gracious? If we are receiving this in exchange for the sacrifice of our son, I cannot accept this. So please tell me the truth.\u201dRoman\u2019s gift was seriously too excessive\u2014Kevin was just an ordinary boy, and his father knew he didn\u2019t deserve such a great reward.Why?He couldn\u2019t understand why Roman was being so good to them.Hans simply laughed, \u201cEven I cannot fully understand the intentions of Young Master Roman. However, what is certain is that the young master intends to raise Kevin as his own person in the future. That\u2019s the only reason for such a reward. As he intends for Kevin to be his own person, he ordered me to help his family live a peaceful life as well.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dStill, what he couldn\u2019t understand remained the same\u2014However, Hans\u2019s smile and his words of raising Kevin as his own person calmed his anxious heart, albeit only a little.Afterward, Hans left quickly. Then, Kevin\u2019s family members, who had been staring at the house for quite a while, sat down and wept, regardless of whoever saw them.A comfortable house\u2014How hard had they been working just to have that? And seeing that they finally received it, Clark wept as he held his wife and daughter in his hands. Of course, for a while, their crying didn\u2019t stop. And not long after, the news began to spread, although little by little, throughout Dmitry.Rumors naturally circulated\u2014The Clark family from the slums succeeded in entering the castle.\u201cDid you hear that rumor?\u201d\u201cWhat rumor?\u201d\u201cThe Clark family\u2014The family that had caused a stir by misusing money taken from the usury group Blood Fang was called by Roman Dmitry to enter and live inside the castle. Moreover, the rumors say they got the land for free!\u201d\u201cReally?!\u201dThe man was startled. His reaction was natural. Entering the castle was a symbol of risen status. People without exceptional wealth had no choice but to live in the slums outside the castle. And the Clark family, who were not very rich, had succeeded in entering the castle. Of course, at first, most people didn\u2019t believe it. They didn\u2019t think there was any reason for Roman Dmitry to treat the Clark family like that, but as time passed, the rumor started popping up more and more.\u201cThe rumors were true. The Clark family not only lives in a good wooden house on the outskirts of the castle now, but they also rented land to cultivate. You can trust me because I only said it after seeing it myself.\u201d\u201cYou really never know what\u2019s going to happen in life. The Clark family, who almost completely ruined their lives due to usury, succeeded in turning their lives around in a totally unexpected way. By the way, the recent actions of Young Master Roman are also shocking. In the past, I only heard rumors of him causing an accident somewhere, but after the subjugation of Blood Fang, he even invited the Clark family to the castle. He\u2019s definitely different from before.\u201dRoman\u2014Once again, he had become the protagonist of the rumors. Just the fact that one\u2019s whole family\u2019s status had risen because he decided to follow him, the way people looked at Roman instantly changed\u2014Kevin was an ordinary boy. As he was given a house and land just because he swore allegiance to Roman, that meant the others had a chance as well.Was that why? As the Clark family\u2019s story spread across Dmitry, people started clamoring for Roman Dmitry\u2019s life and allegiance to be a jackpot. Truly, it wasn\u2019t a false rumor. In fact, that was the obvious result. However, some people still spoke negatively of Roman because of his reputation as \u201cDmitry\u2019s Fool.\u201d\u201cTsk tsk tsk, you idiots. You have lived in Dmitry for several decades and are still excited about the rumors. Do you seriously see Roman Dmitry as someone who will treat you that way? Of course, the subjugation of the Blood Fang was a setup by the Dmitry family! I bet Kevin will appear dead before us all soon enough.\u201dEven then, there was power in the remarks of those who spat out negative comments toward Roman Dmitry. However, after some time and finishing touches, something that completely changed Roman Dmitry\u2019s reputation happened.After Barco\u2019s banquet, immediately after returning to the Dmitry estate, Roman said, \u201cYou should go on a vacation for three days.\u201d\u201c\u2026A vacation?\u201dKevin rubbed his eyes.\u00a0A vacation? And that too for 3 days?\u00a0He couldn\u2019t easily accept it\u2014The poor had no vacation. While in the slums, on sunny days, he went out to work no matter what his condition was, and only when there was no work or the weather was terrible could he relax at home. Thus, the word vacation was very unfamiliar to him.As he looked at Roman with a blank expression on his face showing he did not know what to do, Roman said as if it was nothing special, \u201cGetting a good rest is also a part of training, Kevin. You\u2019ve worked hard all this time, so go and have a good time with your family.\u201d\u201c\u2026I understand.\u201dJust like that, Kevin took a vacation. Naturally, he was stunned. Kevin, who had earlier cut off contact with the outside world and focused only on his training, was not accustomed to going back to meet his family.Honestly, it\u2019s funny even if you think only a little bit about it\u2014Kevin has lived with his family all his life. However, in the short time he lived with Roman, he occupied a huge place in Kevin\u2019s life.\u2018Is this the real Roman Dmitry?\u2019Roman Dmitry was like an onion. Like the different layers in an onion, when dealing with foes such as the Blood Fang, he let out his cruel side, showing no mercy; however, to his own person, he was unbelievably kind and devoting. Of course, he wasn\u2019t warm to everyone. As his past actions clearly showed, whenever he moved, he didn\u2019t move without any purpose, and he did not recklessly consider just anyone as his own person.A person who made and followed his own rules\u2014That was Roman. Kevin didn\u2019t know what the real Roman was like, but there was one thing he was sure of.Before Kevin went on vacation, Hans came over and said, \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen your family in a long time, so how can you go while looking like that? Young Master Roman has prepared clean clothes for you, so wear them before going to meet your family. And don\u2019t you need money to buy gifts for your family? From now on, you will be paid 30 silvers every month, so go and have a good time. He doesn\u2019t care whether you buy a gift or luxuriate with it.\u201dClean clothes and money\u2014Those were Roman\u2019s gifts to him. Kevin cried.\u00a0Wow, he was such a meticulous person.\u00a0Despite always keeping a cold expression, Roman always knew what Kevin needed.\u00a0\u2018His cold expression doesn\u2019t matter to me. My liege treated me preciously, and that is enough for me to follow him.\u2019Then, Kevin started laughing. He went to the shower room, washed, and changed into the clothes Roman had prepared for him beforehand. Now, he had a different set of clothes from the loose-fitting ones he usually wore. The soft feeling of the luxurious clothes wrapped around his body made him ecstatic, and as the silver coins shook inside his pocket, he began to feel excited as he would see his family in a different form today. However, back then, Kevin had no idea what had happened to his family\u2014They were living a much better and more luxurious life than before, just like he had changed into clean clothes given by Roman to him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30 - Recruitment (3)At first, he thought it was strange\u2014When told to go to the outskirts of the castle rather than the shack in the slums, Kevin looked puzzled as if he was a child who could not understand English.\u2018Why are you telling me to go there?\u2019He never thought his family would have moved to the outskirts\u2014Kevin\u2019s parents did not have enough money to move to the castle, and they had given all their emergency funds to the Blood Fang due to their constant threats. So he simply thought that there was some \u2018business.\u2019\u2014That was the only thing Kevin could think of, and with the thought of meeting his parents and his sister, he stopped by a bakery to buy baguettes and whipped cream.\u2018Marie will really like it.\u2019Marie was his sister. She ate hard bread every morning and often complained, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we eat freshly made bread?\u201d Then, Kevin looked at her with a sullen look on his face as she put the bread down; however, he couldn\u2019t promise anything. The price difference between freshly made bread and bread hardened by cooling was more than double, and in particular, he couldn\u2019t even dare to buy fresh cream that could be eaten by spreading it on bread.Once in a while, everyone likes to splurge; however, knowing that hunger would be the price of her luxury, she grew mature at an early age and ate the hard bread Kevin stuffed into her mouth while ignoring her desires.However, today, it would be different\u2014There was still a lot of money left to buy her freshly baked bread and whipped cream, and Kevin decided to give the rest of his money to his parents once he met them. Eventually, he started laughing. And with light and joyous footsteps, he arrived at the place, albeit unprepared for what awaited him.And then,\u201c\u2026What is this?!\u201dHis mouth was wide open as if a bird would come and sit in it. The sight that had unfolded in front of him was the definition of unbelievable\u2014His parents, who earlier lived in a shack, were sipping tea in the yard of a stylish wooden house, and warm bread was steaming on the table as if it were pure bliss. Shockingly, that wasn\u2019t all. His sister, Marie, who used to wear shabby clothes made from pieces of different fabric, was wearing a pure white dress and watering the flowers in the yard.Kevin\u2019s world had utterly changed\u2014his family was no longer poor and was living the life of ordinary people who could enjoy everyday things.\u201cBrother!\u201d\u201cSon?!\u201dKevin\u2019s family found him standing outside, albeit belatedly.Finally seeing her brother after a whole month, Marie ran and hugged him, and Clark and Michelle also saw their son\u2019s face reddened with tears. It was time for a well-deserved family reunion. Although the freshly baked bread and whipped cream he had brought faded from his thoughts, Kevin was truly relieved to know that his family was doing so well.And then, he wondered\u2014His family\u2019s living conditions had changed. So what the hell had happened in the past one month? Seeing him confused, his father, Clark, spoke on behalf of his family, \u201cAt first, we were confused as well. Young Master Roman\u2019s servant, Mr. Hans, came to visit and gave us a house and land to cultivate in the future, explaining that it was Young Master Roman\u2019s order. Not only that, but he also gave us connections and financial support so that we could get a seat in the castle. Honestly, I seem to have been living a dream the past few days.\u201dKevin\u2019s father\u2019s talk was long\u2014He talked about the past and how his life had changed. However, Kevin couldn\u2019t hear his father for even a moment. The fact that the changes in his family had come from Roman reminded him of what he had said earlier\u2014\u201cIf you accept my offer, your family will never have to worry about their livelihood again. In a warm house that blocks the cold wind, eating three delicious meals every day, they will not only live a life in which they won\u2019t need to work hard but will also be able to enjoy hobbies. Living like that is simple. I plan to do the same in the future.\u201d The day Roman accepted Kevin as his own person, he had promised him that.Kevin had earlier thought he would need to sacrifice his life for Roman only due to the grace he had received back then, but Roman had kept his promise to him even without him realizing it\u2014Kevin\u2019s family no longer needed to worry about their livelihood. Also, the warm wooden house kept the cold wind out, and the food on the table clearly indicated a prosperous life.At that moment, Kevin started crying. With a burning feeling in his chest, Kevin lowered his head and swallowed his tears.\u00a0\u2019\u2026Thank you very much, my liege.\u2019Thank you.\u2014Even though they lived in a hierarchical society where the difference in status was considered absolute, Roman did not turn away from his promise to an ordinary boy who was nothing to the society. At that moment, Kevin realized his own beliefs were not wrong\u2014Roman was a man worthy of giving his life and swearing allegiance to, and now it seemed that even if he died for him, he would truly die with a smile on his face.\u2018Let\u2019s go back.\u2019Now is definitely not the time to relax.\u00a0He knew how powerless he was at Barco\u2019s banquet, so he needed to become stronger by training in Demonic Spirit Art as soon as possible. He didn\u2019t even care if he died in the process. He was sure Roman would keep his promise to look after his family, and as long as he had that confidence, he had no need to regret his choice.I will become strong.\u2014Once again, Kevin made up his mind to dedicate his life to Roman.However, Clark, who had been talking in utterance until recently, suddenly looked at Kevin\u2019s face, and his expression hardened instantly.\u201c\u2026Were you been beaten by Young Master Roman?\u201dHe saw the wounds on Kevin\u2019s face. Clearly, the red, swollen cheeks were signs of violence. The human heart is deceitful. So Kevin\u2019s parents, who were expressing their gratitude to Roman until recently, showed a fierce expression at that moment. \u201cTell me honestly. Did Young Master Roman actually touch your face?\u201dThey understood they could have been mistaken. Dmitry\u2019s Fool\u2014Rumors that undermined Roman\u2019s reputation also included the evil deed of him throwing swords at commoners. And if the traces of violence were due to Roman, Kevin\u2019s parents seemed agonizing for being rewarded in return for their son\u2019s suffering.\u201cN-No. Young Master Roman would never do that!\u201d\u201cThen why is your face like that?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s actually\u2026\u201dKevin hurriedly clapped his hands.\u2014In response to his parents\u2019 wish to know the truth, he countlessly recounted what he had experienced at Barco\u2019s banquet.\u201c\u2026And for that reason, I was slapped in the face by a knight of the Barco family. However, Young Master Roman didn\u2019t just ignore it; he stood up for me\u2014He asked the knight why he had beaten me, his own person, and he even punished Barco\u2019s knight in front of everyone at the banquet. Thanks to that, I was able to avoid turning into a clown in front of everyone. So, please don\u2019t misunderstand Young Master Roman. I know that he is called by a bad nickname, but in reality, at least the one I have experienced, he is not a violent person.\u201d\u201cIs that actually true?\u201d\u201cYes. You know I\u2019m not someone who would lie to my parents. So, please respect Young Master Roman.\u201dHearing Kevin\u2019s words, the Clarks looked at each other with puzzled faces. Of course, there was no way it was Roman\u2019s fault. However, his actions were entirely out of the common sense of the Clark family. Rather than hitting Kevin, which would\u2019ve easily solved the problem and avoided making a fuss, Roman had punished Barco\u2019s knight.Hearing Kevin say that Roman had punished Barco\u2019s knight, they became certain\u2014Roman Dmitry is utterly different from the rumors about him. Even if what Kevin said was only half true, Roman was totally different and misunderstood from the person he truly was.Michelle said, \u201cHe is a very graceful person. Not only does he treat our son as someone precious to him, but he also takes care of us, his family. Son, what Young Master Roman did back then was by no means an easy decision. We must remember this fact and dedicate ourselves to him, even beyond the grace we have received from the young master.\u201d\u201cYes. Also, if there is anything we can do for you too, please come and tell us.\u201dThose were the true feelings of his parents. Kevin didn\u2019t know that back then, his parents were truly moved. They were utterly engrossed in and admired Roman\u2019s personality\u2014And that was the fact that would be the starting point to ignite rumors which would soon spread throughout all of Dmitry.The reunion was short. And naturally, the aftermath of the reunion spread quickly in Dmitry.The day after Kevin went back, Clark, reunited with friends in the ghetto after a long time, couldn\u2019t stand his itchy mouth and talked about what had happened.\u201cI can\u2019t believe such false rumors existed in this world. You all know that my son, Kevin, serves Roman Dmitry, right? However, according to Kevin, Young Master Roman is truly a noble who deserves a noblesse oblige.\u201d\u201cDmitry\u2019s Fool? No way!\u201d\u201cHey, this guy! How do you think I got the house I live in now and the land for cultivation? Of course, Young Master Roman gave it to us because of Kevin. You can tell the character of Young Master Roman well just by looking at him. And not only that, there was an incident this time when Kevin followed him to the Barco\u2019s banquet. Later, there was an argument with the knights of Barco, but then, Young Master Roman stepped in and said that he would protect his person, Kevin, and in front of everyone, he slapped Barco\u2019s knight. That person is the true Roman Dmitry.\u201d\u201cIs that really true?\u201d\u201cOf course! Finally, someone understands.\u201dAt first, it was just a small rumor. However, that rumor quickly circulated all across Dmitry, and Michelle even set fire to the rumors. At the Village Laundry, Michelle answered the questions of the wives around her while doing laundry.\u201c\u2026Are the rumors really true? Do you mean Young Master Roman severely punished Barco\u2019s knight for hurting Kevin?\u201d\u201cOh my, where did you hear that? Having said that, Young Master Roman is truly a person who really values his people, including Kevin. So, even when the eldest son of Barco shouted that he would punish Kevin, the young master affirmed that he would support Kevin. Have you ever heard of such nobles existing in the world? Dmitry\u2019s Fool? That\u2019s just bullshit. I don\u2019t know what kind of guys dared to tarnish Young Master Roman\u2019s reputation, but in reality, he is a great person.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you saw Roman Dmitry causing a problem earlier?\u201d\u201cWhat?! I must have mistaken it, or it was someone who looked very similar to Young Master Roman.\u201dPraising her son\u2019s benefactor, Michelle forgot even her own bad memories. Back when he was known as Dmitry\u2019s Fool, and now, they were too different from being the same person. Rumors start from the bottom up\u2014Clarke and Michelle\u2019s words quickly spread around, and after evolving, they completely reversed Roman\u2019s negative image. Eventually, people said, \u201cRoman Dmitry is a man who values his people. If you earn his trust, you can lead a completely different life than before. The Clark family who succeeded in entering the castle due to their son\u2019s allegiance is proof of that.\u201dThe rumors were going around and being discussed in all of Dmitry. And just in time, Roman announced that he would recruit private soldiers under him. Of course, he never intended for that timing.\u201c\u2026For that reason, many people want to apply for this military recruitment. So give up. All the people in Dmitry are saying they\u2019ll use their body even a little bit, and they\u2019re all going to apply, so don\u2019t waste your time and spirit for nothing.\u201d The old man had finished his speech.Military recruitment\u2014At only a single post from Roman, all of Dmitry was shaken up. Lucas quietly listened to the old man\u2019s words and responded that he was confused due to the discrepancy in his memories.\u00a0\u2018The Roman Dmitry I know isn\u2019t the kind of guy who deserves such a huge reputation. Has Roman Dmitry really changed? Starting with the subjugation of the Blood Fang, even if what happened at Barco\u2019s banquet is only half true, Roman is not bad enough to be called Dmitry\u2019s Fool anymore.\u2019\u2014His interest piqued.\u2014What kind of change did Roman Dmitry have?Also, if the rumors were true and Roman was indeed someone who valued his own people, it was worth considering for Lucas to apply for the military recruitment as well.\u00a0\u2018The problem is that no such nobles exist in the world.\u2019\u2014That was something he would need to check for himself. It really interested him. It wasn\u2019t too late to apply for the recruitment, so he thought he should just apply for fun. Moreover, the mercenary job had gotten boring for him.3 days until the application deadline, cases like Lucas were common\u2014Because of those who broke down the barriers of prejudice, a large number of people headed to Dmitry Castle on the day of the test.Military recruitment\u2014Due to the unintentional rumors, it had grown unprecedentedly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31 - Recruitment (4)The day before the test.While sipping from a tiny teacup that did not fit his size, Baron Romero received a report from the Dmitry Knights\u2019 Captain, Jonathan.\u201cAll preparations for the test are complete now. We are only going to keep a minimal number of control forces to support the young master, and according to the talks with the young master, he himself will be taking care of the overall progress of the test.\u201d\u201cIs it that time already?\u201d\u201cYes. The number of visitors has increased significantly from early morning, and many people are willing to volunteer for the enlistment.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dBaron Romero remembered the moment he first heard the plan from Roman. Even back then, he was shocked when hearing about Roman\u2019s plans.\u00a0\u2019Roman said that he wanted to nurture private soldiers\u2014not for the Dmitry family, but for himself. That\u2019s usually not allowed in the aristocratic world. Giving your son personal power when the question of succession is unresolved is a choice that can have irreversible consequences.\u2019Nevertheless, Baron Romero quickly agreed. Most people\u2019s opinions were that the second son, rather than the eldest son of Dmitry, should be the successor. However, even though paying 8 silvers to 30 soldiers every month would not be a small expenditure, he did not even ask Roman for any justifications. Honestly, Roman\u2019s recent actions were hard to understand. When he was told that Roman was going to Barco\u2019s banquet after breaking up with the Lawrence family, the Baron thought that his son was trying to use his connections to collaborate with Barco to change the successor of Dmitry to himself. Barco\u2019s support would definitely be an ace up the sleeve for pushing out his second son and taking power by himself.However, what happened at the banquet was utterly beyond the Baron\u2019s expectations\u2014In front of the aristocrats of the North-East, he slapped Barco\u2019s knight even when Anthony Barco tried to stop him. Clearly, he had crossed the line\u2014Anthony Barco was a narrow-minded man, so he was sure to have a grudge against Roman for humiliating him. Even though he knew that Dmitry was strong, Anthony Barco would surely want to get revenge on Roman, even if it was indirectly. For example, he might intervene even in the succession of Dmitry\u2019s son. If he took the second son\u2019s side and not Roman\u2019s, he would be utterly disqualified from succeeding, both internally and externally, due to lacking support.That was the reason Baron Romero had granted Roman\u2019s request\u2014Roman Dmitry, who had destroyed and lived with his reputation as Dmitry\u2019s Fool for decades, had finally begun to live an \u2018independent life\u2019 starting with the Blood Fang incident. Naturally, he wanted to watch over him. He knew it would be hard for him to get him in the line of succession, but he still wanted Roman to do everything he wanted to become a better person. Having a father\u2019s heart, he had no choice but to cheer for his sore thumb. Moreover, his second son was living a luxurious life, due to his recognized talent, in the capital anyway.Baron Romero asked, \u201cSo, how many applicants are there? Fifty people? A hundred people? Considering Roman\u2019s reputation, I guess it would be fortunate to have more than just 50 people\u2014Being a private soldier rather than the family\u2019s soldier isn\u2019t something people usually prefer to be.\u201dThat\u2019s right. Private soldiers\u2014As the word implies, they only belonged to one person and were used to solve personal affairs. Hence, being a private soldier wasn\u2019t something people usually preferred. It was different from being the soldier of a noble family. Being the soldier raised under the title of protecting a noble family was preferred due to a stable job, but individual soldiers were easily abandoned depending on the circumstances.Fifty people at best.\u2014That was Baron Romero\u2019s expectation. According to him, as not many people would want to apply, the test was virtually unnecessary.However, Jonathan shook his head and said, \u201cAs soon as the guards confirmed the purpose of the people\u2019s entry, they told me that more than two hundred people had already visited Dmitry for the military recruitment test. And today\u2019s not even the day of the test. If things keep following this pace, I estimate that at least five hundred people will be tested on the day of the test.\u201dFive hundred people\u2014As Baron Romero heard a number he could never have imagined even in his wildest dreams, his body froze on the spot. \u201c\u2026That many?\u201d Suddenly, he felt like he was the one who had been underestimating Roman for a long time.At that same time, someone came to one of Dmitry\u2019s inn\u2019s doorstep and stepped inside. Inside the inn that was bustling with people, Lucas sat at the bar and drank his beer.Clang.\u201cKyaa.\u201dThe drink was truly incredible\u2014After feeling the stout characteristic of Dmitry\u2019s dark beer, Lucas frowned and carefully examined the surroundings.\u00a0\u2018How are there so many people flocking here even before the day of the test? I guess there will be more applicants than I initially expected. Nevertheless, the problem isn\u2019t the simple fact that there are a lot of applicants; the level of people who will apply for enlistment is higher than I thought.\u2019At first, Lucas had thought that this enlistment would be just the recruitment of some ordinary soldiers\u2014Although 8 silvers per month was a decent enough reward, there was no reason for veterans like Lucas, who had been through many trials, to apply for enlistment. Nevertheless, the reason Lucas had applied was purely out of curiosity about Roman Dmitry\u2014He wanted to see for himself how much the person known as Dmitry\u2019s Fool had changed and whether he really valued people, as the rumors said. However, Lucas was a special case. He thought that only ordinary people would mostly apply; however, more talented people than he had expected could be seen in his eyes.\u2019Those three men talking loudly at the table in the corner\u2014judging by the same-colored IDs hanging from their waists, they are highly likely to be C-class mercenaries. And then, the guys drinking side by side at the bar\u2014they don\u2019t look like mercenaries, but just looking at their physique and posture, I can see they\u2019re adept at fighting.\u2019Moreover, the inn he had come to was only one of the many inns in Dmitry. However, if 5 or 6 decent applicants could be seen only in this small space, the level of applicants was much higher than he initially expected. Of course, even then, he could see no one stronger than him. In the world of mercenaries, the difference between B-class and C-class was huge, and they deserved special treatment wherever they went.Lucas had a question\u2014Why? I understand the general public would, but why would mercenaries like me apply? I don\u2019t think it can be only because of rumors. It\u2019s remarkable enough that Roman changed the lives of the Clark family and treated Kevin so preciously that he even punished the knight of the Barco family. However, in the end, the most important thing is money. Eight silvers per month is a price only ignorant people would pay, and it is also an offer that people like me shouldn\u2019t be interested in.\u2018I don\u2019t understand.\u2019Glug glug.Lucas drank too much. And as he was about to get up from his seat, he heard something that caught his attention\u2014\u201cHenderson, why are you here? Didn\u2019t you want to become a knight of the Lawrence family?\u201d\u2014That was a conversation between two men. Lucas sat back down and listened to him.The situation was like this\u2014There was a man named Henderson from Lawrence. In preparation for the war against the Barco family, Lawrence conscripted the permanent residents of Lawrence. Naturally, most of the strong men responded to conscription. And Henderson, of course, had decided to fight for Lawrence not too long ago; however, an incident changed his mind completely. Henderson said, \u201cAs you know, I was going to join the conscription even though I wasn\u2019t eligible. If Lawrence, my hometown, was destroyed, my life would have no meaning anyway. However, when I saw Roman Dmitry subjugating Blood Fang in Lawrence, I changed my mind. I understood that he was a real leader.\u201dThat day, Henderson was one of those people who were present in the city square. He saw Roman for the first time\u2014A young master from a noble family, who must have been cherished since childhood, appeared in front of the commoners covered in blood. Also, Roman had grabbed Ben Miles\u2019 hair with one hand and was dragging him along. Knowing just how dangerous Ben Miles was, people like Henderson couldn\u2019t help but hold their breath. And then, Roman executed Ben Miles. Obviously, those who were not present did not believe that day\u2019s events, but Henderson could not forget that moment.\u201cBlood Fang even extended their demonic beasts to Dmitry. With their obscene methods, they plunged Dmitry\u2019s citizens into hell and even showed intent to kill me, who interfered with them. Blood Fang\u2019s sin is clear as crystal. Therefore, in front of you, I will get rid of this evil at its very roots.\u201d\u2014That\u2019s what Roman had said back then. In order to punish the Blood Fang who dared to touch Dmitry\u2019s people, he came to Lawrence by himself and killed their leader\u2014Ben Miles\u2019 blood spattered, and his head flew away. The children screamed and closed their eyes, but Henderson clearly witnessed the splattering of blood with his eyes.\u2018Wow.\u2019He shuddered.\u00a0Look at Roman! He\u2019s a leader who raises his sword for his citizens! I can\u2019t believe there was such a person in the world!Henderson, who was reminiscing and talking about the moment with a flushed face, explained to others why he hoped to become Roman\u2019s private soldier.\u201cPeople doubt and deny what happened in Lawrence. I myself didn\u2019t think Roman Dmitry would ever be able to do such a thing. However, I saw it and felt it with my own body. Roman Dmitry is not a weak human being, as rumored in the world, but a leader who fights for his people. And this military recruitment is a golden opportunity to become one of Roman Dmitry\u2019s people. I want to pass the test, get a permanent residence in Dmitry, and live as one of Roman Dmitry\u2019s people.\u201dNew stories piled up one after another, destroying Roman\u2019s horrible reputation of the past. Subduing Blood Fang; The Clark family; protecting and avenging Kevin\u2014People now flocked to praise Roman\u2019s name, not because of a single event, but because of synergy from multiple events.People thought\u2014If it\u2019s the new and changed Roman, isn\u2019t he worthy of my allegiance? Even if you ignore him treating one well in return for his loyalty, respecting people, and fighting against evil hordes such as Blood Fang, there is no doubt he has no hesitation in drawing his sword.\u00a0They couldn\u2019t help but support him. Even those who thought they were worth 8 silvers or more felt inexplicable emotions rising inside them; the blood in their heart boiled when they heard Roman\u2019s story and achievements.A lot of people applying to become his private soldier was no accident. People have eyes and ears, and due to that, slowly, the true face of Roman would be revealed to everyone.On the day of the test, the day was bright. And in the exam hall crowded with people, Lucas was still immersed in his own world.\u00a0\u2018If everything I heard earlier was true, what choice should I make now?\u2019At this place, many others were feeling the same as Lucas. However, those who were dubious and still expressed their intention to apply would soon face the truth about Roman.That was truly the moment of choice.\u00a0Should I take this exam seriously? Or should I just drop out after seeing Roman?\u2014Lucas, who had spent his whole life at the front lines and earned a B-class mercenary title, seriously thought about whether it was worth investing and giving up his life to Roman while being paid the frugal price of 8 silvers every month. It wasn\u2019t a condition he would normally even consider. However, the sense of Lucas, the same sense that made him a B-class mercenary, directed him to the testing ground. Naturally, the exam room was noisy. There were at least five hundred people there. And since there was no one to sanction them, many people were making a lot of noise as if they were on the market floor.\u201cAhahahahaha.\u201d\u201cDid that really happen?\u201d\u201cAfter the test, let\u2019s go get a beer!\u201dHowever, just then, even though no one told them to stop, even though no one stopped them from talking, the commotion subsided. People\u2019s eyes naturally shrank and turned seeing that the noise had disappeared from each side. Naturally, Lucas was no different. And just when he shifted his gaze,\u201c\u2026!\u201dHe was out of breath. His hair stood up, and he remembered it\u2014fighting for his life on the front lines. Lucas unconsciously lowered his head when the extreme tension that could only be felt back then was revived in the current situation. It seemed like everyone else had done the same thing. They all saw one man\u2014his appearance and his gait. And Lucas, just like everyone else, bowed his head to greet him.\u00a0\u2018The rumors were true.\u2019Roman Dmitry had finally appeared and was walking through the crowd.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32 - Recruitment (5)Today was different from the day of the banquet. If Roman was like a colorful peacock as a nobleman on that day, today, he was equipped with a weapon that looked like he would go to battle right now.Roman\u2019s aura was serious. The people in the crowd unwittingly gave way, and everyone on both sides bowed their heads, not daring to look into Roman\u2019s eyes.People\u2019s gaze; People\u2019s reactions\u2014Roman took them for granted. Even before he was recognized as the new Heavenly Demon in the Hundred-Thousand Mountains, and even before he slaughtered the righteous sects that came in like waves and conquered Murim, Roman\u2014No, Baek Joong-hyuk lived as a ruler, so he knew what kind of attitude he needed to show right now.Step step.He walked forward. People looked into each other\u2019s eyes\u2014It was incomprehensible. Guided by the rumors of Roman Dmitry, they had applied for the military recruitment, but some people thought he wasn\u2019t really worthy of ruling over the enlisted soldiers. However, after seeing Roman in person, they had no choice but to re-evaluate their thoughts.It was a natural atmosphere. Honestly, Roman had expected others to show an attitude like this. However, he was different from how the general public viewed him; the men who were chattering earlier could not say anything now.Silence lingered for some time. And finally, Roman stood before the people who had come for the military enlistment. Seeing over five hundred people bow their heads towards him, Roman said calmly, \u201cRaise your head.\u201d\u2014Although he had said it calmly, it was actually an order. People eventually raised their heads. Roman hadn\u2019t done anything special yet, but everyone was already caught up in his momentum.\u201cAs stated in the announcement, today, you have the opportunity to become one of the 30 soldiers who will fight for me. Of course, I will be doing the selection process. However, I have something to tell you before we begin the test. I, Roman Dmitry, have no intention of staying cooped up in this remote territory on the outskirts. I will always fight to achieve a higher position than I have at that moment, and while you fight alongside me, risking your life is an unavoidable fate. So, those who aren\u2019t willing to follow me with a firm resolve, turn back now. The moment you lose your head on the battlefield, do not resent me for driving you to fight on the battlefield. The only thing you should regret at that moment is that you couldn\u2019t witness me standing as the most powerful on this continent while staying by my side.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dOf course, people were astonished. Roman\u2019s speech was absolutely arrogant. Roman Dmitry, whose position of successor to the Dmitry family, far from being the most powerful on the continent, was at stake, said he would become the most powerful on the continent in front of so many people. Nevertheless, the problem was that there wasn\u2019t even the slightest laughter from anyone. The charisma that Roman exuded and the firm attitude he showed created the illusion that such a thing could actually happen.I get it.Roman\u2019s words are nonsense.However, the rumors and ideals which guided people to come here did not allow them to turn back after seeing Roman with their own eyes.Roman added, \u201cIf you pass the test and become mine, you will be able to live your life as a predator who can make their own choices and decide their own life. I, Roman Dmitry, promise you that.\u201dThat was the end of it. Then, Roman Dmitry stepped back. And finally, the moment when the curtain of the exam would rise came.There was no applause when Roman finished his speech. The tension everyone felt was suffocating. Seeing the people who still couldn\u2019t take their eyes off Roman, Chris stepped forward and announced, \u201cFrom now on, I will tell you how to proceed with the first test.\u201dFive hundred volunteers\u2014Lucas thought the level of those who applied for enlistment was higher than he initially expected, but by Roman\u2019s standards, there wasn\u2019t much difference\u2014Most of these people probably wouldn\u2019t even be able to counter a single of Chris\u2019 attack.However, for now, it was best to measure the volunteers through another method, and starting from the bottom was not an unfamiliar situation for Roman\u2014Of the 12 people that came out of the cave, Baek Joong-hyuk was the first to form a group. Even back then, there was chaos as many wanted to stay by his side, but Baek Joong-hyuk confirmed whether they were worthy through a single value.\u2014\u2018What I want is strong mental strength. Those born with the heart of a beast will quickly become strong even if they start from rock bottom. Moreover, only such people can afford to walk alongside me.\u2019The heart of the beast was an innate talent\u2014Kevin, who raised his sword without hesitation at the command to cut off his arm, or Chris, who asked the victor how to become strong even after suffering a disastrous defeat.\u2014They were two cases which represented those who were born with the heart of the beast. No matter how strong they are, those who do not have the heart of a beast cannot guarantee victory in battles with those born with that.30 people who would be selected\u2014Roman did not set any particular conditions for them. Why? Even if they did not know how to wield a sword, Roman wished to obtain such talents who would still use a sword or their bare hands to emerge victorious.Chris continued, \u201cThe method of testing is simple. When the applicant stands in the designated position, the archer we prepared will fire three arrows at the applicant. The arrow can either pierce the applicant\u2019s body and inflict fatal wounds, or it can barely miss and pierce the plate behind their back. What is certain is that only those who do not move an inch while all three arrows are fired can be qualified as those who passed the first test.\u201d\u2014The first exam was a test to confirm the courage of the applicants.The test began. As the first applicant stepped forward, Morrison, who was supposed to go second, could not hide his nervousness.\u00a0\u2018This is supposed to be a test. Everyone has gone crazy!\u2019\u00a0Morrison was an ordinary commoner. Having made a living as a miner in an iron mine, he thought a job that covered him with dust daily was not suitable for him.Naturally, he had always wanted to be a cool knight like Chris. Even though he did not know how much blood and sweat a knight had to shed to get to the level of Chris, he fell in love with his manly delusions while looking at the glistening armor reflecting the sunlight.To someone like him, the recruitment was a golden opportunity of a lifetime. Thinking that he could learn martial arts while having an attractive salary of 8 silvers per month, he quit his job and took the exam.And, obviously, Morrison had no intention of risking his life for the test.\u00a0\u2018Fuck, fuck, fuck.\u2019\u00a0His body was trembling as if someone had put a dagger on his neck. It was terrifying. Seeing the archer pulling the arrow backward, he only wanted to deny the reality that would soon befall him.\u2018How the hell is someone supposed to trust that archer? Even if one is a sharpshooter, they cannot always be perfect, and the cost of their mistakes can cost another person\u2019s life. I don\u2019t want to die. The reason I took the test was to get a chance to become a knight while training as a soldier, but I have no intention of dying in vain, damn it!\u2019\u201cHaah, Haah.\u201d He exhaled harshly.The first applicant stood in the designated position. Seeing the first applicant\u2019s nervous expression, Morrison glanced over to look at Roman\u2019s expression\u2014Blank. It was completely blank, as if nothing major was happening. Seeing that Roman was not worried about any accident at all, Morrison calmed down.\u00a0\u2018Right. This is a simple test. No matter how much Roman Dmitry wants a brave soldier, he doesn\u2019t want people to actually die during a test. I guess the archer conducting the test is extremely talented and will never make a mistake. That\u2019s right\u2014Anyone with common sense would never follow a killer who puts people to death in a test for enlisting men.\u2019He unclenched his hand and saw it\u2014There was a lot of sweat. When he first heard how the test was conducted, he thought it was extreme, but after thinking about it, he realized that Chris was deliberately putting people into fear. And fear comes from imagination. Even if the archer shows off his skills during the test, the applicants with a weak mentality have no choice but to be engulfed in fear from the moment Chris warned that they might lose their life.It\u2019s a mental battle.\u2014He felt certain that if he held on to the fact that nothing would happen, the arrow would definitely miss.\u00a0\u2018Well, even Roman isn\u2019t crazy enough to proceed with the trial while ignoring the blood of someone.\u2019\u00a0He was relieved. And, at the exact moment when he took a deep breath,Whoosh!\u201cAhhhhhh!\u201dThe first applicant fell to the floor while screaming. The first arrow had been nailed to the plate at the back. However, the second arrow went off the path and gracefully pierced the first volunteer\u2019s thigh.Whoosh!\u201cAhhhhhh!\u201d The applicant collapsed down on the spot.The strong-looking man fell to the floor and screamed, and blood gushed like a fountain from the part the arrow had pierced. Drops of red blood were dripping all over the place.\u2014Chris and the other applicants rushed to treat the applicant, but when they saw the blood that was gushing like a fountain, Morrison and the other applicants\u2019 faces turned pale. They saw it\u2014An arrow had clearly pierced his thigh. Obviously, the archer was no sharpshooter. And if the arrow had pierced the head rather than the thigh, the applicant would have died instantly.\u201c\u2026This is crazy.\u201d\u201cDid he really mean for us to be prepared for being shot?\u201d\u201cThis is nonsense.\u201dOf course, people were agitated. As they looked at the applicant, and then at each other, Chris, who was treating the applicant, laughed inside.\u00a0\u2018As expected.\u2019\u00a0It was all planned by Roman from the beginning\u2014including the first applicant. The archer was a well-known marksman in the vicinity, and the first applicant knew that his thigh would be pierced. Still, he was determined to take the exam. Roman promised him in advance that the archer would shoot an arrow at an area that would not fatally injure him, and he paid a huge compensation in return. It was a good deal for both of them. Roman also demanded that he fall to the floor and scream and squawk in the deal.Chris checked the injured person\u2019s condition and confirmed that it was not a serious injury, just as they had planned. However, he deliberately showed a serious expression.\u2014As if it was a fatal wound, Chris treated him urgently and carefully.\u2018It\u2019s just as the young master said. We can\u2019t find the type of people we want by mere verbal threats. That\u2019s why we need to show them they actually need to risk their lives. It\u2019s only one accident. However, even if there are only chances of it happening only once every hundred arrows, the weak applicants will be intimidated by that 1% chance.\u2019 And the horror doesn\u2019t end just there. Once every hundred arrows means there will be four more victims in the future; that will keep the tension of most applicants high until the very end.They moved the wounded. Seeing the blood dripping on the floor as the wounded was carried on a stretcher, Morrison\u2019s face, which had recently been resolute, grew pale and weary.He thought to himself.\u00a0Since this kind of accident happened with the first applicant, they might make a safety device or change how the test will be conducted.However, the reality was harsh.\u201cNext.\u201d\u2014Those were Chris\u2019 words.Seeing Chris saying \u2018next\u2019 while wiping the blood off his hands, Morrison shut his eyes tightly. He gave up\u2014He waved a white flag. Seeing that, Chris clicked his tongue. It was clear that those who were not born with the heart of a beast would not even be able to pass the first test easily.\u201cThe second person will be treated as an applicant who gave up. Those who are afraid of arrows piercing their bodies, give up now. And remember\u2014even if an arrow gets stuck in one\u2019s body, if they clench their teeth and endure it, they will be able to earn the qualifications of a successful applicant. So, you cowards who are afraid of losing your lives, get the fuck out of this exam right now!\u201dNow, the first test had truly begun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33 - Recruitment (6)Just as expected, when the first applicant suffered injuries, cowards like Morrison hurriedly turned away.\u201cI will not take this barbaric test!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? Even if an arrow is stabbed in your body, endure it? If it makes me crippled, will he take responsibility for my life? I don\u2019t know what the hell he was thinking while deciding to conduct a test like this, but I\u2019ll just give up here.\u201d\u201cI will give up as well. He isn\u2019t even a noble within the central government; I do not want to give my life for Roman Dmitry.\u201dMany people expressed their intention to give up simultaneously. However, Chris did not impose any sanctions on the people who were complaining and leaving. Before starting the test, Roman had told him not to force anyone.\u2014We need people who will be genuinely loyal, rather than just idiots who are greedy for a reward like Kevin\u2019s. It is human nature for those kinds of people to betray us whenever they\u2019re in trouble. However, if we can identify their fundamental nature and qualities at first, we can quickly identify people and pick those who are at least worth our time.The test, naturally, continued. More than a hundred people had left the exam hall, but not everyone expressed their intention to give up.\u201cI am Henderson.\u201d\u2014A man from Lawrence; he came out with a sad face. As a mere commoner, he rarely risked his life. However, today, he bit his lips while trembling, fearing death. Honestly, he wanted to give up the exam right away, just like everyone else. However, when he remembered Roman, who punished the Blood Fang for harassing Dmitry\u2019s people, Henderson recalled how determined he was to pass this test.Every once in a while, everyone dreams of something. And as a man, he dreamed of swearing allegiance to someone like Roman. It\u2019s not that he was trying to achieve something great, but just remembering what Roman had said back then gave him the strength to continue this test.\u201cFirst shot.\u201d The archer shot the arrow.Despite seeing bloodshed in the first test, he calmly aimed the arrow\u2014as if nothing had happened.Henderson\u2019s eyes widened. He looked like he was trembling. Nevertheless, the archer grinned and shot an arrow.Whoosh!\u201c\u2026Huff.\u201cHenderson took a deep breath. He noticed an arrow had pierced the plate, just 5 cm away from his face. His heart was pounding, and as he thought if he should give up, the archer shot the next arrow.\u201cSecond shot.\u201dHe was late.\u2014He couldn\u2019t even open his mouth. And rather than allowing him to proceed with the test with great courage, the archer shot the next arrow while Henderson was hesitating.Grip!\u201cThird shot.\u201dWhoosh!It seemed as if the time had passed in an instant. When Henderson confirmed that the last arrow had been safely nailed to the plate rather than his own body, he lost strength in his legs and collapsed down on the spot. A cold sweat was running down his forehead. As Henderson looked up ahead with a pale face, Chris said indifferently, \u201cHenderson, pass.\u201d Seriously, it was a test he never wanted to take again.The number of successful applicants was higher than expected. 400 people had applied.1\u00a0And among them, 120 people had passed the first test. Naturally, most of them were shivering like Henderson, but some had passed the first test confidently. All successful candidates gathered in one place.Roman stepped forward. \u201cYou all have passed the first test. You all have proven your worth as warriors with this test; however, the number of people I want is 30. Therefore, I will test you once more through the second test.\u201dActually, if any ordinary person saw the test, they would\u2019ve decided who was more valuable at a glance.\u2014Lucas, who finished the test while smiling, was more valuable than Henderson, who was shivering with a pale face. In fact, the two differed from each other in their power too.However, by Roman\u2019s standards, the difference between the two was not particularly special.\u2014Although Henderson felt fear, he did not leave his place while the three arrows were fired, and what Roman wanted to confirm through the first test was if one had the courage to suppress fear on their own.Everyone feels fear. And rather than being worn out and insensitive to fear on the battlefield, it is more impressive to see how they handle their fear.And,\u2018The people gathered here have their own circumstances.\u2019The people who had gathered here were those who wanted to enlist even after hearing the stigma of Dmitry\u2019s Fool. Their reasons for wanting to support him were, naturally, diverse.\u2014They could be people like Henderson, who witnessed Roman\u2019s appearance in Lawrence and were shocked and wanted to follow him. And there would also be people like Lucas, who were drawn in by rumors and curiosity, or simply liked the rewards for an enlisted soldier.Everyone had their own reason. Nevertheless, Roman wanted to find the hidden gems. Regardless of the purpose and regardless of their level of strength, he needed people who were born with the heart of a beast\u2014Those who would feel awe at their liege, not fear.Therefore, strength was not an absolute evaluation criterion for this enlistment. Lucas must have possessed outstanding skills that earned him the title of a B-class mercenary; however, Roman was confident that he could develop a soldier like Lucas with his teachings at any given time.It was a matter of choice\u2014Would he accept Lucas and turn him into a stronger soldier, or would he accept Henderson and help him grow him step by step? Roman carefully looked at the applicants. While talented people like Lucas showed confidence in passing, others lacked that confidence.\u2018What I want to confirm from them now is their attitude towards me. Only those who know who I am and feel awe, not fear, can dream of staying by my side in the future.\u2019When he met Kevin and even when he met Chris, Roman always proved his worth in the same way. The world of survival of the fittest\u2014In that harsh world, in order to rule over someone\u2019s head, one needed visible power, not sweet words.Absolute domination\u2014Roman, as always, longed for blind loyalty.\u201cFrom now on, we will proceed with the second test. The process is simple. Prove your worth by sparring with me. I don\u2019t expect you to win. If there are people who can stand up against me for even a single minute, regardless of the reason, they will pass the entire test, and I will give them significant rewards.\u201dRoman\u2019s speech was, once again, absolutely arrogant. At first, everyone was confused. A whopping 120 people would take the second test. They acknowledged that Roman was a talented person, but even if he dealt with every one of them for just one minute, the test would take 120 minutes in total.\u00a0What did he mean when he said if you hold out for a minute, you\u2019ll pass?\u00a0People reacted as if it were absurd.Roman was, once again, absolutely arrogant. If the remarks he just made were only empty words, they wouldn\u2019t be able to hide their disappointment in Roman. Nevertheless,\u201cI will take the test first.\u201dA person who was presumed to be a mercenary stepped forward proudly. With a muscular physique approaching 2 m and a face covered in scars, it was evident that he had experienced harsh struggles on the battlefield. He was also the kind of person who passed the first test proudly.Nevertheless, as much as he liked Roman\u2019s self-confidence, he was furious at his remarks.\u00a0\u2018If I hold out for a minute, you\u2019ll let me pass? Roman Dmitry\u2019s confidence is very high. If Roman really subjugated the Blood Fang alone, it would mean he has significant power, but even so, it\u2019s impossible to defeat me in just one minute. I will prove my worth by passing the exam on my first attempt.\u2019Step.He stood in front of Roman. Seeing the huge difference in their physiques, people looked at Roman and the applicant alternatively.\u201cTake this sword.\u201d Chris threw the sword at the mercenary. It was a wooden sword that wasn\u2019t lethal, and compared to the size of the applicant, it was small enough to look like a toy.\u201cStart.\u201d Chris gave the signal.And the man, who had been waiting for his signal, wriggled his gigantic muscles and slammed his feet into the ground as soon as Chris said the word. Clearly, he didn\u2019t intend to pass the exam by holding on for one minute. He knew he might become one of Roman\u2019s soldiers in the future, but he needed to clarify his position and show Roman what kind of person he was.There was no mercy in his hands. Seeing the sword being fiercely swung toward Roman\u2019s neck, people naturally thought Roman would be pushed back by the sheer force of the attack.However,Swoosh.Only the sound of wind blowing could be heard after the attack. The sword wielded by the man had only swayed Roman\u2019s hair, and Roman had evaded the man\u2019s sword with a single light and swift movement. For a moment, Chris shook his head. Having had the direct experience of having a duel with Roman, he knew how threatening a move to nullify an attack with a single step was.And at that moment, the man\u2019s face was stained with embarrassment. He hurriedly retrieved the sword and tried to attack Roman once again, but before he could react, his world turned upside down.Clack.Thud!\u201cKeuk.\u201dAs Roman stepped forward, the man\u2019s balance broke, and his massive body fell to the ground. Now, there was nothing more to see. The moment the man lifted his head and tried to check where Roman was, Roman suddenly pointed a sword at his neck.\u201cNext.\u201dThat was it. The fight had already finished. And people finally realized that this test would be incomparably more difficult than the first one.Nevertheless, people thought\u2014Even if Roman is strong, by the time he reaches the 60th round, his stamina is sure to be exhausted. After that, there will be no choice, and everyone should pass one after another.\u00a0Thus, people postponed their fights. They wanted to somehow manage the time and grab the title of being a successful applicant. However, the results were utterly different from their expectations.\u201c\u2026This can\u2019t be possible.\u201dThe 60th contender\u2014He also fell out with a single strike. People rubbed their eyes with both hands as the challenger collapsed helplessly, confirming what was happening in front of them was indeed real.\u2018Is Roman a monster?\u201960 fights.60 defeats.Everyone couldn\u2019t hold on for 30 seconds, let alone one minute. People who were confident in their abilities fought Roman proudly, but when they came to their senses, the sky was in front of them. They got goosebumps and realized the rumors were indeed true\u2014Roman Dmitry was strong enough to subdue the Blood Fang with his own strength, and there was no trace of the one known as Dmitry\u2019s Fool.His attitude towards people, his overwhelming power, and his charisma that grabbed people\u2019s hearts just from the sound of his voice showed what kind of person Roman was. They remembered what he had said first and realized it\u2014Roman is a predator. In a world of survival of the fittest, he\u2019s a predator who can decide others\u2019 lives at his own will.People\u2019s hearts raced. Looking at Roman\u2019s face, they thought what he had said earlier would really come true\u2014\u201cIf you pass the test and become mine, you will be able to live your life as a predator who can make their own choices and decide their own life. I, Roman Dmitry, promise you that.\u201dLiving independently, without any constraints\u2014That was sweeter than anything else in the world. Then, people faced reality. And finally, their eyes changed to a serious look.\u00a0\u2018I need to pass this test somehow. Becoming one of Roman\u2019s people is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that will never come again.\u2019Their instincts told them clearly\u2014Hold on to the rope that has fallen from the sky, even if you need to hold onto it with your teeth. Right now, Roman is still regarded as Dmitry\u2019s Fool. Thus, right now is the perfect opportunity to get on the sleeping dragon\u2019s back.Just then,\u201cNext.\u201d\u201cYes, I am coming.\u201dThe 61st applicant, Lucas, headed for the stage.This is the number of applicants who were left after deducting those who left the exam hall because they were afraid of dying or getting injured.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34 - Recruitment (7)Published onJul 20, 2022\u202211 min read\u2022333 viewsLucas swallowed dry saliva watching the countless applicants be defeated without much effort in the previous 60 turns.Gulp.\u2018Can I deal with that monster?\u2019He felt it from the moment he saw Roman for the first time\u2014A monster\u2014There was no other way to express it other than those words. Just by looking at him, his heart was under pressure, and cold sweat formed on his forehead. It was so bad that his palms were wet with sweat even though he did not have hyperhidrosis.Lucas, who was aware of the danger of facing Roman from the beginning, did not smile as cheerfully as the other applicants when Roman mentioned he would do 120 duels by himself.The forefront\u2014In the realm of life and death, where even the slightest carelessness could lead to death, Lucas\u2019 keen senses had always saved his life. And it was the same this time\u2014All his instincts told him that Roman was a monster he couldn\u2019t handle even in a hundred years, and based on his past experiences, it was best to avoid a situation like this one. It was clearly a battle in which his defeat was evident.He clenched his teeth. If he passed this test, he would have to work for only 8 silvers per month, but there was a reason he couldn\u2019t turn away\u2014\u2018It\u2019s the first time in my life that I have ever felt like this. I have witnessed many rankers while moving around the battlefield, but there was no one who had put such pressure on me purely with their presence. Roman Dmitry is completely different from what I remember. As he said, he is not a person who will stay and rot on the outskirts, and it is clear as crystal that one day he will spread his wings and take over the entire continent.\u2019Lucas\u2014A B-class mercenary. People often said he had gotten to a great position, but Lucas knew he wasn\u2019t that great.B class is known as the limit of his effort. If ordinary people risk their lives and work hard, they can also get B-class qualifications; however, unless they can use mana, they are not allowed to be promoted to A-class. A-class onward, there were beings that could not be surpassed by mere battlefield experience. A strong force was needed to overpower them, and the essential condition for that was the flowering of mana.1Lucas had reached that limit. As he barely dodged death, he realized that no matter how hard he tried, he had now reached his limit.Coming to Dmitry was, in reality, a desperate choice. Lucas was at a crossroads of choices, and while longing for a break, he saw an article that Roman was recruiting enlisted men.\u2018Roman said\u2014he promised to let those who follow him live the life of a predator. I can\u2019t rationally understand why I gave up on the comfortable life of a B-class mercenary and came to follow Roman, but for now, I want to believe in what Roman said. Just one year\u2014I will follow him for just one year and check if he stays true to his words even after that. So,\u2019He clenched his fist tightly. Then, he went up to the stage, looked at Roman, and grabbed the sword he had prepared separately.\u2018For now, passing this test is my biggest priority.\u2019\u201cStart.\u201dTap.As soon as the start signal dropped, Lucas kicked the ground harshly.In all of the previous 60 duels, except for the first opponent, no one had dared to advance first. Obviously, watching the giant man go forward without a hitch, everyone thought he had made a hazardous choice.It was, of course, natural. This was a duel. Lucas didn\u2019t need to achieve victory; he just needed to endure fighting for one minute. However, attacking first was no different from sticking your neck on the opponent\u2019s sword. Nevertheless, Lucas had a different idea in mind\u2014\u2018If I delay even a little bit, Roman will be the one who will attack first. In order for me to survive the one-minute time period, I have to take the initiative in this duel. That\u2019s the only way I can win this fight.\u2019It was an instinctive decision\u2014And of course, if you have made a decision, the execution must be drastic. A single second of hesitation on the battlefield was directly linked to death, so Lucas aimed at Roman\u2019s head and heart simultaneously and attacked without hesitation.Fwoosh!Lucas\u2019 weapon was truly unique\u2014He used a slightly short sword in his right hand and a dagger in his left hand\u2014Both weapons were made of wood. Roman had provided other types of wooden weapons at the applicant\u2019s request, and Lucas was not the first one to ask for that.However, his fighting style was unique\u2014Roman\u2019s head and heart\u2014He slashed toward Roman\u2019s head with his sword and stabbed toward his heart with his dagger.Swish.Clack!Roman\u2019s movements were quite simple. He stepped back to avoid the dagger from reaching him, then slashed toward the opponent\u2019s sword with the wooden sword he was holding.Naturally, Lucas quickly closed in. He changed the direction of his sword, swung it as if he would cut Roman\u2019s neck, and threw the dagger in his other hand towards Roman\u2019s solar plexus. It was truly anomalous. There hadn\u2019t been any attempts for a ranged attack yet, but Roman swung his sword again\u2014this time to block all attacks at once.\u2018Again, damn it.\u2019\u00a0Indeed, it was a scene of admiration. Normally, openings are likely to be exposed when trying one is trying to defend without stopping, but Roman was like a strong iron castle.His breath was choked\u2014He wanted to step back in case Roman attacked him suddenly, but he couldn\u2019t afford to do that right now.\u2018Anyway, my opponent has no intention of killing me. However, even if it means giving up my flesh, I must not give Roman an opportunity to take the initiative to attack. Only 40 seconds. I just have to hold on until then, so I just have to buy some time.\u2019Tap tap.Lucas ran even faster. He pulled out another dagger that had been hung on his waist, and he once again drove himself forward while aiming for his opponent with a two-way attack.At that moment,Pfft.\u00a0Roman laughed.\u2014\u2018Lucas, huh? He\u2019s pretty good.\u2019\u2014An attack that ignores one\u2019s own life is not a good choice on the battlefield, but he seems to have made a judgment worthy of a duel.Roman realized Lucas had good instinctive senses.These types of people are very useful on the battlefield. There is a high probability that Lucas will pass this test with flying colors, but that doesn\u2019t mean I will let him hold out for a minute. One minute\u2014That is a wall\u2014A wall to show everyone how great the master whom they will follow in the future is.By making a definite mark on their first meeting, Roman sought to earn the blind trust of the applicants.\u2018Let\u2019s end this.\u2019Swing!Tap tap.Literally, in an instant, Lucas\u2019 attacks were blown away, and Roman\u2019s combo attack broke his defense. Moreover, he hadn\u2019t even used the weapon with both hands\u2014Lucas\u2019s face was stained with astonishment, and people thought the match was over now.However, just then, Lucas evaded the attack by throwing himself to the ground, and before anyone knew it, he threw the sand he had prepared pre-match on Roman\u2019s face.Fwip!And that\u2014was an obvious foul. Still, in this fight, there were no special rules. Roman had only told the applicants to hold on for a minute, so Lucas did everything he could.\u2018This is a duel where victory and defeat can make an astronomically huge difference. I need to do everything I can to win this fight.\u2019Avoiding Roman\u2019s attack was a lucky decision. Considering the length of the opponent\u2019s weapon, he threw himself to the ground first and, fortunately, was able to dodge the attack in only a short amount of time. After that, he immediately sprinkled the sand he had brought in his pocket. He had thought he could never win under normal conditions, so he thought the result would be different if he could temporarily obstruct Roman\u2019s view.Fwip!Roman was successfully hit by the sand. And as soon as Lucas fell to the ground, he got up again and ran like a bull toward Roman.He can\u2019t do a counterattack. Now is my time to seize the opportunity and defeat him.However, Lucas, who was about to reach Roman and swing his sword, looked up; then, his face became pale.\u201cHuh?!\u201dRoman was looking straight at Lucas. Naturally, Lucas was confused. He thought that Roman might have avoided the sand; however, as soon as he saw the sand in Roman\u2019s eyes, he was speechless as if someone had sewed his mouth. Clearly, Roman was hit by the sand\u2014The foul also worked out successfully, but Roman did not close his eyes despite the stinging impact of sand hitting his eyes. He was only looking at his opponent clearly.The red eyes\u2014He should have closed them tightly and complained of pain, but when Lucas saw him, he noticed Roman was only waiting for him to rush toward him.At that moment,Thud.\u201c\u2026I surrender.\u201dLucas threw away his sword. Raising his hands, he announced he had no intention of fighting anymore. It was a quick abandonment\u2014He had only done it due to his experience on the battlefield.Also, Lucas\u2019 plan\u2014Roman already knew about it. Even though Roman saw him reaching into his pocket, he wanted Lucas to show him what he was capable of. Thus, he was hit with the sand. And despite the stinging shock, he looked straight at Lucas without closing his eyes.\u2018Never take your eyes off your opponent. That was something I learned when I was at the bottom of the Demonic Cult. The teaching was absolutely ingrained into the trainees\u2019 bones to the point where one\u2019s bones would hurt.\u2019He remembered the past\u2014The Demonic Cult\u2014While learning martial arts there, the first thing the trainees trained in was to not close their eyes, no matter the situation. A martial artist was, in the end, still a human being. And being blind was equivalent to being dead, so they were told not to close their eyes under any circumstances.A single blink can cost one\u2019s life.Just as the trainees exhaled breaths in a sequence while training in martial arts, even blinking eyes were performed through thorough calculations. The Demonic Cult\u2019s method was extremely cruel. Throwing sand in the trainees\u2019 eyes was just the basics. There was another way of stopping a blade just before one\u2019s eyes, as well. Obviously, sometimes accidents occurred. However, even when a trainee with a dagger in his eye screamed while kneeling on the floor with his head down and blood dripping from his face, the people training with him did not turn their attention.\u2014In the world of survival of the fittest, blood and screams were like everyday things. And knowing that the cost of the trainee\u2019s slight flinching was the direct cause of the accident, everyone only clenched their teeth and struggled not to move.That\u2014was how the Heavenly Demon was made.Lucas, I don\u2019t know how much blood you have seen on the battlefield, but the blood that I, as Baek Joong-hyuk, witnessed was enough to flow and make an ocean.Thud.\u201c\u2026I surrender.\u201dLucas surrendered. He threw away his sword and made it clear that he had no intention of fighting anymore. The test was now over. However, Lucas and the other volunteers only stood in place and watched, thinking that Lucas would be punished.\u2018If I had known something like this would happen, I wouldn\u2019t have even thought of using sand.\u2019Lucas\u2019 original plan was different.\u2014He was trying to get the result of \u2018Pass\u2019 by holding on for one minute, regardless of any means or method. However, in the end, he surrendered. Obviously, he knew how ugly this was\u2014Even if their necks were blown away, those who were called warriors did not dare to speak of surrender. Nevertheless, Lucas was not like that. He was a realist. Recognizing his last-ditch plan had utterly failed, he was momentarily overwhelmed by his opponent and surrendered.\u2018He must be disappointed in me. No, he probably didn\u2019t even expect anything great in the first place.\u2019\u2014He swallowed his saliva and awaited punishment.He might be mad at me or announce that I am eliminated in front of everyone.\u2014Lucas thought his greed had ruined the situation. However, he would still have made the same judgment if he could turn back time. Lucas was such a person. Seeing the blood on the frontlines, he lived without shame to survive in a place like that.However,\u201cNext.\u201dAt that moment, Lucas looked up at Roman with a bewildered expression. He did not get angry, nor did he ask why Lucas had committed the foul. The only word he said was \u2018Next\u2019\u2014That meant Lucas didn\u2019t do anything wrong and didn\u2019t need to be punished. Thus, even a B-class mercenary who had experienced many things in the world couldn\u2019t hide his bewildered expression due to Roman Dmitry.Flowering of mana is when one begins to feel mana and hence, can use it to create Aura.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35 - Recruitment (8)Published onJul 21, 2022\u202210 min read\u2022336 viewsThe last precedent was important.\u2014Those who watched Lucas\u2019 duel knew from that point onward that there was nothing wrong with committing a foul. And obviously, people did everything they could to survive one minute in the duel.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dThud.72nd duel\u2014The giant man screamed and swung his great sword. However, a big move could not work against Roman, and after his sword cut through the air, he picked up a stone from the ground and threw it toward Roman\u2019s face\u2014It was a surprise attack.Roman turned his head to the side to avoid the stone, and then he kicked the man, who was about to attack again, in the face.Smack!\u201cKeuk.\u201dHis blood spattered. Then, his pupils loosened, and he fell to the ground right on his face.\u201cNext.\u201dA foul was not a condition for elimination. However, the moment someone crossed the line, Roman ended them. In that respect, Lucas was clever\u2014If Lucas had not given up in the duel, Roman\u2019s sword might have broken his body.Naturally, the test continued.80th turn, 90th turn, and the 100th, as well\u2014Even though people kept changing, no one could hold out until the one minute Roman mentioned. From a certain moment, even those who were smiling at the rules of the second test looked at Roman with a shocked face. The current situation didn\u2019t make even a little bit of sense. Roman had spent over an hour fighting a hundred duels. Even though it would be natural if he had ragged breathing, Roman was still showing stable breathing as if he was fighting for the first time. His physical stress was not visible at all.Naturally, such a scene came as a horror to the applicants, and they couldn\u2019t even dare to think of winning now as they knew that the test would end soon.They didn\u2019t know about Roman\u2014He had created a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood.At the edge of death, no one shows you mercy. If you can\u2019t manage your breathing, your movements will naturally become sluggish, and then you will be just another corpse lying on the floor.That\u2019s why Baek Joong-hyuk learned how to fight till the end\u2014Breathe in and exhale\u2014The natural mana obtained through breathing in a continuous process circulated inside the body and properly got rid of the fatigue of the body.Roman\u2019s body is still weak.It was natural for 100 duels to be physically burdensome, but after taking proper care of the body, which had become stronger due to the body transformation, Roman proceeded with the duels as if he was fighting the first duel.This is a fight that does not use mana.\u2014As Baek Joong-hyuk, who fought for three days and three nights straight during the conquest of Murim, his stamina could not be exhausted by such a light battle. Honestly, the applicants were utterly wrong. They thought that delaying their turn would give them an advantage, but Roman did not falter even a bit\u2014Thus, the fear crushed their hearts.\u201cNext.\u201dThe last applicant\u2014It was the 120th duel. He went to the stage with a face that had already accepted defeat, and didn\u2019t even last ten seconds, let alone a minute\u2014as everyone expected. With a single blow, the applicant was on his knees. Seeing his wooden sword break with just a single strike, he voluntarily declared he would surrender.Now, the test was over. And when the 120th duel\u2019s conclusion was reached, people looked up at Roman bewilderedly. \u201c\u2026What the hell are we looking at?\u201d They couldn\u2019t understand it even after seeing it themselves. Roman Dmitry\u2014his change was beyond their comprehension.All tests have been completed. Nevertheless, defeat did not mean elimination. Chris sent all the desperate applicants back and announced that he would declare the results two days later.The next day, Roman handed over the list of successful applicants to Chris.\u201cThis is a list of successful applicants. From now on, you will take charge of these 30 people and conduct training.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dTap.He received a list. Then, as he turned the first page, he saw a familiar name.\u00a0\u2018He said his name was Volcan, right?\u2019\u2014He was the first challenger in the second test. He was a man who dared to take on a challenge but fell out at once. Although the content of the match was insignificant to most, he was still a person who had enough qualifications to enter the list of the 30 successful applicants.\u2018The master must have highly appreciated Volkan\u2019s courage. Even though it was clear as crystal that the 120th person would have an advantage, Volkan challenged him and attempted the first duel without hesitation. And he got destroyed. However, considering his courage and physical condition, he is an exceptionally talented person for a private soldier.\u2019Fwip.Chris turned the page. Most of them were understandable. Even if they couldn\u2019t show much performance against Roman, those with a strong will and satisfying conditions passed.And,\u2019\u2026Henderson?\u2019There were also unexpected people. Henderson was an ordinary person. He also managed to pass the first test, but he showed a passive attitude in the match with Roman and was eventually eliminated. So, Chris thought he would be eliminated. Unlike other successful applicants, he had a weak will and body, and there was no reason for him to be included in the list of successful applicants. Still, he accepted his master\u2019s decision. If it was the Roman that he experienced, he would have a reason for picking someone like him.However, when he looked at the next page, he had no choice but to ask a question\u2014\u201cLucas passed as well?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI admit that Lucas is a talented B-class mercenary and has enough qualifications. However, he is a cowardly and selfish person. Not only did he commit the foul of throwing a dagger and sprinkling sand during a test-purpose match, but when he thought he lost, he did not fight to the end and declared he would surrender. A person like that will be poison to us on the battlefield. He\u2019s a coward who will abandon his comrades. Can other soldiers trust Lucas and fight?\u201dLucas was a typical mercenary\u2014He was the kind of person who gave up his honor and did anything to survive. Obviously, Chris didn\u2019t like that. He had the honor of a knight, and if he had been in the position of Lucas as an applicant, he would not have cried out surrender even if he died. As Chris was the one who would take charge of the soldiers in the future, he wanted to exclude people like Lucas.Roman said, \u201cThat\u2019s why I passed him.\u201d\u201c\u2026What do you mean?\u201d\u201cAs you said, Lucas may be a cowardly guy who abandoned his comrades. However, in a situation where no one even thought of committing a foul, he was a guy who actually thought about how to deal with me and put it into practice. On the battlefield, those kinds of humans are the ones who shine instead. They\u2019ll always find a way to live and somehow open up a way for you. Is he a coward for doing what the others didn\u2019t? I never told anyone that foul play was not allowed. He has not done anything to make me lose my trust in him.\u201dChris was speechless. Obviously, Roman was right\u2014Lucas only thought realistically, and there was no basis for evaluating his personality yet.Suddenly, Chris remembered what his teacher, Jonathan, had told him.\u201cThe survivors on the battlefield are not knights who can use auras like you and me. At the borderline of death, where blood and screams are common, those who can always face the situation and judge it realistically can survive as human beings till the end. So, always keep that in mind, Chris. No matter how strong a swordsman you become in the future, there are always chances of you falling victim to humans who play dirty like hyenas.\u201dChris nodded. As Roman said, it was still too early to judge Lucas.However, he still had a question\u2014\u201cIs there any reason why you have specifically recruited 30 private soldiers this time? 30 people is not a small number, and managing them takes a lot of money and effort. Don\u2019t the Dmitrys also have soldiers and knights?\u201dChris\u2019 question was understandable. In the next 5 months, Roman would leave for the battlefield. However, that was the future, and there was no reason to prepare for that already. The central government was not a vicious group that recklessly drove the nobles to death just because they had conscripted them.Conscripted troops\u2014They were used in emergencies. They usually spend time in the waiting area just before the front line and take on the role of support when dangerous things happen. So, if one is lucky, they often end their military service without fighting a single battle. Roman also didn\u2019t know where he would be deployed, so he had no reason to nurture soldiers.Moreover, Dmitry was a fringe\u2014As it was an area where battles were not common, it was burdensome to maintain 30 people by giving 8 silvers per person from 5 months before the conscription.Chris\u2014He had served as the deputy commander-in-chief of the Dmitry Knights. As he managed people and knew a little bit of accounting, he realized that handling 30 people wasn\u2019t that simple. It was a question he would have naturally asked someday.Roman said, \u201cAs I announced in front of everyone, I have no intention of staying cooped up on the outskirts and watching from the sidelines. One by one\u2014I plan to climb up by stepping on the things I see in front of me one by one. So, who do you think my immediate enemy is as of now?\u201dThe first goal\u2014When Roman asked about it, Chris immediately thought of someone.\u00a0\u2018No way.\u2019\u00a0He didn\u2019t want to believe it.\u00a0I knew Roman had become aggressive, but I didn\u2019t know he had such dangerous thoughts.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dRoman\u2019s death\u2014The cause of that death.\u201cWe will prepare for the war against Barco from now on.\u201dThen, with the central government\u2019s approval, the Barco family officially issued a statement announcing the start of the war.\u201cWe believed in the promises of the past and waited for Lawrence\u2019s decision. However, they threw the honor of the nobility to the ground and betrayed our trust, and we decided to draw the sword after being patient for a long time. Lawrence\u2019s sin is clear. They did not repay the debt left by their ancestors and showed an attitude that they would not give up the land they had put as collateral. Therefore, through this statement, I will inform the people of the kingdom of Cairo. If Lawrence does not pay off their debts or give us the land that was pledged as collateral within the next week, the Barco family will declare a territorial war against Lawrence with the approval of the central government.\u201dA territorial war\u2014It was a fierce battle fighting for each other\u2019s things. By obtaining the central government\u2019s approval, the Barco family acquired the justification to declare war on the territory legally. In the aristocratic world, a cause was important\u2014With a cause, the nobles in the North-Eastern part of the kingdom of Cairo would stand by the war between the two.However, if Roman and Flora\u2019s marriage had not been broken, the Barco family might have moved a little more carefully. For descendants of two families to marry, it meant blood ties. In the world of aristocracy, blood ties gave a strong cause, so even Lawrence\u2019s problem would have been a strong cause to get involved.However, the marriage was called off. And from now on, it was Lawrence\u2019s turn to pay the price for a momentary mistake.\u201cI hope you will choose wisely. If you keep your inheritance and don\u2019t take this letter seriously, Barco\u2019s flag will soon be planted in the heart of Lawrence. We don\u2019t want war. However, please do not forget that it is Barco who, if necessary, will become bloodthirsty.\u201dIt was a one-sided notice. Finally, war was approaching.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36 - The Blacksmith's Furnace's Flame (1)Published onJul 22, 2022\u202211 min read\u2022164 viewsThe day Barco made their statement, Roman went to his father, and then, he said bluntly, \u201cThe war between Barco and Lawrence\u2014In that fight, I intend to intervene in the name of Roman Dmitry.\u201dBaron Romero\u2019s body stiffened as soon as he heard that. He, who had been drinking tea until just now, looked at Roman with fierce eyes.\u201cDo you know what that means?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDid you say that even after knowing that? The war between Barco and Lawrence is a legal battle that has been approved by the central government. If you had been married to Lawrence, you could have intervened in the war using your in-law\u2019s relationship as an excuse, but we have no justification for it now. If you are going to help Lawrence due to a simple change of heart, stop thinking of doing something that would harm our family.\u201dTap!He put down the teacup firmly\u2014A quivering beard revealed Baron Romero\u2019s anger.\u2018I thought you had matured due to your recent actions.\u2019Intervention in a war was not a simple matter. The central government is absolute in the kingdom of Cairo, and fighting without a cause is a shortcut that leads to hell. Such was the world of aristocracy. In the days when the Dmitrys were ordinary people, there was no problem acting as one felt rather than for a cause; however, now, it was not possible as they needed to manage and operate a single territory.If Roman did as he said, the moment he intervened in the war between Barco and Lawrence, the aristocrats in the North-East would cut off all exchanges with Dmitry at once, and in the worst case, the central government might send troops to subdue Dmitry.Still, maybe Dmitry\u2019s fame and wealth would prevent the situation from exacerbating, but even so, it was a risky choice.Roman said, \u201cFather, how do you want me to live in the future?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?!\u201d\u201cIt is not simply a matter of change of heart for me to intervene in Barco\u2019s war. I\u2019ve experienced some bad things lately. Anthony Barco, the eldest son of the Barco family, was jealous of me and Flora Lawrence\u2019s marriage and threatened me with an incident. There is no evidence to prove what happened that day to you, father. Nevertheless, I had this thought\u2014People say Dmitry is the real powerhouse of the North-East, but Barco thinks we are already under their feet.\u201dRoman\u2019s voice was absolutely calm. He spoke at a moderate pace and emphasized wherever necessary. It was bizarre\u2014His own son, Roman Dmitry, whom he had watched all his life, had reversed the situation in which he had just expressed his anger. The strange atmosphere tightened Baron Romero\u2019s heart.\u201cFather, you are a blacksmith. You seemingly wish to establish yourself as an aristocrat, but in fact, you possess much power and wealth and aren\u2019t doing anything. You must be satisfied with the present; however, I, your son, Roman Dmitry, am different. I wish for power, and I have no intention of bowing to anyone like Barco and tarnishing Dmitry\u2019s name in the future. There is enough reason to justify my actions. Just as Barco made a cause by themselves and declared war on the Lawrence territory, for those with power, the cause is just a game of words.\u201dHe looked up at his father. In his new life, he still felt like he was floating in the open sea. However, what was certain was that even in a situation where he did not know what to do, the identity of the person known as Baek Joong-hyuk was the same\u2014He must live a reigning life.He didn\u2019t look far\u2014Not to the end of the sea. He saw the enemy in front of him, like a shark that appeared right before him, and decided he would destroy them. He would tear off the shark\u2019s fin, and he would drink its flesh and blood; with that, he would prove that he is still alive.\u201cI am not asking you to let me borrow the power of the family. I\u2019m just telling my father my thoughts, hoping he\u2019ll understand what I\u2019m planning. I will intervene in the war not as the eldest son of the Dmitry family but for my personal reasons as Roman Dmitry. What I am showing you now is how I must live my life.\u201dIt was a one-sided notice. He didn\u2019t even want his father\u2019s support. However, he knew he needed tacit consent at least.Roman knew the truth that his own strength came from Dmitry, and he did not try to ignore the truth. He admitted it and wanted to make the most of what he had. Thus, he needed the consent of his father, Romero Dmitry.\u201c\u2026Hmmm.\u201dBaron Romero looked embarrassed. His sore thumb, Roman, was growing rapidly day by day. With Roman\u2019s longing eyes staring straight into his own eyes, Baron Romero knew it was a problem he couldn\u2019t control.Roman has bloomed. Although he was earlier known as Dmitry\u2019s Fool and lived like a dog, he has finally realized that he was born as a beast. Honestly, I myself dreamed that one day this moment would come.\u2014Baron Romero himself was born lowly. In the end, he wanted his sons to go beyond the limits of their status, unlike himself, who was content with a small territory. In the room, silence lingered for quite a while.Finally, Baron Romero, who was looking at Roman silently, said with a determined expression\u2014\u201cDo as you will. And if there\u2019s anything I can help with, just tell me. You are my son, and I, Romero Dmitry, am the father of Roman Dmitry. No matter what you do, you are not fully responsible for it.\u201dThat was enough. Eventually, his father gave Roman what he wanted.Originally, Roman didn\u2019t need his father\u2019s help. He planned to do things on his own, as planned, but he only needed one thing if he got the help\u2014weapons to arm his soldiers.Roman had 30 private soldiers.I can\u2019t just push them into battle naked.All material things, such as the salary paid to his soldiers, came from his father, so he spoke frankly about what he wanted.Alright, father said he would be happy to help.\u201cGo to Hendrick, the master of the forge. If you say this is my request, he will support you with anything you say you need.\u201dMaster Blacksmith\u2014It was the symbol of the Dmitry family. In the past, Baron Romero was the master of the smithy, handling all major issues, but Hendrick, with whom he worked earlier, succeeded him when he received the title of nobility. Hendrick was a well-known craftsman in Cairo. Therefore, as the master blacksmith of the Dmitry family, he oversaw all iron crafting. He was also a man Roman had always wanted to meet.As soon as Roman left, he headed straight to the forge, and soon after, he heard a familiar sound.Kaang!Kang! Kang!Dmitry\u2019s forge\u2014It was a space where a fire was visible both day and night. The blacksmiths of the smithy smashed the metal while their forearms wriggled with muscles, and the scenery spread endlessly everywhere.Dmitry\u2019s forge was the largest in the kingdom of Cairo\u2014A workshop where several blacksmiths can work simultaneously is classified as one, and there were as many as 30 such workshops in a space called Blacksmith\u2019s Street. It was truly incredible. As to how Dmitry was able to amass enormous wealth, the question was immediately resolved by looking at this space.\u2018The reason Dmitry is strong is that their wealth comes from their skills. The iron mine behind the estate has the largest reserves in the kingdom, and Dmitry\u2019s blacksmiths have the technology to sell the iron they mine at a high price. That\u2019s why the nobles in the North-Eastern part of Cairo\u2019s kingdom never tried to fight Dmitry. Aside from being afraid of Dmitry\u2019s wealth, if Dmitry\u2019s iron weapons would not be supplied in the kingdom of Cairo, that will be a fatal problem in itself.\u2019Step.Some blacksmiths saw the figure of Roman\u2014Dmitry\u2019s eldest son had appeared at the forge, but no one wanted to greet Roman first. It wasn\u2019t a matter of reputation. Regarding this, Baron Romero had something to say.\u201cSon, Dmitry\u2019s blacksmiths are extremely proud of themselves. They aren\u2019t the sort of people who will show blind loyalty just because you\u2019re born with Dmitry\u2019s surname. Only those who know about blacksmithing can earn the respect of the blacksmiths.\u201dFor that reason, Roman\u2019s brothers lived in the forge. In particular, the second son was greedy for succession and so passionate that he said he would go to the master and learn the techniques himself.On the contrary, obviously, while Roman was alive, he didn\u2019t even come near the forge. Working with iron and crafts while sweating was hard work, and it was not desirable for a nobleman who only wanted pleasure.The blacksmiths\u2019 cold reactions were expected. Regardless, Roman walked without saying a word, and finally, he arrived at the target space.Clack.\u201cDid you come to see me?\u201dHendrick\u2014A dark-faced and middle-aged man looked outside with a sweaty face. When he confirmed that his guest was Roman, he distorted his expression.\u201cWhy did you come here?\u201dHendrick, the master of the forge, judged humans into two classes\u2014Someone he likes, someone he doesn\u2019t like. And, obviously, Roman Dmitry was included in the latter category and also as a \u2018very disliked guy\u2019.\u2018What is this guy doing here?\u2019Once, there was a time when Roman was brought to the forge by his father. Even then, Hendrick had been eager to teach Romero\u2019s eldest son, but he eventually got fed up with Roman\u2019s daily complaining and whining about not wanting to do dirty work. Still, if things had ended like that, he wouldn\u2019t have hated him, but there was one decisive incident that stuck out in Hendrick\u2019s eyes.One day, Roman was in need of money. As his father had banned him from receiving an allowance, he secretly went to a blacksmith\u2019s forge to earn money for entertainment. And after stealing the sword Hendrick had worked so hard for, which looked the best in Roman\u2019s eyes, he sold it to a street vendor at a bargained price.Obviously, for Hendrick, it was natural to be angry. That day, Hendrick beat Roman mercilessly in front of Baron Romero, and at that time, even Baron Romero also stood by and allowed him to hit his eldest son. From that day onward, Roman became the object of loathing for Hendrick, and he hated even talking to him.Hendrick, of course, did not show a good attitude at Roman\u2019s request for 30 soldiers\u2019 equipment.\u201cThere in the corner\u2014Take some equipment from there. That will be enough for arming 30 men.\u201dAt the corner of the forge, there were piles of weapons and armour.\u2018Just because they\u2019re made of the same iron doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re all good weapons and armour. Those are failure pieces made by apprentice blacksmiths, but Roman Dmitry doesn\u2019t have an eye for good iron anyway. He\u2019s a dumb guy who will like them.\u2019He knew it was Baron Romero\u2019s request. However, he still didn\u2019t want to do anything good for Roman. Still regretting the day when he lost his masterpiece, he again wanted to slap Roman\u2019s cheek.And due to that, handing over the garbage was the best thing he could do for Roman\u2014Because he was Romero\u2019s son, this was the best he could do for Roman.\u201cAre you telling me to take those?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dRoman looked at the condition of the items. In Hendrick\u2019s opinion, he didn\u2019t even need to look closely. If it was the Roman he remembered, there would have been no problem, but the perspective of Roman, who contained the soul of Baek Joong-hyuk, was different.Roman said, \u201cMy father told me to go get some good weapons and armour to arm my soldiers with. However, is this Master Hendrick\u2019s best?\u201d\u201cBest, my ass. If you\u2019re not satisfied with that, get out of the forge right now!\u201d\u201cMaster Hendrick.\u201dClack.Roman picked up a sword. Then, he shone its blade in the sky, looked straight at Hendrick, and said, \u201cIt seems that the reputation of Dmitry\u2019s ironwork being the best in Cairo is a myth. I can\u2019t believe you even considered allowing soldiers to wear such garbage. Let me ask you again\u2014Is this really your best, Master Hendrick?\u201dAn intense reaction\u2014That was a scenario Hendrick couldn\u2019t have expected in a thousand years.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37 - The Blacksmith's Furnace's Flame (2)Published onJul 25, 2022\u202210 min read\u2022420 viewsGarbage\u2014At the remark that touched the pride of the craftsman, Hendrick\u2019s eyebrows rose sharply.\u201cThe ironwork from Dmitry is arguably the highest quality in the kingdom of Cairo. But you, who doesn\u2019t even know how a blacksmith works, and has never sweated in front of a hot oven, dare judge the ironwork of Dmitry?!\u201d\u2014His voice rose. The things that Roman evaluated\u2014by Dmitry\u2019s standards, they are indeed garbage that cannot even be treated as low-rank armour and weapons. However, he just didn\u2019t like that the remarks came from Roman.In Hendrick\u2019s memory, Roman was an incorrigible human, so his face flushed red due to his personal feelings.\u201cIf it had not been for the request of your father, Baron Romero, I would not have given you anything, Roman Dmitry. You are the eldest son of the Dmitry family, who have made blacksmithing a lifelong business. When your younger brother, Rodwell Dmitry, worked for me for years and took over the chores, you went out on the road, coveting the white-skinned women and wasting your time. Do you know what that means? Being even worse than those things on the floor, Roman Dmitry, you are the garbage that cannot be fixed. They may be of poor quality, but if they find an owner, they will do their job, but as the eldest son of the Dmitry family, you are garbage, unable to do anything.\u201dIt was a bittersweet rant. Dmitry\u2019s roots were in the forge\u2014The family\u2019s eldest son, who denied them and neglected them, could not earn the respect of the workers who worked hard to build the family.\u2018Is this the case again?\u2019Hendrick\u2014It was the first time he had seen him. This is a face that Baek Joong-hyuk does not have in his memory, but he was voicing anger towards Roman Dmitry based on his own experience, not his prejudice. At his point, he was used to it. It didn\u2019t take long for him to understand Roman Dmitry, but no one showed friendly feelings toward him from the start, wherever he met anyone.Only one person\u2014Only Hans was an exception. Hans was devoted to Roman, so he brought him into his fence for no particular reason.\u2018It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t understand Hendrick\u2019s reaction. If the eldest son of Dmitry was not interested in the smithy, but he came to me when he had a purpose like this and evaluated him, it\u2019s natural to have bad feelings.\u2019Roman understood the other person\u2019s thoughts and the other person\u2019s heart. Hendrick\u2019s anger was quite natural, but there was one thing that bothered Roman, who faced his anger.\u2014\u2018Master Blacksmith. The real power of Dmitry and the craftsman who oversees the blacksmith. He deserves respect, but it\u2019s a different story when you look at the current situation. He\u2019s not denying that the things I\u2019ve evaluated are garbage; he\u2019s angry because the one who evaluated them was Roman Dmitry.\u2019Keeping Hendrick and Roman aside, the current circumstances were a separate issue.Clack.Roman picked up the sword that was lying on the floor. Then, he walked outside and shined the sword in the sun.\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t understand your wrath, Master Hendrick. However, in the process of making this sword, the power transmission was so uneven that different shades could be seen just by shining the sun on it. It is probably the result of an inexperienced blacksmith messing with hammering. Therefore, it cannot be said that this is Dmitry\u2019s iron. You cannot deny that fact, so you chose to criticize me instead of proving me wrong, didn\u2019t you, Master Hendrick?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2014!\u201d\u201cMaster Hendrick.\u201d\u2014Roman cut him off.Roman swung the sword in the air a few times, then looked at Hendrick with a hardened expression on his face.\u201cJust now, my soldier, who couldn\u2019t cut the enemy\u2019s flesh with this garbage sword, died. Due to the uneven surface of the blade, the flesh could not be cut cleanly, and the soldier who could not pull out the sword stuck in the enemy\u2019s muscle was blown away by their sword with a bewildered expression. How embarrassing is that? He did his best to survive, but he had to die because the garbage Master Hendrick gave him was a trash weapon.\u201dClang!Roman threw away the sword. This time he picked up an armour and showed it to Hendrick.\u201cWhy do you think people wear armour, Master Hendrick? If one can protect themself from the enemy\u2019s attacks even once, the armour is worth its hefty weight. However, a soldier wearing this chain mail which I supplied was betrayed by the armour he trusted and was killed. He believed that the tightly intertwined pieces of iron would protect his body, but the experimental work made by an unknown blacksmith could not stop the enemy\u2019s attack. His flesh was pierced, holes were made, and his guts spilt through the chainmail.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?!\u201d\u201cYou still don\u2019t understand what I am saying?\u201dPeople\u2019s prejudice? Roman understood that. As the previous owner lived like garbage, he was aware that he had to endure their prejudice. However, Hendrick had crossed the line. Due to his personal feelings, he didn\u2019t realize what he had actually done.\u201cI asked you for weapons and armour to arm my soldiers, Master Hendrick. If I hadn\u2019t noticed that the rubbish lying on the floor was trash, the soldiers who followed me might have entrusted their lives to these pieces of trash without knowing anything. This is not simply a matter of retaliation for personal feelings. It is a problem that would have cost the lives of 30 people, and you turned away from the truth even though you were aware of that fact, Master Hendrick. If that happened, could you still proudly call yourself Master Blacksmith, the craftsman representing Dmitry? Because of your personal feelings toward me, innocent people almost died!\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dHendrick was perplexed. Roman\u2019s speech was absolutely correct. However, Hendrick hadn\u2019t even thought of the situation like that. He simply didn\u2019t want to give Roman anything good, and he didn\u2019t know that soldiers would die due to that.\u201cTh-That wasn\u2019t my intention!\u201d\u201cYour intentions don\u2019t matter. Weapons and armour have a clear purpose, and anyone can predict what the consequences will be when they give out garbage. That was why I asked not in the name of Roman Dmitry but in the name of my father, Baron Romero. I asked for the best weapons and armour possible; however, what you gave me is this garbage you see right now.\u201dClang.Roman pushed away the iron pieces scattered on the floor with his feet. Hendrik realized what kind of mistake he had made at the sight of the sliding iron pieces.\u201cYour actions\u2014May I take them as a protest against my father?\u201dProtest\u2014Hearing that, for a moment, Hendrick felt his mind collapse. For the line that Roman thought of, Hendrick\u2019s attitude didn\u2019t matter. Master Blacksmith was on the same level as the eldest son of the Dmitry family. He thought that Roman crossed the line when he called the equipment trash; however, Roman respected Hendrick. He was a hard worker, and he needed to build a friendly relationship with him if he considered his future in the family.Nevertheless,\u201cI know what Master Hendrick thinks of me. I think you simply didn\u2019t want to give me good equipment and are not protesting against my father. The problem is\u2014that in itself is insubordination. Master Hendrick, I got permission from my father and came to see the master. It is not a personal request, but the owner of this land has ordered you to provide good weapons and armour for me.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon, Baek Joong-hyuk, had always lived his life as a ruler\u2014He, who ruled over different types of humans, always adhered to only one principle in any situation\u2014\u2019Hierarchy\u2014The moment the line between the master and the servant becomes ambiguous, the hierarchy and order are destroyed due to that single relationship.\u2019A faithful servant, and even servants who were like a friend\u2014The moment they crossed the line, Baek Joong-hyuk gave them a harsh punishment with a cold expression. He was no different today. Even though he knew how important Hendrick was, Roman told the truth to the other person the moment he crossed the line. He tapped Hendrick\u2019s head and pressed it down.\u201cI will ask you again. What you did to me\u2014Should I take that as a protest against my father?\u201d\u201c\u2026What do you mean \u2018a protest\u2019?! Absolutely not!\u201dHendrick exclaimed in anguish. He had worked for several decades before earning the title of Master Blacksmith. He was a friend of Baron Romero before he even became the owner of the Dmitry house. Once upon a time, they blazed with passion on the hearth. Hendrick truly respected Romero Dmitry. Now, he doesn\u2019t hear much about the blacksmith because of his duties as a nobleman, but Baron Romero is undoubtedly Cairo\u2019s best craftsman, recognized by even Hendrick. Hendrick swore allegiance to him. He thought that if it was Baron Romero, who was genuinely understanding and considerate of the blacksmiths, he was worthy of swearing allegiance.Just then, the blacksmiths around the castle gathered around Roman. They couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on at first, but their expressions turned harsh at Roman\u2019s subsequent remarks.\u201cIf it is not a protest, explain yourself. Why did you give me these things?\u201d\u201cThis bastard.\u201d\u201cHow dare you talk to Master Hendrick like that?!\u201dNaturally, the blacksmiths were furious. At the scene of a small kid scolding Master Hendrick, their anger exploded. The blacksmiths showed the attitude to attack him at any moment. Obviously, when a dozen men with great physiques surrounded Roman, the atmosphere became harsh, and the situation became one that would likely lead to violence.There is a saying in the world\u2014Even a vicious group like Blood Fang wouldn\u2019t dare touch Dmitry\u2019s blacksmiths.\u2014As a blacksmith is a strong worker and often handles weapons such as knives, there have been cases in which certain organizations have collapsed because of an argument over nothing.Nevertheless, seeing the current situation, Roman\u2019s attitude was calm. He was neither embarrassed nor sensitive to the blacksmiths\u2019 threats. He just looked at Hendrick. Looking forward to his answer, the blacksmiths\u2019 patience reached its limit.\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on right now, but I can\u2019t watch Dmitry\u2019s Fool dare to confront the master anymore.\u201d\u201cSubdue him at once!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dHendrick was like heaven to them.Seeing the blacksmiths rushing in at once, Hendrick, who had been consistent with his silence, finally opened his mouth.\u201cStop!\u201d\u201c\u2026Master!\u201d\u201cI told you to stop.\u201dHendrick\u2019s expression hardened. He could not comprehend the current situation. The Roman he remembered was utterly different. He didn\u2019t have the guts to argue with someone like Hendrick. Moreover, if it was the old Roman, in a situation where the blacksmiths were threatening him, he wouldn\u2019t even have the courage to keep his back straight before them. However, the Roman in front of him was bold. Even though the blacksmiths were on the verge of attacking, Roman was looking straight at him without taking a step back.\u2018One thing is certain.\u2019Hendrick said, \u201cSorry. This is entirely my mistake.\u201dWhen asked if he was protesting, Hendrick had no choice but to back off.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38 - The Blacksmith's Furnace's Flame (3)Why did Hendrick back off? It wasn\u2019t just because the cost of protesting was scary. He\u2019s Hendrick Egan, who adhered to what he thought was right, but now, he realized what mistake he had made.\u2018Hendrick\u2026 Oh, Hendrick. What the hell have you done?\u2019At that moment, old memories flooded back into his mind. Hendrick, who is currently known as Master Blacksmith, also had a time when he was just an apprentice. At that time, just like in the current circumstances, he chose to make a living rather than cling to his sense of duty as a blacksmith, and he worked day and night in order to establish himself as a decent blacksmith as soon as possible. Naturally, he got a beating. Dmitry has now abolished his past bad habits, but the bruises never faded from his body when Hendrick was learning to work.One day, a mercenary came to the forge. The mercenary, who had just started to get out into the real world, brought only 1 silver and asked the blacksmith to sell him a sword. He said, \u201cI am well aware that it is not enough money to buy a good sword. However, this is all my possessions, and if you sell me the sword, I promise to pay it back tenfold later. I have a family to support. All I have is a strong body, so I need a weapon to make money.\u201dIt was actually common\u2014Those with neither land to farm nor special talents believed only in their one body and jumped into the mercenary work. The current situation was the same case. However, the master of the smithy was not compassionate enough to give a sword to a man he had never seen before, so he spat bitter swear words at the mercenary and drove him out of the smithy.At that time, the back of the mercenary was truly miserable. Hendrick couldn\u2019t stand still as he looked at the slumped shoulders carrying the burden of his family on his shoulders. Secretly, Hendrick followed the mercenary. Then, without asking for anything in return, he gave him the first sword he had made without his master\u2019s knowledge. Back then, he was happy. Seeing the mercenary shed tears and express his gratitude, Hendrick thought that this might be the true happiness of being a blacksmith.It was that moment when he was proud of his job for the first time, and Hendrick, who returned to the forge, immersed himself in his work with the thought of making a better sword. However, after 1 month, when he faced the mercenary\u2019s corpse, Hendrick felt his world collapse. Behind the family\u2019s cries, people talked about why the mercenary died.\u201cThis time, he was on a top escort mission and died. Poor guy. If only his sword had not broken in the process of dealing with the bandits, he would have been able to come back alive just like the other guys. That\u2019s why one should use good weapons.\u201d\u201cI know. Everyone else is fine, but only he was dead, right?\u201dHearing that, Hendrick\u2019s heart sank. His hands and feet began to tremble. What he thought was a good deed had taken a mercenary\u2019s life. Then, a strange feeling arose within him. It was only then that he understood why his master had said it was too early for him to make swords; however, no matter how quickly he regretted it, he could not turn back the reality in front of his eyes.Due to that, Hendrik lived as a poor man for a while. Without the help of his close friend, Baron Romero, he would not have been able to return to the forge. Due to that pain, Hendrick vowed never to repeat something like that again, and he was able to overcome such a painful past and grow into a Master Blacksmith.However, he made the same mistake now as he did back then. Hendrick, for a moment, forgot his past mistake and repeated the mistake he regretted countless times just because he didn\u2019t like Roman.\u2018It\u2019s really pathetic.\u2019No excuse could work in the current situation. For whatever reason, as Roman pointed out, he nearly killed an innocent person with the rubbish he handed over. He took back what he said. He made no excuses.If Roman punishes me, whether that is the price of protest or some other punishment, I will humbly accept it.\u201cI will pay for my actions.\u201d\u201cMaster!\u201dAt Hendrick\u2019s words, the blacksmiths tried to stop him with bewildered faces. They could not accept the current situation. Hendrick was their everything, and Roman was not Baron Romero, so he could not be punished directly by Roman Dmitry or anything like that.Roman held the hilt. Hendrick looked up at Roman\u2019s face, waiting for his punishment. At that moment, his eyes met Roman\u2019s eyes.\u201cIf you are so sorry for your mistake, I will not question you anymore. Let\u2019s get back to the basics. I know that Master Hendrick is a great blacksmith. Therefore, I would like some equipment to arm 30 soldiers.\u201dRoman\u2019s words were truly unexpected. Hearing them, Hendrick\u2019s pupils shook wildly. He was an outrageous guy. He acted like he would bring severe punishment down on the master, but when given a chance, he showed mercy.Roman understood Hendrick\u2014He understood how difficult it was for him to admit his mistake in front of his followers. Roman truly understood his position.\u2018Anyone can make mistakes. At the very least, if the mistake is something that can be compensated for, an act of repentance will give them another chance.\u2019Punishing his own beloved servant only happened when the actions of the said servant were severe. However, it was different from now. Hendrick was a man with a bad relationship with Roman, and he only took timid revenge, not thinking about what will happen due to his own judgment. If he didn\u2019t show any remorse, Roman could call it malice, but at least Hendrick knew what was right and what was wrong.\u2018Penalty and punishment should not contain emotion.\u2019That was Baek Joong-hyuk\u2019s iron rule, and he always acted according to the iron rule.Roman said, \u201cAs I said before, I don\u2019t think Master Hendrick was intentionally trying to protest. Perhaps it\u2019s because of the antipathy towards me, and I fully understand that feeling. So, I want us to put our mistakes aside. All I want is swords and armours that will protect the lives of my soldiers.\u201dIt was like a stick and a carrot. After swinging his stick until Hendrick\u2019s skin was reddened, Roman presented the carrot with clever eloquence.Seeing Roman\u2019s attitude, Hendrick was amazed again.\u2018Roman has changed.\u2019He had heard rumours. In particular, he was aware to some extent of the reputation around him because he had really changed due to this enlistment recruitment. However, seeing it in person was different. Hendrick, who had been ignoring the truth, had only now seen the true face of Roman. It was different from before.Roman, who had dirty and clouded eyes, became a strong man, and the charisma that came from his sharp eyes made Hendrick\u2019s heart tremble.It\u2019 wasn\u2019t just that Roman changed his appearance. It was to the extent that he could be considered a completely different person; Roman was different from his past appearance in every aspect.How is this possible? Obviously, there are traces of Roman, who was known as Dmitry\u2019s fool, but he cannot be called that anymore.Hendrick\u2019s prejudice was stripped away. He acknowledged Roman\u2014Roman had changed, and today\u2019s incident was his own fault. He regretted it countless times in the past, and he could not tolerate that he gave garbage equipment to Roman because of his personal feelings.Hendrick said, \u201c\u2026Once again, I\u2019m really sorry about this. In the future, no matter what happens, I will not repeat this kind of thing. And as an apology, I will prepare weapons and armour for your soldiers with the finest iron Dmitry is proud of.\u201dAfter all the chaos was over, Roman decided to pick up the goods later and left the forge. In the process, he listened to Hendrick\u2019s circumstances through another blacksmith.\u201cThe sword Young Master Roman stole that day was a masterpiece made by Master Hendrick. It took six months to come up with it, and it was a masterpiece he barely finished while living in the blacksmith for a whopping three months. However, the young master sold it to a street vendor at a bargain price, so it was natural for him to be angry. What really upset Master Hendrick was that rather than the fact that Young Master Roman stole it and sold it, the masterpiece he had created could not be found and was sold at a low price.\u201dNow, Roman understood. Why was Hendrick angry? What was the reason for doing what he did to Roman even though he knew it was against the spirit of craftsmanship? Roman from the previous life has crossed the line. It was an unforgivable mistake. Maybe that\u2019s why, before he left for the last time, Hendrick said to Roman, \u201cI have not completely forgiven you for this. I will grant your request because I was wrong, but I still cannot tolerate the neglect of the Dmitry family\u2019s eldest son in the forge\u2019s work. Keep in mind\u2014Dmitry\u2019s roots lie in the forge. In the future, if the day comes when you can make even a single piece of garbage with your own hands, that might be an opportunity when I see you in a new light.\u201dHendrick was stubborn. Although he said that this incident had removed a layer of prejudice, he did not recognize Roman as Dmitry\u2019s successor. Nevertheless, even Hendrick had one misjudgment.\u2019The Roman Dmitry Hendrick remembers must have been a fool who had no interest in the smithy\u2014Garbage that ignores the roots of the family and enjoys only pleasure. It\u2019s completely understandable why Dmitry\u2019s people hate him. However.\u2019Baek Joong-hyuk was different.\u201cFrom now on, shall we prepare for dispatch?\u201dRoman took a step. For this outing, one more purpose remained.The place where Roman arrived was a workshop where he initially practised. The workshop, which was old and shabby back then, was neatly organized enough to be able to work right now. Immediately after he decided to go to war, Roman told Hans to make it usable for its original purpose.\u201cLong time no see.\u201dClack.He walked inside and checked his surroundings. It was a nice place. The ceilings were high, ventilation was good, and the lighting properly separated the areas to be lit and those to be darkened. For a blacksmith, ventilation was essential.The smoke and dust from the coal fire obstructed the view, so ventilation was the first priority when checking a suitable forge place.After that, Roman saw familiar things\u2014A furnace for heating, an anvil that looks cold and heavy and the oak pedestal that supports it, hammers and tongs and so on. It was something he had seen in Hendrick\u2019s workspace, but for Roman, the present moment was special.\u2018The first day comes back to my mind.\u2019The day I started my life as a Roman.Listening to Dmitry\u2019s history in a shabby shack, Roman thought that maybe this was his fate. The Heavenly Demon, Baek Joong-hyuk\u2014In the history of Murim, he was simply described as the strongest in the world, but those who were even a little interested in him knew a different side of Baek Joong-hyuk. He was exactly what a blacksmith looked like. Right after Baek Joong-hyuk made up his mind to go to the army, he always came to the blacksmiths\u2019 forge to perform his own rituals.In a life of struggle\u2014to survive, to win, and to rule\u2014Baek Joong-hyuk expressed his own soul in front of the hot flames.Fwoosh.Crackle crackle.The furnace heated up, and flames arose from within. From now on, it was his turn to make a sword for himself, preparing for the war in the future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39 - The Blacksmith's Furnace's Flame (4)Published onJul 27, 2022\u202210 min read\u2022426 viewsThe reason Baek Joong-hyuk decided to make his own sword came from an incident that happened when he was 18.At a time when the successor of the Demonic Sect was not yet decided, and Baek Joong-hyuk was spending his days drained in the conflict of his siblings\u2014Unlike his other brothers, he had no one to protect him, so he often spent up nights staying awake due to the assassination attempts which happened to him.And one day, a guest came in the middle of the night\u2014His 11th brother.Baek Chang-hyun attempted to kill his own brother. Thus, the battle between the brothers who shared blood began in the middle of the night.It was a tough fight\u2014Baek Chang-hyun was a person who passed the ordeal in the cave, and even in the bloody situation, he was stubbornly attacking the vital points of Baek Joong-hyuk.The physical difference between the brothers was tremendous. Baek Chang-hyun was the firstborn child, so he had physical superiority over Baek Joong-hyuk. And the attack of the elder broke the sword of Baek Joong-hyuk.Crack.With one hit, Baek Joong-hyuk\u2019s chest was cut with the sword. Naturally, blood splashed out.The moment when the fear of death approached Baek Joong-hyuk, he gave up on his life and slashed the opponent in the face with the broken sword.The momentary joy of winning\u2014As Baek Chang-hyun\u2019s face, filled with joy, turned to shock, Baek Joong-hyuk took his opponent\u2019s life.That day, Baek Joong-hyuk thought\u2014He needed his own sword. He wanted a sword that would never break in the middle of a battle and would fully help utilize his current physical abilities. From that day onward, Baek Joong-hyuk turned into a righteous man who dealt with his 11th brother and learned the art of making swords by visiting the blacksmiths, unlike his other siblings. And always, when the moment of decisive battle came up, he went and made a sword suitable for him.A sword helps elevate the physical condition or any condition of its wielder by realizing complex things like physical characteristics and preferred sword technique. Like that, decades had passed. Baek Joong-hyuk had risen to the top position of the Demonic Sect and fought thousands of battles in the process of unifying Murim. Every year, Baek Joong-hyuk\u2019s sword changed too. Each time Baek Joong-hyuk made a new sword, he would pass the old one to his subordinates, and from a certain point onward, the 39 swords he gave were handed down to generations and were known as \u201cThe Swords of Heavenly Demon.\u201dA priceless treasure\u2014The moment a sword of the Heavenly Demon was released in Murim, battles ensued between those who wished to be its owner. It could be said that Baek Joong-hyuk\u2019s ability to make the sword had developed a lot over his lifetime, and he could be called an expert craftsman.The act of making a sword\u2014Baek Joong-hyuk was familiar with it.And now, Roman was preparing for his battle with Barco.Furnace; First sword\u2014Roman, as Baek Joong-hyuk, performed the ceremony for it.The Forge of Resistance\u2014In the space where no footsteps were heard for quite a while, the sound of firmly knocking on the steel could be heard.Kang!Sparks flew off. Roman, who struck the red-hot steel, performed the same thing over and over again with the same force and at constant intervals. Normal people would find it boring\u2014In a space where only the burning sound from the furnace and the sound of a hammer hitting the steel was heard, Roman was sweating.Kang!Kang! Kang!In a state of trance\u2014Roman loved the moment he was driven for a single purpose.At first, the metal will be nothing, but with repeated actions, a wonderful sword will be born.His past subordinates had a hard time understanding this behavior of Baek Joong-hyuk. There were swords in the warehouse; he could pick any of them and use them. Rather than spending time on making the sword, they thought it would be beneficial to hone his skills.They weren\u2019t utterly wrong. However, Baek Joong-hyuk went beyond making simple swords, and now he looked back on himself.\u2018What did I live for?\u2019The purpose of his life\u2014Even after accomplishing everything he wanted to, he couldn\u2019t realize it. Since he had the Heavenly Demon as his father, he had to live in a world of violence from a young age.He didn\u2019t think it was a bad thing.Humans never live their lives the way they plan them out, but they create their stories based on their instincts.It was the same now. Although Roman\u2019s life is much unfamiliar, Baek Joong-hyuk\u2019s actions remained faithful to his past.What he saw in front of him\u2014He accepted this new life.The subjugation of the threat of Blood Fang; in order to clear up the affair with Anthony Barco, he was now preparing a sword himself\u2014Baek Joong-hyuk\u2014It was his life. For the sole purpose of simply reigning, he was faithful to this reality in front of him.\u2018My current state isn\u2019t at a level where I can jump into a fight with too many variables. With the Body Reconstruction1, I was able to use the first three forms of the Heavenly Demon Sword Art as I entered the state of Human, but in this world of Roman, there will be many variables that I am not aware of. Therefore, I have to train myself harder. The world I don\u2019t know, the enemies I do not know of\u2014So no matter what happens, I will have to be the winner.\u2019Being a predator, defeat was unacceptable\u2014In the world of the survival of the fittest, defeat is death. Thus, Baek Joong-hyuk will be the predator.Kang!A strong shock\u2014Roman\u2019s face was drenched in sweat from the heat in the forge, and his muscles could be seen glowing red as if they consisted of lava. This was a unique sight\u2014Normal blacksmiths usually wear protective gear on their bodies. Understandably, it is to protect their body from this scorching heat inside the furnace and also to protect the body from the hot flames of pieces of steel that might jump up from the hammering.Hendrick was the same. He came to the shop and got ready to work like that, but Roman was now hammering the steel in front of the flames and wasn\u2019t wearing anything other than trousers.Obviously, he knew it too\u2014This was dangerous.However, making a sword was another way for Baek Joong-hyuk to not only make suitable weapons for himself but practice martial arts simultaneously.Crackle!Wheikkk!The flames continued to burn. The suffocating heat was hard to accept, but Roman, who had continued to take deep breaths, made his body accustomed to it.Infernal God Art.Instantly, Roman\u2019s body was engulfed in flames.\u00a0The usage of the martial arts which controls fire, a martial arts of a demon who was called Infernal Demon2.\u2014In the common sense of the world, two different kinds of Mental Methods cannot exist at once.It is common knowledge that people who use the Heavenly Demon God Art cannot use the Infernal God Art. However, Baek Joong-hyuk was a Heavenly Demon who had raised his affinity to all attributes to the limit. As a result, it was possible for them to coexist while taking a toll on the body. The Heavenly Demon God Art took place in the dantian and took control of everything, and even if other attributes entered the body from the outside, nothing horrifying would happen.Coexistence\u2014Roman absorbed it. He gradually took the heat rising up around into his dantian so that it could nourish him.\u2018The training of the Infernal God Art is rather the best one out there. If it is used frequently, though, it will damage the internal organs along with the lungs, but now that everything has been prepared in the same way as the past, my body can withstand the flames in here.\u2019Kaang!Kaang! Kanng!He swung the hammer again. For the act of making the sword, facing the flame in the hearth, Roman calmly and meticulously began to examine his body condition\u2014The extension of the arm, the strength used, the amount of qi being used\u2014As he calmly checked the state, he thought of the shape he wanted the sword to take. The sword made with sweat pouring down like rain cannot be used for more than 2 years. Thus, a shape suitable just for him. Also, Roman thought 2 years was a good enough time for a sword.At the same time, mana moved in the dantian.The enemies he recognized till now\u2014Considering the size of Barco and the mercenaries they hired, actually, even with his current level, it wasn\u2019t a problem for him. However, variables are invisible to naked eyes.Obviously, the scale of Barco that the Intelligence Guild found out was rather normal, but it was impossible to fully understand what preparation they had done in the process of conquering Lawrence.Murim always spoke about hiding the main skills. In a world where all kinds of people run rampant, fully revealing one\u2019s skill was a shortcut to our death.Barco\u2014They, too, must have hidden something, and Roman knew such a variable could cost his life. Thus, he hoped for the strength to oppose such variables.In the process of subjugating the Murim, the brains of the Jegal family\u2019s head put Baek Joong-hyun into a corner due to the variables that man created. Nevertheless, with overwhelming force, he overpowered him. When one doesn\u2019t fully understand the opponent\u2019s power, having enough power to overpower or prevent the variables often works.\u2018I haven\u2019t fully grasped the working of this world. The strongest person I came across was the commander of Knights Templar, Johnathan, and he said that the status of 3-Star is recognized by the kingdom. However, there are 4-Star, 5-Star, and even 6- Star swordsmen, as well, in this world. Also, there are unknown beings who use the power of magic which I never experienced. Even if I can overwhelmingly defeat Captain Johnathan, there is no certainty that I can deal with all the unknown beings who might come in my way.\u2019He took a deep breath. Taking in the mana, he slammed the steel.Kaang!He had to train\u2014Because he was accepting new people into his fence, because he had no intention for people like Hans, who are under him, to be taken down.Like that, one day, two days, \u2026, time passed.Roman\u2019s body had turned one with the sword. As if he was making himself a sword, he accepted the flaming heat and trained the body.Thus, ten days passed.Tuk.The sound of hammering came to a halt.The first sword\u2014For a person, the first is very special.Roman looked at the sword shining in the sunlight, and gradually, a smile bloomed on his face as he looked at the slowly dying heat.\u2018This sword is perfectly suited to me.\u2019The forging period was short. Still, even though ten days wasn\u2019t enough time, he succeeded in producing a sword at a level like this due to his passion and experience. It wasn\u2019t an ordinary sword sold in markets, but it was able to accept mana better than a lump of steel, and it met all the conditions Roman wanted.With this sword, my preparation is done.Noticing his dantian boiling due to heat, Roman gave the sword a name.\u201cNaming you after this world, I will call you Salamander.\u201dHe held the sword.Now, it was his turn to dispatch and expose the true face of Barco.This was previously translated as skeletal metamorphosis.Demonic Sect members are known as demons.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40 - The Flower Of Lawrence (1)Published onJul 28, 2022\u202210 min read\u2022254 viewsTen days earlier, Lawrence\u2019s foot kicked the ground.\u201cThe Martell family turned down our offer.\u201d\u201c\u2026The same goes for the Bartra family. Even though we said we would accept building the distribution network they asked for, they suddenly said they couldn\u2019t help us out. Lord. It seems that it is actually difficult to get help from those around us due to the pressure of the Barco family.\u201dBang!\u201cDamn it!\u201dAt the report of vassals, Viscount Lawrence couldn\u2019t contain his anger and smashed the table.Before the dispute with Barco, Martell and Bartras were places that came to form connections with Lawrence. Lawrence then gave them fertile lands and power in the North-East region, and Viscount Lawrence maintained an amicable relationship with them.Thus, the viscount remembered the relationships from back then and asked them for help. However, the lord of the two families, who always greeted Lawrence with a smile, showed a cold attitude this time.He understood it. Recently, rumors were going around in the North-East region\u2014Rumors that if a single force interferes with Barco\u2019s actions by intervening in the dispute between Lawrence and Barco, they will retaliate against them after Lawrence fell. Everyone knew that the rumor was spread by Barco intentionally, but despite that, their families were scared.Barco blocked the possibility of getting help. Now that there is a week of probation, Viscount Lawrence felt choked up.\u201cDid you get a call from the Golden Bank?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes. They said they would consider a land-based loan, but it doesn\u2019t seem like it will work out in a week. Golden Bank isn\u2019t a neutral force. Moreover, as they invested a large amount in the Barco family, they seemed to have decided that empowering the Barco family will be more beneficial for them than helping us.\u201d\u201cSigh.\u201dThe viscount felt dizzy. The Golden Bank wasn\u2019t a force limited to the Cairo Kingdom, but a force that boasted enormous capital power that affected the entire continent. Their home base is said to be the Valhalla Empire, which is one of the two empires. Actually, they were a force that put on a neutral position based on their values, but in problems in which their interests are at stake, they openly favor the advantageous side.Barco and Lawrence\u2014The odds were higher for Barco, so it was better to side and invest in them.\u201cSo are you saying there is no answer?\u201dLast few weeks, Viscount Lawrence was running all over to solve the problem. The breakup with Dmitry put Lawrence in a corner, but he tried to do anything to survive\u2014he met many people while talking about the past. Among them, the contact with Golden Bank was such an attempt; it was something he did despite knowing it would fail. If he could borrow money, he could hire mercenaries like the Barco family. However, the foxes in Golden Bank didn\u2019t do business as that could cause them a loss.And now, he was stuck at a dead end.Everything is over.After a week, Barco will come to attack, and Lawrence will not be able to withstand the attack.\u2019\u2026 I should have calmed the heart of Dmitry.\u2019Dmitry\u2014Their presence turned into poison. Even when he was prepping for the marriage with Dmitry, he wondered if the problems would get resolved, but he turned his back on Dmitry, and now, even the forces on Dmitry\u2019s side didn\u2019t help.The real powers in the North-East region are Barco and Dmitry. And now, both families were hostile to him, making Lawrence a loner.This is bad.A woman sitting at the far end of the room spoke cautiously when the vassals couldn\u2019t speak.\u201cFather, can I say something?\u201dHer identity\u2014She was Lawrence\u2019s golden jade leaf, Flora Lawrence.Roman Dmitry\u2014starting with the meeting with that man, Flora\u2019s common sense about the world had completely collapsed.\u2019My judgment was wrong. I was prejudiced against Roman Dmitry, and the real fool was me, not him.Roman\u2019s actions were shocking. At first, she only thought that Roman had meddled with something, but as time passed, she learned the details of them\u2014Roman killed Ben Miles, the leader of the Blood Fang in front of so many people. Moreover, all of it was done with Roman\u2019s own strength, which was more shocking.The purpose of dealing with Blood Fang came from them harassing the people in Dmitry\u2019s estate, and knowing that Lawrence\u2019s response was insufficient, he was bold enough to make drastic decisions.Suddenly, Flora felt ashamed.Although the eldest son of Dmitry was called an idiot, he was doing something for his family. However, she was someone who broke the marriage and put the Lawrence family in danger. If she could turn back time, at least the drastic choice of breaking the engagement would be held, and she would at least try to get to know the guy.\u2018I was stupid. Choosing to break the marriage without taking any measures was a choice that would inevitably lead my family to destruction.\u2019There was a time when she thought she was smart\u2014After completing the advanced courses in the academy with good grades and seeing her father smiling brightly, she thought she was the perfect daughter.However, she didn\u2019t know back then\u2014The fact that studying something while receiving the support of her family wasn\u2019t something the world works on, and that she was just a flower in a greenhouse. And outside the greenhouse, wild animals like Barco often lurked. They drooled and showed their teeth, and they didn\u2019t care what Flora\u2019s life had been like.Flora announced the breaking of the engagement and locked herself in her room. Still, marriage should be done with someone who you love\u2014that concept didn\u2019t change for her, but in the face of reality, she didn\u2019t have the courage to face her father. Because of her mistake, her father went to beg for help each day.The lights in the conference room of the family never went out, and when the meeting was done, she couldn\u2019t dare approach the vassals who looked dead and hopeless to her.As Flora Lawrence, known as the flower of Lawrence, this was a harsh time for her, who had only seen and experienced good things till now.She was in pain. She would have a fever in the middle of the night and wake up in cold sweat. With time, it became more frequent. In Flora\u2019s mind, Roma\u2019s image often emerged.\u2018How could he have done such a thing?\u2019With his own strength\u2014In a situation where no one expected him to do so, Roman boldly acted out his choices for the family. It was amazing. Aside from the fact that such a thing was possible, it looked much more interesting as he had made up his mind to do such a thing.And from that point on, Roman began to appear in Flora\u2019s dreams, and her heart changed little by little as that happened.And one day, she made a decision\u2014\u201cLet\u2019s not turn away from reality. Flora, if no one helps us, then just as Roman Dmitry defeated the Blood Fang himself, we need to find a way to solve our problems.\u201dIn a dark room, Flora came out. With her hair tied up so she could comfortably move, she went to the library of Lawrence and grabbed a few books. Right, the type of books she grabbed was on Military Law, which helped one prepare for war.Flora said, \u201cWe are pushed to a corner now. Barco cut off the help from around, and the difference in power is too obvious. Thus, there is an opinion that we should preserve even a little of the family\u2019s land through surrender, but I don\u2019t think it will work.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think so? Rather than killing innocent people, surrender is the best option for everyone,\u201d asked Viscount Lawrence.Seeing the questionable look in his eyes, Flora looked at him with a calm face.\u201cBarco borrowed money from the Golden Bank using their connections. Rumor has it that the loan process was conducted without any collateral, so a loan without collateral would inevitably have a higher interest rate. In this war, Barco isn\u2019t at complete benefit. In order for both the borrower and lender to get good results, the land will be torn apart after Lawrence gets captured. Half will be taken by Barco and the other half by the Golden Bank. And yet, their thirst will not be quenched. Thus, they will have to scratch till the bottom of any safe to get their satisfactions worth of things.\u201d\u201cAhem.\u201dThe vassals didn\u2019t like this. It was a cruel remark, but no one could deny the reality.\u201cThen what are we supposed to do?\u201d\u201cThere is only one way\u2014A desperate resistance. That is the only way we can survive.\u201d\u201cResistance\u2014is that really the best choice?\u201dViscount Lawrence looked disappointed. Flora\u2019s remarks raised his expectations for her. He thought that she had the ability to see the situation accurately and judge it, but in the end, she failed him.Locking the gates of the estate, anyone could think that this approach she was speaking of was different from others.\u201cIt isn\u2019t just about holding on against their attacks. Give up farming this year and set fire to the fields. And after hoarding as much food as possible to survive. We keep resisting until the winter comes.\u201d\u201cCan we even survive till winter?\u201d\u201cYes. Barco borrowed a large amount of money for this war. Although they used the connections to make loans without collateral, in fact, the Golden Bank isn\u2019t a force that will do tasks because of the pressure from higher-ups. The bank is a force that affects the entire continent. If war doesn\u2019t end quickly and time extends, the Barco family will have to face pressure regarding the high-interest rate. The larger the loan, the higher the interest. That is the only weakness we can attack. The mercenaries will run for the money, and the money will come from the Golden Bank. And when the winter comes, the weather will be unfavorable for a siege, and people are bound to be exhausted or tired. Then, it\u2019ll be natural for them to think about backing out.\u201d\u201cHuh!\u201d\u201cSuch a way was there!\u201dAt Flora\u2019s words, the vassals admired her. At first, they were puzzled, but the more she spoke, the more they fell in love with her words.This made sense\u2014A race against time\u2014Since Barco\u2019s power wasn\u2019t their own, there was a chance of winning if they dragged the time.\u2018When did my daughter grow up this much?\u2019Viscount Lawrence looked at his daughter with a complicated expression. His only daughter\u2014The one he raised so preciously while being wary of breaking her, like a flowering plant in the greenhouse, was now blooming. And when the thing with Dmitry happened, Viscount Lawrence thought that he had given her too much privilege and she was immature. However, the truth was different. When faced with a situation where they were sinking, Flora showed her colors.\u2018She must have suffered so much due to her incompetent father.\u2019Flora\u2019s face was frowning. Her suffering was now appearing on her face. His daughter\u2014He didn\u2019t want to see such a lovely child collapse in the hands of the Barco family.Viscount Lawrence said, \u201cFlora is right. The Barco family isn\u2019t a force that holds much power in their hands. So, prepare for a desperate resistance right now. We will hold on and preserve, and we will continue as Lawrence!\u201dThe decision was made. There will be no surrender. The white flag will not rise. The Lawrence family decided to endure the troubles till the end, even if it meant they would die.A week after that, the day of the battle that Barco had foretold finally dawned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41 - The Flower Of Lawrence (2)The Heavenly Demon Can\u2019t Live a Normal LifePublished onJul 29, 2022\u202210 min read\u2022177 viewsStep step.Down the wall, they saw someone walking. Even though many people were looking down the wall, there was no fear in his steps, and the flag in his hands was fluttering in the wind.A white deer was standing alone\u2014At the symbol of the Barco family, Lawrence soldiers gulped with nervous faces.Tak.Finally, he stopped walking.The man looked around the top of the wall with a relaxed expression, and when he saw Viscount Lawrence, he stopped his gaze.\u201cAs Viscount Barco\u2019s representative, I will give you three options from now on. First: open the gates and surrender. Viscount Barco is merciful to those who ask for forgiveness, and surrendering is the only way to save your lives. However, you might not choose the first one. If that is the case, there is no reason for us to face each other as of now.\u201dThe messenger looked arrogant. At best, he looked like he was speaking and communicating his intentions, as if he was Viscount Barco.\u201cThe second is to go to war with us. In front of the people of the Central Government, let us head into it and decide the fight fairly. Any method of fighting is good\u2014Be it hand-to-hand combat or a Warrior Battle, we will follow the way you want.\u201dHand-to-hand combat or Warrior Battle\u2014Nobles mainly used this method to cover their mistakes. The people of this world considered it shameful to wage a siege just because of a dispute among nobles. He thought they were hiding behind the wall as they weren\u2019t confident in dealing with the other family. Naturally, most of the nobles would choose one of two ways.Also, that was why the people of the Central Government were present. They would be neutral to the method they would choose to fight it out.Viscount Lawrence took a step ahead.\u201cWe do not think your declaration for war is justified. The document that mentions our ancestors\u2019 debt is forged, and we have no cause for war with you nor any desire to open the gates and sacrifice the lives of Lawrence\u2019s people. So go back now and tell Viscount Barcos. Lawrence will\u2014\u201d\u201cThird!\u201dHe stopped talking. Actually, the choice was already decided. On the day Barco predicted, from the moment Lawrence shut its gates, the two families would choose the third option.Still, there was one reason for sending the messenger\u2014It was to pressure Lawrence, and the messenger informed the soldiers of Lawrence.\u201cYou have chosen to abandon the pride of being a noble family and fight a deadly fight within the fortress walls. From now on, the Barco family will accept your will and make you pay the price by bloodshed during this siege.\u201dThat was the end of it.The messenger stepped back. Even when they saw the flag fluttering in the wind, Lawrence couldn\u2019t fire an arrow.And finally, the war had begun.The first battle ended sooner than expected. The Barco family, who thought they could punish Lawrence right away, gave the order of retreat within 30 minutes of the start.Bang!\u201cCheeky bastards!\u201dViscount Barco threw the helmet he was wearing to the ground.Just now, the aspect of the battle was different than expected. The army of the Barco family was three times greater than Lawrence, and intending to destroy the walls at once, he led his men.Lawrence\u2019s walls weren\u2019t very high. It was known that Dmitry\u2019s stronghold fortress was difficult to capture even with ten times the current force, but that wasn\u2019t the case for Lawrence. He thought he could get it done within an hour. But what happened?\u2014Lawrence\u2019s counterattack was more fierce than he expected.\u201cViscount. Apparently, Lawrence was fully prepared for it. A moat was dug deep to block the approach of the troops, and they prepared boiling oil and fire, as well. Also, judging from the non-existent hesitation in firing the arrows from the wall, it appears they managed to secure enough supplies,\u201d said the lieutenant.He felt annoyed. One week\u2014That time wasn\u2019t enough for the opponent to prepare. He was going to take down Lawrence and make them surrender, but they chose to fight in this desperate situation.\u2018According to our known information, Lawrence should have surrendered with the thought to protect a little of their hand. We completely blocked the possibility of an alliance, and we showed superiority in our troops. However, Lawrence was prepared with the intention to lock the gates. They couldn\u2019t have dared to risk their lives for it.\u2019Barco\u2019s plan\u2014They weren\u2019t hoping for war from the start.The Golden Bank and the judge were also brought. Thus, they thought about letting the opponent surrender. However, now, the plan was going haywire. It was just 30 minutes, but the response from Lawrence was too systematic, and considering the action of setting fire to the fields they owned, it seemed like they were prepping for a long battle. It was the moment that their heads ached at the current situation. As Flora predicted, the Barco family borrowed huge sums of money from the Golden Bank, and ending the war as quickly as possible was the only way the Barco family could stay alive.\u201cViscount, what should we do?\u201dThe lieutenant looked into his eyes. Dozens of soldiers were lost in this small fight. They were going to check the power of Lawrence, but due to the fierce counterattack, their losses were more than expected.\u2018Viscount Lawrence isn\u2019t that strong-willed. Just like he sold his Golden Jade Leaf to the Dmitry family under Barco\u2019s pressure, he is someone who turns into a coward in crisis. Nevertheless, choosing to fight means that changes have taken place within. They wouldn\u2019t have made a choice if they didn\u2019t have an advantage, and they are clearly showing the advantage they have with the war dragging on.\u2019He thought quickly. This war\u2014All of it was Viscount Barco\u2019s plan. He moved his son Anthony Barco and quarreled with Lawrence with forged documents that led to this war. And now, finally, they were in the endgame. This was the end of the plan, so Barco couldn\u2019t give the lead to Lawrence.\u201cHow about it? Prepare \u2018it\u2019 right now.\u201d\u201c\u2026I understand.\u201d\u2018It\u2019\u2014Viscount Barco smiled bitterly. There was something the Lawrence family had overlooked. Viscount Barco only wanted to win with the least number of people out there, but it wasn\u2019t as if he wasn\u2019t concerned about the possibility of defeat at all.The Golden Bank\u2014They had lent more money than he expected. And that money was enough to create a huge variable.Above the wall, the soldiers of Lawrence moved busily. The victory in the first short battle brought smiles to their faces, but they all knew they couldn\u2019t relax right now.\u201cMove fast!\u201d\u201cWe never know when his men will attack us again. Stay alert and move quickly!\u201dOne win\u2014That gave them confidence. It proved Barco wasn\u2019t an unbeatable opponent for them.Viscount Lawrence said, \u201cFlora, you were right. Just preparing for this in a standard manner was enough for us to prevent the attack from Barco. How did you manage to come up with this idea? You only learned the skills of nobles in the academy. I don\u2019t think they taught you things such as warfare.\u201dA change in Flora was surprising. Flora\u2019s opinions were actively presented in the process of setting fire to the fields and preparing for war.Flora looked at the soldiers. Her attire was the same as theirs. Normally, a noblewoman would dress in an elegant dress, but now, she was wearing armor on the top. She even practiced archery over the past few days to help in the battle. Of course, her skills hadn\u2019t increased much with just a few days of preparation, but her attitude had brought a rise in the soldiers\u2019 morale.The Flower of Lawrence\u2014Flora was the symbol of Lawrence. Because she didn\u2019t give up till the end, Lawrence\u2019s soldiers who saw her didn\u2019t lose hope either.Flora said, \u201cAs father said, the academy didn\u2019t teach me how to fight. They said there was no need to learn such things because I would never go to the battlefield while living as a noblewoman. However, seeing the Barco family\u2019s behavior, I knew I had to be strong-willed. Rather than waiting for the problems to get resolved on their own, I had to know what the problem was and develop the ability or way to solve it. Thus, I studied on my own\u2014That is the direction I want to live in the future, as well.\u201d\u201c\u2026Flora.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. This is what I want to do.\u201dFlora\u2019s words made his heart ache. Had there been someone strong in the family, or if the family was strong, she wouldn\u2019t have to experience this. However, that allowed Flora to grow up in a short time, as well. Nevertheless, it was daunting\u2014The fact that his daughter was fine with this. His daughter had grown up pleasingly, and he didn\u2019t even know it yet.\u201cAs long as the problem with Barco gets resolved, this father will make sure to never bring any quarrels into your future. I am sorry for forcing you to marry Dmitry. At that time, I thought that was the only way our collapsing family could survive. However, now, I believe that you can make the right choices in any situation.\u201dThey ended it\u2014The conversation was postponed. To be precise, they couldn\u2019t help but talk about this another time.\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cNo way!\u201dThe soldiers were shocked. Over the wall, at Barco\u2019s camp, they could feel a movement. \u2018It\u2019 was huge. The overall shape was like a catapult. However, those who saw it knew this wasn\u2019t a simple catapult.\u201cThat\u2019s insane!\u201d\u201cBarco prepared a Flare!\u201dFlare\u2014the name of a siege weapon. The catapult known as Flare was designed to throw something at the wall, a magic weapon that caused explosions. It was a magical weapon that could be bought with an enormous amount of money. The cost was truly high, but everyone knew of its effectiveness. This was an unexpected development. No matter how much money Barco borrowed, they didn\u2019t expect them to have enough connections to rent or bring a flare.\u201cEveryone! To your places!\u201d\u201cPrepare for attack.\u201dAt the complicated situation, Flora\u2019s expression turned pale. She had studied war tactics for a few days, so she knew about the power of the Flare.\u2019When the Flare starts to attack, the walls will collapse instantly. A powerful flame will come to destroy the wall and burn the soldiers, as well. There are only two ways to stop it\u2014Either fight with another magical weapon of that force or open the gate, go out and smash the Flare.\u2019The former was impossible\u2014Lawrence didn\u2019t have enough money for it. Magic weapons such as those could only be bought with vast sums of money. Then, the second one? It was a suicide to go out now.Just then, the Flare spewed fire and fired a massive fireball.Kwaang!Rumble!\u201cKuaak!\u201d\u201cAackk!\u201dWith just one hit, the top of the wall fell instantly. Fortunately, the entire wall hadn\u2019t collapsed, but the soldiers who were hit at close range were screaming due to their terrible wounds. Moreover, this wasn\u2019t the worst\u2014If the fireball had hit them properly, a dozen soldiers would have burned down without even being able to react to it.The opponent\u2019s power was beyond what they knew\u2014It was something they hadn\u2019t planned for. The books said running away at such times was the best option, but retreat wasn\u2019t possible now.\u2018We cannot give up like this.\u2019She clenched her teeth and grabbed her bow.At least, I should do something.Just when she was about to make a move, a maid hurriedly approached her and shouted, \u201cMiss! Miss! We just received a call from Roman Dmitry!\u201d\u201cWhat? That Roman from Dmitry?\u201dRoman\u2014An unexpected name popped up. Also, the reason was unknown. However, that wasn\u2019t important right now, so Flora turned her head and headed toward the wall to fight.However,\u201cRoman Dmitry asked me to tell you this\u2014Lawrence\u2019s crisis\u2014if you want him to help, contact him.\u201dHearing those words, Flora couldn\u2019t help but stop walking toward the wall.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42 - The Flower Of Lawrence (3)The call was made through a magic device. Seeing Roman float in the air, Flora sat down and asked firmly, \u201cA way to help Lawrence\u2014what is it?\u201dShe asked straightforwardly\u2014Now that the soldiers were dying outside, she needed any help as soon as possible to solve the problems of Lawrence.[As you\u2019re asking me that directly, I will be honest and tell you. I intend to take revenge on the Barco family for my own personal reasons. The decision has already been made, and from now on, it is a matter of timing on when to take revenge. So, I contacted you. If the Lawrence family says they will sympathize with what I came up with, I will advance the timing of my actions and bring down the Barco family for you.]What Roman suggested was unexpected. For Lawrence, it was like finding an oasis in the desert. However, Flora knew that there was a trap in his words.\u201c\u2026What do we have to do in your plan?\u201d[It\u2019s simple\u2014Sacrifice for my plan. If the Lawrence family shows their willingness to be the first to bleed and lays down the plates, I will do my best to help you. This is a promise in the name of Roman Dmitry. In order for our conversation to go forward, this promise needs to be made.]Sacrifice\u2014It was a sensitive word. Hearing it, Flora\u2019s eyes twitched instantly\u2014Roman Dmitry was a clear-cut man. She did go ahead and break up with him, but she couldn\u2019t sacrifice herself for the sake of others. It seemed as if she didn\u2019t want to hold that man\u2019s hand. Roman\u2019s existence was complicated for Flora. Continuing to be close to him and around him brought up unknown emotions from within her.However, she had no choice. In the first place, after being pushed to the edge of the cliff, like in the current situation, she was ready to put herself on the line.\u2018Perhaps he knew about our current situation and suggested it. Nevertheless, Roman Dmitry is the only one who moved and offered to help Lawrence. We cannot turn down his offer now.\u2019She clenched her fist. Self-esteem had been thrown out the door long back. Flora\u2019s first priority was her family\u2019s safety, so she looked at Roman and said, \u201cI promise. If it means you will protect my family, I will do anything to help.\u201d[One more thing. I need you to agree to something.]\u201cSay it.\u201d[Because of my participation in the war, words will definitely go around in the future. As our marriage is already broken, I have no reason to intervene in the war, and that is something the Barco family and the Central Government will also raise questions about. Therefore, there is something you will have to do with what comes next. If you want the Lawrence family to be safe, give me a justification to intervene in the war.]Justification\u2014Until then, she didn\u2019t know what he meant. However, as Roman continued speaking, Flora couldn\u2019t control her expression. Finally, the conversation was over. She hadn\u2019t accepted the offer.At Roman\u2019s words that he will wait only for 30 minutes, Flora headed towards the wall with weak footsteps.\u2018Is it really the right thing to accept Roman\u2019s proposal?\u2019Roman\u2014His words were shocking.[The Barco family had made some kind of plan to split Dmitry and Lawrence. While I was drunk, they made me stay in a room with Emily Barco, a child of the Barco family, and they forced and pushed me to break the marriage, having that as an excuse. This is my personal cause to take revenge on them, and this is why I plan to punish them. Anthony Barco\u2014Claim that he molested you. I have nothing against him, but the fact that he did something like that made it tough for the Dmitry family to promote the marriage. Perhaps, it will cause your value to tumble down. The reputation you hold as the Flower of Lawrence will be shattered along with the story of the marriage being called off, and that is a fatal hit in the noble society. However, if you are fine with giving up the status of a noblewoman, you can get one important thing in exchange\u2014Me solving this crisis of Lawrence.]At those words, her hands trembled. It was a reality that Flora couldn\u2019t accept, but she didn\u2019t want to avert her gaze. She is no longer a flower in the greenhouse. In the face of the harsh reality, Flora was ready to give up everything.\u201cThis is precisely the justification for me to intervene in the war. To not forgive those who touched me\u2014the same happened with Blood Fang, and it will not be different this time, either. If the time of molestation was before the break-up, Flora Lawrence, you were mine. So, if you can promise me that, I will ensure that Anthony Barco will never look at you with those lustful eyes ever again.\u201dYou were mine\u2014Hearing that, her heart skipped a beat. A mutually beneficial deal\u2014However, Roman said that if their marriage wasn\u2019t called off, Flora would\u2019ve been his.Right\u2014She was someone he didn\u2019t even know. However, Roman was trying to do something dangerous with Barco for just that sole reason.Bang!Rumble!\u201cThe wall has fallen!\u201d\u201cPut up the iron fence!\u201dAfter her short absence, she came to know the wall had fallen. Part of the wall collapsed due to the constant attacks from the Flare, and Barco\u2019s soldiers could be seen marching forward. They wouldn\u2019t last long. It was only a matter of time before Lawrence collapsed, and due to the opponent\u2019s power, they had lost their advantage.It was dark. With flames burning the place and smoke rising up, Flora ran to the wall.Puck!\u201cKuak!\u201dUnder the wall, one of the soldiers who was running fell down. Flora quickly used her arrow to help them out. She had been practicing for a few days, and the faint pain was still felt on her finger. However, that didn\u2019t matter. Flora tore her skirt, stood in a comfortable position, and shouted loudly for all the soldiers to listen.\u201cAttack! We will never fall!\u2019At that moment, Flora acknowledged that when she entered the battlefield, she gave up the role of the noblewoman, which she had been living as all this while.\u201cHandel!\u201d\u2014The maid\u2019s name.Seeing Handel run toward her with a frightened face, Flora spoke with her eyes fixed on the target.\u201cCall Roman Dmitry right now. Tell him\u2014I will do anything he wants, so get rid of those Barco bastards right now. I know for sure that I do not want to be a concubine under Anthony Barco.\u201dShe made her decision. From now on, Flora would live a new life.Tuk.The magic communication was cut off. When Flora said she would accept the offer, Chris, watching from the side, asked, \u201cAre we going to attack right away?\u2019Roman and the soldiers\u2014They were far from Lawrence. Even if he gave the order now, they would go to help immediately, but Roman didn\u2019t want to overdo it.\u201cNo, we are going to watch for a little more.\u201d\u201cIf we hold back, Lawrence might collapse. Barco managed to get the Flare weapon under them. It has firepower that Lawrence cannot withstand. If you really want to help Lawrence and break down Barco\u2019s plans, we should attack the enemy now, making it tough for them to breathe and recover.\u201dThis was the right advice. Chris had studied warfare, so he knew what Lawrence was capable of handling.However, Roman had different thoughts.\u201cWhy do I have to care about that?\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if Lawrence collapses. Even if the walls fall and Barco continues to attack, Lawrence, who is desperate to fight, will be able to last an hour. What I want the most out of the fight between Lawrence and Barco is a good amount of damage to them.\u201dThose were cruel words\u2014He considered just the practical gains and excluded his emotions completely.\u201cChris.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThere are a few things to keep in mind if you want to follow me in the future as well. It is more important to me that one person I know doesn\u2019t bleed, even if hundreds of those I don\u2019t know have to die. Obviously, a lot of people from Lawrence will die due to this. However, it is their problem because they followed an incompetent person, and I don\u2019t intend to force myself in the middle and sacrifice the lives of those who swore their allegiance to me. So, get some rest. When we decide to move for Lawrence earnestly, we will have a lot of bloodshed to do.\u201d\u201c\u2026I understand.\u201dChris nodded his head. Now he knew for sure\u2014Roman Dmitry\u2014He might look cruel to others, but he is at least a man worthy to swear allegiance to.Above the wall, things were changing rapidly.With Barco\u2019s army getting close, Flora approached Viscount Lawrence and said, \u201cFather! Open the gates right now and face the army of Barco from the front!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?!\u201dOpen the gates?\u2014That was something Viscount Lawrence couldn\u2019t understand. However, Flora didn\u2019t have the time to explain this in detail and just persuaded her father.\u201cI just made a deal with Roman Dmitry through a magic device. The reason we cannot stand Barco\u2019s attack is due to the presence of the Flare. If we open the gates right now and distract the enemies, then Roman Dmitry will appear with his army and destroy the Flare.\u201d\u201cWhy will Roman Dmitry do that?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have time to elaborate. What is certain is that Roman Dmitry isn\u2019t the man we thought he was.\u201dAt that moment, Viscount Lawrence was utterly confused.Roman Dmitry\u2014After the Blood Fang incident, he clearly didn\u2019t seem like a normal guy. There was a sense of dignity around that man and the way he carried himself. Also, he didn\u2019t look like a person who would say one thing and do another. However, the problem was that he had no reason to help Lawrence. Naturally, he should be angry because the marriage was called off, so he couldn\u2019t think why that man would want to help them.\u2018Is it even right to trust that man and open the gates? From what my daughter says, Roman Dmitry is probably going to help with his own strength and not the help of his family. Moreover, the opponent is the Barco family. No matter how much we aim to distract their attention, it is difficult to defeat the troops, who are elite mercenaries, only by our soldiers. Also, without Aura, the Flare cannot be cut down.\u2019His judgment wasn\u2019t wrong. He was at a crossroads now. Viscount Lawrence felt weak. He was a typical docile person, and the more dangerous a situation was, the less his ability to make the right judgment.\u201cFather\u2014No, dad. This is a fight in which we are at a disadvantage either way! The moment we choose to fight back, we get to bet a lot on this fight, and if we fail to take down Barco, we lose Lawrence, our family, and our name will get wiped out of the history of the Cairo Kingdom, dad. So trust me. Destroying the Flare with Roman Dmitry, who is on his way to help, is the only way we can survive.\u201d\u2014Flora said eagerly.Viscount Lawrence looked at her. The armor over her body, the tanned skin due to intense flames, the torn skirt fluttering in the wind, and the bow in her hand\u2014While the man known as the Lord was weak and unable to make a decision, Flora was able to find solutions. He believed in her\u2014his one and only daughter.Viscount Lawrence overcame his fear and shouted to the soldiers.\u201cOpen the gates now! Roman Dmitry has agreed to help us. Get out of the gates and slay those evil bastards of Barco!\u201dThe gates opened wide. Following Roman\u2019s plan, Lawrence was ready to make sacrifices.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 - Participation In The War (1)Creak.Thud.The gates finally opened. Breaking through the rising dust due to explosions, the soldiers of Lawrence ran out.\u201cCharge!\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dHundreds of soldiers\u2014Their faces were full of fear. Flames were burning over the wall, and many enemy troops were rushing toward the gate.Even though they were called soldiers, they weren\u2019t the kind who had received regular training. However, knowing that Lawrence could collapse if they retreated from here, they all clenched their teeth and ran toward their opponent.\u201cDie!\u201dPuak!\u201cAck!\u201dArmies of both sides clashed. The soldiers at the forefront were pushed back but still kept fighting, and due to that, the soldiers of Barco were pushed back due to the force with which the soldiers of Lawrence were stabbing.However, the joy of victory didn\u2019t last long. Lawrence\u2019s soldiers withdrew their weapons and tried to attack another opponent, but as they weren\u2019t trained to move quickly, the enemies slashed their necks.Slash!Thud!Drip.The battle had just begun. The faces of the soldiers were in shock, unable to believe their death or the death of others. Early in the battle, Lawrence was dominating the other side. Supported by the arrows being fired from above the wall, they pushed the army of Barco.Puak!Puak! Puak!Barco\u2019s soldiers collapsed with arrows hitting them. The knight of Lawrence, who stepped on their corpses, boasted a silver armor that shone in the sun and slaughtered the enemies in front.Blood was gushing out.In an instant, corpses were piling up like mountains, and the Lawrence soldiers followed the knight and moved to the enemy camp. Even then, they believed they had a chance. While checking the appearance of enemy forces falling by their weapons. They thought the power of Barco wasn\u2019t that great.However, that was all an illusion. Barco was a bit shocked by the unexpected attack, but as time went on, the situation changed.\u201cRunning wild even though they don\u2019t know their opponent!\u201d\u201cHow dare they?!\u201dSlash!Puak!Among the soldiers, a group of people was engaged in a massacre. They were the Berge mercenaries. They made a living by fighting and even showed a prominent performance among soldiers. They helped each other out and slaughtered the soldiers of Lawrence, and even in the midst of the difficult battle where one couldn\u2019t fully understand the situation, they were able to hold their ground. Even if the opponent was a knight, they fought back.It was the time when the Aura was being perfectly handled that the knight who seemed skilled came. The knight of Lawrence, who was fighting at the forefront, wielded his sword at the mercenaries around, and eventually, was attacked from all sides.Slash!\u201cKuak!\u201dThe knight groaned in pain at the sword piercing his flesh and collapsed at the attacks that came from all directions. After that, the atmosphere changed. Lawrence, too, had recruited mercenaries to have a numerical advantage, but they weren\u2019t as skilled as the Berge mercenaries. At some point, they couldn\u2019t push forward any longer. Although they moved 500m from the wall, Lawrence\u2019s soldiers, who had lost their momentum, struggled to survive, looking shocked.One, then two, and so on, people continued to die. The sight of people around them dying began to spread fear within the soldiers of Lawrence.\u201cOh, no. We are finished. We cannot beat them!\u201dThe difference in power was too high. Eventually, the soldiers began to step back. Facing the ferocious hordes of wild beasts who were causing chaos and destruction, they realized they couldn\u2019t continue it\u2014this fight would bring them to a desperate end.Due to the variables, Lawrence couldn\u2019t even play the role of a perfect bait.Swish!An arrow flew. Even though her arms were trembling as the same action was repeated several times, Flora kept doing it.Just then, the soldiers started screaming. They had to fight a little more, but they seemed to retreat back at the helpless sight.\u2018We cannot be pushed back already!\u2019Her heart plummeted. Roman\u2019s plan\u2014It was a two-way plan. If the gates were open and the soldiers of Lawrence attacked, the Barco would focus their forces on the soldiers. And that was the chance Roman was speaking about. With the fight happening in front of the gates, there wouldn\u2019t be many troops behind Barco, so Roman could crush down the Flare. Flares are expensive. As the price is high and they aren\u2019t easily found, Lawrence could secure a higher advantage by destroying it.\u201cDo not back off! Hold on!\u201d\u2014Flora cried out. Even now, the enemy hadn\u2019t sent out many troops. Many troops remained behind Barco\u2019s camp, and if things continued like this, even Roman would get hurt.However, despite Flora crying out, Lawrence\u2019s soldiers couldn\u2019t stand it. They were people who had lost their will to fight, and the mercenaries on Barco\u2019s side weren\u2019t people they could stop.This was the end. Flora stayed up all night studying warfare but faced a reality that books didn\u2019t convey.\u2018I should have known our level. Unlike Barco, we weren\u2019t ready to fight.\u2019Lawrence\u2014They were peace-loving people. They lived a good life with the wealth that came from their fertile lands but failed to have troops to protect them. And due to that, this problem arose.Because Barco had nothing like that, Lawrence was an easy prey to them. They have always been a force that fought to loot others. It was an obvious fight from the start. At the sight of two of Lawrence\u2019s soldiers stepping out to deal with one soldier of Barco, Flora lost her mind.\u2018We never had a winning chance.\u2019Roman Dmitry\u2014He will not show up.She didn\u2019t know if Lawrence had acted as the bait he wanted, but now, that man wouldn\u2019t try to help. The sacrifice they made was meaningless, as well. Now, Lawrence\u2019s only choice was to be self-reliant. Still, if they stood by the wall, they could survive for a day or two, but as they had opened the gates to get help, they lost that chance, too.What should we do now?There were so many reasons to give up now, but Flora, who had sworn and adapted to stay mentally stronger within these past few days, was continuously looking for answers.Puck!An arrow that cut through the wind hit the target. Even if this place fell, Flora would not give up. She would not beg the enemy. Just as she had told her maid, it was Flora\u2019s choice to die like this, rather than turn into a concubine for Anthony Barco.Just then,\u201c\u2026!?\u201dA horde moving from a distance could be seen. Their goal seemed clear\u2014The Flare. They were running straight toward the siege weapon.10 minutes earlier.Roman\u2019s soldiers awaited the orders with nervous faces.\u201cPhew.\u201dThis plan\u2014They couldn\u2019t help but feel nervous. They had no idea that they would enter the battle so quickly, and even more so that they would be attempting to attack the rear of Barco. The time to risk their lives had come. Unlike Chris and Kevin, who accepted it casually, the soldiers who followed Roman were anxious. Their feelings could be understood. However, Roman thought there was no need for consideration beyond understanding.\u2019From now onward, it is the reality that you will have to face. If you survive as my soldier, you will get to live as a predator\u2014I promised you that in the beginning, but whether or not you survive depends on your own strength, not me.\u2019Ten days earlier, Roman\u2019s soldiers began their training. They were all trained hard in their own ways with Chris\u2019 whip, but that didn\u2019t catch the eye of Roman. The soldiers\u2019 feelings had changed\u2014Now isn\u2019t the time for empathy.Ahead of this operation, Roman said, \u201cAs explained at the start, this is an operation in which we will aim at the rear of Barco and destroy their siege weapon. Perhaps Lawrence might not even serve as proper bait. The difference in power is too huge for them to even play that role.\u201dLawrence was a variable. However, Roman expected it. From the beginning, he didn\u2019t expect them to do their job properly. Moreover, in a sense, it meant this wasn\u2019t going to be easy.Seeing the gaze of Roman looking at them, the soldiers didn\u2019t avoid it. 30 soldiers\u2014They are going to risk their lives now. Clearly, they were characters with strong hearts, and even though they looked nervous now, they wouldn\u2019t run away from reality. And, honestly, that was enough. Roman brought a minimum number of people for his plan.\u201cI don\u2019t expect to give each of you a role. I will take the lead, and when I run ahead to slaughter the enemies ahead of us, you all will follow behind to clear the remaining ones. Keep in mind\u2014Our primary goal is to destroy Barco\u2019s siege weapon. If there is someone who cannot do their role and gets drunk on the bloodshed, I will personally tear their limbs off.\u201dRoman\u2019s words shocked the soldiers. They were cruel words, but Roman said he would take the lead in such a dangerous situation. This wasn\u2019t from his consideration toward them. As of now, he doesn\u2019t trust these soldiers yet. Thus, Roman wanted to take the role of facing the enemy head-on.And,\u201cNow!\u201dThe time had finally come. At Roman\u2019s command, the soldiers ran out at once. From afar, Roman and his troops could be seen. Barco quickly grasped what was happening but didn\u2019t summon the troops back.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u2014Viscount Barco asked with a confused expression. Perhaps the opponent had prepared another attack on them, but their number seemed too low, as if it were a joke.\u201cHow will they handle us with that few people? Well, guys who don\u2019t know much about the war always hope for miracles to happen for them. Hey. Get ready to welcome those crazy guests.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe soldiers moved. They had shields on their body and were ready with spears in their hands. The difference in power was obvious. There were only 30 people who carried out the surprise attack, but there were three times as many people behind Barco.Moreover, people like the knights\u2019 commander and the mercenaries\u2019 captain were also there. As Viscount Barco thought, there was no reason to be afraid of this small group of people who were attempting something reckless.And not long after, the enemies arrived. The moment he confirmed the opponent wasn\u2019t from Lawrence, the man in the lead moved.Swish!The soldiers\u2019 world turned upside down in an instant. That man\u2019s movement\u2014They couldn\u2019t keep up with it with their eyes. He definitely seemed to be far away, but instantly, he reached in front of them and hurled toward them. It was a reckless attempt. The soldiers raised their shields to prepare for the reckless attack of the man who was leading the others behind him. The soldiers put their spears ahead to stab that man, as well. The future was evident\u2014The man\u2019s body would turn into a ragged one. However, Viscount Barco, who was observing the situation, was shocked at what happened next.Slash!Puak!Blood splattered on the battlefield. He thought the shields would block him, but his soldiers\u2019 heads fell nevertheless. What followed next was a bloody carnage on the battlefield. The defensive formation collapsed instantly. And this was the reality\u2014An unbelievable sight that was beyond common sense.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44 - Participation In The War (2)Once upon a time, people of the Orthodox factions said, \u201cThe Heavenly Demon is always present at the vanguard of the Demonic Sect. If we can stop his attack at least once, we can stop the attack of those demons who follow him from behind like waves, but even that is impossible for us. The Orthodox Sects have no hope left. The people of Murim should know this for sure\u2014The Heavenly Demon is invincible, and confronting him head-on is equivalent to having a death wish.\u201dDuring the Murim Unification, Baek Joong-hyuk led the demons by being at the vanguard. He stood in front of them and confronted their enemies, and on the path Baek Joong-hyuk laid out, the demons ran wild.People asked\u2014Why? Why take the most dangerous role for yourself?The reason was the same now and even back then.\u2018The strongest man should always be at the vanguard and completely destroy the morale of the enemies.\u2019In a battle, that was the important thing. Just as he had risen to the unreachable position by defeating those bigger than him, Baek Joong-hyuk knew how important it was to gain momentum on one\u2019s side.The role of the strong isn\u2019t to wait in the back while time passes and the battle continues. If one has enough strength to not back down even after facing numerous enemies, the only way to win overwhelmingly is to actively use that strength.That\u2019s right\u2014just like now.Slash!\u201cKuaaak!\u201dA soldier\u2019s arm flew away due to Roman\u2019s attack. The screaming soldier tried to run away, but Roman cut his head off.Slash!Blood splattered due to the force of Roman\u2019s attack. And Roman, who received the rain of blood from the sky, moved ahead toward the soldiers forming a wall in front of him.In an instant, their solid formation collapsed. In the presence of Roman, who appeared like lighting in a dry sky, the soldiers wielded their spears with shocked faces.However,Kang!Chang!Their attacks didn\u2019t work\u2014Roman deflected their attacks aimed at him and took a step ahead to cut their heads.Carnage\u2014No other word could explain the current situation on the battlefield. Roman was facing dozens of soldiers all alone, but he didn\u2019t retreat even a single inch. Instead, he was overwhelming the opponents in front of him, and by each second, they were being taken down. The soldiers who followed him were shocked. They didn\u2019t expect such a bizarre sight when they heard Roman would take the lead.\u201cFollow the liege!\u201d\u201cAttack!\u201dKevin was the first to shout that out. As Kevin and Chris followed, Roman continued to attack their enemies. The other soldiers, as well, swung their weapons with angry eyes.Puak!\u201cUgh.\u201dDue to their attacks, the enemies were constantly being stabbed in their throats, and they would fall down with blood gushing out. Kevin swung his sword straight at the other enemy, not caring about the one he had previously killed. Chris, obviously, was the same. Knowing that Roman would move further away if they hesitated to act, they both tried to catch up to him as much as possible.\u201cT-this.\u201d\u201cStop that monster!\u2019Roman had opened the path. The shield wall made by the enemies had already lost its meaning. Moreover, the soldiers of Barco didn\u2019t dare to rush into the mess due to the terrifying screams they were constantly hearing.They understood it, as well\u2014Understanding that the person who rushed toward Roman ended up dying, they were constantly stepping back and pushing their colleagues ahead, hoping that someone would create a miracle.However, a miracle didn\u2019t occur. Those who moved ahead would instantly die at the hands of Roman, who was taking them down with just one step.Blood, more blood, and even more blood\u2014Everything around him was now dyed crimson. Thousands had died, and even though the blood was already flowing like a river, Roman continued slaughtering them one after another.Alright.\u2018Flare.\u2019\u2014The target of his plan. Finally, the appearance of the siege weapon was getting close. The captain of Berge mercenaries was bewildered at the presence that overwhelmed the surroundings.\u201c\u2026.Uh, what is this?\u201dThe opponent\u2014It was Roman Dmitry. While taking the mission of Barco, he learned the faces of all those who were interesting, but he could never imagine in his wildest dreams that Roman Dmitry was this strong.Nevertheless, it didn\u2019t matter why he was there. The problem was that Roman\u2019s personal army was slaughtering dozens of his soldiers, and if he was left alone, the war between Lawrence and Barco would lead to unexpected results.\u2018That cannot happen.\u2019This mission\u2014He had taken an enormous sum of money for it. As the fate of the Berge Mercenaries was at stake, Berge drew his sword and rushed toward Roman.\u2018I need to take care of him.\u2019Berge\u2014An A-class mercenary recognized by the entire kingdom. Unlike the B-class status, which can be simply obtained from doing chores, to achieve A-class, one must be able to use unique abilities like Aura. Berge was a 2-Star Aura Swordsman. He was already 40 years old, so he didn\u2019t wish for more, but a 2-Star Aura was enough to defeat Roman.Srrng.Rumble.Aura rose\u2014Mana exploded from his body and expressed through the sword, and Berge swung his sword towards Roman.One-shot kill\u2014Promised victory. Even if the opponent was a 3-Star Aura Swordsman, his special move wasn\u2019t an attack that could be blocked easily.However,Kang!Kaang!Roman blocked the attack as if nothing had happened. Seeing that sight, Berge\u2019s eyes widened as if they would tear apart.\u2018This is bad!\u2019A full-fledged attack had to break the opponent\u2019s sword and cut the body, as well. However, the repulsive force felt from the sword shook his insides. It was a different situation from what he expected. The moment Berge was about to hurriedly step back at the warning sign ringing in his head, Roman immediately followed and attacked.Kang!Kakang!Due to the continuous chain of attacks, it felt like his consciousness was fading.Suddenly, an Aura was born from the sword of Roman, and Berge was cornered by attacks from all directions. Roman and Berge\u2014The size of their Auras was different. From an outsider\u2019s perspective, it was normal if Berge\u2019s huge Aura overwhelmed Roman, but whenever Roman and his sword collided, Berge\u2019s Aura shrunk further.And it was then that Berge found out. According to the rumors, the existence in front of him was known as Dmitry\u2019s Fool.\u2018He is too strong!\u2019Nevertheless, it was too late for regrets. This mission\u2014He thought it was easy money. However, the variable, Roman, who suddenly appeared and whom they didn\u2019t expect to come, was causing a different result to emerge.Slash!The brilliant sword created a line of blood on Berge\u2019s neck, and eventually, his body fell to his knees.Thud.Berge\u2014An A-class mercenary recognized by the entire kingdom could only last less than 10 seconds against Roman. Truly, it was a fleeting moment.Berge\u2019s death was an outstanding achievement. Roman took down an A-class mercenary. However, it wasn\u2019t much of a surprise to those who knew the truth about him.\u2018I am not the Heavenly Demon in this world.\u2019When he was the Heavenly Demon, not even the most talented people in Murim would dare to face him. From a single attack of Baek Joong-hyuk, even the sect leaders would collapse. And in this way, Baek Joong-hyuk managed to unify Murim.However, this world was a different one. In this world, Roman is weak. Although he developed rapidly and grew to a level that overwhelmed Berge this soon, it wasn\u2019t nearly enough to fill his quench.Srrng.His Aura burned from the vertex to the bottom. In a situation where normal people would feel a sense of shock, Roman was ready to take on a new challenge.A new world, a new strength\u2014If he could conquer all that with this small body, it would be really cool.Roman moved ahead. Seeing that he didn\u2019t stop even for a while after defeating Berge, Viscount Barco groaned, \u201cKill! Kill that man!!\u201dBerge\u2019s death\u2014He couldn\u2019t believe it at all. It wasn\u2019t that the two of them were fighting equally. It was more like Berge, who tried to make a surprise attack, got killed without even being able to do anything. Moreover, that wasn\u2019t the end of it\u2014Even though Roman had slaughtered several soldiers before that, his breathing was still calm.A monster\u2014He was an overwhelming monster.A path had opened due to Roman\u2019s actions, and if things continued like this, it was only a matter of time before the siege weapon would be destroyed. Thus, he had to be stopped.He shouted at the soldiers to stop him, but contrary to Viscount Berco\u2019s intentions, he was being pulled back.\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous, Viscount!\u201d\u201cWe need to get you to shelter!\u201dThe knights of Barco eventually took Viscount Barco away with them. At first, they had planned to subdue Roman, as well, but after seeing the mercenaries\u2019 captain\u2019s death, they changed their minds. It was still a fight where Barco had the advantage. Thus, they didn\u2019t want to risk their life by fighting Roman because retreating the troops attacking the wall would give them an edge.The path was finally open. No one was rushing toward Roman anymore. He humbly moved ahead, and before he knew it, the Flare was in front of him.\u2018Flare.\u2019It\u2019s a magic device not found in Murim. Aside from the bullets fired, which cost a lot of gold, the body itself is specially crafted to fire magic bullets.Thus, the goal of this plan is the Flare. If this thing is destroyed, even Barco wouldn\u2019t think of attacking Lawrence\u2019s wall.\u2018Heavenly Demon God Art.\u2019Srrng!Mana rose up from within his body. The Flare\u2019s body is protected with magic. As it cannot be taken down with a normal hit, the mana which had been sleeping in Roman\u2019s dantian was awakened and manifested on his sword. It was a black Aura\u2014The power of the Heavenly Demon.\u2018Heavenly Demon Sword Technique; First Move.\u2019With one attack, and a single move,Kwang!Rumble!There was a roar, and the massive body of the Flare instantly split in two. Seeing the overwhelming sight, for a moment, everyone on the battlefield held their breath.At that moment, Roman shouted with mana raising his voice, \u201cListen, Lawrence! I, Roman Dmitry, have destroyed Barco\u2019s siege weapon!\u201dHearing those words, the atmosphere on the battlefield changed completely. Barco\u2019s soldiers\u2014The ones fighting with their lives on the frontlines, who didn\u2019t know what was happening behind, were shocked.Roman\u2019s words were true.Hearing that their siege weapon was destroyed, they all looked shockingly at the enemies in front of them.\u201cW-what?\u201d\u201cT-the Flare was destroyed?\u2019It was embarrassing. The destruction of Flare could be interpreted to mean that Barco\u2019s rear was in danger. And thus, the steps that were earlier hurrying toward the gate stopped. Barco\u2019s knights, who grasped the situation, saw that the Flare was really broken and ordered a retreat.\u201cRetreat!\u201d\u201cEveryone step back!\u201dTheir feet moved hurriedly. Viscount Barco\u2014Their lord must be in danger now. It was more important to protect Viscount Barco now, rather than capturing Lawrence.The situation developed quickly. At Barco\u2019s retreat, Lawrence\u2019s soldiers who survived the desperate crisis looked at each other bewildered, unable to understand the current circumstances.Also, standing on the fortress wall, Flora looked at Roman, startled.\u201c\u2026He really did it?\u201dA situation she thought was impossible\u2014This time, as well, Roman had done something beyond Flora\u2019s common sense.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45 - Participation In The War (3)The destruction of Flare was a sign of retreat. Roman and his men withdrew as quickly as they appeared and became dogs chasing chickens for Barco\u2019s men.\u201cHuff\u2026 Huff\u2026\u201dWith the current series of situations, Chris let out a shaky breath and reached for his chin. His condition was a complete mess. He was frantically swinging his sword to follow Roman, and Barco\u2019s men running behind him were being cut down constantly. That\u2019s why his golden hair, which looked like a nobleman\u2019s, was now soaked in blood.Chris wiped away the droplets, whether they were sweat or blood, and laughed.\u2019I am sure now\u2014My liege\u2019s method was right.\u2019In this battle, Chris was using his Aura differently than earlier. In this world, it was normal to maximize the power of the Aura with an explosive force, but after dealing with Roman, he realized that maximizing Aura wasn\u2019t the correct answer. Thus, after much thought, he reduced the size of his Aura.Instead, he tried to condense the Aura as much as possible, and thanks to that, the mana consumption wasn\u2019t too much in such a battle. Eventually, he started laughing even more\u2014Despite being ignored by those around him as to why he was following Roman, Chris was slowly finding the possibility of growth.He calmed his breathing. And as he looked around, Chris found everyone\u2019s condition was a mess.\u201cHuff, huff, huff\u2026\u201d\u201cI might really die.\u201d\u201cWahh\u2026\u201dRoman\u2019s soldiers\u2014They all fell to the ground and lay down.A person like Chris was about to follow the pace of Roman, but the others had to clench their teeth just to not get left behind. The duration of the battle was short. However, the extremely intense battle completely depleted their stamina, and some of those who fell to the ground even puked. Fortunately, no one had died. Of all the soldiers, no one was left behind, and no one seemed seriously injured either. They knew it\u2014Why they were able to survive. Although all the soldiers had troubled faces, they couldn\u2019t take their eyes off Roman, who was standing alone.\u2018Isn\u2019t he tired?\u2019\u2018He is a monster for real!\u2019Roman\u2014He hadn\u2019t even stopped to breathe. Even though he took the lead and was obviously in a dangerous situation, he didn\u2019t even seem to be gasping for air. And such a sight terrified them. Roman had slaughtered more than a dozen soldiers by himself, and even when the mercenaries\u2019 captain, who was extremely skilled, fought with him, Roman dealt with him as if he was dealing with a regular soldier.A monster\u2014There was no other way to express him. They had already experienced Roman\u2019s strength in private, but today\u2019s battle gave them a different perspective\u2014beyond common sense.They were all in awe at Roman\u2019s existence. The soldiers looked up at Roman, drenched in blood. Rather than appearing cruel, the fact that their lord was so strong made them feel good.When everyone\u2019s condition stabled, Roman said, \u201cOur role is over. Now, let\u2019s head back to Lawrence.\u201dTime to head back\u2014As a hero who heralded a triumph, now it was his turn to return to a homecoming.Thud.The gates were opened.At the sight of Roman and his soldiers entering dignifiedly, the people of Lawrence, who were lined up on both sides of the gate, cheered.\u201cWaahhhhh!\u201d\u201cRoman! Roman!\u201d\u201cRoman! Roman!\u201d\u201cHero of Dmitry!\u201dNow, Roman\u2019s reputation had changed. Seeing Roman Dmitry, who was once known as Dmitry\u2019s Fool, people cheered as if they were welcoming a great man. They couldn\u2019t help it. Their perception hadn\u2019t changed due to this incident alone. At least in Lawrence, their perception of Roman was changing little by little due to the subjugation of Blood Fang.Hero of Dmitry\u2014A fitting expression. Appearing like a prince riding on a white horse and destroying the Flare had left a strong impression on the people of Lawrence.\u201cThanks to you, we live! Thank you very much!\u201d\u201cFrom now, Lawrence will never forget the grace of Roman Dmitry!\u201d\u201cI love you!\u201dWomen were screaming. Viscount Lawrence smiled bitterly at the sight of them crowding into the streets just to touch Roman.\u2018It\u2019s unfortunate.\u2019Roman\u2014A man with outstanding talent. From the moment they first met, he knew that Roman was an unusual one, but today\u2019s scene of destroying the Flare proved to be a greater talent than he had ever imagined.It was far away, so he couldn\u2019t see it clearly, but he did see the scene of Barco\u2019s soldiers being slaughtered, and the Aura which destroyed the Flare.Dmitry had given birth to a tiger. And if things hadn\u2019t gone wrong, that tiger would have been his son-in-law.He gulped. Seeing Roman Dmitry\u2019s imposing gait made him thirsty, but Viscount Lawrence struggled to turn away from the new reality.\u2018I promised to respect the life choices of Flora. No matter how attractive and coveting Roman may be, marrying him is a choice Flora should have. Thus, I will not try to push her to marry him.\u2019He suppressed his desire. And when he saw Roman approaching in front of him, he greeted him with a smile.\u201cHero of Dmitry! Nice to see you again!\u201d\u2014It was a brief welcome ceremony. The war wasn\u2019t over yet, and Roman walked into the gates facing the cheers and applause of people.Just then, from behind him, a familiar voice was heard.\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201dIt was Flora. A fierce battle had turned her into a mess. Her skirt was torn, and her face was tanned, but Flora didn\u2019t seem to care.\u201cWe didn\u2019t even act as proper bait, as we had planned. If you abandoned Lawrence, we wouldn\u2019t have even had a right to blame you for it, but I wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heart for not abandoning us in a crisis.\u201dHer face was red. Her first meeting with Roman wasn\u2019t good, so she was a little embarrassed to show her gratitude. Nevertheless, she had to speak. Without that man\u2019s help, Lawrence would have been captured.Roman said calmly, \u201cI just did what I promised. And Lawrence just did what I had expected it to do.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dRoman\u2019s words broke Flora\u2019s heart. He was someone she didn\u2019t know well. She moved a step and thanked the guy, but he coldly drew the line, telling her he was only keeping his side of the promise. Still, she wasn\u2019t angry. No matter what Roman said, it didn\u2019t change the fact that she got help from him. Roman was a benefactor of Lawrence, and Flora was grateful for his decision to help them.\u201cI am glad that Lawrence managed to do what you wanted. You might think you don\u2019t need to be thanked, but as the representative of Lawrence, I need to repay you. So, if you want to say something or want something, you can say it. Even if my father might feel troubled by it, I will unconditionally stand by your side and make sure you get that reward.\u201d\u2014Those were sincere words. By firing arrows from above the wall, Flora understood how difficult war was. Thus, she felt thankful to Roman for saving Lawrence from danger. It must have been a difficult choice to keep his side of the deal until the end.Roman looked at Flora. The height difference between the two was huge, so, naturally, Flora was looking up to him.\u201cLet\u2019s head to the conference room. No matter what I say, if you have no intention to go back on the words of reward, then I will speak comfortably.\u201dLawrence\u2019s conference room\u2014The advisors were gathered there. Viscount Lawrence was sitting at the top, and the vassals of the family were on both sides and were expressing their opinions.\u201cWe need to send a messenger to Barco right now. They have lost their momentum and intention of conducting any more sieges as their Flare was destroyed. Now is our chance. I think it will be a good idea to suggest appropriate conditions and end the war with Barco!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. There are a lot of troops on Barco\u2019s side. Rather than causing a crisis and starting war again, we should bury the past and find peace in this situation. That is the only way Lawrence can survive.\u201dAll the vassals seemed to have the same opinion.Peace\u2014They wanted the war to end already. When they thought of the moment the wall almost collapsed, their legs started shaking, just from the thought of it. Their pride didn\u2019t matter now. They wanted to avoid the next battle as they confirmed what Barco\u2019s power was like.Viscount Lawrence said, \u201cYour opinions are correct. Although we were able to win the first battle with the help of Roman Dmitry, Lawrence\u2019s strength will not be enough to stop the attacks of Barco. So prepare the messenger now\u2014\u201d\u201cCan I speak?\u201d Roman asked.Normally, the vassals would have been angry in the current situation, but now, they were too shocked by the achievements that man had made.In Lawrence\u2019s meeting, actually, Roman had only attended as a courtesy, but was not in a position to argue over what Lawrence was supposed to do.\u201cSpeak up.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dRoman stood up. With everyone\u2019s attention focused on him, he slowly walked around the table and opened his mouth.\u201cLooking at the siege from Barco, I think Viscount Lawrence knows exactly what advantages we have if we extend the war. Barco is probably under massive financial pressure right now. They have to get Lawrence under any situation to pay off their huge debt, and that turned worse when their Flare was destroyed. If we send a messenger for the sake of peace, I dare to expect that in exchange, we will only receive the head of the person and not a message of peace.\u201d\u201cAhem.\u201d\u00a0Everyone coughed.Although they struggled to run from it, it was the reality. As Roman said, Barco wouldn\u2019t accept peace.\u201cActually, that isn\u2019t even the point.\u201d Roman\u2019s voice changed. The hoarse voice felt suffocating to the vassals.\u201cBarco falsified the documents and attacked Lawrence, and many people had to die despite Lawrence not being at fault. And even now, the soldiers are carrying corpses of their friends and family from outside the wall. Can\u2019t you feel anything when you look at it? We cannot forgive Barco. In order to live a peaceful life within the wall of Lawrence, we have to show the world how to take revenge on the heinous people who dared to touch Lawrence.\u201dRoman\u2019s speech was an absolute rebuke to the vassals. He was straightforwardly pointing his finger at them, who were acting like cowards.The corpses of your soldiers\u2014Why aren\u2019t you angry after seeing that?!\u2014At Roman\u2019s words brimming with emotions, Lawrence\u2019s vassals felt ashamed.However, only one person\u2014the lord representing Lawrence, felt different.\u201cIt isn\u2019t as if we don\u2019t know that. Obviously, we want revenge, as well. We want Barco to pay for touching Lawrence. However, what about the lack of power we have? Barco has hundreds of soldiers and the Berge mercenaries, as well. Thus, continuing to fight is naught but an act of suicide.\u201dThe lack of power was a cold reality. Even after winning, they couldn\u2019t get their revenge, so Roman said, \u201cOne\u2014We have one way.\u201d At that time, he looked at Flora. As if a drop of water fell into a still lake, it felt as if a big ripple was created within her pupils.\u201cBattle of Great Warriors\u2014That is the only way to get revenge on Barco while ignoring the difference in our forces.\u201dBattle of Great Warriors\u2014A battle to win or lose on behalf of the family.At Roman\u2019s suggestion, the conference room was entirely stunned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46 - Battle Of Great Warriors (1)The atmosphere turned cold instantly.Battle of Great Warriors\u2014Three swordsmen representing the families would fight each other, and the family that won two times would obtain all the glory.At first, reducing the damage an estate would take might look acceptable. However, those who knew the truth about it would never entrust the fate of an estate like that.Thus, Lawrence\u2019s vassals said, \u201cBattle of Great Warriors\u2014That\u2019s good. As long as we are certain that we will win, there is no simpler method other than that. The problem is that we need three people to fight, and they should at least be strong enough to obtain two victories. The opponent is Barco. They have connections with the Central Government and have even borrowed money from the Golden Bank, so they might have invited some skilled people with their personal connections and wealth. The Battle of Great Warriors is ultimately a battle of personal relationships, and their intention will be to lead the situation from the start to gain power on their side. Also, one needs to have trust to make it work.\u201dThere was no law that the ones participating had to be from the family. Usually, outside experts were often invited. Thus, Lawrence had no choice but to worry about such variables.In the first place, the difference in power was too high. Like Dmitry, Barco had a 3-Star Knight, but Lawrence had only one 2-Star Knight. Moreover, they hadn\u2019t even revealed their full power yet, so how can they accept the battle?Also,\u201cRoman, Thank you for your help. Barco\u2019s siege weapon has been destroyed, thanks to you. For Barco, it is a situation in which they have no choice but to wait longer to capture us, and as time goes on, the situation turns more favorable for us. It is only a matter of time. Even if it is difficult, Lawrence will be able to survive if we choose to sit down, but we cannot know how the situation will turn if we accept your proposal. The Battle of Great Warriors is a disaster. If Barco wins the battle and wants Lawrence\u2019s land as a reward, we will have to give it up without even saying anything.\u201dThe other vassals nodded their heads in agreement. What they were concerned about was the variable. They finally had a chance in this war, so they didn\u2019t want to ruin the situation by accepting the battle for nothing. It was understandable. The judgment Lawrence came to was right. However, this was also why they were the docile prey, and despite their fertile lands, they never lived as predators.Roman said, \u201cI understand what you mean. However, as I said, there is no better way than to opt for it, as long as we are sure we will win. From now on, I will give you that assurance.\u201d3 fights, 3 wins\u2014Although it is a fight that emphasizes the existence of three people, the Battle of the Great Warriors is actually decided by two powerful people.\u201cBarco and Lawrence\u2014Let\u2019s think of the opponent and the number of cases we can choose from. First, Barco. I can think of a 3-Star swordsman and an expert from outside as their winning card. As Barco, who spent a lot of money for the Flare, they cannot possibly acquire 3 skilled people from outside now. Then, on the contrary, who is there for us to choose?\u201dPeople thought, and only one name came to their mind\u2014Roman Dmitry.\u201cI will represent Lawrence in the first match. Whether the opponent is a knight of Barco or an outside expert, I am sure I can win. Then, the other side will surely begin to get antsy, and in the second confrontation, they will have no choice but to send out their best warrior. Also, the Battle of Great Warriors is a battle many witness. No matter how great one is, if they win one battle and lose two instead, it is meaningless to continue any further. Furthermore, my man, Chris, will finish it off. Even if his opponent is a 3-Star Knight, Chris is strong enough to bring us victory.\u201dRoman\u2019s words felt reasonable. However, it wasn\u2019t a perfect operation. If Roman lost to an unknown man, the fight would end without a second thought.\u201cDo you think that I will lose?\u201dNevertheless, no one could object to Roman\u2019s words.Roman\u2019s appearance when he attacked Barco\u2019s rear and cut off the head of Berge Mercenaries\u2019 captain left everyone overwhelmed in his mighty presence.He will win.\u2014They were certain of it because of Roman\u2019s skills.\u201cThen, in that case, we will have one win. Isn\u2019t that a pretty nice result? Given the situation, if we can tackle them in the right way, we can restore the reputation of Lawrence, which has fallen to the ground, by winning the Battle of Great Warriors. I will not try to convince you anymore. This is all I can do to help; now, you have to decide.\u201dAt that moment, everyone\u2019s gaze turned to one person\u2014Flora. The previous incidents had given her a voice in the room.Roman had only spoken after he grasped the situation logically. He boldly pointed out the reality, and drew the other party\u2019s consent. It was the same today, as well.As all of the vassals went silent, Flora suddenly remembered her conversation with Roman.[It\u2019s simple\u2014Sacrifice for my plan. If the Lawrence family shows their willingness to be the first to bleed and lays down the plates, I will do my best to help you. This is a promise in the name of Roman Dmitry. In order for our conversation to go forward, this promise needs to be made.]What he said back then\u2014Roman wished for Lawrence to sacrifice for his plans. For his personal revenge, he hoped for the Lawrence estate to bleed. And, honestly, it hadn\u2019t changed even now. On the surface, it looked like he was doing something for Lawrence, but this time, as well, he was forcing Lawrence to sacrifice themselves.\u2018He is a dangerous person.\u2019Roman\u2019s plan has loopholes in it. What if\u2014Barco hires a person strong enough to defeat Roman, or if all three warriors are experts from outside? Obviously, Lawrence will be defeated. That is the worst case, and Lawrence will be unable to fix themselves if that happens. Of course, the chances of it happening are slim. Barco not bringing out the Flare from the start thoroughly proved the fact that the financial consumption was massive, and they were also putting their everything into this war.Just two warriors\u2014Barco\u2019s best bet is to prepare two strong warriors.Actually, if what Roman said is true, then as he said, it is possible to defeat Barco without much damage through a Battle of Great Warriors.The problem is\u2026\u2019Roman is whispering sweet words to us now. An expert like him who defeated Berge will become the Great Warrior, so Lawrence should take care of any unforeseen variables. How do I do this? If we choose to sit down, we will eventually survive, even if it takes a long time, but it is clear that it will be a choice that will set Lawrence a step back. Barco and Lawrence\u2014both families are bound to become unhappy. However, if we accept Roman\u2019s proposal and win, the glory of victory will come to Roman, and not Lawrence, even if we take minimal damage.\u2019It tasted bitter to her\u2014Roman was a sly fox. Knowing that Lawrence wasn\u2019t in a situation where they could make another choice, he was using that to his advantage\u2014To get maximum benefit in any situation. Moreover, he wasn\u2019t even trying to hide that.\u2018Rather, it is ironic that we can trust him because we can see his dark nature. Seriously, Roman Dmitry, you damned bastard.\u2019Being thankful that he helped?\u2014That was only for a moment. As Roman said, this was a deal. For the benefit of Roman and Lawrence, this was a direct negotiation.Flora said, \u201cI am in favor of the Battle of Great Warriors. If there is a way to end this war quickly, I think it is necessary for us to take a gamble.\u201dShe turned her gaze from Roman, knowing his intentions. That was the only thing Flora could give Roman now.At the same time, somewhere else, the Barco family was in an uproar.\u201cThat fucking Roman Dmitry showed up! What the hell was he thinking while interfering with our work? Aahhh!\u201dThwak!Viscount Barco, whose face was flushed red in anger, smashed everything around him. He flipped the desk and kicked the chairs. Although he revealed his violent nature, Viscount Barco\u2019s anger didn\u2019t subside even a single bit.\u201cUghhhh!\u201d\u00a0He exhaled harshly.As he sat down on the chair and looked at the grey ceiling of the barrack, he could see the reality of Barco.\u2018How do I resolve this situation? As the Flare was destroyed, we lost our method to end this war in a short time. The Berge mercenaries have lost their will to fight due to the death of their captain, and the risk is too great if we try to rent a Flare again. The money borrowed from the Golden Blank is for emergencies. If I use it and the plan doesn\u2019t work, then the Barco family will be over for real.\u2019It looked bleak.Roman Dmitry\u2014Every time he remembered the moment that man had cut off the head of Berge, he felt overwhelmed. At first, it looked like a barbaric plan as they approached from afar, but when Roman\u2019s sword flashed, dozens of soldiers died without even getting a chance to scream.Also, at the appearance of Berge, who rushed with enthusiasm\u2014Viscount Barco, who had put his hopes on the A-class mercenary recognized by the entire kingdom, felt everything change.Just how? Why did this happen?\u2019There is only one way to resolve this situation\u2014The Battle of Great Warriors. However, there is no reason for Lawrence to accept that. Obviously, there is no need for them to gamble when they can get a sure victory.\u2019His mouth felt dry. It felt like his head was clogged up. He didn\u2019t know how to change the situation.However, just then, the barrack\u2019s door opened, and a soldier came in with an urgent expression.\u201cLord! Lawrence has sent a messenger!\u201dViscount Barco thought\u2014Lawrence must have sent the messenger to show off their lead as this is the end.\u00a0Thus, he decided to cut off the messenger\u2019s head.It is widely known that a messenger must be spared, not killed. However, Viscount Barco was blinded by his anger. Nevertheless, hearing the messenger\u2019s words, he was stunned.\u201cLawrence proposes Barco to hold a Battle of Great Warriors.\u201dBattle of Great Warriors\u2014Hearing that, instantly, he almost laughed. Still, he managed to suppress it.He has been thinking of how to propose the Battle of Great Warriors to Lawrence until now. However, he would never have imagined, even in his wildest dreams, that Lawrence would make the proposal first.\u2018Lawrence is digging their own grave!\u2019The opponent didn\u2019t know about Barco\u2019s plans. The Golden Bank had lent them much more money than they had expected. Thus, the remaining money was reserved for situations like the current one.If\u2014Even if Lawrence had chosen to reject the Battle of Great Warriors, Viscount Barco would have considered renting the Flare again. However, there was no need to do that now. The opponent had dug their own grave. Even Roman\u2019s presence wasn\u2019t a concern anymore. Roman\u2019s strength was truly overwhelming, but Viscount Barco\u2019s plan to win was something beyond common sense.Thus, he sent back the messenger saying he would think about it and immediately summoned his people and gave orders.\u201cGo and call \u2018him\u2019 right now! I will send a down payment, so ask him to join as our great warrior.\u201dHis mind was at peace. The end of the war was already in his sight. In a nutshell, the Battle of Great Warriors will be won by his side within two matches.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47 - Battle Of Great Warriors (2)Both sides agreed, and the Battle of Great Warriors was decided.Lawrence opened their gates and came out, and Barco came forward with his men as they faced each other. The situation was accomplished within a week of sending the messenger. The judge had come down from the capital, as well. He spoke in a deep voice, with everyone\u2019s attention focused on him, \u201cMy name is Count Ertes. The battle between the Barco and Lawrence families will be held from this point onward. Also, the two families will have to bring up their 3 swordsmen to represent the family and submit the lineup in 30 minutes. The Battle of Great Warriors is a sacred event blessed by Valhalla. Regardless of the outcome, both families must obey it, and if a family violates it, they will be judged according to the rules of the Cairo Kingdom.\u201dCount Ertes\u2014Dressed in a neat robe that didn\u2019t match the surrounding land, he was someone sent by the Central Government to judge this confrontation.In the Battle of the Great Warriors, the authority of the person in charge is extremely important. Therefore, as soon as the two sides came to an agreement, the Central Government was informed, and Count Ertes took steps forward.Tak.Count Ertes sat down at the table that was prepared beforehand. The servants made shade for him, and he sipped wine with a relaxed face as he waited.Both of the sides\u2014Barco and Lawrence, were busy moving. It was to write the lineup.However, watching Barco\u2019s movements, Roman suddenly said, \u201cI think we need to change the lineup.\u201d\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d Viscount Lawrence was shocked. Lawrence had already thought of a lineup when the Battle of Great Warriors was decided a week back\u2014They planned to place Roman in the lead, Lawrence\u2019s knight second, and Chris at the end for the matches. That would finish the battle efficiently.However, Barco\u2019s movements were unusual. It is said that the distance from the capital to Lawrence is quite far. Still, in an era when magic devices such as the teleport circle were already developed, it took Count Ertes a whole week to arrive at Lawrence.It was bizarre. It would\u2019ve been natural for Barco to be under pressure due to the high-interest rate as time went on. However, they didn\u2019t appear to be impatient in the slightest.\u201cIt appears that the Barco family deliberately delayed the time. For them, it would have taken time to invite an outside expert. The network of the Central Government has the power to make it possible. Also, the fact that the confrontation is taking place a week later can be interpreted as meaning that they are fully prepared.\u201d\u201cThen, they must have decided to send the outside expert as the vanguard.\u201d\u201cNot really.\u201dRoman\u2019s gaze turned to Barco\u2019s camp. Unlike Lawrence\u2019s side, which was bustling, it seemed they had already made their decision.\u201cBarco has no intention of sending out an outside expert as their vanguard. Had that been the case, they would have taken action to entice us to send out our strongest warrior, as well. That is the best strategy they could\u2019ve used, and if that\u2019s the case, we need to make a lineup that is the best, based on our enemies.\u201d\u201cSo, what is the solution?\u201d\u201cChris will be the vanguard and secure one win for us. After that, I will go second, against the card Barco has prepared.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dEveryone was stunned. The secret weapon Barco prepared\u2014Obviously, he wouldn\u2019t be an easy match; however, Roman said he would take the risk. They couldn\u2019t understand his decision.Why is he doing this?\u2014Lawrence was a bit shocked. Roman risked his life for other people. Unlike Flora, those who didn\u2019t know Roman\u2019s inner feelings couldn\u2019t help but feel moved by Roman\u2019s decision.Viscount Lawrence said, \u201cI will never forget the grace you have shown to Lawrence. If the Lawrence family wins this Battle of Great Warriors and overcomes the crisis of extinction, we will treat Roman Dmitry as our distinguished guest for the rest of our lives in Lawrence.\u201dExcept for Flora, everyone showed their respect for Roman.The time has come.Barco didn\u2019t think for long and immediately revealed the appearance of the swordsman who would take the lead.\u201cI am Janson, representing Barco.\u201dJanson\u2014People roared at the name they had heard. Janson was a 3-Star swordsman that Barco was proud of and one of the most talented people in the North-East region of Cairo.On the contrary, Lawrence\u2019s representative was humble.\u201cI am Chris, representing Lawrence.\u201dChris\u2014He walked in with a sullen face.People in this place recognized Chris\u2019 face. A disciple of Jonathan, who is said to have better talent than Janson. Also, he was a handsome genius swordsman and the greatest genius in the North-East region.Nevertheless, the problem was that the current battle wasn\u2019t a place to compete for future possibilities. Chris may have the upper hand in terms of young age and talent, but at the current level, it was still a match between a 2-Star Knight and a 3-Star Knight.Aura difference\u2014It was an area that couldn\u2019t be narrowed down merely with swordsmanship skills. Those who live in the realm of common sense naturally thought Chris would have a difficult time.\u201cWhy did they let Chris go?\u201d\u201cThe talent will die.\u201d\u201cThis is something Dmitry will surely regret. Dmitry\u2019s talent will die in Lawrence\u2019s fight.\u201dChris was hearing everyone\u2019s reactions toward the match. He knew he had a disadvantage here, but he didn\u2019t think much while agreeing to go into battle.The reason was simple.\u2018My liege told me to do this. I will do whatever I can to win this match.\u2019Roman\u2019s words\u2014For that sole reason, he decided to go into battle without a second thought. Among the rankers, there were some masters who overcame the difference in Aura and ranked higher. However, they were referred to as exceptions as they were actually special.They were beyond common sense. Roman had said that Chris could defeat a 3-Star swordsman by going beyond common sense, as well. Therefore, Chris accepted the situation in front of him without a second thought.The day Chris fought with Kevin, he turned from an insignificant child into a wild dog solely through Roman\u2019s teachings. That day, Chris put his blind trust in Roman.He believed\u2014Roman is absolute.Even if he died out there, Chris would not regret it.\u2018To be strong, one needs to take risks. That is why I left the well and decided to follow my liege.\u2019He met Janson\u2014Barco\u2019s Master, whom he had heard countless rumors about. He looked strong. So, Chris smiled. If he manages to defeat Janson, then his choice is right.At that moment, the signal was given.\u201cStart!\u201dTak!Who moved first didn\u2019t matter. Both Janson and Chris ran toward each other. Also, the public opinion wasn\u2019t wrong. Obviously, Janson was quick. An Aura exploded from his sword, and he swung his sword, intending to kill Chris at once.Whoosh.Due to an instantaneous movement, Chris dodged it. Furthermore, he tried to attack Janson\u2019s gaps which he found after he stepped to the side, but Janson didn\u2019t retrieve the sword and moved to attack him again.His eyes flashed. The Aura on his sword made Chris feel his mouth go dry. He understood he would die the moment he got hit by it. Naturally, Chris quickly stepped back. Rather than giving and receiving attacks properly, he focused on evading his opponent\u2019s attacks.\u201cYou bastard! How long are you planning on running away?\u201d Janson growled. He wanted to induce Chris into fighting head-on, but Chris did not lose his composure until the end.3-Star Aura versus 2-Star Aura\u2014A direct confrontation would certainly result in death. Thus, Chris had thrown his pride out the door long back. Even if the appearance of running away was ferocious, he avoided the opponent\u2019s attack efficiently.\u2019When I fought against my liege for the first time, he defeated me without even using Aura. On that day, when I received a humiliating defeat in front of everyone, I learned one thing\u2014No matter how powerful one\u2019s Aura is, for the attack to be meaningful, it must hit the enemy.\u2019Avoid it. Avoid and dodge it again\u2014As Janson said, Chris was avoiding all his attacks like a rat. Still, he stabbed his sword toward Janson whenever he saw a gap.Uk!With one hit, blood spilled on Janson\u2019s face. Honestly, it was just a scratch, but the fact that his opponent had attacked him successfully first made it hard for Janson to accept the truth.\u201cYou bastard!\u201dRumble.Aura emerged on his sword. A 3-Star Aura swelled. From that point onward, it was not a problem that could simply be solved by avoiding it.The sword, which currently boasted a 3-Star Aura, split the space, and as a result, an area wider than the sword was swept away.Clearly, the class of a 3-Star Aura was different.Seeing the Aura split the space, Chris took a deep breath.Kwang!\u201cKuak!\u201dAnd then, he coughed up blood. Even though he defended himself and the Aura only grazed him, it felt like his insides were being intertwined. Honestly, this result was natural. People value the distinction highly because even if one fights well 99 times, just being hit once by a higher Aura was enough for one to lose.Chris staggered a little. And Janson, who saw it, pushed ahead. He was moving rather fast as he wanted to end this already, and if things continued like this, it was only a matter of time before Janson would cut down Chris\u2019 throat.\u2018Damn it!\u2019Chris was different from Roman. Roman had monster-like skills that overwhelmed the opponent, even if he was put in the same situation as himself; however, Chris was someone who hadn\u2019t yet grown to the stage where others would refer to him as special.His insides were burning. He thought that maybe he was a bird whose legs got torn while following the stork in front of him. Still, he didn\u2019t want to die.This is so messed up.Till now, he hadn\u2019t learned anything from Roman. His companions in the Dmitry Knights had laughed at his choice to follow Roman. However, he chose to ignore their words and gazes, and followed Roman. Therefore, he couldn\u2019t die in vain.Isn\u2019t this too sloppy?If he died like this, Chris wouldn\u2019t even be able to face his colleagues in the afterlife.\u2018Go beyond the common senses of the world.\u2019Roman once asked him\u2014Why do you use the Aura like that?His common sense had been broken when he learned how inefficient the current methods were, but for some reason, he was clinging to them. Honestly, he had no choice but to do so. His mentor, Jonathan, and even Emperor Alexander, the first Aura Swordsman, trained in the same way as him.It takes courage to go beyond common sense.And now, Chris, facing Janson\u2019s Aura, thought of Roman.\u2018The indiscriminate burst of mana cannot be used to reach 100% of the power of Aura. Just as my liege showed tremendous power with a single, concentrated burst of mana in the process of destroying the Flare, I will also concentrate the power of Aura at a single point.\u2019Gulp.He gulped at his decision. This was a crossroads for him. In front of him, he could see Janson running, resembling a reaper.\u201cDie!\u201dHe swung his sword\u2014That action seemed incredible. He had a firm conviction that Chris, knowing his own strength, wouldn\u2019t face him head-on.Nevertheless, Chris raised his mana. Rather than exploding it out like others, he was using what he learned from Roman\u2014He was condensing his Aura.Srrng.Aura emerged on his sword. However, the size of the Aura was small.Janson smirked, being sure of his victory.However,Kaang!\u201c\u2026!?\u201dWhen their swords clashed, Chris\u2019 Aura wasn\u2019t destroyed. While burning intensely, it withstood his opponent\u2019s attack\u2014And that was a variable Janson couldn\u2019t have imagined in his wildest dreams.And at that moment,Flash.Slash!Mana exploded.In response to Chris\u2019s quick attack, his main specialty, the sword moved ahead and blew off Janson\u2019s head.Puak!His blood splattered, and seeing Janson\u2019s head floating in the sky, the eyes of the audience were dyed with astonishment.The winner of the first fight was Chris.Tuk.Roll.Eventually, Janson\u2019s head fell down and rolled on the ground. Those who looked at it were still unable to understand the reality they had witnessed.\u2018This is insane.\u2019\u2018A 3-Star swordsman was defeated by a 2-Star swordsman?\u2019\u2018Nonsense!\u2019This was beyond common sense. And it was a shocking result, as well.Chris wiped the blood off his sword with a pale face as the soldiers of Lawrence cheered.\u201cWoahhhh!!!\u201d\u201cInsane!\u201d\u201cChris! Chris!\u201d\u201cChris! Chris!\u201dThere was an uproar. It was odd\u2014The match Barco was expected to win had been won by Chris.Now, they needed just another win. At the thought that they had driven Barco into a corner, the soldiers of Lawrence cheered as if they had already won.Seeing this situation, Viscount Barco was bewildered.\u2019\u2026Janson lost. With this, the winning strategy I had thought of has gone down the drain. If Janson had won, the battle would have been finished with the second match; however, now, the third match is also important.\u2019It was absurd. Still, he wasn\u2019t worried about winning or losing the second match. It was natural. If he couldn\u2019t completely trust the card of victory he held, he wouldn\u2019t have spent a huge amount of money on it.Just then, one person stepped forward as if he didn\u2019t even care about Janson\u2019s defeat. Appearing in front of people, he put his hand on the sword as he revealed his name with a smile.\u201cI am Homer, representing Barco.\u201dHomer\u2014Hearing his name, Lawrence\u2019s soldiers, who had been celebrating their victory until now, were shocked.\u201cH-Homer\u2014Did he just say he is Homer?\u201d\u201cGasp!\u201d\u201cWhy is Homer here?\u201dHe was a ranking individual.Valhalla\u2019s ranking is based on reliable data, is updated every year, and is also known to people of the continent.Homer was a 4-Star swordsman and was also ranked as the 49th strongest in the kingdom.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48 - Battle Of Great Warriors (3)The Rankings originated from the Valhalla Empire. Nestled at the southern tip of the continent, they created their own culture in the barren and closed-up environment surrounded by jungle. Valhalla is known as the Holy Land of Warriors. The people of Valhalla risked their lives to go to the afterlife, where blessings were given to those who died fighting with honor.In particular, the people of the Valhalla Empire hold a coming-of-age ceremony for children in which they deal with monsters regardless of their gender. They are a fairly aggressive nation where the parents are happy if their children win the fight, even if it means being crippled afterward.Valhalla\u2014They always want to prove their power. They don\u2019t just end a battle with who won against whom, but even go so far as to document the results and decide who was the strongest. That was how Rankings began. At first, it was simply a culture within Valhalla, but as it became an Empire, the culture of the Rankings spread throughout the continent.The Rankings of Valhalla\u2014They were organized with evidence, and even the Cairo Kingdom had their own top 100 listed, as well.Rank 49, Homer\u2014Obviously, his appearance was bound to be shocking.\u2018I can\u2019t believe Barco recruited \u2018The Wandering Swordsman\u2019 for the Battle of Great Warriors.\u2019Viscount Lawrence looked as if he was in despair.The Wandering Swordsman\u2014No one in Cairo was unaware of his fame. Homer was an A-class mercenary, just like Berge; however, unlike Berge, who built his reputation with a group, he was a one-man army. The reason he was known as \u2018The Wandering Swordsman\u2019 is because he enjoyed fighting the strong while wandering around the kingdom by himself. As a 3-Star swordsman, Homer built a reputation through numerous duels and achieved the 49th rank in the Rankings\u2014That was his story.Naturally, Viscount Lawrence had to be concerned. Homer recently went against a 4-Star swordsman who was known as the 30th Ranker. It is publicly known that Homer lost the fight; however, there were rumors that at the end of the duel, he reached enlightenment and progressed one step ahead\u20144-Star. The news of Homer reaching 4-Star struck the kingdom like lightning. Everyone wanted to recruit a 4 Star, and thus, Homer\u2019s value skyrocketed. That was who Homer was. And now, he appeared here\u2014in the Battle of Great Warriors.Even if it was the Homer of the past, he was enough to make many people walk away. However, the current Homer was like an undefeatable swordsman for them.Instantly, the atmosphere changed. People unknowingly checked someone\u2019s face at that time, even though no one had told them to. Yes, they checked on Roman Dmitry. Even in the current situation, he only looked curious.Lawrence\u2019s warrior, who will face Homer, will definitely die\u2014That was what people assumed. They thought Roman Dmitry would pull out a white flag and run away.Roman didn\u2019t know who Homer was. However, regardless of the reaction of others, he understood Homer was strong.\u2018This is fun.\u2019\u00a0He smiled.This is why life is unpredictable.Roman had earlier investigated Barco\u2019s actions through the Intelligence Guild and discovered they had borrowed money from the Golden Bank to hire the Berge mercenaries. That was all the information revealed to Roman. With Roman\u2019s current ability, he couldn\u2019t manage to know about the 30% of the forces Barco had kept hidden, and the day for battle had dawned just like that.And now, Barco showed the hidden 30% power. Honestly, it was more than 30%. Not only did they receive enough money to rent a Flare, but they even went ahead and bought a 4-Star swordsman.\u2018If I had dealt with the demons for information warfare of some sort like this, perhaps my throat would have blown away without even being able to put up a decent fight. However, that will not happen with Barco. Just as the opponent hid the power, they, too, don\u2019t know what kind of existence I am.\u2019Before the war, Roman made sure he was fully prepared so that there would be no problem even if he met someone strong. He pounded the steel countless times in the forge, and trained himself constantly, as well.Therefore, it was fun\u2014A chance to fight someone strong. If he was strong enough to make people go pale, then he was someone who was suitable to fight him.\u201cI\u2026\u201dIt was time to introduce himself. However, just as he was about to move forward, someone grabbed Roman\u2019s hand.\u201cAbstain.\u201dIt was Flora. Just like Viscount Lawrence, she knew they had fallen into a trap when she discovered Homer would be fighting in the 2nd match.\u201cYour opponent is Homer, who is ranked 49th in the kingdom. Besides, he is no simple ranker; He has become 4-Star and is considered stronger than the 30th rank in the kingdom. Do you think you can beat someone like that? This plan has failed. You asked Lawrence to make a sacrifice, and now it is our turn to pay the price for that variable out there. So, step back. If you abstain, you get to keep your life. And I will earnestly pray that Lawrence\u2019s knight will win a victory in the next duel.\u201dFlora\u2014Her feelings for Roman were complicated. Although Roman was someone she loathed for his selfish desires, she couldn\u2019t let the only person who helped Lawrence die here. This is a battle they will be defeated in. Since Homer had no reason to spare Roman, Flora wanted him to back out beforehand. Even if Roman surrendered with a white flag, no one would blame him.However,\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201dRoman put her hand away.And just when he was about to walk again, Flora cried out, \u201cThen you will die! This is something Lawrence has to handle. There is no reason for you to risk your life here!\u201dClench.He halted his steps and looked at Homer. That man\u2014his attitude showed that he thought he was the best. From the first time Roman saw Homer looking down on others, his desire to win became even more intense than it originally was.\u201cThat\u2019s my choice. I don\u2019t need to explain everything to you, so do not get in my way from now on.\u201dHe spat that out. He didn\u2019t know what expression Flora had. His relationship with her ends here.Roman stepped ahead. Facing Homer, who seemed interested in the situation, he said, \u201cI am Roman Dmitry, representing Lawrence.\u201d\u2014The declaration of a warrior. Now, he could not step back.Flutter.The flag signaled the start.There was no aggressiveness like in the first fight. Neither Homer nor Roman rushed in and waited for the opponent to make the first move.\u2018I can\u2019t believe I have to deal with this little one.\u2019Homer wasn\u2019t too interested in this fight. He heard rumors. The ridiculed fool of Dmitry\u2019s family had subjugated the Blood Fang and intervened in this war, as well. Now, he was someone who had to be evaluated differently. If he had the power to destroy the Flare, then he would have to be a 2-Star swordsman who can use Aura. However, that didn\u2019t attract Homer\u2019s attention.\u2018If it wasn\u2019t for personal reasons, I would have challenged Fernando right away.\u2019Fernando was a 4-Star swordsman. He is the person known as the gatekeeper that guarded the 30th rank. Homer, who was defeated in the fight with that man, had now risen to the level of 4-Star. Now, he had the strength to face Fernando. Homer was preparing for it, but due to the request of the mercenary guild to which he belonged, it got delayed.\u201cHomer, I agreed to take the large sum of money that comes with participating in a single battle in the Battle of Great Warriors of two families. I know you were looking forward to the fight against Fernando, but consider our position. The opponent is the Lawrence family, who doesn\u2019t even have a 3-Star swordsman. It will just be a bland fight for you.\u201dThere was no reason to refuse. Homer didn\u2019t receive a proper mission after getting his A-class mercenary badge. He just wandered around hoping for skilled people to come and fight him, and would take any funds he collected to the guild he was in. It was a give-and-take situation. Homer does what he wants, and the mercenary guild uses his name. As Homer reaching 4-Star was a hot topic, he couldn\u2019t turn away from the earnest request of the guild leader. However, it was really boring\u2014The fact that he came all the way to the outskirts to deal with someone he hadn\u2019t even heard about.\u2018Let\u2019s just end this quickly.\u2019He had no intention of doing his best. He would just do enough for the payment he had taken. Homer slammed the ground and swung his sword at the opponent.Swish!It was swift. For Homer, it was a light movement, but it was nothing like that for normal people. Rankers were beings considered out of the world. People thought Roman wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the attack and would get his throat slashed.However,Kang!The attack was blocked.When Homer immediately took a step ahead and launched another attack, Roman responded without stepping back.Kang!Kakang!In an instant, they exchanged blows. Homer thought that a 3-Star was enough to take down his opponent, but Roman showed no signs of being pushed back even when his sword was coated with Aura. It was absurd. Roman\u2019s sword had such a weak Aura that he doubted if it was truly Aura, but even that was blocking his attacks.\u2018Look at this.\u2019It was strange. Seeing the bizarre situation, his interest in Roman arose. He was curious about how Roman developed his Aura, and for the purpose of testing, Homer raised his Aura even more. Still, his power wasn\u2019t exhausted. With this kind of power, he decided he could take down Roman.Srrng!Rumble.His insides were boiling\u2014It was the mana raging, and then, Aura exploded on his sword; it was a skilled 3-Star swordsman\u2019s Aura to end Roman\u2019s life in an instant. It was an Aura different from Janson\u2019s. While Janson was a swordsman who managed to reach 3-Star, Homer was someone who had gone beyond 3-Star.At that moment, everyone there looked wide-eyed. Due to Homer\u2019s current appearance, they thought Roman was done for.And at that moment,\u201cAhhhh!\u201dHomer shouted ferociously.And when Homer looked at Roman, he just saw Roman staring at him with cold eyes.\u201cTry stopping this.\u201dFlash.My vision?\u2014That was Homer\u2019s last thought.The thought of fighting a 4-Star swordsman was exciting. His blood boiling, Roman thought he would finally have a proper fight after a long time. However, the reality was different. Homer didn\u2019t use his full strength in the fight, and although it could be because he didn\u2019t know his opponent, it was still disrespectful.\u2018I am happy, though.\u2019He could understand Chris\u2019 situation\u2014Both parties had their own reputation.However, Roman\u2019s opponent kept ignoring him despite knowing he was different from his past. That was something Roman couldn\u2019t understand. In a situation where they risk lives, how can they put blind trust in their skills when they don\u2019t even know their opponent?He didn\u2019t feel good. Roman had fully prepared for the match. The Infernal God Art was laid as the foundation for the Heavenly Demon God Art, and now it was possible for him to use the first three moves of Heavenly Demon Sword Technique. Nevertheless, he was still lacking. Even though he was in a situation where he hadn\u2019t recovered even 10% of his actual power, Roman was constantly training to grow.However, Homer looked down on him. Roman didn\u2019t come here to obtain other people\u2019s approval. He was here to fight Homer as a swordsman, and to get his revenge on Barco.Remembering the furnace where he made his weapon, he changed his mind.If the other person looks down on me, then I don\u2019t need to bother drawing out the battle.\u201cHey.\u201dRoman raised his mana. It was different from his opponent\u2019s. Roman\u2019s mana was like a gentle wave, and when it wrapped around the sword, it even absorbed the mana in the surroundings.\u2018Heavenly Demon Sword Technique; Third Move.\u2019The Heavenly Demon Sword Technique has no form. Whoever wields the sword does an anomalous attack that cannot be predicted by the opponent, and its power increases multiple times depending on the user\u2019s movements. It is a martial art that conquered all of Murim.Roman chose to do his best. If Homer survived this attack, he would acknowledge Homer.\u201cTry and stop this.\u201dFlash.And then, the sword was swung.That was the end. Homer didn\u2019t respond. He could only stay in the realization that Roman was attempting an attack. Like that, his sword and body were split simultaneously.Puak!With just one hit\u2014just as it was with Berge, the match was decided in an instant once again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 - Battle Of Great Warriors (4)Chris\u2019 victory was undoubtedly shocking. Gazing at Janson\u2019s head roll on the ground, people accepted the possibility of it happening as Chris was considered one of the most talented swordsmen.Isn\u2019t Chris a disciple of Jonathan?\u00a0It was impossible to understand with common sense, but it seemed possible when they thought about Jonathan\u2019s teachings.However, the true problem was the next match.Chris and Janson\u2019s match somehow made sense, but Homer\u2019s build and appearance made people feel like victory would belong to the other side now. Homer wasn\u2019t a being who could simply be referred to as \u2018strong.\u2019 He was a person who had been on the Rankings even before he achieved 4-Star, and now, the people of Cairo thought that he was worthy of being above the 30th Ranker. He was referred to as the hope of Cairo. However, today, he died. Without even being able to display his 4-Star Aura, which he was famous for now, Roman split his body and sword simultaneously.\u201cH-How did this happen?\u201d\u201cAm I seeing an illusion right now?\u201dPeople were truly astonished. Obviously, they had thought Roman Dmitry would die in this battle. However, even though he knew his opponent was Homer, he did not step back from the fight and went in bravely. Honestly, the audience had thought there was not even a 1% chance that Roman would win. Thus, they could only keep their mouths closed as if someone had sewed them. Ignoring the fact that it was an important battle that would decide which side would win and which would lose, they could only blink their eyes several times to check the reality in front of them.However, there was just one person who was indifferent\u2014Roman. He took the reality in front of him for granted.\u2018A brat who didn\u2019t even reach the peak of his state was acting all arrogant.\u2019Homer\u2019s Aura was strong. For Roman, he was the strongest among all those he had encountered in the Salamander continent; however, Roman\u2019s fundamental evaluation wasn\u2019t based on this world; it was based on his previous one.The Murim he lived in was filled with masters. Unlike Murim, where Baek Joong-hyuk had decided to die despite being the Heavenly Demon, this place felt inefficient.Homer\u2019s attack\u2014while people admired the Aura he displayed, Roman only sighed at it. Thus, the fight ended. Roman was sure of his victory. Homer wasn\u2019t even a worthy opponent for Roman, and his burning desire to win the battle was soon extinguished.Roman said, \u201cJudge, please declare the results.\u201dAnd then, people acknowledged the reality. Roman\u2019s victory after Chris\u2019 meant that the Lawrence family had already secured the qualifications to win. The Battle of Great Warriors consisted of three battles, and whoever won the most was deemed as the winner of the Battle of Great Warriors.Gulp.Chris gulped seeing that. While he was watching the battle between Homer and Roman, his palms were drenched with sweat.\u2019\u2026These are the true skills of my liege.\u2019Honestly, he hadn\u2019t fully grasped the power of Roman yet. When the match started, he understood that Roman\u2019s strength had obviously changed from when he first fought him. Back then, Roman wasn\u2019t someone who could use Aura, but despite Chris using Aura, he suffered a defeat against Roman, who dealt with him purely using only sword techniques. After that, he realized the truth\u2014Roman was dealing with mana in a different manner, and unlike his image as Dmitry\u2019s Fool, he had already reached an unbelievable level. However, the problem wasn\u2019t just him reaching an unbelievable level. Was his growth limited to the strength he used to defeat Chris? Or was there something else he had not revealed back then? Chris didn\u2019t find answers back then.However, a while back, Chris saw the true face of Roman Dmitry. Seeing dozens of soldiers get slaughtered by him single-handedly, he understood\u2014If Roman was in front of him, anything was possible. Honestly, he was still a bit surprised when he saw the 2-Star mercenary, Berge, taken down with a single slash. However, when he saw Homer\u2019s 3-Star Aura cut down, even if it wasn\u2019t 4-Star Aura, he realized how overwhelming Roman and the current situation were. Even Chris, who thought he knew Roman, was shocked by the situation.\u2018Did my liege have such skills when he fought me? Or did he achieve rapid growth after fighting me? I cannot even begin to understand this. In the former case, the lord was clearly not strong enough to overwhelm Homer, and for the latter, the time limit is too short for growth like this. Then, how the hell did this happen?\u2019His mind felt complicated. He didn\u2019t even dare to try and guess it. In 2 months, most humans couldn\u2019t even express a 1-Star Aura; however, in front of him, Roman had grown beyond that standard. Even after defeating Chris, he developed himself. It seemed as if he had gone through Body Reformation. And by showing off his brilliance, he stepped into a realm that Chris hadn\u2019t even dared to enter. Honestly, his growth was so rapid that it couldn\u2019t be found even in Murim. It was only possible because Baek Joong-hyuk, the strongest Heavenly Demon in the world of Murim, was in Roman\u2019s body; thus, people not being able to understand Roman\u2019s growth made sense.\u201cHufffff\u2026\u201d\u00a0Chris took a deep breath. After his victory against Janson, he thought maybe a day would come when he could overcome the wall known as Roman, as well. However, it was an illusion. Now that he had confirmed the true skills of Roman, Chris felt a sense of awe and suffocation.\u2018I guess my thoughts were premature.\u2019He always thought of being loyal only until he surpassed his liege, but now he realized that his thoughts were too hasty.Nevertheless, the fight was over. Obviously, it was Lawrence\u2019s victory. There was nothing else to see, but as Count Ertes, who was in charge of this battle, was there, it was his duty to ensure the victory was announced and the matters were handled properly.\u201cThe Battle of Great Warriors usually has to go through three battles for it to end. Since the winning and losing sides have already been decided with this match, both sides may send out a new warrior under them, if they want to.\u201dIt was leeway for the loser. Since there was no reason to waste his manpower in a battle the other side was sure to win, he gave Barco a chance to keep their pride.However, Viscount Barco couldn\u2019t come to his senses despite those words. From the moment Homer\u2019s body fell and began to bleed out, Viscount Barco felt like the sky had fallen on him1.\u2018It\u2019s over.\u2019\u00a0His mind went blank. For his dispute with Lawrence, he did his best. He deliberately tampered with documents to induce a fight with the Lawrence family, and he spent huge amounts of money in the process and used his connections in the Central Government to summon Count Ertes here. And what was worse was that all that money wasn\u2019t even Barco\u2019s. Unlike Lawrence, who had fertile lands, Dmitry, who collected money due to their mines, Barco wasn\u2019t a wealthy family, and all the money was borrowed from the Golden Bank with collateral.Barco\u2019s legs trembled. He couldn\u2019t comprehend what had just happened. Even if he ignored the collateral, he knew the interest he would have to pay would be astronomical.\u2018How the hell was Homer defeated? Homer is a 4-Star swordsman. Unlike the rumors around the North-East, he is a real swordsman with good skills who wandered around fighting with stronger people. Him losing the battle doesn\u2019t make sense! This is clearly a conspiracy of the mercenary guild! They must have sent someone disguised as Homer, and that fake guy was killed by that Dmitry\u2019s Fool!\u2019Barco ignored the reality in front of him. He didn\u2019t want to believe it because he knew the price he had to pay would be huge. Viscount Barco\u2019s eyes trembled anxiously despite seeing Homer\u2019s face.\u201c\u2026Lord. We need to send a warrior out there.\u201d A knight spoke carefully. According to the plan, a 2-Star knight would go third. However, now that Barco\u2019s two best warriors got killed, they couldn\u2019t sacrifice another knight. Nevertheless, Viscount Barco didn\u2019t bother about his pride and honor.\u201cWe cannot lose our last hope. Send Benson out now. As he is the one who dishonored Barco at the banquet, we will give him a chance to make up for it right now.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dThe knight withdrew with a stiff expression. He knew this act was nothing but throwing his men to the wolves. Benson was being asked to go out and die. Still, no one would talk back. At the last banquet, Benson, who was a knight, had argued with Kevin. It was fine that he was laughing at Dmitry, but the problem was that after that, he was unilaterally beaten by Roman in front of everyone. And that turned into a gossip topic for other nobles. It was a situation that showed the difference between Dmitry and Barco. Naturally, Benson was punished.And today was his last chance to redeem his mistakes. To continue living as a knight of Barco, despite knowing that he might lose his hand or even his life, he had no choice but to walk onto the stage.\u201cI am Benson, representing Barco.\u201dIt was the last battle. As Benson stepped ahead, there was a bit of a commotion at Lawrence\u2019s side. Benson was a knight who wasn\u2019t much strong. Lawrence\u2019s knight was scheduled to go in third, and they were sure of this victory. However, suddenly, an unknown figure stepped out.\u201cI will deal with him.\u201dHe was small. Wearing a helmet that didn\u2019t suit him, he looked up at Roman with a determined expression. Yes, it was Kevin.Lawrence\u2019s knight spoke sternly at the sudden interruption, \u201cWhat kind of role does this ordinary soldier want to take? Even if the opponent is a man who isn\u2019t much strong, he isn\u2019t someone you can deal with. The Battle of Great Warriors is a sacred place for the honor of Lawrence. As you are one of Sir Roman\u2019s soldiers, I will let your words slide. Thus, step back.\u201dKevin\u2019s actions were too sudden. According to military law, he could be punished, as well. Lawrence\u2019s knight was right in his own sense; however, Lawrence\u2019s lord, observing the situation, just watched it happen silently.Viscount Lawrence, Flora, as well as everyone else\u2014They all knew that Roman Dmitry, who led them to victory, had the authority to accept the request of Kevin.Sigh.Roman looked at Kevin.\u00a0\u2018He\u2019s truly foolish.\u2019\u00a0Indeed, his actions were foolish. Although Kevin was developing quite rapidly, fighting against a sturdy opponent in the Battle of Great Warriors was a risky choice. Nevertheless, Kevin said he wanted to fight. Whether it was a choice to repay Benson for what he had gone through at the banquet, or if he was risking his life to prove his worth to Roman, it didn\u2019t matter to him.There was only one thing Roman was sure of,\u201cGo.\u201dDespite how foolish it was, he liked Kevin\u2019s choice. In the world of survival of the fittest, no rights were granted to those who suffered defeat. At the banquet, people were speaking about Roman giving back a perfect reply to Janson\u2019s actions, but behind the scenes, they didn\u2019t take Kevin, a knight who had to be protected by his lord, seriously.Moreover, Kevin was different from Chris. Thus, the people didn\u2019t think Kevin could do anything for his liege. Therefore, he had to take a step forward. And after standing by Roman\u2019s side, he understood what Roman valued.Kevin said, \u201cI will be back soon.\u201dSeeing Kevin move toward the stage with a ferocious face, the people of Lawrence couldn\u2019t stop him.Sky has fallen: A groundless or absurd conviction that some catastrophic consequence is imminent or underway.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50 - Battle Of Great Warriors (5)Benson wasn\u2019t the kind of person who believed in karma. Even after doing all sorts of crazy things, thanks to his father, who was a knight, he was able to walk on a solid path and turn into a knight under Barco. That was why he was proud of the fact that he was a knight. He was someone who enjoyed power and did his best for Barco.What he did to Kevin was an expression of his loyalty. Usable to suppress his rising pride, he ridiculed his opponent even though he didn\u2019t know what would happen due to that.\u2018Is this karma?\u2019His future seemed dark. He had much experience with Roman Dmitry as he served directly under Anthony Barco. Although his position within the public had changed due to the incident with Blood Fang, Benson didn\u2019t believe the rumors. Well, it was a reasonable thought. Thinking of the Roman Dmitry he saw and experienced with his own eyes, he thought crossing a line would be fine, as well.However, the reality was much different. Roman Dmitry cut down Homer with a single slash. As he watched the blood gush out of Homer\u2019s body, Benson felt goosebumps rise on his skin.\u2018I made a severe mistake.\u2019What if he had known the true face of Roman? Benson would have never dared to even lay a finger on Kevin and would have tried to stick with Dmitry, not Barco.Nevertheless, the deed was already done. His life as a knight of Barco shackled him, and what he did came back to him like a boomerang\u2014Viscount Barco ordered him to go on the stage. As he couldn\u2019t refuse it, he was now a mere death row prisoner.\u2018Fuck!\u2019People were looking at him, but no one cheered for him. In their eyes, he was already a corpse.\u201cI am Benson, representing Barco.\u201d He struggled to calm his trembling voice.What kind of man will they send for the battle?He knew that Lawrence had a 2-Star swordsman; obviously, the moment he entered the stage, Benson would undoubtedly die.\u2018Oh, God. Please save me just one more time.\u2019Just then, a person from Lawrence\u2019s side walked onto the stage. His face was familiar to Benson. He had a small physique, as well. Seeing him come up on the stage, Benson could hardly hold back the laughter in his mouth.\u2018He is my opponent?\u2019He was sure\u2014the one in front of him was the boy soldier he had beaten at the banquet. Seeing him stepping up, Benson felt he had been given a chance to live.\u2018God! Thank you very much!\u2019He thought he would live through this. In his eyes, Kevin looked like easy prey.Swish!The final battle began.Benson was relaxed. The flag was moved to signal the start of the fight, but he showed a relaxed attitude instead of rushing ahead.\u201cI doubted my eyes at first. No matter how they decided who to send, I didn\u2019t think you would be sent in as their last warrior.\u201dGrin.He laughed. His lips constantly curled up, unable to hide his happiness.\u201cWell, you must have wanted revenge. However, whether you came in intentionally or not, you have now been abandoned by the lord you serve. Think about it\u2014if you were the one who had the authority to decide the final warrior, would you have let yourself come out? Of course not! This means you are of little use, and your future has been decided.\u201dGrip.He picked up the sword.Kevin only continued to watch Benson silently. He moved the legs to a reasonable distance and pointed the sword at Benson.\u201cCheeky bastard!\u201dWas it because of the relief that he would live? He felt his pride hurt seeing Kevin\u2019s actions.Kevin slammed the ground and rushed for his opponent in the blink of an eye.\u201cDie!\u201dTap!Benson\u2019s movements were slow. Because of the previous confrontations, in which powerful people fought, the movements of Benson didn\u2019t stand out. Nevertheless, no one doubted that the winner would be Benson. It was because Benson\u2019s opponent was Kevin, who could be seen as a soldier who had started training only recently, and Benson had a physique that seemed like it could overwhelm Kevin at any given moment. The difference was obvious to the audience.As Benson swung his sword with a heavy movement, Kevin turned his head slightly and dug into his opponent\u2019s arm.Pat!Blood dripped onto the floor.Kevin\u2019s cheek had a slight cut, but he didn\u2019t care about that and aimed for Benson\u2019s chin while swinging the sword from the bottom toward the top. The area under the chin is never protected by armor. Thus, it was quite threatening.Benson raised his arm to block the sword while simultaneously attacking Kevin in the stomach with his other arm.Puak!Benson blocked Kevin\u2019s attack. Kevin couldn\u2019t penetrate the black steel without Aura, and his expression distorted slightly at the hit to the stomach. However, he didn\u2019t step back.Without a single groan, Kevin swung his sword toward the opponent\u2019s gap, once again, as if his stomach wasn\u2019t in pain. Honestly, Kevin\u2019s swinging speed was much faster than anyone else had expected.The muscles that had been trained by farming and doing chores exerted unnatural strength. Thus, the place between Benson\u2019s forearm and torso was cut sharply.Slash!\u201cKuak!\u201dBenson gulped back his groan. It was an unexpected counterattack. Then, Benson slammed his opponent\u2019s body.Kevin bounced back, and as he rolled on the ground, Benson instantly jumped right in and slashed toward his opponent.\u201cDie!\u201dPuak!Due to the brief difference, Kevin quickly evaded, smashed his sword into the ground, and quickly used the repulsive force he gained from that to reduce the distance between Benson and him. It looked like he didn\u2019t want any more clashes and wanted to end the battle quickly.Kevin and Benson\u2014as there was a physical difference between a boy and an adult, their attack and speed were naturally different.Kevin instinctively knew that he would have to move faster and end this while sticking to his opponent, so he never lost his focus, even when his cheek was cut and he was thrown to the ground.Kang!Kakakang!Their swords collided. Obviously, Benson overwhelmed his opponent due to his physical advantage, but he couldn\u2019t make any decisive attacks.\u201cYou bastard!\u201d Benson\u2019s face flushed red. His self-esteem was hurt. His opponent was nothing but a kid. Against him, who had the title of a knight, Keving was still just a child. Yet, he couldn\u2019t end the battle? His stomach churned due to his fury. He initially tried to end this fight by making him unconscious, but after looking at Kevin now, his eyes became red with anger, and he lost his rationality.\u2018I will definitely kill him.\u2019\u00a0He changed his mind. Even if it resulted in him getting hurt, he wanted to punish Kevin, the boy who didn\u2019t realize who he was dealing with.\u201cHow dare you?!\u201dSwish!Kevin titled his head as Benson swung the sword with all his might. The moment when the whispers around him went silent, Benson rushed ahead.In a position where he had given up his defense to some extent, he launched a series of attacks like a storm, and Kevin had to step back and forth to not get hit by them.Each time their attacks clashed, Kevin\u2019s body staggered. Even if his sword was blocked, Benson wouldn\u2019t stop and kept pushing Kevin further backward.Now, the results of the battle were clear to most of the audience\u2014It would be Benson\u2019s victory.Another result wasn\u2019t as expected. That was because, in the current situation, the difference in the physical strength of the warriors was quite vast, and Kevin couldn\u2019t have grown so much in two months that he would be able to defeat a knight.Kang!\u201c\u2026!\u201dKevin\u2019s arm bounced back, unable to handle his opponent\u2019s strength. Benson, who noticed it, decided to make a follow-up attack.Swish!His sword even cut the wind. Truly, it was a desperate crisis.Seeing Kevin try to attack back, Benson decided to end this.\u2018A sword like that cannot pierce my armor!\u2019In a battle like this, the value of armor couldn\u2019t be ignored.However, Benson\u2019s eyes widened as if they would tear apart just before his sword cut through Kevin.Slash!Srrng!Kevin\u2019s sword, which was glowing red, cut through Benson\u2019s armor, and dozens of blood drops splashed in front of his eyes.Roman once said that using Ghost Illusion Demonic Martial Arts1\u00a0was a way to grow faster than any other technique if one could handle the pain and suffering that came from it.Yes, the Ghost Illusion Demonic Martial Arts inhabited Kevin\u2019s mind from the day he cut his hand off.-Kill! Kill! Kill!-That fucking bastard is hurting you right now!-Get revenge against him now!The Ghosts of the Ghost Illusion Demonic Martial Arts were whispering that to him. Actually, they were all just hallucinations. The Ghosts of the Ghost Illusion Demonic Martial Arts don\u2019t actually exist but still confuse one\u2019s mind. Thus, Kevin looked at Benson with burning eyes. The physical pain was nothing to him. Even when Benson\u2019s fist hit his stomach, it was nothing compared to the pain of cutting his own hand off.He endured it. He suppressed the pain and narrowed the distance between him and his opponent.-Avoid!-Be careful!His instincts said that. It seemed like his opponent would swing the sword from top to bottom.Kevin believed the Ghosts\u2019 words and avoided his opponent\u2019s attack with a short delay. Benson\u2019s sword passed right in front of his eyes. In a situation where he could die due to the slightest carelessness, Kevin felt alive.\u2018I want to be more useful to my liege.\u2019Chris was chosen as the first warrior. Naturally, Kevin felt envious when he looked at Chris, who took down a 3-Star knight. Obviously, he made up his mind to follow Roman before Chris did, and he hated the fact that he couldn\u2019t be better than him.His family had received favor from Roman. However, what did he do for Roman?Just like Chris, he wanted to gain Roman\u2019s trust and carry out his orders faithfully; however, all he could do till now was see Benson insult Roman and then get beaten up by him.Maybe it was a feeling of inferiority. Maybe it could be considered as too much loyalty. However, nothing changed the fact that Kevin wanted revenge now. He wanted to rip off the mouth of Benson with which that bastard dared to insult Roman! He wanted to be a useful sword for Roman Dmitry.Just then,Swish!Benson initiated an attack. He was certain of his victory. He believed that he could win easily and jumped ahead. However, that was a mistake because he did not know Kevin\u2019s actual skills.\u2018Ghost Illusion Demonic Martial Arts.\u2019-Kakakaka!-Kill him!A red light shone from his sword while consuming a bit of mana. It was something he could use only for a fleeting time, but during that time, Kevin had enough power that he could even cut down steel.Slash!Thus, Benson\u2019s armor was cut. Naturally, the skin behind the armor was also cut, and red blood splashed into his eyes, while the majority of it gushed and dripped down.\u201c\u2026!\u201dBenson was stunned. His expression turned to one that showed how much pain he was in, and he hurriedly swung his sword toward Kevin to get a chance to live.However, contrary to what any normal human would do, Kevin did not avoid it. Naturally, his flesh on the shoulder was cut off due to the attack. Benson\u2019s sword raged at his body, but in return, his chest was torn open by Kevin\u2019s attack.Kevin didn\u2019t care about it. Despite the flesh on his shoulder being cut down more horribly with each of his moments, in Kevin\u2019s vision and thoughts, there were only Benson\u2019s wounds. Once upon a time, Kevin was someone who was terrified of even having a slight cut on his finger. However, the child who once lived under the love of his parents had now grown up completely differently due to the challenges he faced in his life till now.Kevin\u2019s expression turned even more ferocious. And for a moment, Benson\u2019s eyes met Kevin\u2019s. Instantly, his face was turned into one that contained fear due to realizing what a mistake he had made by ignoring Kevin. He tried to move away, but Kevin attacked even more cruelly.Puak!\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d\u00a0Benson screamed.Now, he had no more power to use mana. He tried to fight his physical strength, but Kevin got on top of the collapsed Benson and crushed his upper body. Then, he grabbed his sword and stabbed and slashed toward his opponent ferociously, not even giving him the chance to stand up. Obviously, Kevin\u2019s arm was also in pain due to the wounds he had suffered, but he didn\u2019t care about it\u2014all that mattered was to kill the opponent.Puak! Puak!Puak!\u201cCough!\u201dEach time Kevin\u2019s sword was pulled out of his body, blood splattered everywhere around them. Benson, groaning while holding back the blood in his throat, struggled to push Kevin away. Nevertheless, his pathetic hands couldn\u2019t stop the onslaught. Even when he was using his hands to push Kevin away, Kevin didn\u2019t stop attacking. Finally, Benson\u2019s body shook at a certain moment, and seeing no reaction even after stabbing him multiple times, Kevin lifted his head.\u201cKuak! Kuaaak!\u201dBenson\u2019s condition was so horrible that one couldn\u2019t even call him human anymore.And obviously, Kevin was the winner of the final battle.Everyone held their breath, seeing Kevin\u2019s appearance. He resembled a demon. Even if it was a fight in which the death of the opponent was natural, some of them could only keep their mouths shut, seeing the cruelty of Kevin.Kevin stood up while staggering. His face was stained with blood, and blood was dripping down from his torn shoulder, but he walked as if he hadn\u2019t suffered any wounds.Everyone\u2019s attention was focused on him. One step at a time, people followed his movements.After walking for quite a while, Kevin arrived in front of Roman. As Roman was looking down at him, Kevin looked like a child wanting to be praised.\u201cI am back.\u201dHearing those words, Roman said, \u201cYou did well, Kevin.\u201dThose words were enough. Hearing them, Kevin smiled brightly, as if he had won over the entire world.The fight was over now. The battle between Barco and Lawrence had finally come to an end. Everyone had assumed Barco would win, but the results they saw today were good enough to shake the entire Cairo Kingdom.3 wins out of 3 battles\u2014Obviously, it was Lawrence\u2019s win. And the one at the center of it was unmistakably Roman Dmitry.This was previously translated as Demonic Spirit Art.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51 - If You Start Something, You Must See Its End (1)The rumors spread incredibly fast. The shocking news was that Lawrence defeated Barco in the Battle of Great Warriors. When people from the North-East region of the kingdom got together, they naturally gossiped about what happened in Lawrence.\u201cReally, it must be frustrating for Barco. They made a huge fuss and then lost to Lawrence.\u201d\u201cBut is that really true? They are saying that Roman attacked the enemy\u2019s rear alone and slaughtered hundreds of their soldiers at once.\u201d\u201cOf course, it\u2019s true! You know my relatives are natives of Lawrence, right? I heard it from relatives\u2014from what they witnessed from the wall, Roman appeared like the savior of Lawrence. In an emergency situation where the wall might\u2019ve collapsed at any given moment, Roman Dmitry attacked the enemy and slaughtered the soldiers of Barco. Moreover, he completely reversed the atmosphere by destroying the Flare. If Roman hadn\u2019t appeared, Barco would have planted their flag in Lawrence by now!\u201dRumors are always a mixture of truth and a bit of fiction, just like a heroic tale passed down from generation to generation.Just like those two people were talking, many people in the North-East region praised Roman\u2019s achievements.\u201cThis war started with Roman Dmitry and ended with him as well. This is a story only those who were there know, but after Chris, the vanguard, won the first battle, the people of Lawrence were in complete despair. Do you know who showed up? Homer, the 49th Ranker in the Cairo Kingdom, came out as a Great Warrior for Barco. The moment he revealed his name, the people of Lawrence fell into despair. And in a fight that no one believed could be won, they thought Roman should step back and save his own life, at least. However.\u201dThe man continued with a complicated expression. He spread his arms wide and spoke as if he was Roman himself.\u201cRoman Dmitry\u2014No! The hero\u2019s judgment was different from the ordinary people\u2019s. He proudly declared that he would fight, and in front of many others, Roman Dmitry beheaded Homer with a single attack. His red blood spilled in the air\u2026\u00a0Haaah! It was such an amazing scene. Roman Dmitry, who had even led Lawrence to victory against the siege, ended the battle with that fight.\u201d\u201c\u2026But you weren\u2019t there at the time.\u201d\u201cNo, I am just telling you what my relatives said. Anyway, to say the least, Roman Dmitry isn\u2019t a fool, contrary to what others say. He subdued Blood Fang by himself, took down Barco\u2019s warrior, and now helped Lawrence, as well. He is definitely a hero. A sleeping dragon, which the Dmitry family had initially kept as a secret, finally ascended to heaven and is now building up heroic stories earnestly.\u201dEveryone was excited. Roman\u2019s actions were so great that they were impressive to everyone. The rumors had spread so widely that one could see the children running on the streets play the role of Roman Dmitry.However, things didn\u2019t end just there. Lawrence had emerged victorious in all 3 battles in the Battle of Great Warriors. Although Roman\u2019s impact was immense, there was also the critical point that the other two fights were won by Roman\u2019s soldiers, as well.\u201cHeroes are really born with good fortune on their side. Dmitry\u2019s genius swordsman, Chris, defeated Janson, a 3-Star swordsman, and the child who hardly even looked like a soldier mutilated Barco\u2019s knight. None of Lawrence\u2019s men even took part in the battles. Roman\u2019s soldiers were the ones who proclaimed the victory, and they proved their loyalty to Roman in front of everyone. Things will honestly get messy in the future. In the North-East region, a talented person who will shock the world is finally born after a long time.\u201dFlora\u2019s predictions were correct. This war was won by the sacrifice of Lawrence, but all the glory went to Roman; however, no one complained.The battle for victory that would shape their entire lives\u2014The people of Lawrence didn\u2019t truly know how fortunate they were to emerge victorious even if they got hurt in the war.It was over for him now. No other words could describe his current situation. Viscount Barco, who returned to the family after suffering defeat in the Battle of Great Warriors, looked like someone who had drowned in a pool of despair.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dPapers were piled up on his desk. Their content was already clear to him. The Golden Bank must be asking how he would repay the principal amount in the future after his defeat in this territorial war. Also, the Cairo Mercenary guild was angry about the death of Homer and wanted him to pay the penalty. The mercenary guild\u2019s reasoning was truly absurd, though\u2014They said that Barco had informed them that the opponent would be a 2-Star knight of Lawrence when they made their request for a warrior, so they shifted the loss of their man onto Barco now. In short, everyone utterly despised Barco. The fact that Barco would fall into the abyss with this defeat was known to everyone, and they all wanted something.\u201cThese fucking beggars!\u201dIt was bittersweet. It wasn\u2019t just these two who ignored him. Once the war was over, none of the nobles, who were earlier friendly and greeted him with a warm smile every time they met, answered his calls. Moreover, some rumors even stated they had sided with Dmitry now. That was the cold reality in front of him.Obviously, the current behavior of those who initially sided with Barco when he gained fame and became an influential leader in the North-East region seemed disgusting to him now. However, he understood that power is what brings others\u2019 interest in someone. Viscount Barco was also someone who lived on the edge of the cliff like that, so he could only smile when he realized that he had been thrown off the cliff.\u2018What the hell does this even mean?\u2019The burden of defeat was weighing down his shoulders. It was unsettling.He was in a situation in which he could neither think of how to pay his debt off nor how he could recover from the defeat. It was because he was certain of his victory. If only Roman Dmitry hadn\u2019t come into and shattered his equation, Barco would have been drinking champagne, enjoying his victory.\u201cRight, this is all because of that fucking bastard\u2014Roman Dmitry. He showed up with no reason to intervene in the war and ruined everything! This is absurd! In the noble society, where having a cause is critical, Roman Dmitry did something he shouldn\u2019t have.\u201dRoman\u2014It all happened because of him.\u00a0Viscount Barco thought\u2014In order for the Barco family, who has been driven to the edge of destruction, to survive, I must hold onto Roman\u2019s existence.\u2018This is my last chance.\u2019He jumped up from his seat. Now, he had only one hope left. Clearly, there was a lot of work he needed to do.Viscount Barco contacted all the nobles of the North-East. Some nobles accepted. Although they were reluctant to talk to him, they accepted it due to his earnest request. And a few days later, those nobles gathered in the Barco estate.If it had been the past, everyone except the pro-Dmitry1\u00a0would have expressed their intention to attend, but today, only ten nobles were seated at the huge round table. It was a scene that unquestionably showed who the weak side was. Still, Viscount Barco stood tall and said, \u201cBefore we start, I want to say thank everyone for coming to Barco. You all are true nobles. Despite those who turned their backs on us instantly and ignored our relationship according to their interests, I think the North-East region\u2019s future can still be considered bright because of nobles like you.\u201d\u201cAhem.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s begin the meeting.\u201dThe nobles attending the meeting didn\u2019t like the compliments from Viscount Barco. They were all here because they knew their relationship with Dmitry wasn\u2019t good; however, they knew how dangerous this move was.Then, Viscount Barco said, \u201cI will get straight to the point. A cause is critical in a fight between nobles. In particular, in a situation where one doesn\u2019t know when a foreign invasion might happen, attacking the surrounding territory just because one is greedy violates the laws set for nobles. Barco attacked Lawrence with a good cause. It was to take back the debt they owed our ancestors, and the Central Government, which judged our cause to be valid, sent down a judge. However, Roman Dmitry intervened in the war without any cause. Due to his surprise attack, Barco lost their Flare, and furthermore, the fighters of Lawrence remained untouched in the Battle of Great Warriors.\u201dHis voice eventually rose. It was a demand for others to show him sympathy.\u201cDoes this make any sense? Why did Roman Dmitry come to help Lawrence? There would have been no problem if the two families had some kind of ties, but the Lawrence family declared that Flora Lawrence had broken the marriage with Roman Dmitry. However, Roman Dmitry still sided with Lawrence despite having no cause to help them. His behavior has crossed the line. Even though we had taken the help of those around us for the war, we fought with the troops of Barco till the very end to honor the values of nobles. Thus, this horrendous defeat is unjustifiable.\u201d\u201cWhat you have said is truly correct.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Roman Dmitry had no cause to intervene.\u201dEveryone agreed with him. The statements Viscount Barco had said weren\u2019t incorrect\u2014Intervention without cause deserved punishment. Thus, this was an issue that had to be discussed publicly.\u2018I don\u2019t think this will entirely destroy the Dmitry family. However, I can hold them accountable for their actions and demand a massive amount of compensation from them instead. That will be enough. Considering the Dmitry family\u2019s wealth, I can definitely pay off the money I borrowed from the Golden Bank.\u2019The Golden Bank was the most urgent matter now. The issues with the mercenary guild could be resolved through arguments. However, the Golden Bank was famous for being strict when it came to recovering the principal they lent. What if\u2014Barco said he cannot pay? Undoubtedly, the Golden Bank would crush the Barco family.A noble asked, \u201cSo, what do you plan to do?\u201dEveryone\u2019s opinion was similar. Just seeing the nobles who were interested and expressed their distaste at Roman Dmitry\u2019s actions, Barco understood that his words had worked. Viscount Barco was aiming to create a voice that would sympathize with him and put pressure on Dmitry with the people who had gathered here.\u201cFirst\u2014\u201dJust then, the conference room\u2019s door was slammed open by a soldier. When Viscount Barco looked at the pale-looking soldier, who was nervous, the soldier spoke, stuttering, \u201cR-Roman Dmitry. He has come to meet the Viscount!\u201dThis was an unexpected situation that did not make any sense to Viscount Barco.Roman Dmitry\u2014the reason for their defeat\u2014Him setting foot here meant he had voluntarily stepped into a place in which everyone wanted him dead.\u2018What is he thinking?\u2019The gathered nobles looked at each other. This was an unexpected situation where everyone was confused about what to do.\u201cIt seems everyone is already gathered here.\u201d Ignoring the soldiers, Roman walked into the room with a calm expression on his face and said that.At that moment, Viscount Barco seriously thought\u2014\u2018Should I just kill him?\u2019He was already at the edge of destruction. And naturally, all he wanted was revenge by killing the man responsible for it. However, if he did that, he would lose his justification for taking down the Dmitry family. This was unmistakably a situation in which he needed to endure his anger.Viscount Barco, struggling to calm down his boiling anger, stared at Roman, who was sitting in front of him. No one had given him permission to sit, but he still took the seat as if it was his own.Sitting across from Viscount Barco, Roman leaned back on the chair as he crossed his legs and said, \u201cI heard you had a lot of complaints about me.\u201dLick.After caressing his bright and beautiful lips, Roman smiled like a predator who had caught its prey. And then, looking into the eyes of Viscount Barco, he said, \u201cThen, tell me directly\u2014For what reason Barco created this situation.\u201d2Pro: in favor of.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fSomeone's about to die soon.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52 - If You Start Something, You Must See Its End (2)Hearing Roman\u2019s words, Viscount Barco\u2019s expression distorted instantly. Roman Dmitry\u2019s remarks completely crossed a line that shouldn\u2019t have been crossed, even if they were in a hostile relationship.\u201cYou! How dare you show such an attitude and utter such words! Do you not know who I am?!\u201dViscount Barco and Roman Dmitry\u2014they had different statuses. If Viscount Barco was the head of the family, then Roman was just a kid from a Baron family who hadn\u2019t even obtained any title yet. Thus, such words were obviously offensive and meant to disregard Viscount Barco. Still, even a toothless tiger couldn\u2019t ignore the words of Roman, and being in front of other nobles, Viscount Barco was someone who especially couldn\u2019t accept them.\u201cVery well, I will tell you what you did wrong. You might have thought that you, a vulgar fool who knows nothing about the laws of nobles, could intervene in the wars of other people without a cause, but that isn\u2019t allowed in the Cairo Kingdom. Why did you think Barco declared a territorial war? According to your logic, it would have been enough even if we attacked before Lawrence was prepared, but we did everything with nobles\u2019 laws and the Central Government\u2019s approval.\u201dThe war with Lawrence was based on a long plan. Barco publicly announced the dispute based on the forged documents and emphasized that the cause was so huge that no one should intervene in the war between them. To him, it was a perfect plan. Even if people didn\u2019t like Barco\u2019s attitude, they couldn\u2019t haphazardly.Then, why? Viscount Barco couldn\u2019t even begin to understand why and how Roman Dmitry intervened in their battle.\u201cThe nobles of Cairo aren\u2019t fools. A war without any cause in the noble society deserves a burial, and the Barco family will question your actions and make the Dmitry family pay the price for them. The Dmitry family cannot avoid this responsibility. No matter how great a family\u2019s name is, there is an implicit agreement between the neighboring nobles that a family that violates the nobles\u2019 laws will be destroyed. If you were maybe even a bit interested in the history of nobles, I wouldn\u2019t have had to say all of this.\u201dHe raised his voice even more. Seeing Roman\u2019s calm expression despite all saying all that intertwined Barco\u2019s insides.\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to use the excuse that you didn\u2019t know the laws of nobles, right? Do you finally understand how stupid you were? Because of you, your family will have to suffer now. That means that the Dmitry family, who have lived in peace despite having a fool of a son, will now be criticized by the nobles of the North-East!\u201dKwang!\u00a0He pounded on the table.As he got up from his seat and exhaled deeply, Roman looked up at him and calmly asked, \u201cAll done?\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dRoman\u2019s voice was unbelievably calm.Even though a storm was raging within Viscount Barco, Roman was incredibly calm, looking around at the other nobles.\u201cThen, from now on, I will tell you how and why I got involved in the war between Lawrence and Barco.\u201dThe atmosphere subsided at Roman\u2019s words.Breaking through the tension where even the breathing sound felt heavy, Roman said in a sharp voice, \u201cLawrence and Dmitry were initially going to be married. However, I decided to break off our marriage due to undisclosed reasons, and in that way, I became a fool who suffered divorce. What do you think was the reason that happened? My reputation? My needs from a woman? Or simply because Miss Fiora Lawrence didn\u2019t like me? All of them are incorrect.\u201dTap tap.He tapped his finger on the desk; hearing that sound, the surrounding nobles became nervous.\u201cBarco\u2019s eldest son, Anthony Barco, threatened me to break up with her.\u201d\u201c\u2026?!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s head back to the Barco family\u2019s second last banquet that I attended. I was acquainted with Anthony Barco, so even after promising to marry the daughter of Viscount Lawrence, I attended the banquet at his invitation. I even drank at his invitation, but that only led me into a trap. Drunk, I woke up in a room beside Emily Barco, and realized that Anthony had set up a trap to break Lawrence away from Dmitry. And as expected, Anthony Barco used that incident as an excuse to threaten to annul my marriage with Lawrence.\u201dHearing Roman\u2019s words, the nobles were perplexed. If Roman actually broke off his marriage with Lawrence due to Anthony Barco\u2019s threats, then he obviously had a justified cause for intervening.\u2018The moment one bares their fangs at me, I pick them out and destroy the threat.\u2019At the time when he was once walking on thin ice in the Demonic Sect, Baek Joong-hyuk suffered all kinds of harm. Unlike Roman, who didn\u2019t even try to solve the problems even though his reputation was down to a ridiculous level, at that time, Baek Joong-hyuk solved his problems by facing them head-on.So what if he was a fool to others? His people trusted Baek Joong-hyuk with their lives, and the rumors about him slowly disappeared as he dealt with his enemies head-on.And just like that, Roman Dmitry also firstly blocked the cause of the threat. After all, he couldn\u2019t fall further than being a fool.Nevertheless, seeing the unusual situation, Viscount Barco shouted with his eyes red from anger, \u201cNonsense! Do you think anyone will believe that? Alright, I will call Emily Barco right now to check if what you said is really true. Everyone knows how disgustingly Dmitry\u2019s Fool has lived all his life, but it is honestly disgusting to see you try and use your mouth to cover up the truth with lies.\u201d\u201cI knew you would say that. Had it been someone who would admit the truth instead of you, we would never have met in such a situation. Very well, I will take this opportunity to make things clear now. The reason I got involved in the war between the two estates wasn\u2019t to take revenge against Anthony Barco intimidating me, but something else.\u201d\u201cSomething else\u2026?\u201dHe has something else to say?Viscount Barco felt like he was drowning further down in the mud by the moment. Hearing the words of Roman and seeing his confident attitude, it felt like he was now playing into the palm of Roman.Nevertheless, Roman continued, \u201cEveryone knew that Anthony Barco followed Flora Lawrence around. However, in the process, that man crossed a line he should never have. He tried to molest Flora Lawrence, but failed. And shocked by that incident, she decided to break up with me. The true reason for breaking off the marriage between Dmitry and Lawrence was that after going through such a thing, she didn\u2019t have the confidence to smile at the wedding.\u201d\u201cW-what did you?!\u201d\u201cDo you think that is a lie, as well? Fine. Then, call in Emily Barco and Flora Lawrence, as well. They both will speak the truth.\u201dRoman had turned the situation into a mess. Just like Anthony Barco trapped and pulled him down, Roman did the same for him. However, the difference was that Roman could get his revenge right here, in the estate of Barco. It doesn\u2019t even matter if Emily Barco said ten lies about Roman; Flora could do the same for Anthony Barco. Even the truth didn\u2019t matter in the current situation. As long as there was a justification for dispelling his opponent\u2019s words, Roman\u2019s plan would turn out to be successful. Also\u2026\u2018Firstly, Anthony Barco tried to molest Flora. Even if it wasn\u2019t as good or as plausible as Emily being beside me, he crossed a line as Flora was going to get married to someone. As I have revealed these actions in front of the other nobles, even Anthony\u2019s father, Viscount Barco, cannot completely believe his own son.\u2019Roman had mixed lies with the truth.And finally, he decided to strike the final blow.\u201cAnthony Barco touched my woman, who was promised to marry me. Now, I ask Viscount Barco and those gathered here\u2014Do you seriously think I had no reason to intervene in the war between Barco and Lawrence? I intervened in the war only with my own power, and not my family\u2019s power. That is the best I could do for Flora, whose side and feelings I didn\u2019t initially know, and to show her that I accepted the divorce without harsh feelings between us.\u201dIt was a truly perfect hit\u2014The argument made sense, and Roman showed his cause to others. Now, Viscount Barco wasn\u2019t the main character anymore. He was speechless. Cold sweat flowed down his forehead, and thousands of thoughts and calculations ran through his mind to try and find a solution to the current situation.\u2018There\u2019s no way out of this. Roman Dmitry had a perfect cause.\u2019Instead of cornering and taking revenge for Anthony\u2019s intimidation, Roman had a perfect reason for intervention in the war between Lawrence and Barco.In addition, Roman had intervened in the war entirely on his own, taking note that the issue might turn into a dispute between Dmitry and Barco otherwise.Now, there was nothing Viscount Barco could say. The moment Roman laid out his cause as revenge for the disrespect against Flora Lawrence, his future wife, it was evident that Barco would face irredeemable backlash and blame.Viscount Barco felt dizzy, and his mouth became dry.\u2018He is a true monster. The nobles who initially tried to help me have been completely swayed by Roman\u2019s words.\u2019They turned themselves away from Viscount Barco. They didn\u2019t want to fall like Barco by taking the wrong side, in case Roman\u2019s words were true.Now, the battle for the truth was meaningless. Even if he brang in Emily Barco, there was nothing he could gain anymore.\u2018There is only one way left for the Barco family to survive. Rather than giving a perfect excuse, I need to find a way to avoid this situation and find a new solution.\u2019Finally, as if nothing had happened, Viscount Barco calmed down and said, \u201cI do not think that what you have said is true. Just as Dmitry\u2019s Fool denied the matters with Emily Barco, I think Anthony Barco would do the same. Thus, I will clearly confirm the truth about this situation and then contact you again. Sorry, everyone. I didn\u2019t call you all here for this\u2026\u201dHis words eventually faded. Flustered and embarrassed, he tried to hold onto the nobles, not wanting to lose hope.Seeing that, Roman smiled. He recalled the conversation he had with Chris the previous day.\u201cYou really mean to go to Barco?! That is suicide. Viscount Barco will not leave you alone!\u201dRoman\u2019s plan\u2014Hearing that he wanted to go to Barco, Chris panicked.It was actually natural. Roman, who had ruined Barco\u2019s plans, now wanted to go into his estate? It was crazy.However, Roman asked,\u00a0\u201cChris, what do you think my future relationship with Barco will be like?\u201d\u201c\u2026Barco definitely considers the liege as their enemy by now. If the liege hadn\u2019t intervened, they would have taken down Lawrence and walked into the estate, happy. However, even so, it doesn\u2019t make sense to touch an enemy with nothing to lose. If possible, it is better to avoid getting close instead.\u201c\u201cNo.\u201dUntil he reached the apex of the Demonic Sect, while slaughtering thousands of enemies, Baek Joon-hyuk established an iron rule.\u201cIf we aren\u2019t the one who started it, it doesn\u2019t matter. However, remember this one thing, Chris\u2014If you start something, you must see its end. We both know Barco will hold a grudge against me in the future. Then, it is best for us to uproot any problems, like the revenge they will try to take in the future, while they are in a mess.\u201dBack to the present moment.Roman looked at Viscount Barco and said in a low but terrifying voice, \u201cViscount Barco.\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes were now focused solely on Roman. Viscount Barco momentarily tried to look good in front of the other nobles, but in fact, even he was stunned hearing Roman\u2019s call.\u201cChoose\u2014Would you like to end this with Anthony Barco being punished for my personal conflict with him, or do you want to take things forward as a family matter?\u201dWith the word \u2018Choose,\u2019 Roman thrust his sword and placed it directly under Viscount Barco\u2019s chin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 - If You Start Something, You Must See Its End (3)Both of the choices Roman gave to Viscount Barco were horrible. He knew that he couldn\u2019t move according to his opponent\u2019s intentions. However, he also knew that Roman wouldn\u2019t allow him to move how he wanted to.\u201cI have directly presented two options to you. They are absolutely clear, and remember this\u2014I won\u2019t allow any exceptions. If you don\u2019t choose the former option here today, as soon as I return to the Dmitry estate, I will speak with my father and tell him how I was threatened by your son, Anthony Barco. Obviously, after that, there will be no way you will be able to avoid a war with Dmitry. Anthony Barco\u2019s atrocities have already given me good cause to wage war on Barco, and the Dmitry family will not back down until Barco clearly shows their repentance.\u201dRoman blocked any way Barco could have used to get out of the current situation. Initially, Viscount Barco wanted to turn away from the reality in front of him; however, after a while, he realized he couldn\u2019t do that.\u2018I can never even dare to choose the second choice he gave me.\u2019If there was an actual war with Dmitry, the side that would obtain victory and the site that would be defeated were clear as crystal. Even if he ignored losing the war against Lawrence despite borrowing money from the Golden Bank, Barco wasn\u2019t so stupid that he would take the risk to wage war against the wealthiest man in the North-East region of Cairo. If he did that, it was evident that he would be defeated by an overwhelming margin. And even if it wasn\u2019t that, if the Dmitry family attacked Barco after they fell into the abyss, he was sure the Barco family would go extinct then.In the end, there was only one option left. Obviously, Roman was aware of this, as well, and that was exactly why he had presented those two choices to Barco.\u2018What he wants is for people to know that someone from Dmitry barged into Barco\u2019s estate by himself, and despite that, he got Barco on his knees. To come and punish the eldest child of Barco, Anthony Barco, in his own estate, will surely cause a huge mess within the nobles of the North-East. Barco\u2019s defeat in the war has already led to their reputation being slumped, and he is planning to destroy any chance of it recovering in the future.\u2019Furthermore, the worst thing was that the current situation was taking place in front of Barco\u2019s last connections. Roman was practically mocking them in their own estate.\u2018I can\u2019t believe he was so cruel.\u2019This was like disembowelment1\u00a0suicide.2\u00a0Nevertheless, the only difference was that Roman was the one who held the hilt. Finally, Viscount Barco let go of his pride and put his head down. He decided to take responsibility for his defeat and bring out the eldest child so that he would get his punishment. He didn\u2019t say those words, but everyone around him understood the meaning of his actions.His eyebrows trembled. As Viscount Barco, who once boasted unrivaled power, was a prideful man, he couldn\u2019t simply bow down to a young man and completely let go of the pride he had built over many years.And then, he realized it\u2014There was only one way left to protect his pride. And that was to prepare for the destruction of the Barco family by executing Roman, who barged into his estate fearlessly.However, he couldn\u2019t take that action as he wanted to live longer, albeit how brief it would be. Viscount Barco\u2019s strong desire to live eventually resulted in him accepting the reality in front of him.\u201cAnthony Barco\u2019s actions aren\u2019t a matter that should be escalated to a dispute between families. Thus, I will ask him to apologize directly. So, are we done now? By making the eldest son of Barco kneel down, is your anger finally appeased?\u201d He shouted. The chance for the revival of the family had already gone down the drain. So, Viscount Barco, who had lost everything, spoke desperately with red, bloodshot eyes.However\u2026\u201cWhen did I ever say anything like wanting Anthony Barco to get down on his knees?\u201d\u201c\u2026What do you mean?\u201d\u201cHow he has to be punished is in my hands. That choice obviously lies with me. Who in the world tells the perpetrator to choose the method of punishment for themself?\u201dRoman\u2019s voice was unbelievably cold. Even after he had driven Viscount Barco to the edge of the cliff, as if he wasn\u2019t satisfied, he revealed his ferocious teeth and said, \u201cI want a Duel of Judgment with Anthony Barco.\u201dDuel of Judgement\u2014Hearing those words, Viscount Barco\u2019s expression turned stiff instantly. A Duel of Judgement wasn\u2019t a common thing. It was equivalent to public execution\u2014A way for one to atone for their sins with blood and death by placing the wrongdoer at the crossroads of life and death.If Anthony had a Duel of Judgement with Roman, his chances of surviving against Roman were extremely slim.\u2018Does he want to kill my son right in front of me?\u2019No, that cannot happen. If that happens, Roman will not be able to survive either. I guess Roman is just expressing his opinion that just kneeling isn\u2019t enough for him to forgive Anthony for sins, and he wants him to be ready to be crippled. He is so fucking cruel. Even though the Barco family has given up their pride and bowed their head in front of him, he wants Barco to actually receive the \u2018price for Anthony\u2019s sins.\u2019Viscount Barco felt dizzy. He understood what Roman was asking him\u2014Will you risk the fate of the entire Barco family or abandon your eldest son? And obviously, Barco\u2019s answer was clear. Even though Anthony Barco was the eldest child who would one day succeed Viscount Barco, if he could avoid a war with Dmitry by abandoning his eldest son, it was a deal he needed to accept.He shut his eyes tightly. After losing the war with Lawrence, the debt he had to pay back was enormous, and albeit the choice to drive his son into a battle in which he would become limbless wasn\u2019t easy to accept, he had to accept the reality.After thinking for a long time, Viscount Barco told Roman he would accept his offer and left the conference room. Then, he told his son the truth about his future, who couldn\u2019t believe what he had just heard.\u201cF-Father!\u201d\u201cI am sorry.\u201d\u201cNo! Never! Isn\u2019t Roman the person who won even against Homer in a one-on-one match? Are you truly going to put the life of Barco\u2019s eldest son into the hands of someone else? Please, decline his offer. He will never spare me!\u201dAnthony Barco got down on his knees. Weeping, terrified of Roman, Anthony grabbed Viscount Barco\u2019s clothes and begged him earnestly. He knew it as well\u2014even if he survived the duel, there was no chance Roman would let him go back with a perfect body.Barco\u2019s eldest child, who his father thought had grown up with dignity, was now sobbing like a 3-year-old child and running away from reality. Seeing that, Viscount Barco said coldly, \u201cGet yourself together. You are Barco\u2019s eldest son. From the moment you said you wanted to succeed and take the position of Viscount, you should have been prepared to do anything for the family\u2019s sake\u2014Even if that meant putting your life in jeopardy. Roman will not kill you. If he had come here to kill you, he would at least have come with an escort that would help him go back alive. Be strong and accept this reality. Look straight into the face of Roman Dmitry and never forget today\u2019s disgrace in order to get revenge against him in the future.\u201d\u201cFather, please\u2026!\u201d\u201cAnthony!\u201d Viscount Barco yelled sternly. Then, Anthony finally realized that the duel was unavoidable.Anthony Barco, who sat down on his seat, looked up at the sky, pale.\u2018Oh, God.\u2019From now on, all he could do was hope that Roman would show mercy to him.Anthony Barco\u2014He was to be judged in front of Viscount Barco and the other nobles who attended the meeting.Tremble.His limbs were trembling crazily. His face looked as tired as a corpse, and his sword was shaking, as well. There was no meaning in this duel at all. Roman was someone who had defeated Homer with a single hit, so there was no way Anthony Barco, who didn\u2019t even know how to use Aura, could survive this.However, he still decided to do this for a reason. He didn\u2019t swing his sword to defeat Roman, but tried to appeal to him.\u201cR-Roman. I am sorry for what I did to you. I had no malice while doing that. You see\u2014I was in love with Flora Lawrence so much that my reasoning shattered for a moment when I was told she was going to be married to you.\u201d He said that in a desperate voice. It clearly showed that despite him not kneeling down, if Roman forgave him today, he would do anything for him in the future.\u201cWe are friends. Even if things got messy because of Lawrence, we still had pretty fun times together. Roman\u2014No! Sir Roman, please just let me off this one time. If you forgive me and let this go as if nothing happened, I, Anthony Barco, will never forget your grace and repay you for the rest of my life.\u201dIt was embarrassing. What Anthony Barco was currently showing was something the eldest son of a noble family should never show. Naturally, all the other nobles looked at Viscount Barco, discomforted.The Viscount\u2019s face was red due to anger. He had already driven him into giving up his pride, but here, he was begging and crawling!\u201cYou will never forget this grace and repay me for the rest of your life?\u201d Roman asked as he slowly walked towards Anthony Barco, who was startled and was holding the sword tightly. He knew he wouldn\u2019t be killed, but he didn\u2019t want to be crippled, either. His pale face showed how he was not even a little bit ready to accept the reality in front of him.Nevertheless, Roman continued, \u201cHow the hell are you going to repay me? The Barco family is already over. Even your connections with the Central Government can not help rectify your crimes, and obviously, Barco will lose everything they have just by repaying the money they borrowed from the Golden Bank. So, tell me\u2014Why do I have to forgive you? You\u2014who ignored me in front of countless others and trapped me with a selfish plan.\u201dAt that moment, Viscount Barco had a strange feeling. An intense alarm rang in his head. And just as he was about to rush in and stop the duel, Roman looked straight into Viscount Barco\u2019s eyes and swung his sword.\u201cThat\u2019s right. There is no need for me to forgive you.\u201dSlash!With the wind blowing, the feeling of something being cut could be felt, as well. In the current situation, Viscount Barco\u2019s expression was stained with despair as blood splattered in the air.He didn\u2019t know Baek Joong-hyuk was someone who paid back things twofold. There was no way for someone who openly showed hostility toward him to stay alive, or even continue to live peacefully.Baek Joong-hyuk withstood the threats of his brothers who tried to assassinate him every night, thrust his sword into their hearts each time, and killed them.Then, one day, in a situation in which Baek Joong-hyuk was organizing his forces and himself to take on a good role within the sect, the eldest son, the strongest heir to the sect, came to him and said, \u201cJoong-hyuk, do you know what your problem is? You don\u2019t show even the slightest bit of compromise. The moment you acknowledge someone as your enemy, you do not even intend to take advantage of them and decide to drive them to their end as soon as possible. One day, that trait of yours will come and bite you back. Even if they are weaker than you, you do not know what someone you consider your enemy and are sure to kill will do when they get cornered. That is the fatal problem with you.\u201dThe eldest son, Baek Ho-yeol, was quite strong. Furthermore, beyond simply being strong, he showed the tolerance to accept those he once considered enemies under him. Truly, he was a great human being. Baek Joong-hyuk, as well, had no choice but to acknowledge him; however, that didn\u2019t mean that he agreed with everything Baek Ho-yeol chose to do.Covered in blood from top to bottom, Baek Joong-hyuk looked up at Baek Ho-yeol and said, \u201cAs you said, compromise is often required. However, if I see someone being hostile toward me, the only way for me to continue living peacefully is by crushing them down entirely. So don\u2019t say those words to me. I have lived like this from the time I was at the very bottom position in the Demonic Sect, and I will continue to live like this in the future, as well.\u201dBefore reaching the peak, it was obvious that Baek Joong-hyuk would have to face a lot of enemies. However, if he killed everyone he met, obviously, Karma would catch up to him. Thus, Baek Ho-yeol often tried to advise him by saying that. Well, it wasn\u2019t as if he was utterly wrong. Those who were once Baek Ho-yeol\u2019s enemies had now become some of his most reliable allies.However, Baek Joong-hyuk\u2019s method for dealing with such situations was different. There was no reason to keep the enemy alive. Death was the only way to block the possibility of a variable, and moreover, he had earlier learned to use one\u2019s fear.The current situation wasn\u2019t much different. Barco would always think of themselves as the main characters. Also, Roman knew that if he showed Anthony mercy now, obviously, Barco would later again attempt to direct such a situation with forged documents.And finally, after finishing his thought process,Slash!\u201c\u2026.Kuak!\u201cRoman Dmitry beheaded Anthony Barco. His face falling down the floor was simply stunned. While looking at Roman in disbelief, his body could only try to follow his last instincts\u2014to try and stop the blood gushing out of his neck like a fountain with both of his hands.Thud!Finally, after his body knelt down, Anthony fell forward on his face.3The death of Anthony Barco was a result that no one had expected to happen within the viscount\u2019s estate itself.This reminded me of Elsa.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fSeppuku is a form of Japanese ritual suicide by disembowelment.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fWell, according to the raws, he was beheaded, so, I guess the author made a mistake.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54 - If You Start Something, You Must See Its End (4)Drip. Drip.Blood dripped down Roman\u2019s sword.Seeing the death of Anthony Barco, all the nobles who were present there were obviously shocked, and Viscount Barco was wailing.\u201cNo! Noooooo!\u201dGrab.He hurriedly embraced Anthony Barco\u2019s limp body. His high-quality fabric clothes were wholly stained with blood, and Viscount Barco tried to stop the blood flowing from his son\u2019s neck, trembling. However, it was entirely meaningless. Although his son\u2019s body was still a bit warm, his eyes had already lost focus, and his arms had fallen down.1\u201c\u2026Ahhhhh!\u201dViscount Barco couldn\u2019t accept his son\u2019s death. He never imagined his son would be killed right before his eyes one day.\u201cAhhhh! What are you all doing?! Kill this demon who dared to kill the eldest son of Barco, right now! Tear his limbs apart!\u201d Viscount Barco screamed.At the sight of him shouting out loud, looking like a madman, the knights of Barco hesitated. They all had witnessed Roman on the battlefield. Naturally, they weren\u2019t confident about rushing head first into the man who slaughtered the soldiers in the rear, took down the Flare, and even killed Homer and Berge with a single slash.They were sure\u2014whoever rushes at him first would definitely die. And due to the fear of death creeping into their bodies, and the shock of Anthony Barco\u2019s death, their loyalty was gradually faltering.Swipe.Roman wiped the blood off his sword. Then, he sheathed his sword, looked around, and asked everyone present, \u201cIs there some problem? Isn\u2019t it normal for a criminal to die in the Duel of Judgement?\u201dViscount Barco was utterly mistaken. Roman offered a duel, but he never said he wouldn\u2019t kill Anthony Barco. Yes, it was a trap. Roman hadn\u2019t brought a single escort with him when he came to Barco. Being Viscount Barco, he thought Roman would choose to cut down a limb or something, at most. However, Roman had done something utterly different. Also, Roman had the right to do it as it was Viscount Barco himself who gave Roman the chance to punish his son. Thus, it couldn\u2019t be said that Roman was at fault for killing Anthony. He simply gave him the punishment he deserved.Roman warned those who were at a loss for words and couldn\u2019t decide what to do.\u201cFrom now on, keep in mind what I say. From the day Anthony Barco threatened me, I couldn\u2019t live under the same sky as him. I am just that kind of a person. I couldn\u2019t sleep without paying back for what I suffered, so I kept thinking about how to bring down the Barco family. The situation in front of you is the result of that. And if there are still some people left who won\u2019t leave Barco\u2019s side, look carefully at who you will be dealing with.\u201dMany say the cornered mouse bites the cat. Chris also dissuaded Roman for that reason, and in the past, Baek Ho-yeol warned him of that, as well.However\u2026If one lets the mouse live due to the fear of being bitten, it will come back with a gang of its own to seek revenge on the cat.Thus, Roman never did that. Even if it meant his own flesh being torn apart and blood dripping down, it was something he would never do\u2014He would never let the mouse get away.Viscount Barco was stunned. His eyes were burning with revenge as he shouted, \u201cDo you think you will be fine after doing this?\u201d\u201cAgain\u2026 What do you even mean? From the moment I joined the war and went to Lawrence\u2019s side, it was clear that Barco and I would be enemies for the rest of our lives. And obviously, such a relationship will not change until you die, Viscount Barco. I will not be careless for even a single moment and carefully watch each step the Barco family takes, and I also plan to keep attacking until Barco is wholly destroyed.\u201dOn the surface, it was a threat to Barco, but those who were wise knew that it was a warning to all the nobles who were present there\u2014Roman was showing them how dangerous it would be if they tried to help the Barco family even a little bit. It was a warning that if anyone tried to support or stay by Barco\u2019s side while Roman was attacking, he would destroy them without any hesitation, as well.Naturally, at Roman\u2019s warning, every noble decided to give up on Barco. They just kept their mouths shut. Even the knights of Barco only held their swords, but didn\u2019t rush forward.\u201cI will leave for now.\u201dHe took a step back and walked through the front door alone. Although blood dripped down the path Roman was walking, no one dared to stand in his way. And just like that, leaving behind Viscount Barco, who was screaming, he disappeared wholly.Next, Barco\u2019s collapse was instantaneous.Angered by his son\u2019s death, Viscount Barco tried to get revenge, but all reactions he got back were as cold as frozen ice.\u201cI am sorry. However, as you know, we are not confident enough to help Barco against Dmitry. I admit that we had a good relationship, but Barco touched an extremely dangerous enemy.\u201dThey all drew a line. Even for nobles like them, Roman\u2019s actions were too shocking. He stepped into the estate of Barco on his own and killed Barco\u2019s son right before his eyes. It was an act that instilled fear into everyone who was there.Roman Dmitry made it clear that he didn\u2019t intervene in Lawrence and Barco\u2019s affair just because of impulsive decisions but because he wanted revenge and had a clear cause.Anthony Barco\u2019s threat had led to an ugly outcome. And Viscount Barco\u2019s judgment had resulted in the duel itself. Thus, the nobles who were once on Barco\u2019s side instead turned into witnesses of Roman\u2019s actions and told others that Roman had a good cause. Thus, Barco had no way left to get outside help.After his son was killed, Barco lost his reasoning, and he even ran and begged other nobles, but no one helped him. His connections in the Central Government weren\u2019t much different, either. Even though they had known each other for quite a while, they were reluctant to side with him and said the incidents had made the situation quite difficult. And like that, Barco\u2019s connections and plans were obliterated.Obviously, Roman\u2019s judgment was correct\u2014When a cornered rat is completely trampled on, there was no way, even for someone like Viscount Barco, to overcome the crisis.Also\u2026\u201cThere are only three days left until the time you promised to pay back the principal and interest comes. If the payment isn\u2019t made by then, the Golden Bank has no other way but to exercise its rights. Viscount Barco, you have 3 days. Even if you have to sell your soul to the devil, be sure to pay back the money.\u201dAn ultimatum arrived. As Viscount Barco knew about the infamy of the Golden Bank, famous for collecting back its money by any means, he realized that it was all over for him now.The greed for Lawrence\u2019s land had caused a disaster for Barco. Seeing the desperate reality, he had no other choice but to use his last resort\u2014A few days later, Viscount Barco attempted to escape at night. Even though he fled with minimal luggage and items, he was found dead in an unknown mountain.It was the moment the Barco family, one of the most prestigious in the North-East, were wholly destroyed, in vain.It was a moonlit night.Hans, out in the hallway, asked the man who was shining under the moonlight.\u201cWhere are you going out at night?\u201dHalt.The man stopped walking. Then, Roman, the man, turned his head and looked at Hans.\u201cThe moonlight is bright. It has been a while since I went out for a walk.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Hans laughed softly. Then, he walked over to Roman, took out a handkerchief from his pocket, and wiped off the red stain on Roman\u2019s clothes.\u201cEveryone is truly worried. It is a pleasure to see you being recognized by others, but I cannot help but be anxious, as well, because you are doing dangerous things like war. Young master, you are the eldest child of the Dmitry family. As you are the one who will inherit the estate someday, you should think more about your precious life. Always be careful. And if you need help, do tell me. I am always ready to do my best for you.\u201dSwish.Hans kept cleaning the stain. It was only when the stain was off that he looked at Roman proudly.Seeing that look, Roman said, \u201cHans.\u201d\u201cTell me, young master.\u201d\u201cI told you before. You are my person.\u201d\u201cI remember that.\u201dStarting a new life in this world, Roman accepted Hans as his first person. That meant his relationship with Hans was quite special.As he was the Heavenly Demon, Baek Joong-hyuk, he slaughtered numerous people before he obtained that position. He lived a life filled with so much carnage that his enemies\u2019 blood was enough to make a sea.Obviously, it wasn\u2019t a life any normal human could live. People often called him a vicious demon because of how terribly he trampled on his enemies; however, he was always surrounded by people.Why?It was because of his most important principle\u2014He always did his best for those who were in his circle2.In fact, it was so much that he had done much more for one person in his circle rather than what he had done for hundreds and thousands of enemies combined.And obviously, each person in his circle was important to him. That was enough for everyone.He was convinced that if he had let Barco get away after their threats, his circle would have become a mess.\u201cI, as well, will do my best not to put my people at risk.\u201dThe Barcos were no longer a threat. Why? Because the dead cannot do anything.After that, Roman turned around and went into the room.Squeak.Thud!Hans stood there watching the door Roman had disappeared into for a long time.The capital of Cairo, Kairos.A piece of unbelievable news arrived at a place where large crowds from all over the kingdom often gathered.\u201c\u2026Is this the truth?\u201d\u201cYes! I couldn\u2019t believe it at first either. However, many witnesses had seen Homer get defeated in the Battle of Great Warriors. Isn\u2019t that really amazing? A guy named Roman Dmitry, an unknown person whose name is not known anywhere, and even far from being listed on the Rankings, defeated a 4-Star swordsman with one hit!\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dPriest Willas, who managed the Valhalla Temple\u2019s branch in Cairo, frowned hearing what the fuss was all about.\u00a0\u2018It can\u2019t be possible.\u2019Rank 49, Homer\u2014A deity-like being whom the temple of Valhalla had been keeping a close eye on recently, was killed by an unknown person?Even if it was true, the problem was the opponent\u2019s identity. The North-East region of the Cairo Kingdom was so remote that no one even bats an eye on it, so he couldn\u2019t imagine someone so strong originating from there and even being strong enough to defeat Homer with a single hit.Who is Roman Dmitry? Had he heard his name even once in his entire life, he could have tried to comprehend the shocking news.After a while, Willas said, \u201cWhat is certain is that Roman Dmitry is 25 years old. And if this report is true, it means that an unprecedented genius has been born in the Cairo Kingdom. We need to check these facts first. No matter how likely it is a lie, the ripple effect that will arise from this cannot be ignored.\u201dThe Valhalla Temple belonged to the Valhalla Empire and usually managed the Rankings through \u2018Ranking Battles.\u2019 Still, it was necessary to mobilize manpower in situations like the current one.Honestly, they were all interested\u2014Was this just a baseless rumor? Or was this the birth of a monster-like genius? They wanted to see the face of Roman Dmitry.\u201cGo get your bags right now.\u201d\u201cYes\u201dHowever, they didn\u2019t know it back then\u2014From the North-East region of the Cairo Kingdom, the wind which would one day significantly change the entire Salamander Continent was blowing.Thus, a sharp awl began to pierce the pocket of peace, albeit little by little.In chapter 53, the author stated Roman had beheaded Anthony, but here, it seems different. I guess the author forgot about it.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fIn the initial chapters, this was termed as 'fence.' We will be using circle here onward.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 - Everyone\u2019s Man (1)While the issues related to the Barco family were still being discussed all around, Rihanna Dmitry went to a banquet after quite a long time.\u201cOh, my! You are here!\u201d\u201cI was waiting for you to come!\u201dAt her arrival, all the wives of the North-East region, who had gathered in advance, stood up from their seats.The organizer of this meeting was Helena of the Meloch family.From the beginning, she was famous as a pro-Dmitry, but when Barco collapsed and Dmitry\u2019s name rose, she quickly organized a banquet. It was a show-off. She wanted to show the fact that the North-East region would now be dominated by the Dmitry family. Naturally, the wives of nobles moved to attend the banquet. However, some new faces were also seen there. The wives, who earlier sided with Barco, now welcomed Rihanna with a fake smile on their faces.\u201cSomehow, I think you are getting prettier day by day.\u201d\u201cRihanna, I have prepared a special wine for you. Think of it as my gift, and please enjoy it comfortably.\u201dTheir intention was obvious. Seeing the fall of Barco, the wives of the noble families who had fallen apart expressed their intention to attend the banquet and join hands with Dmitry. Their pride didn\u2019t matter.They visited Helena of the Meloch family every day to become friends with her, and after achieving that, they asked for even a single chance to meet with Rihanna Dmitry.Obviously, Rihanna was informed about the current situation in advance. She wasn\u2019t a fan of talking with strangers, but she knew what to do now.\u201cThank you.\u201dShe received their gifts and compliments as if it was natural to do that. There is something that people often misunderstand. They believe the Dmitry family has reached their current position due to the enormous wealth of Baron Romero. However, those who worked behind the scenes knew that it was only possible due to Rihanna\u2019s devotion.Rihanna created her own power by attracting wives in the North-East. It was a political thing that Baron Romero couldn\u2019t do. And Rihanna was able to form the pro-Dmitry with the wives she hung out with. If she hadn\u2019t assembled the board in advance, Dmitry might have collapsed long before they could even rival Barco as a powerhouse.Dmitry\u2019s wife, Rihanna, came into the banquet and naturally proved the status of Dmitry had changed.\u201cThank you all for gathering here. The reason we came together isn\u2019t because of some special reason but because we thought that as people living in the same region, we should at least get to know each other. Of course, not all of us have been looking in the same direction till now. However, as the situation has changed, we must also change with the changed reality.\u201dIt could be believed those words were said sarcastically. However, Rihanna secretly touched those who were on the side of Barco, and at the same time, she told them she would accept them. As a result of that, after the meeting, the wives will return to their families and tell the others that they should act better with the Dmitry family.It is a small thing, but this small thing will lead to a tremendous difference. Rihanna knew all too well from her experiences that letting the sides of Barco come here is to show them room for cooperation.The Dmitry family became a powerful force in the North-East region, all thanks to Rihanna\u2019s help. In the eyes of others, it may appear like a simple gathering of wives, but due to Rihanna\u2019s actions, Dmitry\u2019s power in the North-East would be solidified even further.And like that, they chatted for a while and had refreshments.The wives, who were sipping tea while talking to each other, now began to focus on one topic.\u201cRihanna, what do you think of our Veronica? I think she would be a good match for Roman.\u201dHelena\u2019s words made everyone stiff.Arranged marriage\u2014In the aristocratic world, it was a common thing. However, how does arranged marriage usually happen? Yes, it happens due to the discussions between wives at such banquets.Ignoring others\u2019 reactions, Helena, who was lucky to initiate the conversation, added, \u201cRoman is already 25 years old. For a brighter future, I think it will be necessary for him to find a wise wife and begin a family, as well. Although it is a bit embarrassing to compliment my own daughter, I think Veronica would look good with Roman. Am I being too confident now? Hahaha.\u201d Helena covered her lips and smiled, turning the air chilly.6 years earlier, Roman Dmitry was a major topic of discussion in the aristocratic world. As he was from the Dmitry family, many wanted to form a connection; however, knowing that he wouldn\u2019t be the successor of the family despite being the eldest, they halted.At that time, apparently, Helena said, \u201cVeronica is a bit too young to be with Roman. It will be better once she is a bit older, and maybe I will think about the marriage then.\u201dShe was a pro-Dmitry. However, she was reluctant to let her daughter get married to Roman. No family wanted to give their child to Roman in the past to the point that they talked about marrying the second son. The other people also reacted similarly.However, now, those people, who had similar attitudes as Helena in the past, were reacting with discomfort hearing her words.\u201cHey, aren\u2019t Veronica and Roman different, though? I heard that Veronica got arranged with another family heir not long ago. Helena, I understand your greed, but that is too much for Roman,\u201d said one lady. She was someone who earlier had a character of calling Roman names right in front of Rihanna. She would even call him \u2018trash\u2019 in front of her, but now, she was appreciating Roman\u2019s value.\u201cThat\u2019s right. The marriage of Roman has to be done carefully. Don\u2019t limit the options, Rihanna. It is good to meet a variety of people. In that sense, please visit our family once in the future, as well. I didn\u2019t tell you this earlier, but my child said she fell in love with Roman at first sight,\u201d said another lady. She, too, would often curse Roman too much earlier. However, now, she had completely forgotten her past actions and was asking for Roman\u2019s hand for marriage.The situation had turned into a total mess due to the flames ignited by Helena. The wives who attended this gathering showed greed for Roman. It wasn\u2019t just about parents wanting Roman for their own daughters, but even for cousins. It was a fun sight. Due to the incident with Barco, Roman\u2019s value had skyrocketed. Well, it couldn\u2019t be helped. Honestly, Roman had shown his potential by going against the 4-Star Aura Swordsman, Homer. It proved the Dmitry family would be in his grasp in the future. And naturally, people\u2019s thoughts changed. Not long ago, the annulling of engagement with Lawrence was considered a blemish; however, no one seemed to care about it now. Rather, they considered themselves lucky, thinking Lawrence didn\u2019t snatch Roman.Tap.\u201cIt makes me happy that everyone thinks so good about my son.\u201dRihanna put the teacup down.The current atmosphere wasn\u2019t bad. Nevertheless, she had no intention of using her son for any political gains.\u201cRoman had been through a lot of pain recently. He was promised the daughter of the Lawrence family, but for bad reasons, they had to break it down. And then, I had this thought\u2014I shouldn\u2019t allow Roman to go through the same pain again. Thus, talking about arranged marriage makes no sense to me. I hope he finds someone he truly loves and who loves him back the same way. That is all I want from Roman\u2019s better half.\u201dRihanna drew a clear line\u2014There will be no arranged marriage.Still, the problem is that her words ignited rivalry among the wives.\u2018In other words, regardless of the status, the one who captures the heart of Roman wins?\u2019Then, he\u2019s everyone\u2019s man.Because of the greed for Roman, the expressions of the noble wives changed instantly.After the war was over, Flora locked herself in her room. Fortunately, Lawrence survived, but her experiences on the field had given her too much of a shock.\u2018I need strength to live in the world.\u2019The war between Lawrence and Barco was one where it was natural for them to have lost. Lawrence couldn\u2019t even afford a single Flare or someone like Homer.She had advised the Viscount to stock the food and last all the way through the winter because she read it in the books, but that was nothing like the reality she saw. The helplessness she felt at that time was horrible. As she watched the troops of the enemy rush in like ants, Flora felt her mind shatter. However, Roman was different. Due to the strength of a single individual, Barco was defeated, and the war was won.\u2018How in the world can one become that strong?\u2019It was amazing. It wasn\u2019t just about the individual\u2019s power. Roman showed the audacity to attack the rear of Barco with a small force, and even after hearing the name of Homer, he said he would fight. His courage was astounding. The confidence and strength somehow looked different on Roman. Still, what he was now was the ideal type she dreamed of. The imaginary being who was confident in everything began to overlap with Roman at one point.She shook her head, \u201cNo!\u201dShe didn\u2019t like the person named Roman. She couldn\u2019t believe that someone who was selfish and cared about their own interest could be her ideal type.However, she wanted to know a bit more\u2014How could Roman be so strong? What kind of person is Roman?The problem is that her relationship with him was broken, and she had no way of seeing Roman again.\u2018For now, let\u2019s focus on reality.\u2019She turned her attention to the book. She wanted to be strong, like Roman. She hoped for the power to solve any problem in any situation. So, even after the war was over, she stayed in the room with piles of books. Obviously, books are never the perfect solution. However, she at least wanted to relive this feeling of being stuck in a maze, even if it was only for a while.How many days passed?One day, she came out to get some fresh air, and saw an unexpected visitor.\u201cSister, it has been a while!\u2019\u201cSilvia\u2026?\u201dIt was a familiar face. She was a woman with typical beautiful features and had sky blue hair. She was her cousin, Sylvia.\u2018What is she doing here?\u2019It was surprising. Sylvia\u2019s father was the younger brother of Viscount Lawrence, who ceded the title of Viscount to his brother, and established himself as a merchant in the capital.Was it because she spent all her time in the capital? Sylvia was known to hate coming down to Lawrence. Like Flora, she had inherited the bloodline of Lawrence and had a pretty form. However, she was called Lawrence\u2019s Witch due to her picky side. And now this woman was in Lawrence? This all felt too abrupt for Flora to understand.\u201cWhy come to Lawrence? And\u2026\u201d She glanced at the girl from top to bottom. She looked pretty. Looking at the dress she was wearing, it didn\u2019t seem like this was a simple visit.\u201cWhat is with those clothes?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? I was told that a grand banquet was being thrown for the eldest child of the Dmitry family. Uncle told me that I should brighten up the place, so I came running here. However, sister\u2014Is Roman Dmitry really a great and handsome man? Everyone is speaking so many things about him that I am so curious,\u201d said Sylvia.When Sylvia showed off her appearance and talked about Roman, Flora felt uncomfortable.\u201c\u2026A grand banquet for the eldest son of Dmitry?\u201dThis wasn\u2019t a piece of small news. She should have known this. As Sylvia had already come to Lawrence, it was obvious that Flora should be preparing for the banquet now.Then\u2026\u2018Why am I hearing about it for the first time today?\u2019The banquet for Dmitry\u2014Flora didn\u2019t have an inkling of a clue about it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56 - Everyone\u2019s Man (2)The human heart is deceitful.If Flora had come to know about the grand banquet being held for Dmitry before the issue between Dmitry and Lawrence had happened, she would have made excuses to not go. However, things have changed, even setting aside her curiosity about Roman. For now, she needed time to reflect on herself. Thus, she stayed in her room for just a few days.Nevertheless, Sylvia said, \u201c\u2026Sister, you didn\u2019t know about the banquet? Oh, I guess uncle didn\u2019t tell you about it because of the annulment of the engagement. This grand banquet isn\u2019t being hosted by Dmitry but by Lawrence. As Lawrence just overcame an enormous hurdle with the help of Roman Dmitry, it seems that uncle has planned a grand banquet for him. He invited me, as well. I was happy, wanting to go to the banquet with my sister, but seeing the current situation, I will go by myself.\u201dIt was a heartbreaking moment. Even though Flora had no interest in the banquet, even though she didn\u2019t have any intention to participate in it in the first place\u2014she somehow felt angry.In particular, hearing Sylvia\u2019s words, Flora felt as if she was turned down by her own father.\u2018Did he not tell me about it for that reason?\u2019Due to the annulment?She admitted it was embarrassing. However, considering the banquet was to thank Roman Dmitry for helping them, she had all the right to go there.Honestly, wasn\u2019t it her judgment that drew Roman into their war?Flora struggled and smiled in front of Sylvia. However, as soon as their conversation was over, she went straight to her father.\u201cFather! There is a grand banquet being held for Dmitry. Why wasn\u2019t I told about it?\u201dShe asked it straightforwardly\u2014Why?She wanted to know what her father was thinking. However, the answer she was given was unexpected.Viscount Lawrence looked at Flora stiffly and said, \u201cFlora, through this incident, I, as your father, have realized a lot. Thus, I have made up my mind to never force you to do things you don\u2019t like in the future.\u201dTo be honest, this answer was embarrassing to say. However, the war with Barco was something Viscount Lawrence seriously pondered. In particular, most of it was about Flora\u2019s change. He constantly thought of her as a flower he needed to protect, but still, she showed her true self amid the crisis.\u2018I was stupid. Flora is a person who is capable of doing so much more, but due to my lack of insight, her full potential didn\u2019t come out. Flora\u2019s decision to annul the engagement was a natural choice. Flora deserves to live more for herself and not as someone else\u2019s woman.\u2019Watching his daughter fight till the end, Viscount Lawrence reflected on his actions. And what he realized was that he was terrible. He was a father who didn\u2019t know what his daughter was good at and forced her into marriage to solve the family\u2019s crisis. He never wanted to do that again. It was especially because he found out what his daughter was like. Thus, he made up his mind to not let her have regrets about her life.\u201cFlora, my daughter, at the crossroads of life and death, I, your father, witnessed a talent that shined brighter than anyone else. Even if it wasn\u2019t from a father\u2019s perspective, you looked very cool back then. We were able to win the war because of your judgment and knowledge of what to do in a situation where everyone had given up, by bringing Roman Dmitry into the battle. So, from now on, live your life the way you want to. I will not repeat the same mistake of dropping your value down again, and I am ready to support you in whatever you want.\u201dUndoubtedly, that was an inspiring statement. Viscount Lawrence looked at Flora with eyes filled with love. Nevertheless, the problem was that Flora didn\u2019t want this.\u2019\u2026I want to attend the banquet.\u2019Seeing that Sylvia was going to attend on her behalf, Flora didn\u2019t like it. She knew that Sylvia was a fox. When she imagined that woman flirting with Roman, she felt her mood turning grumpy.Honestly, she wanted to have a proper conversation with Roman. While speaking through the magic device, Roman said Flora was his person. Obviously, it was surprising for her. That was because she thought of him as cold and pragmatic. However, his action of taking revenge against Anthony for touching her made her want to see that man again. The time for self-blame was already over. Now, she was ready to face Roman.Was that why? Flora spoke differently than she usually did.\u201cBut why did you invite Sylvia to the banquet I wasn\u2019t told about?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because of my personal greed.\u201d\u201cGreed\u2026 no.\u201dViscount Lawrence laughed softly. He had already let go of his daughter. In the future, he had planned for Flora to live independently. However, he still felt greedy for Roman.\u2018He\u2019s a man to be coveted.\u2019In the recent war, the actions of Roman were shocking. He had boldly decided to change the flow of the war by attacking Barco\u2019s rear and defeating Homer with just one slash from his sword.Lately, people have been calling Roman Dmitry the Man of all Men. He was a man everyone in the North-East coveted, and naturally, Viscount Lawrence was no different. However, he couldn\u2019t use Flora for that. Therefore, he decided to invite Sylvia to replace Flora at the banquet.\u201cAhem.\u201d\u00a0Viscount Lawrence coughed.Seeing the viscount refusing to answer the question, Flora said, \u201cI understand. For that reason, I will help Sylvia and act like her guide. Still, this is an event to repay Roman Dmitry for what he did, and it doesn\u2019t make sense to not even tell me just because we were a bit entangled in the past.\u201d\u201cIt is fine. You don\u2019t have to go, daughter. I just hope you find someone you love in the future and marry him. I will not ask you to get involved with Roman Dmitry in the future, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d Viscount Lawrence didn\u2019t back down till the end.How can he be like this?For a moment, Flora wanted to bang her father on his head.In the end, it was decided that Flora would attend the banquet. However, it wasn\u2019t because of her stubbornness. She was about to give up due to her father\u2019s words, but then an invitation from Dmitry arrived.[Even though our relationship has deteriorated due to the unfortunate incident, how about proving to people that the recent incidents helped restore our relationship? Dmitry is ready to forget the past and start anew. At the grand banquet for Roman Dmitry, I hope the Flower of Lawrence will shine, as well.]Baron Romero is such a great man.Although Flora ignored Dmitry, Baron Romero responded first and told them that he wanted to reconcile their families. And that was a nice thing for Lawrence. With the collapse of Barco and the rise of Dmitry, if Dmitry showed a hostile attitude to Lawrence, then the Lawrence family would crumble to dust. Fortunately, that didn\u2019t happen, and Viscount Lawrence was relieved of his worries. Thankfully, Flora was allowed to attend the grand banquet, as well.Flora, Sylvia, and other noble families visited Dmitry together that afternoon. The party was scheduled for the evening, but many arrived early. Except for Flora, everyone had a clear purpose. It was to snatch Roman, so they wanted to get to the place in advance.\u201cThis is Dmitry.\u201d\u201cThe rumored place.\u201dWalking through the center, the ladies of noble families showed a dissatisfied reaction, and Sylvia\u2019s was quite bad because no one in Dmitry seemed to care about her beauty.\u201cI don\u2019t know anything else, but I came to know that the Lord of Dmitry doesn\u2019t know art. I don\u2019t know how they live in such a place. In the capital, even commoners care about aesthetics, but Dmitry looks so dull. I wonder if this isn\u2019t even a mining place.\u201dAnd the complaints continued.How far did they walk? As they were returning back, they saw an unfamiliar sight.\u201cOh!\u201d\u201cAre they miners?\u201dThey could see a series of hordes walking by far away. Their bodies looked dusty, as if they had just finished their jobs, and their faces were so black that they couldn\u2019t even be recognized at all. Instantly, the faces of women, curious at first, frowned. And as the miners approached and created some dust in the surroundings, the women covered their noses.\u201cAh, this pretty dress will get dirty.\u201d\u201cThis is why Dmitry is a problem. Even miners can freely roam in the streets.\u201dIt was a dual attitude. Nobles in the North-East region acknowledged the power of Dmitry, but knowing that Dmitry is a family that originated from commoners, they thought Dmitry was different from those of noble births.However, Flora\u2019s reaction was different. At one time, she, too, hesitated to get married to Dmitry due to such prejudices, but now that she knew Roman a little, she realized how foolish she had been. Now she didn\u2019t judge people so harshly. Due to that, she didn\u2019t walk too far away from the miners, unlike the others. Instead, as she knew that the miners were the source of wealth of Dmitry, she looked at them with curious eyes. Nevertheless, when she recognized someone within them, she was utterly shocked.\u2018Surely!\u2019She was certain of the familiar face\u2014One of the miners was Roman Dmitry. At first, she thought she had seen it wrong. Why did Roman Dmitry appear with these miners? That too in shabby clothes, skin soiled with dirt. However, the face visible under the hard hat was clearly that of Roman Dmitry. And just then, a middle-aged man rushed toward Roman.\u201cYoung master!\u201dYes, it was Hans. After glancing at Roman\u2019s condition, Hans wiped his face with his handkerchief.\u201cI might not have stopped you from going to the mine, but if you work so much, then what about your body\u2019s condition? Will you not feel pained? Didn\u2019t I tell you? Young master\u2019s body doesn\u2019t belong to the young master alone. And my fragile heart will be torn each time you come back covered in dust. Take a look at this. Even after wiping just a little, the handkerchief turned dirty!\u201d\u201cIt is alright.\u201d\u201cNo! It isn\u2019t!\u201dWas it because Hans\u2019 voice was loud? The ears of the noblewomen, along with Sylvia, heard it\u2014Dmitry\u2019s young master. Now that the rest of the sons had left Dmitry, there was only one person Hans could call young master. And that was Roman Dmitry.Instantly, the noblewomen\u2019s eyes turned to Roman.\u2018Then that man is Roman Dmitry?\u2019Their eyes were like a hyena that had caught its prey.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 - Everyone\u2019s Man (3)Silvia narrowed her eyes at Roman Dmitry. She looked carefully at her prey, who popped up here unexpectedly.\u2018Oh!\u2019He was more handsome than she expected. Even though his face was messed up due to the dust from the mine, the solid frame gave out a manly scent. Also, her admiration didn\u2019t end there. When her gaze, which was looking at his face for a long time, went to the body, a momentary exclamation came out, seeing the body frame revealed through the clothes.\u201cWow.\u201dIt was magnificent. As if it was a well-carved statue, Roman\u2019s body was flawless in Sylvia\u2019s eyes. She couldn\u2019t see them clearly because of the clothes he had on, but the gleaming muscles with sweat showed her an incredible scene.Honestly, she was regretting her decision of coming to Dmitry. She came to Lawrence due to her uncle\u2019s request, but she didn\u2019t expect Roman to be any good.Therefore, she had prayed that he was at least average. However, now that she saw him, it wasn\u2019t just that the appearance of the Roman was refined, but he was in absolutely perfect condition.\u2018The eldest child of the Dmitry family and the man who defeated the 4-Star Aura Swordsman, Homer. There was a rumor that the second child had a high chance of taking the position of the heir, but after today, I don\u2019t think that will happen. What noble family would let their son work in a mine? Baron Romero must have ordered him to do this in order to bring favor onto Roman\u2019s status.\u2019Well, it was worth coming down to Lawrence.Silvia, done with her analysis, encouraged the noble women.\u201cLet\u2019s go meet Roman Dmitry. It will be nice to greet him before the banquet.\u201d\u201cYou think so?\u201dEveryone had smiles on their faces. They, too, had the same purpose for coming here. Their mission was to win over Roman\u2019s heart, so they all encouraged each other to make a move.\u201cHello.\u201d\u201cAre you Roman Dmitry?\u201dThe women who were frowning until the last second were now smiling. Now, it didn\u2019t matter if the dust flew into their eyes or their dress got dirty; they all smiled like spring blossoms to Roman.However, Roman didn\u2019t answer. Then, Silvia, who was staring at him, said, \u201cI am Silvia of the Lawrence family. I wanted to express my sincere gratitude to you for helping out our family this time. Without the help of Mr. Roman, the Lawrence family wouldn\u2019t have survived the attack of the Barco family. However, as the rumors say, you are a wonderful man. There is a saying that a hero was born in the Dmitry family, and I can see why they refer to you like that.\u201dShe was a sly fox. She spoke softly without the slightest hint of a frown to try and appeal to Roman. Nevertheless, the problem was that it was Roman she was dealing with.\u201cAh, yes. I understand.\u201d That was what he said. It wasn\u2019t even an answer. It was more like, \u2018don\u2019t bother me.\u2019 Without even giving any attention to Silvia, Roman only turned and looked at Hans.At that moment,\u201cPfft.\u201dFlora, who was in the distance, burst into laughter. Truly, Roman was quite consistent with his attitude. Knowing that she wasn\u2019t the only one going through a tough time, she approached Silvia to comfort her. And Hans followed Roman.\u201cYoung master. They are people who will be coming to the banquet later. Can\u2019t you be a little kinder to them?\u201d\u201cI would if they were worth it. However, I do not want to smile looking at them, right from the start.\u201d\u201cSigh.\u201dNaturally, Hans sighed. If only Roman was a bit kinder, he could possibly have gained allies as he encouraged the women who came to greet him. However, Hans thought Roman was acting a little childish, seeing him draw a clear line right from the beginning.Hans said, \u201cI see. But how long do you plan to work in the mine? Even though the lord didn\u2019t give any orders for you to do it, you have been suffering there for days already. Everyone is worried.\u201dRecently, there were a lot who discussed Roman\u2019s actions. In particular, Baron Romero and Rihanna were concerned about Roman\u2019s health. Thus, Hans asked the question on their behalf.Roman didn\u2019t stop walking and said to Hans, \u201cDo you remember the farmer we met in the slum?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dHe could never forget it. That was the day Roman began to change, and the impact of it was so strong that the memories were clear as crystal in his mind.\u201cThe man who lived for 90 years told me the history of Dmitry. Dmitry was originally a commoner\u2019s family, but it was said that we were able to rise to the present position with the iron that came to the blacksmiths. From then on, I kept pondering it\u2014Dmitry\u2019s roots are the forge and metal, then shouldn\u2019t I know more about them?\u201dIn his new life, Roman had already accepted reality. He allowed new people into his circle, and the name Roman Dmitry was something he was now getting used to. Thus, he fully wanted to understand Dmitry. It wasn\u2019t even closely related to thoughts of being the heir. Just as he climbed to the apex of the Demonic Sect from the bottom, he wanted to feel the breath of this place right from the bottom. And that is why he went to the iron mine. Most people thought that the blacksmiths were the foundation of Dmitry, but Roman believed that it was the miners. He didn\u2019t even bother asking his father for permission; he suddenly went to the iron mine by himself and said he would work. The master of the mining doubted Roman\u2019s words but then accepted him. From then onward, Roman would spend his entire days mining the iron ore and taking in the dust. He tried to do as much work as he was assigned without even the slightest irritation.\u201cThe roots of Dmitry might lie in the forge, but furthermore so in the iron mines. The origin of Dmitry is that the miners worked hard in the mines, and then we managed to use the ores over the flame and turn them into our power. I just want to experience and empathize with it. Only then can I truly understand their plight. In order for me to live in the name of Roman Dmitry, I cannot just coexist with the people of this land through simple understanding.\u201d\u201c\u2026Young master.\u201dHans stopped walking as tears welled up from within.\u2018Just when did you grow up this much?\u2019Truly, Roman had suddenly grown up. Roman\u2019s walk now signified dignity and a different image. Hans was so proud to be under Roman.Despite Roman not waiting for him, Hans didn\u2019t care and caught up to him as he said, \u201cFrom now on, I will take full responsibility for the young master\u2019s attire from morning to evening! I will clear this dust right away! As always, I will clean it all up! I, Hans, am ready to dedicate myself to you!\u2019Even if it was till the end of time, Hans followed Roman.Finally, the place Roman arrived at was the training ground. On the massive training ground, dozens of men were already sweating.\u201cOne.\u201d\u201cOne!\u201d\u201cTwo.\u201d\u201cTwo!\u201dThey were swinging their swords at the command.Chris walked in front of the soldiers and pointed out their forms, and the soldiers focused on wielding their swords by adjusting their forms.The war with Barco was an experience that aroused a blind loyalty within them. Didn\u2019t Roman simply defeat a 4-Star swordsman? And didn\u2019t Chris also defeat a 3-Star swordsman?After seeing that, their perception changed. They no longer thought Roman and Chris were at a level around them, much less the same as them.\u201cChris.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dChris ran at the call, and the soldiers continued to train regardless of that.When he arrived in front of him, Roman asked, \u201cHow is the training going?\u201d\u201cI am teaching them what the liege has taught me. Everyone is quite enthusiastic about learning it, so I think we can quickly develop our strength.\u201dThe war was already over, but Roman felt the need to expand his power. Thus, through Chris, he taught them the basic training of the Demonic Sect. He was teaching the Retribution Cultivation for the internal qi1\u00a0and how to effectively defeat the opponent with the Retribution Sword Technique. In fact, in the Demonic Sect, it was a mere basic technique. However, in Roman\u2019s world, it can be counted as one of the greatest treasures to ever exist.Roman rewarded those who followed him to the war by allowing them to learn the Retribution Sword Technique and walk on the path that would lead them to become Aura Swordsmen. Thus, even 30-year-old swordsmen could encounter the miracle of entering the path of Aura Swordsmen.\u2018This alone will not be enough.\u2019This war had variables\u2014The Flare and Homer. It was information that Roman failed to get, and the lack of information made him almost fall into a trap. Fortunately, this time, strength solved the problems. However, his past life experiences have taught him that problems cannot be solved in that way forever.\u2018I need my own information force. An information force that can analyze every detail of my opponent from head to toe. The only problem is that one needs money and manpower to create such a force, and I cannot afford it yet. So I have to find a way to make the most of it with my status and situation.\u2019The mine was just an extension of his plan. As he told Hans, there was the purpose of wanting to experience the roots of the family, but Roman wanted to see the true source of the Dmitry family. He wanted to see the reality as only when one understands the raw reality can they find a way to use it to their advantage.The man now known as Roman doesn\u2019t simply move. He always has a clear purpose; even in a situation where there are a lot of hazy things, he doesn\u2019t say anything and stays faithful to his role.And finally, Roman had one more thing to do.\u201cChris, I will teach you a new sword technique now.\u201dHearing Roman\u2019s words, Chris felt his heart skip a beat.\u2019\u2026Teach me a new sword technique?\u2019Chris felt dissatisfied when he taught the soldiers how to move their swords. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t trust Roman, but he couldn\u2019t understand Roman\u2019s intention as he didn\u2019t teach him anything. Well, he did learn the Retribution Sword Technique and Retribution Cultivation Technique; however, while teaching it, Roman told him to only learn it as a teacher and not practice or make it his main sword technique.And finally, Roman told him why he did that.\u201cYou have a different starting line as compared to the others. Unlike people who didn\u2019t learn anything till now, it isn\u2019t easy for you to build your own world and accept new things. Thus, I hoped to stimulate flexibility in your thoughts and broaden your mindset\u2014To help you develop the ability to change your thoughts according to what you see and hear instead of being chained down to fixed thoughts and stereotypes. If you hadn\u2019t shown the courage to accept the new changes, you wouldn\u2019t have survived the battle with that 3-Star Aura Swordsman.\u201dThe fight with Janson was a simple test. And in that test, Chris overcame his limitations and beheaded a 3-Star Aura Swordsman. Now, he was ready to be taught new things.Seeing Chris looking at him with burning eyes without answering, Roman said, \u201cThe name of the sword technique I will teach you is \u2018Lightning.\u2019\u201dLightning Sword Technique\u2014A technique so great that it once commanded the Murim. That technique, which was known as one of the Great Ten Techniques of Murim, was now being learned by Chris.This was initially written as ki. We will be using qi here onward because that's how it's written in most Murim novels, and that's what most readers are familiar with.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 - Everyone\u2019s Man (4)Soon, the time for the banquet arrived.At the banquet, Roman\u2019s appearance was completely different from before. During the day, he was covered in dust from the mine, and then he and Chris spent time in the training ground right before the banquet, yet he appeared dignifiedly now.The appearance of Roman, whom everyone had been waiting for, was magnificent. When he walked into the banquet hall, the people who were talking held their breath simultaneously.\u201cYoung Master Roman Dmitry enters!\u201dRoman looked around and greeted people. There was not even the slightest stern look on him now. As this was a banquet being held for him, Roman understood and acted like the protagonist of the banquet, and despite being rejected by him earlier, the noble women still showed interest in him.\u201cMr. Roman, why did you act like that during the day? I just wanted to converse a little before the banquet.\u201d\u201cI had just finished my work in the mines, so I had no choice but to do that due to my shabby look. I hope you understand my desire to look a little good.\u201d\u201cAh, so that was the reason.\u201dWas it because they liked the answer of Roman? From then on, everyone smiled at Roman\u2019s words.Their intention was clear as crystal. They all wanted to make some sort of connection with Roman, and at some point, only women could be seen around him. Among them, Sylvia stood out the most.\u201cYou certainly look like a wonderful person. Even though you are the heir to a noble family, you were working directly in the mines. My father always said that we should live longing to learn what happens below us, but unlike Mr. Roman, I couldn\u2019t put it into practice. If I had someone like Mr. Roman as my spouse, wouldn\u2019t that make it possible for me to change as I would see things being done by my companion?\u201dHearing Sylvia\u2019s blatant words, the people around them had no choice but to be stunned. However, Sylvia didn\u2019t care the least. She was pretty. She knew well about her appearance and learned from her previous experiences that she should make the first move whenever she could to affect another\u2019s mind. Honestly, it wasn\u2019t a bad method\u2014If it wasn\u2019t that the other person was Roman, someone who wasn\u2019t shaken even by the beauty of Flora Lawrence, the most beautiful woman in the North-East. If it wasn\u2019t Roman, the method might have worked.\u201cThank you for the undeserved praise.\u201d That was all Roman said. With that, he ended the conversation. Although he kindly accepted questions from all directions, he never allowed much liberty to them.How much time had passed?Roman, who had been tormented by women for a long time, secretly moved away from the banquet, and just then, he heard a familiar voice from behind.\u201cYou seem good at acting.\u201d The owner of the voice looked at Roman. Obviously, it was Flora Lawrence.Roman\u2019s face didn\u2019t look as kind as before. He didn\u2019t have to put up a kind face in a place where no one was watching, so he spoke coldly, \u201cI had to do it.\u201d\u201cIt is surprising. I didn\u2019t think you were the kind to care about the relationships between people.\u201d\u201cNormally, that is true. However, this is a banquet hosted by the Lawrence family for me, and my parents and their guests are watching. That means I must deviate from my usual behavior and act with minimal courtesy. And to say that it is surprising, I was the same when I first met you, as well.\u201dWhen Roman first met Flora, he was in robes. Thinking that the smell of blood wouldn\u2019t be polite, he sprayed some perfume and went out. Roman was such a kind person. Still, even though he was acting all nice, he showed appropriate behavior when needed.Flora said, \u201cIt is true. Rather, it was me who wasn\u2019t polite.\u201dIn her memory, Roman was a man of virtue. During the marriage talks, he kept his manners till the end, and it was only after the annulment was announced that he began to show a cold attitude.Come to think of it, the change was all her fault. Roman had tried to keep a suitable distance as her partner, but Flora didn\u2019t even notice it.He was a consistent person, so she felt more curious.How could Roman live like this? How could he be so firm in his character?\u201cBut why are you working with miners? Others think that it is a play for obtaining the title of the heir, but I don\u2019t remember hearing such things being done to become the heir. Wouldn\u2019t blacksmiths make more sense for the Dmitry family, not the mines?\u201dRoman normally wouldn\u2019t have answered Flora\u2019s question. However, when he remembered her appearance on the battlefield, he wanted to answer her due to her efforts.\u201cHow do you think Lawrence reached its current position?\u201d\u201c\u2026Uh?\u201d\u201cPeople often think Lawrence was revived due to their crops and fertile soil, but that isn\u2019t the case. The Lawrence family is one that succeeded in commerce. They knew how to use the crops that were grown and sold them for the right prices. Lawrence is now what it is because of that process. I heard that Viscount Lawrence\u2019s younger brother also used that talent to succeed as a merchant in the capital.\u201dHearing those words, Flora was utterly stunned. Lawrence\u2019s origin? Few people knew about it for sure. Honestly, even Flora thought fertile land was all Lawrence had not long ago.\u201cWhat\u2019s the significance of that here?\u201d\u201cI thought the forge and the iron mine was the foundation of Dmitry. Dmitry wouldn\u2019t have been successful like this today if it hadn\u2019t been for the miners who went into the iron mines every day. So, I wanted to fully understand Dmitry\u2019s land. I think it is the duty of one who has the name Dmitry attached to their name. If there comes a situation where I face one problem like Dmitry\u2019s people, I am sure that my time in the mines, which others cannot understand, will be of great help in empathizing with them.\u201dRoman\u2019s voice was firm. He said it as if it was something that was absolutely necessary. Seeing him come out assertively, Flora lost her words for a moment.\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201d\u201cTime is up. I need to go.\u201dThus, the conversation ended as Roman Dmitry turned back without any more words.Flora looked at him and felt as if she had been hit hard on her head.Truly, Roman always astonished her each time they met.People had recently begun to call Roman Dmitry the Man of All Men. Dmitry\u2019s reputation of having a fool for a son was never brought up, and everyone looked up to him now.What if she was in the position of Roman? Would she be able to work in a mine even if she heard praises from all directions?\u2018No, I would never be able to do that.\u2019Honestly, anyone would\u2019ve been like that. Sweet praises melt down the rationality in the brain, and even the most diligent person often falls due to them. They would try to enjoy reality from some point on. And it was especially true for someone like Roman. Even if he enjoyed the company of women, no one would criticize him.However, Roman was different. He neither got drunk on reality nor enjoyed it. As soon as the war was finished, he grabbed the pickaxe and headed straight for the mine, and while others enjoyed their lives, the hero slowly dug up iron in the mine.What kind of thoughts and mindset does he have that he lives and acts like that?Even Flora was someone who didn\u2019t waste time, but whenever she compared herself to Roman, she felt ashamed.\u2018He\u2019s such a great man.\u2019And he is respectful too.She wanted to imitate his actions. Aside from the fact that he was a bit selfish, Roman was her ideal man.Suddenly, Flora remembered what her father had said.\u201c\u2026From now on, live for your dreams. I will not repeat the same mistake of dropping your value to the ground and will be ready to support you anytime.\u201cViscount Lawrence said he didn\u2019t want her to live as the Flower of Lawrence. He just wanted her to live as Flora Lawrence. Also, his words promising to support her in whatever way she wanted filled her head.\u2018What is my dream?\u2019No matter what she thought, she didn\u2019t have a clear dream.Nevertheless, one thing was certain\u2014while watching Roman\u2019s progress, there was one thing she wanted to achieve.\u2018I must be strong so that others can never look at Lawrence again and to never entrust the safety of Lawrence to others. I want to overcome those dangers by becoming stronger myself. That is the goal I want to achieve.\u2019She made a decision and now had a firm dream.Her head, which was wandering around even after the war was over, had finally cleared up.After that, Flora left the banquet. There was no reason to stay there anymore. Now there was no reason to hold onto the being known as Roman Dmitry.A few days after, it was revealed that Flora had left Lawrence and had headed straight for the capital.It was the moment the Flower of Lawrence, the plant in the greenhouse, left the greenhouse and stepped out into the world.Time went by.It was revealed to everyone within a fortnight that the Barco family was destroyed.Today, a unique person visited the forge of Dmitry.\u201cHendrick! Hendrick!\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cWhat? I stopped by for a drink.\u201dThe man with a small physique looked nervously at Hendrick as he left the forge and smiled.Seeing the bottle in his hand, Hendrick started drooling. It was lunchtime, so Hendrick hurriedly removed the items on the table.\u201cAfter all, you are the only one who understands me, Jacob!\u201d\u201cRight?\u201dThe other man was Jacob. He, the overseer of the mine, poured alcohol into Hendrick\u2019s glass.\u201cUgh, this is good.\u201d\u201cHow was work today?\u201d\u201cIt was the same as usual. No matter how much we dig, iron keeps coming out. We have only touched the first part of the mountain, so it seems the Dmitry family will easily be able to run off the iron mines for a hundred more years. Ah, that is all. The life of Jacob The Miner is like that.\u201dHendrick and Jacob\u2014The two pillars of Dmitry often spent time together. Amid working hard, they often had a small break and took down the sweet drink.How long did they drink?Hendrick put down the glass and asked softly, \u201cBut, what about Roman Dmitry\u2019s condition? A week back, there was a lot of talk about him working in the iron mine. But the mansion is quite silent about it, right? Did he quit the job?\u201d\u201cAh, Roman?\u201dJacob smiled as he took down another drink.\u201cDon\u2019t even ask. Far from quitting, he hasn\u2019t missed a single day of work yet. At first, everyone was reluctant to have him as his intentions weren\u2019t known, but no miner hates him now.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dHendrick was stunned. Miners were as proud beings as blacksmiths. So how could they come to like Roman?\u201cWhat exactly happened in the iron mines?\u201dA lot had happened in Dmitry\u2019s iron mine during the last full moon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 - The Miners In The Iron Mine (1)On the first day, Roman got permission from Jacob, the master of the iron mines, to start working. And hearing that news, the miners were a bit displeased.\u201cDmitry\u2019s young master wants to work in the iron mine from today?\u201cRoman Dmitry? Why?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know the reason. Still, even though he said work, he will probably just act like working.\u201dNo one responded positively to the news. Well, it was expected. Unless Roman was somehow a worker who did real labor, he was just an inconvenient existence. Also, he wasn\u2019t just any normal person but Dmitry\u2019s eldest son\u2014The one who could one day become the heir of the family they served, wanted to work with them in the mines?In an obviously uncomfortable situation, the miners expressed their dissatisfaction. In particular, Morkan, a veteran miner, reacted harshly.\u201cLord Dmitry must have lost all his senses. It is good to educate his son, but what is he thinking by making him do this? Until now, mainly the blacksmiths have been taken care of, and we miners have been neglected. The children of Dmitry have gone to the forge from an early age, so they never learned to work in a mine as well. Such an attitude shows how he has discriminated against us.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you just leaping to the conclusion?\u201d\u201cI mean it! The mines are the skeletons, but the blacksmiths take all the glory!\u201dToday, the emotions Morkan had built up inside him were finally let out. Dmitry, known as the Mining City, is obviously made up of miners, and yet blacksmiths get praised better. Of course, this didn\u2019t mean that Baron Romero neglected them. However, despite the good working conditions, they showed a slightly discriminatory attitude toward him.Iron mines and forges\u2014They both are the roots of Dmitry, but the miners didn\u2019t like how the forge and the blacksmiths took all the glory for themselves\u201cRoman Dmitry must have been forced to do things he didn\u2019t want to, but he must be doing it to aim to be the next lord. The value of what we do is determined by our attitude. So don\u2019t think about bowing your head to Roman and show him how hard it is to work in these mines. That way, our story will finally get across.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cMorkan is right. Let\u2019s set an example for the young master of Dmitry.\u201dHendrick was right. In the beginning, the miners of the iron mine, the skeleton of Dmitry, didn\u2019t like Roman coming in to work with them.Roman dressed up and headed to the iron mine early in the morning. Obviously, there was no welcome ceremony of Roman. Everyone was busy yawning due to the lack of sleep and had tired faces as they put on the hard hats. In the iron mines, this was a regular day. Everyone stretched out their bodies and then followed the orders of Jacob, the master of Iron Mine.\u201cBe mindful. Working in the iron mines means our first priority is safety, the second is also our safety, and the third is safety, as well. We suppress our hunger to earn money and come to the mines daily. We must do our best to ensure that we all return home safely, so I hope everyone will follow the rules.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cWe understand!\u201dAfter the morning speech, the miners moved busily.\u201cYoung master, please follow the transport team and carry the soil and iron ore. It isn\u2019t a special favor, but we cannot give down the role of mining iron ore to a beginner like you, so you can help with the simple task of using strength. You seem to not care about what the others think, but if you get hurt here, people will look at us badly. So, please work carefully in here.\u201dJacob didn\u2019t like Roman either. He agreed to let him work because he was asked to, but he couldn\u2019t hide the anxiety the whole time.Roman obediently followed the orders. Here, as Jacob said, Roman is a beginner. Thus, Roman followed the others and reached the destination after a long way down the tunnel.\u201cCome on! Move quickly.\u201d\u201cYou will have to work diligently to meet the quota.\u201dSrrk.All the seniors began to move the soil and ore into the carts, and Roman silently helped them. He first moved the soil and iron together with them, and he would drag it out when the cart was full. From then on, it was a simple repetition. After some time, people who initially felt burdened to be working alongside Roman began concentrating on their own job as Roman was focused on his.\u2018Certainly, the system is well organized.\u2019The title of Mining City was not a lie. People quickly carried out the soil and iron ore, and they worked separately on their own tasks. And outside were people who took on the things loaded into the carts with them. The division of work was clear, and as a result of examining the tunnels during work, Roman realized the safety wasn\u2019t bad either. Iron and wooden posts were erected in various places to prevent the mine from collapsing, and a rail was on the ground that was used to pull the cart.This was a place where decades of Dmitry\u2019s history were piled up.While Roman was working, he carefully thought about everything he saw here.\u2018To plan for the future, I need to understand the land I live in, how the people of Dmitry live, how much power there is, and what I can do for Dmitry. These courses of experiencing Dmitry will help me.\u2019Experiencing everyday life\u2014That was Roman\u2019s way. Others might not understand why he was doing this, but Roman believed this was a much-needed process.Nevertheless, he couldn\u2019t figure out many things on the first day. As he was sweating and working, the sun set, and the day passed.On the third day, Roman heard an explanation from a miner.\u201cThe reason that Dmitry is in the spotlight isn\u2019t simply because it has a forge that is quite good. Because the iron ore is of the highest quality, the people of Cairo can recognize the true value of ironworks from Dmitry. All the iron ore ordered from the iron mine is first processed and then sold by Dmitry. In general, considerable losses occur in the distribution process of obtaining iron ore. Still, Dmitry is making a lot of profit as it handles the mining and processing of the iron ore with the manpower of the land. It isn\u2019t that the Dmitry family is called rich for nothing,\u201d said the miner proudly.Honestly, what he said was something Roman already knew. However, after listening to it from a miner\u2019s perspective, he realized the scale might be larger than he initially thought.\u2018The process of obtaining and distributing the materials is done with the manpower of the land. In addition, the highest quality iron ores are processed by the estate\u2019s forge and sold at higher prices. It has been working that way for decades. Dmitry\u2019s wealth may be greater than I initially expected. Still, Dmitry\u2019s wealth isn\u2019t my wealth. As the eldest child of the Dmitry family, there is a limit to what I can receive, so I need to find what I can do for the land.\u2019Just as he rose to the position of the successor of the Demonic Sect in his previous life, Baek Joong-hyuk would use his identity and background in his new life to increase his power and would rise to the level of Heavenly Demon.The actions he would take this time weren\u2019t much different. As a successor, he wasn\u2019t just going to wait for the kingdom of Cairo to fall into his hands; rather, he would do things to make it happen.To do that, he came to the iron mine. Dmitry\u2019s work would give a solution to Roman\u2019s thoughts, and with the results he would obtain, Roman intended to create his own \u2018power.\u2019 It would be something different from the power of his family. Even though he belonged to the Dmitry family, it felt foolish to keep using that background to get things running.He had a lot of questions. How many iron ore reserves are there? What is the daily production? Roman tried asking the questions to the miners, but Morkan, who was passing by, said.\u201cYoung master, this isn\u2019t a place for small talk. If you are here to work, then work, and if you don\u2019t want to work, at least don\u2019t disturb the others. We need to finish our daily quota.\u201d\u201cAhem.\u201d\u00a0Hearing those words, the miner talking to Roman was stunned. Nevertheless, Morkan looked at Roman, waiting for him to get angry.However,\u201cSorry. I will head back and focus on working.\u201d Roman stepped back.Was it because his reaction was different from expected? Watching Roman head back to work, Morkan couldn\u2019t take his eyes off him.It has been a week since Roman started working in the mines. He kept sweating daily while working and finishing his daily quota.Naturally, Roman worked side by side with the miners and heard many things. Still, it felt lacking. In fact, he could just talk to a miner to get his doubts clarified, but no miner was willing to do that.\u2018Is this like a fight for territory?\u2019From the first day, Roman knew that he was being rejected here. The miners deliberately tried to stay away from Roman, and even if some tried to converse a little, they would get pointed out by Morkan.Roman didn\u2019t try finding what the reason was. Even if this was his estate and he could use that to take them down, Roman thought that talking things through should be his first priority. So, he endured\u2014Because he was the one who asked for the job here. Roman is the heir, and he chose to work here himself, so he had to bow his head.Klang!\u201cLunch time! Everyone out!\u201dThe rest time came. As Baron Romero himself was from a commoner family, so he understood their difficulties and provided a perfect time for rest and work.Hearing that it was break and lunch time now, every miner stopped what they were doing and went out. Naturally, Roman went out as well. And instead of eating the luxurious food he had at home, he sat down on the dirt floor as if nothing was wrong and filled his stomach with thick bread and soup. At first, everyone looked at him like this was something strange. It was because even though it was a rather odd food for a noble to eat, Roman didn\u2019t have the slightest change in his expression.\u2018I can handle this much.\u2019In the previous life, Roman had experienced much worse things.When he was training in the sect, he had to endure a month without food. It was called the Ordeal of the Devil, and in the process, he had to feed on anything he could, from bugs to snakes. Bread and soup? This was like heaven when he thought of that time; moreover, he could fill his stomach.Roman shoved the food into his mouth, and before he knew it, the soup went down his throat.While he was eating, someone came and sat before Roman.\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d Morkan sat before him and asked that.Roman nodded, and Morkan, looking at him with dissatisfied eyes, asked, \u201cNow I understand that the young master is doing this for real. However, why are you working here?\u201dSeeing him the last few days, Morkan had no choice but to acknowledge that the Roman he saw now was a different person.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 - The Miners In The Iron Mine (2)There was only one reason for Morkan\u2019s prejudice. It was because there wasn\u2019t much interest in the iron mine.He didn\u2019t know why Roman came to work, but he couldn\u2019t ignore his attitude now.\u2019What the miners do is already well-known to the public. We work hardevery day to earn our pay and dedicate our lives to these tunnels. However, Roman Dmitry comes to work as if he is on a picnic. If he visited the forge with that kind of attitude, he would have been yelled at by Hendrick.\u2019Jacob was a good person. He didn\u2019t accept nor reject Roman, who came to work in the mine.On the first day, Morkan was a bit nervous. He worked around the point where Roman was working on purpose and kept an eye on Roman, trying to catch him red-handed skipping work. However, contrary to that, Roman worked harder than he thought. He thought he would only pretend to work, but Roman was actually meeting the quota like others. It was surprising.He is really working hard?He sometimes found him chatting, but that wasn\u2019t such a huge deal.\u2018Did he really come to help in the mine? Or did Lord Dmitry make him suffer just like us to push him to take on the position of the heir? I cannot believe the former, and the latter is too weird of a thing for Lord Dmitry to do. Rodwell Dmitry is the second son of the Dmitry family and has been through all kinds of troubles in the forge since a young time, but he did not come to the iron mine even once. Then what is Roman Dmitry, the strongest of them now, doing in the mine?\u2019It was bizarre. No matter what he thought, Roman\u2019s actions made no sense.At first, he thought Roman was doing work in the mine to become the heir, but that didn\u2019t make too much sense.And then, one day, Morkan heard words that were too shocking for him.\u201cI heard from a servant in the mansion that Lord Dmitry never gave the order for Roman Dmitry to work in the mine. I don\u2019t even understand why he is coming here and suffering, but at the very least, it\u2019s certain that this wasn\u2019t a decision someone else took for him.\u201dHearing those shocking words, his biased perspective on Roman vanished wholly.\u2018\u2026Why?\u2019In his one week working there, Roman was quite sincere. He got along well with workers without creating any trouble, and no one was dissatisfied with his work. The dissatisfaction they had on the first day had vanished as if it were a lie.As Roman gave up his status, ate the same meals as them and even showed up in the same way they did, they couldn\u2019t hate him anymore. Their thoughts had utterly changed. Roman Dmitry was better than they thought. When people got together to have meals, they looked at Roman and said he was different from what they expected.And in such a situation, Morkan couldn\u2019t contain his doubts anymore. The three heirs of Dmitry\u2014Among them, he wanted to check the purpose and thoughts of Roman Dmitry, the only one who came to work in the mine.And finally,\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201dMorkan approached Roman for the first time and then asked him a question about his purpose.Roman looked at Morkan and asked instead, \u201cWhat do you want to hear? The ideal answer or the realistic one?\u201dThat was also a reaction different from what Morkan had thought. He thought Roman would just tell him the reason, but instead, he asked Morkan to decide.The ideal answer or the realistic one\u2014Morkan wanted to know about both of them.\u201cCan you tell me about both of them?\u201d\u201cThen I will tell you the ideal one first.\u201dIdeal\u2014Just as he told Hans, it was a sweet answer.\u201cDmitry is a mining town. Just as Lawrence earns its livelihood through agriculture, Dmitry\u2019s estate makes its living through mine. So I wanted to experience first-hand what the daily life in Dmitry was like\u2014What it meant to live like a person of Dmitry. I didn\u2019t want to just hear about people from afar and with statistics. Instead, I wanted to face the reality of them by myself.\u201d\u201c\u2026Do you really have to do that?\u201d\u201cI need to. As long as I have the last name Dmitry, I need to.\u201dThat was Roman\u2019s ideal answer. These were the words one would want to hear from their leaders, and in an instant, his wariness against Roman vanished.Then what about the realistic one?\u201cThe real reason comes from the fact that I am not the lord of Dmitry. Even though Dmitry has enormous wealth, it belongs to my father, not me. So I intend to find out how much wealth Dmitry had accumulated, exactly how the estate works, and what I, as the eldest son, can do in the process.\u201d\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean? As your father is the lord, then doesn\u2019t everything already belong to you?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dFather and son were tied by blood. However, it didn\u2019t mean that he would inherit everything. The former Heavenly Demon had 12 kids. He passed on his knowledge to his sons, but in order to achieve something, one had to win it themselves. And it was then that Roman found out that even family can turn into strangers. In order to get as much of his father\u2019s things, he had to pay a reasonable price.\u201cI will ask you\u2014If I ask my father for 100 gold, how do you think he will react?\u201d\u201cOf course, he will ask why. 100 gold isn\u2019t exactly a small amount.\u201d\u201cThat is exactly why I came to the mine. If I am looking to do something for Dmitry\u2019s daily life, and even if it\u2019s something I want to do personally, I will constantly have to ask my father for something. It is my privilege as his son, and it is the same about me wanting to claim my rights. I need a lot of money and people for the things I want to do in the future. And rather than building it up down from the ground, I will try to use only my father\u2019s name and background and get what I need.\u201dIt was truly a bit too frank an answer. Nevertheless, Roman made his purpose clear with that.Seriously.Hearing the absurd and straightforward answer, Morkan couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\u201cKuahahahah! So that was the reason. You have to pay the price to claim your father\u2019s assets. I didn\u2019t even think of that. I simply thought that young master Roman came to the mine to aim for the successor\u2019s position, but I couldn\u2019t understand the hidden meaning.\u201dHe chuckled so much that it seemed his throat would burst at any moment.Roman\u2019s answer must have felt a bit bad. In the end, it meant taking advantage of the iron mine. Although, Morkan interpreted it differently.\u2018Young Master Roman came to the iron mine, not the blacksmiths. That means the miners\u2019 work is just as important as the others, and he must have considered it worthwhile enough to even cover himself in the dirt. That\u2019s good. In that case, I don\u2019t have to stop him.\u2019Acknowledging the miners\u2019 worth was enough for Morkan. In fact, all the miners wanted was approval from the people. Unknown to even himself, complaints about discriminatory treatment had piled up within him, and they erupted when he met Roman.However, Roman recognized the value of the mine and used them. And that was nice to hear for Morkan. And due to that, Morkan didn\u2019t care about being taken advantage of, so he asked, \u201cSo what are you so curious about? I will answer all of the questions I can with my knowledge.\u201dMorkan, who had been hostile from the first day till now, took down the walls around his heart. And from that point onward, the conversation proceeded smoothly. Roman asked many questions about the reserves of iron ore, the daily production, how they were distributed and further on. And Morkan honestly answered all his questions.\u201cPeople say that the iron mine of Dmitry is the largest one in the entire kingdom. However, in reality, it is much more than that. In fact, it isn\u2019t inferior to being the best out there. The Cairo Kingdom is located in the North-East region of the continent, and to the northernmost tip is where Dmitry lies. People call Dmitry the end of the continent, but in reality, it\u2019s different. Numerous mountain ranges lie in the North-East region and don\u2019t allow people to move further beyond. That\u2019s why people often depend on Dmitry\u2019s border roads. Thus, those mountains ended up being our source of income. Because it is an unknown world outside, no one forced them to be developed, and according to what we have learned, there are dozen more mines that haven\u2019t even been touched yet.\u201dThis was incredible information. Beyond the northernmost estate of the kingdom lay the place named Endless Mountains, and that place could be said to be the source of what made the Dmitry estate the richest in the North-East.There were numerous iron mines beyond Dmitry. And with the help of a single one, top-grade iron ores were obtained and then processed. Obviously, Dmitry had the necessary conditions to accumulate wealth. Roman knew the Dmitry estate had enormous wealth. Nevertheless, the information he had just gained was beyond imagination.\u2018The wealthiest family in the North-East region of Cairo. People say there is no end to their wealth, but Dmitry hasn\u2019t even fully used its potential yet. Then, if I give him the right cause and price, my father might truly fully support me.\u2019However, Morkan wasn\u2019t done even speaking yet. He next answered Roman\u2019s question about daily production, \u201cActually, Dmitry isn\u2019t very productive with the conditions we have as of now. That is why we don\u2019t sell iron ore immediately, and the working conditions are quite dangerous. As we try to work stably in here, the production speed turns slow, which further results in a decrease in production.\u201d\u201cFrom my experience, I think there are enough safety precautions.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s indeed true. Lord Dmitry has given us enough support to make the work here as safe as possible, but the mining is dangerous despite that. The mountain ranges in the North-East region are known to often have earthquakes. Thus, it is impossible for miners to go deep into the tunnel at times, fearing it might collapse at any time. Also, if an accident actually happens, the work is halted for days altogether. However, this isn\u2019t a problem that can be solved. How can a human being prevent natural disaster?\u201dThat was the real problem. Even though they had the best possible conditions, Dmitry couldn\u2019t fully utilize the resources due to safety concerns.Nevertheless, that was the kind of answer Roman was waiting for.Hearing the attractive point of safety issues, Roman asked, \u201cIf\u2026 If that is somehow handled once and for all, how much will Dmitry benefit from it?\u201d\u201cI cannot say for sure, but let\u2019s put it at around 50% more production than our current one. The reason we do not use excessive manpower in the mine is because the lives of the miners working in it cannot be guaranteed. So only the number of people who can be managed get sent in after they are informed about the safety. However, that is another reason Lord Dmitry is a wonderful person for us. Even though it would benefit him, he never pushed us to work harder because of safety reasons.\u201dAs Morkan said, Baron Romero was a good man. If he was vicious, he would have constantly pushed people into the tunnel, not caring if they lost their lives or not. However, this certain Baron was different. He didn\u2019t run after money. He was satisfied with what he got and valued the people around him.Even though the miners, like Morkan, knew how dangerous the work was, and even though their dissatisfaction had built up inside due to the discrimination against the blacksmiths, they went out and worked hard each day because of their gratitude to their Baron.\u2019I found it\u2014What I can do for Dmitry.\u2019A problem in the mine. If this could be solved, then Dmitry would gain enormous profits from it.Just then,Kwang!Rumble!A crashing sound was heard from somewhere.It was a sign of disaster. It was a sound that turned Morkan pale.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 - The Miners In The Iron Mine (3)The accident had occurred in Zone E\u2019s 8th tunnel.Morkan ran to the site of the accident and hurriedly asked the crowd, shouting, \u201cWhat happened?!\u201d\u201cMr. Morkan! Tunnel 8 collapsed!\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dZone E\u2014That was a zone that was recently under development. Morkan had heard that miners would be dispatched to drill the path smoothly, but the accident happened. This wasn\u2019t an earthquake but an accident.Since this wasn\u2019t a common situation, he immediately realized the severity of the situation, and the miner who had come from the 8th tunnel said, pale, \u201cAs you know, the 8th tunnel was being developed to go further underground. It was confirmed that there was no problem with the ground or the pulley on which the huge device was hung, but then one wall suddenly collapsed and went down with the mobile device. The problem is that a miner was working right below. Fortunately, it was lunchtime, so only one person went down, but since no one found any reaction, it seems like the miner is now under dirt and the collapse.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026!\u201dThis was bad news. A collapse was quite a variable. No matter how thoroughly the ground\u2019s condition is checked beforehand, anything can happen once mining begins. Also, the reasons for collapse vary a lot. It could be that the ground was strained as the mobile device was connected, or something went wrong due to the heavy rainfall a couple days back. The sure things were that an accident had happened, and there was a miner down below whose very life might be in danger at the current moment.\u2018What do I do?\u2019It felt like he was losing his mind. The means to go underground was now broken. Thus, it would be difficult to head down to the site of the accident, and sending someone to rescue the injured could mean another shock to the ground, making another collapse possibly happen. In the end, there was just one way\u2014Make sure the collapsed place is handled first, then lower a ladder for the injured to be saved. That was the only way the guy to save the guy, ensuring no one lost their life.Nevertheless, while Morkan looked troubled, one miner said, \u201cSomeone\u2014Send someone to rescue him! The guy might die down there!\u201dIt was a tough situation. However, before Morkan could even react, Roman stepped forward and said, \u201cGuide me to the scene of the accident. I will go.\u201dHearing that, everyone, including Morkan, was stunned. Courage and recklessness were different things. And obviously, Morkan judged Roman to be reckless.\u201cAbsolutely not! You are the eldest son of the lord. If, in the process of saving the wounded, something happens to the young master, we will all be punished for letting you go. If you understand this\u2014\u201d\u201cIt will be too late by then,\u201d interrupted Roman. As the other miner had thought, the method Morkan wanted to take wasn\u2019t suitable for the wounded.\u201cThe mobile device that fell could weight around 100 Kilos. And if he is under it, the more we delay, the more there are chances of us losing him. I will not deny that the method you mentioned is the safest for everyone, but even if we send people after checking the area, it will be impossible to remove the device that fell down. Eventually, someone who can use mana will have to be called. And I can do all that right now by going down there.\u201dAura Swordsmen\u2014They were humans who lived in the realm of superhumans.As Roman said, it was a good way to save the wounded.However\u2026\u201cIt isn\u2019t like we don\u2019t know that! There is only one thing I am concerned about. Young Master Roman is an Aura Swordsman, and we know how great you are! But we must always consider the condition of the worst happening to the young master too.\u201d\u201cMorkan.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI told you\u2014Why I came to the iron mine.\u201dAs Roman said those words, Morkan\u2019s eyes fluttered and opened wide.\u201cPeople who bear the name of Dmitry have to fulfill their responsibilities too. A leader is not a position who rules over others and enjoys just comfort and indulges in self-happiness. This, too, is a duty I need to bear. One of Dmitry\u2019s people is now trapped under there, and I exist at the scene, so I need to solve it. But if I turn back and run away now, I will have no right to continue living as one of Dmitry\u2019s successors.\u201dRoman\u2014No. Baek Joong-hyuk had always been a leader in his life. Despite seeing so much bloodshed in Murim, the era of Baek Joong-hyuk was known as a peaceful time. It was all the result of the values he had. As he was always on the battlefield with his subordinates, Baek Joong-hyuk received their loyalty and never pushed his role onto them.If needed, he went out directly by himself. He took on responsibility and danger too. That was his role as the Heavenly Demon. And having reigned as the supreme, Roman knew how to act in the face of danger.\u2018If I run away now, the people below me will lose their trust. In order for people to give their everything under the name of Heavenly Demon, under the name of Dmitry, I have to show them that I deserve that kind of loyalty.\u2019The wounded guy down there was someone whose name he didn\u2019t even know. Taking the risk to save him wasn\u2019t rational, but Roman thought of the bigger picture. If he rescued a wounded person, the people\u2019s attitude would change. The miners would turn in favor of Roman and help him in his future plans. And that was why he had to show his performance here. It was a golden chance to earn the trust of the general public by accomplishing his role as a leader. And as the cause and ideal were aligned, there was no reason to not go down.\u201cYoung master\u2026\u201dMorkan was speechless. He didn\u2019t know what was happening inside Roman\u2019s brain, but hearing him speak about his duty as Dmitry\u2019s successor, Morkan\u2019s heart was touched by the decision of the guy who had decided to risk his life.Roman Dmitry\u2014He was the real deal. Thinking he had rejected him earlier, Morkan almost went mad by his resentment toward himself.\u201c\u2026Be careful. Be sure to stay safe.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201dThere was no time to delay. Thus, Roman left Morkan behind and quickly moved to the place where the accident happened. He went down the passage leading to Tunnel 8.Any normal person would need a ladder to head down, but Roman didn\u2019t need it.Tak.Roman showed his movements as swift as a beast by using the Dodging Technique. He was like a cat heading down just by using his paws on the surrounding walls, and within a few seconds, he was able able to instantly land on the ground.However, it was difficult to secure visibility due to the dust and darkness in the surroundings. Due to the mobile device that crashed, the torches seemed to be broken as well, but it wasn\u2019t a problem for Roman.Flame.He focused mana on his eyes. Even if it wasn\u2019t as bright as daylight, Roman could now see what was around.\u2018The wounded\u2026\u2019He looked around. The entire place looked like a mess. Most of the tunnels were hard to see as they were, but with huge rocks collapsing in front, large stones piled up ahead. Had there been anyone below those rocks or the device, they would die instantly. Fortunately, Roman couldn\u2019t see anything like that.When he looked around the mobile device, he noticed a young man lying on the floor. He was unconscious. And when he measured his pulse, Roman confirmed the guy was alive.\u2018You have wonderful luck.\u2019A device had fallen down but had not touched him at all. Also, he was only hit near the head by some stones around him, so even though he had a bleeding head, a broken leg, and wounded arms, his life wasn\u2019t seriously affected.The fate of a human is so interesting. Even though this man experienced the catastrophe of things falling down on him, he has wounds that can be healed.\u2018You aren\u2019t destined to die.\u2019Clench.He held the man.And then,Tak.Tak.Roman went straight up the hole he came down.\u201cOhhhh!\u201d\u201cWoahhhh!\u201d\u201cYoung master saved the man!!\u201dWhen he came out, Roman noticed a large crowd gathered near him.They must have heard that Roman had gone to rescue the wounded himself. So they all came to see it, and then they noticed Roman had managed to successfully get the wounded out. It was an unbelievable sight. It would have taken them a lot of time to go down and come back up, but Roman had gone down and carried the guy back before the people could even manage their thoughts.Tak.Roman laid the wounded down on the ground. People were cheering but now wasn\u2019t the time for it. Roman checked the wounded\u2019s condition and ordered the miner next to him.\u201cBring something that can be used as a splint.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cHurry!\u201dThe miner who was startled at Roman\u2019s shout rushed out right away.Carefully checking the broken arms and the broken leg that needed immediate support, Roman infused mana into his body. After suppressing the bleeding, he aligned the broken bones by touching them directly with his hand.Crack! Tuk!It was a terrifying sound. People turned their heads away, hearing a sound they couldn\u2019t handle, but Roman continued to do it.Morkan couldn\u2019t help but be surprised seeing that scene.\u2018He\u2019s so skilled.\u2019The act of treating an inured wasn\u2019t easy. In particular, Roman wasn\u2019t healing him or anything, but he aligned the bones with his hands. It was impossible to do that without self-confidence and excessive control.Roman\u2019s appearance was different. He continuously initiated a series of twists and turns to save the arms of the wounded. Actually, Roman was used to doing this. In the world of survival of the fittest, something like this was easy. Injuries were everyday things. And in order to survive, Baek Joong-hyuk himself had to fix his own broken bones and even save a lot of his subordinates.However, he didn\u2019t learn medicine. The experience accumulated was what led him to learn to handle injuries on the battlefield when there was an emergency. And injuries like that of the wounded man in front of him were nothing major.In his previous life, Baek Joong-hyuk once even had to put his intestines back into his stomach and suture it. Naturally, he had no choice but to be skilled at this, and seeing the scene, all the surrounding people cheered. After putting on the splint brought by the miner, Roman fixed him as well as he could. Then, he looked at Morkan and said, \u201cTake the injured to the physician right now. What I did was simply first aid; a professional is needed to fully treat him. Also, if there is a need for a potion for the healing, then tell them I will pay for it. I want him to be treated perfectly.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAs Morkan blinked, the other workers ran, picked up the wounded person, quickly put him on a stretcher, and went out. Everything happened so fast. Yet, Morkan\u2019s heart continued to pound loudly at the fact that within a few moments of the accident, the young master, Roman Dmitry, rescued the wounded and treated him as well. Maybe because he experienced too many things too fast, all he could do was keep staring at Roman.Eventually, Roman got up and said to Morkan, \u201cI think what happened today is the safety issue you told me about. Even if we prepare thoroughly, we cannot help when such disasters happen. From now on, as a person who bears the name of Dmitry, I will try to solve all these difficulties you are experiencing by any means possible. It probably won\u2019t take long, either.\u201dAt this moment, Morkan understood it. He felt an emotion that couldn\u2019t be described in words. Solving the problem didn\u2019t matter to him now. Morkan had finally understood that this man in front of him had listened to the voices of the miners, and that alone was something that made him respect Roman Dmitry.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62 - The Miners In The Iron Mine (4)Baron Romero, informed of the news of the collapse, immediately called Roman, hearing his involvement in it.\u201cWere you injured?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cJust what were you thinking when going in to do such a dangerous thing? A collapse in a mine is an accident that even an Aura Swordsman wouldn\u2019t personally want to go into. Fortunately, the results were good, and you managed to survive, but because of your recklessness, I almost lost you. This is not a simple bias because you are my eldest son. Even if any other miner in the iron mine had made the same decision as you, I wouldn\u2019t have allowed them to put their life on the line and risk it for another\u2019s.\u201dBaron Romero expressed his concern and anger because he himself had worked there when he was young. And because of that, he knew how dangerous Roman\u2019s actions were.\u201cFather, I just did what I had to do.\u201d\u201cRoman!\u201d\u201cEven if time turns back, I won\u2019t change my decision. There was an accident in the iron mine, and I was right there to fix it. Do you want me to ignore the difficulties of people in the estate while being the eldest son of Dmitry, father? We can\u2019t move forward if we always only do things like saving ourselves. As someone who carries the name of Dmitry, I think I made the correct choice.\u201d\u201c\u2026Haah.\u201c\u00a0Baron Romero sighed. Even though his heart hurt at the thought of his son making such a decision, he was also a bit happy to see his son act with such pride. Although he was the lord of Dmitry, he was also a father.He asked, \u201cSo you plan to continue working in the iron mine?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat is the reason? I don\u2019t remember telling you to work in the mine, and as your father, I cannot understand why you choose to do that. I wouldn\u2019t have bothered asking if you said you\u2019d go to the forge.\u201dRegarding the mine and forge, Baron Romero spoke his mind. He did treat the miners with respect, but forge is what he had ultimately sided with. Finally, he said he wanted his son to show interest in the forge. Because he was the lord of Dmitry, he thought his son should at least learn to handle steel than just dig out ore.\u201cFather. I thought that in order to understand our estate, I must work in the iron mine. Although Dmitry is usually praised for its reputation for the smelting of the forge, in the end, it is the iron mines that made that happen. So, of course, I had no choice but to go to the mine.\u201d\u201cAnd what did you get from that?\u201d\u201cI was able to see firsthand what difficulties the people of Dmitry were going through.\u201dIt was bizarre. Truly, it was an unexpected answer. Baron Romero couldn\u2019t have thought in a hundred years that his son would try to figure out the hardships of the people by going to the mine.\u201cKeep talking.\u201d\u201cObviously, all the miners working there respect you, father. They are paid higher salaries than other estates and are even given proper rest and safety precautions. Nevertheless, mining is still risky even though the safety is managed through our current methods. In the end, it is a place where one doesn\u2019t know when the cave will collapse. And thus, accidents like today aren\u2019t that uncommon. It is a place where anything can happen.\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t as if I don\u2019t know that. However, as you said, it isn\u2019t something that we can prepare for.\u201dA natural disaster\u2014There was one reason everyone called the accident in mine a disaster.And as Baron Romero did his best for them, he didn\u2019t think there was anything else he could do now.However, Roman thought that he had to create results somehow.\u201cI must solve the problem.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWorking in the mine, Roman thought about it often. And after experiencing the accident that day, he reached a conclusion.\u201cWe must use magic artifacts. That is the only way to make sure the workers remain safe.\u201dMagic artifacts\u2014Perhaps Roman was talking about the magic devices. However, Baron Romero could only think that his son was truly out of touch with reality.\u201cThe intention to use them for safety is good. But how much do you think one magic artifact costs? This isn\u2019t a problem that can be solved with a few dozen gold coins. It costs an enormous amount for a single magic artifact and to bring enough artifacts to protect the entire tunnel\u2026 We don\u2019t have a god showering us with money, son.\u201dThat was right. The mine was a means to make money. To hire workers with the purpose of profits, they couldn\u2019t spend additional money on safety that would cost higher than their profit. This was a different matter. And if they bit on more than what they could chew, even Dmitry would collapse.Roman said, \u201cI know that. We need to install an artifact that forms an Air Shield in emergencies to prepare for a collapse, but the cost is too high, even for us. Whether it will cost a hundred or thousand gold is unknown. Moreover, the performance of the artifact isn\u2019t also permanent. If the magic loses its effectiveness, we would have to spend an enormous amount of money on replacing it too.\u201d\u201cEven though you know that\u2026 you still say we need it?\u201d\u201cYes. I will explain the reason now.\u201dWhat Roman was talking about wasn\u2019t idealism; he was being realistic now, and he next spoke about why he thought so.\u201cI heard this from a veteran in the mine. According to him, Dmitry has the best iron ores on the whole continent, but we cannot fully utilize the mines due to safety concerns. If the safety of the workers wasn\u2019t taken into consideration, we would have gotten a lot more wealth till now. However, you didn\u2019t want to do that and put the safety of the people as the priority, father. Because of that, we had to face the problem of reducing the ore production.\u201dCertainly, Baron Romero was a good lord; however, he wasn\u2019t an exceptional one. If only he was greedy, there would have been better times for Dmitry.\u201cInstalling artifacts isn\u2019t something that has to be done simply for precautions. If the safety of workers is ensured by installing them, the production of ores will rise up too. It is exactly for safety reasons that we have been limiting the number of people who went into the mines, but if we add the artifacts, we won\u2019t have to care about it. This is something that is sure to benefit us. Even if the amount is enormous, it isn\u2019t a loss considering the money we make.\u201dAnd it wasn\u2019t just that; there was one more thing. Roman continued, \u201cAnd we also need people dedicated to safety. Why not make a solid investment in it and check their safety and use some of the resulting increase in profit for the welfare of the workers? This will be a good cycle for us. Surely, you will have to spend a lot of money on this, but Dmitry will benefit too, father.\u201dA family investment\u2014That was Roman\u2019s true purpose. Roman had hidden his true intentions under the cause of the safety of the people. As Baron Romero is good, he must have known it. However, this was such a perfect argument. Thus, after contemplating for a while, Baron Romero looked at his son, proud, and asked, \u201cFine. How much do I have to invest?\u201d\u201cNow, I will go to my father and acquire a budget for safety and nominate you, Morkan, as the one in charge of handling the mine\u2019s safety completely,\u201d Roman remarked to Morkan 30 minutes ago. \u201cYou are one of those with the most knowledge about the mine because you have worked there for a long time. Therefore, I am confident that you will succeed in this.\u201dRoman\u2019s plan was indeed perfect. Just hearing that an artifact would be installed made Morkan\u2019s heart pound like crazy. However, as he knew Roman\u2019s intention was to gain an advantage for himself, he thought he would have to pay back something too.\u201c\u2026And what is it that I have to do?\u201d\u201cWhat I need you to do is quite simple. As a safety officer, you will watch people daily and ask them what happened that day. They don\u2019t have to be something huge, either. Just exchange small talk with them and remember what you saw or heard and record all the information you think is necessary. You might get a lot of information from people. People will start confiding in you about anything if the budget is used for their benefit. Additionally, those who provide helpful information may receive a portion of the funding. I need to gather information from you in order to safeguard the workers\u2019 safety rather than utilizing Dmitry\u2019s money to do so.\u201dRoman\u2019s ultimate goal from the iron mine was to gather information. The mines employed a large number of people; thus, a variety of knowledge would accumulate there. Nevertheless, that is just the start. The miners also wouldn\u2019t worry much if the information was obtained through Morkan. People will first confide in Morkan about the state of their families before talking about the intriguing tales they heard, and Morkan will report them back. It cannot be considered cheating, either.As Roman told his father, people would listen to them in exchange for benefits. That\u2019s right. Roman intended to use his father\u2019s wealth to create an information network akin to that of the Lower District Sect in Dmitry.In the world of Murim, there were two different sects that were recognized for their handling of information. They were the Beggars Union and the Lower District Sect. The two had something in common. The Beggars Union used their beggars to listen to the information people talked about. It was for one sole reason. They developed networks that allowed their people to access a variety of information, as opposed to those who kept their heads up.And Roman had chosen the iron mines for that purpose. They were Dmitry\u2019s everything, and he wanted to gather all the information through them. The workforce would be the workers there. Along with that, his father would get rich as well. His father would make more money, and the workers would work in a safer environment. It was a win-win. Honestly, it was a plan where everyone would be happy, so neither Morkan nor his father turned his offer down. Yet, Roman didn\u2019t feel satisfied.\u2018It isn\u2019t enough.\u2019Roman\u2019s concept of an information guild was not exclusive to the North-East region of Cairo. He intended to gather information from all over the continent. Although the local mines would serve as the main force, he hoped that there would also be a budget and force with which it would grow and resemble the Lower District sect.Thus, Roman had other thoughts.\u2018Morkan lacks experience in managing information. Ultimately, I require a person who can compile the pertinent information from him, connect it to what happens in the estate, and relay it to me. It must be someone who, unlike Morkan, is capable of thinking rationally\u2014A veteran who has lived through such experiences since birth. I can\u2019t create the information guild I envisioned without such a person.\u2019And there was one person who fit that description. Yes, certainly, he was the right person for the job. Thus, Roman called him.\u201cDid you call for me?\u201dIt was the B-class mercenary named Lucas, the one who had made it through the recruitment test for Roman\u2019s private soldiers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63 - The Miners In The Iron Mine (5)The events of the past several weeks could be described as the cataclysm of Lucas\u2019s life.\u2018What the hell am I doing?\u2019After the war was over, Chris summoned all of Roman\u2019s soldiers.At first, veterans like Lucas were a bit skeptical of Chris\u2019 training, but they chose to blindly trust the man who defeated the 3-Star Aura Swordsman, Janson. Neither Roman nor Chris were normal, and they were convinced that being taught by them would bring surefire results.However, that day, Lucas couldn\u2019t believe what Chris said.\u201cFrom now onward, I will teach you how to detect mana and use it. This is a gift from the liege for all of you, so make sure to train with all your heart and soul.\u201dTruly, that was an unbelievable statement. What was Mana Cultivation? It was a systematic arrangement of a unique method of handling mana. Also, it was something that could not be learned by everyone. Even if it was a low-ranked mana cultivation technique, it cost an enormous amount of gold coins, so, obviously, most didn\u2019t learn it.And didn\u2019t Chris say that such a treasure would now be told to all of them? It was absurd. Of course, someone like Lucas had no choice but to be stunned.\u2018He will obviously give us some shit technique that is easy to find. Mana cultivation is something that even a father wouldn\u2019t tell his son. If such knowledge is spread around like something common, then, obviously, the rarity of it will vanish, so he has no reason to tell us something that good. No matter how loyal a soldier might be to Roman Dmitry, the time we all have spent with him is too little for him to give up such treasure.\u2019Nevertheless, Lucas wanted it. He couldn\u2019t challenge an A-class mercenary as he had no special abilities, so he once tried to learn to use Aura by investing all the money he had earned as a mercenary. In the end, it resulted in him losing all his fortune. Still, he had no choice but to invest it while grasping straws1, even if what he would get in the end would be the least effective technique. Thus, he felt frustrated.When he realized that nothing was working out, he felt uneasy about his future life as a mercenary. And with all of his past experiences, he judged Roman would also mess with all of them with some cheap technique. Nevertheless, his thoughts couldn\u2019t have been more wrong.\u201cThe name of the technique you all will learn is Asura Cultivation.\u201dAsura\u2014The ghost of the battlefield.Lucas was stunned when he heard the name of the technique.\u2018This is insane.\u2019He somehow realized this technique was a treasure. Even though only the name was mentioned, he felt heat rush to his body, and as if his body turned absolutely sensitive, his skin tickled. It was different from what he had experienced till now.Lucas had abandoned his thoughts of being an Aura Swordsman earlier, but this gave him a new hope, and that wasn\u2019t the end of it. Asura Sword Technique\u2014A technique that, as Chris described, had 108 ways to counter the enemy and could fully utilize the Mana Cultivation.Lucas was shocked. He was certain\u2014Roman Dmitry was a much greater person than he initially thought.\u2018Just who is this Roman Dmitry? Not long ago, he took down the 4-Star Aura Swordsman, Homer, single-handedly, despite being known as the trash of the Dmitry family, and now he is giving out techniques to mere soldiers. Why? No, I cannot help but feel confused about what his intentions are. If I had such a technique, I would never even utter a word about it, even to my blood relatives.\u2019He was incredibly astonished. The situation in front of him was totally unexpected.All of Roman\u2019s soldiers, including Lucas, were excited about this. Everyone was enthusiastic to the point of staying up all night to practice the sword technique going forward because they knew how fantastic any mana cultivation technique was.Indeed, it was a life-changing moment for them. If they somehow managed to actually awaken Aura through his, a new life they never imagined would unfold in front of them.The last few days, they were quite happy. The best event of their life yet happened and even training wholeheartedly daily made them happy.In such a situation, when Lucas heard Roman\u2019s suggestion for him to become the leader of the information guild, he didn\u2019t even think much before he replied, \u201cI am sorry, but I want to stay with my liege.\u201dThe order to leave and make an information guild was something he could never accept.While envisioning the information guild, Roman pondered over the right person to manage it.Chris\u2014He was the key to power. Moreover, as he wasn\u2019t talented enough to control the information guild, Chris was out of the question.Kevin\u2014Considering that he was from the bottom level of society and had a unique passion, Kevin was quite a good fit for the future of the information guild. However, in the end, Roman couldn\u2019t make up his mind to set Kevin in charge of the information guild. Kevin was growing as a perfect power as his subordinate, and pushing him to become the head of the information guild would need years of experience, something Kevin didn\u2019t have now. Kevin was still a boy, and as he was quite inexperienced, he wasn\u2019t fully suitable to be the leader of the information guild. After much deliberation, Roman inevitably decided on Lucas.\u2018Lucas is a veteran merchant. Having lived with mercenaries, he has a large network and demonstrated quite a decent improvement during the test. He also has an amazing ability to respond to variables. Above all, Lucas is a person who is capable of making rational decisions. Someone like Lucas, in my opinion, should be in charge of the information guild.\u2019As Roman judged him to be the right person for the job, he offered it to Lucas\u2014Arrange all of the information that Morkan discovers, and then select the most important pieces of information to report to him.However, Lucas rejected it in an instant.\u201cIf I take on the position of the leader of the information guild, I will have to leave the side of my liege. In order to find out all the information on the continent, I will inevitably have to move from place to place until a proper system is built. Thus, I cannot do it. I want to stay by your side. I was truly moved when I saw you slaughter the people of Barco. I thought that it was worthy to give up my life for someone like you, so please don\u2019t send me to another place, my liege.\u201dIt was a desperate request. Lucas explained why he had rejected it.Nevertheless, Roman smiled inside while thinking,\u00a0\u2018He is good at lying.\u2019\u00a0He already knew what was going on in Lucas\u2019 mind. Loyalty? There was none of such nonsense. Lucas was so obsessed with the Asura Cultivation and Sword Technique that he didn\u2019t want to even consider taking over that position.Aura was every swordsman\u2019s dream. And Lucas knew that in order to achieve it, he would have to stay by the side of Roman. That was why he had rejected his offer instantly.\u201cI will ask you one thing, Lucas. Why do you think the Asura Cultivation and Sword Technique are being taught to you?\u201d\u201cI do not know.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know yet why such a treasure was being taught to all of his soldiers, so he kept silent to hear the truth from Roman himself.\u201cThat is simply a present for your loyalty. And not many people in the world give such things as gifts. Lucas, what do you think of me? Do you think a man named Roman Dmitry would give out all his treasures to his soldiers in the name of their loyalty?\u201d\u201cYou mean\u2026\u201dLucas understood what Roman meant right away.Roman was saying that the Asura Cultivation and Sword Technique, a great treasure to them, was almost nothing major to Roman.\u201cI do not expect any unreasonable loyalty from you. The cultivation and sword technique are just gifts I have given to those who followed me into the battlefield and risked their lives. So what do you think I would give to someone worth more than a soldier?\u201dRoman had taught Chris the Lightning Sword Technique. On the other hand, he taught the Ghost Illusion Demonic Martial Arts to Kevin. And now, Roman further shared his knowledge with his soldiers. The resulting variables didn\u2019t concern him. In fact, those who had experienced the Great Sea didn\u2019t care about such things. Those who liked the reward or were in awe of Roman wouldn\u2019t leave his side for numerous reasons. Now they were in a pit from which they couldn\u2019t escape. They were too scared of having Roman, the man who possessed the power to change everything he wanted to, as an enemy to them.Such was the person known as Baek Joong-hyuk, and now as Roman Dmitry.Roman\u2019s words were too shocking for Lucas, whose life had significantly changed even though Roman had shared only a little bit of his knowledge.At that moment, Lucas instantly understood how he needed to respond.\u201cAccording to my liege\u2019s command, I will create the best intelligence guild to ever exist on the entire Salamander Continent.\u201dHe was convinced. Lucas was ready to do anything if Roman gave him something even greater than the Asura Cultivation and Sword Technique.After the reasonable deal was made, things were pretty much cleared up. Now it was only a matter of time to prove the efficiency of Roman\u2019s work of safety in the mine, and with the budget that came in, Roman\u2019s information guild would, slowly but surely, form an enormous information network. Just like the Lower District Sect of Murim, Roman would create a network of tens of thousands of people. Although weak in the initial stages, Roman believed that the method he had chosen would turn out right in the end.Roman headed to the mine the next day. He didn\u2019t stop just because he got what he wanted from there. He determined that it was necessary to observe future developments by himself and planned to continue working there for another week.However, as soon as Roman came into their vision, all the workers expressed themselves fiercely.\u201cYoung Master Roman!\u201d\u201cYoung master!\u201d\u201cThank you so much!\u201dNumerous people rushed in to greet him. They all seemed to have heard the news that not only did Roman save the wounded, but he also managed to bring in the safety equipment consisting of magic artifacts by personally talking with Baron Romero. Even though it all happened in just one day, everyone in Dmitry knew about it.In the crowd, even those who didn\u2019t like Roman initially could now be seen praising him, and among them was also the father of the man who was wounded previously, whom Roman had saved.\u201cYoung master. Thanks to you, my son was saved. He is my only child. I don\u2019t know how to repay this gratitude. Thank you very much. If the young master needs me in the future, please tell me so I can somehow pay back the kindness I have received from you.\u201dHe was an ordinary man. His face was tanned, and his eyes were wrinkled. He was just one of the many people living in Dmitry. Nevertheless, a person who had nothing to do with Roman was now greeting and thanking him.Roman looked at him and smiled without saying anything. He was once the Heavenly Demon\u2014A demon who had dyed the entirety of Murim crimson red with the blood of his enemies. However, still, he was human. He had to reign to survive, and thus, he accepted the fate of being the son of Heavenly Demon and accomplished the incredible achievement of subjugating the entire Murim. Obviously, it was also thanks to the people who followed him and supported him all the time.Ignoring those who calculated their profits before meeting him, Baek Joong-hyuk realized his decision wasn\u2019t wrong when people with pure faces, like in the current moment, thanked him.\u201cThank you.\u201d Now somehow, he wanted to say that.From that day onward, Dmitry\u2019s people\u2019s attention turned to Roman.Naturally, such a situation put Baron Romero into serious trouble.Grasp straws: to be willing to try anything to improve a difficult or unsatisfactory situation, even if it has little chance of success.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64 - Baron Romero\u2019s Troubles (1)Time passed quickly. Now, it had been a month since the war with Barco ended.At the Dmitry family\u2019s regular meeting, the family\u2019s vassals reported all that had happened in the last month.\u201cWith the fall of the Barco family, there is no longer a power that can rival us. Due to the absence of a rival, the pro-Barco forces expressed their desire to form an alliance with Dmitry in the coming days, and some of them are willing to pay a fair price for it as well. And as the Lord had commanded last time, they had refused to even talk with Barco and showed them excessive hostility while they were still alive. How do we deal with the situation? Dmitry will now establish itself as the dominant force in the North-East region of Cairo, but if we push any side into the corner too much, there\u2019s always the chance of them growing into a second Barco.\u201dThe fall of Barco was truly shocking.Although the power of the family wasn\u2019t much, Dmitry, who hadn\u2019t even participated in the war, benefited from it the most.As the vassal had said, all the families in the North-East were now attached to Dmitry. In particular, the ones who sided with Barco in the past now visited Dmitry daily to pay for their sins, but obviously, Dmitry\u2019s people knew the truth\u2014If another force like Barco emerged, they would betray Dmitry without a second thought.Baron Romero said, \u201cEven if new hostile forces emerge, we do not have to embrace everything. It is arrogance, not tolerance, to join hands with those who inflicted unforgettable wounds on us. We will not cooperate with them. We will clearly show them what it means to turn our backs on them.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cThen, start the next agenda.\u201dThe second agenda was about an increase in troops. Dmitry had the best military power in the North-East region of Cairo, but the last incident raised their awareness.\u201cBarco showed the power of creating variables in war by borrowing external forces. What if Dmitry had a fight with Barco? Variables like Flare and Homer would obviously pose a huge threat to us. Therefore, I would like to suggest expanding the army and securing enough magic weapons to prepare for those variables. Dmitry can no longer be regarded as a frontier family. We require a lot of strength to maintain our position firmly because we have grown to be the strongest force in the North-East region.\u201dThere is no such thing as a more secure safeguard other than the military\u2019s power.Baron Romero\u2019s thoughts were no different, and he decided to invest a significant amount of money into the military.Furthermore, there was good news as well.\u201cYoung Master Roman was correct. It took an astronomical amount to install the magical artifacts throughout the tunnel, but in a short period of time, the iron mine\u2019s production increased by 30%. We have not expanded our workforce on a large scale yet, so considering the current rate of growth, it is likely that there will be more than a 100% increase in the production from the mine.\u201d\u201cAnd what about the finance of the artifacts?\u201d\u201cThere is no problem. The current surge in the production alone is enough to cover that amount.\u201dRoman was right. It was a virtuous cycle of investment. By investing first, the problem of safety in the iron mine was solved, and the workers were now equipped with an environment where they could concentrate on their work properly. It was an incredible decision.Looking at the results alone, the Baron even wondered why he hadn\u2019t thought of this himself. Although, in fact, it wasn\u2019t easy to invest a vast amount of money and anticipate such results as those before him now. Nevertheless, Roman had turned it into a reality. Even though no one asked him to, he worked in the iron mine. He experienced firsthand what problems might arise in the future and devised the most ideal way to solve the problem with his wise judgment. From the process to the result, truly, it was perfect.Roman\u2019s reputation, which was changing all over the place quickly, ended with this.Eventually, a vassal asked, \u201cLord. What are the plans for the succession of Dmitry in the future?\u201dThe succession problem\u2014That statement changed everything.People thought that the Dmitry family hadn\u2019t chosen a successor yet. Nevertheless, that wasn\u2019t true. Although it was yet to be officially announced, numerous discussions were already held internally.The vassal continued, \u201cThree years ago, we selected Young Master Rodwell as our next Lord. Back then, Young Master Roman\u2019s actions did not suit the position of the Lord, and the youngest master was also judged unable to take on the heavy duty due to his weak personality. However, now, things are quite different. Just look at the recent actions of Young Master Roman. He defeated Homer, a ranker, in the war against Barco, and he even solved the safety problem of the iron mine in the most ideal way. Roman Young, who previously lacked the necessary skills, is now acting with the dignity of a leader. Young Master Roman, who didn\u2019t have the qualification in the past, is showing the dignity of a leader now.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWe all have the same opinion.\u201dEveryone nodded. Seriously, Roman\u2019s recent actions were too shocking.They couldn\u2019t understand how Roman Dmitry, who hadn\u2019t wielded a sword since his childhood, had grown into someone who was not any mere swordsman but an Aura Swordsman. Nevertheless, one thing was for sure\u2014he was developing at an astounding speed. In addition to him being quite powerful, he also had the ability to solve Dmitry\u2019s problems. Thus, the hearts of the vassals were shaken.Rodwell Dmitry was also known as a genius since his childhood, but Roman\u2019s actions had shown everyone clearly that he was far beyond even the beings known as geniuses.Also\u2026\u201cThe selection of a successor has not yet been officially confirmed. In order to prevent confusion within the family, Young Master Rodwell was selected in advance, but as Young Master Roman is proving his worth now, I think a fair competition is needed.\u201dHearing that, Dmitry went quiet. There was a ripple in his thoughts. Baron Romero couldn\u2019t make any hasty decision in a situation where the succession structure could be messed up.\u2018Roman and Rodwell.\u2019They were his 2 sons. They both had different tendencies. While Roman, who experienced days as a commoner with Baron Romero, suddenly collapsed down due to the disparity in their status, Rodwell relentlessly tried to overcome the limits of his status.Rodwell\u2019s greed was tremendous. He showed such a strong desire to become the successor that the eldest son wasn\u2019t even considered a competitor. Thus, it was highly likely that he wouldn\u2019t come out in favor of the decision if Dmitry decided to put up a fair competition.Anyway, he was afraid of the conflict that would arise between them in the future. If Roman had been just moderately good in the past few days, the previous decision of Rodwell becoming the successor would have been followed, but now, Roman had tremendously changed.In the end, Baron Romero said, \u201c\u2026There is plenty of time. For now, let\u2019s keep watching the situation and then think about what kind of decision we have to make.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dAfter the meeting of that day, Baron Romero\u2019s troubles deepened. Thus, after the meeting was finished, he called for Hans. Hans was Roman\u2019s closest confidant. As he had served Roman since the days he was called a trash and a fool, he thought Hans would be helpful in his decisions.\u201cI see you, Lord.\u201dBaron Romero went straight to the main point.\u201cHans. What do you think of Roman Dmitry?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m asking if Roman Dmitry is suited to be the heir of the Dmitry family.\u201dThe direct question naturally brought silence along with it. Hans looked troubled initially, but then he said frankly, \u201cIf the Lord had asked me the same question even 3 months ago, I would have said \u2018No.\u2019 Even though Young Master Roman had a good heart, he had shown a path that wasn\u2019t suitable as an heir, and that is a fact known to everyone, not just me. However, the current Young Master Roman is different. It isn\u2019t just about his recent achievements, but the young master has now grown into a person worthy of being an heir.\u201d\u201cGo on.\u201d\u201cAt the time of the Blood Fang incident, Young Master Roman directly executed those who persecuted the estate of Dmitry. I still vividly remember the events of that time. He asked the wicked people who disturbed Dmitry about our laws and further went to Lawrence to annihilate them. That event was literally a blessing for the citizens of Dmitry. People stricken with usury were broken out of the cycle of evil, and finally, they saw hope come back in their lives.\u201dBaron Romero thought the first incident had a simple reason. As he had ordered him to dispose of the Blood Fang, Roman was so moved that he went and even put blood on his hands.However, from the perspective of Hans, it was quite different. He had interpreted Roman\u2019s actions distinctly.\u201cYou can tell just by looking at the recent incident at the iron mine, Lord. Young Master Roman said he was working there to understand the reality of the people of Dmitry. No one had forced him to do so. The young master even bowed his head to understand people\u2019s hearts and faced Dmitry\u2019s reality while collaborating with workers. And in the collapse that happened in the mine, he risked his own life. He did it all for the sake of the estate. As a bearer of Dmitry\u2019s surname, the young master considers it his duty to take on those risks.\u201dHearing Hans\u2019 words, Baron Romero felt as if he was hearing the tale of a legendary hero.Actually, Hans couldn\u2019t help it. As someone inside Roman\u2019s circle, it was natural for him to show gratitude and how much he valued the protection given by Roman to him.\u201cI understand. You can leave.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHans bowed his head and walked away.And\u2026Baron Romero was now even more troubled. He thought Hans\u2019 experience would be helpful to him, but the guy blindly praised Roman, which added even more confusion.\u2018Rodwell has already been confirmed to be the successor unofficially. So is it the right thing to do to bring in the competitive system right now? Roman proved his worth quickly, but Rodwell had tried to fulfill his duties as Dmitry\u2019s successor from an early age. He devoted himself to swordsmanship, tactics, politics, and whenever he had time, he learned to handle iron in the forge as well.\u2019Even now, Baron Romero wasn\u2019t sure about what choice he should make. Ignoring everything else, he thought Roman wasn\u2019t interested in the forge. He was different from Rodwell. Thus, even Baron Romero couldn\u2019t make hasty decisions.Also, the succession issue required the consent of the key figures of Dmitry. They were vassals such as the Master of the Iron Mine and the Master Blacksmith, Hendrick. Only when three such people were in agreement could Baron Romero set up the competition.Baron Romero called for a servant.\u201cGo and inform the master of the iron mine right now that I have something to ask him regarding the incident at the mine.\u201dThe second thing\u2014This time, it was his turn to listen to Jacob.And not long after,\u201cLord. The Master of the Iron Mine has arrived.\u201d\u201cBring him in.\u201dCreak.The door opened. However, there wasn\u2019t just one person who arrived. Behind Jacob, there was another man. He looked at him suspiciously and said, \u201cI heard that you wanted to hear about the incident in the iron mine, Lord. Thus, rather than me, I decided that the person who talked with the Young Master Roman the most would be more suitable.\u201dGlance.Jacob turned. And then, the man behind him stepped forward, bowed his head politely, and said, \u201cI am Morkan from the iron mine.\u201dMorkan\u2014He was one of the representative spokespersons of the iron mine.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65 - Baron Romero\u2019s Troubles (2)Morkan was a name familiar to Barom Romero. He knew Morkan was someone who had worked for a long time in the iron mines, and he even heard that he was appointed to be the safety officer there this year.Certainly, he was a person who could be trusted, and as Jacob himself brought him here, it meant he deserved to be here.Thus, Baron Romero asked calmly, \u201cI see. Were you there with Roman when the accident happened?\u201d\u201cYes, Lord.\u201d\u201cTell me in detail what happened at that time\u2014How Roman behaved when the accident happened, why he suddenly felt an interest in the safety of iron mines, and also tell me whether it is true that he came up with the solution on his own. I want to listen to the truth without any lies or exaggeration.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dMorkan bowed, and as he was someone who had experienced the man known as Roman Dmitry, similarly as Hans had, he spoke his mind.\u201cThe accident occurred about a week after Young Master Roman joined to work in the mine. A worker was injured in the collapse of the mine, and I, who was present there at that time, ordered the rescue of the worker in a safe manner, according to the manual. However, Young Master Roman had different thoughts. He decided to save the worker by himself. Instead of letting us all take the risk, and even despite all of us trying to stop him, he moved to save the worker who had fallen down. That is the truth, Lord. No one forced him to do it; no one even asked him to. It was a simple decision the young master decided before we could even process it.\u201dJust as Hans had said, all because Roman carried the name of Dmitry, he took the risk to save him.Thinking of his son, who went into the dark underground alone, Baron Romero grasped the chair\u2019s handle tightly.\u201cActually, I didn\u2019t know the reason why the young master came to the iron mine. However, after treating the wounded myself, I realized how pathetic and foolish I was as I saw the young master say that he would solve the problem of the iron mine. The young master had no ulterior motives. As the eldest son of Dmitry, he wanted to experience firsthand the hardships the people were facing. Thus, I spoke about the safety issue, and the young master went so far as to say he was responsible and would solve it.\u201dIndeed, it was thrilling for him. Just seeing him save one worker, Morkan fell in love with Roman. Thus, even though Roman had a purpose, he believed that what he was saying was for the benefit of the people of Dmitry.\u201cFrom start to finish, the way the safety issue was solved was all the young master\u2019s idea. If we are talking about what kind of person he is, I would say that he is the kind of heir of Dmitry that I would trust and follow blindly.\u201dThat was the truth. Even though his head was bowed, his unshakable voice proved that there was no lie in his words.\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dNow, Baron Romero had heard everything he wanted to hear. Thus, he sent back the men who had arrived here on his orders.\u2018Not a single one says that Roman is not suitable to be the successor of Dmitry.\u2019The people of the iron mine were now taking Roman\u2019s side.When Morkan was speaking, even the Baron felt like Roman might become someone important soon.Honestly, to the workers of the iron mine, Roman was already Dmitry\u2019s successor.Baron Romero felt troubled at the tables that had turned. Everyone wanted Roman to be the successor, but that didn\u2019t mean everything had already been decided.The Master Blacksmith\u2014The most important one\u2019s opinion was still left.A few days ago, the blacksmith was working in front of the scorching flames of the hearth like any other day.\u201cMaster.\u201d\u201cGo on.\u201d\u201cItems have arrived in the name of Young Master Roman Dmitry. Should we take them?\u201dRoman was a taboo word among the blacksmiths. Everyone tried not to say the name as much as possible, but they had to report it to Master Hendrick as items had arrived in his name. The blacksmith was nervous, but Hedrick reacted differently than he thought he would.\u201cTake them.\u201d\u201c\u2026Uh?\u201d\u201cAre you deaf? I said take them.\u201d\u201cAh\u2014Yes!\u201dThe blacksmith ran hastily. However, as there was a lot of iron, he couldn\u2019t carry it all by himself. Thus, several more blacksmiths had to go and help him. Thus, the forge was soon full of iron for weapons and armor. It wasn\u2019t an amount that could be consumed in a day or two. Considering his personal feelings for Roman, he had to reject it, but Henrick looked closely at the iron.\u201cLook at this. How long was he training?\u201dIt seemed to be for those who followed Roman. Actually, he wanted to refuse this. But recently, his feelings for Roman had changed. After hearing about the incident in the mines from Jacob, Roman seemed a little different to him. And once he thought about it, he realized it wasn\u2019t Roman\u2019s fault that they had arguments in the blacksmith\u2019s shop days ago. He showed an easygoing attitude, and from Roman\u2019s point of view, it was natural to be angry. Thus, he now felt bad.He wanted to relieve the feeling by doing what he was asked to, so he carefully inspected the items that had arrived.Nevertheless, the issue still remained on how to make Roman satisfied.Hendrick, who was checking the iron piled up in the smithy, was shocked when he saw a sword that was left out.\u201c\u2026T-this! What is this?!\u201dHe was sure that what he had just seen was a famous sword that couldn\u2019t be commonly found even on the entire continent.Hendrick was a craftsman. As someone who worked with blood and sweat in the forge for decades, he understood the value of such things at a single glance.\u201cWhere did you get this?\u201dHe looked at the sword in the light. The twinkling light glided down the blade smoothly, and the grip was gentle. The strength of the blade as he tapped it felt quite strong. Although it could be said that it was the best sword on the continent, it was difficult to find such a thing, even in Dmitry\u2019s estate.Above everything else, there was something else Hendrick admired a lot.\u2018Its reaction to mana is unusual.\u2019Ironically, it shone brightly with darkness when it was in the light. That meant that it had the ability to receive the energy in nature, mana, which proved it was different from other ironworks.A very long time ago, the standard of a great sword was just one that would simply cut something and was strong, but once Emperor Alexander opened up the possibility of humans becoming Aura Swordsman, everything changed. The basic performance of the sword was accepted as something natural, and it was only complimented as a famous sword based on how well it accepted the mana in the surroundings.Hendrick then took the sword to the flames. He knew that weapons with excellent mana responsiveness would cause huge changes even when they were just brought into the range of flames.And now,Whoosh!Fwoosh!\u201c\u2026?!\u201dThe flames engulfed the sword astoundingly. To be precise, the flames which should have been burning all around showed the tendency to burn only a specific path as if they were being dragged down by a gravitational force. Honestly, it wouldn\u2019t have been dramatic even if someone described it as the flames being wrapped around the sword.However, even without infusing mana, the effect was this good. It was clear as crystal that this was something that would fill any Aura Swordsman with ecstasy.\u2018How can such treasures be there in this world?\u2019His heart pounded quickly. Hendrick prided himself on being the best on the continent for his iron handling skills. However, doing something like increasing mana reactivity was entirely another matter.How the hell was such a thing made?Seeking to fulfill his curiosity as a craftsman, he approached the guy who had brought the weapon and asked, \u201cThis sword\u2014Whose is it?\u201dHe knew it, too, that this was Roman\u2019s request. Who else could be the master of the sword, then? Still, he had to confirm it. Thus, the blacksmith said, \u201c\u2026It belongs to Young Master Roman. After recovering all weapons and armor of the soldiers, he entrusted the sword to me. Is there some problem? If there is, I will go and return it to the young master right now.\u201d\u201cNo, there is no need.\u201dRoman\u2014That name stuck in his mind. Where could he have gotten this sword from? With Dmitry\u2019s wealth, he could have bought it for a vast sum of money. Then who made it?Observing the numerous questions in his head, Hendrick came to a conclusion.\u2018I should directly ask him about this sword.\u2019He didn\u2019t want to speak to Roman, but now, he felt greedy and wanted to bow his head first.And to meet Roman, he first had to finish his request. So, without any results, he can\u2019t go to him and ask about the sword.Hendrick yelled, \u201cCall all the blacksmiths we can afford. We must finish this work in a few days!\u201dIn the smithy, the words of Hendrick were the law. From that day, the blacksmiths didn\u2019t see the sun until the work was finished.Clang!The blacksmith poured the ironworks onto the floor. At the sight of iron shining as if it were new, Chris jumped up, genuinely surprised.\u201cIs it already finished? I thought it would take at least 2 weeks since that was the equipment of 30 people.\u201d\u201c\u2026So did I. I thought it would take 2 weeks, but Master Hendrick had something else on his mind. He brought in all the blacksmiths who could be afforded and stuck them to this work,\u201d said the blacksmith, trembling. The last few days were truly hell for them. They weren\u2019t forced to work at night as it was difficult, but they instead had to work from sunrise to sunset in the forge daily.They couldn\u2019t even enjoy their few breaks. Their master put a loaf of bread in his mouth and ran away to work, so how could those below him eat in a relaxed manner?And after working 3 days straight, they finally saw sunlight again.\u201cAsk Young Master Roman later why Master Hendrick had to rush us like that.\u201d\u201cSure,\u201d Chris said while nodding. He then glanced to the side where Roman and Hendrick were talking. Hendrick had a blank expression. He looked tired from working as well, but his eyes were burning and seeking something.\u201cRoman. Where the hell did you get this sword? Just who made this sword?\u201d Hendrick asked right away, wanting to know the answer to his question. Even though Roman was standing before him, he couldn\u2019t hide his annoyance. He quickly wanted to hear who had made the sword.Seeing that look, Roman smiled.\u2018As I thought.\u2019Roman knew Hendrick would react like this. The artisans were always the same. Whenever they saw an attractive object, they would always react just like Hendrick, no matter what their relationship was like.Then, Roman gave him the answer he had already thought about.\u201cIt isn\u2019t a sword I got from someone else. It\u2019s a sword I made.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?!\u201dHendrick\u2019s face was dyed with shock. What he had just heard was quite a shocking remark that he hadn\u2019t even dared to imagine in the past few days.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66 - Baron Romero\u2019s Troubles (3)The sword being made by Roman was something Hendrick couldn\u2019t believe. No, it was something he couldn\u2019t even imagine.\u201cDo you seriously want me to believe that, Roman? The person you are talking to right now is the Master of Dmitry\u2019s Blacksmiths. As I have also dealt with iron all my life, I can instantly know if the other person smelt it or not without even having to check things. Still, you want to make fun of me? I guess the rumors about you changing were, in the end, all lies.\u201dHis voice clearly exhibited his anger. He didn\u2019t even want to confirm the truth with Roman anymore.Long ago, Roman had visited the blacksmith as he was going to be the successor of Dmitry. Everything was a mess then, from the hammering to the learning attitude he portrayed, and it all drove Hendrick insane. From that day onward, Roman never set foot in the forge again.Even though there was a different forge for the Dmitry family, he didn\u2019t think that Roman Dmitry, who had already lost the fight to become the successor, would touch the forge again.Also, the sword in front of him was clearly extraordinary. Even ignoring how good the skill of handling iron was, in the area that dealt with mana, the skill of the craftsman who created this sword was much superior to Hendrick. Thus, it couldn\u2019t have been forged by Roman. And seeing him blatantly lying, Hendrick\u2019s anger rose even more. However, just then,\u201cMaster Hendrick,\u201d said Roman calmly, as if he understood his reaction. And looking straight into his eyes, he continued in an unshaken voice, \u201cI fully understand why the Master reacts that way. A blacksmith\u2019s skill, just as Aura, cannot be created in a mere day or two, and if I had shown my hard work in the forge, certainly, you would have believed me. Nevertheless, what I said is the truth. This sword, named Salamander after the continent, is the only sword that has been made by me.\u201d\u201cThis brat is really\u2026.! Hendrick\u2019s face glowed red. And just as he was about to hit Roman, who was making fun of him, he was stunned by Roman\u2019s following words.\u201cI will show you how I made the sword. From the perspective of the Master Blacksmith, who represents the Dmitry family, wouldn\u2019t one action convey the truth rather than a hundred words?\u201d\u201c\u2026!?\u201dA hundred words are useless when it\u2019s you\u2014That was what Roman was saying.Hendrick\u2019s face was flushed with embarrassment; however, he eventually moved toward the forge with Roman.While going to the forge, Roman said, \u201cI forged a sword for myself that I would entrust my life to whenever there was a significant battle. It was a sword that could fully utilize my abilities considering my current physical strength and matched the Aura I manifested. That was how Salamander was born. While preparing for the war with Barco, I decided that I needed a new sword, and I faced the furnace\u2019s flames and struck steel and iron countless times. At that time, the forge felt like a sanctuary. I could not stop striking it until the story between me and the iron had come to a conclusion. I think Master Hendrick knows that feeling very well.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNevertheless, the silence was the only answer he got along with a face full of dissatisfaction. Hendrick followed him along to see him work in the forge, but he didn\u2019t like how Roman was empathizing with the feelings of a blacksmith. To Hendrick, he wasn\u2019t a blacksmith. He never showed any hard work, so how could he trust him with just a single result?Nevertheless, not caring how Hendrick reacted, Roman didn\u2019t stop speaking.\u201cI need to carry out my military duty soon in the future. I, Roman Dmitry, have constantly been improving, so I recently started making a sword to replace the Salamander. What I want to now show master Hendrick is the process of making the sword. If you do not believe me even after seeing it for yourself, then even if you report to my father and impose a punishment, I will accept it.\u201dTak.After he arrived at the smithy, Roman prepared to work. Actually, there was nothing special to prepare. It was because he lived in the smithy every evening. Thus, the environment was quite natural for Roman.Shhhk.After he took his top off, he embraced the hearth.Hendrick\u2019s expression was distorted for a moment after he saw Roman\u2019s actions.\u2018He doesn\u2019t even know the basics of being a blacksmith.\u2019He wanted to turn away right now. There was no need to see anymore. It was safe to say he wasn\u2019t a blacksmith because Roman wasn\u2019t even equipped with safety equipment, and even though he was going to work with iron, he was showing such a careless attitude.However, just then, a fire broke out.And with just one action\u2014Exactly at the moment Roman struck the iron with his hammer, Hendrick\u2019s expression changed completely.Kang!It was a strong sound. The muscles in Roman\u2019s body had suddenly swelled up. And while Roman struck the iron earnestly with his hammer, Hendrick couldn\u2019t help but keep gazing at him.\u2018The way blacksmiths handle iron in this world and the way Murim\u2019s blacksmiths handle iron are quite different. This world\u2019s blacksmiths aim to handle the mana, which isn\u2019t always perfect, and invest a lot in the sword. On the other hand, Murim\u2019s blacksmiths only prioritize the smooth operation of qi. A sword that amplifies the efficiency of the qi to the maximum\u2014That is what a named sword was in Murim, and I made countless of them, which helped me while I was living in a life of hardships.\u2019The point Hendrick admired in Roman\u2019s sword was the high mana reactivity, which was a technique of Murim. Also, even in Murim, Baek Joon-hyuk was considered a master craftsman. Baek Joon-hyuk\u2019s swords were the most precious treasures of Murim, and such a person had made \u2018Salamander\u2019 in this new world.Kang!Kang!The iron was being struck constantly. The fire burned, and it turned the skin red. Nevertheless, Roman accepted the fire as it was. He considered the process of making a sword as a part of training. He thought assimilating the sword and self is how one accepts themselves.From now onward, as he told Hendrick, he would have to go into various battles, and he didn\u2019t have much time. He couldn\u2019t know what all would happen on the battlefield, but there was one thing Roman was sure of in his life.\u2018Even there, I will reign and live.\u2019There were only 3 months left now. In that time, Roman was going to put a lot of effort into making a new sword, and when the sword was complete, he would head for the battlefield on behalf of the family.Roman fell in love with his work. Forgetting the clutter around him, he focused just on his sword. It was as if he was in a state of trance. Roman was completely absorbed in the sword.Is this what it feels like to be out of breath?Looking at Roman\u2019s face, Hendrick was stunned.Kang!Kang!\u2019\u2026This cannot be.\u2019As he was the Master Blacksmith, Hendrick had an eye for recognizing the talent of others, and that is why he talked to Roman that way. However, now, seeing Roman striking the steel without a single hint of a distraction made his common sense collapse.\u2018Is this truly Roman Dmitry?\u2019He couldn\u2019t believe it despite seeing it with his own eyes.Roman, who Hendrick had seen until now, clearly did not have even the slightest bit of interest in the forge, but his current attitude of hammering the iron proved that he was a skilled craftsman. And his admiration didn\u2019t end with just that. The thing that blew away Hendrick\u2019s mind was Roman\u2019s unshakable posture even when he was facing the fire from the pit with his bare body. Even his skin was now glowing red. Obviously, it must be unbearable heat for any normal human, but Roman wasn\u2019t taking his eyes off the metal as if he had fallen in love with it.And then, he hit the iron once, then twice, and so on. He kept hitting it again and again. His muscles were trembling as if they would explode at any given moment. He was striking the hammer along with a rhyme, and the constant speed resembled a maestro who performed their music.\u201cThis is it.\u201dRoman was a craftsman. Clearly, it felt impossible to believe, but the sight in front of him proved the undeniable reality.If such a person isn\u2019t a craftsman, then who is?At first, he showed an attitude of denying Roman, but now he accepted the reality before him.\u2018With this skill level, there is no doubt Roman made that amazing sword. Everything from the attitude towards the iron and the speed at which he hits it to the sound of the hammer and iron clashing is perfect. And unlike me, he embraces the heat fully. That reminds me of Baron Romero in his heyday. After all, he is of the same bloodline. Not Rodwell Dmitry, but it seems it is Roman Dmitry who is born with the blood of a blacksmith.\u2019Gulp.Thirst arose from within him.In Roman\u2019s work, there has to be something that increases the reactivity to mana.Hendrick had changed his position to one of a spectator and was now taking in the performance. He set aside his doubts and just enjoyed seeing Roman working on the sword.Even though quite a lot of time passed and he thought of stopping, he couldn\u2019t do it. Until the sun set, Roman was immersed in his work, and Hendrick just gazed at the scene carefully.They both knew the true reason for Hendrick coming here, to find proof that Roman had indeed made that sword, had already been achieved. Now, Hendrick believed Roman\u2019s words of forging Salamander to be true as he saw him working in the smithy.Tap.The work was finally finished.Hendrick had an expression as if he had committed treason as he gazed at Roman, who was drenched in sweat.\u201c\u2026I apologize. You truly were the master of that sword.\u201dIt was a quick and straightforward apology.Hendrick was a craftsman. He had great pride because he devoted his life to being a blacksmith, and of course, he thought Roman was mocking him earlier when he talked with him as if he was a blacksmith. Nevertheless, when he realized the truth, his attitude changed. As Roman was truly a craftsman of Salamander, Hendrick had no choice but to love him no matter what their past relations were.Roman smiled. He had brought Hendrick here to clear up their bad past relationship. In order to fully settle down as one of Dmitry\u2019s heirs, he decided it was necessary to improve his relationship with Hendrick.Then, Roman said, \u201cI will give you Salamander as a present.\u201d\u201c\u2026?!\u201d\u201cAs you saw today, I am forging a new sword to suit my current physical abilities. In the past, I sold the sword made by you, Master Hendrick, and I don\u2019t know if this can compensate for that, but I would like you to take Salamander as a present.\u201dHearing Roman\u2019s words, Hendrick\u2019s hand trembled in awe. Honestly, from the first time he saw Salamander, he desired to have the sword to himself. It was a new type of sword, and he had a burning desire to analyze the Salamander and make it his own. And now Roman wants to give the sword himself?Hendrick coughed.He couldn\u2019t like this as he should have been angry with Roman, but he couldn\u2019t refuse it either.\u201c\u2026Ahem.\u00a0T-thank you.\u201dHendrick stuttered. He didn\u2019t even bother refusing it.Seeing Hendrick holding Salamander in the hands, Roman knew he wasn\u2019t all bad.The relationship between Hendrick and Roman was originally ruined by Roman himself. Although he was a child of Dmitry, he neglected the smithy and even went so far as to sell Hendrick\u2019s best piece of work yet. That was what called for the hostile attitude. However, fundamentally, Hendrick wasn\u2019t a bad person. His temper melted as soon as he confirmed that Roman was of the same kind as him. It was like that in his previous life as well.People too immersed in one field cannot stick to one mentality. And to make them allies, all one had to do was respect their territory.\u201cAnd you are welcome to come and see my work anytime you want to.\u201d\u201c\u2026If you say so.\u201dHendrick smiled. Once Roman said he could come and see him working, his face elated in happiness. He was such a simple person. And that day, their feud came to an end.Also, at the same time, the servants of Baron Romero were looking for Hendrick.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67 - Baron Romero\u2019s Troubles (4)While he was waiting for Hendrick to arrive, Baron Romero recalled his past memories.3 years ago, in the meeting to decide the successor of Dmitry, Hendrick reacted furiously to the vassals who said Roman should be given a chance as he was the eldest son.\u201cIs being the eldest son important enough to throw away the future of the family to the ground? Right, Roman is the eldest son of Dmitry. But if you go out on the streets and ask what kind of person Roman Dmitry is, everyone will tell you he is a jerk. And you want such a guy to become the successor? Is that brain there for decoration?!\u201dHe was furious and even made a remark to silence their words.\u201cMy Lord, the roots of Dmitry lie in the forge. Most of the Lord\u2019s followers either work in the mines or are blacksmiths, but what would everyone think if the successor of Dmitry could not even handle a piece of iron? There is nothing more funny than that. And it isn\u2019t like we don\u2019t have an alternative. There is Rodwell Dmitry, who has learned and done his chores at the forge from an early age. He has outstanding talent and has proven his talents even in the capital. I think that allowing Roman Dmitry to become the successor will put the future of this family at risk.\u201dHendrick spoke his words harshly.This was something everyone was careful about. However, when the discussion about removing the eldest son from the position of successor finally began due to Hendrick, the vassals supported him.And just like that, Rodwell was chosen to be the successor. Unaware of that fact, Roman continued to act like a fool and tried to convince all the vassals that they had made the correct judgment.\u2018Now, three years have passed, and Roman has changed. Even vassals who supported Hendrick back then are now telling me to consider making Roman the successor. Obviously, the public sentiment of the workers in the iron mine and the other people is no different. However, that doesn\u2019t mean I can exclude the opinion of Hendrick. As he said, Dmitry\u2019s roots lie in the forge, so it\u2019s natural for him to not support Roman, who neglected his duties.\u2019His head started aching. His son\u2019s growth was quite literally amazing. Still, it would have been easier to solve the problem of succession if he had proven his worth a bit sooner, but thinking about it now was a pain.Roman being in good form recently was a different matter. Although Roman showed tremendous growth in his swordsmanship and daily actions, what Hendrick considered important for Dmitry\u2019s successor, in the end, was whether he understood the work of a blacksmith. There was no doubt that it was the basic knowledge of the Dmitry family. If Roman became in charge of the family, he would have to manage the work of the blacksmiths, but it didn\u2019t seem like Hendrick would follow the guy who didn\u2019t know the slightest of things about forging and the smithy.Hendrick was the master of the forge and a companion of Baron Romero. Even the Baron himself could not force it if such a person objected to it.\u2018Perhaps Hendrick will be against this. Still, I must ask him since many people now like Roman. And if Hendrick still opposes it, then I must discuss the current issue again.\u2019He was sure of it. Having seen Hendrick for a long time, he knew how he would react. However\u2026\u201cOf course, I agree. If it is Young Master Roman Dmitry, I think he is qualified to be the successor of Dmitry.\u201dHendrick, to whom Baron Romero asked the question, gave a different answer than expected. Baron Romero was in disbelief. Hendrick was the master of the forge. Obviously, it would have been normal if he ran wild once the Baron asked him if Roman becoming the successor was something good.\u201c\u2026Are you being serious?\u201d\u201cWould I dare to mess around with the Lord? There was a time when I felt he was unworthy of being the successor. But now, it has changed. As demonstrated in the recent war with Barco, Roman has worked hard on important things while we didn\u2019t pay attention to him, shedding blood and sweat continuously. As a result, he grew into an Aura Swordsman and even showed an attitude to understand Dmitry enough to work in the iron mine by himself, without anyone forcing him to.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t believe it despite hearing it from Hendrick himself. Hendrick defended Roman? And as if his words were still not finished, Hendrick recalled what happened in the past.\u201cThere was an incident with Roman not long ago. Roman sent the blacksmiths a request for ironworks to equip his soldiers with, and I told him to take those that were not good because of my bad relationship with him. Do you know what Roman said to me back then? He glared at me while telling me that my act of handing over those items to soldiers was no different from murder. Actually, he was correct. It was a violation of my values as a craftsman, and that night, I carefully reflected on my actions while thinking about it a lot.\u201dAnd today, Hendrick saw the true face of Roman.Memories of the past were now glorified, and even his fight with Roman was now interpreted as a good memory in his mind.\u201cYoung Master Roman has an eye worthy of the Dmitry family. Otherwise, it is impossible to accurately determine the condition of objects with the general eye. And today, I witnessed it directly at the forge. I saw him concentrating on the work while facing the scorching heat in front of the fire\u2026\u00a0Haah\u2026\u00a0That was a look I couldn\u2019t help falling in love with.\u201dOnce upon a time, he thought of him as bad luck. Nevertheless, from the moment he received the gift from Roman, Hendrick fell in love with him.Hendrick handed Baron Romero the sword Roman gave him as a gift. At the sight of the sword shining brilliantly under the light, Baron Romero, who was flabbergasted, asked, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cThis is a sword that Young Master Roman made. As it is the Lord, I believe you can recognize it at once\u2014How great the value of this sword is. At first, I didn\u2019t believe it to be forged with the skills of Young Master Roman, but after seeing him working in the smithy today, I understood it was the truth.\u201dBaron Romero was stunned while he observed the sword before him. Undoubtedly, it could be considered a famous sword. Just like Hendrick, Baron Romero recognized the value of the sword at a single glance and couldn\u2019t even hide his shock.\u201c\u2026This is?\u201dHow can Roman make such a sword?While he was watching Roman\u2019s recent actions, Baron Romero had a slight regret in the corner of his heart. Although he was growing amazingly as a swordsman, his father regretted that Roman did not work in the forge.He thought that as he was his son, the eldest son of the Dmitry family, he should at least show interest in the forge, as Hendrick insisted strongly too.However, Hendrick now revealed the shocking truth. This wasn\u2019t simply a result of interest but proved that Roman was qualified enough to fight in the race of succession.Hendrick said, \u201cThe roots of Dmitry lie in the forge. 3 years ago, Young Master Rodwell was selected as the next heir, but now, Young Master Roman is proving his worth, so we must reconsider our decision.\u201dThe situation had now changed. Hendrick initially opposed making Roman the successor. However, now, contrary to Baron Romero\u2019s intention to persuade him, he was trying to persuade Baron Romero.\u201cIt is true.\u201dHe smiled.Hendrick\u2014The last one Baron Romero was worried about was rather an easy hurdle.In the office.Baron Romero, who sent Hendrick back, stayed in his office and reread the letter he received a year ago.[Father. This is Rodwell. Not long ago, I was promoted to S-Class in the Cairo Royal Academy. From now on, it seems that I will not just take theory classes but also move to practice and gain experience as a commander on the battlefield. I know that you want the Dmitry family to seek peace on the outskirts, but my dream is different, father. After graduating with the highest grades from Cairo Royal Academy, I will surely visit you as a proud son and show you the future of the new Dmitry.]It was Rodwell Dmitry\u2019s second letter. He was Dmitry\u2019s child. Still, unlike Baron Romero, who wanted a simple life, he was quite ambitious. And he actually produced good results. Cairo Royal Academy was the highest educational institution representing the Cairo Kingdom, and being promoted to S-Class, the highest class there, meant that Rodwell\u2019s talent was being recognized even in the best academy.At one time, receiving such a letter made his heart pound. He hoped that Rodwell would have wings that would work to strengthen the foundation he built, but recently, Roman\u2019s growth complicated this.Both Roman and Rodwell were excellent sons. Still, looking at the recent actions, Roman wasn\u2019t someone who could be considered just talented.\u2018Roman has a marvelous talent that can take Dmitry\u2019s fame to the entire continent, not just Cairo. Rodwell clearly showed he was faithful to his duty as the successor of the family, but even Rodwell, who is a genius, cannot be compared to what Roman is now. So what decision should I make for my sons?\u2019His worries were deep, and he finally made a decision. The people now wanted Roman to become the successor. The vassals of the family, the servants who followed Roman, the workers of the iron mines, and even the blacksmiths were no different. They all wanted Roman to be the successor, but that didn\u2019t mean he could just push Rodwell aside.\u2018There is still time. Once Rodwell graduates from the academy and Roman fulfills his duty in the military, the race for succession will be declared. There will be no disparity between the eldest and the second son. If either of them shows qualification to lead Dmitry, I will select and support them as the successor to the family.\u2019The worries which had been giving him a headache for quite a long time were finally gone.Then, he left the office. After a long time, it felt like he could finally get a good night\u2019s sleep next to Rihanna.Last month, what were the priests of Valhalla doing? Willas, who had to go to Dmitry, spent much time elsewhere.\u201cPriest. The results of this ranking match seem shocking. Bertov, who was Rank 99 just a year ago, won against Rank 30, Fernando. Once the ranking list of Cairo is announced this year, everyone will be shocked. Bertov is still not known, right?\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dWillas reacted bluntly to the words of the apostle.He received an official ranking match request the same day he was going to leave for Dmitry. Rank 99, Bertov, had applied for a ranked match against Fernando, who accepted it without much thought.And finally, after quite a bit of time, the match was held. The result was the defeat of Fernando, and the resulting administrative action forced Willas to waste a lot of time on it.Willas said, \u201cActually, the defeat of Fernando was foreseen. People revere Fernando as the gatekeeper of the 30th rank, but even after reaching the status of a 4-Star Aura Swordsman long ago, he never made it into the top 20 of the rankings. It seems he eventually reached his limit. Nevertheless, we wasted too much time because of the ranking match. We should have reached Dmitry by now if things went as planned.\u201d\u201cYou want to see Roman Dmitry so much?\u201d\u201cOf course I do.\u201dWhy was he being this blunt? It was because of Roman. Rumors continued to go around. Most didn\u2019t believe that Roman had defeated Homer. Nevertheless, Willas still wanted to see Roman.\u2018It is obvious that a variable occurred which helped Homer\u2019s defeat. The problem is that Roman Dmitry is the protagonist of the rumors, and isn\u2019t he a person who is called the fool of the family? Even if the rumors about the battle are exaggerations, it must mean that there has been a huge change in him that will shock everyone soon enough.\u2019Life in Cairo was quite boring for him now. As a priest of Valhalla, Willas was on a dispatch mission. Now halfway through his time, he wanted something interesting. Then he heard about Roman. Obviously, most people were enthusiastic about the battle of Bertov and Fernando, but Willas wanted to glimpse at the truth of the North-East region with his own eyes.He hurried his steps. Now, all the work he needed to do was finished. Thus, it was time to leave for Dmitry.\u201cLet\u2019s head to Dmitry. Since Homer was Rank 49 and got killed in an unofficial showdown, shouldn\u2019t we check if Roman Dmitry is even worthy of getting into the rankings?\u201dAnd after a few days, they began to see the gray walls of Dmitry.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68 - Unofficial Ranker (1)Before dark, Willas managed to reach Dmitry.He was allowed to meet with Baron Romero right away under the supervision of a guard after disclosing the reason and his identification at the checking point.\u201cI am Romero Dmitry. Are you from the temple of Valhalla?\u201d\u201cYes. My name is Willas. I am a priest of the Valhalla Temple\u2019s Cairo branch. As I stated at the checking point near the gate, I heard about the rumors of Roman Dmitry defeating Homer, who was ranked 49 in the Rankings. I have no obligation from Valhalla to check an Unofficial Ranking Match, but since it was such an unusual case, I wanted to come and check with the involved person to see whether it can be reflected in the Ranking.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s such good news. Welcome to Dmitry.\u201dBaron Romero couldn\u2019t hide his joy. It was because of the Ranking Verification for a member of the Dmitry family. A family with a Ranker, even if it was the lowest Ranker, was bound to get recognized by the whole world. And Dmitry had a short history compared to other noble families. As Baron Romero was the first of the family, they didn\u2019t have anything like the element of fame and honor except the resources in their land.But what if Roman Dmitry was accepted as a Ranker? If such a thing became a reality, then from then on, even the noble society around them would have no choice but to acknowledge the power of the Dmitry family. Moreover, it wasn\u2019t just anyone. Wasn\u2019t Roman the eldest son of the family?While Baron Romero came out to serve the guests, he sent a servant to bring Roman.However, the servant returned with a troubled expression on his face.\u201c\u2026Lord. Hans, the servant in charge of Young Master Roman, said that the young master has cut off all outside communication and is busy working within the forge. What do you want me to do? If it is important enough for the work to be halted, Hans said he would bring Young Master Roman himself.\u201d\u201cNo. It is fine.\u201dWhen he heard Roman was working in the forge, a smile bloomed on Baron Romero\u2019s face. After talking to Hendrick, he found out that Roman had the skills and interest to be a blacksmith. It was such a joy to him. It was good enough to prove that the family\u2019s eldest son was entitled to inherit it. Thus, Baron Romero didn\u2019t want to call Roman while he was in the middle of performing his duties, even if it was a visit from the Valhalla temple, which would significantly raise the status of the family.Baron Romero said, \u201cPriest. I am sorry, but it is late today, so how about taking some rest and meeting with Roman tomorrow? As soon as Roman finishes his work, I will let him know that the priest wants to meet him.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dToday or tomorrow wasn\u2019t much of a problem.Baron Romero smiled at Willas, who nodded his head.\u201cSince things have turned out like this, why not take a look around Dmitry? I will give you a guide, so you can freely take a look around the mansion. It will be a good way to pass the time.\u201dMost don\u2019t have much to do when they visit others, so Willas didn\u2019t turn down the offer. He was then guided around by Hans. It was so that he could take him to Roman when the time came. And in the meantime, Hans explained about Dmitry.\u201cThe Dmitry family has the largest iron mine in the Cairo Kingdom and even produces the highest quality iron. If you look around, you can see that the fortress is built of iron and is pretty sturdy. The same goes for the gates as well. Because of the fortified gates and walls, this land can even be called non-penetrable.\u201dHans continued explaining the history and features of the Dmitry estate calmly. Walking down the street, he kept talking about Dmitry\u2019s unique characteristics, as well, and Willas followed him as he listened.Actually, Willas didn\u2019t want to pay him even the slightest bit of his attention. He was hearing his words from one ear and throwing them out from the other. He was just too immersed in his own thoughts.\u2018A formidable swordsman who was powerful enough to defeat Homer was born in such a frontier? I could understand if the Dmitry family was a family of knights with a long history, but it doesn\u2019t make sense for a swordsman to come out of a land that only developed in mining. Moreover, as it\u2019s the family\u2019s eldest son who got such an achievement, there is a high chance that the nobles would have manipulated or exaggerated the rumors of defeating Homer.\u2019It was quite obvious. The Ranking was an honorable position. Many individuals attempted to take credit for fake deeds, and they all shared the trait of never participating in an actual Ranking battle. An Unofficial Ranking Match based on commoners present was their only source. There was a reason why Valhalla never embraced such information.How far did he walk?When he arrived at what seemed like a training ground, he heard the passionate voices of many people.\u201cOne!\u201d\u201cOne!\u201d\u201cTwo.\u201d\u201cTwo!\u201dA group of people was training. It naturally made Willas\u2019 eyes gleam. As he was born in Valhalla Empire, he was more interested in the current scene than the history of an old-fashioned family.\u2018Ordinary soldiers?\u2019They didn\u2019t look like knights. The reason was that the members who were training were of different ages, and among them, even a person who looked like a child was there. A knight was not a position a young child could have. As the characteristics were not similar, then it meant that they were most likely conscripted.Willas asked, \u201cCan I watch their training for a moment?\u201d\u201cI will ask them.\u201dAt Willas\u2019 question, Hans ran to the man who looked like the captain.The captain glanced at Willas and nodded as if it didn\u2019t matter.\u201cIt is fine to watch from a distance.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dHe went to a shaded place and sat down. Still, even back then, Willas\u2019 feelings for watching the training were just because of curiosity.After they completed the basic training, Chris, the one in charge of the training, said, \u201cToday, we will conduct spars amongst ourselves. Match up with one another and start at the signal.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dEveryone moved in unison.Due to Lucas\u2019 departure, the number of people had decreased by one, and now, there were 30 people, including Kevin. Thus, 30 soldiers meant 15 spars at the same time. It was a familiar training for the soldiers, so they competed against their assigned opponents in order.Tak!Tuk!In the first spar, a group of people ran toward each other. The short man made the first attack, and the opponent countered it without even retreating; he then quickly aimed for vital points such as arms. In an instant, they countered several times. The two were looking at each other without even blinking their eyes. Even though the sound of wooden swords hitting was terrifying, they kept their eyes open.Kang!Kakang!Their weapons clashed so much. The attacks got more threatening with each passing second. Rather than simply attacking the visible body part, they were calmly blocking the enemy\u2019s attack and inducing the situation to attack the opponent\u2019s vital points. And what if the opponent showed a gap? Even though it was a risk, they rushed forward. Obviously, it was a battle using wooden swords, but it was still so fierce that he couldn\u2019t consider it even a bit easy.It was no different with the other pairs. All the soldiers began to spar. They fought fiercely, not showing any signs of concession, as if they were in a gladiator fight.\u201cEveryone, focus! Look straight at your opponent!\u201d Chris exclaimed.When they were first recruited by Roman, they were at a higher level than normal soldiers, but by Chris\u2019 standards, they were nothing more than clumsy people. But it was utterly different now. The physical growth they achieved due to the technique Chris taught them was enormous. And above everything else, the soldiers who learned the Asura technique began to turn aggressive.The Asura Sword Technique was a technique that provided the answers to all situations, such as when attacked overhead, when attacked to the side and when attacked on the leg. They were taught to counter by blocking or avoiding, and the Asura technique allowed them to maximize their movements.The current situation was the result of them dripping blood and sweat daily. Everyone\u2019s faces that were bruised from being hit by the wooden sword were finally restored, and they watched the opponent\u2019s movements until the end, recalling the technique they had learned. And then, they performed the right counter-attack once they saw the opportunity.Even though winning or losing wasn\u2019t important here, none of the soldiers were acting complacent as if it was okay to lose.And, among them, there was one who fought most fiercely. He was the main character among the soldiers\u2014Kevin. He was the small guy whom Willas considered a child soldier, but his fighting style was entirely different from his physique.Swoosh!With the most minute movements, he dodged all the attacks of his opponent. Kevin would first let his opponent\u2019s attack reach close to his body with bold actions and would lean back, after which he would take a step ahead or hit his opponent\u2019s vital points.Nevertheless, the speed of the wooden sword was unbelievably fast. The attack time was always short with the unique way he held the sword in his hand, and he kept simultaneously attacking him.Tak!Tak Tak!All of his attacks were blocked. Kevin\u2019s opponent was also a formidable person; like Lucas, he was a mercenary. His name was Pooky, and he had a shaved head.\u201cKevin, are you going to ignore your defense like that?\u201d Pooky asked while smiling. His head glistened in the sun. The tattoo originating from the top of his head was terrifying, but Kevin wasn\u2019t startled by it.\u201cI will see if you can say that once I win.\u201dPuak!\u201cKuak!\u201dHe struck the side of his opponent with a fist.Pooky\u2019s body looked like it could take many hits, but one hit from Kevin made his expression distorted. This is why everyone didn\u2019t like when they heard they had to fight with Kevin. Roman told him to do his best, so even in just spars, Kevin performed too seriously\u2014As if he could never allow himself to be defeated. Seeing Kevin fight as if the spar was a real battle, Pooki growled, \u201cRight, let\u2019s do it like this.\u201dFrom then onward, it turned into a serious battle rather than just a spar. Pooky daringly attacked the vital point that could even end Kevin\u2019s life, and even when he was walking on thin ice, Kevin didn\u2019t back down. He was always in a position to run toward his opponent. While maintaining the distance to attack Pooky to the end, he avoided his opponent\u2019s fierce counter-attack with minimal movements.Huk!Kevin\u2019s eyes gleamed red.Ghost Illusion Demonic Martial Arts!Cold sweat constantly dripped down Pooky\u2019s forehead due to Kevin\u2019s relentless and ruthless attacks.\u2018This brat!\u2019The one who became Roman\u2019s first soldier was Kevin. It was something that genuinely surprised people. He was a boy who didn\u2019t look much on the outside. However, he was also the one who showed the most aggressive fighting style and battle forms.Was it because they could never cross the wall known as Chirs? The soldiers, just like Pooky, wanted to defeat Kevin as fast as they could, and they then began to rapidly aim to develop themselves due to the sense of competition.Just then,Thuk!Immediately after the strike, both sides showed loopholes. For a moment, they both looked at each other. Now, it didn\u2019t matter who came first. The energy of mana arose from both of their wooden swords, and they both rushed toward each other instantly. It was clear. That energy was a 1-Star Aura.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69 - Unofficial Ranker (2)Roman had recruited 30 private soldiers due to the enlistment notice. Still, there was not a single Aura Swordsman among them.Pooky was only a C-Class mercenary, one level lower than Lucas, and he heard something incomprehensible the first day Roman taught him.\u201cYou are born boneless.\u201dEven back then, he didn\u2019t realize what Roman meant by that. And after the war, Roman\u2019s enlisted men learned the Asura technique, and Pooky, who stepped into the new world, developed quickly. His speed of learning was different from others. If a soldier beside him was someone who felt difficulty in accepting mana, Pooky was someone who naturally accepted it.Manifestation of mana\u2014While most people took years to learn and couldn\u2019t succeed at it even then, Pooky could do it in less than a month. It was such a huge thing. In the beginning, people like Lucas doubted the technique they were being taught. No matter how wealthy Dmitry was, they didn\u2019t think that Roman would give such a huge technique to ordinary soldiers. That was common sense.However, after experiencing the technique firsthand and seeing Pooky succeed, they all changed their mind.\u2018The Asura Technique our liege has given us is truly incredible.\u2019Roman\u2019s gift was a treasure that they wouldn\u2019t be able to buy even if they had billions of coins.Yes, it could be that Pooky had extraordinary talent, being the reason he succeeded in manifesting Aura. Still, as they were those who had experienced the Asura Cultivation Technique, they understood it wasn\u2019t simply because of Pooky\u2019s talent. It didn\u2019t make sense the technique didn\u2019t help him even in the slightest. Soon enough, they themselves started feeling the mana around their bodies. Thus, they were able to solve something that normal people had the most difficulty in while understanding the process of learning about Aura.Accordingly, things had changed. They all understood that if one put in the effort just like Pooky, they could become Aura Swordsman as well.Also, there was another one who had succeeded and proved himself\u2014Kevin. That improved the attitude and morale of Roman\u2019s soldiers even further.Everyone risked their lives to become strong and get over the wall blocking their growth.Naturally, that vicious atmosphere created a sense of competition, and the extreme clash between Kevin and Pooky was the result of such things.Kang!Rumble!When two people\u2019s Aura clashed, the sound was so different. When the air sucked in and exploded at one, those fighting around them turned their eyes in astonishment.\u201cTry to stop this!\u201dKwang!Pooky moved with magnificent force.Kevin was the one who had manifested Aura earlier, but Pooky still had the upper hand due to his physical build. He had a huge physique and muscles as strong as armor. His explosive attacks created a synergy with the power of Aura, and Kevin had no choice but to be pushed back due to those attacks.Nevertheless, Kevin\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. Even the slightest mistake could lead to death, but Kevin didn\u2019t run away.\u201cLook at him.\u201dAmong the soldiers, Kevin was known as \u2018Ghost.\u2019 There were various reasons for that. He had extraordinary growth, an unpredictable fighting style, a unique sword technique whose movements reminded them of a ghost, but the biggest reason was the boldness he showed while attacking his enemy, as if he had several lives left even if he died. It made their mouths dry.Although many battles had been held in the past, not once had Roman\u2019s enlisted soldiers seen Kevin take a step behind in fear.Kevin was someone who had cut off his own arm. As he clenched his teeth and endured the pain back then, the feeling of fear utterly vanished from his mind.\u2018I need to win.\u2019A defeat was not allowed. Even if it was, Kevin was still jealous of the fact that Chris was more important to Roman than Kevin himself.And if, instead of surpassing Chris, he got defeated by Pooky, it would be a huge shame for him to live with.Kevin had met his savior in a situation where his life was being trampled on, and to repay the kindness, he always lashed out at himself that he had to be stronger than he was now.Tak!Kevin countered the opponent\u2019s attack. Seeing Kevin rushing in, Pooky quickly retrieved his sword and attacked after he anticipated his opponent\u2019s actions. Pooky\u2019s counterattack was fast.If that attack hit him like this, Kevin\u2019s head would split instantly. It was literally a situation where one hit would end the battle. Still, even though his own life was at risk, Kevin didn\u2019t think of avoiding that attack and moved ahead.Swish!The sword extended from Kevin\u2019s hand and aimed right below Pooky\u2019s chin. Pooky\u2019s eyes fluttered wide, seeing the attack aimed at such a vital spot.He had to decide\u2014Will he attack Kevin and defeat him first? Or will he give up on attacking and defend Kevin\u2019s attack?If this was a real battle, Pooky would undoubtedly choose the former to win, but he didn\u2019t want to risk his life recklessly in a spar.\u201cDamn it.\u201dKang!So he blocked the attack.The unstable form shook his balance, and Kevin slammed Pooky down, knocking him down. The fight ended with that.As Pooky came to his senses and lifted his head, a cool sensation could be felt on his neck.\u201c\u2026Do you have to do this?\u201d\u201cYou try risking your life too. Then you will know that I wasn\u2019t wrong.\u201dPooky looked at Kevin with tired eyes. Seeing that, Kevin retrieved his sword and stood up. The fight was finished.Naturally, all of it was seen by Willas, who was utterly stunned now. At first, he had just decided to watch the soldiers on the outskirts fighting purely because of his mild curiosity. He wanted to check out how they trained and what level they were at. And so he watched it. The training was shocking right from the start.\u2018What am I looking at?!\u2019The soldiers who were sparring had unusual movements. Ordinary soldiers would only wield and block, but the ones he was seeing right now were quite different. As if they were veteran and seasoned swordsmen, they aimed for the vital points of their opponent with every single attack. Their movements of dodging and attacking were incredibly efficient and quick as well.Willas unknowingly clenched his fist as he continued to watch them. Admiration rose from within him. They were showing perfect sword techniques. Seeing the sword technique that systematically pushed the opponent, he doubted whether these people were truly ordinary soldiers.\u2018All the soldiers are using the same sword technique, and the perfection of sword technique is literally excellent. Moreover, the atmosphere of just sparring in training is so intense, as if they are fighting in a real battle. Is this the level a Baron\u2019s family on the outskirts of the Valhalla Empire could show? No\u2026 It is as if I am looking at a miniature version of Valhalla Empire itself.\u2019Valhalla was like this. There were war-like people who risked their lives in countless battles. Like those who fought while giving it their all, Roman\u2019s soldiers also exchanged blows without retreating even a single bit.Just then, Kevin and Pooky\u2019s fight escalated. Finally, Aura emerged from both of their swords. That was a truly shocking scene. The fact that someone who looked like a child could use Aura caught Willas\u2019 attention.\u2018No way!\u2019The two Auras were different from his common sense. They were literally insane. Usually, Aura was like an explosive force that unleashed power in an instant, but Kevin and Pooky\u2019s Aura was so weak that Willas, at first, doubted if that really was Aura. He even thought it was a joke of an Aura. He wanted to check the Auras with some magic artifact, but the moment the two Auras collided, his mouth was opened so wide as if he was inviting birds to come and build a nest there.Kang!Rumble!The wind blew intensely. Even though he was at quite a distance, he could feel how strong the clash of the two soldiers was, and he understood that the power of Aura was much stronger than it was supposed to be.This was beyond his common sense. His head began to spin. The Aura of these soldiers was too puzzling.\u2018These are definitely not just ordinary soldiers. Perhaps they are the Knights Templar which the Dmitry family has put a lot of effort into nurturing. But since when did the Dmitry family gain such power? While I researched Roman Dmitry all this time, I confirmed that Dmitry was the dominant force in the North-East region, but still, this isn\u2019t a power they should have. Even the Central Government of Cairo doesn\u2019t have such power. I heard that Dmitry is famous for its mining, so how the hell am I witnessing such things here?\u2019\u201cPriest\u2026 Is Dmitry really a mining town?\u201dHe heard the voice of the apostle. He, too, was no different from Willas. He had also researched the Dmitry family, but what he had witnessed just now was utterly different from what he had expected.Willas answered, \u201cI am also doubting what I am seeing. What is certain is that they are not ordinary soldiers. I heard there is a knighthood in Dmitry, so these must be the Dmitry Knights that belong to the family.\u201dThat was an inference that was within his common sense. He couldn\u2019t think of them as just soldiers now.However, Hans, who was listening to them, said, \u201cThey are not from the Dmitry Knights. The Dmitry Knights exist separately, and the people you see now are the soldiers who follow Young Master Roman Dmitry only. They do not belong to the family, and they have sworn allegiance only to Young Master Roman.\u201dHearing those words, Willas fell into shock once again.Valhalla was known as the Empire of Warriors. Even the place that was known to have the most powerful soldiers in the entire world didn\u2019t have soldiers who were as strong as those he had just witnessed.\u2018These are ordinary soldiers?\u2019Even passing dogs would laugh at that. Soldiers? They were pieces to be abandoned on a battlefield. Contrary to Roman\u2019s soldiers, ordinary soldiers weren\u2019t treated excellently, and nor did they possess skills strong enough to exchange blows fiercely with others. They were just people who fell down screaming after one or two hits. Even Valhalla had such soldiers. The soldiers of Valhalla had superior combat power, but they didn\u2019t show qualities like the soldiers of Roman.It turned Willas speechless.Dmitry was a fairly new state. Far from being a prestigious family in the Empire, Dmitry should barely have had any skills to nurture soldiers. However, Willas\u2019 common sense was utterly shattered by what he had just seen.After the training finished, Willas asked questions to Hans, who was guiding him back to his room.\u201cWhere did you recruit these soldiers from? Not everyone can be this talented. Was a lot of money paid to get them? Or did they become apprentices while preparing to become knights? Otherwise, it doesn\u2019t make sense for regular soldiers to use Aura.\u201dThe level of soldiers was quite high. Truthfully, Kevin and Pooky weren\u2019t weak enough to be called just soldiers. They knew how to openly manifest Aura and what kind of crazy person would use such talented people as just soldiers? If they were truly in a soldier\u2019s position, they should have quit right away while thinking they were being treated unfairly. He thought that any man with common sense would realize it. Nevertheless, Hans\u2019 next words shattered Willas\u2019 common sense, once again.\u201cI don\u2019t know why you are asking such a question, but if you are referring to Kevin and Pooky, they weren\u2019t Aura users until a while ago. Kevin came from the slums, and Young Master Roman personally picked him up. Also, Pooky was a C-Class mercenary. After seeing the announcement of Young Master Roman enlisting soldiers, he decided to swear his allegiance and become a soldier of Young Master Roman. They only got stronger after being taught by Young Master Roman. Isn\u2019t that amazing? The next successor of Dmitry has the eye to recognize the true talents in people. It\u2019s such a blessing for Dmitry.\u201dHans\u2019 voice was raised to the max. It was as if Roman Dmitry was someone he was immensely proud of.Nevertheless, Willas stopped walking at the praise. The landscape around was dim. It was truly a unique atmosphere.Before he had arrived in Dmitry, he had decided that there could be no human who could have defeated Homer in the City of Mining.However, that thought had changed utterly now.\u2018Roman Dmitry, just who the hell are you?\u2019The meeting was postponed to tomorrow. He told Baron Romero that one day\u2019s time wasn\u2019t much, but if he was being honest, he wanted to meet Roman as soon as possible.The protagonist of this story\u2014Roman Dmitry. Just who was he?The only way to confirm the truth about the things that had utterly shattered his common sense was to talk to Roman Dmitry.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 - Unofficial Ranker (3)The next day, Willas, who arrived in the waiting room first, waited for Roman with an excited face.\u2018Are we finally going to meet?\u2019Yesterday evening, Willas had a lot of trouble sleeping. It was because of the shock Roman\u2019s soldiers gave him. Just like the warriors of Valhalla, they showed a militant and combative force, and the sword technique that drove the opponent into a corner could not be classified as a low-level sword technique. As a priest of Valhalla, he was sure of it as he had seen many strong individuals.If the strength of soldiers was derived from Roman, Roman could be a man who was as strong as the rumors said.\u2018Roman Dmitry. Are you a sleeping dragon who never got the chance to shine, or are you a hero who likes to show off?\u2019The sure thing was that he would get to check it himself.Willas took a sip of tea.It wasn\u2019t the appointment time yet, so he waited calmly, and the time came as the door opened.\u201cYoung Master Roman has come.\u201dTak.He put down the teacup.His heart was pounding intensely.Finally. Who is Roman Dmitry?The moment he finally checked the man who had just arrived,\u201c\u2026Oh.\u201dUnknowingly, he let out an exclamation.The unwavering walk and his attitude of naturally looking down on Willas, along with a relaxed expression\u2014Willas, who developed an observant eye after meeting a lot of people, was convinced of one thing by looking at Roman.\u2018He\u2019s definitely a person accustomed to living his life as someone powerful.\u2019It was true.He now thought Roman Dmitry could have actually defeated Homer. He just somehow believed it.And then, he went to the main point.\u201cIs it true that you defeated Homer?\u201d\u201cIt is true.\u201dRoman\u2019s answer was blunt, as if it wasn\u2019t a big deal.Seeing Roman\u2019s reaction, Willas gulped.\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to understand the complexity of what you have done yet. Homer isn\u2019t just someone strong who was ranked 49th, but he was someone who was expected to get Rank 30 or higher soon enough because he had reached 4-Star. And you killed such a man. You, who are only 25 years old, Roman Dmitry. Do you understand what that means?\u201dActually, Homer\u2019s defeat wasn\u2019t that shocking now. What was shocking was that the one who had defeated Homer was only 25 years old. That was also what made Willas come to Dmitry.\u201cThe strong man who defeated Homer at the age of 25\u2014It is shocking that you have reached the level of 3-Star in just your 20s, but if we check and you turn out to be 4-Star, then undoubtedly, you are the greatest talent in the entire history of the Cairo Kingdom. Therefore, as the temple of Valhalla, we decided that it was necessary to determine whether that is true or not.\u201d\u201cI understand what you mean.\u201dRoman leaned back on the chair and crossed his legs.\u201cYou are going round and round about saying that what I have done is something which doesn\u2019t make sense. Say it clearly. As a priest of Valhalla has come to Dmitry, doesn\u2019t it mean you have a clear purpose?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHe had to be straightforward now. Without wasting any more time, it was time to confirm the truth. Thus, Willas said, \u201cFirstly, before confirming the truth, let me tell you about the ranking process. Ranked Matches are divided into official and unofficial ones. In Official Ranked Matches, your strength is proved by getting permission from the Valhalla Temple and defeating your opponent in front of them. Winning or losing in the Official Ranked Match will set your rank right away, and although the Ranking will be announced early next year, an ID will be given to prove that you are ranked. If you had defeated Homer in an Official Ranked Match, you would have been given an ID as proof, and it would have been announced to the world that a new 49th Ranker was born in the Cairo Kingdom.\u201dThe problem was the match between Roman and Homer was an Unofficial Ranked Match. Unlike Official Ranked Matches, Unofficial Ranked Matches\u2019 results were only spread through words from the mouths of normal people.\u201c\u2018Unofficial Battle\u2019 is a term that was created due to sudden confrontations against Rankers. If someone defeats a Ranker in an Unofficial Match, the position would be moved ahead by one level after one year due to the vacancy. An unofficial victory can never bring the winner into the Rankings. But after the confrontation is over, if it is proven that the man is strong and deserves to be ranked, then he will be placed into the Rankings that will be given after the other rankers are pushed ahead.\u201dThe conclusion was simple. Roman defeated Homer in an Unofficial Ranked Match. If what Willas said was true, it meant that he would get the 100th rank, not Homer\u2019s.\u201cActually, there is no way to prove that you are the one who defeated Homer. Since the Valhalla Temple only believes what it sees, it cannot believe the mouths of others even if hundreds witnessed it. Therefore, to check the qualification unofficially, we use an Aura Meter. It provides proof simply. If we use this meter and you pass the criteria we set for the Ranker, you will be ranked as someone worthy of the last rank in the Rankings. Still, at this time, unlike the official match, no ID will be issued. It is impossible to know when things change and when the list of Rankers is announced. Thus, the lowest rankers, that is, those around Rank 100, are bound to fall prey to others, so we give them a safety time.\u201dThe explanation ended with that.Now, it was time to check the truth with Aura Meter.Looking at Willas, who wanted an answer, Roman asked, \u201cIs there any reason one has to rank like that?\u201d\u201cWell, if I were to be ranked down as a Ranker, I would say it\u2019s worth it. For someone who is in the position of a swordsman, I would think it is worth it. It\u2019s something that helps one spread their name in the world. Even if there are no special rewards, wouldn\u2019t it be worth taking the risk for the sake of honor?\u201dGrin.Roman smiled. He remembered that even in Murim, there was a ranking system just like this. And as he saw many people risking their lives for it, Roman understood Willas. However, spreading one\u2019s name far and wide in the world and showing their abilities could not always be considered a good thing. When one showed others their abilities, the eyes that followed them would create variables.Nevertheless,\u201cI don\u2019t like having credentials verified through ways like an Aura Meter. Rather, bring me a new opponent. It doesn\u2019t matter if they are ranked higher than Homer. As you said, I will prove my qualifications by defeating the Ranker before a priest of Valhalla.\u201dRoman\u2014No, Heavenly Demon Baek Joon-hyuk was a person who had no hesitation when he spoke his mind.Still, that was a flustering answer for others.Willas had met many people in his life, but this was his first time meeting someone who was this bold.\u2018What does he think Ranked Matches are?\u2019A Ranked Match was no child\u2019s play. Often, people risked their lives to get their name on the ranking list. It was an honorable place to be in for a swordsman, and naturally, many died for it. The implicit rule of not killing the opponent during the duel was meaningless. When strong people who had equal skills fought, the battle would intensify, and the sword failed to show mercy to the opponent.Thus, people said that Rank 30 Fernando was a true gatekeeper. He never once turned down the challengers and always proved himself by accepting the fight.On the contrary, there were cowards who made names but then didn\u2019t accept a single challenge. Those sorts dropped down the Ranking as the years passed, and they never wanted to fight. Still, they cleverly fought in the last year to hold on in the Ranking.Nevertheless, even the strong ones didn\u2019t always welcome fights. They worked hard for the sake of wealth and fame, so dying in the hands of someone else because of a challenge wasn\u2019t something they could accept.Then, hearing Roman\u2019s words, Willas said, \u201cActually, as you said, initiating a new Ranked Match is the best way to prove your strength. However, a Ranked Match isn\u2019t so simple. It isn\u2019t possible to proceed with it just because you want to, and for an Official Ranked Match, the opponent\u2019s consent has to be taken, and the time has to be scheduled as well. Think about it from another perspective. Are there any strong people in the North-East region of Cairo? No. That is also why the proclamation of your name rose higher, as finding an opponent there was close to impossible.\u201d\u201cRight, such a pity.\u201dIf there was no opponent, an Official Ranked Match was obviously impossible.Finally,\u201cThere is only one way.\u201dWillas continued, \u201cTake the test through the Aura Meter; with that, Mr. Roman Dmitry will be promoted as a Ranker in the Cairo Kingdom.\u201dAura Meter\u2014Contrary to the grand name, it was a simple thing. It had the shape of a sphere and the size of a fist. Willas showed it to Roman and said, \u201cThe method of testing your Aura is simple. If you infuse mana into the Aura Meter, it will change color according to the mana. 1-Star is red, 2-Star is orange, 3-Star is yellow, and 4-Star and above is green. For reference, you, Roman, have defeated Homer, who was 4-Star, so you need to get a minimum of 3-Star, which is yellow, to take the last place in the Ranking. In that, too, it must be dark yellow. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dThere was nothing special about it. The only thing one needed to do was just infuse mana.Roman received the sphere from Willas. He hadn\u2019t seen the sphere anywhere else, and he thought it was interesting.\u2018Unlike Murim, the Salamander Continent is a world where magic has developed. Considering that there is a tool to measure even the power of someone, magic cannot be overlooked. What kind of an existence is a mage? Are the mages like the shamans of Murim or superhumans who have reached the state of god?\u2019Roman looked at the Aura Meter. He couldn\u2019t understand it, yet he also felt curious.\u2018How will the Aura Meter react if I release Aura in the way the Aura Swordsmen of this world do?\u2019The way the Aura was used was different in the two worlds. If the Aura Swordsmen of Salamander manifested a huge amount of Aura at once, the swordsmen in Murim condensed their mana into a thin layer and refined it as well. That was also the reason everyone who saw Roman\u2019s Aura was always astonished. Even when what Roman used seemed like a 1-Star Aura, its power was so astounding that his opponents were always overwhelmed and doubted if he really was using a 1-Star Aura.Aura Explosion\u2014It wasn\u2019t that Roman couldn\u2019t do it. He understood its principle, but he still didn\u2019t use it as it was too inefficient for his battles.\u2018It will be fun.\u2019For once, he judged it wouldn\u2019t be bad to follow the way of the new world.If the Aura Meter was crafted to measure the Aura Explosion, then Roman decided that he would have to do it like that as well.How can a magic device even evaluate his power?At first, he was just curious, and then, he thought this was a good chance to test it out.\u201cStart.\u201dOnce Willas said that,Grab!Roman grabbed the Aura Meter and then began to infuse his mana into it.Editor\u2019s Note: We have finally reached 70 chapters of The Heavenly Demon Can\u2019t Live a Normal Life. Although some may think this is weird, I just wanted to begin adding notes and my personal thoughts at the end of a chapter. Still, if many don\u2019t like it, I will stop writing them. Also, we crossed 100,000 total views on the novel, which made me quite glad. We finally see MC measuring his level in the latest chapter, and it seems the next chapter will be pretty interesting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71 - Unofficial Ranker (4)When Roman infused his mana, the aura meter responded immediately.Wong!It caused vibration.The once-grayish Aura Meter quickly changed colors, starting with red and progressing to orange after that. The change in color was quick and smooth. According to what was generally known, the measurement time of an Aura Meter was usually around 5 minutes, but for Roman, it didn\u2019t take that much time.The meter turned yellow soon enough. It was so swift. In just 5 seconds, the Aura Meter had already touched yellow.Willas was stunned. What he just witnessed meant Roman was clearly a 3-Star Aura Swordsman.Willas gulped as he watched the series of changes, and his heart began to pound intensely.\u2019\u20264-Star?\u2019It was shocking. Willas had used the Aura Meter many times, but never had he seen a change as fast as Roman\u2019s.A 4-Star Aura Swordsman\u2026Usually, the color of the Aura Meter changed at regular intervals. However, the changes Willas saw when Roman was using it were beyond his common sense. Naturally, he was confused.He glanced at Roman\u2019s face. Looking at the peaceful face, his eyes trembled.Nevertheless, Willas was making a big mistake.He thought Roman had drained all his mana by using all his might at once, but actually, he hadn\u2019t even started yet.When he first infused mana, he only infused a small amount to test the meter. It wasn\u2019t the Salamander Continent\u2019s way, but the Aura Meter was violently shaking just from that.This is really fun. A tool that measures the power of an Aura by color.After confirming that the Aura Meter was safe, Roman went straight to the point.\u2018Just like Mana Explosion.\u2019Aura explosion was based on gathering mana.And when Roman let out quite a bit of mana at once, the Aura Meter reacted as if it would explode at any moment.Grinnng!Rumble!A roar could be heard from the Aura Meter. The color, which dyed the Aura Meter yellow, soon changed to green, and the color which had turned green turned paler, until it couldn\u2019t get any darker.This was not a normal scene. Even Willas had no idea on how he should deal with this situation.Finally, the Aura Meter shone with darkness.And,Crack!Crack!It just crumbled.Watching the cracks on its surface, Willas only stood there, dumbfounded. He turned his gaze from the broken Aura Meter to Roman and then back to the Aura Meter.\u2018This is insane.\u2019This was a result that went beyond anything normal.What is an Aura Meter? It was a device first produced by combining knowledge by putting all the human resources known on the continent together. According to its description, certainly, the Aura Meter would never show any other color apart from those mentioned 4. And it was also said that the Aura Meter would never ever break during an Aura Evaluation. In fact, to check its durability, an Archmage and a 6-Star Aura Swordsman were brought in.And the result was that nothing out of the ordinary happened. Even when a 6-Star Aura Swordsman had infused his mana, it only shone green, and there was no abnormality with the Aura Meter. It was an item perfect for evaluating someone\u2019s level.\u2018Then how did this happen?\u2019His head was filled with complicated thoughts. He wasn\u2019t sure how to accept the results in front of him.Was it broken? No, it wasn\u2019t.Before coming to Dmitry, he had ensured that the Aura Meter had no problems by checking it. Then, there was only one possible conclusion. Just as the Aura Meter showed a violent reaction when it came in contact with Roman, the shattering also had to be a special case because of Roman.Roman asked, \u201cIs this broken?\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t. As this is an unusual result, I cannot say for certain what this is. But\u2026\u201dWillas didn\u2019t continue any further. He had seen it clearly\u2014Before the Aura Meter broke, it definitely shone green. He was certain that wasn\u2019t a lie, so Willas was sure of one thing.\u2018Roman Dmitry is a 4-Star Aura Swordsman.\u20194-Star\u2014Thinking of that, his mouth got dry. Just being 3-Star could be considered one of the greatest things for someone who was of Roman\u2019s age. This meant that the possibilities for the future of Roman were endless. He was easily a talent who could aim for 5-Star and higher, and Willas was certain that his talent would eventually be discussed all over the continent.However, a 4-Star in his 20s? This was an entirely different thing from 3-Star. If he had the talent to reach 4-Star at the age of 20, he couldn\u2019t imagine just how much Roman would grow in the future.\u2018This is a huge deal. Roman Dmitry isn\u2019t a sleeping dragon but a monster that has already taken the form of an adult. Did such a monster live within Dmitry? Actually, if this fact gets known to the outside, not just Cairo but the entire Salamander Continent will become a mess. Even the Empire will move at that fact that a talent that can reach 6-Star has emerged.\u2019Originally, he had to reveal the results once the evaluation was finished. It meant he needed to reveal to Roman that he was 4-Star, instead of just 3-Star, and that he was absolutely qualified to be in the Rankings.However, the Empire that created the Valhalla Temple in Cairo had a purpose. Thus, he couldn\u2019t tell the truth until he had confirmed everything he wanted to.Eventually, Willas said, \u201c\u2026This is the first time this has happened, so I don\u2019t think we can make a hasty decision now. I am sorry, but I will have to look into what happened and tell you the results within a few days.\u201dAs he had expected, he needed to study Roman Dmitry profoundly. Willas would now take advantage of the information guilds of the Empire. Who is Roman? Information that grasped everything from his birth to recent steps would come to him in a day.\u2018Roman Dmitry.\u2019Until the age of 25, he lived a not-so-special life. He was nothing more than an ordinary noble family\u2019s trash, and his own people thought of him to be a fool and ridiculed the son of their lord. However, his reputation changed starting from his incident with the Blood Fang. He subjugated the entire Blood Fang by himself, and then, he intervened in the war between Barco and Lawrence, and defeated Homer as well.\u201cHis life completely changed after he turned 25.\u201dThe reason was unknown.Did he obtain some special sign? Or did he train alone in a place out of sight of others? The sure thing was that Roman Dmitry had awakened. He began to live like a new person and fully revealed his talents to the world.Flip.He turned the page, and finally, Willas saw the incident with Barco. It was the shocking incident of when he visited Viscount Barco in his own estate and killed his own son in front of his eyes.Willas was terrified even though he had only read it.\u201c\u2026This guy is insane.\u201dRoman was bold. His actions were completely out of Willas\u2019 common sense. If he had left Barco alone, they would have collapsed by themselves at one point, but he went ahead and killed Barco\u2019s son personally. Others might think that it was simply cruel. However, when he saw everything Roman did and how he dealt with things, Willas felt as if Roman had planned everything out beforehand.\u2018Roman Dmitry never did anything in the dark. When subjugating the Blood Fang, he destroyed the organization in an instant by taking down their leader, and in the war against Barco, he used Lawrence\u2019s troops to distract Barco and attacked them from the rear. And to make sure that Barco could never get back up, he visited them and crushed their hopes. The audacity to take risks with his life on the line and execute his plans perfectly\u2014Roman Dmitry isn\u2019t just a monster with a 4-Star Aura but someone who knows to use his head as well.\u2019As he read about Roman\u2019s recent actions, he admired him. Although he was as warlike as the people of Valhalla, he possessed a calm judgment as well.\u2018Only one thing left. I will check the results of the Aura Meter and then make the final decision.\u2019Willas had to know the reason why the Aura Meter had suddenly broken down. He had sent the wreckage to a magic guild, and the results arrived within 2 days.The content was the following:[\u2026There is nothing wrong with the Aura Meter. The fact that it turned black and broke down can only mean that an intangible force was applied to it, which the Aura Meter couldn\u2019t handle. Also, the result of shining green was normal.]\u201cAs I thought.\u201dAs he expected, Roman was truly a 4-Star Aura Swordsman.Now, Willas acknowledged that it wasn\u2019t because it broke down that the Aura Meter showed the strange result, but Roman had actually risen to 4-Star in his 20s. It was an unbelievably great result. Even when he first visited Dimitry, he never imagined he would see such a result, but Willas had finally found the target he had been looking for a long time.Roman Dmitry\u2014He isn\u2019t a talent whose verification has to be skipped.Willas immediately contacted his home nation. The ranking system had originated from Valhalla. But why did he contact them? Did the Valhalla Empire manage the rankings of other nations as well? Most people thought it was simply Valhalla\u2019s inclination, but the hidden truth wasn\u2019t that.\u201cI will put Roman Dmitry on the list,\u201d Willas reported back home through magic communication.Valhalla wasn\u2019t just a barbarian nation that was all about fighting.They knew how to act cleverly enough that they built the status of an empire and even devised a way to use the tradition of the ranking system to bring out the talents of the other nations into their own. Actually, it became very easy to do so because most people considered the Ranking to be an honorable position.All the talented people in each nation hoped to be a Ranker, so Valhalla, even though it only had a small number of people, formed an empire and was able to identify the talented ones of other nations.Willas explained his reasons for coming and explained what he knew about Roman Dmitry. When the one on the other side of the communicator heard the way he handled things and about his 4-Star talent, he said, \u201cHe is definitely a talented person. Raise Roman Dmitry\u2019s rating to A, keep an eye on him, and find a way to sign him for us. As I said, security is the most important thing in recruiting talent from other nations. People cannot know that we are trying to snatch the talents of other nations under the name of a ranking system. We must bring Roman Dmitry to Valhalla as naturally as possible.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dA-Rank\u2014It was a great evaluation. So far, only one person in Cairo has had such a rank. Therefore, the meaning of A-Rank was the same as them showing their will to sign in Roman instantly.And Willas said, \u201cTomorrow morning at daybreak, I will go to Dmitry and inform Roman that the Aura Meter\u2019s readings were incorrect. Roman Dmitry will be announced a 3-Star instead of a 4-Star, and I think it would be good to finish the task by saying that he has taken the last place in the Rankings. And we will proceed with the preliminary work for Roman\u2019s recruitment. Just being in the Rankings at the age of 25, when he is from a small nation like Cairo, is still enough to cause an uproar.\u201dAs Willas finished his words, the communication also finished.And the next day, the entire Cairo Kingdom was shocked by Willas\u2019 announcement.As Willas expected, Roman\u2019s actions shocked people when they heard the announcement about the youngest Ranker, even though they had only heard a part of it.Editor\u2019s Thoughts: What an incredible chapter. We finally see that Roman is already above 4-Star level, and he even destroyed the Aura Meter itself. Also, we get a peek at Valhalla\u2019s goals. Excited to see who Roman will face next and when he will go beyond 6-Star as well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72 - The Gathering Interest (1)The capital of Cairo.What was the most luxurious place in Cairo? People from other nations would say it would undoubtedly be the Royal Palace, but those who had themselves experienced it said something different.\u201cThe mansion of Marquis Benedict is the most famous attraction in Cairo.\u201dBenedict\u2014He was called the living power of the Central Government, and he had built a mansion, not far from the Royal Palace, that symbolized his power. It was a place one would naturally see when they headed to the Royal Palace. It was to the extent that if one needed to go to the Royal Palace, they needed to stay away from Marquis Benedict. He was certainly the core power of the Central Government.And on that particular day, he received some news from the outskirts.\u201cIs that true?\u201dTuk.He put down the pen that was in his hand.The middle-aged man, with his gray hair handsomely pushed back, looked at the assistant.\u201cYes, from what I have learned, it seems to be true. Willas from Valhalla Temple went to Dmitry himself and confirmed that he was a 3-Star Aura Swordsman. As a result of collecting the testimonies of those at the site of the battle with Barco, Roman Dmitry indeed defeated Homer. However, some also said that Homer wasn\u2019t able to use his 4-Star Aura and was defeated because of his carelessness.\u201d\u201cHow old is Roman Dmitry?\u201d\u201c25.\u201d\u201cAt the age of just 25, he is already at the 3-Star level. What a great talent from the outskirts.\u201d3-Star in one\u2019s 20s\u2014That was unusual growth. The swordsmen who had historically shown such growth always broke through the wall known as 5-Star and became famous throughout the continent.As Marquis Benedict, he couldn\u2019t help but want to covet it. In particular, his desire for a competent swordsman was great. It was because the best swordsman in Cairo belonged to the Royal Knights of the Royal Family.Now, it didn\u2019t matter who Roman Dmitry was. If he really had the talent as the rumors said, Benedict had to take him into his household.\u201cWhat are the actions of the other forces?\u201d\u201cEveryone seems to be moving fast. In particular, the movements of both of the Empires are the most dynamic.\u201d\u201cDamn those bastards of the Empires. One talented person appears in Cairo, and they try to take them away before we can even get in contact with him.\u201dAs of now, the Cairo Kingdom was divided into four factions\u2014There was the Royal Family that followed the King, the nobles centered around the King\u2019s uncle, Marquis Benedict, and the pro-Kronos and pro-Valhalla forces, who were born in Cairo but attached to foreign powers.That was the reality of the small nation of Cairo. Even though there were forces that openly supported the Empires, Cairo had no particular way to sanction them.Then, Marquis Benedict continued, \u201cRoman Dmitry is an Aura Swordsman who can even rise to the level of 5-Star in the future. Send in someone to immediately recruit him so that no other side can take him. If we need anything in the process of recruiting him, I will give my support, so make sure to bring him over. Roman Dmitry should never get into the hands of anyone else, especially the Royal Family..\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dThe assistant bowed his head.Now, the war to recruit the talent that everyone wanted had begun. To obtain Roman, all the powers of Cairo turned toward Dmitry.At the same time, Dmitry was in a festive mood daily.\u201cRoman Dmitry has become a Ranker in the Cairo Kingdom!\u201dHe was still an Unofficial Ranker. Nevertheless, once they heard that a Ranker was born in the North-East region, everyone in the North-East region flocked to Dmitry to celebrate it.Baron Romero gladly opened up his pockets. Dmitry welcomed guests by hosting a party full of seafood and delicacies, and everyone enjoyed the festival so much that the sound of laughter didn\u2019t stop until night.Still, in such an atmosphere, there was only one person who didn\u2019t like the current situation.\u201cHaah\u2026\u201d\u00a0Viscount Lawrence sighed.He didn\u2019t want to go to this party, but he had no choice because he wanted to be friends with Dmitry. The result was this situation. It would have been great if only the achievements of Roman were spoken of, but the nobles\u2019 talks were scratching up his stomach.\u201cHahah, this is the right of the North-East. Finally, we have a Ranker!\u201d\u201c\u2026But are you fine, Viscount Lawrence? If Flora and Roman\u2019s marriage proceeded as it was, wouldn\u2019t you have had a brilliant man like Roman Dmitry as your son-in-law? Speaking of which, I would have been so sick if I had been in your position that I couldn\u2019t have come here today, Viscount Lawrence.\u201dContrary to the cautious voice, he was only mocking him.Nevertheless, even at that moment, Viscount Lawrence said with his face that was as casual as always, \u201cWhy would I be sick? Although the marriage was canceled because things didn\u2019t work, I am happy to see the Dmitry family reiving and elevating. Shouldn\u2019t there be enough families to exercise their say in the Central Government from the North-East as well? I think Dmitry can stand for all of us with this force.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cAs expected, Viscount Lawrence is a great person, hahahahaa!\u201dEveryone smiled and continued talking. On the outside, he was showing a warm atmosphere, but the truth was quite different. Viscount Lawrence, as those around him said, had a sick stomach.\u2018Roman Dmitry could have been my son-in-law.\u2019It had been just a few months. When he thought of the time of the annulment of the marriage and now, Roman\u2019s status was literally entirely opposite. Back then, he was known as Dmitry\u2019s Fool, so he thought the annulment was fine. However, now, he had become the youngest Ranker and was almost certainly the successor of Dmitry as well. Thus, whenever he heard people admiring Roman now, he felt heartbroken as the grim reality of Lawrence came into view.Initially, he thought it could be changed. However, Viscount Lawrence couldn\u2019t hide the tragic feelings within him when he saw Roman improving his value through unbelievable steps every time he heard about him.Gulp. Gulp.He drank wine like water. He wanted to forget his regret.\u2018Let\u2019s just think of it as making the right choice for Flora.\u2019He had no intention of pushing his daughter into unhappiness. Viscount Lawrence said he respected the choice of Flora and hoped she would be happy. Also, she had already left for the capital to fulfill her dreams.Nevertheless, it wasn\u2019t as if wounds healed so soon. He was still hurting. Viscount Lawrence, suffering, used Magic Communicator as soon as he came back home.\u201cSylvia?\u201dEven now, Viscount Lawrence couldn\u2019t give up on his feelings of wanting Roman.The Western Front, Cairo Kingdom.The ensuing battle left a trail of corpses and blood all around the fortifications Cairo had erected.\u201cFucking bastards of the Empire.\u201d\u201cI always chew the flesh of those Kronos bastards.\u201dWhile clearing the battlefield, the soldiers of the Cairo Kingdom were angry.The Cairo Kingdom was bordered by Kronos Empire to the East and the Hector Kingdom to the South.Although there was not much direct confrontation with the Hector Kingdom, the Kronos Empire demanded that the Cairo Kingdom become a vassal of the Empire and had even tried to attack Cairo several times near the borders over the years.Kronos Empire\u2014Like Valhalla, it was one of the two major mountain ranges of the continent, and it was also the country where Emperor Alexander1\u00a0was born.If they wanted to destroy Cairo, they could have walked in and destroyed them, but they didn\u2019t do that due to their interest in the nation. Kronos troops would cross borders from time to time. At the forefront, Cairo\u2019s soldiers would die, and insidely, the ones who followed Kronos would ask Cairo to surrender. It was the shabby reality of a small nation. In addition to that, Cairo never had a peaceful day with foreign powers targeting them.The soldiers were moving the corpses. No matter how much time passed, they couldn\u2019t get used to the situation where their colleagues were dying due to the nation being weak. They set fire to the corpses piled up like mountains in the wide plain. This was the most polite thing they could do for the dead on the frontlines, where even a proper funeral couldn\u2019t be held.\u201cRodwell, are you fine?\u201dOn the one hand, a man spoke to his colleague, who was looking at the corpses.There was a mark on his chest, and the man called Rodwell said, \u201cI am used to this now. It isn\u2019t something I have experienced for only a day or two.\u201d\u201cI never knew that the reality on the frontlines would be this bad. Even when I was sent to the training camp for actual combat, I thought that a pink2\u00a0future was waiting for me. But it seems that sometimes reality is like this. Dozens of times a day, I worry about thoughts of giving up and then going back home.\u201dGrin.Rodwell smiled. He could understand it. When he was promoted to S-Class at the Cairo Royal Academy, he and his classmates all had the same thoughts.Nevertheless, the reality was worse than that. They spent hellish time at the frontlines in the name of training camp to obtain real-world experience, and he finally got the qualifications of a commander on the Western Front.One year\u2014If they managed to gain experience for that much time and then headed back to the academy, they would be honored by others for it. However, even though not even half a year had passed, their mentality was already falling apart.His colleague said, \u201cDid you hear the news? I heard that Roman Dmitry, your brother, became a Ranker.\u201dAt that moment, Rodwell frowned. He had also heard the rumors about Roman. The title of the Youngest Ranker was such a huge achievement that even those on the frontlines knew it. Also, because of that reason, he was asked questions about Roman by his superiors.What kind of person is Roman, and what does he like?His interest in his older brother, who he was never even curious about, exploded.\u2018Roman.\u2019That brother in my memory reached 3-Star? No, it cannot be.No matter how hard he thought, Roman was nothing more than trash.\u201cIt is just bullshit. I don\u2019t know what tricks the family used, but Roman isn\u2019t someone who can even protect himself, let alone become a Ranker. Maybe he\u2019s an unofficial one? I am sure the truth will come out soon.\u201dHe turned away, not wanting to talk more. It didn\u2019t matter even if Roman was his brother. Now, to rise higher, he had to be faithful to the reality that was in front of him.Back to the protagonist of this story.Unlike the atmosphere around him, which was noisy because of his actions, Roman only devoted himself to training with a calm face.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dHe took a deep breath.His whole body was drenched in sweat due to the training he started right in the morning, and because he raised his sharp sensations to the fullest, he was even more exhausted. Even when he trained, he gave it his all. It would still take him time to reach the level of efficiency that he had in his previous life, but at least his growth was steady.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dStill, as his senses had become quite sharp and sensitive by now, he could hear other people\u2019s voices.Hans said with a face like he wasn\u2019t even surprised by such things anymore, \u201cWe have guests waiting outside.\u201d3\u201cGuests?\u201d\u201cYes. Shall I guide you?\u201dThere were no guests scheduled to come today.Roman postponed the meeting and took a shower. Then, he moved to the waiting room.\u201cNice to meet you. I am Bentner.\u201d\u201cI am Roman Dmitry.\u201dThe man smiled brightly and shook hands. It was a face Roman was seeing for the first time. Only when Roman blinked and asked everyone to leave the room did Bentner reveal his true identity.\u201cI will be straight with you. I am a servant of His Majesty, the King of Cairo. I\u2019ve come to Dmitry in order to appoint you, Roman Dmitry, as a Royal Knight of Cairo.\u201dAmong the four factions of Cairo, Bentner was a member of the Royal Family.People had finally begun to move earnestly to secure Roman Dmitry, a dragon who was sleeping within the nation of Cairo.Editor\u2019s Thoughts: Honestly, many things happened in this chapter. We got info on the ongoing war, the current Empires on the continent, Rodwell making an appearance and his thought on Roman, factions moving to recruit Roman, and Viscount Lawrence is still suffering lol. Nevertheless, this was an amazing chapter. It will be interesting to see how Roman will respond to those who will try to recruit him.Just in case anyone forgot, Alexander was the one who had founded Aura on the Salamander Continent.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fPink symbolizes youth, good health, and playfulness.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fHans has just become tired and used to Roman's extraordinary actions now lol.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 - The Gathering Interest (2)A Royal Knight\u2014As the Royal Knights served the King himself, it was the highest honor that could be granted to a knight.As it was not a position that would be offered to just anyone, Bentner added with a voice full of pride, \u201cActually, it is extremely unusual to directly give this proposal to anyone. Usually, one can only enjoy the glory of joining the Royal Knights if they pass both the personality and skills test, which is administered by the Royal Family themselves. However, I want to grant an exception to you, Mr. Roman Dmitry. If you come to the capital right now and kneel before His Majesty while swearing allegiance to him, you can join the Royal Knights without giving any test.\u201dIf he was a child who didn\u2019t know how the world worked, then Roman would have been moved by this proposal and would have accepted it without a second thought.However, as he knew quite a bit about the world, Roman\u2019s reaction was different than Bentner expected.\u201cIs that all?\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you going to refuse?\u201dBentner was embarrassed at his response.Nevertheless, Roman said with a smile, \u201cIsn\u2019t it natural to say no? I never wanted the honor of being a knight. As the eldest son of the Dmitry family, I have lived in the North-East region of Cairo without any shortage of resources and having my wishes fulfilled due to my kind parents since birth, so why do I need to go to the capital and make sacrifices to be a Royal Knight? Your suggestion was wrong from the start. You wouldn\u2019t have even made such an offer if you had known that the Dmitry family is the wealthiest in the North-East region of Cairo.\u201dHearing the unexpected answer, Bentner felt lost. What was a Royal Knight? It was a glorious position everyone wanted. He thought even the Dmitry family would be thrilled about it, but Roman\u2019s reaction was as cold as ice.He wanted to turn away in anger. However, as he knew the circumstances of the King who gave him the order, he let go of his pride.\u201c\u2026If there is anything you want, please tell me. His Majesty wishes for you to be appointed as a Royal Knight of the Royal Family. So, maybe a noble title? If you prove your loyalty as a Royal Knight, Dmitry will get a new title. A mansion will be prepared for you in the capital, and you will enjoy many things, including fame. Think carefully. The moment you say yes, you will live a completely different life from the one you have lived here.\u201dHe took a step back to recruit Roman.Bentner had now given him the best offer he could.However\u2026\u201cIs that the best the Royal Family can do?\u201dRoman was still being cynical.Bentner\u2019s expression became stiff when he heard that response of Roman. He could understand Roman rejecting the first proposal. The proposal of becoming a Royal Knight might not have been as attractive to him, who would become the successor of the Dmitry family.However, that wasn\u2019t the case for the second proposal. He was being promised wealth and honor on the condition of faithfully serving the King of Cairo, staying by his side, and making sure no one could touch him.Betner answered, \u201cYou seem to have misunderstood something. His Majesty the King wants you because he values the possibilities of the future, not the present. A Royal Knight, a new title, a mansion in the capital; those are all rewards just for that. But you still give such an answer? What a greedy person you are, so greedy that there aren\u2019t even any limits!\u201dHis patience finally exploded.Even though Roman became a 3-Star at the age of 20, there was no guarantee that he would grow into a 5-Star Aura Swordsman. On the other hand, the Royal Knights were the best armed group in the Cairo Kingdom, but Roman was still overestimating himself.The atmosphere turned cold instantly.Nevertheless, despite Bentner\u2019s angry eyes, Roman\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change in the slightest.\u201cThe one misunderstanding something is you, not me.\u201d\u201c\u2026What do you mean?!\u201d\u201cFive days ago, a member of Count Gregory\u2019s family came to see me. In return for the oath of allegiance to him, I was promised a mansion in the capital, as well as thousands of acres of land and treasures of gold and silver. And he also hoped to turn our relationship into that of blood with marriage.\u201dWhen he heard the name of Gregory, Bentner\u2019s expression flickered.\u2018Those on the side of Kronos have already moved?\u2019Gregory was not a royalist. He was an open-minded follower of Kronos, and from Bentner\u2019s perspective, he should not allow his offer to succeed.However, Roman\u2019s words didn\u2019t end just there.\u201cThree days ago, the Denver family sent someone. They said they wanted to be my supporter. Along with providing the equipment I needed to improve my swordsmanship, they proposed that we become friends rather than have a master-slave relationship. You know what? That\u2019s not all. I just met a member of the Benedict family last evening. They also made an offer that was far more radical than yours. They sought to establish close ties with family through the process of arranged marriage, and the Dmitry family was promised to become one of them within the next month. Naturally, as a basic compensation, the reward of the mansion in the capital and the gold and silver treasures were also included.\u201dDenver House was a member of the Valhalla Empire. And not to mention the Benedict family\u2014It was the center of the Noble Faction and, in fact, was the most direct threat to the Royal Family if one excluded both the Empires.\u2018The devil\u2019s magic has come here!\u2019It was flustering.Bentner felt his mind go blank.He thought he had checked everything and moved so quickly, but everyone had already made a move.Now he could understand why Roman turned down his proposal and why he didn\u2019t even blink at his suggestions. If he had been in Roman\u2019s position, then even he wouldn\u2019t have been attracted to the proposal of the Royal Family.Roman continued, \u201cThe reason I turned down your proposal is not simply because it isn\u2019t special. I didn\u2019t just reject your proposal because it wasn\u2019t particularly special. The Royal Family naively made a proposal while the three factions presented commendable ones. The Royal Family was ignorant of what was happening inside Dmitry. So allow me to ask you. Is it actually appropriate for me to decline the first three offers simply for the honor that being a Royal Knight would bring?\u201dWhen Roman said those words, Bentner\u2019s heart sank instantly. It was over. There was no way he could convince Roman now. As his incompetence despite being from the Royal Family was shown to him, he had no choice but to accept the reality before him.\u201c\u2026We were one step late.\u201dHe sighed. He looked at Roman with a face that looked like he had given up, and he said, \u201cI admit that we were incompetent. Still, what I said was the best the Royal Family can do right now. Marquis Benedict, who\u2019s being supported by other nobles, Count Gregory, who\u2019s supporting the Kronos Empire, and Denver, who\u2019s supporting Valhalla, as well, are all vicious tyrants trying to devour the entire Cairo Kingdom. They seized the kingdom\u2019s power and blocked any flow of information to not let the Royal Family know what was happening around them and are trying their hardest to exclude them from the political discussions. At least the Royal Knights are called the best armed forces, so we are trying to suppress the rebellion, but it was impossible for us to move faster than the three factions no matter how much we tried.\u201dSeeing that Roman wouldn\u2019t join them easily anyway, he decided to tell him the truth. Honestly, it seemed like all his confidence had died down, and he looked as if he would burst into tears at any moment.\u201cCairo is a small nation. In fact, even though I made that proposal to you, I cannot predict when you will be granted the title of nobility. And yet, the only reason that I have come this far is because now, only physical force can protect His Majesty. Finally, I beg you. Can you not give your strength for the sake of His Majesty the King? If, in the future, all the tyrants are defeated and the throne is firmly established, then I will never forget today\u2019s choice.\u201dTalking about the distant future\u2014It was an uncertain promise. Still, appealing to emotions was the only option he had left.\u2018It\u2019s one kingdom, and there are four factions.\u2019Roman was used to it. The Heavenly Demon Sect was a huge group that was divided into numerous factions in which many were trying to reach the apex position.Being the 12th son of the Heavenly Demon, Baek Joong-hyuk received numerous suggestions and proposals from the moment he revealed his worth. Everyone made attractive offers and wanted Baek Joong-hyuk under them.Then, what decision did he make? Did he accept the strongest and most beneficial one? Or did he show a hostile reaction to everyone?Actually, it was neither of them.He knew from his past experience that if he accepted any proposal, problems would definitely arise.Roman answered, \u201cThe previous proposals and the proposal of the Royal Family are not attractive to me. Thus, I have no intention of accepting any of them. If the day comes when I choose a faction and swear allegiance to them, it will be because I have experienced them myself and decided they were worth it. So you can head back for today and show whether those really are your intentions through your actions. If you do that, then I will personally visit the Royal Family and swear allegiance to them.\u201dRoman chose to stay neutral. He turned down all the offers.Because there was no hostile relationship between them till now, he didn\u2019t refuse directly. He left the possibility open to all four factions.\u201cAre you being serious?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dBentner\u2019s expression brightened instantly. He understood that the possibility of discussion still remained. That alone was good news. And for Bentner, who thought things had already ended, this was quite a good choice.\u201cAlright. The Cairo Royal Family will make every effort not to give up the nation\u2019s sovereignty. So we will wait. If the day comes when you swear allegiance to His Majesty the King, then we will welcome you with open arms.\u201dBentner didn\u2019t give up till the end.Even while hearing those words, Roman smiled, but he did not hold out the hand extended toward him.He had rejected all four proposals. Obviously, the reactions varied from person to person. Unlike Bentner, who was full of hope and ended the discussion with a smile, there were those who tried to pressure him with threats as well.Nevertheless, Roman stayed calm.\u2018I have no intention of swearing allegiance to any faction. If they are going to turn hostile to me, leaving them alive is only to buy some time. Until my purpose becomes clear to them, I need to build up my strength while keeping these relationships ambiguous.\u2019He left room for all factions. It was because the others would undoubtedly resent him when he chose one side. That was the problem. However, Roman didn\u2019t need to worry about that now. Even if they later found out that Roman was not someone who would swear allegiance to anyone, Roman would have completed all his preparations for war by then. Thus, it could be said that the current situation in Cairo was favorable to Roman. Even though Roman had expressed himself as such, no one would try to trample him immediately because of being conscious of the other factions.While standing on a tight-knit single rope, Roman would take over the stage.People would still try to convince him, unaware that he was a predator. Nevertheless, the sure thing was that the ripple effect of rankings was truly great. Even though he was still an Unofficial Ranker, the entire Dmitry was thrilled seeing the people who wanted him on their side.This was the reason why people wanted to become a Ranker. Wealth and honor were guaranteed to those whose names were on the Rankings. That was why people relentlessly tried to get their name on the Rankings.Was the commotion finally over? Not yet.Everyone who had come to see Roman made a suggestion based on common sense, and no one gambled just because of the future possibilities of Roman. Nevertheless, that was only until a few days later, the people of Valhalla visited Roman again.Editor\u2019s Thoughts: It seems the Royal Family\u2019s in quite a tough situation as of now. It will be exciting to see Roman\u2019s next actions for them. Also, what a cliffhanger\u2014Valhalla already knows that Roman is a 4-Star Aura Swordsman, so they might make an amazing proposal to him. Still, I doubt Roman will accept it lol.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 - The Gathering Interest (3)This was an unexpected meeting.After finishing his training, Roman caught his breath and looked at a servant other than Hans approaching.\u201cValhalla has dispatched me as their representative.\u201dClearly, the servant, who wasn\u2019t Hans, was wearing the attire of Dmitry. It didn\u2019t look like the person had worked for long, and as his face looked unfamiliar, it meant that he intentionally didn\u2019t come out till now.Even if it was a situation where anyone else would have panicked at least a little bit, Roman said, calm, \u201cWhat does Valhalla want? I remember meeting someone from Valhalla just a few days ago.\u201dThe Denver Family had come representing Valhalla not too long ago. He remembered their conditions to want Roman on their side, but he didn\u2019t think Valhalla would send someone else this fast.For a moment, the servant was shocked by Roman\u2019s reaction.Roman was a lot calmer than he thought, but it felt like cold sweat dripped down whenever he made eye contact with Roman.\u2018How can the eyes of a human\u2026\u2019He gulped. The servant in charge of this task spoke quietly after seeing that no one else was around.\u201cFirst of all, I am sorry to have met you in such a rude way. As Mr. Roman said, Valhalla did send someone through the Denver family not long ago. Still, at that time, we had no choice but to take that path as we were wary of people noticing us. Nevertheless, you can think of today\u2019s meeting as the one filled with Valhalla\u2019s sincerity.\u201dEven though he came in today, Dmitry was still taking in too much attention from the public, albeit lesser than before. He knew that if the main point was delivered through the Denver family, there was a chance of information leaking out, and if that happened, the hostile forces would turn suspicious of something happening under the wraps. Thus, Denver was sent to only have a formal meeting. It would have been a fantastic bonus if Roman had accepted those conditions, but they knew that Roman wouldn\u2019t accept it as he knew his actual growth.Immediately after the Battle of Great Warriors, Valhalla planted a servant in Dmitry. It was all done for today\u2019s meeting. When they moved to an enclosed space from the training ground, the person representing Valhalla said, \u201cI would like to greet you once again. I am McKean from the Valhalla Intelligence Guild. And I want to use this opportunity to propose that we bring Roman Dmitry to Valhalla. That is the primary goal of this proposal.\u201dThis was unexpected. Valhalla was the first to decide after the report of Willas that Roman was an A-Rank. Valhalla was preparing to sign Roman from earlier on, but the ripple effect was much greater than they thought. And in the rapidly changing situation, Willas had to contact his home nation again.\u201cI think we need to approach Roman sooner than planned. We overlooked for a moment what kind of nation Cairo is. Contrary to thinking that if we didn\u2019t disclose him being a 4-Star Aura Swordsman, there would be no fame, everyone is so desperate to get him first, even though his actual talent hasn\u2019t even been revealed yet. The Royal Family, the nobles, and even the Kronos Empire have moved. They are moving unbelievably fast to make contact with Roman Dmitry. If Roman overlooks his actual worth and accepts one of their proposals, we may end up missing out on the true treasure.\u201d[So what do you need?]\u201cPlease give me the full authority on this matter. I will bring Roman Dmitry to Valhalla.\u201d[Fine. Willas, I entrust you with the task and give you authority regarding the recruitment of Roman.]The plan was changed.The fact that Cairo\u2019s Youngest Ranker had reached 3-Star at the age of 25 was drawing too much attention. This was like Valhalla had stabbed itself. Thus, they first sent someone through Denver, grasping for straws, and then another person, away from the public\u2019s eye.McKean said, \u201cValhalla is extremely interested in the potential of Mr. Roman Dmitry. Despite the numerous proposals offered, the problem of nationality cannot be resolved so quickly. Anyone with significant riches, like you, may find it challenging to leave their family and go to Valhalla. We will therefore resolve this issue. We will grant you the title of Viscount and a fertile land for the Dmitry family the minute Mr. Roman Dmitry declares his desire to become a citizen of Valhalla. The Dmitry family will also be able to preserve its own tradition of mining and forging because the land we have prepared is one surrounded by iron mines.\u201dThe proposal involving the Dmitry family was quite groundbreaking. The title of Valhalla was that of an empire and not just a kingdom. That meant their power would be incomparable compared to what they have now, and that alone was enough to crush the previous proposals.Also,\u201cValhalla is ready to offer people if you need people, and sacrifices, if you need sacrifices. Nevertheless, the most important thing Valhalla values is the strength of an Aura Swordsman. Thus, we also want Mr. Roman Dmitry to become a stronger swordsman. Even for that, we will make an exception and allow you to enter the First-Rank treasury whenever you want to. I think you also realize what the treasury of Valhalla means. If you come in contact with the knowledge of our ancestors accumulated there, your talent will be able to soar with wings in the sky.\u201dIt was literally a groundbreaking proposal. Valhalla had things like sword and cultivation techniques, and even journals of their ancestors in that treasury. They were all graded according to the level of content, and the highest rank among them was the 1st rank. Thus, it was a place with treasures that most couldn\u2019t even glance at throughout their entire lives.This proposal truly proved that Valhalla recognized Roman\u2019s value as a swordsman and was ready to welcome him with wide arms as well. They had revealed their intentions completely. Obviously, no ordinary human would refuse this proposal.\u201cAlso, Valhalla will soon conquer the entire Salamander Continent and stand tall as the only empire in it. Considering that, belonging to a small nation like Cairo will only bring trouble. So, stand with Valhalla. If you raise the honor of Valhalla and stand at the forefront, the glory of Roman Dmitry will spread throughout the continent.\u201dAdding intimidation to further increase the chances of securing Roman, McKean spoke of the distant future. Indirectly, he meant that no matter how strong Roman was, he could not fight Valhalla by himself. The difference between a kingdom and an empire was quite vast, and the winner was obvious to anyone.\u2018Any wise person would take us up on our proposal right away. But if he declines it\u2026\u2019McKean hid the truth. Roman was a talent who reached 4-Star in his 20s. Valhalla could not stand other factions taking him. If Valhalla couldn\u2019t get him, it would be appropriate to destroy him before he became a threat instead.When McKean was done speaking, he waited for Roman to answer him.Soon, Roman said, \u201cI refuse.\u201dAt that moment, McKean\u2019s expression, which was kind, changed instantly.\u201c\u2026Are you being serious?\u201d McKean\u2019s asked with a trembling voice.If Roman refused such a proposal, it was safe to say that Valhalla could not get him. And that meant\u2014Roman had to be changed into a target of assassination instead. There was no need to keep him alive if he wasn\u2019t going to stand with Valhalla.\u201cThe reason I refuse is not because of the lack of conditions or because of my loyalty to this nation.\u201d\u201c\u2026What do you mean?\u201d\u201cRecently, I was given too many offers. Become a Royal Knight of the Royal Family, go under Marquis Benedict, Count Gregory, and many more. Considering the current situation in Cairo, I was not going to swear allegiance to any one side instantly, but only after the clear future could be seen. As of now, I am at a crossroads in life. What matters to me isn\u2019t what others give. I would like to take some time and see for myself what I, Roman Dmitry, can become and whether I am worthy enough to accept a proposal or not.\u201dWhen he heard those words, McKean\u2019s expression softened. And that was Roman\u2019s intention. He knew how to buy time in a situation in which he was being pulled in many directions.\u2018He\u2019s increasing his self-worth without making choices. That is what makes him look like a loyal devotee. It is difficult to get him down on his knees now, but if we win his heart, then he will swear allegiance in the end\u2014If they think of me like that, they will end up giving up their obsession for now.\u2019Baek Joong-hyuk, the Heavenly Demon, wasn\u2019t someone stupid. He knew that once such relationships turn into hostile ones, they only end with the death of either of those involved. And in a complex situation where four factions were involved, he knew how to take advantage of them.Hearing those words as sly as a fox\u2019s, McKean felt troubled. A person like Roman was someone who those from Valhalla would like a lot.\u2018This is the irony of life. If Roman Dmitry changed his mind quickly and swore allegiance to Valhalla, his loyalty would always be questioned regardless of his skills. That\u2019s because there will always remain a perception that he is willing to side with anyone favorable to him. However, if he was someone who chooses for the future regardless of the conditions, he is worth the wait.\u2019He had no idea this was an intentional act from Roman. His behavior was totally what Valhalla wanted it to be.Soon, McKean said, \u201cI do not know if you intend to confirm the Valhalla\u2019s sincerity, but we will not wait for long. Be careful that you respond to us before it\u2019s too late.\u201dThat was the end. Valhalla took a step back. They will be watching the progress of Roman and also fall into the illusion that he is theirs.Unexpectedly, before leaving, McKean looked back and said, \u201cFor the sake of our potential future relationship, I\u2019ll give you a gift. Beware of the Southern Front. It is comparable to a ticking time bomb that might detonate earlier than even the Kronos Empire is predicted to.\u201dThe Southern Front\u2014This was unexpected information. Thus, Roman\u2019s response ended up better than he thought. He had neither rejected nor accepted them. And instead of bothering to pressure him even more, McKean had given him a useful piece of information.Time passed quickly. The foretold time was now approaching.Baron Romero was worried when he saw his son on the eve of his departure for military duty.\u201cIn the end, you are leaving.\u201dHis heart ached. Many nobles used their powers to ensure their child wasn\u2019t put through hell, but the current Dmitry didn\u2019t have such power. The absolute powerhouse of the North-East was, in the end, a frog in the well. There was no way he could stop Roman from being called for military duty because he wasn\u2019t able to form a connection with the Central Government in the meantime.Even Roman didn\u2019t want to go at first, but it seems he has understood that if he turns away from reality, someone else will have to shoulder that burden instead.\u201cFather. I will come back in good health.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dAfter exchanging a few words, Roman took a step back.Thirty soldiers were waiting outside for Roman to leave for the battlefield.Finally, Roman left.The emotions he felt were complicated. When he would get in trouble, the relationship between them was that of hate and love, but now that he was finally leaving for the battlefield, Baron Romero only wanted to stop him and not turn his gaze away from his son.Rihanna, who was beside Baron Romero, comforted him.\u201cDo not worry too much. You know Roman is a strong kid. And he\u2019s not even going to the Western Front, where Kronos is attacking, but he only has to go to the Southern Front. There aren\u2019t many issues there.\u201dThose were the only comforting words she could give to Baron Romero then. Nevertheless, she didn\u2019t back then\u2014Just what kind of results would Roman\u2019s expedition to the Southern Front bring?Editor\u2019s Thoughts: What an extraordinary chapter. Honestly, Valhalla\u2019s proposal was exceptional indeed. Also, it seems we will get to see quite the fights on the Southern Front soon :)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 - The Southern Training Center (1)Ten days after leaving Dmitry, Roman arrived at the starting point of the Southern Front.There were no lords in that land, and a little village was made up by people who wished to trade with soldiers heading into the battlefield.They entered an inn to rest their weary bodies before proceeding to the training center.\u201cWe\u2019ll spend the day here today before heading to the training center at sunrise tomorrow.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dEveryone was bright. Actually, they didn\u2019t expect to have such good accommodations. Usually, nobles gave shabby places to their soldiers, but Roman had rented a large and neat inn for them to rest. It was a situation in which showing loyalty was inevitable.The soldiers moved inside quickly, excited.Roman also went in to unpack. He then read a letter he had received a month earlier while seated in the chair.[I heard that you are heading to perform military duty. If you say you are mine, I will solve the problem right away. Still, I will not stop you as I know you want to devote yourself to the nation. Nevertheless, I cannot let anyone who might become mine get hurt in such a barren place. I have used my connections at the Southern Front. Always bear in mind that the Benedict family will always be there for you if you ever need assistance.]Last few months, Roman was persistently courted by Marquis Benedict. As the head of the nobility, he wanted to take Roman away and use him to fight the Royal Knights and take over the entire kingdom of Cairo. He valued the Youngest Ranker in the Cairo Kingdom. Roman had already rejected Marquis Benedict, but he still wanted to use affection to win him over.Even Roman being deployed to the Southern Front was done thanks to the connections of Marquis Benedict.As he said, compared to the Western Front, which directly confronted the Kronos Empire, the Southern Front was peaceful. Still, according to the information Roman learned till now, the truth was different. McKean of Valhalla said the Southern Front was a ticking time bomb that could explode soon. Roman didn\u2019t know that he would be deployed to the Southern Front at that time, but he still ordered Lucas to find the truth behind it.\u2018In the end, I must go and see it myself.\u2019The information was true. And as he wasn\u2019t assigned a desk job, so considering he would be busy soon, Roman took a break.Nevertheless, Roman couldn\u2019t close his eyes for long.Thud!He could hear the sound of men yelling and fighting right below where he was staying. So, he went down to confirm and saw that a fight was indeed happening.Kwang!\u201cYou fucking bastards. Do you know who I am? I am Henry Albert, the second son of the Albert Family! The descendant of the Cairo Kingdom\u2019s famous family wants to use this inn, but you fucking idiots whose origin isn\u2019t even known are saying that you will be staying here, and I need to endure this?\u201dThe situation was obvious at a single glance. It was a fight that was started by some other noble. Still, he had to confirm the facts, so Roman went to Chris.\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d\u201cMy liege!\u201dChris was stunned. He, who had just been on the verge of explosion, reported all that had happened.\u201cThat\u2026\u201dThe situation went like this: Thanks to Roman\u2019s consideration, the soldiers were just about to rest, but just then, the second son of the Albert family came in with his troops and then screamed for everyone to get out. This was the largest and cleanest inn in the area, so it was fine if he intended to use it, but there was no reason for everyone to leave.Furthermore,\u2018This isn\u2019t even a place to call ourselves the famous Albert family.\u2019It wasn\u2019t a nameless family.It was once a family that had a reputation for producing outstanding talents, but then it was crushed down by the other families that kept them in check when they were recklessly trying to expand their power. They were people who lived in the glory of the past.Still, it was a powerful enough force when compared to those in the North-East, but Roman\u2019s reaction wouldn\u2019t have been much different even if it was a famous family.\u201cWhy do we have to go out?\u201dWhen he came forward, Henry\u2019s ferocious gaze turned toward Roman.\u201cAre you their master?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen please understand the situation. I don\u2019t know where you came from, but I, Henry Albert, will be using this inn. If you are in a position in which you will be going to the Southern Training Centre, nothing good will come from getting into a fight with me. I will give you 10 minutes to get all of this trash out of my eyes.\u201dHe was brave. It must have been because he was seeing the emblem of the Dmitry Family for the first time. Henry Albert judged the opponent to be worthy and decided to behave himself a bit.\u2018Is this the reality of Dmitry?\u2019It was like a frog in the well. Dmitry was an absolute powerhouse only recognized in the North-East. Naturally, the families in other regions did not recognize Dmitry, and there was no reason to treat an unknown family on par with other noble families.Most of the families deployed at the Southern Front were classified as powerful in the Cairo Kingdom, so it was wise if one retreated without creating trouble.Nevertheless, Roman found Henry\u2019s eyes annoying.\u201cI have no intention of emptying the inn. Anyway, there is an easy way to solve this situation.\u201dHe changed his attitude. And as soon as he finished those words, he unsheathed his sword.\u201cPull out your sword. If you defeat me, I will gladly empty the inn.\u201dIt was a provocative statement.How dare a mere noble below me act like this? This cannot be forgiven.Just when Henry was about to unsheathe his sword, the knight next to him turned to Henry with a pale face and stopped him.\u201cLord, you need to stop right now. Your opponent is Roman Dmitry! He\u2019s the youngest swordsman to ever get into the Rankings.\u201dAs soon as he heard those words, Henry went stiff.Is this what it feels like to get goosebumps?Henry\u2019s eyes looked troubled as he was about to draw the sword.\u2019\u2026That guy is Roman Dmitry?\u2019Cairo\u2019s Youngest Ranker?There was no noble who didn\u2019t know about it. Since he was from a family that lived on the outskirts, it was natural that he didn\u2019t recognize the symbol of Dmitry, but the reputation of Roman was undoubtedly high. The fact that he was an unofficial ranker didn\u2019t even matter. As Valhalla themselves recognized Roman, there was no way the rumors could be false.\u201cPull your sword out.\u201d Roman urged him.Henry gulped at the sight of Roman waiting for him.\u2018The moment I draw my sword, he will cut my head off.\u2019Among the rumors of Roman, there was also the mention of his involvement in Lawrence\u2019s war with Barco. Roman Dmitry, who had put his opponent into the corner, went over to the estate of Barco and killed his eldest son right before him. That incident had become quite famous. From then onward, he was known as a demon without blood and tears.Along with the rumors of him being the Youngest Ranker, the rumors showing how terrifying Roman was weren\u2019t left out. Those were the reasons Henry looked wary. Even though his pride was hurt, and even though he had never bowed to anyone in his life because of being from the Albert family, he had no choice but to swallow his pride in the situation in which his head would fly off the moment he drew his sword.If his opponent was truly Roman Dmitry, he had to avoid this confrontation no matter what his pride told him to do.He finally understood his arrogance wouldn\u2019t work here. Thus, Henry took a step back and said, \u201cAh, I forgot I had some plans. I will take this as an apology and let this go. I think you are quite lucky. Y-you, who dared to ignore the Albert family\u2014Ack!\u201dTak!Just when Roman took a step forward, Henry panicked and ran out. Seeing the soldiers rushing out toward their master, who ran away, Roman laughed.\u2018Is this the reality of the Southern Front?\u2019The Southern Front was kind of a resort for the children of nobles. He now saw the reality with his own eyes.The case of Henry wasn\u2019t a one-time thing. That day itself, three similar incidents happened, but they all ran away when they heard the name \u201cRoman Dmitry.\u201d Seeing that situation, the innkeeper commented, \u201cThis is quite common here. Unlike the Western Front, which is constantly threatened by the Kronos Empire, the Southern Front has a peaceful relationship with the Hector Kingdom. So there is no danger here, and the sons of nobles who want to avoid actual military duty often come here. Maybe you can even call it a vacation for the nobles? The training is generous, and there is nothing like risking their lives when they head out. It is quite perfect for carrying out military duty in the name only.\u201dThe Western Front and the Southern Front\u2014Even though they both were in the same nation, the situations were quite different. If the troops on the Western Front were those who risked their lives every day, those on the Southern Front didn\u2019t do much.As a result, there was turmoil when they were staying at the inn. Just like Henry, every noble who came to the Southern Front had lived their lives without any issues, so they thought they could act recklessly even if someone else had booked the inn in advance.It was funny. Despite not entering the training center yet, Roman already got to know about the reality of the Southern Front.Roman opened up a map. It had information related to the Southern Front, and each area was divided and detailed with information Lucas and the information guild had collected till now.\u201848 days ago, the recon troops of Hector Kingdom crossed the border. They checked the dynamics of the Southern Front and went back, but after that, they came back and checked again 3 times. It is not clear what their intention is yet. However, based on the bits of information I found, the Southern Front isn\u2019t as safe as it is said to be.\u2019There were the signs of war, such as the warning from Valhalla and the Hector Kingdom scouting out the Southern Front. It didn\u2019t mean that there would definitely be a war, but it didn\u2019t mean there was no possibility of it either.Just for that reason, Roman trained his soldiers even more intensely. He would pass the time in peace if a war didn\u2019t break out in the 2 years he had to stay here, but he had to be prepared for the worst possibility nonetheless.Most of the people at the Southern Front weren\u2019t prepared for war, neither mentally nor physically. Unlike the rest of the army, who weren\u2019t prepared, Roman and his men had trained hellishly for the past few months. If a war really broke out, they had no intention of trusting the scum relaxing on the Southern Front. They would survive and lay the groundwork for the future themselves.\u201cWar\u2026\u201dThe tip of Roman\u2019s nose suddenly felt a familiar smell of blood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76 - The Southern Training Center (2)The next day, Roman entered the Southern Training Center as scheduled. It was a basic procedure everyone had to do before being put on the battlefield. Thus, Roman and other nobles appeared with their soldiers. The faces of the nobles didn\u2019t look good. It was because none of them had enlisted voluntarily. If their loyalty to the nation was that great, they would have gone to the Western Front, where help was needed the most, and not the Southern Front.Soon, a man who seemed to be the commander came forward.\u201cI am Viscount Bale Frank, the commander of the Southern Training Centre. As everyone knows, the Southern Training Center is where basic military training is taught to soldiers deployed on the Southern Front. You will receive 3 weeks of training here and will be assigned to a reserve unit and spend the rest of your service period there.\u201dAttending basic military training and then being assigned to a reserve unit\u2014The process was the same for the Western and Southern Front. Nevertheless, the Southern Front didn\u2019t have many battles and even had Reserved Troops, whereas the Western Front had no Reserved Troops as they were constantly in battles.Thus, among the soldiers, a saying circulated\u2014A soldier who serves on the Southern Front gains a lot of weight, and a soldier who serves on the Western Front can hardly return in good health. In summary, they were polar opposites.Even the atmosphere here told Roman everything. Far from feeling wretched at the thought of being on the battlefield, people were yawning.\u201cThere are some facts you must keep in mind while staying here. Whatever your status might be before enlistment, here, you are only a soldier performing military service. Anyone who breaks the rules of the training center will be sent to the Western Front as a punishment.\u201dIt was funny to consider sending others to the Western Front as punishment. Still, the absurd thing was that it actually worked. Even imagining something like going to the Western Front from the Southern one was terrible. Thus, they paid a little more attention.Viscount Bale\u2019s speech was short. When he was done speaking, the troops disbanded.\u201cEveryone, unpack in the assigned dorms. The training schedule will be announced in the evening.\u201dFinally, they were admitted, and for now, they belonged to Southern Training Centre.Just when Roman was about to head to his own dorm, a soldier approached him and said, \u201cThe commander wants to meet you.\u201dRoman\u2019s thought of Viscount Bale making eye contact with him throughout the speech wasn\u2019t a delusion.The first thing Roman was greeted with in the commander\u2019s room was the bright smile of Viscount Bale, which was far from seen in the welcoming speech.\u201cCome on in! The road to the Southern Front must have been difficult.\u201d\u201cYes. It wasn\u2019t much.\u201d\u201cCome and sit.\u201dDrr.Viscount Bale pulled a chair by hand. It was kind of awkward. Roman had seen Viscount Bale for the first time in his life, but Viscount Bale acted as if they were old acquaintances.\u201cYou know how excited I was to hear that you were being deployed to the Southern Front? Roman Dmitry, the Youngest Ranker of the Cairo Kingdom! Oh, I was so excited to know the sleeping dragon was born in Dmitry. Ah, are you fine with coffee?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dViscount Bale was humming when making the coffee. While a soldier could have performed this task on his behalf, he chose to handle it himself.The commander\u2019s room was instantly dyed in the aroma of coffee.He took a sip of coffee and smiled as he put Roman\u2019s cup ahead.Tak.\u201cDrink it. Actually, the reason I called you here is to ask something. Rumor has it that Marquis Benedict used his powers to place you on the Southern Front. Is that true?\u201dThis one-sided favor had a purpose. It wasn\u2019t something huge.Viscount Bale\u2019s eyes were looking at the coffee, but he wanted something from Roman.Roman didn\u2019t know for what purpose this was being asked, and seeking neutrality, he judged he didn\u2019t have to hide it.\u201cYes. I didn\u2019t ask for it, but Marquis Benedict did do that.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dViscount Bale\u2019s expression brightened. Actually, he had already confirmed the truth to some extent. Still, he had to check it through Roman, and when he got the answer he wanted, he couldn\u2019t hide his happiness.\u201cRight. I will tell you my point straightforwardly. I want to look good to Marquis Benedict. The Southern Training Camp isn\u2019t a bad place, but it is nothing compared to the lavish life in the capital. That is why I will take care of you, so that nothing is lacking for you while you stay in the training center. I don\u2019t mean to ask for much. Just do one thing\u2014Later, when you meet Marquis benedict, tell him that Viscount Bale Frank took good care of you. That is all you need to say.\u201dIt was a straightforward and blatant statement.Bale Frank\u2014Like Dmitry, he, too, was a noble from the outskirts and had the grand dream of entering the Central Government. However, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn\u2019t get into the Central Government.The training center was a location that received requests from numerous nobles\u2019 families, and Marquis Benedict wasn\u2019t someone he could even touch. He was the core of the noble faction. It was an area that Viscount Bale could never touch normally, and he needed a way to make the link with him. And that is what he judged Roman Dmitry to be.\u2018Marquis Benedict has done a great task for Roman Dmitry. If Roman Dmitry swears allegiance to Marquis Benedict at any time, he will be able to lead me to the noble faction. This is a rare chance to enter the Central Government.\u2019He had no intention of hiding the purpose. This was a deal. A deal that one got in return for a comfortable life in the south. The Southern Training Center was a place where the commander ruled. That was why even though he openly asked for an improper solicitation, Viscount Bale didn\u2019t look the least bit shameful.\u2018Interesting.\u2019Roman kept smiling while hearing his proposal. Marquis Benedict and Viscount Bale\u2014They weren\u2019t naturally meant to be together throughout their lives. Still, right now, he was being given a favor that he didn\u2019t have to refuse. Thus, Roman said, \u201cI understand. I will never forget this kindness.\u201dThat was all.Roman kept the smile on his face and accepted the favor.Roman exited the commander\u2019s room.He was going to head back to his dorm straight away, but just then, he met someone with a familiar face.\u201cYou were here!\u201dIt was Henry Albert\u2014The person who had caused a riot in the inn. Contrary to the appearance of him hastily running away back then, he looked calm now and said, \u201cAs I pondered my actions, I realized that I did not do anything wrong to apologize to you. In short, Dmitry is just a Baron family on the outskirts and I, the second son of Albert, said I wanted to use the inn. Does it make sense to run into a fight only for that?\u201dYesterday evening, Henry couldn\u2019t sleep. It was because he was angry. He was born and brought up in a rich family, so he couldn\u2019t accept being humiliated by someone from a Baron family. It didn\u2019t matter to him if Roman was the Youngest Ranker. From what he heard, Dmitry was originally a family of commoners, so unlike him, they couldn\u2019t be called true nobles.His stomach boiled in anger, and he waited for today. When he entered the training center, he thought that even Roman wouldn\u2019t be able to mistreat him.And at Roman\u2019s blunt reaction, Henry pushed further on.\u201cYou touched the wrong person. Do you know what family my mother is from? It\u2019s the Frank family. Now you know what mistake you made? Right, the commander, Viscount Bale Frank, is my uncle! So apologize to me! I will not let this slide, especially to my uncle.\u201dThe background he believed in is Viscount Bale.Even though Roman was the Youngest Ranker, here, he was just a soldier and nothing more.Thus, Henry felt proud of himself. This time, he was sure of his victory.But\u2026\u201cSo?\u201d\u201c\u2026Uh?\u201d\u201cYour maternal uncle is the commander of the training center, so what?\u201d\u201cYou\u2014Do you not understand this situation? My maternal uncle clearly stated in the welcoming speech that anyone who broke the rules would be sent to the Western Front. The disciplines don\u2019t just refer to acting like soldiers. It includes those who don\u2019t behave as my uncle likes, and guys like you are included in that!\u201dHe was frustrated. Roman was showing such a reaction even when he knew who his uncle was. Cold sweat began to drop down his head, thinking that Roman might pull out his sword again.\u201cI don\u2019t think you know what the Western Front is like. Even if you are a 3-Star Aura Swordsman, you will die in a moment out there. You stay here and wait! I will bring my uncle and see if you can act this proud then.\u201dHe took a step back to take one forward. Until then, Henry Albert firmly believed his uncle would solve his problems.\u201cUncle!\u201dSeeing Henry, Viscount Bale smiled broadly.\u201cOh, my. My nephew is here?\u201dTo the general public, Henry Albert might not be much, but to Viscount Bale, he was the lovely nephew he wouldn\u2019t wish to even see get hurt. In particular, Henry resembled Viscount Bale\u2019s sister too much with his brown hair and playful appearance.\u201cBut why is my nephew looking like he will cry?\u201d Viscount Bale asked after checking Henry\u2019s expression.\u201cUncle, what would you do if someone from a Baron\u2019s family threatened me?\u201d\u201cWhat? Who is that bastard?!\u201dViscount Bale got up from the seat. A child had threatened his pretty nephew. There was no need for him to listen to this any further.He grabbed the sheathed sword on the wall with an angry face.\u201cTake me to that bastard right now. How dare someone touch my nephew at this training center?! I will crush him down!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dHenry\u2019s expression brightened. If his uncle would handle this, then he was sure everything would work out. Once one entered the training center, the commander\u2019s orders were absolute.Henry walked hastily as he thought Roman would run away the moment he saw Viscount Bale.\u201cIt is that guy.\u201dHe pointed to the other person with his finger. It was Roman Dmitry.That idiot didn\u2019t run away.Seeing him waiting for them, Henry raised his lips into a smile.Viscount Bale arrived a bit late, and as soon as he saw who was pointed at the other end of the finger, his expression hardened. He closed his eyes and opened them again. He turned to look at Henry and then back at Roman. He truly wanted to deny that the one his finger was pointing to was Roman. On the other hand, Henry was waiting for Roman to be reprimanded.Viscount Bale felt lost.\u2018This crazy bastard is trying to block my growth.\u2019He made a quick decision before Henry even said anything else. Viscount Bale slapped Henry on the cheek.Whack!Along with the enormous sound, Henry\u2019s proud face instantly changed.Editor\u2019s Thoughts: What an ending lol. Henry\u2019s fate has become quite interesting now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 - The Southern Training Center (3)Henry grabbed his cheek. Feeling a tingling pain spread throughout it, he looked at Viscount Bale with a shocked expression and wide eyes.\u201c\u2026Uncle?\u201dIn Henry\u2019s memory, Viscount Bale was a maternal uncle who loved him a lot. From a young age, Henry grew up watching the man do anything he asked for. Naturally, there was a time when he liked his uncle more than his parents. He was so important that he never imagined being slapped in the face by him.Tears welled up within him. It was more difficult to mentally accept the fact that he had been hit by his maternal uncle more than the pain on his cheek.Despite that reaction, Viscount Bale didn\u2019t even look at him and smiled awkwardly at Roman.\u201cThis\u2026 I am quite sorry about this. I had to make sure that my nephew had his mind straight. He seemed to have made a mistake due to being young and immature. I will apologize. For my sake, please turn your eyes away from this.\u201dThe opponent was Roman Dmitry. No one knows just how much he will develop in the future. Moreover, since he was favored by Marquis Benedict himself, Viscount Bale decided to apologize quickly.Indeed, it was a very rational decision. No matter how much he usually cherished the nephew, it wasn\u2019t enough to exchange affection for his future. In the end, even Henry\u2019s own parents would have slapped him.Henry was shocked when Viscount Bale asked for forgiveness.There was no need to escalate the problem any further. Henry\u2019s actions were like a child\u2019s pranks and would not be considered hostile by Roman.Of course, without the wise judgment of Viscount Bale, the situation wouldn\u2019t have ended this easily.\u201cBecause of Viscount Bale, I will let this go.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dViscount Bale tried to smile. Seeing Roman retreating, he looked at Henry with angry eyes.\u201cHenry, do you know what you did?\u201d\u201c\u2026But how can uncle hit me?\u201d\u201cYou idiot! Roman Dmitry is a talent that Marquis Benedict is keeping his eyes on. He will do anything to get that guy on his side, so what are you doing by trying to look high and mighty by looking down on such a talented man?! Henry. When are you going to grow up? There will be no problems if you act like this in the Albert family, but out here, you cannot act like this. Your family cannot protect you here.\u201dHe told him the cold reality. If only the Albert family was a great family, Henry wouldn\u2019t have been assigned to the Southern Front. His parents would have pushed to get him exempted from military duty instead.Still, he now showed him the reality and the ambiguous power. Henry didn\u2019t know the reality and didn\u2019t recognize the rising power.Nevertheless, suddenly, Viscount Bale came up with an idea.\u201cRoman Dmitry may be someone you don\u2019t like today. So Henry, from now on, start training. You will be attached to the reserve forces with Roman, so try to become friendly with him. Keep this in mind\u2014If you don\u2019t follow your maternal uncle\u2019s advice, I will send you to the Western Front, and even if your mother begs, I won\u2019t change the decision, okay?\u201dAt that moment, Henry understood that because of one mistake, his comfortable life on the Southern Front had entirely turned into ashes.After the commotion was over, Roman headed over to his dorm. Dorms were randomly assigned in the training center to all trainees, but as soon as he arrived at his dorm, Roman could see what kind of preference he was given.\u2018Viscount Bale worked hard.\u2019On the way here, he saw the other nobles unpacking in old, worn-out rooms. It was a scene understandable because of the situation at the Southern Training Center, but Roman was assigned a very neat and new building as accommodation. It was a single-story building designed to accommodate only one team. Indeed, Viscount Bale\u2019s ambition for power was truly great.\u2018It is easy to deal with people who openly express their ambitions. Maybe my life at the training center will not be all bad.\u2019Unlike the demands of Viscount Bale, Roman would not be able to give him the power to rise to the Central Government. However, he judged it was necessary to take full advantage of the current situation.Kik!He opened the door to the house. Inside, the soldiers were almost done unpacking their things. When they saw Roman and were about to salute him, Roman lightly rang the bell hanging by the door.Tring!All soldiers instantly stopped their work. The meaning of the bell was imprinted into their minds over the past few months.\u201cAn emergency!\u201d\u201cEveryone, prepare for battle!\u201dIn an instant, the well-organized place turned into a mess, and the soldiers poured their things onto the floor. They took in small things, and 30 soldiers hurried at once.Roman came out. After the dropping of the bell, as if he had nothing to do, he just walked away and gazed at the door, relaxed.How long was it?The soldiers began to walk out and lined up in front of Roman. They were all quite quick and tidy.Even while they were panting for breath, they stood upright.Roman said, \u201c2 minutes and 39 seconds. Even though you were in the middle of cleaning the place and unpacking, spending more than 2 minutes preparing for battle is too much. I have been telling you people that the enemy will not come to us at a perfect time. In a situation where we do not know when, where and who will attack us, we need to make sure we can prepare in the shortest time possible to survive. If it takes more than 2 minutes the next time I announce an emergency, you all will be punished appropriately.\u201d\u201cWe understand!\u201d\u201cWe will keep it in mind!\u201dThe soldiers shouted out quite loudly. Indeed, it was a unique sight. There was no one more disciplined than Roman\u2019s troops among all the troops who followed their masters here.The Southern Training Center was called a resort for nobles. Nevertheless, it didn\u2019t matter to Roman\u2019s soldiers. When Roman gives orders, they follow\u2014It was a situation that was normal for them now.At the same time, McBurney, the general instructor of the Southern Training Center, couldn\u2019t hold back his sighs as he prepared for training.\u201cI am preparing for this kind of training.\u201dHe was a veteran warrior who once served on the Western Front. As he was loyal to the nation, he himself volunteered to go to the Western Front, where battles frequently took place. And in recognition of his performance there for 10 years, he was promoted. He, who had started out as a captain, had become a commander. Nevertheless, it was only for a short while as he soon fell into an abyss.3 years ago, the Kronos Empire decided to cross the border. They attacked Cairo, and many soldiers lost their lives back then. McBurney was not much different. Although he prevented the fall of the Western Front, he lost his sword-wielding right arm. When he felt the pain of losing his arm, simultaneously, he also felt his life as a warrior come to an end.And as the battlefield wasn\u2019t a place for the disabled, McBurney was stripped of his position as a commander. Still, the Kingdom didn\u2019t abandon him entirely.\u201cMcBurney, in recognition of your achievements on the battlefield, I intend to appoint you as the training instructor of the Southern Training Centre. Even though you must leave the battlefield, I hope you will continue working for the future of the Cairo Kingdom.\u201dMcBurney\u2019s reality had changed. He felt like he still had work to do for the future of Cairo, but the grim reality was that, unlike on the Western Front, the awareness of war was far low on the Southern Front, and most of those who came here weren\u2019t here to prepare for war but to spend time in vain before heading back home. As a result, the training was a total mess.Usually, even the nobles at the Western Training Centre were trained as soldiers, but the nobles here couldn\u2019t even bother to hold a sword. Furthermore, while their soldiers trained in the scorching heat of the sun, the nobles would take shade and rest under the trees.Even the Southern Training Center\u2019s commander didn\u2019t care about it, so only McBurney, the trainer, was having it rough.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dHe looked down at the training schedule with a sad face. The training system was planned quite well, with basic physical training for 3 weeks, but everything was meaningless if the nobles didn\u2019t train with their soldiers.War is, after all, a battle of heads. Commanders not only exist to give orders, but they must also understand the level of the soldiers and have the stamina to move accordingly and give orders without messing up their breathing. However, those who had never experienced war did not know such things. Most of them were just trash who thought wars could be won in the flash of an order.\u201cHaah\u2026\u201d\u00a0He sighed. It was only his third year here, but the motivation he had was already crumbling.\u201c\u2026They should at least do the bare minimum.\u201dStill, he thought it would be the same this time.Nevertheless, while the nobles enjoyed leisure time, McBurney would still teach the soldiers. It was all because he had deeply experienced the fear of the word \u2018If\u2019.As expected, the next day, the nobles who arrived at the training ground took shade under the giant trees before the training even started.\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cIt is. Later, when you come to our estate, I will show you what true pleasure is.\u201d\u201cYou promised. I will visit you for sure.\u201d\u201cBrother should always come!\u201dThey were chatting like old friends with excitement in their voices when they were supposed to be training.And on the contrary, their own soldiers were standing and experiencing the scorching heat of the sun. Unlike the enlisted soldiers Roman brought, they were troops the nobles\u2019 families sent to protect their children. Thus, they were far from being elite soldiers. Obviously, there was no reason to send the best troops of the family to a place like the Southern Front, where no wars took place, and waste good resources out of fear.The level of the soldiers was so low that they were unable to even line up properly.Seeing them sweating even before training, McBurney only sighed.\u2018As I thought.\u2019He was hoping for a different scene this time.As it was on the Western Front, he wanted to lead strong soldiers who were loyal to the nation and feel proud of what he did, but now, he felt ashamed looking at people who were titled as soldiers but couldn\u2019t even do the bare minimum of what a soldier should be able to.What if these soldiers were sent to defend the Western Front? The Western Front\u2019s defense would collapse without holding on for a single day.\u2018This is the same nation, then how can the two sides be so different?\u2019He suppressed his emotions. As the instructor, he had to be faithful to his role. He cannot lose his calm.However, just then,\u2019\u2026?!\u2019Unlike the clumsy ones he saw earlier, he now saw soldiers lined up straight on each side, and in front of them, there was Roman Dmitry. Even though the sun was shining brilliantly, Roman Dmitry and his soldiers were standing straight without moving a single inch.He then realized that his thoughts were wrong. This year, unlike the trash he had seen before, Dmitry\u2019s Future had entered the Southern Training Center.Editor\u2019s Thoughts: Finally, the training of the soldiers will begin in the next chapter! What an ending for this one. Also, in the last line, Dmitry\u2019s Future is referring to Roman, just in case anyone didn\u2019t get it. And Henry\u2019s comfortable life on the Southern Front seems to be over as well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78 - The Southern Training Center (4)McBurney thought that there could be problems later on if, by any chance, Roman Dmitry was standing there because he didn\u2019t know how the Southern Training Center worked yet. Thus, he said, \u201cRoman. Southern Training Center doesn\u2019t force training on \u2018nobles\u2019. If you do not want to train, you can watch it from the shade of the trees, just like everyone else.\u201dSometimes there were people who thought they also needed to train and waited in the sun, only to later argue that they were being discriminated against when they saw the appearance of the other nobles. McBurney was tired of all that.Unlike Viscount Bale Frank, who was the commander, the instructors didn\u2019t have much power in the training center.Roman asked, \u201cAre you talking about them?\u201dRoman\u2019s gaze turned toward the shade of the trees. There were nobles who were busy talking with each other rather than coming to train on the training ground.McBurney nodded at Roman\u2019s question. Nevertheless, it was a moment that somehow made him feel ashamed.However,\u201cI will train.\u201dRoman refused to go to the shade of the trees even though he knew the truth. He wasn\u2019t like the other nobles at the Southern Training Center. The other nobles only thought that war didn\u2019t happen here, and the commander was the one who would give orders to the soldiers anyway. Also, wasn\u2019t war something that soldiers actually fought? That was their common sense\u2014A commander watches war from afar and gives his orders.Nevertheless, those who had actually experienced war had entirely different opinions. Looking directly at McBurney, Roman said his thoughts out loud.\u201cYou are not wrong. The enemies\u2019 attacks do not know about nobles and their identities on the battlefield. Nevertheless, even nobles should receive basic training. Of course, most have the misconception that the one who has the position of a commander is in a safe place. A war in the plains might be mostly safe. However, if one is being chased after being defeated in war, or if attacked by an enemy who came from the rear, the nobles will not be able to recover from it, let alone give proper orders due to their weak strength.\u201dThat wasn\u2019t all. War wasn\u2019t always fought in plains. Often, war is fought within mountains, rivers, swamps, and other places. Thus, in order for a commander to do their job as a leader in various terrains, it was necessary for them to train in the same way as the soldiers.And,\u201cI understand the training at the Southern Training Center is a process of grasping the strength of the soldiers and passing the experience of you all, who have stayed here for long. Thus, you don\u2019t have to do that for me. I decided that I needed training, so I am ready for any training, regardless of my status.\u201dRoman was done. Now, it was as if he wouldn\u2019t say another word until training started.As Roman stood and gazed directly into his eyes, his heart started to pound intensely.\u2018Ah.\u2019McBurney had fallen in love with who Roman Dmitry was.People risk their lives even for those whom they barely know?Even the day before, McBurney\u2019s motivation was down on the ground. His skepticism as an instructor was huge, but after hearing the words of Roman, he felt his pride rising again.\u2018He has a perfect grasp of my intentions.\u2019It was the first time he met a person who thought in the same way as himself, despite him being a noble and saying he would do the training voluntarily.It wasn\u2019t just an impulsive thought. McBurney, who had served on the battlefield for a long time, eventually developed an eye to see if the other person was being honest or not, and now, Roman\u2019s calm eyes did not show someone who did not know about war.The enthusiasm he had a really long time ago was finally revived within McBurney. He thought it would be extremely helpful to someone like Roman, so he wanted to impart the best education he could to Roman.\u2018I was only going to conduct moderate training, just like any other day. But I will have you do the most difficult one from now onward. Even if a disaster hits the Southern Front, I will make sure you have the minimum physical strength and military knowledge to survive and win against your enemies. I will do the best I can.\u2019With that one decision, McBurney opened the gates of hell for the trainees. The first week of training was focused solely on physical training. Originally, the trainees only had to warm up with a simple run, but now, right from the start, McBurney told the trainees to put heavy things on them and climb up a mountain.\u201cThe purpose of this training isn\u2019t simply to improve your physical fitness. Wars can break out suddenly, and you all, who do not know when they will, sometimes will have to climb mountains with heavy items. In this exercise, you all will not only strengthen your bodies but also learn how to climb mountains quickly. Regardless of the weather, you all will have to climb a mountain at least once a day from now on.\u201dTak. Tak. Tak. Tak.Hundreds of soldiers ran down the mountain with pale faces. As if climbing up was not horrible enough, they now had to run down as well. Still, this was just the start. The soldiers, whose stamina had completely depleted right from the start, simply filled their stomachs and immediately gathered at the training ground.\u201cThis training is quite basic. War is a battle of mental strength that will never end. So, in order to fight to the end without losing your concentration from sunrise to sunset, you need to test your limits. From now on, you all will proceed with infinite slashing training without any counting. I will warn you in advance\u2014Do not give up. Those who do give up will have to proceed with extended training in their sleep time.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cFuck.\u201dCurses came from all over the training ground. Normal soldiers could not refuse the orders of an instructor, so they could only accept the harsh reality they had to go through. McBurney\u2019s warning wasn\u2019t in vain. Many soldiers fell in the scorching sun. Some were shivering and even trembling. Nevertheless, he continued to train people.\u2018On the battlefield, you will have to go through a more brutal time.\u2019The Southern Front was no exception to war. As much as he was moved by Roman\u2019s words, he wanted to share the reality he had seen on the Western Front.\u201cKuak.\u201d\u201cI-I need a break.\u201dThe trainees\u2019 voices sounded like they were dying. They were only conscripts. As they weren\u2019t actual soldiers and didn\u2019t even receive proper military training, they couldn\u2019t keep doing the training that drove them to the extreme.McBurney even thought he would stop the training if most had similar reactions and couldn\u2019t go on, but he couldn\u2019t. It was because Roman\u2019s soldiers, from start to finish, were perfectly carrying out the training while being led by their liege.Huk!Roman swung his sword. It was an action he had already repeated hundreds of times. Even though his skin was red due to the heat from the sun and his entire body was drenched in sweat, he did not stop training. Furthermore, he wasn\u2019t even using mana. He was just immersed in pure physical training.Simultaneously, the soldiers surrounding Roman only looked at him, bewildered. They couldn\u2019t believe Roman\u2019s actions. Even if he rested in the shade of the trees, no one would have said anything, but he was out there training with the soldiers.\u2018Just like one refines their sword before fighting, it is necessary to strengthen the bond between the soldiers and myself.\u2019Heavenly Demon Baek Joong-hyuk didn\u2019t rise to the top as soon as he was born. He started from the bottom-up, so he knew what emotions and thoughts those receiving orders had. They always complained, even about the most trivial things.Even today, while the soldiers were training in the intense heat of the scorching sun, their leaders were sitting and chatting in the shade while smiling. Wasn\u2019t it natural for resentment to rise from within them in such a situation? Still, it didn\u2019t mean that there would be extreme results such as a revolt, but surely, the weight of their leaders\u2019 words would turn lighter to them.Suppose there is a leader who is training with them and another who isn\u2019t. Whose command would the soldiers follow? It was a difference no one could overlook easily. They would undoubtedly follow the orders of the leader who suffered with them, and it wasn\u2019t uncommon for the outcome of a war to be reversed due to such differences. This didn\u2019t mean that he should always suffer with them\u2014Just until the trust was established. And if it was judged that the action was sufficient to affect the war, there was no reason for the commander to move directly to win.It was a complex reasoning. Still, while training himself, Baek Joong-hyuk never avoided such things to strengthen his solidarity with soldiers. Seeing him at the forefront of his soldiers, even the other Demonic Sect members began to follow him.The conquest of Murim wasn\u2019t done by one person alone. The trust between him and his men, built from the bottom-up, was what had brought that true.\u201cEuk, euk.\u201d\u201cEuk.\u201dNow, even Roman\u2019s soldiers looked like they were going to die. Like other soldiers, they, too, had the urge to give up, but they couldn\u2019t because of Roman. When their leader was working hard, how could the soldiers give up?The soldiers of other nobles had collapsed on the ground already. They were resting on the ground, gasping for air, but Roman\u2019s soldiers couldn\u2019t do that.That day, not a single one of Roman\u2019s soldiers sat down until the training finished.The first day of training was finally over.After sunset and finishing their training, the soldiers came out to wash themselves.Swish!\u201cHaa, this feels nice.\u201d\u201cThose who said the training would be fine were lying. There was no mention of us rolling on the ground like this,\u201d the soldiers grumbled.Fortunately, Roman\u2019s soldiers looked fine.Was it because they did not like this?A soldier under another noble, who was there, said, \u201cWhy do you people only think about your own position? Can\u2019t you cut down a little bit on your enthusiasm while thinking of other people?\u201dThroughout the training, they couldn\u2019t openly demand Roman\u2019s soldiers to rest. McBurney wouldn\u2019t have pushed the training this much if Roman\u2019s soldiers had given up, but they were training so perfectly that he didn\u2019t even allow any leeway.Most of them came to hate Roman\u2019s soldiers while panting on the floor. They thought Roman\u2019s soldiers\u2019 stamina must have been built perfectly over the years, but the other nobles\u2019 soldiers didn\u2019t have anything like that.And because of that, when they saw Roman\u2019s soldiers training without any issues, they were annoyed. And the moment they met in the bath, they began to raise their voices.\u201cUnlike you all, we were conscripted. Our training period was so short, so how the hell do you think we can withstand a training of the same intensity as you guys? If we had enough time, we all could have done the same thing as you all.\u201dJust then, hearing those words, one of Roman\u2019s soldiers came forward.\u201cI am curious about those things you are saying. Just how much time is enough training time for you?The soldier of Roman who came forward looked menacing. His body reflected well-sculpted muscles. It proved he had been training hard for so long, and he had muscles any man would admire.The soldier flinched when he saw him. He felt pressured the moment he saw the other soldier\u2019s body up close.\u201cWe only had one year of training. We are different from you people, who have been training for years. So, take it easy. That way, the instructor will lower the intensity of the training for all of us.\u201dOne year\u2014That wasn\u2019t a short period of time.Hearing those words, Roman\u2019s soldier laughed. The moment he heard they had been training for a whole year, he wondered how could one sound so silly. Was it because he remembered the past? As a soldier of Roman, he couldn\u2019t stay quiet after hearing something like that.\u201cDon\u2019t make excuses like not having enough time. We didn\u2019t even have one year of training, unlike you all. It has been less than one year since we first began to train together. No, to be precise, it has been only three months since we started to train sincerely. And you all are saying you didn\u2019t have enough time to prepare? Don\u2019t get me wrong. You people had plenty of time. The only problem is that you just didn\u2019t do your best.\u201dThe soldier of Roman who said that was also one who had successfully passed the enlistment test. He was once an ordinary human who trembled in fear while taking the test. He was Henderson, who had come from Lawrence after watching Roman\u2019s actions.Editor\u2019s Thoughts: Roman\u2019s insights are quite good to see. Also, Henderson humbled that guy so fast lol.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 - The Southern Training Center (5)The day the notice of Roman enlisting soldiers came, Henderson thought,\u00a0\u2018I want to be a man of Roman Dmitry.\u2019He still could not forget what happened at Lawrence\u2019s Square. Henderson and the others were only having a normal day until Roman came in and trampled the peace. And people covered their mouths at the sight of Ben Miles, a heinous criminal, being dragged along by the hand of Roman while his blood constantly dripped down on the ground. And soon, Roman executed Ben Miles. He said he couldn\u2019t forgive the Blood Fang, who touched the people of Dmitry, and didn\u2019t even mind getting his hands dirty with blood. When he saw that look, Henderson couldn\u2019t help but admire him. Because of that reason, Henderson, who was originally from Lawrence, instantly applied to become one of Roman Dmitry\u2019s people.\u2018A soldier doesn\u2019t need to have great qualities.\u2019\u2014That was the common thought of those who applied. They thought Dmitry wasn\u2019t a huge family, so it wouldn\u2019t be tough to become one of Roman\u2019s soldiers. However, what happened? Even after he managed to pass the test, Henderson had to face many more difficulties. It was mainly because all those who had passed the test were far from ordinary. Not to mention Chris and Kevin, who had demonstrated their Aura in the war, there were veteran mercenaries like Lucas and Pooky. In the end, there was only one person there who could be called normal. And that was Henderson.In fact, if that was all, Henderson felt like he could somehow survive as one of Roman\u2019s soldiers. However, the training truly stunned him.\u2019\u2026Can I even stay here?\u2019\u00a0was his thought for the first few weeks while training. Looking at the other soldiers who were so much better than him, Henderson even thought he didn\u2019t deserve to be here. It was also because, actually, unlike those who had strong hearts and didn\u2019t even blink an eye during the test, he looked like he would pee out of fear.His heart still raced as he thought about it. In a group that was full of wild predators, he only thought of himself as a herbivore.He pondered it for a long time. Finally, he went to Chris and said, \u201c\u2026I am sorry, but I don\u2019t think I am qualified to serve Sir Roman Dmitry.\u201dIt was a realistic decision. Most would have even considered it to be correct. Nevertheless, Chris asked, \u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know why. Maybe it is because, unlike the other soldiers here, I am a beginner who doesn\u2019t even know how to properly wield a sword. I cannot keep up with the training process, and it doesn\u2019t make sense for me to waste the resources of Sir Roman Dmitry. I think I was arrogant to even want and come here to follow him when all I did was farm all my life.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that because you think your level is below that of others?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIf Chris had heard that before he met Roman, he would have agreed with Henderson. However, even Chris had become different now.\u201cWhen I think of Kevin the first time I saw him, he was nothing more than a kid who had passion in his eyes. To be honest, I couldn\u2019t understand why a man like our liege would even bring in a kid from the slums. But does Kevin still look weak to you? No. In that short time, Kevin grew into a warrior no one can ignore.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is that true?\u201d\u201cOf course, it is. It is a funny thing, but I was the same back then. When I first met the young master, I was ignorant and ran toward him only to get my teeth broken. At that time, I was a frog in the well. And just like the current Kevin is different from the Kevin of the past, I have also changed from the past by the guidance of our liege. So, what are you worried about? The young master has accepted you as a soldier. You might be humble now, but you have the potential to grow, just like Kevin and me. Roman Dmitry\u2014the young master we serve has the ability to make it possible.\u201dBa-dump!His heart began to pound intensely. Kevin was truly someone who was recognized by everyone. But even Kevin was someone who was but a small child before he met Roman Dmitry.\u2018Can I also be like that?\u2019He wasn\u2019t sure, but after hearing Kevin and Chris\u2019 case, hope bloomed in his heart.\u201c\u2026To be honest, I did not believe in myself. As a farmer, I could not even imagine being as strong as you and Kevin, but as you have said, I will trust the eyes of our liege, Chris. He chose me from so many applicants, so he must have a good reason. I will focus on my training again. And in the future, I won\u2019t come looking for Chris for such things.\u201dHenderson\u2019s mindset changed entirely that day. And from that point onward, Henderson\u2019s life began to change as well.The last few months, Henderson was obsessed with training to death. He did it all in order to not bring shame to Roman. Even if he puked all day, even if he fainted during training, Henderson continued to go against the odds and eventually caught up with his colleagues and created his current body.Because of that, when he saw the other soldiers, who had a whole year to train, complain, he couldn\u2019t help but raise his voice.\u201cWhat do you people think war is? When you are on the line of life and death, where you can only survive by killing others, will you say that you cannot fight because you only had a short training time? Pathetic bastards. One year is the time when you can farm until the harvest comes. You all are just making pathetic excuses for the comfortable life you have been living and saying that you had no chance because of your life as conscripts.\u201dWhen a war begins, one needs to defend their life. Even if they were drafted, how hard they worked could bring about a vast difference. However, what were the soldiers of other nobles doing? They were just holding onto saying that they didn\u2019t have the minimum qualifications. Seeing them complain about such stuff, Henderson could only frown. \u201cFor all of you, who have lived their lives without training hard for a year, today\u2019s training must have been quite difficult. But if you know that your current state is lacking, isn\u2019t it a common reaction to try and catch up with us instead of blaming us? Why? Are you asking us to come down to the same level as you now?\u201dRoman told them earlier that for their time on the Southern Front, they had to prepare for war. Roman\u2019s soldiers all trained as if they were on a real battlefield and, although not perfect, they were sure they would have a chance of survival and winning, if a war truly broke out. That was why they couldn\u2019t understand the other soldiers\u2019 reactions. Being in the same room as them and hearing their na\u00efve thoughts made their skin crawl.Even though Henderson\u2019s words were brutally offensive, the soldiers of other nobles could only stay silent. The fact that Henderson\u2019s preparation period was less than even half a year made them all go silent.\u201cTruly idiots.\u201dOnce he said that, Henderson turned away from them. Even if their attitude didn\u2019t change, Henderson would still train with the same passionate attitude the next day and the days after that as well. He would do so because it was the will of Roman Dmitry. And because of that will, Roman\u2019s soldiers thought that the war had already started.The training continued. It was quite extreme. Still, even though the intensity of the training increased day by day, Roman\u2019s soldiers only clenched their teeth and continued to train hard.The nobles who watched the training noticed the gap between them was too much. Was it because their pride was hurt because of the difference? They, while watching the others training as if they were on a battlefield, complained, \u201cWhy are they all overdoing it?\u201d\u201cRight. This isn\u2019t even the Western Front for them to be that dedicated. It\u2019s the Southern Front, which is far from war. However, it seems like our men are suffering because of them.\u201d\u201cWell, those born shallow will do such things. If they don\u2019t act out like this, how will the Dmitry family even get recognition?\u201d\u201cRight. Hahaha!\u201dThey openly mocked Roman. The Southern Front was known to be a place for the nobles to spend two years of vacation at. Rather, it would have been understandable if this was the Western Front. There, people even got rewards for doing such things, but the Southern Front was unlike that.Roman, who was under the sun, had a bright red face.Seeing him training so hard with the soldiers, the nobles thought he was foolish.Nevertheless, among the nobles under the shadows of the trees, there was a noble who, rather than ridiculing him, looked worried. That noble was Henry Albert.\u2019\u2026How do I even win the heart of someone like him?\u2019Right, the current situation was quite odd for him. If he was interested in pleasure, like other nobles, Henry could have struck up a conversation, but Roman was only sweating and working hard. Henry\u2019s thoughts had changed from those he had the first day. Actually, if it wasn\u2019t for his uncle\u2019s orders, even he would have been making fun of him. Nevertheless, he couldn\u2019t. When he thought he would be assigned to the same unit as someone like Roman, his head started to ache.\u2018No, was I ever this sensitive? If he came to the Southern Training Center, it should be to speak and build friendships with others. In the end, common people do not know how to relax and take it easy, eh? I don\u2019t know now. I guess things will work out in the end.\u2019He lay down in the shadows of the trees as the sun was quite hot today. He could hear the soldiers shouting while training to cheer themselves, and he lay down in the coolness of the shade.He thought after a good night\u2019s sleep, maybe this tedious training would end.At that time, on the front line of defense on the Southern Front, Cairo\u2019s soldiers watched the border.\u201cUgh, I am exhausted.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t even ask that. I only slept for 2 hours as I was busy playing cards with the 2nd\u00a0Squad.\u201dThe soldier had quite a tired face. He didn\u2019t even look at the border. He only gently checked to see if there was anyone under the fortress wall, and he then pulled out a water bottle hanging from his waist and opened up the lid.Sniff.The smell of alcohol irritated the tip of his nose. The soldier next to him was dumbfounded.\u201cYou brought alcohol?\u201d\u201cDoes it matter if I brought it? We need to let go of being so strict. Does it matter if we have a drink in a place where no one will come anyway? And rather, this is good for work efficiency. It is better to have a little drink and get up than work while feeling sleepy.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to drink, tell me. I will just drink by myself if you don\u2019t want to.\u201dGulp.He drank it. A stimulating sensation went down his throat. And seeing the other soldier like that, the other one couldn\u2019t resist it.\u201cJust one sip.\u201d\u201cThen, here.\u201dOn the Southern Front, this was a common sight. The long time of peace had given birth to a sense of complacency. They became even more complacent as there were no major problems during their years of service yet.But they didn\u2019t see it. While drinking, the shaking at a place of lush vegetation at the border had gone unnoticed.Editor\u2019s Thoughts: Man, Roman and his soldiers are truly epic. Also, the war is about to begin! Let\u2019s go!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 - An Unforeseen Disaster (1)The Hector Kingdom was once a power comparable to the Kronos Empire. They were growing rapidly based on their defenses, but they fell to hell after losing the war against the Valhalla Empire. Their current situation wasn\u2019t much different from the Cairo Kingdom. They had no choice but to look at what the Empires were doing while making any decision. And as a result, a meeting was being held covertly in the Royal Palace, away from the prying eyes of other people.A man with a scarred face, Jackson, who was also the commander of the Ranger Unit, knelt before the King of Hector and reported the information he had learned.\u201cLast year, the Ranger Unit scouted the Southern Front of the Cairo Kingdom 48 times. We came to learn that the Southern Front consists of 5 defenses in total, and the Cairo Kingdom is not interested in the Southern Front, and they mainly use their forces to defend the Western Front, which is constantly at odds with the Kronos Empire. The guards of each defense line usually work for 4 hours before they change their shift, and the guards and soldiers both have noticeable lazy attitudes. It must be because they think that they have a peaceful relationship with us. From all of that, I don\u2019t think it will be too difficult to capture the Southern Front.\u201dIndeed, it was something they could do without even losing the lives of their soldiers.They were giggling as they observed the drunken guards when they snuck into the bushes to inspect the fortress walls. A long time ago, when the Hector Kingdom was called a great power, the Cairo Kingdom had never shown such complacency. At that time, they used to guard the Southern Front as well as they did the Western Front. However, as time passed, the Hector Kingdom lost its power, and the Cairo Kingdom began to believe that the Hector Kingdom was the same as them. And why would they be afraid of someone of the same level? From that point onward, they didn\u2019t even think that the Hector Kingdom would invade them.\u201cFather, can I say something?\u201dIn addition to the King of Hector and Jackson, there was one more person there. He was a man with red hair. He was Edwin Hector, the only son of King Hector.\u201cSay it.\u201d\u201cThe Hector Kingdom has been going through an incredibly bad harvest for the past five years. The drought has caused the soil to dry up and die, and the crop and showers are also being swept away by the powerful winds. Also, the strain on us is only increasing as a result of the money we borrowed from the Golden Bank to fix the issue. The might of the Hector Kingdom is no longer sufficient to endure this. The national treasury has been drained for a long time, and if this trend continues, it won\u2019t be long before Hector loses the name of a \u2018Kingdom\u2019 on the continent.\u201d\u201c\u2026It isn\u2019t like I don\u2019t know that.\u201dKing Hector looked distraught hearing all that. The former King had started a war to achieve his grand dreams, but the consequence of that was still being borne by his descendants. King Hector was also a victim of that. The situation of the Hector Kingdom wasn\u2019t good even before he took the throne, and he took on the throne when the nation was going down fast. Thus, people said that the heavens were angry.Seeing people sitting on dry and twisted land while weeping, Edwin decided the time to make a decision had already come.Edwin said, \u201cFrom a long time ago, the Hector Kingdom has shunned war with the belief that we can\u2019t make the same mistake twice after we lost the war with Valhalla. But we can\u2019t do that anymore. Since we are the ones alive now, we must take action to help our people who are in despair. The defeat Hector suffered in the past wasn\u2019t actually suffered by us. We have spent the entire last year putting a lot of effort into our preparation, and this time, we have to go against Cairo, not Valhalla. We need to choose now, for the sake of the kingdom.\u201dWar was a word no one dared to say in Hector.Although King Hector was considered to be weak, he was actually cautious. That\u2019s why he planned it for a whole year. And finally, after they were ready for war, he discussed it earnestly.\u2018Is that man really my son?\u2019Edwin Hector didn\u2019t resemble his father. He was strong and had inherited the mighty bloodline of the once mighty Hector family.Looking into his son\u2019s eyes that were burning with greed, the King asked cautiously, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cYes. If I wasn\u2019t sure, I wouldn\u2019t have spoken of this in the first place.\u201d\u201cI get it.\u201dTak.He got up from the throne. As the saying went that heroes were born in times of turmoil, he considered Edwin\u2019s growth to be inevitable.\u201cAll the matters related to this war will be entrusted to you, Edwin Hector.\u201d\u201cThank you, father.\u201dFinally, the Hector Kingdom had come to a decision.Around that time, the 3 weeks of training at the Southern Training Center were also finished.In front of hundreds of trainees, Viscount Bale delivered a boring speech.\u201cEveryone has been through a lot. Unlike the Western Front, many battles don\u2019t take place on the Southern Front usually. You will spend more days bored than you think once you have been assigned to a unit, but you must not forget that you all are soldiers who protect the Cairo Kingdom and cannot carelessly invite disasters into the Cairo Kingdom. I hope your time on the Southern Front will be peaceful.\u201dThose were words Viscount Bale had constantly repeated each time the training of any unit finished. And just like that, he ended his speech with words even he knew would not make sense. Right after finishing the ceremony, he called for Roman to meet him separately. Just like when they first met, he gave him some sweet coffee while having a kind smile on his face.\u201cFrom today onward, your unit will be formed as a reserve unit that will serve on the 5th Defense Line. You have probably heard of what the other nobles have to say. It is a paradise where all nobles wish to be assigned to, and it is the place where one can live most comfortably while their freedom is limited the least. And\u2026 Hmm, I also used my contacts a bit to assign you to the 5th Defense Line.\u201dHe had already heard the rumors from when the nobles were talking in the shade. Many nobles spoke of the 5th Defense Line. As it was famous for being the most comfortable one, it was difficult to get assigned to it without any connections. And Viscount Bale usually exercised his power for a special price. However, this time, he was in a position where he had to show himself as someone nice, and he had to reveal his own power so that Roman would do him a favor.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cWhy thank me? I am just doing the right thing. And I already told you earlier\u2014There isn\u2019t much I want. I only want you to tell Marquis Benedict that you had a comfortable life on the Southern Front because of Viscount Bale Frank. That is all. So, if you ever need anything while staying on the Southern Front, feel free to come to me. The job of the commander is to help the ones who come here.\u201dAs Viscount Bale smiled and Roman nodded his head, the meeting ended.Roman left the commander\u2019s room. There was one more person looking for Roman. It was McBurney. He was the instructor of the Southern Training Center, and he spoke to Roman with a different expression than usual.\u201c\u2026Thank you for all you did. Actually, there was no noble yet in the Southern Training Center who showed the passion for training as much as you, Mr. Roman Dmitry. Thanks to you, I realized what I was working for, and I think I will be able to teach the future ones even more passionately. Also, I prepared this because I thought it might be a bit helpful.\u201dIt was because McBurney wanted to give Roman some gifts. They were a shabby book and a map.When Roman looked confused, he added, \u201cThis is a compilation of information about the Southern Front. If a war breaks out on the Southern Front, this is the information you will need. Of course, spending two years in peace would be the best situation. I also hope for that. I hope that Mr. Roman Dmitry will get out of here in good health.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dAs it was a favor without any malicious intent, Roman accepted it while smiling.Seeing that, McBurney\u2019s heart instantly began to pound intensively. His heart told him to follow Roman until the end. As a man who was once a warrior, he already knew that Roman Dmitry was a man worth giving his life up for. However, he couldn\u2019t.\u2018Someone like me will only get in his way.\u2019He had already lost one of his arms. And it was impossible for him to even wield his sword properly with his left hand. Roman Dmitry was going to be a big person in the future, and he already had a bunch of talented people like Chris and Kevin.He doesn\u2019t need a broken man.If he could not do anything, then he would only get in the way, so he decided that staying here was the right thing to do.And like that, their conversation ended.Roman moved on. Now was the time for him to head to the 5th Defense Line.Roman pulled something out after he moved away from McBurney.\u2018I was told Lucas worked quite hard to get this.\u2019It was a map that had \u201cThe Southern Front\u201d written on top. It was actually very similar to the gift McBurney had given him. Truthfully, Roman already had the gift McBurney gave him. Before he came to the Southern Front, he had already gathered the required information, so this gift wasn\u2019t extremely necessary. Still, Roman smiled as he wanted to thank McBurney. Even now, he kept it in his pocket as he felt grateful to McBurney. There was no particular reason for that. Roman only wanted to accept the sincerity the man had shown him.Roman thought that pure kindness itself was something that had to be respected.The deployment of the troops was now finished. And on the way to his unit, Henry walked helplessly.\u2018Why do I have to move on my own? Shouldn\u2019t the nobles be given their own wagon to carry their things?\u2019His soft feet, which had never suffered till now, were hurting. As he had to travel a long way on his feet, which had no calluses yet, he felt thirsty and sweaty.However, he could not demand a wagon. It wasn\u2019t impossible if he used his connections with Viscount Bale, but the problem was that he was too concentrated on Roman Dmitry. It didn\u2019t seem as if he was dissatisfied with the situation of walking with his own soldiers.\u2018Haah\u2026 How did such a situation come about?\u2019Viscount Bale called Henry aside and emphasized a few words countless times yesterday evening.\u201cHenry. I have organized it so that your unit serves on the 5th Defense Line, along with Roman Dmitry. Within 2 years, you need to somehow get close to Roman Dmitry. Keep it in mind. This is a very serious matter on which your uncle\u2019s future depends. So, no matter how precious you are to me as my nephew, if you don\u2019t do this job correctly, I will be angry.\u201dHe felt lost. Being assigned to the 5th Defense Line was good news. If it had been just that, he would have been smiling and jumping around, but now, the thought of spending time with Roman Dmitry made him annoyed. Still, what could he do? The reality was already in front of him. So, all he can do is try and show Roman a little of his better side. Thus, rather than ranting, Henry chose to walk with his soldiers too.How far did he walk? After moving for a long time, the group was finally able to arrive at their destination. But the scenery there was different than they had expected.Tang! Tang!\u201cEmergency! Emergency!\u201d\u201cEveryone, prepare for combat!\u201dIt was a total mess. The sound of bells ringing loudly could be heard, and everyone was running around constantly.Back then, they didn\u2019t know what had happened. And as Henry was wondering what could have happened, an officer approached and said, \u201cJust now, the 5th Defense Line of the Southern Front has been attacked! The Hector Kingdom has declared war!\u201dThe moment Henry heard the word \u201cwar\u201d, his heart sank to the bottom.Editor\u2019s Thoughts: Man, McBurney\u2019s lines were sad. Him giving the gift to Roman and Roman\u2019s thoughts were quite wonderful though. Also, the war has officially been declared! It seems there will be quite some bloodshed on the battlefield soon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81 - An Unforeseen Disaster (2)One hour ago, when the Sun rose to the middle of the sky, Cairo\u2019s soldiers, who were on guard duty at the First Defense Line, looked at the border with relaxed expressions. Work had always been boring for them. There was no one in sight, and they had nothing to say about working on the border while having nothing much to do.Finally, after being unable to stand his boredom, a senior soldier sat on the floor, leaned his head against a wall, and said bluntly, \u201cI am going to sleep, so inform me once this shift is finished.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dIt was a normal situation. On the Southern Front, where there was no need for them to endure their drowsiness and watch the border, they rested when they wanted to.Just how much time had passed? The next shift\u2019s soldier came to him.\u201cG-get up! I think you should see this!\u201d\u201cMan\u2026 What happened\u2026 Ugh!?\u201dHe was a senior soldier, yet he was forced to wake up from his sleep. He was about to shout in anger, but when he looked at the scene outside the fortress, he was utterly speechless. Far away, he could see thousands of people attacking the First Defense Line. At first glance, he easily recognized they were armed forces with the flag of the Hector Kingdom. He was dumbfounded after seeing that. Finally, after 10 seconds passed, he came back to his senses and shouted, \u201cCall the commander right now! Hurry up!\u201d\u201cY-Yes!\u201dThe soldier went out right away.Even though they were at the forefront, it took a considerable amount of time for the enemy\u2019s presence to be known to them. And it was only troops coming for now.Then, a commander, who didn\u2019t look all that good, came hurriedly.\u201cWhat the hell!\u201dThe commander of the First Defense Line, Count Donald, confirmed what had happened with a pale face. As it was reported, the troops of the Hector Kingdom were advancing, and if things went on like this, it wouldn\u2019t be long before they would attack the wall itself.Honestly, according to the manual, they had to attack back immediately. The first step was to block the enemy\u2019s approach by using weapons prepared on the wall. Still, even though the soldiers hurried and readied their arrows to fire, he still didn\u2019t give the orders.\u2019\u2026Does the Hector Kingdom truly intend to declare war on the Cairo Kingdom\u2019The relationship between Hector and Cairo wasn\u2019t bad.Especially, as the Hector Kingdom was having a tough time recently, there was no reason for them to wage war in their current state.Maybe it was just military training? But if they intended that, there was no reason for them to march with flags fluttering widely. He thought so because the Hector Kingdom had no cause for it. Just as a cause was important for war between nobles, a cause was absolutely necessary for one nation to wage war on another. Due to all that, his thoughts were intertwined.Even though the soldiers were waiting for his command with arrows aimed, he didn\u2019t give it.\u2018If I give the order, a war might actually start. That is a problem that no single noble can shoulder. And as the Hector Kingdom is approaching so fast, it can be interpreted that they just want to talk to us soon. Let\u2019s try to talk with the commander of the Hector Kingdom. It isn\u2019t like it will be too late to make a judgment then.\u2019Count Donald was a typical scaredy cat commander with no war experience.Eventually,\u201cLower all the bows for now. If we show them that we aren\u2019t willing to fight, they might resort to talks.\u201dHe made a stupid mistake.The Hector Kingdom had no intention of talking. As their distance to the fortress got closer, they rang the drums on the battlefield loudly, and the commander also ordered them to charge in unison.Thud! Thud! Thud!\u201cFull-scale attack!\u201d\u201cAttack!\u201dTatata!It all happened in an instant. Hector\u2019s soldiers rushed through with siege weapons, and Cairo\u2019s soldiers were shocked at the sudden situation, not knowing what to do. The war had only just begun. Still, as it was a scene they never thought would happen on the Southern Front, they couldn\u2019t easily accept what was going on.Eventually, Count Donald also came to his senses. The war he wished wasn\u2019t true had turned into a reality, and he realized that in order to survive, he had to prevent the enemies from crossing the wall.\u201cEveryone, fire the arrows!\u201d\u201cRelease them!\u201dPapak!Hundreds of arrows rose high into the sky and fell toward their enemies.Contrary to the menacing sight in front of them, the enemy didn\u2019t lose their spirits for a long time. Only in a few seconds, the troops of the Hector Kingdom had raised the shields they had prepared in advance high, and the number of people they lost wasn\u2019t too much. Truthfully, most of the arrows didn\u2019t even go far and were stuck in the ground. That wasn\u2019t only because of lack of training. Aside from neglecting training, some of the soldiers were drunk even though it was morning.If they had known there would be a war, they would have never taken even a sip. But as the war started so suddenly, they couldn\u2019t adjust to it. It was a literal mess. When they saw those approaching the wall, they realized not many enemies were killed by the arrows.\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough arrows.\u201d\u201cHurry up and bring more!\u201d\u201cIs the magic weapon not working?\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201dIt was a total mess. Because the arrows weren\u2019t prepared in advance, some soldiers had to run to get them, and the magic weapon which was purchased a month back didn\u2019t work. It was a scene that showed the reality of the Southern Front of Cairo. And unlike the Western Front, where one didn\u2019t die from being careless, the Southern Front was so comfortable that even such basic needs of war were messed up.Finally,Tak.A ladder was placed on the wall.Count Donald realized what mistake he had made when he saw the enemy troops coming up quickly.\u2018If this is the case, we won\u2019t last long.\u2019His face turned pale as he understood the clearly-unfavorable situation. As soon as he judged that they couldn\u2019t stand against Hector with the current strength of the First Defense Line, he screamed at the soldiers, \u201cCall the reserve unit right now! Bring all the personnel stationed in the units to the First Defense Line, and report to the Royal Family that the Hector Kingdom has declared war on us! It is an urgent situation here! Move fast!\u201dThe soldiers went out.The war was a reality now. And from now on, it was their turn to pay the price for their carelessness.At the same time, once they heard that the Fifth Defense Line was attacked, Henry and the others hurried.\u201cHuff\u2026 Huff\u2026\u201dHenry was out of breath. Even though he didn\u2019t want to, he had to walk for a long time, but now, as he had been running as fast as he could, he was out of breath. The distance between the Fifth Defense Line and the reserve unit was more than he had expected. And as the officer had said that it would take about 2 hours to go there by walking, it meant he needed to run for at least another hour from now.\u2018Is the Southern Front made of mindless bastards? If the purpose of the reserve forces is to support quickly in case of an emergency, shouldn\u2019t they be less than an hour away? Ugh, these fucking idiots.\u2019He swore a lot inwardly. Henry thought it was good to join the reserve unit and be in a secluded place, but he forgot about the fact that reality was hard and rough. Also, Henry\u2019s vision was actually looking for something else.\u2018If it is Roman Dmitry, will he be able to reach there soon?\u2019As soon as he heard the news of war, Roman led his troops and ran straight toward the First Defense Line. In fact, they were so fast that it took less than 3 minutes for them to vanish from Henry\u2019s eyes. He tried to catch up to them, but he soon understood that he could not catch up with them.He felt a bit flustered. Roman Dmitry had trained hard while the other nobles were resting in the shade and making fun of him, but when the war broke out, he was the one who showed a significant difference in physical strength right from the start. On the contrary, Henry was gasping for breath along with his men. They all looked like they were on the verge of dying. As they were running nonstop, some of them even looked dehydrated.Eventually, Henry sat on the ground. He kept exhaling roughly.\u201cHuff\u2026 Huff\u2026 Huff\u2026\u00a0Let\u2019s take a break!\u201dIf they didn\u2019t move quickly, the First Defense Line would be in danger. But, so what? What good would it be if he died from exhaustion before even reaching there? With those thoughts, Henry laid down.The first place to be attacked was the First Defense Line. But the place that faced the crisis of falling before that was the Fifth Defense Line.Bang!Rumble.\u201cThe gates have opened!\u201d\u201cStop them!\u201dThe gates were smashed open.The gates, which were made of steel, had low durability due to negligent maintenance, and Hector\u2019s soldiers knocked them down with a few hits from the siege weapon. And that was the start of hell. In addition to the enemy troops climbing up the ladder, screams of the enemy forces rushing through the gates like a tide could be heard from all sides.The commander of the Fifth Defense Line, Baron Bruce, staggered back with a pale face.\u2018It\u2019s all over.\u2019There was a reason it was called the Paradise on the Southern Front. Baron Bruce was a rotten person, and besides being in charge and living in luxury here, he never imposed military duties on anyone.The risk? What would be the risk if there wasn\u2019t going to be a war?This time, at the request of Viscount Bale, he dispatched nobles who were of little use to the Fifth Defense Line, and even this morning, he felt good at the thought of getting rewards from him for that. But based on what he now knew, not even the reserve forces that would show up would be able to change this situation.\u2018To hold on to the Fifth Defense Line anymore is suicide. In order to live, I need to leave this place and run away.\u2019He made a quick judgment. And rather than it being about doing the correct thing, it was focused on his own survival.Baron Bruce shouted, \u201cHold onto your position till the very end! Innocent people\u2019s lives will be in danger if this line is crossed! Risk your lives, and never, ever give up!\u201dHowever, contrary to the words he had shouted out loud, he had no intention of risking his life. Still, didn\u2019t he need people to buy him time to escape? And as Baron Bruce knew that, he ordered his man and started to run away quickly.\u201cCommander! Where are you going?!\u201d\u201cI plan to contact the Royal Family. Hold the front!\u201dObviously, there were people in the way who asked him that, and he lied to get away. No matter how things turned out later, he decided saving his life was more important. As Baron Bruce was fat, normally, running for only one minute would make it hard for him to breathe. But today, he was really fast somehow.At this point, Baron Bruce, who had fled from the Fifth Defense Line, was sweating heavily.\u2018I need to run. If I arrive at the rear camp, I will be safe from the Hector Kingdom barging in.\u2019How far did he run?At some point, he saw a group of people who were running quite fast in his eyes. And, at the forefront of them, there was Roman Dmitry.Editor\u2019s Thoughts: That Baron Bruce needs to die soon. Also, Roman Dmitry has finally arrived.\u00a0And bloodshed has arrived with him as well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82 - An Unforeseen Disaster (3)As soon as Roman got the news that the Fifth Defense Line was attacked by the enemies, he concluded it wouldn\u2019t last long.\u2018The Southern Front is a place where the sense of defense is lacking in almost everyone, but even among them, the Fifth Defense Line is the worst because it is managed by Baron Bruce, who is entirely rotten. And even if they struggle, they won\u2019t last any more than 2 hours. We must get there in an hour, at most.\u2019Lucas had given him information, and it mentioned the same thing the book McBurney had given him said. There was no time. After notifying the officers in the reserve unit that he would go, Roman moved with his soldiers.They were informed it would take about two hours to reach there as a reserve unit.It was obviously difficult to cut it down by an entire hour, yet, Roman\u2019s soldiers followed him. It was the moment when the training they had done in the past began to show its results. For soldiers who had climbed a mountain with heavy armor on them on a daily basis, running on flat ground wasn\u2019t enough to even make them gasp. And before long, they reached the vicinity of the Fifth Defense Line. And just then, when he saw a man running away hurriedly from afar, Roman signaled his men to stop.\u201cOoh! The reserve unit!\u201dThe man looked quite happy. That man was Baron Bruce. To him, the reserve unit was like an oasis in the desert. He wiped the sweat off with his sleeve and said to Roman, \u201cAre you the leader of the soldiers? Give me your official name and guide me to the rear camp. Right now, rather than assisting the Defense Lines, the Royal Family needs to be made aware of the dangers on the Southern Front.\u201dHe continued to gasp for air.Roman only stared at the Baron, seeing him acting like his decision was obviously correct.\u2018The commander of the Fifth Defense Line.\u2019It was a face he had seen in the book McBurney gave him. Nevertheless, the problem was that now that a war was going on, he wasn\u2019t supposed to be here. There were only two possibilities now\u2014Either the Fifth Defense Line was breached, or this man had fled away.\u201cBaron Bruce. Why are you here by yourself with no troops?\u201d\u201cBaron Bruce?! What a cheeky bastard! As you belong to the reserve unit, you must be the son of a noble at most, so how dare you speak to me without putting a title first?\u201d1\u201cI think you misunderstand something\u2026\u201dGrip!\u201cKuak?!\u201dRoman grabbed the collar of Baron Bruce. This movement was nothing much for him. Nevertheless, that wasn\u2019t the case for Baron Bruce. He tried to shake off his hand, but his grip was so strong that it didn\u2019t move even a single inch.Roman Dmitry looked down at him. As soon as Baron Bruce saw his gaze, he felt as if his heart was simmered into an ice bath. He couldn\u2019t handle himself as he witnessed such vicious human eyes for the first time in his entire existence.Then, Roman said, \u201cYour presence here means one thing\u2014The fact that you, who is called a \u2018Commander\u2019, has abandoned his soldiers and ran away. According to military law, a deserter can be summarily executed regardless of their status. Do you know what that means?\u201d\u201cNo\u2014\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t \u2018No\u2019.\u201dSlash!The wind blew.Baron Bruce didn\u2019t even see Roman pulling out his sword, but before he knew it, the blade of the sword reflected his neck being cut.Baron Bruce\u2019s head fell to the ground. He was unable to accept his death, so even as his head was falling, he had a pale face.Shhhk.Roman just wiped the blood off of his sword.It would\u2019ve been a truly shocking event for others. Nevertheless, even though it was a huge thing to kill a noble, Roman\u2019s eyes were only dull as he gazed at the corpse that now lay on the ground.\u201cIf he had ordered for retreat, he wouldn\u2019t have died by my hands.\u201dThis wasn\u2019t a huge issue, anyway. A war was going on. The only witnesses who saw Roman behead Baron Bruce were Roman and his men, and they would never say anything against Roman, nor were they too surprised by this. In the process of destroying Barco, Roman had shown them his cold side far too many times. And when they saw Baron Bruce acting like that, they, as well, wanted to end his life in the same way.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dRoma took the first step. The soldiers hastily turned away from the corpse in order to avoid falling behind their leader.About 1 hour had passed since the enemy had attacked. It was still time when the defending side could take advantage of their defenses, but as soon as the gates of the Fifth Defense Line were breached, the fight between the two sides had turned into more of a one-sided massacre.Puak!\u201cKuak!\u201d\u201cAhhhh!\u201dThere was a cacophony of screams coming from every direction. The soldiers of the Hector Kingdom were mercilessly slaughtering Cairo\u2019s soldiers, and the enemies were constantly rushing through the gates. There was no way they could stop this. The magic weapons didn\u2019t work because of being filled with dust, and arrows wouldn\u2019t work because the enemies had breached the wall too.Still, the soldiers were fighting desperately till the end as Baron Bruce had ordered them to fight, and Steven, the only knight at the Fifth Defense Line, was constantly swinging his sword.\u201cDie!\u201dPuak!His face was now drenched with the blood of the enemies. At least Steven, who was called the \u2018real soldier\u2019 of the Fifth Defense Line, was cutting down enemies one after another. There were already 12 soldiers who had died at his hands. Nevertheless, he couldn\u2019t see the end of them. And seeing the constant influx of enemy soldiers, even his mouth went dry.\u2018Damn it! Damn it!!!\u2019He realized that it was already over. This was a battle they had already lost. If the gates were in good condition, they could at least have endured somehow, but there was no way to stop the enemies from rushing forward as the gates were breached.\u2018I knew this day would come.\u2019Carelessness was contagious. Everyone knew that poorly maintained equipment was wrong. But didn\u2019t everyone act complacently from time to time? Soon, all soldiers accepted it as something normal. The commander of the Southern Front was someone who didn\u2019t like change that bothered him. And as a single knight, he couldn\u2019t change many things by himself. Thus, he accepted the reality that was in front of him, and now, that had led to the current situation.Rumble!When he saw the wall collapse and the enemies rushing through the now-collapsed wall, his eyes began to lose hope. Even with the advantage they had of having defense equipment, the Fifth Defense Line was only able to hold out for just an hour, and it was now collapsing.\u2018We cannot go down like this. Even if we have to retreat, we need to take back all the soldiers we can and make a plan for the future.\u2019He hurriedly tried to look for the commander in his office. He was going to persuade him to call for a retreat, but no matter how much he searched, Baron Bruce was nowhere to be seen.\u2018He couldn\u2019t have\u2026\u2019Just then, he remembered seeing Baron Bruce running somewhere by himself. At that time, he didn\u2019t think he was just running away. Who would even think that someone who was the commander of a Defense Line would escape by himself without even seeing how the fight turned out?Steven\u2019s blood went cold. He had an intuition that this would be where he would die.\u201cThat fucking pig!\u201dHe could run away just like him, but\u2026 he didn\u2019t want to. He thought it would be an honor to die fighting while doing his best than abandoning everyone and surviving all alone.\u201cKuaaaa!\u201dHe then gripped his sword even more tightly and ran forward again to cut down the enemies in his vision. He was going to lose his life anyway. Baron Bruce wouldn\u2019t leave the survivors alone because he would not want the truth of him deserting the battlefield being told to anyone else, and there was no reason for Steven to run away from here only to go and suffer there.He felt at ease once he accepted his death. Even though the wounds on his body began to increase, he was only drenched in madness, and he continued to kill his enemies.Slash!He cut down even more enemies. It felt like he had taken countless lives by now with his sword, but in return, he was stabbed with a spear as well.Puak!\u201cKuack!\u201dAn intense pain ran through his head. Finally, he realized he was near death now. As soon as he cut off the head of the soldier who had stabbed him, he gazed at the sword that was coming down toward his head.\u2018So this is as far as I go.\u2019He accepted his end. But the moment he accepted his death,Puak!A man with dark hair appeared, and he splattered crimson red blood all around him.When Roman arrived at the Fifth Defense Line, the gates had already been pierced.He had no time to think. Running ahead first, he gave orders to his soldiers.\u201cI will take the lead. Take down the enemies one by one and follow me.\u201dIn his previous life as Baek Joong-hyuk, he was always at the forefront and fought the enemies before anyone else. That was how he was able to achieve the nigh-impossible achievement of taking over the entire Murim.And he decided it would be no different in this world. If he killed even one more person, the damage to his side would be that much less. He tried to minimize it as much as he could.Roman jumped and ran ahead. Then, he swung his sword at the enemies who found him.Puak!It was the beginning of a literal massacre on the battlefield. The two soldiers who tried to attack him instantly had their throats slashed. He was literally too powerful. Like a wolf that had found a flock of sheep, he was moving ahead while slashing everyone in his vision. Still, he wasn\u2019t in too much of a hurry. He was taking reasonable intervals when he needed to. It was to maintain the distance from his soldiers. Thus, most of the blades that should have been aimed at the normal soldiers were now aimed at Roman.\u201cT-That monstrous bastard!\u201d\u201cKill him first!\u201dThe soldiers of the Hector Kingdom also realized that Roman wasn\u2019t an ordinary person. Even though they all attacked Roman at the same time, all the corpses in their vicinity belonged to the soldiers of the Hector Kingdom, no matter how many times they attacked him.In just 5 minutes, Roman had killed dozens of the enemy soldiers. The blood of all of them was dripping down his sword, and even Roman himself was now drenched in blood.Just then, Roman saw someone in his vision who was fighting the enemies ferociously.\u2018Steven?\u2019He was a person who was mentioned in the book. According to the information Lucas had given him, on the Fifth Defense Line, Steven was someone who was worth using. Then, Roman made a quick decision when he saw Steven had accepted his death after slaughtering the enemies he could. He took down the soldier who was swinging his sword at Steven.Puak!Tuk!Roll.The soldier\u2019s head rolled on the ground. There was no time for Steven to even say a word. It was because another large number of enemies had entered through the wall, and Roman had gone forward to cut them all down.\u201c\u2026What is this?\u201dSteven was stunned seeing the current situation. Even more shocking than his own survival was the slaughter Roman was carrying out.Was there such a person on the Southern Front?When he thought hard, he remembered there was one person.\u201cRoman Dmitry. He was recently assigned to the Fifth Defense Line.\u201dThat was what he had heard from Baron Bruce this morning. And when he heard that a Ranker was assigned on the Southern Front, Steven was actually unable to accept that fact. It was because Rankers were incredibly strong. In the end, he thought that it would have been better if he was placed on the Western Front rather than the Southern One, which was known to be peaceful, and that if Roman truly cared for the safety of the nation, he would\u2019ve himself asked to go to the Western Front. However, he now realized that was a huge mistake on his end. When he saw that Roman had arrived so quickly, Steven realized that he had come running here as fast as he could.Puak!\u201cKuak!\u201dEventually, even the last soldier in the vicinity died at Roman\u2019s hands.After he killed the last enemy nearby, Roman wiped the blood off his sword and walked up to Steven. Then, he asked, \u201cAre you Steven?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBaron Burce is dead. From now on, you are in charge of this place and as you have served on the Fifth Defense Line for many years, tell me what methods are needed to protect this place based on your judgment. If you don\u2019t see a chance here with your judgment, then I, Roman Dmitry, will be calling for a retreat as the head of the reserve unit.\u201dIt was a flustering situation. His mind wasn\u2019t ready for this. Still, as Roman asked him about his experience, Steven thought a bit and then said, \u201c\u2026Honestly, this battle is already too much in their favor by now. It would make a lot of sense to retreat now, but doing that will give the enemy a huge advantage instead. A river flowers behind the Southern Front. They need to clear a way on it to supply troops to move in case the war continues, but they have no chance of winning a long-lasting war unless they completely capture the Fifth Defense Line.\u201dHe spoke his thoughts. At first, he thought of giving up, but the more he talked, the more he told him why they couldn\u2019t leave this place.Then, it was necessary to change the situation.\u201cThere is only one way. The enemies no longer have to push through the gates. The wall that collapsed left a narrow path, but the gate was different. Even if it\u2019s a last-ditch effort, if we can buy ourselves ten minutes to set up the spare iron fences, we can prevent the enemies from entering.\u201dThat was the only way. If all the enemies pierced through the Fifth Defense Line, they wouldn\u2019t be able to win even if they sacrificed all their troops. Still, even though Steven knew that it was a difficult choice, he had to do his best. Nevertheless, the plan he came up with was still impossible. When hundreds of enemies were rushing through the gates each passing second, how on Earth could they secure it?But just then, Roman said, \u201cI will secure the space that is required for the installation of the iron fences. Now, you must mobilize your forces and prepare the iron fences as soon as you can.\u201dSteven couldn\u2019t help but be shocked as soon as he heard those words.Editor\u2019s Thoughts: This chapter was so amazing! Glad that Baron Bruce died in the beginning. Also, just how much cooler can Roman be?!He means 'Sir' by title. Barons were usually greeted with titles unless the other person was ranked higher than them.\u00a0\u21a9\ufe0fPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 - An Unforeseen Disaster (4)The plan Roman had given was literally reckless. It wasn\u2019t anything like solving the problem with a clever operation, but breaking through the enemy forces and securing a space to install the iron fence on through sheer force. Steven decided this just wasn\u2019t it. Even he had thought about it, but he hadn\u2019t said it because he didn\u2019t want to discourage Roman.\u201cIt is too difficult and dangerous. To break through not only the enemies\u2019 army, which is currently entering through the gate, but the forces waiting outside to rush in too. Don\u2019t you get it that when you are isolated, you will not be able to survive? The strategy of installing the iron fence itself is impossible.\u201dIt was the first time he had met a man like Roman Dmitry. What was certain was that as soon as he heard the news about the Fifth Defense Line being attacked, he rushed here to arrive even earlier than the other reserve units, and struggled a lot to clear the enemies.That was why, even though the commander himself had run away, Steven was reassured just with the presence of Roman Dmitry by his side as his ally. And that was also why he wanted Roman to live. Wouldn\u2019t it be too unfair if someone like Roman died in a place Baron Bruce should have?\u201cI can understand what you\u2019re worried about. However, I am not a guy who risks his life on an operation which he considers impossible.\u201dHuk!An enemy tried to do a surprise attack from behind. However, Roman, who had already noticed him, dodged it with minimal movements and thrust his sword through his chin. The enemy trembled and soon died. However, that wasn\u2019t the end of it. Soon, soldiers arrived from behind and shocked Steven.\u201cMaster!\u201d\u201cGive us your orders.\u201dIt was because Chris and the other soldiers who had arrived were also drenched in blood, as if they had showered in it. It seemed there was no one wounded among them because the blood on them was that of the enemies they had killed on their way here. Their eyes looked like those of predators. Seeing the true spirit of war on this battlefield in those who were waiting for Roman\u2019s orders, Steven\u2019s intuition said that there was still hope left.Then, Roman said, \u201cFrom now onward, we will make way for the gate to be closed.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dNo one questioned that risky plan. What were they thinking? Them following Roman\u2019s orders without even the slightest doubt showed how loyal and disciplined they were.Steven admired their blind trust. Baron Bruce, who was also called a leader and followed by Steven and his men, ran away as soon as the gates were pierced, but Roman\u2019s soldiers looked like they would follow him to hell itself if he gave the order to do so. How did he even form such a relationship with them? It was not something Steven could understand with his common sense.Roman took the lead. Seeing that he hadn\u2019t come to his senses yet, Roman said, \u201cFocus on your role. The war is not over yet.\u201dAs soon as he finished those words, Roman ran toward the enemies and initiated another massacre on the battlefield. It seemed as if blood was raining down from the sky. And soon, a path made of blood opened up. The men who were following Roman did the same as well.\u201c\u2026Ah!\u201dSteven only then got back to his senses. There was no time to be lost in thoughts now. The plan had already begun, and in order for Roman\u2019s actions to not be in vain, he had to do his part.\u201cSquad 2, follow me! From now on, we all will move and block the gates with the emergency iron fences!\u201d Steven shouted out loud. From now on, it was their chance to risk their lives and fulfill their roles.Before he left for the Southern Front, Roman was lost in thought.\u2018Do I need to take a risk for this country filled with unpatriotic people?\u2019According to the information he had collected, the Hector Kingdom was clearly sending signals of war on the Southern Front. Even the foreign Valhalla Empire had read those signals and warned Roman, but the Cairo Kingdom didn\u2019t even know what kind of situation they themselves were in. It was that much of a pathetic nation.In order for the history to not repeat, one needs to have a sober running government, but despite this nation being divided into 4 factions, not one could make the right decision.Roman could not even be called a person of Cairo. As he had lived his life as Baek Joong-hyuk, he didn\u2019t have to be loyal to Cairo.\u2018There are many ways to avoid the war. If I take the hand of Marquis Benedict, I can get exempted from military duty, and there is another way to take the side of Valhalla, which is already quite strong. In the end, war is a battle in which the powerless side has to make sacrifices. Now that my worth has been recognized in Cairo, I have gained the privilege of being a strong person.\u2019In the world of unknown things, dangers lurked everywhere.Nevertheless, Roman\u2019s troubles didn\u2019t last long.\u2018I cannot bow my head to avoid the danger in front of me or promise to take another\u2019s side.\u2019In his past life, there were many brothers above him in the beginning. And among those many brothers, some of them were literally quite great. Nevertheless, most of them couldn\u2019t escape the eldest son without any compromise.Honestly, most people said that it was fine to compromise once or twice. However, it was still a very important thing that showed one\u2019s will. If he didn\u2019t kneel in front of anyone, he understood he could stand firm until the end, but the moment he knelt the body even once, Roman knew that he would get used to the comfort of kneeling down.Marquis Benedict, the Valhalla Empire, the Kronos Empire, and even the Royal Family of Cairo\u2014All four factions which divided Cairo wanted Roman, but he didn\u2019t give any of them a definite answer. Instead of forming a relationship with them, Roman wanted to solve the problems in his reality with his own effort. In the first place, he knew it was poisonous to bow to someone while he had the purpose of reigning above all inside himself. Also, he wanted to stay as one of Dmitry until the end.\u2018I will leave for the Southern Front.\u2019He made his decision.The difficulties because of nobles? A small nation\u2019s reality. He didn\u2019t care about such conditions. The Heavenly Demon was born in a difficult situation, yet he rose to the top of the Demonic Sect and made everyone else kneel before him.Actually, his blood was boiling in ecstasy now. He had missed his life on the battlefield dearly. In the final years of his life, the never-ending peace and quiet didn\u2019t arouse much thirst from within him. And with those emotions, Roman rushed toward the enemy\u2019s camp.It was already a battle being fought without any hope. Through the completely open gates, the soldiers of Hector were rushing in, and Cairo\u2019s soldiers were busy being pushed back. The difference in power was too vast. As it was a situation in which only one of Hector\u2019s soldier was dealing with two to three of Cairo\u2019s soldiers, the area around the castle gate soon changed into one under the control of Hector. Everyone knew that the battle was already over.Nevertheless, unlike the soldiers who were trying to run away as far as they could, Roman was rushing toward the enemy and leaving them behind in the dust.Puak!Five enemies who rushed in toward him got their throats slashed. And Roman, who had their blood splatter on him, went into the gap created without even flinching. Obviously, it was a dangerous situation. Nevertheless, even when Hector\u2019s soldiers attacked from all directions seeing the enemy alone, not a single of their attacks touched Roman. He had literally blocked all of their attacks by himself.\u2018On the right side.\u2019Puak!Roman sensed the wind blowing from the spear being thrust. He then grabbed the spear and pulled his opponent toward him to cut off his head. And once he did that, he jumped straight ahead and attacked the other enemies in his vicinity.Crack!It was an astonishing sight. Obviously, he had raised his shield to block it, but all the soldiers behind it were killed because of the recoil from defending Roman\u2019s attack and bouncing back farther away.The enemies\u2019 counterattack didn\u2019t even touch a strand of Roman\u2019s hair. While he continued to advance, he either blocked, avoided, or attacked the enemies in the vicinity. And when they realized that their flow was slowly dying, all of Hector\u2019s soldiers decided to rush in and kill him somehow.When Roman killed 20 soldiers on their side, they acknowledged the opponent was a lot stronger than they thought. However, when 30, 40, and even 50 soldiers were slaughtered without leaving a scratch on Roman, their faces were dyed with terror.\u201cUhhh!\u201d\u201cS-Stop that man right now!\u201dIt was a complete mess. All because of one man, Hector\u2019s soldiers couldn\u2019t push in anymore. The soldiers who were courageous were now cold corpses, and yet, Roman was mercilessly killing every enemy he saw on the battlefield.It wasn\u2019t just Aura\u2014No, Roman wasn\u2019t even using Aura. He was currently showing the power that far surpassed any Aura. The Heavenly Demon, Baek Joong-hyuk, was someone who had learned to kill people without things like that. He was someone who had crushed his opponent\u2019s head with a stone and someone who would choose any method to win if needed.While moving from the bottom to the top of the Demonic Sect, he had experienced many things. And Baek Joong-hyuk, who had gained absolute power due to that, couldn\u2019t be stopped by such people. That was why, even though he was surrounded by enemies all around him and isolated from allies, he continued to slaughter his enemies. Just as a huge number of sheep could not subdue a single wolf, Roman continued to unilaterally slaughter his enemies.And that wasn\u2019t the end of it. Roman\u2019s soldiers were also different from normal soldiers. If one soldier of Hector was enough to take down three of Cairo\u2019s soldiers, then one of Roman\u2019s soldiers could take down 5 to 6 of them easily. The situation had thus changed. Although there were only 30 people in the reserve unit and it was quite small, the atmosphere of the entire battlefield had changed because of that small reserve unit.And Hector\u2019s commander was continuously watching the entire situation from far away.Baron McCleary was Hector\u2019s commander and in charge of the attack on the Fifth Defense Line. He was certain of victory when the gates broke down.\u201cTch tch,\u00a0pathetic bastards.\u201dIt was funny to him. Hector hadn\u2019t actually used much of its force yet. Only some of the troops of the entire army were sent to the Fifth Defense Line, and yet, Cairo couldn\u2019t withstand such a measly attack. Their stupid response of firing arrows, and the water-based weapons didn\u2019t work as well. Despite being a kingdom surrounded by war, it had shown a pathetic response.\u2018It is unexpected, but we might break through the Fifth Defense Line before anything else.\u2019The original plan didn\u2019t have anything to do with winning or losing here. They deduced that once they attacked, the sand castle that was called Cairo would just collapse on its own.Well, all Five Defense Lines had to be captured anyway. So, Baron McCleary didn\u2019t see anything wrong with the achievement of capturing the Fifth one first.\u201cAttack! Completely destroy the Fifth Defense Line!\u201dHe made the decision as this was a huge chance for him. He convinced himself that this Defense Line could be broken down soon. And it even worked out initially, but it was only until he saw a strange scene. The soldiers who were supposed to head further were somehow running back now.\u201cR-Run away!\u201d\u201cGet back!\u201d\u201cAck!\u201dThe soldiers of Hector could be seen running away from something. Baron McCleary was stunned when he saw the soldiers running away, scared, even though they were on the battlefield. He still couldn\u2019t understand what was happening.If there weren\u2019t a lot of Cairo\u2019s soldiers aiming for them, why were they running away?\u2018Just what is happening?\u2019The question arose within him.Just then, the soldiers ran away even further and he saw the figure of an enemy fighting the surrounding soldiers that were waiting for him in the space that opened up.\u201c\u2026!\u201dAnd that was an overwhelming sight for him. As soon as he saw them, he unilaterally slaughtered all surrounding Hector\u2019s soldiers. Just then, Baron McCleary made eye contact with him. His eyes were so terrifying that he involuntarily began to gasp for air. Also, the moment they had made eye contact, that man suddenly began to run toward Baron McCleary.Even more blood sprayed, and even more heads flew off. Still, he didn\u2019t stop running toward him. In the short time Baron McCleary closed his eyes and opened them, that man had almost reached where he was.\u2018He wants to kill me?\u2019No, it can\u2019t be.It was impossible for Baron McCleary to believe something like that with his common sense.\u201cKill him before he gets any closer!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAnd when the knights of Hector went forward, Baron McCleary believed he was safe.Editor\u2019s Thoughts: Chris, Kevin, and the other soldiers are finally here! More slaughter from Roman\u2019s side is coming soon. Also, just what level are the knights of Hector at? 3-Star? 4-Star? Even if they have a 5-Star Aura Knight, I doubt they can defeat Roman lol.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84 - An Unforeseen Disaster (5)The distance between the gate and Baron McCleary was quite far. It was common sense not to pass through the front that was filled with enemies, but Roman had different thoughts.\u2018The enemy commander is careless.\u2019Was it because Cairo was considered weak by him? Baron McCleary had actually stepped ahead out in the open to observe the situation. Of course, it could be said by others that he was still at a safe distance, but he wasn\u2019t as far that he wouldn\u2019t be untouched by Roman. Thus, Roman changed his plan instantly. Initially, he was only going to secure the space that was around the gate until Steven and his soldiers installed the emergency iron fence, but he now ran ahead the moment he made eye contact with Baron McCleary.\u2018I will kill the commander.\u2019That is the best way to end this battle quickly.He had experienced in numerous battlefields that the moment the commander\u2019s head falls down, the enemies fall down as well.\u201cStop him!\u201d\u201cThe enemy is alone!\u201dThe soldiers of Hector were furious. When they saw Roman, who dared to come here by himself, they all attacked him at once. However, the scene of him exchanging blows with numerous at once took their breath away. The weapons flying in from all directions were all aiming for his life. However, not a single attack worked on Roman.Tatang!All the weapons bounced back once the attacks were blocked. Still, that wasn\u2019t the end. The soldiers who had attempted to attack him also fell down while screaming their lungs out as their limbs were cut off.There were literally hundreds of enemies. Thus, it was common sense for them to have the advantage and for Roman to fall down, but as time passed, only the damage on their own side increased.\u201cGet out of the way!\u201d\u201cStop running around!\u2019Once the knights of Hector received the orders from Baron McCleary, they instantly rushed ahead. Obviously, they weren\u2019t just ordinary knights. All of them were Aura Swordsmen who could manifest different types of Auras on their swords.Srrng!The Aura that enveloped the sword seemed to explode. And as they all had attacked at the same time, Hector\u2019s soldiers breathed in relief that Roman would finally go down now.\u2018Heavenly Demon Sword Art; Second Move.\u2019With a single breath, mana swelled within Roman, and an Aura erupted toward the enemies who were running fiercely toward him. And because of a single hit from the Heavenly Demon Sword Art, the knights of Hector, who were confident of their victory, perished without even knowing what had happened.Kwakwakwang!That was how shocking the power was. The Auras the knights had manifested scattered around as if they were pieces of paper in a tornado, and their bodies, which had to be as strong as armor made of steel, were shredded into a million pieces.Everyone was blown away. That was the moment they all realized that the existence they were dealing with was a monster they couldn\u2019t even touch the toes of. They all understood Roman had come into the enemy camp despite seeing so many enemies because he knew he wouldn\u2019t have a problem even if he fought all of them at once.In Roman Dmitry\u2019s life\u2014No, in Baek Joong-hyuk\u2019s life, battles in which he was outnumbered were common. Even when he was against the masters of Murim, he was at a numerical disadvantage.He understood that Steven meant not to overdo it. However, now that the enemy commander was in his range, he decided to end the battle at once.Tak!He kicked the ground, and suddenly, he was before Baron McCleary, who was utterly shocked. It was natural. Dozens of soldiers of Hector were just slaughtered in front of him, and even Hector\u2019s Aura Knights, some of the best soldiers on their side, were torn apart with just one move. The plan that Hector had devised was now shattered as well, and Roman Dmitry was so strong that he couldn\u2019t calculate how to stop him.His eyes trembled. His head was telling him to run away as fast as he could, but at that moment, he remembered the command he had heard before he came here and announced war to Cairo\u2019s soldiers.\u2018There is no need to force things forward and capture the Fifth Defense Line. The only thing you must do is buy as much time as possible. We need plenty of time for our plans to succeed.\u2019\u201cFuck.\u201dWithin one hour of declaring the war, a huge variable had already appeared that would hinder Hector\u2019s goal.Baron McCleary drew his sword. He was a swordsman as well. And as he knew how to use 2-Star Aura, he planned to do his best.\u201cI am Baron McCleary of Hector! I will\u2014\u201dSlash!Puak!It was a single slash. Nevertheless, it was so fast that the moment Roman had arrived in front of him, in an instant, the head of Baron McCleary had flown into the air, and blood started to gush down his body like a fountain.His judgment was too arrogant. As Hector\u2019s Knights themselves couldn\u2019t handle Roman Dmitry, he should have just run away.Nevertheless, after the death of the commander, Roman grabbed his head and raised it high into the sky. Then, he shouted with a voice filled with mana, \u201cThe enemy commander is dead!\u201dAt that moment, as if everything that was happening on the battlefield never actually happened, everyone who was on the battlefield stopped acting.The atmosphere was ice-cold now. Hector\u2019s soldiers didn\u2019t understand what they should do. They had enough power to fight despite their commander\u2019s death. Still, the situation was too confusing. And it was Roman Dmitry who broke the silence.Slash!\u201cKuak!\u201dHe had done so by slashing the enemy in front of him. It was beyond common sense. Usually, once the enemy commander was killed, the enemy soldiers were forced to surrender. Actually, it might have even been the case if the opponent was the Barco family. Roman had ended the situation back then by killing the head of the Barco family and his son. Nevertheless, it was different this time. Hector had attacked Cairo without any warning. Not only was this a war without a cause, but the other Defense Lines were still under attack, even while they were here on the Fifth Defense Line.Roman raised his voice and said, \u201cSoldiers of Cairo, listen clearly! We cannot afford to secure war prisoners now. Even now, the other Defense Lines are under attack by the Hector Kingdom. If we let them live, they will definitely come back and initiate another war for revenge. Even if it means we need to shed blood now, risk your lives and execute the enemies!\u201dThe war with Barco could be said to be a personal fight based on \u201cLet your opponent cut your flesh in order to break his bone.\u201d And since it was a fight within the same kingdom, if the commander was taken care of and the soldiers surrendered, most likely, they wouldn\u2019t come back to fight for revenge. However, they were now dealing with the soldiers of Hector. Even if their commander had died, they still belonged to the Hector Kingdom and hence would fight until the end.And honestly, surrender wasn\u2019t even allowed in wars between nations. Thus, even if their arms were ripped off, it was absolutely necessary to deal with the enemies now that they had gained momentum. Being on the opposite side was enough reason to be cruel in war.And when the soldiers of Cairo saw Roman continuing to slaughter his enemies without showing the slightest mercy, all of the soldiers cheered, \u201cFollow Roman Dmitry!\u201d\u201cKill all the remnants of Hector!\u201dThey blocked the exit. Hector\u2019s soldiers were now cornered. Finally, they understood that they couldn\u2019t get out of here alive.By the time Henry Albert arrived, the tide of war had already turned. When he heard the report, it was clearly stated that the Fifth Defense Line was on the verge of collapsing, but the scene in front of him was different from that.\u201c\u2026T-This is!\u201dOutside the fortress, a one-sided massacre was going on. Cairo\u2019s soldiers, who were taking advantage of the current situation, attacked the enemy with faces that made them look like they were possessed by devils.How did this happen?He couldn\u2019t understand it at all. Nevertheless, he became certain of one thing\u2014Roman Dmitry\u2019s presence stands out even in fierce battles.\u2018This is how powerful Roman Dmitry is.\u2019He truly had an overwhelming presence. Hector\u2019s soldiers, who were cornered, tried to rush in without any fear, but the moment they got close to Roman, they died without even being able to swing their swords. Their numerical advantage felt literally meaningless. No matter how much they rushed in, they only died.Henry had seen Rankers fight before. Even then, he thought that Rankers were people on a whole different level. Nevertheless, those he had seen glorified now seemed like trash in front of Roman Dmitry. When he had heard that Roman was someone who had defeated Homer at the age of 25, he thought he must have some weakness, but now that he saw him fighting with his own eyes, he realized that the rumors didn\u2019t even do justice to how strong he truly was.Also, Roman\u2019s soldiers couldn\u2019t be said to be weak as well. In particular, Chris, Kevin, and Pooky showed power that a normal soldier could never have. Now he understood why they were different from the news. It was due to the variable known as Roman Dmitry.\u2019\u2026I can finally see why uncle told me to get on the good side of Roman Dmitry.\u2019He gulped, knowing his uncle was right. Him being born as a commoner didn\u2019t matter. He became certain that Roman Dmitry was a monster who would devour the entire Cairo Kingdom one day.Henry shouted at the soldiers behind him, \u201cHelp Roman Dmitry right now! Do not let the bastards of Hector run away! And make sure to stay next to Roman!\u201dHenry finished giving his orders. Then, he began to follow his soldiers right from the very back.Finally, all things on the Fifth Defense Line were sorted out. Hector\u2019s soldiers didn\u2019t fight to the end. When the fear of annihilation engulfed them, some of them abandoned their colleagues to run away. Obviously, most of them died while running away. Roman followed most of them to the very end and killed every single one he could see. Still, there was no way for him to kill so many enemies who were running in different directions at the same time.And when the battle ended, Chris ran toward Roman.\u201cChris and 30 others. No fatalities.\u201dIt was a fierce battle, yet no one had died. Still, that didn\u2019t mean everyone was safe. Everyone basically had at least one wound, but Roman could also see those who had blood dripping and red flesh through the armor. Still, no one groaned even a single time when moving. Henderson, in particular, was unfamiliar with large-scale battles, but he kept his mouth shut despite being soaked in sweat.\u201cYou all did a good job. Use potions to heal the wounds.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThere were no special thanks. Nevertheless, this alone was enough.And Steven, who was close by, couldn\u2019t help but be shocked.\u2019\u2026He\u2019s giving potions to soldiers?!\u2019Healing potions were produced in Magic Towers and costed an enormous sum of money even when they were bought in the least quantity. However, Roman had casually told his soldiers to use such expensive things. At first glance, he could see that they were at least intermediate or high-level potions, but the soldiers still poured the entire vials onto their wounds.Chik!Along with a burning smell, the wounds healed quickly.Now Steven finally seemed to understand why the soldiers followed Roman Dmitry so blindly.\u2018He has overwhelming strength, a daring judgment, and he is not a cheapskate to his men. The trust between Roman Dmitry and his soldiers isn\u2019t something that was formed just now. Because he has such a character, even if he jumps into the pit of fire, they would follow him down.\u2019His admiration was brief. It was because, soon, Roman turned toward him and said, \u201cYou must gather the soldiers and prepare for a second attack. And I need to see soldiers who know the terrain of the Southern Front.\u201d\u201c\u2026You want to leave right now?\u201d\u201cThe war hasn\u2019t ended just yet. Even now, while we have found a little peace, the soldiers of Cairo are dying elsewhere.\u201dThe war had just started, and this was only a single victory. It didn\u2019t mean they had won the war.Roman looked at him with fierce eyes, \u201cI have no intention of watching the Hector Kingdom trample this land. Until I have killed all the soldiers of the Hector Kingdom who have stepped into our land, I will not stop.\u201dHe was stunned the moment he heard those words. Obviously, Cairo was at a disadvantage right now. Because of the surprise attack from Hector, the Cairo Kingdom had already lost the momentum in the war. Nevertheless, for some reason, Steven felt the man who was standing in front of him could truly make something out of the current situation.Roman shouted to his soldiers, \u201cI will give you 10 minutes. Make sure you are fully prepared to move.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dRoman\u2019s soldiers were ready to follow his orders.Therefore, only 2 hours after the war had started, the Fifth Defense Line was doing well in its defense. And that was the first variable the Hector Kingdom hadn\u2019t expected. And it was also the starting point for another variable.Editor\u2019s Thoughts: This was such an awesome chapter! So, the knights weren\u2019t able to do anything much to Roman lol. Also, the action scenes were well done. Roman giving high-level potions to his soldiers is so sweet though! And it seems Roman will go and start another slaughter soon enough.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 - The Second Variable (1)Steven called for a soldier.\u201cHe is a native of this area. He has a perfect grasp of the surrounding terrain and will be a useful guide.\u201d\u201cI am Kobe.\u201dThe soldier that had just arrived had a dark face. Roman accepted his greeting and moved to the commander\u2019s room. He then spread open the map on the table.Swish.\u201cThis is the map of the Southern Front. What is the fastest way to get to the rear of the Southern Front?\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you seriously asking about the way to the rear of the Southern Front?\u201dKobe\u2019s eyes widened. Steven had told him that Roman needed his help in order to go and help the other Defense Lines. Thus, he assumed Roman would ask him about the fastest way to the other Defense Lines. However, as he asked about the fastest way to the rear, he was stunned.There was no need to explain why. Still, for active cooperation, Roman said his thoughts out loud.\u201cI do not think the Defense Lines on the Southern Front can hold on any longer. Even if we move fast, one place is bound to collapse, and enemies will break through. Thus, there is a high probability that we will be isolated in such a situation. That\u2019s why I want to go to the rear of the Southern Front first. We will understand the situation of the Defense Lines and respond with flexibility after joining the forces in the rear.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah!\u201dKobe then realized that it was quite a sensible decision. As Roman had said, with a small number of troops, he could not tackle all the threats on the Southern Front. Finally, Kobe\u2019s gaze turned toward the map. He said, pointing to a path, once he had searched for the fastest way to reach the rear.\u201cI think moving on this path will be good. If we follow this road, we can get there in around 3 hours.\u201dIt was one of the many paths to the rear. Still, it was the safest way to travel there.Nevertheless, Roman shook his head.\u201cNo. We cannot take the safe path now. What we lack is time, and in order to shorten the time, we need to move fast, even if there is the risk of falling off of steep slopes.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 then how about this road?\u201dIt was one near a mountain. The terrain was much rougher than the one he had suggested first, and even though they needed to go up a slope, they could get across the mountain quickly. If the first one took 3 hours, then this one would take around 2 hours and 30 minutes. He thought it was good enough, but Roman didn\u2019t seem that happy with it.\u201cFrom what I know, it takes about 2 hours and 30 minutes for an average person to go through this road. That isn\u2019t enough as well. My soldiers have the ability to maintain their speed in any terrain. And considering our level, we need a path that can get us there within 2 hours.\u201dAt that moment, Kobe felt something strange.\u2019\u2026Huh?\u2019His two questions were answered with two diligent and informative answers. When he noticed Roman\u2019s ability to grasp the road, he only looked at him with a stunned expression.The first method was one that anyone, including those not originally from the Southern Front, could understand. When considering Roman\u2019s perspective, it was reasonable asking for a quicker path because it was obvious from the map that the area was flat. Nevertheless, that wasn\u2019t the case with the second one.\u2018How does he know that the path behind the mountain takes 2 hours and 30 minutes? It cannot be a simple prediction. Obviously, he spoke with confidence, so he must have calculated it. And as it is like that, it means that he is someone who understands the terrain of the Southern Front to some extent. Then why did he choose me as a guide?\u2019He wondered about that. He wanted to know just what Roman was thinking.\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t know you knew the way around so well.\u201dHe asked a question indirectly. He didn\u2019t know why he had been called when Roman knew about the terrain that well. And Roman responded to his slightly provoking words while looking at the map.\u201cWhen I was assigned to the Southern Front, I decided to research this place for a while. How will the place I will live in for 2 years be? Just what is the terrain like? I studied it a lot in case something happened but obviously, I couldn\u2019t fully understand the place. Still, I, at least, know what any other person who can read a map knows.\u201dThe information Valhalla had given made Roman order Lucas to investigate the Southern Front. It didn\u2019t mean he only had to check for signs of war. While he prepared for the war, he also had Lucas check the current situation on the Southern Front many times and even mark the routes that led to each Defense Line.When the Fifth Defense Line was attacked, Roman arrived on the battlefield in less than an hour. Obviously, people thought he had reached here by sprinting as fast as he could, but the truth was that he had used the shortcut he knew of.Also, Roman had gotten more information thanks to McBurney. It was similar to the one Lucas had given him, but a bit more detailed. And thanks to that, he now knew the local and unknown routes of the Southern Front as well.Kobe couldn\u2019t understand Roman\u2019s answer that well. If he had got this far from all that, then why did he need Kobe?\u201cWhen Steven called you, you probably thought I was just an ignorant man on the Southern Front.\u201d\u201cN-No.\u201d\u201cThere is no need to be this shocked. I only used common sense. The reason I told Mr. Steven that I needed someone familiar with the land was because the information one gets through papers and books is different from reality. The information I checked said the route takes 2 hours and 30 minutes. But what if there is bad weather or something else which happens on the path? Then we will have to take a detour which we have no idea about. That is why I need your help. I thought that information in the books was right, but the natives always have a way on a terrain compared to a person who just came. Is that enough reason?\u201d\u201cHuh?! I-I fully understand!\u201dKobe stuttered. It felt like, somehow, Roman had read his thoughts.Roman understood what Kobe was asking, and he hoped to clarify all his doubts as soon as he could.Roman looked different to him. In the entire time he had served here, many nobles had come to the Southern Front, but he had met someone like Roman for the first time today.\u2018He is different from the nobles who come to live a life comfortable here. He is even ready to go to the war. Even if no one else will get to know about it, if I can help him carry out his will, there will be hope for the Southern Front.\u2019Kobe looked at the map with such thoughts and then pointed to a new path.\u201cI can assure you that this route is the best option if you are truly confident in rushing in and not caring about the terrain. It is a path my village friends and I have secretly traveled since we were children. If we travel through the thick forest, we can reach the rear of the Southern Front in just 2 hours. Nevertheless, we need to be careful. Even a little stumbling can lead us to fall off a huge cliff.\u201dThis\u2014This was the type of answer Roman had been waiting for. Thus, that answer also signaled the end of the meeting.The meeting didn\u2019t take too long. Actually, it took only 10 minutes.And when Roman left the room, the first thing he was greeted with was his soldiers. They had already finished their preparations and lined up sincerely.\u201cChris and 30 others. All the preparations have been completed.\u201dIt was a sharp blade-like reaction.However, next to his soldiers, he saw an unwelcome face.\u201cHenry Albert and 50 others. All preparations have been completed.\u201dThat was Henry. He had looked at Chris and imitated what he was doing. Naturally, there was a huge difference in the aura they gave out, but Henry tried to be as serious as he could.Roman asked, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t accept the presence of someone like Henry. Obviously, it was good to have many troops in a situation where time was running out, but Henry\u2019s group would only slow them down. Besides, there was no need to fight alongside Henry Albert, who was like a spoiled child since their first meeting.Henry himself knew about it, but he couldn\u2019t speak the truth.\u2018If I tell him that I am mainly here because I was tasked to become a friend of the person who is called Dmitry\u2019s Future, he will tell me to get the fuck out.\u2019Henry couldn\u2019t show his sincerity and only had a stiff expression. What he needed to do now was act his role.\u201cFirst of all, I want to apologize for the mistakes I had made before. The reason I am here and want to follow Mr. Roman is because I, too, am a citizen of Cairo. The Hector Kingdom has declared war on the entirety of Cairo. In a situation where innocent people are dying, I thought I should add my forces as a noble of Cairo. Just give me the orders, and I will risk my life to do my best to help.\u201d He spoke aloud. It was like noblesse oblige. He proudly puffed his chest.Nevertheless, Roman knew that Henry Albert wasn\u2019t someone who would move without an objective, so he said, \u201cYou have the freedom to follow me if you want to. Nevertheless, I will not give you any orders. It is up to you to do what you want. Still, let me tell you this one thing in advance\u2014If you ever get in the way of my plan, then I will shatter the shackles that hold me down mercilessly and move on without a care in the world.\u201dIt was a terrifying warning. And as soon as he finished his words, Roman turned.\u201cChris.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dFinally, it was time for him and his soldiers to head out once again.Even though Roman had given him a warning, Henry followed him. Nevertheless, he was quickly left behind in the dust, and Roman and his soldiers moved out of his sight. When Henry and his soldiers couldn\u2019t catch up with Roman on flat ground, how could they catch up while on a steeply inclined land?There was no need to talk when moving. Roman and Kobe were in the lead, and everyone was moving according to the guidance of Kobe.Schhh.They even had to go through overgrown bushes. Truly, it was not a path anyone usually went through. And even they themselves wouldn\u2019t have gotten to know about it without Kobe.How far did they go?Suddenly, they heard a strange noise.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dAs soon as he heard the groan of a human, Roman stopped the soldiers. They had heard it from a certain distance away, but he deemed it necessary to confirm the identity of the person before going to the main destination.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cA soldier of the Southern Training Center?\u201dRoman\u2019s soldiers recognized him at once. He was one of the soldiers under McBurney and had also controlled the intense training of the soldiers.Nevertheless, the condition of the soldier looked pitiful. His clothes were stained with blood as if he had been attacked, and his face was so pale that he was going to die any moment now.Roman ran forward quickly. After checking the condition of the soldier, he performed simple first-aid and used the healing potions on the serious wounds first. However, that didn\u2019t help that much. It was too late.Seeing him in his last moments, Roman asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201dThe soldier looked at Roman with hazy eyes. However, the focus in his eyes returned quickly when he saw the one in front of him. He recognized that it was Roman who was in front of him. Soon, he spoke desperately, \u201cT\u2026The Southern Training Center\u2026 was attacked. P\u2026please help them. Please\u2026!\u201dAs soon as he finished those words, his body went limp. It seemed that once he had uttered his last words, albeit with difficulty, he was able to accept his death.\u2018The Southern Training Center was attacked?\u2019This was quite unexpected. The Training Center was closer to the rear of the Southern Front than the Defense Lines. And such a place was attacked? Even before Roman had left for the Fifth Defense Line, he hadn\u2019t heard anything like that.\u2018The soldier of the Training Center was able to escape to here. That means the Training Center must have been attacked around 30 minutes ago.\u2019This implied that the effectiveness of the Defense Lines had no bearing on the outcome.\u2018The Hector Kingdom attacked all the five Defense Lines at the same time, and at the same time, they also sent another unit that was prepared to clear out any variables from the outside.\u2019Why the hell was such an operation carried out? It didn\u2019t seem to make any sense, and Roman couldn\u2019t guess what Hector was trying to achieve without more information. At that moment, Roman could only think of one thing.\u2019\u2026The Southern Front may not have as much time left as I had anticipated.\u2019It was clear that the Hector Kingdom hadn\u2019t attacked Cairo blindly. They had decided to attack today after preparing thoroughly.Roman got up.\u201cWe will head to the Southern Training Center now.\u201d\u201cWe understand.\u201dNow, helping the Southern Training Center was the utmost priority.Editor\u2019s Thoughts: Roman\u2019s actions are just something else. Also, RIP that soldier. Although he couldn\u2019t defend the Training Center, Roman is heading there now. He did a good job. It seems the true intentions of Hector will also be revealed soon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86 - The Second Variable (2)Supporting himself with his back on the wall of a building at the Southern Training Center, there was McBurney, who was exhaling harshly.\u201cHuff\u2026 Huff\u2026\u201dHis condition looked dire. The armor made of chains that had been tightly woven had already torn off his body. With his bare skin revealing, blood continued to flow down from the slash on his abdomen. Fortunately, his intestines hadn\u2019t fallen out yet.Ordinary people would have covered the abdomen with one hand, but McBurney couldn\u2019t do it as his sole arm was aiming a sword at his enemies.\u201cHe will die if we leave him alone.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you give up? We will give you a painless death.\u201dHector\u2019s soldiers were asking such questions while giggling. There were three of them. They steadily advanced, encircling McBurney, and pointed their weapons at him.Naturally, the situation turned McBurney\u2019s throat dry. His vision was already turning blurry, and he even had to bite off his own flesh in his mouth to stay focused.Tch.\u201cFuck it, you bastards.\u201dHe could taste the bitterness in his mouth. The situation was so bad that his blood was acting like water as it quenched his thirst.\u201cI will risk my life to kill whichever bastard dares to attack first. So, step forward if you are ready to sacrifice your life for your comrades. Dare to risk your life and attack. Even if I have to bite your neck to take you down, I will do it,\u201d growled McBurney. His eyes looked like those full of poison.Naturally, when they saw McBurney\u2019s unflinching appearance, Hector\u2019s soldiers couldn\u2019t even attack. This wasn\u2019t just a baseless threat. The soldier who had earlier tried to attack McBurney, thinking he was easy to deal with, was now a cold corpse on the floor.\u2018Damn it.\u2019McBurney cursed inwardly. He had tried to not show it as much as possible, but now, he was in the worst physical condition he had ever been. It was so bad that it wouldn\u2019t be strange if he collapsed down at any given moment. He was only holding his body up by leaning on the wall behind him, and as Hector\u2019s soldiers seemed to have noticed that, they were just passing the time safely.\u2018If only my right arm was still there, I could have killed them.\u2019When he was forced to face the harsh reality of having lost an arm once again, he contemplated his own helplessness. Back when he was fighting on the Western Front, he could easily deal with 2 to 3 enemies at once. It wasn\u2019t because he had learned a systematic and amazing technique previously. He had created his own sword technique based on his countless fights on the battlefield, and dozens of Kronos\u2019 soldiers had died due to his aggressive sword technique, which exceeded their expectations.However, it was different now. His left arm wasn\u2019t moving all that well, and he couldn\u2019t even kill a few people now. He truly was in a mess.This was the end. This was going to be where he would die. McBurney accepted he was going to die soon, so he wanted to take down at least one more person down with him.\u2018What happened to Roman Dmitry?\u2019Suddenly, the face of a person who had impressed him came to his mind. Roman Dmitry was the first person he had met at the Southern Training Center who was truly a noble, and unlike the others, he had prepared for war. He could be said to be the only person who hadn\u2019t let go of his tension and attention even though he had come to the Southern Front. Although he heard that he was assigned to the Fifth Defense Line, he thought maybe Roman Dmitry would have done something. And he wondered what he was doing now. Roman wasn\u2019t his family and wasn\u2019t even his friend, but oddly enough, McBurney was thinking of him during his final moments.\u2018That means that I still feel regrets about the battlefield.\u2019Clench.He gripped the sword tightly, lowered his body, and ran forward. Even though blood was dripping down from his stomach, his eyes were only searching for the weakness of his opponent.Just then,Kwang!\u201cKuak!\u201d\u201cAttack!\u201dHe heard a loud noise from outside the building.Roman was one step late. The Southern Training Center was already in ruins when he and his soldiers arrived, and the bodies of soldiers were scattered everywhere. It was a gruesome sight. However, he could still hear some noises around him. As soon as he judged that not all of the enemies had escaped, he ordered his men, \u201cClear out the remaining enemies right now and rescue the survivors.\u201d\u201cWe understand.\u201dThe soldiers, including Chris, spread around.Roman looked around carefully. As the soldier had said, the Southern Training Center was attacked. Among the corpses lying all around, there were soldiers of the Hector Kingdom who were only wearing light leather armor. That was for fast movements. Nevertheless, that was only a small portion. Most of the corpses were of the soldiers of Cairo. Just by looking at the corpses, he could tell that their surprise attack had paid off well.Roman expanded his senses and listened to the sounds around him.\u2019\u2026McBurney?\u2019Among the many sounds, he heard a familiar one. It was the sound of McBurney fighting with someone, and from the sound of his panting voice, it looked like he was in a dangerous situation.Roman immediately moved to the building that was not too far away. And as he opened the door of the expected place, he saw it.\u201cW-What?\u201d\u201cDid Cairo already send in reinforcements?\u201dHector\u2019s soldiers were bewildered. According to their calculations, no reinforcements should have been able to arrive here in such a short time. As the Defense Lines were attacked, it made no sense for Cairo to send reinforcements to a place like this so quickly. Then who the hell was this person in front of them?As Hector\u2019s soldiers pointed their weapons with hostility toward him, Roman took turns looking at them and McBurney to understand the current situation.\u2018He is still alive.\u2019McBurney was a survivor.Although his face looked like he would die at any given moment, he was still standing on his two legs.Naturally, in such a situation, McBurney was shocked.Roman went forward and approached the enemies soon enough.\u2018Capturing them will be the best course of action.\u2019He made his judgment. And although Hector\u2019s soldiers shouted not to get any closer, Roman arrived in front of them in an instant. Then,Smash!His fist struck the soldier in the face. His eyes lost focus as blood splattered, and Roman wiped the blood off his hand. He didn\u2019t care about the other soldiers\u2019 reactions as they wouldn\u2019t be able to do much anyway. One of Hector\u2019s soldiers was furious and tried to attack, but Roman let his attack come forward and subdued him similarly after dodging it.Puak!With the punch came blood, again. It was a situation that had happened too quickly. They were obviously veteran soldiers, but in such a short time, two of them were already unconscious. The last one tried to run away. While his two colleagues confronted Roman, but only to get hit and drop down, he ran away in the opposite direction. However, that was when an unexpected person grabbed his throat.Clench!\u201cKuak!\u201d\u201cI did warn you that I would take one of you down with me.\u201dIt was McBurney. He was quick-witted. As soon as he understood that Roman was trying to capture him, he went ahead and strangled his opponent instead of slashing him and ending his life. Since he had only one arm, the resistance from the other person was quite strong. Yet, McBurney clenched his teeth and strangled the opponent till the end, and Hector\u2019s soldier passed out.Thud!\u201cHuff\u2026 Huff\u2026\u201dMcBurney, too, lay down flat on the floor. He was at his limit. His mind was already hazy, and he felt an unknown feeling rise up to his throat.Soon, Roman came into his vision.\u201cGood job. From now on, you can rest and leave the other things to me.\u201dDrip.Roman sprinkled the healing potion onto the body of McBurney, who didn\u2019t even have the energy to utter thank you left. When he sensed the energy of the potion spreading throughout his body, McBurney let go of his consciousness.Things were finally sorted out. After checking the entire Training Center, Chris reported to Roman.\u201cThere weren\u2019t many soldiers of the Hector Kingdom left. There were 12 who were found and dealt with, and 5 survivors of our side were saved along with that. Also, according to their testimony, Viscount Bale was wounded while fighting the soldiers of the Hector Kingdom and fled to the mountains.\u201dIt was surprising. Viscount Bale, like Baron Bruce, would have thought of running away immediately, but he displayed to others that he fought for a while. Still, that was all. The result didn\u2019t change. Most of the soldiers who died here met that result because of their negligence of not training, and that was why less than 10 soldiers survived.\u2018The main force of Hector Kingdom attacked the Training Center and then left. According to the survivors, the number of enemies was around one hundred. There must be a reason why they are using this \u201cHit West and Win East\u201d strategy.\u2019With this, he became more sure of that one possibility. The purpose of the enemy was exposed to some extent, but he still couldn\u2019t make any hasty judgments. That was because many lives depended on each one of his judgments. And as he knew the weight of words, Roman decided not to say it.\u201cWhat about the soldiers of Hector?\u201d\u201cAll locked up in one building.\u201dThere was only one way to find out the truth.Roman stepped forward.\u201cChirs, from now on, do not let anyone enter the building until I give an order.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAnd like that,Creak.Thud!The door to the building which Roman had gone into closed.Inside the building, there were the captured soldiers.And as soon as Roman went in, one of the men with distorted faces yelled, \u201cDo not let me live! Kill me! I have no intention of saying anything to the cowards of Cairo.\u201dHe was salivating hard, but Roman didn\u2019t care. He neither responded nor cared for his words.Nevertheless, he told them his plans with a cold voice, \u201cFrom now on, I will give 3 minutes per person. I don\u2019t have much time, so I cannot allow more than that. The rules will be simple. Answer what I ask, and if I get the answer that I am looking for within those 3 minutes, I will give you a painless death. However, excruciating pain will be the only thing awaiting you in the other case.\u201d\u201cYou bastard!\u201d\u201cK-Kill me! Kill me!\u201dThe soldiers yelled, but Roman only went toward one of them and said, \u201cThe first question. What is the purpose of the Hector Kingdom?\u201d\u201cFuck you!\u201dHe stayed tightlipped. The troops that Hector had used for this war were those who had loyalty to the nation. Naturally, they showed their resolve to never speak, even in the face of death.Time passed quickly. And once the given time was over, Roman sentenced him to death.\u201c3 minutes are over.\u201dTuk!He pressed a blood point. The soldier didn\u2019t understand what it meant back then, but soon, his eyes opened so wide that it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say they would burst out as he felt the muscles twist within his body.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201d\u201cI warned you clearly. The muscles and bones in your body will twist and cause pain, and you will only die slowly. You are the ones who have attacked the Cairo Kingdom, and I have no intention of showing mercy to my enemies. The only exception will be shown to those who will cooperate with me.\u201dAll the soldiers became stiff when they saw the incident in front of them. The one who was screaming was one of the strongest colleagues here. Yet, he was screaming as if someone was tearing the skin away from his body.\u201cThe second question. Why are you guys here at the Southern Training Center?\u201dAll the soldiers gulped at the question that came from one who seemed to be the God of Death in their eyes right now. In their heart, they all wanted to cry out that they would surrender. However, that was no longer an option when they remembered the oath they had taken.Finally,\u201c3 minutes are over.\u201d\u201cAhhhhhhhh!\u201dThe other one fell into despair as well.Now, only one was left. As Roman approached, the third one groaned despite not being asked anything.\u201cDo you think this will change the outcome? Cairo is already finished. Even if you hear the plan from my mouth, it isn\u2019t something that you can stop anymore! So, do what you want! The Cairo Kingdom will pay the price for their negligence, and this will leave a shameful name in your nation\u2019s history! Hahaha!\u201dHe laughed maniacally. It was mainly to hide his fear. However, Roman only looked at him and smiled at that moment.\u201cI was waiting for that answer.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cI knew the truth right from the start. I just needed to see how you would react. Seeing that you are so confident, then I can come to one sure possibility.\u201dThe soldier was utterly confused. Nevertheless, Roman dropped a bomb on him.\u201cThe rear of the Southern Front. Your true purpose lies there.\u201dSeeing the soldier lose his composure as soon as he heard those words was all Roman needed. He wasn\u2019t sure of the answer, but the reaction made him sure.\u201cYou can die now.\u201dTuk!He pressed his blood point.Leaving behind even the last one screaming in pain, Roman left the building.\u201cThe attacks on the Defense Lines of the Southern Front were nothing more than diversions. Their true purpose lies elsewhere. If Hector succeeds in that, they will capture the entire Southern Front.\u201dHis blood went cold. He was now sure that the Southern Front was in far more danger than he had originally thought.The plan that the Hector Kingdom had thought to be almost perfect was only perfect until before the second variable they had never thought of had emerged.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 - The Star Of Hector (1)A group established a camp in the vicinity of the border between Cairo and Hector. It was a secret base that no one could see from outside, and hundreds were residing there.\u201cWe just got the report that they passed through the Southern Training Center and are heading towards the rear. The plan seems to have worked. The Cairo Kingdom is completely unaware of our strategy and is focused on blocking the attacks on the Defense Lines.\u201dIt was a report.And the man who received the report while staying calm, Edwin Hector, looked at the map spread out on the table.\u201cIt is too early to be careless. Tell the commanders attacking the Defense Lines of Cairo to take more time and not rush it. The important thing for us is not to destroy the wall right in front of us. If the plan works, the entire Southern Front will fall into our hands soon.\u201dIn this operation, they had to be absolutely secure to stay alive and succeed. That was why they took an entire year to figure out the boundary and patterns of the Southern Front, and even before they had begun the operation, they had sent a Ranger Unit led by Jackson to infiltrate the Southern Front.It was a dangerous route as they had to go up a steep mountain, but this morning, Jackson reported that he had arrived at the designated spot and hid himself well.The actual operation would begin now. They had successfully hidden their true intentions behind the surprise attack, which had made the Cairo Kingdom stunned.\u2018The power of the Southern Front is weak. If we had attacked with all our forces, it would have fallen down in just 4 hours. However, that alone does not mean that we would have completely captured the Southern Front. After all, what matters the most on the Southern Front is the existence of Warp Gate. If Cairo\u2019s main forces are transferred to the Southern Front through there, the fight will become extremely difficult.\u2019No matter how negligent the Cairo Kingdom was, it wasn\u2019t that they had completely given up their attention on the Southern Front. The Warp Gate was a magic artifact. It helped to move long distances at once, and the existence of the Warp Gate was enough to turn the tides of war. Because of the Warp Gate, the troops on the Western Front could be moved to the Southern Front and vice-versa in an instant. It was something that was physically impossible, but the Warp Gate could make it possible. Therefore, occupying the Warp Gate on the Southern Front was the highest priority. The main intention was to cut off the possibility of enemy reinforcements arriving instantly, but it could also be used aggressively if Hector could manage to use it after they captured it.Connect\u2014That was a method through which the coordinates of a Warp Gate could be reset, and instead, it could be used for the ones who captured it to bring more forces and supplies. Thus, a Warp Gate was usually equipped with an explosive device.And the rear of the Southern Front of Cairo had a Warp Gate. That was the reason why Roman and his troops were able to reach the Southern Front in ten days, and Cairo had the Warp Gate in the rear so that they could handle any emergencies. It was believed that the rear was a safe place, even if enemies attacked the Southern Front, as the Warp Gate could be used to summon allies or destroy the enemies while they were trying to capture it.And that was Edwin\u2019s target.\u2018The Cairo Kingdom is completely careless as of now. They didn\u2019t even think that we would attack them at least once, and now, the current attacks on the Defense Lines will have their full attention. Now is the right chance. If Jackson\u2019s Ranger Unit can secretly infiltrate the rear and take over the Warp Gate, then we can devour the entire Southern Front at once.\u2019That was if they succeeded. This was a strategy where defeat was not acceptable.Because of the absence of the Warp Gate, the Cairo Kingdom wouldn\u2019t be able to send troops to the Southern Front, and if Hector could attack them from the rear and front simultaneously, then all the Defense Lines would fall down eventually. From then on, it would be easy. The moment the Southern Front was taken over, the Hector Kingdom would be able to take the initiative.In the basement of the secret base, a Warp Gate was installed painstakingly over a year. Thus, as soon as Jackson would report the good news, all the troops from here would be moved to the rear of the Southern Front.Edwin Hector said, \u201cWe must not rule out the possibility that this plan can fail. And if the worst does happen, be prepared to destroy the Warp Gate. If Jackson fails there, we will destroy the Warp Gate and move on to Plan Two.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhen he heard the cruel and ration decision, the knight bowed his head.\u2018He is called the Star of Hector for a reason. And because of Edwin Hector, the Hector Kingdom might finally be revived again.\u2019He was certain that the birth of their prince was a blessing to the kingdom.McBurney got up quickly. He had fainted because he felt relieved when he realized he would make it out alive, and thanks to the recovery effect of the potion, he was able to regain his consciousness quickly as well.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dStill, there was pain in his body, and especially, his stomach was hurting a lot. The potion did heal the wounds, but that didn\u2019t mean there were no aftereffects from a deep wound. Upon examination, he noticed that the skin near his stomach felt too sensitive. It seemed like someone had stitched it when he had fainted.\u201cYou are awake, Sir?\u201d Chris asked.As soon as he saw Chris, the memory of before he fainted struck his mind. He remembered that just when he was about to accept his death, Roman Dmitry came and saved his life.\u2018How was he able to show up at the Southern Training Center, though?\u2019A question arose from within him.Roman Dmitry was supposed to be on the Fifth Defense Line. Even before the Training Center was attacked, he heard that the Fifth Defense Line was in a difficult situation, and that meant Roman should have been there and helping others. Obviously, there was also the possibility that Roman might have run away because of the dangerous situation, but he knew that Roman Dmitry wasn\u2019t that kind of a person. But wasn\u2019t the battlefield the place where the true character of a person often came out?McBurney asked Chris frankly about what all happened. And the answer that came back astounded him.\u201cWhen we were informed that the Hector Kingdom had attacked, we all headed straight for the Fifth Defense Line, and there\u2026\u201dThe explanation was short. Still, it got rid of all of McBurney\u2019s concerns. Instead of running away, Roman Dmitry had headed straight forward for the Fifth Defense Line and defeated all of the enemies there.\u201cHe truly is amazing.\u201dMcBurney was being sincere. There would have been no time to prepare against the surprise attack from Hector, but Roman managed to make the best judgment and produced the best result, as well. The determination and power he had shown in the process proved to McBurney just how great he was, even though he had not seen it happen through his own eyes.\u2018As expected.\u2019The only one who had truly prepared for a war, Roman, did not disappoint him. The fact that someone like him was on the Southern Front actually comforted McBurney.Nevertheless, they couldn\u2019t continue their conversation anymore. It was because Roman had come out of the building.Roman checked the condition of McBurney. As soon as he confirmed that there were no major issues, he went straight to the point.\u201cPlease tell me in detail what happened here.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHe began to recall everything. Even though his physical condition was miserable, he remembered everything that had happened.\u201cWe were attacked by the Hector Kingdom about 2 hours ago. As usual, we were preparing for the next batch of trainees that would be trained, but the soldiers of Hector Kingdom appeared and attacked us suddenly. I quickly summoned my men and tried to fight them, but there was no way we could achieve a good result because of the overwhelming difference in our number of troops. And the result is what you see. We were pushed back unilaterally, and we do not even know if Viscount Bale is alive or dead.\u201d2 hours\u2014That was the important point. It was obvious that the enemy had already infiltrated the Southern Front for quite some time as they had attacked so quickly.\u201cWas there anything special about the outfit the enemies were wearing?\u201d\u201cEveryone had light armor on them, and the face of the enemy commander seemed to have scars.\u201d\u201cScars?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLight armor and a face full of scars\u2014That reminded Roman of a specific person. While he was investigating the South of Cairo, he came to know about a key person in the Hector Kingdom.\u201cIt could be their Ranger Unit.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah!\u201dMcBurney\u2019s eyes widened. It seemed like he knew something.The commander who leads Hector Kingdom\u2019s Ranger Unit is said to be a man who has scars on his face and has been awarded numerous medals too.It was a thing he had heard a long ago, which was why he couldn\u2019t remember that right away, but he was surprised that Roman had got it right, and that too, in an instant. Nevertheless, that alone wasn\u2019t enough to satisfy his curiosity, so he asked, \u201cIf it is their Ranger Unit, they could have infiltrated the Southern Front before others. However, I do not understand. Why did they attack the Southern Training Center? If they wanted to occupy an advantageous position, wouldn\u2019t it make more sense to create an advantage by breaking down the Defense Lines first? But they are moving in the opposite direction. Instead of attacking with all their forces on the front, they are aiming to attack the Training Center from the rear.\u201d\u201cI was thinking the same.\u201d\u201cWhat do\u2014\u201d\u201cSince the Training Center is at the rear of the Southern Front, you were all bound to be attacked.\u201dAs McBurney looked confused, Roman continued, \u201cThe Hector Kingdom seems to be using a \u201cSmoke Screen\u201d plan. Attacking the Defense Lines that are in the front is just for deception. Their true purpose is the Warp Gate behind us.\u201dThat was unexpectedly shocking.When he arrived back at the Training Center and saw the soldiers, Roman thought,\u00a0\u2018The fact that the enemy has attacked the Southern Training Center means that their true destination and aim aren\u2019t the Defense Lines of the Southern Front. If we follow this path, the only destination they can reach is the rear of the Southern Front. But what is the purpose of it? If they make a mistake, they will be surrounded both in the rear and the front as well.\u2019Only one theory came to his mind\u2014The reason for attacking the front was to create a \u201cSmoke Screen\u201d that could help them capture the rear of the Southern Front. Then, couldn\u2019t they use the Warp Gate to create variables?At that time, it was just a theory, but after he tortured Hector\u2019s soldiers and saw their reactions, he became sure of it.\u2018The Hector Kingdom has strong plans to make this war a success. A winning strategy which they are sure to succeed.\u2019Their true purpose wasn\u2019t only to capture the Warp Gate in the rear of the Southern Front. If their plan was successful, then not only would the Hector Kingdom be able to cut off the reinforcements that Cairo would try to send, but they could also increase their options by inviting forces and launching an even more aggressive attack.The Warp Gate was the most surprising thing he had learned about yet in this world. The magic artifact that allowed one to travel through space convinced Roman that magic was something as great as martial arts.The strategy created by Edwin Hector had now been discovered by this unknown man.McBurney jumped up. He was in pain, yet he didn\u2019t seem to care about it.\u201cShouldn\u2019t we currently be assisting the Southern Front\u2019s rear if they have such a plan? Is it alright if I join the fight against them?\u201cNo.\u201dRoman shook his head.According to what McBurney had said, the Rangers Unit had attacked the Southern Training Center around 2 hours before they had come here. That meant one thing.\u201cIt has almost been an hour and a half since Hector\u2019s Ranger Unit attacked the Southern Training Center and left. That is enough time for them to put the plan into action. Mr. McBurney, have you gotten word from the rear that the enemy has attacked them yet?\u201d\u201c\u2026It cannot be.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dDespite knowing the truth, Roman wasn\u2019t in a hurry. To be precise, there was no reason to rush anymore.\u201cThey have been preparing for this war for a long time, and they should have captured the Warp Gate by now. What we need to do from now on is clear. If the enemies appear from the rear, the troops of the Southern Front, including us, will be isolated. We have to fight and survive against the troops of the Hector Kingdom in here without any help from the Cairo Kingdom.\u201dIt was as expected. At that time, Hector\u2019s Ranger Unit had succeeded in capturing the Warp Gate on the Southern Front.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88 - The Star Of Hector (2)Jackson, the commander of the Ranger Unit, remembered the day he spoke with Edwin Hector one year ago.\u201cJackson, the Hector Kingdom no longer has the strength to withstand the current circumstances. If the crops don\u2019t grow much this year, the treasury will run out because of the interest of the Golden Bank and the pressure they keep putting on us. So, I would like to suggest one thing. How about we take over the Southern Front of the Cairo Kingdom?\u201dIt sounded like a stupid proposal considering it was given by the Star of Hector. Although he knew that Edwin was an unusual person from the rumors, he didn\u2019t think he would speak of an attack on the Cairo Kingdom like it was nothing.Nevertheless, his words and actions felt like as soon as he nodded his head, the Cairo Kingdom would fall. Still, he refused it back then. Even though Cairo was a weak nation, just like Hector, it was still impossible for them to defeat that nation without any sacrifices. Nevertheless, 2 hours\u2014In just 2 hours, Edwin made Jackson accept his proposal. When he heard of the plan made by Edwin, he realized that he wasn\u2019t just speaking thoughts as they came to his mind. He wasn\u2019t sure if it would work, but he wanted to support Edwin.It was rumored that the Hector Kingdom was cursed by the Gods, and that was why crops weren\u2019t growing properly in Hector. And that was why they needed to take extreme measures to turn over the situation.And in such times, Edwin Hector\u2019s existence was considered to be a rain in a drought. He, who was called the greatest genius of all time, was a hero born in turbulent times.Thus, the plan was carried out diligently throughout one year. A spy was planted on Cairo\u2019s Southern Front, and a tunnel was dug that would lead Jackson and his troops to the rear of the Southern Front. That was also how they had succeeded in infiltrating in just a few hours.Edwin Hector said, \u201cWe have no choice but to win this war. We scouted the Southern Front 48 times in one year, yet the Cairo Kingdom never once noticed that. Their actions show their carelessness. I don\u2019t think they will be able to break through our plan and protect the Warp Gate, but we still need to be vigilant and continue things as planned. If we cut off the comms at the Southern Training Center, and enter through the rear tunnel as we planned, the Warp Gate will fall into our hands.\u201dAnd as planned, Jackson saw the Warp Gate in front of him.Puak!\u201cKuak!\u201dThe soldiers who were guarding it were killed instantly. As the men started to die, screams could be heard everywhere, but Jackson rushed straight for the Warp Gate without even caring to hide the bodies.It was time to fight with their full strengths from now on. If they got discovered by the enemy before they managed to connect the Warp Gate, they would all be killed here, but if they managed to succeed, they would be able to win the war.\u201cHurry up!\u201dThe technician quickly began to work on the Warp Gate. This was a mouth-watering time for them. If the Cairo Kingdon had a good system on the border, then their plan would have already been discovered by now, but they were currently distracted with the attacks on the Defense Lines.Finally,Wheik!\u201c\u2026It\u2019s working!\u201dThe Warp Gate shone, and as the bright light dimmed down, Edwin Hector came into their vision.With a single step, Edwin Hector was now on Cairo\u2019s land.And seeing Edwin Hector\u2019s flaming red hair flutter in the wind, all the Rangers knelt down.\u201cWe greet Prince Edwin Hector.\u201dTheir voices were brimming with passion.According to the plan, the troops in the Ranger Unit had gone out with a single thought that they would buy time for the Hector Kingdom to survive. They had prepared to even be worked to their bones, and finally, they had managed to bring the best result they could hope for.It seemed like the war had already been won. Some of the soldiers even had tears in their eyes.Nevertheless, Edwin Hector didn\u2019t smile. He only walked toward Jackson.\u201cWhat is the situation?\u201d\u201cMost of the troops on the rear of the Southern Front have been dispatched to the front lines to focus on their defense. And, as expected, because of the complex system of Cairo, their reinforcements haven\u2019t even arrived yet. If you give the order, we will occupy the rear of the Southern Front entirely.\u201dThe Cairo Kingdom\u2019s complex power system had created problems even in a situation of emergency. The Southern Front hadn\u2019t received reinforcements even though it had been more than 2 hours since the first attack, and thanks to that, the Hector Kingdom was able to capture the Warp Gate easily.Now, it was time for Hector to move forward. There was no way Cairo could send people in, so Hector decided to move on with his plan.\u201cKellan.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dA knight stepped forward.\u201cI will entrust the First Battalion to you. Take care of those in the rear fortress and prepare a formidable defense, in case they succeed in sending troops through land. We can never anticipate how desperate they will get. This war might even drag on for a week, a month, or an entire year. Therefore, be absolutely prepared for the worst-case scenario.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dKellan stepped back.Some of the soldiers who appeared one after another through the Warp Gate followed Kellan and moved.\u201cJackson.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWe lost contact with Baron McCleary, who was on the Fifth Defense Line. Do you have any news about that?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t exactly figured it out myself, but I don\u2019t think we can afford to contact him as he might be in the middle of a battle. You don\u2019t have to worry too much, Prince. It is the Fifth Defense Line, and the commander there is famous for being rotten and cowardly, so he might have decided to spare strength and use a few troops to break through.\u201dEdwin Hector\u2019s expression changed as soon as he heard that.\u201cDid I not command him to not do anything other than what we had planned?\u201d\u201c\u2026You did, Prince.\u201d\u201cAs soon as the plan succeeds, I will punish the Baron, regardless of his performance. Do you agree?\u201d\u201cI agree.\u201dNod.Edwin Hector hated things going against his plans. Still, he had not even imagined that the Baron would have fallen. It was natural. The Fifth Defense Line was the weakest of all the Defense Lines on the Southern Front, and through many calculations, he concluded that there were no variables there.Edwin Hector ordered, \u201cWith the exception of the 1st Battalion, everyone will now deal with the Cairo remnants in here. The war isn\u2019t over yet. Until our flag is planted here, we need to stay alert.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dEven back then, the Hector Kingdom wasn\u2019t aware of the existence of the single\u2014No, of the two variables that had appeared on the Southern Front.Fortunately, the crisis of the First Defense Line being captured was avoided. The enemies stepped back when Cairo\u2019s soldiers countered them, and thanks to that, they could finally breathe some fresh air.\u201cRepair the walls before the enemies attack again! Our lives are at stake here! Hurry!\u201d Count Donald roared as he looked around.The walls had to be covered up soon. Some of the walls even looked like they would collapse at any given moment, and the gate had almost been opened. It was fortunate that the Hector Kingdom wasn\u2019t pushing in anymore. If they had decided to push in while ignoring sacrifices, the gate would have surely fallen down and the First Defense Line would have been at the risk of annihilation. Nevertheless, they managed to sort it out.Count Donald sighed. Just then, a soldier came to him.\u201cCommander, we have received a call from the Southern Training Center.\u201d\u201cConnect it.\u201dHe moved toward the Command Room. And when he finally arrived,[Count Donald. I am Roman Dmitry, a member of the Reserve Unit of the Fifth Defense Line.]He saw Roman on the screen. As he knew about Roman, Count Donald asked, \u201cWhy is the Youngest Ranker contacting us?\u201d[I will get straight to the point. The Hector Kingdom seems to have taken over the Warp Gate in the rear of the Southern Front by using their forces on the Defense Lines as a smoke screen. We are isolated now. Before Hector takes advantage of the current situation, we must abandon the forts and take refuge in the mountains.]\u201c\u2026What!?\u201dCount Donald jumped up from his seat. He had barely blocked the attack on the First Defense Line, but Hector had already taken over the Warp Gate? He couldn\u2019t believe it. As that was a reality he didn\u2019t want to accept, Count Donald denied the truth.\u201cThere is no way the rear could have been captured already. And, if what you say is true, is it the right decision to abandon our positions? There is no way we will be able to survive the attacks of Hector while staying in a forest. Rather, the main focus should be strengthening our defense.\u201d[I do admit that, but the Southern Front cannot handle any direct confrontations against Hector any longer. The Hector Kingdom didn\u2019t come to capture the Defense Lines intentionally. They didn\u2019t even use their full power and distracted us by attacking the Defense Lines mildly while focusing on capturing the Warp Gate. Count Donald. Think rationally. Do you seriously think they were fighting while giving their all on the Defense Lines?]Count Donald went speechless once he heard those words. Actually, he had also felt a lot of strange things happen. Although the Hector Kingdom was in a clearly advantageous situation, they had suddenly decided to withdraw. He only got to know now that it was because they had been focused on capturing the rear first.Roman continued,[Escaping to the mountains doesn\u2019t mean we are running away. If you stay in the fort, you will be isolated from the other forces and will be defeated by the enemy forces that will attack from both sides. We need to launch a guerrilla operation in the mountains. Even if we have to be mere thorns in their way, we need to make sure the enemy cannot capture the entire Southern Front.]Roman\u2019s persuasion was meaningless as Count Donald had already concluded his thoughts and made a decision. He couldn\u2019t believe the rear had already been taken over, and he thought the fortress was safer, and that Roman may have been a spy of Hector.\u201cWe will decide for ourselves. Please don\u2019t contact us again.\u201dAnd he cut the call.The commanders of the other Defense Lines weren\u2019t much different. Their reactions were almost the same. Some didn\u2019t accept that the rear position could be captured, and the others said they wouldn\u2019t leave their positions. They could only think the forts were safer because of their common sense. They concluded the best option was to stay behind the defense of the walls.Nevertheless, there was one\u2014Steven, who was now the commander of the Fifth Defense Line, who obeyed Roman\u2019s orders.[I will join you right away.]It was an absurd situation.In a situation where they didn\u2019t even know if Roman was telling them the truth, he had expected such reactions from the commanders.\u2018Well, if they were people who actually knew how wars worked, they wouldn\u2019t even have been in such a situation. The front lines were an entire mess, and the advantage we could have because of the rear was captured as well. Staying here anymore is but an act of suicide.\u2019Roman had realized one thing with his experience from many wars\u2014What is scarier than a powerful enemy is a powerful yet ignorant ally.It was obvious why he had contacted them despite expecting such reactions. It was because they belonged to Cairo, and so did he. Thus, he thought that if they somehow listened to him, he could use them strategically. Nevertheless, he had now done the bare minimum. Roman didn\u2019t force them to follow him, but he had given them a choice and told them the best strategy that could be used.Soon, Roman called for his soldiers.\u201cTake your luggage. We will now move to the mountains.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe soldiers began to move along with him. From now on, it was going to be a difficult battle. Nevertheless, he wasn\u2019t scared. In his previous life, even though he had been in even worse situations than this, he was able to reach the top of the Demonic Sect.And an hour after Roman had left for the mountains,Step.A group of troops appeared. They were the soldiers of Hector and were waving their flag proudly.They all stepped forward, trampling the corpses on the ground.And the direction they were heading showed that Hector\u2019s next objective was the First Defense Line.Editor\u2019s Thoughts: The rear has been taken over by Hector! Roman is headed to the mountains! And it seems the Defense Lines are done for as well. It will be breathtaking to see the guerilla operation by Roman, his soldiers, and the other soldiers of Cairo.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89 - The Star Of Hector (3)As soon as he cut the Magic Call, Count Donald ordered to contact the rear of the Southern Front.\u201c\u2026No response.\u201d\u201cDamn it.\u201dAs soon as he heard the report from the soldier, he became stiff. They had tried to connect a Magic Call several times by now. And as there was no response even though it had been more than an hour, Roman Dmitry\u2019s concerns seemed to be true.His hands began to tremble. The fact that the Warp Gate had been occupied wasn\u2019t an issue he could simply skip over.\u2018They have completely isolated the Southern Front. Even if the kingdom sends us reinforcements through the Warp Gate that is closest to the Southern Front, it will still take a fortnight. This war is practically over. The Southern Front has been utterly defeated, and from now on, the main goal should be survival, and that requires patience.\u2019When he thought it through, there was no way out of this war. There was the option of abandoning the fort and running away, but there was a high chance he would die in a barren mountain if he did that. Also, the steep and rugged mountain terrain wasn\u2019t suitable as an escape route, and Roman\u2019s operation sounded too difficult as well.Obviously, the option of staying in the fort wasn\u2019t that good either.He could not guarantee how long everyone would survive as they were isolated here, but he still decided to stay behind the protection of the fort\u2019s walls and judged that decision to be best.Also,\u2018I am highly likely to be reprimanded for being negligent first. However, if I leave and run away, the punishment will be more severe. I must fight to the death here for my future after the war. If we can hold on until the reinforcements arrive, we have a good chance of survival.\u2019Those were his actual thoughts.Count Donald hadn\u2019t immediately reported to the kingdom even after he had confirmed that the Hector Kingdom had crossed the border. That was an absolutely complacent attitude. And that had resulted in the current circumstances.If he had reacted even a little earlier, the Cairo Kingdom might have been in a different situation, but now, his actions had only made things worse. That was a truth he couldn\u2019t hide. As numerous soldiers had witnessed the scene, Count Donald knew that his error would be surely reported.Thus, he needed a justification to be forgiven. A commander who stayed on the battlefield till the end\u2014Wasn\u2019t that a good reason? Along with protecting his face, that could turn his reputation into that of a valiant commander.\u2018Roman Dmitry must have talked about guerrilla operations even though he did not know how steep the mountains here are. His judgment is trash, and there could be no chance of winning if I followed him. He was assigned here only a few weeks ago, while I have been on the First Defense Line for several years, and he wanted to advise me to run away? That is why the knowledge acquired through books on warfare is scary.\u2019Even though Roman Dmitry is the Youngest Ranker, he is still only a little boy on the battlefield.Even back then, Count Donald believed he was right.Count Donald\u2019s hope didn\u2019t last long. Four hours after the Magic Call, soldiers of Hector could be seen coming from both the front and the rear of the First Defense Line.What Roman said was true. The Warp Gate had been occupied, and the Hector Kingdom had boldly sent its troops through \u2018Warp.\u2019\u201cEveryone, get ready to attack!\u201d\u201cGet ready to attack!\u201dThe soldiers began to look for their arrows. As the blood had dried out, they were ready to fight again. The repaired wall seemed to be in good condition, and they had additional weapons and supplies like water ready by their side. They didn\u2019t want to get pushed back again.The soldiers who finished loading the weapons, like Ballista, truly believed that they wouldn\u2019t be defeated this time.Count Donald said, \u201cListen, soldiers of the First Defense Line! The Hector Kingdom has taken over the Warp Gate. Because of that, we are completely isolated, and we cannot expect the kingdom to send support for at least a fortnight or even more than that. Nevertheless, we are alive. Just as we had defeated the vicious demons of Hector in the first battle, if we trust each other and fight, we can survive until the reinforcements arrive. Trust me, Count Donald. We will survive to the end!\u201d\u201cWoahhhhh!\u201d\u201cFollow Count Donald!\u201dCairo\u2019s soldiers cheered. Nevertheless, they didn\u2019t know the truth. They believed the words of Count Donald, and for those with limited information, fighting Hector was the only way out of the current situation.However, they all soon witnessed the grim reality. The soldiers of Hector that could be seen beyond the border were incomparable to those who had attacked previously.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s all over.\u201d\u201cJust how many are there?\u201dAt least a thousand of them could be seen. The previous attack now looked like a joke. Their crowd was like a swarm of ants, and Cairo\u2019s men were only numbered a few hundred. However, that wasn\u2019t the end of the problems. When they saw that Hector had brought siege weapons as well, their hearts sank down.\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a Flare.\u201dThey had a Flare, and Cairo had no way to stop that. They didn\u2019t have any siege weapons that could counter it.The courage which had risen because of the speech faded away fast.The soldiers thought that this was the end. And just as they thought that, the Flare blew out flames, and the First Defense Line witnessed a disaster.Kwang!Rumble!\u201cKuak!\u201d\u201cAck!\u2019A huge fire broke out.The gate they had worked hard to prepare collapsed down at once, and soldiers, who were on fire, screamed their lungs out as they fell down the wall. A proper battle hadn\u2019t even started yet. They had only fired Flare once from afar, yet the defense of Cairo was already down. And that sight naturally stunned Count Donald. He had delivered the speech as if he was a great hero, but he only now realized the mistake he had made.[I do admit that, but the Southern Front cannot handle any direct confrontations against Hector any longer. The Hector Kingdom didn\u2019t come to capture the Defense Lines intentionally. They didn\u2019t even use their full power and distracted us by attacking the Defense Lines mildly while focusing on capturing the Warp Gate. Count Donald. Think rationally. Do you seriously think they were fighting while giving their all on the Defense Lines?]Roman\u2019s words were the truth. Hector had deliberately not used their full power at once, even though they were capable of capturing the entire Southern Front at once.Nevertheless, it was too late for regrets.Rumble!The walls were now collapsing.And,\u201cAttack!\u201d\u201cCharge!\u201d\u201cWahhhh!\u201dEnemies were rushing in from both the rear and the front.Count Donald eventually collapsed on the ground.It was too late for regrets. No matter what he did now, he couldn\u2019t change the tide of the battle. And because of the stupid judgment of a commander, a literal massacre took place on the Southern Front. The walls and gate had already lost their functions at the start of the battle, and the troops of Hector were now all around.Finally,\u201cThe commander\u2019s head is cut off!\u201dThe head of Count Donald, who had no way out, was cut off from his body.Edwin Hector\u2019s forces had cut off the escape path, and Count Donald couldn\u2019t do anything else other than tremble while seeming like he had showered in sweat as he died. That was the moment the battle ended. The troops of Hector, who looked like they would start a great war, gained a perfect victory within one hour.Edwin Hector, who entered through the wide-open gate, was escorted by knights and received a report from Jackson.\u201cBy suppressing the frontline using Flare, we were able to capture the place with minimal casualties. What should we do now? The other commanders have also begun to attack the other Defense Lines. Cairo will not be able to respond to the Flares, as well as the troops, and I think we will have the Southern Front under our control in no time.\u201dHis voice was slightly raised because of his joy. An operation that everyone had concluded impossible was about to turn into reality soon. And as he thought that a historic moment was about to arrive soon, Jackson could hardly hide his joy.Edwin Hector said, \u201cFor now, we will focus on securing the First Defense Line. Time is on our side. In order to not cause any mistakes, make sure to capture all the soldiers and lock them up as well. Depending on the situation, they can be used as hostages or even means to trade. That way, we won\u2019t need weapons to talk to Cairo.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dEdwin Hector was being thorough. Even with this huge victory, he didn\u2019t seem even the least bit distracted. Although they could relax now, Edwin felt something ominous.\u2018The plan is perfect. Then what am I missing here?\u2019He didn\u2019t know about the small signs he had missed. The soldiers who were at the Southern Training Center had not come back yet. The fact that Baron McCleary hadn\u2019t contacted him kept stimulating his sensitive senses.Just then, a knight who had a pale face rushed in and reported, \u201cWe have trouble!\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cBaron McCleary is dead. The reason he didn\u2019t communicate with us is because he died on the battlefield!\u201dAnd as soon as he heard those words, Edwin Hector\u2019s expression turned icy cold.The one who had reported it was one of the soldiers who had escaped from there.\u201cDescribe the situation,\u201d said Edwin Hector coldly.The soldier nodded as he said, \u201cIn the beginning, the Hector Kingdom had the advantage in the battle. The Defense Line was unprepared for the attack, and we broke through the gates as soon as the war began, even without using Flares. Baron McCleary ordered the soldiers to capture the place, but then, the monster appeared.\u201d\u201c\u2026Monster?\u201d\u201cYes. He was definitely a monster.\u201dAt that moment, as the memory of Roman surfaced back in his mind, the soldier started trembling in fear. Actually, he was the only one who had survived and escaped successfully from that place, and he had seen the monster slaughter all of Hector\u2019s soldiers except him.\u201cThe power of the monster was literally unbelievable. He was only one, but he slaughtered countless of our allies. Dozens of soldiers vanished in the blink of an eye when they went up against him, and the Aura Swordsmen, as well, died without even being able to defend against even one of his attacks. The Fifth Defense Line didn\u2019t exactly show much hope of winning until he stepped in, and when he beheaded Baron McCleary, we had no choice but to run away to survive.\u201dMonster\u2014That was an unexpected variable. Suddenly, a name surfaced in Edwin Hector\u2019s mind.\u2019The Youngest Ranker in Cairo\u2014He was said to be assigned to the Southern Front.\u2019Even when he heard the news, Edwin couldn\u2019t believe that one man could change everything. The rumors said that Roman Dmitry was a 3-Star Aura Swordsman, and he was not at a level where he could show such an overwhelming presence.That was the beginning of the variable. In the one year of preparation, everything was clearly investigated. The problem was that Roman Dmitry was a sudden appearance in the world of Rankers and a variable they hadn\u2019t found much about even after a year of investigation.\u2018A variable has come up.\u2019Baron McCleary was dead. Then, it meant that the troops he couldn\u2019t deal with were now roaming around the Southern Front.\u201cThe troops who reached there just now reported that there were no soldiers of Cairo out there. It seems like they have escaped to the mountains. Just give me the order, Prince. I will pursue them with a team and bring the \u2018Monster\u2019 in front of your eyes.\u201dJackson reported the information he had just received. Truly, no one on Hector\u2019s side liked this. The perfect plan had now been pierced and had a hole. Nevertheless, Edwin Hector didn\u2019t want to overdo it.\u201cNo. The tide of war has already turned. The Fifth Defense Line has only a few troops. They cannot influence Cairo\u2019s leaders to a huge extent with a few troops. We will proceed as planned. Once we have all the Defense Lines in our grasp, we will turn the Southern Front into a fortress that Cairo will never be able to invade.\u201dThat was the heart of the plan. If they managed to completely overtake the Southern Front, then Cairo would surely talk to them. Edwin\u2019s decision was quick, and just like that, after a day passed, the Hector Kingdom had successfully overtaken the entire Southern Front.And then, Edwin gave new orders.\u201cFrom now on, it is time to negotiate with the Cairo Kingdom. Connect me to the Royal Family of Cairo.\u201dThat was Hector\u2019s main purpose.Finally, the desperate reality of the Southern Front was conveyed to the Royal Family of Cairo.Editor\u2019s Thoughts: The Southern Front has been taken over entirely. Count Donald dying wasn\u2019t that much of a surprise. Let\u2019s see how much money Hector wants in exchange for the Southern Front. Also, Roman Dmitry being a monster for Hector as they are fighting against him was a good evaluation lol.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90 - The Star Of Hector (4)There was a reason why Cairo didn\u2019t respond as soon as the news of Hector\u2019s attack was delivered.The young King of Cairo, Daniel Cairo, looked at the empty room with a sad expression.\u201cWhen will the others even arrive?\u201d\u201c\u2026I apologize. It seems like it will take a while because the unexpected news was delivered so suddenly, and everyone is coming from far away.\u201dThe servant shook his head. But that was all. He didn\u2019t say anything about calling them again. He did have a special lord, but he knew that the King couldn\u2019t save his life if he went up against the Central Government. If the monarchy had been strong, the current situation wouldn\u2019t have happened in the first place.\u201cHaah\u2026\u201d\u00a0Daniel Cairo sighed. He was utterly shocked when he heard the news of the Southern Front being attacked. As if a quick response wasn\u2019t necessary, the nobles of the Central Government told him to put the judgment on hold until everyone had gathered. Basically, the King had no power to make any decisions.Marquis Benedict, Count Denver, and Count Gregory\u2014Only with the consent of those who had great power could the troops of Cairo move. A long time passed. And in the meantime, the Ranger Unit of the Hector Kingdom passed through the Southern Training Center, attacked the rear of the Southern Front, and even succeeded in capturing the Warp Gate. Nevertheless, the Royal Family of Cairo was unaware of the harsh reality.Daniel Cairo was only waiting for those who had actual power in the nation, and they showed up a while later.\u201cAhahaha. I am a little late. On the way, the carriage had some issues, so I couldn\u2019t help but be a little late. Anyway, is it true that the Hector Kingdom attacked the Southern Front?\u201dMarquis Benedict showed no regret for being late. And the others weren\u2019t much different. Both Count Denver and Count Gregory, who had sat down, ignored Daniel Cairo, who had been waiting for them for a long time by himself.\u201cAccording to the report from the Southern Front, the Hector Kingdom has crossed the border and attacked the Defense Lines. I don\u2019t know what the reason is, but at this rate, the Southern Front will be in danger.\u201d\u201cThen, shouldn\u2019t we send troops there?\u201dFinally, sending support was being talked about. Simultaneously, Danial Cairo\u2019s stomach started to twist intensively. He would have dispatched troops hours ago if the nobility had arrived at the meeting promptly or if he had the authority to issue an order! But what could be done now? This was the reality of Cairo.Daniel Cairo said, \u201cThen, we will send troops to the Southern Front right now.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWe accept the order.\u201dA decision was finally made. It was the way Cairo, a small nation, held its meetings. However, it was too late by then.The Warp Gate had already been captured. It was then that Marquis Benedict realized how serious the situation was.\u201c\u2026The Warp Gate has been taken over. This is a serious problem for us. Not only is there no way for us to send troops to the Southern Front, but this leaves the Southern Front no choice but to try and withstand the onslaught of Hector.\u201dHe had judged that Cairo would not be in danger from their attack anyway. The southern area of Cairo was barren. It wasn\u2019t important to them geographically, and it wouldn\u2019t be too hard for Hector\u2019s forces to subdue the soldiers out there. The problem was if Hector decided to hold out on the Southern Front. If things became like that, the Warp Gate there would be a massive problem for Cairo.They finally realized that waiting for each other to come before taking the decision was the problem. If they had reacted a little faster, the Cairo Kingdom wouldn\u2019t have had the Southern Front taken over so easily.Daniel Cairo said, \u201cHow do we deal with this situation? The Southern Front wouldn\u2019t have been in such danger if you had allowed me to take the correct decision when the crisis on the Southern Front was reported. Reflect on what you did. That is your responsibility!\u201dEven though he was a weak king, there were limits to what he could stand to. However, despite seeing the King\u2019s anger, the other nobles weren\u2019t scared.Just then, Edwin Hector contacted them.When the Magic Call was connected, Marquis Benedict spoke on behalf of Daniel Cairo.\u201cFor what reason did Hector attack Cairo? We thought Cairo and Hector had a friendly relationship. Actually, we didn\u2019t even do proper border checks because of no threats, and when we heard the news about Hector\u2019s droughts, we even provided food. So, what the hell is this?!\u201d He asked aggressively.Nevertheless, Edwin Hector didn\u2019t lose his composure even in the face of Marquis Benedict\u2019s aggressive tone.[You really are shameless. It is Cairo, not Hector, who crossed the line.]He had played out the current situation numerous times in his head. It was obvious how the Cairo Kingdom would act out. Thus, Edwin Hector had prepared a perfect answer.[Half a year ago, there was an incident where Cairo\u2019s soldiers had crossed the border. They explained that they had crossed the border as they were lost, but actually, they were holding the maps of Hector, which had major locations marked on them, in their hands. We tried to capture and subdue them, but when they realized that their intentions had been revealed, they jumped down the cliff to die. From then on, we had no choice but to doubt the intentions of Cairo. Why the hell did you send people out to explore Hector? There would have been no reason for Cairo to do such an act unless there was some hidden malicious intent.]That was different from the truth. The soldiers of Cairo had been found while they were falling off a cliff. It seemed to be a simple accident, but Edwin had turned that into a cause for war.In fact, the reason itself wasn\u2019t right, but it didn\u2019t matter that much. After all, war is war. The winner of the war is always said to have the right justification. And even if it caused troubles later on, the important thing for the Hector Kingdom was to solve their current problems.\u201cWhat nonsense!\u201d\u201cDo not frame Cairo! We never did it!\u201dThe backlash was fierce, yet Edwin didn\u2019t even blink.[In the end, there was distrust between Cairo and Hector, and we attacked the Southern Front to bury the guilt. You already know the Warp Gate is in our grasp. The Hector Kingdom has total control over the Southern Front. What we ask for should be clear from now on. Apologize for what happened that day, and give us a proper compensation instead. If you faithfully comply with these demands, we will consider our previous relationship and withdraw from here.]Hector\u2019s true purpose wasn\u2019t mere slaughter. The treasury of their nation had been drained, and they still had money to pay to the Golden Bank. Borrowing money from other sources would only add another burden on their heads.Nevertheless, it wasn\u2019t strange to ask for compensation in a war. The Southern Front had barren land, but it was still the land of Cairo, and Hector decided that they could get money from Cairo if they used that.\u201cYou robber!\u201d\u201cDo you think that makes sense?!\u201dThe nobles of Cairo protested. Nevertheless, that was all. Edwin showed no signs of backing down. If it was something that could be solved by negotiation, then he wouldn\u2019t have even attacked them in the first place. When he looked at the people of his nation crying in pain, he realized that he must solve their problems, even if he had to become a demon.[I will give you 3 days to think and respond. If you do not comply with our demands, then we will prepare for the next stop from the Southern Front being turned into Hector\u2019s land. Keep this in mind. If you try to compromise here only to gain time, then the hostages we have captured will not return alive.]And as soon as he finished his words,Tuk.Edwin Hector cut off the Magic Call.As soon as the Magic Call was cut off, silence filled the discussion room. After hearing Edwin\u2019s words, even Marquis Benedict had fallen silent.Eventually, Daniel Cairo said, \u201cThe Warp Gate is in the hands of the enemies. We have no other choice. Even sending the troops through the nearest Warp Gate will take at least a fortnight. The Hector Kingdom will surely become ready to defend while staying on the Southern Front in the meantime, and a war will plunge Cairo into hell, regardless of who wins it. The only way to reduce the damage is to pay Hector the amount they will be asking for.\u201d\u201cThey will definitely ask for a lot.\u201d\u201cIs there any other way? If you don\u2019t like this, tell me what we should do!\u201dEveryone gulped. The current situation was funny. The nobles of the Central Government were people in a small nation who only acted like they were great, but when an actual crisis hit them, their attitudes changed instantly.The reality was always different. At least Marquis Benedict spoke about wanting to solve the situation, but Count Denver and Gregory had utterly different responses. They were people who supported other nations anyway. Thus, they acted like the fate of Cairo didn\u2019t have anything to do with them. It had always been like this\u2014They usually treated Daniel Cairo like a scarecrow, but when things got difficult, they put him forward as the King.\u201c\u2026I accept the terms of Hector.\u201d\u201cI am against it,\u201d said a person just then,Count Denver asked, \u201cAre you saying you have another way?\u201d\u201cIt is clear that Hector wants money for now. They probably intend to save their nation, which is in trouble, through this war. Thus, the amount they will ask for will not be small. This isn\u2019t a mere matter of reclaiming the Southern Front. We also need to consider the situations that will appear after that. If the Kronos Empire crosses the border while we are running low on finances, the nation will have to go through even more damage for even trying to reclaim the Southern Front.\u201d\u201c\u2026But there isn\u2019t another way out.\u201d\u201cThere is.\u201dAt that moment, all the eyes in the room were focused on the member of Valhalla.Count Denver knew information the other nobles here didn\u2019t.\u2018They think there is nothing on the Southern Front that can turn things around.\u2019But there is one thing\u2014One person who can do it.Count Denver continued, \u201cThere is Roman Dmitry on the Southern Front. According to the report we just received, he had successfully defended the Fifth Defense Line against Hector, and has also delivered his intention to mobilize forces that can be used against Hector.\u201dNo one here knows about Roman\u2019s true talent. He is actually a 4-Star Aura Swordsman who destroyed Barco without much effort. Alright.\u201cWe have to trust him. If we send the troops to the Southern Front now, and Roman Dmitry creates a hole in Hector\u2019s defense, we have a good chance of winning the war.\u201dEven though he was only one variable, Count Denver was ready to place his bet on Roman.Editor\u2019s Thoughts: The first bet has been placed! Edwin Hector\u2019s calm thoughts and plan seem to be good, but will he be able to last against Roman? Wait, the question should be how long he will be able to last against Roman. Anyway, Roman\u2019s true talent is now being revealed, albeit slowly, and more carnage on the battlefield is coming soon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 - The Shadow Ghost (1)The entire room was filled with silence. That was how strong Count Denver\u2019s remarks were. As they seemed to make no sense, Daniel Cairo said, \u201c\u2026I do admit that Roman Dmitry is a great swordsman. He is a blessing for the Cairo Kingdom, considering he is a swordsman who achieved 3-Star in his twenties and even defeated Homer. However, everyone gathered here knows that Roman Dmitry cannot change the trend of this war by that much.\u201dThe reason the Four Factions of Cairo valued Roman was because of the value he would have in the future. As he achieved 3-Star at such a young age, all were rushing to get him. But that also meant that Roman Dmitry could not win against the Hector Kingdom right now. Roman\u2019s plan to cause internal divisions seemed nothing but the courage of a young warrior who hadn\u2019t seen the harsh reality of the world yet.Even Marquis Benedict sided with the King.\u201cI have the same thoughts. Roman Dmitry is the future of Cairo. It is more important to minimize the damage to the Cairo Kingdom through wise judgment rather than losing such a young talent. In any case, the Southern Front has already been captured by the Hector Kingdom. This is a war we have already lost.\u201dThat was a realistic decision.Furthermore, Roman Dmitry was someone Marquis Benedict wanted to take in. There was no way he could let him die out there. Since he had already done his duty at the Southern Training Center, he was thinking of taking in Roman as soon as he came back.Thus, everyone was against Count Denver\u2019s plan. Based on the information they knew, no one would make the mistake of siding with Count Denver.\u2018What should I do?\u2019Count Denver suppressed the laugh that almost leaked out. He had managed to obtain some incredible information from the higher-ups. And if he told the truth here, the tide of war would be turned, but he didn\u2019t do that. Even though he had the blood of Cairo, his spirit was that of Valhalla.\u201cAs everyone seems to be rejecting the plan, I won\u2019t push it further. However, I don\u2019t think it is necessary to give the Hector Kingdom what they want so soon. As they have given us three days, we can move our troops in preparation for the war continuing forward. However, how about accepting the demands if there is no change on the Southern Front within the next three days?\u201dThat was a compromise. Edwin Hector had given them three days to decide. It was enough time to come to a decision but not enough for them to overturn a war. Thus, Count Denver placed a bet. If meaningful results came thanks to that, then everyone would re-evaluate Roman\u2019s value. Then, he wouldn\u2019t only be revealed to be a 4-Star, but a monster who far surpassed any ordinary 4-Star Aura Swordsman.Was it because Count Denver made a reasonable proposal? Daniel Cairo, who had been thinking for a while, nodded his head.\u201c\u2026Either accept the proposal or reject it. We do need time. Thus, from now on, the Cairo Kingdom will prepare for both continuing the war with Hector, and moving forward with negotiations with them.\u201dHe basically wanted to be prepared for any possibilities. Everyone except Count Denver had accepted the fact that the war was over when the Warp Gate was captured anyway. That meant they weren\u2019t expecting any miracles.At the same time, on the Southern Front, Henry Albert was blown away by the sight in front of him.\u2018Damn it!\u2019Back when he began to follow Roman, his chest was puffed with unfounded confidence. When he saw Roman, who had slaughtered countless enemies, he felt confident that he could overcome any danger. But what happened then? Things went wrong from the very start. Because of his poor stamina, he couldn\u2019t keep up even with Roman\u2019s troops and lost sight of them shortly after they had departed.And when he finally arrived at the Southern Training Center while searching for a trail, he saw a terrible sight.\u2018This is so fucked up.\u2019What he saw was truly horrifying. The place that had been peaceful a while ago was now a wasteland, and bodies with familiar faces were lying everywhere. Nevertheless, Roman Dmitry was nowhere to be seen. At that moment, his mind went blank. It was because of the ominous thought that Roman Dmitry might have lost. He turned back.\u201cWe will retreat to the First Defense Line.\u201dThe heroic spirit he had earlier was now lost. The only thing running through his mind now was safety. He needed a fence that could protect him from the enemies that had destroyed the Southern Training Center. However, the sight that greeted him when he reached the First Defense Line was also terrible.\u201c\u2026Oh, God.\u201dHis mind went blank again. He truly had no idea how serious the current situation was. Although the Hector Kingdom had made a surprise attack, the Fifth Defense Line blocked them, thanks to Roman. Thus, he thought that there may be some way the other Defense Lines had also blocked them. However, Henry Albert had no choice but to fall down on the ground while trembling when he saw the harsh reality with his own eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s already over.\u201dThe First Defense Line had also been destroyed. That was the horrible truth. As if it wasn\u2019t enough that the Southern Training Center had been attacked and destroyed, the First Defense Line was gone as well. Now, there was no hope of winning this war.He jumped up and admitted that Cairo had already been defeated. However, there was no need for Henry to sacrifice himself.\u201cWe will retreat to the mountains right now!\u201d\u201cMove fast!\u201dHe made a quick judgment. The mountains in the South weren\u2019t a suitable escape route because they were quite steep. Nevertheless, that was a much better option than dying. Henry Albert ran so hard that his body was totally drenched in sweat. His already low stamina had been depleted, and his soldiers\u2019 expressions looked like their souls were trying to exit their bodies. Still, Roman Dmitry\u2019s whereabouts were unknown. Nevertheless, even if he had survived and chosen to fight, holding onto the Southern Front was no different than jumping into a pit of fire.\u2018A hero of war? I don\u2019t need any of that fame! Living should be the highest priority!\u2019After running for a long time, the surrounding landscape changed, and he seemed to be in the middle of a grassy mountain. As he judged that he was safe now, he sat on the ground to catch his breath.\u201cHuff\u2026 Huff\u2026 Huff\u2026 Huff\u2026\u201d\u2018I lived.\u2019Some people might still be fighting below the mountain. Nevertheless, once he crossed the mountain, he would surely be safe. And just as he was thinking that,Shk!\u201cShhh.\u00a0Be quiet.\u201dSomeone had drawn a cold sword to his neck. And the one who did that was Chris.Henry Albert, who was about to pee his pants, sighed when he saw it was Chris. But\u2026 why was Chris aiming his sword at Henry? It was to prevent him from making any sounds. Once he retrieved the sword, Chris took the lead and started walking.\u201cFollow me.\u201dWas it because of the relief of being alive? Henry just followed him silently.\u2019\u2026Why is Roman\u2019s knight here?\u2019It was strange. Roman Dmitry said he was heading to the rear, so why was his knight in the middle of the mountain? He thought he might have come to the mountain because of the attack on the Southern Training Center, but that also didn\u2019t make any sense. That was because if Henry had been in that position, he would have already crossed the mountain. Although he had escaped quite far, he couldn\u2019t say that the enemy wouldn\u2019t be able to pursue him till here.How far did they walk?Henry Alberts\u2019s eyes widened when he saw the new scenery before him.\u2018What is this?\u2019Although he had only taken a few steps, the landscape had totally changed. What was before him now was a perfectly prepared camp. It stayed covered while covering a suitable size for a camp, and there was a space for the soldiers to rest as well.It was hard for Henry to believe this place was in the middle of the mountain. Considering the size of the camp, he should have been able to see it from far away, but only when he came close did he see it. His soldier\u2019s reactions were the same as his. And seeing that he wasn\u2019t the only one stunned, Henry asked, \u201cWhen the hell did you build such a hideout?\u201dChris still didn\u2019t stop walking. Once he signaled the guards to say there wasn\u2019t any danger, he answered Henry\u2019s question.\u201cOn the way to the rear of the Southern Front, we confirmed that the Training Center had been attacked. Then, our liege decided that the rear had already collapsed, so he commanded us to go straight to the mountains and established this secret hideout.\u201d\u201cThen we must run over the mountain and get to safety! Why are you all still staying here?\u201dChris stopped walking and turned to look at Henry with eyes full of disgust.\u201cThe war isn\u2019t over yet. The reason we are here is to protect our allies, like Mr. Henry, and kill the enemies who will come to the mountains. A mountain is a good place to face enemies with a small number of troops. If you had been one of Hector\u2019s troops, my sword wouldn\u2019t have stopped at the neck, but would have cut it off before you even realized what was going on.\u201dThat was a cruel remark. There was a wall of status between Chris and Henry, yet Henry didn\u2019t say anything as he had seen Chris in action now. Roman and his soldiers\u2014Each one of them was a monster. And particularly, Chris was someone who had outstanding fighting skills even among those monsters.\u2018How does the Dmitry family have so many monsters?\u2019It was already tough for him to accept.\u00a0Still, as he couldn\u2019t see Roman anywhere, he asked Chris about him. Then, Chris answered, \u201cMy liege is currently dealing with the enemies of Hector on the frontline.\u201dHenry Albert\u2019s face turned pale. As he expected, Roman Dmitry was crazy.Winning or losing a war was directly related to one thing\u2014The loser\u2019s death. Immediately after the First Defense Line collapsed, the troops trying to flee from there started being slaughtered unilaterally.Slash!\u201cKuak!\u201d\u201cAck!\u201dThere was no way they could survive. Cairo\u2019s soldiers only groaned as they were being attacked from all sides, and they fell one after another while screaming.Edwin Hector had nailed the need for many prisoners. However, as they had taken the entire Southern Front over in such a short time, too many prisoners would obviously be dangerous. That was why a massacre was currently going on. Death and blood could be seen everywhere.Brandt, who was a lieutenant of the First Defense Line, couldn\u2019t hide his pale expression as he looked at the rapidly declining army.\u2018Donald, you bastard!\u2019Before they were attacked, Brandt had witnessed Count Donald talk to Roman on a call, and if Donald had only listened to Roman\u2019s suggestion, the current slaughter would have been avoided. Nevertheless, Donald said that retreating was a shame, but because of that, the First Defense Line had now fallen.\u2018The Hector Kingdom is fully prepared. They started with a surprise attack, occupied the rear, and even brought Flares. This was a fight we could never win. That\u2019s probably why Roman Dmitry suggested we retreat to the mountains. I mean, he was aiming for another plan, but it meant abandoning the Southern Front.\u2019He didn\u2019t mean to say it was cowardly. Instead, he thought Roman\u2019s decision was right. In exchange for the carelessness, the rear of the Southern Front was occupied so quickly, and from that moment, the results were already decided.It was an overwhelming defeat! The bitter taste still lingered in his mouth. There was so much blood that just the smell of blood was enough to make him want to puke.Puak!The soldier right beside him fell to the ground. As it was a situation in which the enemy\u2019s spear had pierced the soldier\u2019s head, Brandt swung his sword toward him instantly.Swish!\u201c\u2026!\u201dHowever, the attack failed, even though it was almost instantaneous. And when his eyes met the furious eyes of the one who looked like a knight, goosebumps rose all over Brandt\u2019s body.\u2018Is this it?\u2019He could feel the next attack coming toward him. He knew it the moment their defense line collapsed\u2014the fact that everyone on the Southern Front, including himself, would not be able to go back alive. It was messed up. However, the moment he was about to accept his death,Swish!Puak!Blood splattered on the ground. And simultaneously, the head of Hector Kingdom\u2019s knight could be seen in the air.Then, in front of Brandt, who was astounded, a man with black hair suddenly appeared.Editor\u2019s Thoughts: Finally, Roman Dmitry enters! Henry seems to have been saved, and Roman\u2019s ruthless attitude can be seen in Chris. Also, Hector seems to be in a lot of trouble. Let\u2019s see how many days it takes to win the war. Also, we have reached so many views now. Thank you for your continuous support, guys. Have a beautiful day!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 - The Shadow Ghost (2)The soldiers of Hector literally couldn\u2019t believe the sight before them. Rather than the fact that a knight of Hector was killed in a single blow, they were stunned seeing a man running toward all of them by himself.\u201cAn enemy!\u201d\u201cKill him!\u201dDozens of soldiers of Hector rushed in to take down the one man who had managed to kill a knight of Hector with a single blow.And Roman Dmitry, who had appeared on the battlefield all alone, struck the enemies head-on as if the massive difference in number was nothing to him.Slash!Papak!\u201cKuaaak!\u201dIt was literally a one-sided massacre. The soldiers who had rushed in great force had already left the world while screaming, and the soldiers who had stopped to comprehend what just happened had their entire bodies cut down by a single sword. It was literally just a sword. There was no sign of even an Aura on that sword. Although it was purely based on physical ability, Roman Dmitry was slaughtering his enemies as if it was too easy.One by one\u2014every time Roman moved his sword, death followed. Some even stretched out their arms to try and hold down Roman, but before their arms even stretched entirely, Roman killed dozens of soldiers in his vision.He was truly a monster. Nevertheless, the thing even more shocking than the overwhelming force was that Roman was fighting all of them by himself.\u201cThis is insane!\u201d\u201cThe enemy is alone! Keep calm and attack him!\u201d\u201cAttack from all directions!\u201dIt was an unusual situation. Too many soldiers were focusing on a single enemy, but they still couldn\u2019t understand how Roman was committing a one-sided slaughter despite being all alone.Hector\u2019s soldiers continued to groan. Their common sense obviously said that a large group would win against a single enemy, but as the fight progressed, the corpses lying on the floor were only those of Hector\u2019s soldiers.Nevertheless, they didn\u2019t know it was an unfair fight in the first place. They didn\u2019t know that Roman was someone who, rather than injuring his enemies over time, cut off their necks whenever he got the chance.From start to finish, it didn\u2019t take that long. Shortly after Brandt recognized that the existence before him was Roman, what seemed to be hell in his eyes had unfolded on the battlefield.Puak!That was the end. Even the last soldier had now fallen down on the ground. And seeing all of Hector\u2019s soldiers lying on the ground without even moving slightly, Brandt looked at Roman with a pale expression.\u201c\u2026What the hell just happened?\u201dBrandt couldn\u2019t believe that such a monster existed in the Cairo Kingdom.The greeting was short.When Brandt saw Roman introduce himself as Roman Dmitry, his heart began to pound intensely.\u2019\u2026Was it really true that he was going to do the guerrilla operation?\u2019When he saw him talk with Count Donald, he mentioned abandoning the First Defense Line. However, that could also be seen as giving up the Southern Front. It was a common-sense decision anyway. As the Warp Gate had already fallen into the enemy\u2019s hands, there was no way for them to survive against the Hector Kingdom while staying here.The geographical advantage of mountains? That looked like a joke as well. The Hector Kingdom would surely have a hard time dealing with the remnants hiding in the mountains, but there was no place on the Southern Front that they could use as a fortress now. Summarily, guerrilla operations weren\u2019t a good strategy. While they were taking advantage of being in the mountains, the enemy could instead block the escape route and annihilate the remnants as well.\u2018Nevertheless, Roman Dmitry stayed. Although he had enough time to escape, he didn\u2019t give up on this place. Come to think of it, it was a bit unusual even when he contacted Count Donald. He noticed that the Warp Gate was captured but still contacted us and suggested we run away as well.\u2019It almost seemed like foresight now. Obviously, Roman\u2019s judgment was correct, but the guerilla operation was still reckless. Nevertheless, Brandt couldn\u2019t help but look at Roman with respect. Roman Dmitry knew he was in danger, but he stayed behind and continued to fight for the Cairo Kingdom. Thus, Brandt said, \u201cSir Roman Dmitry, you were right. Count Donald made a decision to stay and ended up dead, even though you had given him the right advice, and the First Defense Line has now fallen into the hands of the Hector Kingdom. This war is already over. The Hector Kingdom has already gone to deal with the Second Defense Line, and they won\u2019t last that long.\u201dHe bowed his head. He didn\u2019t know why Roman was moving all alone, but he was sure that the guerilla operation would be meaningless now. Knowing who Roman Dmitry was, Brandt rather raised his voice and urged Roman to get to safety.\u201cYou want me to give up?\u201d\u201cYes. There are things in the world that are physically impossible. I have just witnessed how strong Sir Roman Dmitry is, but the number of people the Hector Kingdom has brought is too large. There is no way you can defeat all of them by yourself. So, how about retreating through the mountains? No one will point their hands at you. I have witnessed how Sir Roman Dmitry has truly done his best here, and I will let the others know about it as well. So, please make a wise judgment and get to safety.\u201dPerhaps\u2026Brandt thought that Roman had come back to take revenge for someone he lost while going up against Hector. Actually, he could think of no other reason why Roman Dmitry would be moving alone with his common sense. Therefore, he thought that Roman had lost his subordinates and was now getting revenge for them.\u2018It\u2019s a wise decision.\u2019Roman judged that Brandt\u2019s advice wasn\u2019t wrong. Actually, even if they all retreated now, no one would think bad about Roman.Still,\u2018I don\u2019t like it.\u2019That was not because of patriotism. That wasn\u2019t because Roman Dmitry was from Cairo and the Southern Front where he was serving fell into the hands of the Hector Kingdom*.* The only reason Roman judged it like that was because it was a matter of self-esteem.Roman didn\u2019t want to make words like \u201cEven though Roman was present on the battlefield, he didn\u2019t make much of a difference and did nothing\u201d into reality. That was the same reason Roman had risked his life for. Still, for something like risking one\u2019s life, the gains to be gained here were small, and there was much to lose. Nevertheless, in the process of being born to reaching the peak in Murim, a world where the weak served as food for the strong, Baek Joong-hyuk learned one thing.\u2018I cannot set a precedent that undermines me even once.\u2019That was it. That was why he stayed here and didn\u2019t run away. And gazing directly into Brandt\u2019s eyes, Roman said, \u201cNo. This war hasn\u2019t ended yet.\u201dRoman looked back at the situation from the outbreak of war till now.\u2018The situation of the Hector Kingdom is bad due to famine. As the food to feed people has turned scarce, it is impossible for them to properly secure military supplies. Nevertheless, the fact that they waged war means that the Hector Kingdom was in a desperate situation.\u2019It was a simple thing\u2014Hector was aiming to solve their nation\u2019s problems through this war.\u2018All of Hector\u2019s Kingdom\u2019s actions can be explained by such a strategy. There is little incentive to them invading the Southern Front, given it is barren when compared to other areas. But after observing how they made an effort to get control of the Southern Front and capture the Warp Gate rather than launch a straightforward invasion across the border, they were aiming to isolate the Southern Front flawlessly. They will probably try to contact the higher-ups now and negotiate until they come to an agreement.\u2019Roman read the intentions of his enemies. As Hector wanted to end the war as soon as possible, their weakness was exposed.Thus, Roman said, \u201cThis war is a very special case. The reason the Hector Kingdom wanted to occupy the Southern Front so soon was because they couldn\u2019t afford this war to go on for a long time, along with the obvious reason of reducing their own sacrifices. Every war has a purpose. And Hector\u2019s purpose is to solve their nation\u2019s difficulties through this war. That is why they are aiming to completely capture the Southern Front. They want to negotiate without any problems.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dBrandt was stunned. Roman\u2019s words were hard to understand. Going to war because the nation was going through difficulties. How could he accept something like this as the reason?\u201cIt is a simple matter. The Hector Kingdom attacked the Southern Front, which they couldn\u2019t even profit much with. Do you think that Hector will continue to defend the Southern Front while their people continue to starve in the nation? Of course not. They are now betting the fate of their nation here.\u201dWhen the nation was on the brink of destruction, Hector decided to draw their sword to live. If they did nothing, they were going to die anyway. Thus, they made their last effort to continue to survive\u2014wage war.Roman made his decision.\u201cWe do not have to face the forces of Hector out here. If the number of enemies is ten thousand, then dealing with only one hundred of them, which is only 1%, will change the tide of this war. The Hector Kingdom will suffer because of staying out here, and the Royal Family of Cairo will not easily accept the request of Hector. That is why we have hope. That much is enough. Just by creating a small variable, we can burn the plans of Hector to the ground.\u201dWhen he heard those words, Brandt couldn\u2019t hide his admiration. The thoughts he had weren\u2019t wrong. Roman wasn\u2019t an ordinary person, and his perspective on the battlefield was quite unique. The only problem was that Roman\u2019s plan wasn\u2019t as easy as he made it sound.\u201c\u2026Will that even be possible?\u201d\u201cIt is possible.\u201dBrandt couldn\u2019t continue any further. That was because before he even asked Roman about his doubts,\u201cWe have already achieved the intended purpose.\u201dRoman Dmitry shocked him.The Hector Kingdom had begun its attack on the Second Defense Line.\u201cCharge!\u201dThud!Rumble!The Flare shot the wall. Some of the walls had already collapsed due to the repetitive attacks, and Cairo\u2019s soldiers could be seen screaming while being covered in flames. Nevertheless, Edwin Hector wasn\u2019t attacking them in a hurry. Now that they had finished contacting the Royal Family, time was on Hector\u2019s side. From now on, minimizing the damage on their side was the highest priority.\u201cThe plan is perfect.\u201dThey had been preparing for it for one year. And Edwin Hector had finally turned the situation he had played countless times in his mind into reality. While distracting the enemies\u2019 focus, they occupied the Warp Gate. That was when the war had already ended for Cairo. In Edwin\u2019s plan, once they captured the Warp Gate, there was no possibility of them losing this war. Actually, even saying they had already crossed the hurdles wouldn\u2019t have been an overstatement, either. From now on, they only needed to deal with the remnants of Cairo and receive an appropriate compensation to end this war.Nevertheless, even though the entire situation seemed advantageous, Edwin Hector still had troubles in his heart.\u2018In my plan, Baron McCleary\u2019s death was never counted for. The Fifth Defense Line is the weakest among all the Defense Lines. However, Baron McCleary still died. Roman Dmitry. Does it mean that he was a variable powerful enough to overcome the vast difference in power?\u2019Edwin Hector always doubted himself. Even if he was in a situation in which everything was going smoothly, he always looked back and tried to find any mistakes or things he might have missed. Nevertheless, no matter how many times he had looked back, the variable known as Roman Dmitry didn\u2019t seem to be that strong. His reputation was well known, but a 3-Star Aura Swordsman wasn\u2019t someone who could turn the tides of war.\u2018Contrary to the original plan, our attack on the Fifth Defense Line failed. What are the variables we need to watch out for? Even though I have looked through it repetitively, there are no variables strong enough to put us at risk. Even if Roman Dmitry leads an entire army against Hector, Cairo cannot defeat Hector with their current power on the Southern Front. Even if Roman Dmitry\u2019s force is more than we expected, although it could be difficult, it wouldn\u2019t be fatal. The Hector Kingdom is not weak enough to be swayed by only a single individual.\u2019Before he attacked the Second Defense Line, Edwin Hector had given the order to deal with any remnants of Cairo. He was concerned they would increase Roman\u2019s force, so he decided to block anything like that from happening. He did his best to suppress his doubts. Even though his nerves kept warning him, his head had concluded that nothing wrong would happen.Just then, a soldier entered and reported, \u201cPrince Edwin. The contact with the First Battalion, which had left to deal with the remnants of Cairo, has been lost.\u201dEven though it was only one report, the ominous thing soon spread.\u201cWe have lost contact with the Second Battalion.\u201d\u201cThe contact with the Third Battalion is no different.\u201dWith each report, Edwin Hector\u2019s face turned as cold as ice. Because of the variable, his ominous feelings seemed to be turning into reality.Editor\u2019s Thoughts: Finally, Roman has begun to counterattack the strategist of Hector. How will Edwin respond? The next few chapters will be interesting. We will see guerilla operations in action soon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93 - The Shadow Ghost (3)Edwin Hector headed to the barracks and left behind the battlefield. As the barracks were the designated spot where commands were given, all of the commanders under him were also ordered to arrive.\u201cJackson. Report the situation.\u201d\u201cYes, Prince.\u201dThe leader of the Ranger Unit, Jackson, stepped forward.\u201cThe Third Battalion was mobilized to deal with the remnants of Cairo immediately after we dealt with the First Defense Line. However, contact with them has been lost since around an hour ago. At first, I thought there might have been an issue with the magic stone, but seeing that we have lost contact with three battalions, it seems the enemy has initiated the counterattack.\u201d\u201cWhat is the expected damage?\u201d\u201cAround 300 people, Prince.\u201dAs soon as Edwin heard that, his expression turned cold. They had initiated this war with a perfect plan. Nevertheless, the fact that a single variable dealt with their warriors made his heart shudder.\u201cMost of the forces on the Southern Front had locked the gates and chose to retreat. Thus, it could only have been Roman Dmitry who killed Baron McCleary and decided to cause damage to us even in such a situation. The fear seems to have turned into reality. Roman Dmitry chose not to flee to the mountains, but to remain on the Southern Front and fight against us.\u201dEdwin\u2019s voice was chilling. He didn\u2019t like, from the beginning, whenever the name of Roman Dmitry came forward in this war. That was because, from the first time the cog wheel in his plan had gone awry, Edwin Hector kept noticing his name every time a problem occurred.\u201cWe will have to alter the plan. Leaving someone like Roman Dmitry alive will certainly come back to bite us later on.\u201d\u201cCommander.\u201d A square-faced man, one of the commanders under Edwin, continued in a firm voice, \u201cAs the commander has said, a variable that wasn\u2019t accounted for in the original plan has occurred. Baron McCleary is dead, and Roman Dmitry is probably planning to mobilize the remnants of Cairo. Nevertheless, that isn\u2019t important. The Southern Front has 5 Defense Lines along with the rear. With the most important position, the rear, and the First Defense Line in our grasp, capturing the rest of the Southern Front will surely weaken Cairo\u2019s counter even more. We should see the big picture. Instead of focusing on a rat like Roman Dmitry, it is more important to entirely destroy the Defense Lines.\u201dRoman Dmitry was a small variable? Even if he was, if this siege failed and swayed because of him, their entire plan would burn down to ashes. In the next 3 days, they couldn\u2019t give Cairo any chance to counter them. Even if some variables had occurred, they had planned to destroy the defense and choke down the breath of the entire Southern Front within 3 days.That was why Edwin was dissuaded by what he was told. He was the Star of Hector. From his long experience, he knew that he didn\u2019t act normal whenever discomfort kept disturbing his thoughts.Nevertheless, Edwin had already made his decision.\u201cNo. What is important now is not to focus on the Second Defense Line, which cannot even counterattack, but to deal with the variable that has messed up our plan through unexpected methods. Withdraw the troops right now. From now on, we will completely annihilate the rats of the Southern Front.\u201dAs soon as they heard those words, the faces of all the commanders under Edwin were dyed with shock.The Second Line of Defense wouldn\u2019t last long. With victory in sight, it wasn\u2019t easy for all the commanders to follow Edwin\u2019s new command.Eventually, a commander said, \u201cIt is a reckless decision. There will only be a few remnants left. It won\u2019t be too late to kill them all once we have captured the Defense Lines. And how can it be possible for the enemy to turn the tide with such a small force?\u201dThat was correct. Also, it wasn\u2019t like Edwin didn\u2019t know that, but from the moment he received the first report that was related to Roman Dmitry, he didn\u2019t like how the plan was going. It was because of his instincts and senses. Most people say that instinct and common sense are two different things, but, in the end, instinct always originated from common sense. After revising the plan, something that he had already done countless times over the past year, his instincts told him that Roman Dmitry was a risk.Edwin Hector said, \u201cI understand what you mean. Nevertheless, as the commander, I need to be prepared for the worst. And the worst thing I am worried about isn\u2019t failing to bring down all 5 Defense Lines. It is Roman Dmitry, who is doing unexpected things on this Southern Front. We don\u2019t have time. If Roman Dmitry manages to create an unpredictable variable, then the situation will turn out worse than if we are not able to capture the Defense Lines.\u201dIt was a simple matter. Among problems that could be fixed and problems that could not be fixed, Edwin considered the latter as more important. It would be fine if he managed to take down the Defense Lines, but he couldn\u2019t understand Roman\u2019s Dmitry actions completely.\u201cNot the worst, but definitely the lesser evil. If the majority of you all think that capturing the Second Defense Line is a priority, even after hearing my explanation, I will let go of my stubbornness and follow your opinion.\u201dActually, they all knew that Edwin had a good reason to make that decision. Still, the reason they asked him to think was because any human could make a mistake.Everyone nodded, which meant they understood.Jackson spoke for everyone, \u201cWe will follow your words.\u201dNevertheless, did they know that, by that judgment, the Hector Kingdom had set foot in the Southern Mountains earlier than expected, and Roman Dmitry was waiting for them to arrive there?The sun went down. While the peasants went home and had dinner with their families, a bright fire lit up in the darkness.Crackle.Crackle.The bright fire was created when Hector\u2019s soldiers lit their torches.\u201cWhen you find the enemies, do not attack hastily. The topmost priority is to blow the whistle and inform everyone else. The remnants of Cairo have Aura Swordsmen as well. Thus, if we push our enemies into a corner and attack them at once, we will be able to take all of them down without taking much damage!\u201d\u201cWe understand!\u201dThe commanders of the Second and Third Battalions, who were in charge of the search in some places, both raised their voices.The Southern Mountains were wide. Obviously, if one tried to search quickly, one would miss the enemy. That was why they were slowly searching for the enemies. There was a risk of losing one\u2019s life if the enemies appeared suddenly, but simultaneously, the enemies would be surrounded once their location was revealed. That was Edwin\u2019s idea.Rather than wasting time with an ambiguous search, Edwin wanted to wipe out all the enemies in the mountains at once.Crackle.The nearby darkness was pushed away by the fire.The soldiers continued to climb the mountain slowly. They were looking around meticulously, to the point of even checking out the sound of someone stepping on dry leaves.\u201cHaah\u2026\u201dThe commander, who had taken the lead, exhaled his breath and continued to look around with a stiff face. The survivor who had followed Baron McCleary into battle had told him that Roman Dmitry was truly like a \u201cShadow Ghost\u201d on the battlefield. The moment any soldier showed the slightest carelessness, their heads were cut off by him.No matter how prepared they were to fight, even though they had vowed to risk their lives for the nation, no one wanted to die first.Step. Step.When the flame shone in the darkness, the area that couldn\u2019t be seen earlier lit up.\u201cOn the right?\u201d\u201cNothing is wrong,\u201d answered the soldier who was following right next to him. When the commander saw that the soldier was moving while even pricking the ground with a stick, he decided it was safe to turn his head back and continue his own search.At that moment,Swish!\u201c\u2026!\u201dDarkness covered the soldier. Let alone blowing the whistle, he couldn\u2019t even make any movements to call for help. It was because, even though it was a fleeting moment, his neck had already been twisted.The soldier, who had died because of not being able to check properly, made a blunt sound as he fell down. Nevertheless, the commander didn\u2019t hear that. No, it wasn\u2019t just the commander, but the entire Battalion moved forward as if nothing was wrong.\u201cLeft?\u201d\u201cNothing is wrong.\u201dAs soon as he turned his head back again, another death occurred. Once the commander had confirmed that there were no issues, the darkness had again covered a soldier and taken his life.One death, two deaths, and so on.Actually, it didn\u2019t feel strange at first. However, when he saw that the surrounding fires had dimmed down extremely, the commander realized something had gone wrong.\u201cW-what is this?\u201dHis face turned white when he saw there was no soldier behind him. Even when he had started, the surrounding area was brightly illuminated by the fire torches, but now, only darkness could be seen behind him.His heart sank down to the bottom. He hurriedly blew the whistle as he realized that the others had died even though they were walking so closely\u2014No, he tried to blow it.Swish!As soon as he placed the whistle in his mouth, the commander\u2019s neck was twisted. Thus, with a whistle in his mouth, the commander also collapsed, as if he was a doll with a broken thread.Still, that was only the start of it. Soon, all over the mountains, Hector\u2019s soldiers began to die one by one.The secret didn\u2019t last long. The death of the soldiers was discovered soon after a loud whistle pierced the stillness of the darkness and resounded everywhere.Beeep!Beeep!\u201cThe enemy has appeared!\u201d\u201cCheck out the allies! We must cut off the escape route and drive the enemy to one place!\u2019Everyone was obviously upset. All soldiers turned their eyes back and forth to check their surroundings. Among them, there were also Aura Swordsmen who were using Aura to illuminate the darkness, and those who were using magic artifacts. Nonetheless, no matter how many times they looked, they couldn\u2019t see the enemy anywhere.\u201cJust where is he?!\u201dThey didn\u2019t understand how someone next to them had disappeared without even making a sound.Far away from them, there was a man who was covered by darkness.\u2018The judgment of the Hector Kingdom is bolder than I expected. I was initially planning to take full advantage of the guerrilla operation as they focused their attacks on the Defense Lines, but they decided to block a variable first. Who is their leader? The judgment he has made, from the surprise attack to capturing warp gate, is enough to prove he is not an ordinary person.\u2019He suppressed his laughter. Seeing how Hector had reacted to this extreme situation, Roman didn\u2019t panic because of the enemy\u2019s smartness, but felt a fire rise up in his heart.He could see lights all over the mountain. That meant that instead of leading only one battalion to search and deal with the remnants, the enemy commander had decided to bring all the forces he could to deal with the remnants and left only a minimal number of troops who were pressuring the Defense Lines even now.The southern mountain range is steep, and it is a terrain where there are limited places to hide. The commander of the Hector Kingdom was perfectly aware of that, and he decided to boldly abandon the areas where the remnants couldn\u2019t hide and only initiated the search in the other areas. His judgment is amazing.Actually, even Roman\u2019s troops were there at the places the enemy commander had selected, but still, the Hector Kingdom hadn\u2019t expected one variable. They didn\u2019t know what kind of person Roman Dmitry was.The rugged mountains and blinding darkness were factors that didn\u2019t let anyone see even an inch ahead. They limited the movements of both sides, but Roman Dmitry, who had lived as Baek Joong-hyuk, was able to move freely in the dark.\u2018It\u2019s been a long time since I felt this kind of feeling.\u2019How to fight using the darkness\u2014Most people thought that Baek Joong-hyuk was someone who always fought his enemies head-on. Nevertheless, the truth was quite different. Back when Baek Joong-hyuk didn\u2019t have power, to meet his father\u2019s expectations, he had to adapt to living in the gloomy darkness.At that time, there was a name Baek Joong-hyuk earned and was frequently called.\u2018The Shadow Ghost.\u2019He was just like the shadow of a ghost, something that no one could predict the actions of and see.Roman was calmly waiting for Hector\u2019s next decision. And when the darkness finally covered the entire mountain, it became the stage of Baek Joong-hyuk, the Heavenly Demon, and the Shadow Ghost.Editor\u2019s Thoughts: The Shadow Ghost has arrived! The stage has been set, and the prey is in the vicinity. It is time for another massacre for Hector. Also, that was an amazing cliffhanger lol.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 - The Shadow Ghost (4)Among the twelve sons of the Heavenly Demon, those who managed to survive the Bottom Point were then continuously tested for their abilities just because they were the sons of the Heavenly Demon.\u201cBaek Joong-hyuk. You will stay in the Dark Demon Unit for a year from now.\u201dThe Dark Demon was an assassination unit of the Demonic Sect. That unit was set as the stage to test Baek Joong-hyuk out. Obviously, his older brothers were also given tasks one after another, and just like that, Baek Joong-hyuk was ordered to assassinate a member of the sect. Actually, it wasn\u2019t that difficult. He only had to chase down a low-level member who had caused trouble for the sect and escaped. Baek Joong-hyuk was able to take his life only after 3 days after he had taken up the mission.The second mission was more difficult than the first one. The assassination target was a member of the Forces of Evil, and the rumors said he was quite abusive and violent. Baek Joong-hyuk went to him immediately and asked for a duel. The duel was quite fierce. The warrior of the Forces of Evil was able to push back Baek Joong-hyuk without himself being pushed back. Nonetheless, his head was cut off because of a single mistake.Baek Joong-hyuk finished the second mission even faster than the first one. And when the members of the sect saw him return so soon, they commented he was talented enough to run the unit itself.Nevertheless, his third mission was to assassinate the leader of an orthodox sect. Obviously, Baek Joong-hyuk had no chance of winning against him in a face-to-face confrontation. Unlike how he had dealt with the warrior in the second mission, he couldn\u2019t fight openly this time. Also, as he was ordered to finish the mission in less than a week, Baek Joong-hyuk had no choice but to choose another method. That was the point when Baek Joong-hyuk began to learn about the darkness.He continuously followed the sect leader while keeping himself hidden. Once he had grasped all of the sect leader\u2019s routines, he attempted to assassinate him. The plan was perfect. The sect leader had never thought that the assassin would be hiding below the toilet, and he met a humble end like that. In the mission, Baek Joong-hyuk was absolutely faithful to reality in order to survive.As time went on, he came to be known as the strongest of the Dark Demon Unit and preferred fighting his enemies face-to-face, but when he had no strength to stand up while facing his enemies, he knew how to hide in the shadows and used his assassination techniques to the fullest. That was a separate issue from pride. If Baek Joong-hyuk had been a person who held his pride up high from the start, he would have died at the beginning of the tests themselves.As time passed, Baek Joong-hyuk killed a lot of people. In the process, he mastered the assassination techniques and didn\u2019t choose any other means to carry out his missions. Finally, after one year, the Shadow Ghost of the Demonic Sect had killed 38 masters of Murim. A saying originated because of that\u2014one cannot avoid death the moment they become the target of the Shadow Ghost.That was the secret of Roman Dmitry, something the current people didn\u2019t know about.While explaining this operation, when he mentioned that he would face the Hector Kingdom alone, almost all of Roman\u2019s soldiers protested.\u201cAbsolutely not! This does not mean I question my liege\u2019s abilities. As it is my liege we are talking about, I am certain that you can produce results with your skill. Nevertheless, the number of troops of the enemy is too large. The Hector Kingdom has prepared for a full-scale war with its current troops. Even if our liege is someone who is unlikely to get hurt while dealing with Hector, we have no choice but to worry about the worst as we are your soldiers,\u201d said Chris.Unlike Kevin, who was calm, Chris was trying to stop Roman with an exasperated voice. The other soldiers were no different. Even the newcomer, McBurney, had the same opinion as Chris.\u201cThat is an impossible mission. The southern mountains are too steep. It may seem like you can deal with many enemies with a small number of troops, using the terrain as an advantage at first glance, but it isn\u2019t that easy. It\u2019s because of the limited mobility in this terrain. And since there are very few mountain trails around which human passage is possible, it will be easy for the enemies to pursue you. Please, think again.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t seem to accept Roman\u2019s plan. Actually, with less than 200 troops, it didn\u2019t even make any sense to try and deal with the Hector Kingdom.Nevertheless, Roman decided to stick to his plan, which was beyond everyone else\u2019s common sense. What he needed now wasn\u2019t persuasion and changing others\u2019 common sense, but blind faith and his soldiers following the plan.\u201cIf you believe in me, follow this plan.\u201dThat was it. As soon as he heard those few words, Chris went silent. New people like McBurney still couldn\u2019t accept it, but all those who followed Roman were different. Who was Roman Dmitry? He was a man who was beyond the common sense of others. In the process of Roman annihilating the Barco family, and even when he dealt with the Blood Fang, they hadn\u2019t seen only one or two parts that didn\u2019t make sense.And now, Roman had appeared by himself in front of his enemies. As he saw the torches rushing in from all directions, he, once again, surrendered himself to the pitch-black darkness.Crackle!All of Hector\u2019s soldiers lit their torches and moved to and fro to find Roman with the help of the illuminated torches, but they still couldn\u2019t find him.\u2018The Shadow King\u2019s martial arts started with becoming one with the darkness.\u2019Baek Joong-hyuk had learned that in the library of the Demonic Sect back when he was known as the Shadow Ghost. The Shadow King was a person who had left a mark in the history of Murim. At first, he was only a simple thief, but he later learned to use the darkness to his advantage and eventually turned into a tyrant known as the Great Thief. Since then, the value of the things he stole continued to change. Rather than aiming for the pockets of the wealthy, he moved on to the sects and clans of Murim.He stole from those in the Five Great Clans, such as the Namgung and Zhuge Clans, from those in the Forces of Evil, and even dared to set foot in the Hundred Thousand Mountains. If he hadn\u2019t tried to move up from there, the Shadow King would have been able to live like a legend. Nonetheless, fascinated by the abilities, he came to covet the treasure of the Heavenly Demon, and when he tried to steal it, he met a horrible end.The invincibility of Shadow King was mainly because he always assimilated into the darkness. Even if he was right in front of the face of someone, it was difficult to discern that, and even when he stepped on leaves, no sound could be heard. He was truly a perfect hider.When the place that had been illuminated with the fire from the torch until just a moment ago became colored with darkness, Roman moved there.And,Puak!\u201c\u2026Kuak?!\u201cHe attacked the enemy by surprise. The sword that came down from the darkness wasn\u2019t something anyone could easily react to, and the soldiers of Hector only remained wide-eyed as they coughed up blood.\u201cThis!\u201d\u201cEnemy! The enemy is here!\u201dFWEEEEET!!!The whistle rang loudly!They were already aware that the enemy was nearby, so they narrowed the formation around the dead soldier, but Roman had already escaped the moment he heard the whistle blow.\u201cKuak!\u2019\u201cAck!\u201dSoon, screams began to be heard from everywhere. It was from those who were trying to surround Roman earlier. They had thought they had reacted quite quickly, but Roman seemed to appear from all sides and provoke all of them at once.It was a totally new movement. Hector\u2019s soldiers looked around frantically, but while they were trying to protect each other by closing the gap, Roman managed to aim for the gap that was eventually created.\u2018Slowly. One by one.\u2019The Hector Kingdom had set foot on the mountain that was covered in darkness. They would have thought that the darkness wouldn\u2019t have been a big problem for them, but they couldn\u2019t even see Roman\u2019s movements even though they were relying on the light from the torches.The Shadow King\u2019s martial arts didn\u2019t turn his body invisible. Instead, it made him assimilate into the darkness by using the energy around him. Nevertheless, his experience of living as the Shadow Ghost was what helped him the most.The knights of Hector were pissed off. They were those who knew how to use Aura and had taken the lead, but Roman continued to aim for their blind spots even then. Still, he wasn\u2019t moving hastily. The moment they moved away even a little from the line, Roman sent them to the afterlife. As he was blocking the noise with mana, even though a colleague right next to him had died, the enemy did not notice it.The Hector Kingdom didn\u2019t know that right now, there was only one enemy they were facing, and he was moving by himself in the darkness.\u2018The plan isn\u2019t to annihilate all the enemies at once. Nonetheless, killing as many as I can is something I cannot overlook. They will soon start to regret ever stepping foot in this mountain, which is covered in pitch-black darkness.\u2019The night was long. And most likely, the enemy would soon begin to hope that the sun would rise quickly.A knight of Hector, Thompson, gulped. His hands and legs were trembling because of what was going on around him.\u2018What the hell is happening?\u2019He couldn\u2019t understand the situation that was happening right in front of him. Obviously, an enemy was aiming for them from all around, but no matter how much he tried, he couldn\u2019t even feel the presence of the enemy, let alone see him.\u201cThere!\u201d\u201cMove quickly!\u201dHe could only hear the voices of the soldiers, and everyone\u2019s rank didn\u2019t seem to matter now. Whenever they heard the sound of choking and the death of a colleague, all of Hector\u2019s soldiers rushed like crazy toward the source of the sound. The Battalion Commanders couldn\u2019t even control them. When a colleague, who was staying alert right next to them, began to die, anger and fear both intertwined and halted the judgment of the soldiers.Nevertheless,Puak!\u201cKuak!\u201dThe number of corpses only kept on increasing. Even though thousands of soldiers were searching for the enemy, the shadow of death didn\u2019t even show its face to them before it took their lives. Because of that, they were feeling a kind of fear they couldn\u2019t even put into words. Their faces were dyed with terror.Thompson, unable to predict just how many enemies were lurking in the darkness, raised his sword with a tense expression. Beads of cold sweat continued to drop down his head. He had not left his position yet. He moved slowly, and unlike other soldiers, he was focusing on his own safety rather than looking for the enemy. And finally, Thompson saw it. At the rear of the formation, soldiers who were moving began to disappear one by one.Swish!A lit torch went out. Instead of seeing the soldier\u2019s death, he had only seen the torch vanish. Nevertheless, he just assumed that the soldier had died, as his common sense couldn\u2019t allow him to think of anything else. And as expected, a soldier who later noticed his colleague missing whistled as soon as he could, and all the soldiers with lit torches rushed toward that place instantly.And,Swish!Once again, another torch on another side vanished.Thompson took a step back. When he saw just how many torches had vanished, he realized something had gone terribly wrong. He had thought that the Hector Kingdom had the obvious advantage, but the current situation couldn\u2019t even be said to represent the \u2018A\u2019 of advantage.Just then,\u201cThe commander!\u201d\u201cThe commander of the First Battalion is dead!\u201dAs soon as he heard about the death of the commander, Thompson felt his feet were on fire. Although there were so many soldiers around the commander, even he had died. It felt like the common sense he had built up was being denied. He was clearly looking around carefully, but the moment he blinked, the entire scenery changed.\u2018This makes no sense.\u2019He ran toward the commander, but instead of picking up the commander\u2019s body, he picked up the Magic Call artifact that was on him.And,\u201cCommander Edwin! A ghost has appeared here! Please help us! If we stay here like this any longer, we will all die!\u201dThat was a voice that shocked the people on the other end of the call.No\u2026It was more like a scream for help.Editor\u2019s Thoughts: The assassination techniques are here! Edwin needs to send support quickly if he doesn\u2019t want all his troops in the vicinity of Roman to die. Nonetheless, will they be able to stop Roman with support? It was quite interesting to see a part of Roman\u2019s life in Murim. Edwin\u2019s next decision will be interesting as well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95 - The Shadow Ghost (5)Away from the area where a massacre was taking place, once Edwin heard the voice of the Thompson on the Magic Call, he said firmly, \u201cCalm down, Thompson. The enemies are at a numerical disadvantage, and they can only use the darkness to attack. So, be wary of your surroundings and calmly explain the situation to me.\u201d[The enemy has appeared in the area that was assigned to the First Company of the Second Battalion. However, no matter how many times we tried, the enemy could not be seen. On the other hand, the soldiers of Hector are turning into corpses with each passing second. Still, there isn\u2019t even a trace of the enemy visible to us. Commander. H-How do we deal with this? There is nothing we can do against a formless ghost!]Thompson\u2019s voice continued to tremble as he continued to speak. Thus, even though he could not see his face, Edwin understood Thompson was quite pale.\u2018Thompson is an Aura Knight. He can even find the smallest traces because his senses are far more developed than any ordinary soldier. So, no matter how dark it may be, how is that possible?\u2019No, it is impossible.Edwin Hector\u2019s judgment wasn\u2019t that wrong for any normal Aura Swordsman. They had eyes that could even pierce through the darkness. Their eyes, once covered with mana, could determine the location of the enemy even in darkness. That was why Edwin had made the decision to climb the mountain even though the sun was setting.Then, why was Roman Dmitry still not found? From the Magic Call, it was clear that the First Company was currently all over the place, and the remnants of Cairo were around there on the mountain.\u2018Are they using magic?\u2019No, that\u2019s not it. Although there are different types of magic that can make one invisible and even hide them in the open, in the end, Roman Dmitry is only an Aura Swordsman. As he is not a magician, he cannot use magic to hide himself. Then, a one-time skill? It takes quite some time to use it, but it would prove him acting like a ghost in the darkness, as Thompson had said. Nonetheless, the soldiers of Hector are trying to follow him even while others are dying. It means that he has shown himself at least once. But if the one-time use is over, how can he disappear so soon and attack again?Edwin couldn\u2019t understand Roman Dmitry. The more he got to know about him, the more he felt like he was drowning in a bottomless sea. Edwin Hector had experienced many situations in his life till now, but this war has put him to the test from time to time.He couldn\u2019t find an answer. Nevertheless, he said in an unwavering voice, \u201cAs time goes on, the enemy will inevitably reach the limit of his physical strength. From the current calculations, the number of soldiers who have joined Roman Dmitry is less than 200. Thompson. Do not be fooled by the darkness. It is an overwhelmingly advantageous fight, and if you respond calmly, you can definitely find out the enemy. I will begin to lead my troops there. If you all cover each other around the point where the enemy first attacked and shone light by using the Magic Flare, the enemy will have no way to escape.\u201dThe situation is favorable for Hector\u2014That was the conclusion Edwin had reached after calculating things thoroughly. Rather than being swayed by the horror which had unfolded in front of Hector, he looked at the reality, even though the situation was harsh. The signal on the device proved the message was sent to the other side.Nonetheless, just as he was about to move his troops,[\u2026C-Commander! The ghost of Cairo is after me!]From the device, Edwin heard the despair-filled voice of Thompson.Whoosh!Thompson hurriedly raised his sword and looked around. The soldiers close to him were disappearing as if they were never there. And as he saw the darkness gradually approaching him, he was convinced that he had become the target of the ghost of Cairo.\u201cListen to me now, all soldiers of the First Company! Form a defense formation and keep the positions of each other in check! The enemy is after our lives. Do not be sucked into the darkness. Stand back-to-back and fend off the attacks!\u201d Thompson shouted out loud. His arms were currently trembling. Even though he was an Aura Knight, someone who had reached the level of superhumans, something normal people could never even approach or even think of touching, he now realized that, in the end, he was still only human.\u2018There is not only one company here. Since all the allies are close to each other, a defense formation can be easily formed, and with that, the enemy will be completely surrounded in the next 3 minutes at the earliest. Thus, there is no need to be afraid. As the commander said, this situation is in our favor.\u2019Gulp.He hadn\u2019t cut the Magic Call yet. He had fixed it to his waist, so that even if a problem occurred, he could deliver the news to his prince as soon as possible.And just then,Fshh.A fire torch suddenly vanished. That was about 5 meters from where Thompson was, and this time, he managed to see the soldier being dragged into the darkness. He had seen it clearly this time. Soon, the dark presence appeared right before him. Thompson raised his mana as much as he could.\u2018This is the only chance!\u2019Saang!The Aura exploded and seemed to cover everything before him. He even swung the sword toward the area where the soldier had disappeared so that the enemy wouldn\u2019t be able to escape this time.Slash!The wind split sideways. Surprisingly, there was no feeling of something being cut by the sword. Thompson thought he had clearly seen the enemy\u2019s movements, but the only thing he now saw in his vision was the corpse of the soldier who had disappeared. Then, Thompson saw it. The soldier had died without even being able to close his eyes. His expression turned ghastly pale seeing the terrifying sight.\u2018This.\u2019He just noticed that he had moved one step ahead. That meant he had left the defense formation. As even that was too much of a gap in front of a monster, Thompson hurriedly pulled back his sword and tried to go back to the formation. And at that moment, his entire body turned stiff. From the pitch-black space, a being covered in black walked out. Yes, it was Roman Dmitry. And his face, now exposed in the moonlight, was stained with the blood of the soldiers he had killed till now.\u201cSometimes this happens when hiding in the dark and hunting the enemies.\u201dAt the terrifyingly cold voice, Thompson couldn\u2019t even scream. While it seemed that Roman wasn\u2019t moving his sword and wasn\u2019t in a form that would allow him to attack quickly, the blood dripping down his sword told Thompson to not even try to attack him. All the hair on his body had stood up because of the terrifying gaze. Thompson prepared for the surprise attack that Roman would eventually unleash by maximizing the Aura to defend against it.Cak.When Roman stepped on the leaves, a sound was heard. Quite surprisingly, he had not heard that even a single time yet from the being in the darkness, but when he had appeared in front of his eyes, he was finally able to confirm that the existence in front of him was a human being.Roman said, \u201cThe enemy was invisible to the eyes. Still, you had the illusion that if you just found the enemy, you would be able to win. And obviously, you, who had been frightened till then, jumped into the darkness as soon as you saw me. Why did you make such a mistake? Did you really think that if you found me, you could defeat me easily?\u201dGlance!Thompson looked around hurriedly. The soldiers were farther than he had expected. In the end, he accepted that in order to survive, he had to believe in himself.\u2018Let\u2019s try it out.\u2019He covered his ears so as to not be fooled by the meaningless words. And while Roman was approaching him slowly, as soon as he came into his range, he kicked the ground as hard as he could.Tap.\u201cDie!\u201dThe attack was quite fast. He had unleashed all of his Aura at once. It was Aura that transcended the damage a human body could take and seemed as if it would cut through Roman\u2019s body at once. But\u2026 that was just an illusion. Thompson had thought that his attack had worked, but soon, a burning pain struck him and made him realize how wrong he was.Slash!\u201cKuak!\u201dThe blood splattered on the ground. Thompson also collapsed because of the excruciating pain as his chest had been slashed horrifyingly with only one blow. Thompson finally understood that he could never defeat Roman Dmitry on his own. And even though his chest was in such a horrifying situation that he was feeling a pain he had never felt, he jumped and ran away without looking back. Somehow, his desire to survive was holding him together. And he knew that to survive, he had to run away as fast as he could.Thompson began to scream and yell to inform his allies of the situation, but somehow, his voice didn\u2019t seem to reach them, as if a Silence Magic had been cast.Soon,Trip!He lost his balance because of a new horrifying pain. That was because Roman\u2019s sword had cut through Thompson\u2019s Achilles tendon. When he tried to put his hand over it to try and stop the bleeding, even his hand was cut off from his wrist.Tap.Seeing his hand on the floor, Thompson\u2019s face turned into that of a corpse. He tried to drag himself with one hand while shaking and trembling because of the terror that was spread throughout all of his body, but Roman was already ahead of him when he looked back in front.Thompson closed his eyes and accepted his death when he saw Roman stretching his hand toward him. Unexpectedly, he didn\u2019t kill Thompson. Instead, he checked his waist and pulled out the Magic Communicator that was attached to it. He then brought it close to his mouth.\u201cCan you hear my voice?\u201dRoman had finally found Hector\u2019s commander, who was on the other side of the call. Strangely, he didn\u2019t receive a reply from the other side. He had clearly heard Thompson talking to him a few moments ago, but now, there was only a bone-chilling silence on the Magic Communicator.Roman continued, \u201cI know what you all are thinking. You made a plan to attack the Southern Front and distracted the attention toward the frontlines while aiming to occupy the Warp Gate simultaneously. Maybe it is not a plan that was made in a day or two. Although Cairo was careless, your plan was still close to perfect. But why did you try so hard to occupy the Southern Front? Why on Earth did the Hector Kingdom risk the lives of their people, who are starving to death due to the unprecedented famine, to occupy the Southern Front, a place that wouldn\u2019t have given that much profits anyway?\u201dThe fire torches were still burning brightly. The soldiers were also continuing to try to find Roman, but no one could even see him.\u201cThere can only be one answer to that. You wanted to solve the problem of your nation through a war. It\u2019s clear as crystal that you are trying to make a huge deal with the Royal Family of Cairo by taking the Southern Front hostage. If that isn\u2019t the reason, there is no reason for Hector to do this. The reason the soldiers of the Hector Kingdom remained in the rear and were preparing a fortress was to show that Hector was a huge threat to the Royal Family of Cairo.\u201dSmirk.The plan of the enemy was quite perfect, but because of Roman being on the Southern Front, their \u201cquite perfect\u201d plan had now burned down to the ground.\u201cThe problem is that I figured out the plan. You people don\u2019t have much time left. Because Hector doesn\u2019t have that many supplies, no matter how long Hector tries, it cannot last more than three months here on the Southern Front. I have no intention of letting you, the troops of Hector, do what you want. I will endure until the end, and I will continue to crush the plans of Hector as well.\u201dRoman had contacted them intentionally. The Hector Kingdom had little time. They had gone through a lot of trial and error to reduce the margin of error, and they had chosen to occupy the Warp Gate so that they could end the war quickly. Surprisingly, the close-to-perfect plan had now exposed their weakness. If Roman hadn\u2019t mentioned the weakness, they would have thought they still had time to act and contact their nation, but the troops of Hector were being pushed to the edge now.\u2018Anyway, there is no other option for the Hector Kingdom. Because of this call, the truth they have been trying to ignore will make them impatient.\u2019The troops of Hector would finally realize that they could not continue and ignore the existence of Roman now. As he was a being who understood their intentions so clearly, how the hell could they continue to negotiate with the Royal Family of Cairo if Roman stayed alive? If the variable, Roman, wasn\u2019t dealt with soon, their plan would crumble like a sandcastle on a beach.\u2018With this, my goal has been achieved.\u2019Whether the opponent gave up, retreated, or even fought until the end, Roman had now become an unavoidable variable for them. Because of the call, the troops of Hector would surely become impatient and make mistakes.Just then,[Are you Roman Dmitry?]Edwin Hector, the man who had been silent until now, finally responded.Editor\u2019s Thoughts: This chapter was so amazing. Roman continues to be ruthless and even provokes Hector. This has become quite interesting. Let\u2019s see what Edwin has to say. Also, Edwin now needs to use all his troops to try and deal with Roman lol. Maybe we will get the POV of Roman\u2019s soldiers soon. That should be good.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 - The Shadow Ghost (6)Edwin hector continued,[I\u2019m not going to deny it. As is widely known, the Hector Kingdom is experiencing a terrible famine, and other countries are unwilling to provide any more money. That is why we launched an attack on the Cairo Kingdom. We had no choice but to make that decision in order to liberate ourselves from the shackles of debt.]\u201cAre you asking me to sympathize with that?\u201d[No. What I\u2019m trying to convey is how desperate we are. In this war, the fate of the entire Hector Kingdom is at stake. There aren\u2019t even enough soldiers. We will experience a food shortage in around three months, as you stated. Nonetheless, we will not back down. I have no intention of backing down until I obtain what I want, even if Hector has to dig out vegetables from the mountain soil or consume the remains of a deceased comrade.]It was a bone-chilling statement. Edwin Hector\u2019s attitude was resolute enough to even speak of cannibalism as something normal, even though it was something no one should have to experience if they were human beings.On a certain day, Edwin Hector went to a temple. The state of the Hector Kingdom was truly miserable. The ground, which had been dyed golden in the past, was now torn apart due to the severe drought, and children, whose ribs could be seen sticking out on their skin, were staring at the ground. When they saw Edwin, they held out their bare palms and begged him for food.Why did it turn out like this?Edwin Hector, who was troubled every day as he was a person who had inherited the bloodline of the Royals, began to think about a plan to attack the Cairo Kingdom.It was exactly as Roman had expected. His words of the Hector Kingdom being on the edge of destruction were correct. They would have fallen down soon enough, even if they hadn\u2019t initiated a war.[You know my plans, so you must know how I feel. Tell the Cairo Royal Family. If they do not accept the offer, we will fight until the end to get what we want. Do not think time is on your side. If we can\u2019t get anything through this land, we will spread the poison the \u2018Necromancer\u2019 cursed Hector with everywhere on the Southern Front and turn it into a land of death as well.]Edwin had turned the situation around and was trying to bring Roman to the edge as well. He had no intention of returning empty-handed right from the start.[I am Edwin Hector. As the prince of the Hector Kingdom, I am ready to do anything to save my people. Roman Dmitry. What choice will you make? Will you fall down like the Hector Kingdom, which has come to the edge of the cliff of destruction, or make a compromise for the future?]To Cairo, Edwin was surely a savage villain. However, that didn\u2019t matter to him. He would do anything to save his kingdom.[The choice is up to Cairo.]To Edwin Hector, that was the role one who was born into the Royal Family had to bear.The enemy had revealed his name. He was Edwin Hector, who was also known as the Star of Hector. While Roman was researching the Hector Kingdom, that name had come up frequently.\u2018Unlike his incompetent father, he has grown into becoming the backbone of Hector Kingdom because of his outstanding abilities. From a young age, he was involved in the small and huge affairs of the Hector Kingdom and solved numerous problems, and eventually, those who admired the child began to call him the Star of Hector. Even though Hector was in the midst of a great famine, various nations, such as Kronos, wished to get their children married to Edwin Hector. He is a talent that has been recognized both inside and outside his nation. And such a being has taken up the baton in this war.\u2019As he had expected, this war wasn\u2019t being led by an ordinary person.And because of the bold systematic judgment that Roman saw, even he had no choice but to acknowledge the ability of Edwin Hector.The cause was clear now\u2014Edwin was following his role as someone of the Royal Bloodline.He knew that Hector wouldn\u2019t back down so easily, but Roman wasn\u2019t an ordinary person either.Puak!\u201cKuaaak!\u201d[What are you doing?!]Roman had thrust his sword into the thigh of Thompson. And thanks to the sound being cut off, no one else was able to hear it. Roman strongly suppressed Thompson\u2019s body, which was writhing in pain, and slowly twisted the sword to make him scream even more.\u201cWhat am I doing? As you can hear, I stabbed him in the thigh with my sword.\u201d[I\u2019d rather have you kill him! No matter how much we are enemies now, why are you torturing him?!]\u201cWhy am I torturing him? You are making quite an emotional statement. I have no interest in the affairs of the Hector Kingdom. No matter the reason, the Hector Kingdom crossed the border and slaughtered the innocent soldiers of Cairo. So why are you shouting like a coward now that one of your soldiers got stabbed in the thigh? Don\u2019t misunderstand. Just as you care about the soldiers of Hector, my people are important to me. Then why should I show mercy to my enemies? The war has just begun. And you, who crossed the line in the first place, should not expect me to do anything a normal human would do.\u201dEdwin Hector had made a huge mistake. Roman Dmitry was not a normal person. No matter what the reasons or choices of the other people were, he only did what he believed to be right.Puak!\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dThompson yelled in pain. The pain of his bone being pierced wasn\u2019t something he could suppress, no matter how hard he tried. Thus, he screamed.Roman didn\u2019t know Thompson. Although he had no malice toward him, he continued to torture him because they were enemies right now. In the world where the weak served as food for the strong, this was quite normal. No matter what values the other one had or whatever justice they pursued, from the moment they recognized each other as enemies and showed hostility, both sides did everything they could to defeat the other person.And because of that, Roman didn\u2019t have any complicated thoughts. He had no intention of backing down despite Edwin Hector\u2019s threats, so he tortured Thompson.A lot of blood splattered. Because of that, even Roman\u2019s face was now drenched in blood. Then, Roman showed his fierce red eyes as he grabbed Thompson.\u201cAs you do your duty, I will also do what I believe to be right. So, do not get caught by me. I will kill all those who crossed the border quite painfully. I will not spare a single one of Hector\u2019s soldiers, and even if you choose to run away while waving a white flag, I will follow you until the end and stick my sword in your back. My name is Roman Dmitry, and I will definitely make you pay the price for the reason that you touched my people, and not for any grand cause, like you have.\u201dRoman showed clear hostility.The Hector Kingdom didn\u2019t know. The moment they crossed the border, they had touched someone they should never have.As he knew that the Hector Kingdom would have set up multiple camps already, Roman decided that if they didn\u2019t surrender, he would continue to send a chill up their spines.Puak!\u201cUghhh!\u201dFinally, he thrust his sword into the neck of Thompson.Edwin Hector only stood silent when he heard the sound of one of his soldiers\u2019 dying.When Thompson\u2019s head finally dropped, Roman continued, \u201cIf you choose to resist the warning, we will meet soon.\u201dOnce he finished his words, Roman coldly cut off the Magic Call.After the Magic Call was cut, Edwin Hector was only standing coldly while suppressing his anger beneath his expression.\u2018Roman Dmitry. He is a more dangerous person than I thought.\u2019Any ordinary person would have stepped back with the number of threats Edwin had given. Even though saying something like \u201cWe will kill you even if we have to go down with you\u201d couldn\u2019t be done by any ordinary person, the reaction of Roman was even stronger than that. He killed Thompson slowly while torturing him and sending his screams through the Magic Call.Although Roman knew what his circumstances were and his cause, he still sent Thompson\u2019s death as a warning.Roman was definitely a dangerous being. Knowing that he would lose the moment he retreated by even a single step, Roman Dmitry was constantly pressuring him and not allowing him to rest even for a while. He was the kind of person one would never want to meet as an enemy. The only variable that had occurred in the perfect plan which was made by Edwin Hector had now grown incomparably.\u201c\u2026What will you do?\u201d Jackson asked. He was listening to their conversation right from start to finish. Especially when Thompson was being tortured, he could not control his emotions, and his face looked so angry that it would explode at any moment.Edwin Hector said, \u201cIf the Hector Kingdom had continued to spend time without making a decision, eventually, the entire Hector Kingdom would have died and lost the meaning of being a \u201cKingdom\u201d. Thus, I made a decision. All warriors who would give their life for the Hector Kingdom and leftover funds were mobilized for this war. Jackson, we can never retreat. For those who remain in Hector now, the reward we will bring them is more important than our survival.\u201dThat was the harsh reality. Nevertheless, it was a burden Edwin Hector had to bear. Even if a lot of people died, others could not help but feel grateful to be alive themselves. Humans were like that. And even though he knew that, Edwin Hector carried the burden. Taking all responsibility for the war, he left for the battlefield on behalf of the king.\u201cWe cannot go back empty-handed. Mobilize all the troops right now and form a siege on the location where Roman Dmitry appeared. And if you manage to capture him alive, I will cut the flesh of Roman Dmitry slowly myself to avenge the death of Thompson.\u201dSeeing Edwin\u2019s anger and sincerity, Jackson nodded, \u201cI will obey your order.\u201dEven if he died in this war, Jackson would never regret the decision of following Edwin Hector.The operation was now changed. Hector\u2019s Aura Swordsmen took the lead.\u201cFollow me.\u201dThey all had received an order from Edwin Hector 10 minutes ago.\u201cI will no longer be swayed by the remnants of Cairo. From now on, even if we have to make sacrifices, we will punish those beings hiding in the dark. The Aura Swordsmen will take the lead and light the way, and when attacked, soldiers from other areas will surround the enemy at once. It is a battle in which we need to overwhelm our enemies. We will give our flesh and take the bones of the enemy!\u201dHe made his decision. The moment Roman Dmitry revealed himself, with a single attack, the troops would boldly block him and any escape route that Roman could use to escape. It was a strategy that required sacrifices. Being Edwin Hector, he wanted to produce the maximum results with minimum damage, but he changed his mind when he heard how hostile Roman was to him. He had acknowledged his opponent. And in order to catch that monster, he determined that soldiers had to walk in with determination.A bright light shone from the leading Aura Swordsmen, thanks to the magical artifact. The magical artifact generated light when it was supplied with mana, and enemies that touched that light would be temporarily exposed due to the shimmering shards of light covering them.It was a trap to maximize the effect of Edwin\u2019s plan. Because of supplying the artifact with mana, the Aura Swordsmen would not be able to exert their full strength, but someone had to risk their life to bring Roman out in the open. And for that, the swordsmen of Hector decided to risk their lives. They had a strong desire to win this battle, even if they had to become the bait to kill the enemy. Their eyes were fierce.\u201cThere is no one out here! Follow me slowly!\u201d shouted the Aura Knight. As he had taken the lead, the troops of Hector rushed ahead with confident faces. When they were convinced that the unknown fear had been resolved, the search operation that was slow became full of energy again. Nevertheless, it was too early for that. The moment they stepped into the space where no one could be seen, the space twisted, and something reflected light toward them.Slash!The Aura Knights widened their eyes, seeing the blood flowing out uncontrollably, and eventually fell down on the ground.Soon, Cairo\u2019s soldiers, who were nowhere to be seen, suddenly appeared out of what seemed like a mirage and rushed in all at once.\u201cAttack!\u201d\u201cAttack the enemies!\u201d Chris shouted while his neck veins were protruding.When they all had first entered the mountain, Roman Dmitry had foreseen that this would be the case.Editor\u2019s Thoughts: What a cliffhanger! Chris and the soldiers have begun their counterattack now. Roman Dmitry has warned Edwin. How will the Aura Knights fare against Chris, Kevin, and the other soldiers of Roman? That should be seen in the next chapter. Anyway, go, Roman\u2019s soldiers!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97 - The Unexperienced World (1)When Kevin first heard the plan, he watched Chris and others arguing silently, and only asked a question after he conveyed that he was going to follow Roman\u2019s plan.\u201cWhat do we need to do?\u201dThis war wasn\u2019t something Roman could handle alone. It was a good plan for Roman to use the mountain terrain and darkness to deal with the enemy, but the two hundred troops had nothing to do in the meantime. Nevertheless, Kevin wanted to be in the plan of Roman. Chris was no different. Thus, when Kevin asked the important question, Chris added, \u201cRight. I agree that the liege can conduct the operation by himself. The liege already has the ability to pull that off, and we, who cannot keep up with the liege, will inevitably pull you down. But that doesn\u2019t mean we can leave everything to you, my liege. Even if you have to use us as bait, please put us to some use.\u201dThose were words full of concern. Nevertheless, from the start, Roman had every intention to use as much power as he could.\u201cFrom now on, let me briefly explain the operation.\u201dShhhk.He opened a map. It was the map that McBurney had given him. Although it was small, Roman deliberately pulled out that map and pointed out the area at the start of the mountain.\u201cThis operation is divided into three phases. In the first phase, I will use my mobility to deal with Hector\u2019s remnants. Since the Hector Kingdom is preoccupied with attacking the Front Defense Line, dealing with them in the meantime won\u2019t be an issue. In the second phase, if the Hector Kingdom sees my existence as a thorn in their eyes and sends a unit to pursue me, I will lure them to the mountain. And perhaps they will try to take advantage of the overwhelming difference in our numbers and try to deal with me at once. Still, I will prolong the battle, and when the sun sets and darkness covers the mountain, I will use my skills to corner them.\u201dNow, only the last phase was left. The final touch.Roman understood that as soon as they got pissed, even if it was impossible, the Hector Kingdom would pursue him like crazy and make mistakes.\u201cFrom then on, we enter the third phase. A surprise attack using the terrain. That is your role.\u201dOnce the third phase was told, the soldiers understood it was a simple plan. They had to dig a trap, wait, and make a surprise attack on the disorganized enemies. Actually, since it was an operation anyone could think of, the soldiers understood it even though Roman had only told them about it briefly.\u2018A surprise attack in the mountains will yield clear results. Nevertheless, from the moment we appear in front of them, we will not be free from the pursuit of the Hector Kingdom. The difference between Hector and us is too large, and it is virtually impossible to successfully make a surprise attack and escape without any damage. Nevertheless, as it is the command of my liege, I will do it.\u2019No one mentioned the risk this operation had. Everyone was thinking the same thing\u2014Roman Dmitry was going to face hundreds or even thousands of enemies by himself, then how could they act like cowards and mention the risks of the surprise attack? Even if they had to die, it was their choice, and being the soldiers of Roman, they had decided to follow him until the end. Naturally, the feeling spread like a plague, and soldiers who followed McBurney and Steven only remained silent.Their strong will looked quite amazing. Roman was grateful for the soldiers who were ready to dedicate their lives to him, but he wasn\u2019t the kind of person who would make meaningless sacrifices.\u201cIt seems like you all are misunderstanding something. The point of this surprise attack is to reduce the number of enemies while minimizing the damage.\u201d\u201c\u2026That is impossible. The Hector Kingdom will surely form a defense formation and continue to search for us. And unless we kill everyone with the surprise attack, we will be grabbed by the tails when Hector discovers our position. You don\u2019t have to say anything to give us hope, my liege. We all are already ready to lay our lives down for our liege,\u201d said Chris. Even though he was following Roman for a purpose, he was truly loyal to him.Roman said, \u201cNo, there is a way to not get grabbed by the tails. In an old book, by chance, I found something along the lines of \u201cThere are infinite ways to use mana, and depending on how it is used, one can bring Mother Nature on the side of humans.\u201d. Then, during my stay in Dmitry, after a lot of trial and error, I discovered a new branch of Mother Nature.\u201dThe soldiers couldn\u2019t understand what Roman meant. Thus, to make them understand the \u201cPath of Nature\u201d, Roman took a step forward and began to collect things like rocks and branches from the ground.\u201cIt might not be visible to your eyes, but unlike the other stones and twigs, these ones contain a lot of mana. Actually, it is quite less when compared to human standards. But if they are systematically positioned in the right manner, the power of mana that goes against the Path of Mother Nature will twist the space.\u201dTak.He placed the stones on the floor. He then took a few steps forward and placed a branch there.What is he doing?Seeing him repeat the same thing, which was quite weird, a few times, everyone had the same question.\u2018Where is he going with this?\u2019The questions didn\u2019t seem to stop, but just then, the moment when Roman put down the last stone,\u201cI have decided to call this the \u201cTrue Defense Circle\u201d.\u201dSwish.A light breeze blew, and Roman\u2019s figure disappeared like a mirage. Everyone was stunned. They felt like all their senses had stopped working. He was right in front of them just a moment ago, but now, he was nowhere to be seen.They finally became sure. With Roman Dmitry\u2019s method, they could attack their enemies safely.And obviously, Roman\u2019s plan had worked.\u201cAttack!\u201d\u201cFire the arrows!\u201dPapak!The arrows were fired straight ahead. Even if one wasn\u2019t a sharpshooter, they could easily hit the enemy at such a close range. And obviously, the soldiers of Hector soon began to die and fall to the ground. The attack was so quick that they couldn\u2019t even think of raising their shields to block it. The soldiers who had been training hard for this war went down in the chaos, and Chris, who had cut off the breath of the Aura Swordsman with a single slash, didn\u2019t miss the opportunity to move forward.Tap.His sword flashed. As Chris was so fast that he wasn\u2019t even visible to the enemy soldiers, multiple heads soon flew into the air. And even though blood continued to gush out of their bodies like a fountain, Chris didn\u2019t stop.The moment he made the surprise attack, he decided he would grab the opportunity and push as hard as he could.\u201cEveryone, calm down!\u201d\u201cStrike back!\u201dHector\u2019s knights responded. Among them, there were Aura Swordsmen. Auras began to emerge from all directions and attacked Chris simultaneously, but he managed to avoid all the attacks. And then,Puak!Puak!He attacked the enemies\u2019 vital points and sent them to the afterlife.When Chris defeated the 3-Star Aura Swordsman in the Battle of Great Warriors, he was born completely anew. He finally understood that the power of Aura wasn\u2019t everything, and he tried to become even stronger by training with Roman. The beads of sweat that had dropped down his body were enough to create a huge river.Since he couldn\u2019t absorb the teachings of Roman properly if he blinked even for a single moment and lost the flow, he would often stay up the entire night because of training and clung to even it even when he fainted. And the reward? Obviously, he got a huge reward\u2014The Lightning Flash. It was a sword technique one of the top ten beings in Murim had learned by heart. Thus, Chris did his best and learned it by heart as well. And thanks to that, he was now unilaterally slaughtering Hector\u2019s knights.\u201cThis is ridiculous!\u201d\u201cWhere did this monster come from?!\u2019The enemies were stunned. The opponent wasn\u2019t even Roman Dmitry. Still, they couldn\u2019t even hold a candle to him. Screams filled with pain continued to pour out each time Chris moved. Also, it wasn\u2019t just him. The power of the other soldiers of Roman wasn\u2019t any less. As they had learned the Asura Sword Technique, even though they were called normal soldiers, their combat power was way huge. It was literally overwhelming.After slaughtering numerous enemies in a short time, Chris retreated and shouted with a voice filled with mana,\u201cRetreat!\u201d\u201cRetreat!\u201dThat was it. The troops of the Hector Kingdom couldn\u2019t come back to their senses initially because of the surprise attack, but soon, some of them whistled to signal the others. It was a signal that told the others that the situation had reversed.As he heard the sound of the reinforcements coming there, Chris ordered for retreat right away. They had managed to achieve quite a result already. Roman had already told them that this operation was not about killing all of the enemies, but harassing them while making sure they themselves were safe.\u2018We need to move to the next point.\u2019On this wide mountain, Roman had made several True Defense Circles. Roman understood the reality that they couldn\u2019t win against them head-on, so he decided to attack only in favorable situations.All of Cairo\u2019s soldiers ran away like loaches. That was the end of the surprise attack. The soldiers of Hector tried to follow them, but Chris and the others had already disappeared by then.Simultaneously, battles were happening in other areas.\u201cEnemy!\u201d\u201cStop them!\u201dPuak!Kevin had taken over the leading position of Cairo here.Kevin cut off the head of the enemy who was screaming because of being terrified of his actions and then quickly slaughtered the other enemies who still hadn\u2019t recovered from the shock. The aspect of the battle wasn\u2019t much different. As Roman intended, the Hector Kingdom tried to form a siege, even if it was unreasonable, and in the process, the Defense Lines of the enemy were disrupted.Actually, Hector still had the advantage if one followed common sense. Although it was obvious that the side with higher numbers would win in a war of attrition, Cairo\u2019s surprise attack didn\u2019t fall within Hector\u2019s common sense.\u201cDie!\u201d shouted one of Hector\u2019s Aura Swordsmen. Their exploding Aura was the hope of Hector. And the Aura Swordsman, who was about to cut off his head, was rather killed by Kevin first.Roman\u2019s soldiers often called Kevin the \u201cRapidly Growing Monster\u201d. Obviously, they didn\u2019t mean that he was stronger than Chris, but Kevin was actually faster at slaughtering enemies.In this operation, many people asked Roman questions. They were worried that Roman was going to face Hector\u2019s army all alone and that the operations around the mountains were dangerous. However, unlike Chris, who confirmed with evidence in every case, Kevin never asked Roman a question. It was because he trusted Roman Dmitry completely. As it was Roman Dmitry, who had grown so much stronger since the time he had met Kevin in the slums, even though it was beyond common sense, Kevin believed it was possible. That was because of blind trust. Roman\u2019s existence was the very driving force of Kevin.Chris and Kevin brought about the same result. They both slaughtered a lot of enemy soldiers in a short amount of time. Nevertheless, there was something different about Kevin.Clench!Puak!He caught the enemy who was trying to flee by the hair. Then, while dragging him on the ground, he stabbed the enemy countless times in the stomach. Still, those attacks weren\u2019t even aimed at vital points. He was doing so so that the other enemy soldiers would clearly hear the screams. He was inflicting pain on those he caught without mercy. And Hector\u2019s soldiers, who saw that, didn\u2019t even dare to approach Kevin.The Hector Kingdom is our enemy.While standing by Roman\u2019s side, Kevin had always observed how he treated his enemies. In the fight with Barco, Roman had shown pure cruelty to them. And as Kevin had seen Roman do it, he also showed his enemies what fear was.\u2018I follow the values pursued by my liege.\u2019He didn\u2019t catch every single enemy that was escaping. After all, it took survivors to spread the fear to others.Kevin, who had deliberately left a few survivors, immediately sent a signal of retreat when he heard the sound of reinforcements rushing in.Chris, Kevin, Pooky, and Volcan\u2014They all had carried out the surprise attack simultaneously.Volcan was the one who had first taken up the challenge when Roman was recruiting soldiers, and Pooky was someone who had succeeded in manifesting Aura after training in Asura Sword Technique.They all had taken charge of one group each, and then, all four groups attacked at the same time. The operation was obviously successful. Just like Chris and Kevin unilaterally killed the enemies and ran away, they both also managed to do the same.And the news soon shocked the camp of Hector.Editor\u2019s Thoughts: The soldiers of Roman have done such a good job! Kevin was so ruthless toward Hector, just like Roman. That was amazing lol. Let\u2019s see how Edwin Hector responds to Roman now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98 - The Unexperienced World (2)Kevin\u2019s intention worked. He had left one of the enemy soldiers alive on purpose. When that soldier finally reached Edwin Hector, his face was dyed with terror, and he trembled while revealing what he had experienced on the battlefield.\u201cC-Cairo\u2019s camp has magicians in it! They are suddenly appearing from the darkness, where no one should have been, and then started to attack us instantly! Please believe me! It wasn\u2019t a normal surprise attack like attacking after hiding in the bushes! Literally, as if it was all a mirage, they appeared from thin air!\u201dAll of his body was trembling while he was speaking. A demon had brutally killed his comrades. And whenever he remembered the face of Kevin, he kept checking to see if he was behind him.\u201c\u2026Commander. It seems like the enemy had set up a trap,\u201d remarked Jackson. Now, reports were coming that mentioned the enemy had attacked them from all sides. Even though they had the numerical advantage, they were unilaterally slaughtered, so there was a chance that what the soldier had said was true.\u201cJackson. There is no magic that can completely hide someone in this world. There are some Illusion-type magics that can show illusions, but the enemies carried out a surprise attack in at least 5 places simultaneously. The possibility of them using Magic Scrolls is quite low. The Magic Scrolls are strictly managed by the Magic Towers, so there is no way that the Southern Front can have them. Then, there is one more possibility\u2014Cairo possessing an Archmage. Still, how does that make any sense? Why would they put an Archmage on the Southern Front rather than the Western Front?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d\u201cRight. That is impossible. That means what they used was not magic.\u201dEven a normal Mage was several times more precious than an Aura Swordsman. Moreover, most of the Mages were affiliated with the neutral organizations, the Magic Towers.Just like the Golden Bank, the Magic Towers were groups that worked for the benefit of the entire continent. It was well-known that nine out of ten people, who were born with the talent of handling mana, hoped to be in one of the Magic Towers. The reason was simple. The Magic Towers were a literal treasure trove of knowledge, so if one wanted to grow as a Mage, they had no choice but to go there.There were only a few Mages in each country. That was why Edwin Hector couldn\u2019t understand why Cairo would put a great being like that on the Southern Front.\u2018There is something special about Roman Dmitry. He didn\u2019t oppose our attempt to capture the Southern Front instantly but lured us into the mountains with all preparations in place. Maybe this is a trick to buy time. The longer we will stay in the mountains, the more damage our troops will take. The Southern Front will also find a way to relax, and the moment the troops from Cairo\u2019s Royal Family arrive, the tide of this war will be turned around at once.\u2019Edwin looked at the entire chessboard and the quickly-moving pieces. The battle here would be fatal, but Edwin Hector had no intention of retreating.\u2018The moment we retreat and lose our momentum, this war will be over.\u2019Instead of defeating the troops, if we focus on capturing the Front Defense Line, will we be able to achieve the goal? No, it will be hard. Roman Dmitry would gain the reputation of defeating the Hector Kingdom\u2019s troops with only a small force, and that will surely give Cairo a justification to not give in to Hector\u2019s demands. War is driven by force and morale. The moment a hero named Roman Dmitry is born in this war, Hector will be dyed with defeat.\u2018It is too early to go head-on.\u2019Even though many soldiers were dying, he had a goal\u2014Saving the Hector Kingdom. Everyone had sworn to give their lives for that, and Edwin could not let their deaths be in vain.\u2018It\u2019s best to wait. Roman Dmitry will eventually fall into my trap.\u2019Just then,[Roman Dmitry! He has appeared!]He heard those words from the Magic Communicator.Roman Dmitry had finally begun to move.Swish.The darkness was gone. The moment the light from the magical artifact lit up the surroundings, the Aura Swordsman\u2019s face was colored in shock.\u201cKuak?!\u201dPuak!Roman Dmitry was right in front of him. He appeared from the darkness and pushed the sword into his chest before he could even react. Eventually, he began to stagger. However, after he knelt down while blood was flowing out of his body, strangely, a smile spread across his face as he looked at Roman.\u201cCough!\u00a0W-We finally got you!Flash!There was an Aura Explosion! His intensely boiling mana created bright light through the artifact. He was already ready to die. Still, before he lost consciousness, he hoped to place a bell on the neck of Roman in exchange for his death.Flash!\u201cRoman Dmitry!\u201d\u201cRoman Dmitry has appeared! Form a siege!\u201dThe situation turned around quickly. It was quite different from before. That was because they didn\u2019t have any way to catch him as he hid and attacked from the darkness previously, but now, bright light was shining from Roman while he was moving. When the Aura Swordsman created an Aura Explosion, many fragments of light crystal shone all around and shot at many things. Some of them even managed to enter Roman\u2019s body, and even though he wasn\u2019t feeling any physical pain, his body was now shining brightly. The Aura Swordsman didn\u2019t die in vain. And the quickly changing situation, the captains also did their best and linked communications with each other.[Roman Dmitry is moving toward the North!][He just turned the other way!][Second Company! Second Company! The rat is coming there!]In an instant, a siege network was formed. Hector\u2019s soldiers systematically drove Roman back, and no matter how fast he was, he could not seem to get out of the siege. Until this moment, Edwin Hector was prepared for damage and had spread the soldiers far away. But the moment Roman Dmitry was found, Edwin made his men climb up quickly and pressured Roman from the vantage point.He was convinced this was the end. He had spread out an entire net to catch only Roman. And as time went on, the range of the net began to narrow, and finally, forces to face Roman began to emerge. In such a situation, the troops of the Hector Kingdom thought that finally, Roman Dmitry had been cornered. Many allies were lost because of only one person, but it was now only a matter of time before they dealt with the ghost that was haunting them.Edwin had stepped on Roman\u2019s tail. Hector\u2019s soldiers attacked all at once as soon as they saw Roman running away and trying to scatter the fragments of light crystals.\u201cDie!\u201d\u201cI will avenge my comrades!\u201dThe soldiers rushed toward Roman Dmitry while being filled with madness. Roman was a demon who had killed countless of their comrades. The soldiers\u2019 eyes were dyed with fury when they remembered the memory of trembling in fear while not being able to sleep.Huk!Sharp weapons attacked Roman from all sides, and at that moment, Roman\u2019s body darkened. Instead of running away, he suddenly changed his direction and swung the sword at the soldiers.Puak!Blood splattered. The soldier\u2019s body was exposed because of his fury, and he was taken down with one swing. Still, he didn\u2019t stop as he began to cut down all who had attacked him. He was moving so fast that it was hard to see him with the naked eye. Thousands of soldiers\u2019 blood had splashed everywhere. Apparently, they were filled with so much hatred toward Roman that they weren\u2019t careful enough, and were slaughtered by him.Still\u2026\u201cChase him!\u201d\u201cDo not miss him!\u201dThe chase had just begun. All the enemies were trying to bite his tail. Even if several comrades were cut down, even more enemies appeared and chased after Roman. There was no room to escape. He was caught in a perfect net. As time dragged on, the masters of Hector also appeared.Kwang!Auras shone all around. All Aura Swordsmen raised their Aura and ran towards him. Among them, there were even 3-Star Aura Swordsmen, and powerful Aura that ripped through the air was an attack even Roman couldn\u2019t ignore. The soldiers of the Hector Kingdom were convinced that their attacks had worked this time. The captains had told them that Roman was a 3-Star Aura Swordsman, and there was no way he could deal with so many Aura Swordsmen at once.In the situation where flames made of Aura were aiming for him from all directions, Roman instantly exploded his mana.\u2018Heavenly Demon Sword Art; Second Move.\u2019His sword flashed. Mana that rose up wildly collided with the Aura that filled his vision.Kwakwakang!\u201cKuak!\u201d\u201cEukkk!!\u201dThe Aura Swordsmen were swept away in the powerful explosion. Their swords, which were shining with Aura until a moment ago, were cut off, and a trail of blood was left behind as their bodies had been torn apart.The scene that a single blow had created was stunning. Still, despite such a great attack, Roman left the scene without a single gasp. Still, everyone was in shock. They all had realized how formidable Roman was as an enemy. He was completely beyond their common sense, and they realized that even if they grabbed him by the tail, he would kill them.Nevertheless, they continued to follow him recklessly. If Roman was such a monster by himself, what would happen if they missed him and he regrouped with his unit? They didn\u2019t even want to imagine it. Even if they captured all the camps on the Southern Front, Roman Dmitry seemed like a demon who would somehow slaughter all the soldiers of the Hector Kingdom despite that. Everyone succumbed to that feeling. The soldiers of Hector threw away their lives, and they were even prepared to have Roman\u2019s sword on their necks if that could stop the movement of Roman. Even though it was miserable, ironically, it was also a golden chance to kill Roman. This wasn\u2019t being done because of cold and rational thoughts but purely due to instinct.Ten minutes had passed. It was a short time normally. However, the blood of those who had died during that short time was enough to create a river, and with every move, they seemed to be trampling on bodies.Since when?People thought it was weird. It seemed Roman Dmitry, the demon, could be caught in a short time, but why wasn\u2019t he being caught? Then, was he even really running away? The ominous thought that flashed in their mind made their hearts sink down to the bottom.Puak!\u201cKuak!\u201dThis time, as well, he dealt with the pursuing enemy. Roman just wiped off the blood that was dripping down the sword and calmed his breathing.\u2018My stamina is also reaching the limit.\u2019The Heavenly Demon Sword Art wasn\u2019t something Roman could use often with his current body. However, as Hector\u2019s Aura Swordsmen continued to rush in from all directions, he had to use everything he could and exert his strength.Just then, a swordsman who was on the ground with a cut on his chest cursed at Roman.\u201cD-Do you think you can survive here?\u00a0Huff\u2026\u00a0that will not happen. Thousands of troops are coming here. No matter how strong you are\u2026\u00a0Huff\u2026\u00a0In the end, the only way this will end is with you meeting a horrible death here!\u201dHe was furious. He looked up at Roman with bloodshot eyes while screaming.At that moment,Smirk.Roman smirked.Humans are always like that. As it was with Thompson and the others, people fall into illusions in certain situations.\u201cWhy did you think I fell into that trap like that? Even when I saw the Aura Swordsmen coming forward with magical artifacts, why did I kill them and leave my body in the range of the shattering artifacts?\u201d\u201cW-What do you\u2026\u201dThe Hector Kingdom couldn\u2019t imagine it. Roman Dmitry, the bait, had deliberately waved his tail to them and showed them what they wanted to get.The knight\u2019s face was stained in shock. Looking down at him, Roman told him the cruel reality.\u201cThere are a lot of people running around to pursue me. You might think that the siege is perfect, but in the end, there are bound to be loopholes in what humans do. One minute\u2014No, even for 30 seconds, the enemies who reach me first are quite stupid for trying to risk their lives to catch me. How silly is that? The fact that you all are less prudent than ever because you think you have cornered me.\u201dHe knew how reckless this was, but the Heavenly Demon, Baek Joon-hyuk, had always lived like this. He thought backward and was a being who was disruptive.\u201cThen let\u2019s move to where I need to go. There is still a lot of time until sunrise.\u201dThe enemies would soon understand that Roman Dmitry\u2014No, the fact that common sense didn\u2019t work in the world of Baek Joong-hyuk.Editor\u2019s Thoughts: Woah, so Roman is leading the troops of Hector to their deaths. Still, there could also be another fantastic plan lying underneath. Go, Roman! The next chapter will be amazing too.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 - The Unexperienced World (3)The Hector Kingdom was a step behind when they were chasing Roman. Naturally, when they arrived at the scene, they only saw the cold corpses of their allies and Roman standing alive there. The damage was quite serious. A feeling of fear crept into their minds. Nevertheless, that was only the case until the Captain of the Ranger Unit, Jackson, arrived.\u201cThis is as far as you go!\u201dHe directly stepped on the tail. When he saw that Roman was still dealing with Hector\u2019s soldiers, he didn\u2019t delay his attacks and directly manifested an Aura to deal with Roman.Rumble!The Aura erupted like an explosion. And simultaneously, Roman understood that Jackson was a 4-Star Aura Swordsman.Clang!Kaaang!The moment their swords collided, a massive aftershock was created on the battlefield. The Aura that rose from Roman\u2019s sword wasn\u2019t pushed back when it collided with Jackson\u2019s Aura, and Jackson\u2019s face was stained with shock when he saw that Roman had managed to block several of his attacks. It was natural. After all, Valhalla had said that Roman Dmitry was a 3-Star Aura Swordsman. Nevertheless, as Roman had blocked his attacks, he was clearly far superior to a 3-Star Aura Swordsman.\u2018Roman Dmitry is underrated.\u2019He felt goosebumps rise on his skin. Finally, he understood why the soldiers of Hector had been slaughtered like that in the past by Roman. The state of four of the Defense Lines was disastrous, and there was no way ordinary soldiers could do something like stop Roman\u2014Just like what was happening now.\u201cHelp Captain Jackson!\u201d\u201cAttack!\u201dAll of Hector\u2019s soldiers ran when they saw a gap. As Roman and Jackson were colliding with each other, they wanted to aim from behind and fatally wound Roman. They all aimed for Roman\u2019s blind spots precisely. In a fierce battle with Jackson, Roman shouldn\u2019t have been able to look back, but Roman somehow swung the sword behind him without even looking back and was able to defend himself from Jackson\u2019s attacks as well.Puak!With a single blow, all the soldiers were sent to the afterlife. Roman, who dealt with the danger as if it was nothing, slammed the ground and drove Jackson away instantly.\u2018This guy!\u2019Jackson was stunned. Roman had the leeway to deal with the soldiers while dealing with Jackson as well. Although it was disconcerting that Roman was more powerful than he thought, his instincts from experiencing the mountain warfare sent him a warning sign.Jackson was a 4-Star Aura Swordsman. The public only knew that Jackson was the Captain of the Ranger Unit, but they didn\u2019t know exactly how strong Jackson was. That was why Jackson\u2019s name wasn\u2019t there in the rankings of the Hector Kingdom. He had opted for security over fame, and his attack forced Roman Dmitry to become shocked\u2014At least, that was what he believed. Contrary to his expectations, Roman was just calm. Rather than the reaction he had expected, Roman didn\u2019t seem to care much about the fact that the opponent was a 4-Star Aura Swordsman.Although Jackson was doing his best to push away his opponent, the feeling of insecurity didn\u2019t go away. Obviously, Roman Dmitry was caught in a trap, and there was no way Roman could get out of this alive. Yet, how the hell was he staying that calm?\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter what kind of goal you had. The moment you met me, there was no way left to escape.\u2019He suppressed his doubts. This fight was already over. Because of the one minute Jackson had earned,Beep!\u201cThere!\u201d\u201cBesiege Roman Dmitry!\u201dThousands of lights began to shine from behind Jackson. It was a perfect siege. Enemies rushed around quickly.Although he wasn\u2019t captured for even a few minutes, the siege of the Hector Kingdom made Roman hold his breath.\u201cSurrender,\u201d said Jackson wildly. If Roman resisted till the end, he was prepared to take damage and kill Roman. It was ideal for Roman to surrender, so he gave him time to choose.\u201cSurrender? That\u2019s funny.\u201dRoman laughed. Roman wasn\u2019t too surprised that he was a 4-Star Aura Swordsman, as Jackson had expected. The fact that Hector must have had a powerful force on their side to attack the Cairo Kingdom was predictable in the first place, and the opponent being Jackson wasn\u2019t a variable. Naturally, as soon as Jackson appeared, he began to deal with him without panicking. Jackson\u2019s skills certainly weren\u2019t as good as he had thought of them, but it was well within the range he had expected them to be in.On the other hand, Jackson was confident of his victory. The confidence on his face was based on his experience and conviction that Roman was now cornered.Roman smirked when he saw Jackson\u2019s confident face.\u201cEven if I surrender, the Hector Kingdom will make sure to kill me as I am too big a danger to be left alive. Still, didn\u2019t you think something was strange while you were chasing me? Why did I go right into the trap the opponent had laid? Why did I draw your attention while running away in the mountains? There are three reasons. First of all, the fragments of light crystals attached to the body cannot bind me.\u201dRoman raised his mana. As the mana that originated from the dantian circulated throughout his body, the fragments of light crystals attached to his body came off without much effort. It was so shocking that Jackson was truly perplexed. How were they able to catch Roman in the first place? It was because his ability to hide in the darkness was disabled, thanks to the light crystals. However, if that could be solved so simply, the current situation would make no sense.The ominousness in Jackson\u2019s body continued to grow. He feared what Roman would say next.\u201cSecondly, I have the confidence to get out of this siege under any circumstances. You all will see that soon. No matter how much you surround me, you will never be able to capture me.\u201dAnd finally, Roman spoke while gazing directly into Jackson\u2019s eyes.\u201cThe last thing I wanted was for you guys to fall for my tricks and overlook something crucial. Jackson, you\u2019re the Captain of the Ranger Unit. The fact that you, such a powerful piece of the Hector Kingdom, are here means that the defenses of Edwin Hector have been neglected.\u201dAt that moment, Jackson\u2019s eyes widened so much that it wouldn\u2019t be wrong to say they were about to fall out of the eye sockets. His heart also sank down to the bottom. As soon as the ominous imagination in his head appeared, Jackson hurriedly kicked the ground to block Roman\u2019s intention and ran directly toward him.Nevertheless, he was late. As soon as Roman had finished his words, he had kicked a tree and jumped into the air with movements that weren\u2019t possible for a human to do. It was the pinnacle of the footwork techniques of Murim. All those who had made this siege were left behind with their faces looking like idiots.As Jackson saw Roman kick the trees and disappear quickly, he shouted crazily, \u201cDamn it! Go to the prince right now! The prince is in danger!\u201dThe situation was reversed, and Roman had stunned Hector once again.Roman knew that there was a limit to the strategy of gnawing at enemies through a guerrilla operation. At first, it was a lot of fun because the enemies didn\u2019t anticipate his skills, but as talented people like Jackson appeared, he knew playing around anymore would be difficult.Roman was not the Heavenly Demon. If he was Baek Joong-hyuk, the one who had conquered the entire Murim, in the first place, the life of Roman Dmitry wouldn\u2019t have been in danger even if hundreds of Jacksons had appeared to fight him. That was why he needed a new plan that was in line with his current abilities and could ruin the operations of the Hector Kingdom.\u2018There is only one way to end this war with a small number of troops. The Commander\u2014Once Edwin Hector, who planned all this, is killed, the Hector Kingdom will not be able to continue this war any longer.\u2019He then turned his gaze.Edwin Hector was everything to Hector.From then on, Roman intentionally communicated with Hector and instilled fear in his enemies while grasping the flow of mana through the device.\u2018The Magic Communicator is a device that allows people to send their voices to the other end through the connection of mana. If I can figure out the flow of it, I can find where Edwin Hector is speaking from. And if the contact is successful, there is no need to contact him again. If I remember the unique mana flow from the magic device used by Edwin, I can find him out where he is with my skills.\u2019He planned it from the start to the end*.* All of Roman\u2019s plans were thoroughly calculated. He had contacted the man on purpose to grasp the flow of mana and had deliberately thrown himself into the enemy\u2019s trap. Then, he dragged them far away so that once the enemies decided they had cornered him, the powerful people who were protecting Edwin would come forward to take him down. He just gently wagged the tail they wanted to catch. Even though he had the skill to escape from the start, Roman took the risk and dealt with them. The plan was truly reckless but worth trying. It was based on high risk and high return. And on the battlefield, making daring decisions that could change the tide of the battle was a powerful weapon that Baek Joong-hyuk possessed.Chak!The scene around him passed away quickly. It was thanks to the Light Footwork Technique. His body, which was constantly exerting mana, was moving like a beast through the forest to find its prey.He examined the flow of mana and felt that Edwin Hector was nearby. And as expected,\u201cHuh?!\u201d\u201cRoman Dmitry!\u201dHe found Edwin Hector. The escorts around him all looked bewildered and tried to block Roman, who had suddenly appeared, but they all got killed right away.Puak!The wall dividing Roman and Edwin was down. Now, it was time to deal with Edwin Hector. And just as Roman was about to cut off his head,\u201c\u2026!\u201dHe saw that Edwin Hector only had cold, subdued eyes while gazing directly at Roman.When he made the decision to pursue Roman, Edwin said,\u201cPerhaps Roman Dmitry has already dug a trap ahead of us and is expecting us to pursue him. At first, we dealt with him on a whim, but that man isn\u2019t the kind to show up without a plan. Sacrifices are bound to happen in this plan, and even thousands of our men can die because of the trap Roman Dmitry has laid, but even so, we must pursue him. Only one thing\u2014We need a clear result of slaughtering the enemies who have been resisting us till the end rather than being idiots who got hurt when they fought only two hundred troops.\u201dHis heart became cold the moment he set foot on the mountain. The war had already begun. No matter who the opponent was or what they had planned, Edwin wanted to win the war. Besides, the opponent was a monster called Roman Dmitry, which meant that man had to be taken down at all costs. He was sure that Roman Dmitry would come back as a greater danger to them if they left him alone.\u201cRoman Dmitry is like an unbridled foal. He obviously moves with a plan, but we cannot predict his actions. Then we need to focus on one fact\u2014The opponent\u2019s purpose. If I were him, what would the most important thing be? Of course, there is the possibility of trying to prevent us from taking over the Southern Front over the span of 3 days. Nevertheless, if you think about it carefully, there is a simpler way to end this war once and for all rather than digging a trap and reducing the number of enemies slowly.\u201d\u201c\u2026No way.\u201dJackson\u2019s eyes widened. He now seemed to understand what Edwin was saying.\u201cRight. That is to kill me, the Commander of the Hector Kingdom. He may decide that coming here and killing me is easy while our troops will be pursuing him chaotically. It is truly a reckless plan one cannot choose unless they are crazy. Nevertheless, when I felt the hostility that man was showing me through the communication device, I understood that he was someone crazy enough to carry out that absurd plan.\u201dIt was only a possibility. Thus, he wasn\u2019t sure if it would happen. Still, if it did, Edwin Hector decided to use it as an opportunity.\u201cThe soldiers of the Hector Kingdom have laid down their lives for the kingdom. And I, too, will become the bait for the kingdom. If Jackson reveals that I am defenseless by pursuing him, that man will surely think of it as a chance to end this war as soon as he can.\u201dEdwin Hector was reckless as well. Even though he knew how dangerous it was, he was ready to do it to win this war as soon as he could.\u201cThe moment Roman Dmitry appears in front of me, we will have a solid chance to deal with him.\u201dAnd now, as Edwin had expected, the man, Roman Dmitry, had appeared in front of him. It was truly an absurdly risky decision. Edwin Hector had used everything he could to prepare for this, and the escorts had run in faster than expected.Ssshnnggg!Mana suddenly rose from Edwin Hector\u2019s body. Nevertheless, it was different from the way an Aura Swordsman used mana.\u201cInferno!\u201dWheikk!Rumble!An intense flame headed straight for Roman.Edwin Hector, the heir of the Hector family, a child born with the blessings of heaven, was a Mage.Rumble!Bang!Editor\u2019s Thoughts: Wow, that is a painful cliffhanger man. It is now clear that both Roman and Edwin are crazy lol. Still, what amazing plans. It seemed Roman had the upper hand, but then Edwin actually had planned it out and had prepared for Roman beforehand. It will be interesting to see what else Edwin has prepared to fight Roman. The next chapter will be so good!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 - The Unexperienced World (4)The heat was so fierce that it seemed to cover the entire world. The flames from Edwin Hector\u2019s hands had spewed out in all directions as if they were from a dragon\u2019s breath.Crackle!Fsshhhh!The heat was strong enough to melt one\u2019s skin the moment it touched them.Roman turned away from that. Although he was running at quite a speed, he stopped instantly and aimed his attack on one side of Edwin Hector while avoiding the heat.\u201cHow dare you?!\u201dEdwin\u2019s eyes gleamed blue.Memorize!The magic circle he had engraved beforehand to prepare for Roman Dmitry\u2019s appearance instantly appeared.\u201cEntangle!\u201dPak!Papak!The ground rose. The seeds of the plants buried in the soil germinated at an incredible speed and became trees with trunks as large as a human and grabbed Roman\u2019s body. It was like a giant anaconda had caught Roman. The tree trunks, which moved as if they were living creatures, possessed the powerful strength to even destroy a human body within a few seconds.One by one, the trees attacked Roman to take his life. Nonetheless, Roman raised his mana and cut down the trunks instantly, but just then, a powerful shock arose right next to Roman.Kwang!Rumble!\u201cHow dare you touch the prince!\u201dHe had seen a man as strong as him for the first time in his life. He seemed to be middle-aged.Wearing a robe to hide his face, he pushed Roman away strongly while his mustache continued to flutter because of the wind. His sword continued to show an explosive Aura that was threatening Roman\u2019s life with every attack. It was different from the Aura Jackson used. This man\u2019s Aura was so intense that it even distorted the surrounding atmosphere, and it was powerful enough that Roman hadn\u2019t experienced anything like it before in this world.That man was a 5-Star Aura Swordsman named Butler, and he was the leader of the Royal Knights. He was also ranked second in Hector\u2019s Rankings.Butler coming here meant that Hector really was doing everything they could to win the war against Cairo.\u201cYou cannot run anymore!\u201dKwang!Kwakwang!Butler\u2019s Aura exploded as it pushed Roman, and the forest around them shook. It wouldn\u2019t have been strange to say that the strong and swift attacks were good enough to behead Roman soon. Also,\u201cWind Blade!\u201dSwish!Edwin Hector didn\u2019t miss the opportunity. The wind that blew from his hand turned into a blade and attacked the gaps that arose because of Butler\u2019s relentless attacks. Their combo was truly an unstoppable attack. Even Edwin had thought Roman couldn\u2019t survive this.Swish!In an instant, Roman threw himself far away. After dodging the Wind Blade, he immediately raised his head back up and continued responding to Butler\u2019s attacks, who had already rushed toward him.Kwang!His head trembled. Edwin Hector had dug a perfect trap. He had disguised his defense by showing him that the escorts had run to Roman recklessly, but actually, he already had Butler on standby.No matter how much Roman Dmitry crawls and flies, he will not be able to withstand the combined attacks of a 4-Circle Mage and a 5-Star Aura Swordsman.This trap was beyond common sense. Just as Roman Dmitry had done before, Edwin Hector also attempted an attack that was beyond common sense. He believed that with this, he could finally take Roman\u2019s breath away.Roman\u2019s head was spinning frantically. He was continuously feeling a repulsive energy because of his opponents\u2019 non-stop combined attacks.\u201cPtui!\u201dHe even spat out blood. Nonetheless, with Butler rushing toward him even at that instant, he couldn\u2019t lose his focus for even a single moment.\u2018As expected, they are fully prepared.\u2019Before he had made the attack, he had a gut feeling. Edwin Hector was a being who pretended to be someone ordinary even though he had raging mana within him. Thus, he knew Edwin Hector had dug a trap. Still, he followed his opponent\u2019s intention. Even though he knew that there was a trap, he appeared and attacked Edwin.Why?Why did he make such a reckless choice?It was because he wanted to see it. In his life as Roman Dmitry, he had not yet seen anything that could be called a real crisis. Blood Fang, Barco, and even the guerrilla operation\u2014In the life of Baek Joong-hyuk, all those things could be considered ridiculously easy.As his heart was drenched in comfort, Roman deliberately came out and put himself on the line of death to test himself.Kwang!He blocked the attack. Still, a 5-Star Aura was so powerful that it shook his insides. Roman Dmitry\u2019s body had become stronger thanks to him experiencing the Skeletal Metamorphosis, but it wasn\u2019t yet at the level to take on a 5-Star Aura. Furthermore, Butler\u2019s sword technique was smooth and systematic. It showed how long he had trained in that sword technique, and he wasn\u2019t allowing Roman to take a break.Kwang!Kakang!Sparks flew everywhere. As the Auras collided, a strong shock swept through the surroundings. At that moment, Roman felt terrified. He could feel the mana rushing toward him once again. Naturally, he realized that the combo attacks hadn\u2019t ended yet.Swish!Wind Blade!The blade made of wind flew past him.Blood splattered on his face, and Butler approached him while wielding his sword. The situation made him go out of breath. Roman\u2019s stamina was reaching the limit due to the successive attacks, yet he looked straight into Butler\u2019s eyes with an icy-cold and threatening gaze.\u2018Heavenly Demon Sword Art; Third Move.\u2019The mana within his dantian trembled. Suddenly, a powerful explosion was created. Mana shone in all directions as if an active volcano was exploding, and the manifested Aura attacked Butler terrifyingly.\u201c\u2026.!\u201dKwakwang!The power of the attack was literally incredible.Seeing the attack ripping through the air like butter, Butler hurriedly raised his sword and manifested an Aura with all his might. Yet, he wasn\u2019t able to completely block the attack. Blood flowed out of his nose as he bounced off the ground. Nonetheless, that was all. Although it was quite a shock, he had not collapsed.\u201c\u2026Just where did this monster even pop up from?\u201dHis voice trembled. Edwin, a 4-Circle Mage, and he, a 5-Star Aura Swordsman, had attacked Roman relentlessly. Even if the opponent was a 5-Star Aura Swordsman equal to Butler, they would have been dead by now, but the current situation was different from what he had imagined. Roman\u2019s violent counterattack had entirely shattered the plan they had drawn in their heads. Furthermore,\u2018Roman Dmitry is still in his mid-twenties.\u2019He felt goosebumps rise on every single part of his body. He had reached the level of 5-Star when he was in his fifties, but his opponent was already able to counter such a power? How was this even possible? Nonetheless, Butler felt fortunate. It was because he managed to meet Roman Dmitry now. It was like a golden chance to deal with the monster that belonged to the Cairo Kingdom and would threaten them in the future. As of now, Roman was still not at a level to defeat him. Also,Glance.He saw Edwin Hector. He noticed that Edwin, who had raised his mana violently, had a stiff expression.\u201cNow it really is over. Break! Hold!\u201dThat was Double Casting.The mana instantly swept over Roman.Break was a magic that destroyed the target with a strong pressure. On the other hand, Hold was a magic that suppressed the target and made them unable to move.Both of the spells had clear purposes. The first one would break Roman\u2019s sword, and while the second one held him down, Butler would end his life with an attack while he was defenseless and couldn\u2019t move. Edwin also knew that Roman didn\u2019t have the Magic Immune artifact. Because of the momentary gaps that Roman had revealed, he would now die.\u2018Roman Dmitry doesn\u2019t seem to have the aura of any magic artifact. Therefore, there is no way he can stop this attack.\u2019He was certain. However, an unbelievable thing happened just then,Swish!Roman moved and avoided Butler\u2019s attack! Furthermore, even his sword looked fine!When Edwin saw there was no effect of \u201cHold\u201d,Flinch!Roman instantly counterattacked. Naturally, blood splattered on the face of Butler. It was an unexpected counter, so he couldn\u2019t even react.None of them knew Roman\u2019s secret. The moment Edwin Hector used magic, Roman immediately understood what his opponent was thinking.\u2018He\u2019s trying to suppress me with magic power.\u2019He felt the force of Hold penetrate his body and suppress his muscles. Magic was a force he had experienced for the first time in his life as Roman, and he had also studied a lot about it. \u201cThe Intangible Force; The realm of Gods that allows one to create something out of nothing\u201d\u2014That was what the books said.There was no magic in Murim. However, he knew about the realm of magic, which was similar but also different.In the last 6 months, Roman had sincerely prepared for war. He had started to research magic, thinking that he might meet Mages on the battlefield, and was able to get desired results.\u2018Magic and Witchcraft are different, but their fundamentals aren\u2019t so different. Like Witchcraft, Magic is based on mana and tries to infiltrate one\u2019s body and attack them with mana. Thus, as long as I use the Heavenly Demon Godly Art and remove it instantly, it should be enough.\u2019That wasn\u2019t as simple as it sounded. Mana penetrated the body with the intention of never being forced out of it, but Roman\u2019s mana management ability was at its peak. It was because he was Baek Joong-hyuk.Without any special effort, the mana stored in Roman\u2019s dantian moved and evaporated the power of Hold. Also, Break wasn\u2019t a concern. That was because Roman\u2019s sword wasn\u2019t one that would be broken down by magic like that. He had gone through hell and repetitively subjected his body to flames to make this sword after he had given up Salamander.Edwin\u2019s spells of magic were broken. Obviously, Roman didn\u2019t prepare for the war while thinking that Edwin was going to be his opponent. Before the war, Roman had just prepared for all possible variables.The unexpected situation made Edwin and Butler utterly shocked. Obviously, Roman didn\u2019t miss that gap.Pak!\u201c\u2026!\u201dHe dug into the gap in an instant. This time, Butler couldn\u2019t even move. By the time he came back from the shock and tried to catch Roman, Roman\u2019s sword had already decapitated Edwin Hector.Swish!The attack was perfect. Edwin\u2019s head was now in the air\u2014No, it should have been. Nonetheless, magical power didn\u2019t allow that.\u201cBlink!\u201dWith the spell \u2018Blink\u2019, Edwin Hector\u2019s body disappeared from where it originally was. He reappeared a little further from where Roman was. Nevertheless, his face was ghastly pale as he had overused his magical prowess.\u201cFucking bastard!\u201dButler\u2019s emotions exploded when he saw that his prince had almost died. He manifested an Aura that was incomparable to before and rushed ahead with the momentum to kill Roman at any cost.Also,FWEEEEET!!!Whistles could be heard from every direction. The troops who were chasing Roman seemed to have finally arrived.With Jackson rushing toward him frantically, Roman judged he had to make a decision quickly.\u2018If I stay here any longer, I will die.\u2019He saw Edwin Hector far away from him. Then, he said, \u201cRemember this. I will catch you. If I meet you next time, you will not be able to survive like today.\u201dOnce he finished his words, he kicked the ground and moved away instantly. Even Butler was left speechless when he tried to reach for the space that was filled with darkness, where Roman had disappeared, but couldn\u2019t even find Roman\u2019s traces. It was thanks to the Shadow King\u2019s martial arts. The other troops tried to quickly find Roman by lighting up the darkness with torches, but there was no way Roman would be found so easily.Eventually, everyone stopped in their spots. Seeing the darkness they could never dare to step in and the crazy situation in front of them, they only had one thought.\u2018This is Hector\u2019s defeat.\u2019That was an unacceptable reality, and even more so for Edwin Hector, who had lived his life being acknowledged by everyone he met. Naturally, he could hardly take his eyes off the darkness Roman had disappeared into a few moments ago.Editor\u2019s Thoughts: This was like one of the best chapters yet in The Heavenly Demon Can\u2019t Live a Normal Life. Technically, Roman is already stronger than Butler as he was countering both his and Edwin\u2019s attacks combined! Also, this is chapter 100, so we have come quite far lol. Thank you for the continued support, everyone! How do you all think The Heavenly Demon Can\u2019t Live a Normal Life is going?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
