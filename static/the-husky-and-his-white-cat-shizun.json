    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBefore Mo Ran became the Emperor, there were always people who called him a dog.The shopkeeper called him a dog son, the customers called him a dog cub, his cousin called him a dog thing, and his mother was the most powerful, calling him a son of a bitch.Of course, there were always some descriptions related to dogs, so it wasn't too bad.For example, his brief love affairs were always accompanied by a bit of fake anger. They were angry that his waist was as strong as a male dog's, that his sweet words seduced people's souls, and that the weapon under his body took Qingqing's life, but in the blink of an eye, they would show off to others, causing everyone in the courtyard to know that he, Mo Weiyu, was a handsome man with a powerful weapon. Those who had tried were full of greed, but those who had not tried were relaxed and shaken.It had to be said that these people were right, Mo Ran was indeed like a silly dog wagging its head and tail.It wasn't until he became the Emperor of the Cultivation World that these kinds of names suddenly disappeared.One day, a small immortal sect from a faraway place gifted him a puppy.The dog was grey and white, with three clusters of fire on its forehead, a bit like a wolf.But it was only the size of a melon. It also had a melon head and a melon brain. It was fat and round, but it still thought it was very impressive. It ran madly all over the main hall. Several times it wanted to climb the high steps to see the person sitting calmly on the emperor's throne. But because its legs were too short, it failed every time.Mo Ran stared at the puppy that had strength but no brain, and suddenly laughed. As he laughed, he scolded in a low voice, \"Dog thing.\"The little puppy quickly grew into a big dog, the big dog became an old dog, and the old dog became a dead dog.Mo Ran closed his eyes, then opened them again. His life had been full of ups and downs, ups and downs, and 32 years had passed.He was tired of playing with everything, and felt bored and lonely. In these years, the people he was familiar with were getting fewer and fewer, and even the three fires had died. He felt that it was about time to end it.From the fruit platter, he picked a sparkling and plump grape, and slowly peeled off the purple skin.His movements were calm and skillful, like the Qiang King in the tent stripping off Hu Ji's clothes, with a bit of laziness.The green and lustrous flesh trembled slightly on his fingertips, and the juice seeped out. The purple color was faint, like the rosy clouds of a goose, like a begonia sleeping in spring.It also looked like dirty blood.He swallowed the sweetness in his mouth and looked at his fingers. Then, he lazily opened his eyes.He thought that it was about time.It was time for him to go to hell.Mo Ran, also known as Weiyu.The first monarch of the Cultivation World.Being able to sit in this position was not easy. Not only did it require outstanding spells, but it also required a thick skin that was as solid as a rock.Before him, the Ten Great Sects of the Cultivation World were on par with each other.The sects kept each other in check, and no one could change the world on their own.What's more, the Sect Leaders were all outstanding talents who had read a lot of classics. Even if they wanted to confer a title to themselves for fun, they would also have misgivings about the Historian's Pen, afraid that they would be cursed for a thousand years.But Mo Ran was different.He was a hooligan.In the end, he did what others didn't dare to do.He drank the best wine in the world, married the most beautiful woman in the world, and became the leader of the Immortal Cultivation World, the \"Emperor Ta\", and then proclaimed himself an emperor.Tens of thousands of people knelt down.All those who were not willing to kneel were killed by him. During the years when he ruled the world, the Cultivation World could be said to be filled with blood and grief.Countless righteous people met their deaths. One of the Ten Great Sects, the Confucian Wind Sect, was completely annihilated.Later on, even Mo Ran's teacher couldn't escape the clutches of the devil. He was defeated in a duel with Mo Ran and was taken back to the palace by his beloved disciple. No one knew where he went.What was originally a peaceful and peaceful country suddenly turned into a foul atmosphere.Dog Emperor Mo Ran didn't read many books, and he was a person who didn't care about taboos. Therefore, during his reign, absurd things happened one after another. Let's talk about the era name.During the first three years of his reign, the era name was \"Bastard\". He thought of it while sitting by the pond and feeding the fish.During the second three years, the era name was \"Gua\". It was because he heard the croaking of frogs in the courtyard in the summer. He believed that this was a heaven-sent inspiration that he couldn't waste.The knowledgeable people thought that there wouldn't be an era name more terrible than \"Bastard\" and \"Gua\". However, they still didn't know anything about Mo Weiyu.During the third three years, the local areas began to stir. Whether it was Buddhist Cultivators, Dao Cultivators, or Spirit Cultivators, those Jianghu righteous people who couldn't stand Mo Ran's tyranny began to revolt one after another.Therefore, this time, Mo Ran seriously thought for a long time. After countless drafts, an earth-shattering era name was born \u2014 \"Halberd End\".The meaning was good. Shi Huang racked his brains to come up with these two words. They took the good intention of \"ceasing hostilities\".However, when people talked about it, it was awkward.Especially for those who couldn't read, it was even more awkward.The first year was called \"Halberd End First Year\". No matter how you listened to it, it sounded like \"Chicken Ba Round Year\".The second year was called \"Chicken Ba Two Years\".\"Chicken Ba Three Years\".There were people who cursed behind closed doors, \"This is ridiculous! Why don't they call it\" Halberd End Year \"!In the future, when you see a man, you don't have to ask him how old he is. Just ask him how old he is!A hundred-year-old man is called a hundred-year-old chicken! \"After enduring for three years with great difficulty, the era name \"Halberd End\" was finally coming to an end.Everyone in the world was waiting for His Majesty the Emperor's fourth era name in fear. However, this time, Mo Ran wasn't in the mood to take it. This was because in this year, the world of cultivation finally broke out in all directions.The Jianghu righteous people and Xianxia heroes who had endured humiliation for nearly ten years finally joined forces and formed a vast and mighty army of a million to force Emperor Mo Weiyu out of the palace.The world of cultivation didn't need an emperor.Especially not such a tyrant.After several months of bloody expeditions, the rebel army finally arrived at the foot of the peak of life and death.This steep mountain in the middle of Shu was surrounded by clouds and fog all year round. Mo Ran's palace stood majestically at the peak.The arrow was nocked on the string. There was only one last strike left to overthrow the tyranny.However, this strike was also the most dangerous. Seeing the dawn of victory, the allied army, which was originally a common enemy, began to have different thoughts within themselves.The old Emperor had fallen, and a new order had to be established. No one wanted to waste their strength at this time, so no one was willing to be the vanguard and take the lead to attack the mountain.They were all afraid that this cunning and ruthless tyrant would suddenly descend from the sky and reveal his beast-like shining white teeth. He would rip open the stomachs of those who dared to besiege his palace and tear them into pieces.Someone's expression was solemn. He said, \"Mo Weiyu's mana is profound and his character is sinister. We should be cautious and not fall into his trap.\"All the generals agreed.However, at this time, an extremely handsome young man with an arrogant and extravagant face walked out.He wore a silver-blue light armor, a lion's head belt, a high ponytail, and an exquisite silver hairpin at the bottom.The young man's expression was very ugly. He said, \"We're already at the foot of the mountain, and you're still dawdling here and not willing to go up. Don't tell me you want to wait for Mo Weiyu to climb down himself?What a bunch of cowardly trash! \"As soon as he said that, the people around him exploded.\"Young Master Xue, what are you saying?What do you mean by cowardly?Every military strategist should be cautious.If we're all like you, who will take responsibility if something happens? \"Immediately, someone mocked, \"Haha, Young Master Xue is the God's favored one, and we're just ordinary people. Since the God's favored one can't wait and wants to fight with the Emperor of the Human Realm, then you might as well go up the mountain first.We'll set up a banquet at the foot of the mountain and wait for you to take Mo Weiyu's head. Wouldn't that be better? \"These words were said more and more vehemently.An old monk in the allied army hurriedly stopped the young man who was about to explode. He changed into a gentleman's face and advised in a gentle voice.\"Young Master Xue, please listen to this old monk. This old monk knows that you and Mo Weiyu have a deep personal grudge.However, the matter of forcing him to abdicate is very important. You must think for everyone and not let your emotions affect your decisions. \"The \"Young Master Xue\" who was the target of public criticism was called Xue Meng. More than ten years ago, he was a young talent who was flattered by everyone, a God's favored one.However, as time passed and circumstances changed, he had to endure these people's ridicule and mockery just to go up the mountain and see Mo Ran one last time.Xue Meng was so angry that his face twisted and his lips trembled. However, he still tried to restrain himself and asked, \"Then, how long are you going to wait?\"\"At least wait and see what happens.\"\"That's right. What if Mo Weiyu has an ambush?\"The old monk who tried to smooth things over also advised, \"Young Master Xue, don't be anxious. We're already at the foot of the mountain, so it's better to be careful.In any case, Mo Weiyu is already trapped in the palace and can't go down the mountain.He's now an arrow at the end of its flight and can't do anything. Why should we act rashly just because of a moment of urgency?There are so many people at the foot of the mountain, and so many nobles. If they lose their lives, who will take responsibility? \"Xue Meng was suddenly furious. \"Responsibility?Then let me ask you, who can take responsibility for my master's life?Mo Ran has imprisoned my master for ten years!A whole ten years!My master is on the mountain right now, how can I wait? \"Hearing Xue Meng mention his master, everyone's expressions became somewhat unsightly.Some revealed ashamed expressions, while others glanced left and right in silence.\"Ten years ago, Mo Ran proclaimed himself Emperor Ta. Not only did he slaughter the seventy-two cities of the Confucian Wind Sect, he also wanted to destroy the remaining nine sects.Later on, Mo Ran declared himself emperor and wanted to exterminate all of you. Who stopped him in the end during these two calamities?If not for my master risking his life to protect you, would you still be alive?Would you still be standing here and talking to me? \"In the end, someone coughed dryly and said gently, \"Young Master Xue, please don't be angry.We \u2026 all feel guilty about Grandmaster Chu's matter, but we also feel grateful.But just as you said, he's been imprisoned for ten years. If anything had happened to him, he would've long since \u2026 that's why you've waited for ten years. Why are you in such a hurry? Don't you think so? \"\"Right?Go f * ck yourself! \"That person's eyes went wide. \"How can you curse us?\"\"Why shouldn't I curse you?My master didn't die because he wanted to save people like you \u2026 like you \u2026 \"He couldn't go on. His throat was choked with emotion. \"I feel bad for him.\"At this point, Xue Meng suddenly turned his head away. His shoulders were trembling as he held back his tears.\"We never said we wouldn't save Grandmaster Chu \u2026\"\"That's right. Everyone remembers Grandmaster Chu's kindness in their hearts. Young Master Xue, your words are really giving everyone an ungrateful label. We can't bear it.\"\"But then again, isn't Mo Ran also Grandmaster Chu's disciple?\"Someone said softly, \"If you ask me, as the master, he should take responsibility for his disciple's wrongdoings. As the saying goes, it's the father's fault if the son doesn't teach properly.This is something to be blamed for, so what's there to complain about? \"This was a bit harsh. Someone immediately stopped him. \"What nonsense are you spouting?Watch your mouth! \"Then he turned his head and tried to persuade Xue Meng with a pleasant expression.\"Young Master Xue, don't be anxious \u2026\"Xue Meng abruptly interrupted him. His eyes were about to pop out of their sockets. \"How can I not be anxious?It's easy for you to say that, but that's my master!Mine!I haven't seen him for so many years!I don't know if he's dead or alive. I don't know how he's doing. Why do you think I'm standing here? \"He panted, his eyes red. \"Do you think that if you wait like this, Mo Weiyu will come down the mountain and kneel in front of you and beg for mercy?\"\"Young Master Xue \u2026\"\"Other than my master, I don't have anyone close to me in this world.\" Xue Meng broke free from the old monk's hold and said hoarsely, \"If you don't go, I'll go by myself.\"After saying this, he went up the mountain alone with his sword.The cold and damp wind was mixed with thousands of leaves and thousands of voices. In the thick fog, it was like countless ghosts whispering in the forest.Xue Meng walked to the top of the mountain alone. Mo Ran's majestic palace was lit with peaceful candlelight in the night.He suddenly saw three tombs erected in front of the Tower of Babel. When he walked closer, he saw that the first tomb was covered with grass. On the tombstone, the words \"Tomb of Empress Qingzhen Chu Ji\" were crookedly carved.Opposite this \"Steamed Empress\" was the second tomb. It was a new tomb that had just been covered. On the tombstone, the words \"Tomb of Empress Song\" were carved.\"\u2026\"If it was more than ten years ago, Xue Meng would have laughed out loud when he saw this absurd scene.At that time, he and Mo Ran were under the same master. Mo Ran was the disciple who was the best at joking. Even though Xue Meng had long disliked him, he would still be amused by him from time to time.He didn't know what the hell this \"Steamed Empress\" and \"Empress Roasted Empress\" meant. It was probably the tombstones that Great Scholar Mo set up for his two wives. The style was so similar to the words \"tortoise\", \"quack\" and \"halberd\".But why did he give his empresses these two posthumous names?He didn't know.Xue Meng looked at the third tomb.Under the night sky, the tomb was open. There was a coffin lying inside, but there was no one in the coffin. The tombstone was also dark.In front of the tomb, there was a pot of Pear Blossom White, a bowl of cold Wontons in chili oil, and a few spicy side dishes. These were all Mo Ran's favorite dishes.Xue Meng stared blankly for a while. Suddenly, he was shocked. Could it be that Mo Weiyu didn't want to resist and had already dug his own grave and decided to die?Cold sweat dripped down.He didn't believe it.Mo Ran was a person who always fought to the end. He never knew what exhaustion was, what giving up was. With his way of doing things, he would definitely fight to the death with the rebel army. How could he \u2026In these ten years, Mo Ran stood at the peak of power. What did he see and what happened?No one knew.Xue Meng turned around and disappeared into the night sky. He strode towards the brightly lit Wu Mountain Palace.In the Wu Mountain Palace, Mo Ran's eyes were closed. His face was pale.Xue Meng guessed correctly. He was determined to die.The tomb outside was dug for himself.Two hours ago, he used the Teleportation Technique to send away his servants. He took the poison himself.His cultivation was very high. The effect of the poison was very slow in his body. Because of this, the pain of his internal organs being eaten away was very clear.With a creak, the door opened.Mo Ran didn't raise his head. He only said hoarsely, \"Xue Meng.It's you, right? You came? \"On the golden bricks in the palace, Xue Meng stood alone. His ponytail was scattered. His light armor flashed.His former sect mates were reunited.Mo Ran didn't have any expression. He sat on the side with his chin propped up. His thin and thick eyelashes drooped down in front of his eyes.Everyone said that he was a ferocious demon with three heads and six arms. But he was actually very good looking. The curve of his nose was gentle. His lips were thin and moist. He was born with a gentle and sweet appearance. Just by looking at his appearance, anyone would think that he was a good person.Xue Meng saw his expression and knew that he had taken the poison.He didn't know what to feel. He wanted to say something but stopped. In the end, he clenched his fists and only asked, \"Where's Shizun?\"\"\u2026 \u2026 What?\"Xue Meng said sternly, \"I'm asking you, where's Shizun!!!Yours, mine, where's our Shizun?! \"\"Oh.\"Mo Ran snorted softly. Finally, he slowly opened his black eyes that were tinged with purple. Through the years, he looked at Xue Meng.\"Thinking about it, you and Shizun haven't seen each other in five years since we parted at Kunlun's Treading Snow Palace.\"As Mo Ran said this, he smiled slightly.\"Xue Meng, do you miss him?\"\"Don't talk nonsense!Give him back to me! \"Mo Ran looked at him calmly. He endured the throbbing pain in his stomach and leaned against the back of the Emperor's Throne with a mocking smile on his face.His vision turned black, and he could almost clearly feel that his internal organs were twisting, dissolving, and turning into a foul bloody water.Mo Ran said lazily, \"Give him back to you?Stupid words.Why don't you use your brain? I have such a deep hatred for Shizun. How can I allow him to live in this world? \"\"You \u2014!\"Xue Meng suddenly lost all color in his face. His eyes widened as he stepped back. \"You can't \u2026 \u2026 you can't \u2026 \u2026\"\"I can't what?\" Mo Ran chuckled. \"Why don't you tell me? Why can't I?\"Xue Meng said with a trembling voice, \"But he's yours \u2026 \u2026 He's your Shizun after all \u2026 \u2026 How can you do this!\"He looked up at Mo Ran, who was sitting high on the Emperor's Throne.There was Fuxi in the Heavenly Realm, Yama in the Underworld, and Mo Weiyu in the Human Realm.But to Xue Meng, even if Mo Ran became the Emperor of the Human Realm, he shouldn't have become like this.Xue Meng was trembling all over. He was so angry that tears rolled down his face. \"Mo Weiyu, are you still human?He used to \u2026 \u2026 \"Mo Ran looked up indifferently. \"What did he do?\"Xue Meng said with a trembling voice, \"You should know how he used to treat you \u2026 \u2026\"Mo Ran suddenly smiled. \"Are you reminding me that he used to beat me black and blue and made me kneel in front of everyone to admit my guilt?Or are you reminding me that he used to stand in front of me for you, for someone unrelated to him, stopping my good deeds time and time again, ruining my great cause? \"Xue Meng shook his head in pain. \"\u2026 \u2026\"No, Mo Ran.Think about it carefully. Let go of your ferocious hatred.Turn back and look.He used to train you in martial arts and protect you.He used to teach you how to read and write. He used to teach you how to paint.He used to learn how to cook for you. He was so clumsy that his hands were full of injuries.He used to \u2026 \u2026 he used to wait for you day and night. He waited alone from night to day \u2026 \u2026So many words were stuck in his throat. In the end, Xue Meng could only choke.\"He \u2026 \u2026 he has a bad temper and his words are unpleasant, but even I know that he treated you so well. Why did you \u2026 \u2026 how could you bear to \u2026 \u2026\"Xue Meng raised his head. He held back too many tears, but his throat was blocked. He couldn't continue.After a long pause, Mo Ran sighed softly. He said, \"Yes.\"\"But Xue Meng.Do you know? \"Mo Ran's voice sounded very tired.\" He used to kill the only person I loved.The only one. \"There was a long silence.His stomach hurt like it was on fire. His flesh was torn into thousands of pieces.\"But, at least we were master and disciple.His corpse is in the Red Lotus Pavilion on the South Peak.It's very well preserved inside the lotus. It's like he's asleep. \"Mo Ran took a deep breath and forced himself to be calm.When he said this, his face was expressionless. His fingers rested on the long red sandalwood table. His knuckles were pale and blue.\"His corpse is maintained by my spiritual energy. That's why it hasn't decomposed.If you miss him, don't waste your breath here. Go quickly while I'm still alive. \"There was a sweet taste in his throat. Mo Ran coughed a few times. When he opened his mouth again, his mouth was full of blood, but his gaze was relaxed.He said hoarsely, \"Go.Go see him.If you're too late, I'll die. Once my spiritual energy is cut off, he'll turn to ash. \"After saying this, he closed his eyes dejectedly. The poison attacked his heart, and he was tormented by the raging fire.The pain was so heart-wrenching that even Xue Meng's sorrowful and twisted wails seemed so distant. It was as if they were separated by a vast ocean and came from the water.Blood kept flowing from the corner of his mouth. Mo Ran clenched his sleeves, his muscles spasming.He opened his eyes vaguely. Xue Meng had already run far away. That kid's qinggong wasn't bad. From here to the South Peak, it wouldn't take him too much time.He should be able to see Shizun's last face.Mo Ran propped himself up and stood up shakily. His blood-stained fingers formed a seal and transported himself to the Tong Tian Tower at the peak of life and death.It was late autumn. The begonia flowers were blooming beautifully.He didn't know why he chose to end his evil life here.But he felt that the flowers were blooming so brilliantly. It was a beautiful grave.He laid in the open coffin and looked up at the night flowers. He silently drifted.Drifting into the coffin, drifting to his cheeks.Fluttering and drifting away like the past.In this life, he went from being an illegitimate child who had nothing. After countless experiences, he became the only emperor in the human world.He was extremely evil. His hands were stained with blood. He loved and hated, wanted and hated. In the end, there was nothing left.In the end, he didn't write a single sentence on his tombstone with his words of 'Trust the Horses and Reins'.Whether it was the shameless \"Emperor of the Ages\" or the ridiculous \"Steam\", he didn't write anything. In the end, he didn't leave a word on the tombstone of the first emperor of the cultivation world.The farce that had lasted for ten years finally came to an end.After a few more hours, when the group of people held up their torches and entered the Emperor's palace like a fire snake, what awaited them was the empty Magi Mountain Palace, the empty Peak of Life and Death, and Xue Meng, who was crying numbly beside the Red Lotus Pavilion, lying on the ground beside the Red Lotus Pavilion.There was also Mo Weiyu, whose body was already cold in front of the Tong Tian Tower.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

Could it be that the will of the heavens is partial to the grass of the valley? I'm afraid that the world is full of hardships.\"Yue N\u00fc's clear and crisp voice drifted into his ears. Her jade-like words made Mo Ran's head hurt, and the veins on his forehead throbbed violently.\"What's with the noise!Where did this crying ghost come from!Come, beat this lowly servant girl down the mountain! \"After shouting, Mo Ran suddenly realized that something was wrong.\u2026 \u2026 Wasn't he already dead?Hatred and coldness, pain and loneliness pierced his chest. Mo Ran suddenly opened his eyes.The thoughts before his death scattered like snow in the wind. He found that he was lying on a bed. It was not the bed at the peak of life and death. This bed was carved with dragons and phoenixes. The wood exuded a heavy scent of rouge. The old bedding was pink and purple, embroidered with mandarin ducks playing in water. It was the pillow quilt that women in brothels would sleep on.\"\u2026 \u2026\"Mo Ran stiffened for a moment.He knew where this was.This was a tile near the peak of life and death.The so-called tile was a brothel. It said that \"when you come, the tile fits, when you leave, it disintegrates\". It meant to let the guests and the fans meet and part on good terms.When Mo Ran was young, there was a period of time when he was very licentious. In half a month, he would sleep in this brothel for more than ten days.But this brothel was sold when he was in his twenties. Later, it was changed into a wine shop.After his death, he actually appeared in a brothel that no longer existed. What was going on?Could it be that he had done too many evil things in his life, trapping countless boys and girls, so he was punished by the King of Hell to be reincarnated in a brothel?While Mo Ran was thinking nonsense, he unconsciously turned over.He was surprised to see a face that was fast asleep.\"\u2026 \u2026\"What was going on!!!Why was there a person lying next to him??And it was a naked man!This man's face was young and tender, his facial features were exquisite. He looked like a jade snow, and it was hard to tell whether he was a male or a female.Mo Ran's face was expressionless, but his heart was in turmoil. He stared at the gigolo's sleeping face for a long time before he suddenly remembered.Wasn't this the young man whom she especially doted on when she was young? His name seemed to be Rong San?Or Rong Jiu.Regardless of whether it was three or nine, it was not important. What was important was that this young man later contracted a venereal disease and died many years ago. His bones should have rotted away.However, at this moment, he was alive and well, nestled on the side of her bed. His shoulders and neck were exposed under the brocade quilt, and there were bruises all over, full of ambiguous marks.Mo Ran pulled a long face. He lifted the blanket and looked down.\"\u2026\"Rong Jiu didn't know if this Rong Jiu was nine or three, but he could be counted as Rong Jiu. The little beauty Rong Jiu's body was full of whip scars, and his white jade-like thighs were carefully tied with several red ropes.Mo Ran stroked his chin and sighed to himself, \"How interesting.\"Look at this exquisite rope technique, this skillful technique, this familiar scene.Could it be that she was tied by herself?!!He was a cultivator, so he had dabbled in the matter of rebirth.At this moment, he couldn't help but suspect that he seemed to have returned to life.In order to further verify his thoughts, Mo Ran found a bronze mirror.The bronze mirror was badly worn, but in the dim halo, he could vaguely see his own appearance.When Mo Ran died, he was thirty-two years old, and was already in his thirties. But at this moment, the face of the brother in the mirror was quite childish, and there was a unique domineering look of a young man. He looked like he was only fifteen or sixteen years old.There was no one else in this bedroom.So, after a long silence, the tyrant of the cultivation world, the tyrant of Shu, the emperor of the human world, and the lord of life and death, the Emperor Ta Mo Ran honestly expressed his inner feelings.\"F * ck \u2026\"This move woke up Rong Jiu who was in a daze from his sleep.The beauty sat up lazily, and the thin brocade quilt on his body slid down his shoulders, revealing a dazzling white body. He covered his soft long hair, and raised a pair of sleepy peach blossom eyes. The corners of his eyes were stained with residual red, and he yawned.\"Oh \u2026 Young Master Mo, you woke up so early today.\"Mo Ran didn't say anything. More than ten years ago, he did like Rong Jiu, this kind of charming little beauty. But now, the thirty-two years old Emperor Ta, no matter how he looked at it, he couldn't help but wonder if his brain was called a donkey to think that this kind of man was good-looking.\"Did you not sleep well last night? Did you have a nightmare?\"I'm already dead, don't you think it's a nightmare?Rong Jiu saw that he didn't speak, and thought that he was in a bad mood, so he got out of bed, went to the wooden window, and hugged Mo Ran from behind.\"Young Master Mo, pay attention to me, why are you in a daze, don't you feel scared?\"Mo Ran was hugged by him like this, and his face turned green. He couldn't wait to tear this little devil off from his back, and slap his face seventeen or eighteen times, but he resisted in the end.He was still a little dizzy, and didn't understand the situation.After all, if she was really reborn, then she was still having sex with Rong Jiu yesterday, but when she woke up, she beat him black and blue. This kind of behavior was no different from suffering from a mental illness. It was not appropriate, it was not appropriate at all.Mo Ran sorted out his emotions, and asked casually, \"What month and day is it today?\"Rong Jiu was stunned, and then smiled, \"May 4th.\"\"Bing Shennian?\"\"That was last year, and this year is the year of Ding You, Young Master Mo is really forgetful, the more time passes, the more backward you become.\"Ding You \u2026Mo Ran's eyes were filled with emotions, and his mind was spinning fast.Ding You, he was fifteen years old, and was just recognized as his long lost nephew by the Lord at the peak of life and death, from a dog that could be bullied to a phoenix on a branch.Then, was he really reborn?Or was it just a dream after death \u2026?Rong Jiu smiled, \"Young Master Mo, I think you've fainted from hunger, and can't even remember the day.Sit for a while, I'll go to the kitchen and bring you some food, what do you think of oil cake? \"Mo Ran had just been reborn, and he didn't know how to deal with all this, but, it was always right to follow the way he did in the past.So he recalled his flirtatious appearance in the past, held back his disgust, and smiled as he pinched Rong Jiu's leg.\"Very good, give me a bowl of porridge, come back and feed me.\"Rong Jiu put on his clothes and left. After a while, he came back with a wooden tray, with a bowl of pumpkin porridge, two oil cake, and a plate of side dishes.Mo Ran was a little hungry, and was about to eat the pancakes, but Rong Jiu suddenly pushed his hand away, and said charmingly, \"Let me feed you.\"\"...\"Rong Jiu picked up a piece of pancake and sat on Mo Ran's leg.He was wearing a thin outer robe and was completely naked underneath. His soft and tender thighs were spread apart and pressed against Mo Ran's skin. He even rubbed against Mo Ran's skin ambiguously. His seductive intentions were self-evident.Mo Ran stared at Rong Jiu's face for a while.Rong Jiu thought he was lustful again, and said, \"Why do you keep looking at me like that?The food is cold. \"Mo Ran was silent for a moment, thinking of the good things Rong Jiu did behind his back in his previous life, and slowly rubbed the corner of his mouth into a sweet and intimate smile.The Emperor Ta had done many disgusting things, as long as he wanted to, he could do even more disgusting things. This was just a play, a child's trick, it was not difficult for him.Mo Ran leaned comfortably on the chair, and said with a smile, \"Sit up.\"\"I \u2026 I'm sitting.\"\"You know where I'm talking about sitting.\"Rong Jiu's face turned red, and he spat, \"Why are you in such a hurry, wait until you finish eating \u2026 ah!\"Before he finished, he was forcibly pulled up by Mo Ran, moved forward, and pressed down again.Rong Jiu's hand shook, and the bowl of porridge fell to the ground. He gasped in shock, and did not forget to whisper, \"Master Mo, this bowl \u2026\"\"Don't worry.\"\"Then, then you eat something first \u2026 ah \u2026 ah \u2026\"\"Am I not eating now?\"Mo Ran held Rong Jiu's waist, his dark eyes shining brightly. His pupils reflected Rong Jiu's beautiful face as he raised his head.In his previous life, he was especially willing to kiss those bright red lips when they were in love.After all, this young man was beautiful, easy to please, and especially good at saying things that moved him, it would be a lie to say that he was not moved at all.However, after knowing what Rong Jiu's mouth did behind his back, Mo Ran felt that this mouth was stinky, and no longer had the interest to kiss it.The 32 year old Mo Ran and the 15 year old Mo Ran were different in many ways.For example, the 15 year old Rong Jiu knew gentleness when he was in love, the 32 year old Rong Jiu only knew violence.After that, he looked at Rong Jiu who was on the verge of death, and had fainted, a pair of rippling eyes slightly narrowed, and there was a sweet smile on his face.He looked very good when he smiled, his eyes were extremely dark, and from certain angles, there was a layer of luxurious dark purple.At this moment, he was smiling as he grabbed Rong Jiu's hair, and lifted the unconscious person onto the bed, and picked up a piece of broken porcelain from the ground, and hung it on Rong Jiu's face.He had always been vengeful, and it was the same now.Thinking of how he took care of Rong Jiu's business in his previous life, and even wanted to redeem his freedom, and how Rong Jiu worked with others to set him up, he could not help but smile, and stuck the sharp piece of porcelain to Rong Jiu's cheek.This person was in the flesh business, without this face, he would have nothing.This vulgar man, would be like a dog on the streets, crawling on the ground, being kicked by boots, crushed, scolded, and spat on. Aiyo \u2026 Just thinking about it made him happy.Even the disgusting feeling of f * * king this person just now disappeared.Mo Ran's smile became more and more adorable.His hand tightened, and a trace of blood seeped out.The unconscious person seemed to have felt the pain. Her hoarse voice softly moaned. Tears still hung on her eyelashes, making her look very pitiful.Mo Ran's hand suddenly froze.He thought of an old friend.\"\u2026\"Then, he suddenly realized what he was doing.After being stunned for a few seconds, he slowly lowered his hand.He was really used to doing evil.He had forgotten that he had been reborn.Right now, nothing had happened. The mistake had not been made. That person \u2026 was not dead yet.Why did he have to cruelly and cruelly walk down the same old path when he could clearly start all over again?He sat down and propped one foot on the edge of the bed, idly playing with the broken porcelain in his hand.Suddenly, he saw that there was still a greasy pancake on the table, so he picked it up, peeled off the oil paper, and took big bites. His mouth was full of crumbs, and his lips were oily.This pancake was the specialty of this tile. In fact, it was not very delicious. Compared to the delicacies he had tasted later, it was like chewing wax. But after this tile fell, Mo Ran never ate this oil rotary pancake again.At this moment, the familiar taste of the pancake returned to the tip of his tongue through the rolling past.Every time Mo Ran swallowed a bite, he felt that the unreality of his rebirth was reduced by a little.When the whole pancake was finished, he finally slowly recovered from the initial confusion.He was really reborn.All the evil in his life, all the things that he could not turn back from, had not started yet.He did not kill his uncle and aunt, did not slaughter the 72 cities, did not deceive his teacher and ancestors, did not get married, did not \u2026No one was dead yet.He smacked his lips and licked his white teeth. He could feel that the slight joy in his chest was rapidly expanding, becoming a kind of fanaticism and excitement like a stormy sea.In his life, he was all-powerful and had dabbled in the Three Great Forbidden Arts of the Human World.He was proficient in the other two forbidden arts, but the last one, \"Rebirth\", even if he was very talented and intelligent, he could not do it.But he did not expect that what he wanted in his life would come true after he died.All kinds of unwillingness, depression, loneliness, and all these five feelings were still in his chest. The scene of the peak of life and death was still in front of him.At that time, he really did not want to live anymore. Everyone said that he was a lonely ghost, deserted by everyone. In the end, he felt that he was a walking corpse, bored and lonely.But he didn't know what went wrong, but a heinous person like him was given a chance to start all over again after his death.Why did he have to destroy Rong Jiu's face to avenge some old personal grudges?Rong Jiu was the most greedy and loved money.He would just give this prostitute a small punishment and take some money from her for free. That would be enough.He did not want to take human lives for the time being.\"You are lucky, Rong Jiu.\"Mo Ran said with a smile. Then, he threw the piece of porcelain out of the window.Then, he took all of Rong Jiu's jewelry and put them all in his pocket. Then, he slowly tidied himself up and left the tile.Uncle and aunt, cousin Xue Meng, master, and \u2026Thinking of that person, Mo Ran's eyes suddenly became gentle.Senior brother, I am here to find you.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHmm \u2026 Since my soul has returned, does that mean that my previous life's strong cultivation base has also returned?Mo Ran activated the incantation and felt the surge of spiritual power in his body. Although it was abundant, it was not strong.In other words, he did not inherit his cultivation base.However, this was not a big deal. He was talented and intelligent, and his perception was high. At worst, he could just cultivate from the beginning again. It was not a big deal.Moreover, rebirth was a joyous occasion. Even if there were some imperfections, it was still very normal.As Mo Ran thought this, he quickly retracted his darkness and fangs. He looked like a fifteen-year-old youth and happily prepared to return to the sect.The summer was strong in the suburbs. Occasionally, a carriage would pass by, the wheels rolling. No one would pay attention to the fifteen year old Mo Ran.Occasionally, there would be village women who were busy in the fields. When they had time, they would look up and wipe their sweat. When they saw an exceptionally beautiful youth, their eyes would brighten and they would stare at him.Mo Ran also smiled and looked back at them without any trace of politeness. Those married women blushed and lowered their heads.In the evening, Mo Ran arrived at Wuchang Town. This place was very close to the Peak of Life and Death. In the twilight, the red sun was like blood. The burning red clouds set off the towering mountain range.Touching his stomach, he felt a little hungry. Thus, he familiarly entered a restaurant. Looking at the red and black signboard in front of the counter, he knocked on the counter and quickly ordered, \"Shopkeeper, give me a stick chicken, a plate of 'husband and wife lung slice', two pounds of soju wine, and a plate of beef.\"At this time, there were many people eating and it was very lively. The storyteller on the counter was waving a fan and telling the story of the Peak of Life and Death. He was very excited and his saliva flew everywhere.Mo Ran asked for a private room by the window. He ate while listening to the storyteller.\"As everyone knows, our Cultivation World is divided into two regions, the Upper Cultivation World and the Lower Cultivation World. Today, we will talk about the most amazing sect in the Lower Cultivation World, the Peak of Life and Death.Heh, you should know that our Wuchang Town used to be a desolate, turbulent, and poor town a hundred years ago. Because it was close to the entrance of the Ghost World, once the sky turned dark, the villagers didn't dare to go out. If they had to walk at night, they had to ring the exorcism bell, sprinkle incense ashes and paper money, and quickly pass through while shouting, \"When people come, they are separated by mountains; when ghosts come, they are separated by papers.\"But today, it seems that our town is bustling with life and prosperity, no different from other places. This is all because of the care of the Peak of Life and Death.This Immortal Residence, it was located precisely at the entrance of the Gates of Hell, between the two realms of yin and yang.Although it hasn't been established for long, but \u2026 \"Mo Ran's ears were about to grow calluses from listening to this part of history. Thus, he began to lose interest and started to look out of the window in a daze.Coincidentally, there was a stall downstairs. A few outlanders dressed as Taoists were carrying a cage covered with a black cloth and performing tricks on the street.This was much more interesting than the old man's storytelling.Mo Ran's attention was attracted.\"Look, look, look, this is the ancient fierce beast Pixiu cub, subdued by us.Now, it is as obedient as a child, and can juggle and do arithmetic!It is not easy to be a chivalrous person. Everyone, if you have money, please come and support us, if you don't, please come and watch the first good show \u2014 Pixiu's abacus! \"The Taoist priests lifted the black cloth with a whoosh, and inside the cage were several demon beasts with human faces and bear bodies.Mo Ran, \"\u2026\"These obedient and furry bear cubs???They dared to call themselves Pixiu???This boast was really going to break the sky, whoever believed it was a donkey's brain.But Mo Ran soon opened his eyes. Twenty to thirty donkeys gathered around them to watch the show, cheering and clapping from time to time. It was so lively that even the people in the restaurant couldn't help but stick their heads out to look, making the storyteller very embarrassed.\"Now, the Lord at the Peak of Life and Death, his name is illustrious, his reputation spread far and wide \u2014\"\"Good!!Another one!!! \"The storyteller was greatly encouraged, and looked towards the direction of the voice, only to see that the customer's face was flushed with excitement, but his eyes were obviously not looking at him, but at the juggling stall downstairs.\"Yo, Pixiu's abacus?\"\"Ayaya, so awesome!\"\"Good!Wonderful!Show a Pixiu throwing an apple again! \"The people in the restaurant laughed, and all gathered by the window to watch the show below.The storyteller continued to speak pitifully, \"The Lord is most famous for his fan, he \u2026\"\"Ahahaha, that Pixiu with the lightest fur wants to snatch the apple to eat, look at it rolling on the ground!\"The storyteller wiped his face with a sweat towel, so angry that his lips were trembling.Mo Ran pursed his lips, then smiled, and leisurely shouted from behind the beaded curtain, \"Don't talk about the Peak of Life and Death, show the Eighteen Touches, I'm sure you'll pull everyone back.\"The storyteller didn't know that the person behind the curtain was the Lord Mo Ran at the Peak of Life and Death, so he stammered with integrity, \"Vulgar, vulgar words, don't, don't enter the hall of elegance.\"Mo Ran laughed, \"This is the hall of elegance?Don't you feel ashamed? \"After saying that, there was a sudden noise downstairs.\"Aiya!What a fast horse! \"\"It's the Immortal at the Peak of Life and Death!\"In the midst of the discussion, a black horse galloped from the direction of the Peak of Life and Death, and charged into the juggling circle like lightning!There were two people sitting on the horse. One of them was wearing a black bamboo hat and a black cloak. It was hard to tell their age and gender. The other was a woman in her thirties or forties. She was clumsy and had a face full of hardships.When the woman saw those bears, she burst into tears. She rolled and crawled off the horse, staggered over, and hugged one of the bears, then knelt and wailed, \"Son!!!My son \u2014 \u2014 \"The surrounding people were dumbfounded.Someone scratched his head and muttered, \"Eh?Isn't this the cub of the ancient mythological beast Pixiu?Why did this woman call it 'son'? \"\"This can't be a female Pixiu, right?\"\"Aiya, so powerful, this female has cultivated into a human form.\"The villagers here didn't know anything, so they were talking nonsense, but Mo Ran figured it out.It was said that some Taoists would abduct children, and then pull out the children's tongues to make them unable to speak. Then they would use boiling water to burn the children's skin, and while the flesh was in a mess, they would stick the animal skin on their bodies. After the blood solidified, the skin and the children would stick together, looking no different from a demon.These children couldn't speak, couldn't write, and could only be bullied, cooperating with the \"Pixiu playing the abacus\" kind of juggling. If they resisted, they would be whipped with sticks.No wonder he didn't feel the slightest bit of demonic aura before, these \"Pixiu\" weren't demons at all, but living people \u2026While he was pondering, the black-cloaked figure whispered something to the Daoist priests. When the Daoist priests heard this, they were instantly enraged and shouted, \"Apologize?\". \"Apologize?Your grandfather doesn't know how to write the word 'apologize'! \"\" What's so great about the Peak of Life and Death? \"\" Meddling in other people's business, beat him! \"They rushed up to beat the black cloak.\"Aiya.\"Seeing his fellow disciples being beaten, Mo Ran chuckled, \"So fierce.\"He didn't have the slightest intention to help.In his previous life, he especially hated this kind of atmosphere in the sect where people would help when they saw injustice. One by one, they rushed up like idiots. Auntie Wang's kitten at the entrance of the village needed their help when it couldn't climb down the tree. Everyone in the sect, from the sect leader to the odd-job workers, were stupid.There were so many unfair things in the world, why bother? It was tiring.\"They're fighting, they're fighting!He!What a powerful fist! \"Up and down the restaurant, the crowd crowded around to join in the fun.\"So many people fighting one, don't you feel ashamed!\"\"Immortal Master, watch your back!Aiya!That was close!Wahahaha \u2014 \"\"That was a good dodge!\"These people liked to watch fights, but Mo Ran didn't. He had seen too many bloody battles, and what happened right under his nose was like a fly buzzing around him.He lazily brushed the peanut crumbs off his clothes and got up to leave.Downstairs, the Daoist priests and the black cloak were locked in a fierce battle. Sword Qi whizzed about. Mo Ran crossed his arms and leaned against the door of the wine shop. He glanced at them and couldn't help but click his tongue.How embarrassing.The Peak of Life and Death were all fierce and brave, but this black cloak was not good at fighting. Seeing that he was being pulled down by the Taoist priests of Jianghu, he was surrounded and kicked in the middle, but he was not ruthless.Instead, he shouted weakly, \"A gentleman uses his fists instead of his mouth. I'm trying to reason with you, why don't you listen?!\"The Taoist priests were speechless.Mo Ran: \"\u2026\"The Taoist priests were thinking, 'What?This person had already been beaten into such a pitiful state, yet he was still a gentleman who used his mouth and not his fists?This is the head of a steamed bun. There's no stuffing, right?Mo Ran's expression suddenly changed. For a moment, he felt as if the world was spinning around him. He held his breath and opened his eyes wide in disbelief. This voice \u2026\"Shi Mei!\"Mo Ran bellowed and rushed forward. He infused his palm with spiritual energy and blasted the five evil Taoist priests away!He knelt on the ground and helped the black cloak up. His voice couldn't help but tremble slightly.\"Shi Mei, is that you?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis Shi Mei was not his Junior Sister.Shi Mei was a real man, and in terms of time, he was Mo Ran's Senior Brother.The reason why he was given such an unlucky name was because the Lord, who was at the pinnacle of life and death, had no knowledge.Shi Mei was originally an orphan, and was picked up by the Lord in the wild. This child was weak and sickly since young, so the Lord thought that he should give this child a lowly name, which would make it easier to take care of him.This child was born with red lips and white teeth, and looked like a cute little girl, so the Lord racked his brains and thought of a name for him, Xue Ya.Xue Ya grew up and became more and more beautiful. Her face was smooth, and her eyebrows and eyes were flirtatious. She had the charm of a peerless beauty.It was fine for a country bumpkin to have the name Xue Ya, but have you ever seen a beautiful woman called \"Gou Dan\" or \"Tie Zhu\"?Her fellow disciples felt that it was inappropriate, so they gradually stopped calling her Xue Ya, but it was not good to change the name given by the Lord, so they half-jokingly called her Junior Sister.Junior Sister, Junior Sister, Junior Sister, Junior Sister. Later, the Lord simply waved his hand and said considerately, \"Xue Ya, why don't you change your name and call yourself Shi Mei? What do you think?\"He had the nerve to ask \u2026 How could a normal person accept this name?However, Shi Mei had a good temper. He looked up at the Great Lord and realized that the Great Lord was looking at him happily. It seemed that the Great Lord thought that he had done a good deed.Shi Mei could not bear it, and felt that even if he was wronged, he could not embarrass the Lord.So he happily knelt down and thanked him, and changed his name from then on.\"Cough, cough.\" The black cloak coughed a few times, then recovered and looked up at Mo Ran. \"Hmm?Mo Ran?Why are you here? \"Through the hazy veil, that pair of eyes were as soft as spring water and as bright as the stars, directly cutting into Mo Ran's heart.With just a glance, the Celestial Treading Monarch's tenderness and youthful thoughts that had been covered in dust for a long time were instantly unsealed.It was Shi Mei.It couldn't be wrong.Mo Ran was a ruffian. In his previous life, he had played with many men and women. In the end, he didn't die of exhaustion. Even he himself was surprised.However, the only person he truly loved was someone he was very careful about, and he never dared to touch her easily.In those years, he and Shi Mei had been flirting with each other, but when Shi Mei died, Mo Ran had only held her hand and had only accidentally kissed her once.Mo Ran felt that he was dirty. Shi Mei was too gentle and pure. He was not worthy of her.He already cherished this person so much when she was alive, let alone when she was dead.Then she would have completely become the white moonlight in the Emperor Ta's heart. No matter how much he scratches his heart and liver to think about her, she would have already become a handful of yellow earth. In the underworld, it would be difficult to find her.But at this moment, the living Shi Mei appeared in front of him again. Mo Ran had to use all his strength to control his emotions.Mo Ran helped him up and brushed off the dust on his cloak. His heart ached so much that his flesh was about to fall off.\"If I wasn't here, wouldn't you have been bullied by them?Why didn't you fight back when they hit you? \"\"I want to reason with them first \u2026\"\"What's the point of reasoning with these people!Are you hurt?Where does it hurt? \"\"Cough, cough, Mo Ran, I \u2026 I'm fine.\"Mo Ran turned his head and fiercely said to the Taoist priests, \"You dare to touch someone at the peak of life and death?You've got guts. \"\"Mo Ran \u2026 forget it \u2026\"\"Didn't you want to fight?Come on!Why don't you spar with me! \"After being hit by Mo Ran's palm, the Taoist priests knew that this person's cultivation level was much higher than theirs. They were all cowards and didn't dare to exchange blows with Mo Ran. They all retreated.Shi Mei sighed repeatedly and advised, \"Mo Ran, don't fight. Be lenient when possible.\"Mo Ran turned to look at him. He couldn't help but feel sad and his eyes were slightly hot.Shi Mei had always been kind. When he died in his past life, he didn't have any resentment or hatred.He even advised Mo Ran not to hold a grudge against his Master, who could have saved his life but chose to stand by and watch.\"But they \u2026\"\"Aren't I fine? Nothing's wrong with me.It's better to avoid trouble. Listen to Senior Brother. \"\"Ai ai, alright, we'll listen to you. We'll listen to you.\" Mo Ran shook his head and glared at the Taoist priests, \"Did you hear that?My Senior Brother is pleading for you!Why aren't you scramming?Do you still want me to send you off? \"\"Yes, yes, yes!We'll scram now!We'll scram now! \"Shi Mei said to the Taoist priests, \"Wait.\"The Taoist priests felt that Shi Mei wouldn't let them off so easily after being beaten up by them. They knelt on the ground and kowtowed repeatedly, \"Immortal Monarch, Immortal Monarch, we were wrong. We didn't recognize Mount Tai.We beg Immortal Monarch to let us go! \"\"I told you nicely just now, but you didn't listen.\"Shi Mei sighed, \"You kidnapped other people's children and caused them to suffer such a crime. Their parents are heartbroken. Do you have a conscience?\"\"We're sorry!We're sorry!Immortal Monarch, we were wrong!We won't do it again!We won't do it again! \"\"You have to be upright in the future. Don't do bad things. Do you understand?\"\"Yes!Immortal Monarch is right!We, we've been taught, we've been taught! \"\"Since it's like this, please apologize to this madam and treat her children.\"This matter was settled. Mo Ran helped Shi Mei get on the horse and borrowed another one from the post house. The two of them rode side by side back to the sect.The Wu gou hung high in the sky. The moonlight shone through the trees and scattered on the forest path.As they walked, Mo Ran gradually became happy. He thought that he would see Shi Mei again only when he returned to the peak of life and death. He didn't expect that Shi Mei would come down the mountain and he would bump into him. Mo Ran was more and more convinced that he and Shi Mei were indeed fated to be together.Although Shi Mei wasn't with him at this time, he had hooked up with him in his previous life. In this life, he was obviously familiar with it.The only thing he had to worry about was to protect Shi Mei. He didn't want him to die in his arms like he did in the past \u2026Shi Mei didn't know that Mo Ran had been reborn. He chatted with him as usual.The two of them chatted until they arrived at the foot of the peak of life and death.Who would have thought that in the middle of the night, there would be a person standing in front of the mountain gate, staring at them like a tiger watching its prey.\"Mo Ran!You still know how to come back? \"\"Eh?\"Mo Ran looked up. Oh, what an angry God's favored son.This person was none other than the young Xue Meng.Compared to the Xue Meng he saw before he died, the 15 or 16 years old Xue Meng looked even more arrogant and handsome.He was dressed in a simple black armor with blue edges. He had a high ponytail, a silver hairpin, a lion's head belt, and a slender waist. He had a pair of gauntlets on his back, and a thin curved blade shining with a cold light. The arrow box on his left arm shone with a silver light.Mo Ran sighed inwardly. He thought straightforwardly:Hmm, coquettish.Xue Meng, no matter when he was young or when he grew up, he was really coquettish.Look at him, a good boy, but instead of sleeping in the middle of the night, he's wearing the full set of armor of the peak of life and death. What is he trying to do?Is he trying to act like a pheasant courting a mate and a peacock spreading its tail?However, even if Mo Ran didn't like Xue Meng, Xue Meng might not like him either.Mo Ran was an illegitimate child. When he was young, he didn't even know who his father was. He spent his days doing odd jobs in a music hall in Xiang Tan.It wasn't until he was 14 that his family found him and brought him back to the peak of life and death.Xue Meng was the young master of the peak of life and death. Technically speaking, he was actually Mo Ran's younger cousin.Xue Meng matured early when he was young. He was a genius and was known as the \"Proud Son of Heaven\" or \"Little Phoenix\".Normally, it would take three years for a person to build their foundation and at least ten years to form their spiritual core. Xue Meng was talented and intelligent. From the time he entered the sect to forming his spiritual core, it only took him five years. His parents were very happy and praised him everywhere.However, in Mo Ran's eyes, whether he was a phoenix or a chicken, a peacock or a duck, he was still a bird.The only difference was that his feathers were long and his feathers short.Therefore, Mo Ran looked at Xue Meng and said, \"Bird thing.\"Xue Meng looked at Mo Ran and said, \"Dog thing.\"Perhaps it was inherited in the family, but Mo Ran's talent was also very shocking. It could even be said that he was more shocking than Xue Meng.When Mo Ran first arrived, Xue Meng felt that he was especially noble and elegant. He was well-cultivated, knowledgeable, strong in martial arts, and handsome. He was completely different from his cousin, who didn't know how to read and acted like a sloppy hooligan.Therefore, the narcissistic Little Phoenix commanded her followers and said to them, \"Listen carefully, Mo Ran is a person who idles around and doesn't learn anything. He's an out-and-out street hooligan. Don't pay attention to him. Just treat him like a dog.\"The followers flattered her and said, \"Young Master is right. That Mo Ran is already 14 years old and he just started to cultivate. I think he'll need at least ten years to build his foundation and twenty years to form his spiritual core.When that time comes, our Young Master will have already passed the tribulation and ascended. He can only watch helplessly from the ground. \"Xue Meng sneered complacently, \"Twenty years?Hmph, I think he'll never be able to form his spiritual core in this lifetime. \"Who would have thought that the good-for-nothing would actually form his spiritual core after learning for a year from his Master.Little Phoenix felt as if she was struck by lightning. She felt that she had been slapped in the face and could not swallow this resentment.Therefore, she secretly scolded him and cursed him for slipping on his flying sword. She also cursed him for being tongue-tied.Every time she saw Mo Ran, Xue Meng, and Little Phoenix would relentlessly reward them with rolling eyes. The sound from her nose could be heard from three miles away.When Mo Ran thought of these childhood memories, he couldn't help but squint his eyes and smile. He hadn't enjoyed this kind of human life for a long time. After being alone for ten years, even the things that he hated so much in the past were now crispy and delicious to him.When Shi Mei saw Xue Meng, he immediately dismounted and took off his black gauze bamboo hat, revealing a stunning face.It was no wonder that he dressed like this when he went out alone. Mo Ran peeked at him from the side and felt his heart shake as he let his imagination run wild.He thought to himself that this person was really stunning. His soul was captivating.Shi Mei greeted him, \"Young Master.\"Xue Meng nodded, \"You're back?Have you dealt with the matter of Brown Bear? \"Shi Mei smiled, \"It's done.It's all thanks to meeting Mo Ran. He helped me a lot. \"Xue Meng's proud gaze swept over Mo Ran like a gale blade and immediately turned away. He frowned and his face was full of disdain, as if looking at Mo Ran for a moment would dirty his eyes.\"Shi Mei, go back and rest first.Don't hang out with him in the future. He's a thieving bastard. You'll learn bad things if you hang out with him. \"Mo Ran didn't back down and mocked, \"If Shi Mei doesn't learn from me, does he want to learn from you?It's late at night and you're still dressed so smartly. You're like a bird with your tail up. Proud son of the heavens \u2026 hahaha, I think you're more like a proud daughter of the heavens. \"Xue Meng was furious, \"Mo Ran, you better watch your mouth!This is my home!Who do you think you are? \"Mo Ran counted with his fingers, \"I'm your older cousin. If we're talking about it, I should be ahead of you.\"Xue Meng felt as if his face was splashed with dog feces. He immediately frowned in disgust and said sternly, \"Who has an older cousin like you!Don't flatter yourself. In my eyes, you're just a dog that has rolled in a quagmire! \"Xue Meng was a person who especially liked to scold others as dogs. She was very proficient in scolding others, saying things like son of a dog, son of a dog, son of a dog, son of a dog, son of a dog.Mo Ran was already used to this. He picked his ear and didn't mind.Shi Mei, who was standing beside them, felt awkward and tried to persuade them.Xue Meng finally let out a cold snort from her nostrils and shut her noble beak.Shi Mei smiled and asked gently, \"Young Master, it's so late. Are you waiting for someone in front of the mountain gate?\"\"What else?Admiring the moon? \"Mo Ran held his stomach and laughed, \"I was wondering why you looked so good. It turns out that you were waiting for someone to go on a date. Sigh, who's so unlucky to be remembered by you?I really pity her, hahahahaha. \"Xue Meng's face turned even darker. His fingernails could scrape off three kilograms of coal. He said in a rough voice, \"You!\"\"\u2026 Me?\"\"This Young Master will wait for you. What do you want?\"Mo Ran: \"\u2026???\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Dan Xin Palace was brightly lit.Shi Mei left first while Mo Ran followed Xue Meng into the palace in confusion. When he saw the scene in the palace, he immediately understood what was going on.It was Rong Jiu's second son.He stole some money from him before he left, but he had the guts to come to the Peak of Life and Death.Rong Jiu was nestled in the arms of a tall man, crying miserably. When Mo Ran and Xue Meng entered the palace, his crying became louder. It seemed that if the man did not hold him in his arms, he would have fainted and foamed at the mouth.On the platform, behind the beaded curtain, a delicate woman sat there. She seemed to be at a loss.Mo Ran did not look at the adulterous couple. He first bowed to the woman in the palace, \"Auntie, I'm back.\"The woman was the Lord at the Peak of Life and Death, Madam Wang.She was different from those heroines who were not inferior to men. She was a woman who did not care about the outside world. Her husband was not around, so she did not know how to deal with the situation. She said timidly, \"Mo Ran, you're finally here.\"Mo Ran pretended not to see the two people in the palace. He smiled and said, \"It's so late, auntie. Why are you not sleeping? Are you looking for me?\"\"Yes.Look, this Young Master Rong said that you \u2026 you took his money? \"She was shy and did not want to say that Mo Ran was a prostitute. She could only avoid the topic.Mo Ran smiled, \"What? I don't lack money. Why would I take their money?Moreover, these two people look unfamiliar. Do I know you? \"The tall man sneered, \"My surname is Chang. I'm the eldest in the family. Businessmen don't care about trifles. Just call me Chang Da.\"Mo Ran smiled and said Chang Da in reverse, \"So it's Young Master Chang. I've heard so much about you. Sorry for the disrespect.Then the other one is \u2026 \"Young Master Dachang said, \"Haha, Young Master Mo really knows how to play the fool. This is indeed the first time we met, but this month, you slept in Jiu 'er's room for fifteen out of thirty days. Are you blind?How could you not recognize him? \"Mo Ran did not blush and looked at Rong Jiu with a smile. \"Why? Are you trying to blackmail me? I'm a decent person. I've never slept with a mistress.\"Rong Jiu's face turned red with anger, but she was still nestled in the arms of the man surnamed Chang. \"M-Mr. Mo, I know that my identity is lowly and I can't be seen in public. If you didn't bully me too much, I, I wouldn't have come here. But you actually turned against me like this, I \u2026 I \u2026\"Mo Ran felt wronged. \"I really don't know you. I can't even tell if you're a man or a woman. How could we have met before?\"\"You even took care of my business last night. How can you be so cold?Young Master Chang, Young Master Chang, you have to help me. \"Rong Jiu buried herself deeper into the arms of the man surnamed Chang and cried.Xue Meng's face turned ashen as he listened, and his eyebrows twitched. It seemed that if it weren't for the restraint of the Young Master, he would have long beaten this lovey-dovey pair down the mountain.Young Master Dachang stroked Rong Jiu's head and comforted him softly. Then, he raised his head and said sternly, \"Madam Wang, the Peak of Life and Death is a big sect, but this Young Master Mo is despicable!Jiu 'er worked hard to earn money just to redeem herself as soon as possible. But he not only mistreated Jiu' er, but also robbed her of her hard-earned money. If your sect doesn't give us a satisfactory explanation today, although the Chang family doesn't cultivate immortality, we've been doing business for generations. Our wealth reaches the sky. We'll make sure that you won't have a good time in Bashu! \"Madam Wang panicked and said, \"Ah \u2026 Young Master Chang, don't be angry. I, I \u2026\"Mo Ran sneered in his heart. The salt merchant Chang family was filthy rich, but this Young Master Dachang couldn't even redeem Rong Jiu's freedom. His Jiu 'er had to earn it herself. Who would believe that there was nothing fishy going on?But he still said with a smile, \"Ah, so Brother Dachang is the son of a rich merchant from Yizhou. You're really impressive.I've seen it for myself. I'm impressed. \"Young Master Dachang said proudly, \"Humph, at least you know your place. Since that's the case, you'd better be sensible. Don't make trouble for yourself.You took Jiu 'er's things, so why don't you return them? \"Mo Ran said with a smile, \"That's strange. Your Jiu 'er receives so many customers every day. Why don't you blame others for losing your treasures, but me?\"\"You!\" Young Master Dachang clenched his teeth and sneered, \"Good, good, good, I knew you'd quibble!Madam Wang, you saw it too. Young Master Mo is unreasonable and won't admit it. I won't talk to him anymore.You're the head of the family, so you'll be the one to make the decision! \"Madam Wang was an ignorant woman. She was so nervous that she couldn't speak coherently, \"I \u2026 Mo Ran \u2026 Meng 'er \u2026\"Xue Meng stood to the side. Seeing his mother in a difficult position, he stood up and said, \"Young Master Dachang, the Peak of Life and Death has strict rules. If what you said is true, and if Mo Ran really broke the rules of greed and lust, we'll punish him severely.But you have no proof. You said that Mo Ran stole, but do you have any proof? \"Young Master Dachang sneered, \"I knew your sect would do something like this. That's why I rushed here to confront Madam Wang before Mo Ran returned.\"He cleared his throat and said, \"Listen carefully, Jiu 'er lost two pearls, ten ingots, a pair of plum blossom gold bracelets, a pair of jade hairpins, and a jade butterfly pendant. If you check Mo Ran's body, you'll know if I've wronged him.\"Mo Ran couldn't accept it, \"Why are you searching me?\"\"Hmph, I think you have a guilty conscience.\"Young Master Dachang raised his chin arrogantly, \"Madam Wang, how do you punish theft and lust at the Peak of Life and Death?\"Madam Wang whispered, \"This \u2026 my husband has always been in charge of the sect's affairs. I really \u2026 don't know \u2026\"\"No, no, I think it's not that Madam Wang doesn't know, but that you want to protect your nephew.Haha, I didn't expect the Peak of Life and Death to be such a filthy place. \"\"Okay, okay.My aunt already said that she doesn't know how to make decisions. You're bullying a woman, and you're not done yet? \"Mo Ran finally got a little impatient and interrupted him. His usual cheeky smile disappeared a little as he turned to stare at the adulterous couple.\"Okay, I'll search you. But if I can't find anything, what should I do when you're full of filthy words to slander my sect?\"\"Then I'll apologize to Young Master Mo immediately.\"\"Okay.\"Mo Ran agreed without hesitation, \"But there's one thing. If you're wrong, to apologize, you have to crawl down from the Peak of Life and Death on your knees.\"When Young Master Dachang saw Mo Ran's confident look, he couldn't help but feel suspicious.He envied cultivators since he was young, but his talent was too poor and he didn't understand the main points.A few days ago, he heard that his old sweetheart Rong Jiu was favored by Mo Ran. The two of them agreed that as long as Rong Jiu found a chance to steal Mo Ran's cultivation, Young Master Dachang would redeem Rong Jiu. Not only would he redeem Rong Jiu, but he would also take Rong Jiu into his family and guarantee him a life of wealth and prosperity.Young Master Dachang sought immortality, and Rong Jiu sought wealth. The two of them colluded and hit it off.In his previous life, Mo Ran fell into their trap. Although it was settled later, he suffered a lot.But in this life, the two of them tried to steal a chicken only to end up losing the rice used to lure it. For some reason, Mo Ran suddenly changed his temperament. A few days ago, he was still in a drunken stupor, lying in the land of warmth and tenderness.But this morning, after having sex with Rong Jiu twice, he took Rong Jiu's belongings and ran away.Young Master Dachang was so angry that he immediately dragged Rong Jiu to the Peak of Life and Death to complain.This salt merchant's business abacus crackled. He calculated that once he caught Mo Ran in the act, he would force Madam Wang to disperse Mo Ran's cultivation.For this reason, he specially carried a jade pendant that could absorb cultivation. He was going to take advantage of it and integrate it into his Sea of Qi.But seeing Mo Ran like this, Young Master Dachang looked down and hesitated.Mo Ran was so slippery. Maybe he had already disposed of the goods and was waiting to trick him.But on second thought, since things had come to this, it would be a pity to give up at this time. Maybe this guy was bluffing \u2026While he was still thinking hard, Mo Ran began to take off his clothes.He took off his outer robe without hesitation and threw it away casually. Then he smiled and made an inviting gesture. \"You're welcome. Take your time.\"After a while, he didn't find anything except for some silver. Young Master Dachang's face changed.\"How is it possible!You must be cheating! \"Mo Ran narrowed his black eyes with some purple. He touched his chin and said, \"You've touched my outer robe ten times, and my whole body seven or eight times. I almost took off my clothes for you to see. You still don't give up?\"\"Mo Ran, you \u2026\"Mo Ran was suddenly enlightened. \"Ah, I get it now. Childe Dachang, don't tell me you're drooling over my beauty, so you deliberately put on this show to take advantage of me?\"Young Master Dachang was so angry that he almost fainted. He pointed at Mo Ran's nose and couldn't say a word for a long time. His face was red with anger.Xue Meng on the side couldn't stand it anymore. Although he didn't like Mo Ran, Mo Ran was still a person at the peak of life and death. He couldn't tolerate being humiliated by outsiders.Xue Meng stepped forward without hesitation. He raised his hand and broke Young Master Dachang's fingers. He said angrily, \"I played with you for half a night, but it turns out that you're just looking for trouble!\"Young Master Dachang screamed in pain and held his fingers. \"You, you guys!You're in cahoots!No wonder we couldn't find those things on Mo Ran. You must have hidden them for him!You take off your clothes too. I'll search you! \"Someone dared to order him to take off his clothes?!Xue Meng flew into a rage out of humiliation. \"Shameless!Do you think your dog paws are fit to touch the corner of this Young Master's clothes?Get out of here! \"Since their young master had given the order, the waiters in Dan Xin Palace, who had been patient for a long time, immediately swarmed up and threw the two mortals, who had no power to fight back, down the mountain.Young Master Dachang's angry shout came from afar. \"Mo Ran, you wait!I'll never let you go! \"Mo Ran stood outside Dan Xin Palace and looked at the distant night sky. He squinted his eyes and sighed. \"I'm so scared.\"Xue Meng looked at him coldly. \"What are you scared of?\"Mo Ran said with genuine worry, \"His family sells salt. I'm afraid that I won't have enough salt.\"\"\u2026\"Xue Meng was speechless for a moment. He asked again, \"You really didn't go whoring?\"\"Really.\"\"You really didn't steal?\"\"Really.\"Xue Meng snorted. \"I don't believe you.\"Mo Ran raised his hand and said with a smile, \"If I lie, I'll be struck by lightning.\"Xue Meng suddenly raised his hand and grasped Mo Ran's arm tightly. Mo Ran stared at him. \"What are you doing?\"Xue Meng snorted and quickly chanted a series of spells. With a series of clanking sounds, several inconspicuous soybean-sized beads slipped out of Mo Ran's sleeve and fell to the ground.Xue Meng filled his palm with Wakan and waved it at the beads.The beads shone brightly and became bigger and bigger. In the end, they turned into a pile of jewelry, plum bracelets, emerald earrings, and other glittering gold jewelry.Mo Ran said, \"\u2026 We're from the same school. Why do you have to make things difficult for us?\"Xue Meng's face darkened. \"Mo Weiyu, you're so shameless.\"\"Haha.\"Xue Meng angrily said, \"Who's laughing at you!\"Mo Ran sighed and said, \"Then I can't cry.\"Xue Meng's face darkened. He said, \"Is this how you use the Life and Death Secret Technique?\"\"Yes, I'm using it.\"Xue Meng angrily said, \"That salt selling dog is so annoying. That's why I didn't want to interrogate you properly in front of him.But that dog thing is right about one thing. If you break the rules of theft and lust, you'll be in trouble no matter which sect you go to! \"Mo Ran wasn't afraid at all. He smiled and said, \"What are you going to do?Wait for uncle to come back and complain to him? \"He wasn't afraid at all. His uncle spoiled him to death. At most, he would say a few words. How could he bear to hit him?Xue Meng turned around and brushed aside the hair that was blown in front of his eyes. His eyes shined with arrogance in the dark night.\"Father?No, father went to Kunlun. I'm afraid he won't be back for a month or two. \"Mo Ran's smile froze. He suddenly had an ominous feeling. He suddenly thought of someone.But \u2014If he was here, he would be the one to receive Young Master Chang at Dan Xin Palace tonight, not Madam Wang who didn't know anything.That person \u2026 shouldn't be here \u2026Xue Meng saw the flicker in his eyes. His contempt and arrogance became more obvious.\"Father loves you. But isn't there someone who doesn't love you at the Life and Death Summit?\"Mo Ran slowly took a few steps back and forced a smile. \"Brother, it's already so late. Let's not disturb the old man. I know I was wrong. I won't go to whorehouses next time. What do you think about that?Go back to your room and rest. Haha, look how tired you are. \"He ran away after saying that.What a joke!Xue Meng, this brat, is too vicious!He wasn't the Emperor Ta now. He wasn't the Master of the Human Realm. How could he be sent to that person?If he found out that he had stolen something and even had sex with a prostitute, he would probably break both of his legs!If he didn't run now, when would he?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter all, Xue Meng grew up on the Peak of Life and Death, so he was familiar with the terrain of the shortcut. In the end, he still captured Mo Ran.He escorted him all the way to the back mountain. The back mountain of the Peak of Life and Death was the closest place to the ghost world in the entire human world. It was separated by a barrier, and behind it was the netherworld.Looking at the miserable situation at the back mountain, Mo Ran immediately knew why that person still needed Madam Wang to entertain him in the front hall even though he was at home.It was not that that person did not want to help, but he really could not free himself.The barrier of the ghost world was broken.At this moment, the whole back mountain was filled with a thick ghost aura.The evil spirits that had yet to materialize were howling and circling in the air. At the entrance of the mountain gate, one could see that a huge gap had been torn open in the sky. Behind that gap was the Ghost Realm. A bluestone staircase that was thousands of steps long extended out from the crack in the barrier. The evil spirits that had already cultivated flesh and blood were climbing down this staircase. They were climbing down from the Netherworld to the Human Realm.If it was an ordinary person, they would be scared out of their wits upon seeing this scene. Mo Ran also broke out in a cold sweat when he first saw this, but he was used to it now.The barrier between the human world and ghost world was set up by Fuxi in ancient times. Now, it was very weak. From time to time, there would be holes that needed to be repaired by immortal cultivators.However, this kind of thing did not increase one's cultivation by much. It also consumed a lot of spiritual power. It was a thankless task, so very few immortals in the upper cultivation world were willing to take this job.When evil spirits appeared, the first to suffer would be the people in the lower cultivation world. As the guardian of the lower cultivation world, the Peak of Life and Death took on the task of repairing the barrier. Their sect's back mountain was facing the weakest part of the barrier, so that they could repair the gap in time.This broken barrier would always be broken four or five times a year, just like a patched pot, it was not banned.At this time, at the entrance of the ghost world, on the bluestone staircase, a man in snow-white clothes, his wide sleeves fluttering, surrounded by sword aura and golden light. He was cleaning the evil spirits and fixing the hole in the barrier with his own strength.That person had a slender waist and long hair. He had a celestial demeanor and was very handsome. Looking at him from afar, it was very easy to think of an elegant scholar who was reading books under a flowering tree.However, when looked at up close, his sharp brows were piercingly cold, his phoenix shaped eyes were high, his nose was tall and narrow, and he looked refined and refined. However, his eyes revealed a trace of harshness, and he seemed to be extremely unreasonable.Mo Ran glanced at him from afar. Although he was mentally prepared, when he saw this person appear in front of him, healthy and unharmed, he still couldn't help but tremble.Half of it was fear, and the other half was \u2026 excitement.His master.Chu Wanning.In his previous life, the last person Xue Meng came to the Magi Mountain Palace and cried to see was this person.It was this man who had ruined Mo Ran's grand plans, ruined Mo Ran's ambitions, and was finally imprisoned and tortured to death by Mo Ran.Logically speaking, defeating his opponent and taking revenge, Mo Ran should be happy.The sea was wide, and the sky was wide, and the sky was wide, and there was no one who could control him.Mo Ran originally thought that he had the same thoughts.However, it didn't seem to be the case.After his master died, there seemed to be something else that was buried together with his hatred.Mo Ran didn't have much self-cultivation, so he didn't know what it felt like to meet one's match.He only knew that from then on, there was no longer any enemy in the world.When his master was alive, he was afraid, fearful, and trembled. When he saw the willow vine in his master's hand, his hair stood on end. He was like a beaten stray dog, and when he heard the sound of a clapper, his teeth would ache, his legs would go soft, and his mouth would drool.His legs and stomach would twitch nervously.Later, his master died. The person Mo Ran was most afraid of died.Mo Ran felt that he had improved, that he had finally done something that deceived his master.After that, in the world of mortals, no one dared to make him kneel, and no one dared to slap him.To celebrate, he opened a jar of Pear Blossom White, sat on the roof, and drank wine all night.That night, under the influence of alcohol, the scar on his back that his master had slapped when he was young seemed to burn with pain again.At this moment, seeing his master reappear in front of him with his own eyes, Mo Ran stared at him with fear and hatred, but there was also a trace of twisted ecstasy.Such an opponent, how could he not be happy when he found him again?Chu Wanning didn't pay attention to his two disciples who had broken into the back of the mountain. He was still concentrating on resisting the overflowing spirits.His facial features were elegant, his pair of eyebrows were long, and his phoenix eyes were cold and indifferent. His cultivation was extraordinary, and his expression didn't change in the wind and rain of blood. He looked very indifferent, and it wouldn't be strange if he sat down at this moment to burn incense and play the zither.However, such a gentle and elegant handsome man was now holding an exorcist sword that was shining with cold light, and still dripping with bright red blood beads. With a wave of his wide sleeve, the sword's aura cut the bluestone stairs in front of him to explode. Broken stones and broken bricks rolled down, all the way from the mountain gate to the bottom of the mountain. The thousands of stairs were split open in an instant, creating a bottomless chasm!It was too fierce.How many years had it been since he had seen his master's strength?This kind of familiar domineering strength made Mo Ran's legs go weak. He couldn't stand firmly, and with a plop, he knelt on the ground.It didn't take long for Chu Wanning to exterminate all the ghosts and monsters, and to fix the holes in the World of Spirits and Souls. After doing all this, he floated down from mid-air and arrived in front of Mo Ran and Xue Meng.He first glanced at Mo Ran, who was kneeling on the ground, and then raised his eyes to look at Xue Meng. His phoenix eyes were cold.\"Got into trouble?\"Mo Ran was convinced.Shizun had the ability to immediately make the most accurate judgment of a situation.\"Shizun,\" Xue Meng said, \"Mo Ran went down the mountain and committed two crimes, theft and sexual assault. Shizun, please punish him.\"Chu Wanning was silent for a while with an expressionless face. Then, he said coldly, \"Got it.\"Mo Ran: \"\u2026\"Xue Meng: \"\u2026\"Both of them were dumbfounded. What happened next?There was no 'then'?However, just as Mo Ran secretly felt lucky and raised his head to look at Chu Wanning, he suddenly caught a glimpse of a sharp golden light. It suddenly cut through the air, and with a whoosh, it directly hit Mo Ran's face!!Blood splattered everywhere!The speed of that golden light was too shocking. Mo Ran didn't even have time to close his eyes, let alone dodge. The skin on his face was cut open, and there was a burning pain.Chu Wanning stood with his hands behind his back, coldly standing in the cold night wind. The air was still filled with the foul smell of evil spirits, and now mixed with the smell of human blood, making the forbidden area in the back of the mountain seem even more gloomy and terrifying.The thing that hit Mo Ran was a bunch of willow vines that appeared in Chu Wanning's hand at some point in time. The vine was long and narrow, with green leaves growing on it, and it hung down to the side of his boots.It was obviously such an elegant thing, and should have made people think of poems like \"Slender twists the willow, holding this to send to my lover\".Unfortunately, Chu Wanning was not slender, and he didn't have a lover.The willow vine in his hand was actually a divine weapon, called Heaven's Inquisition.At this moment, Heaven's Inquisition was flowing with a golden red light, illuminating the darkness, and also reflecting Chu Wanning's bottomless eyes brightly.Chu Wanning's lips touched, and he said coldly: \"Mo Weiyu, how dare you.Do you really think I won't control you? \"If it was the real fifteen-year-old Mo Ran, he might not have taken these words seriously, and would have thought that Shizun was just scaring him.However, the Mo Weiyu who had been reborn had long ago used his blood to thoroughly experience his Honored Master's' control 'in his previous life. He immediately felt that his teeth were aching, and his brain was hot. His mouth had already started to refuse to admit it, and he wanted to clear his name.\"Master \u2026\" With blood dripping from his cheeks, Mo Ran raised his eyes, which were filled with a layer of mist.He knew that his current appearance must be extremely pitiful. \"This disciple did not steal \u2026 did not commit adultery \u2026 Shizun, why did you listen to Xue Meng's words and hit me without asking?\"\"\u2026\"Mo Ran had two tricks up his sleeve when dealing with his uncle. First, he had to act cute.Second, act pitiful.Now, he copied the same thing to Chu Wanning. He was so aggrieved that tears were about to fall. \"Could it be that this disciple is so unbearable in your eyes?Why is Master not even willing to give me a chance to defend myself? \"Xue Meng stomped his feet in anger: \"Mo Ran!!You, you lackey!You, you are shameless!Master, don't listen to him. Don't be confused by this bastard!He really stole it!The stolen goods are still here! \"Chu Wanning lowered his eyelashes, his expression cold: \"Mo Ran, you really didn't steal?\"\"Never.\"\"\u2026 You should know the consequences of lying to me.\"Mo Ran had goosebumps. How could he not know?But he still stubbornly refused to admit: \"Master, please judge clearly!\"Chu Wanning raised his hand, and the golden vine swung again. This time, it did not hit Mo Ran's face, but tied Mo Ran up tightly.This feeling was too familiar.The willow vine \"Heaven's Inquisition\" had another function besides whipping people.Chu Wanning stared at Mo Ran, who was firmly bound by Heaven's Inquisition, and asked again: \"Did you steal?\"Mo Ran only felt a familiar sharp pain in his heart, as if a small snake with sharp teeth had suddenly pierced into his chest, churning his internal organs.Accompanying the sharp pain was an irresistible temptation. Mo Ran could not help but open his mouth, his voice hoarse: \"I \u2026 never \u2026 ah \u2026!!\"As if sensing that he was lying, the golden light of Heaven's Inquisition became even more violent. Mo Ran was in so much pain that he broke out in cold sweat, but he still resisted the torture with all his might.This was the second function of Heaven's Inquisition besides whipping people, to provide for interrogation.Once bound by Heaven's Inquisition, no one could lie in front of the master of Heaven's Inquisition. Whether it was a person or a ghost, dead or alive, Heaven's Inquisition had a way to make them speak and tell the answer that Chu Wanning wanted to know.In his previous life, there was only one person who finally managed to keep a secret in front of Heaven's Inquisition with his powerful cultivation.That person was Mo Weiyu, who became the Emperor of the Human Realm.After his rebirth, Mo Ran held on to a glimmer of hope, thinking that he could still resist Heaven's Inquisition's interrogation like he did in the past. But after biting his lips for a long time, large beads of sweat seeped down his dark brows, his whole body trembled, and finally, the pain made him kneel in front of Chu Wanning's boots, gasping for breath.\"I \u2026 I \u2026 stole \u2026\"The pain suddenly disappeared.Before Mo Ran could catch his breath, he heard Chu Wanning ask another question, his voice even colder.\"Did you commit adultery?\"A smart person would not do stupid things. Since he could not resist just now, it was even more impossible now.This time, Mo Ran did not even resist. When the pain hit him, he repeatedly shouted: \"Yes, yes, yes, yes!!!Master, don't want it anymore!Don't want it anymore! \"Xue Meng's face turned green at the side, and said in shock: \"You, how can you \u2026 that Rong Jiu is a man, you actually \u2026\"No one paid attention to him. Heaven's Inquisition's golden light slowly dimmed. Mo Ran gasped for breath, his whole body was drenched as if he had just been fished out of the water. His face was as white as paper, his lips were still trembling, and he fell to the ground, unable to move.Through his sweaty eyelashes, he vaguely saw Chu Wanning's elegant figure wearing a green jade crown, his wide sleeves reaching the ground.A strong sense of hatred suddenly surged in his heart \u2013 Chu Wanning!I was right to treat you like that in my previous life!!Even if I were to live again, I still hate you!F * ck your eighteen generations of ancestors!!Chu Wanning did not know that this evil disciple was going to f * ck his eighteen generations of ancestors. He stood there for a while with a gloomy expression, then said:\"Xue Meng.\"Although Xue Meng knew that men were popular among the rich and powerful nowadays, and that many people played with prostitutes just for the sake of novelty and not because they really liked men, he still found it hard to digest. After a while, he said, \"Shizun, disciple is here.\"\"Mo Ran has committed three crimes: corruption, prostitution, and fraud. Take him to the Hall of Hell to repent.Tomorrow morning, take him to the Good and Evil Stage and punish him in public. \"Xue Meng was shocked: \"Wha, what?Punish him in public? \"Punish him in public means to take the disciple who has committed a crime in front of all the other disciples, and in front of everyone, including the cafeteria's auntie, convict him of a crime, and punish him on the spot.Shameful, shameful.One must know that Mo Ran is a young master at the pinnacle of life and death. Although the sect's rules are strict, because of Mo Ran's special identity, his uncle pitied him for losing his parents when he was young, and had been homeless for 14 years. Because of this, he could not help but protect him. Even if he committed a crime, he would only scold him in private, and never hit him.But his master did not give him any face, and wanted to take his precious nephew to the Good and Evil Stage. He was really going to punish Young Master Mo in front of the entire sect, and make things difficult for him.This was also something that Xue Meng did not expect.To this, Mo Ran was not surprised at all.He lay on the ground with a cold smile on his face.This Master of his was so great, so incorruptible and impartial.Chu Wanning's blood was cold. In his previous life, when Shi Mei died in front of him, Mo Ran cried and begged him, pulling on his clothes, and kneeling on the ground to beg him for help.But Chu Wanning turned a deaf ear to his pleas.Thus, his disciple breathed his last breath in front of him, and Mo Ran cried his heart out beside him, but he just stood there and watched, not caring at all.Now, he was just sending him to the Good and Evil Stage to be dealt with fairly. What was so strange about it?Mo Ran only hated that his cultivation was too weak now. He could not peel off his skin, pull out his tendons, drink his blood, pull his hair and humiliate him. He could not torture him, destroy his dignity, and make him wish he was dead \u2026 \u2026He couldn't hide the animalistic ferocity in his eyes, and Chu Wanning saw it.He glanced at Mo Ran's face. On his refined face, there was no expression.\"What are you thinking about?\"Damn it!Tian Wen had not returned!Mo Ran felt the vines binding him constricting again, and his internal organs were about to be crushed. He cried out in pain, and shouted out the thoughts in his mind.\"Chu Wanning, you are capable!I'll f * ck you to death later! \"Absolute silence.\"\u2026\" Chu Wanning was speechless.Xue Meng was stunned, \"\u2026\"Heaven's Inquisition suddenly returned to Chu Wanning's palm and turned into specks of golden light before disappearing.Heaven's Inquisition was fused into Chu Wanning's bones and blood. It would appear and disappear at any time.Xue Meng's face was deathly pale. He stuttered, \"Ma-m-master \u2026\"Chu Wanning didn't say anything. He lowered his long, black eyelashes and stared at his palm for a while. Then he raised his eyes. Surprisingly, his face didn't collapse, but his expression became colder. He stared at Mo Ran for a moment with a look that said, \"Evil disciple deserves to die.\" Then he said in a low voice,\"Tianwen is broken. I'll go fix it.\"Chu Wanning threw down these words and turned to leave.Xue Meng was a stupid child, \"How can Heaven's Inquisition be broken?\"Chu Wanning heard him and glanced back at him with a look that said, \"Evil disciple deserves to die.\"Xue Meng suddenly shuddered.Mo Ran lay on the ground, dying. His face was dull.He was indeed thinking of finding an opportunity to f * ck Chu Wan-ning to death. He knew that this Grandmaster Chu, who was known as \"Late Night Yu Heng, Northern Dipper Celestial Venerable\", had always paid attention to elegance and integrity. What she couldn't stand the most was being sullied and crushed by others.But how could he let Chu Wanning know about this!Mo Ran whimpered like an abandoned dog and covered his face.Thinking of Chu Wanning's eyes before he left, he felt that he was not far from death.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe scorching sun was overhead.The Peak of Life and Death was a hundred miles wide, with continuous corridors.As a rising star among the various cultivation sects, it was quite different from the famous clans in the upper cultivation world.Take the current flourishing Linyi Confucian Wind Sect as an example. Its main hall was called the Hall of Six Virtues. It hoped that its disciples would have \"wisdom, faith, holiness, righteousness, benevolence, and loyalty.\"The area where the disciples lived was called the Hall of Six Elements. It advised its disciples to have \"filial piety, friendship, harmony, marriage, trust, and compassion.\"The place where the lessons were taught was called the Hall of Six Arts. It referred to the fact that Confucian Wind Sect's disciples had to be proficient in the six arts of etiquette, music, archery, driving, calligraphy, and mathematics.In short, it was boundlessly elegant.On the other hand, the Peak of Life and Death was worthy of being born in poverty. The names it gave were difficult to explain in a few words. \"Core Heart Hall\" and \"Good and Evil Hall\" were both good names. It was probably because Mo Ran's father and uncle didn't study much that they couldn't think of more than a few words. They started to mess around, displaying a talent for naming things like \"Xue Ya.\"Therefore, the Peak of Life and Death copied many of the names of the underworld. For example, the secret room where the disciples reflected was called Yama Hall.The jade bridge connecting the resting area and the teaching area was called the Bridge of Helplessness.The dining hall was called the Meng Po Lobby, the martial arts field was called the Mountain of Blades and Sea of Flames, the forbidden area behind the mountain was called the Room of Dead Ghosts, and so on.These were still considered good names. The more remote places were simply called \"This is Mountain\", \"This is Water\", and \"This is Pit\". There were also the famous \"Ah Ah Ah\" and \"Wa Wa Wa\" cliffs.Naturally, the sleeping halls of the elders couldn't escape this mold. Each of them had their own nickname.Chu Wanning was naturally no exception. He was a person who liked peace and quiet and didn't want to live with others. His residence was on the South Peak of Life and Death, hidden in a sea of green bamboo. There was a pond in front of the courtyard. In the pond, red lotuses covered the sun. Because of the abundant spiritual power, the lotuses in the pond bloomed all year round, dazzling like red clouds.The disciples secretly called this place with beautiful scenery \u2014Red Lotus Hell.Thinking of this, Mo Ran couldn't help but laugh.Who asked Chu Wanning to have a feminine face all day long? When the disciples saw him, it was as if they had seen an Asura ghost. If the place where the ghost stayed was not called hell, then what was it called?Xue Meng interrupted his reverie, \"How can you still laugh?Hurry up and finish your breakfast. After that, follow me to the Good and Evil Platform. Master will punish you in front of everyone today! \"Mo Ran sighed and touched the whip mark on his face. \"Ouch \u2026 it hurts.\"\"Serves you right!\"\"Sigh, I wonder if Heaven's Inquisition has fixed it. If not, don't use it to interrogate me again. Who knows what nonsense I will spout again.\"Facing Mo Ran's sincere worry, Xue Meng's face turned red. He said angrily, \"If you dare to say anything indecent to Master in front of everyone, see if I don't pull out your tongue!\"Mo Ran covered his face and waved his hand. He said faintly, \"You don't need to pull it out, you don't need to pull it out. If Master uses the willow vine to tie me up again, I will kill myself on the spot to prove my innocence.\"When the time came, Mo Ran was brought to the Good and Evil Platform according to the rules. He looked around and saw a sea of deep blue people below.The disciples of the Life and Death Summit all wore the sect's robes. They wore light armors that were so blue that it was almost black. They had a lion's head belt, and the silver edges of their armguards and robes were shining brightly.The sun rose from the east. Under the Good and Evil Platform, there was a sea of light.Mo Ran knelt on the platform and listened to Elder Si Lv read out a long list of crimes in front of him.\"Elder Yu Heng's disciple, Mo Weiyu, has ignored the rules of the sect, ignored the teachings, did not follow the sect's rules, and has lost all morality.He has violated the fourth, ninth, and fifteenth commandments of the sect. According to the rules, he should be beaten eighty times, copied a hundred times, and grounded for one month.Mo Weiyu, do you have anything to say? \"Mo Ran looked at the white figure in the distance.That was the only Elder on the Life and Death Summit who did not wear the same blue robes with silver edges.Chu Wanning had a white satin robe and a silver mist silk cloth as a thin cover. It was as if he was covered with the frost of the Ninth Heaven, but he looked even colder than the frost.He sat there quietly, some distance away. Mo Ran could not see the expression on his face clearly, but he knew that this person was unperturbed.Taking a deep breath, Mo Ran said, \"I have nothing to say.\"The Disciplinary Elder followed the rules and asked the disciples below, \"If there is anyone who is not satisfied with the verdict, or has a statement to make, you can speak now.\"The disciples below began to hesitate, looking at each other in dismay.None of them expected that Elder Yu Heng, Chu Wanning, would actually send his own disciple to the Good and Evil Stage and punish him in public.To put it nicely, this was called being impartial. To put it bluntly, this was called a cold-blooded demon.The cold-blooded demon Chu Wanning indifferently supported his chin and sat in his seat. Suddenly, someone used the Sound Amplification Technique to shout, \"Elder Yu Heng, this disciple is willing to plead for mercy for Junior Brother Mo.\"\"\u2026 Plead for mercy?\"That disciple clearly felt that Mo Ran was the Lord's nephew. Even if he had made a mistake now, his future would still be bright. So he decided to use this opportunity to curry favor with Mo Ran.He began to talk nonsense, \"Although Junior Brother Mo has made a mistake, he usually loves his fellow disciples and helps the weak. Elder, please consider that his nature is not evil and give him a lenient sentence!\"Clearly, there was more than one person who wanted to curry favor with Junior Brother Mo.Gradually, more and more people spoke up for Mo Ran. There were all kinds of strange reasons. Even Mo Ran himself felt awkward when he heard them. When did he have a \"pure heart and care for the world\"?This was a punishment meeting, not a commendation meeting, right?\"Elder Yu Heng, Junior Brother Mo once helped me get rid of demons and killed troublesome Fierce Beasts. I am willing to ask for a reward for Junior Brother Mo. His merits offset his faults. I hope that Elder can reduce his sentence!\"\"Elder Yu Heng, Junior Brother Mo once helped me remove my inner demons when I was suffering from Qi Deviation. I believe that Junior Brother Mo made a mistake this time because he was confused. I hope that Elder can reduce Junior Brother's punishment!\"\"Elder Yu Heng, Junior Brother Mo once gave me a miraculous elixir to save my mother. He is a kind person. I hope that Elder can punish him lightly!\"The last person's story was snatched away by the previous person, so he had nothing to say for a moment. When he saw Chu Wanning's cold eyes sweeping over, he suddenly thought of an idea and blurted out, \"Elder Yu Heng, Junior Martial Brother Mo once assisted me in Dual Cultivation \u2026\"\"Pfft.\" Someone couldn't hold back his laughter.That disciple's face instantly turned red and he retreated embarrassedly.\"Yu Heng, calm down, calm down \u2026\" Seeing that the situation was not good, the disciplinary elder hurriedly tried to persuade him.Chu Wanning coldly said, \"I have never seen such a shameless person.What is his name?Whose disciple is he? \"The disciplinary elder slightly hesitated, then braced himself and said softly, \"My disciple Yao Lian.\"Chu Wanning raised his eyebrows, \"Your disciple?Shameless? \"The disciplinary elder couldn't help but feel awkward. He blushed and changed the topic, \"His singing is not bad. He can be of help when we take him in as a sacrifice.\"Chu Wanning snorted and turned his face away. He was too lazy to talk nonsense with this shameless disciplinary elder.There were thousands of people on the Life and Death Summit. It was normal for there to be more than ten lackeys.Mo Ran looked at the few brothers who were speaking so confidently. He almost believed them. So it turns out that he wasn't the only one who was good at lying with his eyes wide open. There were so many talents in the sect.Chu Wanning, who had been chanted \"Elder Yu Heng, please have mercy\" countless times, finally spoke to the disciples.\"Plead for Mo Weiyu?\" He paused and said, \"Okay, all of you come up.\"Those people didn't know what to do, so they trembled and went up.Chu Wanning's palm flashed with a golden light. Heaven's Inquisition obeyed and came out. With a whoosh, it tied the dozen people into a ball and firmly tied them in place.Again!!Mo Ran was on the verge of despair. His legs turned to jelly when he saw Heaven's Inquisition. He really didn't know where Chu Wanning got such an abnormal weapon. Luckily, he didn't marry in his previous life. Any girl who married him would either be whipped to death or interrogated to death.Chu Wanning's eyes were full of ridicule. He asked one of them, \"Did Mo Ran help you get rid of demons?\"That disciple couldn't resist Heaven's Inquisition's torture. He immediately shouted, \"No!No! \"Then he asked another, \"Did Mo Ran help you get rid of Qigong Deviation?\"\"Ah ah!!No!No! \"\"Mo Ran gave you elixirs?\"\"Ah \u2014 \u2014!Help!No no no!I made it up!I made it up! \"Chu Wanning loosened the ropes, but then he waved his hand fiercely. Sparks flew everywhere. Heaven's Inquisition was suddenly thrown out, hitting the backs of those lying disciples.In an instant, screams were heard, and blood splattered everywhere.Chu Wanning frowned and said angrily, \"What are you shouting for?Kneel down!Discipline Master! \"\"Here.\"\"Punish them!\"\"Yes!\"In the end, not only did those people not get any benefits, but they also violated the Rhythm of Deception and were each beaten ten times with the rod. In addition, Elder Yu Heng also gave them a willow vine.When night fell, Mo Ran lay on the bed. Although he had already applied medicine, his back was full of scars. He couldn't even turn over. He was in so much pain that tears welled up in his eyes and he kept sniffling.He was born cute. His whimpering and curled up appearance made him look like a beaten kitten. Unfortunately, the content of his thoughts was not what a kitten should have.He grabbed the blanket and bit the bedsheets, imagining that this was Chu Wanning. He bit!Kick!Kick!Tear!His only consolation was that Shi Mei came to visit him with the handmade wooden hands. Being stared at by those gentle eyes, Mo Ran's tears fell even more fiercely.He didn't care about the saying that men don't cry easily. He loved to act spoiled with whoever he liked.\"Is it that painful?Can you still get up? \"Shi Mei sat by his bedside and sighed.\" Shizun, he \u2026 he was too ruthless with his actions.Look at you \u2026 there are a few wounds, and the blood hasn't stopped yet. \"Mo Ran heard that he was worried about him, and a warm feeling gradually rose in his chest. He lifted his bright eyes from the blanket and blinked.\"Shi Mei, since you care so much about me, I, I don't feel pain anymore.\"\"Ah, look at you, how can it not hurt?You know Shizun's temperament. Will you still dare to make such a big mistake in the future? \"Under the candlelight, Shi Mei looked at him with some helplessness and heartache. Those eyes were full of emotions, rippling like warm spring water.Mo Ran's heart moved slightly, and he obediently said, \"I won't do it again.I swear. \"\"When have you ever taken your oath seriously?\" Although she said that, Shi Mi finally smiled. \"If your hands turn cold, can you even get up?If you can't get up, just lie down. I'll feed you. \"Mo Ran was already halfway up, but when he heard this, he immediately collapsed to the ground.Shi Mei: \"\u2026 \u2026\"Whether it was in his previous life or in this life, Mo Ran's favorite food was the handmade wooden hands made by Shi Mei. The skin was thin like smoke, and the stuffing was tender like congealed fat. Every handmade wooden hands were full, smooth, soft, and fragrant. They melted in the mouth and left a fragrance in the mouth.Especially the soup, which was white and mellow. It was sprinkled with green onions, tender egg shreds, and a spoonful of chili oil that was stir-fried with garlic. When it entered the stomach, it was as if it could warm the stomach for a lifetime.Shi Mei carefully fed him spoonful by spoonful. As he fed him, he said, \"I didn't put chili oil today. You're badly injured, so it's not easy to eat spicy food. Just drink the bone soup.\"Mo Ran stared at him, unable to move his eyes away. He smiled and said, \"It doesn't matter if it's spicy or not. As long as it's made by you, it's delicious.\"\"You really know how to talk.\"Shi Mei also smiled and picked up a poached egg lying in the soup. \"I'll give you a soft one. I know you like it.\"Mo Ran laughed. A bunch of messy hair stuck up on his forehead like a blooming flower. \"Shi Mei.\"\"What's wrong?\"\"Nothing, I'm just calling you.\"\"\u2026 \u2026\"His ahoge swayed.\"Shi Mei.\"Shi Mei held back his laughter. \"You're just calling me?\"\"Yes, yes. I'm just calling you. I feel so happy.\"Shi Mei was stunned for a moment. He gently touched his forehead. \"This silly child, don't tell me you have a fever?\"Mo Ran burst out laughing. He rolled half over and looked at him sideways. His eyes were bright, as if they were full of stars.\"If I could eat Shi Mei's wontons every day, that would be great.\"This was not a lie.After Shi Mei's death, Mo Ran had always wanted to taste his wontons again. However, that kind of taste could never come back.At that time, Chu Wanning had not completely broken off with him. He did not know if it was because of guilt, but when he saw Mo Ran kneeling in front of Shi Mei's coffin in a daze, Chu Wanning quietly went to the kitchen, kneaded the dough, and carefully wrapped a few wontons.But before he finished wrapping the wontons, Mo Ran saw it. Mo Ran, who had lost his love, could not bear it. He only felt that Chu Wanning's behavior was mocking him. It was a clumsy imitation. It was deliberately hurting him.Shi Mei was dead. Chu Wanning could have saved him, but he refused to help. After that, he even wanted to wrap Shi Mei's wontons for him to eat. Did he think that this would make him happy?He rushed into the kitchen and knocked over all the utensils. The snow white wontons rolled all over the floor.He roared at Chu Wanning. \"Who do you think you are?Do you think you deserve to eat his things?Do you think you deserve to cook his dishes?Shi Mei is dead. Are you satisfied?Will you only be satisfied after you drive all of your disciples to their deaths and drive them insane?Chu Wanning!There is no one else in this world who can make that bowl of wontons. No matter how much you try to imitate him, you won't be able to do it! \"Today, he ate this bowl happily and emotionally. He slowly ate to the end. Although he was still smiling, his eyes were somewhat moist.Fortunately, the candlelight was dim, so Shi Mei could not see his subtle expression.Mo Ran said, \"Shi Mei.\"\"Yes?\"\"Thank you.\"Shi Mei was stunned. Then, he gently smiled. \"Isn't it just a bowl of wontons?You don't have to be so polite with me. If you like it, I'll make it for you often in the future. \"Mo Ran wanted to say, \"I'm not just thanking you for the bowl of wontons.I want to thank you. Whether it was in the previous life or in this life, only you really looked up to me. You didn't mind my background, nor did you mind my unscrupulous 14 years of climbing up the ladder.I also want to thank you. If it wasn't because I suddenly thought of you, after my rebirth, I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to resist killing Rong Jiu. Then, I'll make a big mistake and walk the same path as before.Fortunately, in this life, before you die, I will definitely protect you well. If something happens to you and Chu Wanning, that cold-blooded demon, is not willing to save you, there's still me. \"But how could he say these words out loud?In the end, Mo Ran finished the soup in one gulp. Not even a stalk of scallion was left. He licked his lips as if he hadn't had enough. His dimples were deep, making him look like a cute kitten.\"Do you have more tomorrow?\"Shi Mei did not know whether to laugh or cry. \"Don't you want to change to something else?Aren't you tired of it? \"\"I'm not tired of eating it every day. I'm just afraid you'll find me annoying.\"Shi Mei shook his head and laughed. \"I don't know if there's enough flour. If there's not enough, I'm afraid I won't be able to make it. If that's not enough, how about egg in sugar water?It's your favorite. \"\"Okay, okay.As long as it's yours, anything is fine. \"Mo Ran was overjoyed. He was so happy that he wanted to hug his blanket and roll around.Look at how virtuous Shi Mei is. Chu Wanning, you can hit me as much as you want!Anyway, when I'm lying on the bed, I still have a beauty to care for me. Hmph!When he thought of his Shizun, he couldn't help but feel angry.Mo Ran started to pick at the seam of the bed again. He thought to himself, \"What Wanye Yuheng, what Beidou Celestial Venerable, it's all bullsh * t!Chu Wanning, let's wait and see in this life! \"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMo Ran lay on the bed like a dead fish for three days. His wounds had just healed when he received a message telling him to go to the Red Lotus Pavilion to work as a laborer.This was also part of his punishment. During Mo Ran's confinement, he was not allowed to leave the mountain, but he could not be idle either. He had to help the sect with odd jobs and do some hard work.Generally speaking, these errands were for example: helping the aunties at Granny Meng Hall wash dishes, scrubbing the three hundred and sixty-five stone lions on the pillars of the Bridge of Helplessness, transcribing extremely dull archives, and so on.But what kind of place was the Red Lotus Pavilion?It was the residence of that grandson Chu Wanning. People called it the Red Lotus Hell's Asura Field.Not many people had been to the Peak of Life and Death, and those who had come out either had their arms or legs broken.Therefore, other than the Red Lotus Hell, Chu Wanning's residence also had a more down-to-earth nickname: Broken Leg Waterside Pavilion.There was a joke in the sect: \"The waterside pavilion hides a beauty, and the beauty summons Tianwen.Enter my Broken Leg Sect, and you will know the pain of my broken legs.Elder Yu Heng is the best choice to help you destroy your own meridians. \"There was once a female disciple who was not afraid of death and was bold enough to drool over Elder Yu Heng's beauty. Taking advantage of the dark night, she secretly snuck to the South Peak and clung to the eaves, intending to peep at the elder bathing and changing clothes.The result was obvious. That female warrior was beaten half to death by Tianwen. She cried for her father and mother and laid on the bed for over a hundred days without getting up.Chu Wanning even said that if she dared to do it again, he would gouge out her eyes.See?What ungentlemanly words!What an unromantic behavior!What a hair-raising man!In the sect, there were originally some na\u00efve and naive girls who thought that Elder Yu Heng would have protective feelings for the fairer sex. They always laughed and joked in front of him, vainly trying to attract the elder's attention.But after the elder killed that female rogue, no one dared to have any ideas about him.Elder Chu Wanning was a man and a woman. He was not a gentleman at all. Other than his good looks, he was not good at anything else. This was the evaluation of Chu Wanning by the disciples of the sect.The Junior Brother who came to deliver the message looked at Mo Ran sympathetically. He tried to restrain himself, but in the end, he couldn't. \"Senior Brother Mo \u2026\"\"Hmm?\"\"\u2026 Elder Yuheng's temper is so bad. None of the people who went to the Red Lotus Waterside Pavilion could come out standing. Why don't you say that your wound hasn't healed yet and beg Elder Yuheng to let you go wash dishes?\"Mo Ran was very grateful for his junior brother's kindness and rejected him.Beg Chu Wanning?Forget it, he did not want to be served by Tian Wen again.Thus, he put on his clothes with great effort and dragged his heavy footsteps towards the South Peak, the peak of life and death, with great reluctance.Red Lotus Waterside Pavilion, Red Lotus Hell, Chu Wanning's residence. There was not a single living person within a hundred li of him.No one was willing to go near the place where he lived. Chu Wan-ning's terrible taste and unpredictable personality made everyone in the sect keep a respectful distance from him.Mo Ran was a little nervous. He didn't know what Chu Wanning would punish him for. Along the way to the South Peak, he let his imagination run wild. After passing through layers upon layers of bamboo forests, a large expanse of beautiful red lotuses came into view.It was early in the morning. The sun rose from the east, shining brilliantly on the horizon. The fiery red clouds and the red lotus leaves in the pond complemented each other. It was vast and mighty, and the waves of light flickered.The winding corridors and waterside pavilions on the pond were graceful and quiet. A curtain of water fell from the mountain. Tiny sparkling droplets of water knocked against the stone walls with tinkling sounds. The mist rose, and the smoke condensed. There was a hint of enchantment in the tranquility.Mo Ran's feelings towards this were:Retch.No matter how beautiful Chu Wanning's residence was, he would still retch no matter what!Look, how extravagant and extravagant. The disciples' residences were all closely connected. The rooms did not occupy a large area. Elder Yu Heng, on the other hand, occupied an entire mountain by himself. He even dug three large ponds and planted them full of lotuses. Fine, although these lotuses were special species and could be refined into Holy Grade medicine, but \u2014 \u2014In any case, he just didn't like it.He hated that he couldn't burn down this waterside pavilion!Although he cursed in his heart, considering that he was sixteen years old this year and couldn't compete with Grandmaster Chu, Mo Ran still came to Chu Wanning's residence. He stood at the door, narrowed his eyes, and sweetly opened his mouth to speak like a grandson.\"Disciple Mo Ran greets Master.\"\"Mm, come in.\"The room was a mess. The cold-blooded devil Chu Wanning wore a white robe. The lapels of his robe were folded high and tight, giving off a somewhat ascetic aura.Today, he wore a high ponytail and black metal gauntlets. He sat on the ground fiddling with a pile of mechanical parts. He even had a pen in his mouth.He glanced at Mo Ran expressionlessly. He bit the pen and said vaguely, \"Come here.\"Mo Ran went over.This was really difficult because there was no place for one to stand in this room. Drawings and metal pieces were scattered everywhere.Mo Ran's eyebrows twitched. In his previous life, he had never entered Chu Wanning's room. He didn't know that this well-dressed handsome man's residence was actually so messy \u2026 It was hard to explain in a few words.\"What is Master doing?\"\"God of Night.\"\"What?\"Chu Wanning was a little impatient. Perhaps it was because it was inconvenient to speak because of the pen in his mouth. \"God of Night.\"Mo Ran silently looked at the messy pile of parts on the ground.This Master of his was known as Grandmaster Chu, and it was not an undeserved reputation.In all fairness, Chu Wanning was an extremely valiant man. Whether it was his three Divine Weapons, his Spirit Formation Technique, or his Mechanism Creation Technique, they were all worthy of the four words \"Peak of Perfection\".This was also the reason why even though his temper was so bad and he was so hard to please, all the major Immortal Cultivation Sects still fought over him.Mo Ran, who had been reborn, was very clear about the \"God of Night\".It was a type of Mech that Chu Wanning made. It was cheap and its battle power was strong. It could protect ordinary people in the Cultivation World at night and not be disturbed by ordinary ghosts.In his previous life, the well-made God of Night was an essential Mech for almost every family. The price of one was equivalent to a broom, and its effect was much better than that of a grinning door god.After Chu Wanning died, these God of Night continued to protect those poor families who couldn't afford a Daoist priest.This compassion for the state of the universe and the fate of mankind, coupled with Chu Wanning's heartlessness towards his disciples \u2026 Hehe, it really made Mo Ran despise him.Mo Ran sat down and looked at the \"God of Night\" that was still just a pile of parts. Memories of the past slowly slipped from the bottom of his heart. He couldn't help but pick up a finger joint of the God of Night and hold it in his hand to examine it carefully.Chu Wanning finally had his hands free after buckling up the parts. He took down the pen in his mouth and glared at Mo Ran. \"That was just covered in tung oil, you can't touch it.\"\"Oh \u2026\" Mo Ran put down the finger joint and adjusted his mood. He still had a harmless and cute appearance. He asked with a smile, \"Did Shizun call me over to ask me for help?\"Chu Wanning said, \"Yes.\"\"Do what?\"\"Tidy up the house.\"Mo Ran's smile froze. He looked at the quake-like room: \"\u2026\"Chu Wanning was a genius in immortal arts, but he was also an idiot in life.After cleaning up the fifth broken teacup, Mo Ran couldn't take it anymore. \"Shizun, how long has it been since you cleaned up this room?Oh my god, it's so messy! \"Chu Wanning was looking at the blueprints. He didn't even raise his head. \"About a year.\"Mo Ran: \"\u2026\"\"Where do you usually sleep?\"\"What?\"There might be a problem with the blueprint. Chu Wanning was disturbed, so he was even more impatient than usual. He rubbed his hair and angrily replied, \"Of course it's to sleep on the bed.\"Mo Ran glanced at the bed. On top of it were piles of various mechas that were almost completed. There were also a series of tools like saws, axes, files, and so on. All of them gleamed coldly and were incomparably sharp.Amazing. Why didn't this person cut off his own head when he slept?After working for half a day, the floor was filled with wood shavings and dust, and the white towels on the bookcase were blackened by more than ten. By noon, he was only halfway done.Fuck Chu Wanning. This person was even more poisonous than a poisonous woman.Tidying up the room didn't seem like a serious punishment, and it didn't sound like hard labor. But who knew that it was such a damned place that hadn't been cleaned for 365 days?Not to mention that he was full of scars, even if he was healthy now, this kind of torment would be half dead!\"Shizun \u2026\"\"Yes?\"\"Your pile of clothes \u2026\" It had been piled up for about three months.Chu Wanning finally fixed one of God of Night's arms. He rubbed his sore shoulder, looked up at the clothes piled up like a mountain, and said coldly, \"I'll wash it myself.\"Mo Ran sighed in relief and thanked the heavens. Then he was a little curious. \"Eh?Master knows how to wash clothes? \"Chu Wanning glanced at him. After a while, he said coldly, \"What's so difficult about that?Throw them into the water, soak them for a while, then scoop them up and dry them. \"\"\u2026\" She really didn't know how those young ladies who yearned for Grandmaster Chu would feel after hearing this sentence.Mo Ran deeply felt that this impressive-looking but useless man was really disgusting. If he were to speak of this, it would shatter a lot of romantic feelings.\"It's getting late. Come with me to the dining hall. We'll deal with the rest when we get back.\"People were coming and going in the Meng Po Lobby. The disciples of the Peak of Life and Death were eating in groups of three to five. Chu Wanning took a lacquered wooden tray with a few dishes and silently sat in a corner.With him as the center, a twenty foot radius around him gradually became empty.No one dared to sit too close to Elder Yu Heng. They were afraid that if he was unhappy, he would throw Heaven's Inquisition out and beat them up.Chu Wanning was actually very clear about this, but he didn't mind. A cold beauty sat there, eating the food in his bowl in a refined manner.But today, it was a little different.He was the one who brought Mo Ran here, so he naturally had to be by his side.Others were afraid of him, and Mo Ran was also afraid. But in any case, he was a person who had died once. His fear of Chu Wanning was not that strong.Especially after the fear of meeting for the first time gradually disappeared. The hatred he had for Chu Wanning in his previous life slowly emerged.So what if Chu Wanning was powerful?Didn't he still die in his previous life?Mo Ran sat in front of him and calmly chewed the sweet and sour pork ribs in his bowl. Crunching sounds came out as he chewed. Soon, the bones formed a small mountain.Chu Wanning suddenly threw down his chopsticks.Mo Ran was stunned.\"\u2026 Can you not smack your lips when you eat?\"\"I'm chewing bones. If I don't smack my lips, how can I chew?\"\"Then don't eat the bones.\"\"But I like to eat bones.\"\"Scram to the side to eat.\"The sound of the two quarreling grew louder and louder. Some disciples were already stealing glances at them.Mo Ran resisted the urge to dump the bowl on Chu Wanning's head and pursed his oily lips. After a while, he narrowed his eyes and smiled sweetly.\"Master, don't shout so loudly.If others hear this, won't they laugh at us? \"Chu Wanning had always been thin-skinned. As expected, he softened his voice and said in a low voice, \"Scram.\"Mo Ran laughed so hard that he almost fell over.\"\u2026\" Chu Wanning was speechless.\"Hey, Master, don't glare at me. Eat, eat.I'll try to be quiet. \"After Mo Ran had enough of laughing, he began to pretend to be well-behaved again. As expected, the sound of him gnawing on the bone was much quieter.Chu Wanning was amenable to coaxing but not coercion. Seeing that Mo Ran was obedient, his expression softened. He lowered his head and ate his vegetables and tofu in a refined manner.After not being quiet for too long, Mo Ran began to act up again.He didn't know what was wrong with him. In short, in this life, whenever he saw Chu Wanning, he wanted to act up and make him angry.Thus, Chu Wanning found that although Mo Ran was no longer chewing loudly, he began to eat the ribs with his hands. His hands were greasy and the sauce was shiny.The veins on Chu Wanning's forehead bulged as he endured.He lowered his eyelashes and didn't look at Mo Ran. He ate by himself.Perhaps because Mo Ran was eating too happily and forgot himself, he accidentally threw the bone into Chu Wanning's bowl.Chu Wanning stared at the messy ribs. The air around him froze at a speed visible to the naked eye.\"Mo Ran \u2026 \u2026!!!\"\"Shizun \u2026 \u2026\" Mo Ran was rather frightened. He didn't know how much of it was real and how much of it was fake. \"That \u2026 \u2026 uh, I didn't do it on purpose.\"As if.\"\u2026 \u2026\"\"Don't be angry. I'll take it out for you.\"After saying that, he really reached out with his chopsticks and stuck them into Chu Wanning's bowl. He quickly took away the ribs.Chu Wanning's face was ashen. He looked like he was about to faint from disgust.Mo Ran's eyelashes fluttered. His delicate face looked rather pitiful. \"Is Shizun despising me?\"\"\u2026 \u2026\"\"Shizun, I'm sorry.\"Forget it.Chu Wanning thought to himself.There was no need to argue with a junior.He gave up the impulse to summon Heaven's Inquisition to beat up Mo Ran. However, his appetite was gone. He stood up and said, \"I'm full.\"\"Eh?You only ate so little?Shizun, you didn't even touch your bowl. \"Chu Wanning said coldly, \"I'm not hungry.\"Mo Ran was so happy that his heart was blooming like a flower. He said sweetly, \"Then I won't eat either. Come, let's go back to the Red Lotus Land \u2014 \u2014 cough, the Red Lotus Water Pavilion.\"Chu Wanning narrowed his eyes. \"Us?\" There was a hint of ridicule in his eyes. He said, \"Who's' us' with you?Seniority is order. You better speak properly. \"Mo Ran responded diligently. His eyes curved into crescents. He was obedient, sensible, and cute.However, this person was thinking in his heart. Seniority?Speak properly?Haha. If Chu Wanning knew what happened in his past life, he should know that in the end, only he, Mo Weiyu, was respected in this world.No matter how noble, arrogant, and insufferably arrogant Chu Wanning was, in the end, he was still a piece of mud under his boots. He had to rely on his charity in order to survive.Mo Ran quickly caught up with his Shizun's footsteps. There was still a bright smile on his face.If Shi Mei was the white moonlight in his heart, then Chu Wanning was the broken fishbone stuck in his throat. He had to pull this fishbone out and crush it, or swallow it and let it be corroded by gastric juices.In short, in this rebirth, he could let go of anyone.But he definitely would not let go of Chu Wanning.However, Chu Wanning did not seem to want to let him go so easily.Mo Ran stood in front of the Red Lotus Land's library. Looking at the fifty rows of ten high bookshelves, he thought that he had misheard.\"Shizun, what \u2026 did you say?\"Chu Wanning said indifferently, \"Wipe all the books here.\"\"\u2026\"\"Register them after wiping them.\"\"\u2026\"\"I'll check them tomorrow morning.\"\u201c\uff01\uff01\uff01\u201dWhat!!!Was he going to stay in the Red Lotus Land tonight??But he had made an appointment with Shi Mei. He would let Shi Mei change his dressing tonight!!!He opened his mouth, wanting to bargain, but Chu Wanning could not be bothered with him. He waved his wide sleeves, turned around, and went to the machine room. He even coldly closed the door of the machine room.Mo Ran, whose date was ruined, fell into a deep disgust for Chu Wanning. He wanted to burn all of Chu Wanning's books!!No!His mind turned and he thought of an even worse idea \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChu Wanning's taste was truly terrible.Tedious.Dry.Despairing.Look at this shelf, what kind of lousy books are these!\"Ancient Enchantments Catalog\", \"Illustrations of Exotic Flowers and Rare Herbs\", \"Linyi Ru Feng Men Qin Score\", and \"Collection of Plants\". The only thing that could be considered as a pastime was probably a few \"Travels in Shu Land\" and \"Shu Shu Food Records\".Mo Ran picked a few relatively new books. Obviously, Chu Wanning did not read them often. He smeared over all the pages and drew a bunch of erotic pictures.As he drew, he thought, \"Hmph, hmph, there are at least eight thousand books here. When Chu Wanning finds out that a few of them have been changed to forbidden books, who knows how long it will be. When that time comes, Chu Wanning will definitely not know who did it and can only sulk. How wonderful, how wonderful.\"As he thought about it, he could not help but laugh out loud while hugging the books.Mo Ran smeared over a dozen books in a row. Using his imagination, he drew all kinds of erotic pictures. His brushwork could be said to be elegant and graceful.If someone asked Elder Yu Heng to borrow books and happened to borrow these few books, there would probably be rumors spread \u2014 \u2014\"Elder Yu Heng has a beast's heart. He actually secretly included pictures of men and women having sex in the\" Art of Tranquility \"!\"\"Elder Yu Heng is unworthy of being a teacher. There are pictures of gay men in the sword manual!\"\"What Northern Dipper Celestial Venerable? A beast in human clothing!\"The more Mo Ran thought about it, the funnier it became. In the end, he simply held his stomach and rolled around on the ground with his brush. He was so happy that he did not even notice that someone had walked to the entrance of the library.So when Shi Mei came over, he saw Mo Ran rolling around in a pile of books, laughing like crazy.Shi Mei: \"\u2026 \u2026 Mo Ran, what are you doing?\"Mo Ran was stunned. He immediately sat up and hurriedly covered up the erotic pictures. He put on a pretentious face and said, \"Wipe, wipe the floor.\"Shi Mei held back his laughter. \"Wipe the floor with your clothes?\"\"Cough, I didn't find a rag.Let's not talk about this anymore. Shi Mei, why are you here so late at night? \"\"I went to your room to look for you, but I couldn't find you. I asked someone else and found out that you were with Master.\"Shi Mei entered the library and helped Mo Ran put away the books that were piled all over the floor. He smiled gently and said, \"I have nothing to do, so I came to see you.\"Mo Ran was very happy and flattered. He pursed his lips. He had always been a smooth-talker, but he was at a loss for words.\"Then \u2026 hmm \u2026 then you sit!\"After running around excitedly for a while, Mo Ran said nervously, \"I, I'll go get you some tea.\"\"No need, I came here quietly. If Master finds out, it'll be troublesome.\"Mo Ran scratched his head. \"That's true \u2026 \u2026\" Chu Wanning, that pervert!Sooner or later, I'll topple him and won't submit to his despotic power!\"You haven't eaten dinner yet, right?I brought some dishes for you. \"Mo Ran's eyes lit up. \"Dragon Suan Shou?\"\"Pfft, you're really not sick of it.I didn't bring my Dragon Suan Shou. The Red Lotus Pavilion is far away, so I was afraid that it would get stuck if I brought it.Here, some stir-fried dishes. See if they're to your taste? \"Shi Mei opened the food box on the side. Sure enough, there were several bright red dishes inside.There was a plate of wind ear, a plate of shredded pork with garlic sauce, a plate of chicken cubes, a plate of cucumber with garlic sauce, and a bowl of rice.\"Hey, did you put in chili?\"\"I was afraid you'd be hungry, so I put in a little bit.\"Shi Mei laughed. He and Mo Ran both loved spicy food, so they naturally knew the principle of eating spicy food. \"But your wound hasn't fully healed yet, so I didn't dare to put too much. It's better to add a little bit of flavor than not having any red at all.\"Mo Ran happily bit his chopsticks. His dimples were as sweet as honey under the candlelight. \"Wow!I'm so moved I want to cry! \"Shi Mei held back his laughter. \"By the time you're done crying, the food will be cold.Eat before you cry. \"Mo Ran cheered and swung his chopsticks quickly.When he ate, he was like a starving dog. Chu Wanning couldn't get used to seeing him eat like a ghost, but Shi Mei didn't mind.Shi Mei was always gentle. He smiled and told him to eat slowly while passing him a cup of tea.Soon, the plate was empty. Mo Ran rubbed his stomach and sighed. He closed his eyes and sighed. \"Satisfied \u2026\"Shi Mei seemed to ask casually, \"Is the Dragon Suan Shou better, or these dishes?\"Mo Ran was very infatuated with food, just like how he was with his first love.He tilted his head and looked at Shi Mei with his black and soft eyes. He grinned. \"Dragon Suan Shou.\"\"\u2026 \u2026\" Shi Mei smiled and shook his head.After a while, he said, \"Mo Ran, let me help you change the dressing.\"The ointment was made by Madam Wang.In her early years, Madam Wang was a disciple of the \"Lone Moon's Night\" of the Medicine Sect. She was weak in martial arts and didn't like fighting and killing, but she liked to study medicine. There was a medicinal garden at the Peak of Life and Death. She personally planted many precious plants there, so there was never a lack of medicine in the sect.Mo Ran took off his shirt and turned his back to Shi Mei. The scar on his back was still aching, but Shi Mei dipped his warm fingers in the ointment and rubbed it away. Gradually, he forgot about the pain and became restless.\"Okay.\" Shi Mei wrapped a new bandage around Mo Ran's back and carefully tied a knot. \"Put on your clothes.\"Mo Ran turned his head and looked at Shi Mei.Under the dim candlelight, Shi Mei's skin was white as snow. He looked even more charming. His mouth was dry and he really didn't want to put on his clothes. After hesitating for a while, he lowered his head and quickly put on his coat.\"Shi Mei.\"\"Hmm?\"In such a secluded study, the atmosphere between a single man and a single man was very good.Mo Ran originally wanted to say something touching, but he was an illiterate person who could even change his era name to \"Halberd Bo\". After holding back for a long time, his face was red from holding back, but he only managed to squeeze out two words. \"You're so nice.\"\"What's wrong with that? It's what I should do.\"\"I'll be especially nice to you.\"Mo Ran's tone was very calm, but his sweaty palms betrayed his surging heart. \"When I'm strong enough, no one can bully you.Not even Shizun. \"Shi Mei didn't know why he suddenly said this. He was stunned for a moment, but still said gently, \"Okay. Then in the future, I'll have to rely on Mo Ran.\"\"Yes, yes \u2026\"Mo Ran hesitantly agreed, but Shi Mei's flirtatious gaze made him even more anxious. He didn't dare to look at him again and lowered his head.He had always been very careful with this person, even stubbornly stubborn.\"Ah, Shizun wants you to wipe so many books?And make them overnight? \"Mo Ran still wanted to save face in front of his sweetheart. \"It's okay. If I hurry, there's still time.\"Shi Mei said, \"Let me help you.\"\"How can that be? If Shizun finds out, he'll definitely punish you as well.\" Mo Ran was very firm. \"It's getting late. You should go back and rest. There's still morning cultivation tomorrow.\"Shi Mei pulled his hand and laughed softly. \"It's okay. He won't find out. We'll quietly \u2026\"Before he finished speaking, he heard a cold voice.\"Quietly what?\"Chu Wanning had come out of the mechanism room at some point. His face was cold, and his red phoenix eyes were like snow.He was dressed in white and cold. He stood at the entrance of the library and looked at them expressionlessly. His gaze paused on their hands for a moment, then moved away.\"Shi Mingjing, Mo Weiyu, how dare you.\"Shi Mei's face was as white as snow. He suddenly let go of Mo Ran's hand and whispered, \"Shizun \u2026\"Mo Ran also had a bad feeling. He lowered his head. \"Shizun.\"Chu Wanning walked in. He ignored Mo Ran and looked down at Shi Mei who was kneeling on the ground. He said lightly, \"The Red Lotus Pavilion is covered with barriers. Did you think that I wouldn't know if you entered unannounced?\"Shi Mei kowtowed in fear. \"This disciple knows his mistake.\"Mo Ran was anxious. \"Shizun, Shi Mei only came to change my medicine. He'll leave immediately. Please don't blame him.\"Shi Mei was also anxious. \"Shizun, this has nothing to do with Junior Brother Mo. It's this disciple's fault. This disciple is willing to accept punishment.\"\"\u2026 \u2026\"Chu Wanning's face turned green.He hadn't said more than a few words, but these two were already rushing to exonerate the other. They saw him as a scourge and shared a common enemy.Chu Wanning was silent for a while. He suppressed the twitching of his eyebrows and said lightly, \"You really have deep feelings for your fellow disciples. It's touching. It seems that I'm the only bad person in this room.\"Mo Ran said, \"Shizun \u2026 \u2026\"\"\u2026 \u2026 Don't call me that.\"Chu Wanning flung his sleeves, unwilling to say anything else.Mo Ran didn't know what had happened to him and why he was so angry.He guessed that Chu Wanning had always hated people pulling and pulling in front of him. No matter what kind of pulling and pulling, it would probably dirty his eyes.The three of them were silent for a long time.Chu Wanning suddenly turned around and left.Shi Mei raised his head. His eyes were a bit red. He said blankly, \"Shizun?\"\"Go and copy the sect rules ten times. Go back.\"Shi Mei lowered his eyes. After a while, he said softly, \"\u2026 \u2026 Yes.\"Mo Ran was still kneeling in the same place.Shi Mei stood up. He looked at Mo Ran and hesitated. After a while, he knelt down again and begged Chu Wanning.\"Shizun, Shidi Mo's scar has just healed. If this disciple is so bold, please don't make things too difficult for him.\"Chu Wanning didn't say anything. He stood alone under the flickering candlelight. After a while, he suddenly turned his face. His eyebrows were sharp and his eyes were like torches. He said angrily.\"So much nonsense. Why aren't you leaving?!\"Chu Wanning was handsome but not gentle enough. When he was angry, he was even more frightening. Shi Mei was scared. He was afraid that he would anger his Shizun and implicate Mo Ran. He quickly bowed and left.Only the two of them were left in the library. Mo Ran sighed inwardly. He said, \"Shizun, this disciple was wrong. This disciple will continue to write the records.\"Chu Wanning didn't turn his head. He said, \"If you're tired, you can go back.\"Mo Ran suddenly raised his head.Chu Wanning said coldly, \"I won't keep you.\"How could he be so kind as to let him go?There must be a trick!Mo Ran said wittily, \"I won't go.\"Chu Wanning paused and sneered. \"\u2026 \u2026 Fine, as you wish.\"After saying that, he swung his sleeves and turned to leave.Mo Ran was stunned. There was no trick?He thought that Chu Wanning was going to give him some willow vines.After busying himself until midnight, he finally finished his work.Mo Ran yawned and walked out of the book pavilion.At this time, it was already late at night. Chu Wanning's bedroom was still illuminated by a dim yellow light.Huh?That loathsome devil still hasn't slept?Mo Ran walked over and prepared to say goodbye to Chu Wanning before leaving.When he entered the room, he found that Chu Wanning had already gone to bed. It was just that this person with a bad memory forgot to extinguish the candles before going to bed.Or maybe, he was halfway through his work and directly fell asleep from exhaustion.Mo Ran glanced at the prototype of the God of Night that was pieced together by the bed. He estimated this possibility in his mind. In the end, when he saw that Chu Wanning didn't take off the metal gloves at all, and that half of the mechanical button was still tightly gripped in his hand, he confirmed that this was the truth.When Chu Wanning was asleep, he wasn't so cold and austere. He was curled up on the bed that was piled with mecha parts and saw axes.There were so many things spread out that there wasn't much space for him, so he curled up very small. His body was arched, and his long eyelashes were drooping. He actually looked a bit lonely.Mo Ran stared at him in a daze for a while.Today, Chu Wanning \u2026 \u2026 What was he angry about?Could it be that he was angry at Shi Mei for trespassing on the Red Lotus Waterside Pavilion and wanted to help him organize the books?Mo Ran walked over to the bed and rolled his eyes. He moved closer to Chu Wanning's ear and tried to call out in a very small voice, \"Shizun?\"\"\u2026 \u2026 Oh \u2026 \u2026\" Chu Wanning softly groaned and hugged the cold mecha in his arms.He was in a deep sleep, and his breathing was even. The metal gloves that he didn't take off had sharp teeth. They rested on the side of his face like the claws of a cat or leopard.When Mo Ran saw that he didn't look like he would wake up anytime soon, his heart skipped a beat. He narrowed his eyes and rubbed the corners of his mouth into a mischievous smile.He leaned close to Chu Wanning's ear and probed in a low voice, \"Shizun, wake up.\"\"\u2026 \u2026\"\"Shizun?\"\"\u2026 \u2026\"\"Chu Wanning?\"\"\u2026 \u2026\"\"Hey, you're really in deep sleep.\"Mo Ran was amused. He leaned against the pillow and looked at him with a smile. \"That's great. I'll take this opportunity to settle the score with you.\"Chu Wanning didn't know that someone wanted to settle the score with him. He continued to sleep with his eyes closed. His handsome face was very peaceful.Mo Ran put on a dignified posture. Unfortunately, he was born in a music house and didn't study much. When he was young, he was exposed to street fights and storytelling. Therefore, the words that he pieced together sounded very clumsy and funny.\"How dare you, unruly people of the Chu family. You deceived the Emperor and disrespected the Emperor. You \u2026 \u2026 Hmm, you \u2026 \u2026\"He scratched his head and was a little speechless. After all, when he became the Emperor, the words that came out of his mouth were either a lowly servant or a dog slave. However, these words didn't seem to be suitable for Chu Wanning.After racking his brain for a long time, he suddenly thought of a phrase that the girls in the music house often said. Although he didn't know what it meant, it seemed to be quite good.So Mo Ran frowned and said sternly,\"You heartless lowly donkey, do you know your crime?\"Chu Wanning, \"\u2026 \u2026\"\"If you don't speak, I'll take it that you admit to your crime!\"Chu Wanning probably felt that it was a little noisy. He groaned and hugged the mecha to continue sleeping.\"You have committed such a big crime. According to the law, I will sentence you \u2026 \u2026 Hmm, sentence you to verbal punishment!Eunuch Liu! \"After shouting out of habit, he realized that Eunuch Liu was already a person from his previous life.Mo Ran thought for a while and decided to play the role of a father-in-law.So he said flatteringly, \"Your Majesty, this old servant is here.\"Then he immediately cleared his throat and said solemnly, \"Carry out the sentence immediately.\"\"As Your Majesty commands.\"Okay, the sentence was over.Mo Ran rubbed his hands together and began to \"torture\" Chu Wanning.The so-called verbal punishment actually didn't exist. It was something that Mo Ran made up on the spot.Then how should this verbal punishment that he thought up on the spot be carried out?The tyrant of a generation, Mo Ran, solemnly cleared his throat. His gaze was cold and fierce. He slowly moved closer to Chu Wanning's face, which was as cold as a spring in a snowy valley. Little by little, he moved closer to those pale lips.Then \u2026 \u2026Mo Ran stopped. He glared at Chu Wanning and cursed, word by word.\"Chu Wanning, f * ck your mother. You peerless little. Mind. Eye.\"Slap.Slap.He slapped himself twice in the air.Hehe, the sentence was a success!Awesome!Mo Ran was laughing when he suddenly felt a prickling sensation on his neck. He felt something strange and quickly lowered his head. He met a pair of cold and noble eyes.Mo Ran, \"\u2026 \u2026\"Chu Wanning's voice was like a broken ice lake. It was hard to say whether it was more celestial or colder. \"What are you doing?\"\"I \u2026 \u2026 Bah.This old servant \u2026 \u2026 Bah bah bah! \"Fortunately, these two words were as soft as a mosquito's buzz. Chu Wanning frowned slightly. It seemed that he didn't hear clearly.Mo Ran had an idea. He raised his hand and slapped Chu Wanning's face twice.\"\u2026 \u2026\"Facing his master's increasingly unfriendly expression, the former Venerable Lord of the Human Realm smiled obsequiously and said, \"This disciple, this disciple is killing mosquitoes for the master.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFortunately, Mo Ran's \"verbal torture\" was not completely heard by Chu Wanning.After spouting a bunch of nonsense, he barely managed to get away with it.When he returned to his bedroom, it was already very late. Mo Ran slept for a while and went to his morning cultivation as usual the next day.After his morning cultivation, it was time for his favorite thing in the morning: being too early.Breakfast was at the Meng Po Lobby. As the morning cultivation dispersed, more and more people started to gather.Mo Ran sat across from Shi Mei. Xue Meng arrived late, so the seat next to Shi Mei was taken by someone else. He had no choice but to sit next to Mo Ran with a gloomy face.If Mo Ran were to talk about the most exquisite part of the heart sutra of the Peak of Life and Death, he would definitely say: Our sect does not need to abstain from eating.Unlike many of the sects in the Upper Cultivation World, the Peak of Life and Death had its own set of cultivation methods. They did not abstain from meat and did not need to fast. Therefore, the food in the sect was always sumptuous.Mo Ran drank a bowl of spicy and fragrant oil tea. He ate peanuts, chopped vegetables, and crispy soybeans. In front of him was a plate of yellow and crispy pan-fried dumplings that were specially prepared for Shi Mei.Xue Meng looked at Mo Ran from the corner of his eyes and said mockingly, \"Mo Ran, I didn't expect you to be able to walk out of the Red Lotus Hell alive.Amazing. \"Mo Ran did not even raise his head. \"Then why don't you see who I am?\"\"Who are you?\"Xue Meng sneered. \"Shizun didn't break your leg, and you're so arrogant that you don't know who you are?\"\"Oh, if I'm an onion, then what are you?\"Xue Meng sneered. \"I'm Shizun's chief disciple.\"\"You gave yourself that title?Sigh, I suggest you ask Shizun to give you a seal and hang it on the wall. Otherwise, you're not worthy of the title of chief disciple. \"With a crack, Xue Meng broke the chopsticks in his hand.Shi Mei hurriedly tried to calm them down. \"Stop arguing. Let's eat.\"Xue Meng: \"\u2026 Hmph.\"Mo Ran giggled and imitated him. \"Hmph.\"Xue Meng flew into a rage and slammed the table. \"How dare you!\"Seeing that the situation was not good, Shi Mei hurriedly pulled Xue Meng back. \"Young Master, there are so many people watching. Let's eat, stop fighting.\"The two of them were at odds with each other. Although they were cousins, they quarreled whenever they saw each other. After Shi Mei persuaded Xue Meng, he had no choice but to sit in the middle and talk to both sides.After a while, he asked Xue Meng, \"Young Master, when will Madam's cat give birth?\"Xue Meng replied, \"Oh, you mean Ah Li?My mother made a mistake. It's not pregnant. It just ate too much and looks like it has a big belly. \"Shi Mei: \"\u2026\"After a while, he asked Mo Ran, \"Mo Ran, are you still going to work at Shizun's place today?\"\"I don't think so. Everything that needs to be done has been done.I'll help you copy the sect rules today. \"Shi Mei laughed. \"Why do you still have time to help me?You still have a hundred times to copy. \"Xue Meng raised his eyebrows and looked at Shi Mei in surprise. \"Why do you want to copy the sect rules too?\"Shi Mei looked embarrassed. Before he could say anything, the chatter in the dining hall suddenly died down.The three of them turned around and saw Chu Wanning enter the Meng Po Lobby in his white robe. He walked to the counter expressionlessly and began to pick out the snacks.With the addition of Chu Wanning, the dining hall with more than a thousand people suddenly became as quiet as a graveyard.The disciples all buried their heads in their food. Even if they wanted to talk, they spoke very softly.Shi Mi sighed softly. He watched as Chu Wan-ning carried the tray and sat in the corner where he usually sat. She silently ate the porridge by herself. He couldn't help but say, \"Actually, I feel that sometimes Shizun is quite pitiful.\"Mo Ran looked up. \"What do you mean?\"\"Look, no one dares to go near where he sits. When he comes, no one dares to speak loudly. It was fine when the Lord was around, but now that the Lord isn't around, he doesn't even have someone to talk to. Isn't he very lonely?\"Mo Ran snorted. \"He asked for it.\"Xue Meng was angry again. \"You dare to mock Shizun?\"\"When did I mock him?I'm just telling the truth. \"Mo Ran gave Shi Mei another pan-fried bun. \"With his temper, who would want to stay with him?\"\"You \u2014 \u2014!\"Mo Ran looked at Xue Meng with a mischievous smile and said lazily, \"Not convinced?If you're not convinced, then sit over there and eat with Shizun. Don't sit with us. \"That one sentence made Xue Meng speechless.Although he respected Chu Wanning, he was more afraid of him like everyone else.He couldn't help but feel embarrassed and angry, but he couldn't refute. He could only kick the table legs and sulk with himself.Mo Ran's face had a trace of lazy pride. He glanced at the little phoenix provocatively, and then his line of sight fell on Chu Wanning across the crowd.For some reason, looking at the only white figure in the dark blue silver armor in the room, he suddenly thought of the person curled up in the cold metal and fell asleep last night.Shi Mei was right. Chu Wanning was really pitiful.But so what?The more pitiful he was, the happier Mo Ran was. As he thought about it, the corners of his mouth couldn't help but curl up a little more.The days passed by quickly.Chu Wanning didn't ask him to go to the Red Lotus Pavilion anymore. Mo Ran's daily tasks were washing dishes, feeding the chickens and ducks raised by Madam Wang, and weeding in the herb garden. He had a lot of free time.In the blink of an eye, a month of confinement had passed.One day, Madam Wang called Mo Ran to the Dan Xin Palace. She touched his head and asked, \"Mo Ran, have your wounds healed?\"Mo Ran smiled and said, \"Thank you for your concern. They're all healed.\"\"That's good. Be careful when you go out in the future. Don't make such a big mistake and make your Shizun angry. Do you understand?\"Mo Ran was very good at pretending to be a grandson. \"I understand, Auntie.\"\"There's one more thing.\"Madam Wang took out a letter from the small table and said, \"You've been in the sect for a year. It's time for you to take on the responsibility of eliminating demons.Yesterday, your uncle sent you a letter and asked you to go down the mountain to complete this task after your confinement is over. \"According to the rules of the Life and Death Summit, disciples who had been in the sect for a year had to go out and eliminate demons.During the first time, the disciple's Shizun would accompany him. In addition, the disciple had to invite a fellow disciple to go with him. This was to let the disciples support each other and understand why the saying, \"Loyal heart can be a mirror, and will not change in life and death.\"Mo Ran's eyes lit up. He took the letter and tore it open. After reading it, he grinned happily.Madam Wang said worriedly, \"Ah Ran, your uncle hopes that you can make a name for yourself in one battle, so he entrusted you with a heavy responsibility. Even though Elder Yu Heng's cultivation is profound, but in a battle, blades and swords are merciless. He might not be able to protect you well. You must not be too happy and underestimate the enemy.\"\"I won't, I won't!\" Mo Ran waved his hands and laughed, \"Auntie, don't worry. I'll take care of myself.\" After saying this, he slipped away to pack his luggage.\"This child \u2026\" Madam Wang looked at his back. Her gentle and beautiful face was full of worry, \"Why is he so happy to accept a task?\"How could Mo Ran not be happy?The task his uncle gave him to eliminate demons happened in Colorful Butterfly Town. It was entrusted by a local official surnamed Chen.Regardless of what kind of demons were there, the key was that in his previous life, he was bewitched by demons in this Colorful Butterfly Town. He lost his mind and forcibly kissed Shi Mei in an illusion. This was one of the few times that Mo Ran was close to Shi Mei. It was really ecstasy.Moreover, because he was bewitched, Shi Mei couldn't be bothered.He kissed her for nothing!After he kissed her, she couldn't even find him to settle the score.Mo Ran was so happy that his eyes turned into crescents.He didn't even mind that this task had to be done with Chu Wanning.Eliminating demons depended on one's master, and flirting depended on one's self. This kind of easy task, why not?After inviting Shi Mo and reporting to Shizun, the three of them quickly rode their horses and arrived at the Colorful Butterfly Town, which was full of evil spirits.This was a town that was rich in flowers. Outside the residential area were flower fields that stretched for dozens of miles. Because of this, there were always butterflies fluttering about in the town, hence the name.When the three of them arrived, it was already night time. The village entrance was bustling with noise and excitement. A line of musicians wearing bright red clothes walked out of the alley while playing suona.Shi Mei asked curiously, \"Is this a wedding?Why are they marrying at night? \"Chu Wanning said, \"It's a ghost wedding.\"Ghost weddings were also known as yin weddings or matching bones. It was a marriage arranged by the common people for men and women who died young before marriage.This kind of custom didn't flourish in poor places, but the Colorful Butterfly Town was very rich. Therefore, it was common for the unmarried young men and women to find a spouse.The group of ghost weddings was majestic. They were divided into two rows. One row was carrying silk and satin, the other row was carrying paper ingots and ghost coins.Like this, they escorted a red and white palanquin with eight carriers. All of them were deacons with golden lanterns as they filed out of the village.Mo Ran pulled the horses to the side and let the group of ghost weddings pass first.As the palanquin came closer, they saw that the person sitting inside was not a living person, but a ghost bride made of paper.The ghost bride was covered in makeup. Her lips were bright red, and the two rosy clouds on her cheeks reflected her pale face. Her smiling appearance was extremely frightening.\"What kind of bad habits does this village have? They really have money to burn.\" Mo Ran whispered.Chu Wanning said, \"The people of Colorful Butterfly Town are very particular about the art of geomancy. They believe that a lone grave cannot appear in a family, otherwise, the family's luck will be affected by the wandering ghosts.\"\"\u2026 There's no such saying, right?\"\"The townspeople believe in it.\"\"Ai, that's true. Colorful Butterfly Town has been around for hundreds of years. If we tell them that the evil they believe in does not exist, they probably won't be able to accept it.\"Shi Mei whispered, \"Where is this group of ghost weddings going?\"Chu Wanning said, \"When we came here, we passed by an earthen temple. The temple doesn't worship any deity. There was a 'double happiness' character pasted on the door. The table was filled with red satin. On the satin, there were words like 'heaven-sent good fortune' and 'a good match in the underworld'.I think they are going there. \"\"I noticed that temple too.\" Shi Mai seemed to be deep in thought. \"Master, is that a ghost emcee enshrined there?\"\"That's right.\"A ghost master of ceremonies is an image of a ghost god. People believe that a ghost wedding needs three matchmakers and six cards. When exchanging dragon phoenix invitations, the master of ceremonies is also needed to recognize two dead people as husband and wife.Because of the popularity of the ghost wedding in Colorful Butterfly Town, naturally, a golden body was sculpted for the ghost master and placed in front of the graveyard outside the town. Before the people who carried out the ghost wedding were buried, they had to first carry the ghost bride to the temple to pay their respects.Mo Ran rarely saw such a ridiculous scene, so he watched with great interest. Chu Wanning only watched for a while before turning his horse around and said, \"Let's go. We'll go take a look at the haunted house.\"\"Three Daoists, my life is really bitter!You're finally here!If no one cares about this matter, I, I don't even want to live anymore! \"The person who entrusted the Peak of Life and Death to eliminate the ghost was the town's richest merchant, Chen Yuanwai.The Chen Family was in the fragrance powder business. There were four sons and one daughter in the family.After the eldest son got married, the wife didn't like the noise in the house, so the two of them thought about moving out and starting their own family. The Chen Family was rich and overbearing, so they bought a large piece of land in a secluded area of the North Mountain. There was also a natural hot spring pool, so they were very good at enjoying themselves.As a result, on the day of the groundbreaking, the shovel hit a hard object after a few shovels.The eldest daughter-in-law went over to take a look and fainted. They dug up a new coffin painted red on the North Mountain!There was a mass burial ground in Colorful Butterfly Town. After the townspeople died, they were all buried there.But this lone coffin inexplicably appeared on the North Mountain. Moreover, there was no tombstone, and the coffin was blood-red.They didn't dare to move it again, so they quickly filled the hole with soil. But it was already too late. Since that day, strange things kept happening in the Chen Family.\"First, it was my daughter-in-law.\" Chen Yuanwai cried, \"She was frightened, which affected the baby and caused a miscarriage.Then, it was my eldest son who went to the mountain to pick herbs for his wife to nourish her body. In the end, he slipped and fell down the mountain. When we went to save her, he was already dead \u2026 Sigh! \"He sighed deeply, choked with sobs, and couldn't continue. He just waved his hand.Madam Chen was also wiping her tears with a handkerchief. \"My husband was right. In the following months, our sons met with mishaps one after another. They either went missing or lost their lives. Four sons, three of them are gone!\"Chu Wanning frowned, glanced at the Chen couple, and fell on the pale-faced eldest son. He looked about the same age as Mo Ran, about 15 or 16 years old. He had delicate features, but fear made his face somewhat distorted.Shi Mei asked, \"Can you tell us how the other children \u2026 died?\"\"Sigh, Zhong Zi was bitten by a snake when he was on his way to find his brother.That snake was just a normal grass snake. It wasn't poisonous. At that time, no one paid much attention to it. But a few days later, when he was eating, he suddenly fell straight down, and then \u2026 Wuwuwu, my child \u2026 \"Shi Mei sighed, and felt bad, \"Then, did the body show any signs of poisoning?\"\"Sigh, where did the poison come from? Our family must have been cursed!The first few sons have all died, and the next one is the youngest!The next one is the youngest! \"Chu Wanning frowned, and his eyes fell on Mrs. Chen like lightning, and asked, \"How do you know that the youngest will be the next one? Why not yourself?Does this evil ghost only kill men? \"The youngest son of the Chen family huddled there, his legs shaking and eyes swollen. When he opened his mouth, his voice was sharp and twisted, \"It's me!It's me!I know it!The man in the red coffin is here!He's here!Taoist priest, Taoist priest, save me!Taoist priest, save me! \"As he spoke, he began to lose control of his emotions. He rushed over and hugged Chu Wanning's leg.Chu Wanning didn't like to interact with strangers, so he immediately avoided him. He raised his head and stared at the couple, \"What's going on?\"The couple looked at each other and said in a trembling voice, \"There's a place in this house, we, we don't dare to go there again. Taoist priest, you'll know when you see it. It's really evil, really \u2026\"Chu Wanning interrupted, \"Where is it?\"The couple hesitated for a while, and then reached out their hands and pointed to the ancestral room, \"It's there \u2026\"Chu Wanning took the lead, followed by Mo Ran and Shi Mei, and the Chens at a distance.When they opened the door, they saw that the room was very similar to the incense house where some big families worshiped their ancestors. There were several rows of memorial tablets, and pale candles were burning on both sides.All the memorial tablets in this room were engraved with yellow paint. The names of the deceased and their ranking in the family were written on them.The memorial tablets were written in a very orderly manner. The spirit of a certain Lord Taifu would be tested on the spirit of a certain Lord Taifu, and the spirit of a certain Lord Taifu would be tested on the spirit of a certain Lord Taifu.Only the memorial tablet in the middle didn't have the words engraved on it. Instead, it had a line of words written in bright red:The spirit of Chen Yanji.Erected by Lord Yang Chen SunThe members of the Chen family who were hiding behind the Taoist priest felt lucky and timidly glanced at the white silk fluttering in the air. However, when they saw the words on the memorial tablet that looked like they were painted with blood, they immediately collapsed.Mrs. Chen cried loudly. Her youngest son's face was so pale that he didn't look like a living person.First, the writing on the memorial tablet was not in accordance with the etiquette. Second, the words on the memorial tablet were crooked, like the scribbles of a sleepy person. It was so messy that it was almost unrecognizable.Shi Mei turned around and asked, \"Who's Chen Yanji?\"The youngest son of the Chens cried behind him and said with a trembling voice, \"It's, it's me.\"Chen Yuanwai cried and said, \"Taoist priest, it's like this. Since Master Zhong passed away, we found that \u2026 we found that there was a memorial tablet in the ancestral hall. The names of all the living people in our family were written on the tablet.As soon as the name appeared, within seven days, that person would meet with an unexpected disaster!When the third son's name appeared on the tablet, I locked him in the room and scattered incense outside the door. I asked someone to perform a ritual. I tried everything, but on the seventh day!He still died \u2026 for no reason, just like that! \"The more he spoke, the more agitated and scared he became. He knelt down with a thud and said, \"I, Chen Yuanwai, have never done anything evil in my life. Why did God do this to me?Why? \"Shi Mei felt sad and hurried to comfort the crying old man. At the same time, he raised his head and said softly, \"Master, look at this \u2026\"Chu Wanning didn't turn around. He was still looking at the memorial tablet with great interest, as if a flower would bloom on it.Suddenly, Chu Wanning asked, \"Master Yang, Madam Chensun, are they talking about you, Madam Chen?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"It's, it's me!\" Madam Chen cried, \"But this tablet wasn't written by me!How could I curse my own child?I \u2014 \u2014 \"\"You won't write when you're awake, but not when you're asleep.\"As Chu Wanning spoke, he raised his hand and picked up the tablet. He poured spiritual energy into his palm, and the tablet suddenly burst out with a mournful scream, followed by thick blood flowing out from the tablet.Chu Wanning's eyes were cold, and he sternly said, \"Evil creature, how dare you be so arrogant!\"The spiritual energy in his palm increased, and the words on the tablet were forced to recede bit by bit from the scream, becoming dim, and finally completely disappeared.Chu Wan Ning's slender and cold fingers clenched once more, shattering the entire tablet into pieces!The Chen Family members behind were all stunned.Not to mention the Chen Family members, even Shi Mei was stunned.He couldn't help but sigh, \"So powerful.\"Mo Ran couldn't help but sigh in his heart, so fierce.Chu Wanning turned half of his handsome face, but there was no expression on his face, only a few drops of blood splashed on his cheeks.He raised his hand, carefully examining the blood on his fingertips, and said to the Chen Family members, \"You all stay in this courtyard today, don't go anywhere.\"At this time, they didn't dare to disobey, so they quickly said, \"Good!Good!We'll listen to Daoist Priest's orders! \"Chu Wanning walked out of the ancestral room in large strides, casually wiping the blood on his face, and pointed at Madam Chen, \"Especially you, you can't fall asleep.That thing will take over your body, so no matter how sleepy you are, you must be awake. \"\"Yes \u2026 \u2026 yes, yes, yes!\"Madam Chen repeatedly agreed, and with tears in her eyes, she asked in disbelief, \"Daoist Priest, my son \u2026 \u2026 is he \u2026 \u2026 is he alright?\"\"He's fine for now.\"Madam Chen was stunned, \"For now?Not all the time?Then, then how can I save my son's life? \"Chu Wanning said, \"Catch the monster.\"Madam Chen was very anxious, so she couldn't help but be a little rude. She hurriedly asked, \"When does Daoist Priest plan to catch it?\"\"Immediately.\"As Chu Wanning spoke, he glanced at the Chen Clan members and asked, \"Do any of you know the exact location of the red coffin?Someone, lead the way. \"The eldest son's daughter-in-law's surname was Yao. Although she was a woman, she was tall and looked quite heroic. Although there was fear on her face, she was calmer than the others.She immediately said, \"My late husband and I chose that place. I know where it is. Let me take you there.\"The three of them followed Chen Yaoshi and headed north. Soon, they arrived at the piece of land that the Chen family had bought.Martial law had been set up there, and there was no sign of human habitation around. The dark hills were overgrown with vegetation, and it was so quiet that not even the chirping of insects and birds could be heard.When they reached the middle of the mountain, their field of vision widened. Chen Yaoshi said, \"Three Taoists, this is the place.\"The place where the red coffin was dug out was still covered with the tombstone. Mo Ran laughed when he saw it. \"What's the use of this stupid stone?One look and I can tell that this is something that only an amateur would do. Let's move. \"Chen Yaoshi was a little flustered. \"The mister in town said that because of the tombstone, the evil spirits inside can't come out.\"Mo Ran put on a fake smile. \"Mister, you're quite capable.\"\"\u2026\" Chen Yaoshi said, \"Move, move, move, move!\"Chu Wanning coldly said, \"There's no need for that.\"As he finished speaking, he raised his hand. His fingertips glowed with golden light. Heaven's Inquisition obeyed his summons and appeared in his palm. He then swung his willow vines and the tombstone shattered into pieces.Chu Wanning expressionlessly walked over and stood on top of the pile of rubble. He raised his hand again and said, \"What are you hiding for?Get up! \"A strange creaking sound came from below. Suddenly, a twelve foot thick wooden coffin broke through the ground. In a moment, sand and dirt flew everywhere.Shi Mei was shocked. \"This coffin is filled with evil spirits!\"Chu Wanning said, \"Back off.\"As he finished speaking, he swung his hand and the Heaven's Inquisition struck the red coffin. Golden sparks flew everywhere. After a moment of silence, the lid of the coffin burst open. The billowing smoke dispersed and the thing inside was revealed.Lying in the coffin was a naked man. His nose was straight and his face was handsome. If it wasn't for his pale skin, he would have looked like he was sleeping.Mo Ran glanced at the man's lower abdomen and covered his eyes. \"Aiya, you're not wearing underwear. Stinky hooligan.\"Shi Mei was speechless.Chu Wanning was speechless.Chen Yaoshi exclaimed, \"Husband!\" She rushed over to the coffin.Chu Wanning reached out and stopped her. He raised his eyebrows and asked, \"This is your husband?\"\"Yes!He's my husband! \"Chen Yaoshi was shocked and sad.\" Why is he here?He was buried in the ancestral grave. At that time, he was wearing his burial clothes. Why is he \u2026 \"Halfway through her sentence, the woman burst into tears. She beat her chest and stamped her feet. \"Why is it like this!It's so tragic \u2014 so tragic!Hubby \u2026 Hubby!! \"The junior sister sighed. \"Little Mrs. Chen, my condolences.\"Chu Wanning and Mo Ran ignored the crying woman. Chu Wanning wasn't good at comforting people, while Mo Ran didn't have any compassion. The two of them stared at the body in the coffin.Mo Ran had already experienced this in his previous life and wasn't surprised. However, he still had to pretend. He rubbed his chin and said, \"Shizun, there's something wrong with this body.\"Chu Wanning said, \"I know.\"\"\u2026\"Mo Ran had a lot of things to say. They were all words that Chu Wanning had analyzed for them in his previous life. In this life, he wanted to use them to shock Chu Wanning. However, Chu Wanning just casually said, \"I know.\"As a master, shouldn't he be tempting his disciple and encouraging him to voice his thoughts and praise him and reward him for his actions??Mo Ran wasn't satisfied. He pretended not to hear the \"I don't know\" and said, \"There are no signs of decay on this body. Young Master Chen's accident happened more than half a month ago. According to the current climate, it should have festered and oozed pus. There should be a layer of liquid in the coffin. This is the first reason.\"Chu Wanning looked at him coldly with a look that said, \"You can continue acting.\" \"\u2026\"\"The second reason.\"Mo Ran was unmoved. He continued to recite Chu Wanning's explanation from his previous life. \"Before the coffin was opened, the evil aura in this red coffin was very strong. However, after it was opened, it dissipated.Moreover, the evil aura in this body is very weak. This is also very abnormal. \"Chu Wanning: \"\u2026\"\"The third reason. Did you notice that from the moment the coffin was opened, there was a sweet fragrance in the wind?\"The fragrance was very faint. If one didn't pay attention, they wouldn't have noticed it at all.After Mo Ran said this, Shi Mei and Chen Yaoshi finally noticed that there was indeed a faint sweetness in the air.Shi Mei said, \"Indeed.\"Chen Yaoshi sniffed and her expression changed. \"This fragrance \u2026\"Shi Mei said, \"Mrs. Chen, what's wrong?\"Chen Yaoshi was so scared that her voice changed. \"This fragrance, it's my mother-in-law's Hundred Butterfly Fragrance Powder!\"For a moment, no one said anything. The prophecy tablet in the shrine, \"Made by Master Yang Chen Yaoshi\", seemed to appear in front of them again.Shi Mei said, \"\u2026 Could this really be Mrs. Chen's doing?\"Mo Ran said, \"It doesn't look like it.\"Chu Wanning said, \"No.\"The two spoke at almost the same time. After they finished speaking, they looked at each other.Chu Wanning's expression didn't change at all. \"Go ahead.\"Mo Ran said bluntly, \"From what I know, the Chen family became rich because of the Hundred Butterfly Fragrance Powder specially made by the Old Madame. Although the formula of this powder is not leaked, the finished product is not difficult to obtain.Five or six of the ten girls in Rainbow Butterfly Town use this fragrance on their bodies.Not only that, before we came here, we found that Young Master Chen seems to like the Hundred Butterfly Fragrance Powder very much. He often mixed it in his baths, so it's not strange that he has this fragrance on him. What's strange is \u2026 \"As he spoke, he turned his head again to look at the naked man in the coffin.\"He's already been dead for half a month, but this fragrance is still the same as if it was just applied.Am I right, Shizun? \"Chu Wanning: \"\u2026\"\"If you're right, then praise me.\"Chu Wanning: \"En.\"Mo Ran laughed. \"You really are a man of few words.\"Before he could laugh, his robes suddenly fluttered as Chu Wanning pulled him back several feet. The golden light of Heaven's Inquisition in her hand sparkled brightly as sparks flew everywhere.\"Be careful.\"The smell of the Hundred Butterfly Perfume in the air suddenly thickened. As the fragrance drifted, white fog appeared between the plants and started to spread at an astonishing speed. In an instant, the entire mountainside turned into a sea of fog. Suddenly, it was so dark that one couldn't even see their own fingers!Mo Ran's heart skipped a beat.The illusion had been activated.\"Ah!!\" In the thick fog, the first thing that came was Chen Yaoshi's scream. \"Daoist Priest, save \u2014\"Before the last word left her mouth, she suddenly went silent.Chu Wanning's fingertips lit up with a blue light. He placed a tracking talisman on Mo Ran's forehead and said, \"Be careful. I'll go take a look.\"After that, he quickly disappeared into the thick fog.Mo Ran touched his forehead and laughed softly. \"Wow, even the location of the talisman is exactly the same as in my previous life. Chu Wanning, you really haven't changed a single bit.\"The fog dispersed as quickly as it came. Not long after, the fog disappeared without a trace. However, the scene in front of them was even more shocking than the fog.At least in his previous life, Mo Ran had a great shock.After the fog dispersed, the originally desolate, messy, and overgrown mountainside was gone.In its place was a vast and elegant garden. There were pavilions, winding corridors, rockeries, and cobblestone paths. There was no end in sight.When Mo Ran saw this place, he was so happy that he wanted to roll on the ground.This tyrant had always been thinking about this illusion. In his previous life, they were also lost in it. Mo Ran first met Shi Mei. Under the influence of the illusion, he kissed Shi Mei for the first and only time in his life.Unfortunately, at that time, Shi Mei was probably too scared. When Mo Ran let go of his hand, he turned around and ran away.The swan that was in his mouth was taken away from him before he could even take a bite. This was not a good feeling.After the illusion was broken, Shi Mei did not pursue the matter. The kiss in the illusion was like nothing had happened. No one mentioned it again.Sometimes, in his dreams, Mo Ran would wonder if it was just a figment of his imagination due to his deep obsession.But whether or not it was his imagination, Mo Ran licked his lips. This time, he would not let Shi Mei get away so easily!He had to kiss him enough!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter walking for a long time in the illusion, he still could not find his way.Instead, the smell of the Hundred Butterfly Perfume in the air was getting stronger and stronger. This smell would stimulate one's emotions and expand one's senses, causing one to do many unimaginable things.Mo Ran gradually began to feel restless, as if a small flame had ignited in his stomach, slowly heating up the blood in his body.Spring water, he needed to find a pool of spring water. Where was the spring water?He knew that there was a living spring in the illusion. In his previous life, when he walked to the spring, his mouth was dry and his eyes were blurred. He had no choice but to drink a few mouthfuls of the spring water, thinking that it was better to die from poison than from thirst.After drinking the spring water, he felt his consciousness become more and more blurred. In a daze, Shi Mei came to find him. Shi Mei was a medical practitioner, so he immediately detoxified him. At that time, the dizzy Mo Ran was bewitched by the poison and kissed Shi Mei's lips.The former Emperor of the Mortal Realm was eager to relive the dream of his lover, so he wandered around the Illusionary Land. After a long time, he finally heard the tinkling sound of spring water. He was so happy that he quickly ran over and drank to his heart's content.Sure enough, the restlessness brought by the fragrance became more obvious under the stimulation of the spring water. He uncontrollably wanted to plunge into the depths of the spring water, and unknowingly buried half of his body.Just as Mo Ran's consciousness was about to become blurred, a hand suddenly pulled him up, just like in his previous life. In an instant, water splashed everywhere, and air rushed into his nose. Mo Ran gasped for breath, opened his eyelashes and saw the figure in front of him.The blurry figure gradually became clearer, accompanied by an angry voice.\"How dare you drink the water here? Do you want to die?\"Mo Ran shook off the water droplets like a dog. When he saw the person, he was relieved, \"Shi Mei \u2026\"\"Don't talk, take the medicine!\"A dark purple pill was passed to his lips. Mo Ran opened his mouth and obediently took the pill, but his eyes were still staring at Shi Mei's beautiful face.Suddenly, just like in his previous life, he could not resist the anxiety in his heart. Besides, Mo Ran was not a gentleman, so he clasped Shi Mei's wrist and quickly kissed him on the lips before he could react.In an instant, sparks flew everywhere, and his mind was blank.He was a dissolute and promiscuous person, but the intensity in bed did not require the contact of the lips, and did not require excessive warmth. Thus, although there was a lot of physical contact, the number of kisses he had with others was pitifully few.Shi Mo did not expect to be attacked like this. He froze on the spot. Only when the tongue reached in did he finally react and begin to struggle and resist.\"What are you doing \u2026 oh!\"Before he could finish his sentence, his face was violently turned around and his lips covered again. Mo Ran's kiss was even more intense than in his previous life. The two rolled around by the spring. Shi Mei was firmly pressed under Mo Ran's body, and Mo Ran kissed his moist and cold lips. It was the same amazing feeling as in his memory, and his cheeks, ears \u2026\"Don't move \u2026\" When he opened his mouth, his hoarse voice shocked himself.It was over.Why did the spring water feel even more effective than in his previous life?According to the development of his previous life, he did not have the time to be intimate with Shi Mei for so long. After a few kisses, the young Mo Ran was condemned by his conscience. He let go of Shi Mei and used Qinggong to escape.But because he was too evil and shameless in this life, not only was he not condemned by his conscience, he was driven by lust. He directly pressed Shi Mei to the shore and kissed him.Shi Mi struggled and shouted angrily under his body, but his evil thoughts had entered his heart and he could not hear what he was shouting. In his eyes, he could only see that peerlessly beautiful face and that seductive, moist, opening and closing lips.A fire burned in his stomach. Mo Ran followed his heart and kissed him even more violently. He directly pried open Shi Mei's teeth, and his tongue went straight in, grabbing the sweetness in his mouth.His heart was beating like a drum.In the midst of the chaos, he had already torn off Shi Mei's complicated outer robe and pulled open the waist belt. His hand slipped inside and touched the smooth and firm skin. The person under him suddenly jumped up, but was heavily pressed down by Mo Ran.He bit Shi Mei's ear and whispered, \"Be good, and we can both feel good.\"\"Mo Weiyu \u2013!!\"\"Aiya, aiya, why are you so angry that you're calling me like that?It makes us seem like strangers, \"Mo Ran smiled and licked Shi Mei's earlobe. His hand didn't stay idle and went straight to Shi Mei's waist.Stinking rogue Mo Ran, the sixteen year old rogue from back then really couldn't compare to the thirty-two year old rogue now!This person's face was growing thicker with each passing day!Shi Mei's body tensed up. Mo Ran could feel his body trembling slightly. Really, he clearly looked like a slender person, but his muscles were well-proportioned and his lines sharp.He couldn't help but pull at Shi Mei's underwear.Shi Mei finally couldn't bear it anymore and exploded.\"Mo Weiyu!You're courting death!! \"With a bang, a burst of powerful spiritual energy fiercely repelled him!That spiritual energy was fierce and overbearing. Mo Ran was caught off guard and was knocked over onto a rock by the spring. He almost spat out a mouthful of blood.Shi Mei grabbed his messy clothes and stood up in a flustered and exasperated manner. Golden spiritual energy flowed wildly in his palms, and sparks flew everywhere. It reflected a red light in his eyes.Mo Ran felt dizzy and vaguely felt that something was wrong.\"Heaven's Inquisition, summon!\"With an angry shout, a golden willow vine shot out from Shi Mei's palm. Heaven's Inquisition came out. The willow vine was dazzling to the eyes. From time to time, it would burst into flames and burst into golden light. Willow leaves fluttered in the air.Mo Ran was stunned.When did Shi Mei know how to summon Heaven's Inquisition?But this thought didn't linger in his mind for a moment. Suddenly, Heaven's Inquisition tore through the air and slapped down on his face!The willow vine didn't hold back at all. The stinky Emperor Ta was beaten until blood splattered everywhere. People like Rong Jiu who had been beaten by Mo Ran would definitely clap and cheer when they saw this. They would shout, \"Good hit!What a good fight!Another hit!Get rid of evil for the people!Do a good deed every day! \"Mo Ran finally regained his senses after being struck by this torrential rain without any gap in between.Shi Mei was so gentle, how could he hit people like this?Who else could it be other than Chu Wan-ning to be so skilled at using the willow vine?!Chu Wanning's hands were weak. He stopped to take a breath and rubbed his wrist. When he was about to hit again, Mo Ran suddenly leaned against the rock and coughed out a mouthful of blood.\"\u2026 Don't hit me anymore, I'm going to die \u2026\"Mo Ran coughed out a few mouthfuls of blood. He couldn't help but feel sad.This was definitely the thickest and most colorful stroke in his dissolute book.Who would have thought that the person who came was actually Chu Wanning?And for some reason, this Chu Wanning had Shi Mei's face. Even his voice sounded exactly the same as Shi Mei's!He wiped the mottled blood from the corner of his mouth. He gasped and looked up.Maybe it was because he was beaten up by the magical weapon, or maybe it was because the medicine that Chu Wanning gave him had taken effect. When he looked up, the person in front of him was no longer Shi Mei.Chu Wanning's face was gloomy. He stood under the tree with a fierce look. He was furious and his eyes were like lightning. He was angrily staring at Mo Ran.His ferocious appearance was truly frightening.But \u2026Mo Ran stared at him for a few seconds.He found that he \u2026 was shamefully hard.Chu Wanning had always been meticulous. His white robe, which could be called ascetic, was now very messy. Only his slender white hands tightly grasped it to prevent it from slipping off his shoulders.His lips were red and swollen from being kissed. There were also scattered kiss marks on the side of his neck.Although his expression was fierce, it made people's hearts beat faster.In his previous life, the memories of Chu Wanning, the memories of madness, bloodshed, hatred, unscrupulousness, conquest, and pleasure were all piled up together.Those memories that Mo Ran was too lazy to think about, and originally didn't want to think about, were all in this air filled with the smell of blood and the scent of a hundred butterflies. In an instant, they became ghastly and difficult to hide.Like a tide, they rushed to his heart.Damn it, he still couldn't look at Chu Wanning like this.Even if he hated him, even if he couldn't wait to cut him into pieces and wrap him in wonton wrappers to cook and eat, Mo Ran still had to admit.In his previous life, the most exciting love affairs, the most blood-boiling and scalp-numbing orgasms, were all obtained from Chu Wanning.Hating him was one thing.But for men, especially a particularly shameless and beastly man like Mo Ran, the instinctive reaction of the body was another thing.Chu Wanning breathed a sigh of relief. It seemed that he was really angry. His hand that was holding Tianwen was trembling slightly.\"Awake?\"Mo Ran swallowed a mouthful of blood. \"\u2026 Yes, Shizun.\"Chu Wanning didn't seem to have enough, but he knew that there was something wrong with this illusion. He shouldn't blame Mo Ran. After hesitating for a while, he finally took back the willow vine.\"Today's matter \u2026\"Before he could finish, Mo Ran interrupted him. \"Today's matter, only the heavens, earth, you and I know. I definitely won't say anything!If I say anything, I'll be struck by lightning! \"Chu Wanning was silent for a while. Then he sneered. \"I've heard this curse of yours more than a hundred times. Not one of them is true.\"\"This time it's definitely true!\"Although his body had a reaction, wanting to do Chu Wanning was like liking to eat stinky tofu. In Mo Ran's eyes, it wasn't something that could be shown in public.It was better to find a corner where there was no one around and eat stinky tofu, so as not to smell others.Wanting to sleep with Chu Wanning was the same.Mo Ran had always hated Chu Wanning. How could he tell others that he actually hated him and secretly wanted to sleep with him?If this wasn't crazy, then what was?And those rotten things with Chu Wanning in his previous life, he really didn't want to mention it again. Forgive him.\"This illusionary realm is very confusing. The people you meet inside will become what you want to see the most.\"Chu Wanning said as he walked side by side with Mo Ran.\"You need to focus to not be confused by the illusion.\"\"Oh \u2026\"En?Wait a minute!Mo Ran suddenly thought of something.If it was like this, then in his previous life, the Shi Mei he saw might not be Shi Mei?It might still be \u2014 \u2014He glanced at Chu Wanning who was walking next to him and couldn't help but feel a chill.Impossible!If the person he kissed in his previous life was Chu Wanning, he definitely couldn't avoid a beating!At the very least, he would eat a slap!It definitely wasn't Chu Wanning!It definitely wasn't him!Just as he was shouting in his heart, Chu Wanning suddenly stopped and pulled Mo Ran behind him, \"Quiet.\"\"What's wrong?\"\"There's movement in front.\"The current situation was completely different from his previous life, so Mo Ran didn't know what would happen next. When he heard Chu Wanning say this, he immediately asked, \"Could it be Shi Mei?\"Chu Wanning frowned, \"In this illusion, you can't imagine who you will see in advance. If you can't help it, you will see what that person looks like.Eliminate all distracting thoughts. \"\"\u2026 \u2026\" Mo Ran tried for a while, but found that he couldn't do it.Chu Wanning glanced at him. He didn't know when, but a dagger formed from spiritual energy appeared in his hand and stabbed towards Mo Ran's arm.\"Ah \u2014 \u2014!\"\"Don't shout.\"Chu Wanning had already expected this. His other hand directly touched Mo Ran's lips, and a golden light appeared on his fingertips. Mo Ran suddenly couldn't make any sound, \"Does it hurt?\"\"\u2026 \u2026\" Nonsense!Just stab yourself and see if it hurts!Mo Ran held back his tears and nodded pitifully.\"It's good that it hurts. Other than this pain, don't think about anything else. Follow me, we'll go and take a look.\"Mo Ran cursed Chu Wanning the whole way, quietly following him along the winding path. Who knew that the closer they got to the place, the more they could hear countless people laughing and joking. In this empty place, it was especially strange.After going around a long stretch of high walls, the two finally arrived at the place where the sound was coming from.It was a building draped in red and green. The lights were brilliant, and the red gauze swayed in the wind. The large courtyard was bustling with activity. There were actually more than a hundred tables set up for a banquet. There were all kinds of fish and vegetables on the tables. The guests were drinking and chatting merrily.In the wide open hall, a large bright red \"Xi\" character was particularly eye-catching. It seemed that there was actually an extraordinarily lively wedding banquet being held here.\"Master \u2026 \u2026\" Mo Ran whispered, \"Look at these people drinking at the wedding \u2026 \u2026 they are all shameless!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEven without Mo Ran's reminder, Chu Wanning had already noticed it.Those people were talking and laughing, but no one knew where their voices were coming from. Those who were sitting or standing, playing finger-guessing games and toasting, all had blank faces, as if they were made of paper.\"What should we do?Do we have to go in and drink with them? \"Chu Wanning was not amused by Mo Ran's inappropriate joke. He lowered his head and pondered.At this moment, a rustling sound of footsteps suddenly came from the distance. Two long lines of people appeared from the hazy fog and slowly approached the main building.Chu Wanning and Mo Ran subconsciously hid behind the rockery as the two groups of people approached. The leading group was a pair of smiling golden boy and jade girl. These two people actually had facial features, and their facial features were distinct and their skin tone was thick. In the dim light of the night, they looked very much like the paper dolls of boys and girls that were burned for the dead.Each of them held a red candle in their hands. The candles were as thick as a child's arm, with dragons and phoenixes entwined around them. As the candles burned, the rich fragrance of a hundred butterflies assailed their nostrils. Mo Ran almost fainted again. Fortunately, the wound on his hand that Chu Wanning had stabbed was still hurting. He fiercely poked the wound again, and finally managed to maintain his consciousness.Chu Wanning glanced at him.Mo Ran said, \"\u2026 Ahem, this is quite useful.\"After a pause, he asked curiously, \"Shizun, why don't you need to poke holes in your body to stay awake?\"Chu Wanning said, \"This fragrance has no effect on me.\"\"Ah?Why? \"Chu Wanning said coldly, \"You have good willpower.\"Mo Ran: \"\u2026\"With the golden boy and jade girl in the lead, the two groups of people walked up the stairs. Chu Wanning shifted his gaze back and watched for a while. Suddenly, he said in a low voice, \"Huh?\"He was rarely surprised, so Mo Ran was very curious. Following his line of sight, he was also surprised.The corpses walking unsteadily in the group were all corpses with their eyes closed. Their skin was pale, and they maintained their appearance when they were alive. Most of them were very young, less than twenty years old. There were both men and women, and one of them was particularly familiar.The Eldest Young Master of the Chen Clan, whom he had seen in the coffin, had appeared in this group at some point in time. His eyes were closed as he slowly followed the scent of the candle.Beside him was different from the others. Beside him was another corpse. Beside him was a ghost bride made of paper floating in the air.Young Master Chen was not a big deal, but when they reached the end of the line and saw the people at the end of the line, Mo Ran's face turned pale.Shi Mei and Chen Yaoshi were following behind the corpses with their heads down. Both of them had their eyes closed, and their faces were as white as snow. The way they walked was no different from the corpses in front of them. It was unknown whether they were still alive.Mo Ran's scalp exploded. He jumped up and wanted to rush forward, but Chu Wanning grabbed his shoulder and said, \"Wait.\"\"But Shi Mei \u2014!!\"\"I know.\"Chu Wanning stared at the group that was slowly moving forward and said softly, \"Don't act rashly. Look over there, there's a barrier.If you rush over, the barrier will scream. I'm afraid that all the faceless ghosts in the courtyard will rush at you. The situation will get out of hand. \"Chu Wanning was a barrier master. He was good at setting up barriers, and his eyes were sharp. Mo Ran looked over and saw that there was an almost transparent barrier at the entrance to the courtyard.The golden boy and girl walked to the front of the courtyard and gently blew on the candles, making the flames burn brighter. Then, slowly \u2014 \u2014 they passed through the barrier and walked into the courtyard.The men and women behind them followed them and passed through the barrier without any hindrance. The faceless people in the courtyard who were drinking wine turned their heads and looked at the men and women who entered one after another. They began to laugh and clap.Chu Wanning said, \"Go, follow behind them.When you pass through the barrier, remember not to breathe and close your eyes.Also, no matter what happens, follow those corpses and do not speak. \"There was no need for him to say more. Mo Ran was eager to save people, so he followed Chu Wanning and blended into the crowd of corpses.The number of corpses in the two groups was equal. Chu Wanning stood behind Shi Mei, so Mo Ran could only stand behind Chen Yaoshi. The group moved very slowly. Mo Ran looked at Shi Mei a few times, but all he saw was a pale face and a snow-white neck that drooped weakly.With great difficulty, they finally arrived in front of the barrier. The two of them held their breaths and followed smoothly into the courtyard.After entering, he discovered that the interior was much larger than it looked from the outside. Other than the three-story main building that was decorated with lanterns and decorations, there were small rooms on both sides of the courtyard that were closely connected. There seemed to be at least a hundred of them. The windows of each room were pasted with the big red word \"Xi\" and hung with a red lantern.All the faceless guests suddenly stood up and saluted with the sound of firecrackers and trumpets.In front of the building, a faceless praising officer sang, \"The auspicious hour has arrived. The bride and groom have entered the garden.\"Mo Ran was stunned. What?So the two groups of corpses were the bride and groom?He quickly turned his head to ask for help from Chu Wanning, but the Northern Dipper Celestial Venerable frowned and was immersed in his own thoughts. He did not even bother to look at Mo Ran.Mo Ran felt that his uncle's painstaking efforts were in vain. Going down the mountain to train, bringing this kind of master was more of a blow to his self-esteem than not bringing him along.Suddenly, a group of laughing children rushed out from the courtyard. They were wearing bright red clothes, but they tied their hair into small braids with white headbands. Like fish, they flocked to the two sides of the group and began to pull one person, leading them to the rooms on both sides.Mo Ran did not know what to do. He mouthed to Chu Wanning, \"Master, what should we do?\"Chu Wanning shook his head and pointed to the tide of corpses in front of them. His meaning was self-evident \u2014 follow them.Mo Ran had no choice but to let a child pull him and stumble into one of the rooms. As soon as he entered, the child waved his sleeve in the air, and the door slammed shut.Mo Ran stared at the child, not knowing what this faceless child wanted to do to him.In his previous life, Chu Wanning first rescued Shi Mei and then broke the illusion. He did not do anything during the whole process and easily got rid of the evil spirit. After that, he was only thinking about the wonderful aftertaste of kissing Shi Mei. After that, he did not listen much to Chu Wanning's analysis.Therefore, now that the situation had changed, he had no idea what he would encounter next. He could only brace himself.In the room, there was a dressing table and a bronze mirror. On a wooden frame, there was a black and red auspicious robe embroidered with Ruyi patterns.The child patted the stool, indicating that Mo Ran should sit over there.Mo Ran found that the ghosts here were not very smart. As long as they did not speak, they could not tell the difference between the living and the dead. Therefore, he sat in front of the dressing table as instructed by the child.The child came over and began to help him wash up and change his clothes \u2026Suddenly, a begonia flower floated in through the window and slowly fell into the water in the bronze basin.Mo Ran's eyes lit up. The begonia flower was called Wanye Yuheng. It was Chu Wanning's special tool for silent communication.He picked up the begonia flower from the water. The begonia flower instantly bloomed in his palm, revealing a touch of light golden light in the stamen.He pinched the golden light between his fingers and put it to his ear.Chu Wanning's voice sounded in his ear.\"Mo Ran, I have used Heaven's Inquisition to confirm that this is an illusion created by the ghost master of the Colorful Butterfly Town.It has been worshipped by the villagers for a hundred years and gradually achieved a positive result.As long as there are more ghost weddings, its power will become stronger. Therefore, it is very fond of hosting ghost weddings.Those two rows of corpses should be the ghost couples that the people of Colorful Butterfly Town had gathered under its witness over the past several hundred years. It likes this kind of liveliness. Every night, it would summon those corpses into the dreamland and hold another ghost marriage. Moreover, every time it does so, its power would become a bit stronger. \"Mo Ran thought in his heart \u2014 \u2014 What a freak!!When other immortals were free, they would at most play matchmaking with young boys and girls. This ghost master of the Colorful Butterfly Town, it said that it had an immortal body, but its brain had not grown out yet. Its only hobby was to matchmake male and female corpses. Not only did it do it once, but it also summoned the corpses of those ghost weddings from their graves every night and did it again, again and again and again.Was it so interesting to watch a group of corpses?This Celestial Bachelor was truly insane.Chu Wanning said, \"Its true body is not here. Don't act rashly. In a while, follow the instructions of the golden boy and jade girl. Since it wants to absorb the power of the ghost weddings, it will show its true form in the end.\"Mo Ran wanted to ask, \"What about Shi Mei?What happened to Shi Mei? \"\"Don't worry about Shi Mei. Like Madam Chen, he was confused by the powder and temporarily lost his consciousness.\"Chu Wanning was very thoughtful. He clearly explained what Mo Ran could do. \"Take care of yourself. I will handle everything.\"After saying that, the voice disappeared.At the same time, the apprentice finished dressing up Mo Ran. He looked up and saw a handsome face in the bronze mirror. The corners of his mouth were slightly raised, and his eyebrows were clean and fresh. His collars were crossed, and his robes were red. However, his long hair was tied up with a white ribbon. He really looked like a groom of a ghost wedding.The apprentice made a \"please\" gesture, and the closed door of the room opened with a squeak.Under the cloister, there was a row of corpses wearing wedding robes. There were both male and female corpses. It seemed that this ghost master of the Colorful Butterfly Town was really not enlightened. It just wanted to grab a couple and marry them. As for whether it was a man and a woman, a man and a man, or a woman and a woman, it did not matter.On this side of the cloister, there was only one row of corpses. The other row was on the opposite side. It was too far away for him to see if Chu Wanning and Shi Mei had come out.The line was slowly moving forward. From time to time, he could hear the chanting of the ceremony in the building. One after another, the ghost weddings were being completed.Mo Ran glanced at Chen Yaoshi, who was in front of him, and felt that something was wrong. He pondered for a long time, and just as the line was getting shorter and shorter, the last few couples were about to get their turn, this stubborn hooligan finally got it.Ah!According to the group, wouldn't this woman in front of him be going through the ceremony of bowing to the Heaven and Earth with Shumi?Was he going to be a couple with that little bitch Chu Wanning?How could that be?At that moment, the former Sovereign Emperor of the Human Realm was unhappy. He pursed his lips and rudely pulled Chen Yaoshi to the front of the line.The little boy next to them was stunned, but Mo Ran soon put on a look of a half-paralyzed hanged ghost, hanging his head and hanging his head in the middle of the corpses. Those golden boys and girls with low cultivation were stunned for a while. They probably did not understand what was wrong, so they did not react.Mo Ran was happy.He followed the line excitedly. When he reached the end of the line, he would meet Shi Mei who was on the other side of the corridor.At the same time.Chu Wanning looked at Shi Mei who was standing in front of him and thought for a while. He did not know what kind of danger they would encounter.He had always been tough on the mouth but soft on the heart. Although he was very harsh, in fact, as long as he was there, he would never let his disciple take risks.Hence, he pulled Shi Mei and pulled the groggy little fellow to the back while he stood at Shi Mei's original position.It was his turn.At the end of the corridor, the Ghost Hunter was holding a black and red tray. When she saw Chu Wanning coming, she chuckled. Her featureless face made a girl's voice.\"Congratulations, my wife. Congratulations, my wife. You are like old friends.\"Chu Wanning's face darkened instantly.My, my wife \u2026??Don't you have eyes?He looked at the blank face of the Ghost Hunter and held back.You really don't have f * cking eyes.The Wandering Ghost Image giggled as she picked up the red veil from the tray. She raised her jade-like arms and covered Chu Wan Ning's face.Then she reached out her cold hands and gently supported Chu Wanning. She smiled and said, \"My wife, please.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe red veil was thin and hung in front of his eyes. Although he could still see, he couldn't see clearly.Chu Wanning's eyes were hazy and his face was gloomy. He was brought to the parlor by the ghost.Opening his eyes and seeing the person standing there through the red veil, Chu Wanning felt the temperature around him drop by several degrees.Mo Ran was also stunned.No \u2026 Shouldn't it be Shi Mei who came out?The \"bride\" in front of him was wearing bright red makeup, and her face was covered by a thin veil. Although her facial features were slightly blurred under the veil, no matter how he looked at it, it was still Chu Waning's cold, handsome, and murderous face. She was glaring at him unhappily, and that gaze was as if she wanted to kill someone.Mo Ran, \"\u2026\"He was at a loss at first, then his expression gradually became complicated. All kinds of emotions flashed across his face like a merry-go-round. In the end, it became a strange silence. He and Chu Wanning looked at each other. The atmosphere was awkward to the extreme.However, the golden boy and jade girl following behind them giggled and clapped their hands, and began to sing in a crisp voice.\"White Dishui, the waves are clear; Ghost Mandarin Duck, the flowers are welcome.Together in the coffin, lying in the same hole; the will before the body, the will after death.From now on, the two will accompany each other in the netherworld, lonely souls will never leave each other. \"The song was ghostly, but it also revealed a lingering sadness.If he could speak, Mo Ran only wanted to say one word.\"Pei.\"But he couldn't speak.In front of the stage, there was a man and woman made of paper. Although they didn't have faces, they were dressed luxuriously. They were slightly loose and bloated. They should be representing the middle-aged parents.The officiant began to sing again, \"The bride is charming and shy. She lowers her head and her eyes are soft. The red veil covers her face and her smile. Please come and lift the veil.\"\"\u2026\" Mo Ran was very reluctant at first, but when he heard this, he was about to go crazy from holding back his laughter.Hahahaha, the bride is charming and shy. Ahahahaha!Chu Wanning's face was ashen. He suppressed his anger and closed his eyes, as if he would lose his hearing if he did so.The Wandering Ghost smiled and handed a folding fan to Mo Ran. \"Fan\" and \"good\" had the same pronunciation, referring to the good karma of this marriage.\"The groom, please lift the veil.\"Mo Ran held back his laughter and followed her advice. He held the fan and lifted the veil in front of Chu Wanning. His eyelashes fluttered with laughter as he looked at Chu Wanning's moving face.As if sensing the other party's mocking gaze, Chu Wanning held back for a while, but he couldn't hold it in any longer and suddenly opened his eyes. His pair of eyes flashed with lightning and were filled with murderous intent.However, when paired with the red veil on his hair and the fiery red wedding dress on his body, although the sharpness could not be reduced, the corners of his eyes, which were slightly red because of anger and grievance, actually had a unique charm.Mo Ran looked at such eyes and couldn't help but be stunned. His smile froze in an instant.The master in front of him suddenly overlapped with a moment in his previous life. For a moment, he didn't know what was going on.Although it was only a short moment, it was enough to make Mo Ran break out in a cold sweat.He had done three ruthless things to Chu Wanning:The first was to kill, and that was to use a killing move against Chu Wanning.Second, humiliate, forcing Chu Wanning to have sex with him.Third \u2026Third, it was the happiest thing he did in his previous life, and also the thing he regretted the most later.Of course, the Emperor of the Human Realm would not admit that he regretted anything, but the torment in the depths of his heart could not be escaped in the end.Damn it.Why did he think of that crazy past again, and think of Chu Wanning at that time?Mo Ran shook his head and bit his lips, trying to get rid of Chu Wanning's face in his memory, and looked at the person in front of him again.Chu Wanning had been staring at him with an \"I'll kill you\" look.Mo Ran didn't want to provoke this thorn, so he had to pretend to be a grandson and smile with a helpless face.The officiant said, \"The bride and groom, wash and wash.\"The so-called wash and wash was that the newlyweds had to wash each other's hands after they had cleaned themselves.The ghost came with a porcelain pot full of water and asked the two to wash their hands. The water was collected by a basin below.Chu Wanning's face was full of disgust, but he had to wash for the other after washing himself.Mo Ran was a little absent-minded, so he seemed to be restrained. He silently washed Chu Wanning's hands. Chu Wanning was not good-tempered, so he splashed the whole pot of water on Mo Ran, and half of his sleeve was wet.\"\u2026 \u2026 \u2026\"Mo Ran stared at half of his wet sleeve for a while. He didn't know where his mind was wandering, but there was nothing on his face. Deep in his dark eyes, there was a subtle light flowing.He thought in a daze.Chu Wanning didn't change, he never changed.His actions, his thoughts, his past life, this life, it was exactly the same, he didn't change at all \u2026 \u2026He slowly raised his head, and there was even a moment when he felt that he was standing at the peak of life and death, standing in front of the Shaman Mountain Hall. Chu Wanning walked towards him from the bottom of the stairs, and the next moment, he was going to kneel in front of him. His noble head was going to hit the ground, and his straight back was going to bend. Chu Wanning was going to kneel in front of him, and never get up.\"The wash and wash is done.\"The Wandering Ghost suddenly sang a long song, waking Mo Ran up from his memories.He abruptly regained his senses and met Chu Wanning's pair of eyes. Chu Wanning's pitch-black pupils flashed with a piercing cold light, like a curved blade covering snow, causing one's heart to tremble in fear.Mo Ran: \"\u2026\"\u2026 Er, the previous life was still the previous life. He could only think about Chu Wanning kneeling in front of him in this life. If he wanted to make it happen, the price he had to pay was too great \u2026After the washing ceremony, there was the ceremony of being in the same cell, and then the ceremony of being in the same position.The Demonic Spirit sang slowly, \"Husband and wife drink a cup of wine together, never to leave each other.\"They exchanged their cups and bowed to the heavens and earth.Chu Wanning looked like he was about to go crazy from anger. His slightly raised slender phoenix eyes narrowed dangerously. Mo Ran reckoned that after he left, he would be considered light if he chopped that damned MC into pieces.But this kind of Chu Wanning really couldn't be scrutinized.Even if he took one more look, he would fall back into those messy and dirty memories, unable to extricate himself.\"First bow \u2014 kneel to the heavens and earth \u2014\"Originally, he thought that even if it was just a show, with Chu Wanning's arrogance, he would definitely not kneel. But he didn't expect that in order to complete this set of steps, his eyebrows twitched, and he closed his eyes and actually knelt down. The two of them kowtowed together.\"Second bow \u2014 kneel to the elders \u2014\"Alright, I'll just kneel to those two faceless paper dolls. That can also be called elders.\"Third bow \u2014 kneel to the heavens \u2014 husband and wife kowtow to each other \u2014\"Chu Wan Ning lowered her deep eyes and didn't even look at Mo Ran. She turned around, and with a clang, she quickly bent over and gritted her teeth so hard that they almost broke.Who knew that the two of them didn't have a tacit understanding. When they got closer, they bumped into each other with a bang.Chu Wanning sucked in a breath of cold air from the pain. He held his forehead, raised his teary eyes, and glared fiercely at Mo Weiyu who was also rubbing his forehead.\"\u2026\" Mo Ran could only mouth, \"I'm sorry.\"Chu Wanning didn't say anything. With a gloomy face, he rolled his eyes.Then it was the hair-tying ceremony. The praising official sang, \"Tying hair as husband and wife, loving each other without suspicion\". The ghost handed over the golden scissors. Mo Ran couldn't help but shrink back, afraid that Chu Wanning would directly stab him to death if he was unhappy.Chu Wanning seemed to have this intention, but in the end, he only cut a bunch of each other's hair and put it in the brocade pouch presented by the golden boy and jade girl. The \"bride\", Chu Wanning, kept it well.Mo Ran really wanted to ask him, \"You won't take my hair in a fit of anger and use it to stab little people, will you?\"The praising official sang, \"Ceremony \u2014 complete \u2014\"Both of them sighed in relief and stood up from the ground.Who knew that in the next moment, the praising official leisurely shouted again,\"The auspicious hour has arrived, send them to the bridal chamber \u2014\"What, the, ghost!!!Mo Ran instantly froze.He almost spat out a mouthful of blood!What kind of joke was this? If he dared to enter the bridal chamber with Chu Wanning, this wedding would really become a f * cking ghost marriage!Although dying under a peony flower and becoming a ghost was also romantic, but the person he wanted in this lifetime \u2026 no, the person he wanted in both lifetimes was the unsullied Shi Mei who came out of the mud and not this cold-blooded demon Chu Wanning who tied up all those who coveted him and threw them into the mud to be dyed red!!Was it too late to run away now?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOf course, running away from the wedding was just a thought. After all, Shi Mei was still here. No matter what, he couldn't leave first.But this ghost emcee, isn't he too f * cking responsible?Mo Ran's face was ashen, and his nose was about to become crooked.He thought to himself, forget about the wedding gift, why does he f * cking care about other people's nuptial chambers?Moreover!He's f * cking a corpse!His corpse is stiff!How can he still have a nuptial chamber?!!!As for Chu Wanning's expression, he didn't dare to look. He just stared at the carpet and pretended to be stupid.At this moment, he really wanted to grab the ghost emcee who was hiding in some corner and roar at him \u2014 F * ck your mother, you're good!Let me see you dig a hole!!The golden boy and jade girl crowded around the two of them and pushed them to the back hall.There was a coffin there. It was painted with bright red paint and was huge, twice the size of a normal coffin. It looked exactly the same as the coffin that was dug up outside.Chu Wanning pondered for a moment and understood.Mo Ran immediately understood the ghost emcee's meaning and immediately let out a big sigh of relief.Of course, the dead couldn't have a nuptial chamber. The so-called nuptial chamber should refer to being sealed in the same coffin and carried down to be buried together, completing the so-called \"death in the same grave\".At this time, the golden boy and jade girl crisply confirmed their thoughts: \"First, let the wife enter the nuptial chamber.\"Chu Wanning waved his wide sleeves and laid down with a cold face.\"Then, let the husband enter the nuptial chamber.\"Mo Ran leaned against the coffin and blinked his eyes. He saw that Chu Wanning had already taken up most of the space.Although the coffin was spacious, it was still a little crowded with two men inside. When he laid down, he couldn't help but press down on Chu Wanning's loose clothes, causing the other party to glare angrily.The golden boy and jade girl walked around the coffin and started to sing again. It was the same gloomy but faintly sorrowful song from before.\"White Emperor Water, clear waves; Ghost Mandarin Duck, welcoming flowers.Together in the coffin, lying in the same grave; Will before the body, will after death.From now on, the two will accompany each other in the netherworld, lonely souls will never leave each other. \"After singing, the children slowly pushed the coffin lid up, one on the left and one on the right. With a muffled sound, the surroundings instantly turned pitch black.Chu Wanning and Mo Ran were sealed in the coffin.The coffin was made of extremely thick materials. If they spoke softly, no one outside could hear them. Chu Wanning raised his hand and set up a sound-blocking barrier to ensure that the sound inside would not spread to the outside. After doing all this, the first thing he said was \u2014....................... was........................Even though Mo Ran complained in his heart, he still moved to the side...................................Mo Ran felt wronged. \"Master, I'm already plastered to the coffin. What else do you want?\". Chu Wanning finally snorted and stopped talking.Mo Ran curled up in the corner for a while. Suddenly, he felt the coffin shake. The people outside lifted the coffin and began to slowly move in an unknown direction.Mo Ran listened attentively to the movements outside. Thinking that Shi Mei and that Chen Yaoshi should be in the same coffin, Mo Ran couldn't help but feel depressed. But there was nothing he could do.Chu Wanning's barrier was very powerful. The sounds inside couldn't be transmitted out, but the sounds outside could. Through the coffin lid, they could hear the sound of firecrackers and drums. Mo Ran asked, \"These demons and ghosts are really bored. Where are they going with the coffin?\"It was very dark inside the coffin. He couldn't see the other person's face. He could only hear the voice, \"It's the same as the custom of Colorful Butterfly Town. They should be carrying the coffin to a temple outside the town.\"Mo Ran nodded and listened attentively for a while, then said, \"\u2026 Shizun, the footsteps outside seem to be increasing in number.\"\"During the Hundred Ghosts Parade, all the coffins will be carried there together.If I'm not wrong, when we reach the temple, that ghost master will show his true form.You can absorb 'merit' from every pair of ghost weddings. \"Mo Ran asked, \"There are so many coffins, hundreds of them. If we walk around town, won't people notice us?\"\"You can't find them.\" Chu Wanning said, \"The ones carrying the coffin are the Ghost Golden Child and the Ghost Jade Maiden.Normal people can't see the things on ghosts. \"Mo Ran asked again, \"How do you know so much?\"Chu Wanning replied, \"Just now in the room, Heaven's Inquisition interrogated a Ghost Golden Boy.\"Mo Ran: \"\u2026\"After a moment of silence, he asked again, \"Then what's the matter with Young Master Chen lying in the red coffin that was dug out on the mountain?Why are people from the Chen family dying one after another? \"Chu Wanning: \"I don't know.\"Mo Ran was a little surprised, \"The Ghost Golden Boy didn't tell you?\"Chu Wanning: \"The Ghost Golden Boy said that he didn't know either.\"Mo Ran: \"\u2026\"After a moment of silence, Chu Wanning said, \"But I feel that there's something that the family didn't tell us.\"\"What do you mean?\"\"You have to remember, although the thing enshrined in this temple is very evil, in the end, it's already an immortal body. It needs people's worship to become stronger.\"Mo Ran didn't listen to Chu Wanning's lessons seriously in his previous life, so he always lacked the necessary knowledge. In this life, it was better to be humble and ask for advice, so he asked, \"So what if it's an immortal body?\"\"\u2026 What were you doing last month when we talked about the difference between immortals, ghosts, gods, and demons?\"Mo Ran thought to himself, I'm reborn, how can I remember what I was doing in a class more than ten years ago!But I was just scratching my feet under the table, watching \"Up the Nine Dragons and One Phoenix Bed\", staring blankly at Shi Mei, or staring at Chu Wanning's neck, secretly gesturing how to cut off this person's head without anyone noticing.Chu Wanning said coldly, \"Go back and copy 'Observation Records of the Six Realms' ten times as punishment.\"\"\u2026 Oh.\"The price of playing truant was painful.\"The immortals in the world are different from the gods. The gods are free, but the immortals are bound. They intervene in the affairs of the mortal world because of the will of humans.\"Mo Ran was stunned, \"So the murder case of the Chen family was done because someone begged it?\"Chu Wanning's voice sounded very cold in the darkness.\"I think that the person who begged it was not necessarily the person who was still alive.\"Mo Ran opened his mouth, but before he could ask again, the golden boy and girl carrying the coffin suddenly shook and tilted to the left, probably because they had encountered a steep slope.The sudden shaking, coupled with the smooth interior of the coffin, made it impossible to grab.Mo Ran lost his balance and rolled over, crashing into his master's arms.\"Ugh \u2026\"Covering his sore nose, Mo Ran blankly raised his head. Just as he was about to figure out the situation, a faint begonia fragrance floated to the tip of his nose. This fragrance was as light as the morning mist, and it was still tinged with the coolness of the night. Many fragrances in the world made people confused, but this fragrance was clear and sharp, waking people up.Mo Ran was stunned at first, then suddenly stiffened.He couldn't be more familiar with this begonia fragrance. It was the smell of Chu Wanning's body, and for Mo Ran, this smell was always intertwined with desire.In an instant, some deep-rooted evil thought was like a fire in the forest, and with a bang, it rushed to his brain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Anyone who was trapped in such a confined space with a person they had slept with countless times, regardless of whether the person on the bed was sincere or not, whether it was out of revenge or love, once they smelled the familiar scent of the other person, they couldn't help but feel ripples in their heart.Besides, Mo Ran himself was a bastard.Shi Mei was his white moonlight. He couldn't bear to touch him or destroy him.He only cared about destroying Chu Wanning. Only in front of Chu Wanning could he vent all of his darkness, beastly desires, and the violence in his bones without restraint.He wanted to crush this man, tear him apart, and force him to play all the tricks he would never play on Shi Mei.In his previous life, every time he saw Chu Wanning raise his neck and gulp, he felt that he was about to become a vicious beast that only knew how to drink blood. He wanted to bite open this man's throat, grind his teeth, suck his blood, and chew his flesh.If he didn't feel sorry for Chu Wanning, he would do his best to ruin him.In the end, her body had developed a habit. As long as she smelled Chu Wanning's fragrance, her stomach would be on fire and her heart would itch. She would want to tie this person to the bed and f * ck him.There was a moment of silence in the coffin. Only Mo Ran's slightly anxious heartbeat could be heard.He knew that Chu Wanning's face was very close, and he could feel the other's breath. If he were to bite at this time, Chu Wanning would definitely not be able to break free, but \u2026Forget it.Mo Ran leaned back and distanced himself from Chu Wanning.This was not easy as there was not much space left in the coffin.\"I'm sorry, Shizun.\" Mo Ran laughed and pretended to be a coward. \"I didn't expect this coffin to shake!\"With that said, the coffin tilted again.Mo Ran rolled into Chu Wanning's arms.Chu Wanning: \"\u2026\"Mo Ran retreated again, and the coffin shook again. The cycle repeated several times.\"I don't f * cking believe it.\" Mo Ran leaned back again.The golden boy and girl were probably walking on a slope, and the walls of the coffin were very slippery. After a short while, Mo Ran had no choice but to roll in front of Chu Wanning.\"Master \u2026\" She bit her lip, feeling wronged.This guy had a youthful cuteness to begin with. If he deliberately hid his wolf tail and pretended to be a puppy, his acting was actually quite convincing.Chu Wanning didn't say anything.Mo Ran really didn't want to roll around anymore, so he gave up struggling. \"I didn't do it on purpose.\"Chu Wanning: \"\u2026\"Mo Ran said in a small voice, \"But the wound on my back hurts so much \u2026\"In the darkness, Chu Wanning seemed to sigh softly. The gongs and drums outside were a little noisy, and Mo Ran wasn't sure if he could really hear them clearly.But in the next moment, Mo Ran smelled an even clearer begonia scent. Chu Wanning's hand was around his back, blocking the gap where he could have slammed into him.Although it wasn't a hug, Chu Wanning's arm was empty, deliberately avoiding contact with Mo Ran's body. Only the fabric of Mo Ran's clothes touched, but this position was more or less intimate.\"Be careful, don't bump into me again.\"The voice was deep, like porcelain soaked in a stream. It had a kind of simple dignity. If one listened without hatred, it was actually very outstanding.\"\u2026 Mm.\"Suddenly, no one spoke again.At this time, Mo Ran was still a teenager, not as tall as an adult, so when he leaned in Chu Wanning's arms, his forehead just barely reached Chu Wanning's chin.This feeling was very familiar, but also very strange.What was familiar was the person lying next to him.But what was strange was the position he was in.Once upon a time, in the past, he was lying at the peak of life and death in the Shaman Palace, the Emperor Ta, who had become a lonely person, holding Chu Wanning tightly in his arms in the darkness that was so long that it was hard to breathe.At that time, he was already taller than Chu Wanning, and stronger than his teacher. His arms were like iron pincers, like a cage, locking up the remaining warmth in his arms, as if he was hugging the last fire in the world.He lowered his head and kissed Chu Wanning's long black hair, then greedily leaned down and buried his face deep into his neck, biting and nibbling mercilessly.\"I hate you, Chu Wanning.I hate you to death. \"His voice was a little hoarse.\"But, I only have you left.\"A violent crash shattered Mo Ran's memories, the sound of gongs and drums suddenly stopped, and the surroundings were deathly silent.\"Teacher \u2026\"Chu Wanning reached out his hand and touched his lips, saying in a low voice, \"Don't speak, we're here.\"Sure enough, there were no more rustling footsteps outside, and the surroundings were deathly silent.Chu Wanning's fingertips lit up a cluster of pale golden flames, and drew a thin opening on the wall of the coffin, just enough for the two of them to see through.As expected, they were carried to the outskirts of the Colorful Butterfly Town. In front of the temple that worshipped the ghost master, there were densely packed coffins buried together, and the strong scent of butterflies in the air was getting thicker and thicker, drifting into the coffins through the opening.Mo Ran suddenly felt that something was wrong, \"Teacher, don't you think that the scent here, and the scent in the illusion, is a little different from the scent in Childe Chen's coffin?\"\"\u2026 What do you mean?\"Mo Ran was quite sensitive to smells, he said, \"When we were in the North Mountain, the smell that drifted out when the coffin was split open was very nice, and didn't make me uncomfortable at all, so it should be the scent of butterflies.But ever since I entered the illusion, I always felt that although the smell was similar, there were some subtle differences, but I couldn't figure out what the difference was, but now \u2026 I think I know. \"Chu Wanning turned to look at him, \"You don't like the smell?\"Mo Ran stuck close to the opening, still staring outside, then said, \"Yes.I didn't like the smell of incense since I was young.Here, and the smell in the illusion, it's not the scent of butterflies, but the special high incense that the people of Colorful Butterfly Town use to worship the ghost master.Look over there \u2014 \"Chu Wanning followed his line of sight, in the clay incense burner in front of the temple, there were indeed three incense sticks as thick as an arm burning, faintly releasing a sweet smell into the wind.The people of Colorful Butterfly Town were good at using flowers to make all kinds of spices, so the incense used to worship the gods and Buddhas were all made in the town, and not bought from outside.Since the flowers used were all planted in the outskirts of the town, the smell of the mixture was actually not that different to the layman's smell.Chu Wanning pondered, \"Could it be that the scent in Childe Chen's coffin has nothing to do with the smell in the illusion?\"He didn't have time to sort out this newly discovered detail, when a dazzling red light suddenly emitted from the temple, interrupting his train of thought.The two people hiding in the coffin looked up at the same time, only to see the light in the temple shining brightly, illuminating the surroundings.There was a row of iron shelves at the side of the temple, on which there were red lotus lanterns used for making wishes. Those lanterns were originally extinguished, but at this time, they were all lit up one by one.The virgin boys and girls guarding the coffin all knelt down and chanted, \"The Empress of the Ceremony has descended to the mortal world, to guide us wild ghosts and lonely souls to escape eternal suffering, to meet the right person, to lie together in the coffin, to be company in the Yellow Springs.\"In the midst of the chanting, the ghost master of the ceremony in the temple emitted a golden immortal light, then she lowered her eyelids, slowly moved the corners of her mouth, and floated down from the altar.Her movements were very elegant, and her bearing was very elegant.Unfortunately, her body was made of mud, so it was too heavy. With a bang, she smashed a big hole in the ground.Mo Ran: \"Pfft.\"Chu Wanning: \"\u2026\"The ghost master of the ceremony seemed to be very dissatisfied with her roots. She stared at the big hole on the ground for a while, then slowly walked out of the hole and tidied up her clothes.She looked like a woman with heavy makeup, dressed in red and green, and was quite cheerful.In the dark night, she turned her neck and came to the front of the hundreds of coffins. The night wind was filled with the stench of corpses, and she seemed to be in a better mood. She slowly opened her arms and laughed twice.\"Believe in me, worship me, and you will be able to meet the right person, and complete the important thing in life that you didn't do before you died.\" The young voice floated in the night, and the ghosts excitedly kowtowed.\"May the Empress of the Ceremony protect \u2014 \u2014\"\"May the Empress of the Ceremony bestow marriage \u2014 \u2014\"Pleas like this rose and fell one after another. The ghost master seemed to enjoy it very much. He slowly shuttled through the rows of coffins. His long nails, which were painted bright red, scraped across the coffin lid, making an ear-piercing sound.Mo Ran curiously asked, \"Master, I remember you said that demons, immortals, ghosts, gods, demons, and humans all belong to the six realms, but this immortal doesn't live high in the nine heavens, why is it associated with the ghosts of the underground?\"\"Because she is in charge of the Minghun, and mainly eats the offerings of the ghosts.\"Chu Wanning said, \"The ghosts can greatly increase her power, or else she wouldn't be able to cultivate into an immortal body in just a short hundred years.With such benefits, she is naturally willing to be associated with her 'friends' in the underworld. \"The ghost master of the ceremony walked around the coffins, and returned to the front. The empty and tender voice sounded again, \"Open a coffin, and bestow a marriage.Start from the left. \"Following its order, the first coffin on the left slowly opened. The golden boy and the jade girl greeted it respectfully. The two corpses inside staggered out. The gorgeous fiery red wedding gowns made the corpses' faces look paler and paler. They looked lifeless.The Minghun couple slowly came to the front of the ghost master of the ceremony, and knelt down.The ghost master of the ceremony put his hand between them and said, \"I, in the name of the Empress of the Ceremony, bestow a marriage after death. From now on, you will be husband and wife, and the man and woman will be a good match.\"Mo Ran rolled his eyes and muttered, \"If you don't know how to compose a poem, then don't compose one.It's a good oath of marriage, why does it sound so lewd? \"Chu Wanning said coldly, \"You have a dirty mind.\"Mo Ran shut his mouth.However, it didn't take long for the ghost emcee to prove that it wasn't Mo Ran who was despicable, but the deity in charge of the ghost wedding who was truly despicable.The pair of corpses that had been bestowed with marriage seemed to have swallowed an aphrodisiac. They were clearly already dead, but they suddenly began to tear at each other's clothes and passionately kissed each other. They actually shamelessly tangled with each other in public.\"\u2026\" Chu Wanning was speechless.Mo Ran: \"\u2026\"\"In the name of the Master of Ceremonies, I bestow upon you heavenly bliss.Yin and Yang can be intertwined. So what if it's life and death? \"The Ghost Emcee's shouts became sharper and louder.The movements of the two corpses became more and more exaggerated. After the male corpse took off his clothes, he was angry and energetic, no different from a living person.Mo Ran was stunned. \"This \u2026 this \u2026 is f * cking possible?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He should be selling aphrodisiacs. Other people's aphrodisiacs could at most make living people show off their masculinity. But this immortal was good. With a wave of his little hand, even the dead became hard.It was truly a miraculous hand that brought back spring!He was watching with relish when suddenly, Chu Wanning reached out and covered Mo Ran's ears.Mo Ran, \"Eh?\"Chu Wanning's expression was extremely cold, \"Don't look at such a despicable technique.\"\"Then you should cover your eyes. Why are you covering my ears?\"Chu Wanning was expressionless, \"Don't look, don't listen. Close your eyes yourself.\"Mo Ran, \"Pfft.Shizun, you're really \u2026 \"Why don't you take a look at your own flushed face? If you want to close your eyes, you should be the one doing it.Mo Ran couldn't help but feel a little amused. Chu Wanning was a person made of ice and snow. He hadn't even seen an erotic picture before. Now that he saw the pleasure of a couple in front of him, he was probably going to choke to death.The dead couple was together, and gradually, the two of them seemed to come to life. The originally dead throat that couldn't make a sound actually began to make rough breathing sounds similar to that of a living person.Chu Wanning was obviously disgusted. He suddenly turned his face away, not willing to look anymore.Mo Ran was very happy to see this. He teased him and smiled wickedly as he lifted his chin.Chu Wanning quickly moved back as if he had been stabbed. \"What are you doing?\"\"Nothing,\" Mo Ran said sweetly with a hint of ridicule and teasing. He looked at him up and down as if he was teasing him.How old was he? Looking at this kind of thing and still blushing \u2026Oh, no, it should be a mixture of green and red.It was quite funny.\"Shizun, didn't you tell us that we must clearly see the other party's ability before we act?You should at least clearly see the ability of this damned master of ceremonies. \"\"What's there to see? I'm not looking.\"Mo Ran sighed, \"Why is your face so thin?\"Chu Wanning angrily said, \"Dirty and filthy, it hurts my eyes!\"\"Then I have no choice but to do it.\"As Mo Ran spoke, he obediently laid down on the ground and looked outside again. As he looked, he exclaimed, \"Ah\", \"Wow\", \"Awesome\", \"Aiyo\", and so on.This caused Chu Wanning to become incomparably berserk, almost unable to hold down the coffin lid.He growled angrily in a low voice, \"Just look! What are you talking about?!\"Mo Ran said innocently, \"I thought you wanted to hear it.\"Chu Wanning finally couldn't take it anymore. He grabbed Mo Ran's neck and gnashed his teeth. \"If you make one more sound, I'll throw you out to feed the zombies!\"He had had enough of teasing her.Chu Wanning was a person who couldn't be pushed too hard. If he was pushed too hard, he would be served with Heaven's Inquisition. Thus, Mo Ran restrained himself and obediently laid down on the ground. He stared outside and didn't make a sound.As the ghost couple enjoyed themselves to the extreme, the male corpse let out a low growl and laid down on the female corpse's body, spasming. Suddenly, green smoke rose from their bodies. The ghost master of ceremonies opened his mouth and greedily inhaled the green smoke until the last strand was swallowed into his stomach. This time, he greedily wiped the corner of his mouth and his eyes revealed a bright light.It seemed that this was the \"merit\" that the ghost couple gave him, which would increase his cultivation.\"Haha, hahaha \u2026\" The Ghost Emcee tasted the sweetness, and his face glowed with radiance. When he opened his mouth again, his ethereal voice became clearer. He shouted and roared, and his sharp voice seemed to want to pierce through this endless night. \"Rise!Rise!You lovestruck men and resentful women!I grant you the grace of fish and water!You provide me with the virtue of worship!Rise!Rise!All rise! \"Mo Ran's heart skipped a beat. It's over \u2026What is it trying to do?!The hundreds of coffins around them trembled at the same time, confirming Mo Ran's thoughts.This ghost master of ceremonies wanted to summon all the corpses in the coffins to have sex and absorb the \"merit\" in one go!No longer in the mood to joke, Mo Ran pulled Chu Wanning, \"Shizun!!!\"\"What now?!\"\"Quick!Get out!Shi Mei is still trapped with that little wife of the Chen family! \"Mo Ran was about to go crazy.\" Let's go save him! \"Chu Wanning glanced outside. He didn't expect that the ghost master of ceremonies would have such a big taste. He didn't want to do it one by one, but wanted to do it all in one go!The trembling of the coffins beside them became more and more intense. It seemed that all the ghost couples were beginning to feel the call and started to do things in the coffins.This thought made Chu Wanning choke for a moment, and his expression became even more unsightly.At this time, the ghost master of ceremonies who was standing in the same place and laughing to his heart's content suddenly felt something. He turned his head abruptly, and a pair of black, unfocused eyes looked past the other coffins and landed on Mo Ran and Chu Wanning's coffin.Although it had low intelligence, it could feel that there was no familiar scent of lust in that coffin.There was no worship.No \u2026Living people!!!He suddenly arched his body and rushed over with a scream. The ghost master of ceremonies' robes fluttered, and a pair of bloody red claws pierced through the thick coffin.Its attack was too sudden, and Mo Ran didn't have time to retreat. Besides, the space in the coffin was very small, so there was no way for him to retreat. Just as his head was about to be pierced by the Nine Yin White Bone Claws, his body suddenly fell. Chu Wanning quickly protected him in his arms and blocked in front of him. The ghost master of ceremonies' five sharp claws suddenly pierced into Chu Wanning's shoulder!It was so deep that it touched the bone!\"\u2026 \u2026\"Chu Wanning let out a muffled groan, but he endured it and didn't shout out.The other hand that was not injured was still burning with a silencing spell. It tapped Mo Ran's lips, blocking the sound that Mo Ran was about to make.The ghost master of ceremonies' claws fiercely clawed at Chu Wanning's flesh.It had a brain made of mud, so it could only determine whether a person was dead or alive by sound.Chu Wanning actually really didn't make a sound under such circumstances. Blood flowed down his shoulder. Mo Ran was pressed in his arms, so he couldn't see his injuries, but he could clearly feel that Chu Wanning was slightly trembling \u2026A living person \u2026 or a dead person?A living person couldn't be like this and still not make a sound.The ghost master of ceremonies couldn't tell for a moment. Its sharp claws tore at the flesh on Chu Wanning's shoulder and scratched.Chu Wanning was in so much pain that he trembled and convulsed. Cold sweat soaked his clothes.But he still bit his lips tightly and protected his disciple in his arms. It was as if he had really become a corpse, a dead person. He pressed against the edge of the coffin, like the iron cast on the coffin wall.The ghost master of ceremonies seemed to have finally confirmed that the person inside was not a living person. It suddenly pulled out its hand, and blood splattered everywhere. One could even hear the sticky sound of fingers digging into flesh and bone, which made one's hair stand on end.Chu Wanning's tense body seemed to have suddenly lost its strength. He let go of Mo Ran and panted softly.A strong smell of blood flowed in the coffin.Mo Ran raised his head. With the light leaking in through the hole, he could see Chu Wanning's drooping eyelashes and the moist but stubborn and silent eyes under the eyelashes.That pair of slightly raised phoenix eyes were blurred with pain, but more than that, there was ruthlessness and stubbornness. A mist filled the air \u2026Mo Ran wanted to speak, but Chu Wanning shook his head. He didn't remove the Silence Spell on his lips.After a while, he took a deep breath and wrote on the back of Mo Ran's hand with trembling fingertips:The enchantment has been damaged, you can't speak.The ghost master of ceremonies outside tilted its head, as if it didn't understand why the person inside didn't listen to its instructions and couldn't feel any worship.Chu Wanning raised his head and looked at it through the gap. His uninjured hand shone with a golden light and a willow vine with a flowing luster of flames was summoned.He held Heaven's Inquisition and narrowed his eyes.The next moment, it broke out of the coffin!!!The coffin exploded. Chu Wanning flew up like lightning. Heaven's Inquisition was accurate and fast. It suddenly strangled the ghost master of ceremonies' neck. The ghost master of ceremonies let out an ear-piercing howl \u2014 \u2014\"Who are you!How dare you! \"Chu Wanning's reply was only one word, \"Get lost!\"His red robe fluttered like the clouds. He had been waiting for a long time for a sure-kill attack. He immediately made a move with one hand. Heaven's Inquisition Strangle!He broke the ghost master of ceremonies' neck!A thick red mist mixed with a strange fragrance gushed out from the broken neck.Chu Wanning quickly retreated to avoid the mist. He shouted, \"Mo Ran!Thousand Kill Slash! \"Mo Ran was already on standby. When he heard the order, he took out the dark sword sheath in his sleeve and poured spiritual energy into it. He threw it at the broken body that was groping for its head.The clay body split open, revealing its translucent body with flowing red light.Chu Wanning raised Heaven's Inquisition again and forcibly pulled out the ghost master of ceremonies' immortal body.The headless immortal body screamed from its body, \"How dare a mortal!How dare a mortal!Get up!Get up!Kill them!Kill them \u2014 \u2014!! \"The originally featureless golden boy and jade girl suddenly lit up with a pair of blood-red eyes. Hundreds of them screeched as they pounced towards Mo Ran and Chu Wanning.The coffins on the ground also shattered. The corpses lying inside stood up and rushed towards the two like a tide.Mo Ran's gaze quickly swept through the crowd to find Shi Mei's figure.Chu Wanning shouted, \"Why are you looking at those zombies so affectionately!Why aren't you taking them down! \"The two of them and the ghost master of ceremonies had already been sent flying and stood on top of a coffin. The slow moving corpses slowly gathered around them. Mo Ran raised his hand and lit up an exorcism talisman. He threw it in all directions and detonated it.However, there were too many ghosts. As soon as one wave went down, another wave quickly came over.Mo Ran was about to go crazy, \"So many people died in this Rainbow Butterfly Town?How many ghost married couples are there?!! \"Chu Wanning angrily said, \"Look at this ghost master of ceremonies' cultivation. How many young men and women died of natural causes?!It's very likely that he's also tempted those unmarried people to commit suicide!Hit this side! \"Mo Ran threw another exorcism talisman at the direction Chu Wanning indicated. It exploded into white bones and flesh.\"Why isn't this ghost master of ceremonies killed?\"\"Normal weapons can't hurt him.\"\"What about Tianwen?\"Chu Wanning was furious, \"Didn't you see that Tianwen was chasing after him?!This ghost master of ceremonies is very fast. If I let go of him, I'm afraid he'll escape before I hit him again! \"More and more corpses piled up. Mo Ran drove them away while paying attention to whether or not Shi Mei was in the crowd. He didn't want to accidentally injure him.A golden boy pounced over and fiercely bit his leg. He cursed and threw an exorcism talisman at the golden boy's face. He then kicked it into the crowd of corpses, causing it to explode.Chu Wanning said, \"Do you see Shi Mei and Madam Chen?\"Mo Ran was frantically searching for them when he suddenly saw two swaying figures in the distance. He happily said, \"I see them!\"\"Get over there and pull them apart!Stay away from here! \"\"Okay!\" Mo Ran replied. He was stunned, \"What are you going to do?\"Chu Wanning angrily said, \"I can't raise my other arm, so I can't summon other weapons. I can only rely on Tianwen.When I release this ghost master of ceremonies, I'll destroy this whole place. If you don't want to die, you better get out of here! \"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHeaven's Inquisition had a killer move that had no blind spots. The name was very simple, with only one word, \"Wind\".Once activated, the surrounding area would be completely annihilated.Mo Ran had naturally experienced the power of \"Wind\". He was also clear about Chu Wanning's strength, so there was no need to worry. Thus, he glanced at the pale man in the blood-red wedding dress and threw away the last few Exorcism Talismans to buy some time for Chu Wanning. Then, he flew to the periphery, holding Shi Mei in one hand and Madam Chen in the other. Together with the two unconscious people, he hid in the distance.Chu Wanning endured the pain and barely moved his other hand. In an instant, Heaven's Inquisition burst out with a dazzling golden light. Chu Wanning suddenly pulled Heaven's Inquisition back.The ghost master broke free of his control and jumped up, pouncing towards Chu Wanning with a distorted face.Chu Wanning's robe was like a flame in the wind, billowing and dancing. His sharp eyebrows were raised in anger, and half of his shoulder was soaked in blood. Suddenly, he raised his hand, and Heaven's Inquisition's golden light became even sharper. Then, Chu Wanning raised it and flew into the air.The willow vine suddenly extended dozens of feet, dancing into a golden wind. Like a whirlpool, it sucked in the surrounding ghosts, corpses, golden boys and jade girls, and even the ghost master who was screaming and twisting, into the center of the \"Wind\". They were all crushed by the Heaven's Inquisition's swift and fierce power!!!The \"Wind\" destroyed everything in its path. The surrounding plants were uprooted, and were not spared.With Chu Wanning as the center, a huge storm emitted a dazzling golden light. For a moment, the sky darkened, and the sand and stones flew everywhere.Whether it was the coffin or the dead, they all became grass fluttering in the wind.Sucked in and cut by the rapidly spinning Heaven's Inquisition.Broken into thousands of pieces \u2026 \u2026When everything calmed down, Chu Wanning's surroundings were already barren, and it was desolate and empty.Except for him, standing alone in his brightly colored wedding dress, like a red lotus blooming and begonia flowers falling, there was only a ground full of crushed bones and the terrifying \"Heaven's Inquisition\" that was hissing and flowing with golden light.From the looks of it, Chu Wanning was very polite when choosing disciples.If he wanted to, it was not impossible for him to turn all the disciples of the Good and Evil Platform into ashes in an instant \u2026The golden light gradually faded.Heaven's Inquisition turned into countless star fragments and entered Chu Wanning's palm.He took a deep breath and frowned. Enduring the pain in his shoulder, he slowly walked toward his disciples in the distance.\"How is Shi Mei?\"Chu Wanning asked as he walked up to them.Mo Ran lowered his head to look at the unconscious beauty in his arms. She was still unconscious, her breathing was very weak, and her cheeks were ice-cold to the touch.This scene was too familiar. It was the nightmare that Mo Ran could not escape from.Back then, Shi Mei had laid in his arms like this. Gradually, he stopped breathing \u2026Chu Wanning bent down and checked Mrs. Chen and Shi Mei's carotid arteries. He couldn't help but say in a low voice, \"Hmm?How could he be poisoned so deeply? \"Mo Ran abruptly raised his head, \"Poisoned?Didn't you say that they were fine?Didn't you say that they were just bewitched? \"Chu Wanning frowned, \"The ghost emcee relied on the powder to bewitch people. That is a kind of poison.I thought that they were just lightly poisoned, but I didn't expect them to be so deeply poisoned. \"\"\u2026 \u2026\"\"Send them back to the Chen residence first.\" Chu Wanning said, \"It's not difficult to remove the poison. It's good that they are not dead.\"His voice was cold and indifferent. Although Chu Wanning usually spoke like this, at this moment, it sounded like he was playing it down and did not care much.Mo Ran suddenly remembered the heavy snow that year. He knelt in the snow, and in his arms was Shi Mei who was slowly losing his life.His face was full of tears, and he begged Chu Wanning to turn around and look at his disciple. He begged Chu Wanning to lift his hand and save his disciple's life.But what did Chu Wanning say at that time?He also used such an indifferent tone, such an indifferent tone.Just like that, he refused Mo Ran's one and only kneel to beg for help in his life.In the heavy snow, the person in his arms gradually became as cold as the snow that fell on his shoulders and brows.That day, Chu Wanning personally killed two of his disciples.One was Shi Mingjing, whom he could have saved, but did not.The other was Mo Weiyu, who knelt in the snow and was more sorrowful than a dead heart.A sense of panic suddenly rose in his heart. A sense of brutality, a sense of unwillingness, viciousness, and violence flowed like a snake.For a moment, he suddenly wanted to grab Chu Wanning by the neck, shed all of his amiable disguise, and reveal the malevolence of an evil ghost. As a ghost from his previous life, he wanted to viciously bite him, question him, and demand his life.Demand the lives of those two helpless disciples in the snow.But when he looked up, his eyes suddenly fell on Chu Wanning's shoulder that was full of blood.The beast's angry roar was suddenly blocked.He did not make a sound, and only stared at Chu Wanning's face. His eyes were almost filled with hatred, but Chu Wanning did not see it.After a while, he lowered his head and stared at Shi Mei's haggard face.His mind gradually went blank.If something happened to Shi Mei this time, then \u2026\"Cough, cough, cough!!\"The person in his arms suddenly coughed rapidly.Mo Ran was startled, and his heart trembled \u2026 Shi Mei slowly opened his eyes, his voice was extremely hoarse and weak.\"A \u2026 ran \u2026?\"\"Yes!I am! \"After the ecstasy, the haze disappeared. Mo Ran opened his eyes wide, his palm on Shi Mei's slightly cold cheek, the light in his eyes trembling. \"Shi Mei, how do you feel?Do you feel unwell anywhere? \"Shi Mei smiled gently, his eyes still gentle. He turned his head and looked around. \"\u2026 Why are we here \u2026 Why did I faint \u2026 Ah!Master \u2026 cough, your disciple is useless \u2026 your disciple \u2026 \"Chu Wanning said, \"Don't talk.\"He put a pill into Shi Mei's mouth. \"Since you're awake, keep this poison in your mouth first. Don't swallow it directly.\"Shi Mei put the pill into his mouth, and suddenly froze. His originally pale face became even more transparent. \"Master, how did you get hurt?There's blood all over your body \u2026 \"Chu Wanning still had that kind of indifferent, calm, and infuriating voice. \"I'm fine.\"He got up and glanced at Mo Ran.\"You, think of a way to bring both of them back to the Chen residence.\"Shi Mei woke up, and Mo Ran's gloominess was suddenly suppressed. He quickly nodded. \"Okay!\"\"I'll take my leave first. I have something to ask the Chen family.\"Chu Wanning turned and left. Facing the boundless night and the withered grass all around him, he finally couldn't help but frown, revealing a pained expression.His entire shoulder was pierced through by five fingers, and his tendons and veins were torn. The ghost master's spirit claws even pierced deep into his flesh and bones.No matter how much he pretended to be calm and endured, no matter how much he sealed his blood vessels and prevented himself from fainting from blood loss, he was still human.But it still hurts \u2026.But so what if it hurt?He walked forward step by step, the hem of his wedding dress fluttering in the wind.For so many years, people respected and feared him, but no one dared to stand by his side. No one cared about him.He had long since gotten used to it.Wanye Yuheng, the Northern Dipper Immortal.No one liked him from head to toe. No one cared about life, death, illness, or pain.He seemed to have been born without the support of others, without any support, and without any companionship.So there was no need to shout in pain, and even less of a need to cry.When he returned, he would bandage his wounds, cut off the festering flesh, and apply some medicine.It didn't matter if no one cared about him.In any case, he had come here alone.For so many years, he had been fine.He could take care of himself.When he arrived at the door of the Chen Family's house, he heard a heart-wrenching scream before he entered the courtyard.Chu Wanning didn't care about his wounds and immediately rushed in. He saw Mrs. Chen with disheveled hair and closed eyes, chasing her son and husband all over the hall. Only the youngest daughter of the Chen Family was ignored. She stood aside in fear, curled up, and couldn't stop trembling.Seeing Chu Wanning come in, Lord Chen and his youngest son screamed and rushed to him, \"Taoist priest!Taoist priest, help! \"Chu Wanning blocked them behind him, glanced at Mrs. Chen's closed eyes, and said angrily, \"Didn't I ask you to watch her and not let her sleep?\"\"We couldn't watch her!My wife's health is not good, so she usually goes to bed early. After you left, she was still holding on, but then she started to doze off, and then she started to go crazy!She was yelling \u2026 yelling \u2026 \"Lord Chen shrank behind Chu Wanning and trembled. He didn't notice that the Taoist priest was wearing a auspicious robe, and he didn't notice the hideous wound on Chu Wanning's shoulder.Chu Wanning frowned, \"What are you yelling about?\"Before Councilor Chen could say anything, the crazy woman rushed over with her teeth bared. She screamed in a shrill voice. It was actually the voice of a young woman.\"Heartless!Heartless!I want you to pay with your lives!I want all of you to die! \"Chu Wanning said, \"\u2026 Evil Ghost Possession.\" He turned to Lord Chen and said, \"Are you familiar with this voice?\"Lord Chen's lips trembled, his eyes rolled, and he swallowed nervously, \"I don't know, I don't know, I don't know!Taoist priest, help!Taoist priest, kill the evil spirit! \"At this time, Madam Chen had already rushed over. Chu Wanning raised his uninjured arm and pointed at Madam Chen. A thunderbolt struck down and trapped Madam Chen in the wizardry barrier.Chu Wanning turned back and looked at him coldly, \"You really don't know?\"Lord Chen said repeatedly, \"I really don't know!I really don't know! \"Chu Wanning didn't say anything more. He threw out Heaven's Inquisition and tied up Madam Chen in the wizardry barrier.He should have tied up Lord Chen, which would be more convenient and easier to interrogate. However, Chu Wanning had his own rules. His Heaven's Inquisition wouldn't easily interrogate ordinary people.So he gave up on the soft persimmon and went to interrogate the evil ghost in Madam Chen's body.Interrogating a ghost was different from interrogating a person.When Heaven's Inquisition interrogated a person, the person wouldn't be able to stand it and would speak.When Heaven's Inquisition interrogated a ghost, it would form a wizardry barrier where only Chu Wanning and the ghost could coexist. In the wizardry barrier, the ghost would revert to its appearance when it was alive and pass the information to Chu Wanning.Heaven's Inquisition suddenly ignited a flame. It went straight from his end to Madam Chen's end along the vine.The Old Madame let out a shriek and suddenly began to convulse. Immediately after, the scarlet flame on the willow vine turned into a ghostly blue, burning from the Old Madame's side to Chu Wanning's.Chu Wanning closed his eyes. The fire followed the willow vine all the way to his palm. However, the will-o '-the-wisp couldn't hurt him. It continued to follow his arm to his chest, and then it was extinguished.\"\u2026\"The Chen family looked at the scene in front of them in horror. They didn't know what Chu Wanning was doing.Chu Wanning's eyelashes trembled slightly. His eyes were still closed, but a white light gradually appeared in front of him.Then, he saw a small foot as white as jade step out of the light. A girl about seventeen or eighteen years old appeared in his vision.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She looked like a young married woman. She rubbed her eyes blankly in the darkness and looked around.\"Where \u2026 am I?\"Chu Wanning said, \"You're in the Realm of Truth that I've set up.\"The young girl was shocked and asked in panic, \"Who are you?Why is it so dark here? I can't see you. Who's talking? \"Chu Wanning said, \"Have you forgotten?\u2026 You're already dead. \"The young girl's eyes widened, \"I'm already \u2026 I \u2026\"Slowly, she remembered.She lowered her head and crossed her arms in front of her chest. There was no sign of movement. She muttered softly and murmured, \"I \u2026 I'm already dead \u2026\"\"Only souls can enter the Realm of Truth. Here, hatred and hatred will be eliminated. The dead, regardless of whether they become an evil ghost or an ordinary ghost, will retain their personality and appearance from when they were alive. This is called 'Truth'.\"The young girl was stunned for a moment, as though she was gradually recalling her past. Then, she suddenly lowered her head and wept silently.Chu Wanning asked, \"You \u2026 do you have any grievances?\"The young girl sobbed, \"Are you the King of Hell?Or the White Impermanence?Are you here to redress my grievances? \"Chu Wanning facepalmed, \"\u2026 I'm not the King of Hell, nor am I the White Impermanence.\"The young girl sobbed softly.Chu Wanning was silent for a moment. He waited for her to calm down a little before saying, \"But I'm here to redress your grievances.\"When the young girl heard this, she looked up with a mixture of joy and sorrow, \"Then you really are the King of Hell!\"\"\u2026\" Chu Wanning decided not to continue this topic with her. Instead, he asked, \"Do you know what you did after you died?\"\"I don't know \u2026 I'm not very clear. I only remember that I was very sad, very sad.I wanted to take revenge \u2026 I wanted to find them \u2026 and I wanted to find him again \u2026 \"When one's soul had just been awakened, there were many things that could not be recalled, but it did not matter. Chu Wanning patiently asked her, \"Who are you looking for?\"The girl said softly, \"My husband, Chen Bohuan.\"Chu Wanning shivered. Chen Bohuan \u2014 wasn't that the name of the eldest son of the Chen family?He asked, \"You \u2026 what's your name?Where are you from? \"With Heaven's Inquisition's power poured into this illusory barrier, almost all the undead who came here would talk to Chu Wanning honestly.The girl replied, \"I am Luo Xianxian, from Colorful Butterfly Town.\"\"Before I came here, I looked through the files of Colorful Butterfly Town. This town has a total of more than five hundred families, but there is no Luo Family.Who is your father? \"The young girl slowly recalled all the details, and the grief in her eyes deepened. \"My father was a scholar in the village. He was a close friend of my father-in-law. A few years ago, he died of tuberculosis. After that, I was the only one left in the family.\"\"Then why did you die?\"The girl was stunned for a moment, and then she sobbed, \"I had no other choice but to die.They, they cheated me of the secret formula of the perfume powder left by my father. They beat me, scolded me, and threatened me to leave Colorful Butterfly Town.I \u2026 I am a weak woman, where else can I go?I don't have a single relative in this world \u2026 The world is so big, where can I go?Apart from the Yellow Springs and the Underworld, is there anywhere else that can accommodate me? \"After she recalled what happened before her death, there seemed to be infinite pain and sadness in her heart, and she was eager to talk to someone. Even when Chu Wanning didn't ask her again, she slowly told the story by herself.It turned out that Luo Xianxian lost her mother when she was young. According to her father, she had an older brother, but her older brother was separated from them in the chaos of the lower cultivation world. After that, she never saw him again, and didn't know whether he was dead or alive.When her older brother was lost, Luo Xianxian was not yet a year old, and she was still in her swaddling clothes. Later, she tried to recall her older brother, but she still had no impression of him.Only Luo Xianxian and her father were left in the Luo Family. The father and daughter depended on each other and drifted around. Finally, they built a small house in Colorful Butterfly Town and lived there.That year, Luo Xianxian was five years old.The eldest son of the Chen Family, Chen Bohuan, was two years older than her.At that time, the Chen Family was not rich yet, and several people in the family lived in a two-bedroom mud hut. There was an orange tree by the low wall of the small courtyard, and it was full of fruit in autumn. The lush branches grew over the low wall and reached the yard of the Luo Family.Luo Xianxian looked up, and the tangerines on the branches were like lanterns in the Lantern Festival. She was shy and introverted, so she didn't play with others. She always held a small stool and peeled edamame by herself. From time to time, she would look up and look at the tangerines in the yard of the Chen Family.The tangerines were yellow and very attractive. Against the sunlight, they reminded people of the sweet and sour juices.Luo Xianxian looked at them eagerly, swallowing from time to time, and her cheeks were sore.But she didn't reach out to pick the tangerines. Her father was a scholar who couldn't keep up with his younger brother. He lost the exam, but he didn't lose his backbone. The scholar's brain was probably broken, and he always told his daughter to be a \"gentleman\".Luo Xianxian knew at the age of three that she couldn't be blinded by wealth, and couldn't be moved by poverty.Although she coveted the tangerines, she never reached out to pick the tangerines that were close to her.One night, under the moonlight, Luo Xianxian was washing clothes in the yard, huffing and puffing.Her father was not strong, so he went to bed early. Poor children learned early. The little girl rolled up her sleeves, immersed her thin arms in the wooden bucket, and rubbed seriously with her face puffed up.Suddenly, there was a hoarse cough at the door, and a young man covered in blood staggered in and stared at her.The little girl was so scared that she even forgot to scream.The young man's face was dirty and bloody, but he was very handsome. The two of them were in a stalemate for a long time. Finally, the young man couldn't stand it anymore, and sat down slowly against the wall. He gasped and said in a hoarse voice, \"Give me some water.\"Maybe it was because the young man didn't look like a bad guy, or maybe it was because Luo Xianxian was kind. Although she was scared, she still ran back to the house, got a cup of tea, and handed it to the young man.The young man didn't hesitate, and drank it all. After drinking, he wiped the corner of his mouth, opened his eyes, and stared at Luo Xianxian's pretty face. His eyes were a bit blank, and he didn't speak for a long time.He didn't speak, and Luo Xianxian didn't speak either. She just blinked her eyes timidly, and kept a safe distance from him. She held her hands and looked at the stranger.\"\u2026 You look like an old friend of mine.\"The young man suddenly opened his mouth, narrowed his eyes, and smiled gloomily. With the blood on his face, he looked really ferocious. \"Especially your eyes, they are round, and they make people want to dig them out, stick them on their fingers, and swallow them one by one.\"The horrible words were said so calmly by him, and even with a smile. Luo Xianxian trembled even more, and subconsciously covered her eyes.The young man said, \"Oh, you're smart, girl. Just cover your eyes, and don't stare at me.I can't control my hands. \"He spoke with a curly tongue and a northern accent.The moonlight shone in the yard. The young man licked his chapped lips, and suddenly saw the orange tree in the yard.For some reason, his eyes lit up, and there was a light in his eyes. The light was bright for a while, and then dim for a while. Then he raised his chin and said.\"Girl.\"Luo Xianxian, \"\u2026\"\"Pick an orange and peel it for me.\"Luo Xianxian finally spoke. Her voice was thin and trembling, but she didn't hesitate. \"Big brother, this is not my fruit tree, it's someone else's. You can't pick it.\"The young man was stunned, and then his face slowly darkened as he thought of something.\"I said you can pick it, so you can pick it. I want to eat the orange, so you pick it for me!\" The last sentence was so vicious that it sounded like it was crushed through his teeth and then spat out.Luo Xianxian trembled in fear, but still stood there stubbornly.The little girl was gentle, but deep down, she was the same as her rotten father.\"I won't.\"The young man suddenly narrowed his eyes and arched his nose. His expression changed. \"Stinky girl, do you know who you're talking to?!\"\"If you want to drink water, I, I'll pour it for you. If you want to eat, there's still food at home. But the orange tree isn't mine, so I can't pluck it. Dad said that taking something without asking is considered stealing. I'm a gentleman. I want riches and honor, but I can't be lustful.In her nervousness, she blurted out the word 'fish'. The half-grown little girl blushed and insisted on what her father had taught her. She stuttered and finally blurted out the entire sentence. However, under the gaze of the young man, she was already trembling uncontrollably and her legs were shaking.The young man was speechless.If it wasn't for the inappropriate timing, he would have heard such a little fellow, a little girl, say, \"Taking without asking is stealing\", \"Riches and honor cannot be corrupted, and poverty cannot be moved\", and \u2026 and \"I am a gentleman\"??Pu, he really couldn't help but laugh out loud.But he couldn't bring himself to laugh.On the contrary, there was a kind of intense resentment that soared to the heavens in his chest, driving Ma Pengteng, crushing his heart.\"I hate people like you the most, the so-called \u2026\" He supported himself against the wall and stood up shakily. He squeezed out two words from his lips. \"Good people, gentlemen, heroes, and benevolent people.\"Under the horrified gaze of Luo Xianxian, he slowly moved his injured leg to the orange tree. He raised his head and almost greedily inhaled the scent of the orange tree. Then, a red light of hatred suddenly burst out from the bottom of his eyes. Before Luo Xianxian could react, he grabbed the tree and shook it violently. He kicked, kicked, and hit it.All the oranges on the branch fell to the ground and rolled to one side. The young man's smile was twisted, and he shouted without restraint, \"What a good 'taking without asking is called stealing,' what a good 'riches cannot be corrupted'!Might and honor cannot be subdued! \"\"Big brother!What are you doing!Stop it now!Dad!Dad! \"Luo Xianxian didn't want to call him dad at first. Her dad was a weak scholar who couldn't help much even if he came out.But she was a little girl after all. Finally, she was scared and broke down.\"What are you shouting for?If your dad comes out, I'll cut him too! \"The little girl was scared out of her wits. There were tears in her round eyes.The Chen family next door went to visit relatives in the neighboring village. The whole family was not there, so no one stopped the little crazy.Little Madman shook off all the oranges on the ground, but it was still not enough to vent his anger. He stomped on the ground a few times, crushing several fruits. Suddenly, with a sudden burst of strength, he jumped up and flipped over to the Chen family's courtyard. He found an axe and chopped down the entire tree in a few moves.Then he flipped back and laughed.Suddenly, he stopped laughing. He squatted on the ground and stared blankly.He suddenly turned his head and waved to Luo Xianxian. \"Girl, come here.\"\"\u2026\" Luo Xianxian didn't move. She stood there, her small cloth shoes embroidered with yellow flowers on the ground.The young man saw that she was hesitating, so he softened his tone and said as kindly as possible, \"Come here.I have something good for you. \"\"I \u2026 I don't want \u2026 No, I don't want to \u2026\" Luo Xianxian said in a low voice. Before she finished, the young man suddenly became fierce again.\"If you don't come, I'll go inside and chop your dad up!\"Luo Xianxian shuddered and finally moved towards him in small steps.The young man squinted at her. \"Hurry up. I don't have time to watch you dance.\"When Luo Xianxian was still a few steps away from him with her head lowered, he suddenly reached out and pulled her over. Luo Xianxian let out a scream, but the scream was violently blocked by something in her throat.The young man put an orange into her mouth. He didn't peel it or scrub it. He just put it in her mouth with mud.How could Luo Xianxian eat an orange in one bite? The young man tried to force it into her mouth, and the orange cracked and rotted. Half of her face was smeared with the pulp of the fruit. However, the lunatic was still grinning, crushing the fruit in her face and stuffing it into her mouth that she was trying to close.\"Aren't you a gentleman?You don't eat stolen food, right?Then what are you eating now?Huh?What are you eating now?! \"\"Oh \u2026 No \u2026 I don't want \u2026 Daddy \u2026 Daddy \u2026\"\"Swallow it.\"The young man narrowed his eyes and put the last bit of fruit into Luo Xianxian's mouth. His eyes were shining, and he shuddered. \"Swallow it!\"She watched as Luo Xianxian was forced to swallow the orange and called out \"Daddy\" in a choked voice.The young man was silent for a while, and suddenly smiled.That smile was more terrible than his ferocious face.He touched Luo Xianxian's hair with satisfaction, squatted there, and said gently, \"Why are you calling me daddy?Shouldn't you call me big brother?Is the orange I gave you sweet? Is it delicious? \"Then he picked up another one from the ground.This time, he did not force it into her mouth. He carefully peeled the orange peel and cleaned the sticky white strands little by little. Then, he wiped his hands, broke off a piece, and brought it to Luo Xianxian's lips. He said softly, \"If you like it, eat some more.\"Luo Xianxian knew that she had met a mentally deranged person today. She had no choice but to lower her head and silently eat the orange handed to her by the lunatic. The sweet and sour juice melted in her throat, and her stomach churned \u2026The young man squatted there and fed her the orange piece by piece. Suddenly, he seemed to be in a good mood and even began to hum a song.His voice was rough and hoarse, like a broken wind basket. She couldn't hear him clearly, and only a few words floated into Luo Xianxian's ears.\"Three or four petals fall in the pond, one or two strings ring on the shore. It's best to be young and weak, to see the end of the world \u2026\"He suddenly said, \"Little girl.\"\"\u2026\"\"Tsk.\" He curled his lips and held Luo Xianxian's little face. \"Let me see your eyes.\"Luo Xianxian's hair trembled, and she couldn't resist. She could only let the young man look at her carefully. His bloody fingers touched her eyelids inch by inch.\"You really look like them.\" He said.Luo Xianxian closed her eyes, sobbing.She was really afraid that this lunatic would pluck off her two ears on a whim like plucking fruits.But the young man didn't pick them.He just said to her coldly, \"Didn't you teach me that I can't be corrupted by wealth and I can't be moved by poverty?Big brother also has something to say to you. \"\"Wu \u2026\"\"Open your eyes.\"Luo Xianxian closed her eyes tightly.The young man laughed and said hoarsely, \"I'm not going to pick your eyes, open them!\"\"\u2026 Do you think I can't pick your eyes if you don't open them?\"Luo Xianxian had no choice but to open her round eyes. Her long eyelashes trembled, and large drops of tears flowed down her cheeks. She didn't know how the frightened and pitiful expression on her face pleased this young man of unknown origin. He suddenly let go of the hand that was pinching her cheek. His hand hung in the air, and then he gently patted her head.He stared into her eyes, and a trembling smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. His smile was seven parts twisted, two parts ferocious, and one part sad.He said, \"There are men in Linyi, but their hearts are dead.\"After that, he turned around and disappeared into the darkness.Only the mess on the ground showed that such a person had been here in the middle of the night, covered in blood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe next morning, the Chens came back from a visit and saw that the orange tree in the yard had fallen and the oranges were all over the ground. There were not many other houses nearby, and only the Luo family lived close to them. Thinking of how Luo Xianxian looked at the oranges every day, the Chens were immediately sure \u2014The unlucky Luo Xianxian must have stolen the oranges!Not only did she steal the oranges, but she also cut down their orange tree out of jealousy!The Chens immediately complained to Luo Shusheng. Luo Shusheng couldn't stand such humiliation. He immediately called his daughter over and asked her angrily if she stole the oranges.Luo Xianxian cried and said no.He asked her again if she cut the tree.Luo Xianxian still said no.He asked her again if she ate the oranges.Luo Xianxian didn't know how to lie, so she said yes.Before she could explain, she was ordered to kneel down by her angry father. In front of the Chens, her father beat her with a ruler and said, \"An adopted daughter is worse than a man!How could you do such a thing at such a young age?What a joke!You disgraced your father!You have to face the wall for three days to reflect on yourself and turn over a new leaf \u2014 \"\"Dad, it wasn't me!It really wasn't me! \"\"How dare you talk back!\"No one believed her. Although the lower cultivation world was chaotic, the Colorful Butterfly Town was an exception. This town had always been simple and honest. They didn't close their doors at night. A crazy person covered in blood came in the middle of the night?Who would believe that?Luo Xianxian's small hands were beaten until the skin and flesh were broken.The few people from the Chen family looked on coldly. Only the oldest boy among them tugged at the corner of his mother's clothes, looking like he wanted to say something but stopped.His mother ignored him, and there was nothing he could do about it. His small face wrinkled, and he stood to the side, unwilling to continue watching.At night, Luo Xianxian didn't dare to go back to her room. She squatted under the eaves and stood as punishment.Her father was a scholar and couldn't tolerate stealing. He was also sour and stubborn. It was useless to talk to him because he didn't listen to her explanation.Luo Xianxian, who had been hungry all day, felt dizzy. Suddenly, someone called her in a low voice, \"Sister Luo.\"Luo Xianxian turned around and saw a well-defined head sticking out from the edge of the mud wall. It was the eldest son of the Chen family, Chen Bohuan, who had tried to help her during the day.Chen Bohuan looked left and right to make sure there was no one around, so he quickly flipped over the wall. He had a hot steamed bun in his arms, and without any explanation, he stuffed it into her hands.\"I see you've been standing under this wall all day and haven't eaten anything.Here's a steamed bun for you, eat it quickly. \"\"I \u2026\" Luo Xianxian was shy by nature. She had lived here for several months, but she hadn't talked much with her neighbor. Now that she suddenly looked at him so closely, she couldn't help but take two steps back and hit her head on the wall.But she still stuttered, \"I can't take it \u2026 Daddy won't let me \u2026 He said \u2026\"He was incoherent for a long time, unable to form a complete sentence.Chen Bohuan said, \"Aiya, your father only knows how to talk all day long. Why do you care so much about him?You'll get sick if you're hungry like this. Eat it, or it'll get cold. \"The steamed bun was white and tender, and it was very soft, with steam coming out.Luo Xianxian lowered her head and stared at it for a while, swallowing her saliva.He was really starving.She didn't care about being a gentleman. She grabbed the steamed bun, lowered her head, and ate it. After a while, she finished it.After eating, she raised her round eyes and said to Chen Bohuan, \"I didn't cut down the orange trees, and I didn't want to steal them.\"Chen Bohuan was stunned, and slowly smiled, \"Yes.\"\"But they don't believe me \u2026\" Under such a disdainful gaze, Luo Xianxian's heart slowly melted, and her grievances melted like ice. She cried, opened her mouth, and wiped her tears, \"They don't believe me \u2026 I didn't steal \u2026 I didn't steal \u2026\"Chen Bohuan patted her in a hurry, \"I know you didn't steal. Aiya, you stood under the tree every day and never took an orange. If you wanted to steal, you would have done it a long time ago \u2026\"\"It wasn't me!It wasn't me! \"She cried even harder, and snot and tears fell together.Chen Bohuan patted her, \"It wasn't you, it wasn't you.\"The two children became familiar with each other just like that.Later, there was a murder case in a neighboring village. It was said that a few nights ago, a blood-soaked bandit had entered a house and wanted to sleep in one of the rooms. The owner of the house did not agree, so the bandit stabbed the whole family to death. Then, in the house full of corpses, he slept leisurely and leisurely, and only left the next day in the morning.So what if he left? He even stained the wall with blood and wrote a long article about what he had done, as if he didn't want the world to not know about such a bad person.This news spread like wildfire, and soon, it spread to Colorful Butterfly Town.It was the night when Luo Xianxian said she met \"Crazy Big Brother\".Luo Shusheng and the Chen family were all speechless.After the misunderstanding was solved, the two families began to interact more frequently.The Chen couple saw that Luo Xianxian was very cute, a little beauty, and diligent and sensible. They thought that it would be difficult to find a better daughter-in-law with their family background, so they decided to arrange a marriage between Chen Bohuan and Luo Xianxian. When they reached marriageable age, they would officially hold a wedding banquet.Luo Shusheng saw that his daughter and Chen Bohuan were childhood sweethearts, so he gladly agreed.Days passed by. If it wasn't for Luo Shusheng's love for art and incense, the Chen and Luo families would have lived in poverty and peace like they had expected at the beginning.But the bad thing was that Luo Shusheng accidentally found \"Hundred Butterfly Incense Powder\".Although the smell of this powder was not special, and it was not much different from the ordinary spices in town, it had an advantage that ordinary spices couldn't have \u2014 \u2014It would linger for a hundred days, and its fragrance would never fade away.The fragrance of Hundred Butterfly Incense Powder lasted for a long time, and the fragrance did not dissipate easily. It was a good and cheap thing that ordinary people wanted.Luo Shusheng said, \"Everything is inferior, but studying is the best.\" Although he found the powder, he was not willing to sell it. He thought that it would \"lower his status.\"If he didn't sell it, there would naturally be others who wanted it.Mrs. Chen tried several times to get the recipe from Luo Shusheng and encourage him to open a shop, but she was rejected. After a few times, Mrs. Chen felt embarrassed and never mentioned it again. But in her heart, she firmly remembered this.When Luo Xianxian was ten years old, an opportunity came.Luo Shusheng, a sickly person, had tuberculosis. After struggling for a few days, he died.As Luo Xianxian's in-laws, although their daughter was not married yet, there was still friendship between them. So, she helped with the funeral and was busy.Luo Xianxian was grateful, but she didn't know that Mrs. Chen had secretly taken the recipe for the incense powder when she was packing up Luo Shusheng's belongings.That night, Mrs. Chen was full of excitement under a bean oil lamp. She went over to read the recipe with excitement.But after a glance, she was dumbfounded.Luo Shusheng's calligraphy was elegant and graceful. She stared at it for a long time, but couldn't understand a single word.She had no choice but to quietly put the recipe back.After a few months, when Luo Xianxian calmed down, she called her daughter to the house for dinner. In the chat, she \"accidentally\" mentioned the fragrance of butterflies.Luo Xianxian thought that it was useless to keep the recipe at home. Her mother-in-law was so good to her. If she wanted it, she would give it to her.So, she found her father's belongings and helped Mrs. Chen identify the words. Little by little, she sorted out the precise recipe.Mrs. Chen was wild with joy. After she got the recipe, she began to plan with her husband to open a shop.Of course, at that time, she still cherished this gentle and sensible daughter-in-law. Luo Xianxian was getting more and more beautiful. Although her family was unfortunate, her appearance was one in a hundred. Many young men in the town began to pay attention to her.A long night was fraught with problems. Mrs. Chen thought that she had to get this done quickly.However, Luo Xianxian had just lost her father. According to the custom of Colorful Butterfly Town, if one's parents died, one could not marry for three years.How could Mrs. Chen wait three years? She racked her brains and thought of a solution.One day, Luo Xianxian was braiding the hair of the little sister of the Chen family. The little girl was very close to her. All day long, Luo Xianxian would follow her around like a little tail.Mrs. Chen walked into the courtyard and called Luo Xianxian into the inner hall. She said to her, \"Xianxian, you and Bo Huan were childhood sweethearts. You were engaged to him. Now that your father is gone, you're all alone. It's not easy for you to live.Originally, you were supposed to marry into our family this year.But the rule of three years of mourning here is so tiring that you can't get married. Auntie was thinking, if you wait three years, how old will you be? \"Luo Xianxian lowered her head and didn't say anything. But she was smart enough to guess Mrs. Chen's next words. Her cheeks turned slightly red.Sure enough, Mrs. Chen continued.\"It's hard and tiring to live alone.How about this? You marry me first. We'll close the door and pray to Heaven and Earth. We won't tell outsiders first. If others ask, you can say that you are living with auntie so that we can take care of each other.This way, you will complete the ritual and won't be criticized. It will also make your old father feel at ease.When the three years are up, we will hold a grand wedding for you two. What do you think? \"Her words sounded like she was thinking for Luo Xianxian. Luo Xianxian was not a bad person. She didn't think badly of others, so she agreed.Later, the Chen family became rich by selling the Hundred Butterfly Fragrance Powder. They moved out of the old house and bought a large piece of land in town. They renovated the house and became a big family.Luo Xianxian became a person who hid in the shadows of the big family and rarely showed herself.People in town thought that Luo Xianxian was living in the Chen family because of Mrs. Chen's kindness. They didn't know that she and Chen Bohuan were married.Although she felt wronged, Luo Xianxian only thought that her mother-in-law was doing this for her own good. So she didn't complain.Plus, Chen Bohuan was sincere to her, so the couple lived a happy life. After three years, everything would return to normal.However, Luo Xianxian didn't get married officially.The Chen family's business was getting bigger and bigger. Plus, Chen Bohuan was handsome. Not only in Colorful Butterfly Town, but also in several other towns, the daughters of the big families started to have ideas about Young Master Chen.After a while, Mrs. Chen's mind became active.She set up this marriage because she thought that she couldn't find a good wife in a peasant family. So she was anxious to tie Luo Xianxian down.Who would have thought that the Chen family would one day prosper? At this time, when she looked back at Luo Xianxian again, she felt that this girl was not good-looking enough. She was not smart enough. She was as dumb as her dead-headed father. No matter how she looked at her, she did not like her.She regretted it a little.But the appearance of Miss Yao changed her \"a little\" to \"a lot\".Miss Yao is the daughter of the county magistrate. She loves military attire. One day, she was riding a horse on her way back from hunting. When she passed by a fragrance powder shop, she picked out a few fragrant powders. Who would have thought that instead of the fragrance powder, she saw a handsome young man who was busy in the hall.That young man was none other than Luo Xianxian's husband, Chen Bohuan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She kept pestering her father to ask about Chen Bohuan.Although Chen Bohuan was married, it was done behind closed doors. Who in the surrounding villages knew about it?Even the engagement between the Luo family and the Chen family was not clear about it.So Miss Yao learned that Childe Chen was not married yet.After a few rounds of observation, the county magistrate felt that Xiao Chen was capable, had a gentle temperament, and had a good family background. Thus, he sent someone to talk to the Chen couple about the marriage.Lord Chen regretted it so much. They told the county magistrate that they needed to think about it first. After closing the door, the two old men started to quarrel.Lord Chen said, \"Why are you so anxious?That poor scholar died early. His daughter was supposed to mourn for him for three years. If you didn't let them get married first, it's not too late for our son to regret it now!Look at what happened! \"Mrs. Chen was also anxious, \"Blame me?Weren't you the one who wanted to arrange the engagement?Now it's the county magistrate's daughter!How can Luo Xianxian compare to her? \"Behind closed doors, the two old bastards argued until their faces and ears turned red. In the end, they had no energy left and were panting heavily across the table.Lord Chen asked, \"What should we do?Let's ask the county magistrate to go back. \"Mrs. Chen said, \"\u2026 We can't.Our Chen family is counting on Miss Yao to make a fortune. \"Lord Chen said angrily, \"Can Miss Yao be a concubine?Can she?Our son already has one in his room. How can we get her in?Look at how lovey-dovey those two are! \"\"\u2026\" Mrs. Chen didn't say anything. After a while, her eyes suddenly lit up and she murmured, \"Old Chen, I'm thinking about it. No one knows about Luo Xianxian and our son except for the people in our family \u2026\"After a few moments of silence, Squire Chen was stunned for a while. He immediately understood his wife's intention.He was trembling, half out of fear, half out of excitement.\"You, you mean \u2026\"\"If no one knows, it's not a marriage.\" Mrs. Chen said, \"Let's find a way to drive her away. If the soft approach doesn't work, we'll use the hard approach.Everybody knows that our son is unmarried. Do you remember how she stole oranges when she was little?As long as all of us bite the bullet, even if she has seventeen or eighteen mouths, she won't be able to defend herself! \"Squire Chen strode to the door and made sure that the door was closed. Then he hurried over. The two who had been quarreling like fighting cocks a moment ago were now huddled together and discussing in low voices.Chen Yuanwai said, \"I'm afraid your idea won't work.\"\"What happened?\"\"Our son won't agree.He's been in love with Luo Xianxian since he was young. How could he agree to turn against her? \"Madam Chen thought for a while, then patted her husband's hand and said, \"Don't worry, leave it to me.\"After a while, Madam Chen suddenly fell seriously ill. Her illness was very strange. The doctor could not figure out the cause, but she was crazy all day long. Her mouth was full of nonsense, and she kept saying that she was possessed by a ghost.Squire Chen was very anxious. He invited a Taoist priest, who carried a horsetail whisk. He calculated with his fingers and said that the Chen family had something against Madam Chen. If it was not solved, Madam Chen would not live to see the end of the year.Chen Bohuan was very filial. He was very anxious and asked, \"What is against my mother?\"The Taoist priest pretended to be mysterious for a long time and said that it was a \"hidden beauty\".Everyone in the room was stunned. The sons of the Chen family all turned to look at Luo Xianxian who was standing on the side.Luo Xianxian was also stunned.In fact, she had been told many times since she was a child. She was born to be a jinx, and she killed her mother, then her brother, and then her father.Now, she was pointed at and said that she was going to kill her mother-in-law.The people of the Chen Family were anxious. Several brothers took turns to persuade her to leave the Chen Family. After all, no one outside knew that she was married and had a clean reputation. They would give her money and let her find another good family.Luo Xianxian was anxious and scared. She was really worried that she was the jinx of Madam Chen. She cried all day long.Chen Bohuan was heartbroken. He saw that his mother was getting more and more haggard. He was in a dilemma. He did not want Luo Xianxian to leave, but he could not bear to see his mother suffer.She lost a lot of weight quickly.The brothers of the Chen family could not accept it. One day, when their boss was not around, they went to find their sister-in-law.Luo Xianxian was mixing the Hundred Butterfly Powder in the greenhouse. They rushed up and knocked over her utensils. The powder fell all over her. The strong smell seemed to have seeped into her bones and couldn't be washed away.The brothers surrounded her and said a lot of principles, such as \"wife's virtue\" and \"wife and daughter are inferior, parents are superior\". But Luo Xianxian was very tough. Although she was timid, she was very stubborn. She cried and said that she did not want to leave. She begged them to think of another way.The second son of the Chen family was anxious. He went to her and slapped her. He said to her, \"Our mother is going to die because of you. If there is another way, will your father die?Will your mother die?Will your brother's life be uncertain? \"As soon as he slapped her, the others rushed to her. They surrounded Luo Xianxian and beat her. They shouted, \"Get out of here\", \"Jinx\", \"Jinx\".These sons were of the same mind as their mother. In fact, they knew their mother's idea. At this time, when their boss was not around, they drove Luo Xianxian out of the house. They threatened her that if she dared to come back, they would beat her every day. Anyway, she did not have a family. Even if she was beaten to death, no one would speak for her.It was a big snowy night.Luo Xianxian was thrown into the snow with bruises all over her body. One of her embroidered shoes fell off.She crawled forward slowly. Her mouth made unclear sobs, like the low howl of a cub before its death.It was late at night. On such a snowy day, few people would go out. She crawled in the vast world. She did not know where she was going. She did not know where she could go.The brothers of the Chen family were right.She did not have a family. She did not have a father. She did not have a brother. No one could stand up for her. No one could take her in.In this vast world of white, there was no place for her to stay.Her body was not strong. When she was thrown out, she was wearing thin clothes. She shivered in the cold. Soon her legs and feet became numb. She could not feel anything.She crawled all the way to the outskirts of the city. She came to the temple where the ghost master of ceremonies was enshrined. She curled up in the temple to hide from the snow. Her lips were blue and purple from the cold. Her heart was even more sad.She looked up at the clay statue with bright red makeup. She could not stop her tears from rolling down her face.She remembered the rules of the lower cultivation world. When a couple got married, they should have a master of ceremonies as witness.But at that time, she just had a red flower in her hair. She smiled sweetly and kowtowed to Chen Bohuan.Was this closed-door marriage really just a dream? Was the picturesque beauty in the bronze mirror that day really just the sound of greed in the depths of her drunken dream?She knelt in front of the ghost master of ceremonies. She dragged her body that was getting heavier and colder. She knelt three times and kowtowed nine times. She cried and laughed.\"Married as husband and wife, loving each other without doubt.Pleasure \u2026 on \u2026 this evening \u2026 \"She gradually felt dizzy. Her vision was getting blurry.There seemed to be a thin layer of moonlight in front of her. In the small courtyard in the past, she cried and said, \"I didn't steal it. I didn't steal it. I didn't steal the oranges.\"However, rumors were a fearful thing. No one would believe her one-sided story.Today, she knew that even if she went to someone and cried, saying that she was really Chen Bohuan's first wife, there would definitely be no one who would believe her. She was still that little girl by the mud wall, who had nowhere to redress her grievances.Nothing had changed.But there was someone who climbed over the wall and put a steaming white steamed bun into her palm. He said to her, \"You must be hungry. Eat a steamed bun to fill your stomach.\"But now \u2026 that person, where was he \u2026He came back and couldn't find her. Would he be anxious? Or would he be relieved that her mother would finally not be cursed by her again?Luo Xianxian curled up in the mud temple. Her tears gradually dried up. She whispered, \"Empress of the ceremony, I want to be with him.I am his first wife \u2026 When we went through the ceremony, there was no empress beside us. You are a ghost empress. You can't control a living person. But I \u2026 I can only \u2026 only tell you \u2026 \"She sobbed and made the last sound in her throat, \"I'm not lying \u2026\"I'm not lying.The snow was silent. The long night was silent.The next day, the townsfolk passing by the mud temple in the suburbs found Luo Xianxian's cold body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She wished she could immediately remove the willow vines and whip the Chen couple.But he couldn't open his eyes to curse. Once he did, the Pure Reality Illusion would disappear. The Pure Reality Enchantment could only lock a ghost once. If it was interrupted, he wouldn't be able to hear what Luo Xianxian said next.Therefore, he could only suppress his anger and continue to listen to Luo Xianxian.After she died, her soul entered the netherworld first. She was muddle-headed and unconscious.The only impression she had was a woman wearing red and green clothes. She looked like the ghost master worshiped in the temple. The ghost master stood in front of her and asked her gently, \"You and Chen Bohuan can't sleep in the same bed when you are alive, but do you want to sleep in the same cave when you die?\"She answered in panic, \"I do \u2026 I do!\"\"Then let him come to accompany you immediately, okay?\"Luo Xianxian almost blurted out. She was about to say yes, but she suddenly remembered something. She was stunned, \"Am I dead?\"\"Yes.I am the ghost master of the netherworld. I can grant you a good match and fulfill your long-cherished wish. \"Luo Xianxian was stunned, \"Then if he comes to accompany me, will he \u2026 die too?\"\"Yes.But if the heavens have feelings, death is nothing. It's just a close of eyes. What's the difference? \"When Chu Wanning heard this, she thought to herself, Sure enough, this ghost master would lure others into making a wish for their lives. This immortal was truly an evil immortal.Although Luo Xianxian died unjustly, she didn't turn into a ferocious ghost. She shook her head, \"No, we can't kill him. It's not his fault.\"The ghost master smiled sadly, \"What do you get for being so kind?\"It didn't force Luo Xianxian. As an immortal, it was okay to lure others to make a wish, but not to force them. Its figure gradually faded and its voice became more and more vague.\"Soul Return in Seven Days. When you return to the world of the living on the first seven days, go and see the Chens. After that, I will ask you again. See if you still have no regrets.\"Seven days later, the Soul Return Day arrived.Luo Xianxian's soul returned to the world of the living.She followed the old road and went to the Chens with an anxious heart. She wanted to see her husband one last time.Who would have thought that the interior of the Chen Residence would be decorated with lanterns and colored banners, while outside the courtyard, there would be fire-trees and silver flowers.Betrothal gifts filled the parlor, with a large 'Xi' character pasted in front of the hall. Madame Chen's face was glowing, without the slightest sign of illness. She was instructing the servants with a smile on her face, instructing them to decorate the betrothal gifts with flowers and drape them with red silk.Who \u2026 is holding a wedding?Who \u2026 was the one who wanted to give a betrothal gift?Who was it \u2026 Three matchmakers and six betrothal gifts? How glorious!Who was it \u2026She shuttled through the bustling crowd, listening to the sounds of people in the mortal world.\"Congratulations, Madam Chen. Your son is engaged to the daughter of County Magistrate Yao.When is the banquet? \"\"Mrs. Chen is truly blessed.\"\"Miss Yao is indeed the Chen family's lucky star. Madam Chen, you look much better now that you've just gotten engaged.\"\"Your son and Miss Yao are a match made in heaven. I'm so envious, hahahaha.\"Your son \u2026 your son \u2026Which man is it?Who was going to marry the daughter of the Yao family?She frantically shuttled back and forth in the familiar front yard, searching for that familiar figure amidst the laughter and clamor.And then, she found him.Chen Bohuan stood with his hands behind his back in front of the peonies in the back hall. His face was haggard, and his cheeks were sunken.However, he was dressed in red. Although it wasn't a wedding dress, it was the custom of Colorful Butterfly Town. When a prospective son-in-law came to propose a marriage, he should wear the red butterfly dress.He \u2026 was going to propose a marriage \u2026?The entire hall of betrothal gifts, gold, silver, pearls, and jewels, were all prepared by him \u2026 by Chen Bohuan, her husband, for the daughter of the Yao family?She suddenly remembered the time when they got married.Apart from the two of them and a heart, they had nothing.There was no master of ceremonies, no betrothal gifts.At that time, the Chen family wasn't rich. They didn't even have a decent set of jewelry. He went to the courtyard and plucked a delicate orange flower under an orange tree that was planted by the two of them. He carefully put it in her hair.She asked him, \"Does it look good?\"He said it looked good. After a moment of silence, he sadly stroked her hair and said to her, \"It's just that you're wronged.\"Luo Xianxian smiled and pursed her lips, saying it's okay.Chen Bohuan told her that when he married her in three years' time, he would definitely hold a lively wedding banquet. He would invite people from all over the place, use a large palanquin with eight carriers to welcome her, dress her up with gold and silver, and fill the entire reception hall with betrothal gifts.The promise from that year was still in her ears. Now, the flowers were blooming and the moon was full.The person he was going to marry was someone else.A monstrous anger and sorrow surged. Luo Xianxian screamed in the room, tearing the red silk brocade that filled the room.But she was a ghost. She didn't touch anything.Chen Bohuan vaguely seemed to sense something. He turned around and stared blankly at the moving silk. His eyes were blank and empty.His little sister walked over. There was a white jade hairpin in her hair bun. He didn't know who she was secretly wearing it for.She said, \"Big brother, go to the kitchen.Go to the kitchen and eat something. You haven't had a proper meal in days.We have to hurry to the county magistrate's house to propose a marriage.Your body can't take it like this. \"Chen Bohuan suddenly asked without thinking: \"Little sister.Did you hear someone crying? \"\"\u2026 \u2026 What?No, big brother, I think you're too \u2026 \u2026 \"She gritted her teeth and didn't say anything.Chen Bohuan still stared at the place where the silk curtain fluttered.\"How is mother now? Are you happy?Is she better? \"\"\u2026 \u2026 Big brother.\"\"\u2026 \u2026 She's better, she's better.\"Chen Bohuan stood there for a while and muttered to himself, \"I don't have Xianxian anymore. I can't lose mother too.\"\"Big brother, let's go eat \u2026 \u2026\"Luo Xianxian cried, shouted, held her head and wailed.Don't \u2026 \u2026 Don't go \u2026 \u2026 Don't go \u2026 \u2026Chen Bohuan said: \"\u2026 \u2026 Okay.\"The tired figure disappeared around the corner.Luo Xianxian stood there alone in a daze. Big drops of transparent tears rolled down her cheeks.Suddenly, she heard the brothers of the Chen family who killed her. The second brother whispered to the youngest brother.\"Mother is so happy this time. Alas, finally a stone fell to the ground.\"\"Isn't it?She pretended to be sick for more than half a year and finally drove that jinx away.How can she not be happy? \"The youngest brother clicked his tongue twice and suddenly said: \"Why did she die?We dared to let her go, but we didn't want to kill her. Why was she so stupid? Didn't she know to ask someone for help? \"\"Who knows? She's thin-skinned, just like her sour father.She can't blame us for her death. Although we pretended to be sick to earn her, we have our own difficulties.Think about it. Between the county magistrate's daughter and the poor girl, who would be a fool to choose her?Besides, if we offend Miss Yao, we'll be in trouble. \"\"That's right. She was stupid. She didn't want to live and wanted to freeze to death. No one can save her.\"These words floated into her ears.After Luo Xianxian died, she finally understood the so-called \"jinx\". It was just because she was poor and humble, she couldn't be compared to the county magistrate's daughter.Only a fool would choose a poor girl.She finally went crazy.Filled with resentment and hatred, she returned to the Master of Ceremonies Temple.She died there, and she returned there. She died weak and helpless, but she returned full of resentment.She used to be such a kind person, but at this time, she used up all the hatred in her life and the evil in her human nature that had never been released. She screamed at the top of her lungs, her eyes were red, and her soul was shaking.She said: \"Luo Xianxian is willing to give up her soul and become a malicious spirit. I only ask the Master of Ceremonies Empress to avenge me!I want the Chen family to die a horrible death!!!I want her \u2026 I want my evil mother-in-law to kill her son with her own hands!All her sons!!!I want Chen Bohuan to accompany me in hell!!To be buried with me!!!I'm not satisfied!!I hate!I hate!!! \"The eyes of the clay statue on the altar closed, and the corners of its mouth slowly raised.An empty voice echoed in the temple.\"I accept you as my believer. As you wish, you will become a malicious spirit \u2014 kill \u2014 hateful person \u2014\"A blood-red light flashed, and Luo Xianxian could no longer remember what happened after that.However, Chu Wanning already knew that after that, the Master of Ceremonies Ghost controlled Luo Xianxian to possess Mrs. Chen and kill the Chen family one by one.The reason why Chen Bohuan was dug out of the red coffin on the top of the mountain was naturally because the Master of Ceremonies Ghost had fulfilled Luo Xianxian's long-cherished wish \u2014 to \"bury Chen Bohuan with me.\"Moreover, it deliberately placed the coffin at the base of Chen Bohuan and his new wife's house. It was the most vicious curse and revenge.As for the fragrance in Chen Bohuan's coffin, it was the smell of the Hundred Butterfly Powder on Luo Xianxian's body before she died.The resentment and fragrance in the coffin were extremely strong because Luo Xianxian's soul was sleeping with Chen Bohuan in it.Luo Xianxian had no family. According to the customs, when such a person died, their bones should be cremated instead of buried. Therefore, she did not have a physical body. She could only transform in the Master of Ceremonies Ghost's coffin.At that time, Chu Wanning opened the coffin with a vine whip. Luo Xianxian lost the protection of the coffin and her soul scattered. It was difficult for her to reunite temporarily.That was why the resentment was strong before the coffin was opened, but weak after the coffin was opened.But at that time in the illusion, why did Chen Bohuan only have a paper ghost bride when everyone else had a corpse as their spouse?Chu Wanning thought for a while and figured it out.The Master of Ceremonies Ghost would not break its promise. The paper bride was the \"physical body\" it made for Luo Xianxian, or a carrier. Only Luo Xianxian could be buried with Chen Bohuan.Everything was clear now.Chu Wanning looked at the weak and helpless girl in the illusion. He wanted to say something, but he could not say anything.Elder Yu Heng was too clumsy. His words were always stiff, so after a long silence, he still did not say anything.The girl stood in the boundless darkness, her soft and bright round eyes wide open.Chu Wanning looked into her eyes. Suddenly, he could not bear to look at her anymore. He wanted to leave. He did not want to look at her anymore.He was about to open his eyes and leave this enchantment.The girl suddenly spoke.\"Brother Yama.I, I have something to tell you. \"Chu Wanning: \"\u2026 Yes.\"The girl suddenly lowered her head, covered her eyes, and cried. She said softly, \"Brother Yama, I don't know what I did after that.But, I \u2026 I really did not want to kill my husband.I did not want to be a malicious ghost.I really \u2026 \"\"I did not steal oranges. I am really Chen Bohuan's wife. In this life, I really, really did not want to hurt anyone.\"\"I really did not want to hurt anyone. I beg you, believe me.\"Her voice was choked, trembling, and broken.\"I \u2026 did not \u2026 lie \u2026\"I did not lie.Why is it that in this life, almost no one has ever believed me.She sobbed. Chu Wanning's voice sounded in the darkness.He did not say much, but he did not hesitate.\"Yes.\"Luo Xianxian's thin body shook.Chu Wanning said, \"I believe you.\"Luo Xianxian wiped her tears with her hands, but she could not help it. In the end, she covered her tear-stained face, lowered her head, and bowed deeply in the darkness where she could not see.Chu Wanning opened his eyes again.After he opened his eyes, he did not speak for a long time.The time in the enchantment was different from the time in the real world. He had been inside for a long time, but to the people outside, it was just a blink of an eye. Mo Ran had not returned yet. The few people of the Chen family who were still alive were still looking at him.Chu Wanning suddenly put away the willow vine and said to Old Madam Chen, \"I will redress your grievances. Go to sleep.\"Old Madam Chen stared blankly with her blood-red eyes. Suddenly, she fell to the ground with a thump and fainted.Chu Wanning raised his head again. His eyes first swept over Minister Chen's face, then fell on Yaozi. There was no fluctuation in his voice, and it was still very cold.\"I will ask you one last time.\"His lips moved slowly as he enunciated each word clearly. \"Did you really not recognize who that voice belonged to?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After a while, he said firmly, \"I \u2026 I don't know.I don't recognize it! \"Chu Wanning's face was like nine feet of frost. He said in a low voice, \"Liar.\"His appearance was very fierce. At this moment, he lowered his eyebrows and looked more murderous. He was even more frightening than a ghost.Chen Yuanwai couldn't help but take two steps back. Chu Wanning suddenly hit the Heaven's Inquisition on the ground. In an instant, sparks flew and leaves flew.Chen Yuanwai was so shocked that he fell to the ground.\"Is the Hundred Butterfly Powder made by your family?Is this your eldest son's first marriage?Who is Luo Xianxian?You're already so old. Don't you have any shame?! \"Chen Yuanwai opened and closed his mouth. In the end, he couldn't say a word. Gradually, his face turned from pale to red.The youngest daughter of the Chen family, who had been huddling in the side, suddenly burst into tears when she heard the name \"Luo Xianxian\".She rushed over and knelt in front of her mother. She touched the unconscious body, \"Sister Luo!Sister Luo, is this all because of you?I know you don't want to leave, but please, for my sake, please let our family go \u2026 Sister Luo \u2026 \"Chu Wanning bent down and held the golden Heaven's Inquisition. He used the vine handle to lift Chen Yuanwai's face.This was Chu Wanning's psychological obsession. He wouldn't touch the people he thought were disgusting.He would get goosebumps as soon as he touched them.\"Do you think I don't know who is lying to me?\"He stared at Chen Yuanwai's face coldly. He saw his own face in those frightened eyes.Sure enough, he was so unlikable. So cold and mean, like a blade covered with frost.But so what?Wanye Yuheng never needed other people's love.\"Daoist Priest, Daoist Priest, you are a person at the pinnacle of life and death. I am your client, how can you steal my private matter, I \u2026\"Chu Wanning said, \"Fine, I won't do anything.Just wait for your death. \"\"No!No, no, no!You can't \u2014 \"\"I can't?\" Chu Wanning narrowed his eyes, the luster flowing in his phoenix eyes was very dangerous. \"I can't what?\"\"I am \u2026 you are \u2026 you \u2026\"\"A person like you, if you were a disciple of my sect \u2026\"Chu Wanning stroked Heaven's Inquisition and said in a low voice, \"Today, I will whip you until your skin is split open and your bones broken.\"At this point, Squire Chen could no longer pretend to be innocent. Seeing that Chu Wanning was so fierce, he couldn't help but feel weak in his legs. He didn't care about his face anymore. He knelt down with a thud and cried, \"Taoist priest, we, we have no choice. We can't afford to offend the county magistrate's daughter!We, we can't eat or sleep well. Taoist priest \u2014 \"As he spoke, he was about to hit Chu Wanning's leg.Chu Wanning was a clean freak. Seeing that Squire Chen was about to touch him, he didn't think and hit him with the willow vine. He said in disgust, \"Don't touch me!\"\"Ah!\"Being hit by Heaven's Inquisition, Squire Chen cried in pain even though he didn't inject any spiritual energy into his hand. He shouted, \"There is no justice. A Taoist priest at the peak of life and death is beating an ordinary person!\"\"You \u2014!\"When Mo Ran helped the two injured people into the house, he saw Squire Chen kneeling on the ground with tears and snot. He pointed at Chu Wanning with trembling hands and shouted, \"Which sect does this?You people at the peak of life and death took the commission and didn't protect the client. You, you even beat him. This is really, really \u2014 shameless!I, I want to tell the world!I want to publicize it!I, I want to let everyone know your \u2026 your attitude!I want to ruin your reputation and make you unable to earn a single copper coin! \"Chu Wanning said angrily, \"So what if we have money?Can we turn black and white upside down? Can we repay kindness with ingratitude?Can we do whatever we want with money? Can we break our promise? \"The youngest son of the Chen family said timidly, \"We didn't kill Luo Xianxian. We just hit her lightly and kicked her out of the house. She didn't want to live. She didn't even find a place to hide in the snow. How can we be blamed for that?We didn't kill anyone. Even if you're an immortal, you can't just blame us like that. \"His words were extremely sharp. According to the law, the Chen family had not done anything that was out of line. Even if Chu Waning sent them to the court, the yamen would at most blame the Chen family for being fickle and untrustworthy, but they would not be able to convict any of them.\"I didn't kill Bo Ren, but Bo Ren died because of me.You guys are really innocent. \"Chu Wanning's hand that was holding onto Liu Teng was trembling slightly because of her anger.Chen Yuanwai was old and cunning. He had recovered from the initial panic.He was worried that Chu Wanning would leave them alone before the evil ghosts were completely eliminated. But on second thought, this fierce Taoist was sent by the Peak of Life and Death.The Peak of Life and Death was the biggest sect in the Lower Cultivation World. Since they had accepted the commission, the Taoist must complete the task.This was a well-known fact in the world.After thinking this through, he was not so scared anymore.He held his hoof, which had a small cut, and cried until his nose was full of snot and tears, \"Clean it?Our Chen family has never done anything evil. We didn't kill anyone or set a fire. Luo Xianxian didn't want to live. How can you blame us for it?You, if you don't get rid of this evil ghost today, I'll report you to the Peak of Life and Death!How can you be like this?You take people's money and you have to eliminate them. You don't even understand this, and you \u2026 \"Before he finished, Chu Wanning took his money bag and threw it in front of Chen Yuanwai without blinking, \"The sect took your money, and I'll return it to you today.As for the report, you can report it if you want! \"Tianwen's light shone and the willow leaves were like knives.Chen Yuanwai was caught off guard. He screamed and ran away with his hands covering his head. In a panic, he even pulled his little daughter to block the willow vines for him.Fortunately, Chu Wanning was used to slapping people and Tianwen was one with his mind. He immediately stopped and avoided the little daughter of the Chen family. Then he turned around and slashed horizontally at Chen Yuanwai's face. In an instant, blood splashed everywhere and screams shook the sky.Chen Yuanwai didn't expect that Chu Wanning didn't fall for his trick at all. His previous aggressive manner turned into a pile of mud. He ran away in fear and shouted, \"Stop!Stop fighting!Taoist!What I said was all nonsense!It was nonsense!Ah!Taoist, please spare my life!Oh, please, I'm old, I can't stand it anymore!Taoist, please be merciful. It's our Chen family's fault!It's our Chen family's fault! \"How could Chu Wanning listen to him? He choked on his anger. His phoenix eyes flashed fiercely as he danced with the Heaven's Will, leaving afterimages everywhere. He beat Lord Chen until he was rolling on the ground in pain. His tears and snot flowed freely.Mo Ran, who was standing at the door, was stunned, \"\u2026\"This was the first time he had seen Chu Wan-ning use Heaven's Inquisition to beat ordinary people. Moreover, she did not hold back at all. Her posture was as if she was beating livestock. She swung the vine so hard that it almost turned into a shadow.How could this be?The client actually hit the client. Regardless of whether it was in the Upper Cultivation World or the Lower Cultivation World, this matter was enough to sweep that Immortal's reputation to the ground. No matter how fierce Chu Wanning's temper was, no matter how impulsive she was, she wouldn't make such a big mistake, right?This was even more serious than his \"crime of theft and sexual intercourse\".Shi Mei was also scared pale. He pulled Mo Ran and said, \"Quick, go and stop Shizun!\"Mo Ran handed the unconscious Chen Yaoshi, who was the daughter of the Yao family, to Shi Mei. He went forward and grabbed Chu Wanning's wrist. He was shocked and anxious, \"Shizun \u2014 you \u2014 what are you doing?\"Chu Wanning was angry. He raised his eyebrows and shouted, \"Let go.\"\"Shizun, you're breaking the commandments \u2014\"\"Do I need you to say that?Do you think I don't know the 750 commandments of the Peak of Life and Death better than you?Let go! \"Mo Ran raised his voice, \"Then why are you hitting him?\"Chu Wanning didn't want to waste time with him. He suddenly swung his sleeve and whipped Chen Yuanwai with another vine.\"Shizun!!\"Chu Wanning shouted angrily in a low voice, \"Get lost!\"Seeing this, Chen Yuanwai felt that Mo Ran was handsome and amiable. He must be a good person. He quickly crawled over and hid behind Mo Ran. He grabbed Mo Ran's sleeve and said, \"Taoist priest, please talk to your Shizun. I, I'm an old man. Even if I did something wrong, I can't take this kind of beating \u2026\"Who would have thought that when Mo Ran turned his head, he would see his face full of tears and snot. This guy did not pity him at all. Instead, he felt disgusted. He quickly moved away and said with disdain, \"Don't touch me.\"\"\u2026\" Seeing that this person was unreliable, Lord Chen's gaze shifted to Shi Mei, who was helping Chen Yaoshi sit down on the armchair.He held onto his last ray of hope and crawled over to Shi Mei. As he crawled, he cried loudly.\"Taoist priest, Taoist priest, please have mercy. I know I did something wrong. It's my fault. I beg you, please help me talk to your Shizun. I know I did something wrong. I \u2026 I \u2026 I'll do whatever you want me to do. Just don't hit me anymore. I'm old, my body can't take it anymore \u2026 I can't take it anymore \u2026\"He cried sadly. He wanted to live, so naturally, he was very sincere.He crawled over to Shi Mei and reached out to grab Shi Mei's sleeve.\"\u2026\" Shi Mei saw how pitiful he was and looked up at Chu Wanning, \"Shizun, since the old man knows he did something wrong, please be merciful and let him go.\"Chu Wanning said, \"Get out of my way.\"Shi Mei, \"\u2026\"Chu Wanning said sternly, \"You still won't move?!\"Shi Mei was so scared that he trembled and moved out of the way.With a whoosh, the Heaven's Wrath cut through the air and went straight for Chen Yuanwai's head. Chen Yuanwai covered his head with his hands and screamed at the top of his lungs.His scream was so shrill that Shi Mei, who was standing beside him, couldn't help but move back and block the Heaven's Wrath for Chen Yuanwai.Swoosh!Shi Mei dodged too quickly. Chu Wanning wanted to stop, but it was too late.Blood splattered everywhere. Shi Mei's body was very weak. After being hit by the Heaven's Wrath, he suddenly knelt on the ground and covered his fair and tender cheek. The blood couldn't stop flowing and flowed through the gaps between his fingers \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFor a moment, no one in the hall spoke. Only the sound of Minister Chen's sobbing could be heard.Shi Mei lowered his head and covered his cheek. When he looked up at Chu Wanning, his eyes were full of sincerity. \"Shizun, please don't hit me anymore.If you continue to hit me like this, I will be the one to bear the responsibility \u2026 \"Mo Ran was scared out of his wits. Although he was a bastard, he was stubborn and infatuated with Shi Mei. In this life, he swore to himself that he would cherish and protect Shi Mei.But in just a few days, Shi Mei was seriously injured and injured by the willow vines. What the hell was going on!He didn't have time to settle accounts with Chu Wanning. He hurried to Shi Mei's side and checked the wound on his face.Shi Mei said softly, \"I'm fine \u2026\"\"Let me see.\"\"I'm really fine.\"Even though he resisted, Mo Ran pulled down his hand that was covering the wound.His pupils suddenly shrank.There was a deep and hideous wound. His skin and flesh were exposed. Blood kept flowing out until it reached his neck \u2026Mo Ran's eyes couldn't help but turn red. He bit his lip and stared for a long time. Suddenly, he turned to Chu Wanning and shouted angrily, \"Are you done?\"Chu Wanning's face was gloomy. He didn't say anything. He didn't apologize and didn't come forward. He stood straight in the same place, still holding Heaven's Inquisition in his hand.\"\u2026 \u2026\"Mo Ran seemed to have countless demons and monsters crazily gathering in his heart.Who could bear to see his sweetheart who died once in his previous life being wronged again and again?He and Chu Wanning just stared at each other like that. Neither of them gave in, neither of them gave in. Mo Ran's eyes gradually became bloodshot. He hated Chu Wanning for so many years, so why did this man in front of him always go against him?When he first entered the sect, Chu Wanning beat him to death when he did something wrong.Later on, when Shi Mei was injured, Chu Wanning, who only had three apprentices in his life, stood aside and refused to help.Later on, Shi Mei died and the Life-Death Summit was destroyed. Mo Weiyu became the unparalleled overlord of the Cultivation World. Who in the mortal world would not submit to him?Chu Wanning was the only one who stood against him, destroying his great cause and stabbing his conscience. Chu Wanning constantly reminded him that no matter how powerful the Emperor Ta was, he was just a lunatic who had been betrayed by his friends and family.Chu Wanning.Chu Wanning \u2026In life and in death, it had always been him!The two of them were still wearing matching auspicious clothes. Red clothes against red clothes, standing far away. There seemed to be a deep ravine between them that could not be filled.In the end, Chu Wanning withdrew his Heaven's Inquisition.Chen Yuanwai was greatly relieved. He knelt in front of Shi Mei and kept kowtowing. \"Bodhisattva, Bodhisattva, Immortal, you are a living Bodhisattva who saves people. Thank you, Immortal, for saving my family. Thank you, Immortal, thank you.\"It was always like this.He was the one who put down the evil spirit, but he was also the one who whipped the poisonous chili willow vine.Chu Wanning did his job and broke the strict rules. In the end, the Bodhisattva was someone else, and he was the bad guy.It was always like this.He had a bad temper, and he admitted it.He did not regret it.It was just that he missed the vine whip and whipped his apprentice. He was still upset, but he was shy and did not want to say anything gently. He walked on his own and came to the little girl of the Chen family.When the little girl saw him, she couldn't help but take two steps back in fright, trembling.She was the only one in the Chen family who was kind.Chu Wanning said softly, \"Your mother was possessed by an evil spirit and lost more than 20 years of her life. If she still does not repent and has evil thoughts, she will be haunted by Yin Qi in the future. I am afraid that she will die even earlier.When she wakes up, ask her to use mahogany to make a memorial tablet for Miss Luo. The tablet must acknowledge Miss Luo's identity.Luo Xianxian is Chen Bohuan's legal wife. You have hidden the truth for many years, so you should also announce it and fulfill her lifelong wish. \"After a pause, he passed a letter and said,\"In addition, your family must kneel three times a day and kowtow nine times and recite the 'Deliverance Spell'. Only then can you release Miss Luo and send away the evil spirit that haunts your family.This spell needs to be recited for ten years without stopping. If it is stopped halfway, Miss Luo will still come back for revenge. \"The little girl said in a trembling voice, \"\u2026 Yes, thank, thank you Taoist priest \u2026\"Chu Wan Ning suddenly turned around. Her gaze was as sharp as a knife. She glanced at the youngest son of the Chen family and Lord Chen and sternly said, \"When Chen Yaoshi wakes up, the two of you must tell her everything you have hidden. She can decide whether to stay or leave. If you hide anything, I will cut off your tongues!\"The two of them were cowards, they did not dare to say no. They kowtowed and promised.\"As for the Hundred Butterfly Powder, this was made by Luo Shusheng, but you shamelessly said that it was your own recipe.You know what to do, I don't need to say more. \"Chu Wanning said and flicked his sleeves.\"We, we will go to the shop and tell the villagers that this powder is Mr \u2026 Mr Luo's \u2026\"After everything was arranged, Chu Wanning asked Mo Ran to help Chen Yaoshi back to her room. He then gave her a blood transfusion to detoxify her.Mo Ran was full of hatred, but he knew that when he was young, he respected his master more than he disobeyed him. So he did not say anything. He held Shi Mei's hand and whispered, \"Go take a look at your face and stop the bleeding.I will help her to her room. \"In the Chen family's eldest son's room, there was still a big red \"Double Happiness\" sign. In the chaos, he forgot to take it down.Now that Chen Bohuan had been turned into powder, it was ironic.Chen Yaoshi had become the victim of greed in this ridiculous farce. Who knows what choice she will make when she wakes up?Her body is not as strong as Shi Mei's, she is still a normal person. Chu Wanning quietly gave her a blood transfusion and fed her a pill.During this process, Mo Ran was at the side serving her water and a handkerchief. The two did not speak, nor did they look at each other.When they left, Chu Wanning inadvertently glanced at the wall. His eyes moved, but he suddenly realized something. He turned back and stared at the words hanging on the wall.It was a few lines of regular script. The ink was not long ago, the edges of the paper were not yellowed.What was written was \u2014 \u2014Red hand, yellow vine wine, the city full of spring, palace walls willow.The east wind is evil, love is thin.A cup of melancholy, years of separation.Wrong, wrong, wrong.Spring is the same as before, the person is empty and thin, the tear stains are red and transparent.Peach blossoms fall, Leisure Pond Pavilion, although the mountain alliance is there, the brocade book is difficult to hold.Mo, Mo, Mo.Chu Wanning's heart suddenly felt stifled. The regular script was written neatly and properly. The three words Chen Bohuan were incomparably glaring.The Young Master Chen who married the daughter of the Yao family against his will. The sorrow in his heart was indescribable. In the last days of his life, he could only stand by the window and copy the poem \"Hairpin Phoenix\"?He did not want to stay in the Chen residence any longer. He endured the pain in his shoulder and turned to leave.Chu Wanning and Shi Mei were both injured, so they could not immediately ride their horses back to the peak of life and death. Chu Wanning especially did not like to ride his sword, so he went to find an inn in town to rest. The next day, he could also go to the Ghost Master Temple to see how the funeral was going.Although those ghostly corpses were crushed into powder by Chu Wanning's \"wind\", the only thing that was destroyed was the corpses controlled by the Ghost Master Temple. Their souls were not damaged. It would be good to stay for a few more days to see if there were any fish that escaped the net.Chu Wanning silently walked in front, while his two disciples followed behind him.Shi Mei suddenly thought of something and asked, \"Mo Ran, the clothes that you and Shizun are wearing \u2026 what \u2026 is going on?\"Mo Ran was stunned. Only then did he remember that he and Chu Wanning were still wearing the wedding robes. He was afraid that Shi Mei would misunderstand, so he quickly took them off.\"This \u2026 is actually the illusion from before. Don't think too much, I \u2026\"Halfway through his words, he looked again and suddenly found that because Shi Mei also participated in the ghost master's ghost marriage, he was also wearing a robe, but the style was not the same as theirs.In addition, it was worn and tattered, so it was hard to see its original appearance.But in any case, it was still a wedding robe.Standing side by side with Shi Mei, he could also imagine holding Shi Mei's hand, bowing to heaven and earth in the Ghost Master Temple's illusion, and drinking wine.For a moment, he could not bear to take them off.He could only stare blankly at Shi Mei.Shi Mei warmly said with a smile, \"What's wrong?You didn't say anything. \"Mo Ran muttered, \"\u2026 Nothing.\"Chu Wanning was a few steps away in front of them. It was unknown how much of their conversation he had heard, but at this time he stopped and turned around.The first glimmer of dawn had already appeared in the sky. After a night of ups and downs, the twilight faded away, and a glimmer of dawn suddenly appeared on the horizon. The bright red rising sun was like a broken and bleeding heart, struggling out of the abyss of the dark night, revealing a touch of gorgeous splendor.Chu Wanning stood against the light, standing at the end of the long night that was getting brighter and brighter, standing in the midst of the rising sun that filled the sky.His wedding robes were as red as blood, standing sideways. The rising sun painted a blurry golden line on the side of his face, making it impossible to see the expression on his face.Suddenly, with a burst of spiritual power, the wedding robes were shattered by a strong force.The fine red cloth was like the red petals of a fallen begonia flower, suddenly blown by the wind, scattering everywhere.The wedding robes were torn, revealing the white robes underneath, billowing in the wind, together with his ink-black hair.The blood on his shoulder.The tattered robes in the wind.The mottled bloodstains from protecting Mo Ran were particularly bright and dazzling on the white robes.After a long time, Chu Wanning laughed coldly, rather mockingly, \"Mo Weiyu, between you and me, what is there to be misunderstood?\"When he was angry, he would call Mo Ran Mo Weiyu, cold and polite, not emitting any heat.Mo Ran was caught off guard and was rendered speechless by his words.Chu Wanning finished laughing, flicked his sleeves and left.At this time, there was no one around. He walked alone in front, as if the world was hazy and he was the only one.As soon as he arrived at the inn and closed the door behind him, he could no longer hold back his mocking expression.Chu Wanning gritted his teeth, a painful expression on his face, and raised his hand to touch his shoulder.The ghost master's claws were of the immortal body, not to be outdone by Heaven's Inquisition, they were both extremely powerful weapons. His entire shoulder was torn, but because he was in a hurry to kill the evil, he did not treat it in time. At this time, it was already infected and festering, the pain was unbearable.Standing in the room and taking a breath, Chu Wanning wanted to take off the robes on his body, but the blood on his shoulder had already coagulated, the robes and flesh stuck together, it was very painful when he pulled.Next door was Mo Ran's room, this inn's soundproofing was not good, he did not want to let people know, biting his lips, he actually tore off the robes stuck to his flesh!\"Ugh \u2026!!\"After a muffled groan, Chu Wanning slowly opened his mouth, his lips and teeth were full of blood, he gasped for breath, there was no color on his face, cold sweat all over.Lowering his slender and thick eyelashes, he trembled slightly, looking at his injury.Fortunately.It was still manageable \u2026He held the table and slowly sat down.Enduring the pain, he asked the waiter to bring him water and a handkerchief, he used his uninjured hand to wipe his wound bit by bit.The sharp knife cut in, cutting off the rotten flesh.Then, he applied the wound medicine made by Madam Wang.Then, slowly, with difficulty, he wrapped himself in gauze.He was not used to showing weakness in front of others.He had experienced this kind of pain many times, and each time, he endured it alone.If animals were injured, they would hide and lick their wounds. Sometimes, he felt that he was the same as those animals.In the future, he would probably continue to be alone like this.He knew that he was not likable, so he did not want to ask for help from others pitifully.He had his inexplicable stubborn dignity.But when he took off his clothes, a brocade pouch fell on the floor.Red satin embroidery. He slowly opened it with his trembling fingers, inside were two tangled strands of black hair.It was his and Mo Ran's.Chu Wanning was absent-minded for a moment.He wanted to put the brocade pouch in front of the candlelight, and burn it together with the ridiculous knot of hair.But in the end, he could not do it.Tied hair as husband and wife, loving each other without doubt.The soft laughter of the golden boy and girl seemed to ring in his ears again.He knew that there was some kind of throbbing in the depths of his heart, and because of this, he hated himself even more. He held the soft brocade pouch tightly in his hand, and slowly closed his eyes.He could not accept the thoughts he always had for Mo Ran, he wished that he could dig out his own heart, cut off those dirty thoughts, and throw them away.What did he do?Mo Weiyu, was he someone he should be thinking about?How could he be someone's master like that?He was worse than a beast!\"Dong dong dong.\"Suddenly, there was a knock on the door. Chu Wanning, who was condemning himself, was startled. He suddenly opened his eyes, and quickly put the brocade pouch in his wide sleeve. He pulled a handsome face, and said unhappily.\"Who is it?\"\"\u2026 \u2026 Shizun, it's me.\"Mo Ran's voice came from outside, making Chu Wanning's heart beat faster. \"Open the door.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChu Wanning's words were stuck in his throat. He was silent for a long time with a gloomy face. In the end, he slowly changed his words to, \"Get in here.\"\"Huh?You didn't lock the door? \"They had been in a cold war for an entire day. At this moment, Mo Ran was determined to make up with him. He pushed the door open and walked in as if nothing had happened.Chu Wanning sat at the table with an expressionless face. He raised his eyelids and glanced at him indifferently.In all fairness, Mo Ran was very good-looking. The moment he walked in, the whole room lit up.He was indeed very young. His skin was tight and seemed to emit a faint glow. The curve of his mouth was naturally slightly curly. Even when he was emotionless, he seemed to be smiling.Chu Wanning calmly shifted her gaze away from Mo Ran. Her long eyelashes drooped as she extinguished a stick of incense on the table. Then, she asked coldly, \"What's the matter?\"What are you doing here?\"\"I'm here to \u2026 take a look at your wounds.\"Mo Ran lightly coughed a few times. His gaze fell on Chu Wanning's shoulder, and he was slightly stunned. \"It's already changed?\"Chu Wanning said indifferently, \"Yes.\"Mo Ran was speechless.He did bear a grudge against Chu Wanning and was also angry that Chu Wanning had injured Shi Mei.But after calming down, Mo Ran wasn't completely heartless. Hatred was hatred, but he didn't forget how Chu Wanning's shoulder was injured.In that suffocating coffin, it was Chu Wanning who was tightly hugging himself. He used his own body to block the sharp claws of the ghost master. He was in so much pain that his entire body was trembling, but he didn't let go \u2026Mo Ran loathed Chu Wanning.However, other than disgust, for some reason, there were also some very complicated emotions mixed in.He was a boorish person. He didn't study when he was young. Although he learned some literature later on, he still couldn't understand many delicate things, especially when it came to relationships.For example, regarding Chu Wanning, Mo Ran scratched his head and pondered for a long time. The back of his head was about to go bald, but he still couldn't figure out what this feeling was.He could only recognize one emotion: like, dislike, hatred, pleasure, displeasure.If he mixed all these emotions together, the wise and mighty Emperor Ta would see stars and become completely dizzy.I don't understand, I don't understand, I don't know. Help, my head hurts.Therefore, Mo Ran was too lazy to think about it anymore. After all, he didn't have the time to study anyone other than Shi Mei.In his heart, he secretly recorded a bad debt with Chu Wanning. On the one hand, he secretly planned that if there was a chance in the future, he would definitely pay back double. On the other hand, he felt guilty and conflicted. In the end, he still knocked on Chu Wanning's door.He didn't want to owe Chu Wanning anything.But this person, Chu Wanning, was even more stubborn and ruthless than he thought.Mo Ran stared at the pile of bloodstained cotton gauze on the table, the basin full of hot water dyed red with blood, and the sharp knife carelessly thrown to the side. There was still flesh hanging from the tip of the knife. His head grew big.How did this person manage to heal himself?Was he really able to cut open the wound without batting an eyelid?Just imagining that scene made his scalp go numb. Was this guy still human?When he thought about how he had just cleaned up Shi Mei's wounds, Shi Mei was in so much pain that he softly groaned and had tears in the corners of his eyes, even if Mo Ran didn't like Chu Wanning, he couldn't help but to repeatedly bow to him in his heart.Elder Yu Heng really was a domineering and pure man. He was convinced.After standing in place for a while, Mo Ran broke the silence.He lightly coughed twice and rubbed the tips of his feet on the floor. He said awkwardly, \"Just now at the Chen residence \u2026 Shizun, I'm sorry.\"Chu Wanning didn't say anything.Mo Ran secretly glanced at him. \"I shouldn't have yelled at you.\"Chu Wanning still didn't pay attention to him. This person's face was indifferent and expressionless as usual, but he felt wronged in his heart, so he didn't say anything.Mo Ran walked over. When he got closer, he saw that Chu Wanning had wrapped his shoulders in cotton gauze and tied himself up like a crab.\"\u2026 \u2026\"Well, a person who didn't even know how to wash clothes, how could he expect him to tie himself up nicely?Mo Ran sighed and said, \"Shizun, don't be angry.\"\"Which eye of yours saw that I was angry?\" Chu Wanning said angrily.Mo Ran, \"\u2026 \u2026\"After a while.\"Shizun, that's not how you wrap a wound \u2026 \u2026\"He rudely retorted, \"Do I need you to teach me?\"Mo Ran, \"\u2026 \u2026\"He raised his hand, wanting to help Chu Wanning untie the gauze and re-wrap it. However, after observing his expression, he felt that if he dared to touch him, he would probably get a big slap. He couldn't help but hesitate.He raised his hand and put it down, put it down and raised it up again. After repeating this several times, Chu Wanning became angry.He glared at him. \"What are you doing?Do you still want to hit me? \"\"\u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026\" He really did want to hit him, but not now.Mo Ran was so angry that he laughed. He didn't care about anything else and suddenly reached out to hold his shoulder. A dimple appeared at the corner of his mouth. \"Shizun, I'll help you re-bandage it.\"Chu Wanning originally wanted to refuse, but Mo Ran's warm fingers had already covered his. He suddenly felt that his mouth was dry and he couldn't speak. Thus, his lips moved slightly, but he still let him do as he pleased.The gauze was removed layer by layer, soaking in blood. When it was completely removed, five glaring holes could be seen.Just looking at them made one shudder. They were many times more serious than the wounds on Shi Mei's face.Mo Ran also didn't know why. He stared blankly for a while, then suddenly asked in a soft voice, \"Does it hurt?\"Chu Wanning lowered his long eyelashes and only lightly said, \"It's okay.\"Mo Ran said, \"I'll be a bit gentler.\"Chu Wanning didn't know what to think, but suddenly his ears turned a bit red.In the end, he got angry at himself and felt that he was really crazy. He didn't know what he was thinking about all day. Thus, his expression became even stiffer and his temper worse. He dryly said, \"Up to you.\"The candlelight in the guest room flickered. Under the dim yellow light, one could see that some places weren't covered with ointment at all. Mo Ran was really speechless. He felt that it was a miracle that Chu Wanning could live to this day healthily.\"Shizun.\"\"Yes?\"\"What happened to you at the Chen house today?Why did you suddenly hit people? \"While applying the ointment, he asked.Chu Wanning was silent for a while, then said, \"I just couldn't stand it.\"Mo Ran asked, \"What made you so angry?\"At this time, Chu Wanning didn't want to argue with the younger generation, so he concisely told Mo Ran about Luo Xianxian. After hearing this, Mo Ran shook his head. \"You're too stupid. Even if you couldn't stand it, you shouldn't have confronted them directly.If it were me, I would've made up a messy spell and lied to them that the evil spirit had been eliminated. Then I would've patted my ass and left them to fend for themselves.Look at you. For such a rotten person, you made such a fuss. You're not flexible at all. You even accidentally injured Shi Mei \u2014 \u2014 \"Halfway through his words, Mo Ran suddenly stopped.His two eyes stared at Chu Wanning, and he didn't make a sound.He was very careful with the bandages, and for a moment, he forgot himself. The tone he used to talk to Chu Wanning had unknowingly turned into that of a thirty-two-year-old, impudent and rude.Chu Wanning obviously also noticed. He was looking at Mo Ran coldly from the corner of his eyes. His eyes said a familiar sentence \u2014 \u2014 \"See if I don't beat you to death.\"\"Uh \u2026 \u2026\"Before he could think of a way to deal with it, Chu Wanning had already opened his mouth.He said very coldly, \"Is Shi Mingjing someone I want to hit?\"At the mention of Shi Mei, Mo Ran's originally sober mind began to go haywire. His tone also hardened. \"Weren't you the one who hit that person?\"Chu Wanning also regretted that slap, but he couldn't keep his face. At this time, his face was sullen and he didn't say a word.Chu Wanning was the stubborn type, and Mo Ran was the infatuated type. When the two people's gazes met, sparks flew.The atmosphere that had just eased up a little was once again irredeemably deadlocked.Mo Ran said, \"Shi Mei didn't do anything wrong. Shizun, you accidentally hurt him. Don't tell me you're not even willing to say a word of apology?\"Chu Wanning narrowed his eyes dangerously. \"Are you questioning me?\"\"\u2026 \u2026 I'm not.\" Mo Ran paused. \"I just feel bad for him. He was innocently implicated, but he didn't get an apology from Shizun.\"Under the candlelight, the handsome and youthful youth wrapped the last bandage around Chu Wanning's wound and carefully wrapped it. It still looked like a rather warm scene from a moment ago, but the two people's moods had changed.Especially Chu Wanning. It was like a jar of vinegar had exploded in his chest. A sour taste kept surging up, and he was angry and annoyed.Apologize?How do you spell the word 'apologize'?Who's going to teach him?Mo Ran said again, \"The wound on his face needs at least half a year to heal completely. When I was just applying medicine to him, he told me that he didn't blame you. Shizun, he doesn't blame you, but do you think you're in the right?\"This sentence was no different from adding oil to the fire.Chu Wanning endured for a while, but in the end, he couldn't. He suppressed his voice and said in a low voice, \"Get out.\"Mo Ran, \"\u2026 \u2026\"Chu Wanning said angrily, \"Get out!\"Mo Ran was thrown out. The door slammed in his face, almost crushing his fingers.Mo Ran was also angry. Look, look!What kind of person was this?Didn't he just want him to apologize?His face was as precious as gold. How difficult was it for him to say 'sorry' with just a few words?I'm the Emperor Ta, and I'm not stingy with apologizing to others.And he's the Big Dipper Celestial Venerable? Why did he suddenly throw a tantrum? It was as if he had swallowed gunpowder!No wonder no one cared about him even though he had such a handsome face!Serves him right to be single for life!Since Chu Wanning didn't care about him and gave him the cold shoulder, the high and mighty Emperor Ta wouldn't shamelessly roll on the floor and sleep at the door.Although he was tenacious and stuck to Shi Mei like sticky candy, he stuck to Shi Mei, not Shizun.He left without a care and went to accompany Shi Mii.\"Why are you back?\"Shi Mei, who was already lying down to rest, was stunned when she saw Mo Ran come in. She sat up, her long black hair hanging down. \"How is Shizun?\"\"Very good. His temper is as bad as usual.\"Shi Mei, \"\u2026 \u2026\"Mo Ran brought a chair over and sat in the opposite direction. He rested his hand on the back of the chair and smiled lazily. He sized up Shi Mei's long hair.Shi Mei said, \"Why don't I go and see him \u2026 \u2026\"\"Wow, don't do anything stupid.\" Mo Ran rolled his eyes. \"He's fierce.\"\"Did you make him angry again?\"\"Does he need to be provoked?He can get angry with himself. I think he's made of wood. He'll burn with anger at the slightest provocation. \"Shi Mei shook his head and didn't know whether to laugh or cry.Mo Ran said, \"You should rest early. I'll go downstairs and borrow the kitchen to make you some food.\"Shi Mei said, \"What are you doing?You haven't slept all night. Why don't you sleep? \"\"Haha, I'm in good spirits.\"Mo Ran laughed. \"But if you can't bear to leave me, I can stay with you until you fall asleep.\"Shi Mei hurriedly waved his hand and said gently, \"No, I can't sleep if you keep looking at me like this. You should go to bed early too. Don't tire yourself out.\"The smile on Mo Ran's face stiffened. He was a little sad.Although Shi Mi was gentle to him, he always maintained an ambiguous attitude, sometimes far, sometimes close. Although he was clearly close to him, he was like the moon in the mirror, a flower in the water, he could only look at it but could not obtain it.\"\u2026 \u2026 Okay.\"In the end, he just tried to cheer up and smile. Mo Ran's smile was very bright. When this person wasn't evil, he was actually cute. \"Call me if you need anything. I'll be next door or downstairs.\"\"Okay.\"Mo Ran raised his hand and wanted to touch his hair, but in the end, he restrained himself.He turned his hand in the air and scratched his head.\"I'm leaving.\"After leaving the room, Mo Ran couldn't help but sneeze.He sniffed his nose.Because Colorful Butterfly Town produced incense, the price of all kinds of incense was not expensive. Therefore, the inn was not stingy. Every room was lit with a long special incense. First, it could ward off evil, second, it could get rid of humidity, and third, it could make the room fragrant.But Mo Ran felt uncomfortable when he smelled the incense. But since Shi Mei liked it, he endured it.Downstairs, Mo Ran waddled in front of the innkeeper and gave him a silver ingot. He narrowed his eyes and said with a smile, \"Innkeeper, do me a favor.\"The innkeeper looked at the silver ingot and smiled more politely than Mo Ran. \"Immortal Sage, what orders do you have?\"Mo Ran said, \"I see that there aren't many people here for breakfast, so I've talked to you. The kitchen will be used by me this morning. I'll have to trouble you to bring the other guests back.\"How much money could he earn earlier?In half a month, he might not even be able to earn back a single silver ingot. The shopkeeper immediately beamed with joy as he agreed, leading the swaggering Mo Wei Yu to the inn's kitchen.\"Immortal Sage, you want to cook?Why don't you let our chef do it? He's very good at cooking. \"\"No need.\" Mo Ran smiled. \"Innkeeper, have you heard of Xiang Tan's Drunken Jade Restaurant?\"\"Ah \u2026 Isn't that the Music and Dance Pavilion that collapsed a year ago?\"Mo Ran said, \"Yes.\"The innkeeper peeked outside and confirmed that his wife was busy and not eavesdropping. He snickered and said, \"Why haven't I heard of it?It's the most famous restaurant by Xiang River. There was a famous musician there. Her name shook the world. It's a pity that it's far away. Otherwise, I'd like to hear her play a song. \"Mo Ran smiled. \"Thank you for the compliment. I'll thank you on her behalf.\"\"On her behalf?On her behalf? \"The innkeeper scratched his head.\" Do you know her? \"Mo Ran said, \"More than that.\"\"Wow \u2026 Immortal Sage, I can't tell.Eh? But you cultivators can also \u2026 Hmm \u2026 \"Mo Ran interrupted him with a smile. \"Apart from music, do you know anything else?\"\"Hmm \u2026 It's said that her food is also very good.\"The corners of Mo Ran's mouth curled up and his smile became even brighter. He skillfully picked up the kitchen knife and said, \"Before I started cultivating, I worked in the kitchen of Drunken Jade Pavilion for several years.Tell me, is your chef's food better than mine? \"The innkeeper was even more shocked. He said incoherently, \"Immortal Sage, you're really \u2026 really \u2026\"He really didn't know what to say for a long time.Mo Ran glanced at him from the corner of his eyes, his lips curled into a calm and proud smile. He said lazily, \"Go out, I'm going to cook.\"The innkeeper didn't know that he was talking to the former Master of Darkness. He pulled a long face and said, \"I've heard that Drunken Jade Restaurant's desserts are exquisite. I wonder if Immortal Sage can give me some face and let me try some when you're done?\"He thought that Mo Ran would definitely agree since his request wasn't high.Who knew that Mo Ran would squint his eyes and say with an evil smile, \"You want to eat?\"\"Hmm!\"\"You wish!\"Mo Ran snorted. His arrogance was obvious. He muttered, \"Do you think I'm the kind of person who would easily cook and serve others?I made this especially for Shi Mei. If it weren't for him, I definitely wouldn't start a fire to cook \u2026 \"He took out a radish and started to cut it while muttering.\"\u2026\" The innkeeper was deflated. He rubbed his hands awkwardly and stood there. He smiled for a while and then left.He was also muttering in his heart.'Me?He's so young. He probably hasn't even formed his spirit core yet. 'He kept muttering, \"Junior Sister\", but there wasn't a female Daoist among the people who came with him today.The innkeeper rolled his eyes.He knew that this person was sick, and very sick.Mo Ran busied himself in the kitchen for a while. He stayed for a full four hours. When it was almost noon, he finally finished. He excitedly ran upstairs to wake Shi Mei up.When he passed by Chu Wanning's room, he slowly stopped.Should I ask him to eat with me?Thinking of Chu Wanning's bad temper, Mo Ran curled his lips and looked at him with disdain.I won't ask, I won't ask. There's only so much food. I don't want to eat with him!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs the sun rose, more and more people came to the inn to have a meal. Mo Ran felt that it was too noisy downstairs, so he asked the waiter to send the dishes to his room.In the end, he invited Chu Wanning. After all, his teacher was the most senior. He was not the Emperor of the Human Realm, so he still had to follow the rules.There were three bowls of steaming hot noodle soup on the square beech table. The noodles were made by himself and were different from the ones bought outside. They were chewy and smooth. On top of the noodles were thick slices of beef, oily fat intestines, fresh and tender pea sprouts, plump green vegetables, and golden shredded eggs. The color was bright and attractive.However, the most outstanding part of the three bowls of noodles was not the water leaves, the big pieces of meat, or the luxurious ingredients. Instead, it was the bone broth that had been simmered for four hours. It was poured into the bowls of noodles. The milky white broth had sesame red oil floating on it. Mo Ran took a stone bowl and ground a spicy and fresh seasoning. He boiled it in the broth, which was fragrant and full of flavor.He thought that Shi Mei liked to eat spicy food, so he put a lot of red oil and chili oil in the bowl.Seeing that Shi Mei was engrossed in eating, Mo Ran's smile became more and more relaxed. He stole a few glances and could not help but ask, \"Is it delicious?\"Shi Mei said, \"It's very delicious.\"Chu Wanning did not speak. He still had a gloomy expression as if God owed him a hundred mountains of gold and silver.Mo Ran showed a proud expression, \"Then when you want to eat, tell me and I'll make it.\"Shi Mei's eyes were covered with a thin layer of mist because of the spiciness. He looked up at Mo Ran with a smile. There was gentleness between his eyebrows.In front of a beauty, Mo Ran was not sure whether he should eat Shi Mei or eat the noodles in the bowl if it was not for Chu Wanning sitting next to him.Shi Mei did not eat much of the pea sprouts and intestines, but he soon finished the beef and vegetables.Mo Ran, who had been quietly observing from the side, reached out with his chopsticks and put the bean sprouts and pig intestines into his bowl. He also picked up a few pieces of beef from his bowl to fill the empty space.The disciples of Life and Death's Summit all ate at the Meng Po Lobby and would often swap dishes with each other. Thus, Shi Mei did not find it strange. He smiled and said, \"Mo Ran doesn't eat beef?\"\"Yes, I love eating pea sprouts.\"After saying that, he buried his head and started snoring.The tips of her ears were slightly red.Chu Wanning expressionlessly picked up the bean sprouts in his bowl with his chopsticks and threw them all into Mo Ran's bowl.\"I don't eat bean sprouts.\"Then, he threw all the beef in his bowl to Shi Mei. \"I don't eat beef either.\"Then, he frowned and stared at the remaining things in the bowl. He pursed his lips and remained silent.Shi Mei asked cautiously, \"Master \u2026 is it not to your liking?\"Chu Wanning, \"\u2026 \u2026\"He did not answer. Instead, he lowered his head and silently picked up a piece of vegetable. After taking a small bite, his expression became even uglier. With a \"pa\" sound, he put down his chopsticks.\"Mo Weiyu, did you spill the jar of chili sauce in the soup?\"Mo Ran did not expect that the breakfast he had painstakingly made would be reprimanded like this. He was stunned and raised his head. There was still a strand of noodles hanging from the corner of his mouth.He blinked innocently at Chu Wanning. He could not believe his ears. Thus, he slurped down the noodles and said, \"What?\"Chu Wanning did not give him any face this time. \"Is this something that humans eat?How can humans eat this? \"Mo Ran blinked a few more times. He was finally sure that this guy Chu Wanning was scolding him. He said indignantly, \"How is it not for humans to eat?\"Chu Wanning's eyebrows twitched. He said sternly, \"It's really hard to swallow.\"Mo Ran choked. In any case, he had secretly learned this skill from the Drunken Jade Pavilion.\"Master, you're \u2026 too picky.\"Shi Mei also said, \"Master, you haven't eaten for a day. Even if you don't like it, you should at least eat some.\"Chu Wanning stood up and said coldly, \"I don't eat spicy food.\"He turned and left.The two people left at the table fell into an awkward silence.Shi Mei was a little surprised. \"Master doesn't eat spicy food?How come I didn't know \u2026 Mo Ran, you didn't know either? \"\"I \u2026 \u2026\"Mo Ran looked at the noodles Chu Wanning left on the table. He did not eat a single bite. After a while, he nodded.\"En.I don't know. \"This was a lie. Mo Ran knew that Chu Wanning did not eat spicy food.But he had forgotten.After all, he had been entangled with this person for most of his life. He knew what Chu Wanning liked to eat and what he did not.But he did not care, so he did not remember.Returning to his room alone, Chu Wanning lay down with his clothes on. He faced the wall. His eyes were open, but he could not sleep.He had lost a lot of blood and used a lot of spiritual power. He had not eaten a single grain of rice in the morning. In fact, his stomach had been empty for a long time. It was very uncomfortable.This person did not know how to take care of himself. When he was in a bad mood, he simply did not eat. It was as if he thought that being angry would fill his stomach.He did not know what he was angry about. Or rather, he did not want to know.But in the silence, a face appeared vaguely in front of him. It was smiling brightly. The corners of the mouth were slightly curled. A pair of eyes were black and shining. They were a somewhat gentle deep purple.It looked warm and a little lazy.Chu Wanning clutched the mattress tightly because she was using too much force.His knuckles were slightly white.He was not willing to fall into this. He closed his eyes, wanting to get rid of this smiling face.But after he closed his eyes, the past became more and more turbulent. Like a tide, it surged into his heart \u2026The first time he saw Mo Ran was in front of the Tong Tian Tower at the peak of life and death.That day, the sun was shining brightly. All twenty elders were gathered together and were whispering to each other.Elder Yu Heng was naturally an exception. He was not so stupid as to be willing to stand there and bask in the sun.Instead, he had long hidden under a flowering tree. He absent-mindedly raised his finger and looked at his newly made black iron nail cover to see if it could be extended and retracted freely.Of course, he did not need to use a nail cover. This bent iron nail cover was specially made for the low-level disciples at the peak of life and death.The lower cultivation world was adjacent to the ghost world. It was often dangerous. It was not rare for low-level disciples to be injured and lose their lives. Chu Wanning saw this. Although he did not say anything, he had been thinking hard about a solution. He wanted to make a light and flexible weapon that was easy to use.The others were discussing enthusiastically at the side.\"Did you hear?The High Lord's long-lost nephew was saved from the sea of fire.Everyone else in the building that caught fire died. If the Lord was a step later, I'm afraid that little nephew would have turned into ashes. He's really lucky. \"\"It must be his father who is secretly protecting him.It's a pity that he was separated from when he was young and suffered so much. Sigh \u2026 \"\"That child is called Mo Ran?He's about fifteen years old, right?It's time for him to choose a name. Does he have a name? \"\"Elder Xuanji, you don't know. This child grew up in a brothel. It's good enough that he has a name. How can he have a name?\"\"I heard that the Lord wrote a few words for him and is choosing. I don't know which one he will choose in the end.\"\"The Lord really values little nephew.\"\"Isn't that so?Not to mention the Lord, even the Madam feels sorry for him.Heh, I think the only one who is not happy at the peak of life and death is probably our God's favored one \u2014 \"\"Elder Tanlang!You can't say that! \"\"Haha.A slip of the tongue, a slip of the tongue!However, our God's favored one is arrogant because of his talent. He doesn't respect his elders and spends his days fighting cocks and running dogs as if he was born rich. He's indeed out of control. \"\"Elder Tan Lang, you drank a little too much today \u2026\" The people beside him kept giving him looks. They pointed their chin at Chu Wanning, who was standing in the distance. Their meaning couldn't be more obvious.The God's favored one, Xue Meng, was Chu Wanning's disciple. Saying that Xue Meng was out of control was equivalent to mocking Chu Wanning for not teaching well.This Elder Yu Heng, don't be fooled by his usual leisurely and otherworldly demeanor. It was as if he was above the world and had the style of an expert.However, everyone knew that his temper was extremely bad. If anyone accidentally touched his reverse scale, then they should wash their neck clean and wait to be beaten to death.Chu Wanning had heard their words long ago.However, he was too lazy to care. He was probably less interested in how others evaluated him than the patterns on his fingernails.Speaking of which, this set of armor was good, but its durability was not high enough. If he encountered a thick-skinned demon, he might not be able to tear through their flesh in one strike. If he added some Dragon Bone Powder when he returned, the effect should be better.When the Elders saw that Chu Wanning had no reaction, they let out a sigh of relief and began to discuss in low voices.\"My Lord summoned us here today to choose a master for that Young Master Mo, right?\"\"That's strange. Why doesn't the High Lord teach it himself?\"\"It seems that the little nephew's bone structure is not suitable for practicing the Supremacy's mental cultivation method.\"Someone muttered, \"But that's not to the extent of gathering all the Elders and letting the Young Master pick one by one, right?\"Elder Lucun sighed gloomily. Flipping his elegant and smooth long hair, he complained, \"I feel that I am like a cheap cabbage on the table right now, waiting for Young Master Mo to pick.\"Everyone: \"\u2026\"So, could this sissy not speak such a big truth without thinking?After waiting for a while, the Supremacy finally arrived.He walked up the thousand steps and arrived in front of Tong Tian Tower. Behind him was a young man.Chu Wanning only glanced at him casually. Before he could see clearly, he turned his gaze away and continued to study his fingernails.He was too lazy to take a second look.When it came to apprenticeship, one had to talk about how unconventional the Peak of Life and Death was.In other sects, the master would be high and mighty. He would rub the head of a new disciple and say, \"Young man, I see that you are quite intelligent. From today onwards, you are my disciple.\"The disciple did not even have the chance to say 'no'.Or the master would look at him with cold disdain, waving his sleeves and saying, \"Young man, your head is too high, your eyes are dull, and the back of your head is rebellious. This is not what my disciple should look like.You are not destined to be my disciple. I will not accept you as my disciple. \"Then, before the disciple could express himself, the master would fly away on his sword. He ran faster than a dog.The Peak of Life and Death was different. The master and disciple were mutually chosen.What did this mean?There were twenty elders at the Peak of Life and Death. After all the disciples entered the sect, they would be able to sincerely hand in their master's letter after a period of interaction. They would express their desire to follow the elder in cultivation.If the elder accepted, then everyone would be happy.If the elder did not accept, then the disciple could pester them until the elder softened or the disciple gave up.Logically speaking, Chu Wanning's skills were superb and his appearance was handsome. He should have a lot of disciples, and all of them would do anything to become his disciple.But in reality, this was not the case.Chu Wanning's face was handsome, but his temper was so bad that it made one's hair stand on end. It was said that when he was angry, he would beat up female disciples as if they were male disciples and drown them in a pond.Not many people had the courage to worship this kind of master.Thus, Elder Yu Heng's disciples were deserted.Other than the proud son of heaven, Xue Meng, and Xue Meng's good friend, Shi Mei, he had never accepted anyone.Everyone would rather respectfully call him 'Zhanglao' than affectionately call him 'Shizun'.Chu Wanning said with a cold expression that he was not sad. He lowered his head indifferently and continued to fiddle with the cold mecha weapons.Sleeve arrow boxes, martial law sentry, they were all designed for other people.The earlier they were done, the earlier more people could be spared from suffering.So he did not expect that Mo Ran would choose him without hesitation.At that time, he was frowning and stroking the spikes on his finger gloves, thinking about how to improve them. He did not pay attention to what the High Lord said to everyone.At some point, the surroundings gradually quieted down.After thinking about how to improve the spikes, Chu Wanning suddenly realized that the buzzing around just now seemed a bit too quiet.So he finally moved his gaze away from the finger gloves. With some impatience and inquiry, he raised his eyelids.Then he saw a face.Under the sunlight, it was so bright that it was almost dazzling.It was an elegant and handsome young man who was looking up at him.The young man's mouth was curled up in a lazy, faintly discernible smile. The dimples on his cheeks were deep, and he had the air of a common man, but also a little pure.A pair of black eyes with hints of purple were staring at him without blinking. They were half eager and half curious.He was new here and did not know the rules.The distance between them was so close that it could almost be called rude.Suddenly, a person appeared in front of him. Chu Wanning was shocked. As if he was scalded, he subconsciously took a step back. With a bang, his head hit the trunk of a tree.The young man widened his eyes slightly. \"Ah \u2026\"Chu Wanning: \"\u2026\"The young man: \"\u2026\"Chu Wanning: \"What are you doing?\"The young man laughed. \"Immortal Master, Immortal Master, I've been looking at you for a long time. Why are you ignoring me?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChu Wanning had completely fainted.He could only blame himself for being too engrossed and not being on guard at the peak of life and death. He didn't even notice that someone was approaching.What's going on?Where did this kid come from?Ah, it seems to be that Mo-something \u2026 Mo-something?Mo-cooked?Mo-cooked?Mo-fish?He adjusted his expression and skillfully controlled his expression to \"keep people away\" state. The surprise and panic in his eyes were quickly swept away by him and replaced with his usual sharp and harsh expression.\"You \u2014\"Just as he was about to reprimand him out of habit, his hand was suddenly caught.Chu Wanning was stunned.In all his life, no one had ever dared to grab his wrist casually.For a moment, his face turned black and he froze in place, not knowing what to do.Take it out and give him a slap?\u2026 With the word \"molester\", he was no different from a girl.Then take it out and not give him a slap?\u2026 Wasn't he a little too easy to talk to?Chu Wanning hesitated for a long time and didn't move. The youth laughed, \"What's that on your hand?It's quite pretty. Can you teach me how to do this?They have already introduced themselves, but you haven't said anything. Which elder are you?Hey, did your head hurt when you bumped into it? \"With so many questions thrown at him, Chu Wanning felt that his head didn't hurt before, but now it did.His head was about to split open \u2026He was irritated and the golden light in his hand slightly floated. Seeing that Heaven's Inquisition was about to answer the call, the other elders were all shocked. Was Chu Wanning crazy?He dared to slap this Young Master Mo?His hand was suddenly caught by Mo Ran.Now that both of his hands were in the hands of the young man, Mo Ran didn't seem to notice the danger. He pulled the young man and stood in front of him. He looked up and said with a smile, \"My name is Mo Ran. I don't know anyone here, but I like you the most just by looking at your face.Why don't I worship you as my teacher? \"This result was completely unexpected. The surrounding people were even more horrified. A few of the elders' faces looked like they were about to crack.Elder Xuanji: \"Hmm?\"Elder Pojun: \"Wow!\"Elder Seven Kills: \"Oh?\"Disciplinary Elder, \"Uh \u2026\"Elder Tanlang: \"Ha, what a joke.\"Elder Lucun was the most feminine. His hair was curly, and his eyes were like peach blossoms. \"Aiya, this young master is so bold. He's truly a young hero. He even dares to touch Elder Yu Heng's butt.\"\"\u2026 Please, can you not make it sound so disgusting?\" Seven Kills said in disdain.Lucun rolled his eyes gracefully and snorted, \"Hmm, then I'll put it in a more refined manner. You're truly a young hero. You even dared to touch Elder Yu Heng's butt.\"Seven Kills: \"\u2026\" Just kill him.Among all the elders, the most popular one was the gentle Elder Xuanji. It was easy for him to learn magic, and he was a gentleman himself. Most of the disciples at the Peak of Life and Death were under his tutelage.Chu Wanning originally thought that Mo Ran would be no exception. Even if he wasn't Xuanji, he should be the lively Pojun. After all, it would be anyone's turn but not his.However, Mo Ran was standing so close to him, and his face was filled with a kind of affection and affection that was unfamiliar to him. He was like a clown who was suddenly chosen, and he was flustered for no reason.Chu Wanning only knew how to deal with \"awe\", \"fear\", and \"disgust\". As for \"affection\", it was too difficult.He didn't even think about it and immediately rejected Mo Ran.The young man was stunned. Under his long eyelashes, there was a hint of loneliness and unwillingness in his eyes.He lowered his head and thought for a long time. Suddenly, he unreasonably whispered, \"Anyway, it's you.\"Chu Wanning: \"\u2026\"The Great Lord was watching from the side. He couldn't help but laugh and ask, \"Mo Ran, do you know who he is?\"\"He didn't tell me. How would I know who he is?\"\"Haha, since you don't know who he is, why do you want him?\"Mo Ran was still holding Chu Wanning's hand. He turned his head and said to the Great Lord with a smile, \"Because he looks the most gentle and easy to talk to.\"In the darkness, Chu Wanning suddenly opened his eyes. He felt dizzy.\u2026 What the hell.He didn't know what was wrong with Mo Ran's eyes at that time. He actually thought that he was gentle.Not only him, but the entire Peak of Life and Death knew about this. They all looked at Mo Ran with a \"look at this silly child\" look.Chu Wanning raised his hand and held his throbbing forehead.His shoulder hurt, his mind was in a mess, his stomach was hungry, and he was dizzy.It seemed that he wouldn't be able to sleep.He lay on the bed in a daze for a while. He sat up and was about to light a stick of incense to calm himself down when suddenly there was a knock on the door.It was Mo Ran outside again.Chu Wanning: \"\u2026\"He didn't answer. He didn't say 'get in' or 'get out'.But this time, the door opened by itself.Chu Wanning looked up gloomily.The match in his hand hovered in mid-air. It didn't touch the incense. After a while, it went out.Chu Wanning said, \"Get out.\"Mo Ran rolled in.He was holding a bowl of steaming hot noodles that had just come out of the pot.It was simpler this time. There weren't as many fancy noodles. The pure white noodle soup was sprinkled with chopped green onions and white sesame seeds. There were small pieces of pork ribs, green vegetables, and a slightly browned poached egg.Chu Wanning was very hungry, but his face was still expressionless. He looked at the noodles, then looked at Mo Ran. He turned his face away and didn't say anything.Mo Ran put the noodles on the table and said softly, \"I asked the chef in the shop to make another bowl.\"Chu Wanning lowered his eyes.Sure enough, Mo Ran wouldn't be the one to make it.\"Eat some,\" Mo Ran said, \"There's no spicy food in this bowl, no beef, and no bean sprouts.\"After that, he left and closed the door for Chu Wanning.He felt sorry for Chu Wanning's injury.But that was all he could do.In the room, Chu Wanning leaned against the window. No one knew what he was thinking.He crossed his arms and stared at the bowl of pork rib noodles until the steam from the noodles dissipated. In the end, they became cold and no longer hot.He finally walked over and sat down. He picked up his chopsticks, picked up the cold noodles, and ate slowly.The Chen house evil case was closed.The next day, they picked up the black horse from the post house and returned to the sect along the road they had come from.On the streets, in the restaurants, the people of Rainbow Butterfly Town were all talking about the Chen family.In such a small town, such a scandal broke out. It was enough for the townspeople to talk about for a year.\"I didn't expect that Young Master Chen would marry Miss Luo behind closed doors. Ah, Miss Luo is so pitiful.\"\"If you ask me, if the Chen family didn't suddenly become rich, then this wouldn't have happened. Sure enough, men can't have money. Once they have money, they can drown the entire city with bad ideas.\"A man was unhappy and said, \"Young Master Chen didn't do anything bad. This is all his parents' fault. That son of a bitch, in the future, his children won't have assholes.\"Another person said, \"The dead are pitiful, but what about the living?Look at Chen Yaoshi, Miss Yao. I think she is the one who has been wronged.That black hearted old mother of the Chen family lied to her daughter. Tell me, what should she do now? \"\"Remarry.\"That person rolled his eyes and sneered, \"Remarry?You want to marry? \"The bumpkin who was ridiculed grimaced in pain and said, \"If that woman in my nest agrees, I'll marry her. Miss Yao is so pretty, I don't mind her being a widow.\"\"Bah, a toad wants to eat swan meat.\"Mo Ran sat on the back of the horse and pricked up his ears. He was in high spirits as he listened left and right.If it weren't for the fact that Chu Wanning had her eyes closed and her brows furrowed, writing the words \"extremely noisy\" on her forehead, Mo Ran might have gone over to join in the gossip with the villagers.Riding side by side, they finally left the main city and arrived at the suburbs.Shi Mei suddenly exclaimed and pointed to the distance, \"Master, look over there.\"In front of the destroyed temple of the Ghost Master, there was a large group of farmers wearing brown clothes and short robes. They were busy moving bricks and stones. It seemed that they were planning to repair the damaged temple and reconstruct the Ghost Master's golden body.Shi Mei said worriedly, \"Master, the ghost master from before is gone, and they made a new one.Will this one become an immortal again and do evil? \"Chu Wanning said, \"I don't know.\"\"Why don't we go and persuade them?\"Chu Wanning said, \"The custom of Colorful Butterfly Town's ghost marriage has been passed down for generations. How can you persuade them with just a few words?Let's go. \"As he said that, he rode away, leaving behind a trail of dust.It was already evening when they returned to the peak of life and death.Chu Wanning said to his two disciples in front of the mountain gate, \"You two go to the Dan Xin Palace and report what happened. I will go to the Discipline Court.\"Mo Ran was puzzled, \"Why are you going to the Discipline Court?\"Shi Mo, on the other hand, looked very worried. \"\u2026\"Chu Wanning said expressionlessly, \"To receive the punishment.\"Although the emperor was punished the same as the commoners when he broke the law, which emperor would be imprisoned and beheaded after autumn because he killed someone?It was the same in the cultivation world.If the elders broke the law, they would be punished the same as the disciples. In most sects, this was just an empty sentence.In fact, it was the elders who broke the law. It was good enough that they could write a letter of guilt. Which idiot would obediently accept the punishment and be beaten with willow vines or dozens of sticks?Therefore, when the Discipline Elder heard Chu Wanning's confession, his face turned green.\"No, Elder Yu Heng, did you really \u2026 really beat the client?\"Chu Wanning said lightly, \"Yes.\"\"You are too \u2026\"Chu Wanning looked up and gave him a gloomy look. The Discipline Elder shut up.\"According to the law, this punishment is 200 sticks, seven days of kneeling in the Yama Palace, and three months of confinement.\" Chu Wanning said, \"I have nothing to say. I am willing to accept the punishment.\"The Discipline Elder, \"\u2026\"He looked left and right, then crooked his finger. The door of the Discipline Court closed with a bang. The surroundings were suddenly silent. Only the two of them stood facing each other.Chu Wanning asked, \"What do you mean?\"\"Well, Elder Yu Heng, it's not like you don't know that things like the Discipline Court, no matter how strict it is, shouldn't affect you.When this matter is closed, only the heavens, the earth, you and I know. Let's just forget about it.If I beat you and the Lord finds out, won't he be angry with me? \"Chu Wanning couldn't be bothered to talk nonsense with him. He simply said, \"If I punish others according to the law, I should also punish myself according to the law.\"As he said this, he knelt in front of the Discipline Court and faced the plaque.\"You can punish me.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayElder Yu Heng's punishment for breaking the precepts spread like wildfire. There was no need to wait until the next morning. Almost everyone in the sect knew about it that very night.If a normal person were to receive two hundred beatings, they would most likely be beaten to death.Even if they were cultivators, it would be enough to make them suffer.When Xue Meng heard this, he jumped up. \"What?!Master went to the Discipline Court? \"\"Young Master, you should go and talk to the Sect Leader. Master was already injured. How could he withstand two hundred beatings?\"Xue Meng was about to go crazy. \"My father?No, my father is still in the Treading in Snow Palace. Even if he sent a messenger pigeon, it would take at least the next day to arrive.Why didn't you stop Master? \"Mo Ran and Shi Mei glanced at each other.Stop Chu Wanning?Who in this world could stop him?\"No, no, I'll go find him now.\" Xue Meng anxiously ran toward the Discipline Court.Before he entered the courtyard, he saw a group of Discipline Elder's disciples blocking the entrance to the main hall. They were whispering to each other.\"What are you all standing there for?Get out of my way!Get out of my way! \"\"Young Master!\"\"Ah, the Young Master is here.\"\"Make way, the Young Master is here.\"The disciples quickly separated into two sides, making way for Xue Meng.The doors to the Blue Sky Hall were wide open. Chu Wanning was kneeling inside. His body was straight, and his eyes were closed.The Discipline Elder held his iron staff and recited the precepts of the Peak of Life and Death. Every time he finished reciting a precept, his iron staff would strike Chu Wanning's back.\"Our sect's ninety-first precept. Do not harm the innocent. Do not use immortal techniques on mortals. Do you have any complaints under my staff?\"\"No complaints.\"\"Our sect's ninety-second precept. Do not act rashly. Do you have any complaints under my staff?\"\"No complaints.\"The Discipline Elder did not dare to be soft. He could only carry out his orders impartially.After more than ninety strikes, Chu Wanning's white robes were completely soaked in blood.Xue Meng respected Chu Wanning the most. Seeing this, his eyes turned bloodshot. He shouted, \"Shizun!\"Chu Wanning turned a deaf ear to him. His eyes were still closed, and his brows were slightly furrowed.The disciplinary elder looked at the door and said in a low voice, \"Elder Yu Heng, the young master is here.\"\"I'm not deaf. I heard it.\" Chu Wanning's mouth was bleeding, but he didn't look up. \"He's just a kid. Don't bother.\"The Disciplinary Elder sighed. \"\u2026 Yuheng, why are you doing this?\"\"Who asked my disciple to be so disobedient?\"Chu Wanning said indifferently, \"If I don't accept my punishment today, how will I have the face to discipline others in the future?\"\"\u2026\"\"You may continue.\"\"Sigh \u2026\" The Disciplinary Elder looked at his pale and slender neck that peeked out from the wide collar. It hung down softly like smoke. He couldn't help but say, \"Then at least be gentler?\"\"\u2026 What's the difference between this and deception?\" Chu Wanning said, \"Don't worry. It's only two hundred strikes. I can take it.\"\"Elder Yu Heng \u2026\"\"Discipline, you don't need to say anymore. Continue.\"The iron staff finally fell again.Xue Meng's voice was distorted. \"Disciplinary Elder!You still won't fucking stop?What do you think of this young master?You're hitting my shizun!!My shizun!!! \"The Disciplinary Elder could only brace himself and pretend he didn't hear.Xue Meng was so angry that his lungs were about to explode. \"Damn old man, did you not hear me?This young master orders you to stop!You, if you dare to hit him again, I, I, I \u2014 \"He stammered for a long time but couldn't think of anything to say. After all, he was only a fifteen-year-old boy. No matter how \"blessed by the heavens\" he was, his strength and experience were far inferior to the elders. He could only force out an unreasonable sentence with a red face.\"I'll tell my father!!!\"Disciplinary Elder, \"\u2026\"Chu Wanning sighed imperceptibly.Ninety-seven strikes.Ninety-eight strikes.Ninety-nine strikes.One hundred strikes \u2026His clothes were torn and the blood was glaring.Xue Meng couldn't hold it in anymore.He was so anxious that his eyes turned red. He was about to charge in recklessly. Chu Wanning suddenly opened his eyes and waved his hand. A barrier instantly slashed down and blocked the entrance. Xue Meng was bounced back a few steps and almost fell to the ground.Chu Wanning coughed up blood and rolled his eyes. His sharp phoenix eyes glanced sideways.\"You're making a fool of yourself. Scram!\"\"Shizun!\"Chu Wanning said sternly, \"When did the Young Master of the Peak of Life and Death order the Disciplinary Elder to bend the law?Hurry up and scram! \"Xue Meng stared at him. His eyes were wide open, and there seemed to be water droplets swirling inside.Mo Ran rubbed his chin at the side. The corners of his mouth were still curled up. \"Aiya, this is bad. Little Phoenix is going to cry.\"Hearing this, Xue Meng suddenly turned around and fiercely glared at Mo Ran. His teary eyes were red, but he forced himself not to let the tears roll down.He didn't complain and didn't talk back.He got up from the ground and lowered his head. He gritted his teeth and brushed the dust off his body. Then, he knelt down in front of the Azure Sky Hall. \"Shizun, this disciple knows his mistake.\"Chu Wanning was still being tortured by the iron staff. His back was not bent, but his face was pale and his forehead was covered with fine cold sweat.Xue Meng stubbornly said, \"But I won't go. I will accompany Shizun.\"After saying this, he knelt down and didn't get up.Mo Ran rolled his eyes so hard that he could see the sky.Xue Meng, Xue Ziming, a proud son of Heaven, but in front of Chu Wanning, he was lowly to the bone.He was a phoenix in front of others, but in front of Shizun, he could become a quail.If he wasn't sure that Xue Meng didn't like men, Mo Ran would have suspected that this guy had taken a fancy to Chu Wanning. That was why he was so dead set on following him.When Shizun hit him on the left side of his face, this little quail would also shamelessly put his right face forward.I give up, I give up.He was really good at being a lackey.Although he despised him in his heart, his cheeks were sore for some reason. Mo Ran stared at Xue Meng for a while. The more he stared, the more upset he felt. He felt that he couldn't let him express his loyalty all by himself.Chu Wanning didn't like him to begin with. If Xue Meng made a scene like this, wouldn't Chu Wanning be even more biased in the future?Thus, he simply knelt down beside Xue Meng.\"I will also accompany Shizun.\"Shi Mei naturally followed suit and knelt down. The three disciples all knelt outside and waited.When the disciples under the other elders heard the news, they all used various excuses to come to the Discipline Court to watch the show.\"Heavens, why is it Elder Yu Heng \u2026 \u2026\"\"I heard that he hit a normal person in a fit of anger.\"\"Ah!So fierce? \"\"Shh, be quiet. If Elder Yu Heng hears you, he'll beat you!\"Someone else said, \"Why is Young Master kneeling?\"\"Mo gongzi is kneeling as well...\"Mo Ran was handsome and had a sweet mouth. Who knew how many female cultivators had good intentions towards him. At this time, some of them couldn't help but feel pity for him. They whispered, \"My heart aches for Young Master Mo. What should we do? Should we go and plead for him?\"\"Let's not meddle in their affairs.If you dare to go, then go. I'm a coward.Do you still remember that Senior Sister who was whipped a few hundred times by Elder Yu Heng \u2026 \"\"\u2026\"After two hundred strikes.The barrier was finally removed.Xue Meng hurriedly got up from the ground and scrambled towards the Azure Heaven Hall. When he got close enough to see Chu Wanning's appearance, he was so angry that he let out an 'ah'. He turned around and grabbed the Disciplinary Elder's collar, \"You damn old man, can't you hit me a little more gently?!\"\"Xue Ziming.\"Chu Wanning closed his eyes. His blood-stained lips opened and closed. His hoarse voice was filled with an invisible deterrence.\"...\"Xue Meng's knuckles cracked. He suddenly pushed the Disciplinary Elder and let him go.At this time, Mo Ran also came. He was originally smiling, thinking that the Disciplinary Elder would definitely take Chu Wanning's identity into consideration and wouldn't hit him too hard.But when he lowered his head and saw Chu Wanning's injuries, the smile on his face suddenly froze.Chu Wanning actually didn't tell the Disciplinary Elder that his shoulder was injured?!Those two hundred strikes, more or less, all landed heavily on the old scar on his shoulder.The new wound stacked on top of the old one.Chu Wanning, you...Are you crazy?!His pupils shrank. A strong resentment welled up in his heart.Mo Ran didn't know what he was resentful about, or what he was angry about. He only felt a raging fire rising in his stomach, burning his five viscera and six bowels.He was used to Chu Wanning being tortured to death by him, crushing his self-esteem and tarnishing his purity.But Mo Ran couldn't stand that Chu Wanning's injuries were caused by someone else!Probably because he hadn't forgotten the past, Mo Ran subconsciously felt that this person was his. Whether this person was dead or alive, hated or hated, it was all his.He originally didn't care about Chu Wanning being punished. That was because he thought that since Chu Wanning was an Elder, the two hundred strikes wouldn't be a heavy punishment.At the very least, it would avoid the wound on his shoulder that hadn't healed yet.But Chu Wanning actually didn't say anything!He actually didn't say anything!What was this lunatic being stubborn about?What was he enduring?What was he stubbornly holding on to?!?His mind was a mess. Mo Ran wanted to raise his hand to help him, but Xue Meng was one step ahead of him. He held Chu Wanning and helped him up.\"...\" Mo Ran's hand hung in the air. After a while, he put it down again.He watched as Xue Meng helped Chu Wanning walk away. He didn't know what to feel.He wanted to follow them, but he wasn't willing to move.What happened in the past was all in the past.Now, Chu Wanning was only his Master.Between them, there was no chaos, hatred, or romantic entanglement.He shouldn't have such thoughts.It didn't matter who hit Chu Wanning, who was supported, who was with whom, even if he was killed, it had nothing to do with him.Shi Mei came to his side. \"Let's go. We'll go with Young Master and take a look.\"\"I'm not going. It's enough that Xue Meng is here.I can't help much. It'll only make things worse if there are more people. \"Mo Ran's expression didn't change, but his heart was a little confused.He really didn't understand what he was feeling now.Was it hatred?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThat night, lying on the bed at the Peak of Life and Death, Mo Ran put his hands behind his head and looked at the ceiling, unable to sleep.Scenes of the past flashed in front of his eyes. In the end, bit by bit, fragments, they were all Chu Wanning's handsome and somewhat cold face.Actually, Mo Ran never knew what he thought of this person.The first time he saw him, it was under the flowering tree in front of Tong Tian Tower.He was wearing a wide robe with wide sleeves. Of the more than twenty elders, he was the only one who did not wear the extremely coquettish silver-blue profound armor at the Peak of Life and Death.That day, he lowered his head, absentmindedly thinking about the armor on his hand. Half of his face looked focused and gentle, like a white cat in the golden sun.Mo Ran looked from afar, unable to move his gaze away.He felt that his first impression of Chu Wanning was very good.But he could not endure the coldness, punishment, and harshness that followed.That white cat had sharp teeth and claws, biting him until his body was full of wounds.He was saved by his uncle from the sea of fire, on the verge of death, his life hanging by a thread.Originally, he thought that after coming to the Peak of Life and Death, there would be a master who would treat him with tolerance, who would truly cherish him.However, Chu Wanning did not seem to see his fawning, his efforts.On the contrary, the ferocious whip was fierce, the slightest mistake would cause his skin to split open and his flesh to be mangled.Later, he found out that Chu Wanning looked down on him from the bottom of his heart \u2014 \u2014\"Bad character, hard to polish.\"That man in white under the flowering tree, that was how he was evaluated, right?He once thought of Chu Wanning as Jiutian Hanyue, sincerely worshipping and loving him.But in Jiutian Hanyue's heart, what was he, Mo Ran?A disciple that he had no choice but to accept.A lowly person who despised him to the bone.A hooligan who grew up in a restaurant and was tainted with a filthy aura.Although Mo Ran was always laughing and joking, looking like he did not care, he slowly hated Chu Wanning. That hatred contained a strong unwillingness.He was unwilling to accept this.In the past, he had always harbored a growing resentment towards Chu Wanning, trying to get this person's attention, to get this person's praise, to get this person's surprise.During that period of time, if Shi Mei had praised him with \"very good\", he would have been overjoyed.However, if Chu Wanning was willing to praise him with \"not bad\", he was willing to die.But Chu Wanning never praised him.No matter how hard he tried, how attentive he was, that cold man always nodded faintly, and then turned his face away.Mo Ran was about to go crazy.God knows how much she wanted to pinch Chu Wanning's cheeks and turn him around, forcing him to stare at her, forcing him to swallow the words \"bad character, difficult to cultivate\" back into his stomach!But he could only kneel in front of Chu Wanning, like a stray dog, kowtow and respectfully say, \"This disciple will remember Master's teachings.\"In front of Chu Wanning, Mo Weiyu was lowly to the bone.Even if he was a \"Young Master\", he was still lowly.He finally understood that a person like Chu Wanning did not like him at all.Later on, he experienced many things.Mo Ran held power at the peak of life and death, and then strove to reach the peak of the cultivation world, becoming an unprecedented overlord.Under his dark subordinates, everyone trembled, everyone was afraid, everyone mentioned his name softly like a mosquito. Who still remembered his stains, who still remembered his lowly background \u2014 \u2014From then on, there was no more Mo Weiyu in the world, only the Emperor Ta.Emperor Ta.People hated him, hated him to the extreme. The heinous Mo Weiyu, could not be saved even after a thousand times of the Art of Rebirth, could not be reincarnated!Emperor Ta Mo Weiyu, Emperor Ta Mo Weiyu, Emperor Ta \u2014 \u2014\u2026 \u2026 Ta, Xian, Jun.But even if they were afraid, what could they do?At the peak of life and death, there were still loud cheers, thousands of people kneeling in front of the Wu Shan Palace, densely packed heads kowtowed three times to him.\"Immortal Trampling Monarch, may you live a long life and never die.\"He felt very happy.Until he noticed Chu Wanning's face in the crowd.At that time, Chu Wanning had already lost his cultivation, and was tied under the main hall, becoming a prisoner.Mo Ran was determined to kill him, but he did not want Chu Wanning to leave easily. He restrained Chu Wanning's limbs, and cut the blood vessels on Chu Wanning's neck. The wound was not big, and he cast a spell to prevent the wound from clotting. Blood flowed out little by little, and his life was drained away little by little.The sun was hot, and the coronation ceremony had been going on for half a day. Chu Wanning's blood should have been drained.When this person died, Mo Ran would completely cut off his past, so he purposely arranged for Chu Wanning to bleed during his coronation ceremony.When he became the Three Nine Supremes of the Cultivation World, Chu Wanning would become a lifeless corpse.Everything that happened yesterday would disappear like smoke.It was great.But this person was about to die, so why was he still so indifferent?He was so handsome that he was somewhat fickle \u2026 His face was pale, but his expression was indifferent. When he looked at the Emperor Ta, there was neither praise nor fear.There was only disgust, disdain, and \u2014Mo Ran felt that he must be crazy.Either that, or Chu Waning had gone mad.There was also a trace of pity.Chu Wanning pitied himself, a person who was about to die, a defeated opponent!He actually pitied a person who had reached the pinnacle of the Human Realm, an overlord who could call the wind and summon the rain.He, he actually would \u2014 he actually dared!!!The anger that had accumulated for more than ten years made Mo Ran crazy. He was in the Dan Xin Palace, of course, at that time, it was called the Wu Mountain Palace.He suddenly stood up in front of several thousand people, and amidst those people's flattery and praises, his black robe billowed as he walked down the stairs.In front of everyone, he pinched Chu Wanning's chin. His face was distorted, and his smile was sweet and ferocious.\"Master, today is your disciple's big day, why are you still unhappy?\"The thousands of people were silent in an instant.Chu Wanning was neither servile nor overbearing. With a cold expression, he said, \"I don't have a disciple like you.\"Mo Ran laughed unrestrainedly. His voice was like vultures circling the corridors of the Golden Palace Hall, frightening the wild geese.\"Master, you're so heartless, it really makes my heart cold.\" He laughed and said loudly, \"You don't have a disciple like me?Who taught me my mental cultivation method?Who taught me how to fight like this?Who taught me my cruelty and cold-bloodedness?!I still have the whip all over my body. Let me ask you, who beat me?! \"He stopped laughing. His voice suddenly became fierce and fierce, and his eyes were cold.\"Chu Wanning!Do you think it's embarrassing to have a disciple like me?Am I cheap in my bones, or the filth in my blood can't be washed away?Let me ask you, Chu Wanning, let me ask you \u2014 what do you mean by 'bad character, hard to cultivate'? \"In the end, he was also a little crazy. He shouted with a distorted voice.\"You've never treated me as a disciple, you've never looked up to me!But I \u2014 but I used to \u2014 I really treated you as my master, I really respected you, I really loved you, and you treat me like this?Why are you never willing to praise me? Why is it that no matter what I do, I can't get half a good from you?! \"Chu Wanning's whole body shook. His face gradually paled.He opened his phoenix eyes slightly and looked at Mo Ran like that. His lips moved as if he wanted to say something, but in the end, he didn't say anything.At the peak of life and death, the only two people who were still in the same place faced each other like that.In this awkward silence, Mo Ran seemed to have finally calmed down. He closed his eyes. When he opened them again, there was that disgusting smile again. He was smiling, laughing, and making people tremble.He said gently and kindly, \"Shizun, didn't you look down on me? Didn't you think I was lowly?\"Pausing for a moment, his gaze swept over the heads of the thousands of people. Those people were all kneeling in front of his palace like dogs. They all acknowledged that he was the Lord of the Cultivation World, above the rolling world of mortals.Mo Ran smiled and said, \"And now?Before you die, I'll ask you one more time.In this world, who is the lowly one, and who is the superior one?Who is the one who stepped on who, and who is the one who is the king?And who is the one who is the loser? \"Chu Wanning lowered his eyes. He seemed to still be immersed in Mo Ran's confession and didn't come back to his senses.In the end, Mo Ran pinched his chin and forced him to raise his face.But when he forced him to look at himself, Mo Ran suddenly froze.For the first time, he saw an expression of regret on Chu Wanning's face.That expression was too unfamiliar. Mo Ran felt like he was suddenly scalded. He reflexively released the fingers that were pinching his face.\"You \u2026\"Chu Wanning's expression was very painful. He seemed to be enduring some kind of heart-wrenching, heart-wrenching pain.His voice was very soft, almost hoarse.It floated in the wind. Only Mo Ran heard it.He said, \"I'm sorry, Mo Ran.It's Master's fault \u2026 \"In that instant, everything around him lost its sound. The sound of the wind, the sound of the grass, the fluttering of the robes, all returned to silence.Only Chu Wanning's face, which was staring at him, was the only clear thing in the world.It was the only thing he could see.At that time, he should have many thoughts.Happy, proud, ecstatic.But it wasn't.At that time, the thoughts were strange. Speaking of which, there was only one \u2014He didn't know when \u2026 he was already so much taller than Chu Wanning.Time had really passed for a long time.Many things in the past had changed.Mo Ran's lips trembled. He murmured, \"What \u2026 did you say?\"Chu Wanning smiled. Mo Ran was familiar with that smile, but at the same time, he was not familiar with it. Mo Ran saw his own twisted expression in that pair of phoenix eyes.Then, that pair of eyes slowly closed. Chu Wanning fell on his back. Mo Ran grabbed his shoulder almost at the moment he fell. He roared madly and angrily, like the sound of a wild beast breaking down.\"Chu Wanning!Chu Wanning, what did you say?Say it again!! \"The person in his arms didn't reply. His lips were pale like pear blossoms. That handsome face always had a cold expression, but before he died, it was frozen in a somewhat miserable smile. The corners of his mouth were slightly raised. In his memory, Mo Ran saw that face for the first time in front of the Tong Tian Tower.It was a slight smile, somewhat gentle.\"Chu Wanning!!\"That gentleness shattered. The begonia flowers fell to the ground.He finally got what he wanted. He stepped on his master's life and reached the top of the Human Peak.But what was this?What was this?!The bitterness and hatred in his heart continued to increase. What was this?Mo Ran condensed the faint black mist in his palm. His fingertips flew and quickly tapped a few of Chu Wanning's blood meridians, sealing the last meridian of his heart.\"Do you want to die like this?\"Mo Ran's eyes bulged. His face was ferocious. \"It's not over. Chu Wanning, we haven't settled the debt between us. It's not over!It's not over!If you don't make it clear to me \u2014 I'll crush Xue Meng, Kunlun's Treading in Snow Palace, and the last few people you want to protect!!Tear them all to pieces!!You better think it through!! \"The ceremony didn't continue. He didn't care about the thousands of people kneeling there.He changed his mind.He didn't want Chu Wanning to die.He hated him. He wanted Chu Wanning to live \u2014 to live \u2026He picked up the man who had lost too much blood. Using his lightness skill, he leaped onto the roof. His robes fluttered like the wings of a lone eagle. His figure quickly flew over layers of roofs and went straight to the South Peak \u2014 straight to the Red Lotus Pavilion, the place where Chu Wanning used to live.The spiritual energy there was abundant, and there were many immortal herbs. He wanted to save Chu Wanning.One could only hate when one was alive. If one was dead, there wouldn't be any reason to hate.Was he crazy that he wanted to kill Chu Wanning with his own hands?If Chu Wanning died, then what was left of him in this world \u2026Lying on the bed, he licked his memories alone.It was the middle of the night, but he couldn't sleep anymore.Mo Ran got up, washed his face, put on his clothes, and walked towards the Yama Hall with a wind lantern.Chu Wanning must have just casually bandaged his wounds, and then went there to kneel as punishment.Mo Ran knew him well. He was smelly, stubborn, and inflexible. He never considered whether his body could take it or not. Even if Xue Meng wanted to stop him, he couldn't.Sure enough, when he arrived outside the Yama Hall, he saw a small green lantern burning in solitude. The candle's tears kept falling.Chu Wanning was kneeling with his back facing the door. His figure was tall and straight, as handsome as a pine tree.When he saw this figure, Mo Ran felt a little regret. It was the middle of the night, why did he go there?Looking for Chu Wanning?Was he crazy?But since he was already here, he felt very stupid to just turn around and leave.He thought for a while and came up with a compromise. He gently put the wind lantern by his feet. He didn't plan to leave, nor did he plan to go in. He just stood outside the window, with his elbows on the windowsill and his cheeks on his hands, looking at Chu Wanning from afar.The copper bells on the eaves gently swayed. The night was filled with the fragrance of flowers and plants.The two of them, one standing and one kneeling, were separated by the vermilion window and the empty and quiet hall.If it was before his rebirth, Mo Ran had enough power to barge into the hall and order Chu Wanning to end his reflection and go back to rest.If Chu Wanning was unwilling, he also had enough power to seal Chu Wanning's hands and feet, and violently carry him away.But now, he had neither the power nor the position.He wasn't even as tall as Chu Wanning.Mo Ran's mood was complicated. He looked at the person inside from outside the window, but the person inside didn't notice. He couldn't see Chu Wanning's face, and Chu Wanning also couldn't see his face.So the white cat knelt all night without turning back.So the silly dog also stood all night without going far.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They couldn't be as calm as still water. When their master wasn't paying attention, they would start whispering to each other.The news of Chu Wanning being punished quickly spread.The disciples who witnessed the punishment yesterday were not stingy with sharing the gossip with others.\"Wow, why did you guys only find out so late?Oh \u2026 So Elder Lucun brought you guys to the mountain to pick night dew flowers yesterday?Alright, then you guys missed out on too much!Yesterday evening, in the Green Heaven Hall, blood and flesh flew everywhere. It was too horrible to look at. Elder Yuheng was beaten more than 200 times!More than 200 times!The rod hit his vitals!Merciless! \"Every time that disciple said a sentence, he would put on a particularly exaggerated expression.Accompanied by the exclamations of the surrounding Junior Brothers and Sisters, he was extremely proud.\"Do you guys know what happened to more than 200 times?Even a burly man was beaten to death, not to mention Elder Yuheng. At that time, he couldn't take it and fainted.This made our Young Master so anxious that he rushed up and fought with the Disciplinary Elder. No matter what, he wouldn't let anyone touch Elder Yuheng at all. Aiyo, that scene \u2014 \"His face wrinkled like a bun and winked for a while. In the end, he stretched out a finger and shook it left and right, concluding with three words.\"Tsk, tsk, tsk.\"Immediately, a Junior Sister's face turned pale. \"What!Elder Yuheng fainted? \"\"Young Master and the Disciplinary Elder fought?\"\"No wonder I didn't see Elder Yuheng in the morning class today \u2026 So pitiful \u2026 What did he break?\"\"I heard that he beat the client in a fit of anger.\"\"\u2026\"Such gossip floated into Xue Meng's ears from time to time. The Young Master's temper at the Peak of Life and Death had completely inherited his master's. He was extremely irritable.Unfortunately, there was more than one person discussing this matter. The Good and Evil Platforms were in groups of three to five, and they were all muttering \"Elder Yu Heng is being punished\" and so on. It made him feel very noisy, but there was nothing he could do.While the veins on Xue Meng's forehead were bulging, Mo Ran had not slept the entire night and kept yawning.Xue Meng had no one else to vent his anger on, so he turned to Mo Ran and scolded, \"A day's work depends on the morning. You dog, why are you being lazy so early in the morning?What did Shizun teach you? \"\"Ah?\"Mo Ran's eyes were still drowsy as he yawned again. \"Xue Meng, you're too free, aren't you? It's fine if Shizun scolds me, but who are you? I'm your cousin, so you better behave yourself when talking to your cousin. Don't be impolite.\"Xue Meng said fiercely, \"My cousin is a dog. You can be his dog if you want!\"Mo Ran laughed. \"You're so disobedient and don't respect your elder brother. Shizun will be very disappointed if he finds out.\"\"You still have the face to mention Shizun!Let me ask you, why didn't you stop him when he wanted to go to the Discipline Court yesterday? \"\"Meng Meng, he's Shizun. Wanye Yuheng, Bei Dou Xian Zun, why don't you stop him for me to see?\"Xue Meng flew into a rage. He pulled out his sword and furrowed his brows. \"What the f * ck did you just call me?!!\"Mo Ran rested his chin on his hand and laughed. \"Be good, Meng Meng. Sit down.\"Xue Meng flew into a rage. \"Mo Weiyu, I'll kill you!!\"Shi Mei was sandwiched between the two, listening to their daily bickering. He couldn't help but sigh. He silently held his forehead and tried to concentrate on reading his book. \"When the Sun and Moon Pot is filled, when the spiritual core is first formed.The Dao of Heaven cannot see through it, and life and death participate in the business \u2026 \"Three days passed in the blink of an eye. Chu Wanning finished his reflection.According to the rules, he would be grounded for three months.During this time, he couldn't leave the Peak of Life and Death. He also had to go to the Meng Po Lobby to do odd jobs, clean the pillars of the Bridge of Helplessness, clean the steps in front of the mountain gate, and so on.The Discipline Elder was deeply worried. \"Elder Yu Heng, to be honest, I feel that you shouldn't do these things.You're a Grandmaster. Doing things like washing dishes and wiping floors \u2026 is really unfair. \"There was still half a sentence he didn't say \u2014The main thing is that I really doubt whether you know how to sweep floors, cook, and wash clothes!Chu Wanning didn't doubt himself at all. He obediently reported to the Meng Po Lobby.The Meng Po Lobby, from the manager to the servants, were shocked to hear that Chu Wanning was coming to do odd jobs. They all turned pale with fright, as if they were facing a great enemy.Chu Wanning's white robes fluttered as he floated over.His handsome face was cold and calm, without any expression. If a cloud was added to his feet and a horsetail whisk was added to his arm, he probably wouldn't be any different from an immortal.The Meng Po Lobby manager felt very ashamed and uneasy. He actually had to order such a handsome man to wash vegetables and cook.Chu Wanning didn't have the self-awareness of being a handsome man. He walked into the kitchen and coldly glanced at everyone. Everyone couldn't help but take a step back.\"\u2026\" Chu Wanning went straight to the point. \"What should I do?\"The manager bashfully pinched his clothes and thought for a while. He carefully said, \"Elder, what do you think about washing vegetables?\"Chu Wanning said, \"Okay.\"The manager let out a big sigh of relief. He originally thought that Chu Wanning's ten fingers didn't do any household chores and might not be willing to do such a simple thing. However, other chores were either dirty or required some skill. He was worried that Chu Wanning wouldn't be able to do it well.Since Chu Wanning straightforwardly agreed to wash vegetables, he didn't need to worry anymore.Reality proved that the manager was really too naive.There was a clear stream in front of the Meng Po Lobby. Chu Wanning carried a basket of dark green vegetables and came to the stream. He rolled up his sleeves and began to wash the vegetables.This area was under the jurisdiction of Elder Xuanji. Occasionally, there would be disciples of Xuanji who passed by. When they saw that Chu Wanning was actually washing vegetables, they were so scared that they couldn't speak a complete sentence. They rubbed their eyes three or four times to make sure that they didn't see wrongly. Only then did they say in shock, \"Elder, Elder Xuanji \u2014 \u2014 morning, morning.\"Chu Wanning looked up. \"Morning.\"Elder Xuanji's disciple trembled in fear as he fled.\"\u2026 \u2026\"Chu Wanning was too lazy to be long-winded with them. He continued to peel the vegetables, wash them, and throw them back into the basket.He washed them very seriously. He peeled every single vegetable leaf and brushed them back and forth repeatedly.The result of this was that \u2014 \u2014 it was already noon, but he still hadn't finished washing the basket of vegetables.The waiter in the kitchen was anxious from waiting. He kept walking back and forth in circles. \"What should we do?Why isn't the elder back yet?If he doesn't come back, then the vegetables won't come back. How should we cook beef with vegetables? \"The head steward looked at the sun and said, \"Forget it, let's not wait anymore. Let's change it to braised beef.\"Thus, when Chu Wanning returned, the beef from the Meng Po Lobby was already out of the pot. It was stewed until it was tender and tender. There was no need for vegetables at all.Chu Wanning frowned. He hugged his vegetables and was rather unhappy. He said coldly, \"Why don't you want the vegetables and make me wash them?\"The head steward's hair stood on end. He wiped the cold sweat on his forehead with a handkerchief and said something that he regretted. \"Isn't this because I hope that the elder will personally make a pot of stewed tofu with vegetables?\"Chu Wanning didn't have any expression. He still hugged his vegetables and tilted his head in thought. \"\u2026 \u2026\"The head steward hurriedly said, \"If the elder is unwilling, then it's fine \u2014 \u2014\"Before he could say anything, Chu Wanning asked, \"Where's the tofu?\"The head steward was speechless.\"Elder Yu Heng, do you \u2026 know the way of the kitchen?\"Chu Wanning said, \"It's not that I don't know anything.I can give it a try. \"At noon that day, the disciples entered the Meng Po Lobby happily as usual. They found seats in groups of three to five and went to the counter to get food and rice.The food at the Life and Death Summit was always sumptuous, and today was no exception.The braised beef had the right amount of fat and lean, the shredded pork was fresh and rich, the farmhouse meat was golden and crispy, and the fish with chopped chili was red and attractive.The disciples hurriedly fought for their favorite food, lining up all the way, asking the chef to add an extra spoonful of sweet and sour pork ribs, some gravy on the rice, or some oil and chili.The fastest ones were always the disciples of Elder Lucun. The little guy at the front of the line had a big pimple on his nose, but he was still thinking about the Mapo tofu.He skillfully carried the wooden tray to the last counter and said without looking up, \"Master, I want a bowl of tofu.\"The master's fingers were long and slender, and he handed him a plate full of tofu.However, it wasn't the Mapo tofu he was familiar with.Instead, it was a plate of strange food that was black in color and the ingredients were indistinguishable.The disciple was shocked. \"What is this?\"\"Boiled tofu with vegetables.\"The Meng Po Lobby was noisy, so the disciple didn't pay attention to the person who answered. Instead, he angrily said, \"Do you refine pills?How can this be boiled tofu with vegetables?I don't want it, take it back! \"As he scolded, he glared at the chef. In the end, when he saw the person standing behind the counter, the disciple was so frightened that he screamed and almost knocked over the tray.\"Elder, Elder Yu Heng!\"\"Yes.\"The disciple was about to cry. \"No, I \u2026 I didn't mean it like that.I \u2026 \"\"Since you don't want to eat it, take it back.\" Chu Wanning said expressionlessly, \"Don't waste it.\"The disciple stiffly picked up the plate and stiffly handed it to Chu Wanning. Then, he left with the same hand and foot.After a while, everyone knew that the person standing in front of the last counter was Elder Yu Heng. Thus, the originally lively Meng Po Lobby was instantly silenced.All the disciples were like puppies with fur. They obediently lined up, carried the dishes in a panic, and respectfully went to the last cupboard. They stuttered to greet the Elder, and then staggered away.\"Greetings, Elder Yu Heng.\"\"Yes.\"\"Greetings, Elder Yu Heng.\"\"Greetings.\"\"Thank you, Elder Yu Heng.\"\"\u2026 \u2026\"The disciples were extremely well-behaved and extremely cautious. Thus, Chu Wanning accepted the nervous greetings of every disciple. However, no one dared to rashly try the boiled tofu with vegetables in his pot.Slowly, the line became shorter. The food in front of the other chefs was almost finished. Only Chu Wanning's front was still full. The pot of food was cold, but no one was interested.Chu Wanning's face was expressionless, but his heart was a bit complicated.In any case, he had bathed all morning \u2026 \u2026At this time, his three personal disciples came.Xue Meng was still wearing his silver-blue light armor. He cleaned himself up very refreshingly.He excitedly moved over. \"Shizun!How are you?Does your wound still hurt? \"Chu Wanning was very calm. \"It doesn't hurt.\"Xue Meng: \"That, that's good.\"Chu Wanning glanced at him and suddenly asked, \"Do you eat tofu?\"Xue Meng: \"\u2026 \u2026\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn order to show his sincerity in front of his master, the young master prepared three plates of charred tofu and promised that he would not throw away a single piece. He would eat all of them.Chu Wanning was very satisfied and revealed a rare look of admiration.Mo Ran, who was following behind them, was unhappy when he saw this.The Emperor Ta had an inexplicable obsession with Chu Wanning's approval, so he immediately ordered three servings of tofu.Chu Wanning glanced at him. \"Aren't you full after eating so much?\"Mo Ran and Xue Meng said excitedly, \"Even if you give me three more servings, I can still eat them, let alone three.\"Chu Wanning said indifferently, \"Okay.\"Then he gave Mo Ran six portions of tofu and said, \"You too. Don't waste it.\"Mo Ran: \"\u2026\"Since the other two had already ordered, Shi Mei was no exception. He smiled and said, \"Then \u2026 Shizun, I want three plates too.\"Thus, on the first day after Elder Yu Heng's confinement ended, his three disciples all had stomachaches because they ate something bad.The next day, the Disciplinary Elder found Chu Wanning and tactfully expressed that the Meng Po Lobby did not lack helpers. He asked Chu Wanning to move to the Bridge of Helplessness and help sweep the fallen leaves and clean the pillars.The Bridge of Helplessness was a bridge that connected the main area of the Bridge of Life and Death to the disciples' resting area. It could allow five horse carriages to pass side by side. The pillars of the bridge had nine white jade beasts, each representing the nine sons of the dragon. There were also three hundred and sixty short pillars with lion heads.Chu Wanning silently swept the floor. After he was done, he carefully wiped the Jade Beast.After working for most of the day, when the sky gradually darkened, it began to rain.After class, most of the disciples didn't bring their umbrellas, so they ran back to their residences while wading through the puddles.Raindrops splashed on the stone steps. Chu Wanning glanced from afar and saw the relaxed smiles on the faces of the boys and girls. They looked embarrassed and bright in the rain.\"\u2026\" Chu Wanning knew that if he let them see him, that kind of brightness and relaxation would disappear. Thus, he thought for a moment and went under the bridge.Some of the disciples running in front of him came to the bridge. When they saw the scene, they couldn't help but exclaim.\"A barrier?\"\"Why is there a barrier on the Bridge of Helplessness?\"\"It was probably set up by Elder Xuanji,\" a disciple guessed. \"Elder Xuanji is the best.\"The translucent golden barrier enveloped the top of the Bridge of Helplessness. It extended and spread out in an imposing manner all the way to the main walkway of the disciples' resting area. It completely covered the path they were about to take.\"It must be Elder Xuanji's doing. Isn't this place under his jurisdiction?\".... elder Xuanji....... \"\" This barrier is so beautiful. The elder is really amazing. \"The disciples shook their wet hair and giggled as they pushed each other to hide in the barrier. They talked all the way to the resting area.Chu Wanning stood under the bridge and listened to the hubbub of voices on the bridge. Only when it was silent and the returning youths were far away did he slowly put away the barrier and calmly walked out of the bridge.\"Master.\"Suddenly, he heard someone call him.Chu Wanning suddenly looked up. He didn't see anyone on the shore.\"I'm here.\"He followed the voice and looked up. He saw Mo Ran sitting on the white jade bridge. He was wearing a silver-blue light armor and his legs were lazily propped up on the railing of the bridge.The youth's eyebrows were shockingly dark. His eyelashes were like two small fans hanging in front of his eyes.He was holding an oil paper umbrella and looking at him with a smile that wasn't a smile.One of them was on the bridge, shivering in the leaves.The other was under the bridge, cold rain connecting the river.They looked at each other like this. For a while, no one spoke.Between heaven and earth, the misty rain was hazy and lingering. Occasionally, leaves and thin bamboo fluttered down with the wind and rain, fluttering and falling between the two.In the end, Mo Ran laughed and said with some teasing, \"Elder Xuanji, you're wet.\"Chu Wanning also said coldly almost at the same time, \"How did you know it was me?\"Mo Ran pursed his lips. His eyes were curved and his dimples were deep. \"Such a big barrier. Elder Xuanji can't set it up, right?If it wasn't Master, who else could it be? \"Chu Wanning, \"\u2026 \u2026\"Mo Ran knew that he was too lazy to cast a spell to protect himself from the rain. He had an idea and threw the umbrella down.\"This is for you. Catch.\"The bright red oil paper umbrella fluttered down. Chu Wanning caught it. The green bamboo handle of the umbrella was still warm. Sparkling and translucent drops of water dripped down the umbrella. Chu Wanning looked up at him. \"What about you?\"Mo Ran smiled slyly. \"Master just needs to cast a spell. Won't I be able to go back safely?\"Chu Wanning snorted, but he still flicked his sleeve. A transparent golden barrier immediately appeared above Mo Ran. Mo Ran looked up and laughed. \"Haha, it's so beautiful. There's even a peony pattern. Thank you.\"Chu Wanning glanced at him. \"That's a begonia. It only has five petals.\"After saying this, he floated away in his white robe and red umbrella.Mo Ran was left standing alone in the rain, counting the petals. \"One, two, three, four, five \u2026 \u2026 Ah, it's really five petals \u2026 \u2026\"When he looked up again, Chu Wanning was already far away.Mo Ran narrowed his eyes. Standing under the barrier, the childish smile on his face slowly disappeared. It was gradually replaced by a complicated expression.He suddenly didn't understand what he was thinking.It would be better if the only emotion he had for a person was pure love or pure disgust.This rain lasted for four days before it stopped. When the clouds parted and the rain stopped, a group of horses and carriages stepped on puddles of water, crushing the sky and clouds. They stopped in front of the mountain gate of the Peak of Life and Death.The bamboo curtain was lifted. A folding fan with a bright red tassel appeared from inside.Immediately after, a pair of blue boots with silver edges stepped out. They stepped on the shaft of the carriage and landed heavily on the ground with a bang. Dust flew everywhere.This was a muscular man with thick eyebrows and big eyes. He was dressed in blue and silver light armor and had a neat beard. He looked to be around forty years old.He looked very rough, but his large hands were waving a finely made scholar's fan. It was indescribably strange.The fan opened with a \"pa\" sound. On the side facing the other person was written \u2014 \u2014\"Xue Lang is very beautiful.\"On the side facing the other person was written \u2014 \u2014\"The world is ugly.\"This fan was famous in Jianghu. The reason was not only because the owner of the fan was good at martial arts, but also because the words written on the fan were too embarrassing.It praised oneself on the front and mocked others on the back.When the fan handle was gently waved, the narcissism of the owner could be smelled from a hundred miles away. Everyone in the cultivation world knew this.Who was the owner of this fan?It was the Lord of the Peak of Life and Death who had stayed outside for more than two months. He was Xue Meng's father and Mo Ran's uncle, Master Immortal Xue Zhengyong.As the saying goes, dragons give birth to dragons, phoenixes give birth to phoenixes, and the son of a mouse can dig holes.The reverse logic was the same. If the son was a peacock, the father would definitely spread his tail.Although Xue Meng had delicate features and was completely different from his vigorous and strong father, at the very least, they were similar to each other deep down in their bones.They both felt that \"Xue Lang is very beautiful and the world is ugly.\"Xue Zhengyong stretched his body and moved his muscles. He cracked his neck and said with a smile, \"Oh, this carriage is so tiring. We're finally home.\"In the Dan Xin Palace, Madam Wang was mixing medicinal powder. Mo Ran and Xue Meng were sitting on her left and right respectively.She said softly, \"Four ounces of hemostatic grass and one stalk of Shouyang ginseng.\"\"Mother, I'm done.\" Xue Meng sat cross-legged beside her and handed the herbs to her.Madam Wang took it and smelled the hemostatic grass. Then she said, \"No, this grass has been put together with Guanghu for a long time.The resulting soup will be less effective.Go get some fresh ones. \"\"Oh, okay.\" Xue Meng stood up and went to the medicine cabinet.Madam Wang continued, \"Three ounces of Wulingzhi and one ounces of Chinese dodder.\"Mo Ran quickly handed the ingredients to her. \"Auntie, how long do you need to brew this medicine?\"\"You don't need to brew it. Just take it.\" Madam Wang said, \"After I grind the powder, can Mo Ran give it to Elder Yu Heng?\"Mo Ran didn't want to give it to Xue Meng at first, but after looking at Xue Meng's back, he knew that if he didn't do it, it would be Xue Meng who did.He didn't know why, but he didn't like the idea of Xue Meng being alone with Chu Wanning. So he said, \"Okay.\"After a pause, he asked, \"Oh right, auntie, is this medicine bitter?\"\"It's a little bitter. What's wrong?\"Mo Ran smiled and said, \"Nothing.\" But he grabbed a handful of candies from the fruit platter and stuffed them into his sleeve.The people in the palace were focused on mixing the medicine when a burst of hearty laughter suddenly came from the door.Xue Zhengyong strode into the palace. His face was glowing. He said happily, \"Wife, I'm back!Hahahahaha! \"The leader of a sect came in without any warning. Madam Wang was so shocked that she almost spilled the powder in the ladle.She opened her eyes wide in astonishment. \"Husband?\"Mo Ran also stood up to welcome him. \"Uncle.\"\"Ah, Ran 'er is here too?\"Xue Zhengyong was tall and sturdy, but his speech was very kind. He patted Mo Ran's shoulder. \"Good boy, I haven't seen you for a while. You seem to have grown a little taller.How was it?Did the trip to Colored Butterfly Town go smoothly? \"Mo Ran smiled. \"It went smoothly.\"\"Good, good, good!With Chu Wanning there, I knew that there wouldn't be any problems. Hahahaha \u2014 \u2014 right, where's your master?Is he playing with his little toys in the mountains again? \"Mo Ran heard this and was a little embarrassed. \"Shizun, he \u2026\"This uncle of his had a fiery temper and was easily impulsive. In his previous life, his uncle's death was largely due to this kind of personality.Mo Ran naturally didn't want to directly tell him that Chu Wanning suffered two hundred blows and was grounded for three months.Just as he was thinking about how to tell him, an \"Ah\" sound came from behind him.Xue Meng walked out in a daze with a pile of hemostatic grass. When he saw his father, he couldn't help but be happy. \"Father.\"\"Meng 'er!\"Mo Ran was secretly relieved. When this father and son met, they would definitely flatter each other and praise each other. He was thinking about how to tell them that Chu Wanning was punished.Sure enough, the peacock father and son were praising each other with their tails up.\"After not seeing you for two months, my son has become more handsome.You look more and more like your father! \"Xue Meng didn't look like his father at all. He only looked like his mother, but he agreed and said, \"Father's body has also become more sturdy!\"Xue Zhengyong waved his hand and laughed. \"During this period of time in Kunlun's Treading in Snow Palace, I increasingly feel that all the young people in the world can't compare to my son and nephew!Aiyo, that group of sissy people really annoys me. Meng 'er, do you still remember Mei Hanxue? \"Xue Meng immediately showed a look of disdain. \"That little fatty who has been training in seclusion for more than ten years. I heard that he's the Treading in Snow Palace's eldest martial brother?He's come out? \"\"Hahaha, my son's memory is really good. That's him.When he was young, he came to our house to stay for a while. He even slept with you. \"\"\u2026 How could I not remember? He was as fat as a dog. He even kicked people in his sleep. I was kicked down by him many times.Father, did you see him? \"\"I saw him, I saw him.\" Xue Zhengyong twirled his beard as if he was reminiscing.Xue Meng was a proud son of the heavens. He was naturally competitive, so he impatiently asked, \"How was it?\"Xue Zhengyong laughed. \"If I had to say, he's not as good as you.He's just a boy, but his master taught him to play the zither and dance. He even used Lightness Skill and threw flower petals. Your father is going to die from laughter. Hahahaha! \"Xue Meng's nose twitched. He seemed to be disgusted.A little fatty with baby fat playing the zither, dancing, and throwing flower petals \u2026\"Then what's his cultivation?\"After all, Mei Hanxue had been in seclusion for more than ten years. He had just come out of seclusion a few months ago and had not shown his sword in Jianghu.Since 'appearance' had already defeated him, Xue Meng wanted to compare 'cultivation'.This time, Xue Zhengyong did not immediately answer. He thought for a while and said, \"It's okay to see that he doesn't fight much. Anyway, when the Spiritual Mountain Sword Conference comes, I'll naturally have a chance to compete with him.\"Xue Meng's eyebrows twitched. \"Humph, that fatty. I don't even know if he'll have a chance to compete with me.\"Madam Wang had already added the last of the powder. She stood up and smiled as she patted Xue Meng's head. \"Meng 'er, don't be arrogant. You have to be humble and always have a heart of respect.\"Xue Meng said, \"What's the use of being humble?That's what incompetent people do. I want to be as straightforward as my father. \"Xue Zhengyong laughed. \"See? How can a tiger father have a dog son?\"Madam Wang was displeased. \"You don't teach him the good things, but you teach him the bad things. What are you talking about?\"Xue Zhengyong saw the slight anger on her face and knew that she was indeed unhappy. He stopped smiling and scratched his head. \"My wife, I was wrong.I'll teach you whatever you say. You're always right.Don't be unhappy. \"Mo Ran, \"\u2026\"Xue Meng, \"\u2026\"Madam Wang was Lonemoon's disciple in her early years. It was said that she was kidnapped by Xue Zhengyong. No one knew if this rumor was true, but Mo Ran knew very well that his uncle was very affectionate towards his aunt.Madam Wang, on the other hand, was not that passionate towards her husband. She was an extremely gentle person, but she would always throw tantrums at Xue Zhengyong.After all these years of stumbling and stumbling, anyone with a discerning eye could tell who was more devoted to the other between husband and wife.Xue Meng naturally could not be bothered to watch his parents flirt. He was a little disgusted. He clicked his tongue and impatiently turned to leave.Madam Wang was quite embarrassed. She quickly said, \"Meng 'er?\"Xue Meng waved his hand and strode out.Mo Ran did not want to disturb the couple's reunion. He could also avoid his uncle's questioning.It was better to leave Chu Wanning's punishment to Madam Wang. He would not be able to handle it himself.Thus, he tidied up the medicine on the table and left with a smile. He even closed the door for them.Holding the medicine, he wobbled to the Red Lotus Pavilion.Chu Wanning was injured and his body was a little weak these few days. The barrier around the pavilion had been removed, so he did not know that someone had come.Thus, Mo Ran coincidentally saw this scene \u2026Chu Wanning was currently bathing in the lotus pond.It was fine if he was bathing by himself, but the main thing was, there were actually two other people in the lotus pond used by Elder Yu Heng \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySeparated by layers of lotus leaves, Mo Ran felt like he was struck by lightning in an instant. He froze on the spot in shock. The bottle of mixed feelings in his heart shattered completely. His face was about to crack.Astonishment, anger, jealousy, and irritation exploded like fireworks.He moved his lips, but he was so angry that he couldn't say a word. He didn't realize what he was angry about. There was only one thought in his mind \u2014How can you touch the person I've slept with?Chu Wanning, you extravagant and lascivious man!You actually, actually \u2026He didn't react at all. In this life, Chu Wanning didn't have the slightest emotional entanglement with him. In just an instant, the string in his head snapped.After all, more than ten years, a lifetime, from birth to death.When he was awake, he could still do it with ease and pretend to be calm.However, in the midst of the turmoil and chaos, his true colors were revealed. He still subconsciously believed that Chu Wanning was his.At this time, he clearly realized that he even remembered the taste of Chu Wanning's lips kissing so clearly \u2026 Not to mention those ecstasy entanglement of love and passion.That was something he didn't dare to think about after his rebirth.Until he saw Chu Wanning's naked back, saw that familiar figure, broad shoulders, long legs, tight muscles, thin and strong waist, immersed in the clear water.Those lingering feelings that he deliberately avoided and tried to forget instantly split open the seal and swept over.Mo Ran's scalp went numb.\u2026 He had a reaction to this body.And it was a strong reaction that couldn't be controlled at all. Just looking at it made his lower abdomen burn.When he came back to his senses, he was already angrily shouting, \"Chu Wanning!\"Chu Wanning actually ignored him.Those two people were holding his shoulders, one on the left and one on the right. The mist in the lotus pond was rising, so he couldn't see the specific appearance of the two people.But they were very close, and the distance between them was very ambiguous.Mo Ran cursed inwardly. He actually jumped into the lotus pond with a splash and waded over to Chu Wanning. When he got closer, he discovered that \u2014Those, those were actually two mechas made of metal and nanmu!What was worse was that they seemed to be using the Immortal Qi of the lotus pond to transfer spiritual energy to Chu Wanning. Mo Ran's brainless jump had completely broken the spiritual energy field \u2026It was unknown what kind of formation Chu Wanning had used, but he was in an unconscious state. He was supported by the golden light coming from the two mechas' metal palms. The golden light kept surging upwards and converging on the wound on his shoulder and back. It was obvious that he was being treated.Mo Ran's intrusion caused the golden light to dissipate rapidly. What was even more unexpected was that the array would actually backfire!As the golden light dissipated, Chu Wanning's wounds began to rapidly erode away. He frowned, groaned, and coughed out a mouthful of blood. Then, the scars all over his body began to tear apart. His blood was like a mist, instantly soaking the flower pond.Mo Ran was stunned.This was Chu Wanning's Flower Soul Sacrifice Technique!He realized that he might have \u2026 gotten himself into trouble \u2026Chu Wanning's spiritual energy was dual element metal and wood. The metal spiritual energy was like \"Heaven's Inquisition\", focusing on attack and defense.The wood spiritual energy was used for healing.The Flower Soul Sacrifice Technique was one of them. Chu Wanning could mobilize the spirits of a hundred flowers to heal his wounds.However, during the process, no one could enter the array. Otherwise, the spirits of the plants would disperse. Not only would it not have any healing effect, it would also worsen the injury.In the worst case, Chu Wanning's spiritual energy core could be completely devoured by the spirits of the hundred flowers.Fortunately, Mo Ran had dabbled in the Flower Soul Sacrifice Technique in his previous life. He immediately cut off the spiritual energy flow.Chu Wanning, who had lost the support of the array, immediately collapsed. Mo Ran firmly supported him.The unconscious Shizun's face was pale, his lips were blue, and his body was as cold as ice.Mo Ran carried him to the shore. He didn't have time to look at him. He half carried and half dragged Chu Wanning back to the bedroom and placed him on the bed.\"Shizun?Shizun! \"He called out a few times, but Chu Wanning's eyelashes didn't even flutter. Other than the slight rise and fall of his chest, he looked no different from a dead person.This Chu Wanning made Mo Ran think of his previous life.He inexplicably felt his throat dry up, and his heart panicked.In his previous life, two people had died in Mo Ran's arms.Shi Mei.Chu Wanning.Of the two of them, one was the lover of his dreams, and the other was the enemy of his life.After Shi Mei left, there was no more Mo Weiyu in this world.What about Chu Wanning?Mo Ran didn't know. He only remembered that day. He held the person in his arms, bit by bit, cold. He didn't cry, nor did he laugh. Both joy and sorrow became distant and unreachable.After Chu Wanning left, Mo Weiyu didn't know what was in this world anymore.The candles were bright, illuminating Chu Wanning's naked upper body.Wanye Yuheng usually wore very tight clothes. His collar was folded tight and high, and his waist was wrapped in three bands. He was upright and restrained.Because of this, no one had ever seen the extent of his injuries after two hundred beatings \u2026Although Mo Ran had personally seen Chu Wanning's back when he was punished at the Discipline Court that day, he only knew that it was bloody and extremely tragic.But later on, he saw Chu Wanning wandering around as if nothing had happened. He thought that he probably didn't hurt his muscles or bones.Only now did he realize that Chu Wanning's injuries were much more serious than he had imagined.The five wounds left by the ghost master had all opened up. In the deepest part, one could clearly see the eerie white bone.Chu Wanning probably didn't ask anyone to help him change the dressing. He did it himself. The ointment was not evenly applied. Some places that couldn't be reached had already become inflamed and festered.Not to mention the blue and purple marks from the beatings.It covered the entire back. There was almost no intact skin or flesh. In addition to the backlash from the formation just now, Chu Wanning's wounds were all torn open. Blood gurgled and quickly dyed the blanket under his body mottled.If he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, Mo Ran wouldn't have believed that the person who insisted on wiping the pillars of the bridge and opening the huge rain-blocking barrier for the disciples was the person in front of him \u2014 the person who could be classified as \"old, disabled, sick, and weak\".If it weren't for the fact that Chu Wanning was unconscious, Mo Ran would have grabbed him by the collar and questioned him.Chu Wanning, do you have an ego problem?Just lower your head and give in, who will stop you?Why do you have to be so stubborn? You're an adult, why don't you know how to take care of yourself and treat yourself better?Why don't you ask others to help you apply the ointment?Why would you rather let two mechas help you cast the healing formation than ask others for help?Chu Wanning, are you stupid?!Are you stubborn to death?He cursed in his heart as he quickly pressed the acupoints to stop the bleeding.Then, he fetched some hot water and helped Chu Wanning wipe the blood on his back \u2026The sharp knife quenched the fire and cut off the completely rotten flesh.The first time, Chu Wanning groaned in pain. His body instinctively bounced up.Mo Ran held him down and said unhappily, \"What are you groaning for?!Do you want to be f * cked?If you groan again, I'll stab you in the chest. Once you're dead, it won't hurt anymore! \"It was only at times like this that Mo Ran could reveal his ferocious nature and shout at him like he did in his previous life.However, there were too many white and rotten wounds. Chu Wanning kept gasping for breath as the wounds were cleaned up bit by bit.Even if this person was unconscious, he would try to suppress his pain and endure it. He wouldn't shout in pain, but his whole body was covered in cold sweat. His body that had just been cleaned was soaked in sweat again.After busying himself for more than an hour, he finally finished applying the ointment and bandaging the wounds.Mo Ran helped Chu Wanning put on his underwear and carried a thick quilt to cover his teacher who was burning hot. Only then did he heave a sigh of relief.He remembered that the medicine that Madam Wang mixed was still sealed in the oil paper bag. He took some water to make a bowl of medicine and brought it to Chu Wanning's bedside.\"Here, drink the medicine.\"He picked up the unconscious person with one hand and let him rest on his shoulder. He scooped up the medicine and blew on it, then tried to take a sip.Mo Ran immediately frowned, his face scrunched up like a bun. \"What the hell? Why is it so bitter?\" However, he still let it cool down and fed it to Chu Wanning.In the end, after just half a spoonful, Chu Wanning couldn't take it anymore and spat out the medicine. Most of it splashed onto Mo Ran's clothes.Mo Ran was speechless.He knew that Chu Wanning didn't like bitter food and was even afraid of it.However, if he was awake, the stubborn Elder Yu Heng would definitely hold back his disgust and drink the medicine in one gulp. At most, he would put on a straight face and secretly eat a piece of candy afterwards.Unfortunately, Chu Wanning was currently unconscious.Mo Ran had no choice. He couldn't lose his temper at an unconscious person, so he could only be patient and feed him small mouthfuls. From time to time, he would use a handkerchief to wipe the medicine at the corner of his mouth.This wasn't a difficult task for Mo Ran. After all, in his previous life, there was a period of time when he fed Chu Wanning medicine every day. At that time, Chu Wanning would resist and Mo Ran would slap him, then grab his chin and fiercely kiss him. His tongue would wreak havoc and invade, filling the air with blood \u2026He didn't dare to think too deeply about it. Mo Ran was a little careless with the last few spoonfuls of medicine. Almost half of it was spat out by Chu Wanning.Then, he put him on the bed and roughly twisted the blanket.\"I'm doing my best. Don't kick the blanket away at night. You're already hot, if you accidentally catch a cold \u2026\"Halfway through his rambling, he suddenly lost his temper and kicked the bed leg.\"Forget it, what does it have to do with me whether you catch a cold or not?I can't wait for you to get worse and worse. It would be best if you died of illness. \"After he finished speaking, he turned and left.When he reached the door, he felt that his heart was hanging in the air, so he turned back. After thinking for a while, he helped him extinguish the candle.Then, he left again.This time, he walked to the Red Lotus Pond and looked at the water lilies that had become more beautiful after absorbing Chu Wanning's blood. The irritation in his chest only increased.He flew into a rage out of humiliation, but he returned to the bedroom with the same hand and foot.Like a rusty and old robot, he walked around the room in a circle. In the end, he reluctantly stood beside Chu Wanning's bed.The moonlight scattered through the bamboo window that was half open. The silver light soaked Chu Wanning's handsome face.His lips were light and his eyebrows were slightly furrowed.Mo Ran thought for a while, then closed the window for him.Sichuan was very humid. Sleeping with the window open at night was not good for people.After doing this, Mo Ran swore to himself, \"I'm going to kill you.If he turned back from the door again, he would be a dog!However, when they reached the door, Chu Wanning kicked the blanket down with a bang.Mo Ran: \"\u2026\"So how could he change this person's habit of kicking the blanket when he sleeps?In order not to be a dog, the 16-year-old Celestial Trampling Emperor had a backbone and endured it before leaving.He was a man of his word. He would never turn back from the door again!Therefore, after a while.\u2014 \u2014 The wise and mighty Emperor opened the window and came in through it.Picking up the blanket on the floor, he covered Chu Wanning with it. Mo Ran listened to Chu Wanning's painful groans and his back twitching. Seeing him curled up in the corner of the bed, he no longer looked as fierce as he usually did.While he scolded, \"Serves him right\", he also felt compassion for him.He sat beside Chu Wanning's bed and watched over him.He didn't let her kick the blanket down again.It was late at night. After a tiring day, Mo Ran finally couldn't take it anymore. He slowly tilted his head and fell asleep.He didn't sleep well. Chu Wanning kept tossing and turning. Mo Ran seemed to hear him groaning in a daze.Mo Ran was in a daze. He couldn't tell what time it was. He didn't know when, but he naturally lay beside Chu Wanning and hugged the person who was convulsing and trembling.He closed his sleepy eyes and subconsciously stroked his back. He held him in his arms and whispered, \"Okay, okay, it doesn't hurt anymore \u2026 it doesn't hurt anymore \u2026\"Mo Ran murmured in his sleep. It was as if he had returned to the peak of life and death in his previous life, back to the desolate and empty Wu Mountain Palace.Since Chu Wanning's death, no one slept with him in his arms.Even if it was because of hatred, in the cold day after day, it made his heart ache. He missed it so much that thousands of ants gnawed at his heart.But no matter how much he missed it, Chu Wanning couldn't come back.He lost the last flame in his life.That night, Mo Ran hugged Chu Wanning. Half asleep, half dreaming. Sometimes he knew that he had regained his life, and sometimes he knew that he was still in his past life.He suddenly didn't dare to open his eyes. He was afraid that when he woke up tomorrow, there would only be an empty pillow and a cold curtain.In a long life, he was the only one left.There was no doubt that he hated Chu Waning.But when he hugged the person in his arms, the corners of his eyes were a little wet.That was the warmth that the 32 year old Emperor Ta thought he would never find again.\"Wanning, it doesn't hurt anymore \u2026\"His consciousness was hazy. Mo Ran stroked the hair of the person in his arms like he did before his rebirth. He murmured softly. An extremely gentle sentence, just like that, came out of his mouth.He was so sleepy that he didn't even realize what he had said. He didn't even think when he said those words. They just slipped naturally. Mo Ran's breathing became even and he fell deeper into his dream.Early the next morning, Chu Wanning's eyelashes fluttered and he slowly woke up.His cultivation level was high, and the fever he had last night had subsided.Chu Wanning sleepily opened his eyes. His consciousness was still a little hazy. When he was about to get up, he suddenly realized that someone was lying on the same bed as him.\u2026 \u2026 Mo Weiyu???This was a big shock.Chu Wanning's face instantly turned pale, but he couldn't remember what had happened last night. What was worse was that when he moved, he also woke up Mo Ran.The young man yawned. His smooth and delicate face had a healthy flush that was unique to sleeping soundly. He opened his eyes in a daze and glanced at Chu Waning casually. He said vaguely, \"Ah \u2026 let me sleep for a while more \u2026 Since you're awake, go and cook me a bowl of egg drop and lean meat porridge to eat \u2026\"\"\u2026\" Chu Wanning was speechless.What nonsense was that? Sleep talk?Mo Ran was still in a daze. Seeing that Chu Wanning didn't move, he didn't urge him to wake up and make porridge. Instead, he smiled lazily, stretched out his hand, and pulled Chu Wanning's face over, kissing him on the lips in a familiar manner.\"It's fine if you don't wake up. I just had a nightmare. In the dream \u2026 sigh \u2026 let's not talk about it.\" He sighed and hugged the man who was completely stiff.He rubbed his chin against the top of the man's head and muttered, \"Chu Wanning, let me hug you again.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChu Wanning's divine sense was shattered by the sudden kiss, so how could he still realize what Mo Ran was mumbling? He only felt that every word was buzzing, and his ears felt like it was raining.Mo Ran, on the other hand, was calm and collected. He mumbled a few words, then fell back into a deep sleep.\"\u2026 \u2026\"Chu Wanning wanted to wake him up.However, the begonia tree outside the window of the bed was blooming just right.Just as Chu Wanning raised his hand, a pale pink begonia flower landed lightly on the tip of Mo Ran's nose.\"\u2026 \u2026\"Mo Ran sniffled uncomfortably, but he was sleeping so soundly that he did not wake up.Thus, the hand that had reached out to push her changed direction. Chu Wanning plucked the begonia and pinched it between her fingers to examine it carefully.As he looked at the flower, he was lost in thought. Slowly, he more or less remembered.He vaguely remembered that yesterday, it was Mo Ran who cleaned his wounds and fed him medicine.After that, Mo Ran seemed to have hugged him, stroking his hair and back in the long night, and whispering in his ear.Chu Wanning was in a daze for a while. He thought that this should be his dream, right?The tip of his ears unconsciously turned crimson, like the begonia flower that stopped at the tip of his finger, the brilliant color of the flower.He forcefully swallowed the words of reprimand.He really \u2026 didn't know what to say.\"Why are you sleeping here?\"It sounded like a young woman who had lost her footing.\"Get off the bed, who let you sleep here!\"It sounded like a shrew who had lost her footing.\"You dare to kiss me?\"In fact, it was just a brush of the lips. Compared to the time in the illusion, it really couldn't be considered a kiss. If he was calculative, it would be more obvious.\"\u2026 \u2026\"Elder Yu Heng didn't know what to do. He could only silently roll on the bed and bury his face in the blanket.His slender fingers grabbed the corner of the blanket, somewhat irritated and angry.In the end, he chose to pry open Mo Ran's arms and legs. He sat up, tidied himself up, and then shook the other person awake.Thus, when Mo Ran opened his sleepy eyes, he saw Elder Yu Heng sitting by the bed with an unfathomable and cold expression.Cold sweat immediately poured down.\"Shizun, I \u2014 \u2014\"Chu Wanning said indifferently, \"You broke my Flower Soul Enchantment yesterday?\"\"I didn't do it on purpose \u2026 \u2026\"\"Forget it.\" Chu Wanning was very cold, as if nothing had happened, \"You quickly get up.To go to your morning class. \"Mo Ran was on the verge of breaking down. He rubbed his hair anxiously. \"Why am I sleeping here \u2026\"\"I'm tired.\" Chu Waning was very calm. \"Looking at you, you must have been busy for a long time yesterday.\"As he spoke, he glanced at the medicine cup on the table and said, \"In the future, don't enter the Red Lotus Pavilion without permission. If you have any problems, report to me in advance.\"\"Yes, Master.\"\"You may leave.\"The Emperor Ta felt that he had saved his life and hurriedly ran away.After he left, Chu Wanning lay back on the bed and opened his palm. Through the gaps between his fingers, he looked at the brilliant flowers outside the window. The wind blew and the flowers fell, and fragrant snow fell.The soft color of the begonia was like a fragmented memory from last night.It was very light, but it was hard to tell whether it was real or not.He decided that he would never bring up yesterday's matter.It was too embarrassing!!!Elder Yu Heng valued his face like gold. He valued his face more than his life.Thus, when Mo Ran saw Chu Wanning again a few days later, Elder Yu Heng was still as calm as before. His bearing was calm, noble, and elegant, and his white clothes fluttered in the wind.Neither of them brought up that night of snuggling.Only when their gazes met did Mo Ran's gaze seem to linger on Chu Wanning for a while before habitually chasing after Shi Mei.But what about Chu Wanning?When he met Mo Ran's gaze, he would immediately turn his head away coldly.Then, when the other party was not aware, he would inadvertently glance at him again.Xue Zhengyong soon learned that Chu Wanning was punished.Sure enough, the Supremacy at the peak of life and death immediately flared up in anger.But this rage was not suitable for anyone, so he could only shut the door and sulk with himself.\u2014 \u2014 If he had known, he would have added a rule when he set the rules: The law is inferior to the elders.Madam Wang brewed a pot of tea and spoke to him in a soft voice for a long time. Only then did Xue Zhengyong calm down, but he still said, \"Elder Yu Heng is stubborn. If he does this again in the future, you must help me persuade him.He's a Grandmaster that the sects in the Upper Cultivation World can't even get, but he's suffering under me. How can my conscience be at ease? \"Madam Wang said, \"It's not that I don't want to persuade him, but you also know how stubborn Elder Yu Heng is.\"Xue Zhengyong said, \"Forget it, forget it. Wife, bring me some of those muscle revitalization and pain relievers. I'll go take a look at Yu Heng.\"\"The white ones should be taken orally, the red ones should be applied externally.\"Madam Wang handed two small porcelain bottles to Xue Zhengyong and said, \"I heard Ran Er say that Elder Yu Heng has been cleaning lions at the Bridge of Helplessness for the past few days. You should be able to find him there.\"Xue Zhengyong carried the porcelain bottles and sprinted to the vicinity of the jade bridge.Chu Wanning was there as expected. It was currently afternoon, and the disciples were all busy cultivating. Very few people passed by the Bridge of Helplessness.Chu Wanning was the only one standing alone on the winding jade bridge. His figure was tall and straight, and he had a natural strength of character.The leaves on both sides of the bridge rustled. His white robes were trimmed with bamboo, and he looked like a gentleman.Xue Zhengyong walked over and laughed heartily, \"Elder Yu Heng, are you admiring the fish?\"Chu Wanning turned his face, \"My Lord is joking. This river is connected to the Yellow Springs of the Ghost World. How can there be fish here?\"\"Haha, I'm just joking with you.You're too elegant, but not humorous enough. If you continue like this, you won't be able to get a wife. \"Chu Wanning, \"\u2026\"\"Here, medicine for injuries. My wife made it.The white ones should be taken orally, and the red ones should be applied externally.It's very useful.I'll give it to you. \"\"\u2026\" Chu Wanning did not want to accept it at first, but when he saw that Xue Zhengyong was rather proud of himself and seemed to cherish the medicine made by his wife, he could not refuse. Thus, he accepted it and said lightly, \"Thank you.\"Xue Zhengyong was a rough man, but he was rather reserved in front of Chu Wanning. There were many things that he did not dare to casually talk about. After thinking for a while, he picked a topic, \"Yu Heng, the Spiritual Mountain Sword Conference will be held in three years. At that time, the young talents of various sects will gather and compete. What do you think Meng 'er and Ran' er's chances of winning?\"Chu Wanning said, \"It's hard to say what will happen in three years.I only know that for now, Mo Ran does not seek to improve, and Xue Meng underestimates his opponent.Neither of them should be like this. \"His words were straightforward, harsh, and did not beat around the bush.Xue Zhengyong's face was a little embarrassed. He muttered, \"Ah, they're just children \u2026\"Chu Wanning said, \"They're already in their twenties. They're not young anymore.\"Xue Zhengyong said, \"That's true, but they're not even twenty yet. As their father and uncle, I can't help but be biased. Haha.\"Chu Wanning said, \"It's the father's fault if the son doesn't teach. It's the teacher's fault if the son doesn't teach strictly.If these two go on the wrong path in the future, it's our responsibility. How can we be biased? \"\"\u2026\"Chu Wanning said again, \"My Lord, do you still remember that Linyi Confucian Wind Sect also had two geniuses back then?\"When he mentioned this, Xue Zhengyong's heart could not help but sink.More than twenty years ago, Linyi Confucian Wind Sect, the biggest sect in the upper cultivation world, had a pair of brothers. Both of them were young and talented. They could subdue a hundred-year-old demon on their own at the age of ten. At the age of fifteen, they could already create their own spells and establish their own sect.However, two tigers could not live on one mountain. Because both of them were outstanding, in the end, the brothers fought against each other.During the Spirited Mountain Sword Conference, the younger brother was despised by all sects and elders because he spied on his elder brother's spells and Tantric Buddhism.After the conference, the younger brother was immediately punished by his father. He was proud and arrogant and could not take setbacks. From then on, he harbored hatred in his heart and specialized in the Dao of Deceit. In the end, he degenerated into a deranged devil.Chu Wanning mentioned this old incident at this time undoubtedly to tell Xue Zhengyong that although Xue Meng and Mo Ran were outstanding, their temperament was more important than spells.Unfortunately, Xue Zhengyong was strict with himself and serious with his disciples, but he was muddle-headed with his son and nephew to the point of spoiling them. Therefore, he did not listen to Chu Wanning's words. He only laughed and said, \"With Elder Yu Heng's guidance, they won't walk the same path as those two brothers.\"Chu Wanning shook his head.\"Human nature is stubborn. If you don't make up your mind, it won't be easy to change.\"When he said this, Xue Zhengyong couldn't help but feel uneasy. He didn't know if Chu Wanning was implying something.After hesitating for a while, he couldn't help but say, \"Yu Heng, aren't you a little \u2026 ah, I said, don't be angry. Are you looking down on my nephew?\"Chu Wanning did not mean this. He didn't think that Xue Zhengyong would misunderstand so much. He choked for a moment.Xue Zhengyong said worriedly, \"Actually, I don't really care if they can make a name for themselves in three years.Especially Ran Er. He suffered a lot since he was young and his personality is unavoidably stubborn. I hope you don't dislike him because he grew up in a restaurant.Ah, he's the only flesh and blood my elder brother left in this world. I've always felt guilty towards him \u2026 \"Chu Wanning interrupted Xue Zhengyong, saying, \"Lord misunderstands. I won't look down on him.If I cared about Mo Ran's background, I wouldn't be willing to take him as my disciple. \"Seeing that he was straightforward and firm, Xue Zhengyong said happily, \"That's good, that's good.\"Chu Wanning's gaze once again landed on the surging river under the bridge. He watched the surging waves, the clamoring of the waves, and didn't say anything else.Unfortunately, their conversation on the bridge and Chu Wanning's confession were easily swallowed by the waves, just like in his previous life.In the end, no one else heard him saying that he didn't dislike Mo Ran.Three months passed in the blink of an eye.On this day, Chu Wanning summoned his three disciples to the Red Lotus Pavilion and said, \"Your spiritual cores have stabilized. I called you here today to bring you to Xuying Peak and try to summon your weapons.\"Upon hearing this, Xue Meng and Shi Mei opened their eyes wide. They were overjoyed.Xuying Peak was the holy mountain of the upper cultivation world. It was a thousand feet tall and ten thousand feet tall.According to legend, Xuying Peak was once the place where the God Gouchen Upper Palace forged his sword.The Gouchen Upper Palace was the God of Weapons. It was in charge of the North and South Celestial Poles and ruled all the weapons in the world.When the Celestial Ruler eliminated the demons, the Gouchen Upper Palace used the mountain as its foundation, the lake and the sea as its pool, and its own divine blood as the fire to forge the first real \"sword\" in the world. This sword penetrated the heavens and the earth. When it struck, the Divine Land was torn apart and the seawater flowed backward.With the \"sword\" in hand, the Celestial Ruler suppressed the demons under the earth within two moves. From then on, it was impossible for them to rise again.And those two moves traversed the territory of the human world, creating two ferocious deep ravines.After this battle, it rained heavily for thousands of years. The deep trenches created by the two divine swords were filled with rainwater. Since then, they became the Yangtze River and the Yellow River that gave birth to countless creatures.As for Xuying Peak, where the divine sword broke the world, it became a sacred place for cultivators of the later generations to worship.The spiritual energy left behind by the ancient gods was very rich. Until today, there were still countless mysterious spirits and strange flowers growing in the mountains.Countless cultivators saw through the Dao at Xuying Peak and ascended.However, to the people of the world, the biggest attraction of this strange peak where the divine sword was forged was its \"Jincheng Pool\".It was an ice pool at the top of Xuying Peak that was frozen all year round.Legend has it that in order to create a divine sword, the Gouchen Upper Palace cut open his palm and squeezed in his own divine blood. A drop of his blood splashed onto the low-lying area of the mountain peak. Even after millions of years, the divine blood did not dry up. It became this clear golden pool that was surrounded by the later generations.Regardless of whether this legend was true or not, the wonders of the Jincheng Pool were not lies.Although it was frozen all year round, there were very few Daoists who could use the power of their Spirit Cores to temporarily melt the water in the pool. Then, an ancient beast would leap out of the pool with a weapon in its mouth and offer it to the people on the shore.Xue Meng couldn't wait to ask, \"Shizun, when you took the Divine Martial Skill, what kind of ancient beast jumped out?\"Chu Wanning said, \"Kun Peng.\"When Xue Meng heard this, his eyes flashed with enthusiasm, \"That's great!I can see the Kun Peng now! \"Mo Ran mocked, \"Wait until you melt the lake water first.\"\"What do you mean?Do you think I can't melt the Jincheng Pool? \"Mo Ran laughed, \"Aiya, why are you angry? I didn't say that.\"Chu Wanning said, \"It might not be the Kun Peng that comes out of the lake with a weapon. It is said that there are hundreds of divine beasts living in the Jincheng Pool that protect the Spirit of the Divine Martial. As long as one of them likes you, it will find the weapon that it can get and offer it to the people on the shore.Moreover, these divine beasts have different temperaments and will give you all kinds of requests. If you can't fulfill them, they will take the weapon and return to the bottom of the lake. \"Xue Meng asked curiously, \"Is that so?Master, what did the Kun Peng ask you for? \"Chu Wanning said, \"It said it wanted to eat meat buns.\"The three disciples were stunned for a moment and then laughed. Xue Meng said, \"I was scared to death, I thought it was something difficult.\"Chu Wanning also smiled faintly and said, \"I was just lucky.These Mythological Beasts have all kinds of strange requests. I once heard that someone summoned a Xi Shu, and that little rat asked that person to marry his wife to it. That person did not agree, so the Xi Shu took the weapon and left. From then on, that person never had the opportunity to obtain the Divine Martial Skill. \"Shi Mei murmured, \"That's such a pity \u2026\"Chu Wanning looked at him and said, \"What's so pitiful about it?I respect him as a gentleman. \"Shi Mei hurriedly said, \"Master misunderstood, that's not what I meant.A wife can't be exchanged with any powerful weapon, I just feel that it's a pity that he missed out on such a divine weapon. \"Chu Wanning said, \"This is just a rumor, it's a pity that I don't have the chance to meet such a person.Many years ago in the Jin Cheng Lake, I saw what it meant by 'the human heart is terrible,' dirty my eyes. \"He paused, as if he remembered something, and there was a faint haze between his eyebrows.\"Forget it, let's not talk about it.In these thousands of years, the Jin Cheng Lake has witnessed how many people's hearts haven't changed, and how many people's hearts have been exposed.In front of the Divine Martial, how many people can give up the opportunity to become a Celestial Venerable and stick to their hearts without hesitation \u2026?Hehe. \"Chu Wanning sneered twice, as if something in his memory had touched his reverse scale. His expression gradually became indifferent, and his lips finally closed, he closed his mouth and didn't say anything.His sword-like eyebrows were slightly knitted. Looking at his expression, he seemed to be a little disgusted.\"Master, it's said that the Divine Martial of the Jin Cheng Lake each has its own temper. Did you use it well at the beginning?\" Xue Meng saw that he was unhappy, so he changed the topic and asked.Chu Wanning raised his eyelids and said lightly, \"I have three Divine Martial, which one do you think?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOnly Chu Wanning could calmly recite such a heaven-shaking, earth-shattering sentence.When the three disciples heard this, they all had different feelings in their hearts.Xue Meng's thoughts were the simplest. He only had one exclamation: Ah!Mo Ran's thoughts were a little more complicated. He thought of something from his previous life. He pinched his chin and thought that he did not want to see Chu Wanning's third weapon in this life.As for Shi Mei, he tilted his head. His pair of apricot eyes flashed with a faint light, as if he was admiring and fascinated.\"Did you get Heaven's Inquisition from the Jincheng Pool?\"Chu Wanning: \"Yes.\"\"Then the other two \u2026\"Chu Wanning: \"One is, the other isn't.Weapons are usually not too fierce and can be controlled. You don't have to worry too much. \"Xue Meng sighed with some envy: \"I really want to see Shizun's other two divine weapons.\"Chu Wanning said: \"Heaven's Inquisition is enough to deal with ordinary matters. As for the other two, I would rather they never have a chance to use their skills.\"Xue Meng reluctantly agreed, but his eyes still flashed. Chu Wanning saw it and knew that Xue Meng's love for martial arts was hard to suppress. Fortunately, Xue Meng was not a bad person. With a little guidance, there was no need to worry too much.Mo Ran rubbed his chin at the side and smiled faintly.He knew that weapons were lethal weapons and saints had no choice but to use them.Chu Wanning \u2026 no matter in his previous life, he had lost because of his righteousness.It was written in the books that evil could not prevail over good, but this fool took it seriously. He deserved to be so talented and powerful, but he still became a prisoner and a skeleton in a grave.\"Shizun.\" Shi Mei's voice interrupted Mo Ran's reverie.\"I heard that every year, hundreds and thousands of people go to Sunrise Peak to learn martial arts, but only one or two people have the opportunity to melt the Jincheng Pool. It has even been years since the pool has been frozen.Disciple's cultivation base is too shallow \u2026 It is truly \u2026 impossible for me to meet a good match.Mo Ran, Young Master, and the others are all outstanding talents in the Human Realm. Why don't I stay here and practice more basic spells? \"Chu Wanning: \"\u2026\"He didn't say anything. His porcelain-like face was shrouded in a thin layer of mist. He seemed to be pondering.In his previous life, Shi Mei had given up the opportunity to go to the Rising Sun Peak because of his low self-esteem. Seeing this, Mo Ran immediately smiled and said, \"I'm just going to give it a try. If I don't succeed, I'll just treat it as a trip.What are you doing all day at the peak of life and death? You should go out and see the world. \"Shi Mei became more and more anxious. \"No, my cultivation base is too weak. There are so many people on the Rising Sun Peak. If I run into disciples from other sects and they want me to spar with them, I'm sure I won't be able to beat them. I'll only embarrass Master \u2026\"Chu Wanning looked up and said, \"Are you afraid of this?\"His question was very strange. It sounded like a question, but also like a rhetorical question.The other two didn't feel anything, but Shi Mei felt a chill in his heart. He looked up and met Chu Wanning's cold and sharp gaze.\"Master \u2026\"Chu Wanning's expression didn't change. He said, \"You're majoring in healing, so you're not good at sparring with others.If someone pesters you, just refuse. It won't be embarrassing. \"Mo Ran also grinned. \"Shi Mei, don't be afraid. I'm here.\"So they packed up and the three of them went on their way.This time, they were going to the Upper Cultivation World. The journey was long and it was too tiring to ride a horse.Chu Wanning was still unwilling to fly on his sword, so the carriage traveled leisurely for more than ten days before they finally arrived at a town next to the Rising Sun Peak.The three disciples had already come out of the carriage. Only Chu Wanning was too lazy to move. He lifted the bamboo curtain of the carriage and said, \"Let's rest here for a night. Tomorrow, we'll walk some more and we'll reach the Rising Sun Peak.\"The city they were resting in was called Dai City.Although the city wasn't big, it was very rich and bustling. The women were dressed in jade, and the men were wearing brocade hats and silk clothes. It was even more luxurious than the richest place in the Lower Cultivation World.Xue Meng spat, \"Those bastards in the Upper Cultivation World. They're really a bunch of rich people. Wine and meat stink, and bones freeze to death on the road.\"Mo Ran also didn't like it, so he didn't refute Xue Meng. Instead, he smiled sweetly and ridiculed the scene in front of him. \"Yeah, I'm so jealous. No wonder so many people are racking their brains to move to the Upper Cultivation World. Even if they don't cultivate and are just ordinary people, their lives are much better than those in the Lower Cultivation World.\"Chu Wanning took out a silver mask and put it on his face. He then slowly got off the carriage and looked at the bustling streets around him. No one knew what he was thinking.Xue Meng asked curiously, \"Master, why do you have to wear a mask?\"Chu Wanning said, \"This is the territory of the Linyi Confucian Wind Sect.It's inconvenient for me to show my face. \"Seeing that Xue Meng was still puzzled, Mo Ran sighed and said, \"Little Phoenix, you don't have a brain. Master used to be a guest elder of the Linyi Confucian Wind Sect.\"When he said that, Xue Meng finally remembered. However, this proud son of heaven wasn't willing to admit that he had forgotten this. His face flushed red, he rolled his eyes and said, \"This, this, of course I know. I'm just curious. He's just a guest elder. It's not like he was sold to them. They can't just leave whenever they want to. Don't tell me that the Confucian Wind Sect's people would kidnap Master and bring him back if they saw him?\"Mo Ran said, \"You're really stupid. Haven't you heard?Ever since Master left, very few people in the Upper Cultivation World know his whereabouts after the Confucian Wind Sect. When we go down the mountain to kill demons, if someone asks about our master, don't we just say that we're at the peak of life and death and never say who our master is? \"Xue Meng was stunned for a moment. Only then did he realize, \"So Master's whereabouts are a mystery in the Upper Cultivation World?But if Master is so powerful, why would he hide his whereabouts? \"\"He didn't deliberately hide it, but he also didn't want to be disturbed.\" Chu Wanning said, \"Let's go and check in.\"\"Hey, the four Immortals want to check in?\" The inn's waiter ran over with an oily face.Xue Meng said, \"We want four of the best rooms.\"The waiter rubbed his hands and said with a smile, \"I'm really sorry, Immortals. Um, Dai City's guest rooms are a bit tight these days. We can't spare four rooms. How about we have to trouble the Immortals to put together a room?How about two rooms? \"There was no other way. They could only make do with a place to stay.However, there was a small problem when they were assigning rooms.\u2014 \u2014\"I want to share a room with Shi Mei.\" While Chu Wanning was paying the bill, the three disciples gathered together and Mo Ran firmly said.Xue Meng couldn't accept it. \"Why should I?\"Mo Ran said curiously, \"Don't you like to stick to Master?\"\"Then, then I don't want to \u2014\"He respected Chu Wanning very much, but the word 'reverence' couldn't do without the word 'fear'. He couldn't tell whether he liked or feared Chu Wanning more.Seeing Xue Meng's face turn red, Mo Ran said with a sly smile, \"Little brother, I think it's not that you don't want to sleep with Master, but that you don't dare to, right?\"Xue Meng's eyes widened. \"Master won't eat people, why wouldn't I dare!\"\"Oh.\" Mo Ran said with a smile, \"But Master likes to hit people in his dreams, did you know that?\"Xue Meng: \"\u2026\"His face turned green and white. Xue Meng suddenly thought of something and asked angrily, \"How do you know what Master is like when he's asleep?Have you slept with him before? \"These words were a bit ambiguous. Even though Xue Meng himself didn't have any evil intentions, the speaker didn't mean anything, but the listener took it seriously.Mo Ran thought to himself, 'Not only did I sleep with him, I even slept with him in my past life.'But a real man doesn't mention his past achievements. He still smiled and said, \"If you don't believe me, you can feel it tonight.Remember to bring a bottle of Jinchuang Ointment, it can be used to treat any injuries. \"Xue Meng was about to explode, but Chu Wanning had already paid the bill and walked over.He looked at them indifferently and said, \"Let's go.\"The three youths followed behind Master like little tails. When they stood in front of the guest rooms, the three of them who were originally arguing happily all lowered their heads and waited for Chu Wanning to speak.In reality, their argument just now was useless. When it was time to arrange the rooms, they all shut up and waited for Master to speak.Chu Wanning paused and said, \"There are only two rooms left, which one of you \u2026\"He hesitated inwardly and felt a bit awkward.What should he say \u2014 \"Who's willing to stay with me?\"They all sounded a bit cautious and pitiful, which was really not Elder Yu Heng's style.Then what should he say?\"Mo Weiyu, you come with me.\" Like this?\u2026 Forget it, with a spiked club and a tiger skin, there was no difference between him and the Black Wind Stronghold's chief who kidnapped a good young woman.In any case, he was a grandmaster, he still had his face.Moreover, ever since they slept in each other's arms at the Red Lotus Pavilion, the two of them felt very awkward and rarely spent time alone.Chu Wanning's expression was calm and indifferent, but countless thoughts ran through his mind. After a long time, he finally raised his chin slightly and nodded at Xue Meng.\"Xue Meng and I will stay in the same room.\"Xue Meng, \"\u2026\"Mo Ran was originally smiling, but now he couldn't help but be stunned.He really did hope that Xue Meng and Chu Wanning would stay together, and that he would stay with Shi Mei.But when this choice came out of Chu Wanning's mouth, he inexplicably felt a bit depressed.He didn't know that he looked very much like a little wild dog who didn't know the difference between heaven and earth.The little wild dog met a man. Although that man didn't treat him very well, he was still willing to throw him some bones to eat three meals a day.But the little wild dog didn't like this fierce man, so although he ate the bones every day, he licked his paws and barked at the man. He didn't treat this man as his master.But for some reason, one day, this man came out with a bowl, and what was inside was not the bones he was familiar with, but millet. A beautiful bird with bright feathers fluttered down and perched on the man's shoulder. It stared at him with round eyes, and its sparkling beak intimately rubbed against his face.The man glanced sideways, stroked the bird's luxurious wings, and carefully fed it grain.This wild dog couldn't help but be stunned.After all, he thought that Chu Wanning would choose him \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAt night, Mo Ran rested his chin on his hand and stared at the wall.Chu Wanning and Xue Meng's rooms were separated by a wall.Shi Mei loved cleanliness. His clean clothes were neatly folded on the bed, not even a crease could be seen.Then he went downstairs to ask the waiter to bring him hot water for a bath.The soundproofing in this inn was not particularly good. When the room was quiet, one could hear the faint sounds of movement next to them.Chu Wanning seemed to say something, but it wasn't clear.But then Xue Meng's voice sounded \u2014 \u2014\"It seems to be a little tight.\"Mo Ran's ears pricked up and moved.Little Phoenix next door said, \"Shizun, does it hurt?\"\"\u2026 It's okay. You can continue.\"\"I'll be gentler. You can tell me if it hurts.\"\"So long-winded. If you want to do it, then do it. If you don't want to do it, then forget it.\"Mo Ran opened his eyes wide in horror. \"???\"Although he knew that the two next door were impossible, what kind of conversation was this?What were they doing?The puppy's ears were almost pressed against the wall. He could hear the vague sound of clothes rubbing against each other. When he looked closer, he could even hear Chu Wanning's muffled groan.He had heard Chu Wanning make this sound many times in bed. When his Shizun was in great pleasure or pain, he didn't want to make a sound. He always bit his lower lip, and the corners of his eyes were wet and red.At this time, if he used more force, he could hear Chu Wanning's broken throat \u2026\"Wait, wait a minute.\" Chu Wanning's voice was hoarse as he said in a low voice, \"There \u2026 don't touch it.\"\"Okay.\" Xue Meng hesitated for a moment and said softly, \"Shizun, you \u2026 you do it yourself?\"\"Yes.\"Where?What kind of nonsense is this?Where can't I touch?What do you mean by doing it myself?'What are these two doing?!'Mo Ran's face darkened.When he reacted, he had already knocked on the door next door.A series of hurried noises came from inside.Gou Zai's expression turned even worse. He took a deep breath and said, \"Master, you \u2014\"The door creaked open.Xue Meng was standing in the middle of the room, dressed immaculately. In his hand was a gauze stained with blood. He was squinting his eyes and staring at him with a puzzled expression.\"What are you doing?It was late at night.Did you run into a ghost? \"Mo Ran opened his mouth, then closed it stupidly.He looked past Xue Meng and saw Chu Wanning sitting by the table. There was a brand new bandage and medicine on the table.\"You are \u2026\"Xue Meng glared at him. \"Apply the medicine. Shizun's shoulder injury hasn't completely healed yet.I haven't changed my dressing for a few days, and some of my wounds have been damaged by the suffocation. \"Mo Ran: \"\u2026\"He asked blankly, \"That, that's too tight \u2026\"\"Too tight?\"Xue Meng frowned and thought for a while. \"Oh, the gauze. It was too tight before. Some blood stuck to the wound. I almost couldn't get it off.\"Halfway through his sentence, he suddenly stopped and looked at Mo Ran suspiciously.\"You were eavesdropping on us?\"Mo Ran rolled his eyes and tried to keep his face in order. \"The walls of this inn are so thin. Who could eavesdrop? If you don't believe me, you can go to the side and listen. If you stick to the wall, you can even hear the sound of breathing.\"\"Oh, is that so?\"Xue Meng nodded. After a while, he felt something was wrong. \"\u2014 Wait, how did you know?Did you stick to the wall and listen? \"Mo Ran: \"\u2026\"Xue Meng was furious. \"Mo Weiyu, you pervert!\"Mo Ran said angrily, \"Who knows what you won't do to Shizun!\"Xue Meng was a pure person. He didn't know what Mo Ran was talking about and became even angrier. \"What nonsense are you talking about!\" He turned his head and said, \"Shizun, look at him \u2014\"Chu Wanning put on her outer robe and pulled it together. She combed her hair as she walked over coldly. She sized Mo Ran up from head to toe.\"What's the matter?\"\"I \u2026 I heard from next door \u2026\" Mo Ran stammered and braced himself. \"That, I thought Xue Meng was bullying you \u2026\"\"What?\" Chu Wanning didn't understand. He narrowed his eyes. \"Who bullied me?\"Mo Ran wanted to slap himself. \"\u2026\"They were looking at each other awkwardly when Shi Mei came up.\"Mo Ran?Why are you in front of Shizun's room? \"\"I \u2026 uh \u2026\" Mo Ran was even more speechless. \"That, there was a misunderstanding.\"Shi Mei smiled. \"Then, has the misunderstanding been resolved?\"\"It's resolved, it's resolved.\" Mo Ran said. \"Shi Mei, didn't you ask the waiter to bring hot water for you to bathe?Shizun hasn't bathed yet, right? I'll go downstairs and ask them to bring more. \"Shi Mei said, \"No need.\"He took out four small wooden tokens made of Nanzhu and smiled. \"The waiter said that there's a natural hot spring next to this inn. The inn owner built a special bathhouse for it.You can take these tokens to bathe. I'll give one to each of you. \"Mo Ran felt that as a homosexual, he shouldn't be bathing with three other people.Xue Meng was one thing, but Shi Mei was as holy as a god in his eyes. He didn't dare to think too much about it.But he knew about Chu Wanning. After his rebirth, he had a few intimate interactions with him. It was very likely that he would lose his mind if he saw him take off his clothes.Mo Ran immediately covered his face. \"I'm not going.\"Xue Meng turned pale with fright. \"You're going to sleep without bathing?It's so dirty! \"Mo Ran said, \"I'll ask the waiter to bring hot water up.\"Shi Mei was confused. \"This inn doesn't boil hot water. All the guests bathe in the hot spring.\"Mo Ran, \"\u2026 \u2026\"Mo Ran had no choice but to take a change of clothes with them and bathe in the hot spring.This inn knew how to take advantage of the situation. They knew that most of the guests here were Daoists who went to the Jincheng Pool to seek the sword. Thus, they simply named the bathhouse \"Jincheng Xuying\" for luck.Mo Ran was afraid that he would faint, so he didn't dare to bump into the other two. He hurriedly changed his clothes and wrapped a towel tightly around his waist. He first ran to the pool and found a quiet place to bathe.Because it was already very late, there weren't many people in the pool. They were scattered far away. Mo Ran had a white towel on his head. His entire body and half of his face were submerged in the water. When he exhaled, bubbles came out.After the first person finished changing, he walked out of the room with his long legs naked.Mo Ran stole a glance and let out a sigh of relief. Luckily, it was Xue Meng.Although Xue Meng was handsome, he wasn't Emperor Ta's cup of tea. The two looked at each other. Xue Meng pointed at him. \"You stay away from me.\"\"Why?\"\"Because you're dirty.\"Mo Ran: \"Haha.\"The bathhouse was foggy. After a while, Xue Meng, who was wiping his body with a soap, suddenly said, \"Shizun, over here!\"Mo Ran's face was half submerged in the water. Hearing this, he almost choked.Although he knew that he shouldn't look, his eyes still couldn't help but look to the shore.This look really took his life. Mo Ran was caught off guard and immediately drank two mouthfuls of water. He didn't care about the disgust and quickly dived deeper. Only his eyes were above the water.He didn't expect that Chu Wanning and Shi Mei would come out together.Two people. One was slender and beautiful, with long black hair and a towel wrapped around him. It was Shi Mei.Mo Ran originally wanted to sneak a peek at him, but in the end, he only took a quick glance.He really respected Shi Mei as much as the bright moon, so he didn't dare to stare at him in public.But the other one was tall and handsome, with wide shoulders and a narrow waist. His body was strong and his skin was tight. It was Chu Wanning.He had a high ponytail and was wearing a large white bathrobe. His whole body was covered, but the robe was too wide. The lapels of the robe were not pulled tight, revealing a large area of his smooth and tight chest.Mo Ran stared at him. He felt like he was going to be suffocated and cooked in the hot spring.He wanted to look away.But his eyes didn't listen. He couldn't move them away, and his ears slowly turned red.Separated by the dense fog, Chu Wanning seemed to be looking at him, but also didn't. He casually put up a waterproof barrier around himself and then stepped into the hot spring. His clothes floated, and when he moved, his legs could be seen. They were straight and slender.Mo Ran: \"\u2026\"He couldn't take it anymore. He closed his eyes and sank to the bottom of the water.Even with the protection of the towel around his waist, his reaction was too \u2026Mo Ran felt very wronged.He really didn't like Chu Wanning. He hated Chu Wanning to the core.But his body remembered the clouds and rain in the past. He remembered those soulless entanglements that could erode iron bones into tenderness.He also remembered all the blushing and ridiculous things between them.His Adam's apple moved, and he was in a dilemma.In the end, Mo Ran was really anxious to the point of crying.He was afraid that for the first time, he would despise himself like this. Why was it like this?Shi Mei was still in front of him. What was the point of him being hysterical in front of Chu Wanning?Even if they were skin to skin in his previous life.It was all in the past.If he was so concerned about Chu Wanning's body, what would he do to his junior sister?How disrespectful, how bad.After suppressing his evil thoughts for a long time, Mo Ran finally suppressed the evil fire in his lower abdomen.Only then did he suddenly emerge from the water. He shook off the water droplets, wiped the water off his face with a towel, and opened a pair of misty eyes.He was looking right at Chu Wanning's face.And the water just now was splashed all over Chu Wanning's face.At this time, a drop of water was slowly dripping down. It suddenly seeped into his dark and sharp eyebrows, and then dripped down bit by bit, almost dripping into those beautiful phoenix eyes.Chu Wanning: \"\u2026\"Mo Ran: \"\u2026\"This was really too bad. He was holding his breath under the water just now and couldn't see the situation around him.Chu Wanning also didn't know that Mo Ran was hiding in this position. He came over on his own to get the incense box.In the end, before he could get the incense, his face was splashed with water by the person who suddenly emerged.This hot spring was very deep, and the buoyancy was not small. Mo Ran was dizzy and prepared to retreat. In the end, he slipped and fell into Chu Wanning's arms.\"Ah!\"\"\u2026\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChu Wanning didn't have time to think and reached out to support him.In the warm spring water, the two people's skin was pressed against each other. Mo Ran immediately felt a spark of electricity shoot up his tailbone, causing goosebumps to rise all over his body.Even though he had hugged a nearly naked Chu Wanning at the Red Lotus Pavilion, the situation at that time was critical and he didn't have the time to think about it, so he didn't have much of an impression of it.But at this time, one hand was pressed against Chu Wanning's chest, the other hand was still subconsciously supporting Shizun's waist. Under the water, their legs were rubbing together, and the other's skin was even more smooth and warm in the spring water. Mo Ran's head exploded with a boom.Towards Chu Wanning, he \u2026..Just touching the other's waist like this, without doing anything else, was \u2026..The reaction was intense, like a surging river.\"Mas, Shizun, I \u2014 \u2014\"He struggled to stand up straight, his already burning lower body bumping into the other in this hurried struggle.Chu Wanning's eyes suddenly widened, shock flashing across his handsome face. He immediately retreated, but at the same time, the water droplets hanging above his eyelashes just now dripped into his eyes. Chu Wanning was provoked and hurriedly closed his eyes to rub them, but he didn't have a towel to wipe with.\"Shizun, use mine.\"Mo Ran was so embarrassed that he wanted to die. His face and ears were red, but he still wanted to cover it up and pretend that nothing was wrong. He took his own towel and helped Chu Wanning wipe the water droplets on his face.When Chu Wanning opened his phoenix eyes, there was confusion and astonishment in them, and a faint trace of panic.But these were all fleeting. He quickly tried to calm himself down, pretending that he didn't feel anything, and said in a hoarse voice, \"Incense, give it to me.\"\"Oh \u2026 .oh, okay.\"Mo Ran walked to the side of the pool like a cooked crab and picked up the incense box on the shore.\"Shizun, what kind of scent do you want?\"\"Anything.\"Mo Ran was dizzy, and stared blankly at the box for a long time, then sincerely turned his head, \"There is no such thing as anything.\"Chu Wanning: \"\u2026\"He paused for a moment before sighing. \"Plum blossom, begonia.\"\"Alright.\"Mo Ran picked up two incense sticks and handed them to Chu Wanning.When their fingertips touched, there was another rustle.No matter how unwilling he was, he still couldn't get rid of those memories.If it was in the past, he would have long been entangled with him by the pool. He even imagined the scene of Chu Wanning half-kneeling on the ground, enduring his own burning passion. His master's eyes were half closed and she couldn't stop trembling, yet she was still f * cked to climax by him \u2026Mo Ran couldn't take it anymore. That kind of instinctive male desire made his eyes turn red.He didn't dare to look at Chu Wanning again. He felt that even if he looked at Shi Mei now, it would be safer than looking at Chu Wanning.How \u2026 could this be \u2026How could this be?After hurriedly washing up, Mo Ran vaguely said that he was sleepy and went back to sleep while the other three were still soaking.He went back to his room and locked the door.Mo Ran couldn't take it anymore. He relieved his own desires. He didn't want to imagine Chu Wanning at this time. He'd rather imagine Shi Mei in front of a beautiful woman.This would also make his conflicted heart feel better.But his body and thoughts were out of his control. All that flashed in front of his eyes were the scenes of him and Chu Wanning making love. Those bone-deep passion seemed to have been opened tonight. They crazily rushed back to his brain, accompanied by waves of tremors of destruction.He treated himself roughly, just like when he was entangled with that man. When he was on the verge of destruction, he raised his neck and panted unwillingly.His throat unconsciously spat out a name.\"Wanning \u2026\"After saying these two words, he let out a muffled groan and trembled slightly. He released all of his power without holding back, and his palms became moist \u2026After venting, Mo Ran pressed his forehead against the cold wall.His eyes were full of confusion.Shame, guilt, disgust, excitement.He didn't expect that after his rebirth, he would have such a strong reaction to Chu Wanning.He suddenly felt disgusted with himself.Although he didn't get Shi Mei in his previous life, he spent all his energy on women.But that kind of promiscuity was actually nothing to him.After the candlelight was extinguished, it was just like any other person.Even Rong Jiu, who was slightly moved, was just because he looked similar to Shi Mei.But his feelings for Chu Wanning were completely different.He could clearly feel that it was just an imagination, not a real fusion. He could feel the strong pleasure that he couldn't feel from those little girls. It was not physical. And \u2026He didn't want to think about it.He loved Shi Mei. It was in the past, and it will be in the future. It will never change.After repeating this to himself several times, Mo Ran slowly calmed his breathing. He frowned and closed his eyes.He was anxious and annoyed, but more than that, he felt sad and wronged.He didn't want to be like this.When the desire came, he couldn't help but think about Chu Wanning.After the desire retreated, he didn't want to think about anything related to Chu Wanning. Even if it was a strand of hair, a look in his eyes.He was almost paranoid that the one he liked, the one he loved deeply.It was Shi Mei \u2026Grandmaster Chu's mind was also in a mess.After all, he directly and deeply felt Mo Ran's desire. The young man's body was very well developed, and was very shocking. When he was excited, it was hot like iron waiting to be fired.Although Chu Wanning quickly recovered his calmness and didn't mention it, that feeling made his scalp numb and he couldn't believe it.What made it even more difficult for him to say was that he also had a reaction at that time.Fortunately, he was shy. Even if he was in the hot spring, he was used to wearing a bathrobe. His whole body was well covered and no one saw it. Otherwise, he wouldn't have anywhere to put his face.But why would Mo Ran \u2026At night, he lay on the bed and thought for a long time. He didn't dare to think \u2014 \u2014 maybe Mo Ran also liked him.This idea was too crazy and too shameful.He only thought carefully, \"Maybe Mo Ran also likes \u2014 \u2014\"Before the word \"himself\" could appear in his mind, Chu Wanning fiercely pinched himself.His pair of phoenix eyes were bright and clear, but they flashed and hid.He didn't even dare to complete this sentence.After all, he was fierce and liked to beat people. His mouth was poisonous and his temper was bad. He didn't look like Shi Mei, and he wasn't young. Even if Mo Ran liked men, he wouldn't be so blind to like him.He was so arrogant.In fact, because he had been ignored and feared by others for too long in his heart, he had gradually felt inferior to the dust in this long and lonely journey.The next day, he woke up.Mo Ran and Chu Wanning met in the corridor of the inn. Both of them had their own thoughts. They looked at each other but didn't speak first.In the end, Mo Ran pretended that nothing had happened. He smiled at Chu Wanning and said, \"Master.\"Chu Wanning sighed in relief. He didn't know how to respond. Seeing that Mo Ran chose not to mention yesterday's matter, he just followed suit and nodded indifferently as usual.\"Since you're awake, go and wake up Shi Mei. We'll make some preparations then we can go to Sunrise Peak.\"Sunrise Peak was covered in snow all year round, so it was very cold. Even cultivators with strong physiques would find it hard to resist this kind of cold.Chu Wanning went to the tailor shop to buy cloaks and gloves for his disciples to wear when it was cold.The Lady Boss, who was smoking a water pipe, opened her big red mouth to attract people. She said to Mo Ran, \"Little Immortal Master looks valiant and formidable. Look at the black background and the golden dragon under the banner of Fengshui. This Shu embroidery is the best. Just the dragon's eyes alone were so delicate that it took me more than three months to finish.\"Mo Ran smiled embarrassedly and said, \"Sister, you're so sweet. Unfortunately, I'm going up the mountain to ask for a sword. There's no need to dress so formally.\"Seeing that this didn't work, the Lady Boss pulled Shi Mei and said, \"Oh, this Immortal Master is so beautiful. You're even prettier than the prettiest girl in Dai City.Immortal Master, if you ask me, this red cloak with butterflies and peonies suits you best. Why don't you try it? \"Shi Mei smiled bitterly and said, \"Lady Boss, that's for girls.\"Xue Meng didn't like to shop and look at clothes, so he didn't want to come over. He just stood there and waited.Chu Wanning chose a black cloak with purple edges for him. There was a circle of white rabbit fur around the eaves of the cloak.The Lady Boss said, \"Immortal Master, this cloak is a little too small for you. It's more suitable for a young man's figure.\"Chu Wanning said lightly, \"I bought it for my disciple.\"\"Oh, oh, oh.\" The Lady Boss suddenly understood. She smiled and said, \"You're such a good master.\"Perhaps it was the first time in his life that he was called a \"good master\". Chu Wanning's body stiffened. Although his face didn't move, when he walked, his hands and feet trembled a few times.In the end, Mo Ran chose a greenish-grey cloak. Shi Mei chose a moon-white cloak. Chu Wanning chose a plain white cloak and a black one with purple edges. After paying the bill, he went to meet with Xue Meng.When Xue Meng saw his cloak, his eyes widened.Chu Wanning was confused. \"What's wrong?\"\"No, nothing.\"However, when Chu Wanning turned and walked away, Xue Meng thought that he couldn't hear him. He looked at the edge of the cloak with some disdain and muttered in a low voice, \"Purple?I don't like purple. \"But unexpectedly, Chu Wanning's cold voice sounded, \"You're so long-winded. If you don't wear it, then go up naked.\"Xue Meng: \"\u2026\"Taking a leisurely pace, the four of them finally arrived at the foot of Rising Sun Peak before the sky gradually darkened.Xu Ying Peak was full of spiritual power and had many spiritual beasts and strange birds. Even if it was a Taoist priest, he would not dare to rashly climb the mountain.However, with Chu Wanning here, there was no need to worry about this. Chu Wanning condensed three begonia flowers out of thin air. They had the effect of expelling spiritual energy and exorcising evil spirits. He put them on the waists of his three disciples. Then he said, \"Let's go.\"Mo Ran raised his head and looked at the towering mountain range that was hidden in the darkness of the night. It was like an ancient giant beast lying still. Suddenly, a myriad of emotions welled up in his heart.That year, at Rising Sun Peak, he announced to the world, the sun, the moon, demons, ghosts, gods, and devils that he, Mo Ran, was no longer satisfied with being the Emperor Ta of the Cultivation World. He wanted to proclaim himself the Master of the Human World.It was also that year at Rising Sun Peak that he married a wife and a concubine at the same time.He still remembered the face of that wife, Song Qiutong. She was a peerless beauty in the Cultivation World. From a certain angle, her facial features looked very much like Shi Mei's.He was not a person who cared about etiquette and honor, so he did not follow the cumbersome rules of the Three Matchmakers and Six Matchmakers. At that time, he held Song Qiutong's slender white hand and pulled the woman with the red handkerchief covering her hand up the stairs. They walked for more than two hours up the ten thousand stairs.Later on, Song Qiutong's legs hurt and she could not walk anymore.Mo Ran also had a bad temper. He lifted her veil and was about to yell at her.However, under the hazy moonlight, Song Qiutong's pair of delicate eyes, which were full of grievance and forbearance, looked very much like the old friend who had turned into a pile of bones in the nine springs.The words of loathing were frozen on the edge of her mouth. She trembled a little, but in the end, the words that came out were:\"Shi Mei, let me carry you.\"According to seniority, if they were from the same school, then Song Qiutong was indeed his Shimei. Therefore, she was only slightly startled by this title. She thought that since Mo Ran wiped out the Confucian Wind School, he naturally considered the Confucian Wind School to be the pinnacle of life and death, so calling her Shimei was not out of the question. Therefore, she smiled and said, \"Alright.\"On the last several thousand stairs, the Emperor Ta, the Master of the Human Realm, the Ruler of the Dark World, steadily carried the beautiful bride in red on his back and walked to the top of the mountain.He lowered his head and looked at the mottled shadows on the ground. They were in a strange posture, overlapping each other.He laughed, but his voice was hoarse. \"Shi Mei, from now on I am the Master of the Human Realm. From now on, nobody can hurt you.\"The woman crouching on his back did not know what to say. After hesitating for a while, she softly said, \"Hmm.\"Her voice was very soft. Perhaps it was because it was too soft that the woman's voice was not so clear. It sounded somewhat indistinct.Mo Ran's eyes reddened in a place where no one could see. He said in a low voice, \"I'm sorry to have made you wait for this day for too long.\"Song Qiutong also thought that Mo Ran had liked her for a long time, so she gently said, \"Husband \u2026\"This woman's voice was clear and crisp, like a delicate orchid falling on dew. It was very pleasant to hear.But Mo Ran's footsteps suddenly stopped.\"What's wrong?\"\"\u2026 Nothing.\"He continued to walk forward, but Mo Ran's voice was no longer hoarse. The weak trembling also disappeared.After a pause, he said, \"In the future, just call me Mo Ran.\"Song Qiutong was quite surprised. She did not dare to call the Emperor Ta that, so she hesitantly said, \"Husband, this \u2026 I'm afraid \u2026\"Mo Ran's tone suddenly became fierce, \"If you don't listen, I'll throw you down from the top of the mountain!\"\"A, Mo Ran!\" Song Qiutong quickly changed her words, \"Mo Ran, I was wrong.\"Mo Ran did not say anything else.He lowered his head, did not say anything, and continued to walk forward.The shadow on the ground was still a shadow.Later on, when he saw it clearly, he realized that it was really just a shadow.The moon in the water, the flowers in the mirror, was all fake.What he had, in the end, was only worthy of an illusion.In the end, it was all fake.\"Shi Mei.\"\"Yes?\" The people walking beside Mo Ran heard him and turned their heads.Thousands of leaves, thousands of sounds, and the grass and trees rustled. The moonlight shone on his beautiful face, \"Mo Ran, what's wrong?\"\"Are you \u2026 tired from walking?\"Mo Ran glanced at Chu Wanning and Xue Meng who were walking in front of him and whispered, \"If you're tired, I'll carry you on my back.\"Before Shi Mei could say anything, Chu Wanning turned around.He glanced coldly at Mo Ran. \"Is Shi Mingjing's leg broken? Does she need you to show off?\"Shi Mei hurriedly said, \"Shizun, Mo Ran was just joking. Please don't be angry.\"Chu Wanning lowered his eyebrows. His eyebrows were sharp, and there was a faint flame in his eyes. \"Ridiculous, what do I have to be angry about?\"With that, he flicked his sleeves and left.Mo Ran: \"\u2026\"Shi Mei: \"\u2026\"\"Master isn't happy \u2026\"\"It's not like you don't know him.\"Mo Ran whispered in Shi Mei's ear. \"His heart is narrower than the tip of a needle. He's cold-blooded and heartless, but he doesn't allow others to be kind to him.\"With that, he wrinkled his nose, lowered his voice, and concluded, \"He's very annoying.\"In front of them, Chu Wanning suddenly said sternly, \"Mo Weiyu, if you say one more word, I'll throw you off the mountain!\"Mo Ran seemed to be tactful enough to keep his mouth shut. But he secretly glanced at Shi Mei with a grin and mouthed, \"What are you waiting for?See, I wasn't wrong, right?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"The cold moon reflects the frost and snow, the cold mountain embraces the ice pool.Eight thousand mountains cannot be crossed, the end of the world is here. \"Xue Meng wore a pair of deerskin gloves and brushed away the snow on the towering boulder. He read the cinnabar inscription on the boulder and turned around, saying happily, \"Master, we're here.\"It was snowing all year round on the summit of Sunrise Peak. At this time, a crescent moon was hanging high in the sky. The cold moonlight shone on the ice lake. The cold air was desolate and cold. Jin Cheng Lake was frozen but not covered with snow. It was like a glass pearl that covered the heaven and earth. The Milky Way fell to the earth and the stars hung for thousands of li. It was truly magnificent.It was like walking to the end of the world, with white hair.A group of people came to the lakeside. The mirror-like surface of the lake overflowed with magnificent light. There was a stone embankment leading to the center of the lake.There was a stone tablet beside the embankment. The tablet was covered with frost and the stone was crisscrossed. Only the four seal characters, \"The road is difficult to walk\", were vigorous and strong. After thousands of years, they were still clear and bright red, as if they were often painted.Chu Wanning stopped in front of the stone embankment and said, \"The Jin Cheng Lake is seeking a sword. Only one person can enter at a time.Who wants to go first? \"Xue Meng couldn't wait and said, \"Master, I'll go first!\"Chu Wanning looked at him, thought for a moment, and shook his head, \"You're too reckless. I'm not at ease.\"At this time, Shi Mei smiled and said, \"Master, I'll go first. Anyway, I probably won't be able to melt the ice pool.\"On the vast ice lake, Shi Mei walked slowly to the end of the stone embankment that could only allow one person to pass.He followed the rules and condensed a ball of Wakan in his hand. Then he bent down and put his palm on the ice. Shi Mei's Wakan flowed down the ice and a white light flashed in the distance.Mo Ran held his breath and stood still. His ten fingers unconsciously clenched and sank into his palm.Shi Mei tried for a long time, but the ice lake still didn't move.He smiled bitterly and walked back to Chu Wanning, saying, \"Master, I'm sorry.\"\"It doesn't matter. I'll try again after a few years of cultivation.\"Mo Ran sighed slightly. He was even more disappointed than the two of them, but he still comforted Shi Mei, \"It's okay, there's still a chance. I'll come with you next time.\"Chu Wanning said, \"Don't talk so much. Go forward, it's your turn.\"In his previous life, Mo Ran had come to ask for a sword. He was a frivolous youth who had high hopes for the Divine Martial Arts.However, in this life, he was only here to retrieve the sword. He already knew what was waiting for him, so he didn't have that kind of nervousness and anticipation.But there was the warmth of reuniting with an old friend.Walking on the stone embankment, kneeling in front of the frozen lake.He bent down and touched the ice with his palm.Mo Ran closed his eyes.His sheathless modao \u2026The sinful blade that accompanied him to see all the flowers in the world and taste all the blood in the world.Opening his eyes, Mo Ran whispered to the lake, \"No Return, I'm here.\"As if it had sensed the call of its destined master, a huge black shadow suddenly rose from under the ice of the Jincheng Lake. That black shadow circled under the ice, becoming clearer and clearer.Suddenly, the thousand feet of ice shattered. Mo Ran heard Xue Meng's cry of alarm from afar on the shore. His voice was so far away that it was almost inaudible.\"The ice is melting!!\"The waves surged, and the lake water soared to the sky.A dark green Jiao Dragon soared out, each of its scales was seven feet wide. In a split second, the surface of the Jincheng Pool was surging with water mist. Under the moonlight, the Jiao Dragon shone brilliantly and breathed out a mouthful of air.At the same time, an ancient enchantment fell down beside the lake, separating Chu Wanning and the others from Mo Ran.Inside the enchantment, a man and a Jiao Dragon looked at each other.Mo Ran narrowed his eyes, facing the water that filled the sky, and looked up at the Jiao Dragon.The Jiao Dragon held a pitch-black modao in its mouth. There was no scabbard, and the simple blade was thick but sharp. It could cut through iron and cut through gold.The dragon turned the modao into a size suitable for mortals. It slowly bowed down its colorful body and placed the blade in front of Mo Ran.However, it did not immediately raise its head. Instead, it stared at the other party with its ginger-yellow eyes that were as tall as two adult men.The Jiao Dragon's eyes were like two bronze mirrors, clearly reflecting Mo Ran's reflection.Mo Ran held his breath and waited for it to speak.If things did not change, then he only needed to go to the foot of the mountain to pick a plum blossom and give it to the Jiao Dragon. The old Jiao Dragon was graceful and elegant, which allowed Mo Ran to take advantage of it.Unexpectedly, after waiting for a long time, the Jiao Dragon did not give him the weapon as easily as it did in his previous life. Instead, its dragon whiskers danced, and its huge yellow eyes narrowed. Then, it raised its front claws and wrote two words on the snow in front of Mo Ran.Mortal?Mo Ran was stunned.He clearly remembered that in his previous life, this Jiao Dragon could speak. Why was it mute in this life?After the mute dragon finished writing these two words, it immediately denied itself. It used its thick and fat claws to erase the words and wrote another string of words.No, a mortal can't have such strong spiritual energy. Then, are you a God?Mo Ran: \"\u2026\"The old Jiao Dragon thought for a moment, shook its head, and wrote again.You're not a God. You have evil aura on you.Are you a Ghost?Mo Ran thought to himself, What a mess!I'm just reborn, what's there to think about? Hurry up and give me my knife!The old Jiao Dragon seemed to see through his eagerness to get the knife. It suddenly raised its ferocious claws and pressed the Mo Knife under its claws. Its other claws erased the original marks, added a handful of snow, and continued to write.Don't be offended.I saw two other shadows on your body. It's really rare to see them in my life.Are you a human or a ghost, a god or a demon?Mo Ran raised his eyebrows and said, \"Of course I'm a human.Do you even need to say that? \"He was just a person who had died once.The old Jiao Dragon paused and wrote again, A person's soul is divided like this.He had never seen or heard of such a thing before.Mo Ran saw that it was shaking its head and wagging its tail, and could not help but laugh. \"What's so strange about it? Senior, what will make you willing to give me your knife?\"The old Jiao Dragon sized him up for a while and wrote:Then stand there and don't move. Let me cast a spell to take a look at your soul. I'll give you the knife, okay?\"\u2026\"He did not expect it to make such a request. Mo Ran was slightly stunned and hesitated.He wondered what would happen if this old thing could see what happened in his previous life.However, the knife was right in front of him. The power of this Mo Knife was fierce and ruthless. It was a rare divine weapon in the world. If he rejected it, it would be impossible to obtain it in the future.After hesitating for a moment, Mo Ran looked up and asked, \"Yes, but Senior, will you be willing to give me the knife no matter what you see on me?\"The old Jiao Dragon wrote:This is the rule. I naturally won't go back on my word.Regardless of whether I was good or evil in the past?The old Jiao Dragon paused for a while and then wrote:Even if you were evil in the past, I can't stop you. I only hope that you will be good in the future.Mo Ran rubbed his palms and said with a smile, \"Alright, since Senior has said so, I naturally have nothing to refuse.Senior, please cast your spell and take a look. \"The old Jiao Dragon raised its body slightly and arched its dragon body that was overflowing with light. It exhaled a breath, and then its eyes glowed with a bright red glow.Mo Ran looked up and found that the layer of red light was actually a thin layer of fog.The blood fog gradually deepened and gradually covered his reflection.After a long while, when the fog slowly dispersed, his standing figure reappeared in the old Jiao Dragon's eyes.However, this time, Mo Ran suddenly realized that in addition to himself, two other blurry shadows were also reflected in the dragon's eyes. They were standing faintly behind him, one on the left and one on the right.Mo Ran was shocked and immediately turned his head to look, but there was nothing behind him. It was snowing. Where was the figure of the other people?When he turned his head again, the two people in the dragon's eyes became clearer and clearer. It was like something that was slowly rising from the bottom of the water. Mo Ran stared at them for a while and suddenly felt that the two shadows were very familiar. He couldn't help but take two steps forward. Unexpectedly, the two shadows in the dragon's eyes suddenly opened from their closed state!Shi Mei!Chu Wanning?!He didn't expect that it would be them. Mo Ran was very shocked. He staggered two steps back and couldn't finish his sentence, \"How \u2014 this is \u2014\"The three people in the old Jiao Dragon's eyes stood quietly. Their faces were calm, without the slightest expression. They just peacefully stared into the distance.Mo Ran was extremely shocked. After a while, he saw the red blood fog rise again. The shadows in the dragon's eyes began to turn from clear to blurry, and finally disappeared.The old Jiao Dragon exhaled, the dragon's whiskers trembled, and then quickly wrote:I can't see through it. In all my life, I have never seen a person's soul imprinted with the mark of two other people.It's very strange.\"My, my soul \u2026 has their mark?\"Yes.After the old Jiao Dragon finished writing this word, he paused for a moment and wrote again:I don't know what happened to you. How deep is your obsession that you can entangle with other people in your soul?Mo Ran stared at the crooked words on the snow, as if he was choking. His face slowly turned red.His obsession with Shi Mei was deep in his bones. Even if it was engraved in his soul, even if the old Jiao Dragon could see him together with Shi Mei, he didn't think it was a big deal.But Chu Wanning \u2026 What was going on?What obsession could he have with Chu Wanning?Could excessive hatred be a kind of entanglement?The man and the dragon were so deep in thought that they didn't notice a slight strange wrinkle on the water of the Jincheng Pool.By the time the monstrous waves broke through the sky and split the shore, it was already too late.The water of the Jincheng Pool was split into two, as if it was cut by a knife and an axe. Two groups of strange beasts rushed out from the waves. They had the bodies of leopards and the heads of cows. Although they weren't as big as the old Jiao Dragon, they had sharp horns on their heads and sharp claws.Hundreds of them gathered together, but the old Jiao Dragon wasn't afraid. He looked at them with his yellow eyes.Mo Ran asked, \"What's going on?\"The old Jiao Dragon paused and wrote: Gouchen Upper Palace.Glancing at these four words, Mo Ran felt like he was struck by lightning.Gouchen Upper Palace's Master killed and ruled all the weapons in the world.This Incipient God created the world's first sword and helped Fuxi eliminate the Demon Bandits.That awe-inspiring Incipient God was actually these hundreds of cows?This was too shocking. Mo Ran couldn't accept it. While he was in a daze, he suddenly heard the sound of xun from afar.The xun was a very ancient instrument. In their era, not many people knew how to play it.As the xun sound got closer, the stampeding beasts gradually stopped. In the end, they bent their front legs and knelt on the two sides.When the tide of beasts dispersed, a man wearing luxurious clothes and carrying a long sword rode over on a qilin.The man had a handsome face and delicate features. He had a very gentle face.He stood in the wind with snow on his body. His clothes fluttered softly in the wind. The xun in his hand had a glossy luster. His ten fingers pressed on the hole and he put it near his mouth to play.As the last note stopped, the hundreds of cow heads turned into water droplets. They were formed by an illusion.The man put down the xun and sized up Mo Ran. Then, he smiled warmly, \"You're indeed a rare talent.No wonder Wangyue is so curious about you.I'm Gouchen Upper Palace and I live in the Jincheng Pool.The weapons in the pool are all made by me.It's just a small trick, please excuse me. \"Although the old dragon wrote it down and the man said it himself, Mo Ran was still in disbelief. He asked, \"You're Gouchen Upper Palace?\"The man was impatient, however. He smiled and said, \"That's me.\"Mo Ran was about to suffocate, \"\u2026 You're the Master of Weapons?\"\"That's right.\"Gouchen Upper Palace raised his eyebrows and smiled, \"That's what the later generations call me. I'm ashamed. I just had nothing to do, so I decided to make a small knife and a small whip. You've overestimated me.\"Mo Ran was speechless.It was annoying when powerful people became humble. Chu Wanning said calmly, \"I have three divine weapons\". Gouchen Upper Palace was even more annoying. He actually called the weapons he made \"small knife\" and \"small whip\".Why didn't he call the Fuxi Emperor \"little old man\"?Mo Ran took a long time to recover and said, \"Then, then, shouldn't you be in the Realm of Gods?Why are you in this \u2026 this pool \u2026 \"\"I like to knock and knock and often disturb the Heavenly Emperor's peace.Instead of being looked down upon by him in the Realm of Gods, I might as well go down to the mortal world. \"\u2026Mo Ran was speechless, \"How long have you been here?\"Gouchen Upper Palace thought for a while and smiled, \"It's been a few hundred years.\"\"\u2026 A few hundred years,\" Mo Ran repeated and laughed dryly, \"Don't you think it's a little long?\"Gouchen Shanggong smiled and waved his sleeves nonchalantly.\"Not really.Moreover, after forging the sword for the Heavenly Emperor, I've used up a lot of my divine power. It's boring to stay in the Realm of Gods. It's much better here. \"Although Mo Ran was curious about the legendary God of Massacre, it was not good to ask about his personal matters. He thought for a while and felt that something else was more important, so he said, \"Exalted God, you didn't come to see me today just because my soul is special, right?\"\"Why not?Your spiritual power is rare, it's rare. \"Gouchen Upper Palace smiled,\" It's a waste of your talent to only give you this Modao. \"Mo Ran said, \"Haha, it's alright. I think this sword suits me well.\"\"At first glance, I thought so too.\" Gouchen Upper Palace smiled, \"After careful observation, I realized that's not the case.Your talent is rare and I'm curious about it, so I came to invite you to the bottom of the lake for a chat.I want to see which of those thousands of weapons is most suitable for you. \"\"\u2026\"This was a huge shock. Even though the Emperor Ta was very knowledgeable, he was still stunned.The Master of Weapons actually invited him to \u2026 pick a weapon?Gouchen Upper Palace saw that he did not speak and thought that he was afraid to go, so he said, \"Don't worry. Although there are many demons in the water, they all listen to me and won't hurt you.Wangyue can vouch for that. \"The old dragon did not say anything and slowly bowed his head.Mo Ran saw that he was sincerely inviting him and could not help but be moved, \"If I go, can you grant me a request?\"\"What request?\"\"The person who asked for the sword just now is my close friend.\"As Mo Ran spoke, he pointed to the shore behind the enchantment and showed Shumi to him. \"He asked for a sword but couldn't get one. So I thought, if I can fulfill the Exalted God's wish, can the Exalted God also fulfill my wish and give him a weapon?\"\"I thought it was something big, it's just a small matter.\" Gouchen Upper Palace smiled and suddenly waved his hand. The enchantment disappeared immediately.\"This is very easy.Let the three of them come over.If there's a weapon that you like, just take it. \"Mo Ran was overjoyed. He didn't expect to find what he was looking for so effortlessly.Shi Mo being able to obtain the Divine Martial Weapon made him even more excited than him obtaining an even more powerful weapon.He immediately agreed to Gouchen Upper Palace. When Shi Mei and the rest arrived, he told them about the situation. Shi Mei and Xue Meng's eyes widened, even Chu Wanning was slightly moved.Gouchen Upper Palace looked at them from the side and suddenly seemed to realize something, \"Hmm?\" He stared at Chu Wanning.\"It's you?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChu Wanning was neither servile nor overbearing even in front of a deity. He asked, \"Exalted God, do you recognize me?\"\"How can I not recognize you?\"Gouchen Shanggong smiled gently. \"Many years ago, you came to the Jincheng Pool to ask for a sword. Your spiritual power was so profound and pure that I almost couldn't resist coming out to meet you.How is it? Are you comfortable with the weapon? \"\"Exalted God, which one are you referring to?\"\"\u2026 Ah.\"Gouchen Shanggong was stunned for a moment before he smiled. \"Look at my memory, I forgot that I gave you two.\"Chu Wanning said, \"It's okay.Tianwen is good. \"\"Tianwen?\"\"That willow vine.\"\"Oh.I see. \"Gouchen Shanggong smiled.\" You named it Tianwen?What about the other one?What's it called? \"Chu Wanning said, \"Jiuge.\"\"How about Jiuge?\"\"The cold air is strong, it doesn't use much.\"Gouchen Shanggong sighed. \"It's a pity.\"After they finished talking, Gouchen Shanggong turned around and said, \"Wangyue, I'll bring them down.The spiritual power on the water is thin, it's not good for your body. You should go back earlier. \"The old dragon nodded and created a huge wave. Its dragon scales shone as it entered the pool.At the same time, Chu Wanning placed a Water Repelling Talisman on the other three people. When Gouchen Shang Gong saw this, he couldn't help but look at Chu Wanning a few more times. He thought to himself, Among cultivators, it's rare to see someone as proficient in spells as him.I wonder who his master is. 'However, Chu Wanning seemed to be unwilling to talk to anyone. Gouchen Shanggong didn't want to ask for a rebuff. After everyone was ready, they waded into the cold Jincheng Pool.Because of the talismans, Mo Ran and the rest moved as if they were on land.As they reached the bottom, a vast and boundless underwater world gradually appeared in front of them.The bottom of the lake was covered with a large amount of fine and soft white sand, crisscrossed by crisscrossing paths, and floating aquatic plants. There were rows upon rows of exquisitely constructed houses.On the streets and alleys, spirit beasts and immortal demons of all shapes and sizes were walking back and forth. Some demons and monsters that would never be able to coexist peacefully in the mortal world could coexist peacefully here.Gouchen Shanggong said, \"Jincheng Lake is rich in spiritual energy, forming a grotto-heaven.Creatures settled down here, and often, they wouldn't migrate for generations. As a result, there were many things that were different from the mortal world.If you're interested, you can look around. \"While they were talking, they saw a rabbit spirit with snow-white skin and red eyes riding on a white tiger with slanted eyes.The rabbit spirit was wearing a white robe. She was graceful and elegant, and her expression was proud. She kept scolding the tiger to walk faster.When he looked at the tiger again, its head was lowered and its eyebrows were lowered. It didn't look imposing at all.Everyone was speechless. \"\u2026\"Gouchen Shanggong brought them along the main path. The shops on both sides were crowded with demons and monsters. After walking for a while, they arrived at the downtown area. There were even more demons and monsters dancing around. It was a marvelous scene.\"Jincheng Lake is used to communicate with the outside world. Most of the items they need are exchanged here.\"Xue Meng said, \"Rumors say that Jincheng Lake is formed by your blood. If that's the case, they are all supported by your spiritual energy. You must be the owner of this place, right?\"\"I'm not the owner.\" Gouchen Shanggong smiled faintly. \"Too much time has passed.I've left the God World for many years, and my spiritual energy isn't the same as before.Now that I think about it, what happened when the world was created is just like a dream. How much does it have to do with me now?Now, the person in front of you is just a little sword forger. \"While he was talking, he brought them to walk around the downtown area.The creatures at the bottom of the lake stayed with Gouchen Shanggong all the time, so they had forgotten about his identity as an Incipient God Realm expert. When they saw him, they didn't have any special reaction. They just continued to sell.\"Fish Blood Steamed Bun! Fresh Fish Blood Steamed Bun!\"\"Shuiran Snake's Skin! It's the best material for clothes. Last three feet. If I sell them all, I'll have to wait for the next one.\"\"Selling Cuttlefish Daiko! I just spat out some ink this morning. It's the best thing to use this daiko to paint. Hey, hey, little girl, don't go!\"The shouts in the market were endless. The strange sights were too much for the eyes to take in.The headless ghost was sitting in front of a stall selling hairbrushes and rouge powder. She held a horn comb with her long nails that were dotted with bright red cardamom. She rested her bloody head on her knees. While combing her hair, she said softly, \"A fine bone comb. Please take one with you.\"Xue Meng opened her eyes wide and looked around. She saw a pharmacy on the side, in which there were many busy Flood Dragon Humans. They were selling rare herbs that she had never seen before. Thinking of her mother's love for precious herbs, she was about to go closer to take a look when she suddenly heard a sharp, ear-piercing voice yelling from behind, \"Excuse me, excuse me!Let me pass first! \"Xue Meng retracted his leg and turned his head to look. However, he could not see anyone.Gouchen Shanggong smiled. \"It's under your feet.Take a closer look. \"As expected, when Xue Meng took a closer look, he actually saw a pile of small stones walking on his own.\"This is really eye-opening. Even stones can walk.Is it a rock spirit? \"Xue Meng muttered.Chu Wanning said, \"Bi Bi.\"\"Fu Ban?\"\"\u2026\" Chu Wanning looked at him indifferently. \"It's fine if Mo Ran doesn't pay attention in class, but why are you not paying attention as well?\"Xue Meng was fully focused on practicing martial arts. However, he was not paying attention in literature and history. Due to Chu Wanning's prestige, he had to pretend to sit upright when he was teaching. However, in reality, everything went in one ear and out the other. Now that his master caught him red-handed, he immediately blushed.Mo Ran rubbed his hands and smiled. \"Master, I'm not happy to hear you say that.I was really paying attention to this part. \"Xue Meng was not convinced. \"Oh?Then tell me about it. \"\"Bi Bi is a type of insect. It is very greedy. As long as it sees a beautiful stone, it will try to carry it. In the end, it will be crushed to death by the stone it picked up.\"Mo Ran looked at Chu Wanning with a smile.\"Master, don't you think I'm right?\"Chu Wanning nodded and said, \"Bi Bi is extinct in the human world. I didn't expect there to be one left here.\"When Gouchen Shanggong heard that, he said with a smile, \"Well, it was only able to survive because of a small pharmacy.Look, it's right there. \"Little by little, Bi 'an laboriously moved to the steps of the pharmacy and suddenly shouted, \"I can't take it anymore!Someone please come and save my life! \"A green dragon quickly swam out from inside. It was obvious that he had dealt with this situation countless times. He skillfully took a white porcelain bottle and poured some of the golden-red liquid on Lao Ai's body. As he poured, he leisurely smiled and said, \"You seem to have gained a lot today?\"The Bi 'an that was called Foolish Old Man snorted. Its voice was lazy, and it was obviously very comfortable under the nourishment of the potion. \"Hmph, it's fine, it's fine. Tomorrow, I'll bring back another 100 stones, and then I'll have 485,617 stones in my house.\"Mo Ran: \"\u2026\"Chu Wanning: \"\u2026\"Shi Mei murmured, \"You've already accumulated so many stones?\"The green dragon sprinkled the potion on Lao Ai's body and said, \"Remember to come here early tomorrow. I think if you're late, I'm afraid this potion won't work.\"\"I know, I know.Come early, come early. \"Lao Ai answered perfunctorily. Suddenly, he saw a beautiful light yellow stone at the corner of the wall and shouted at the top of his voice, \"Little Loach \u2026 Oh, no, Doctor Jiao, that stone over there looks good. Please pick it up and put it on my back.Then I'll have 485,618 stones tomorrow. \"Xue Meng couldn't help but walk over and ask, \"Why do you need so many stones?Are you building a house? \"Lao Ai's arrogant voice came from under the stones, and he said in a high-pitched voice, \"What?A mortal?Oh, I haven't seen a mortal for many years. You're asking me why I need stones?Of course, I'm not building a house. How can I be so boring? \"Shi Mei couldn't help but be curious, \"Then what do you need them for?\"Lao Ai said confidently, \"To count them!\"\"\u2026\"Everyone was speechless.After strolling around the city for a while, Gouchen Shang Gong led them back to his residence.At the corner of the street, there was a huge shell erected, like a wall in the mortal world.After they entered the mansion, they saw that the mansion was divided into six sections. It was spacious and grand.There were rooms in the hall, corridors, and gardens. The bead curtains made of seaweed and pearls swayed gently with the waves.Some of the rooms were dark, while some were lit. There was a dim yellow candlelight inside, and the faint sound of konghou and harps could be heard.Just like the medicine shop, the servants in the mansion were also from the Flood Dragon Clan.Some of the Flood Dragon Clan people kept their tails, and some turned their tails into legs for convenience. However, they were still not used to wearing shoes, so they walked around barefooted.Gouchen Shang Gong saw that the four of them had strange expressions on their faces, so he smiled faintly and said, \"Everyone, please don't be surprised. I have a good relationship with Wangyue, so we live together.He was once the Eastern Sea Crown Prince, and these servants followed him here after he settled down. \"Wangyue was the Black Flood Dragon Elder.Mo Ran obtained God's Martial Spirit from the Black Flood Dragon in his previous life, so he was very close to it. When he heard what Gouchen Shang Gong said, he couldn't help but laugh, \"Then where is he?Such a huge creature like him should have transformed after he returned to the bottom of the sea, right?Otherwise, this place won't be able to accommodate him. \"Gouchen Shang Gong nodded and said cheerfully, \"Of course. However, he's old, so his physical strength isn't very good. He just came to the surface of the water, so he should be resting now.If you want to see him, you'll have to wait for him to wake up. \"While they were talking, a Flood Dragon Person with long brown hair floated over. He bent down and bowed to Gouchen Shang Gong. When he opened his mouth, he spoke with an elegant voice.\"You're back, Exalted God.Prince Wangyue has already told me what happened. Exalted God, are you going to bring the guests to the Divine Armory immediately? \"Gouchen Shang Gong didn't answer first. Instead, he looked at the guests warmly. Seeing that the four of them had no objections, he nodded, \"That's good too. Also, please ask the kitchen to prepare some wine and dishes. We'll start the banquet when we return from the Divine Armory.\"The crowd walked through the courtyard and came to the last entrance. In the middle of the courtyard, there was a giant willow tree. Perhaps it was different from the ones in the mortal world. The trunk of this willow tree was so thick that it would take ten grown men to hug it. The bark was old and strong, and the willow branches hung down like a green veil.Xue Meng's voice was dry, \"Wow, how old is this tree?\"Gouchen Shang Gong said, \"I've never measured it before, but it should be more than a hundred thousand years old.\"Xue Meng was shocked, \"What kind of tree is it? How can it live for so long?\"\"Trees are usually older than humans. Moreover, it is nourished by the aura of Jinchengchi, so there's nothing strange about it.Everyone, please follow me closely. The entrance to the Divine Armory is in the hole of this willow tree, \"Gouchen Shang Gong said. Suddenly, he stopped and looked at Xue Meng.\"Try not to touch those hanging branches.This tree has already become a spirit, it will hurt. \"However, it was a little too late. Xue Meng had already plucked a leaf.He screamed, \"Ah!\", and at the same time, there was a faint moan in the air. There seemed to be a hoarse voice sighing softly, \"Ouch!\".Xue Meng looked like he was struck by lightning. He quickly threw the leaf away and said, \"What's going on?Why is there blood here? \"Indeed, there was blood flowing out from the broken willow branches. The leaf that he threw away seemed to have a life of its own. It spasmed on the ground and after a while, it gradually calmed down. It lay in the distance and quickly curled up and became charred.Gouchen Shang Gong said helplessly, \"I already said that it has already become a spirit.Why is little master still \u2026 \"He shook his head and went forward to check on the broken branch. He urged his spiritual energy to calm the blood of the willow tree.Chu Wanning said, \"Xue Meng, come to my side.Don't move anymore. \"\"Yes, Master,\" Xue Meng knew that he had made a mistake. He could only lower his head and go over.Fortunately, this small incident did not cause too much trouble. Chu Wanning apologized to Gouchen Shang Gong. The other party was indeed an Incipient God. He was magnanimous. He only smiled and said, \"This little master's actions are too fast.\"Xue Meng's face turned red. He followed behind Chu Wanning and lowered his head. He did not utter a word.While they were talking, they passed through the lush willow trees and arrived in front of the thick tree trunk.When they looked closer, they realized that the willow tree was much bigger than it looked from afar. At first, they thought that ten men could wrap their arms around it. Now that they looked closer, they realized that they had underestimated its thickness.There was a tree hole in the middle of the willow tree trunk. Instead of calling it a tree hole, it was more like a giant arch door. It was wide and tall enough for three strong men to pass through at the same time.There were many complicated barriers in front of the tree hole. Gouchen Shang Gong dispelled them one by one. He then turned around and smiled, \"The Divine Martial Library is inside. It's a little small and messy. Please don't laugh at it.\"Mo Ran was curious. He followed behind Gouchen Shang Gong and was about to enter when Chu Wanning casually pulled him behind him. He said faintly, \"Slow down.\" He then walked in first.Mo Ran was very familiar with his actions. In his previous life, when the four of them were killing monsters, Chu Wanning always walked in front. At that time, he only knew that his Master was impatient and arrogant. He did not want to fall behind the younger generation.However, Mo Ran was reborn. His thoughts were different from before. He looked at Chu Wanning's white robe disappearing into the darkness of the tree hole. He suddenly hesitated.This person walked in front. Was it really because he was impatient and arrogant?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayInside the cave, there was a narrow passageway.They stepped on the steps made of slippery rocks at the bottom of the lake, the slippery feeling pervaded from the soles of their feet all the way to their hearts.After walking through the passageway, their eyes suddenly lit up.The Divine Martial Library that the Gouchen Upper Palace spoke of was completely different from what it was supposed to be.The ancient tree was extremely vast, but who would have thought that the cave inside was so big that it reached the clouds and looked down on the ground, the shelves were towering, and tens of thousands of weapons were laid out.Everyone looked up, but they couldn't see the dome. There were rows upon rows of pedestals with the world's most powerful weapons. It could be said to be majestic and lofty.In the middle of the Divine Martial Library, there was a smelting pool that was boiling with hot waves, the orange molten iron was flowing inside, and the weapons that had yet to be forged were immersed in the molten iron.The weapons made by the Gouchen Upper Palace were all better than the Purple Lightning Cyan Frost, the terrifying temperature was not able to destroy them at all, but instead caused the blades to become even more dazzling.The most amazing thing was that the various Null Division that were flying in the air were affected by the array inside the ancient tree, and were able to move freely.The small flower petals that were inlaid with jewels were like spirits, flying around in the sky, occasionally colliding and creating sparkling sparks that were pleasing to the ears.The Gouchen Upper Palace turned back and smiled: \"This place is too small, right?\"Shi Mei: \"\u2026 \u2026\"Eh \u2026 \u2026Xue Meng: \"\u2026 \u2026\"Small?Then what is big?Mo Ran: \"\u2026 \u2026\"I have something to say, but I don't know if I should say it.Chu Wanning: \"\u2026 \u2026\"The Gouchen Upper Palace ordered Xue Meng and Shi Mei to pick whatever they wanted, and if there was anything that they liked, they could take one.As for Mo Ran, the Gouchen Upper Palace was interested in him, and gave him a few weapons, but none were satisfactory.\"Phoenix Cry Scorched Tail.\" The 14th weapon was handed over, the Gouchen Upper Palace was not discouraged: \"Try this.\"Mo Ran: \"This \u2026 \u2026 I don't know music.\"\"Don't worry, just a few strokes will do.\"Mo Ran did as he was told and played a few notes on the guqin, which had a shiny front end and a charred tail. Who would have thought that the strings would not stop vibrating and would produce a sharp note?Gouchen Shanggong immediately tossed Feng Ming aside. Fa Zhou returned to his original position with the Guqin and switched to a Jasper Pipa.Mo Ran: \"\u2026 Forget about that.\"He was a grown man. Why would he play the pipa like a sissy? Only the gigolos of the Kunlun Treading Snow Palace would do such a thing.Gouchen Shanggong insisted, \"Give it a try.\"\"\u2026 Alright.\"Mo Ran couldn't refuse, so he could only take it and do as he was told. However, he seemed to be a little resentful, for he didn't even play twice before the string snapped.\"\u2026\"Gouchen Shanggong stared at the broken string and said after a long time, \"Do you know what this string is made of?\"Mo Ran said, \"\u2026 You don't want me to compensate you, do you?\"\"It's the white hair of Goddess Wushan,\" Gouchen Shanggong muttered, \"It can't be cut by swords or burned by fire. It's the essence of the earth spirit.You actually \u2026 You \u2026 \"Mo Ran turned around and said in horror, \"Master!I don't have the money to compensate him! \"Chu Wanning: \"\u2026\"Gouchen Shanggong played the strings and muttered to himself, \"Wood counters earth. You can destroy the essence of the earth spirit. Could it be that the most suitable weapon for you is the essence of the wood spirit?\"\"What?\"\"It shouldn't be \u2026\" For some reason, Gouchen Shanggong glanced at Chu Wanning.Chu Wanning caught his gaze and asked, \"What shouldn't be?\"Gouchen Shanggong didn't answer immediately. Instead, he waved his hand and summoned a pottery xun. As the sound faded, a blood-red summoning array appeared in the sky.\"Ji Baihua, come out.\"Mo Ran looked up abruptly. Xue Meng and Shi Mei were also attracted by the commotion.Gouchen Shanggong's fingertips froze in the air as he activated the complex array in the sky. Immediately after, a fox immortal with a fluffy tail broke out of the array. Silver powder rustled and flowed around her.The fox immortal circled in the air before landing in front of Mo Ran.This fox immortal was extremely good-looking. When he got closer, one would realize that he was a man. There was a red mark on his forehead, and his peach blossom eyes were slightly raised. He was wearing a luxurious brocade robe and was holding a golden brocade box in his hand. He glanced at Gouchen Shanggong and smiled, \"Exalted God.\"Gouchen Shanggong said, \"You should know why I called you, right?\"\"I know.\"Gouchen Shanggong asked, \"What do you think?\"Ji Baihua smiled and said, \"Not bad, we can try.\"The two of them went back and forth, completely ignoring the other four people.Mo Ran couldn't help but ask, \"What are you talking about?\"\"Hmm?Little Immortal, you can't wait anymore? \"Fox Immortal Concubine Baihua said brightly, \"Speaking of which, it's interesting. Before I appeared, I sensed your spiritual power from afar. I thought you were at least an old man with white hair, but I didn't expect you to be a handsome young man.\"Mo Ran was speechless.Gouchen Shanggong said, \"Ji Baihua, tell me the serious thing first.\"\"Alright, I'm just kidding.\" Ji Baihua narrowed his eyes and swung his tail. \"What's the serious thing?Aiya \u2014 Little Gou, don't stare at me like that. It's a long story \u2014 \"Mo Ran smiled and said, \"Can you make it short?\"Ji Baihua also smiled and said, \"Sure, sure. If you want to make it short, it's actually very short.\" He channeled his spiritual power and floated the brocade box in his hand in front of Mo Ran.\"Come, take it.\"\u2026 As expected, it was short and to the point.Mo Ran took the brocade box and weighed it in his hand.The brocade box shone with a golden light and was overflowing with colorful lights. It was unknown what kind of divine weapon was stored inside.However, the box did not have any gaps. The only decoration was a pattern of yin and yang on the surface of the box. Two carps, one black and one white, were intertwined, forming the shape of the Eight Trigrams.\"How do I open this?\"Ji Baihua said, \"Hehe, the way to open this box is to leave my mouth and enter your ears. No one else is allowed to hear it.\"Xue Meng asked, \"Do you mean that we should leave?\"Ji Baihua smiled and said, \"There's no need for everyone to leave. I'll just offend this little immortal.\"As he said that, he waved his hand. Mo Ran's vision suddenly turned dark. Unknowingly, the two of them were already in a small secret room.\"Little immortal, don't be nervous. This is the Space Shifting Technique that I'm good at. The brocade box that contains the weapon is a treasure that I made with a secret technique, so I can't tell you how to open it in front of everyone.Please don't be offended. \"Mo Ran smiled and said, \"It's fine.However, I'd like to ask, what kind of weapon is inside that needs to be stored in a brocade box? \"\"I can't tell you that,\" Ji Baihua said.Ji Baihua said, \"Divine Martial Artists all have temperaments. This weapon doesn't want others to know what it looks like. If you provoke it, even if you open the box in the end, it won't recognize you as its master.\"\"\u2026\" Mo Ran was speechless for a moment. He could only smile bitterly and say, \"What weapon is it?It has such a weird temper.Alright, alright, tell me, how do I open this box? \"Ji Baihua saw that Qin Mu did not force him to ask, so he had a good impression of him. He clapped his hands and said, \"Since little immortal is straightforward, then I won't be vague either.This box is called Sauvignon Yearning.As you can see, it has no gaps. If you want to open it, you must fulfill two conditions. \"Mo Ran said, \"I'd like to hear the details.\"Ji Baihua said, \"My Fox Immortal Clan believes in love and kindness the most.Therefore, first, in this world, only one person can open Sauvignon Yearning.This person is extremely important in your life. You must love this person deeply, and this person must also love you wholeheartedly and be loyal to you. \"Mo Ran smiled and said, \"I see. That's a strange request, but it's not difficult.\" He still believed in his friendship with Shi Mei.Ji Baihua heard this and slightly raised the corner of his lips. \"How is it not difficult?Since ancient times, people's hearts are the most difficult to predict. What you think may not be the truth.I've been wandering in this world for a long time and have seen too many people lose their hearts, not knowing who they love.In these thousands of years, there are very few people who can open Sauvignon Yearning. It can be said that there are very few. \"Mo Ran asked curiously, \"Why is that?Even if you get the wrong person, you can continue to search. At most, you can try everyone you know one by one. You can always find the so-called 'most important person in your life', right? \"Ji Baihua said, \"This is the second condition I want to tell you.Apart from you, Sauvignon Yearning can only be touched by one person. In other words, you only have one chance. If you find the wrong person to open it, it will be closed forever, and no one will be able to open it again. \"Mo Ran smiled and said, \"No wonder you want to separate the others.If they heard what you said, it would be difficult for me to deal with it.If I hold the box and show it to someone, they will know who I like. How awkward would that be? \"He paused and played with the brocade box in his hand, then said, \"But this little thing is really interesting. It turns out that this is a keyhole that can only be used once. If you open it wrong, the box will be useless.\"\"Of course it can only be opened once. Otherwise, how many times do you want to open it?\"Ji Baihua glared at him. \"You mortals have been fooling around in the mortal world for dozens of years, yet you don't know how many good relationships you've wasted?You have to know that this Sauvignon Yearning Yearning is the most affectionate thing in the world. If you make the wrong choice, it will be hard to turn back. \"\"Haha, Great Fox Immortal, don't worry. Others may choose the wrong person, but I know very well.\" Mo Ran clasped his hands and bowed to him, then said with a smile, \"I won't let you down.\"Ji Baihua glanced at him and said in a low and gentle voice, which was extremely elegant and pleasant to listen to, \"Little Immortal, don't be too confident.In my opinion, you don't know the person in your life. \"Mo Ran was stunned. His smile was still frozen on his face. \"What do you mean?\"This handsome immortal who claimed to believe in love and kindness the most didn't want to say more. He only sighed faintly and said, \"Not making Sauvignon Yearning, breaking the willow branch.Sigh \u2026 \"Mo Ran wasn't very cultured, so he didn't understand what Ji Baihua was saying. However, he always felt that Fox Immortal was hinting at something in a roundabout way. Unfortunately, he was stupid and couldn't figure out the reason no matter how hard he racked his brain.Just as Mo Ran was about to ask again, Ji Baihua smiled faintly, indicating that his mission had been accomplished. He waved his sleeve and sent Mo Ran out of the secret room. Then, he suddenly froze, becoming stiff and stiff. Soon after, with a crashing sound, he broke into pieces, leaving behind a black chess piece that fell to the spot where he had been standing.It was a pity that Mo Ran didn't see this. If he saw it, many things at the bottom of the lake would probably change \u2026When Mo Ran came back to his senses, he found himself back in the Divine Martial Library with the Sauvignon Yearning in his hand.The other four people were waiting for him in the library. Seeing him come back, Gouchen Shanggong grinned and said with a bright smile, \"That little fox is really interesting. She even has to be so mysterious when opening a box.How is it? Do you know how to open it? \"At this juncture, he didn't have time to think about it. Mo Ran thought about it and said with a smile, \"Easy, easy.\"He walked to Shi Mei casually and said, \"The design of this lock is very interesting. I think you guys won't be able to figure it out even if you try to figure it out for ten years.If you don't believe me, why don't you take a look? \"As he spoke, he passed the box in front of Shi Mei casually.The box was shining brightly in front of Shi Mei. The golden light shone on Shi Mei's gentle and beautiful eyes.\"Shi Mei, you try it first,\" Mo Ran wanted to act as if nothing had happened, but his heart was in a mess and his palms were sweating.This was a gamble on whether or not he would be able to obtain a new Divine Martial Skill, so he should be extremely cautious. However, he also felt that he was already extremely cautious. He was someone who had died once, so how could he not know who he cared about the most?He wasn't stupid.Shi Mei hesitated for a moment, but in the end, he took the Sauvignon Blanc from Mo Ran's hands.Mo Ran's heart was in his throat. However, after staring for a long time, everything was normal and there was no sign of movement.Mo Ran was speechless.Shi Mei carefully held the box and looked at it carefully. His fingertips brushed the pattern of the yin and yang fish, and then he said curiously, \"There's no gap at all. I can't see the chain eye anywhere.\"Why was there no reaction?!Why was there no reaction from the Sauvignon Blanc when Shi Mei touched it?Could it be \u2026 Ah!Yes!It was the gloves!Mo Ran glanced at the deerskin gloves on Shi Mei's hands and was about to ask Shi Kuang to take them off and try again.Suddenly, without warning, a hand with slender fingers and well-proportioned bones reached over and steadily took the Sauvignon Blanc.Mo Ran looked like he was struck by lightning. He screamed, \"Shizun \u2014!!\"Chu Wan-ning jumped in fright and almost dropped the box. However, this person's calmness was so deep that no one could see the chaos in his heart.Mo Ran wailed as if he had lost his beloved. \"Shizun!!!\"Xue Meng had goosebumps. \"Hey, hey, hey!Didn't I just take your box?What's wrong with you?You're screaming like someone stole your wife. \"\"I \u2014 I \u2014\" Mo Ran was so angry that he almost fainted. He couldn't say it out loud, so he covered his face and howled, \"Oh my god \u2026\"Chu Wanning!Why aren't you wearing gloves?!You're so afraid of the cold!We all wear gloves in the ice and snow, why are you the only one who doesn't \u2014Suddenly, Mo Ran was stunned.That's right \u2026The exorcism begonia they wore had to be connected with Chu Wanning's spiritual power. That was why Chu Wanning didn't buy a pair of gloves for himself from the start.He didn't wear gloves because he wanted to protect them.However, he didn't care about him at all. It was only when he was about to open the Sauvignon Blanc that he suddenly realized that Chu Wanning, who was most afraid of the cold, was frozen the whole time.Mo Ran wanted to cry, but no tears came out. He thought that he was really unlucky to have missed out on Shen Wu just like that.Just as he was feeling stuffy in his chest, who would have thought that as Chu Waning's fingertips gently touched the yin-yang fish, the two fish made of metal seemed to come alive. They actually began to nimbly coil around the box.There was a slight pause.With two crisp \"ka, ka\" sounds, the yin and yang fish intertwined with each other. Finally, they protruded and turned into two handles. Chu Wanning turned the handles and the Sauvignon Blanc split into two, revealing the shiny golden object inside.Mo Ran was stunned.Ji Baihua's words were still ringing in his ears.\"Only one person can open the Sauvignon Blanc.This person is extremely important in your life. You need to love this person deeply, and this person must also love you wholeheartedly and be loyal to you. \"\u2026 This person is Chu Wanning?How could it be Chu Wanning?!Impossible, absolutely impossible!!How could he love Chu Wanning so deeply, and how could Chu Wanning like him?What a joke!This must be a mistake. There must be something wrong with the box. This box is broken.However, this wave of shock was not over. When Chu Wanning picked up Shen Wu from the Sauvignon Blanc, something even more shocking happened.This time, Mo Ran wasn't the only one who was shocked. The other three people, and even Chu Wanning, were slightly moved.Their eyes reflected the brilliance of the weapon, and a bunch of sparkling willow vines illuminated everyone's faces.Chu Wanning, \"\u2026\"Xue Meng, \"\u2026\"Shi Mei, \"\u2026\"These two words were stuck in Mo Ran's throat for a long time before he spat them out with difficulty. He was full of disbelief.\"\u2026 Tianwen???\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe weapon in the Sauvignon Yearning was Heaven's Inquisition. In other words, it was a bunch of golden willow vines that looked exactly the same as Heaven's Inquisition, from the patterns to the design.The Sauvignon Yearning broke the willow branch.Chu Wanning's expression was uncertain as he passed the willow vine to Mo Ran. Then, he condensed a light in his palm and summoned Heaven's Inquisition. When the two weapons were compared, it was like looking into a mirror. There was no difference at all.No one expected such a thing to happen. Even Mo Ran found it hard to believe his eyes. As a person who had been whipped by Heaven's Inquisition more than a thousand times in his previous life, he would never have thought that Jin Chengchi would give him an identical weapon.What was going on?Everyone looked at the Gouchen Upper Gong who was standing at the side.The Gouchen Upper Gong was also very surprised as he said, \"\u2026 There are actually two Wood Spirit Essences in the mortal world today?\"Xue Meng asked, \"What does the Wood Spirit Essence mean?\"\"Ah, it's like this.\" The Gouchen Upper Gong said, \"There are five types of elements in the world.Every person's Spirit Core would have one or two attributes.In the mortal world, the person with the most talent in one element is the Essence of that element. For example, the Goddess Wushan was the Earth Spirit Essence.However, normally, there can only be one Essence of the same element in a generation. The Wood Spirit Essence already exists in the mortal world today. Many years ago, I gave the best Wood Spirit Weapon to him. \"As he spoke, his gaze fell on Chu Wanning.\"When I was forging the five top-notch Divine Weapons, I originally planned to only forge one of each element.The other four weapons did not have any problems during the forging process, but the Wood Spirit Divine Weapon actually broke into two in the furnace. \"\"I thought that it was the will of the heavens, so I made two weapons out of the two willow branches.However, I still thought that it was impossible for the two weapons to find an owner at the same time. Thus, I gave one of them to Ji Baihua and asked him to make a brocade box to prevent any evil people from coveting it.But I didn't expect \u2026 \"Gouchen Shanggong shook his head. Just as he was about to continue lamenting, the willow vine in Mo Ran's hand suddenly burst out a string of bright red sparks. The flowing golden luster started to change gradually and finally turned into a blazing red. Mo Ran's mind was in a mess. Without thinking, he opened his mouth and said, \"Ah!Damn it! \"Chu Wanning wanted to stop him, but it was too late.Therefore, Gouchen Shanggong and Chu Wanning looked at Mo Ran with pity. Mo Ran soon knew why they had such expressions.In fact, he had already thought of it himself.When Shen Wu shone with different colors for the first time, it meant that it had submitted to its owner and wanted its owner to give it a name \u2026Unfortunately, it was too late.On the silver handle of the willow vine, three strong and powerful words slowly appeared. They were written in a picturesque style.Ah!Damn it.\"Ah!Damn it. \"Mo Ran, \"\u2026 Ahhhhh!!!!\"Although Xue Meng and Shi Mei did not know the rules of naming Shen Wu, they understood after seeing the scene in front of them.Xue Meng held his stomach and laughed until tears almost flowed out of his eyes, \"Only you can come up with such a name. Hahahaha, good name, good name.Master has Tian Wen, you have 'Ah!Damn it ', ahahahahaha. \"Since Mo Ran had already obtained Shen Wu, Xue Meng and Shi Mei each chose a weapon that they liked. Xue Meng chose a long sword while Shi Mei chose a short flute. However, both of their weapons did not shine with different colors. It was obvious that they had not been tamed and were not willing to submit to the two of them.However, this did not matter much. They could always think of a way.Therefore, they were in a good mood. At night, a banquet was held at the Spring Night Pavilion. Gouchen Shang Gong had never brought mortals to the Jincheng Pool before, so he invited them to stay for a night before leaving.This was his first time hosting mortals, so he naturally did his best.On the table, the guests and the host were slightly tipsy as they toasted each other.After the banquet, Gouchen Shang Gong ordered the servants to bring the guests to their rooms so that they could rest for the night.The guests' rooms were next to the Shen Wu Warehouse. When he saw the huge tree, Mo Ran thought of the 'damn it' that he had just obtained. Therefore, he could not help but summon the willow vine and look at it carefully.It did not make Chang Xiangsi break the willow branch.What exactly did that fox demon named Ji Baihua notice? Why did he say such a thing? And what exactly did he mean by that?He had drunk so much that his thoughts were not so clear. He only felt that it was extremely strange. If Sauvignon Blanc was not wrong, then how could Chu Wan-ning be able to unlock the box?Of course, he did not like Chu Wanning. As for Chu Wanning loving him deeply \u2026 it was a big joke.As he pondered, he looked back at his master.Unexpectedly, Chu Wanning was also looking at him from behind. When their eyes met, Mo Ran suddenly felt his heart tremble, as if it was pierced by something small and sharp. There was a subtle sweetness in it. Before he could think, he was already grinning at Chu Wanning.However, this feeling only lasted for a moment. He soon regretted it.He was so annoying, but why did he feel so peaceful and comfortable when he looked at him sometimes?Chu Wanning looked indifferent. However, when he saw Mo Ran summoning the damn thing, he thought for a moment and summoned Tianwen as well.He walked towards Mo Ran.The damn thing didn't seem to have a good temper. Feeling another powerful Wood Spirit Body approaching, it spat out scarlet sparks. From time to time, a few sparks would explode and fall on Xue Meng.It was actually in a competitive state.On the other side, Tianwen in Chu Wanning's hand seemed to have sensed a similar aura. However, it had been with Chu Wanning for a long time, so it had already become very familiar with him. Therefore, although it was full of fighting spirit, the golden light around it did not become restless as if it had seen a ghost. Instead, it gradually brightened. When it saw that its master did not stop it, it became unusually dazzling. It was as if it had decided to let the damn thing see what kind of steady attitude an outstanding weapon should have in battle.The two divine weapons were originally of the same breath and branch.Now, one was a fledgling, while the other was a veteran.One was emitting red light, jumping up and down like an anxious yellow-haired boy. The other was overflowing with golden light, like a peerless grandmaster, reserved and arrogant.Chu Wanning looked at the willow vine in his hand and pondered for a moment. His gaze passed through the secret room's long eyelashes and fell on the damn thing.He said, \"Mo Ran.\"\"Shizun?\"\"Pick up your \u2026\" The word \"damn thing\" seemed to be a bit shameful. Chu Wanning paused and said, \"Pick up your willow vine and look at it with me.\"Mo Ran's brain was full of mush. He didn't know how to react. He pinched the space between his eyebrows and said with a bitter smile, \"Shizun, don't joke around. Spare me.\"\"I'll give you three moves.\"\"I've never used the willow vine before \u2026\"\"Ten moves.\"\"But \u2014\"Chu Wanning didn't waste any more words. With a wave of his hand, a dazzling golden light chopped down!Mo Ran was shocked. His fear of Heaven's Inquisition was deeply rooted in his bones. He immediately raised his hand and raised his branch, blocking with the \"damn thing\". The two willow vines tore through the wind and snow and soared into the air like two dragons entangling each other. The friction burst out a string of golden and red sparks!Although he hadn't learned how to use this special weapon, perhaps because he had seen Chu Wanning's moves for a long time, and Mo Ran was a gifted person, he was able to barely block Chu Wanning's attack.The two fought for dozens of rounds in the cold lake. Although Chu Wanning went easy on him, Mo Ran's response was outstanding, which was really beyond his expectations.Heaven's Inquisition's gold and the \"damn thing\"'s red danced like the wind in the waves. The moves were gorgeous, the wind was brilliant, and the lake water was torn apart by the fierce vines. Finally, the gold and red entangled together, evenly matched, and difficult to separate!Chu Wanning's eyes were full of admiration, but Mo Ran was tired of blocking. He was so tired that he was panting, so he didn't see the look in his opponent's eyes.Chu Wanning said, \"Heaven's Inquisition, come back.\"The fierce and hard golden willow vine suddenly became soft, like ice melting into spring water, scattering into little spots of light, and gently melting back into Chu Wanning's palm.Mo Ran was still holding on to the \"damn thing\"'s blazing flames. After a while, he simply sat down on the snow, and his eyes were full of grievance. \"I don't want to play anymore, Shizun, you bully me.\"Chu Wanning said, \"\u2026 I've already given you ten moves.\"Mo Ran shouted roguishly, \"How can ten moves be enough? You should have given me a hundred moves. Aiyo, my hand, my arm, it's going to break.Shi Mei, Shi Mei, help me rub it. \"He said a bunch of words like a clown, accompanied by Xue Meng's ridicule and Shi Mei's persuasion.Chu Wanning didn't say anything more, and just looked at them quietly.Maybe it was an illusion, but in the Icy Azure Lake, Chu Wanning slightly rubbed the corners of his mouth, as if there was a trace of a gentle smile. But that was only for a moment, and then he turned his head, clasped his hands behind his back, and looked at the thousands of strings hanging down from the huge tree. No one knew what he was thinking.At night, Mo Ran sat in his own guest room. The room was covered with fine, soft, and pure white sand, and the walls were painted blue. With a spell cast, it reflected the clear and crystalline waves like the sea. The window was half open, and the pearl curtain hung gently in the evening wind. On the table was a lamp made of night pearls, and the room was warm and soothing.In the middle of the room, there was a very big shell, and the inside was covered with soft satin.The satin was very fine and soft. Mo Ran lay down comfortably on the bed, and then summoned the \"damn thing\". He held it in his hand and looked at it carefully. But maybe he was too tired, and he didn't play with it for long before he fell into a deep sleep.The \"damn thing\" was pressed on his chest, flowing with a faint red light, as if it had fallen into a deep sleep with its master.He didn't know how long he slept, but when he woke up again, the first thing Mo Ran felt was a cold, and then there was an inexplicable strong pain on his wrist.He gasped, covered his head, and slowly sat up. The return of consciousness made the unfamiliar pain on his wrist more obvious. He was shocked to find that there was a cut on his wrist, and the blood had already solidified, forming a ferocious blood cocoon.What happened?\u2014 \u2014 Where is this??!Mo Ran opened his eyes wide.As he gradually woke up, he found himself in a completely unfamiliar dark stone room. There was a small ventilation opening at the top of the stone room, and the cold light of the lake squeezed in through the small opening, barely illuminating this narrow room that was less than a foot long. The greenish-gray stone walls were wet and sticky, and they were glowing with a thin luster under the weak light.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe layout of the stone room was clear at a glance. Three sides were walls, one side was a fence with a red glow. There was only a simple stone bed covered with straw in the room.He was lying on the stone bed, his hands and feet were bound by iron chains. When he moved, the shackles would jingle. What was worse was that he found that his spiritual energy seemed to be restricted by some kind of magic. He could not release it at all.While he was filled with anxiety, he suddenly heard a \"creak\" sound. He turned his head and saw two Flood Dragon People enter.\"You!\" Mo Ran immediately shouted angrily, \"You bunch of lunatics!What is going on?What are you doing?Where are my martial brothers?They are at the Gou Chen Palace!\u2026 Hey!I am asking you a question! \"However, no matter how much Mo Ran yelled and cursed, the two Flood Dragons turned a deaf ear to him. The two of them, one in front and one behind, carried a piece of red fox fur hide. From the way it was rolled up, there seemed to be a person wrapped inside.They expressionlessly placed the person wrapped in red fox fur on the stone bed.Mo Ran said angrily, \"You two little loaches \u2014 \u2014\"\"Why are you being so noisy.\"One of the Flood Dragon People finally spoke. His voice was filled with contempt, \"You are the essence of the Wood Spirit. We won't mistreat you.\"The other Flood Dragon People sneered, \"What do you mean we won't mistreat you? We're clearly benefiting you.\"Mo Ran was so angry that he wanted to vomit blood, \"What do you want!Why did you lock me up here?What did you bring to this bed?! \"\"What did we bring?\" One of the Flood Dragon People asked.\"Naturally, it's someone you like.\" The other Flood Dragon People said.Mo Ran's fingertips turned cold. He was extremely shocked, \"\u2026 Shi Mei?\"The Flood Dragon People did not deny it. They sneered, \"The night of spring is short. Since you have such a good affinity, I will let you have fun tonight.After it is done, you will know why the High God made such arrangements. \"After saying that, they left.The room was deathly silent.Mo Ran's hands and feet were restrained. He could not move.The passage of time became very blurry, and it was difficult for him to know how much time had passed. Even though he struggled with all his might, and his wrists and ankles were abraded, he was unable to break free from the clamp.Panting slightly, Mo Ran turned his head to look at the fox fur coat that was wrapped around a living person. That fur coat was tightly wrapped around the person from head to toe. Only a strand of long black hair was exposed from the edge of the blanket. Looking at it, Mo Ran was both moved and flustered.Even though he didn't know why that pervert from the North Star Palace made such an arrangement, if he could really have some fun with Shi Mei because of this \u2026When he thought of this, he suddenly couldn't continue thinking about it.It was as if any more evil thoughts would be a blasphemy to that beautiful person.Mo Ran stared at the dome of the stone chamber. His breathing was heavy and stuffy, as if there was a heavy weight on his chest. It was something that he had longed for for so long, but now that he had the chance to do it, he felt awkward and uncomfortable all over.Amidst these thoughts, the initial filthy excitement slowly faded, and he gradually calmed down.The North Star Palace's scheme was more ominous than auspicious.It would be fine if it was disadvantageous to him, but if it implicated Shi Mei for no reason, how could he bear it?Furthermore, this was forced by others, and Shi Mei wasn't willing to do it.Even though Mo Ran was a scumbag, he wanted to protect the person he liked. He didn't want to hurt her.Therefore, no matter what evil method the North Star Palace used, when Shi Mei woke up, he would definitely not bully her.After a long silence, he suddenly felt someone move slightly beside him. That person had finally woken up.Mo Ran quickly turned his head to look, and said in a hoarse voice, \"Master \u2026\"Before he could finish his sentence, he forcefully spun the words on the tip of his tongue and swallowed them back. After his Adam's apple moved violently, he spat out the second half of the word.\"Supreme?\"Master?!?A moment ago, Immortal Mo, who had been determined and determined, only felt that many of his high vantage points had collapsed when he saw the face under the fox fur coat. The defense line that he had built up with great difficulty in his heart was instantly razed to the ground and turned into pieces, crackling and shattering cleanly.Those words about protecting her, not bullying her, and not sullying her were all slaps that were louder than the one before.Mo Ran's face turned green.He was finally sure that the evil people living under the Jincheng Lake, led by the North Star Palace, were all a bunch of f * cking blind people!He liked Chu Wanning?Ptui!Be it that fox or the Flood Dragon Person, he really didn't know how they knew that the person Mo Weiyu liked was Chu Wanning.Could it be that they knew that he had slept with Chu Wanning before and still wanted to sleep with her?That's ridiculous!Does liking someone mean that you like to sleep with them?Mo Xiao Xianjun roared righteously in his heart.However, he couldn't say anything. He could only stare blankly at Chu Wanning as he slowly opened his almond-shaped eyes.\u2026'Damn it.'He seemed to have heard a click, and something in his mind broke.After a while, something burned out of the ruins in his heart. It emitted a stench, black ash, and a twisted heat.'It's so hot.'It was as if an evil dragon spitting flames suddenly swam through the silent night. It was as if surging magma and rolling flames suddenly erupted from a silent abyss.The rationality and calmness that he had agreed upon turned into an indistinguishable charred shadow under this heaven-defying fire \u2026He didn't expect it to be like this.Chu Wanning's usually thin and sharp eyes were hazy with sleepiness. He looked lazy and absent-minded.It was as if there was a rain in the bamboo forest. Thousands of leaves and thousands of sounds were wet.He slowly sat up. From the expression on his face, he seemed to be controlled by something. The red fox fur coat slid down his shoulders. He wasn't wearing anything, so a large area of tight skin was exposed. The green and red on his back were full of traces of love.'How \u2026 could this be \u2026'Mo Ran felt that he was going crazy.'Who did this?'Who was it that did such a thing to his \u2026 his \u2026 his master?'I am Chu Wanning \u2026'Every inch of his bones was trembling, and his blood was roaring with hatred.'That's Chu Wanning!''Who dared to touch my people!''It's my \u2014'Mo Ran was so angry that he didn't even consider that Chu Wanning didn't belong to him in this life. He didn't belong to anyone.In his eyes, he only saw Chu Wanning's firm and well-proportioned body and the unfamiliar bruises on that familiar body.\"Master!!\"Chu Wanning didn't seem to hear his hoarse and twisted shout. Instead, he lowered his eyelids. Like a puppet, he leaned over and caressed Mo Ran's face. They looked at each other for a moment, then he closed his eyes and moved closer. With his thin and watery lips, he sucked on Mo Ran's lips.He was rarely kissed by Chu Wanning. With one touch, his surroundings withered. His eyes were full of crazy and dazzling colors. His heart beat wildly.Perhaps Chu Wanning had caught a cold and her body was very cold, but the intensity of their kiss was not inferior in the slightest. Mo Ran was extremely painful and jealous because he had been humiliated by others, but in his jealousy and anger, he was seduced by this familiar man, which caused both pain and excitement.After the kiss, Mo Ran breathed heavily. When he opened his eyes, he saw Chu Wanning's eyes were bright and his skin was slightly red. He looked like he was deeply in love. He couldn't help but want to hold his face.However, he was shackled and couldn't move his hands and feet. Chu Wanning looked at the iron chain and didn't say anything. He knelt down and wanted to ride it.Mo Ran's throat moved. He swallowed and looked at Chu Wanning. He saw that between Chu Wanning's long and slender legs, there was a sticky liquid that even men would understand flowing down slowly.His eyes immediately turned crimson red, his eyeballs almost popping out of their sockets. He tried to sit up, but was pulled back by the iron chains and fell heavily onto the bed.\"Who \u2026\"Mo Ran couldn't hold it in anymore. He shouted like a caged beast.\"Who did this to you!!!I'll kill him!I'll kill him!!! \"He didn't care if he was the Gou Chen Shanggong or the Heavenly King. He was the Emperor Ta!Chu Wanning was the Emperor Ta's man!Even if he was trapped in this body of his youth, he was still the Immortal Emperor of the Human Realm. Who dared to touch him? F * ck your Master! Who dared to touch his woman?He was Mo Weiyu. He was the Emperor Ta's man!!!\"Mo Ran!\"Someone seemed to be calling him.But his endless anger made him dizzy. He seemed to hear it but also didn't.\"Mo Ran!!\"\u2026 Kill them all.Intolerable. What about ghosts?Why did he lose his spiritual power? Why couldn't he summon ghosts? He was going crazy.This was a great humiliation. This was a great humiliation. This was a great humiliation. This was a great humiliation.Who dared to touch Chu Wanning?In his previous life, when he was together with Chu Wanning, even if someone looked at Wanye Yuheng, he would gouge that person's eyes out and make him eat them!At night, he would hug Chu Wanning and f * ck him until both of them were exhausted. But in this life \u2026\"Mo Weiyu!!!\"Who was calling him? Why was he being so persistent?But this voice was so familiar.He seemed to have heard it somewhere before \u2026No.He seemed to be able to hear it everywhere. The owner of this voice seemed to have accompanied him for countless years \u2026\"Mo Weiyu, wake up!Are you crazy?What are you doing?! \"\u201c\uff01\uff01\uff01\u201dMo Ran suddenly opened his eyes.He followed the direction of the voice and saw that outside the cell, there was a figure dressed in white. Her eyes were sharp, and her expression was anxious. Between her brows, swords were drawn, and she was ready to kill. Who else could it be but Chu Wanning?!\"Shizun!?\" Mo Ran turned pale.Then the person on his bed was \u2026When he turned his head, the face that was so close to him almost scared him to death!How was this Chu Wanning?It was clearly a dead monster with a human body and a fox face!Speaking of dead monster, this' dead 'was not just an exaggeration.The one lying on top of him, the one he had just passionately kissed, was really a dead thing.This fox demon's eyes were empty and its skin was pale. There was no sign of life.When Mo Ran thought of how he had just kissed such a thing under the bewitchment of the illusion, he almost vomited. His expression was extremely bad. \"What is going on!?\"Chu Wanning was outside the cell, holding a talisman between his fingers. When he saw that the dead fox demon was completely motionless, he knew that this talisman had been pulled out of the fox corpse by Chu Wanning in a moment of life and death.He made a decision, and a large amount of black-red blood suddenly gushed out of the talisman. Following a series of miserable shrieks, the talisman instantly turned into bits of charred ash.Chu Wanning opened his palm, and the charred ash slowly gathered in his hand, gradually condensing into a jet-black chess piece.He stared at the chess piece, and his expression became very unpleasant.\"It is indeed a Zhenlong Chess Game \u2026\" Chu Wanning muttered. He suddenly looked up and stared at Mo Ran. \"When you were sick, what did Shi Mingjing cook for you the most?Tell me! \"\"Ah?Ah \u2026 \"Mo Ran had been shocked too many times in a short period of time. At this moment, his mind was in a mess. He said,\" Why, why are you asking this? \"Chu Wanning said sternly, \"Tell me now!\"\"\u2026 My hands.\"Only then did Chu Wanning's expression soften slightly, but the space between his brows did not relax at all. He said, \"Mo Ran, listen up. That Gouchen Upper Palace is fake. It's not the God of Weapons' true self.This person is good at using virtual images, and he has mastered one of the Three Great Forbidden Techniques, the Zhenlong Chess Game.Thus, I have to be careful. I am worried that you are also an illusion created by him. \"Mo Ran felt so wronged that he was about to cry. \"If I were an illusion, why would I be locked up!?\"Chu Wanning said, \"\u2026 I will save you now.\"Mo Ran nodded repeatedly, and asked, \"Oh right, Master, where are Shi Mei and Xue Meng?\"\"Like you, they were drugged by the wine and locked up somewhere else.\" Seeing Mo Ran's expression, Chu Wanning said, \"You don't have to worry. They are all fine now.However, this place is very dangerous, so I ordered them to wait outside. Once you get out, you will be able to see them. \"As for the Zhenlong Chess Game, Chu Wanning did not explain further, and there was no need to.It was one of the Three Great Forbidden Techniques, the strongest and most notorious in the cultivation world.As the name suggested, the Zhenlong Chess Game referred to using others as chess pieces to set up the game for oneself.The caster would not appear personally on the battlefield. Instead, he would stay in the dark and lay out the chessboard in front of him. He would control the bodies of the chess pieces, making the living, dead, walking, beasts, and birds of the world work for him.The living beings who were affected by the Zhenlong Chess Game would be loyal to the caster until they died. If they were dead, they would fight until their bones were broken.However, according to the caster's mana, the things that could be controlled would be different.The easiest to control was a person or animal that had just died. Then, it was the kind that had been dead for a long time. After that, it was the living beasts and birds. When one cultivated it to the highest level, he would be able to control a living person.In this world, there were very few people who could master the Zhenlong Chess Game to its peak. However, during the era when Mo Ran was called the Emperor, he had already mastered the Zhenlong Chess Game to the point of perfection.Back then, in the battle of life and death with Chu Wanning, he laid out a hundred-foot long scroll, splashed ink as a chessboard, and scattered beans to form soldiers.In that battle, hundreds of thousands of chess pieces were placed at the same time. As a result, sparrow feathers covered the sky, golden crows sank to the west, serpents broke through the water, and the sea churned.Mo Ran summoned countless beasts and birds, and controlled an endless army of living people.Such a scene would be difficult to see even in the Asura Hell.The fox corpse before him was obviously controlled by the Zhenlong Chess Game. However, other than the Zhenlong Chess Game, there was another layer of magic \u2014 the Camouflage Spell.According to legend, after the ancestor of the Green Hill Fox Clan died, the fur he left behind was made into forty-nine pieces of fox skin magic treasures of different sizes.As long as someone's blood was taken, dripped on the fox skin, and used the fur to cover anything, even if it was wrapped in a piece of rotten wood, it could become the object of that person's desire.This fox corpse was wrapped in such a magic treasure. However, its changes could only be seen in the eyes of the owner of the blood. In the eyes of others, it was still the same. There would not be any changes.It did not take much effort to rescue Mo Ran. After successfully getting him out, Chu Wanning explained the situation to him clearly.Mo Ran's biggest confusion was, \"Honored Master, how did you know that the Gou Chen Upper Palace was fake?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChu Wanning said, \"If it was the real Gou Chen Upper Palace, how could it only move dead objects and not living people?Although this person's magic power is not bad, it is definitely not on the same level as an Incipient God. \"This made sense, but Mo Ran was still suspicious, \"Did Master only know that the person was an imposter when he saw this \u2026 this dead fox?\"Chu Wanning shook his head, \"No.\"\"Then how did you know \u2026\"Chu Wanning said, \"Do you remember what this Gou Chen asked me when he appeared?\"Mo Ran thought for a while, \"I think he asked about your weapon?\"\"That's right,\" Chu Wanning said, \"I didn't hide the Divine Martial aura on my body, so he could sense it.However, as the Master of Weapons, he didn't realize that I had two of Jin Chengchi's weapons, and I only had one.At that time, I was suspicious, but since it was related to the sword, I couldn't say much. However, I kept an eye on everything I did, so I didn't fall into his trap. \"\"But \u2026\" Mo Ran said, \"If he wasn't the Gou Chen Upper Palace, how could he forge the Divine Martial?\"\"First, the Gou Chen forging swords is only a rumor. No one really knows why there are so many weapons at the bottom of this lake, so the Divine Martial might not be made by the Gou Chen.Second, this person only took the weapons from the Divine Martial Armory for you to choose from, so no one knows if those weapons are his or not.Also, I carefully looked at Xue Meng's and Shi Mei's weapons \u2014 they are fake. \"Mo Ran was shocked when he heard this. \"Imitation?\"\"Yes.\"\"\u2026\" Mo Ran was stunned for a while, then he thought of himself, \"Then what the hell \u2026?\"Chu Wanning said, \"The hell is real.However, his goal isn't just to give you the weapons. \"\"Then what does he want to do?\"Mo Ran said as he looked at the strange fox corpse on the stone bed with disgust, \"First, he put in so much effort to lock us in the secret room, then he made this thing to disgust us.What are you after? \"Chu Wanning said, \"For you.\"\"Ah?\"\"You were only half right just now.That Gouchen didn't go through so much trouble to lock us up. In the end, the one he wants is you. \"\"What does he want from me?\" Mo Ran laughed dryly. \"I'm just an idiot.\"Chu Wanning said, \"I've never seen an idiot who could form a spirit cultivator within a year.\"Mo Ran was about to say something when he seemed to have realized something and suddenly froze.Was Chu Wanning \u2026 praising him?This realization made his heart beat faster. He opened his eyes wide and stared at Chu Wanning. After a while, he slowly blinked his eyes. His face, which had always been thick-skinned, actually turned slightly red.Chu Wanning didn't look at him. Instead, he muttered, \"Also, Tianwen and Jianghui seem to have some connection with the willow tree in the courtyard. I once read in an ancient book that when Gouchen descended to the mortal world, he brought back three willow branches from the Heavenly Court.However, the ancient book was very lost. I never knew what Gouchen did with the three willow branches. \"He paused for a while, then continued, \"However, if the rumor is true, it seems that Tianwen, Jianghui, and the old tree in the courtyard are the three willow branches.Two of them became Divine Martial Arts, and one of them was cut at the bottom of Jincheng Lake, becoming a powerful guard of Gouchen's armory. \"Mo Ran said, \"But what does this have to do with me?\"Chu Wanning shook his head. \"How is it not related? You're the one who awakened Jianghui.\"Mo Ran sighed. \"Like I said, Jianghui is really Jianghui!\"\"I'm guessing that his final request is related to the willow tree in the courtyard.However, from what I know now, this is all I can guess.I can't think of anything else for now. \"Although most of these were just Chu Wanning's guesses, Mo Ran felt that Chu Wanning was very smart, so his guesses should be close to the mark.While thinking about this, they walked quickly in the dark underwater secret passage.After passing through the passageway with many twists and turns, they finally arrived at the exit. They took advantage of the time when the Flood Dragon Human patrolling back and forth was unprepared to escape.The entrance to the underground secret room was located in the courtyard where the giant willow tree was planted. As soon as they came out, the scene in front of them gave Mo Ran a huge shock.There were four coffins in front of the giant willow tree. One of them was empty, while the other three had Chu Wanning, Shi Mei, and Xue Meng lying in them.Mo Ran's face turned pale. \"What's going on?!\"Chu Wanning said, \"These are Corpse Sacrificial Coffins. Look at the edge of the coffin, there's a vine attached to it, and the other end is connected to the giant willow tree.The fake North Star only needed you. After he drugged us, he had the Flood Dragon Human bring you to the secret room and put the three of us in these coffins.Through the Corpse Sacrificial Coffins, he can transfer the spiritual cultivation of the people in the coffins to the giant willow tree.It's just like sucking blood. \"Seeing Mo Ran's ugly expression, Chu Wanning said, \"Don't worry, Shi Mei and Xue Meng are not injured.At that time, I pretended to be unconscious and waited for an opportunity to get rid of the three Flood Dragon Human guarding the coffins. The three people you see now are actually the corpses of those demons. \"His words were simple, but Mo Ran couldn't help but lift his eyelashes and sneak a glance at him.How deep was the cultivation of the Flood Dragon Human in the Jincheng Pool?Chu Wanning's so-called \"waiting for an opportunity to get rid of the Flood Dragon Human\" meant that he had to quietly get rid of all three of them in one strike.How good was this person's skills \u2026?It had been too many years since he fought on par with Chu Wanning, so when Mo Ran heard this, he was momentarily dazed. It was as if the shocking figure of his previous life flashed before his eyes. His face was slightly tilted, and his eyes were like stars.Chu Wanning saw that he was in a daze, so he asked, \"What's wrong?\"Mo Ran was suddenly jolted awake, and hurriedly said, \"Nothing.\"\"\u2026\"\"I just find it strange, how did Master turn the Flood Dragon Human into this?\"Chu Wanning sneered and said, \"It's just a trick. Do you think I don't know the fake North Star Imperial Palace Meeting?I left my fake body here to avoid being discovered by those loaches.As the saying goes, give them a taste of their own medicine. \"Mo Ran, \"\u2026\"This place was dangerous, so the two of them could not stay for long. After resting for a while, they immediately left.However, when they ran to the agreed location with Xue Meng, they saw that it was empty. There was not a single person there.Mo Ran's face turned pale, \"Where's Shi Mei?!\"Chu Wanning's expression changed slightly, but he did not answer. Instead, he lifted his ring finger, and a layer of golden light appeared on the tip of his finger.Before going to Xuying Peak, he had pinned a begonia flower on each of his three disciples for tracking purposes.After a while, Chu Wanning cursed in a low voice and retracted the light. \"Something must have happened here as well. They must be trying to avoid the Flood Dragon Humans patrolling the area. The two of them have already escaped from this mansion and are heading towards the market.Let's go and take a look. \"The two of them were extremely skilled, so they quickly avoided all the patrolling Flood Dragon Human. They flew over the tall courtyard wall and headed to the market that the North Star Imperial Palace brought them to during the day.There should be no day or night under the water, but Jin Chenghu was different from other places. He could sense the rising of the sun and the setting of the moon.At this time, the long night had broken, and the sun was rising from the east.Mo Ran saw that the market in Jin Chenghu had already started in the morning. The market was bustling with activity, and he could not help but feel slightly relieved.It seemed that Shi Mei and the rest were fine. Otherwise, this place would not be so peaceful.For some reason, Chu Wanning's expression was not particularly good, but he did not say anything. He silently pulled Mo Ran over.\"Master?\"\"Come here.\"\"What's wrong?\"\"Don't go too far.\"Chu Wanning's voice seemed to be filled with self-blame, even though he was as cold as usual, \"Xue Meng and Shi Mei have already gone missing. I'm afraid that if I'm not careful, you'll also \u2026\"Mo Ran saw that Chu Wanning's face was somewhat pale, as if he was worried about him. At first, he was stunned. Then, for some reason, his heart faintly moved, and he opened his mouth to comfort him, \"I won't go missing. Let's go, Master. Let's quickly go find them.\"As he spoke, he walked forward, and at the same time, he turned his wrist and casually grabbed Chu Wanning's hand.\"\u2026 \u2026\" Chu Wanning's fingertips seemed to tremble slightly in his palm.But that tremble was too quick and too light. Mo Ran was worried about Shi Mei, so he did not pay much attention to it. He only thought that it was his own illusion.\"Fish blood mantou, freshly made fish blood mantou.\"\"The snake slough of the Ruiran snake, the best material for clothing. Last three feet, if it's sold out, I'll have to wait for this servant to shed my skin next time.\"\"Selling cuttlefish daiko, this young master just spat out some ink this morning. It's perfect to use this daiko to draw \u2014 hey, hey, young lady, don't go.\"The sounds of hawking in the market did not stop, and the strange sights were too much for the eyes to take in.Mo Ran grinned as he pulled Chu Wanning two steps forward. Suddenly, he realized that something was wrong. He stopped abruptly, and his eyes widened in an instant. It was as if his blood had turned cold in an instant.Something was wrong!Something was wrong here!He looked around, and sure enough \u2026 \u2026A headless ghost was sitting in front of a stall selling hair brushes and cosmetics. A pair of long nails with bright red cardamom was holding a comb. She placed her bloody head on her knees. While combing her hair, she said softly, \"A fine bone comb. Customer, take one with you.\"It was true!It was really true!In this bustling city, everyone's actions, words, and expressions were exactly the same as when Gouchen had brought them to the palace yesterday!Mo Ran suddenly took two steps back and bumped into Chu Wanning's arms. He immediately raised his head and said hoarsely, \"Master, this is?\"Chu Wanning seemed to have expected this, but when he saw it with his own eyes, his heart sank. He grabbed Mo Ran tightly.\"How can this be?What is this?Is this a mirage? \"Chu Wanning shook his head, but after thinking for a while, he suddenly said slowly, \"Mo Ran, have you ever thought about this? There are many strange beasts in the Jincheng Pond, and some of them have seen the real Gouchen Upper Palace.So, why can't they recognize this impersonator? \"Mo Ran's face was pale, and he was a little frightened, \"That's \u2026 right.\"Chu Wanning said, \"Let me ask you again, if you were the one impersonating the Gouchen Upper Palace and hiding in the Jincheng Pond, how would you make others say what you want to say, do what you want to do, and act for you?\"Mo Ran suddenly understood.This was a delicate chess game!Once the black and white pieces fell, the world would follow the heart.No one knew the power of this forbidden technique better than him.He almost blurted it out, but when he saw Chu Wanning's gaze, he immediately stopped.How could a sixteen-year-old like him think of the Three Great Forbidden Techniques so easily?Mo Ran said, \"This is very difficult.\"\"No.\" Chu Wanning said, \"This is very simple.\"He paused, then said, \"It's fine as long as they're all dead.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBefore Mo Ran could say anything, he suddenly heard a shrill voice behind him, \"Make way, make way!Let me through first! \"Was it that Bi 'an?!The Bi 'an carried the heavy rocks and crawled forward with all its might. As usual, it arrived in front of the pharmacy and shouted, \"I can't take it anymore!Someone, please come and save my life! \"A white-haired Flood Dragon Person swam out, but his Flood Dragon Person's tail was completely different from the other Flood Dragon Person's. His entire body was flowing with gold, shining with a beautiful luster. His white hair was tied up with a simple hairpin, hanging down to his shoulders.Although his face was full of wrinkles, the shape of his face was well-proportioned. His nose bridge was tall and straight, and the curve of his lips was also very appropriate. A pair of golden eyes were hazy in the mist. One could imagine that this person must have been extremely handsome when he was young.Mo Ran shivered.It wasn't like this before. Where was that green Flood Dragon?This old Flood Dragon Person glanced at them from afar, but didn't say anything. Instead, he came to the doorsill, bent down, and removed the rocks that the Bi 'an was carrying one by one.When the last rock was removed, the illusion was broken. The Bi 'an suddenly exploded. In an instant, pus and blood splattered everywhere like mist.Almost at the same time, all the demons and monsters in the market stiffened. Then, their entire bodies turned soft and pus flowed out. They all turned into the stinking blood that pervaded the lake.The lake was instantly dyed red. As the color of the blood became darker and darker, Mo Ran and Chu Wanning soon found it difficult to see things in the distance. After that, they couldn't see anything close to them. In the end, everything in front of them was scarlet red. They couldn't even see their own fingers.Chu Wanning said, \"Mo Ran.\"Mo Ran understood him too well. He didn't even need Chu Wanning to say anything. He said, \"Shizun, don't worry. I'm here.\"Chu Wanning didn't say much, or maybe he was too clumsy. After a moment of silence, he only said, \"Be careful.\"The blood was blurred. Mo Ran couldn't see the face that wouldn't change even if the sky collapsed. However, he could more easily sense the concern in his shizun's voice.He rarely felt Chu Wanning's warmth. At this moment, he suddenly felt a warmth in his chest. He held the other's hand even tighter and replied, \"Alright.\"The two were back to back close. Although they couldn't see each other, they could feel each other's heartbeat.The situation was strange. Chu Wanning summoned Heaven's Inquisition. Mo Ran also recovered his spiritual energy and summoned Hell's Witness.Not long after they had summoned their shizun, he suddenly said said said, \"Shizun, shizun, look over there!\"Chu Wanning turned around. Right at the entrance of the pharmacy where the old Flood Dragon Person was cleaning up the stones, dozens of white light spots of different sizes suddenly appeared on the ground.The two of them went hand in hand. When they got closer, they realized that the light spots were indeed the stones left behind by Bi 'an.These shizun were neatly arranged in three rows by the Said Flood Dragon Person. Each shizun was emitting a gentle radiance.Slowly, a figure gradually appeared in front of the shizun. It seemed to be the white-haired Flood Dragon Person from before.Mo Ran tried asking, \"Who are you?\"The person didn't answer. He looked at Chu Wanning, then looked at Mo Ran. Then, he silently raised his hand and pointed at the shizun on the ground.Mo Ran asked, \"You want us to pick up this shizun?\"The white-haired Flood Dragon Person nodded, then extended a finger.\"You mean \u2026 pick up one shizun?\"The white-haired Flood Dragon Person nodded, then shook his head. He pointed at Mo Ran, then pointed at Chu Wanning.Mo Ran understood, \"So, each of us pick up one shizun?\"This time, the white-haired Flood Dragon Person nodded. Then, he stopped moving. He stared at the two with wide eyes.Mo Ran asked, \"Shizun, do we listen to him?\"\"Let's do as he says. We don't have any other ideas for now anyway.\"Thus, the two of them picked up a shizun each. Who would have thought that when their fingertips touched the shizun, a dazzling radiance flashed before their eyes. The world spun, and a myriad of colors flowed past them.When everything returned to stillness, the boundless blood-red color suddenly disappeared.When they looked carefully, they were actually transported to the Divine Martial Storehouse!\"Shizun!!\"\"Shizun, Mo Ran!!\"Xue Meng and Shi Mei were actually here too. When they saw Chu Wanning, the two of them were surprised and happy. They came over to welcome him.They didn't expect that the shizun would actually have a teleportation spell attached to it. Chu Wanning was still slightly disgusted by the rapid rotation just now. He held his forehead with one hand, but the other hand was still tightly holding Mo Ran.In the blood lake, Mo Ran's hands were interlocked with his, never letting go.Because of Chu Wanning's identity, he rarely had the chance to hold Mo Ran's hand. Most of the time, he could only stand not far away and watch his disciples being intimate.Thus, the rare warmth in his palm made him feel a little cautious and cherish it \u2026\"Shi Mei!\"However, the warmth that was extremely precious to him, in the eyes of another person, might be as light as a worn-out shoe, or not worth mentioning. More likely, they wouldn't even notice it.The moment he saw Shi Mei, Mo Ran naturally let go of his hand.Chu Wanning's fingertips moved slightly. For a moment, it seemed like he wanted to hold on to him.But what reason did he have?He already didn't have the courage to like others.He didn't want to lose even that little bit of pitiful pride.Seeing how happy Mo Ran was when he saw Shi Mei, and how naturally he hugged Shi Mei and rubbed his hair.Chu Wanning's fingertips hung down.He looked a little dazed and a little embarrassed.Fortunately.His face was always dull, and his emotions were not so obvious.Probably because he was old, and his body was stiff, after being in the transportation formation for so long, his heart was a little cold.But fortunately, there was still a little warmth in his fingertips.Relying on the remnant of warmth that would soon dissipate, he slowly straightened himself up, and straightened his expression and eyes, and put them back in order and tidied them up.\"Shizun, are you okay?Why is your face so pale \u2026 \"Chu Wanning nodded towards Xue Meng and said, \"No harm.\"After a pause, he asked, \"You were also sent here by that merman?\"Before Xue Meng could speak, he heard a gurgling sound of bubbles.Chu Wanning turned his head and suddenly saw half a bloody face. Then, with a whoosh, a person with a twisted figure jumped out of the boiling Sword Forging Pool!This was definitely not a mortal, or definitely not a living person. No mortal could soak in burning molten iron and still live.On the other hand, although this person's skin was burnt and his flesh was mangled, it was obvious that he was still breathing.Four chains shackled his four limbs, immobilizing him in the furnace and causing him to suffer great pain.He slowly opened his eyes and bowed to everyone, with a pleading look in his eyes, he asked them to gather by the Sword Forging Pool.He didn't know how to speak, but it didn't mean that he didn't know how to express himself. He waved his arm that was made of white bones and flesh. The molten iron in the pool suddenly stirred up a small wave. The wave slowly twisted into a few lines of ancient characters in the air.Xue Meng said in shock, \"What are these words?Why can't I understand a single one? \"Chu Wanning said, \"It's the ancient book of Cangjie, I haven't taught you.\"Mo Ran said, \"Then \u2014 what's written here?\"Chu Wanning went forward and said, \"\u2026 He wants \u2026 to ask for help.\"The ancient book of Cangjie was said to be written in the language of the Heaven Realm. Many of them were lost in the human world, and only a few people knew it. Even a grandmaster like Chu Wanning could not recognize all the characters.However, the general content was still easy to read.Chu Wanning looked carefully for a while and slowly translated, \"He said that he was the spirit of this willow tree.He was called the Heart-Picking Willow. When he was still a seedling, he was brought to the human world by the North Star Palace from the Seven Heavens of the God Realm.After that, the North Star Palace left the world for some reason. The Heart-Picking Willow never saw him again, and he did not know if he was dead or alive. \"\"However, regardless of whether the North Star Palace was still around, the Heart-Picking Willow followed his instructions. For hundreds of thousands of years, he guarded the Jincheng Pool and the Divine Martial Library.Gradually, he was nourished by the spiritual energy and transformed into a human form.After that, everything was normal, until one day, there was a \u2014 \"Chu Wanning suddenly stopped and did not continue reading.Mo Ran asked curiously, \"What's wrong?\"\"\u2026 I don't recognize these three words.It seems to be a person's name. \"As Chu Wanning spoke, he raised his hand and pointed at the complicated words on the board, \"In short, this person came to the Jincheng Pool.His magic power was strong, and he was cruel and merciless. He killed all the living beings in the pool and controlled them with a delicate chess game.Even the Heart-Picking Willow was not spared. \"Mo Ran immediately said, \"This person is most likely the fake North Star Palace!\"When the Heart-Picking Willow heard him say that, its eyes lit up, and it immediately nodded twice.\"\u2026 You guessed it right.\"Mo Ran laughed embarrassedly and scratched his head. \"Haha, I didn't expect that I would be so smart.\"Chu Waning glanced at him and continued, \"I'm not sure.\"All these years, the Heart-Picking Willow has been in a state of insanity, and it has never been awake for half a day. Fortunately, the other two willow branches that were once connected to it, Tianwen and Ghoul, have both awakened.Using their power, the Heart-Picking Willow temporarily regained its consciousness.Otherwise, I'm afraid that it would have lost control and killed everyone here. \"\"Everyone\" heard this, either in disbelief or fear. The three youths raised their heads and stared at the spiritual body in the Sword-Forging Pool, not knowing how to interpret its self-narration.Mo Ran said, \"Senior Willow \u2026\"Xue Meng said, \"Senior Willow?\"\"What else should I call you? Senior Plucker?\" Mo Ran rolled his eyes at Xue Meng and continued, \"Let me say something that you might not like to hear.Your words are a little hard to justify. \"Although the Heart-Picking Willow could not speak, it could understand Mo Ran's words. It turned its head.Mo Ran said, \"First, you said that you were bewitched by the fake North Star Palace, then you said that you regained your consciousness because of the spiritual energy after Tianwen and Ghoul woke up.But Ghoul was given to me by the fake North Star Palace. Didn't he know what the consequences would be? \"The Heart-Picking Willow shook its head, and the words in front of Chu Wanning changed.\"I'm a tree in the Realm of Gods. He doesn't know much about me, so he doesn't know that Shenwu can affect my mind.He needs my power to study the three great forbidden techniques. In recent years, because I'm about to die, he's been very anxious and has been searching for a way to extend my life.But I don't want to live anymore. I'd rather die than be an accomplice to a villain. Unfortunately, I'm under his control and can't do as I please \u2026 \"Chu Wanning read until here and pondered, \"That's why he let Mo Ran come to the bottom of the pool. Mo Ran is the essence of the Wood Spirit. The fake North Star Palace probably wants to combine the spiritual energy of Mo Ran and Ghoul and sacrifice it to you.\"The Heart-Picking Willow nodded.Mo Ran was still confused, \"But the fake North Star Palace said that there are two essences of the Wood Spirit, and Master is one of them. Why did he lock me up?\"The Heart-Picking Willow wrote, \"Since ancient times, it's best to use the young as a sacrifice. It's even more important to use it on a tree spirit.In addition, the sacrifice needs to be full of food and drink. Their seven emotions and six desires must be satisfied before their life is taken away from them in the blissful illusion.If that's not the case, the sacrifice will have regrets. If their resentment grows, they'll wither faster. \"When he said that.Mo Ran immediately thought of the fox demon that turned into Chu Wanning in the secret chamber.So it was to satisfy his lust. It was like feeding a pig until it was fat before it was slaughtered. Only then would it taste good.This explained why he saw Chu Wanning and not Shi Mei.He cherished and pitied Shi Mei, so he didn't dare to play around with him.In terms of lust, his desire for Chu Wanning was much stronger than Shi Mei's \u2026Chu Wanning saw Mo Ran's strange expression and thought that he still had lingering fears. He wanted to comfort him, so he asked, \"What are you thinking about?\"\"No, nothing.\"Seeing Mo Ran blushing, Chu Wanning was stunned for a moment. He suddenly understood and stopped talking. After a while, he turned his head in anger.How was this kid still having lingering fears?It turned out that he was recalling the so-called 'seven emotions and six desires' and started to fantasize.Chu Wanning angrily flung his sleeves and scolded in a low voice with a cold face, \"Shameless.\"Mo Ran was speechless.Fortunately, Chu Wanning didn't know who was satisfying his lust in the illusion. If he knew, would he skin him alive?While she was letting her imagination run wild, all of a sudden, the floor of the Divine Armory shook violently. Xue Meng was shocked. \"What's going on?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBefore the Heart-Picking Willow could answer, his face quickly distorted. He raised his hand and held his head in pain. He opened his mouth and made a silent scream.Although he couldn't make a sound, his ferocious expression and bulging eyes seemed to make people hear a heart-wrenching scream.Help.Help!!!!His lips twisted into an unimaginable arc, and veins of blood quickly covered his entire eyeball. If it weren't for the four chains binding him, he would have already flown up and committed suicide in a fit of rage.\"I beg you \u2026 hurry \u2026 destroy me \u2026\"It seemed that the time limit for the Heart-Picking Willow to recover his mind was up. The Heart-Picking Willow struggled in pain, but it was useless. A black gas rushed out of the Sword Pool and constantly attacked the body of the Willow in the pool. For a time, the iron chains clanged and sparks splashed.Chu Wanning saw that the situation had changed. He quickly waved his sleeve and blocked his disciple behind him. With a fierce face, he asked the Heart-Picking Willow, \"How can I save you?\"Although the Heart-Picking Willow moved slowly, he could drive the molten iron of the Sword Pool to form the Ancient Book of Cangjie in an instant.\"I am about to lose my consciousness. At that time, you will be hurt, not my heart.I can't help you with the rest, and I can't tell you in detail.I can only tell you the spells I know. Please be careful \u2026 \"The molten iron suddenly changed.\"There are three spells I am good at.First, Dream of Nanke.This is the Illusion Spell. The victim will get what he wants in a deep sleep, and the dream will last forever. Because of this, even if someone's spiritual power is strong enough to perceive that this is an illusion, he will still be willing to indulge in it and never wake up.Second, Confusion Spell. It uses the greed in people's hearts as a lure to make them kill each other.Third, Mind Picking Spell \u2026 \"However, at this time, his spiritual power had been used to the extreme. He couldn't move the molten iron to form more words.He had no idea what kind of ability the Heart Extraction Technique was.The Heart-Picking Willow struggled for a while and suddenly burst out a bloody mist. He couldn't move the molten iron, but he still used his finger to touch the blood that burst out. He stared at Chu Wanning with his twitching eyes. His eyes were bulging, and he was extremely unwilling.\"Shizun!\" Seeing that Chu Wanning was about to step forward, Xue Meng hurriedly pulled him back. \"Don't go, I'm afraid it's a trap!\"Heart-Plucking Willow couldn't say anything. She just dangled her blood-stained finger. Suddenly, tears flowed out of her eyes.Chu Wanning: \"\u2026 You want me to go?\"Heart-Picking Willow nodded slowly.\"\u2026\"\"Master!\"Xue Meng wanted to stop him again, but Chu Wanning shook his head at him. He walked forward alone to the edge of the Sword Forging Pool and extended his hand.Heart-Picking Willow seemed to be quite moved. He looked deeply at Chu Wanning and struggled to wave the arm with flesh hanging on it, as if he wanted to salute. Then, he endured the great pain and grabbed Chu Wanning's hand. He trembled as he wrote in the other's palm:Draw lots, break the nightmare \u2026Don't \u2026 lose \u2026 your \u2026 mind \u2026Nightmare \u2026 break \u2026 calamity \u2026 exterminate!!Before the last word could be written, the Heart-Picking Willow suddenly collapsed like a pile of mud. It fell back into the boiling Sword Forging Pool and disappeared.At the same time, there was a huge bang. A huge wave of scarlet red water suddenly surged from the Sword Pool. The surging iron water split the air, and nine dragon-shaped pillars of fire rose from the ground. Chu Wanning was forced to retreat by this terrifying wave. The light of the flames illuminated his pitch-black eyes.Suddenly, four lots appeared from the molten iron pillars and hung high in the air.Shi Mei remembered what Heart-Picking Willow had told him when he was awake. He hurriedly said: \"Is this \u2026 the drawing lots that Heart-Picking Willow mentioned?\"Seeing him come closer, Chu Wanning stopped him: \"Don't touch it, all of you go behind me.\"Shi Mei: \"Master \u2026\"\"With me here, it will be fine.\" Chu Wanning said: \"You can't take the risk. Wait until I'm done drawing lots, then you can come back.\"These words were said indifferently, as if there were no fluctuations of emotion, but Mo Ran's heart moved when he heard it.For some reason, the Chu Wanning in front of him suddenly overlapped with the emotionless person in his previous life who coldly watched his disciple die.If he could say such words, how could he watch his disciple die without doing anything in his previous life?Mo Ran suddenly felt that he seemed to have never understood Chu Wanning as a person.He couldn't help but murmur: \"Master \u2026\"Chu Wan-ning didn't pay any attention to them. He raised his hand and took one of the talismans. The talisman was made of light yellow jade. He flipped through both sides of the talisman and murmured, \"Hmm?\"\"What's wrong?\" Xue Meng asked.Chu Wanning said: \"There's not a single word on this lot.\"\"How can that be?\" Xue Meng said curiously: \"Then I'll try.\"The four lots were drawn.Xue Meng and Shi Mei's situation was exactly the same as Chu Wanning's. There were no words on the jade pieces. Mo Ran flipped over his lot and suddenly opened his eyes:\"Ding Guyu?\"The other three immediately looked at him. Xue Meng frowned: \"What's Ding Guyu?\"Mo Ran poked his lot: \"It's written here.\"Xue Meng leaned over to take a look and suddenly said angrily: \"Bah!You've read all the words you can recognize, haven't you? \"\"\u2026 \u2026 It's Blood Drop Hourglass.\" Chu Wanning suddenly said.He could recognize most of the words in the ancient book of Cangjie. If there were words he wasn't sure about, he wouldn't say nonsense. Therefore, since he said it was Blood Drop Hourglass, he wouldn't make a mistake.Mo Ran was stunned: \"What does Blood Drop Hourglass mean?\"Chu Wanning shook his head: \"I don't know.\"However, as if to answer them, a muffled rumble suddenly came from the high dome of the Shen Wu Warehouse. A huge hourglass fell from the sky, mottled with copper rust.But unlike the other hourglasses, there was a cross-shaped copper frame on top of it. No one knew what it was for.Chu Wanning looked at the hourglass and then looked down at the lot in Mo Ran's hand.Blood Drop Hourglass.In a flash, he suddenly understood what the so-called \"drawing lots\" meant.Chu Wanning's expression changed instantly. He shouted: \"Mo Ran, throw that lot away!\"Although Mo Ran didn't know what Chu Wan-ning meant, he subconsciously obeyed her order without a second thought.But he didn't know if he didn't throw it away. Once he threw it away, Mo Ran found that the lot was attached to his palm by some unknown force. He couldn't get rid of it.Chu Wanning cursed secretly. He rushed forward and was about to exchange his lot with Mo Ran's.Unexpectedly, the rusty copper hourglass suddenly stretched out dozens of sharp thorns and attacked Mo Ran!\"Get out of the way!\"\"Shizun!!!\"\"Shizun!\"In an instant, blood splattered everywhere. At the critical moment, Chu Wanning pushed Mo Ran away with his palm. The thorns were like arrows piercing through the forest, piercing Chu Wanning's flesh.Mo Ran was now in his youth form. Naturally, he couldn't withstand Chu Wanning's attack. He was pushed back and fell to the ground.But the sound of flesh tearing was so clear and terrifying. Xue Meng and Shi Mei's distorted voices were so sharp and piercing.It was impossible.How could it be \u2026That was Chu Wanning. That was Chu Wanning who beat him and scolded him. That was Chu Wanning who, for his own power, cruelly watched as his disciple died in front of him. That was Chu Wanning who coldly said, \"Bad character, hard to cultivate\". That was \u2026Mo Ran looked up.In the chaos, he saw that person's blood splattered three feet away. Sharp and dense thorns pierced through that person's back and came out from the front of his clothes. The thorns were precisely where he had received the ruthless blow from the ghost emcee.Before the old injury healed, his fascia was torn again, and his flesh was mangled.That was \u2026 that was Chu Wanning who used his own body to protect him in the coffin. Even when his body was pierced by sharp claws, he endured and didn't make a sound \u2026That was Chu Wanning who hid under the stone bridge and secretly released a formation to shelter everyone from the wind and rain but didn't dare to show his face.That was Chu Wanning who, in his previous life, clumsily went to the kitchen to make Shi Mei have the mood to eat after his death.That was the person he was most familiar with. That had a bad temper, a bad mouth, was afraid of bitter medicine, and coughed when eating spicy food.That was the person he often couldn't remember to care about. He gnashed his teeth in hatred, but he also felt that she was very pitiful \u2026Chu Wanning.Wanning \u2026\"Shizun!!!\" Mo Ran shouted hoarsely. He scrambled to get closer to Chu Wanning. \"Shizun!!!!\"\"Your lot \u2026\" Chu Wanning raised his trembling hand. His face was deathly pale, but his eyes were still fierce. \"Give it to me \u2026\"In the palm he extended to Mo Ran, he spread out the blank lot he had drawn. Because of the pain, his arm trembled slightly, and he slowly raised it with difficulty.Chu Wanning's eyes were very bright, very determined, and covered with a layer of moisture.\"Quick, give it to me!\"Mo Ran didn't even have time to get up. He knelt and crawled to Chu Wanning. He looked at the horrifying wound that had flipped open his flesh and blood in bewilderment.\"No \u2026 Shizun \u2026\"\"Shizun!!\"Xue Meng and Shi Mei wanted to come over, but Chu Wanning seemed to have a resentful expression. He waved down a barrier, repelling the two of them.Then he shouted sternly, \"Heaven's Inquisition!!!\"Heaven's Inquisition responded and cut off the dozens of sharp vines that pierced Chu Wanning!However, those vines were not ordinary objects. Chu Wanning could clearly feel them devouring his spiritual energy in his flesh and blood.There was no other way. He could only grit his teeth and raise his hand to grab the broken vines. He steeled his heart and pulled the vines out!In an instant, blood gushed out!Chu Wanning threw the broken vines away. He gasped for breath and pressed on his spirit meridians and acupoints to stop the blood loss for now.Then, he glared at Mo Ran with a pair of bright black eyes and said hoarsely, \"Give it to me.\"\"Shizun \u2026\"\"Give me your lot in exchange!I'll give it to you! \"Chu Wanning said sternly.Mo Ran finally understood what the so-called \"Blood Dripping Hourglass\" meant.The ruthless method that the North Star set up a million years ago was very similar to the method he used to torture Chu Wanning in his previous life.Sure enough, regardless of whether it was gods, devils, humans, or ghosts, when they were vicious, the idea of digging out one's heart was very similar.Blood Dripping Hourglass.It was to use human blood to replace fine sand and flowing water, and pour it into the hourglass to measure time.When the human blood was drained, the time was up.In his previous life, when he was crowned as the Emperor Ta, didn't he use Chu Wanning as the hourglass? He wanted Chu Wanning to personally watch him step on the heads of the immortal sects, and wanted Chu Wanning's blood to run dry in front of him?However, in this life, before the North Star set up the Blood Dripping Hourglass.Chu Wanning was willing to take the initiative to exchange his lot for his own safety. He was willing to walk on the bronze rack for him. He \u2026Mo Ran's heart was in chaos.He couldn't even think.How could this be \u2026How could this be!The copper hourglass didn't hit its target and didn't bind its target. It waved its vines again, preparing for the second wave of attacks.Chu Wanning looked at him, and the light in his eyes trembled slightly.He was in so much pain that his face was pale. He panted slightly, \"Mo Ran, you \u2026 listen to me. Hurry up and give it to me.\"\"\u2026\"\"Hurry up \u2026\" Chu Wanning's face was as pale as fresh snow under the moon, \"\u2026 Don't tell me you want me to block the second wave of attacks for you?!\"\"Master \u2026\"The vines pounced on them again.Mo Ran raised his hand at that moment, and Chu Wanning reached out his hand without hesitation.Unexpectedly, just as their palms were about to touch, Mo Ran's eyes flashed with a bright light. He quickly retracted his hand and blocked the defenseless Chu Wanning behind him. At the same time, the second wave of vines arrived. Mo Ran met it head-on. The young man's body was instantly engulfed by the vines and pulled in front of the copper hourglass.\"Mo Ran!!\"Dozens of willow vines coiled around him and tied him tightly to the cross.Mo Ran turned his face and glanced at Chu Wanning. His lips moved.Chu Wanning's eyes widened.Mo Ran's voice wasn't too loud, but he heard it clearly. There was no mistaking it.Mo Ran said, \"Master, I'm really not \u2026 bad habits are hard to change \u2026\"So, can you not give up on me?\u2014 \u2014However, he couldn't say the second half of the sentence.In his previous life, he didn't say it. In this life, it was already too late.Whether Chu Wanning gave up on him or not, he didn't see it as important anymore.He just didn't want to owe this person anything.He was very stupid. He already couldn't figure out his feelings for Chu Wanning. He didn't want to be more confused because of this.In this life, Mo Ran thought, the only person he cared about, the only person he cared about, was Shi Mei.The reason why he didn't want to exchange with Chu Wanning was because he didn't want to receive this person's kindness for no reason. He just didn't want \u2026He didn't want to see Chu Wanning bleed dry again.He, Mo Weiyu, wasn't a stubborn stone. The happiest thing in his life was that someone was willing to treat him well.If it was just a little bit better, he would be able to smile from ear to ear.If it was just a little bit better, then even if he had to die, he would be willing.In the midst of the dense vines, a dazzling sharp sword suddenly appeared.That sword looked like a divine weapon. Although it was simple and unadorned, there was a sense of heroism that hit the face.There were two ridges on the left and right. The teeth of the sword head were like thorns. The sword case was thin and narrow, inlaid with a relief sculpture of a bull's head and a dragon's body. The decorations were complex. The body of the sword flowed with a blue radiance.Mo Ran only had time to see the two words \"North Star\" on the sword. He didn't even have time to see the whole \"Upper Palace\" before this sword, which belonged to the God of Weapons, pierced straight into his ribs.Blood flowed out in an instant, converging into an hourglass.At the same time, a curtain of water suddenly fell from the Divine Armory, separating Mo Ran and Chu Wanning from each other.Everyone was blocked by this sudden torrent.Shi Mei shouted, \"Mo Ran!!Mo Ran \u2014 \u2014! \"The turbulent water veil obscured their vision, making it impossible for them to see Mo Ran's situation clearly. Chu Wanning tried to break through the water several times, but he was pushed back again and again by the violent current. In the end, his entire body was drenched. His dark brows pressed down on his anxious face, and his lips were pale and miserable.Chu Wanning said in a hoarse voice,\"Mo Ran \u2014 \u2014!\"His voice wasn't loud, but it was trembling badly.He didn't notice it himself, but Shi Mei was suddenly shocked. He looked sideways at him, only to see that his usually calm and composed master was in a sorry state. His long and thick eyelashes were trembling, and there was a trace of uncontrollable concern in his expression.Seeing that he had called Tianwen over, his brows were full of ruthlessness, like a bowstring that was stretched to the limit.Shi Mei felt uneasy. He pulled him back and shouted, \"Shizun, don't go!You can't go in! \"Chu Wanning shook his hand and ignored him. His eyes were as sharp as a knife. He silently propped up a barrier and insisted on going forward.But the water curtain contained Jin Chengchi's Heaven and Earth spiritual energy. Not only could it not be penetrated, but it was as sharp as ten thousand arrows, directly piercing into his muscles and bones.He was seriously injured before, and now he was hit by such a strong impact. He couldn't stand. Although he held his chest and tried to endure, he couldn't help it. He knelt down on one knee with a pale face. The wound on his back was torn, and bright red blood flowed out.Shi Mei couldn't tell whether it was splashed water or tears on his face. He said miserably, \"Shizun!You \u2014 \u2014 why did you do this \u2026 \"\"What do you mean why did I do this?If the person behind the water curtain was you, or Xue Meng, \"Chu Wanning said sternly,\" I would \u2026 \"He was in so much pain that he frowned and couldn't continue speaking.But at this time, a sword light suddenly came out from behind the water curtain. It tore the powerful barrier in half like cutting tofu.The sword light was unusually fierce, and the location was exactly where Shi Mei was standing. Seeing that it was about to hit him, Chu Wanning suddenly waved his sleeves and used all his spiritual energy to set up a barrier to protect Shi Mei. He used too much spiritual energy and coughed out a mouthful of blood.A high-pitched and clear male voice slowly rang out, reverberating in the Divine Martial Library:\"I am the God of War, Gou Chen Shang Gong. You rascals trespassing into the Shen Wu Forbidden Area, how frivolous!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayXue Meng shouted angrily at the sky, \"Bullsh * t Deity!Are your dog eyes blind?Are we trespassers?We were captured, take a good look! \"Shi Mei said, \"It's useless. This is his voice. He's not here.I think the fake Gouchen confused the Heart-Picking Willow and made him think that we're trespassers with bad intentions. \"That voice continued,\"In this world, those who are worthy of a divine weapon should understand what benevolence is, what tenacity is, what not to fall into illusions, and what not to lose one's mind.Since you're here, I'll test you.If you pass the test, you'll be fine, and the divine weapon will be presented to you. However, if you're selfish and don't have a strong mind, you're not fit to be the master of the divine weapon! \"Chu Wanning's bloody lips opened and closed as he said coldly, \"What benevolence \u2026 Using people as blood drops, is this your so-called benevolence?\"He knew that the Gouchen Shang Gong couldn't hear him, but he was still angry. Even if he breathed heavily with every word, causing his wound to hurt even more, he couldn't control his harsh mouth.That voice continued to reverberate in the divine weapon warehouse, \"To test your mind.You'll fall into the dreamland of the Heart-Picking Willow.If you don't wake up in time, your companions will bleed out and die here. \"The three of them heard that, and the color on their faces faded away.Shi Mei muttered, \"What \u2026\"That meant that the three of them were about to fall into an illusion.If they didn't wake up in time, the three of them would be immersed in the dream forever. Would they let Mo Ran bleed to death in the real world?Xue Meng was speechless for a moment before he shouted angrily, \"What kind of deity are you!?!If immortal cultivation was like you, I wouldn't touch a sword in my life! \"Chu Wanning also said angrily, \"That's ridiculous!\"\"Master!\" Shi Mei hurriedly comforted him, \"Don't be angry. Be careful of your wounds.\"Gouchen Shanggong, on the other hand, actually started reciting a poem at this moment. He slowly recited, \"When the earth is flattened, it flows in all directions.Life is also fated. How can one sigh and sit back to worry and drink wine to ease one's self-loathing? It is difficult to raise a cup to break the song.If one's heart is not made of wood or stone, how can he not feel it? He swallowed his words and hesitated, not daring to speak. \"Xue Meng was about to faint from anger. \"What are you blabbering on about?!\"Shi Mei said, \"Bao Zhao's' Quasi Xing Lu Is Difficult 'means that everyone has their own destiny, how can one complain and feel remorse? Because of the wine, one's singing was interrupted.The human heart is not a stubborn stone, how can it be completely devoid of emotions? Wanting to say something, yet stopping, wanting to say something. \"Gouchen Shanggong let out a long sigh and said, \"In this vast world, how many people are willing to give up their lifelong dreams just to help others?The world was filled with endless killing and wars.If Shenwu falls into the wrong hands, it will be my fault. How can I forgive myself for the sin of creating this weapon \u2026 \"All of a sudden, the Divine Armory dimmed.The fragments that were flying in the air also stopped moving.A layer of faint light slowly lit up on the dome. It was as if the brilliance of the stars was gradually falling down and shining on the ground.A voice murmured in the air, \"Sleep \u2026\"This soft and sparkling radiance seemed to have some kind of hypnotizing effect. Shi Mei and Xue Meng's cultivation base were not high, so they soon fell into unconsciousness.\"Sleep \u2026\"Chu Wanning gritted his teeth and tried to resist. However, the power of an Incipient God was extremely vast. In the end, he couldn't get rid of the drowsiness and fell into a dream.Divine Armory.As the Blood Hourglass, Mo Ran was the only one who was awake. He coughed out blood foam. Through the weakened waterfall, he could vaguely see the three people who had fallen into a dream behind him.Chu Wanning, Shi Mei, and Xue Meng were all asleep.When Mo Ran heard the North Star's words, he knew that only one of them could wake up in time to break the spell and save him.However, as time passed, he became more and more dizzy and his body gradually turned cold.However, no one woke up from the dream.It could be said that this was karma. In his previous life, he treated Chu Wanning like this. In this life, he also felt the feeling of his blood slowly draining away.How laughable.Among them, who would give up the best dream of their life, the thing they wanted the most to come and save him?Xue Meng was definitely out of the question.Chu Wanning \u2026 Forget it, let's not think about him.If there was, that person should be Shi Mei.He thought about it vaguely.However, he had already lost too much blood. His consciousness was about to collapse.Mo Ran lowered his head and looked at his feet. The blood that had leaked to the bottom of the Copper Hourglass was diluted by the water in the Hourglass Urn.He suddenly wanted to know what kind of scene he would see if he were to fall into the North Star's illusory realm.Would he dream of the crystal clear handkerchief, Shi Mei's gentle smile, Chu Wanning's praise, and the begonia in the wind when he first arrived at the peak of life and death?\"Mo Ran \u2026\"Suddenly, he heard someone calling him.Mo Ran still had his head lowered. He felt that he was about to lose his consciousness and was hallucinating.\"Mo Ran.\"\"Mo Ran!\"It was not a hallucination!He suddenly raised his head.However, the scene in front of him caused his pupils to shrink abruptly.He almost screamed, \"Shi Mei!!!\"It was Shi Mei!The person who woke up, the person who gave up on happiness, the person who still remembered him in the midst of all the good things.It was Shi Mei \u2026Mo Ran looked at the delicate young man who walked through the waterfall towards him. Suddenly, he choked up.\"Shi Mei \u2026 you \u2026\"He did not know what to say.Mo Ran closed his eyes and said in a hoarse voice.\"Thank you \u2026 for remembering me even in your sweet dreams \u2026\"Shi Mei waded through the water. His clothes were soaked, and his eyes were dark. He looked as gentle as Mo Ran when they first met. He looked as gentle as he had seen him in his dreams in his previous life. He looked as gentle as he recalled when he was cold all over.Shi Mei said, \"Don't be silly. There's no need to thank me.\"As he walked closer, Mo Ran realized that his feet were bleeding.The ground had become hot. The Gouchen Upper Palace seemed to have decided to test how much a person could do for his companions. Therefore, after the temptation of the sweet dream, it was followed by intense torture.Shi Mei's boots had been burned through. If he did not walk, the ground would remain the same. However, if he insisted on walking, every step he took would ignite a flame under his feet. The temperature was not high, so it would not burn him to the point where he could not move. However, it would make him feel extreme pain.But this gentle person was clearly in so much pain, but after looking at him, her gaze became firmer and firmer, and she walked towards him step by step.\"Mo Ran, bear with it.\"He said.\"I'll save you right away.\"When Mo Ran met his eyes, he knew that he did not need to say 'don't come over'.This person's eyes were too determined and too determined.He had never seen such an expression on Shi Mei's face before.If Mo Ran calmed down, he would definitely feel that something was amiss.Shi Mei always called himself 'Mo Ran'. When did he ever call him 'Mo Ran'?He only knew that Shi Mei was good to him. However, he did not realize that the person standing in front of him was not Shi Mei. Instead, it was \u2014 \u2014It was Chu Wanning.The last skill of the ancient willow was called 'Heart Plucking'.The so-called 'Heart Plucking' was the exchange of a person's soul.When Chu Wanning broke free from the dream and woke up, he realized that he had exchanged hearts with Shi Mei.Under the magic of the Heart Plucking Willow, his consciousness was transferred to Shi Mei's body. It was the same for Shi Mei.However, Shi Mei did not wake up. Therefore, he did not know that he had changed bodies.Chu Wanning did not have time to explain, and Mo Ran, who did not know the truth, really thought that the person in front of him was Shi Mei.He felt that Shi Mei would definitely endure the pain and come over. It was just like how he could not forget Shi Mei's kindness even after experiencing death.People were very stubborn.But it was too cruel.When Chu Wanning finally arrived in front of the copper hourglass and wanted to climb up the towering vine willow to save Mo Ran, the vine willow suddenly gave birth to many burning thorns.Chu Wanning did not expect that. His hand was suddenly burned by the thorns. He tried to grab it, but Shi Mei's body was not strong enough. He suddenly slid down, and the flesh on his hand was instantly melted by the thorns.\"\u2026 \u2026!\"Chu Wanning cursed inwardly and frowned in pain.Shi Ming Jing, this broken shell!Mo Ran shouted, \"Shi Mei!\"Chu Wanning fell to his knees on the ground. His skin that came into contact with the ground was instantly burned by the high temperature. However, he knitted his eyebrows and bit his lips as usual. He did not shout.This kind of expression would appear very stubborn and ruthless on his own face, but on Shi Mei's gentle face, it appeared somewhat delicate and pitiful.People really could not be compared to others.\"Shi Mei \u2026 \u2026\"Mo Ran opened his mouth, but tears flowed down.His heart felt like it was being cut by a knife.In his blurred vision, he saw that person's thin and frail body. Such a weak person, but little by little, he grabbed onto the vine willow and slowly climbed up.The thorns pierced his hand, and the fire burned his bones and blood.A bright red color dyed the ground. Everywhere he passed, there were mottled bloodstains.Mo Ran closed his eyes. His voice was bloodshot. He said with a trembling voice, \"Shi Mei \u2026 \u2026.Shi Mei \u2026 \u2026 \"That person was very close. Mo Ran saw a flash of pain in his eyes. He seemed to be in extreme pain. Even Mo Ran's voice was a kind of torture to him.Therefore, although the person in front of him had a stubborn expression, his gaze could almost be called pleading.\"Don't call me again.\"\"\u2026 \u2026\"\"Mo Ran, wait a little longer. I'll \u2026 \u2026 save \u2026 \u2026 you \u2026 \u2026 now \u2026 \u2026\"Almost at the instant his voice fell, a tenacious light appeared in his eyes. It was like an unsheathed sharp blade. On that gentle face, it was indescribably beautiful.Chu Wanning's robes billowed as he leaped onto the copper hourglass.His face was already like a sheet of gold. He was tottering and on the verge of collapse. Besides still breathing, he was no different from a dead person.At that moment, Mo Ran felt that it would be better for him to bleed out and die than to let him suffer like this.His throat was full of broken words, \"I'm sorry.\"Chu Wanning knew that this apology was not meant for him.He wanted to explain, but he glanced at the silver-blue Gouchen Shanggong sword. It was pierced between Mo Ran's ribs. The spiritual energy of the vine vein might have come from this sword.He was worried that Mo Ran would be shocked and hurt even more. Therefore, in front of \"Shi Mei\", he asked,\"Mo Ran, do you trust me?\"\"I trust you.\" Without hesitation.Chu Wanning raised his eyelids and looked at him. He held the sword hilt. This sword was close to the heart. If something went wrong, Mo Ran would lose his life.\"\u2026 \u2026\" Chu Wanning's hand was trembling. He held the sword but did not move.Mo Ran's eyes were still red, but he suddenly smiled, \"Shi Mei.\"\"\u2026 \u2026 Yes.\"Mo Ran said, \"\u2026 \u2026 Am I going to die?\"\"\u2026 \u2026 No.\"\"If I'm going to die, can \u2026 can you let me hug you?\"When he said this, he was very careful. His eyes were shining with moist light.Chu Wanning's heart softened.However, when he thought about how Mo Ran was looking at another person, this softness immediately froze.He suddenly felt like he was an insignificant clown on the stage. He was hidden behind the beautiful young man in green. No one noticed him.In this touching song, he was superfluous.Or perhaps its only use was to wear that ugly face and grin drawn with ink to set off other people's happiness, anger, sorrow, love, hate, and sorrow.How ridiculous.Mo Ran did not know this. He saw the flicker in Chu Wanning's eyes and thought that Shi Mei was unwilling. He immediately said, \"Just a hug.Just a hug. \"An almost undetectable sigh.\"Actually, I \u2026 \u2026\"Mo Ran, \"What?\"\"\u2026 \u2026 Forget it.\" Chu Wanning said, \"It's nothing.\"He leaned over. He was not very close, afraid that he would touch the sword. Then he reached out and gently held Mo Ran's shoulder.He heard Mo Ran say in his ear, \"Shi Mei, thank you for waking up. Thank you for remembering me in your good dreams.\"Chu Wanning lowered his eyes. His eyelashes fluttered like butterflies. Then he smiled faintly, \"You're welcome.\"After a pause, he said, \"Mo Ran.\"\"Yes?\"Chu Wanning still felt like he was in a dream. He hugged him, stroked his hair, and sighed softly, \"Do you know that if a dream is too good, it is often not real?\"After he finished speaking, his hug was like a dragonfly skimming the surface of the water. He left in an instant.Mo Ran looked up. He did not understand Shi Mei's meaning. He only knew that this small hug was the candy that Shi Mei gave him out of kindness.It was sweet and sour. When it rubbed against his tongue, there was a hint of bitterness.The moment the sword was pulled out, blood splattered like begonias that were blown away by a strong wind.Mo Ran felt a sharp pain in his heart. For a moment, he thought that he was going to die. His heart was filled with unwillingness. He suddenly blurted out, \"Shi Mei, I've always liked you very much.What about you \u2026 \u2026 \"As the sword fell to the ground, the vines and willows scattered in an instant. The torrential waterfall from the sky stopped abruptly. The Divine Armory suddenly returned to silence.I've always liked you very much.What about you \u2026 \u2026His body had reached its limit. Mo Ran felt his vision suddenly turn black.The moment he fell, he was caught by a pair of hands stained with blood. He fell into Shi Mei's arms.Mo Ran did not know if it was an illusion, but he saw Shi Mei frown. He slowly closed his eyes. There seemed to be tears falling from his eyes.He seemed to hear Shi Mei say softly, \"Me too.\"Mo Ran, \"!\"It must be an illusion. Otherwise, why would Shi Mei still promise him when he looked so sad?\"I also \u2026 \u2026 like you.\"His consciousness finally dissipated. Mo Ran fell into a coma.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen he woke up, Mo Ran realized that he was still in the Divine Martial Library.He seemed to have slept for a long time, but when he opened his eyes, he realized that not much time had passed. It felt like only a blink of an eye.He did not know if it was because the spell was successfully broken, but when he woke up, he realized that he was lying on the ground. However, he was completely unharmed.Those hideous wounds and dripping blood seemed like a nightmare that did not leave a mark on his body.Mo Ran was surprised and delighted. He looked at Shi Mei and realized that he had fainted as well. However, he was also unharmed.Could it be that after passing the Gou Chen Upper Palace's trial, the Gou Chen Upper Palace not only removed the illusion, but also restored their injuries?\u2026When he thought about it carefully, the Gou Chen Upper Palace did not want to harm anyone. Instead, it was in line with the original intention of the trial. However, Mo Ran felt that it was unreal. He even felt that he had survived a disaster.Among the four of them, he was the first to wake up.Then, it was Shi Mei. When he saw Shi Mei slowly opening his eyes, Mo Ran was overjoyed. He quickly said, \"Shi Mei!We're fine!We're fine!Look at me! \"At first, Shi Mei was in a daze. Then, he gradually regained his senses. He suddenly opened his eyes wide. \"Mo Ran?!You \u2014 \"Before he could finish, Mo Ran hugged him tightly.Shi Mei was stunned. However, he still patted his shoulder gently. \"What happened to you \u2026\"\"I'm sorry that I made you suffer so much.\"Shi Mei said blankly, \"Actually, it's nothing. I just had a dream.\"Mo Ran said, \"But it's still really painful!\"Shi Mei asked, \"\u2026 What do you mean it really hurt?\"At this moment, Xue Meng woke up. He seemed to have dreamt of something and shouted, \"How dare you!How dare you molest me! \"He sat up abruptly.Shi Mei saw that he was awake and went over. \"Young Master.\"\"Ah \u2026 Why are you here?Why are you here? \"Xue Meng thought he was still in a dream.Mo Ran was in a good mood. His expression towards Xue Meng was also very gentle. He smiled and told him what had happened. Only then did Xue Meng come back to his senses.\"So it was a dream \u2026 I thought \u2026\"In order to cover up his embarrassment, Xue Meng lightly coughed. He suddenly discovered that Chu Wanning, who had always been the strongest, was actually still asleep. He couldn't help but be shocked.\"Why isn't Master awake yet?\"They walked over and examined Chu Wanning's wound.As Chu Wanning was injured before the illusion was activated, according to the design of the Gouchen Upper Palace, only the injuries sustained in the illusion could be healed. Therefore, Chu Wanning's shoulder was still soaked with a large amount of blood. It was a ghastly sight.Mo Ran sighed and said, \"Let's wait and see.\"After about the time it took to burn a stick of incense, Chu Wanning finally woke up.He slowly opened his eyes. When he woke up, his gaze was cold, as if he had just experienced a snowstorm.After a long time, he moved his eyes and looked at Mo Ran.However, he seemed to be like Xue Meng. He was still not fully awake. He looked at Mo Ran and slowly reached out his hand. He said hoarsely, \"You \u2026\"Mo Ran said, \"Master.\"Hearing him call out to him, Chu Wanning's hand froze in mid-air. His pale face seemed to have a trace of color. His eyes suddenly brightened. \"Yes \u2026\"\"Master!!\"Xue Meng rushed over and pushed Mo Ran aside. He held Chu Wanning's hand. \"How are you?Are you feeling better?Master, you didn't wake up for so long. I was worried to death. \"When Chu Wanning saw Xue Meng, he was slightly stunned. Then, the mist in his eyes gradually dispersed.When he looked carefully at Mo Ran, he saw that although the other was looking at him, he was tightly holding Shi Mei's hand. He didn't let go for even a moment.\"\u2026 \u2026\"Chu Wanning was completely awake. His face became cold.Then, like a fish in a dry pond, he finally died.Shi Mei said with concern, \"Master, are you okay?Does your shoulder hurt? \"Chu Wanning said calmly, \"I'm fine. It doesn't hurt.\"With Xue Meng's help, he slowly stood up.Mo Ran was puzzled. Chu Wanning's shoulder was injured. Why did his steps seem weak when he stood up, as if his foot was injured?Mo Ran thought that Chu Wanning didn't know what happened in the illusion just now, so he briefly repeated it.Shi Mei felt that something was wrong when he heard it just now. Now that he heard it again, he felt even more strange. He couldn't help but ask, \"Mo Ran, you said that I saved you?\"\"That's right.\"Shi Mei was silent for a while, then said slowly, \"But I \u2026 just now, I was dreaming and didn't wake up.\"Mo Ran was shocked, but then laughed, \"Don't joke around.\"Shi Mei said, \"I'm not joking. I dreamt \u2026 I dreamt of my parents. They're still alive.That dream was too real. I felt like \u2026 like I couldn't bear to leave them behind. I really \u2014 \"Before he could finish speaking, he heard Chu Wanning say indifferently, \"There's nothing strange about that.It's probably the North Star's illusion that erased the memory of when you saved him.In any case, Xue Meng and I didn't save him. Since he said that you saved him, then you saved him. \"Shi Mei, \"\u2026\"\"What else? Does the North Star have a way to swap people's hearts?\" Chu Wanning said coldly.He wasn't willing to do all the work for others. He originally wanted to tell Mo Ran the truth, and hoped that Mo Ran would realize that the person in the illusion wasn't Shi Mei, but himself who had swapped hearts with Shi Mei.However, Mo Ran's confession to Shi Mei in the end was too embarrassing for Chu Wanning.When he woke up, he looked into Mo Ran's shining black eyes.For a moment, Chu Wanning felt that perhaps Mo Ran also cared about him a little.This kind of humble expectation was a weak thought that he only dared to secretly explore after such a long time.However, that was just his wishful thinking.Mo Ran wouldn't know about the blood he shed and the injuries he suffered, and there was no need for him to know.He wasn't stupid. Although he didn't say it, he could already feel how much Mo Ran cherished that gentle and beautiful person.How could he see himself standing in a corner like a puppet that had accumulated dust?However, when he heard Mo Ran say \"I've always loved you\", Chu Wanning felt that he had lost miserably and utterly.In Mo Ran's opinion, the hug in the illusion was given to him by Shi Mei out of charity.However, Mo Ran would never know that the hug was actually given to another pitiful person by himself.Chu Wanning never thought that Mo Ran would love him, so he tried very hard to suppress this feeling. He didn't force it, disturb it, or touch it lightly.Those reckless feelings of love and passionate entanglement only grew on the soil of youth.When he was young, he also hoped that someone could accompany him and drink under the moon. However, he kept waiting, but that person never came.Later on, day after day, his reputation and status in the cultivation world became higher and higher. Everyone looked up to him and said that he was unreasonable.Later on, he also accepted this kind of high and unreasonable attitude.He was like hiding in a cocoon, and time spun silk on his cocoon.At first, he could still see some light seeping in through the cocoon, but year after year, the silk grew and the cocoon became thicker. He could no longer see the light.There was only himself and darkness in the cocoon.He didn't believe in love, didn't believe that the heavens could see the curtains, and didn't want to pursue anything.If he went through a lot of hardships, biting open the cocoon with bruises all over his body, and stumbling out, but there was no one waiting for him outside, what should he do?Although he liked Mo Ran, this person was too young, too distant, and too passionate. Chu Wanning didn't want to get close, afraid that one day he would be burned to ashes by this kind of fire.Therefore, he retreated from all the paths of retreat that he could take.He didn't know what he did wrong.As a result, he only had a little bit of wishful thinking left, but it was drowned by the cold rain that covered the sky.\"Shizun, look over there!\"Xue Meng's shout brought Chu Wanning back to reality. He looked in the direction of the voice and saw that the Sword-Forging Pool was once again boiling with lava. Surrounded by flames, the Ancient Wood Tree Spirit broke out of the water once again.However, the Tree Spirit's eyes were white. It was obviously in a state of insanity.It held the Gouchen Upper Palace's shining silver sword with both hands.Chu Wanning said, \"Run!Quickly! \"He didn't need to repeat himself. His disciples immediately ran towards the exit.The controlled Tree Spirit howled at the sky, and the chains on its body shook with clanking sounds.No one said anything, but the four of them heard a voice at the same time.\"Stop them. Don't let any of them escape.\"Xue Meng turned pale. \"Someone's talking in my ear!\"Chu Wanning said, \"Ignore him. It's the Heart-Picking Willow's Mantra of Confusion!Just run! \"When he said this, the others remembered that the Heart-Picking Willow had reminded them when he was awake. The Mantra of Confusion was to use the greed in a person's heart as a lure to make them kill each other.As expected, the voice in Chu Wanning's ear hissed, \"Chu Wanning, don't you feel tired?\"\"Wanye Yuheng, the grandmaster of a generation.Such a person could only secretly fall in love with his own disciple.You've done so much for him, but he doesn't know what's good for him. He never had you in his eyes. He only likes that gentle and cute little senior brother.How pitiful are you? \"Chu Wanning's face was ashen. He ignored the noise in his ear and rushed toward the exit.\"Come to my side. Pick up this ancestral sword and kill Shi Mei. Then, there will be no one between you two.Come to my side. I can help you get what you want and make the person you love fall in love with you.Come to my side \u2026 \u2026 \"Chu Wanning said angrily, \"You little rascal, why don't you get lost!\"The others also heard the different conditions proposed by the voice. Although they slowed down, they could still resist the temptation.As they got closer and closer to the exit, the Heart-Picking Willow seemed to become more and more crazy.\"Think carefully!Once you get out of this door, you won't have another chance! \"The sound in everyone's ears was different. It was a mournful shriek.\"Chu Wanning, Chu Wanning, do you really want to be alone for the rest of your life?\"\"Mo Weiyu, I'm the only one in this world who knows where the Medicine of Resurrection is. Come to my side. Let me tell you \u2014 \u2014\"\"Shi Mingjing, I know the desire in your heart. I'm the only one who can help you!\"\"Xue Ziming, the Divine Weapon you picked is a fake!Jin Chengchi is left with the last weapon made by Gouchen Upper Palace. Come back and this ancestral sword will belong to you!Don't you want a peerless Divine Weapon?Don't you want to be the chosen one?Without the Divine Weapon, you will never be better than others!Come to my side \u2026 \u2026 \"\"Xue Meng!\" Mo Ran suddenly realized that his cousin had disappeared.He turned around and saw that Xue Meng's footsteps were slowing down. Finally, he stopped and turned around to look at the floating silver-blue sword in the Sword Forging Pool.Mo Ran's heart trembled.He knew how deep Xue Meng's obsession with the Divine Weapon was.This brat must be very disappointed when he found out that the weapon he got was a fake.It was perfect that the Heart-Picking Willow used the ancestral sword to tempt him.\"Xue Meng, don't believe him. Don't go over!\"Shi Mei also said, \"Young Master, let's go. We're almost at the exit!\"Xue Meng turned around and looked at them blankly. The voice in his ears became more and more enchanting, \"They're jealous of you and don't want you to get the Divine Weapon.Think about Mo Weiyu, he has already obtained his weapon, so he can't wait for you to get nothing.Both of you are brothers. If you're not as good as him, the position of Supremacy at the peak of life and death will naturally be his. \"Xue Meng muttered, \"Shut up.\"Mo Ran seemed to be anxiously shouting something at him, but he could not hear him clearly. He could only hold his head and repeat, \"Shut up!Shut up! \"\"Xue Ziming, there is no weapon in the Divine Martial Warehouse that is suitable for you. If you miss the Ancestral Sword, you can only submit to Mo Weiyu in the future. At that time, he will be your Reverend, and you will have to kneel in front of him and listen to his orders!Think about it. Killing him is not a problem at all!Since ancient times, there have been many conflicts between brothers. Furthermore, he is only your cousin!What are you hesitating for!Come \u2014 \u2014 let me give you the sword \u2026 \u2026 \"\"Xue Meng!\"\"Young Master!!\"Xue Meng suddenly stopped struggling. He suddenly opened his eyes, which were actually red.\"Come to me \u2026 \u2026 you are the chosen one \u2026 \u2026 you deserve to be the Supremacy \u2026 \u2026\"Chu Wanning said sternly, \"Xue Meng!\"\"Come \u2026 \u2026 only when you become the Supremacy at the peak of life and death can the cultivation world be peaceful \u2026 \u2026 think about those who are suffering, think about the unfair treatment you have suffered \u2026 \u2026 Xue Ziming, let me help you \u2026 \u2026\"Unknowingly, Xue Meng had already arrived at the boiling Sword Forging Pool. The spirit of the heart-picking willow was holding the ancestral sword of the Gouchen Upper Palace. Its eyes were completely bloodshot.\"Very good. Take this sword and stop them all!\"Xue Meng slowly raised his hand and trembled as he took the silver-blue treasure sword.\"Kill them all.\"\"Kill Mo Weiyu.\"\"Go \u2026 \u2026 ahhhhh!!!!\"Suddenly, Xue Meng pulled out his longsword and drew a dazzling sword flower in his hand. Then, he stabbed with his backhand. The spiritual light of the Ancestral Sword flowed, illuminating the handsomeness of the proud son of heaven. Under the light of the sword, there was no blood in his eyes. Instead, they were brighter and purer than usual.The sword did not stab towards Mo Ran. Instead, it went straight for the heart-picking willow's body and pierced through its stomach!In an instant, the earth trembled and the willow swayed.The Mantra of Confusion was broken. The Divine Martial Library was in chaos.Xue Meng panted heavily. He used all his strength to break free from the bewitchment.He stared at the heart-picking willow. His young face was filled with the persistence and purity of a youth.The arrogance and naivety in his burning eyes could be easily seen.The so-called phoenix's fledgling was not just a martial arts attainment.\"Don't you think you can bewitch me. Don't you think you can harm others.\"Xue Meng panted as he finished speaking. Then, he suddenly pulled out his sword!The heart-picking willow instantly burst out a burst of smelly blood. As he was dying, his consciousness returned to his body. The evil aura on his body suddenly disappeared.He clutched his chest and barely stabilized his body. He raised his face and opened his mouth. Although there was no sound, the shape of his mouth could be heard clearly.\"Thank \u2026 \u2026 you \u2026 \u2026 for \u2026 \u2026 stopping \u2026 \u2026 me \u2026 \u2026\"The heart-picking willow's body was an ancient spirit. Its power was on par with the Ancestor Sword. After the collision, both sides were injured.The Ancestor Sword in Xue Meng's hand suddenly lost its spiritual light. In an instant, it became dull and colorless.At the same time, the Ten Thousand Years Old Tree Spirit suddenly dispersed.In an instant, tens of thousands of flowing lights scattered into the waves. Like fireflies, they circled and danced around the crowd. The brilliance flowed and the golden light was dazzling. In the end, they faded away one by one and disappeared.Shi Mei said, \"Young Master, come here quickly. This place is going to collapse!\"The earth trembled. They could not stay for long.Xue Meng turned around and took one last look at the Divine Martial Library. With a \"clang\", he threw away the broken Ancestor Sword and left.Behind him, the bricks and tiles collapsed like snow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After running into the passageway outside the Shen Wu Warehouse, Chu Wanning ordered them to rest for a while.For a moment, no one spoke first. Everyone was either standing or sitting, checking the wounds on themselves or others, and recovering their strength.Only Xue Meng was in a daze. His head drooped, and no one knew what he was thinking.Mo Ran murmured, \"Xue Meng \u2026\"Xue Meng didn't pay attention to anyone. He walked stiffly to Chu Wanning, raised his head, and opened his mouth. His voice was broken.\"Master.\"Chu Wanning looked at him. He wanted to raise his hand and touch his messy hair, but in the end, he restrained himself.\"Was the Shen Wu that I picked a fake?\"Chu Wanning didn't speak.The rims of Xue Meng's eyes turned even redder. His distinctly defined eyes were bloodshot like a spider web. If it wasn't for his stubbornness and conceit, he would have cried on the spot.\"Will I never be able to get the weapons in the pool again?\"Chu Wan Ning finally closed her eyes and let out a sigh.The passageway was very quiet. Only Chu Wanning's clear and cold voice could be heard.\"\u2026 Silly child.\"A silly child full of sigh and helplessness made Xue Meng's last bit of reason collapse. He couldn't bear it anymore. He threw himself into Chu Wanning's arms, hugged Chu Wanning's waist, and cried bitterly.\"Master \u2026 Master \u2026\"Missing the Jin Chengchi Divine Martial was almost equivalent to missing the qualification to enter the peak of the cultivation world.This was something that everyone knew. The magic power of mortals was limited. Without the help of a Divine Weapon, no matter how strong they were, they were just flesh and blood.The young masters of the sects in the upper cultivation world more or less left behind the Divine Martial passed down by their ancestors. Even if it wasn't completely compatible with their own spiritual power, it was still a powerful force that couldn't be underestimated.Only Xue Meng, because Xue Zhengyong and Xue Zhengyong started from scratch, did not receive any of Jin Chengchi's weapons.Therefore, when he chose to use the Ancestral Sword to perish together with Heart-Picking Willow, it was equivalent to him choosing to let go of his past pride and arrogance.Chu Wanning didn't ask anything and didn't say anything. He just hugged Xue Meng who was crying loudly in his arms and stroked his hair.Xue Meng had been spoiled since he was young, and had never suffered any grievances. Therefore, he had never cried since he could remember. He was always showing off his prowess and was insufferably arrogant.However, at this very moment, tears intertwined on his young face. Every word and sentence was shattered. It was as if he was destined to no longer possess a divine weapon. It was as if the dream of becoming a hero that he once thought was within reach was completely shattered.\"Xue Meng.\" Chu Wanning hugged his disciple and comforted him.The ripples at the bottom of the lake rustled Chu Wanning's white cloak and long black hair. In that instant, Mo Ran only had time to clearly see his soft eyelashes drooping down, and below them were fragments of soft light.Afterwards, the ripples grew larger, messing up his clothes and hair. In the dusky darkness, it was no longer possible to clearly see the side of Chu Wanning's face.He only heard him say, \"Don't cry. You're already very good.\"His voice couldn't be considered gentle, but coming from Chu Wanning's mouth, it couldn't be any gentler.In the secret passage, the four people each had their own thoughts. No one said anything.Mo Ran leaned against the cold wall. He watched as Chu Wanning hugged Xue Meng and patted his shoulder. He suddenly felt uncomfortable in his heart.The trip to Jin Chengchi.When he came, he was dressed in fine clothes and rode a fine horse.When he left, he was injured.Xue Meng had been a God's favored child for fifteen years.He was full of glory and high spirits.Then one day, the Vermillion Tower collapsed.From then on, he had to use his long life to forget the sharpness of these fifteen years.When they ran out of the Divine Armory, everyone saw the Heart-Picking Willow slowly collapsing in the water. It was like the death of Kuafu, the death of the Golden Crow.The Flood Dragon Humans who stayed on the ground were shocked and fled in all directions.The Divine Armory from millions of years ago was destroyed overnight.The Divine Tree fell with a loud crash, setting off a frenzy in Jin Chengchi. In front of the huge whirlpool, the Flood Dragon Humans all transformed back to their original forms in order to resist the terrifying waves.For a moment, the scales in Jin Chengchi churned, and the fish and dragons jumped around. Mortals couldn't stand still anymore.Mo Ran shouted, \"No, we can't get out!\"As he spoke, a thick Flood Dragon's tail slapped over. Mo Ran quickly dodged and narrowly avoided it.Right at this moment, a black dragon suddenly swept over. Its body was bigger than the rest of the Flood Dragons. Its pitch-black scales overflowed with cold golden light.Mo Ran was shocked, \"Wangyue?!!\"Wangyue let out a long roar. He was originally a mute dragon, but now he could speak. His voice was loud like a bell as he shouted, \"Hold onto my back. The Heart-Picking Willow is destroyed, Jin Chengchi is about to be destroyed. Quickly!I'll bring you out of here! \"At this moment, they had no other choice. They couldn't care whether Wangyue was a friend or foe, so they did as they were told.Wangyue carried the four of them and swam through the stormy waves. They split the water and ran.\"Hold on tight!\"Just as he finished speaking, the old dragon suddenly broke through the waves and soared into the sky.Mo Ran and the rest only felt a strong current rushing towards them. The current was like thousands of horses and armies galloping, trampling on their bones and lungs.They couldn't even open their eyes or breathe. Their hands tightly held onto the dragon's back and used all their strength to prevent themselves from being thrown back into the lake.When they could finally open their eyes, they had already ridden the dragon into the clouds. They were above Jin Chengchi, at the peak of Xuying Peak.The gushing water vapor turned into thousands of fluorescent lights, scattering from the mirror-like giant dragon scales. In an instant, the clouds were like mist, and the thin fog was like a rainbow.Wangyue made the Bureau Chief gasp, and the color of the surroundings changed.Mo Ran heard Xue Meng's voice coming from behind. It sounded excited and distant in the whistling wind. After all, he was really young and easily forgot his worries because of some things.\"Oh my god!I'm flying!Flying on the dragon! \"Wangyue circled a few times above Xuying Peak, gradually shrinking his body and slowly lowering his body to land. When he stopped by Jin Chengchi, he had shrunk to less than half of his original size, so he didn't crush too many rocks and trees around him.He curled up in the same place, quietly letting Mo Ran and the rest get off the dragon's back.They turned back to look at Jin Chengchi, only to see the ice melting and the waves breaking the ice.At this time, the sun was bright, and the east was white. The sun shone brightly and flowed into Jin Chengchi, making the lake ripple.Shi Mei suddenly exclaimed, \"Look at those dragons in the lake!\"Those writhing dragons rose and fell with the turbulent waves and gradually stopped moving. Then, one by one, they crumbled and turned into ashes. One by one, black chess pieces rose from the lake and gathered in mid-air.Mo Ran muttered, \"The Exquisite Chess Game \u2026\"The flood dragons, living creatures, and even the Heart-Picking Willows in the pool were all under the effects of the exquisite chess game. The entire pool of conspiracies was actually a game set up by someone hiding in the dark!Mo Ran suddenly felt a chill run down his spine.He realized that the world after his rebirth was not right. Some things happened in advance for no reason.In his previous life, when he was sixteen years old, there was no one who could play the Exquisite Chess Game to such an extent. What was the background of this fake Gouchen?Xue Meng said, \"Wangyue!\"Mo Ran turned back and saw Wangyue lying on the ground without moving. There were no black chess pieces on his body, but he looked very weak with his eyes half-closed.\"You guys \u2026 did well \u2026 I'd rather destroy Gouchen God's Jin Chengchi than let \u2026 let it fall into the hands of evil \u2026\"After he said this, his body suddenly emitted a golden light. When the light dispersed, he turned into a human with a smaller body.\"It's you?!\"Mo Ran and Xue Meng spoke at the same time.Wangyue in front of them was the white-haired old dragon person who led them to the spiritual body of the Divine Martial Library.Wangyue raised his head, and there was a tinge of guilt in his eyes.\"That's me.\"Xue Meng was shocked, \"You, why did you lead us to the Divine Martial Library?Did you want to save us or harm us?If you wanted to harm us, why did you send us ashore? If you wanted to save us, what if we couldn't solve the Heart-Picking Willow's calamity? Wouldn't that be \u2026 \"Wangyue looked down and said with a hoarse voice, \"I'm sorry.However, I had no choice but to do so under the circumstances.The fake Gouchen's cultivation base was insufficient, so he relied on the Heart-Picking Willow's spiritual energy to perform the forbidden technique.Only by solving the Heart-Picking Willow would his technique lose its effect.I had no other choice but to lead you guys to try. \"Chu Wanning shook his head, walked over, and waved his hand to heal him.Wangyue sighed, \"There's no need for you to be so kind.I'm the same as the creatures in the lake. My lifespan is up, and I've been relying on the Heart-Picking Willow's spiritual energy to survive.Since it's fallen, I don't have long to live either. \"Chu Wanning, \"\u2026\"Wangyue said, \"Life and death are orderly, and can't be forced.To be able to see the Jin Chengchi's nightmare end before I die, my wish has been fulfilled.It's just that I'm really sorry for implicating you guys in the lake. \"Chu Wanning said, \"It's fine.\u2026 Do you know who the fake Gouchen is, and what his intentions are? \"Wangyue said, \"I don't know who he is.However, his goal should be to obtain the power of the Heart-Picking Willow to study the three great forbidden techniques. \"Chu Wanning said, \"The spiritual energy required to perform the forbidden techniques is very shocking. If you have the help of the ancient tree spirit, you'll be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort.\"\"Yes, that's what that person said too.He said that the ancient spirit body is very powerful, but it's very difficult to find.The only thing that can be found in the ancient records is the Heart-Picking Willow. \"\"Actually, he only appeared not long ago.Ever since he took control of the Jin Chengchi, he has been using the Heart-Picking Willow's power to practice the two forbidden techniques, 'Rebirth' and 'Exquisite Chess Game'. \"As Wangyue said this, he sighed, and his eyes were a little empty.Mo Ran's heart skipped a beat.As expected \u2026 the trip to the Jin Chengchi was very different from his previous life. All these changes happened not long ago.What had gone wrong that caused everything to change its course?\"He didn't have enough power to control living things, so he killed a large number of living things in the lake and tried to control dead things.This time, he succeeded. Hence, in just a few weeks, he killed almost all the spirit beasts in the lake and turned them into chess pieces.He only left a few to experiment with.I was one of them. \"Mo Ran asked, \"So when I asked for the sword, you floated to the surface. At that time, you were controlled by the fake Gouchen?\"\"No.\"Wangyue slowly closed his eyes. \"He can control others, the fox demon, and the Heart-Picking Willow, but he can't control me.I'm a spirit beast tamed by the Gouchen God when he created the world. A million years ago, when I was willing to follow his orders, his curse was branded on my reverse scale. From then on, I'll be loyal to my master. \"\"Then you \u2026\"\"I had no choice. It was a disguise.\"Wangyue sighed and said, \"Although that intruder couldn't control me completely, the Gouchen God's curse was millions of years old. It's not as effective as it was back then.A part of my body was still affected by the fake Gouchen. When you saw me, I was mute because my voice was completely controlled by that person. I couldn't listen to my own orders anymore.Only when his magic lost its effect, I could speak again. \"Mo Ran asked, \"Does that fake Gouchen know that you're in disguise?\"\"I don't think he knows.\"Wangyue looked at Mo Ran and said, \"According to his plan, he would take your spirit core today and continue the life of the Heart-Picking Willow.However, he didn't expect that I would bring you back to the Divine Martial Library and destroy the willow.He didn't take precautions against me. \"Chu Wanning suddenly said, \"It's not that he didn't take precautions against you. Maybe he didn't have the strength to do it.\"\"What do you mean by that?\"Chu Wanning said, \"I vaguely feel that there's something wrong with that fake Gouchen Shanggong.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMo Ran couldn't help but agree with him.His master was right.Mo Ran initially thought that he was hallucinating when he sensed a weak aura from the fake Gouchen. However, since Chu Wanning also sensed it, the possibility of it being a hallucination was very slim.It was the aura of a corpse.Not only was this fake Gouchen Shanggong not the real person, he wasn't even a living person!In other words, the mastermind only took a corpse and used it as a puppet to disguise himself as the God of Weapons.He didn't even show himself.While he was thinking, a low chuckle suddenly came from Jin Chengchi's direction.Immediately after that, a pale body soared out of the water like an arrow. The fake Gouchen Shanggong leaped into the air, but his appearance and behavior were extremely terrifying. His skin was all wrinkled together like a snake shedding its skin or a silkworm breaking out of its cocoon.\"Wanye Yuheng, Venerable Northern Dipper.Grandmaster Chu, you really live up to your name. \"The fake Gouchen hovered above the sparkling lake. His peeling face seemed to have twisted into an almost twisted smile.\"For someone like you, how come the Confucian Wind Sect didn't manage to keep you here?\"Chu Wanning said coldly, \"Who are you?\"\"You don't need to know who I am,\" the fake Gouchen said. \"I won't let you know who I am.Just treat me as someone who should have died long ago. I crawled out of hell and am here to take revenge on you gentlemen! \"Wangyue said coldly, \"Shameless!The Heart-Plucking Willow has been destroyed. With your spiritual power, you can't use the forbidden technique without the power of the divine tree. You can't do anything evil! \"The fake Gouchen sneered. \"You old loach, you're about to die, but you still want to ruin my plans.You don't have the right to speak here.Get lost! \"Chu Wanning suddenly said, \"Do you have the right to speak just because you have a white piece?\"The so-called \"white piece\", as the name suggested, referred to the most unique piece in the exquisite chess game.When the caster found a newly dead body and poured a part of their soul into the body, that part of the soul would fuse with the body, forming a \"white chess piece\" that was as white as jade.\"White Chess\" was different from the \"Black Chess\" who only followed orders. In other words, the White Chess was actually a substitute for the caster. Other than not having as much mana as the caster, they could think and act on their own. What they saw and heard could also be empathized with the caster.After the identity of the fake North Pole Chen was exposed, he clapped his hands and laughed, \"Good, good!Good!! \"After the three 'good's, the fake Gouchen's face became more and more distorted. It seemed that the magic of the real Gouchen was about to run out, and it could no longer maintain the movement of the white chess piece. Gradually, the original form of the corpse was revealed.\"Chu Wanning, don't be so full of yourself.Do you think you can stop me today?Even if the Heart Plucking Willow was destroyed, my main body could still find another source of spiritual energy.You, on the other hand. \"As he spoke, his gradually cloudy eyes suddenly swept past Chu Wanning with ill intentions and landed on Mo Ran.He was suddenly shocked!The fake North Pole Chen said mockingly, \"If you think I'm the only one in this world who knows the Three Great Forbidden Techniques, then I'm afraid you won't be able to live for long.\"Chu Wanning frowned and said sternly, \"What do you mean by that?\"However, the fake North Pole Chen suddenly stopped talking. After a moment of silence, his body suddenly exploded, scattering into smelly fragments. A white chess piece that was as white as jade burst out from his body and spun a few times against the light before falling into the fine waves of the Jincheng Pool.It seemed that the main body of the fake North Pole Chen had finally run out of spiritual energy after losing the support of the Heart Plucking Willow.At the same time, Wangyue, who was also relying on the spiritual energy of the Heart Plucking Willow to survive, staggered two steps and fell to the ground with a thump. She said softly, \"Ah \u2026\"Xue Meng said in shock, \"Wangyue!\"Mo Ran also said, \"Wangyue!\"The four of them came to Lao Jiao's side. Wangyue was already at the end of his life, and his lips were pale.He looked at them, and his throat was as hoarse as a crow's.\"All of you \u2026 Don't \u2026 Don't believe that person's nonsense.The things he said were all lies, far more lies than the truth \u2026 \"Shi Mei's brows were filled with concern and sorrow. He said gently, \"Senior, don't talk anymore. Let me heal you.\"\"No, no need.Even your master couldn't do it \u2026 You \u2026 You \u2026 \"Wangyue coughed violently a few times, then gasped for breath and said,\" All these years, many people have come to the Jincheng Pool to ask for swords.However \u2026 Since Xie entered the pool, the Heart Plucking Willow was unwilling to let the divine item left behind by its master be used by him, so it destroyed tens of thousands of weapons.The only thing left \u2026 is \u2026 is a willow vine that's on par with it, a \u2026 a High God's sword \u2026 \"When this was mentioned, Xue Meng's expression became even more gloomy. He pursed his lips and remained silent.\"The willow vine \u2026 The willow vine belongs to this little Daoist,\" Wangyue looked at Mo Ran, \"When we were by the lake, I told you that I couldn't stop you from doing evil in the past.I only hope that you will be kind in the future \u2026 But actually \u2026 Actually, according to the master's wishes, the Divine Martial Sword should only be given to a kind-hearted person.So, I hope that you can \u2026 You can \u2026 \"Mo Ran saw that he was already struggling to speak, so he stopped him and said, \"Senior, don't worry, I understand.\"Flood Dragon Person muttered, \"That's good \u2026 That's good \u2026 Then I \u2026 I'm relieved \u2026\"He looked up at the sky, and his lips trembled slightly.\"People say that when the Jincheng Pool asks for swords, the underwater demons will \u2026 will make some requests.Those requests in the past, most of them \u2026 were to test the character of the person who came, but there are exceptions \u2026 \"Wangyue's voice gradually weakened, and there seemed to be thousands of years in his eyes, passing through the water and withering away.\"I followed the master's promise, and after he left, I guarded the Jincheng Lake and couldn't leave \u2026 But I didn't expect that I would guard it for millions of years \u2026 The scenery I saw when I was young \u2026 For the rest of my life \u2026 I actually \u2026 actually never saw \u2026 with my own eyes \u2026\"He slowly turned his head and looked at Mo Ran with pleading eyes. There was a warm and moist luster in his old eyes.At that moment, Mo Ran suddenly knew what he was going to say.As expected, Wangyue said softly, \"Little Daoist, the plum blossoms on the mountainside are always bright. When I was young, I liked them very much. Since you have the Divine Martial Sword, are you willing \u2026 Are you willing \u2026\"Mo Ran was just about to say, \"Okay, I'll go get it for you.\"But before he could even say 'good', the light in the Moongazer Serpent's golden brown eyes suddenly extinguished.Jiangnan has nothing, but it's a gift of spring.The snow mountain in the distance was majestic, and the surface of the lake was dazzling with golden light. The red light of the rising sun spread into the lake, and in the surging waves, it shattered into bits of bright red.Wangyue returned to silence.He was once one of the first giant dragons during the creation of the world. He was once world-shaking and could summon the wind and rain. He was also once subservient and traveled with his master.Everyone said that he had a curse on him, and he couldn't betray his master.But they didn't know that he respected the North Star and kept his promise for thousands of years.In the vast world, there were only a few living beings who remembered the creation of the world.Wangyue knew that although the real North Star's Upper Palace was a mixed-blood of the devil race, his mother was forced by the Demon Lord.The North Star hated the devil race, so he became Fuxi's subordinate. He also used his domineering devil blood to forge the first sharp sword in the world for Fuxi.He helped Fuxi eliminate the devil race and swept the nine continents.However, after the world was unified, Fuxi had doubts about the North Star's Upper Palace because of his half devil blood.The North Star's Upper Palace wasn't stupid. A hundred years later, he voluntarily left the God Realm and came to the mortal world.Along the way, he saw the suffering of living beings and the killing of weapons. He felt that he shouldn't have created the \"sword\" and regretted a lot.Therefore, he collected the weapons that he left behind in the mortal world and sealed them in the Jin Cheng Lake's armory. He planted the Heart-Picking Willow and told the living beings in the lake that those who sought the sword must have a kind heart to be worthy of possessing the Divine Martial Skill.But now, the North Star was no more, and Wangyue had passed away.There was no more Divine Martial Skill or Flood Dragon Person under the Jin Cheng Lake. All of the sins, regrets, distortions, and stubbornness disappeared like the Heart-Picking Willow.For a moment, nobody said anything. In the midst of the heavy snow, the four bright red words on the stone tablet next to the Jincheng Pond were still the same as when they first saw them. The surface of the water was peaceful and tranquil. No one could tell that there had been a catastrophe or suffering under the water.It was just like when they first climbed up Xuying Peak, they didn't know what kind of bloody story was behind the \"Journey to Nowhere\".Mo Ran looked at the sky. Above the cliff, a lone eagle flew by in the snow.He suddenly remembered that in his previous life, Wangyue gave him the Mo Sword. That Mo Sword was very powerful, but in this life, the Mo Sword he saw was just a fake. The real sword that belonged to him had probably self-destructed in the Heart-Picking Willow. He didn't have the chance to see it again in this life.After a while, he remembered something inexplicably.Back then, he came to the Jin Cheng Lake to seek the sword.That day, Wangyue floated to the water surface. His golden eyes looked at him gently and kindly. Then, he said to him.\u2014 \u2014\"The plum blossoms on the mountainside are blooming beautifully. Can you pluck one and give it to me?\"Mo Ran closed his eyes and gently covered his eyelids with his arm.In his previous life, he didn't know what was going on and actually thought that what Wangyue asked for was nothing more than flattery \u2026It was many days later when they returned to the peak of life and death.Chu Wanning's shoulder was badly injured, and the three youths were also mentally and physically exhausted. Therefore, they rested for many days in Dai City before returning to Shu.Xue Meng didn't tell Xue Zhengyong and Madam Wang about the sword. For someone as proud as him, whether his parents were disappointed or comforted him, it was like adding salt to a knife's edge.Chu Wanning saw this and couldn't bear to see Xue Meng like this. Therefore, he buried himself in the scroll all day long, hoping to find another way to get another Divine Weapon for Xue Meng.Or perhaps, is there any other way in the world that can allow a mortal to fight against a Divine Weapon?Apart from that, who was that fake North Star? Where was his real body now?What was the meaning behind the last words of the fake North Pole's' white piece 'before it self-destructed?There were too many things to worry about. In the Red Lotus Pavilion's library, the candlelight shone day and night. The copper pot leaked, and the complicated bamboo slips were spread all over the floor. In the depths of the scroll was Chu Wanning's slightly tired face.\"Yuheng, your shoulder is injured to this extent. Don't take any chances.\"Xue Zhengyong held a cup of hot tea and sat beside him, nagging, \"Elder Tanlang is skilled in medicine. When you have time, ask him to take a look at you.\"\"It's fine. It's already starting to heal.\"Xue Zhengyong clicked his tongue. \"No, no. Look at you. You haven't looked good since you came back.Nine out of ten people who see you say you look like you're going to faint at any moment.I think there's something wrong with your wound. Maybe there's poison or something. You should be more careful. \"Chu Wanning looked up. \"I look like I'm going to faint?\" He paused and sneered. \"Who said that?\"Xue Zhengyong was speechless.\"Aiya, Yuheng, don't always think that you're made of iron and others are made of paper.\"Chu Wanning said, \"I know what I'm doing.\"Xue Zhengyong muttered under his breath. From the shape of his mouth, it seemed like he was saying, \"What do you know?\"Fortunately, Chu Wanning was focused on reading and did not see his little action.After chatting for a while, Xue Zhengyong saw that it was late. He stood up and prepared to go back to accompany his wife. Before leaving, he did not forget to remind Chu Wanning, \"Yuheng, you should rest early.If Meng 'er finds out about you like this, he'll die of guilt. \"Chu Wanning didn't pay any attention to him.Xue Zhengyong was rebuffed and was a little embarrassed. He scratched his head and left.After Chu Wanning drank the medicine, he returned to the table and continued to read the scrolls. When he saw that he was faintly dizzy, he held his forehead and felt slightly disgusted.However, this disgust was fleeting. Chu Wanning only thought that he was tired and did not care.When it was late at night, he finally felt drowsy and fell asleep with a frown.His wide sleeves were piled on top of a mountain of scrolls. On his knees was a scroll of bamboo slips that he had not finished reading. The edges of his robe were withered like waves.That night, he had a dream.Unlike ordinary dreams, this dream was vivid and real.He stood in the Dan Xin Palace, which was at the peak of life and death. However, this Dan Xin Palace was different from what he knew. Many details of the furnishings were different. Before he could take a closer look, the door of the palace suddenly opened and a dark red curtain fluttered.Someone walked in.\"Master.\"The person was handsome and his eyes were dark and purple. Although he looked like a young man, when he curled up the corners of his mouth, he looked a little childish.\"Mo Ran?\"Chu Wanning stood up and was about to walk over when he found that his ankles were shackled by four iron chains with spiritual power. They bound him and prevented him from moving.After the shock, Chu Wanning was furious. He stared at the chains on his ankles in disbelief. For a moment, his face was distorted with anger and he was speechless. After a long time, he raised his head and said sternly, \"Mo Weiyu, are you rebelling?Untie me! \"However, the person did not seem to hear him. With a lazy smile on his face and deep dimples, he walked over and pinched his chin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChu Wanning's astonishment was completely indescribable. He opened his eyes wide, looking at the Mo Ran in his dream as if he was looking at a ghost.Mo Weiyu, who had already grown up, was very handsome. His shoulders were very wide, his legs were long, and he was even half a head taller than him.When he lowered his eyes to look at him, there was some playfulness and ridicule in the corners of his eyes.\"My good Shizun, you really should see what you look like now.\"His fingertips slid down Chu Wanning's cheeks and stopped by his ears, his eyes filled with frost.After a few moments of silence, he coldly snorted, and then suddenly leaned forward. A soft and hot feeling swept over him, and he sucked on Chu Wanning's lips.Caught off guard, Chu Wanning's mind exploded, as if a string \u2026.. snapped \u2026..Mo Ran was kissing him.His breath was invading him, wet, anxious, full of filthy and sinful desires.Their lips and teeth violently entangled, and waves rolled in his chest.Chu Wanning was almost in a daze, his phoenix eyes wide open. His mind was filled with anger and confusion, but in the dream, it was as if he had lost his spiritual power, and even ordinary strength was difficult to gather. He was simply unable to break free from Mo Ran's grip, and was firmly imprisoned in the other's arms.For some reason, the Mo Ran in his dream was completely different from the one he was familiar with.There was no longer the submissive and obedient attitude of the past, but instead, there was an aggressive and imposing manner.He could even clearly feel Mo Ran's hot breath, rapid and deep.The boiling beast desire was like magma, wanting to melt his flesh and bones into water.Chu Wanning was so angry that his face turned green, and he wanted to vomit blood.He could not imagine that he would be suppressed by Mo Ran without any strength to resist. What made it even more difficult for him to accept was that in this crazy and wet kiss, he actually felt his abdomen heat up, and his fingertips go soft.He was trembling in his arms. Mo Ran's chest was so hot that it felt like he was going to melt and drown him. He wanted to struggle, but he didn't have the strength.When the kiss ended, Chu Wanning's legs were weak. Mo Ran hugged him and turned his face to the back of his ear.Hot and moist breaths landed on his neck as he panted.Then he heard Mo Ran say, \"Didn't you want to discuss terms with Ben?\"Mo Ran's voice was very hoarse, so hoarse that Chu Wanning felt like he was a stranger.Chu Wanning lowered his eyes and saw his Adam's apple move. It was a swallowing motion that he was trying to hold back.\"You have no other value to me, so let's use the last thing you have left to negotiate.\"Chu Wanning's voice was also hoarse. He didn't know if it was because of desire or anger. He said in a low voice, \"What \u2026 \u2026\"Mo Ran forced him to the wall, then suddenly raised his hand and fiercely pushed against the wall. He fiercely grabbed one of Chu Wanning's chained wrists.He didn't have any evil intentions, but he also didn't have any sexual desire as he lowered his head and sucked on his earring.Chu Wanning instantly began to tremble violently, and a terrifying numbness spread from his tailbone to his scalp.Mo Ran's voice was low, and his breathing was very turbid and very heavy.\"If you let me do it once, I'll agree to your request.\"Chu Wanning suddenly opened his eyes wide. His eyes were wet with lust, but more than that, they were filled with disbelief.Mo Ran's other hand was already touching his waist, and his lips were rubbing against the side of his neck. His tone was gentle, but his words were vicious.\"But since I hate Shizun so much, I don't think I have much interest in Shizun's body.If I want to have fun, I'll have to trouble you to cooperate. \"Mo Ran paused, then continued to touch his waist, hugging him even tighter.\"So, think carefully. If you're willing, you'll kneel down and lick me properly. Once I'm comfortable, you'll lie on the bed and beg me to f * ck you.\"\"\u2026 \u2026\"Chu Wanning was about to go crazy.Elder Yu Heng was prideful, pure, and cold. He didn't touch men, didn't get close to women, didn't look at erotic pictures, didn't listen to erotic songs, and was honest, chaste, and aloof.To put it simply, he knew very little about matters of the heart.So he was very unfortunate. Although he was angry, he could only throw away his helmet and armor in front of this intense and unfamiliar feeling. He was utterly defeated.After Mo Ran finished speaking, he waited for a moment.Seeing that he didn't respond, he scolded in a low voice, but he couldn't help but start to kiss him. After kissing his lips enough, he withdrew his wet tongue from his mouth, bringing with it a trace of sparkling. Then, he fiercely bit his neck, licking and kissing his neck and ears.What made Chu Wanning's scalp go numb was that Mo Ran's hand started to violently tear at his robe. As he tore, he muttered, \"What are you pretending to be a gentleman for!What are you pretending to be a saint for! \"When he looked up at him, his gaze was blazing and crazy. The corners of his eyes were suffused with a strange light, as if the hatred that had been accumulating for a long time had finally been vented.It was also like the boiling lava of lust under the rock stratum, after a long period of forbearance, it gushed out wantonly.Chu Wanning seemed to be fiercely scalded by his wolf-like gaze. He wanted to look away, but Mo Ran saw through his thoughts and pinched his face.\"Look at me.\"His hoarse voice was boiling hot and slightly trembling. It was unknown whether it was because of excitement or something else.It sounded like the hunger of a wild beast pouncing on its prey.\"I told you to look at me!\"Chu Wanning trembled and closed his eyes.This dream was really too absurd \u2026\"Shizun.\"The voice by his ear suddenly became gentle and soft. It was a familiar tone. \"Shizun, wake up.\"In his blurred state, Chu Wanning saw Mo Ran's face right in front of him. Immediately, without thinking, he slapped him accurately and fiercely. With a 'pa' sound, it landed solidly on the other's cheek.Mo Ran was caught off guard and was hit head-on. \"Ah!\" He opened his eyes wide. \"Shizun, why are you randomly hitting people?\"\"\u2026 \u2026 \u2026\"Chu Wanning sat up. His pair of phoenix-like eyes were raised. The corners of his eyes were filled with anger and shock.His body was still slightly trembling. The dream and reality intertwined, driving him crazy.\"Shizun \u2026 \u2026\"\"Don't come over!\"Chu Wanning lowered his sword-like eyebrows and sternly shouted. His extreme reaction gave Mo Ran a fright.After a while, he cautiously asked, \"Did you have a nightmare?\"Nightmare \u2026 \u2026Yes, it was a dream \u2026 \u2026 It was just a dream.Chu Wanning stared at the person in front of him in a daze. After a long while, he gradually came back to his senses.He was still lying in the library of the Red Lotus Pavilion. The Dan Xin Palace and the young Mo Ran had disappeared together. What was left in front of him was only that young and childish face.\"\u2026 \u2026 Yes, in my dream \u2026 \u2026 I really hit people.\"After finally waking up, Chu Wanning paused for a moment to tidy up his expression. With his slender fingers that were still slightly trembling, he pretended to be serious and said while suppressing the heat and uneasiness that had not yet dissipated.Mo Ran rubbed his still red cheeks and gasped. \"What nightmare did you have, Shizun?You hit so hard \u2026 \u2026 \"A trace of embarrassment flashed across Chu Wanning's face. He pursed his lips and turned away half of his handsome face. He was cold and aloof and did not speak.His face was expressionless, but his heart was in turmoil. He felt that his self-esteem was about to shatter. He actually had such an absurd dream. Such filthy and shameless words. He was simply unworthy of being a teacher.What made him collapse even more was that his body actually failed to live up to expectations and reacted to such a humiliating dream \u2026 \u2026Fortunately, his robe was loose and elegant, so others could not see it.However, Chu Wanning held his forehead. His face was still as black as the bottom of a pot.He naturally could not vent his anger on Mo Ran in his dream, but this person in front of him who had delivered himself to him was still okay.Thus, he slanted his eyes and asked in an angry voice, \"You broke into my bedroom in the middle of the night. Do you think the Red Lotus Pavilion is your home?Do you think you are Elder Yu Heng? \"\"\u2026 \u2026\"First, he was inexplicably slapped in the face. Then, he was scolded. Mo Ran felt wronged and whispered, \"Why are you throwing a tantrum again \u2026 \u2026\"Chu Wanning's sword-like eyebrows shot up in anger. \"I'm not throwing a tantrum. I'm going to sleep. Get out!\"Mo Ran said, \"But Shizun, it's already morning.\"Chu Wanning: \"\u2026\"\"If we hadn't waited at the Good and Evil Stage for so long without seeing Master, I wouldn't have dared to come to the Red Lotus Pavilion to look for you.\"Chu Wan: \"\u2026\"The windows of the library were closed. He pushed open the window and saw that the sun was already up in the sky. Birds were chirping and insects were chirping.Chu Wanning's expression turned even uglier.It looked like he could summon the Heavenly Inquisition at any time.He actually had a wet dream until it was seven in the morning. If Mo Ran hadn't come to call him, he might have continued. This realization made the veins on Chu Wanning's forehead bulge, and his knuckles turn jade white as he pinched the window frame.It should be known that Chu Wanning's mental cultivation method had always been good at suppressing desires. Before this, he had never even had any erotic thoughts, let alone wet dreams.Chu Wanning was like a wooden man in this way, stupid and stiff. He had cultivated his mental cultivation method to perfection and cut off all desires. When he had nothing else to do, he liked to despise this pair of lovers fooling around and despise that pair of Taoist companions practicing Dual Cultivation. In the end, he was proud of himself and thought that he was particularly virtuous.Who would have thought that he would stumble and fall \u2026And fall in the hands of his own little disciple.The wise, noble, and elegant Master Chu didn't dare to look at Mo Ran anymore. He angrily said, \"Come with me to the Good and Evil Stage for morning practice!\" He flicked his sleeves and left.Xue Meng and Shi Mei had been waiting for a long time. When Chu Wanning arrived, they were sitting under the shade of a tree and talking.Shi Mei was very anxious. \"Shizun is never late. What's going on today?It's already so late, but we still haven't seen his shadow. \"Xue Meng was even more anxious. \"Didn't Mo Ran go to find Shizun?He hasn't come back after so long. If I had known, I would have gone with him.Shizun isn't sick, is he? \"Shi Mei said, \"I saw that the wound on Shizun's shoulder was very serious. Although he has been recuperating, his bones are weak. It's actually hard to say \u2026\"When Xue Meng heard this, he became even more restless. He suddenly stood up. \"No need to wait. Mo Ran, that unreliable dog, I'll go and see for myself!\"When he turned around, he saw Chu Wanning striding over, his white robes fluttering in the wind.The two people under the tree said together, \"Shizun!\"Chu Wanning said, \"I was delayed by some matters.Today, I'll take you to practice martial arts. Let's go. \"While Chu Wanning wasn't paying attention, Shi Mei quietly asked Mo Ran, who was following behind him, \"Shizun, are you okay?What's delayed you? \"Mo Ran rolled his eyes. \"I overslept.\"\"Ah?\"\"Shh, pretend you don't know.\"Mo Ran rubbed his cheek. The slap from before still hurt. He didn't want to be slapped by Chu Wanning for no reason.Shi Mei's eyelashes fluttered. \"Why is your left cheek red?\"Mo Ran whispered, \"If you keep asking, my right cheek will turn red too. Don't ask anymore. Let's go.\"The three people went to the training field. Chu Wanning let Mo Ran and Shi Mei practice on their own, leaving Xue Meng alone.Chu Wanning said, \"Sit down.\"Although Xue Meng didn't understand why, he had always followed his Shizun's instructions. He immediately sat down.Chu Wanning also sat down in front of him. He said to him, \"The Sword Conference of Holy Mountain is in three years. What are your plans?\"Xue Meng lowered his eyes. After a moment, he gritted his teeth and said, \"I'll win first place.\"If Chu Wanning had asked him this before the trip to Jincheng Lake, Xue Meng would have answered proudly.But at this time, when he said this, he couldn't let go of his pride and stubbornly held on.It wasn't that he didn't know his place, but he really didn't want to give up the title of \"God's Favored Child\".After saying \"win first place,\" Xue Meng felt anxious. He stole a glance at Chu Wanning.But Chu Wanning only glanced at him. He didn't mock or question him.He simply said one word.\"Good.\"Xue Meng's eyes suddenly lit up. \"Shizun, do you think \u2014 do you think I can \u2026 I \u2026\" He was so excited that he couldn't speak properly.Chu Wanning said, \"Under my tutelage, there is no disciple who gives up before a fight.\"\"Shizun \u2026\"\"Those who participate in the Sword Conference of Holy Mountain are all outstanding youths of various sects.Those who don't have Divine Martial Skills naturally won't be your match. You don't have to be afraid of those who have Divine Martial Skills. \"Chu Wanning said, \"Divine Martial Skills can't be controlled overnight. Although your Saber Longcheng is slightly inferior, it's still a top-grade weapon that can be forged in the mortal world.If you practice diligently these three years and make good use of it, it's not impossible for you to win first place. \"Everyone knew that Grandmaster Chu had a keen eye for martial arts and was quite insightful.He was also a sentimental person who would never tell white lies to motivate others. So when Xue Meng heard his words, he immediately felt excited.\"Shizun, are you speaking the truth?\"Chu Wanning narrowed his eyes and said lightly, \"Xue Meng, how old are you?I don't even coax people who are over five years old. \"When he said this, Xue Meng was a bit embarrassed. He rubbed his nose and laughed.Chu Wanning said again, \"Victory and defeat are unpredictable, but pride is not to be underestimated. Work hard. As for the result, you don't have to force it.\"Xue Meng said, \"Yes!\"After comforting Xue Meng, Chu Wanning went to the ling power wooden dummies behind the practice field. In order to prevent the disciples from accidentally injuring others when striking the wooden dummies, this place was built in a remote area. One had to pass through a long corridor and turn a corner to reach the pile of dummies.Shi Mei and Mo Ran had their backs to him and were talking. They weren't too far away and he could hear them.\"You \u2026\" Chu Wanning was about to call them over, but the scene in front of him made him stop abruptly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs a person who cherished weapons, this scene made Chu Wanning so angry that he was speechless.He was afraid that he was looking at an idiot.Not far away, under the flowering trees, Mo Ran summoned the Ghost.The God of War could freely expand and shrink, but most people were willing to make their weapons bigger and more impressive. At the very least, like Chu Wanning, they would keep their normal appearance.However, Mo Ran had shrunk the ghost into a very small one. It was about the same length and thickness as a headband. Ye Linglong, a dignified Divine Martial Artist, looked like a pitiful little child.Everyone's spiritual energy was different. Chu Wanning's Heaven's Inquisition was golden when he poured spiritual energy into it, but the Ghost was red.Therefore, without the willow leaves, the Ghost looked like a matchmaker \u2026\"Shi Mei, tie this on your hand. I want to know if the Ghost is the same as Heaven's Inquisition, and if it also has the ability to coax people into telling the truth.\"\"Uh \u2026 you want to test it on me?\"Mo Ran laughed: \"Yes, because I'm the best with you, and I believe that you won't lie to me.\"Shi Mei was still hesitant: \"That's true, but \u2026\"\"Aiya, I won't ask tricky questions.If you don't believe me, let's make a pinky promise. \"Saying so, he stretched out his pinky.Shi Mei didn't know whether to laugh or cry: \"How old are you? You're still so childish.\"\"Pinky swear. You can pinky swear when you're eight years old, you can pinky swear when you're eighteen. Even when you're eighty-eight, you can still pinky swear. What's so childish about it?\" Mo Ran grinned as he held up Shi Mei's right hand and pinky swear.Shi Mei was both angry and amused, but there was nothing he could do. In the end, he could only let him do as he pleased.Unexpectedly, Mo Ran grabbed Shi Mei's pinky, but didn't make a pinky promise with him. Instead, he narrowed his eyes and laughed: \"The Ghost, let's get to work.\"With two swishing sounds, the ghost tied Shi Mei's pinky finger with lightning speed, while the other end was tied to Mo Ran's pinky finger, which was still standing upright.The handsome youth smiled like a sly fox that had ascended to heaven. His dimples were deep as he happily said, \"Congratulations, you've been fooled.\"Shi Mei didn't know whether to laugh or cry, \"You!\u2026 Let go of me. \"\"There's no rush,\" Mo Ran said with a smile. \"I'll release you after I ask a few questions.\"In fact, ever since Jin Chengchi obtained the Sauvignon Blanc and Shi Mei failed to open the box, Mo Ran felt uneasy.Although Shi Mei was wearing gloves at that time and couldn't touch the box directly, Mo Ran still couldn't completely let it go. Moreover, Chu Wanning was the one who opened the box in the end.Chu Wanning \u2026 How is this possible \u2026Therefore, Mo Ran felt that Xiangsi must have been broken.However, in order to confirm this, he felt that it was best to confirm it with the ghost.He didn't doubt his sincerity towards Shi Mei, but he was worried that in Shi Mei's heart, he was actually insignificant.As for Jin Chengchi saying that he liked him, it might just be his own imagination.He felt that Shi Mei had a gentle temperament and treated everyone well.Unlike Chu Wanning, who always put on a face as if others owed him a mountain of gold and silver, which was especially annoying.Although the Emperor Ta was a rough person, when he was thinking about his sweetheart, this guy could be very troublesome.\"First of all.\"Although Mo Ran was worried, he still maintained a smile on his face and pretended to be relaxed. He even decided to throw out a few irrelevant questions to pave the way for the real story.\"What do you think of Xue Meng?\"Feeling the pain on his finger, Shi Mei couldn't help but answer honestly, \"Young Master is very good, but he's too direct and sometimes it's unbearable.\"Mo Ran clapped and laughed, \"Eh?You also have times when you can't stand him?Hahaha, no wonder, after all, he's so annoying. \"Shi Mei blushed, \"\u2026 Lower your voice, don't let Young Master hear you.\"\"Okay okay okay.\" Mo Ran laughed, \"But I'm very happy when you say bad things about him.\"Shi Mei, \"\u2026\"Mo Ran asked again, \"Then what do you think of Shizun?\"\"Shizun is very good, but his temper is a bit \u2026\" It seemed that Shi Mei really didn't want to comment on Chu Wanning, but he couldn't do anything about it. After biting his lip for a while, he said with grievance, \"His temper is a bit irritable.\"\"Haha, how is that irritable, it's clearly very irritable.He gets angry every few days and refuses to admit it when he's angry. I think even Consort Gui is easier to serve than him. \"Chu Wanning, who was standing in the corner, \"\u2026\"Mo Ran suddenly became curious and asked, \"Since you know that Shizun has a bad temper, why do you still want to be his disciple?\"Shi Mei said, \"Shizun has a cold face but a kind heart. My talent is not as good as others, but he never thinks that I'm stupid. He says that education is for all. Since I'm not good at attacking, he teaches me healing and recovery techniques.He, he treats me very well. \"Mo Ran was originally happy, but when he heard this, he suddenly stopped smiling and gradually became silent.After a while, Mo Ran said, \"How is he treating you well?He just teaches you some spells and occasionally takes care of you. If it were any other Master, they would do the same. \"\"That's not the same \u2013\"Mo Ran suddenly became unhappy and puffed up his cheeks, \"Anyway, he doesn't treat you well!I can do all the things that he does to you! \"Shi Mei didn't say anything.In this awkward silence, Mo Ran gradually calmed down the anger in his heart. When he saw that Shi Mei didn't say anything, he suddenly felt guilty and whispered, \"I'm sorry.\"\"It's okay.\" Shi Mei said.But after a while, Shi Mei said somewhat abruptly, \"A few years ago, before you came to the Peak of Life and Death, there was one time when I was walking on the road and there was a sudden rainstorm.\"\"At that time, I hadn't become Shizun's disciple yet. When I was running in the rain, I met him.He was holding a red oil-paper umbrella. When he saw that I was in a difficult situation, he asked me to hide under his umbrella.I had long heard of his cold reputation. When I walked side by side with him, my heart was very nervous. \"\"And then?\"Shi Mei said with a gentle expression, \"And then?And then we didn't talk the whole way. \"Mo Ran nodded in agreement, \"He's such a boring person. There really isn't much to say to him.\"\"Yes.\" Shi Mei smiled, \"Shizun is a man of few words.But when he sent me to the door, I thanked him.Suddenly, I saw that his right shoulder was completely soaked. And I was standing on his left the whole way, so I didn't get wet at all. \"Mo Ran, \"\u2026 \u2026\"\"That oil-paper umbrella was very small. In fact, it was only big enough for one person to hold it.He blocked most of it for me. I watched as he walked away in the rain. When I returned to my room, I wrote an invitation to become his disciple, begging him to accept me as his disciple. \"\"Don't say anymore.\" Mo Ran suddenly said, \"You're too kind. If you keep talking, I'll feel sorry for you.\"Shi Mei said warmly, \"Mo Ran, don't you think that Shizun is the one who's sorry?He only has such a small umbrella. Because he always walks alone, no one is willing to accompany him.So sometimes, when Shizun is a bit strict with me or scolds me a bit more, I don't care.Because I remember his soaked shoulder. \"Mo Ran didn't say anything. Only the tip of his nose was slightly red, and a trace of bitterness floated in his heart.That feeling of bitterness was a bit vague. Suddenly, he didn't know who this feeling was for.\"Mo Ran, let me ask you a question.\"\"Mm, go ahead.\"\"Do you especially hate Shizun?\"Mo Ran stared blankly, \"I \u2026 \u2026\"\"Or should I say, you don't like him, right?\"When Shi Mei asked this question, his usually calm and gentle gaze seemed a bit sharp.Mo Ran was caught off guard. Under such a sharp gaze, he was suddenly speechless.Mo Ran lowered his head. He didn't nod or shake his head. After a long time, he forced a smile and said, \"Aiya, wasn't I the one asking you a question?I wasn't careful and actually got tangled up by you.How can this be? \"Seeing that he was avoiding the question, Shi Mei didn't insist. He only smiled and said, \"I'm just asking casually. You don't have to take it to heart.\"\"Mm.\"Mo Ran tidied up his mood and then looked up. Through the curtain of his thick eyelashes, he looked at Shi Mei's beautiful face.Originally, his third question was to ask whether Shi Mei liked him or not.But after this conversation, his mood suddenly became heavy. After a while of silence, Mo Ran suddenly said, \"He's my Shizun. He's only my Shizun. It's not about whether I like him or not.\"Hearing this, Chu Wanning, who was standing in the dark, slightly moved his eyelashes, like the rustling wings of an injured butterfly.Although some things were clear in one's heart, when it was confirmed, one still felt like one's body was floating and one's heart was sinking into the sea.Maybe it was because autumn came early, but Chu Wanning suddenly felt a bit cold.In the distance, Mo Ran and Shi Mei were talking. He closed his eyes. The slight nausea that had recently appeared occasionally rose to his head.He suddenly felt extremely tired. He turned around and wanted to leave.But after a few steps, Mo Ran's voice was carried by the autumn wind and faintly passed into his ears.He couldn't help but stop in his tracks.Mo Ran asked Shi Mei the third question, \"Okay, you talked about Xue Meng and Shizun. Now, let's talk about me.\"He tried to minimize the concern in his voice. Carefully, even somewhat humbly, he asked,\"Shi Mei, what do you think of me?\"Shi Mei suddenly stopped talking.Like Heaven's Inquisition, the ghost obviously had the ability to interrogate the truth. Shi Mei resisted answering. Because of this, the ghost's red light became brighter and tighter around Shi Mei's fingertips.Shi Mei frowned, \"It hurts \u2026\"\"I only want you to say one thing.\"Mo Ran couldn't bear it, but this question was buried deep in his heart. In both his previous and current lives, it had almost become his inner demon. So he still insisted on asking, \"What do you think of me?\"Shi Mei shook his head and closed his eyes. It seemed that he was in great pain. His long eyelashes couldn't stop trembling and his forehead gradually seeped out with fine sweat.\"\u2026\" Mo Ran saw him like this. In the end, his heart softened. He sighed, \"Forget it \u2026\"He was about to withdraw from the ghost when Shi Mei couldn't hold it in any longer. His face was as white as gold paper. He said hoarsely, \"I think you are very good.\"Mo Ran suddenly opened his eyes wide.After Shi Mei said this, his originally pale face quickly turned red. He seemed to be very annoyed. He lowered his eyes and didn't dare to look at the ghost.The ghost turned into little red lights, like the petals of a flower, fluttering back into Mo Ran's palm. Mo Ran couldn't hold it in. He lowered his head and laughed softly. When he looked up at Shi Mei again, his eyebrows and eyes were rippling like spring flowers in full bloom.There was a lazy smile in his voice, but his eyes were a little wet. He said, \"Okay, thank you.I also think you are very good.Although Jin Chengchi had told you about it, you didn't remember it at all.So I want to say it again. You are really \u2026 very likable. \"Although he didn't say in detail what kind of 'like' it was, Shi Mei's neck still turned red. He couldn't say a word.Mo Ran stared at him with a pair of deep eyes.The light in his eyes was so clear, like the stars in the sea or the waves in the Milky Way.\"I want to treat you very well and make you happy.\"Shi Mei wasn't stupid. Looking at his expression, he knew what he was thinking. He couldn't help but lower his head.Mo Ran looked at him and couldn't help but want to raise his hand to touch Shi Mei's hair.But before he could get close, a golden light suddenly flashed. \"Pa!\" A vine whip hit Mo Ran's face solidly.\"Ah!\" Mo Ran felt pain and turned around in shock.He saw Chu Wanning standing with his hands behind his back. He was wearing a white robe that was whiter than snow. He was standing by the green roof and white wall, looking down at them coldly.Heaven's Inquisition was like a snake hissing and flicking its tongue. It coiled around the ground, its willow leaves rustling. From time to time, it would burst into a cluster of sparks and a ray of golden light.Shi Mei said in shock, \"Shizun \u2026\"Mo Ran covered his face and said, \"Shizun.\"So what if he was hated? So what if he wasn't liked?If it was someone else, they would cry bitterly. But if it was Chu Wanning \u2026 Cry?Ridiculous.Of course, he would beat the one who didn't know what to do.Chu Wanning's expression was extremely cold. He walked over and said coldly, \"Why are you chatting here instead of cultivating?Mo Weiyu, do you think you're so great just because you got the last Divine Martial Skill?You're so confident that you're invincible?You're in such a leisurely mood. \"\"Shizun, I just want to \u2026\"Chu Wanning's eyes were fierce. Mo Ran shut up.\"Shi Mingjing, come with me. Mo Weiyu.\"He paused and said in disgust, \"Go and cultivate. If you can't last ten moves with me when I come to spar with you, you'll go back and copy the Qingxin Manual three hundred times as punishment.Scram. \"Ten moves?Mo Ran felt that it was better for him to copy the Qingxin Manual directly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFor the next three days, Chu Wanning's complexion was not very good, and his temper was also very irritable.Yu Heng's disgust was written all over his face. Wherever he went, he was shrouded in a layer of haze. When the disciples saw him, they scattered like birds and beasts. Even Xue Zhengyong could feel the faint murderous aura around him, and did not dare to talk too much with him.Although Chu Wanning was not willing to admit that he had improper thoughts about Mo Ran, when he saw his two disciples' affectionate appearances in front of the wooden dummy, he could not help but feel angry and sour in his chest.He was a bit disgusted.Not only was he disgusted with others, but he was even more disgusted with himself.Mo Weiyu and himself were only master and disciple. What did it have to do with him who he wanted to stick to and who he wanted to tangle with?What right did he have to throw a willow vine because he could not stand it?What did it have to do with him who he wanted to stick to?What did it have to do with him?Chu Wanning, how could your heart be smaller than the tip of a needle!\u2026 \u2026 Fine, let's take a step back. So what if he had those unspeakable desires for Mo Ran?He had always been proud of his self-control and pride. It was enough to restrain his heart, enough to strangle those terrifying desires to death in his heart with the passage of time.These feelings that could not see the light of day, other than himself, no one would know.Other than the silk pouch left by the ghost master, and the strand of black hair that entangled him and Mo Ran, nothing would be left.Mo Ran would not know his feelings, just like how Mo Ran would never know that at the bottom of the Jincheng Pool, the person who endured the pain to save him was not Shi Mei, but himself who had temporarily swapped souls with Shi Mei.But now, what was this?Was this \u2026 jealousy?This thought made Chu Wanning choke on her own words.In the following months, he tried his best to avoid contact with Mo Ran. Other than the daily guidance of cultivation, he did not have much interaction.In the blink of an eye, the end of the year approached. One day, Chu Wanning returned from slaying demons at the foot of the mountain. As he walked to the front of the mountain gate, snow suddenly began to fall from the sky.Soon, the Peak of Life and Death was enveloped by the Misty Silver Outfit. Chu Wanning felt cold all over, so he tightened his robe and strode towards the Core Heart Palace.A charcoal fire was lit in the hall, and the wood in the copper basin made a crisp crackling sound.Chu Wanning had originally come to report to Xue Zhengyong, but the Great Lord was not here. Instead, he bumped into Mo Ran.There was no one else in the Core Heart Palace. This was the first time in months that Chu Wanning was alone with him. He could not help but feel a little awkward.What's more, that absurd dream had happened here.Speaking of that dream, Chu Wanning actually had it many times. Each time, the image was clear and vivid. At first, Chu Wanning was still conflicted, but later, he simply got used to it. In the dream, Mo Ran was like a little lunatic, spouting nonsense. He was so bored that he could count Mo Ran's eyelashes, one, two, three \u2026However, that dream always came to an abrupt end at a critical moment. After several times of this, Grandmaster Chu thought that it must be because of his noble nature that he would not think of such filthy things.With this thought, Elder Yu Heng, who had a fragile heart of a virgin, finally managed to regain some of his dignity.However, the combination of Mo Ran and the Core Heart Palace still made Chu Wanning feel a little threatened.However, that young man did not feel anything. When he saw him, he relaxed his dark brows and grinned. \"Master, you're back.\"\"\u2026 Yes.\"\"Looking for Uncle?He went to Auntie's Hall. Auntie is not feeling well, so he can't leave.If you have anything to say, I'll pass it on to him. \"Chu Wanning pursed his lips and said lightly, \"No need.\"After that, he turned to leave.However, Mo Ran called out to him. \"Master, wait a moment.\"\"What \u2026\"He turned around as he spoke, but was caught off guard by Mo Ran's hand reaching out and brushing the tip of his dark brows.Mo Ran brushed it off and said naturally, \"Look at you, you're covered in snow.\"Chu Wanning was stunned.He let the young man nag and remove the snow on him. Then, he took a white handkerchief and wiped his wet hair.Chu Wanning was afraid of the cold and could not catch a cold. Otherwise, he would easily fall ill.However, this person did not know how to take care of himself. In his previous life, after Chu Wanning was put under house arrest, he often liked to sit in the courtyard and watch the koi fish jump around. He did not even know it was snowing.As a result, he often caught a cold or had a fever. After his spiritual nucleus was destroyed, his master became weaker and weaker. He was often bedridden for more than half a month. Even if he drank medicine after medicine, it did not seem to get better.Therefore, when Mo Ran saw snowflakes falling between his eyebrows and shoulders again, half melting and the other half condensing, he subconsciously wanted to brush them off.However, when he was halfway through, he suddenly realized that this action seemed to be too intimate. He suddenly looked up and happened to meet Chu Wanning's pair of deep phoenix eyes.Chu Wanning was staring at him. \"\u2026\"Mo Ran withdrew his hand. \"Ahaha, disciple overstepped. Master, wipe it yourself, wipe it yourself.\"When he was embarrassed, Chu Wanning was relieved.After all, a dream was just a dream.His disciple's temperament was still the same as before. He was completely different from the person in the dream who called himself \"this lord\".Chu Wanning was silent for a while. He took Mo Ran's handkerchief and took off his cloak. He walked to the stove to warm his hands and wipe the melting snow on his hair.\"When did you know you overstepped?\" The firelight reflected on Chu Wanning's face. He narrowed his eyes and said, \"Haven't you always been overstepping?\"Mo Ran, \"\u2026\"For a moment, no one spoke. After Chu Wanning finished wiping his hair, he casually put away the handkerchief and glanced at Mo Ran.\"But then again, what are you doing here?\"Mo Ran hurriedly said, \"Isn't it the end of the year?A year's worth of files needs to be sorted out. I'm here to help \u2026 \"Chu Wanning interrupted him, \"I know there is a year's worth of files to be sorted out, but isn't this Shi Mingjing's matter?Why are you doing it? \"Mo Ran, \"\u2026 Shizun's memory is really good.\"Chu Wanning was unmoved by this flattery, \"Where is he?\"\"He said he had a headache and fever this morning. He was also sweating all over.\"Seeing Chu Wanning's expression, Mo Ran said, \"I'm sorry, Shizun. I advised him to stay in bed and rest.Don't blame him for being lazy. \"That kind of apology was like a sharp needle, pricking Chu Wanning's brows. Chu Wanning was silent for a while, then asked, \"Is he okay?\"Mo Ran saw that he didn't blame him and sighed in relief, \"When I came out, I just gave him some medicine to drink. I only left when I saw that he had fallen asleep.It's just a cold, so he should be fine in two or three days.Thank you for your concern, Shizun. \"\"What do I have to care about you guys? I was just asking.\"Mo Ran, \"\u2026\"\"I'm leaving.Tidy up well. \"As Chu Wanning said this, he walked away alone.At the Peak of Life and Death, disciples were strictly prohibited from doing things for each other. Mo Ran originally thought that he would be punished by Shizun, but he didn't expect that Chu Wanning would let him go so easily. For a while, he didn't react and stood there in a daze for a long time. When he was almost far away, he suddenly came back to his senses.People walking alone in the snow, Mo Ran picked up the umbrella by the door and braved the snow to run out.\"Shizun!\"\"Shizun, wait a moment!\"Chu Wanning turned around. Mo Ran stopped in front of him, shook the snow off the umbrella, and opened it properly above the two of them.\"The snow is heavy, take the umbrella and go back.\"Chu Wanning glanced at him, \"No need.\"Mo Ran put the umbrella in his hands, but Chu Wanning was tired of it and insisted on not wanting it. As he pulled, the umbrella was pushed and fell into the snow. With a strong gust of wind, it suddenly floated several feet away.Chu Wanning stared at the umbrella that fell into the snow. He stared for a while. This was originally a small matter. He wanted to be as indifferent as before and leave.But suddenly, he couldn't move.Just like how a candle flame would eventually be extinguished, an ancient well would also dry up.Even the most patient person would have a time when they broke down.Chu Wanning turned around and flicked his sleeves, \"Mo Weiyu, can you not provoke me?I'm not Shi Mingjing, I don't need anyone to take care of me! \"As he spoke, a golden light suddenly lit up in his hand. Mo Ran subconsciously took a step back, thinking that he was going to use Heaven's Inquisition to hit him again. Who knew that a golden spring would appear in Chu Wanning's hand, forming a resplendent barrier in the air. In an instant, it blocked the wind and snow around him.Mo Ran, \"\u2026\"A barrier that could block the snow and rain \u2026Chu Wanning's sword-like eyebrows furrowed, his expression cold, \"Do you think I need an umbrella?\"He seemed to be really angry. His fingertips moved quickly, and the light of the barrier changed from gold to red, from red to purple, from purple to blue, from blue to green.Every time the color changed, the effects of the barrier would be different. Some could only block the snow, some could block the cold wind, and some could even turn the cold of the snow into warmth within the barrier.These moves were too powerful. Of course, Chu Wanning wouldn't waste his spiritual energy to block the snow like this. This kind of show-off was so childish that Mo Ran was speechless for a moment.\"Shizun, don't be angry \u2026\"\"Which eye of yours saw that I was angry?!\" Chu Wanning was so angry that his face turned green. \"Get lost!\"\"Okay, okay, okay, I'll get lost, I'll get lost.\" Mo Ran glanced at the barrier above his head. \"But don't waste your spiritual energy like this \u2026\"\"Get lost!\"Chu Wanning waved his hand, and the barrier suddenly closed, turning into a bolt of lightning that struck in front of Mo Ran.Mo Ran was almost struck by the lightning summoned by Chu Wanning. It was rare for him to show concern for the other, but he was met with such a reaction. For a moment, he was a bit angry. Just as he was about to say something, he looked up and saw Chu Wanning standing in the snow. His face was pale, and his eyes were a bit red.Mo Ran was stunned. \"You \u2026\"\"You and I are just master and disciple. There's no need to be so concerned.Take your umbrella and get out of here. \"Mo Ran was shocked, and suddenly understood.\"Shizun, that day at the practice field, when I was talking to Shi Mei, did you \u2026\"He heard it.Chu Wanning didn't say anything, and turned to leave.This time, Mo Ran didn't call him, and he didn't look back.Halfway through, he couldn't help but sneeze. Chu Wanning's footsteps stiffened, and then he walked even faster. It seemed like he was angry, but also like he was running away.And from beginning to end, Mo Ran stood in the boundless snow, staring blankly at his back until it disappeared. No one knew what he was thinking.As soon as Chu Wanning returned to the Red Lotus Pavilion, he fell ill.Although he could use the barrier to avoid the rain and snow, when it came to his own matters, he was very lazy, and even more unwilling to waste his spiritual energy.Otherwise, when it rained, he wouldn't act like a normal person, casually holding an oil paper umbrella and walking around.After sneezing a few times in succession, they all came looking for him with headaches and fevers.However, he had been ill for a long time and was no longer surprised by colds. He took some medicine, washed up, and changed his clothes. Then, he crawled under the blanket and fell asleep.Perhaps it was because of the cold, the nausea that had been acting up since Jin Chengchi was injured was particularly obvious tonight. He slept in a drowsy state for a whole night. His whole body was soaked in cold sweat, and his body was as hot as a stove.At noon the next day, Chu Wanning vaguely woke up. He opened his eyes and lay on the bed in a daze for a while before slowly jumping off the bed and preparing to put on his shoes.Then, he was stunned.He suddenly realized that after one night, his boots had become much bigger \u2026He took a closer look.Chu Wanning: \"\u2026\"\u2026No matter how calm Elder Yu Heng was, he could not endure this shock.It wasn't his boots that were getting bigger.Chu Wanning stared blankly at his own hands, his own legs, his own bare feet, and his shoulders that were exposed from under his clothes.Did I \u2026 become smaller????Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayXue Zhengyong was practicing his swordsmanship on the North Peak when a begonia flower suddenly fell from the sky. He made a sound of surprise and took the begonia flower while wiping his sweat with a handkerchief. He muttered to himself, \"Yu Heng sent a message to the begonia flower?Can't he come and tell me himself?When did he become so lazy? \"Although he said this, Xue Zhengyong still picked up the golden light in the begonia flower and put it into his ear.An unfamiliar child's voice came from it. \"My Lord, please come to the Red Lotus Pavilion when you have time \u2026\"Xue Zhengyong did not believe it at first, but when he landed in front of Chu Wanning's residence on his sword, he was completely dumbfounded.In the pavilion next to the lotus pond, a child about five or six years old stood with his hands behind his back and stared at the lotus leaf with a gloomy expression.From the side, this person's face was as white as snow, and his eyes were as cold as ice. He was even wearing Chu Wanning's robes, but they were too big for him. His sleeves and robes dragged on the ground, making him look like a fish in a pond with a giant tail.Xue Zhengyong, \"\u2026\"The child looked back with an arrogant expression that said, \"If you dare laugh, I'll die.\"Xue Zhengyong, \"Pfft, hahahahaha!!!\"The child slammed the table and said angrily, \"What are you laughing at!What's so funny! \"\"It's not that I'm not laughing \u2026 Ahahaha, oh no, Yu Heng, I told you to go to Elder Tanlang and take a look at the wound, but you didn't listen. Hahahaha, this is so funny.\"Xue Zhengyong held his stomach and said, \"I've never seen a child with such a strong murderous aura, ahahahaha.\"This child was none other than Chu Wanning, who woke up to find that his body had shrunk.Jin Chengchi pierced through the vines on his back and back. He did not know what spell it was, but it turned people into their five or six years old appearance. Fortunately, his magic power did not regress, otherwise, Chu Wanning felt that he could really die.Xue Zhengyong laughed as he went to find a set of disciple's robes for him.After Chu Wanning put it on, he did not look so funny.He tidied up his blue-bottomed silver-edged gauntlets and glared at Xue Zhengyong. Then, he said fiercely, \"I'll kill you if you tell anyone.\"Xue Zhengyong laughed and said, \"I won't say, I won't say.But what are you going to do?I don't know anything about medicine, so I have to find someone to take a look, right?Why don't I invite Elder Tanlang over \u2026 \"Chu Wanning angrily flicked his sleeves, only to find that the little disciple uniform had a narrow collar and tight sleeves. When he waved his sleeves, there was no imposing manner at all. He became even more displeased. \"Why did you invite him?Let him laugh at me? \"\"Why don't I ask my wife to take a look?\"Chu Wanning pursed his lips and didn't speak. He actually looked a little aggrieved.\"I'll take your silence as a yes.\"Chu Wanning turned around and faced him with the back of his head.Xue Zhengyong knew that he was depressed, but this spectacle was too funny. After holding it in for a while, he couldn't hold it in anymore and burst out laughing again.With a 'shua' sound, the Heaven's Inquisition was summoned. Chu Wanning glanced sideways and sternly said, \"You dare to laugh again!\"\"I won't laugh anymore, I won't laugh anymore.I'll go find my wife now, ahahahaha. \"Xue Zhengyong ran away like a wisp of smoke. Not long after, he brought an anxious Madam Wang over.Madam Wang was stunned when she saw Chu Wanning. After a while, she said in disbelief.\"Elder Yu Heng \u2026\"Chu Wanning, \"\u2026\"Fortunately, compared to Xue Zhengyong, Madam Wang was a doctor with a benevolent heart. She didn't laugh at Chu Wanning. Instead, she carefully examined him and then softly said,\"Elder's spiritual energy is flowing smoothly, and there's nothing wrong with his body.It seems that other than turning into a child, there's nothing different about him. \"Chu Wanning asked, \"Madam, do you know how to resolve this?\"Madam Wang shook her head and said, \"Elder's injuries were caused by the ancient willow vine. I'm afraid there's no second case of this in the world.Therefore, I don't know how to deal with it. \"Chu Wanning's eyelashes suddenly drooped, and he couldn't say anything for a long time. He was clearly stunned.Madam Wang couldn't bear to see this and hurriedly said, \"Elder Yu Heng, in my opinion, the reason why you've become like this is probably because the vine's sap used for self-healing has invaded your wounds. It's not an evil curse.Otherwise, it wouldn't have taken so long to act up.I think that the sap is very small. It's because you've been too busy these past few days that the curse affected your body.Why don't you recuperate for a while and see how things go? \"After a moment of silence, Chu Wanning sighed and said, \"I guess that's the only way.Thank you, Madam. \"\"You're welcome.\"Madam Wang carefully sized him up again and said, \"With Elder's current appearance, if you don't say it, no one will be able to tell.\"She was right. Chu Wanning had long forgotten the things that happened when he was five or six years old. However, when he looked at his reflection in the lake, other than some facial features, he didn't look very similar to his adult self.His heart finally relaxed a little. He raised his head and said to Xue Zhengyong,\"Lord, I'm going to be in seclusion at the Red Lotus Pavilion for a few days. Please take care of Xue Meng and the others.\"\"What are you saying? Meng 'er is my son, Ran' er is my nephew, and Shi Mei is a disciple of the Peak of Life and Death. Of course I have to take care of them,\" Xue Zhengyong said with a smile. \"You should worry more about yourself.\"However, Chu Wanning had been meditating for three days straight, but he didn't see his body return to its original appearance. He couldn't help but feel even more worried. He was also thousands of miles away from Madam Wang's words of \"recuperation\".One evening, Chu Wanning finally couldn't bear the agitation in his heart. Seeing that his cultivation was fruitless, he simply left the Southern Peak and walked around to relax.It was already past dinner time, and the night practice had yet to begin. The Peak of Life and Death's empty valleys, secluded paths, bridges, and pavilions were filled with groups of three to five disciples. No one noticed him.Chu Wanning strolled around and went to a bamboo forest near the Stage of Good and Evil.The Elders had their own practice areas that they were used to. Usually, they would bring their disciples to a fixed place to practice.Chu Wanning was used to this bamboo forest.The bamboo shadows were bleak, and the leaves were rustling.Chu Wanning broke off a leaf and put it to his lips. He slowly blew on it. The quiet and fragmented music calmed his mind.But not long after, the sound of footsteps came from afar and stopped near him.\"Hey, kid.\"Chu Wanning opened his eyes.Xue Meng was standing proudly in the bamboo forest with his slender waist and long legs. He was holding the glittering saber Longcheng and was talking to him.\"I'm going to practice my saber here. You go somewhere else.\"\"\u2026\" Chu Wanning raised his eyebrows slightly. This was a strange feeling. Xue Meng was bossing him around.He thought for a while and said, \"I'll play my saber and you practice yours. Let's not disturb each other.\"Xue Meng said, \"How can that be?Go, go, my saber will hurt you. \"\"You can't hurt me.\"Xue Meng was a little impatient. He clicked his tongue and said, \"Then I'll remind you. If you get hurt later, I won't care about you.\"As soon as he finished speaking, he pulled out his saber. Longcheng let out a vigorous cry, like a snake in a deep pool riding on the clouds, breaking through the air.In a split second, the forest was mottled with light and shadow. The Sword Qi was like a rainbow. Xue Meng danced Longcheng in the bamboo leaves. With one slash, a bamboo leaf was broken into ten pieces. With one slash, the bamboo leaves fell down.Bit by bit, stab by stab, stroke by stroke, it was done in one breath like the wind returning to the snow.With such a sharp saber technique, not to mention a five year old child, even a fifty year old cultivator would praise it.But when Xue Meng finished his Ten Styles Dance, the child sitting on the rock was still blowing his leaves. It was as if there was nothing to see in front of him, and there was nothing to be surprised about.Xue Meng was a little angry. He put away his saber and jumped down from the top of the bamboo forest. He landed lightly in front of Chu Wanning.\"Child.\"\"\u2026\"\"Hey, child, I'm talking to you.\"Chu Wanning put down his bamboo leaves and slowly opened his eyes. He looked at him expressionlessly. \"What?Didn't your master teach you to be more polite when talking to people?Don't just say 'hey' and 'hey'.I have a name. \"\"I don't care what your name is.\"Xue Meng originally wanted to talk nicely, but when he heard him speak with sarcasm, he immediately lost his good mood. \"Get out of my way. You saw it yourself. Sabers and swords don't have eyes. Be careful that I don't cut your head off.\"Chu Wanning casually said, \"You can't even avoid my head. What's the point of practicing?\"\"You!\"Xue Meng had never been talked back to like this since he was young. Moreover, the other side was a low level disciple who didn't even reach his thigh. He was immediately embarrassed and angry. He angrily said, \"You dare to talk to me like this? Do you know who I am?\"Chu Wanning faintly glanced at him. \"Who are you?\"\"\u2026 I am the young master of the Peak of Life and Death.\" Xue Meng was simply about to suffocate. \"You don't even know this?\"Chu Wan-ning smiled faintly. That smile would have looked very mocking on his original face, but on his current childish and cute face, it was even more mocking.\"You're just a young master, not a master.Why do you have to know? \"\"You, you, you, you, what did you say?\"\"Put down your arrogance and properly practice your blade.\"After Chu Wanning said this, he lowered his long eyelashes and slowly blew on the bamboo leaves. The slow melody was like cotton fluttering in the wind, tossing and turning.Xue Meng was really about to be angered to death. He let out a loud cry and actually got into a fight with a child.But no matter how angry he was, he didn't want to hit a child. He could only soar into the air and slash at the trees. In a split second, the trees were cut down, and in the midst of this ethereal song, he displayed a ruthless and dangerous blade technique.His blade was fast and fierce. In the flash of the blade, dozens of bamboo shoots were cut into blunt thorns.If it was used to attack an enemy, these blunt thorns would be like sharp needles that could cut through hair. But to teach his own sect's younger generation disciple, he didn't have to go too far.Hundreds of blunt thorns fell straight towards Chu Wanning. Seeing that they were about to hurt him, Xue Meng quickly jumped and prepared to use his qinggong to bring this ignorant disciple away.He didn't really want to hurt this child, he just wanted to scare him.Unexpectedly, at the same time he flew down, the child stopped playing and flicked the tender green bamboo leaves at his fingertips. The thin bamboo leaves instantly shattered into hundreds of thin strands at his fingertips.Almost in an instant, the hundreds of thin strands accurately attacked the blunt thorns that were falling down.The wind seemed to have frozen.Chu Wanning stood up. At the same time, the hundreds of blunt thorns around him turned into fine powder in a split second.Turned into ashes!Xue Meng was stunned. He stood in place, his face alternating between green and red. He couldn't say a single word.The childish child in front of him rustled his eyelashes, his silver-blue disciple robes fluttering. He smiled at Xue Meng, \"Again?\"Xue Meng, \"\u2026 \u2026\"\"The blade is swift and fierce, but it has no rhythm.It's too impulsive. \"Xue Meng opened his mouth, then closed it again.Chu Wanning said, \"Let's start from the Spirit Sparrow Style again. Dance according to my tune again. I'll play a section, and you'll finish the style. Don't go any faster.\"Being instructed by a child like this, Xue Meng's expression became even uglier. He bit his lip and didn't move. Chu Wanning didn't rush him, he just waited on the side. He wanted to see if Xue Meng would be able to put down his pride for the sake of cultivation and rather listen to the words of a child.After waiting for a while, Xue Meng suddenly stomped his feet in frustration. He threw his sword and turned to leave.Chu Wanning saw him leave in a huff, his expression slightly gloomy.He thought, it's a pity that Xue Meng can't learn humbly like this \u2026 \u2026But before he finished thinking, he saw him pick up a branch from the ground, turn around, and say in a bad tone, \"Then, then I'll use a branch, in case I hit you.\"Chu Wanning paused, a smile on his lips. He nodded and said, \"Okay.\"Xue Meng picked a bamboo leaf for him, wiped it clean, and handed it to him. \"Here, little brother, this is for you.\"Just like this, he became a \"child\" and a \"little brother\"?Chu Wanning looked at him in amusement. He took the leaf, sat back down on the rock, and slowly blew.Xue Meng had an impatient personality. In this blade style, there was a sweeping move in the air. When he turned around in the air, he had to stab six times in a row and then slash once.However, Xue Meng couldn't grasp the speed. Often, he would stab ten times in a row before he struck, and that strike had already missed the best time.After five or six times, Xue Meng couldn't get it right. The more anxious he became, the tighter his brows became.Just as he was anxious, he glanced to the side and saw the child sitting on the rock playing the bamboo leaf. He saw that although the child was young, he was calm and didn't complain at all. He couldn't help but feel ashamed.Thus, he pulled himself together and practiced a few more times. Gradually, he found some feeling in the music.Xue Meng, however, was not happy. He continued to leap and stab. When the moon was high in the sky, it was already late. He was finally able to perform this part of the saber technique without any mistakes.Sweat condensed between his dark eyebrows. Xue Meng wiped it with a handkerchief and said happily, \"Today, it's all thanks to you.Little brother, which elder's disciple are you?You're so strong. Why haven't I heard of you before? \"Chu Wanning had already thought about it. Elder Xuanji had many disciples, so many that even he couldn't remember all of them. Thus, he put away the bamboo leaf and smiled slightly. \"I am Elder Xuanji's disciple.\"Xue Meng seemed to be quite disdainful of Xuanji. He snorted and said, \"Oh, that Trash King.\"\"Trash King?\"\"Ah, sorry.\"Xue Meng misunderstood the surprise in Chu Wanning's eyes. He thought that it was because he looked down on this child's master and made him unhappy.He smiled and said, \"It's just a nickname in private.Your master has taken in too many disciples. He doesn't refuse anyone.Trash refers to the disciples he has taken in who have no talent. It's not that Elder Xuanji isn't good. Little brother, don't take it to heart. \"Chu Wanning said, \"\u2026 Do you often give Elders nicknames in private?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Of course, all nicknames have to be given. Who will the heavens spare?\"Xue Meng seemed to be in high spirits as he enthusiastically introduced Chu Wanning, \"You don't look very old, probably not more than five years old, right?You've just arrived at the Peak of Life and Death, so you're not familiar with everyone. Once you're familiar with them, you'll know that most of the twenty elders here have nicknames among the disciples. \"\"Oh.\" Chu Wanning looked at him meaningfully, \"For example?\"\"That's a lot to say.But it's getting late, and I'm a bit hungry.Thank you for your advice today, I'll bring you down the mountain for supper. We'll talk while we eat. \"Chu Wanning lowered his head and thought for a while, then smiled, \"En, sure.\"Xue Meng put away Dragon's Den and held Chu Wanning's hand. The ignorant disciple and the shrunken master walked along the long bamboo stone steps towards the mountain gate.\"Little brother, what's your name?\" Xue Meng asked as they walked.Chu Wanning calmly replied, \"My surname is Xia.\"\"Xia what?\"\"Xia Si Ni.\"Xue Meng didn't seem to understand the meaning behind it, and even asked happily, \"Not bad, it sounds pretty good.Which two words are they? \"Chu Wanning glanced at him as if he was looking at an idiot, \"\u2026 Si as in Situ, Ni as in rebellious disciple.Xia Si Ni. \"\"Oh, oh.\" Xue Meng smiled and asked again, \"Then how old are you this year?I guessed correctly before, right? You're not more than five years old, right? \"\"\u2026\" Chu Wanning's face darkened. Luckily, Xue Meng was looking at the road and didn't look at his expression, otherwise he would have been frightened, \"No, Young Master guessed wrong.\u2026 I'm six years old this year. \"Xue Meng said, \"Then you're really talented, although you're still a bit lacking compared to me when I was young.However, with a little bit of training, he would definitely be an outstanding junior.How about this? You don't have to study under Xuanji. Call me Senior Brother, and I'll ask my Master to accept you as his disciple. What do you think? \"Chu Wanning tried his best not to roll his eyes. \"What do you want me to call you?\"\"Senior Brother,\" Xue Meng bent down with a smile and flicked Chu Wanning's forehead. \"Not everyone has this opportunity.\"Chu Wanning had a complicated expression on his face. \"\u2026\"\"What's wrong? Too happy to speak?\"Chu Wanning: \"\u2026\"The two of them were talking and laughing as they walked. At least, Xue Meng thought that they were \"talking and laughing\" as they walked.Suddenly, a voice came from behind, ending this conversation that might have taken Xue Meng's life if it continued.\"Hmm?Mengmeng, why are you here? \"In the entire Pinnacle of Life and Death, who else would call Xue Meng Mengmeng Meng Meng Meng?Xue Meng didn't even turn her head, but her mouth was already cursing.\"Mo Ran, you dog, if you call me that again, I'll pull out your tongue.\"When he turned around, Mo Ran was indeed standing under the bright moon, his clothes fluttering in the wind. He grinned at the two of them.He originally wanted to tease Xue Meng a bit more, but he suddenly noticed that there was a delicate and pretty child standing beside Xue Meng. He couldn't help but be stunned. \"This is \u2026\"Xue Meng pulled Chu Wanning behind him and glared at Mo Ran. \"Why do you care?\"\"Don't, don't, don't hide him.\"Mo Ran grabbed Xue Meng's hand and pulled Chu Wanning out. He squatted down and carefully examined him. Suddenly, he muttered, \"This child looks very familiar.\"Chu Wanning became vigilant. \"\u2026 \u2026\"\"I feel like I've seen him somewhere before.\"Chu Wanning knew that this was bad. If his identity was exposed, how could he face others in the future?Thinking of this, he subconsciously took a step back and turned around to escape.\"Don't go!\"Mo Ran pulled him back with an evil smile. He extended a finger and stroked Chu Wanning's nose. He slowly said, \"Come, little brother, tell big brother what your name is.\"Her nose, which had been touched by him, felt greasy. Chu Wanning was both embarrassed and guilty, so she stepped back.Mo Ran thought that he was scared, so he laughed and said, \"Why are you hiding? Be good, tell big brother, is your surname Xue?\"Xue Meng: \"???\"Mo Ran pointed at Xue Meng and asked Chu Wanning with a smile, \"This person, is he your father?You have to tell me the truth. That way, big brother will dote on you and buy candy for you. \"\"Are you crazy, Mo Weiyu!!\"Xue Meng instantly exploded. Her face flushed red, and she shouted with her hair standing on end, \"You, you, you, what exactly are you thinking?You, you're dirty!You, you're dirty!You, you, you're shameless! \"Chu Wanning was also speechless, but he felt a little relieved. \"\u2026 \u2026 My surname is Xia. I'm Xuanji's disciple, Xia Si Ni.\"\"Scare you to death?\"Mo Ran's eyes curved into crescents. He was not stupid and immediately understood the meaning of the name. \"Haha, interesting.\"\"\u2026\"\"You're crazy!\"Xue Meng pushed Mo Ran away fiercely and said angrily, \"He's my new friend. He has nothing to do with you.We're going to have supper. Get out of my way. \"\"Oh.\" Mo Ran stepped aside.But soon, he put his hands behind his head and followed them with a smile on his face.Xue Meng growled at him, \"What are you doing?\"\"I'm going down the mountain for supper too,\" Mo Ran said innocently. \"Am I not allowed to?\"Xue Meng: \"\u2026\"Wuchang Town.Since the Peak of Life and Death was established, this town, which used to be haunted by ghosts, gradually returned to its former peace. Now, it was even a little lively.At this time, the night market was open. Xue Meng and the others walked among the stalls and found a shop that sold antique soup. They sat in front of a short wooden table in the open air.\"Antique soup\" used a copper cauldron as cooking utensils and was placed on a burning charcoal basin.When eating, the fire was not extinguished and the soup in the cauldron was boiled. The soup was usually spicy and spicy. Fresh ingredients were placed all over the table. Whatever one wanted to eat, one could throw it in.Because the food would make a \"gulp\" sound when it was dropped into the boiling water, it was called antique soup.This was a famous dish in Sichuan, but Chu Wanning only ate clear soup without spicy food. He didn't eat spicy food because he choked when he ate it.Xue Meng was born in Sichuan, and Mo Ran grew up in the Xiangtan area. Both of them were accustomed to spicy food. Naturally, they thought that \"Xia Si Ni\" could eat spicy food.When they sat down to order, Xue Meng ordered a few dishes with familiarity and said, \"Put more pepper in the soup, and don't use enough chili oil.\"Chu Wanning suddenly pulled his sleeve and said faintly, \"I want the Mandarin Duck Pot.\"\"What?\" Xue Meng thought he heard wrong.Chu Wanning said with a black face, \"I want the Mandarin Duck Pot, half spicy and half not spicy.\"Xue Meng: \"\u2026 You're not from Sichuan?\"\"Yes.\"\"Ah.\"Xue Meng nodded and showed a look of understanding, but he was also a little surprised. He looked at Chu Wanning and said, \"You're so young, but you're so far away from your hometown. It's really \u2026 Alas, forget it.\" He sighed and turned to the waiter, \"Well, the Mandarin Duck Pot it is.\"Chu Wanning didn't know why he heard a trace of unwillingness in Xue Meng's tone.Then he found that this was not his illusion. Xue Meng was really a little unwilling. When he was waiting for the dishes, he said, \"Shidi, since you're in Sichuan, you have to learn to eat spicy food.If you don't eat spicy food, you can't be close to others, do you know?You can not speak Sichuan dialect, but you can't not eat spicy food.By the way, where are you from? \"Chu Wanning said, \"Lin 'an.\"\"Oh.\"Xue Meng thought for a while and felt that he was not familiar with the Jiangnan water town, so he bit his chopsticks and asked, \"Then in your hometown, do you eat rabbit heads?\"Before Chu Wanning could answer, Mo Ran said with a smile, \"Of course not.\"Xue Meng stared at him, and Chu Wanning also looked at him.Mo Ran put one foot on the bench, put his elbow on his knee, and fluently turned the chopsticks in his hand. Seeing this, he tilted his head and smiled, \"What's wrong?Looking at me like that, you don't want to eat. \"Xue Meng turned his head and asked Chu Wanning, \"Are you sure you don't want to eat?\"\"Yes.\"Xue Meng stared at Mo Ran again. \"How do you know?Have you been to Lin 'an? \"\"No, I haven't.\"Mo Ran made a face. \"But Brother Xia and our Shizun are from the same hometown. Don't you know that Shizun doesn't eat rabbit heads?When he takes cold dishes in the Meng Po Lobby, he either uses shallots mixed with tofu or osmanthus and sugar-lotus root. If you don't believe me, you can pay attention next time. \"Chu Wanning, \"\u2026 \u2026\"\"Ah, I haven't paid attention. Ever since I saw Shizun's breakfast last time, I don't dare to look at his plate. It's really scary.\"Xue Meng rubbed his chin and slowly revealed a disgusted expression. \"Shizun's taste is really hard to describe.Did you know?He actually eats salted tofu pudding. \"Chu Wanning, \"\u2026 \u2026\"As he spoke, Xue Meng turned his head and looked at him. He said earnestly, \"Little Shidi, you must not learn from Elder Yu Heng. In the future, no one will be willing to eat with you.Remember, you must eat both rabbit heads and chili. When you eat tofu pudding in the morning, you must not pour sauce into it. \"\"And seaweed and dried shrimps,\" Mo Ran added.\"Yes, seaweed and dried shrimps too.\" Xue Meng and Mo Ran shared a common enemy. It was rare that Xue Meng and Mo Ran shared a common enemy. \"I can't stand it.\"Chu Wanning looked at the two idiots and said expressionlessly, \"Oh.\"The dishes were quickly served. The frozen bamboo shoots were fresh and crispy, the green vegetables were green, the tofu was sparkling, the fish was tender, and the lamb slices were rolled up into thin rolls. They were neatly arranged on white porcelain plates. The crispy meat was golden brown and crispy, sprinkled with cumin and pepper. A pot of freshly ground soy milk was placed next to the table, causing the small table to creak under the pressure.Friendship was a matter of eating one meal at a time, not to mention the hot antique soup. After two or three rounds of lamb slices and one or two cups of soy milk, even the cold feelings between Xue Meng and Mo Ran couldn't help but temporarily warm up in the dense steam.Xue Meng's chopsticks rummaged in the spicy oil soup. \"Hey, hey, where's the brain I threw in?\"\"Isn't your brain resting on your neck?\" Mo Ran laughed.\"I'm talking about pig's brain!\"Mo Ran bit his chopsticks and laughed evilly. \"Yes, I'm talking about pig's brain too.\"\"Son of a dog, how dare you scold me \u2014 \u2014\"\"Hey!Your brain floated up!Eat, eat! \"Xue Meng was excited and fell into his trap. He shouted, \"Take your dog's paw away!Don't fight with me, this is my brain! \"Chu Wanning sat on a small stool, holding a porcelain pot of sweet soy milk. He drank happily while leisurely looking at the two childish people beside him.He was not in a hurry. In any case, half of the clear soup pot was his.After drinking the soy milk, the child licked his lips as if he had not had enough. Mo Ran saw this and asked him with a smile, \"Little Shidi likes this?\"Chu Wanning digested the title of \"Little Shidi\" and silently calculated the possibility of getting rid of this title. He found that it was almost impossible, so he could only say dryly.\"En, it's not bad.\"Mo Ran then turned his head and said, \"Waiter, this soy milk, give my shidi another pot.\"Chu Wanning then drank the second pot with satisfaction.He was born with a sweet tooth, but because he ate too many pastries before, he developed tooth decay. Elder Tanlang had to spend a lot of effort to fix it for him.After that, Chu Wanning did not eat much because of his face.Now that he had turned into a child, it was convenient for him to eat desserts.Mo Ran watched him eat and said, \"Your taste is very similar to Shizun's.\"Chu Wanning choked, but his face was still very calm. He said without batting an eyelid, \"\u2026 Shidi is talking about Elder Yu Heng?\"\"Yes.\"Mo Ran nodded with a smile and pushed a steamer to Chu Wanning. \"Come and try this.I think you will like it too. \"Chu Wanning picked up the leaf in the steamer and took a small bite. The soft white skin revealed a hole, and the steaming hot bean paste filling was soft and sweet.\"Is it good?\"Chu Wanning took another bite and nodded. \"En.\"Mo Ran smiled and said, \"Then eat more.\"The three of them chatted while eating. Chu Wanning suddenly remembered the previous topic. He pretended not to care. After eating the fourth leaf, he asked Xue Meng, \"Young Master, you told me before on the mountain that every elder has a nickname. Since my shizun, Elder Xuanji, is called the King of Junk, then what is Elder Yu Heng's nickname?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Shizun?\"Xue Meng's expression instantly turned solemn. \"He's the only one who doesn't have a nickname. In the entire Peak of Life and Death, no one dares to make fun of him.\"\"Nonsense. That's just because other people know you like Shizun and don't want to tell you the truth.\"Mo Ran rolled his eyes. He pulled Chu Wanning over and whispered in a not so soft voice, \"Don't listen to him. Let me tell you, in the entire Peak of Life and Death, the one with the most nicknames is Elder Yu Heng.\"\"Oh?Is that so? \"Chu Wanning slightly raised his eyebrows, appearing interested.\" For example? \"\"For example, if you're more polite, you can call him White Impermanence.\"\"\u2026 Why do you call him that?\"\"Because he wears white clothes all day long.\"\"\u2026 What else?\"\"Little cabbage.\"\"\u2026 Why?\"\"Because he wears white clothes all day long.\"\"What else?\"\"Big steamed bun.\"\"Why?\"\"Because he wears white clothes all day long.\"\"What else?\"\"Little widow.\"Chu Wanning: \"???\"\"Do you know why that is?\"Mo Ran was completely unaware of the murderous intent that flashed through Chu Wanning's eyes. He even laughed foolishly. \"Because he wears white clothes all day long.\"\"\u2026\"If it weren't for Chu Wanning's good self-control, he probably wouldn't have been able to hold it in. \"And, and?\"\"Aiyo.\"Mo Ran looked at Xue Meng's expression and said in a low voice, \"If I say more, my cousin will probably flip the pot over my head.\"Xue Meng slammed the table and said through gritted teeth, \"Outrageous!Who allowed them to talk about Shizun like this?What little cabbage and big steamed bun, there's even a little widow?Are they tired of living? \"\"Ah.\" Mo Ran couldn't help but laugh. \"You're unhappy with this?Why don't you hear what some female disciples call Shizun? It's so mushy. \"Xue Meng's eyes widened. \"What did they say?\"Mo Ran said lazily, \"What else can I say? Girls always speak in a genteel manner, such as' Pale Moon Pear Blossom ',' Bright Spring White Snow ',' Lin 'an Chu Lang', 'Xi Zi Fu Qian'.Oh my god. \"Chu Wanning: \"\u2026\"Xue Meng: \"\u2026\"\"That's considered good. For someone like Elder Tanlang, who has a mediocre appearance and a bad temper, his nickname is much worse.\"Among the twenty elders, Elder Tanlang had the worst relationship with Chu Wanning. Chu Wanning asked, \"What's his name?\"\"Winter pickles or potherb mustard because it's dark,\" Mo Ran said with a smile. \"Mengmeng, don't look at me like that. You're part of it too.\"Xue Meng seemed to have swallowed an egg. \"What?I have one too? \"\"That's right,\" Mo Ran said with a smile.Xue Meng didn't seem to care. He cleared his throat and asked, \"Then what did they call me?\"\"Ping Ping.\"\"\u2026 What do you mean?\"\"What do you mean 'what do you mean'? Isn't that easy?\"Mo Ran's shoulders twitched as he said these three words. He finally couldn't help but slap the table and laugh. \"A peacock spreading its tail, hahahaha \u2014 \u2014\"Xue Meng jumped up and said angrily, \"Mo Ran!I'll kill you! \"When the three of them returned to the Peak of Life and Death after eating their fill, it was already one o 'clock in the afternoon.Chu Wanning first let his two foolish disciples send him to Elder Xuanji's territory and bid them farewell.Xue Meng asked him to meet again tomorrow at the bamboo forest, but Chu Wanning didn't know when he would return to his original appearance, so he didn't dare to agree. He only said that he would come if he had the time.When his disciples were far away, he used his qinggong and stepped on the roof beams to return to the Red Lotus Pavilion.The next morning, Chu Wanning woke up and saw that he still had the body of a child. He couldn't help but feel depressed.He stood on the bench with a straight face and stared at the person in the bronze mirror for a long time. He didn't even have the mood to comb his hair. After thinking about it, he felt that he couldn't continue like this, so he went to find Xue Zhengyong.\"What?You saw Meng 'er and Ran' er yesterday? \"\"Yes, I said that I was Xuanji's disciple. They didn't suspect anything,\" Chu Wanning said. \"If Xue Meng asks you about it, remember to help me smooth things over.Let's not talk about this first. I've already cultivated for more than ten days, but I haven't gotten any better.I can't go on like this, I have to go find Tanlang. \"\"Aiyo, our Yuheng is so thin-skinned. Aren't you afraid of embarrassing yourself today?\"Chu Wanning looked at him coldly. However, when this gaze was placed on a child, it was unavoidably weak. It was a bit like a child throwing a tantrum.He was beautiful and cute when he was young. Xue Zhengyong couldn't help but feel a little touched. He reached out to touch Chu Wanning's head.Chu Wanning suddenly said, \"Great Lord, when my body recovers, I'll have to trouble you to ask Huan Sha Hall to make me a set of clothes for the pinnacle of life and death.I don't want white. \"Xue Zhengyong was completely stunned. \"I thought you didn't like to wear light armor?\"\"I'll change it occasionally.\" Chu Wanning said with a dark expression and walked away.Although Elder Tanlang didn't get along with Chu Wanning, he had to restrain himself a little because the Great Lord was here. Thus, he didn't mock Chu Wanning with his mouth. Everything was written in his eyes.Chu Wanning raised his eyes and looked expressionlessly at Elder Tanlang.The other's eyes lit up like fireworks.Chu Wanning was speechless.\"Madam Wang's diagnosis is generally correct.\"After Elder Tanlang finished reading Chu Wanning's pulse, he let go of Chu Wanning's wrist. Chu Wanning immediately pulled his hand away and rolled down his sleeve.\"Then why haven't you recovered after ten days?\"Tanlang said, \"Although the amount of sap from the ancient sacred wood is small, its effects are strong.I'm afraid it will take a long time for you to recover. \"Chu Wanning asked casually, \"How long?\"Tanlang said, \"I'm not sure, but about ten years.\"Chu Wanning's eyes widened. Although Elder Tanlang tried to keep a straight face, the gloating smile in his eyes was almost overflowing. \"That's right, you might need ten years to recover your original appearance.\"Chu Wanning stared at him for a while and said coldly, \"Are you trying to trick me?\"\"I wouldn't dare, you're Elder Yu Heng.\"Tanlang laughed. \"I don't think it's a big deal. It's just that your body is smaller and your mind is a little childish, but it's negligible. Besides, your magic power is still there. Why are you in such a hurry to recover?\"Chu Wanning's face turned green. He was speechless for a moment.Tanlang said, \"But in these ten years, you won't always look like a child.This kind of fluid flows in the same vein as your spiritual power.If you don't use any spells for three to five months, you'll return to your original appearance. \"\"That's a good idea!\" Xue Zhengyong's eyes lit up.Unexpectedly, Tanlang smiled and said, \"Why are you in such a hurry, Great Lord?I haven't even finished my sentence.After Elder Yu Heng recovers his original appearance, he still can't use too many spells. Once he uses too much of his spiritual power, he'll be controlled by the sap and turn back into a child. \"\"Too much?What do you mean too much? \"Xue Zhengyong shouted.\"Well, the sap has already spread all over his body.\" Tanlang said, \"He can only use two moves a day at most.\"Chu Wanning's voice was as cold as steel. He said, \"The Ghost World's enchantment is often flawed. Refining a Spirit Mech also requires spells. If I can only use two moves a day at most, won't I become a useless person?\"\"Then I can't do anything.\"Tanlang said sarcastically, \"After all, if the human world loses the Northern Dipper Celestial Venerable, the sun may not rise again tomorrow.\"Xue Zhengyong said anxiously, \"Tanlang, don't be so sarcastic.In the entire Cultivation World, your medical skills are one of the best. Quickly think of a way.Although Yu Heng's magic power is not affected, he's still a child after all. His skills are definitely not as good as before.Besides, if the other sects know that he was injured at the Jincheng Pond, who knows what they'll do.Ten years is too long. See if there's any good medicine that can \u2026 \"Elder Tan Lang interrupted him mockingly, \"My Lord, I'm not going to give you a chance.The Northern Dipper Celestial Venerable was contaminated with the sap of an ancient divine tree. It's not just any common poison.What do you think I can come up with in such a short time? \"Xue Zhengyong, \"\u2026\"\"Alright, I'm going to refine the pills.\" Tanlang said slowly, \"Both of you, please go back.\"Xue Zhengyong, \"Tanlang!\" He still wanted to say something, but Chu Wanning pulled on his clothes and said, \"My Lord, let's go.\"The two of them walked to the door, but Tanlang's voice suddenly came from behind them.\"Chu Wanning, if you're willing to humbly beg me, maybe I'll be willing to help you make the medicine.Although I've never seen your situation before, it's not impossible. Why don't you think about it? \"\"\u2026\" Chu Wanning turned around and said, \"What do you want to be considered as humbly?\"Tanlang was lying on the bed, lazily arranging the silver needles on the table. When he heard this, he looked up slightly, and his eyes flashed with mockery. \"When other people are cornered, they kowtow and ask for help.You and I are colleagues, so there's no need for kowtowing. If you kneel and say a few words to me, I'll help you. \"Chu Wanning did not say anything and looked at him coldly.After a while, he said, \"Winter pickles. I think you're still asleep.\"When he finished speaking, he flicked his sleeves and left.Tanlang was left alone in a daze. For a long time, he did not understand what winter pickles meant.The days passed slowly. Elder Yuheng said that he was in seclusion, but in reality, he was trapped in the child's body and could not come out.This matter was first known by Xue Zhengyong, Madam Wang, and Elder Tanlang. Later, in order not to expose themselves, Elder Xuanji also heard of this strange matter.A few months passed in a flash. The Red Lotus Pavilion had been closed for a long time. Xue Meng and the others could not help but worry.\"Master has been in seclusion for more than seventy days. Why hasn't he come out yet?\"\"Maybe his spiritual power is about to improve again.\"Shi Mei drank the Ling Mountain Rain Dew in his teacup and looked at the cloudy sky outside the window. \"It's going to snow. It's going to be Little Winter soon. I don't know if Master can come out before New Year's Eve.\"Mo Ran was lazily flipping through the sword manual. Hearing this, he said, \"I don't think he can come out. A few days ago, he used the begonia flower to send us a message. Didn't he say that there was still a long time?I think it's quite mysterious. \"Today was a free day at the peak of life and death. The disciples did not need to cultivate.Mo Ran and the other two gathered together to make tea and wine. The bamboo curtains in the pavilion in the small courtyard were half drawn. Under the heavy curtains, misty water vapor leaked out.Recently, there was an additional disciple under Elder Xuanji, Xia Sini, who often hung out with them.Ever since he met Xue Meng that day, Xue Meng would pull him over to cultivate and play with him. After a long time, he was even more inseparable from them.Originally, there were three disciples under Yu Heng. Now, there was an additional little one.At this time, Chu Wanning, who had changed his name to Xia Sini, was sitting at the table eating pastries.Although he ate in a refined manner, his speed was not slow at all.Xue Meng inadvertently glanced at him and stilled. His gaze returned to the plate and he said in shock, \"Wa, Little Shidi, who did you inherit your appetite from?\"Chu Wanning slowly chewed the osmanthus cake. The cake was too delicious. He did not want to pay attention to Xue Meng at all. After all, someone was fighting with him for food.Mo Ran's hand and Chu Wanning's hand landed on the last piece of lotus flower cake at the same time. The two suddenly looked up and their eyes met.Chu Wanning said, \"Let go.\"Mo Ran said, \"No.\"\"Let go.\"\"You've eaten eight pieces. This one is mine.\"\"I can give you the rest, but not the lotus flower cake.\"Mo Ran glared at this little guy for a while and used his trump card, \"Shidi, you eat too much sweets. You'll have tooth decay.\"\"It's okay.\" Chu Wanning was very calm, \"I'm six years old. It's not embarrassing.\"Mo Ran: \"\u2026\"With a smack, Xue Meng slapped him across the face, accompanied by his complaints, \"Mo Weiyu, you're so annoying. You're already so old, yet you're still fighting with your junior brother for food.\"While Mo Ran was covering his head with his hands, Chu Wanning expressionlessly grabbed the Lotus Cake and took a small bite with satisfaction.\"Junior Brother!!!\"Chu Wanning ignored him and focused on eating the dessert.The four of them were having a lively time when suddenly, a sharp whistling sound pierced through the sky and reverberated throughout the peak of life and death.Chu Wanning's expression darkened slightly. \"Gather sentries?\"Xue Meng lifted half of the curtain and looked out of the window. The disciples walking outside also stopped to look, and they all revealed surprised expressions.Once the whistle sounded, all the disciples of the Life and Death Summit had to gather in the square outside of the Danqing Palace.This also meant that the whistle would only sound when there was an emergency.Before Chu Wanning joined the sect, this kind of whistle was often blown when the boundary of the Ghost World was broken. However, ever since Chu Wanning joined the sect, the whistle had not sounded for a long time.Shi Mei put down the scroll in his hand, got up and walked to Xue Meng, \"It's so strange. What's so urgent?\"\"I don't know. Whatever, let's go take a look first.\"Only Mo Ran did not speak. He pursed his lips and lowered his eyelashes to hide the unnaturalness in his eyes.He knew what the whistle meant, but the timing of the incident was slightly different from what he remembered. He did not expect it to come so soon \u2026The four of them arrived at the Life and Death Summit, and the other disciples also arrived one after another. Soon, all the elders and disciples gathered in the huge square of the Dan Xin Palace.When everyone was present, Xue Zhengyong walked out of the closed door of the Dan Xin Palace and stood in front of the jade railing. Below the railing was a long bluestone staircase.Following behind him were six beautiful women.The six women's appearances were either charming or cold, but they were all extremely beautiful. They stood in the wind, but in the cold weather, they only wore a thin layer of gauze. At first glance, their red dresses were like clouds, their eyes were like red flames, and their silk ribbons fluttered in the wind. There was also a trace of a flame between their eyebrows.Xue Meng was stunned.Not only him, but almost everyone's expression changed dramatically when they saw the six women.Xue Meng was stunned for a long time before he murmured with a trembling voice, \"Featherman Immortal Ambassadors \u2026 They, they are from the Vermilion Bird Fairyland?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAlthough the Vermilion Bird Wonderland was called a wonderland, the people who lived there were not immortals. Instead, they were half-immortal, half-demon mutants.They were the beings most similar to immortals in the Cultivation Continent, and were also called \"feathermen\".The feathermen lived in the maze of Mount Jiuhua for generations. They had their own paradise and rarely interfered with the affairs of the mortal world.However, not all of their blood was immortal blood, and half of them were mortal flesh and blood. Thus, they could not completely transcend. They would often appear when the order of the Cultivation World was in turmoil, and when it was in danger, they would use their powerful spiritual energy to help the mortals get through difficult times.When Mo Ran caused a huge commotion in his previous life, the feathermen appeared in large numbers.However, in the end, their strength was still no match for the Sovereign of the Human Realm who had cultivated the forbidden technique to perfection. In the end, all the feathermen were killed by Mo Ran. He stepped on the stinking blood and stepped on the charred feathers that were scattered all over the ground.With a fire, the Vermilion Bird Wonderland was destroyed.That was an extremely crazy memory. Even after the incident, Mo Ran would still break out in cold sweat when he thought about it, drenching his vest.He felt as if he was possessed by an evil spirit. It was extremely cruel.However, right now, he obviously did not have the strength to fight against the feathermen.In fact, because of their racial advantage, the spiritual energy of most immortal cultivators was below that of the feathermen. In the entire Peak of Life and Death, the only ones who could fight against them were probably those few outstanding elders.Xue Meng accidentally saw Mo Ran's face and was shocked: \"What happened to you?Why is your face so pale? \"\"It's nothing.\" Mo Ran's eyelashes fluttered as he said in a low voice, \"I just ran a little too fast.\"The appearance of the feathermen was the beginning of Shi Mei's tragedy in his previous life. Mo Ran's heart was in his throat. He originally thought that this matter would only happen after some time. Why was it that in this life, so many things were progressing differently from the past?At the Peak of Life and Death in the winter, a weak sun hung in the sky, illuminating a layer of deathly white light.Mo Ran stood under the sun, and could not help but hold Shi Mei's hand.Shi Mei was slightly stunned. \"What's wrong?\"\"\u2026\" Mo Ran didn't say anything and just shook his head.Xue Zhengyong's voice sounded at the right time. What he said was not much different from what he said in his previous life.\"Today, I've summoned all of you in front of the Core Heart Palace because the Featherman Immortal Emissary has returned after more than eighty years.Just like eighty years ago, the Immortal Emissary left the Peach Blossom Spring and came to the mortal world because he saw that the mortal world was in danger and came to help. \"He paused for a moment and slowly turned his head to look at the dense crowd of disciples below.\"You all know that although the barrier of the Ghost Domain was set up by Incipient God Fuxi, it's still there.However, over the past million years, the barrier had gradually weakened. Every few decades, the barrier would be damaged again.Over the years, the power of the Ghost Realm's barrier has been weakening day by day, even with the help of all of you \u2014 \"Xue Meng humphed softly, \"Father is really spouting nonsense. It's clearly Shizun who's helping us all by herself.\"\"Even with the help of all of you, the loophole in the Ghost Realm is getting bigger and bigger. In the end, it will completely collapse like it did a few decades ago.At that time, thousands of spirits will descend and hundreds of ghosts will invade the world. The boundary between the mortal world and the Ghost Realm will be broken and the mortals will suffer.In order to avoid such a tragedy, the Featherman Immortal Emissary will select a few people with the most suitable spiritual power from all the cultivation sects and send them to the Peach Blossom Spring to cultivate in isolation. \"As soon as this was said, everyone was in an uproar.The Featherman was going to select people and bring them to the Peach Blossom Spring to cultivate?!All the disciples were surprised, but they were also excited. No matter how talented they were, they were more or less secretly looking forward to it.Only Mo Ran didn't look happy. There was even a faint trace of worry on his face.He was good at pretending and making people unable to distinguish the truth from the lies. However, at this moment, he couldn't hide the emotions in his heart.This matter was related to Shi Mei's life and death.In the past, Shi Mei was selected by the Featherman to go to the Peach Blossom Spring to cultivate.Not long after he returned, there was a large-scale collapse in the Ghost Realm's loophole. A large number of ghosts crawled from hell to the mortal world.During that catastrophe, Shi Mei and Chu Wanning fought side by side. Each of them stood at the foot of the formation and worked together to repair the biggest loophole.However, Shi Mei's power was still not on par with Chu Wanning. Countless ghosts saw that the Yang World was about to be closed, so they attacked Shi Mei together with a common enemy. Thousands of soldiers and horses turned into a murderous aura. In an instant, they pierced through Shi Mei who was trying to maintain the balance of the enchantment!The evil spirits killed the heart, the dead souls pierced through the soul.Chu Wanning didn't raise his hand to block them. When Shi Mei fell from the top of the Coiling Dragon Pillar, he chose to use all of his magic to seal the enchantment that Shi Mei didn't have time to complete with his own power!It was snowing heavily that day. Shi Mei fell from the high platform like an inconspicuous small piece among the thousands of sparkling and translucent crystals.The sky was full of snow, endless.So who would care about which hexagonal ice crystal was about to melt? Just like the countless generations of mortals, who would care about the death of an ordinary person except for their closest relatives.In the heavy snow, in the smoke of war, Mo Ran held Shi Mei whose breathing was gradually weakening. He knelt and begged Chu Wanning to take a look at Shi Mei and save Shi Mei.But in the end, Chu Wanning still turned around and chose to throw himself to the snowy plains. He chose to fulfill his own righteousness. So the master-disciple relationship was destroyed.How ridiculous.The things that Chu Wanning liked, cared about, and pursued were all so ridiculous.For example, Chu Wanning liked listening to the rain and admiring the lotus. He liked Engineer Du's poems. He was so strict to the point that he was in fear and trepidation.For example, Chu Wanning did not care if spring grass lived or autumn cicada died. He did not care if there was smoke of war or where the common people could not live.For example, Chu Wanning had always taught them that if there was a Dao, then all living things would be the leader.But Mo Ran thought, fuck all living things!He did not know those people and did not care. What did it matter to him whether they were dead or alive?In Chu Wanning's rain, perhaps there were the murmurs of desolate souls who had nowhere to return to, or the tears of the refugees splashed on the grass and trees. He, Mo Ran, did not feel it.His rain was just ordinary rain. The grass and trees were just ordinary grass and trees.The common people were just two words written on paper. Who the hell cared.So he thought, Chu Wanning was hypocritical, despicable, full of benevolence, righteousness, and morality, as if he had the whole world in his heart. But in his extremely narrow heart, he was even stingy with the position of his disciple.Later on, he asked Chu Wanning, \"Does your heart ache?Do you feel uneasy?You said that the leader of all living things would be the end, but you are still alive. You let Shi Mei listen to you and die!You killed him, you hypocrite, you liar!Do you still have a heart?When Shi Mei fell from the high platform, he was shouting for you. He was shouting for Shizun. Did you hear that?Did you hear that?Why didn't you save him \u2026 Why didn't you save him!!Chu Wanning, your heart is made of stone.You have never \u2026Never cared about us.You did not care \u2026 You did not care \u2026What happened after that was just like that.Chu Wanning became the uncrowned king who was respected and loved by everyone in the Xiuzhen world. Nobody cared about the dead. Shi Mei's bones were like a stone step not worth mentioning, stepped under the feet of the victor.He used a disciple with insufficient talent in exchange for the so-called peace of the world.Nobody would say that he was wrong.Only Mo Ran saw the crown on his forehead. It was so glorious that it was made of the bones of the dead. It was Shi Mei's death that made him who he was.He hated it from the bottom of his heart.\"Hey, little immortal.\"\"Hey \u2014\"Suddenly, a gentle hand touched his forehead.Mo Ran was shocked. He broke away from the dark memories and suddenly opened his eyes.In front of him was Zhang Yan's delicate face, which was as bright as flowing clouds.A featherman immortal emissary had appeared in front of him at some point in time and was smiling at him.\"This is such a great opportunity. Why is little immortal absent-minded?\"\"Ah, elder sister immortal, please don't blame me.\"Mo Ran was worried that others would see that something was wrong. He forced himself to be alert and smiled at the featherman immortal emissary. \"I am a person who likes to fantasize. When I saw that elder sisters were here, I was hoping to be chosen so that I could see what the Peach Blossom Wonderland was like. I couldn't help but be immersed in it.\"It turned out that when Mo Ran was absent-minded, the feathermen had already started to choose suitable people.Fortunately, he could not see through this tribulation in his previous life. He was so troubled that he did not even notice the movements around him.The featherman immortal emissary smiled again. However, when she opened her mouth, she said something that Mo Ran did not expect. \"I see that your spiritual energy is pure. Your cultivation and talent are also rare. If you want to go to the Peach Blossom Wonderland, come with me.\"Mo Ran: \"\u2026\"Mo Ran: \"!!!\"Go to the Peach Blossom Wonderland?In his previous life, only Shi Mei and Chu Wanning were chosen. Why was it that in this life \u2014His astonishment was obvious. Being chosen by the feathermen was something to be astonished about. Thus, the people around him did not find it strange. They only looked at him with envious gazes.Mo Ran was brought to the Core Heart Palace by the feathermen. After the initial astonishment, his violently beating heart slowly calmed down. However, his eyes revealed a trace of ecstasy that no one could see.In this life, some things had indeed changed.Although he did not know whether these changes were a blessing or a curse, and why his fate chart had changed, at least he could go to the Peach Blossom Wonderland. As long as he followed the feathermen to learn spells, the heavy responsibility of repairing the enchantment would not fall on Shi Mei's shoulders.He was a boorish person. After living two lives, he did not know what it meant to be the head of all living things and the tail of oneself.However, Shi Mei was the person who treated him the best in this world. In front of this person, nothing was important.Including this body of his and half of his soul.As long as Shi Mei was alive, he could give up everything.However, when the feathermen finished choosing everyone and gathered in front of the Core Heart Palace, Mo Ran discovered that the lineup this time was completely different from the lineup in his previous life.Shi Mei was still among the people chosen.However, because he was cultivating in seclusion, Chu Wanning was absent from the selection. Therefore, he was not chosen in the end. Instead, it was Elder Xuanji's disciple, Xia Sini.What made Mo Ran even more surprised was that Xue Meng was also invited by the Peach Blossom Wonderland. In the words of the Immortal Emissary, he said, \"You seem to have the residual power of the Gou Chen God's sword on you. Interesting.\"The faint sound of a bell rang from the Tong Tian Tower not far away. It was deep and resounded throughout the entire Peak of Life and Death.\"At the Peak of Life and Death in the lower cultivation world, the immortals chosen are Xue Ziming, Mo Weiyu, Shi Mingjing, and Xia Sini. A total of four people.\" After communicating with Xue Zhengyong, the leading featherman immortal emissary released a voice transmission bird.She raised her hand and let the bright-feathered bird perch on the tip of her finger. She continued in a clear voice, \"Today, I've met these four people. Their talents are suitable, and their natures are pure.Reporting to the Immortal. \"After she finished speaking, the bird flew away.The bird remembered her words. It flapped its strong wings and quickly disappeared into the vast sky.Going to the Peach Blossom Wonderland to cultivate immortal techniques was a more rare opportunity than going to the Divine Martial Arts. No one would reject it.Also, the purpose of cultivating immortal techniques was to defend against the large-scale collapse of the Ghost World's barrier. This was the responsibility of immortal cultivators, so no one could reject it.The cultivation time could be as short as a few months, or as long as three to five years.The feathermen were not unreasonable. Seeing that the end of the year was approaching, they deliberately let them have a good New Year's Eve. After that, they would take them to the Peach Blossom Wonderland on Mount Jiuhua.When Mo Ran thought about how he would soon go to the Peach Blossom Wonderland with Shi Mei to cultivate, he couldn't help but feel happy.However, this happiness didn't last for long. It slowly faded away.At first, he didn't understand why. Until one day, when he passed by the southern foot of the Peak of Life and Death, he raised his head and looked at the Red Lotus Pavilion.Mo Ran couldn't help but slow down his footsteps. In the end, he stopped moving and looked up at the vast mountain in the distance.Chu Wanning had been in seclusion for more than three months.In this life, his hatred for this person seemed to have faded away \u2026 Even though he repeatedly told himself not to forget Chu Wanning's face when he abandoned him and Shi Mei, sometimes he still couldn't help but sympathize with him and feel confused.Xia Si Ni was walking with him. At this time, he saw that Mo Ran's expression was strange. He also saw that he was staring at the South Peak in a daze. He was slightly moved and asked, \"What's wrong?\"\"Little Martial Brother, do you think he will be able to come out before we leave?\"\"\u2026 Him?\"\"Yes.\"Mo Ran was stunned for a moment. When he came back to his senses, he smiled at Chu Wanning. After these days of being together, he felt that this Little Martial Brother was really obedient and sensible. He also liked him very much. \"I'm talking about my Master, Elder Yu Heng.\"Chu Wanning, \"I see \u2026\"Mo Ran sighed and muttered, \"He has never been in seclusion for so long before.Could it be that he was seriously injured at the Jincheng Lake? \"This was the first time in a long time that he took the initiative to mention his Master.Chu Wanning obviously knew that it was impossible, but he couldn't help but ask, \"You \u2026 Do you miss him?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Mo Ran was asked like this, his expression was somewhat stunned.Do I miss him?Although the grudges in his previous life were deep and could not be resolved, in this life Chu Wanning had never done anything wrong to him. Instead, he had protected him in adversity time and time again, causing him to fall ill.After a while, he slowly said, \"Well \u2026 \u2026 he was injured several times, all because of me \u2026 \u2026\"When Chu Wanning heard him say this, he felt warmth in his heart. Just as he was about to say something to Mo Ran, he heard him say the second half of the sentence.\"This kindness is too heavy. I only hope to help him get better quickly. I don't want to owe him too much.\"The warm feeling in his heart seemed to have died. It was motionless and condensed into ice.Chu Wanning froze for a while before he felt that he was very ridiculous.Mo Ran had already said that it was only the relationship between master and disciple. It was him who had thrown himself into the fire because of a little bit of hope. In the end, he could not blame others for burning into ashes.Chu Wanning smiled. That smile must have been very ugly. She had been snubbed.\"Don't think too much. Since you are his disciple, you don't owe him anything.Everything was done willingly by him. \"Mo Ran turned his eyes to look at him, \"You, at such a young age, always speak like an adult with a straight face.\" As he said this, he smiled and rubbed his head.Chu Wanning was rubbed by him. At first, he was still smiling. Later, a layer of water slowly appeared in his eyes. He looked at the bright young face in front of him and said softly, \"Mo Ran, I don't want to play with you anymore. Let go.\"Mo Ran's brain was too thick. He did not notice the change in his expression.What's more, he was used to joking around with \"Xia Si Ni\". Therefore, he still pinched Chu Wanning's smooth cheeks like he was teasing a child. He gently pulled the corner of his mouth and made a funny face.\"Pfft, why is Little Shidi angry again?\"Chu Wanning looked at the childish child in the other party's eyes. The smile on the other party's face was so ugly, like a sad and funny monster.\"Let go.\"He didn't notice it and teased him as usual, \"Okay, okay, don't be angry. I won't say you're like an adult in the future, okay?Come, let's make up. Call me Senior Brother ~ \"\"Let go of me \u2026\"\"Be good, call me Senior Brother, and I'll buy you some osmanthus cake later.\"Chu Wanning closed his eyes. His eyelashes trembled slightly, and his voice finally became a little hoarse.\"Mo Ran, I'm not joking. I really don't want to play with you anymore. Let go of me, let go of me, okay?\"His slender eyebrows furrowed. Because his eyes were closed, he did not cry, but his throat was choked with sobs. \"Mo Ran, it hurts \u2026\"It was too painful. There was only one person in his heart. He carefully hid her in the deepest part of his heart. It was fine if she didn't like him. As long as he could silently think of her and protect her, it was fine even if he couldn't get her.However, all of that person's softness was for others. All that was left for him was a body full of thorns.He held her in his heart. Whenever that person moved, his heart would bleed profusely. Day by day, the old scars had not healed, and new wounds would appear.Thus, he knew that even if he did not ask for her, as long as she was still in his heart, he would be in pain.He did not know how long he could hold on in this kind of pain. He did not know when he would break down.Mo Ran finally realized that something was wrong. He let go of his hand in a panic and touched his slightly red face. He was flustered and did not know what to do.Chu Wanning suddenly felt that it was actually good to be smaller.At least he could say that it hurt without any hesitation and show that he was softened.At least he could make him look at him with concern.That was something he did not even dare to think about.In the blink of an eye, New Year's Eve came.This was the most lively and leisurely time of the year at the Peak of Life and Death. All the disciples pasted peach talismans and swept the snow. The chef at the Meng Po Lobby was busy from morning to night, preparing for the year-end feast. Each of the elders also used their own spells to add to the festive atmosphere.For example, Elder Tanlang enchanted a pool of spring water into fine wine.Elder Xuanji released more than three thousand firelight mice that he had tamed and had them stand guard at various places in the sect to keep everyone warm.Elder Lucun cast a spell on the snowmen that everyone had made. He had them squeak and run all over the mountain, shouting \"Happy New Year\" whenever they met someone.No one expected Elder Yu Heng to do anything. In fact, Yu Heng was still in seclusion. For a long time, he had not appeared in front of anyone.Only Xue Meng stood by the window and looked up at the begonia petals that were fluttering down from the sky. He said thoughtfully, \"After today, we will have to leave. It seems that we will not be able to see him before we leave.\u2026 I wonder what Shizun is doing right now? \"\"Of course he is cultivating.\"Mo Ran bit an apple and said vaguely, \"Speaking of which, all the elders have to perform tonight.What a pity. If Shizun was here, he would have to go too. I wonder what he will perform. \"After saying that, he laughed first. \"Probably how to 'get angry'?\"Xue Meng stared at him. \"Why don't you perform how to 'beat Mo Weiyu to death'?\"During the New Year, Mo Ran was not angry at Xue Meng's harsh joke. He suddenly thought of something and asked, \"Oh right, did you see Shidi today?\"\"You mean Xia Sini?\"Xue Meng said, \"I didn't see him. He is Xuanji's disciple and hangs out with us every day. Xuanji doesn't care anymore. If he hangs out with us during the New Year, his master will be angry.\"Mo Ran laughed and said, \"That's true.\"The sun was setting in the Red Lotus Pavilion.Chu Wanning held a pill and looked at it carefully.Xue Zhengyong sat opposite him. Chu Wanning did not invite him to tea, so he filled a pot for himself and ate a pastry from Chu Wanning's plate.Chu Wanning glared at him, but he did not notice. Instead, he chewed on the pastry and said, \"Yuheng, don't look at me like that. Tanlang's mouth is poisonous, but he is not a bad person.How could he hurt you? \"\"\u2026 What are you thinking, Lord?\"Chu Wanning said lightly, \"I was just thinking, since Elder Tanlang spent so much effort to create a pill that can let me regain my human form for a day, why didn't he just make a few more?If he needs them, he can just take them. \"\"Ah, it's not that easy.\"Xue Zhengyong said, \"The ingredients needed for this pill are very rare. He only made three pills before using them.It's not a long-term solution. \"\"I see.\" Chu Wanning said, \"I see. Thank you.\"\"Haha.\"Xue Zhengyong waved his hand. \"The two of you are actually quite similar. You both say bad things, but your hearts are not bad.\"Chu Wan-ning glanced at him but didn't say anything. She poured herself a cup of tea and swallowed the medicinal pill that would allow her to return to her former appearance.Xue Zhengyong was about to eat another piece of pastry, but Chu Wanning stopped him.\"What?\" The Lord was dissatisfied.Chu Wanning said, \"It's mine.\"Xue Zhengyong, \"\u2026\"As night fell, the disciples of the Life and Death Summit arrived at the Meng Po Lobby one after another.Every Elder brought their disciples to sit together. Bread, dumplings, snowmen, and firelight mice shuttled through the crowd, helping them pass salt jars, chili powder, chopped green onions, and other miscellaneous items.Every table was bustling with noise and laughter. Only Elder Yuheng's table had all his disciples, but his master was absent.Xue Meng looked to the side and sighed. \"I miss Shizun.\"Shi Mei said warmly, \"Didn't Shizun write a letter a few days ago, telling us to enjoy the holidays and cultivate diligently in the Peach Blossom Spring. When he comes out of seclusion, he will come and see us, right?\"\"That's true, but when will he come out of seclusion \u2026?\"Just as he was sighing, he glanced listlessly at the entrance hall. Suddenly, he froze and sat up straight. Like a cat, he opened his eyes wide and looked toward the entrance of the Meng Po Lobby.Xue Meng's face was flushed red, and his eyes were bright. He was so excited that he stuttered, \"Yes \u2026 yes \u2026 yes \u2026\"Mo Ran thought that one of the rare beasts raised by Elder Xuanji had come out to add to the fun. He felt that Xue Meng's knowledge was shallow and he was making a fuss over nothing.He could not help but laugh. \"What's there to be surprised about?Look at you, it's like you've seen a deity. What's there to be surprised about? \"He turned his head with a grin and looked up casually.He could not say the word 'strange' no matter what.Outside the open entrance of the lobby, Chu Wanning was wearing a white robe and a bright red cloak. He elegantly put away his oil-paper umbrella and shook off the snow. Then, his eyelashes rolled up, revealing a pair of sharp and slender eyes. He glanced at them indifferently.When Mo Ran noticed it, he found that his heart was beating faster, his palms were sweating, and even his breathing had slowed down.The Meng Po Lobby gradually quieted down.When Chu Wanning appeared in the Meng Po Lobby, the disciples did not dare to make a ruckus. Moreover, he had been in seclusion for a long time. Now that he appeared in the middle of the snowy night of New Year's Eve, the frost and snow made his face look even more handsome, and the space between his eyebrows even darker.Mo Ran stood up and murmured, \"Shizun \u2026\"Xue Meng suddenly stood up and ran toward Chu Wanning like a kitten. He shouted, \"Shizun!\" as he dove into Chu Wanning's arms.Chu Wanning's clothes were soaked in the snow and were extremely cold. But looking at Xue Meng's expression, it was as if he was hugging peach blossoms in March or charcoal in October. It was unbearably warm. He kept shouting, \"Shizun, you've finally come out. I thought I couldn't see you before I left. You really do love us. Shizun, shizun \u2026\"Shi Mei also went over and bowed respectfully. His face was full of joy. \"Welcome, Shizun, you've come out of seclusion.\"Chu Wanning patted Xue Meng's head and nodded at Shi Mei. \"I've come a bit late. Let's go. I'll stay up late with you.\"He sat at the table next to Xue Meng and across from Mo Ran.After the initial excitement and joy when Chu Wanning arrived, everyone returned to their old habits and sat upright like their shizun.The table was eerily quiet.In the middle of the table were flour, meat, eggs, and other ingredients. There was also a brand new copper coin.Mo Ran was the best cook among them, so everyone decided to let him take command.\"Then, I'll accept.\" Mo Ran smiled. \"Do you know how to roll the dough?\"No one made a sound.\"\u2026 Okay, I'll roll the dough.\"Mo Ran said, \"Shi Mei, your wontons are the best. There's no difference between the stuffing of the dumplings. You can mix the stuffing.\"Shi Mei hesitated for a moment and said, \"This \u2026 there are some differences. I'm afraid I can't do it well.\"Chu Wanning said lightly, \"It's fine as long as it's edible. Don't worry too much.\"Shi Mei smiled. \"Alright then.\"\"Xue Meng, you just have to help pass them some water or roll up their sleeves.Just don't be a hindrance. \"Xue Meng: \"\u2026\"\"As for Shizun,\" Mo Ran said with a smile, \"Would Shizun like to sit and drink some tea?\"Chu Wanning said coldly, \"I'm making dumplings.\"\"Ah?\" Mo Ran was shocked, thinking that he had gone deaf. \"What are you going to do?\"\"I said, I'll make dumplings.\"Mo Ran: \"\u2026\"All of a sudden, he wished that he was deaf.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWho would have thought that even though Chu Wanning's dumplings were clumsy, the finished product was actually not bad. One by one, the round and cute dumplings were pinched out by his slender fingers and neatly stacked on the table.The three disciples couldn't help but be dumbfounded.\"Shizun actually knows how to make dumplings \u2026\"\"Am I dreaming?\"\"It's pretty good.\"\"Wow \u2026\"Their whispers naturally couldn't escape Chu Wanning's ears. Chu Wanning pursed his lips, his eyelashes fluttering. Even though his face was still expressionless, the tips of his ears were faintly red.Xue Meng couldn't hold back and asked: \"Shizun, is this your first time making dumplings?\"\"\u2026 Yes.\"\"Then why does it look so good?\"\"\u2026 It's just like making a mecha. It's just a few folds, what's so difficult about it?\"Mo Ran looked at him from across the table, gradually lost in thought.In his previous life, the only time he saw Chu Wanning make noodles was after Shi Mei passed away. That day, Chu Wanning went to the kitchen and slowly made the wontons that Shi Mei was best at.But before he could put them into the pot, he was knocked to the ground by the irrational Mo Ran. The white wontons rolled all over the floor.Mo Ran didn't remember whether the wontons were flat or round, beautiful or ugly.He only remembered Chu Wanning's expression at that time, looking at him without saying a word, his cheeks still stained with flour. He looked so unfamiliar, a little lost, and even a little stupid \u2026Mo Ran thought that he would get angry, but in the end, Chu Wanning didn't say anything. He only bent down, lowered his head, and silently picked up the stained wontons one by one. Then, he personally poured them out.At that time, what was Chu Wanning's mood?Mo Ran didn't know. He didn't want to think about it. In fact, he didn't dare to think about it.When the dumplings were ready, the little snowman took them to the kitchen to cook them. According to tradition, Chu Wanning sealed a copper coin inside. Whoever ate it would have good luck.The snowman quickly brought back the cooked dumplings. There was also a mixture of hot, sour, and vinegar on the wooden tray.Xue Meng said, \"Shizun, eat first.\"Chu Wanning didn't refuse. He picked up a dumpling and put it in his bowl, but he didn't eat it. Instead, he picked up three more and gave them to Xue Meng, Mo Ran, and Shi Mei.\"Happy New Year,\" Chu Wanning said lightly.His disciples were stunned for a moment before they smiled. \"Master, Happy New Year.\"Coincidentally, it was only the first dumpling, and Mo Ran bit into a copper coin. He was so caught off guard that he almost lost half of his tooth.Shi Mei looked at his grimacing face and laughed. \"Mo Ran will have good luck in the new year.\"Xue Meng said, \"Tsk, lucky bastard.\"Mo Ran's eyes were brimming with tears. \"Shizun, Li Jie got the dumplings too accurately. Jie was the first one and I got it \u2026\"Chu Wanning said, \"Speak properly.\"Mo Ran said, \"I bit the toe of the shoe.\"\"\u2026\" Chu Wanning was speechless.Mo Ran rubbed his cheeks and took a sip of the tea that Shi Mei handed to him. He finally calmed down and joked, \"Haha, could it be that Shizun remembered which dumpling had a copper coin in it and deliberately knocked me over?\"\"You're dreaming, aren't you?\"Chu Wanning said coldly. He then lowered his head and continued to eat.But Mo Ran didn't know if it was an illusion, but he saw that Chu Wanning's face seemed to be slightly red under the warm candlelight.After the dumplings, the head chef's sumptuous dinner was quickly brought out plate by plate. Chicken, duck, fish, and fish filled the table heavily.The Meng Po Lobby was getting more and more lively. Xue Zhengyong and Mrs. Wang sat at the head of the table and let the little snowman give out generous red envelopes.A little snowman kept bumping into Chu Wan-ning's knee, and Shizi Ancheng's eyes stared at him.Chu Wanning was startled. \"What, I got one too?\"He took the red packet and opened it. Inside was a handful of expensive gold leaves. He was speechless. He raised his head to look at Xue Zhengyong, only to see the vulgar man looking at him with a smile. He even raised the wine cup in his hand and toasted him.So silly.But he also felt that Xue Zhengyong was really \u2026 really \u2026Chu Wanning stared at him for a while. He couldn't help but smile. He also raised his wine cup and drank it in one gulp.The gold leaves were distributed to his disciples. After three rounds of wine, the performances on the stage continued. The atmosphere at the table finally became lively.The main thing was that the three brats didn't seem to be afraid of him anymore.As for Chu Wanning, he was always able to drink a thousand cups.\"Shizun, shizun, shall I read your palm?\"The first one to drink was Xue Meng, whose mind was a little muddled.He grabbed Chu Wanning's hand and looked at it carefully.If he didn't drink three cups of wine, he wouldn't dare to offend him like this even if he had ten times the courage.\"His life line is long but intermittent. His body doesn't seem to be very good.\" Xue Meng mumbled. \"He gets sick easily.\"Mo Ran laughed. \"It's quite accurate.\"Chu Wanning glared at him.\"His ring finger is long. Shizun, you have a good fortune.\"\"The three lines come from the same source. The end of the love line leads to the intelligence line. Generally, people are willing to sacrifice for love \u2026\" Xue Meng stared blankly for a while. He suddenly raised his head and asked, \"Really?\"Chu Wanning's face turned green. He gritted his teeth and said, \"Xue Ziming, I think you're tired of living.\"However, the drunk Xue Meng didn't know it at all. She actually smiled and continued to read. Then she muttered, \"Ah, there's more. The love line has an island-shaped pattern, and it's under the ring finger. Master, you don't have a good eye for people \u2026 Maybe you are blind \u2026\"Chu Wanning couldn't take it anymore. He pulled his hand away angrily and was about to leave.Mo Ran laughed so hard that he was about to die. He held his stomach and laughed for a long time. Suddenly, he met Chu Wanning's cold and stern gaze. He forced himself to stop laughing, but his ribs were throbbing with pain.Chu Wanning said angrily, \"What are you laughing at?What's so funny? \"Just as he was about to leave, Xue Meng grabbed his sleeve.Then, Mo Ran couldn't laugh anymore. Xue Meng pulled Chu Wanning down in a daze and buried his head in Chu Wanning's arms. He wrapped his arms around Chu Wanning's waist and rubbed his forehead against Shizun's clothes.\"Shizun \u2026\" The soft voice of a youth carried a hint of coquettishness. \"Don't go. Come, have another drink.\"Chu Wanning looked like he was about to choke.\"Xue Ziming!!You, you're just messing around, let go of me! \"Unexpectedly, at this moment, the little snowman on the stage suddenly ran down, squeaking. It turned out that Elder Tanlang had finished his sword dance performance. According to the sequence, it should be Chu Wanning's turn.This wasn't good. Everyone's gazes gathered on Chu Wanning. Seeing Xue Meng actually daring to hug Elder Yu Heng's waist after getting drunk, burying himself in the other party's embrace and acting shamelessly, all the disciples were astonished to the extreme. Some of them even dropped their chopsticks as they stared fixedly at this corner.Chu Wanning: \"\u2026\"For a moment, the situation was extremely awkward. Elder Yu Heng did not know whether to stand or sit. He could only stiffly allow Xue Meng to hug him.After a long period of silence, Mo Ran suddenly laughed dryly. \"No, Xue Meng, you're already an adult, why are you still acting coquettishly?\" As he said this, he reached out to pull him up. \"Get up, don't cling onto Shizun.\"Xue Meng was not acting coquettishly on purpose. If he could remember this when he was sober, he would give himself two big slaps.But he was currently very drunk. Mo Ran forcefully dragged him for a long time before finally tearing him off Chu Wanning.\"Sit properly, look at this. How many?\"Xue Meng looked at Mo Ran's extended finger and frowned. \"Three.\"Mo Ran: \"\u2026\"Shi Mei couldn't help but laugh. He also teased him. \"Who am I?\"\"You're Shi Mei.\" Xue Meng impatiently rolled his eyes.Mo Ran also joined in on the fun. \"Then who am I?\"Xue Meng stared at him for a while, then said, \"You're a dog.\"\"\u2026\" Mo Ran said angrily, \"Xue Ziming, I'm not done with you!\"Suddenly, at the table next to them, a disciple, either bold or drunk, pointed at Chu Wanning and asked loudly with a smile, \"Young Master, look at him. Who is he?\"Xue Meng's alcohol tolerance was really low. He could not even sit properly. He leaned on the table and held his chin. He narrowed his eyes and looked at Chu Wanning for a long time.Chu Wanning: \"\u2026\"Xue Meng: \"\u2026\"Chu Wanning: \"\u2026\"Xue Meng: \"\u2026\"After a long stalemate, just when everyone thought that Xue Meng was about to fall asleep due to the alcohol, he suddenly smiled and tried to pull Chu Wanning's sleeve again.\"Brother Immortal.\"These four words were loud and clear.All the disciples: \"\u2026\"\"Pfft.\"Someone laughed out loud first. Then, everyone couldn't help it. No matter how bad Chu Wanning's expression was and how bad his temper was, the law couldn't punish the majority. Everyone knew that no matter how unhappy he was, he couldn't use Heaven's Inquisition to slap everyone here, right?As a result, the bustling Meng Po Hall was filled with laughter. While eating and drinking, everyone was whispering to each other as if they wanted to see the world in chaos.\"Haha, Brother Immortal.\"\"Elder Yu Heng is so handsome. He really does look like an immortal.\"\"If it were up to me, I would have to say something vulgar.Every time I see him, I can't help but think of a sentence. \"Someone asked, \"What sentence?\"\"Except for the three feet of snow on the king's body, who else in the world is worthy of wearing white?\"\"\u2026 Then you really are vulgar.\"Chu Wanning's face turned from white to green, then from green to black. In the end, he decided to pretend to be calm and pretend that he didn't hear anything.After all, he was used to facing people's alienation and awe. This sudden enthusiasm expressed in the festive atmosphere and alcohol made him unable to resist and retreat.Faced with such a situation, he really didn't know how to react. He could only force himself to be calm.However, the faint crimson color around his ears betrayed his handsome face, which seemed to be frozen three feet deep.Mo Ran noticed it and pursed his lips. He didn't say anything, but for some reason, an annoying jealousy suddenly surged in his heart.It wasn't that he didn't know that Chu Wanning was handsome, but like everyone else, he also understood that even though Chu Wanning was handsome, that kind of handsomeness was more of a knife-like sharpness. When he wasn't smiling, he was always as cold as snow, making people not dare to approach him.In his dark and narrow-minded mind, Chu Wanning was like a plate of delicious crispy meat that was placed in a broken and dirty food box. The only person in the world who opened the food box and tasted the deliciousness inside was himself.He didn't need to worry that someone would discover this delicacy and taste it again.But tonight, in the warm fire of the stove, under the stimulation of the wine, there were so many pairs of eyes staring at the food box that no one cared about.Mo Ran suddenly became nervous.He wanted to firmly cover the food box, like swatting away annoying flies, and chase away these people who coveted his food.But he suddenly realized that in this life, this crispy meat wasn't his.He held the sparkling and translucent zips, so he didn't have the free time to chase away those greedy wolves.Mo Ran and the others didn't think that Chu Wanning would actually be like the other elders, seriously preparing a New Year's celebration program. He presented a guqin performance.The disciples' eyes were filled with worship, and someone whispered, \"I really didn't think that Elder Yu Heng could play the guqin \u2026\"\"And he played it especially well, I almost didn't know the taste of meat.\"Mo Ran didn't say anything as he sat in the same place. Xue Meng had already fallen asleep, leaning over the table, breathing steadily.Mo Ran took the wine pot in his hand and poured himself a full cup. He listened and drank while staring at the person on the stage.The irritation in his heart became stronger and stronger.In his previous life, Chu Wanning didn't play any songs at the New Year's Eve reunion banquet.The way he played the guqin was only seen by very, very few people.Probably because at that time, being put under house arrest by Mo Ran, Chu Wanning was really depressed in his heart. Seeing a guqin made of tung wood in the courtyard, he sat on the ground, closed his eyes and played the strings.The sound of the guqin was distant and lonely, attracting phoenixes and butterflies. When Mo Ran returned, he saw Chu Wanning sitting in the courtyard, indescribably calm, pure and noble.How did he treat him at that time?Ah, yes.He pressed him to the side of the guqin and manipulated him, directly violating this cold man in the courtyard.Mo Ran only cared about his own trembling and pleasure, not caring about how much pain Chu Wanning was in. He didn't even care that at that time, it was already past Lidong, and that Shizun, who was so afraid of the cold, had his clothes torn off. He was ravaged by him on the cold stone surface until he couldn't take it anymore and fainted.After recuperating for several months, he still couldn't recover his energy.At that time, Mo Ran said to him coldly, \"Chu Wanning, in the future, you are not allowed to play the guqin in front of others.Do you know how you look when you play the guqin \u2026 \"He pursed his lips, but couldn't find the right words, so he didn't continue.How what?It was clearly a dignified and peaceful appearance, but for some reason, it was so seductive that people couldn't control themselves.Chu Wanning didn't say a word. His lips were pale, his eyes were closed, and his eyebrows were sharp.Mo Ran raised his hand, hesitated for a moment, and stroked the space between his tightly knitted eyebrows.The Emperor Ta's movements seemed gentle, but his voice was still stern and emotionless.\"If you don't listen, I will chain you to the bed. Other than sleeping with me, you can't do anything else.I will do as I say. \"How did Chu Wanning respond at that time?Mo Ran took another sip of wine, looked at the person on the stage, and thought gloomily.It seemed like he didn't say anything.It seemed like he opened his eyes and coldly said one word \u2014\"Get lost.\"He couldn't remember clearly.In that life, he had been entangled with Chu Wanning for such a long time. Many things were no longer so clear, no longer so sharp and clear.In the end, he actually only admitted one thing: Chu Wanning was his person. Even if he didn't like him, he should be the one to destroy him, to tear him to pieces.He would rather crush Chu Wanning's flesh and blood in his palm, like a wolf, tiger, or leopard chewing Chu Wanning's bones and digging out his internal organs, than to let others touch him.He wanted Chu Wanning's blood to breed his desire, his bones to grow his curse, and his body to flow with his passion.Wasn't he virtuous?And then?Didn't he still have to lie with his legs wide open, under the most evil person in the world, on the most violent tyrant's bed, and let the man's fiery blade take his life?He dirtied him, inside and outside, it was all dirty.How could it be so easy to put on the torn clothes?Mo Ran closed his eyes, his knuckles turned white, and his heart trembled.He thought about the past. His ears could no longer hear the lively cheers of New Year's Eve, nor could he hear Chu Wanning's relaxed zither music.There was only a cold, almost crazy voice left in his mind, like a vulture swooping down from the dust of the past, hovering for a long time.\"Hell is too cold. Chu Wanning, you came to accompany me.\"\"Yes, you are a god, the light of others. Xue Meng, Mei Hanxue, the people of dawn are waiting for you to illuminate them. Grandmaster Chu, a sage.\"That voice laughed sweetly. It laughed and laughed, then suddenly became ruthless, like a soul that had been cut in half. It was as angry as thunder. \"But what about me?Have you illuminated me?Have you warmed me?I only have the scars you left on my body!Sage, Chu Wanning! \"\"I want your person, I want your life.You want to be their fire, I want to take you to my grave.You can only illuminate my bones, I want you, to rot with me. \"\"Life and death is not up to you \u2026\"Deafening cheers sounded.Mo Ran suddenly opened his eyes, his back drenched in cold sweat.The performance had already ended. All the disciples were enthusiastically clapping. Mo Ran sat among them, feeling his eyes go weak and pale. He looked at Chu Wanning holding the paulownia zither and slowly walking down the wooden steps.At that moment, for the first time in his life, he suddenly felt so absurd. He suddenly felt that he was like a crazy demon in his previous life.In fact, Chu Wanning was not bad \u2026 why did he \u2026 do this?When the strong wine entered his throat, he was at a loss, at a loss, at a loss. In the end, he was drunk.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMo Ran's alcohol tolerance was actually not bad.However, on this New Year's Eve, he was clearly anxious, but in order to pretend that nothing was wrong, he drank five jars of Pear Blossom White with a smile.In the end, he finally became a little dizzy.Shi Mei hurriedly carried him back. When he fell on the bed, Mo Ran's throat moved, wanting to call Shi Mei's name.However, habits were very scary.In the past so many years, the people by his side were not the white moonlight in his heart, but the mosquito blood that he was tired of seeing.As soon as he said it, he still called the person he thought he hated.\"Chu Wanning \u2026\"It was muffled.\"Wanning \u2026 I \u2026\"Shi Mei was stunned for a moment, then turned to look at Chu Wanning, who was standing by the door.Chu Wanning had just carried Xue Meng back to the bedroom. At this time, he came in with a bowl of hangover soup, and just happened to hear Mo Ran's murmur.After he was stunned, he immediately believed that he had misheard.After all, Mo Ran called him Shizun. It was fine to call him Chu Wanning, but as for Wanning \u2026He couldn't help but think of that time at the Red Lotus Pavilion, when the two of them slept in each other's arms, Mo Ran clearly called out Wanning's name in his sleep, and then covered his lips with a light kiss like a dragonfly skimming the water.Could it be that Mo Ran still had a little left in his heart \u2026This thought was extinguished by him before he could think deeper.Chu Wanning had always been decisive and straightforward, but when it came to feelings, he thought, he was a wishy-washy coward.\"Shizun.\"Shi Mei's pair of beautiful and gentle eyes were somewhat suspicious, looking at him hesitantly. \"You \u2026\"\"Hmm?\"\"\u2026 Actually, it's nothing.Since Shizun is here to take care of Mo Ran, then I, I will leave first. \"Chu Wanning said, \"Wait a moment.\"\"Shizun has other instructions?\"Chu Wanning said, \"You are going to the Peach Blossom Spring tomorrow?\"\"\u2026 Yeah.\"Chu Wanning was expressionless. After a while, he said, \"Go and rest.We need to take care of each other, and \u2014 \"He paused for a moment before saying, \"Remember to come back early.\"Shi Mei left.Chu Wanning walked to the bedside and helped Mo Ran up expressionlessly. He fed him spoonful after spoonful of hangover soup.Mo Ran didn't like the sour taste of the wine, so it didn't take long for him to spit it all out.After spitting it out, he sobered up a little. He opened his eyes and looked at Chu Wanning in a half-sober, half-drunk state. He mumbled, \"Shizun?\"\"Yes.I'm here. \"\"Pfft.\" For some reason, he laughed again. His dimples deepened, and then he said, \"Brother Immortal.\"Chu Wanning: \"\u2026\"After that, he fell asleep again.Chu Wanning was worried that he would catch a cold, so he stayed by his side and tucked him in from time to time.Outside the bedroom, many disciples were still awake. In the world of mortal cultivators, people had the habit of staying up late. Most of them were still in their rooms, telling jokes, playing Pai Gow, or casting spells.When the water in front of Dan Xin Palace ran out, it meant that the turn of the year had come. The disciples went out of their rooms and started to set off fireworks. The night sky was suddenly filled with silver flowers and firecrackers.Mo Ran was still in a daze when he was woken up by the deafening noise outside.He opened his eyes and held his throbbing forehead. He saw Chu Wanning sitting by his bed. There was not much expression on his calm and handsome face. Seeing that he was awake, he just said lightly, \"Did I wake you up?\"\"Shizun \u2026\"After he woke up, he couldn't help but tremble.Why was Chu Wanning by his side?Where was Shi Mei?Did he say something wrong in his sleep?Mo Ran was uneasy. He stole a glance at Chu Wanning's expression. Fortunately, Chu Wanning looked as if nothing had happened, which made him feel a little relieved.Firecrackers sounded outside. The two looked at each other awkwardly for a while.Chu Wanning asked, \"Are you going to watch the fireworks?\"Mo Ran asked, \"Where is Shi Mei?\"The two sentences were said almost at the same time.It was too late to regret it.Mo Ran was a little surprised. He opened his eyes slightly and stared at his face for a long time as if he had never seen him before.After a moment of silence, Chu Wanning got up as if he didn't care. When he pushed the door open, he turned half of his face and said, \"We have to stay up late. He should still be awake. You can go and find him.\"Sure enough, with his bad temper, even if he put all his courage on the line and stayed with him to watch the fireworks, he would only get rejected.If he had known, he wouldn't have asked. How embarrassing.Returning to the Red Lotus Waterside Pavilion, Chu Wanning sat alone under the perennially blooming begonia tree. Alone, he wore a cold cloak and looked at the bright fireworks in the sky.In the distance, the warm lights of his disciple's residence could be seen. Cheerful laughter could be heard, but it didn't have much to do with him.He should be used to it.But for some reason, his heart felt stifled.Perhaps it was because after seeing the excitement of others, it was especially uncomfortable to return to its own cold.He looked at the fireworks in silence, one after another. People were greeting each other with happy New Year's Eve, three or five times.Chu Wanning leaned against the tree and closed his eyes tiredly.After an unknown period of time, he suddenly sensed that someone had broken into the barrier.His heart trembled slightly, but he didn't dare to open his eyes until he heard the sound of slightly panting breaths. He also heard the familiar sound of footsteps, which stopped not far away.There was a trace of hesitation in the young man's voice.\"Master.\"Chu Wanning: \"\u2026\"\"I'm leaving tomorrow.\"\"\u2026\"\"It will be a long time before he comes back.\"\"\u2026\"\"I don't think there's anything to do tonight, and I have to wake up early tomorrow. Shi Mei should already be asleep, so he won't stay up until the new year.\"The sound of footsteps rang out again. This time, it was even closer. It stopped a few feet away from him.Mo Ran said: \"So if you're still willing, I \u2026\" He opened his mouth, but the rest of his sentence was covered by a huge cluster of lively fireworks.Chu Wanning opened his eyes and looked up, just in time to see the brilliant stars in the night sky, the silver frost flowers scattered little by little, the young and good-looking boy standing in front of him, seven parts pity and three parts shame.\"\u2026\"Chu Wanning had always been arrogant, and he had always disdained the companionship of others because of sympathy.But at this time, when he looked at him, he suddenly felt that he couldn't say anything to refuse.It was probably because he was also bewitched by the wine.At this time, Chu Wanning felt his chest ache, but also warm.\"Since you're here, sit down.\" In the end, he said lightly: \"I'll watch with you.\"He looked up at the sky, his expression seemed indifferent, but the fingers in his sleeves were secretly curled up because of nervousness.He didn't dare to look at the person next to him, and only looked at the fireworks in the sky. The night was long, and the petals fell in profusion.Chu Wanning asked softly: \"These days, how have you been?\"\"En.\"Mo Ran said: \"I got to know a very cute little junior brother, and I told Master about it in the letter before.How's Master's injury? \"\"It's fine.Don't blame yourself. \"A firework burst with a bang, scattering into colorful splendor.That night, fireworks and silver flowers were everywhere, and the sound of firecrackers could be heard, and the snow was filled with a thin layer of smoke.They sat under the flower tree to wait for the new year. Chu Wanning didn't like to talk, so Mo Ran found a topic to chat with him. Towards the end, he was a little tired, and unknowingly fell asleep.Early the next morning, Mo Ran woke up and found that he was still under the flower tree, his head resting on Chu Wanning's knee, and his body was covered with a soft and thick fire fox fur cloak. The cloak's fur was smooth, and the craftsmanship was exquisite. It was Chu Wanning's clothes to keep out the cold.Mo Ran was slightly startled, and looked up to see Chu Wanning sleeping soundly against the tree trunk. His eyelashes were drooping, and his long and soft eyelashes trembled slightly with his breathing, like a butterfly in the wind.They actually sat under the tree and slept like this yesterday?It shouldn't be.According to Chu Wanning's obsessive-compulsive temperament, no matter how tired he was, he would still go back to the house to sleep.Why would he be willing to sleep under the tree, and the fox fur cloak on him \u2026Was he the one who put it on him?Mo Ran sat up. His black hair was a little messy, and his eyes were open. With Chu Wanning's cloak draped over him, he was somewhat at a loss for what to do.Yesterday, he wasn't too drunk. Although there were some things that he couldn't remember clearly, he could still roughly recall.As for why he took the initiative to run to the Red Lotus Pavilion to accompany Chu Wanning to wait for the new year, it was a decision he made when he was sober.He clearly used to hate this person, but when he heard him ask, \"Are you going to see the fireworks?\", when he saw him turn around and leave alone with his head down.He actually felt sad \u2026He thought that since they wouldn't see each other for a long time, and the enmity in this life wasn't that deep. Chu Wanning was so lonely, it didn't matter if he occasionally stayed with him until dawn.So he openly came looking for him.Now that he looked back, he felt that he really was \u2026Before he could finish his thoughts, Chu Wanning also woke up.Mo Ran mumbled, \"Shizun.\"\"\u2026 Yeah.\"The man who had just woken up frowned slightly and rubbed his forehead. \"You \u2026 haven't left yet?\"\"I, I just woke up.\"Mo Ran realized that his eloquent tongue would often stutter and get tongue-tied whenever he saw Chu Wanning's indifferent face.After a moment of silence, Mo Ran suddenly remembered that Chu Wanning's cloak was still on him. He hurriedly took it off and hurriedly wrapped it around Chu Wanning's shoulders.When he was putting the cloak on him, Mo Ran noticed that although Chu Wanning was wearing three layers of clothes, without a coat to protect himself from the cold, he looked a little thin in the snow.This thought made him even more anxious. While he was fiddling with the tassels, he clumsily tied his fingers together.Mo Ran: \"\u2026\"Chu Wanning glanced at him and reached out to undo it. He said indifferently, \"I'll do it myself.\"\"\u2026 Okay.\"Then he hesitantly added another sentence.\"Sorry.\"\"It's nothing.\"Mo Ran stood up and hesitated for a moment. \"Shizun, I'm going to pack my things and eat breakfast. After that, I'll leave.\"\"Okay.\"\"\u2026 Are you going to eat together?\"After saying that, he wanted to bite his tongue and commit suicide.What the hell!Why did he invite Chu Wanning to go with him?Maybe it was because he saw the regret on Mo Ran's face after he asked that question. Chu Wanning paused for a moment and said, \"No need.You can go by yourself. \"Mo Ran was afraid that if he stayed a little longer, he would say something even more shocking. So he said, \"Then I'll go first \u2026\"Chu Wanning: \"Okay.\"After Mo Ran left, Chu Wanning expressionlessly sat under the tree for a while. Then he held onto the tree trunk and slowly stood up, but he didn't move.His leg had been used as a pillow by Mo Ran for an entire night. He couldn't feel anything and couldn't walk at all.After standing under the tree for a long time and waiting for his blood circulation to recover, Chu Wanning dragged his leg and limped back into the house.Sure enough, after sitting in the cold for an entire night, even if there was no snow on the ground under the cover of the crabapple tree, he still caught a cold.\"Achoo!\"He sneezed and the corners of his eyes immediately turned red.When he took a handkerchief to cover his nose, Chu Wanning thought to himself, I'm going to die \u2026 I think \u2026 I caught a cold \u2026Elder Yu Heng.Sitting on three divine weapons, the number one grandmaster in the cultivation world that all sects fought over.When Heaven's Inquisition appeared, the four seas were shocked and the white robe appeared.Such a powerful figure, it could be said that he was the strongest martial artist of this generation.Unfortunately, no matter how powerful a person was, he had a weakness. Chu Wanning's weakness was that he was afraid of the cold.Once he was cold, he would easily have a headache and a fever. So, on the day that Mo Ran and Shi Mei left the Peak of Life and Death, not only did Grandmaster Chu's medicine disappear and become weak again, he also began to sneeze and have a runny nose.So on this afternoon, when the feathermen came to pick people up, they received the healthy Xue Meng, Mo Ran, Shi Mei and a pitiful little martial brother \"Xia Si Ni\" who didn't live in Achoo.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The feathermen took them east to the port of the Yangtze River. They summoned a boat that could sail on its own and set it on the sea under the protection of the enchantment.That night, Mo Ran got rid of his master for the first time and spent time with Shi Mei outside. But strangely, he didn't seem as excited as he expected.Xue Meng and Xia Sini were already asleep. Mo Ran lay on the deck alone with his arms behind his head and looked at the stars in the sky.Shi Mei came out of the cabin and took some dried fish that he bought from the fishermen. He sat beside Mo Ran and the two of them chatted while eating the dried fish.\"Mo Ran, if we go to the Peach Blossom Spring, we might not be able to make it to the Holy Mountain Sword Conference. I don't care, but you and the Young Master are both very powerful people. Won't you regret missing the opportunity to show your talent?\"Mo Ran turned his head and smiled. \"What's the big deal? Reputation is nothing. If we go to the Peach Blossom Spring and learn some skills, we can protect the important people. That's more important than anything else.\"Shi Mei's eyes were bright. He said gently, \"If Master knows that you can think like this, he will be very happy.\"\"What about you?Are you happy? \"\"Of course I'm happy.\"The waves hit the boat and the wooden boat rocked on the sea.Mo Ran lay on his side and looked at Shi Mei for a while. He wanted to tease him, but he didn't know how to start.In his eyes, Shi Mei was really unattainable and pure.Maybe it was because he was too pure. He would have lustful thoughts when he was with Chu Wanning, but he wouldn't have them when he was with Shi Mei.Mo Ran was in a daze for a while.Shi Mei felt that he was looking at him, so he turned his head and tucked his long hair behind his ear. He smiled. \"What's wrong?\"Mo Ran blushed. He turned his head and said, \"Nothing.\"He wanted to use this opportunity to carefully confess to Shi Mei.However, the words were at the tip of his tongue several times, but he couldn't open his mouth.Confession.And then?Facing such a clean and gentle person, Mo Ran couldn't be rude or forceful. He was afraid of being rejected. Even if he was accepted, he was afraid that he wouldn't know how to get along with Shi Mei.After all, in his previous life, he had handled his short-lived relationship with Shi Mei very poorly \u2026 Apart from that intimate moment in the ghost emcee's illusion, he had never even kissed her.Not to mention what he had experienced in this life, he wasn't even sure if the person in the illusion was Chu Wanning or Shi Mei.Shi Mei was still smiling. \"But you seem to have something to say to me.\"Mo Ran's heart warmed. For a moment, it seemed like he wanted to recklessly break through this layer of paper.But for some reason, a pure white figure suddenly flashed in front of him. He had a thin face and did not like to smile. He was always alone and looked very lonely.Suddenly, his throat seemed to be blocked, and he could no longer speak.Mo Ran turned his head and stared at the starry night sky.After a while, he quietly said, \"Shi Mei, you are very important to me.\"\"Yes.I know, you are also important to me. \"Mo Ran said again, \"Did you know?I had a nightmare before. In the dream, you \u2026 you were not there. I was very sad. \"Shi Mei smiled. \"You are quite silly.\"Mo Ran: \"\u2026 I will protect you.\"\"Okay, then I will thank my good junior brother first.\"Mo Ran's heart moved. He couldn't help but say, \"I \u2026\"Shi Mei gently asked, \"What else do you want to say?\"The sound of the waves was very loud, and the boat was very bumpy.Shi Mei quietly looked at him, as if waiting for him to say the last sentence.But Mo Ran closed his eyes. \"Nothing.The night is cold. Go back to the cabin and sleep. \"\"\u2026 \u2026\" Shi Mei was silent for a while. He then asked, \"What about you?\"Mo Ran was really stupid sometimes. \"I \u2026 \u2026 look at the stars and feel the wind.\"Shi Mei didn't move. After a while, he smiled. \"Okay, then I will go.You should rest early. \"He turned around and left.The boat sailed on the sea, the sky high and the clouds wide.The guy lying on the deck had no idea what he had missed. He was actually a little absent-minded, and had been trying to dig out the true feelings in the depths of his heart. He pondered for a long time, but because he was too simple-minded, he still couldn't think of a reason when the sky turned white.He and Shi Mei spent day and night together, and their feelings for each other were very deep. Mo Ran thought that when the two were alone, he would be impatient to confess to Shi Mei. But when the boat reached the bridge, he found that this was not the case.Perhaps he was too clumsy. If he rashly confessed to Shi Mei at this time, he would definitely scare him. Even if he didn't scare him, he wouldn't be able to talk about this relationship.Between Shi Mei and him, he seemed to be more used to this kind of hazy ambiguity.Sometimes when he had a strange thought, he would inadvertently hold the other's hand, and the gentleness in his chest would overflow like honey.This feeling was very natural, and he didn't want to break it immediately.When he returned to the cabin very late, everyone was already asleep.Mo Ran lay back on the bench and looked at the night sky through the narrow skylight. Chu Wanning's figure slowly appeared in his mind. Sometimes he closed his eyes and didn't speak. Sometimes he had a fierce expression on his face.Of course, Mo Ran also thought of that person curled up and sleeping. He was docile and lonely, like a sleeping begonia that no one cared about because it bloomed too high.Hatred aside, Chu Wanning's entanglement with him in his previous life was deeper than anyone else's in this world.He took many firsts from Chu Wanning, whether the other was willing or not.For example, the first kiss, the first time he cooked, the first time he shed tears.And also Chu Wanning's first night.Damn it. Thinking of this made his whole body heat up and his blood rush down.In contrast, he also gave Chu Wanning some of his firsts, whether the other was willing or not.For example, the first time he became a disciple, the first time he coaxed him, the first time he gave him flowers.The first time he was thoroughly disappointed in someone.And the first time he was moved.Yes, the first time he was moved.When he came to the peak of life and death, the first person he took a fancy to wasn't Shi Mei, but Chu Wanning.That day under the begonia tree, the white-clothed youth was so beautiful that Mo Ran felt that he wouldn't want anyone else to be his master except for this person.But from which moment did everything change?When did the person he cared about become Shi Mei, and the person he hated became his master \u2026He carefully thought about it these past few months, and then he felt that it should be after that misunderstanding.That was the first time he was punished by Chu Wanning with a willow vine. The fifteen year old youth returned to his bedroom with scars all over his body. He curled up on his bed alone, his throat choked and the corners of his eyes wet.The wound on his back was secondary. What made him sad was his master's cold expression. When Heaven's Inquisition fell, it was like whipping a stray dog, without the slightest bit of mercy.He did steal the begonia in the medicinal garden, but he didn't know how precious that begonia was. He also didn't know how much effort Madam Wang had put in, waiting for five years for one to bloom.He only knew that when he returned that night, he saw a white flower lying on the branch.The flower petals were cold, fragrant and faint.He looked up and admired it for a moment, then thought of his master.At that moment, he didn't know why, but there was an indescribable throbbing in his heart. It seemed that even his fingertips couldn't help but slightly heat up.Before he could react, he had already carefully plucked the flower. His movements were gentle, afraid that he would touch even a drop of dew on the petals.Through the thick curtain of his eyelashes, he looked at the begonia under the moonlight. He didn't know that at that moment, the tenderness and love he left for Chu Wanning was so pure. In the next ten years, twenty years, until his death, there would be no more.Before he could give the flower to his master, he was bumped into by Xue Meng, who happened to come to pick herbs for his mother.The young master angrily sent him to his master. Chu Wanning looked back, his eyes cold and sharp. He glanced at Mo Ran's face and asked him if he had anything to say.Mo Ran said, \"I plucked the flower to give it to \u2026.\"He was still holding the Spring Sleep Begonia in his hand, condensed with frost and dew, indescribably cold and charming.But Chu Wanning's eyes were too cold, so cold that the lava-like heat in his heart cooled down inch by inch.The word \"you\" could no longer come out of his mouth.He was too familiar with this feeling. Before he returned to the peak of life and death, when he was short and thin, shuttling between Le Ling and his benefactor, he spent every day with this kind of gaze \u2014 \u2014That kind of contempt, that kind of disdain \u2026 \u2026Mo Ran suddenly shivered and shuddered.Could it be that Shizun actually looked down on him?Facing Chu Wanning's cold questioning, Mo Ran only felt his heart turn cold.He lowered his head and said in a low voice, \"\u2026 I \u2026 have nothing to say.\"It was a foregone conclusion.Because of this begonia, Chu Wanning hit him with forty vines.Until Mo Ran's initial kindness to him was shattered.But at that time, if Mo Ran was willing to explain a little more, if at that time, Chu Wanning was willing to ask a little more, then maybe everything would have been different. This pair of master and disciple, maybe they wouldn't have taken the first step into eternal damnation.But, there weren't so many ifs.And it was also at this juncture that the warm Shi Mei appeared by his side.After returning from Chu Wanning's place, Mo Ran didn't eat. He curled up on the bed and didn't turn on the light.Shi Mei pushed open the door and entered, and saw this kind of stiff figure in the dark.He gently put the red oil dragon wok on the table, then walked to the bed and called out in a gentle voice, \"Mo Ran?\"At that time, Mo Ran didn't have deep feelings for Shi Mei. He didn't even turn his head, his blood-red eyes still staring at the wall. When he opened his mouth, his voice was hoarse and heavy.\"Get out.\"\"I'm here to send you \u2026 \u2026\"\"Get out.\"\"Mo Ran, don't be like this.\"\"\u2026 \u2026\"\"Shizun's temper is bad, but it's fine once you get used to it.Get up and eat something. \"Mo Ran was as stubborn as a donkey that couldn't be dragged back by ten horses.\"No, I'm not hungry.\"\"\u2026 You should at least eat something to fill your stomach. If you don't eat, Shizun will be angry when she finds out \u2026\" Before she could finish her words, Mo Ran suddenly sat up. Her eyes were filled with grievance and anger, and her eyelashes trembled slightly.\"Angry?What was he angry about?My mouth is on my face. What does it have to do with him whether I eat or not?In fact, he didn't want me as a disciple at all. It would be best if I starved to death. Even if I starved to death, Master wouldn't have to worry about me and that would make him happy. \"Shi Mei: \"\u2026\"He didn't expect that his words would touch Mo Ran's sore spot. For a moment, he was at a loss.He could only stare blankly at his Junior Brother.After a long time, Mo Ran's emotions calmed down. He lowered his head, his long hair covering half of his face.Mo Ran said, \"\u2026 Sorry.\"Shi Mei couldn't see his face clearly. He could only see that his shoulders were trembling, his fingers were clenched into fists, and the veins on the back of his hands were pale green.After all, a fifteen-year-old boy was still too childish. After a while, he finally couldn't hold it in anymore. He curled up, hugged his knees, and buried his head in crying.His voice was broken, hoarse, and intermittent. It was filled with madness, confusion, pain, and sorrow.He let out a heart-wrenching cry as he repeated the same words over and over again \u2014 \u2014\"I just want to have a family \u2026 these fifteen years, I really \u2026 really just want to have a family \u2026 why do you look down on me \u2026 why do you look down on me \u2026 why do you look down on me \u2026 why do you all look down on me \u2026\"He cried for a long time. Shi Mei sat with him for a long time.When Mo Ran was done crying, Shi Mei handed him a clean white handkerchief and brought over a bowl of cold red oil.Shi Mei said warmly, \"Don't say things like starving to death. Since you've returned to the peak of life and death and become Shifu's disciple, you're my Junior Brother. I lost my parents when I was young. If you're willing, you can treat me as your family.Come, let's eat. \"\"\u2026 \u2026\"\"This bowl of rice was made by me. Even if you don't want to give Shifu face, you should at least give me face, right?\"Shi Mei slightly curved his lips. He scooped up a crystal clear bowl of rice and brought it to Mo Ran's lips. \"Have a taste.\"Mo Ran's eyes were still red. He opened his eyes full of tears and looked at the person beside the bed. He finally let go of his mouth and let the gentle boy feed him the food.In fact, that bowl of rice was already cold. He had also soaked his head, so he missed the best time to eat it.But at that moment, under the candlelight, it was this bowl of food that was delivered from afar. Accompanied by that peerless beauty and gentle face, it was instantly engraved in his heart.In life and in death, it was unforgettable.It was probably from that night onwards.His hatred for Shifu grew deeper and deeper. And it was also from that day onwards that he firmly believed that Shi Mei was the most important person in his life.After all, people were greedy for warmth.Especially a stray dog that was frozen to death. When it saw salt, it would shiver. It was afraid of snowflakes floating down. It was afraid of the coming winter.The Emperor Ta looked grand, but only he knew in his heart.In fact, he was really just a stray dog. This stray dog had been looking for a place to curl up and shelter, a place that could be called \"home\". However, he had searched for 15 years and could not find it no matter how hard he tried.So, his love and hate became very simple and laughable.Someone had beaten him with a stick, and he hated that person.Someone gave him a bowl of meat soup, and he fell in love.He was just a little bit promising.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They arrived at the port of Yangzhou the next morning.There were already immortal envoys waiting for them at the port, and several horses were stationed there.Everyone ate breakfast at the port. The feathermen didn't need to eat, so they sat at the port and closed their eyes to rest.It was just dawn, so there weren't many merchants and pedestrians, but the boatmen were already up. They gathered in groups of three to five to eat porridge and steamed buns. They even looked at them curiously from time to time.The burly men in brown clothes sipped their porridge, and sporadic discussions drifted into Mo Ran's ears.\"Hey, hey, I recognize their clothes. They're from the lower cultivation world.\"\"The lower cultivation world is so far away, and they don't interact with the sects here. How do you know?\"\"Look at the insignia on their wristbands.Isn't it the same as the one on the God of Night? \"\"Are you talking about the Exorcist Wood Armor?\"Someone glanced at Xue Meng's sleeve and chewed on a pickled vegetable. He exclaimed, \"Oh, it's true.Then who made the God of Night? \"\"I heard it was made by Elder Yu Heng from the Peak of Life and Death.\"\"Who is this Elder Yu Heng?Is he as powerful as our Lonemoon Night's Sect Master Jiang? \"\"Hehe, I don't know. Who can say for sure about the matters of immortal cultivators?\"The boatmen spoke in heavy tones. Mo Ran and the rest couldn't understand, but Chu Wanning could understand what they were saying. He knew that the God of Night he made had been successfully sold among the people, and he couldn't help but feel relieved.Thus, he planned to make more light and easy to use wooden oxen and horses when he returned to do some good deeds.Early in the morning, the group of people galloped their horses and arrived in front of Mount Jiuhua in less than four hours. It was still early in the morning, the winter sun had just risen high in the sky. Ten thousand strands of golden light fell down like fine gauze, soaking the snowy peaks and making them sparkling and translucent.On the foot of the peak, hundreds of green cypresses and pines stood in the frost all year round. They looked like great hermits with their sleeves down and eyes closed, standing quietly on both sides of the mountain path.The mortals at the top of Nine Radiance Peak called it the 'Otherworld', and it wasn't a lie.The feathermen blew three whistles at the foot of the mountain. A golden sparrow with beautiful feathers flew down from the snowy mountain.The crowd followed the Golden Sparrow's guidance all the way to the west and came to a rapid waterfall.\"Immortal Monarchs, please step back.\"The leader of the feathermen stood at the front, his five fingers twirling a flower, silently chanting a spell.All of a sudden, she pursed her lips and gently exhaled into the wind. A fire dragon soared into the sky and attacked the waterfall, splitting the water curtain in half!The featherman turned around and said with a smile, \"Everyone, please move to the Peach Blossom Spring.\"They followed the feathermen and passed through the water curtain. After passing through the enchantment, the scene before their eyes suddenly opened up. They saw that this place was vast and boundless. It was actually like another three thousand feet wide soft red.The Peach Blossom Spring was a grotto-heaven that didn't have much to do with the cultivation world. Although it couldn't be compared to the real Celestial World and couldn't be compared to the God World, it was still full of spiritual energy.The mountains and rivers in the spring were like freehand ink painting. The colors were elegant and faint. After walking for a while, they realized that the four seasons were changing without a fixed number.The group was led by the feathermen. They first passed through the wilderness and saw the surging river and the sound of apes on both sides.When they reached the outskirts of the city, they saw crisscrossing paths and wheat blowing on the ridges of the fields.Finally, they arrived at the city. The pavilions were neat and tidy, and the eaves were high.The main city of Peach Blossom Spring was grand and beautiful. Its city walls were big and well-equipped, and it was different from the prosperity of the mortal world. It was just that the falling flowers and the flying snow danced in the sky, and the jade birds and red-crowned cranes flew together. The feathermen passing by were all handsome and graceful, and they were like peerless fairies that walked leisurely out of a painting.However, although Xue Meng and the rest found such a beautiful scene to be quite novel, they didn't make too much of a fuss because they had already seen the strange scene of the Jincheng Pool.When they reached a fork in the road, they saw a featherman wearing a white robe embroidered with golden phoenixes standing beside a towering tree. The flame mark on her forehead was deeper than the others, which meant that her magic power was far above the other feathermen.The immortal envoy who led the way brought everyone in front of her. Then, she bent her knees and bowed, saying, \"Great Immortal Master, the four immortal monarchs at the peak of life and death have arrived.\"\"You've worked hard. You may leave.\"\"Yes.\"The beautifully dressed featherman smiled slightly, and her voice was as moving as the clear cry of a young phoenix.\"My name is Eighteen, and I am favored by my family's immortal. I am the Great Immortal Master of the Peach Blossom Spring.I am very fortunate that everyone is willing to give me the honor of coming to cultivate in my humble school.During this period of time, if there is anything wrong with your hospitality, I hope that you will be magnanimous and speak frankly. \"She was so beautiful, and her speech was so polite. She really left a good impression on people.Although Xue Meng didn't like the appearance of a man more than himself, he was at the age where he knew how to appreciate beauty, so he naturally didn't dislike beautiful women. Therefore, he smiled and said, \"Immortal Master is too polite, but the name Eighteen is really weird. What is your surname?\"Eighteen said gently, \"I don't have a surname, so I am called Eighteen.\"Mo Ran laughed and said, \"If you are called Eighteen, then is there someone called Seventeen?\"He was just joking, but who knew that Eighteen couldn't help but smile when she heard it, \"Immortal Master is smart, Seventeen is my elder sister.\"Mo Ran, \"\u2026\"Eighteen explained, \"We feathermen were born from the feathers of the Vermilion Bird Deity. When our cultivation is low, we are usually in the shape of a crested ibis.The first one to transform was my family's immortal. The rest of the feathermen were named one, two \u2026 I am the eighteenth, so I am called Eighteen. \"\"\u2026\"After hearing this, Mo Ran couldn't help but be speechless. He thought that Xue Zhengyong's naming was bad enough, but he didn't expect that there was an even worse one, which was to play with counting.But then, Eighteen told him a piece of news that made him even more furious.\"Let's talk about serious matters first.Immortal Masters, this is your first time here, so you don't know the cultivation rules of the Peach Blossom Spring. \"Eighteen said,\" Cultivation in the mortal world has been divided by sects for hundreds of years.But it is different here.We feathermen have a clear division of labor. There are those who specialize in 'defense', those who specialize in 'attack', and those who specialize in 'healing'. There are a total of three types.Your cultivation will also be carried out according to these three types. \"Mo Ran smiled and said, \"That's good.\"Eighteen nodded at him and said, \"Thank you for agreeing, Immortal Master.You have to know that a few days ago, the cultivators from Lonemoon's Night also came, but when they heard about this cultivation method, they frowned. \"Mo Ran said curiously, \"Defense is defense, attack is attack, and healing is healing. Isn't it good to be so simple and clear?What are they dissatisfied with? \"Eighteen said, \"It's like this. Lonemoon's Night has a Young Master Duan who belongs to the 'Defense' category, so he has to stay with the other Immortal Masters. His senior sister belongs to the 'Attack' category, so she has to stay with the other Immortal Masters.Although I don't really understand the emotions of mortals, I can see that the Young Master is unwilling to be separated from his senior sister. \"\"Haha, so what \u2026 Wait, what did you say!?\"Mo Ran was laughing when he suddenly realized something and opened his eyes wide. \"Not only do people of different attributes have to cultivate separately, they also have to stay separately?\"Eighteen didn't know why his expression suddenly changed. She said blankly, \"Yes.\"Mo Ran's face turned green. \"\u2026\"What kind of joke is this?An hour later, Mo Ran, who had failed to bargain with Eighteen, stood in a daze in a spacious courtyard and fell into a long silence.He, Xue Meng, and Xia Si Ni belonged to the 'Attack' category, so they were assigned to the east side of the Peach Blossom Spring.The so-called east side didn't refer to a small area, but to the living quarters of the 'Attack' Immortal Masters. There were more than twenty courtyards like this where the four of them stayed. There were also mountains, lakes, alleys, streets, and markets. The construction was very similar to the mortal world. It was probably because they knew that they would be staying here for a long time, so they could relieve their homesickness.As for Shi Mei, because he belonged to the 'Healing' category, he went to the southern part of the Peach Blossom Spring. He was far away from Mo Ran's living quarters, and there was a barrier between them. He had to rely on a token to pass through.This meant that although Mo Ran and Shi Mei were in the Peach Blossom Spring together, except for the cultivation method of the feathermen that the Immortal Masters of the three attributes practiced together every day, he didn't have any chance to meet them.This wasn't the worst part.Mo Ran suddenly raised his eyes. Through the curtain of his thick eyelashes, he looked at Xue Meng, who was walking back and forth in the courtyard. It was obvious that he was planning to choose the most comfortable living quarters for himself. The veins on his forehead couldn't help but throb.Xue Meng \u2026That's right. Motherf * cker, from today onwards, he had to live in the same courtyard as Xue Meng every day!Of the eight hardships of life, love, separation, and resentment, he might experience them very thoroughly in the coming days \u2026The feathermen had been chosen from the Upper Cultivation World to the Lower Cultivation World, and the Peak of Life and Death was coming to an end.Because of this, the people from the other sects had arrived earlier than them. Xue Meng soon discovered that in the courtyard where they were staying, there was a small house that already had an owner.\"That's strange. I wonder who's already living here?\" As Xue Meng spoke, he glanced at the mattress that was drying in the courtyard.Mo Ran said, \"No matter who it is, they shouldn't be someone who cares about every little thing.\"\"What do you mean?\"Mo Ran said, \"Let me ask you, which room did you choose to live in?\"Xue Meng's expression became very alert, \"What do you want to do?I've already chosen a room, the one facing the south is mine. If you want to snatch it from me, I'll \u2026 \"Before he could figure out what he was going to do, Mo Ran interrupted him with a smile, \"I don't like rooms that are too big, so I won't snatch it from you.But I want to ask you, if this room is still empty \u2014 \u2014 \"As he said this, he pointed at the small house that someone had already moved into, then asked,\" Are you willing to exchange with him? \"Xue Meng first looked at the simple thatched cottage, then glared at Mo Ran, \"Do you think I'm stupid?Of course I won't exchange. \"Mo Ran laughed, \"That's why I said that person doesn't care about every little thing.Look, when he came here, all four rooms here were empty, but he didn't choose the best one, and only chose this small thatched cottage.If this person isn't a fool, then he's a modest gentleman. \"\"\u2026 \u2026\"This analysis wasn't wrong, but Xue Meng felt like Mo Ran had stabbed him in the face with a knife hidden in his smile.If he was a gentleman and didn't want to live in a good room and chose to sleep in a shabby thatched cottage, then wouldn't Xue Meng be a stingy person?But Mo Ran didn't mention Xue Meng at all, so Xue Meng couldn't scold him, and couldn't bear it, so his face turned red.\"Anyway \u2026 I'm used to living in a good place.\"Xue Meng held his breath and said with a calm face, \"I'm not used to living in a shabby place, so whoever wants to be a gentleman can go ahead.I don't care. \"When he finished speaking, he left.And so, in this side courtyard, the four different rooms all had owners.Xue Meng chose the one in the north, with white walls and black tiles, and a gilded door. It was the most luxurious room.Mo Ran chose a small stone house on the west side. There was a peach blossom tree at the door, and it was in full bloom.Chu Wanning chose the one in the east, with a bamboo building. Under the setting sun, the warm green bamboo was like jade emitting a brilliance.And the one living in the shabby thatched cottage in the south was the \"gentleman\" he had never met before.Chu Wanning hadn't recovered from his cold, so he was very dizzy.He went to the bamboo building early to rest.Xue Meng accompanied him for a while, but this little martial brother didn't know how to act spoiled, nor did he like to listen to stories. He just wrapped himself up like a small dumpling and slept by himself. Xue Meng sat on the edge of the bed for a while, but found it boring, so he patted his butt and left.In the courtyard, Mo Ran came out with a chair. He crossed his legs and rested his head on his arms, leisurely watching the golden crow set in the west, and the last rays of the sun peeled away.Seeing Xue Meng come out, he asked, \"Is Martial Brother Xia asleep?\"\"Yes.\"\"Has his fever gone down?\"\"If you care about him, why don't you go in and take a look yourself?\"Mo Ran laughed, \"I'm afraid the little guy isn't sleeping well, so I'll be clumsy and wake him up.\"Xue Meng glanced at him and said, \"It's rare for you to have some self-awareness.I thought you'd be like my mother's cats and dogs, enjoying the shade in the courtyard and slacking off. \"\"Haha, how do you know I'm slacking off?\"Mo Ran played with a peach blossom between his fingers and looked up with a smile, \"While I was sitting in the courtyard, I discovered a big secret.\"Xue Meng obviously didn't want to ask, but he was curious. After a long time, he still kept a straight face and pretended not to care, muttering, \"\u2026 What big secret?\"Mo Ran waved at him and narrowed his eyes, \"Come closer, I'll tell you quietly.\"\"\u2026\" Xue Meng reluctantly moved his ear closer.Mo Ran came closer and laughed in a low voice, \"Haha, you've been fooled, silly Meng Meng.\"Xue Meng suddenly opened his eyes wide and flew into a rage. He grabbed Mo Ran's collar, \"You lied to me?Aren't you childish?! \"Mo Ran laughed, \"How did I lie to you? I really did discover a secret, but I really didn't want to tell you.\"Xue Meng frowned, \"If I believe you again, I'm really an idiot!\"The two of them played like birds pecking at a dog. Mo Ran was about to say something to make the other even angrier when he suddenly heard a strange voice behind him. \"Hmm?\" He said with some doubt, then said, \"Are the two of you new cultivators?\"This person's voice was clear and bright. It was much smoother than the voice of an ordinary youth.Mo Ran and Xue Meng both turned around and saw a man dressed in martial arts clothes standing in the red light of the setting sun.The man's facial features were deep, his eyebrows were dark, and his hair was tied up with a black jade crown. His honey-colored face was handsome and spirited.Although his body wasn't tall and big, his posture was very tall and straight, even taller than the pine trees and cypresses.Especially his long legs, which were tightly wrapped by black trousers, looked slender and powerful, straight and heroic.Mo Ran's expression changed in an instant. It was as if the blood and sin of a previous lifetime flashed in front of his eyes.He seemed to see a figure kneeling in the rain of blood. His shoulder blades were pierced, and half of the flesh on his face was torn away. But he would rather die than surrender.His heart trembled, like a drop of crystal clear dew falling on a leaf. Mo Ran didn't know what to feel.If there was anyone he admired in his previous life, then the person in front of him was definitely one of them.So the Windswept Gentleman who was going to live with them \u2026 was actually him \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe two brothers stopped messing around and stood up.The person in front of them had a very dignified temperament. Xue Meng was stunned for a while before he reacted. He nodded and said, \"En.That's right.Who are you? \"He was used to being willful since he was young. Although Madam Wang had repeatedly taught him etiquette, he did not take it to heart. Thus, when he asked for someone's name, he did not use honorifics, and he did not use his own name first. It was very impolite.However, Mo Ran knew that this person would not lower himself to Xue Meng's level.After all, this person was \u2026 \u2026\"This one is a disciple of the Scholarly Wind Sect, Ye Wangxi.\"The youth was indeed calm and did not get angry. Under his jet black eyebrows, his eyes seemed to be quenched with the light of stars, exceptionally bright and sharp. \"May I ask what your name is?\"\"Ye Wangxi?\" Xue Meng frowned and muttered, \"Never heard of him.Not famous. \"Although his muttering was not loud, if the other person's hearing was not bad, they would definitely hear it.Because of this, Mo Ran secretly pulled on Xue Meng's sleeve, making him restrain himself. Then, he restrained the emotions in his eyes and said with a slight smile, \"This one is Mo Ran, the pinnacle of life and death. The one beside me is my younger brother, Xue Meng.\"Xue Meng broke free from his grasp and angrily glared at him.\"Don't touch me. Who's your younger brother?\"\"Ai, Xue Meng, you \u2026 \u2026\" Mo Ran sighed. Then, his eyes curved as he smiled at Ye Wangxi and said, \"My younger brother is naughty and mischievous. Brother Ye has seen a joke.\"It was not that he suddenly changed his temperament and became polite to Xue Meng.It was because this Ye Wangxi was an outstanding person. Although he was not famous right now, in his previous life, he was the second most powerful expert in the entire cultivation world after Chu Wanning.Only the heavens knew how much Mo Ran had suffered at the hands of Ye Wangxi in his previous life.In this life, Mo Ran didn't want to be enemies with this hero who was as sharp as a blade and as noble as a bamboo. He didn't want to curry favor with him, but at the very least, he didn't want to be enemies with him.Just one Chu Wanning was enough to put him in a terrible fix. If there was another Ye Wangxi, how could he still live comfortably?Ye Wangxi was a man of few words. After exchanging a few pleasantries, he returned to his room.As soon as he left, Mo Ran resumed his annoying grin. He elbowed Xue Meng and asked with a smile, \"How was it?\"\"What do you mean?\"\"This person.\" Mo Ran asked, \"Do you like her? Is she good-looking?\"\"\u2026?\" Xue Meng looked at him strangely and scolded, \"You're crazy.\"Mo Ran laughed and said, \"The four of us are staying in the same courtyard. In the future, we won't be able to see each other. You should be glad that he's the one staying with us.\"Xue Meng asked curiously, \"Judging from your tone, you know him?\"Mo Ran obviously couldn't tell the truth, so he joked, \"I don't know him. However, I only look at people's faces.I think he's good-looking, so I like him very much. \"Xue Meng cursed, \"Disgusting!\"Mo Ran laughed, turned around, and waved his hand. With his back facing Xue Meng, he made a cursing gesture. Then, he lazily returned to his own stone hut. With a click, he unlatched the door and shut Xue Meng's cursing outside.The next morning, Mo Ran woke up early.In order to let them familiarize themselves with the life in paradise, the feathermen specially delayed their cultivation for three days.After Mo Ran finished washing up, he saw that Ye Wangxi had already left. The other two had not woken up yet, so he went to stroll on the streets.In the early morning mist, many swordsmen from the immortal sects walked past with light steps, rushing to their respective cultivation places.Mo Ran passed by a breakfast stall and saw a new pot of water pancakes. He remembered that his Junior Brother was still sick, so he walked over and said, \"Lady boss, I want eight pancakes and a bowl of sweet porridge. Take them away.\"The featherman who set up the stall said without raising her head, \"Give me six feathers.\"Mo Ran was stunned, \"Six what?\"\"Six feathers.\"\"\u2026 Then should I go find a chicken and pluck a few feathers?\"The featherman looked up and rolled her eyes, \"You want to eat without feathers?Go, go, go. \"Mo Ran was angry and amused at the same time. When he was about to ask in detail, a familiar voice came from behind. A bandaged hand stretched out, holding six golden feathers.\"Lady boss, get the porridge. I'll pay for him.\"The featherman took the feathers and was too lazy to talk to them. She turned around and packed her breakfast.Mo Ran turned his head to the side and saw Ye Wangxi standing beside him. He was handsome and handsome, with a natural air of elegance.\"Thank you very much.\"Carrying the piping hot pancakes and sweet porridge, Mo Ran and Ye Wangxi walked and said, \"If we didn't meet you today, I'm afraid we would have gone hungry.\"\"It's okay,\" Ye Wangxi said, \"Miss Eighteen has a bad memory. She always forgets to give the newcomers some feathers.I just happened to pass by. It's just a small matter. You don't have to be so polite. \"Mo Ran asked, \"Do we have to exchange feathers to do business in paradise?\"\"That's right.\"\"Then where do the feathers come from?\"Ye Wangxi said, \"Plucked from the ground.\"\"Pluck, pluck \u2026\" Mo Ran was stunned. Did they really pluck the feathers from the birds?Then wouldn't all the birds here be plucked by them?Seeing his shocked expression, Ye Wangxi glanced at him in amusement, \"What are you thinking about?There's an ancestral abyss in paradise. It's said that it's the place where the Vermillion Bird High God ascended. The bottom of the abyss is filled with red true fire. It's unbearably hot.Thus, not a single blade of grass grows around it. None of the beasts can live there. \"When Mo Ran heard his description, he immediately thought of the blood-red sky when he passed by the outskirts of the city yesterday. He said, \"Is that abyss near the north of the city?\"\"You're right.\"\"Then what does it have to do with feathers?\"Ye Wangxi said, \"It's like this. Although there are no other living creatures near the ancestral abyss, there's a group of angry owls living in the abyss. They use true fire as their nests and come out at night.Their feathers can help the feathermen improve their cultivation. \"\"I see.\" Mo Ran smiled, \"No wonder you want to use feathers to exchange for things.\"\"Yes.But you have to be careful. When they're active at night, their feathers will become the same as those of ordinary owls. Even if you catch them, they'll be useless.Only when the sun rises in the east every day will the thousands of angry owls return to the ancestral abyss.When they're about to enter the abyss, their feathers will turn back to gold. It'll be useful to pluck them then. \"\"Haha, doesn't that mean you'll be cultivating qinggong?If you're not good enough, you'll become barbecued meat if you fall.If you don't pluck them, you'll starve to death. \"Mo Ran couldn't help but click his tongue,\" This is really troublesome. \"Ye Wangxi asked, \"Are you not good at qinggong?\"Mo Ran smiled, \"I'm just so-so.\"\"That won't do.\" Ye Wangxi said, \"Angry owls move fast and are not inferior to falcons.If you don't cultivate diligently, you'll starve in a few days. \"\"This \u2026 \u2026\"Seeing that Mo Ran was still in a daze, Ye Wangxi sighed and said, \"I've collected a lot of feathers. I don't lack them for now.If the three of you need them, you can ask me first. \"Mo Ran waved his hand and said with a smile, \"How can I do that?I'll just take these six feathers as a loan. I'll go back to eat first. If I pick the feathers tomorrow, I'll return them to you.Many thanks. \"After bidding farewell to Ye Wangxi, Mo Ran returned to the side courtyard with the porridge.Xue Meng's room was empty. He probably had nothing to do after waking up, so he wandered around.Mo Ran then went to Chu Wanning's bamboo house.Chu Wanning had not woken up yet.Mo Ran put the porridge and fried buns on the table. He went to his bedside and lowered his head to look at him.Suddenly, a familiar feeling floated to his heart.The way this little martial brother slept \u2026 \u2026 why did he look a little like someone?But he couldn't remember who he was thinking of. He only had a vague impression of someone who also looked like this. When lying on the bed, he would always curl up into a ball and use his hand as a pillow. Who was it?While he was in a daze, Chu Wanning woke up.\"Oh \u2026 \u2026\" Chu Wanning turned over and saw the person beside the bed. His eyes suddenly widened. \"Mo Ran?\"\"How many times have I told you to call me Senior Martial Brother.\"Mo Ran rubbed his hair and then put his hand on his forehead to check his temperature. \"Your fever has subsided. Come, get up and eat something.\"\"Eat \u2026 \u2026\" The child on the bed repeated in a daze. His hair was messy, which made his face look even more lovely.\"Look at how much your Senior Martial Brother dotes on you. I woke up early to buy breakfast.Eat it while it's still hot. \"Chu Wanning got off the bed in his white underwear and walked to the dining table.There was a fresh lotus leaf on the table. Inside were fried buns with thin skin and crispy bottom. They were sprinkled with green onions and black sesame seeds.There was also a small bowl of longan and osmanthus porridge. It was cooked until it was soft and thick, and it was steaming hot.Elder Yu Heng, who had always been strong, was actually a little uncertain. \"Is this for me?\"\"Huh?\"\"Is this all \u2026 \u2026 for me?\"Mo Ran was stunned for a moment. \"Yes.\"He looked at Chu Wanning's hesitant expression and thought for a moment. He smiled and said, \"Hurry up and eat. Otherwise, it will get cold.\"Chu Wanning had been at the peak of life and death for so many years. Although everyone respected him, because of his stubborn and cold personality, almost no one was willing to eat with him, let alone get breakfast for him.Sometimes, when he saw his disciples taking care of each other, although he was unwilling to admit it, he couldn't help but feel a little envious.Therefore, facing this bowl of porridge and a few buns, he was silent for a long time. He couldn't bear to eat them.Mo Ran saw him sitting on the stool and staring at the food in front of him without eating. He thought that it was not to his taste, so he asked, \"What's wrong?Is it a little oily? \"\"\u2026 \u2026\"Chu Wanning looked back at him and shook his head. He picked up the spoon and scooped a spoonful of porridge. He blew on it to cool it down and carefully drank a mouthful.If he was the handsome and cold Grandmaster Chu of the past, eating porridge like this would only show that he had good self-restraint and was elegant.But when it was done by a child, it was actually a little clumsy and pitiful.Mo Ran misunderstood and said to him, \"You don't like longan?Then you can pick it out and throw it aside. It's not a problem. \"\"No.\"Little Junior Brother's face didn't have much expression, but when he looked at Mo Ran again, his dark eyes were gentle. \"I like it.\"\"Oh \u2026 \u2026 haha, that's good. I thought you didn't like it.\"Chu Wanning lowered his thick eyelashes and repeated softly, \"I like it.No one has ever treated me like this before. \"As he spoke, he raised his eyes to look at Mo Ran and said seriously, \"Don't worry.\"Thank you, Senior Brother.\"Mo Ran didn't expect him to say this and couldn't help but be stunned.He wasn't a kind person, and he didn't like children.The reason why he was so nice to Xia Sini was because he felt that he had extraordinary skills at such a young age, and was a young man worth befriending.But he had a utilitarian heart, and the other party treated him with sincerity.Mo Ran couldn't help but be a little surprised, but when he heard this Little Junior Brother's words, he felt that it was strange, so he waved his hand to stop Chu Wanning from thanking him. He asked, \"Has no one ever bought you breakfast before?\"Chu Wanning was expressionless and nodded.\"Don't the people under Elder Xuanji know how to take care of each other?\"Chu Wanning said, \"I don't often get together with them.\"\"Then what about before you entered the sect?When you were in the secular world, your parents \u2026 \u2026 \"Mo Ran stopped halfway through his sentence.His Little Junior Brother was born as pure as snow, which parent would have the heart to throw him into the mountain to cultivate, and never come to the sect to see him?Presumably, his experience was the same as Shi Mei's and his own.As expected, Chu Wanning said calmly, \"My parents abandoned me, and I didn't have any other relatives, so no one took me in.\"Mo Ran didn't say anything. After a long silence, he sighed deeply.He thought to himself, 'I originally wanted to get along well with this child, first because of his high cultivation level, and second because he's quite calm, different from the usual kids who make noises.But I didn't expect him to have the same experience as me. 'Looking at the Shidi in front of him, he couldn't help but think of the bitter years when he was young. A surge of hot blood surged in his chest, and gradually he felt pity and intimacy.Suddenly he said, \"In the past, no one took you in, but now there will be.Since you call me Shixiong, from now on I'll take good care of you. \"Chu Wanning didn't seem to expect him to say this, and was a bit surprised. After a while, he slowly smiled and said, \"You want to take care of me?\"\"Yes.From now on you follow me, I'll teach you heart sutras and sword practice. \"Chu Wanning's smile deepened, \"You want to teach me heart sutras and sword practice?\"Mo Ran misunderstood his expression, scratched his head and said, \"Don't laugh at me, I know your cultivation level is very good, but you're still young, there are a lot of things you still need to learn.Xuanji Elder has a lot of disciples, he definitely won't take care of you.What's wrong with you learning from me, at least I'm a person with a divine martial art. \"Chu Wanning was silent for a long time, and then said, \"I've never laughed at you.I \u2026 think you're very good. \"If it was before, he would never say such words, but after his body became smaller, it seemed that his temperament also became gentler, as if hiding in the dark, he could finally take off his hard face.Mo Ran, on the other hand, had lived for two lifetimes, and this was the first time he was praised as \"you're very good\". Even though the other person was only a child, it made him feel at a loss and very surprised. He stammered for a long time, and his face, which was always as thick as a city wall, actually turned red.He muttered and repeated, \"I, I, I, I'm very good \u2026 am I very good?\"Suddenly, he vaguely remembered that when he was young, he really wanted to be a good person.But, at that time, his humble but gentle wish was the same as \"When I grow up, I want to ask Sister Li from the rouge shop to be my wife\", \"When I earn enough money, I want to buy sesame seed cakes to eat every day\", \"If in the future I can have two pieces of red braised pork in one meal, I won't change it even if I'm an immortal\". Later on, it became a memory that was blown away by the wind and scattered snow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMo Ran and the others started their cultivation very quickly. Of course, collecting feathers was what he was most passionate about. After all, he didn't really expect to learn too much from these losers from his previous life. Living a good life was the most important thing.Every day at dawn, they went to the Abyss of Ancestors to snatch the golden feathers, then went to Zhurong Cave to meditate. They used the spiritual energy in their bodies to resist the burning sun of Zhurong Cave and improve their own cultivation.Four hours later, they followed the feathermen to learn the Ghost Balance Method.Another four hours later, they fought against each other in the Asura Field.Before nightfall, they went to the Peach Blossom Spring to listen to Miss Eighteen explain the Hundred Ghosts Spectrum and the Art of Exorcism.Of course, Mo Ran liked to listen to scriptures at night the most, because that was the only class that gathered the cultivators of the three major specializations.He knew that Shi Mei's lightness kung fu was not good, and worried that he didn't eat enough, so he would give half of the feathers he plucked to Shi Mei every day.But other than that, it was hard for him to have much interaction with Shi Mei. On the contrary, he spent every day with Chu Wanning, and the two gradually became inseparable.During this time, Chu Wanning would often sit on the railing of the bridge and blow the leaves, while Mo Ran would sit beside him and listen to the sun rise and set, the clouds rise and fall.Or Chu Wanning would stand by the river and feed the fish, while Mo Ran would stand beside him with an umbrella and watch the koi fish jump around, the blue waves and golden scales.When it rained in the Peach Blossom Spring, Mo Ran would hold Chu Wanning's hand and walk with him along the old cracked bluestone path. An oil paper umbrella was open above the two of them.If the water was deep, Mo Ran would carry his junior brother on his back. With the rain falling, the little guy was very quiet on his shoulder and didn't talk much.But sometimes, when his back was hot and there were small beads of sweat on his forehead, his quiet junior brother would take a handkerchief and silently wipe them for him.The handkerchief was white and plain, with a begonia flower embroidered on the corner. Mo Ran felt that the handkerchief looked familiar, as if he had seen it somewhere before. But the thought was like a drizzle falling into a deep pool, never to be found again.One day, Chu Wanning was resting in the courtyard. Mo Ran had a sudden impulse to untie his braids and tie them into a high ponytail.Just as she was combing her hair, she suddenly saw Ye Wangxi walking into the courtyard with a hand on his left shoulder.Mo Ran's eyes were sharp. He raised his eyebrows slightly. \"Brother Ye is injured?\"\"Yes,\" Ye Wangxi paused for a moment, then said with a frown, \"It's just a small injury from sparring, so it's no big deal.It's just that that person is really frivolous and despicable, how despicable! \"\"\u2026\"Mo Ran stammered in disbelief, \"Someone molested you?\"Ye Wangxi glared at him with a sharp gaze and said coldly, \"What are you thinking?\"\"Hahaha, I was just kidding,\" Mo Ran laughed awkwardly, and couldn't help but ask curiously, \"Who is that person you're talking about?\"Ye Wangxi said, \"Who else could it be?It's that playboy from Kunlun's Treading in Snow Palace. \"Upon hearing this description, Mo Ran let out an \"ah\", thinking, \"Could it be him?\"These days, he often heard some female disciples whispering to each other in the Peach Blossom Spring. They kept saying \"Eldest Senior Brother\" and \"Eldest Senior Brother\".It was fine if they were young, but just yesterday, he saw a female cultivator in her forties or fifties standing by the flowers and muttering hysterically, \"There is no man in this world who can stand shoulder to shoulder with Eldest Senior Brother. If he can look at me sincerely and talk to me, even if I fall into hell, I will have no resentment.\"Such an infatuated state made Mo Ran burst out laughing at that time, and he suspected that the \"Eldest Senior Brother\" she was talking about was the person he was thinking of. However, there were many cultivators in the Peach Blossom Spring, and they didn't have much contact with each other. He had always only heard of this person's name, but had never seen him in person. He was also embarrassed to gossip with the female disciples, so he couldn't be sure.\"Today, I was drinking at the Spirit Lake Restaurant in West City,\" Ye Wangxi said. \"That bastard happened to be there too.I saw that he was holding two women in his arms, and he was already very licentious, but other people were willing, and it had nothing to do with me, so I couldn't say anything. \"Mo Ran agreed. \"That's true.\"\"But later, a female disciple of Lonemoon Night rushed in from outside. She looked anxious and looked around. Obviously, she was looking for someone.\"Mo Ran smiled and said, \"She's looking for that 'Eldest Senior Brother', right?\"\"You've heard of Eldest Senior Brother too?\"\"Haha, then look, even a gentleman like you knows about his dissolute affairs. How can I, a member of the Zhang family and Li family, not know?\"Ye Wangxi looked at him silently and said, \"That Eldest Senior Brother is really a good-for-nothing.The female cultivator of Lonemoon Night came to look for him because he exchanged tokens with her a few days ago. He said that he wanted to become Dao companions and never leave each other again. \"Mo Ran smiled again. \"That's something that can't be heard.I guess that Eldest Senior Brother has 17 or 18 tokens of love, all of them the same.Giving a token once to a girl when he's chasing her, I'm afraid it's no different from a pledge of eternal love. \"Chu Wanning, who had been quietly listening, finally opened his mouth. He glanced at Mo Ran and said, seemingly dissatisfied, \"You know about it again.\"Unexpectedly, Ye Wangxi stood on Mo Ran's side. \"Brother Mo is right, that's the truth.That female cultivator secretly admired Eldest Senior Brother, and after hearing what he said, she believed it and gave herself to him that night. \"Mo Ran said, \"Ouch.\" He hurriedly covered Chu Wanning's ears.Chu Wanning said calmly, \"What are you doing?\"\"Children shouldn't listen to this, it's not good for cultivation.\"Chu Wanning, \"\u2026\"After Mo Ran covered Chu Wanning's ears, his eyes immediately lit up and he asked impatiently, \"And then?\"Ye Wangxi was a gentleman, but he didn't expect that a despicable person like Mo Ran would simply listen to his indignant narration as if it was a love story. He said righteously, \"And then what?Eldest Senior Brother naturally didn't want to admit it, and also didn't want to be entangled with that female cultivator.That female cultivator took out a sword tassel as a token, but unexpectedly, Eldest Senior Brother also had a sword tassel in each of his arms. He said that as long as they were his friends, he would give a sword tassel to accompany them, not to give them to his Dao companion. \"\"Tsk tsk, that's really shameless.\"\"That's right.\" Ye Wangxi said, \"I couldn't stand it, so I argued with him.\"When he said this, his expression changed slightly.After a while, he said, \"We argued about something unpleasant, so we fought.\"Mo Ran smiled. \"That's how it is.\"But in his heart, he thought, I'm afraid not.If \"Eldest Senior Brother\" was really the person he guessed, then with that person's personality, he definitely wouldn't fight over something like this.Ye Wangxi was probably hiding something from him out of awkwardness.However, since Ye Wangxi wasn't willing to say, Mo Ran naturally wouldn't expose him, so he changed the topic. \"Then Eldest Senior Brother's skills must be pretty good. If it was an ordinary person, they definitely wouldn't be able to hurt Brother Ye.\"It would've been better if he hadn't said this, but once he did, Ye Wangxi seemed to become even angrier. His pair of pitch-black eyes blazed with anger.\"Good?What's good about it. \"Ye Wangxi said angrily,\" Your own magic is mediocre, but you rely on a woman to fight \u2014 you're a bastard! \"\"Ah?Hahahahaha. \"Hearing him say this, Mo Ran took a closer look. He saw that besides the sword wound on Ye Wangxi's shoulder, there were also three or four bloody scratches on his cheek. It was obvious that he had been scratched by a woman's fingernails. He couldn't help but laugh. \"Eldest Senior Brother really lives up to his name, hahahaha.\"Chu Wanning didn't say anything. Ever since Ye Wangxi said, \"We argued about something unpleasant, so we fought.\" He seemed to be deep in thought.After Ye Wangxi returned to his room to bandage his wounds, Chu Wanning said, \"Mo Ran.\"Mo Ran patted his head. \"Call me Senior Brother.\"\"\u2026 \u2026\" Chu Wanning said, \"The Eldest Senior Brother he's talking about is Mei Hanxue, right?\"Mo Ran smiled. \"I guessed so.\"Chu Wanning didn't say anything again. He pondered.Suddenly, as if he had thought of something, his eyes widened. \"This Ye Wangxi, could it be that he was \u2014\"\"Shh!Be quiet! \"Mo Ran put his finger to his lips, stopping him from speaking. Then he crouched down, keeping his face level with Chu Wanning. He laughed. \"You're so young, what are you thinking about?\"\"\u2026 \u2026 I've heard that Mei Hanxue \u2026 \u2026 is especially unreliable. He's done all kinds of absurd things. I didn't expect that he would even dare to do Confucian Wind Sect's disciples \u2026 \u2026\"Mo Ran laughed casually. \"Hahaha, he's quite unreliable.But we don't care about other people's business.Come, Senior Brother will continue to tie your hair.I saw a pretty hairpin on West Street before. It wasn't expensive, so I bought it. I'll put it on for you to see. \"Just like how Mo Ran didn't like Chu Wanning's taste, Chu Wanning didn't dare to compliment Mo Ran's taste.Chu Wanning looked at the dazzling golden butterfly hairpin and fell silent. \"\u2026 \u2026 Are you sure this is for me to wear?\"\"Yes.Children should use gold and red. Look at how lively they are. \"Chu Wanning: \"\u2026\"He was really reluctant, but when he thought about it carefully, this seemed to be the first time Mo Ran had given him a gift. Thus, he kept quiet and let Mo Ran fasten the hairpin to the top of his ponytail with a sullen expression.Golden orchids and butterflies glowed brilliantly on the inky hair.Chu Wanning lowered his eyelashes.Suddenly, he felt that this was also very good.This kind of color, this kind of Mo Ran, this kind of himself, if his body recovered, he would definitely not have this kind of appearance again.This butterfly seemed to have flown in from a dream.White clouds and grey dogs, the sun and moon are like shuttles.In the blink of an eye, half a year had passed.According to Miss Eighteen, half a year later, everyone would have to take the feathermen's test one by one to test their cultivation progress.\"This is everyone's first trial since arriving here.\"At the gathering, Miss Eighteen said, \"The content of the trial is divided into three major dangers according to the cultivation method that each of you cultivates.The guards will enter the 'Blood River Realm', the healers will enter the 'Great Sorrow Realm', and the attackers will enter the 'Asura Realm'. \"\"The above three major dangers are the Void Realm restored according to the memories left behind when the Ghost Realm invaded the human world hundreds of years ago.Everyone will not be in any danger. After solving the crisis of the Void Realm, you will return to the Peach Garden. \"\"Only two people can enter the Void Realm trial at a time. In other words, the cultivator can challenge alone. If they want to invite a companion, they can only invite one.The order of the trial is based on the immortal envoy's announcement. \"After the gathering, the trial slowly began.Mo Ran did not know the situation of the guards and healers, but the attackers had tested six or seven people in succession. Fortunately, those people did well. It seemed that this trial was not too difficult.After ten minutes, it was Mo Ran's turn.The one in charge of the attackers was Miss Eighteen. She smiled and asked, \"Does Immortal Monarch Mo need a companion to go with you?\"Mo Ran thought for a moment. \"If I choose a person to go with me, does that mean that he won't have to go through the trial again?\"\"Of course.\"\"Then I'll take Junior Brother.\" Mo Ran pointed at Chu Wanning. \"He's still young. I'll be worried if he's alone.\"The bright moon hung in the sky. They followed Miss Eighteen to a dark cave. The entrance of the cave was shrouded in a thin layer of golden-red smoke.Miss Eighteen said, \"Immortal Monarchs, please listen carefully. The scene restored by the Asura Realm is the first tragedy of the Ghost Realm two hundred years ago.At that time, because the barrier was not repaired in time, a large number of ghosts escaped to the human world, killing countless living creatures.This Void Realm is based on the memories of a survivor in Lin 'an.The moment you step into the cave, you will arrive at the war-torn Lin 'an City two hundred years ago.Kill the Ghost King leading the army, and the Void Realm will be broken. \"Mo Ran glanced at Chu Wanning, then turned to Miss Eighteen and said with a smile, \"Sister Fairy, it doesn't matter if my skin is rough and my flesh is thick, but my Junior Brother is only six years old. Say, this sword is heartless. What if it hurts him \u2026\"\"You don't have to worry. All the weapons in the Void Realm won't really hurt the two of you.\"Miss Eighteen said, \"If the two of you are injured, there will be a spiritual mark. If the mark hits the vital parts, it means that the two of you are seriously injured and die, and the challenge will fail.\"Only then did Mo Ran feel relieved. He clapped and said with a smile, \"So that's how it is. Sister Fairy, you're really thoughtful. Thank you very much.\"Since the worry was eliminated, Mo Ran and Chu Wanning went to the cave to train together.The cave was dark. As soon as they stepped in, their bodies suddenly felt suspended. Then, a blurry scene of colorful lights flashed in front of them. Countless distorted faces converged into a river and floated under them.When the two of them fell to the ground and steadied their feet, they found that they had been teleported to Gu Lin 'an, standing at the entrance of the old road on the outskirts of the city.At this time, it was noon. The sun was shining brightly, and the air was filled with a strong fishy smell.Two hundred years ago, the ancient city of Lin 'an was filled with the thick stench of blood. It was like a yellowed scroll that had been burned in the flames of war. It slowly unfolded before Mo Ran and Chu Wanning's eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAt that time, Lin 'an City was in the midst of war. Everywhere one looked, there was blood everywhere, and there were broken walls everywhere.Under the corrosive miasma of evil spirits, all the grass in the suburbs withered, and all the trees withered.Before Mo Ran could come back to his senses, he heard a strange noise. He looked up and saw a fresh intestine hanging on the branch of an old pagoda tree not far away. More than ten black crows were pecking at it. Drops of blood and meat were constantly splashing down.Under the tree, a middle-aged man's body was lying on the ground. His abdomen was torn open by claws. Dirty blood and internal organs flowed all over the ground.No one knew whether his eyes were open or closed when he died. His eyeballs had been pecked out.Mo Ran was not unfamiliar with this kind of scene.In his previous life, he moved unhindered in the human world. He had once slaughtered 72 cities of the Confucian Wind School. At that time, blood flowed and corpses were everywhere. It was also a tragic scene.But for some reason, the blood of his previous life made him very happy. Every piece of bone and flesh in his body was screaming wantonly.However, at this moment, he suddenly saw a similar tragic scene. A layer of coldness rose in his heart. He felt half an inch of pity \u2026 Could it be that he had been pretending to be well-behaved for so long that he had unconsciously changed his nature?While he was thinking, he suddenly heard the sound of horse hooves. A cloud of dust rose up in front of him.In this kind of chaotic world, those who could ride horses quickly were most likely not good people.Mo Ran immediately pulled Chu Wanning behind him. However, the old road of Lin 'an was empty and there was no place to hide.In the blink of an eye, a group of light cavalry appeared in the vast cloud of dust. When he looked closer, he found that the horses were not strong. Some of them were so hungry that even their ribs could be seen. There were more than ten people sitting on the backs of the horses, pressing on their heads.Those people were wearing the same white robes with red and white feathers on their heads. Their eyebrows were tied with the Double Dragon Strangulation Headband.Although their clothes were not very clean, they were very neat. Although their faces were very thin, they were still hale and hearty.What was even rarer was that each of them had a strong bow and a full quiver of arrows on their backs.In this chaotic world, the two most valuable things were food and weapons.They were obviously not ordinary people.Mo Ran didn't know whether the visitor was good or bad, friend or foe.One of the teenagers, who was about fourteen or fifteen years old, screamed, \"Father!Father! \"The young man tumbled down from the horse's back and fell into the mud. He scrambled to his feet and ran towards the tree. He threw himself on the body of the dead middle-aged man and cried, \"Father!Father! \"The others also showed a pitiful expression, but they had obviously seen too many deaths, so much so that they were somewhat numb. Therefore, other than the youth who was holding the corpse and crying bitterly, there was no one else who dismounted from their horses to console him.Someone noticed Mo Ran and Chu Wanning not far away. He was stunned for a moment and asked in Lin 'an dialect, \"You're not locals, are you?\"Mo Ran said, \"Yes \u2026 we are from Shu.\"\"So far?\"The man was shocked. \"In this world, there are ghosts everywhere at night. How did you survive?\"\"\u2026 I know some magic.\"Mo Ran knew that the more he spoke, the more likely he would make mistakes. Seeing that these people didn't mean any harm, he pulled Chu Wanning out and said, \"This is my brother. We passed by here and couldn't walk anymore, so we want to take a break.\"When the riders saw Chu Wanning, some of them seemed to be stunned for a moment. Two of them even whispered a few words to each other.Mo Ran was alert and asked, \"What's wrong?\"\"Nothing.\" The leading young man said, \"Seriously.If you want to rest, you can rest in the city.Although there are no monsters here now, when night comes, there will be ghosts everywhere. Young Man's foster father went out to look for food in the daytime, but there was a rainstorm yesterday, so he didn't have time to come back before dark. You see \u2026 \"He sighed heavily and didn't continue.It turned out that Young Man was the crying boy, and the dead man under the tree was his foster father.Such things always happened in troubled times. A family member would go out in search of food in the morning and never come back at night.Although this had happened 200 years ago, the boy cried so hard that he almost cried blood. Mo Ran saw it and couldn't help but feel a little bitter in his heart.However, after the slight bitterness, there was a sudden surge of fear in his heart.In his previous life, he killed people without spilling blood. Why did he gradually become soft-hearted?He immediately pulled Chu Wanning and said goodbye to the young riders.The leading man said, \"When you enter the city of Lin 'an, find a place to stay first.Lin 'an is about to move the whole city to Putuo. There is abundant Spiritual Qi there, and it hasn't been attacked by the ghost for the time being.You are alone, so it's better to go with us. \"\"Move the whole city?\"\"Yes.\"Speaking of this, the man's eyes were shining, and his face seemed to be shining. \"Thanks to Childe Chu's good strategy, all the people in the city can survive.Let's not talk about it. We have to search the suburbs before dark to see if there are any survivors who can be brought back to the city. Alas, Young Man, let's go. Let's go. \"He called Young Man, but Young Man was still holding the body of her foster father and crying. She didn't look back.Mo Ran sighed, pulled Chu Wanning, and whispered, \"Let's go.Let's go to the city first. \"Chu Wanning nodded and suddenly asked, \"You said they moved the whole city. Did they succeed?\"Mo Ran held his cold little hand and said, \"Do you want to hear the truth or the lie?\"\"Of course, the truth.\"\"It's better for children to listen to lies.\"Chu Wanning said, \"They didn't succeed.\"\"Yes.\"Mo Ran said, \"You see, you know what the truth is, but you still ask again. It's as if you can change the result by asking me again.\"Chu Wanning ignored him and continued to ask, \"Do you know why they didn't succeed?\"\"You ask me again. I'm not an old demon who has lived for two hundred years. How can I know?\"Chu Wanning didn't say anything. After a while, he said gloomily, \"Almost all the people in Lin 'an city have died in the past two hundred years.\"Mo Ran, \"\u2026\"Chu Wanning said, \"Not many escaped.\"\"No, Junior Brother, you are so young. How do you know all this?\"Chu Wanning rolled his eyes at him, \"Elder Yu Heng has talked about it more than once in the old history books. You don't listen in class and instead ask me why I know so much. It's really hateful.\"Mo Ran was a little speechless. He thought to himself, I was absent-minded in my Shizun's class. He hasn't even scolded me yet. Why are you scolding me? But after thinking about it, he didn't want to lower himself to the child's level and let him be happy.The two talked as they walked. Unknowingly, they passed the city gate and came to the main city of Lin 'an.This ancient city, which stood on one side of the Qiantang River, was already fortified and deserted. Exorcism fortifications were all over the walls and the edges of the city.Outside the city, countless corpses were piled up. They were all full of evil ghost curse marks. If these corpses were not dealt with, they would rise at night.The Taoist priests took advantage of the noon sun to come out and spread incense ashes. For those with particularly deep curses, they dipped cinnabar in wine and drew talismans to dispel them.There were two guards standing in front of the city gate. They were dressed exactly the same as the group of young people they had just seen outside the city. They were also dressed in white with red edges. They had a double-dragon strangulation ring on their foreheads. They had bows on their arms and a quiver full of arrows on their backs.\"Stop, who are you?\"Mo Ran explained again according to what he had just said. The two guards didn't mean to stop people from entering. They just wanted to register. So after recording the two of them, they let them in.Before leaving, Mo Ran remembered the \"Master Chu\" that the young man on the horse had just mentioned. Since that person said that the migration of Lin 'an was a good idea of \"Master Chu\", then the key to breaking the virtual array should be this Master Chu.\"Sorry, I want to ask you about a person.\" Mo Ran said.The guard raised his eyes, \"You came from Shu. Do you know anyone?\"Mo Ran said with a smile, \"No, a few soldiers we met on the road just now mentioned a Master Chu. They said that he would take the whole city to Putuo in two days. May I know who this Master Chu is?I know a little about magic. If it's possible, I'd like to help. \"The guard looked him up and down. Perhaps he felt that Mo Ran should be quite capable since he was able to bring a child all the way here unscathed, so he said, \"Young Master Chu is the eldest son of the governor.A month ago, the Ghost King came and the governor unfortunately died. Since then, Master Chu has been leading us to fight against the enemy. \"\"The governor's son?\"Mo Ran and Chu Wanning looked at each other. Mo Ran said, \"It's strange. Does the governor's son also know magic?\"\"What's so strange about it?\" The guard glanced at Mo Ran, \"Only big sects are allowed to cultivate but not ordinary people?\"\"\u2026\"There were independent cultivators, but they never made a difference.Mo Ran thought to himself, could it be that Master Chu was stupid enough to come up with ideas that harmed the lives of the people in Lin 'an City?However, as Mo Ran followed the guard's instructions and walked towards the Governor's Mansion, he immediately realized that he was wrong.That Master Chu, who happened to have the same surname as his master, was obviously not a person with mediocre skills.Because he saw the Shang Qing Barrier.The Shang Qing Barrier was a very strong barrier of purifying air. It could block all evil aura within the barrier.As long as this barrier was open, not to mention ordinary ghosts, even a thousand-year-old malicious spirit would find it difficult to step in.However, the barrier's protective range required the caster to be inside and be the eye of the array.Moreover, the barrier covered a very small area. Even a great master like Chu Wanning could only use the Shang Qing Barrier to cover half of the peak of life and death.But at this moment, this Master Chu from two hundred years ago created a Shang Qing Barrier that covered a radius of ten miles around the governor's office. Although it was far inferior to Chu Wanning's, it was definitely not something that ordinary people could compare to.The two of them walked towards the gate of the governor's office. Mo Ran originally wanted to try his luck and let someone report that there was a cultivator asking for help. He wanted to see if the governor's son would be willing to give him face.Unexpectedly, as soon as he turned a corner, he saw three long lines in front of the governor's office.Six female attendants dressed in the same clothes as the guards placed large wooden buckets on the ground. Several hundred old and weak women and children gathered in front of the government office and were receiving porridge as alms.After receiving the porridge, the people came to a begonia tree in front of the office.Under the flowering tree stood a white-clothed man. His long black hair was loosely tied into a bundle. He was distributing talisman paper after talisman paper to everyone and carefully warning them about the things they needed to pay attention to.His back was facing Mo Ran so his face could not be seen clearly.However, those who received the talisman paper all thanked him gratefully, \"Thank you Master Chu for your kindness, thank you Master Chu for your kindness \u2026\" After that, they left.So this is the governor's son?Mo Ran was curious and pulled his junior over to take a look.With just one look, Mo Ran's eyes widened as if he was struck by lightning.Isn't this Chu Wanning???Not only Mo Ran, but even Chu Wanning himself was stunned. Looking from afar, the governor's son had a thin face, sword-like eyebrows, phoenix-like eyes, and the curve of his nose was very gentle. Even his white clothes were very similar to his own!Chu Wanning, \"\u2026\"Mo Ran, \"\u2026\"After being stunned for a long time, Mo Ran said with a trembling voice, \"Junior Martial Brother.\"\"Yes.\"\"Don't you think \u2026 this Master Chu looks very similar to someone?\"Chu Wanning said dryly, \"He looks like Elder Yu Heng.\"Mo Ran slapped his thigh, \"Of course!What's going on?Who is this person?What's his relationship with Master? \"\"\u2026 How would I know if you ask me?\"\"Weren't you paying attention in class?\" Mo Ran was very anxious.\"I won't talk about this in class.\" Chu Wanning was very angry.The two of them stopped talking and lined up in the queue. They slowly moved forward and stared at the young master without blinking.When they took a closer look, they realized that Master Chu and Chu Wanning did not look the same.This young master's face was more gentle and elegant. His eyes were not as long and narrow and his pupils were gentler. His gaze was also much gentler than Chu Wanning's.Mo Ran looked at them and suddenly made a sound of surprise. He lowered his head and looked at his junior martial brother.\"Let me take a good look.\"\"What \u2026\" Chu Wanning couldn't help but feel guilty and turned his face away.When Mo Ran saw that he was dodging, he became even more persistent and reached out to pinch his face, forcing him to turn around.After a while, he suddenly realized something and muttered, \"Aiya.\"Chu Wanning forced himself to remain calm. \"Wh-what's wrong?\"Mo Ran narrowed his eyes. \"No wonder those people whispered to each other when they saw you outside the city. I suddenly realized that you look a little like Master.\"\"\u2026\"Chu Wanning hurriedly shook him off, but the tips of his ears turned red. \"Nonsense.\"\"But it's so strange. Why were those guards able to tell at a glance, but I couldn't for a long time?\"Chu Wanning: \"\u2026\"Just as he was puzzled, a crisp sound was suddenly heard. A child's voice called out, \"Father.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMo Ran looked in the direction of the sound and saw the answer suddenly appear. The answer was stumbling over the stone steps of the government office.It was a child of three or four years old. He was holding a small bamboo windmill in his hand and was jumping towards Young Master Chu.He was wearing a plain little shirt with a jade collar, a Fu Lu name lock, and a red silk amulet hanging on his chest. He looked like a little junior brother who had shrunk a size.\"\u2026\" Mo Ran finally knew the reason why those cavalrymen were whispering to each other.He couldn't help but murmur, \"Junior brother, you and Master are both from Lin 'an, and Master's surname is Chu. Do you think the Chu family more than two hundred years ago was your ancestral family? Are you two distant relatives \u2026 I think it's very possible.\"Chu Wanning didn't say anything and stared at the two people.He didn't know his background and couldn't remember clearly what happened when he was young.Could it be that this Young Master Chu was really one of his ancestors?While he was thinking, it was Mo Ran's turn in the queue.Young Master Chu raised his eyes and was about to give Mo Ran a talisman. However, when he saw that it was a stranger, he couldn't help but be startled. Then, he smiled gently, \"Stranger, is this your first time here?\"His voice was mellow and elegant, which was different from Chu Wanning's cold and stern voice.\"Ah \u2026 ah, yes, yes.\"Suddenly, there was a person who looked so much like Master and spoke to him so kindly. Mo Ran really couldn't describe how he felt and was at a loss for a moment.Young Master Prefect smiled slightly, \"I'm Chu Xun, may I ask your name?\"\"My, my surname is Mo, my name is Mo Ran.\"\"Where did Young Master Mo come from?\"\"Far, far away, in the middle of Shu, Shu.\" Even if Young Master Chu Xun was gentle, Mo Ran still felt that he would be seen through by this person at a glance.Chu Xun was slightly startled and then smiled modestly, \"It's really far away.\"He paused and looked down a few inches. When he saw Chu Wanning standing next to him, a trace of surprise appeared on his elegant face.\"This is \u2026\"\"My name is Xia Si Ni,\" said Chu Wanning.Mo Ran brought him to his side and rubbed his head. He laughed dryly and said, \"This is my little brother.\"He doesn't look like me. He looks like you.Perhaps it was because of the impending battle, and the urgency of the situation, Chu Xun had no time to think too much.Or perhaps it was because he was just a character in an illusion, so it was difficult for him to react too strongly to things that did not belong to this illusion.In short, he furrowed his brows and looked at Chu Wanning for a while. Then, he handed the two talismans to them with both hands.\"You're a guest from afar. Besides, the people don't have any means to make a living.Please accept these two talismans. If you don't have any other arrangements, why don't you stay in the city for two more days? \"\"I have heard,\" Mo Ran said, \"Is Gongzi going to take the citizens and move to Putuo?What is this talisman for? \"\"This talisman paper is a Soul Annihilation Talisman.\" Chu Xun explained, \"When worn, it can conceal the aura of a living person.\"Mo Ran immediately understood, \"Ah, I know.If the aura of a living person is sealed, the ghosts will not be able to detect whether the other party is dead or alive.In this way, even if we walk in front of the ghosts, they will be confused and won't know what to do. \"Chu Xun smiled, \"Exactly.\"Seeing that he was busy, Mo Ran did not ask more, so he thanked Chu Xun and took his little brother to the side.The two sat by the wall. Mo Ran turned his face and saw that his little brother was holding the talisman paper in a daze. He asked, \"What are you thinking about?\"\"I am thinking that this is indeed a good idea.\" Chu Wanning thought quietly, \"But I don't know why they didn't succeed in the end.\"\"It's not written in the book?\"Chu Wanning said, \"The disaster two hundred years ago was recorded in the most detail in Lin 'an Collection of Annotations.But there are only a few lines. \"\"What does the book say?\" Mo Ran asked.\"Lin 'an was besieged, and the scene in the city was unknown.When the rebel army broke out of the siege, they saw corpses lying on the road, and nine out of ten houses were empty.The governor's office had a hundred people and seven hundred and forty families, all dead. \"\"\u2026\" Mo Ran said, \"The cause of death was not written?\"\"There is no record.At that time, Lin 'an City was besieged, and very few people survived.Later, a few lucky survivors were rescued by the feathermen, but the feathermen are usually not involved in the affairs of the world, and their thoughts are different from that of mortals.In their eyes, the truth is not important. Even if they know, they will not tell the world for no reason. \"Chu Wanning paused and continued, \"However, since they are going to leave in two days.We will see what happened at that time very soon.Why don't we walk around, maybe we can find some clues. \"The two put away the Soul Annihilation Talisman and were about to leave.Suddenly, they heard a series of footsteps, and then Chu Wanning's sleeve was pulled.\"Little brother.\"Chu Wanning turned around, and it turned out to be the little boy who looked like him. The little boy was very young, and said in a childish voice, \"Little brother, father said that you have no place to stay here, if you don't mind, you can stay in our house tonight.\"\"This \u2026\"Chu Wanning and Mo Ran looked at each other.Mo Ran asked, \"Is it convenient?Your father is already so busy. \"\"It's okay.\"The little boy showed a warm smile, \"There are already many people who have no place to stay at home, and we all live together.With father here, there is no need to be afraid at night, there are no ghosts. \"His words were not coherent, but they were simple and warm, which made people feel sorry for him.Mo Ran said, \"Okay, then we will disturb you tonight, thank you, little brother.\"\"Hehe, you don't have to thank me, you don't have to thank me.\"Seeing him skip and run away, Mo Ran pulled Chu Wanning's hand and said, \"Hey, I'm serious.\"\"I know what you want to say, so shut up.\"\"Hahaha.How do you know? \"Mo Ran smiled and rubbed his hair, \"When we return to the mountain, I will ask Shizun. One of you looks like the older one, and the other looks like the younger one.I won't believe that you are not related to Prefect Chu. \"Chu Wanning said, \"\u2026 So what if we are related by blood.\"\"Ah?\"Chu Wanning looked at the father and son under the tree, and then said calmly, \"Anyway, it was two hundred years ago.They are all dead. \"After saying this, he turned and left.Mo Ran stayed in place for a while, and then ran after him, muttering, \"Hey, you are such a child, how can you be so vicious at such a young age?So what if they are dead, they are still ancestors.If it were me, I would definitely go back and build a shrine for them, make a nine foot tall golden statue, and wear incense and jewelry, so that the incense will not stop every year.I am still counting on the ancestors to protect me \u2026 Hey, hey, don't walk so fast. \"The two of them walked around the city and found that every family was collecting rice straw and making scarecrows.After asking, they found out that this was what Young Master Chu Xun ordered the citizens to do.Regardless of age, every citizen in the city needed a scarecrow. The scarecrow was wrapped in paper and dripped with the person's blood.It was made into a so-called \"fake puppet\".This principle was like the river god wanting to eat human heads, so someone made steamed buns, wrapped them with meat stuffing, and threw them into the river to worship the river god.Some ghosts and deities were not smart because of their roots.Just a little trick could fool them. For example, the ghost emcee that Chu Wanning and the others had come into contact with before had a brain of mud and was extremely easy to fool.It seemed that Chu Xun had made at least two preparations for the citizens. The first was the Soul Destruction Talisman, so that they would not be discovered by the ghosts during the escape.The second was the scarecrow puppets, because once the ghosts and deities found out that the citizens in the city had suddenly disappeared, they would be extremely agitated. Leaving behind the puppets as cover could temporarily stabilize them and buy time for the migration.But the more it was like this, the more doubts Mo Ran and Chu Wanning had.Why did Young Master Chu Xun's arrangements go to waste when he had already made such detailed arrangements?With such doubts in mind, they returned to the governor's office.At this time, the sky was already dark.Many people who lived far away were unwilling to go home, so they brought their families and blankets to the Shang Qing barrier to spend the night.The governor's office did not close the doors at night, only the white-clothed guards that they saw during the day were left to patrol the surroundings.When Mo Ran and the rest arrived, there were no empty rooms in the manor. Everywhere was crowded with people. At least three or four families were huddled in a wing, there was no place to stand.In the end, the two of them could only choose a corridor to rest.There was definitely no bedding, so Mo Ran asked the guards for some straw, laid it on the ground, and carried Chu Wanning up.\"I'll have to trouble you to sleep here tonight.\"Chu Wanning said, \"It's pretty good.\"\"Is it?\" Mo Ran laughed, \"I think so too.\"He lay down beside Chu Wanning, stretched, and then put his arms behind his head, looking at the clear ceiling of the corridor.\"Shidi, look at those birds, their ability to create dreams is not bad. Although this dream is based on the memories of the lucky survivors, it can be so detailed that even the wood grains on the ceiling are so clear, it's also rare.\"Chu Wanning said, \"Feathermen are half-immortals after all, although their mana has not reached the peak, they still have some abilities that mortals cannot achieve.\"\"That's true,\" Mo Ran blinked, turned around, supported his head with his hand and looked at Chu Wanning, \"I can't sleep.\"\"\u2026\" Chu Wanning glanced at him, \"Then I'll tell you a story to cheer you up.\"He was just joking, who knew that Mo Ran's skin was so thick, he laughed, \"Alright, alright.Shidi, tell me the story of the Seven Fairies and Dong Yong. \"Chu Wanning did not expect him to take it seriously, he was stunned, then turned his face away resentfully, \"You're dreaming.You're already so old, don't you think it's embarrassing? \"Mo Ran laughed, \"Then you see, actually, people will always think about what they can't get, this has nothing to do with age.When I was young, no one told me stories to cheer me up, so I kept thinking, thinking, how good it would be if there was someone who could cheer me up.After that, no one appeared, and I grew up, so I stopped thinking about it.But I still think about it in my heart. \"Chu Wanning, \"\u2026\"\"No one told you stories when you were young, right?\"\"Yes.\"\"Haha, so you actually don't know how to tell the story of Dong Yong and the Seven Fairies, right?\"Chu Wanning, \"\u2026 What's there to say about this kind of decadent story?\"\"You don't know how to tell it, don't say anything decadent.When you grow up like this, you'll definitely be like my Shizun, a very boring person, no one will want to talk to you. \"Chu Wanning said angrily, \"Fine, don't talk to me, I'm going to sleep.\"After saying that, he lay down and closed his eyes.Mo Ran rolled around in laughter until he reached Chu Wanning's side. He looked at his little junior brother's closed eyes, his long, black eyelashes were very cute, so he reached out and pinched his face.\"You're really asleep?\"\"I'm asleep.\"\"Haha.\" Mo Ran laughed, \"Then go to sleep, I'll tell you a story.\"\"You can tell stories?\"\"Yes, just like how you can talk in your sleep.\"Chu Wanning shut up.Mo Ran lay down beside him, the two of them using the straw as pillows, their heads very close together.Mo Ran laughed for a while, but when he saw that his junior brother was ignoring him, he gradually stopped laughing so exaggeratedly, but his eyes were still curved, looking at the corridor ceiling, the rough smell of rice at the tip of his nose from time to time, and his voice was calm and peaceful.\"The story I'm going to tell you is made up by myself.In the past, no one told me a story to cheer me up, so I was very envious, but I had no choice. Every day when I lay in bed, I would tell myself a story to listen to.The one I'm going to tell you is my favorite, I gave it a name, 'Cows Eat Grass'. \"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMo Ran smiled and continued, \"A long, long time ago, there was a child.\"Chu Wanning closed his eyes, \"Wasn't it a cow eating grass?How could it be a child? \"\"Let me finish first,\" Mo Ran said with a smile. \"There was once a child who was very poor.He didn't have parents and worked as a child laborer in a landlord's house. He had to wash dishes, wash clothes, and mop the floor. He also had to herd cows.The landlord gave him three pancakes to eat every day. The child was very satisfied with being able to fill his stomach. \"\"One day, as usual, he went out to herd cows.On the way, he encountered a vicious dog that bit the cow's leg. Because of this, the child was beaten by the landlord.After the landlord beat him, he told him to kill the vicious dog to vent his anger.Otherwise, he wouldn't give the child any pancakes to eat. \"\"The child was very scared and could only follow the instructions and kill the dog and bring it back. However, when he returned home, the landlord discovered that the dog that had bitten his own cow was actually the county magistrate's beloved dog.\"Chu Wanning opened his eyes, \"Then what should he do?\"\"What else could he do?That dog was the county magistrate's favorite dog. It was used to throwing its weight around because of its master's influence.Who would have thought that it would be beaten to death so carelessly. If the county magistrate found out, he definitely wouldn't let it go easily.Thus, the more the landlord thought about it, the angrier he became. He still didn't give the child any pancakes to eat and even threatened to send him away if the county magistrate came looking for him. \"Chu Wanning, \"\u2026 What kind of nonsense is this? It's not reasonable at all. I'm not listening anymore.\"\"There are many things that are unreasonable to begin with.\" Mo Ran smiled, \"It's just a competition of who has more money, who has harder fists, and who has a higher position.The next day, the county magistrate came looking for the child.The child was sent away.Because he was too young, the county magistrate didn't want to lock him up. He ruthlessly beat him ten times with the rod and then let him out. \"Chu Wanning asked, \"Did the child run away after he was released?\"Mo Ran said, \"Haha, he didn't run away. The child went back to the landlord's house. After he recovered, he continued to herd cows for them.He still ate three pancakes every day. \"\"Isn't he angry?\"\"He won't be angry as long as he's full,\" Mo Ran said. \"So what if he gets beaten up? Let bygones be bygones.They lived together peacefully for more than ten years. Eventually, the cowherd boy grew up.The landlord's son was of the same age as him.One day, the landlord had several distinguished guests. The landlord's son saw that one of the guests had a very beautiful agate snuff bottle. He liked it very much, so he stole it. \"\"That snuff bottle was passed down from generation to generation and is very precious.The guest panicked and looked for his things all over the house.When the landlord's son saw that he could not conceal it any longer, he put the snuff-box in the hands of the cowherd, and told him that if he dared to tell the truth, he would not be given any more food, and would starve to death. \"\"\u2026 \u2026\" When Chu Wanning heard this, he was speechless. He thought that although Mo Ran had led a wandering life since he was young and lost his only child, he still grew up in the Yue Fu. His mother was also the housekeeper of the Yue Fu. Although his life was not happy, it was not miserable. Why did he have to make up such a gloomy and dark story?Mo Ran said with relish, \"The snuff-box was quickly found. In order to eat, the cowherd boy could only brace himself and confess. What awaited him was naturally another round of beating.This time, they beat him until he couldn't get out of bed for three days.When the landlord's son escaped, he secretly gave the cowherd a steamed bun with streaky pork. The child wolfed it down and no longer hated the person who harmed him.Because he had never tasted such delicious food before, he held the steamed bun and kept saying to the landlord's son, 'Thank you, thank you.' \"\"I don't want to hear it anymore.\" Chu Wanning was really angry this time. \"Why don't you hate?You don't hate a steamed bun?Thank you, what is there to thank! \"\"No.\" Mo Ran blinked innocently. \"You didn't hear it carefully.\"\"How did I not hear it carefully?\"Mo Ran said seriously, \"That was a steamed bun with streaky pork.\"Chu Wanning, \"\u2026 \u2026\"\"Haha, look at your expression. You don't understand. That child usually only eats one or two pieces of fatty meat on New Year's Eve.He originally thought that he would never know the taste of Five Flower Sandwiched Pork until he died, so of course he had to thank him. \"Seeing that his junior brother was speechless, Mo Ran smiled brilliantly and continued, \"Anyway, this matter is over.He still took his three steamed buns and lived his life day by day.One day \u2026 \u2026 \"Chu Wanning finally understood Mo Ran's way of telling stories. As long as \"one day\" appeared, it was definitely not a good thing.Sure enough, Mo Ran said, \"One day, the landlord's son committed another crime.\"\"This time, he molested a girl next door in the mill, and it was coincidentally seen by that unlucky cowherd boy.\"Chu Wanning, \"\u2026 \u2026 Don't tell me that child is going to be the scapegoat again?\"\"Oh.\" Mo Ran smiled. \"That's how it is. Congratulations, you can tell stories too.\"\"\u2026 \u2026 I'm going to sleep.\"\"Don't, it'll be over soon.\" Mo Ran said, \"This is the first time I'm telling a story to someone. Just do me the honor.\"Chu Wanning, \"\u2026 \u2026\"\"This time, the cowherd boy is definitely going to be the scapegoat.Because the girl couldn't bear the humiliation, she committed suicide by hitting the wall.But the cowherd boy isn't stupid. If someone dies, they have to pay with their life. He can't pay with his life for the landlord's son. \"Mo Ran said, \"He wasn't willing, so the landlord's son locked him and the dead girl in the mill, and then ran to report it to the authorities.\"\"This cowherd boy has a bad record. When he was young, he killed the county magistrate's dog for no reason. Then, he stole a guest's snuff bottle. This time, he even molested a girl. Of course, his crime was unforgivable.No one was willing to listen to his excuses. He was caught red-handed. \"Chu Wanning's eyes widened. \"\u2026 \u2026 And then?\"\"Then, he stayed in prison for a few months. In the autumn, he was sentenced to death and sent to the execution platform in the suburbs to be hanged.He followed the execution team and walked in the fields. Suddenly, he saw someone killing a cow not far from him.He could tell at a glance that the cow was the one he had released when he was young. It was already old and didn't have the strength to work in the fields.But even an old cow needs to eat grass. If it only eats grass and doesn't work, how could the landlord be willing to raise it?It had worked for them all its life. In the end, they had to kill it and eat its meat. \"Saying such a cruel thing, Mo Ran didn't feel sad. He smiled and said, \"But the cowherd boy grew up riding on the cow's back. He whispered to it a lot, fed it cow grass, hugged its neck and cried when he felt wronged. He treated it as his only family in the world.\"\"So, he knelt down and begged the jailer to let him say goodbye to the old cow.But the jailer naturally didn't believe that there would be any feelings between humans and animals. He thought that he was being crafty and didn't allow it. \"\"\u2026 \u2026 And then?\"\"And then?Then the cowherd boy was hanged to death.The cow was also killed.The blood flowed all over the ground. The people who were watching the show coldly dispersed. The landlord ate beef that night, but the beef was too tough and always got stuck between his teeth.They ate a little, but didn't like it, so they threw it away. \"Chu Wanning, \"\u2026 \u2026\"Mo Ran turned over and looked at him with a smile. \"I'm done.Was it good? \"Chu Wanning said, \"Get lost.\"\"The first time I made it up for myself, I cried. You're so hard hearted, you don't even cry.\"\"It's your bad storytelling \u2026 \u2026\"Mo Ran laughed and put an arm around his junior brother's shoulder. He stroked his hair. \"That can't be helped. Your senior brother only has this much ability.Alright, the story is over. Let's go to sleep. \"Chu Wanning didn't say anything. After a long time, he suddenly asked, \"Mo Ran.\"\"Call me senior brother.\"\"Why do you call it a cow eating grass?\"\"Because people and cows are the same. They all need to eat. In order to eat, they have to do many things. If one day you can't do them, no one will want you to live.\"Chu Wanning didn't say anything again.The courtyard was filled with the soft sounds of people seeking refuge. Occasionally, one or two ominous ghost howls could be heard from outside the barrier.\"Mo Ran.\"\"Aiya, you don't know anything. Call me senior brother.\"Chu Wanning ignored him and asked, \"Is there really such a child?\"\"No.\" Mo Ran was silent for a while, then suddenly smiled. His deep dimples were very pretty.He rubbed the little fellow into his arms and said gently, \"Of course it's just a story to fool you.Be good, go to sleep. \"Who knew that after a while, they suddenly heard a commotion in the courtyard.Someone shouted angrily, \"Look for the young master, look for the young master!The young master is busy. How can he have time to care about you?Get that corpse out of here!Do you know that people with blue spots on their bodies need to be revived?!Do you want to kill us? \"This voice was like a clap of thunder in the dark night. As soon as they heard the words \"raise the corpse\", everyone suddenly exploded. For a moment, those who were asleep all sat up with a grunt and looked in the direction of the noise.Mo Ran hid his junior brother behind him. He looked and frowned. He whispered, \"Hm?Is it that person from noon? \"The one who was kneeling on the ground and being scolded was the young man named Young Man from noon.He was still wearing the clothes he wore during the day, but his spirit was completely different.His entire body seemed to have been sucked dry. He only hugged his foster father's corpse tightly. The corpse's fingernails had grown a lot, which was a sign that a corpse was about to be revived. When the others saw this, they all retreated.The steward of the Administration Office was scolding him sternly.\"Your father is my colleague. I also feel bad that he was killed.But what can I do?You were the one who said you were hungry last night, so he ran out to find food for you. You tired your father to death, and now you want to tire us out? \"Young Man knelt on the ground. His hair was messy and his eyes were red. \"No, no, I'm not \u2026 Father, father.I beg you, let me see the young master. The young master has a way to prevent my father from being revived. I want to bury my father properly. Please don't \u2026 don't dismember him \u2026 Wuu \u2026 \"When he said the word \"dismember\", he was choked with sobs.He buried his face in his palms and rubbed his hands. His lips trembled. \"I beg you \u2026 let me wait for the young master to come back \u2026\"\"It's almost midnight. The young master is outside. How can he take care of you?You know that normal corpses can be purified, but your father's blue spot and fingernails have changed. How can he survive until the young master comes back? \"\"No \u2026 It's okay, Uncle Liu \u2026 I beg you, I'll be your slave. I, I'll find a way to repay you in the future. Please, don't touch my father \u2026 I beg you \u2026 I beg you \u2026\"Seeing him begging like this, the middle-aged steward sighed. His eyes were red, but he still said, \"Sigh, do you know that you're killing all of us? Guards!\"\"No!No!! \"But it was too late. No one would help him.Everyone knew that if this corpse was left, it would become an evil spirit at midnight.Young Man's foster father's corpse was forcibly dragged away to be dismembered outside.Young Man was restrained by several people on her left and right. Blood and tears ran down her cheeks. Her face was dirty, and she kept making beast-like roars. In the end, she was half dragged and half carried away.After such a disturbance, the yard gradually calmed down after a small discussion.Chu Wanning didn't sleep. He lowered his head and pondered.Mo Ran looked at his Junior Brother and asked, \"What are you thinking about?\"\"This man lost his family and did such a foolish thing.His foster father's body was taken away, so it's inevitable that he resents others.I have an uncertain guess. I wonder if the failure of Lin 'an's migration is because of him. \"Mo Ran clapped his hands and said, \"I think so too.\"Chu Wanning shook his head. \"But it's too early to jump to conclusions. Pay attention to him first.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe next day, nothing out of the ordinary happened.Chu Xun had already sent people to count the number of scarecrows in the city to see if there were enough scarecrows. Every household had also begun to pack some of the meager belongings, preparing to leave the city for Mount Putuo the next morning under Chu Xun's arrangement to take refuge.Mo Ran sat at the entrance of the government office, looking at the people coming and going. He sighed and said, \"Chu Xun's arrangement was very thorough. If no one leaked the information, with the intelligence of a normal ghost, it would be difficult to quickly distinguish that the people left in the city were all puppets.It seems that there really was a leak.Shidi, what do you think? \"No one responded.\"Hey?Shidi? \"Mo Ran turned his head. Unknowingly, his youngest Shidi had walked to the side to look at the cavalry that was ready to set off. Instead, it was Young Master Chu's son who silently came to his side and sat with his chin resting on his hand.\"Big Brother \u2026\"Mo Ran was startled by his sudden appearance, \"What's wrong?\"The little guy pointed at an old tree next to him, on which a kite was hanging. He said with a lisp, \"Mother left it for me. It flew up and I can't get it down.Big Brother, can you help me? \"\"Of course, of course.\"Mo Ran floated to the top of the tree with his lightness skill. He picked up the butterfly kite and steadily landed back on the ground. He handed the kite to the little guy and said with a smile, \"Hold it well, don't lose it again.\"The little guy nodded in confusion.Mo Ran saw him wandering around alone and thought that Chu Xun didn't have time to take care of his son. He asked him, \"Where's your mother?There are a lot of people here, I'll take you to your mother. \"\"Mother?Mother is at the back of the mountain. \"Mo Ran asked curiously, \"What are you doing at the back of the mountain?\"\"Sleeping.\" The little guy opened his round eyes and said softly, \"Mother always sleeps there.She blossoms in the spring, so Father often takes me to see her. \"Mo Ran let out a soft \"ah\" and was speechless for a moment.On the other hand, the little girl didn't seem to care at all. It seemed that because she was still young, she didn't understand the so-called life and death. She happily played with the kite in her hand. Then, she raised her head and looked at Mo Ran. Suddenly, she moved closer and said in a crisp voice, \"Big Brother, thank you. I'll give you \u2026 I have something to give you.\"As he spoke, he began to rummage in his pocket. He rummaged and rummaged until he pulled out a small piece of pastry wrapped in a reed leaf.These days, everyone in Lin 'an City was starving and could not eat their fill. He wondered how this little thing could save such a snack.He broke the pastry into two halves, keeping the big one and giving the small one to Mo Ran.\"Big brother, you eat \u2026 Shh, don't tell anyone, I don't have more.\"Just as Mo Ran was about to reach out to take it, the little guy suddenly changed his mind. After thinking for a while, he took back the small piece and handed the big one to him.\"It's delicious. There's red bean paste.\"This small action made Mo Ran's heart suddenly feel warm and sour. He had always been used to others treating him badly, so he didn't know how to deal with sudden good things.He reached out to take the flower cake and murmured thanks.The little guy seemed very happy because of this. He raised his face and smiled brightly. His black eyelashes curled gently.Mo Ran took the flower cake. He was reluctant to eat it, so he went to the side and picked a piece of pine leaf. He wrapped the flower cake and put it in his clothes.He wanted to say a few more words to the little guy, but after all, a child was a child. He couldn't stay in one place for too long. He had already turned around and jumped away.At this time, Chu Wanning came over. Seeing Mo Ran standing there in a daze, he slightly raised his eyebrows and asked, \"What's wrong?\"Mo Ran looked at the back of the little guy and sighed, \"I'm thinking, why did so many people suddenly die?\"At night, the sky was covered with dark clouds. From time to time, blue and purple thunder tore the sky.In the second half of the night, the wind was blowing, and the rain was coming.The rain was of the Yin attribute, which would make the power of the ghosts stronger.So that night, Chu Xun asked all the survivors of Lin 'an to gather near the governor's office and not to step out of the enchantment of Shang Qing.Because of the heavy rain, many places where people could barely sleep were ruined.At first, Mo Ran could keep track of Young Man's whereabouts, but as more and more people crowded in to take shelter from the rain, Young Man disappeared.Mo Ran whispered, \"Not good.\"Chu Wanning was small, so he immediately said, \"I'll go and see.\"After saying that, he hid in the crowd. He was immediately squeezed by the dense crowd and couldn't see his back.After a while, Chu Wanning came back. His eyes were gloomy, and he said coldly, \"She escaped.\"\"Out of the enchantment?\"\"Yes.\"Mo Ran didn't speak. He looked at the pouring rain outside and the people of the governor's office who were busy in the rain.These were just illusions from two hundred years ago. Everything had become a fact.But suddenly he felt a little sad. The women and children around him were full of hope, thinking that after dawn, Chu Xun would take them away from this ghost town and take refuge in Putuo.In the heavy rain, the guards in white and red hoods were wholeheartedly making the last defense for the migration when dawn came.They didn't know that they wouldn't live long.It was late at night, and the noisy people were sleeping on each other's pillows.However, Chu Wanning and Mo Ran were not sleepy at all. What they needed to do was to kill the Ghost King as soon as it appeared.Since Young Man had run out of the enchantment, the change must be tonight.Mo Ran looked at Chu Wanning and said, \"You sleep. I'll wake you up if something happens.\"Chu Wanning said, \"I'm not sleepy.\"Mo Ran stroked his hair. \"Then eat something.You haven't eaten since you came here. \"\"I \u2026\" The word \"not hungry\" was replaced by the action of swallowing silently when he saw the flower cake Mo Ran took out.Mo Ran handed the cake to him. \"You eat it.\"Chu Wanning took the cake and broke it in half. He gave the big one to Mo Ran and held the small one himself.Mo Ran looked at his actions blankly. No one knew what he was thinking.After taking a bite of the cake, Chu Wanning suddenly murmured, and then asked, \"Did you buy this in the Peach Blossom Spring?Why is the taste different from before? \"\"What's wrong?\"\"The osmanthus fragrance is so strong.\"Mo Ran smiled bitterly. \"Really?Chu Xun's son gave it to me. It's probably the flavor of Lin 'an. \"\"It's indeed the flavor of Lin 'an.\"Chu Wanning silently took a second bite, but when he opened his mouth a little, he suddenly froze, as if he suddenly realized something. The blood on his face suddenly faded.\"Something's wrong!\"Chu Wanning suddenly got up. His eyes were wide open, and his face was extremely ugly.Mo Ran didn't know what was wrong. \"What's wrong?\"Chu Wan Ning did not reply. Instead, she stood up and walked into the courtyard. Braving the heavy rain, she looked around. Then, she picked up a sharp stone and made a deep cut on her arm. In an instant, blood splattered everywhere.Mo Ran hurriedly pulled him. \"Are you crazy?\"Chu Wanning stared at the meandering bloodstains on his arm for a while. Then, he suddenly raised his head. His eyes flashed with lightning and were extremely fierce. \"Don't you know what happened?\" He said sternly. \"Someone wants to harm us!\"Blood kept flowing down his arm, and was washed into a light pink by the rain.In the pouring rain, Chu Wanning's face was pale and stern. His dark eyebrows were deeply furrowed. The raindrops closed tightly, making him wet all over.With a boom, thunder broke through the sky. In an instant, the dark night was illuminated as if it was daytime.Mo Ran also suddenly reacted in this thunder and couldn't help but take a step back.He also knew what was wrong.The so-called virtual world, no matter how real the things inside were, were all fake.Pastries couldn't really have taste, and sharp weapons couldn't really hurt people.In a word, the things in the virtual world couldn't have any effect on them.\"Someone made the virtual world real,\" Chu Wanning said softly.The virtual world was a very difficult spell to perform. It was also called the \"Way of Illusion and Reality.\"The one who was best at this spell was the \"Lonemoon Night\" of the Ten Great Sects. This sect's motto was \"To help the world, to heal the heart with divine hands\". The latter part of the sentence meant that some of them specialized in the Way of Illusion and Reality, and made a virtual world real.There were many people in the world who couldn't accept the death of their relatives, but through the \"Way of Illusion and Reality\", they could make a virtual world where the dead lived and accompanied the living.However, because this kind of virtual world was very difficult to control, usually, only a short scene could be made.For example, drinking with an old friend, sleeping together, and so on, at most one thing.However, this virtual world made by the feathermen was huge and vast. It lasted for a long time and involved a lot of things. To make all of this real, even the sect leader of the Lonemoon Night might not be able to do it.Mo Ran immediately thought of a person. He thought to himself \u2014 could it be the fake North Star at Jin Chenghu?However, before he could think further, he suddenly heard a strange explosion in the sky.Those who were sleeping woke up like frightened birds. They opened their frightened and haggard eyes and looked around. Then, they saw the sky.After a moment of dead silence, the screams exploded like water splashing in boiling oil.Everyone ran in all directions, but they realized that there was nowhere to go. There were screams everywhere.A crack appeared in the sky, and a huge blood-red ghost's eye was glaring at the top of the barrier.The eye was so close that it was almost touching the opening of the barrier.A murky and cold voice rumbled, \"Chu Xun, how dare you. You're just a mortal and you want to fool me.\"Mo Ran muttered, \"It's the Ghost King \u2026\"There were nine kings in the Ghost World, and their mana was very different. At this time, he had not appeared, so it was unknown which king it was.There was only that bloody eyeball in the sky, staring at the mansion below, \"You're overestimating yourself, ridiculous!Ridiculous mortals \u2014 you want to save them?I might not have killed everyone in the city, but since you want to go against me \u2014 I'll kill everyone in the city!Not even a chicken or dog will be left alive! \"Following a scream, a blinding red light burst out from the center of the ghost's eye, slashing towards the Shang Qing barrier!In an instant, the sky changed color, and gold and red met!Sand and stones flew in the storm, and the trees in the courtyard were destroyed. The people under the barrier were in a mess, crying and wailing.The Shang Qing enchantment withstood the first attack, but then another ray of red light struck down, striking the same spot again. The enchantment withstood the heavy machine again, but this time, there were cracks appearing.\"You're overestimating yourself \u2014 how hateful!!!\"Beams of red light hit the barrier one after another, bursting into clusters of sparks.Seeing that the barrier was about to crack, Chu Wanning knew that it was not good \u2014 since this virtual world had been solidified, the opponent's attack was no different from the attack in the real world.If the attack landed, he and Mo Ran would most likely die in the Emptiness Realm!Chu Wanning thought, and the golden light was already shining between his fingers.If he used his big move now, his identity would be seen through by Mo Ran, but there was no other way.He was about to summon Tianwen to end the battle quickly.Suddenly, a colorful light pierced through the sky like a sharp arrow, piercing through the clouds and piercing the gap of the barrier!Everyone looked back and saw Chu Xun walking in the rain from the roof beam.He held a phoenix-headed konghou in his arm, and his fingertips plucked the strings of the konghou.The sound of the zither was sharp, like the cracking of metal and stone. Beams of light were drawn out and gathered in the sky.In an instant, the Shang Qing barrier that was in danger was re-strengthened.\"It's the Young Master!\"\"Young Master!\"The people below shouted, and some were crying with joy.Chu Xun fought against the Ghost King's eye technique, and he was not at a disadvantage. In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged hundreds of moves, and the Ghost King could not even get close to the barrier.The cold voice in the air became gloomier.\"Chu Xun, with your ability, no one can hurt you if you run for your life. Why are you meddling in other people's business and making an enemy of the Ghost World?\"\"You want to hurt the people of Lin 'an City, how is that meddling in other people's business?\"\"Ridiculous!Ghosts usually eat the souls of living people. My clan eats souls, just like you eat meat and vegetables. What's the difference?When you're dead, you'll see it clearly! \"Chu Xun answered naturally, and the sound of the zither did not stop, \"Then let's see if you have the ability to take my head.\"As he spoke, the sound of the zither became more urgent and louder. In the end, it was a dragon light that shone through the sky and pierced the ferocious bloody eye in the rainy night!\"Ah \u2013!!!\"The mournful and terrifying roar shook the heavens and the earth.The eye was burned by Chu Xun's technique, and smelly blood splashed everywhere. In an instant, the sky was filled with blood, and the ghosts were crying.Under the anger of the other party, a beam of light that was several times stronger than before slashed horizontally in the bloody rain.Chu Xun shook his sleeve to block, but this blow was the Ghost King's violent attack. Under the confrontation between the two sides, Chu Xun was shaken by the wave of air and stagnated.\"Young Master \u2013!\"\"Crack!There's a crack!The barrier is going to break! \"\"Mother \u2013 mother \u2013\"Everyone in the porridge was in a state of panic. Some relatives cried and hugged each other, while others curled up in a corner and shivered.Chu Xun gritted his teeth, and his eyes were like torches, but he was unwilling to give up so easily.In the difficult stalemate, a ray of light suddenly lit up on his left and right.He glanced sideways, and saw that Mo Ran and Chu Wanning had already moved forward. The golden light and the red light surged and merged with him, sealing the barrier again.A ferocious roar came from the sky.The ghost eye disappeared.The three of them landed on the ground. The smelly blood in the sky continued to fall for a while, and then slowly turned back into transparent rain.Chu Xun's face was pale, and he bowed to Mo Ran and Chu Wanning, \"Thank you for your help.\"\"You're welcome,\" Mo Ran waved his hand, \"You should rest, you don't look good.\"Chu Xun nodded. He had indeed used up a lot of his mana, so Mo Ran helped him to the corridor to rest.The panicked people saw that Young Master Chu had repaired the hole and saved them. They were all very grateful.They all gathered around, and some even handed him water and put on his clothes.Someone said, \"Young Master Chu, your clothes are soaked, why don't you go to the fire and dry yourself.\"Chu Xun thanked them one by one, but because he was too tired, he didn't want to move anymore, so he politely declined their invitation.Those people weren't discouraged, and simply brought some pine branches over, and built a fire pit next to Chu Xun.The surroundings gradually quieted down, and only the crackling of the fire could be heard.Suddenly, a citizen asked him, \"Young Master, we arranged it so carefully, how did the Ghost King see through it?Sigh, what should we do? \"\"Yes, yes.\"\"How did he know we were going to move?Young Master clearly said that this ghost couldn't tell the difference between a puppet and a living person. What's going on \u2026 Could it be \u2026 \"The speaker's voice gradually trailed off as he turned to steal a glance at Chu Xun.He clearly wanted to ask if Chu Xun had made a mistake, if Chu Xun hadn't figured it out.This gaze was seen by the white-clothed guards of the governor's office, and one of them immediately said angrily, \"What are you thinking!Someone must have leaked the news and let the Ghost King know! \"That person muttered, \"Who would leak information to ghosts and monsters?It won't do any good \u2026 \u2026 \"But when he saw that the people around him were glaring at him, he resentfully stopped talking.After a moment of silence, another person asked,\"Young Master, that ghost old man definitely won't let this go, what should we do next?\"Chu Xun was very tired, so he didn't open his eyes, but he still said in a gentle voice, \"It'll be fine as long as we can hold on until dawn. After that, we'll leave the city and hurry on our way, they won't be able to do anything during the day.\"\"But there are so many of us, old and young, and some are even injured, can we make it to Mount Putuo in one day?\"Chu Xun said warmly, \"Don't worry, all of you should rest.Tomorrow, you just need to hurry on your way, I'll think of a way. \"It had always been the young master who protected them, and since he said so, everyone obediently agreed. A child came over, holding a small piece of sesame candy, and wanted to give it to Chu Xun.Chu Xun slightly opened his eyes, smiled and touched the child's hair, and was about to say something, when suddenly a guard ran over in panic and shouted, \"Young Master!Young Master, something bad happened! \"\"What happened?\"\"Young Master, Young Master \u2026 \u2026 Young Man \u2026 \u2026 Outside the City God Temple \u2026 \u2026\" That person was obviously greatly affected, and couldn't say a complete sentence. He stuttered, and suddenly knelt on the ground with a thump, and cried loudly.Chu Xun suddenly got up, and the last trace of blood on his face disappeared, and he ran into the rain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Shing Wong Temple was at the edge of Chu Xun's power. The steps of the Shing Wong Temple could still be protected by the enchantment, but the temple itself could no longer be covered by the enchantment.In the temple, the lights were dim.More than ten ghosts who had rebuilt their bodies stood on both sides. A woman in red was tied up with her back to the crowd. She was looking up at the statue on the table.Beside her, Young Man stood with her eyes down. She was restraining a young child.Chu Xun shouted, \"Lan Er!\"This child was none other than Chu Xun's son, Chu Lan.Mo Ran's heart tightened. The taste of half a piece of cake was still in his mouth. He saw that the young master was restrained and wanted to go forward, but he was stopped by Chu Wanning.\"Don't go.\"\"Why!\"Chu Wanning looked at him and said softly, \"They're all people who died two hundred years ago.Now that this illusion has become reality, I'm afraid you'll be hurt. \"\"\u2026\" Only then did Mo Ran realize that this was indeed the case. No matter what he did, a dead person was still dead. Nothing could change it.The young master cried outside the enchantment. He shouted vaguely, \"Father!Father, save me!Father, save Lan Er! \"Chu Xun's lips trembled slightly. He shouted at Young Man, \"What are you doing?I didn't treat you badly. Let go of him! \"Young Man turned a deaf ear to him. She lowered her head as if she didn't hear anything. But the hesitation in his heart could be seen from his hands that were holding Chu Lan. There was a mole between his thumb and index finger on his left hand. The veins on the back of his hand were bulging and trembling.At this time, the people who had gathered to take refuge in the government also came. When they saw the scene in the temple, they couldn't help but be shocked and angry. They whispered,\"That's the young master's son \u2026\"\"How could this be \u2026\"Young Man raised the knife in her hand and released the rope of the woman in red. That woman came back to her senses and slowly turned her head. She was extremely beautiful, as pure as a lotus flower, with a long and delicate neck. It was just that her face was as pale as paper, but her lips were as red as blood. The way she smiled at Chu Xun was more frightening than charming.The illusory candlelight illuminated her beautiful face. The moment they saw her face, Chu Xun and some of the older people in the crowd behind him all froze.The woman's smile was tinged with sadness. She said softly, \"Husband.\"Mo Ran, \"!!!\"Chu Wanning, \"\u2026\"This woman was none other than Chu Xun's deceased wife!Mrs. Chu's eyes moved, she wanted to take her son from Young Man.At first, Young Man was unwilling, but Mrs. Chu, as a member of the Ghost Clan, was much stronger than him after breaking free from the shackles. With a little effort, she snatched the child away.Unfortunately, she died of an epidemic disease before the child was a month old. Therefore, the young master had never seen his mother. For a time, he cried and shouted for his father, asking Chu Xun to save him.\"Good child, don't cry. Mother will take you to find your father.\"Madam Chu's slender arms picked up the child and carried him out of the temple. She walked along the rain-soaked bluestone steps all the way to the enchantment of Shang Qing. She stood in front of Chu Xun, her eyebrows showing both joy and sorrow, sadness and joy.\"Husband, we haven't seen each other for years. You \u2026 how have you been?\"Chu Xun, however, couldn't say a single word. His drooping fingertips couldn't stop trembling. His pair of phoenix eyes stared at the woman behind the barrier, and his eyes gradually turned red.Mrs. Chu said softly, \"Lan 'er is so big now. You are much calmer. You are a little different from what I thought.\u2026 Let me take a good look at you. \"As she said, she reached out and put her hand on the enchantment. However, because of her ghostly body, she couldn't cross it. She could only look at the people behind her silently.Chu Xun closed his eyes, but his eyelashes were already wet.He also raised his hand. Separated by the enchantment, he pressed his palm against Mrs. Chu's. He opened his eyes again. The two looked at each other in life and death. It was like yesterday.Chu Xun choked with sobs, \"Madam \u2026\"The family had been separated by life and death for many years. The days they spent together could be counted with fingers.\"Did the begonia flowers I planted in the courtyard that year survive?\"Chu Xun smiled, but his eyes were full of tears, \"They are all as beautiful as a pavilion.\"Mrs. Chu seemed to be happy. She said warmly, \"That's really good.\"Chu Xun also tried his best to smile, saying, \"Lan 'er liked that begonia tree the most. In spring, he always played under the tree.He liked begonia flowers as much as you. Every year \u2026 every Qingming Festival \u2026 \"He said until here, but he couldn't make a happy face anymore. His forehead touched the edge of the enchantment. Tears kept rolling down his face. He was already sobbing,\" Every Qingming Festival, he would pick the most beautiful one and put it in front of mother's grave.Wan 'er, Wan' er, did you see it?Every year \u2026 Every year, did you see it? \"In the end, his sobs broke. Every word was sobbing. He didn't look like a gentleman anymore.Mrs. Chu's eyes were also red. However, because she was a ghost, she couldn't cry. Her expression was sad, but it made people feel sad.For a moment, there was silence. No one said anything. They all looked at the scene in front of them silently. Some people were sobbing.However, at this time, a cold voice came from the sky.\"Of course she knows, but soon, she won't.\"Mo Ran's expression changed, \"It's the Ghost King!\"Chu Wanning was also very gloomy, \"Shameless villain, you don't dare to show yourself!\"The Ghost King laughed. It was like his sharp nails were tearing at the bottom of a pot. It made people's hair stand on end.\"Lin Wan 'er is already part of the Ghost Clan. Originally, I didn't want to hurt her. However, you want to go against me and destroy one of my eyes. I will dig out your heart and liver and make you feel more pain than I do!\"As the Ghost King finished speaking, the dozen or so ghosts in the temple opened their mouths and chanted spells.\"The mundane heart is dead, the past is gone \u2014\"Mrs. Chu suddenly opened her eyes wide and said in a trembling voice, \"Husband, Lan 'er, take Lan' er!\"\"The mundane heart is dead, the past is gone \u2014\"\"Lan 'er!Quickly!Quickly go to your father! \"Mrs. Chu pushed the child, wanting to pass him through the barrier. However, the young master was blocked outside by the barrier like a ghost. He couldn't return.Young Man stood in front of the temple railings and looked down at them. Her face seemed sad and happy. Her originally handsome face was almost twisted.\"It's useless.I followed the Ghost King's instructions and put the Ghost Clan's mark on him. He is now like a ghost and can't enter Shang Qing's barrier. \"The chanting behind her was like a tide, rising and falling continuously, \"The mundane heart is dead, the wisdom is gone \u2014\"\"Husband!\"Madam Chu was already panicking to the extreme. She hugged the child in her arms and knocked on the outside of the barrier. \"Husband, remove the barrier, remove the barrier and let Lan 'er in. You protect him, you protect him \u2014 I \u2014 I'm almost \u2026 I \u2026\"\"The mundane heart is dead, the compassion is gone \u2014\"\"Husband \u2014!!!\"Mrs. Chu knelt down with a thud. Her eyes were wide open and she couldn't stop trembling. A blood-red curse mark was gradually climbing up her face, \"Child \u2014 Lan 'er \u2026 you promised me to take good care of him \u2026 remove \u2026 I beg you \u2026 remove \u2026 husband!!\"Chu Xun's heart was already broken. He raised his hand several times to cast a spell, but in the end, he dropped it again.Outside, Chu Lan was bawling her eyes out. Her face was full of tears as she raised her head. She reached out her small hands and cried, \"Father, don't you want Lan 'er anymore \u2026? Father, hug Lan' er \u2026 Father, hug \u2026\"Mrs. Chu couldn't stop hugging him and kissing the child's cheeks. One of them was kneeling while the other was crying. They were both begging Chu Xun to remove the barrier and let the child pass.Suddenly, someone in the crowd shouted, \"Master!You can't!If you can't remove the barrier, the remaining hundreds of people in Lin 'an will die \u2014 this is the Ghost Clan's scheme!Master!You can't remove it! \"\"Yes, the barrier can't be removed!\"The desire to live made the commoners kneel down and kowtow to Chu Xun one after another. They all stammered, \"Master, I beg you, the barrier can't be removed!If it's removed, everyone will die! \"\"Madam, I beg of you \u2026\" Someone even knelt down and kowtowed to Madam Chu. \"Madam, you are benevolent, you have the heart of a Bodhisattva. We will be deeply grateful for your kindness for the rest of our lives. I beg of you, don't let the young master remove the barrier.In an instant, except for the guards of the Governor's Office and a few commoners who didn't kneel down and beg, the rest of the people cried and shouted. The momentum instantly overshadowed the pleas of Mrs. Chu and the Little Master outside the barrier.Chu Xun felt as if he was standing on a sharp awl, and as if his lungs were being pierced by tens of thousands of sharp knives. The blades grew thorns in his flesh, crushing his internal organs.In front of him were his wife and children, behind him were the lives of a hundred people.In this kind of torture, he seemed to have died, engulfed by fire, and his bones turned to ashes.However, the ghosts' chanting didn't stop, but became sharper.\"The mortal heart is dead, the seven emotions are annihilated \u2014\"\"The mortal heart is dead, the six desires are annihilated \u2014\"There were more and more runes on Mrs. Chu's face, climbing all the way up from her white neck, almost covering her entire face.They soaked into her eyes.It seemed that it was difficult for her to make a complete sound in her throat. She only looked at her husband in despair and murmured broken words.\"If you \u2026 I \u2026 will \u2026 hate you \u2026 you \u2026 Lan 'er \u2026 I hate \u2026 I \u2026\"The runes soaked into her eyes. Her weak body suddenly trembled, as if she was in severe pain, and she closed her eyes tightly.\"I \u2014 hate!!!\"Suddenly, there was a shrill scream, but the ending sound became a beast-like roar!Mrs. Chu suddenly opened her eyes, and there was blood in her eyes. There were four pupils in her originally soft almond eyes, and they were close to each other, squeezing out all the white of her eyes.\"Wan 'er!!\"Chu Xun was in extreme grief. For a moment, he forgot that the Shang Qing enchantment must be in the middle of the enchantment to be effective. He only wanted to reunite with his beloved wife. However, the moment he was about to step out of the enchantment, an arrow suddenly pierced through the air. With a whoosh, it accurately and fiercely pierced into his shoulder, stopping him from reaching out his hand.It was a young man from the governor's office, still in the posture of drawing his bow and shooting.The young man's hood fluttered, and he said to Chu Xun righteously, \"Young master!Wake up!You usually teach us that there is a Dao, that all living things are the leader, and that we are the last. Are all these empty words?Once the matter falls on your shoulders, you want to pay for the life of one person with the lives of hundreds of people?! \"An old woman beside the young man trembled and said, \"You, you put down the bow. How can you hurt the young master? Everything, everything is the young master's choice. The young master has already done everything he can. How, how can you \u2026 You are ungrateful!!\"However, before they finished arguing, they suddenly heard a scream in front of them.Madam Chu had completely gone berserk. She was originally hugging her child so lovingly, but now she was no different from a wild beast. She howled at the sky, saliva dripping from her mouth, and her teeth suddenly grew.Chu Lan, who was in her arms, had cried herself hoarse. However, between her broken sobs, she still called out intermittently, \"Mother \u2026\"What answered him was Madam Chu's blood-red claws piercing through his throat!!!Between heaven and earth, there was no sound.Flowers of blood were flying one by one.It was as if that year, the begonia flowers had bloomed. Madam Chu stood in front of the window with her newborn child in her arms, looking at the gentle fragrance in the courtyard, and the bright red flowers scattered everywhere.The mother gently rocked the child in her arms, and softly hummed, \"Red begonia, Huang Haitang, how melodious is the morning breeze.Little Tong Xianghe is far away, making one miss Father and Mother. \"Red begonia \u2026 Huang Haitang \u2026Years ago, she lovingly stroked Chu Lan's hand, but now she was tearing apart Chu Lan's head, limbs, and flesh.How melodious is the morning breeze.The heavy rain poured, and blood flowed. The mother ate the child's intestines.Little Tong Xianghe is far away.The eaves of the City God Temple were majestic, solemn, and compassionate.That year, the child was reborn. The mother knelt in front of the City God Temple, and put her warm and slender hands together. The bell rang, and the birds scattered. Amidst the incense and candles, she stood up and kowtowed, wishing her child good fortune and good health, a long life, and a peaceful life \u2026Making one miss Father and Mother.Chu Lan's flesh was crushed. Chu Lan's heart was dug out, and was greedily chewed by Madam Chu. Fresh blood flowed down the corner of her mouth.\"Ah ah ah ah ah!!!!\"Chu Xun finally broke down. He knelt on the ground, held his head, and kowtowed continuously. Blood flowed out.He cried heartbreakingly. He knelt in the rain, in the blood, in front of his wife and children, in front of the people of Lin 'an City. He knelt in front of the god's statue, and knelt in the mud.He knelt in sin, and knelt in holiness.He knelt in gratitude, and knelt in hatred.He stooped into the dust, and his soul was torn apart and destroyed.He grieved for Wan Gu Chen.After a long time, someone finally spoke with a trembling voice.\"Young master \u2026\"\"Young master, please restrain your grief \u2026\"\"Young master's great kindness will never be forgotten \u2026\"\"Young master Chu is a righteous man. What a good man!What a good man \u2026 \"Some people hugged their children tightly and covered their children's eyes to prevent them from seeing this hideous scene.At this moment, he finally dared to let go of his hand. With a pale face, he said to Chu Xun, \"Young master, our lives are all saved by you. Madam and Young Master will definitely \u2026 ascend to paradise \u2026\"Another person scolded, \"Take your child and get lost!Why don't you ascend to paradise with your child?! \"The man then timidly retreated far away.However, these quarrels were so far away that Chu Xun felt that he was already dead.Listening to their voices, it was as if they were coming from the ocean of the past.In the rainstorm, the man was covered in filth. That layer of transparent film separated him from his wife and children. White bones were exposed, and tears and snot were everywhere.Mo Ran looked at the scene in front of him and suddenly thought of his previous life. When he killed the innocent, did he give birth to more than one Chu Xun, more than one Chu Lan, and more than one Madam Chu?He suddenly lowered his head and looked at his hands.For a moment, he vaguely saw that his hands were covered in blood.However, in the blink of an eye, he realized that it was still cold rain. Dripping on his palm, it gathered into a stream.He trembled slightly.However, in the next moment, his hand was held.He seemed to have suddenly awakened from a nightmare. He turned his eyes and saw that his Junior Brother was looking at him with concern.That child looked so similar to the dead Chu Lan.Mo Ran slowly knelt down until they were at the same level.Like a sinner asking for forgiveness in front of a returnee, he looked at him with a pair of eyes stained with rain and tears.Chu Wanning did not speak. He raised his tender little hand and patted his head.\"It's all in the past,\" Chu Wanning said softly, \"It's all in the past.\"\"Yes,\" after a while, Mo Ran smiled sadly and lowered his eyes. He muttered, \"It's all in the past.\"However, even if it was all in the past, it was all in the past.However, these were all things that he had done. Although he had never killed Chu Lan, how many people like Chu Lan had died because of him?The more Mo Ran thought about it, the more frightened and pained he felt.Why was he so cruel and merciless \u2026 why was he so stubborn \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After all, Chu Xun suffered such torture. Not to mention whether he will resent, even if he is still willing to lead everyone out of the encirclement, with this kind of mind, he is afraid that it will be disastrous.However, not everyone only has themselves in their eyes. Although there are not many who sincerely feel sorry for Chu Xun, at least there are some.Everyone is waiting for daybreak in this kind of anxiety.However, what comes earlier than the sun is that familiar cold voice. It explodes in the heavy night, reverberating above the barrier.This time, the Ghost King is not talking to Chu Xun, but to the people in the city.\"The sky will be bright soon. I know that you want to take advantage of the day to leave the city.However, have you really thought it through?Mount Putuo is very far away from here, it is impossible to reach within a day.When it is dark, you will have to rely on Chu Xun's power to protect you.But can Chu Xun really protect you? \"\"Mother \u2013\"A child hears this terrible voice and cries in fright, curling up in his mother's arms.Everyone looks up at the sky.Chu Xun stands in front of the residence, but as if he didn't hear, he leans against the begonia tree with his eyes closed.\"His wife and child died because of you, do you think he will sincerely protect you?I am afraid he has other plans, to make you live a life worse than death, so that he can avenge his wife and child.This is human nature \u2026 I have also lived, I was also once a human.Although there are benevolent people in the world, it is only for the sake of a good reputation. Human nature is evil, the so-called good people all have their own motives.If they are forced to a dead end, why should they care about the life and death of others? \"The Ghost King's eerie voice continues to echo.\"I have said before, I originally did not want to take the lives of your entire city.One must know that even if you are alive, you can still serve the Ghost Clan.If you don't believe me, take a look at him. \"As his voice fell, a black cloud rolled and surged outside the Bounded Domain. It was Young Man standing on the top.Beside him stood a man in his forties or fifties. He looked kind and honest.Someone exclaimed, \"It's Young Man's father!\"\"It's Young Man's father!Isn't his father dead? \"\"The corpse was dismembered. Everyone saw it. How could this be?!\"The Ghost King said, \"I am one of the Nine Kings of the Ghost Race. Although I can't control life and death like the Yama Emperor, I can still restore the appearance of the dead.Serve me, and you will be able to accompany your loved ones who have passed away.As for those who disobey me, they will end up like your Young Master Chu. Seeing his wife kill his child with his own eyes, he will be heartbroken, but he will be powerless to reverse the situation. \"There was dead silence inside the barrier.\"Do you really want to believe him?Do you believe that he won't harm you and avenge your wives and children? \"\"Do you really believe that he can help you escape to Putuo?\"Someone looked at Chu Xun. His eyes began to flicker with a gloomy light.Chu Xun finally raised his head. He stood alone under the tree and looked at them quietly.He really didn't know what to say. After a long time, he said, \"Things have already come to this. What's the use of me harming you?\"\"Hahahahaha \u2014 \u2014\" The Ghost King's hair-raising roar echoed in the air above the barrier, \"Great, great. He won't harm you.If you believe him, then let him do as he pleases.But if you believe me \u2014 \u2014 \"His voice became louder and louder. It almost tore people's eardrums and pierced their hearts.\"If you believe me, you will immediately be rewarded.I can let your dead loved ones return to your side. As long as you hand over Chu Xun, as long as you hand him over \u2014 \u2014 hand him over to me!I have a deep grudge with him. It has nothing to do with you. Hand over Chu Xun, and you don't have to leave your home. Hand over Chu Xun, and you can reunite with your family. Call him out, and everything will be over. \"The Ghost King said faintly.\"Before dawn, I will wait at the City God Pavilion.\"His voice disappeared.The dead silence in the crowd slowly turned into a strange noise. Everyone looked in Chu Xun's direction.Chu Xun also looked at them. His expression was calm. It could even be said that he was at peace.Someone began to helplessly murmur, \"What to do \u2026 \u2026\"\"What to do, husband, I'm so scared \u2026 \u2026\"\"Mother, I'm scared. I don't want to be eaten!\"There were even people who lowered their voice and said, \"The Ghost King is right \u2026 \u2026 The so-called good people all have their own motives. We have seen many disgusting officials like this before. Although Young Master Chu hasn't done anything right now, but look at his appearance. His spirit has left his body. Who knows what kind of crazy things he will do in the future!\"Someone heard his words and didn't refute. Instead, they whispered in agreement, \"You're right. When the time comes, he will take revenge and harm all of us!Betraying at the last minute, this kind of thing has happened before in the past \u2026 \u2026 \"Suddenly, a man rushed out and shouted, \"Catch him!Catch him and we can live! \"No one made a sound. After a long time, a young woman stood out and blocked him. Her voice was soft but firm, \"How can a man repay kindness with enmity?\"\"Get lost!\"That man kicked the girl to the ground and spat on her face, \"You're a smelly whore who sleeps with men. You don't have anything to worry about. What right do you have to speak?I have old and young at home. I can't let my family be wronged!Young Master Chu, I'm sorry! \"After saying that, she went to catch Chu Xun.Unexpectedly, before she could take a step, her leg was firmly held by someone.That man lowered his head and flew into a rage, \"Smelly whore, you dare to stop me?Do you want everyone to die with you? \"The girl angrily said, \"Although I'm a brothel girl, I can distinguish right from wrong.Even cats and dogs know how to repay kindness, let alone people? \"\"Go to your mother!\"The man kicked her face a few more times, until her face was bruised.At this time, other people also surrounded Chu Xun. Although there were a few people in the crowd who wanted to stop like this brothel girl, they were powerless in the end.Like a floating leaf in a torrent, they were quickly washed away.\"Young Master \u2014 \u2014 Young Master, quickly leave!\"There was also an old woman trembling as she shouted to Chu Xun, \"Young Master Chu, go!Go!Don't stay for this group of animals anymore!Go! \"There was also a young child's voice, \"Don't beat him, Mother, Father, don't hurt Young Master, don't hurt Young Master \u2014 \u2014\"The crowd was bustling with noise and excitement.Chu Xun stood alone in the rain. It was as if he saw a lot of ghosts crawling out from the depths of hell. For a moment, he wanted to leave.But his gaze fell on the living people who were crying and shouting. He looked at the children who were wailing and persuading their parents. He looked at the girl who stood out first and was already bruised and swollen. He looked at the old woman whose white hair was trembling in the wind and rain. There were also a dozen or so people who had their backs to him, trying to stop him.He wanted to leave, but his footsteps stopped.They were not wrong. If the barrier was removed, these people would also die.It turned out that the most disgusting thing in the world was not the devil, but those cowardly animals. They did not have the ability, but in order to live, they put on human skin and mixed in with the crowd. As long as they could live, they would do anything, say anything.In the end, they would say, \"I also just want to live. I am also very pitiful, very helpless. What did I do wrong?\"He used to think that the people he protected were all weak and kind people. But he was wrong.Only today did those beasts take off their human skins, revealing scarlet, ugly, and hideous faces that were grinning ferociously, one after another \u2026 \u2026They hid so well \u2026 \u2026 they hid so well.He didn't want to shed blood and tears for those animals dressed in human clothing, but they were so cunning, hiding among the good people. Each of their faces laughed freely and happily, laughing at Chu Xun's helplessness.\u2014 \u2014 You have to save us. If you remove the barrier, we will pull the people you want to save, pull the people who are grateful to you, to go to hell together.You can't do anything even if you are disgusted to death.It was you who wanted to be a gentleman, it was you who wanted to be a good person.Since you have made such a choice, then sacrificing your life to save everyone is what you should do. If you don't do it, you are a hypocrite, a liar, you are pretending to be noble, you are worse than pigs and dogs.He seemed to hear the shrieks of the men, the shrieks of their laughter:You have no choice.You have no choice!Chu Xun slowly raised his head in the tide-like chaotic quarrel. He looked at the sky in the wind and rain.The sky was finally going to be bright.A night of heavy rain had washed away the blood on the stone steps of the City God Pavilion.Chu Xun and the people who were protecting him were all tied up and brought to the temple.This scene was really sad and ridiculous. Those people tied Chu Xun so tightly, and they were complacent that they had captured such a powerful person.But they did not know that Chu Xun only needed to cast a spell to destroy these ropes.But he did not do that. In the end, he did not remove the Shang Qing barrier.Enough blood had been shed in Lin 'an. He did not want to cause innocent people to lose their lives in order to take revenge.So that layer of thin film protected those who repaid kindness with enmity and those who treated him sincerely.He came to the front of the temple. The Ghost King did not appear. There was only a candle emitting rolling black smoke, twisting into an empty human figure.\"Why \u2014 not remove the barrier!\" The moment he saw Chu Xun, the voice was furious. \"Remove the barrier!!\"Chu Xun calmly said, \"Unless I die.\"The black smoke let out a shrill scream and said hoarsely, \"Chu Xun, you are crazy!You \u2026 kill him \u2014 kill him for me \u2014 otherwise, when night falls, I will take all of your lives! \"Dawn came.Layer after layer of light of day weakly lit up the endless night.The Ghost King could not support himself in the light. He fled into the darkness. The burning candle suddenly trembled and went out.Chu Xun came back to his senses. The City God Pavilion was built quite high. Looking from afar, the mountains and rivers were shrouded in the misty rain. He could not see the scars clearly.\"Master Chu, I am sorry.\"\"It's not that we are ruthless. It's because you destroyed one of the Ghost King's eyes. He has a deep grudge with you \u2026 we had no choice \u2026\"\"Why are you still talking so much!My whole family is waiting to live. Is his life more important, or is everyone's life more important?The one with the Dao is the leader of all living things. He said it himself! \"Chu Wanning stood in the distance and looked at the man who he did not know what relationship he had with him. He felt complicated.Suddenly, a pair of hands covered his eyes.Chu Wanning asked in a low voice, \"What are you doing?\"\"Don't let you see.\"\"\u2026 Why?\"\"You will feel uncomfortable.\"Chu Wanning was silent for a while. His eyelashes trembled in Mo Ran's hands, \"No, I said it was 200 years ago.\"Mo Ran's voice came from behind. He sighed softly, \"\u2026 Little fool, then why is my palm wet?\"After an unknown amount of time, an incense's time, two hours, or a blink of an eye.Time was blurred in this madness and chaos.When Chu Wanning opened his eyes, the enchantment of Shang Qing had disappeared. Chu Xun fell in a pool of blood. Around him were people and ghosts. There were demons and monsters in human skin, sniffing the fresh blood.Joy, guilt, surviving a disaster, pain, evil, people's hearts are like beasts.The air was filled with the smell of death.The human world, or hell.It was not so clear anymore.The crowd slowly dispersed. There were no ghosts during the day. They were in a hurry to fill their stomachs and rest. They were in a hurry to wait for the Ghost King to descend again at night. He would examine the dead men in the temple and then reward them for the return of their loved ones.Gradually, only a dozen or so people were left in the temple, sobbing and crying.There was the woman from the brothel, the old woman with a head full of white hair, the couple who were persuaded by their child, a beggar, a scholar, a storyteller, a former rich young master, a widow with a young child in her arms, a teacher, and a farmer.There was nothing else.However, just as they were hugging the corpse and crying, the eyelashes of the dead man in the pool of blood trembled slightly, and he slowly opened his eyes.\"Young master!\"\"Young master Chu!\"Mo Ran's heart trembled. He could not help but say, \"It's useless \u2026 this is \u2026\"This incantation had been lost in the present world. He did not expect to see it again in this virtual realm.\"This is the Voice Incantation.He is already dead. Before he died, he cast this incantation on himself, \"Chu Wanning paused and said,\" He had things to do. He still has things to worry about in this world. \"Chu Xun's eyes were empty and unfocused. He said lightly, \"The ghost race is sinister. Their words cannot be trusted. After the enchantment of Shang Qing is lost at night, demons will come out and kill everywhere.I hope everyone can escape from here and go to Putuo. \"\"Young master \u2026\"\"I am already dead. I have no fate to accompany you. However, I have gathered all my spiritual power and cast the incantation in my spirit core.Everyone, take my spirit core. The demons will not be able to get close. \"The crying became louder. It was almost crying blood.Mo Ran and Chu Wanning were even more frightened.Spirit core \u2026That was a crystal that was born with the heart \u2026The dead Chu Xun slowly raised his hand that had not yet stiffened. According to the incantation he set before his death, he grasped the blade buried in his chest and pulled it out.Then \u2013\"Young master!!!\"The surrounding people cried out. Their voices were distorted and hoarse. They were soaked in blood and tears. \"Young master, what are you doing \u2013!!\"The dead man's fingers tore open the wound in his chest and pierced into his flesh. He grabbed the heart that was no longer beating and slowly, inch by inch, pulled it out.That heart was bleeding and beating with golden red flames.That was the power of Chu Xun's spirit core. It was the last light of a candle.\"Take \u2026 it \u2026\"He raised the burning heart and held it straight in front of him. He kept repeating, \"Take \u2026 take \u2026 it \u2026\"Drops of blood rolled down, but they all turned into red begonia flowers. Those flowers were burning and dazzling.\"The road is long and dangerous. Chu Xun's life is short. I can no longer contribute my meager strength. I hope everyone \u2026 I hope everyone can \u2026 take care \u2026 of \u2026 it \u2026\"Mo Ran looked at everything in front of him in horror. He suddenly felt a prickling sensation on his back and cold sweat dripped down.Scar \u2026 this scar!!He suddenly remembered that Chu Wanning's chest was close to his heart.There was also a scar!That was Chu Wanning's most sensitive part. How could he forget?Every time they were on the bed, when he licked that faint scar, Chu Wanning's usually cold and indifferent face would reveal a hidden desire. Mo Ran felt that this expression looked very exciting, so he was always willing to humiliate the person under him.But at that time, he never cared about Chu Wanning's past. As for where this scar came from, he never asked until his death.And in this life, even if he wanted to ask, he did not have the qualifications.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWas it a coincidence?Or \u2026Now his master's chest was not something he could see whenever he wanted to. He could only recall the wound based on his memory. It was a faint crescent-moon color, which should be a pure cut made by a blade. It was not like Chu Xun's, who stabbed with five fingers and left a hideous bloody hole.After all, it was not the same.Thinking of this, Mo Ran let out a sigh of relief. Although Chu Xun and Chu Wanning were very different people, there were too many similarities between them. From their looks to the scar on their chests, it was really suspicious that they were coincidentally stacked together.But he didn't know why. Maybe it was because Chu Xun was too gentle, completely different from Chu Wanning's violent and unrestrained, or maybe it was because Chu Xun was a man with a wife and children. So if Chu Xun was the reincarnation of Chu Wanning, or Chu Wanning, Mo Ran felt that he couldn't bear it and would collapse.Fortunately, it was not like this.It was needless to say what kind of disaster Lin 'an City would face without Chu Xun's protection.Of course, the Ghost King would not keep his promise. After nightfall, there was a rain of blood and wind, and the world was dark.The moat was dyed red with blood, and the screams of the living after losing their minds resounded through the night.The city was full of wandering zombies, eating fresh blood sausages and chewing brains.Mo Ran took Chu Wanning to hide in a dilapidated house. The owner had died long ago, and the furniture and utensils were covered with a thick layer of dust.Mo Ran closed the door and sealed the room, leaving only a small window in the kitchen open to explore the situation outside.From time to time, there were sharp screams and ominous chewing sounds outside.Mo Ran carried Chu Wanning to a small pile of firewood in the corner and touched his head. \"According to Miss Qizheng, we can leave after defeating the Ghost King.So you stay here and don't move. \"Chu Wanning heard this and suddenly raised his head. \"Are you going out?\"\"Not now. I will go out when the Ghost King shows up.\"\"But it's very dangerous outside.The Emptiness Realm has already materialized. With your strength alone, how can you resist it? \"\"But I can't bring a child to a fight.\"Chu Wanning shook his head. \"I'll go with you.\"\"Hahaha, Junior Brother is so cute, but you're still young. You'll drag me down if you go out with me.When you're a little older, I won't stop you from taking action when you encounter such things. But this time, you have to listen to your Senior Brother. \"\"I won't hold you back.\"\"That's what people usually say when they're dragging you down,\" Mo Ran said. \"Be good and stop messing around, okay?\"\"\u2026\"Seeing that Chu Wanning finally stopped talking, Mo Ran let out a sigh of relief. His eyes looked out through the ridges of the wooden window, and his expression gradually turned solemn.Why did the Emptiness Realm, which was supposed to be used for training, suddenly materialize?Junior Brother was right. Someone wanted to harm him.In his previous life, countless people wanted to kill him, but in this life, he had not offended anyone powerful. After thinking about it, the only person who could possibly want his life was the fake Gouchen he encountered at Jincheng Lake.But who exactly was the original body of the fake Gouchen?If he could skillfully use the exquisite Go game to such an extent, why didn't he stand out in his previous life?Could it be that he was not the only one who was reborn in this world?This thought made him shudder, and a murderous glint appeared in his eyes.After his rebirth, he only wanted to bury his past. If there was a second person who was reborn, then things would be very troublesome.His brows furrowed deeper and deeper. Suddenly, he heard Chu Wanning say, \"\u2026 Mo Ran, I \u2026\"\"What's wrong?\"Chu Wanning gritted her teeth. After weighing the pros and cons, she steeled her heart and decided to tell him the truth.\"Listen to me. Actually, I can help you. I'm \u2026\"But when Mo Ran heard \"I can help you\", he felt that his junior brother wanted to struggle with him again, so he interrupted him and said, \"Okay, okay, I said I won't let you go, so I won't let you go.Don't force yourself. Listen to me. \"\"No, listen to me.\"Mo Ran was annoyed, so he said, \"I won't listen, you bastard.\"\"\u2026\"Seeing Chu Wanning's ugly expression, Mo Ran probably felt that his tone was a little too harsh, so he poked between his eyebrows with his finger and said with a smile, \"You're so young. Why are you so bitter and resentful, and you don't like to listen to the words of your elders?Then, let me tell you, since you call me senior brother, we're from the same sect. In this kind of dangerous situation, I have to protect you. Do you understand? \"Chu Wanning closed his eyes and said in a low voice, \"\u2026 I understand.\"\"That's good. Then you \u2014\"\"But I'm worried about you.\"Mo Ran was stunned. The finger that was hanging in front of his forehead seemed to tremble slightly. For a moment, he couldn't say anything.He had lived two lives, but he had never heard anyone say the words \"I'm worried about you\".Even though Shi Mi was gentle to him, he had never expressed his concern for him in such a straightforward manner.He stared at the little child on the pile of firewood in front of him, his heart filled with mixed feelings.After a long time, his eyes gradually became very gentle. Then the finger that was poking Chu Wanning gently moved up and fell on the other's soft hair, rubbing it.\"Don't worry. I promise you, I will come back alive.\"\"Mo Ran, can you listen to me first \u2026\"Mo Ran smiled, \"Okay, what do you want to say?\"\"Actually, I'm \u2014\"\"Bang!\" The door was knocked open.A man with disheveled hair screamed and rushed in. He was covered in blood. One of his legs had been torn to pieces. Behind him was a group of zombies that were attracted by the smell of blood.The man dragged his broken leg and staggered into the room. He grabbed everything he could grab and threw it at the zombies. He threw it while shouting, \"Go away!Don't come here!Go away!Go away! \"Mo Ran cursed inwardly and shielded Chu Wanning behind him. A red light shone in his hand and he summoned Ghost Bearer to protect him. He turned his head and said,\"Junior brother, you hide well. Don't come here!\"After saying that, he went forward and fought with the zombies that broke into the room.Although the ghost was similar to Heaven's Inquisition, Chu Wanning did not completely teach Mo Ran the moves. Mo Ran's weapon in his previous life was a knife. He was not used to soft weapons. Therefore, although he was not at a disadvantage in the beginning, he gradually became a little weak.While the ghost dance was in chaos, he suddenly heard the voice of a child behind him. It was clear and cold, \"Hit the left wrist three times, then jump up and throw it out from the back.\"Mo Ran did not have time to think, so he followed the instructions. The willow vine whipped a zombie on the left. The zombie's arm was broken by Shen Wu. Ordinary people would not be bored enough to whip it twice.But since Junior Martial Brother had said so, there was no harm in giving it a try. Immediately, he hit the zombie twice. Then, he leaped up and his back went limp. He flipped over and swung the vine whip behind him.Shua!It was neither too early nor too late, just in time for the next wave of zombies to arrive. After accumulating strength three times, the Ghost Hunter ignited a blazing scarlet flame, and with a loud rumble, it pounced towards the zombies. The zombies were immediately chopped in half by the violent Spirit Martial, and those zombies were all beheaded. The heads that fell to the ground were still emitting wisps of black smoke.Mo Ran was stunned. He glanced at his Junior Brother who was sitting on the pile of firewood with a slightly surprised expression.This guy \u2026 \u2026 is good?\"How are we going to fight next?\" Mo Ran was excited and asked excitedly.Chu Wanning was expressionless, \"Next \u2026 \u2026 use your left hand and pat the right side of your clothes.\"\"Oh, this move is profound and unfathomable. What is it?\"Chu Wanning said lightly, \"There is nothing profound and unfathomable. You were too proud of yourself just now. Your sleeves were burned by the weapon.\"\"Ah!\" Mo Ran exclaimed. He looked down and saw that it was indeed the case. He hurriedly extinguished the fire that had been ignited by the ghost.This person's face was really thick. He was not embarrassed at all. He raised his head with a smile and said to the other side, \"My little brother is very strong. I like it.\"Chu Wanning coughed softly and silently turned her face away. Facing the gray and bare wall, the tips of her ears were a little red.At this time, there were only six zombies left in the room. Chu Wanning did not want to look at Mo Ran anymore. He still turned his head and commanded the wall, \"Relax your wrists. Swing the vine towards the ceiling. After accumulating strength six times, perform One Slash.\"Mo Ran did as he was told. But after the fifth round, he suddenly remembered, \"How do I perform One Slash?\"\"\u2026 \u2026 Just do it the way you normally use your sword.\"\"Ah, so that's how it is!\"Mo Ran suddenly understood. He swung down and a raging fire burned. The soft vine seemed to have been instantly tempered into an indestructible long blade. With a shua, it cut the six zombies in half!\"Wah \u2014 \u2014\"This time, Mo Ran's eyes were wide open.\"Where did you learn this?Why do I feel that you are almost as skilled as my Shizun in using the vine whip?No, maybe you are even better than him. He never told me what you taught me. \"\"\u2026 \u2026\"Mo Ran beamed with joy, \"Good, good, good. Excellent. I won't have to look at Shizun's face in the future. If I learn from you, won't I be happy?\"Chu Wanning glared at him. \"Do you dislike Elder Yu Heng for giving you a hard time?Why don't you dislike me looking at you? \"Mo Ran put away the vine whip and blocked the door again. He dragged a table to block the entrance and laughed, \"You look at me because you are good to me.The two of us can be considered to have gone through thick and thin together. You've treated me well, and I'll remember it all. In the future, I'll treat you as my younger brother and dote on you.Not to mention you looking at me, even if you are unhappy and hit me twice, I won't be angry. \"Chu Wanning's face darkened, \"Who wants to be your younger brother.\"He jumped down from the pile of firewood and ignored Mo Ran. Instead, he went to check the injuries of the man who broke in.Unexpectedly, Chu Wanning opened his eyes slightly, \"\u2026 \u2026 Why is it him?\"\"Who is it?\"Mo Ran poked his head over and was also stunned. \"That \u2026 that Young Man?\"The one lying in a pool of blood and moaning intermittently was Young Man. He was seriously injured. After Chu Wanning checked, he shook his head and said, \"Human and ghost can never coexist. It must be that the Ghost King used him and didn't care about him.This person is really \u2026 \u2026 \"Mo Ran said, \"He deserves it.\"Chu Wanning glanced at him.Mo Ran chuckled and suddenly felt a little guilty. Shouldn't he be the one who deserved retribution the most?Mo Ran changed the topic and asked, \"Right, what did you want to tell me?What are you actually? \"Chu Wanning lowered his eyelashes, paused, and said in a low voice, \"Actually, I am \u2026 \u2026\"Before he could finish, he suddenly felt a wind behind him. Chu Wanning was shocked and turned around to face the attack. However, he was a child after all and his strength was far less than that of an adult. He couldn't escape and was tightly locked by the other side!Young Man struggled and crawled up from the pool of blood with one breath!One of his hands with bulging blue veins held Chu Wanning's neck tightly, while the other hand held Chu Wanning's arms behind his back. His dirty face was burning with crazy flames, and his desire to survive twisted his whole body, like a wax statue that was deformed under the heat.His eyes were bloodshot, and he said to Mo Ran in a hoarse voice, \"Take me \u2026 \u2026 out of here \u2026 \u2026\"\"Let him go!\"\"Take me out of here!!\" Young Man shouted angrily, and his eyes were about to crack, \"Or I will kill him!Go! \"\"You want me to save you, so I will save you. Why are you making life difficult for a child?Let him go first \u2026 \u2026 \"\"If you say one more word, I will kill him now!!Anyway, I have done all kinds of bad things, and I don't need this one more!Are you going or not?! \"Chu Wanning was choked so hard that he couldn't make a sound, and his delicate little face was red.Seeing this, Mo Ran became anxious. Although he could kill Young Man with a single blow, this was the place where the Virtual Realm had materialized. If Young Man really got angry, she would probably seriously injure his Junior Brother before he could kill her.Mo Ran said, \"Okay, okay, okay, I will listen to you. Don't get angry. Let go of me first, I will \u2026 \u2026\"Before he finished, blood splattered everywhere!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHow could Chu Wanning be a pushover? With a flash of golden light, Mo Ran vaguely saw some kind of weapon in his hand, but the weapon was withdrawn and released very quickly. In an instant, Young Man's hands were strangled, and even his wrists were cut off!Young Man screamed and stepped back. This time, except for one foot, even his hands were disabled.The hand that was strangling Chu Wanning fell to the ground. Chu Wanning stood up. He seemed to be extremely angry, and his face was unprecedentedly ugly. He seemed to want to say something, but his lips moved. In the end, he seemed to be so angry that he was speechless. He just turned around angrily with a livid face.Mo Ran hurriedly went to him and hugged him, \"Junior brother, how are you?Are you hurt anywhere? \"Chu Wanning shook his head in his arms and didn't say anything. He was so disgusted that he couldn't speak.But no matter what, this Young Man was a person who lived more than two hundred years ago. The one in front of him was just a puppet that was derived.Chu Wanning wiped the blood on his face and whispered to Mo Ran, \"You saw it too. I may not be safe if I stay here. It's better to go out with you to fight.With my skills, I won't be a burden to you. \"Mo Ran had only heard of his junior brother's ability from Xue Meng before, but he had never seen it with his own eyes.However, the unforeseen event just now had truly opened his eyes.\"You're powerful, but \u2026\"Chu Wanning said, \"I'm familiar with the use of all kinds of weapons, and I can guide you.\"\"But \u2026\"Chu Wanning raised his eyes, \"Just trust me this time.\"\"\u2026\"\"Senior brother.\"Chu Wanning's original intention was to deepen the sincerity in his tone. Unexpectedly, the child's crisp voice was soft and cute, as if he was acting like a spoiled child. Chu Wanning was a little surprised when he heard it.Mo Ran was also stunned when he heard it. Then he scratched his head and buried his face in his palms for a long time before he said, \"This, the main thing I'm afraid of is \u2026 your \u2026\"After living for two lifetimes, it was the first time that he was called so softly by a little guy. Mo Ran really felt that this person was like a brother to him.If Mo Xianjun wanted to hate someone, he would hate them to the bone, but he was especially soft-hearted to those who cherished. Therefore, after scratching his head for a long time, he squatted and looked up at Chu Wanning. his ears silently turned red...If only he had a younger brother, he wouldn't be so lonely.When Chu Wanning saw Mo Ran's reaction, she hesitated for a moment before whispering, \"Senior brother.\".................. Mo Ran held his forehead and felt that he couldn't take it anymore, \"\u2026\"Chu Wanning looked at him meaningfully and understood this person's weakness. Anyway, he was now in the form of a child, and Mo Ran didn't know who his real body was, so he didn't feel embarrassed. Therefore, he opened his mouth and called out softly, \"Brother.\"\"\u2026\"\"Brother.\"\"\u2026\"\"Brother Mo Ran.\"\"Ahhhh!!!Okay, okay!Bring you!Bring you!Stop calling! \"Mo Ran jumped up and rubbed his goosebumps. His face was red and he said, \"Go, go, go, come with me. You're good, you're the best.Oh my god. \"Chu Wanning put his hands behind his back and turned his head slightly. He smiled faintly and said, \"Let's go.\"Then, he walked slowly to the door. Behind him, Mo Ran whispered, \"Where did you learn this trick? It's so corny. Ouch \u2026\"Originally, after seeing what happened to Chu Xun, Chu Wanning was in a bad mood. But now, he felt that the haze in his heart was gradually fading away.Suddenly, he heard Mo Ran ask, \"Hey, by the way, what did you want to say to me just now?\"Chu Wanning turned around and said very calmly, \"Ah.That. \"\"Hmm?\"\"I forgot.\"\"\u2026\"\"I'll tell Brother Mo Ran when I remember in the future \u2026\"\"Ahhh, don't!Don't call me that!Just call me Brother!Brother is enough! \"Mo Ran waved his hand.Chu Wanning's eyes were like deep pools. With a slight smile on his lips, he said lightly, \"That's good.Brother, it's almost time. This illusion is based on the memories of the survivors. Now that those people have left Lin 'an, I think this illusion won't last long.The Ghost King should be coming out soon. \"\"That's true \u2026 If we defeat him, we can go out, right?When I return, I will definitely investigate and find out who made the illusion real and wants to take our lives! \"Chu Wanning nodded. \"Fortunately, when the Ghost King fought with Chu Xun before, I can see that this Ghost King is not a very powerful character. He may be the weakest among the Nine Great Ghost Kings.Although this place has been made real, I think that the opponent may have really treated me as an ordinary six-year-old child. He didn't expect that I could help to deal with this illusion. \"Mo Ran nodded repeatedly and said, \"That's right.\"Chu Wanning said, \"So instead of saying that the person behind the scenes wants to harm us, it's better to say that he didn't include me in his plan from the beginning.The only person he wants to harm is actually you, Brother. \"Mo Ran nodded his head like he was pounding garlic. \"What you said makes a lot of sense.\"\"After we go out, Brother must explain this matter clearly to Xue Meng. This Peach Blossom Spring is probably dangerous, so we have to be careful about everything.Alright, let's not talk about this first. Let's go. I won't be a burden to Brother. Please lead me out of this place. \"Chu Wanning's prediction was right.At 3 o 'clock, the massacre in the city came to an end.A blood-colored crack suddenly appeared at the edge of the sky. Green smoke scattered into the ruins and condensed into a hunchbacked man.The man's eyes were scarlet red, and his skin was pale. Half of his body was still covered in flesh and blood, but the other half was all white bones.He dragged his black umbrella and walked alone in the ancient city of Lin 'an, which was full of corpses. Along the way, he absorbed the resentment and pain of the newly dead.Mo Ran hid in the dark and saw his appearance clearly.\"It's him?\"There was a hint of relief in his voice.Chu Wanning understood why he was relieved, but since he didn't intend to reveal his identity at this moment, as a six-year-old child, he couldn't know too much.So he pretended not to know and raised his head to ask, \"What?\"\"Your guess is very good. The strength of the Ghost World's Nine Kings is very different. The weakest among them should be this one.\"Mo Ran stood sideways by the window and looked at the figure approaching from afar. He whispered, \"Our luck is not bad.\"\"What are Brother's chances of winning?\"\"Ninety percent. As for words, you can't be too sure.\"Chu Wanning smiled.Of course, he knew that there were nine Ghost Kings in the Ghost World. The \"Skeleton Emperor\" was the weakest, but strength was relative.With Mo Ran's age and experience, even with the help of the God of Martial Arts, it was still difficult for him to deal with the Skeleton Emperor alone.However, the person who wanted to plot against Mo Ran didn't expect that the person who accompanied Mo Ran was not a random child at the peak of life and death, but Chu Wanning.\"Save me \u2026\"The two were about to break through the door and kill the other party when they heard a faint groan behind them.\"Ah, he's still alive?\" Mo Ran opened his eyes wide and looked back at Young Man who was curled up into a ball.\"I don't want to die \u2026 Father \u2026 I don't want to \u2026\"Chu Wanning looked at the young man who was like a ragged piece of cloth and shook his head, \"That year, this person should have died when he entered the house. But in this illusion, the reason why he is still alive is probably because we hid here and got rid of the zombies that were chasing him, which changed some things in the illusion.\"\"Alas \u2026 If he hadn't betrayed us, do you think Chu Xun wouldn't have died two hundred years ago?Maybe Lin 'an wouldn't have become a ruin \u2026 \"\"Maybe.\"But both of them understood that no matter what was said, the past was the past. The most important thing at the moment was to defeat the Skeleton Emperor and get out of the illusion.There was no need to hesitate. Mo Ran and Chu Wanning rushed out of the hiding place and killed all the way without showing weakness.Getting out of the illusion was easier than they thought.Mo Ran had a clear goal and soon fought with the Skeleton Emperor.But looking at the two fighting with full strength, Chu Wanning felt a faint uneasiness.That uneasiness was not because Mo Ran was at a disadvantage. In fact, Mo Ran had been steadily gaining the upper hand under his guidance. But Chu Wanning was more and more aware that \u2014The person hiding in the dark controlled the situation too accurately.In other words, that person clearly calculated that if only Mo Ran and another person with average aptitude were trapped in this illusion, it would be extremely difficult to get out of danger.But the other party did not use more powerful means to kill Mo Ran. Obviously, they did not want people to know that this was a premeditated murder case.Instead, they wanted to create an illusion that Mo Ran died in the illusion because of an accident during the trial.Who was it that meticulously planned to take Mo Ran's life?Was it really Jin Chenghu's fake North Star \u2026Chu Wanning watched the fierce battle between Mo Ran and the Ghost King. As time passed, Mo Ran was already at the top.The sky was gradually brightening, and the Ghost King's magical power was gradually weakening. Soon, it would not be able to hold on, and the outcome would be decided.But at this moment, Chu Wanning suddenly saw a living person's face among the ghosts and zombies that were sealed by Mo Ran's spell!\"Who!!\"That person was very far away, mixed in the crowd of zombies. He was wearing a cloak, and half of his face was covered in shadow. Only a sharp chin, sweet lustrous lips, and a gentle curve of the bridge of his nose could be seen.With just a glance, Chu Wanning could tell that this person's behavior was not like the illusion from two hundred years ago. This person did not make any offensive posture, but quietly hid under the hood, facing the direction of Chu Wanning and Mo Ran.Seeing that Chu Wanning had noticed him, he actually smiled slightly, then raised his hand and drew two lines around his neck, making a gesture that was similar to \"kill\".Chu Wanning cursed inwardly, and suddenly rushed over, wanting to capture this person.But that person was still smiling. Under the hood, his lips were bright red, and his white teeth were eerily white. He mouthed at him, looking very much like \"farewell\".He dodged and did not go.\"Stop!\"It was useless. The sky was clear, and layers of white fish belly billowed up.The battle between Mo Ran and the Ghost King had ended with the last strangle. When the Ghost King's head was strangled by Mo Ran's ghost sword, the filthy blood gushed out, and the scene in front of them quickly swept away. Chu Wanning and Mo Ran's bodies were suddenly thrown up, and the sunrise of Lin 'an and the ruins of two hundred years ago all turned into strange and variegated shadows.\"Bang!\" A loud sound was heard.When Chu Wanning fell to the ground again, he had already returned to the cave of trial.Mo Ran had also returned, and fell beside him. His body was mottled with the bloodstains from the battle.But his injuries were not serious. He was lying on the ground with his face on one side, obviously unable to get up. Only a pair of dark eyes looked sideways at Chu Wanning beside him.After a while, he raised his hand and gently touched his forehead with his fingertips.\"You're out.\"Chu Wanning nodded, but his face was very ugly, \"\u2026 I just saw a person inside.\"\"What?\"\"Very suspicious. It should be the person who cast the spell.\"Mo Ran got up with a grunt, and widened his eyes, \"You saw it?You saw it!Then did you see who he was?What did he look like? \"Chu Wanning frowned and shook his head, \"He was wearing a hood, so I couldn't see clearly. But looking at his figure, he should be a man, not old, thin, and with a very sharp chin \u2026\"There was still half a sentence that he did not say.He felt that this half of the face looked vaguely familiar, as if he had seen it somewhere a long time ago.But he also felt that it was just his illusion. After all, it was only the lower half of the face. There were many people with similar faces, so he could not tell at the moment.While he was thinking, he suddenly felt Mo Ran patting his shoulder.\"Junior brother.\"\"What's wrong?\"\"\u2026 Look over there.\"Mo Ran's voice was a little low and slightly cold.Chu Wanning raised his head and looked in the direction he pointed.It was Eighteen.At the entrance of the trial cave, Eighteen's eyes were bulging. She was hanging on the ceiling of the cave, a pair of feet wearing silk embroidered shoes swaying in the air.She was already dead. There was no wind here. Looking at the extent of her swaying, the person who killed her should have just left not long ago.But what made Chu Wanning and Mo Ran's expressions change the most was the weapon that was tightly strangling her neck.It was a willow vine.The leaves were like knives, flowing with a fierce red light. From time to time, tongues of fire would burst, and sparks and blood would splash together.Damn it.The person who strangled Eighteen to death and hung her on the ceiling of the cave was actually the ghost of a divine weapon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMo Ran's face was pale. He summoned the weapon that he had just put away in disbelief. He watched as a cluster of flames lit up in his palm. The ghost answered the summons and lay in his palm.Comparing the two weapons, the weapon that killed Eighteen, except for the lack of a handle, was exactly the same as the ghost. It was as if a section of the ghost had been cut off. Could there be a second ghost in this world?Before he could think about it, he suddenly heard footsteps coming from afar at an extremely fast speed.Chu Wanning was calmer than Mo Ran. He pondered for a moment, and then his eyes suddenly turned cold. \"Mo Ran, put away the ghost first!\"\"What?\"It was too late.A group of people had already rushed to the entrance of the cave. There were feathermen and cultivators from various sects who were cultivating in the Peach Blossom Spring. There were even figures of Xue Meng, Ye Xijun, and Shi Mei in the crowd \u2026 It seemed that someone had noticed the abnormality in the cave and gathered almost everyone to come here.Therefore, when the crowd arrived one after another, they saw that Eighteen had died tragically outside the cave. Her neck was strangled by a willow vine that squeezed into her flesh.Mo Ran and a half-grown child were in a mess. Obviously, they had gone through a fierce battle. Mo Ran was covered in blood, and the weapon in his hand was the ghost that was leaping with dangerous flames \u2026It was silent.Someone suddenly yelled, \"M-murderer!\"The crowd slowly became noisy. Panic, anger, and whispers converged into a stream, buzzing and vibrating the bones.\"Murder\", \"Murderer\", \"What's his intention\", \"crazy\", \"lunatic\", and broken words kept repeating. The crowd was like the corpse tide in the illusion just now, which gave Mo Ran an illusion that the illusion was not over and the nightmare was still going on.The blood from 200 years ago in Lin 'an City seemed to still be flowing.\"No \u2026\" His throat was dry, and he took a step back. \"It's not me \u2026\"His footsteps paused, and someone pulled on his clothes.Mo Ran lowered his head in the chaos and saw Chu Wanning's pair of clear eyes.He muttered unconsciously, \"It's not me \u2026\"Chu Wanning nodded and wanted to protect him behind him.But he was just a little child at the moment, what could he do?While he was anxious, he suddenly felt that Mo Ran took another step forward.More and more people shouted, \"Catch him!And that child!Catch him!Murderer! \"\"Don't let them escape, it's too dangerous!Catch them! \"Mo Ran pulled Chu Wanning behind him, and then lowered his head for a while, gradually calming himself..\"I didn't kill Eighteen.Listen to my explanation. \"The faces in the crowd were so blurry that they overlapped with a certain time in his previous life that he couldn't bear to recall.He barely saw Xue Meng among those figures. Xue Meng's face was full of disbelief, and then he saw Shi Mei. Shi Mei's eyes were wide open, his face was frighteningly pale, and he kept shaking his head.Mo Ran closed his eyes and said in a low voice, \"I didn't kill her, but I don't plan to escape.Before you catch me, you should at least listen to my explanation, right? \"However, even if Mo Ran said so, no one would listen to him.Uneasiness and anger pervaded the crowd. A female Taoist priest screamed, \"You, you were caught red-handed. What's there to explain?\"\"Yes!\"\"No matter what, catch both of them!If they are really wronged, it's not too late to release them then! \"\"Catch them!Catch them! \"Xue Meng recovered from the initial shock. He walked out of the crowd, facing the angry and distorted faces, and with his back to Mo Ran, he said loudly, \"Please be quiet and listen to me.\"\"Who do you think you are!\"\"Why should we listen to you!\"\"Wait, this seems to be Little Phoenix?\"\"Little Phoenix?God's favored one?That Xue Meng? \"\"It's him \u2026\"Xue Meng's face was very ugly, almost pale. He took a deep breath and said slowly, \"Please listen to me.These two are my disciples at the Peak of Life and Death. I believe that they will not kill innocent people.Everyone, please calm down and listen to their explanation. \"\"\u2026 \u2026\"After a moment of silence, someone suddenly shouted, \"Why should we believe you?So what if they are the disciples at the Peak of Life and Death? Do you know them like the back of your hand? \"\"That's right. It's hard to know what's in a person's heart. Even if they are from the same sect, how much can we know?\"Xue Meng's face became worse and worse. His lips were tightly pursed, and his fingers unconsciously clenched into fists.Behind him, Mo Ran held Chu Wanning's hand and stood there. In fact, he was a little surprised when Xue Meng came out. In his previous life, he did not have a deep friendship with this cousin of his, and they always looked down on each other. Later on, when he became the Supreme Emperor of the Human Realm, he burned, killed, and plundered everything. Naturally, he and \"Little Phoenix\" entered into a camp that was incompatible with each other.Therefore, he did not expect that in such a situation, Xue Meng would turn his back to him and face others.Mo Ran suddenly felt warm and said, \"Xue Meng, you \u2026 believe me?\"\"Bah!Dog, who would believe you? \"Xue Meng half turned his face and said unhappily,\" Look at what you've gotten yourself into!You are obviously one year older than me, but you want me to clean up your mess! \"\"\u2026\"After scolding, he turned his head and shouted at those people in an even fiercer voice, \"What?Why don't I understand them?One of them is my Junior Brother, and the other is my cousin!Do you understand, or do I understand? \"\"Xue Meng \u2026\"\"Will you die if you listen to a few words of explanation?There are so many people watching. Do you think they can grow wings and fly away after a while? \"At this time, Shi Mei also walked out, but he did not seem to have a lot of momentum. He said weakly, \"Immortals, I can also vouch for the two of them. They are definitely not the ones who hurt Miss Eighteen. Please listen to my explanation. Thank you \u2026\"Ye Wangxi also stepped forward. Although he did not vouch for the two of them, he was much calmer than those people who were in a foul mood.Ye Wangxi said, \"Even if we have to detain them temporarily, we should give them a chance to explain.Otherwise, wouldn't we be letting the real culprit off easy? What if that person is hiding among us? What should we do? \"When he said this, the others immediately looked at each other with a trace of vigilance in their eyes.\"\u2026 Okay!Then we will allow you to explain first! \"\"But we still have to catch them!It is better to be cautious! \"\"We would rather catch the wrong person than let them go!\"Mo Ran sighed and put his hand to his forehead. After a while, he actually laughed.\"I didn't expect that there would be people who are willing to believe me when I am surrounded by enemies.Okay, okay, even if I am caught, I won't be angry with the three of you. \"He simply told them about the materialization of the Virtual Realm, what happened in the Realm, and how he saw Miss Eighteen being killed when he came out.It was a pity that once the Shura Realm was broken, it would be a completely new illusion for the others to enter. Therefore, it was impossible to verify whether what Mo Ran said was true or false. However, if Mo Ran made it up, it would be difficult for him to piece together such a story in such a short time.Therefore, after he finished speaking, more than half of the people in the crowd seemed to be shaken.A more noble featherman whispered a few words to his subordinate, then said, \"Mo Ran, Xia Si Ni, although the two of you have words, you don't have evidence.Before everything is investigated, for the safety of the Peach Blossom Spring, I will have to inconvenience you to be imprisoned for a period of time. \"Mo Ran smiled bitterly and helplessly, \"Okay, okay, okay, I knew it would be like this.Give me food and drinks, and I won't say anything. \"\"Of course.\"The featherman paused and said, \"From today onwards, the cultivators in the Peach Blossom Spring need to be on high alert to avoid any accidents.For the cultivators who did not arrive in time, I will send people to check and question them one by one to eliminate suspicion.Also, I will inform the leaders of the various sects about this matter, especially the Peak of Life and Death, which is the most involved. If possible, I would like to invite the masters of the two of you here for a chat. \"\"Master?!\" When Mo Ran heard this, his expression changed.Chu Wanning was silent and did not say anything.\"I don't want to invite my master here!Can it be my uncle instead? \"\"If a disciple is unwell, he should report it to his master.This is the rule of the cultivation world since ancient times. Could it be that your Peak of Life and Death is different? \"\"No, I \u2026\"Mo Ran scratched his head anxiously and sighed. He did not know what to say.If a disciple was unwell, it was naturally not wrong to report this matter to his master.However, when he thought of Chu Wanning's indifferent expression and ice-cold gaze.Mo Ran felt that even if he came, he would definitely not distinguish between right and wrong and would first teach him a lesson. It was better not to meet him.However, no matter what he said, it was difficult to change the situation.He and his junior brother were imprisoned together.The Peach Blossom Spring's imprisonment was a medium-sized cave. At the entrance of the cave, there were ancient thorns that only obeyed the orders of the feathermen. It was dark inside all day long. Fortunately, there was a fire pit, which burned with a spell that would not be extinguished.Everything in the cave was simple. There was only a wide and rough stone bed with a golden-red cushion made of feathers. There was also a stone table, four stone stools, a bronze mirror, and a few sets of bowls, plates, and tea sets.Mo Ran and Chu Wanning were imprisoned here together.Although the matter was not settled, the featherman in charge of supervising the two seemed to be on good terms with Eighteen. When she died for no reason, the featherman took his anger out on Mo Ran and his junior brother. As a result, he made many obstacles in their daily lives.On the first night, the featherman even knew to send some food. The food was not sumptuous, but it was enough to eat.However, on the second day, he only casually threw some raw meat, vegetables, rice, flour, and salt into the cave. He said that he did not have the time to take care of their meals and told them to take care of what they wanted to eat themselves.\"Take care of it yourself. It's just cooking, who doesn't know how?\"As Mo Ran spoke, he angrily squatted on the ground and picked out the good ingredients.\"What do you want to eat, junior brother?\"\"\u2026 Anything is fine.\"\"Sigh, the most difficult dish to cook in this world is called 'anything is fine.'Let me see, there are streaky pork, cabbage \u2026 Tsk tsk, this birdman is so stingy, the cabbage he gave is all clams.He gave some flour and rice, quite a lot, but I don't know how many days it is. \"He counted and raised his head to ask Chu Wanning,\" Do you want to eat rice or noodles? \"Chu Wanning was resting on the stone bed. Hearing this, he thought for a while, then said, \"Noodles.\"After a pause, he added, \"Pork ribs noodles.\"\"\u2026 Ahaha, you're making things difficult for me, where are the pork ribs from?\"\"Then anything is fine, anything is fine.\"Mo Ran sat cross-legged on the ground with his hands on his knees. He thought for a while and said, \"There aren't many ingredients here, I'll make a bowl of minced pork noodles for you.\"\"Minced pork noodles?\"\"Do you like it?\"\"It's alright, is it spicy?\"Mo Ran smiled, \"Look, in the food that the birdman gave, there isn't even a hint of chili.\"Since they had already discussed what to eat, Mo Ran began to knead the noodles.Chu Wanning was short and did not have enough strength, so he was too lazy to pretend to help. He just lay on the bed and watched Mo Ran knead the white and soft dough lazily. Gradually, his gaze became gentle.Suddenly, he felt that this was very good. Mo Ran did not know who he was, so he could always stay by Mo Ran's side. When he was cooking, he would ask him what he wanted to eat, which was really good.He even felt a little uneasy, as if he had stolen too much from a child called \"Xia Si Ni\".After Mo Ran finished cooking the noodles, he put on the stir-fried meat.The seasonings given by the feathermen were pitifully little, so he really could not make a dish that looked, smelled, and tasted good, but the noodles were chewy, and the texture was just right.He cut off a layer of fat from the streaky pork and stir-fried the pork. With a sizzling sound, he poured it over the noodles while it was boiling hot. After mixing it well, it was also very fragrant.\"Shidi, eat \u2026\" He looked up and saw that Chu Wanning had already fallen asleep. He was still lying on the bed with his head in the crook of his arm and his face turned sideways. His eyelashes were very long, and his expression was peaceful.\"It's time to eat \u2026\" He murmured the second half of his sentence, then walked to the bed and touched Chu Wanning's jade-like black hair.\"It seems that you really do look like Shizun.I don't know what relationship you and Shizun have with the Chu family in Lin 'an, and I don't know who wants to harm us. Sigh \u2026 I don't even know what Shizun is doing right now. If he knows what happened here, will he not distinguish right from wrong and blame me again? \"Speaking of this, Mo Ran's eyes darkened. His fingertips curled around a strand of Chu Wanning's black hair, and he faintly sighed.\"You don't know him. Whenever something happens, he always scolds me \u2026 He especially doesn't like me.\"It was a pity that Chu Wanning was asleep. These words were like the misunderstandings that had been entangled with them for decades in their previous lives. They drifted lightly in the silent night, and no one answered.Mo Ran waited for the noodles to cool down a bit. When they weren't too hot, he woke Chu Wanning up.\"Shidi, it's time to eat.\"Chu Wanning covered his mouth and yawned. His eyes were hazy as he stared blankly for a while.\"Oh, eat \u2026\"Mo Ran brought the noodles over. He loved to cook, but he didn't like to wash dishes. In order to save one utensil from washing, he simply put all the noodles into the pot that had just fried the meat.Chu Wanning was a little surprised at such a bold and unrestrained way of eating. His eyes widened slightly, and he looked at the large pot of noodles in disbelief. \"This \u2026 how do we eat this?\"\"Eat together.\"Mo Ran passed a pair of chopsticks to him. He put his palms together and smiled. \"The competition to see who can eat faster is about to begin!Who can eat more noodles?Let's wait and see. \"\"\u2026\"After Mo Ran finished muttering, his eyes narrowed and his smile became even more joyful.Chu Wanning stared at him for a while and said, \"You seem to be special as long as you have food to eat \u2026\"\"Very happy, right?\"\"Yes.\"\"Haha, food is the most important thing to people.\"As Mo Ran spoke, he didn't hold back. He first scooped up a large amount of noodles with his chopsticks and slurped them until his cheeks were bulging. \"It's a little ugly, but the vegetarian taste is good.\"\"\u2026\" Chu Wanning's expression didn't look good. \"Eat, don't slurp.\"\"Hahaha!\" Mo Ran slapped his thigh and laughed. \"This child, you're a little too similar to my shizun.He also told me not to slurp, but guess what?Once when I was eating with him, I deliberately threw a bone into his bowl. He was so angry, hahahahaha \u2014 \"Chu Wanning gritted his teeth and said, \"You're really impudent!\"\"Yes, yes, yes!That's the reaction, how did you know?Aiyo, you're quite similar. Aiyo, Shidi, I think you two might be distant relatives. Seriously, when Shizun comes here, why don't you ask him properly?Aiyo \u2014 don't fight with me for that half of the fried egg \u2014 \"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAt night, the two of them were lying on the spacious stone bed. The time spent under house arrest was really hard to bear. They had practiced martial arts and eaten, but there was nothing else to do.They walked around in the small cave. Chu Wanning was still calm, but Mo Ran was different. He felt like every day was like a year.\"Sigh, it's so boring. What are we playing?What are we playing? \"Chu Wanning closed his eyes and said, \"Sleep.\"\"It's still early.\" Mo Ran looked at the hourglass and shook his head. \"It's still early.\"Chu Wanning ignored him.Mo Ran rolled around on the bed and suddenly pulled his face.\"Junior.\"\"\u2026 \u2026\"\"Junior ~\"\"\u2026 \u2026\"\"Junior!!\"Chu Wanning suddenly opened his eyes and said angrily, \"What are you doing!?\"Mo Ran shamelessly pulled his hand and shook it back and forth. \"Play with me.\"\"\u2026 \u2026 Are you or am I the junior?\" Chu Wanning was unable to restrain his anger and shook off his hand. \"Who's playing with you!?\"Mo Ran smiled sweetly. He was truly shameless as he said, \"Of course it's you who will accompany me in my nonsense.Who else could it be? \"Chu Wanning, \"\u2026 \u2026\"The headband was removed from Mo Ran's head. It was a red and narrow string with both ends tied together. It was stretched between Mo Ran's fingers and formed a unique knot.In the end, Chu Wan-ning sat up on the bed and asked in a bad temper, \"What is this?How do you play with it? \"\"This is a flower rope.Girls usually play with it, but boys usually don't play with it. But didn't I grow up in a music hall?There were many girls there, so I learned how to play. \"\"\u2026 \u2026\"\"It's actually quite interesting. Look, you hook this string on your finger \u2026 \u2026 No, not this one, it's your pinky finger. Yes, that's it.Then, use your thumb and index finger to hook the two threads over there \u2026 \"Mo Ran said slowly and quietly. He was very patient and calm.The candlelight crackled, and the warm yellow light shone on their silhouettes. One was big and one was small. They lowered their heads and circled around the red string made by the hair tie. Their expressions couldn't help but gradually become gentle.Under Mo Ran's guidance, Chu Wanning's hand held the string tightly. She had tried to figure out a pattern under Mo Ran's guidance. Unexpectedly, she made a mistake. When the red string changed hands, she pulled it back. Instead of creating a new pattern, she pulled it back to its original pattern, two simple strings.He stared blankly, his hand still raised in the air, but he muttered with a puzzled expression, \"Why did it scatter?How could this be \u2026 \"\"Haha, you got it wrong again.\"\"\u2026 Again.\"\"No, no, no.\" Mo Ran laughed. \"It's no fun to always play one game. Let's change to something else.\"\"No.\" This time, it was Chu Wanning's turn to be unhappy. He said solemnly, \"One more time.\"\"\u2026\"The two stayed in the cave for three days. On the night of the fourth day, Mo Ran prepared to make some delicious food for Chu Wanning as usual.These few days, he had already figured out some tricks. This little martial brother of his was indeed from the same hometown as his master. Their likes and dislikes for food were exactly the same.Tonight, the feathermen sent a hen and a few mushrooms.Mo Ran planned to make a pot of chicken soup with fresh mushrooms. Adding some noodles that he made himself, the taste should not be too bad.\"Are we having chicken soup tonight?\"\"Yes.\" Mo Ran answered, and glanced sideways at Chu Wanning.Although this child was exceptionally gifted in martial arts, he was completely unable to grasp the knack of the Flipping Flower Rope. Furthermore, he was extremely stubborn and stubborn. When he had nothing to do, he would pick up the Flipping Flower Rope and ponder over it. His stubborn appearance made people unable to help but laugh.Mo Ran smiled and said, \"You can sit at the side and play slowly. However, I'm afraid that by the time I'm done with the soup, you still haven't figured out the rope.\"Chu Wanning snorted coldly, paused, and said indifferently, \"Among the remaining ingredients, are there any slices of ginger?\"\"Let me see \u2026 Oh, there are. There are a lot of them. Yesterday, I gave you a bunch of ginger.\"Chu Wanning said satisfactorily, \"Put more in to get rid of the smell.\"Mo Ran rubbed his chin, \"Oh \u2026 Don't tell me you want to put in some wolfberries?\"Chu Wanning's eyes lit up, \"Do I?\"\"Pfft.Of course not. I just feel that you and master have similar tastes.He also likes to put ginger and wolfberries in his soup. \"\"\u2026 Do you remember what he likes to eat?\"\"Haha, yes, yes. I'm very obedient.\" Mo Ran was too lazy to explain further. He could not possibly talk about past and present lives to his little martial brother, right?So he went along with the flow and said, \"I'm a good disciple of the twenty-four filial piety. It's a pity that master can't see that I have a pure and innocent heart. I admire him with every punch.\"As Mo Ran spoke casually, he began to process the meat. Thus, he perfectly missed Chu Wanning's expression. He quickly plucked the feathers and removed the organs. Just as he was preparing to boil water to get rid of the bloodstains, he suddenly heard his little martial brother say softly, \"He might not necessarily not know.\"\"What?\"When Chu Wanning saw Mo Ran look up, the tips of his ears suddenly turned red. He turned his head and coughed dryly a few times, saying, \"I said that you treat Elder Yu Heng well. He might not necessarily not know.\"\"Oh, that. Actually, it doesn't matter.In any case, I'm used to it. Although there are times when I fantasize that he can be like other masters and tell me some intimate things, or that he occasionally knows what I like to eat like I know what he likes to eat.But that's all in the past.When I first entered the sect, I was blinded by his beautiful appearance and thought that he was a gentle person. Now that I think about it, it's really \u2026 Ai, he's too high to reach and has to deal with a myriad of affairs every day. How would I dare to enter his eyes? Haha, ahahahaha. \"When Chu Wanning heard this, he was a little angry. However, when he thought about it carefully, although he was usually concerned about Mo Ran, he did indeed always put on a distant attitude. He couldn't help but feel embarrassed and silently lowered his head.After a while, he jumped off the bed and silently walked to Mo Ran's side.\"What are you doing?\"\"You've been cooking for several days. Today's meal is simple. It's my turn to cook for you.\"Mo Ran was stunned and then smiled, saying, \"Why do you suddenly have this idea?You're so small, how can you cook?You can't even reach the stove.What's more, I'm your martial brother. Since you call me that, a few meals is nothing. \"Chu Wanning moved a stool over and stood on it without making a sound. He stubbornly looked at him.Mo Ran, \"\u2026 Why are you staring at me?\"\"You want to see if I can get the stove.\"\"\u2026 \u2026\"\"Elder Yu Heng doesn't know what you like to eat, but I'm not as heartless as him.\" Chu Wanning expressionlessly said, \"Go rest, I'll cook for you.\"After busying for half a day, Chu Wanning didn't let Mo Ran interfere. Instead, he fiercely held the kitchen knife and cut up the hen's carcass with a fierce look in his eyes. His expression was focused and his movements were stiff. The scene was unbearable to look at.Mo Ran originally wanted to help, but his martial brother's bad temper was very similar to his master's. When he was focused on doing something, he hated to be disturbed. Thus, after asking for a few snubs, Mo Ran could only scratch his head and lie on the bed in a daze to rest.The chicken was finally in the pot. Chu Wanning covered the pot with mud. Just as he was about to turn around and say something to Mo Ran, he suddenly heard a soft voice coming from the entrance of the prison.\"Mo Ran, Martial Brother Xia, are you here?\"When Mo Ran heard this voice, it was as if he was struck by lightning. He immediately jumped off the bed and rushed to the entrance. Through the gap, he first saw a featherman coldly standing outside. However, when he turned his gaze, he saw Shi Mei standing behind her. He was dressed in plain white and had a worried expression on his face. He couldn't help but be overjoyed, \"Shi Mei!You \u2026 Why are you here? \"\"I have something to tell you.\"Shi Mei said, \"The Lord has already received the report and rushed over to the Peach Blossom Spring. He is currently negotiating with the feathermen.How are you? Have you suffered these past few days? \"\"I'm very good. I can eat, drink, and jump.\" Mo Ran paused for a moment, then asked, \"Where's Master?Where is he? \"\"He said that he is still in closed-door cultivation and has not come.\"\"Oh \u2026\" Mo Ran's eyes flickered. He sighed and muttered to himself, \"It's good that he doesn't come \u2026 It's good that he doesn't come.\"\"However, Elder Xuanji is here. He said that he is here to vouch for Martial Brother Xia.\" Shi Mei asked, \"Is Martial Brother Xia sleeping?\"Mo Ran said, \"No, he is making soup.Martial Brother \u2014 Come here quickly! \"Chu Wanning put down the small bamboo fan that he used to fan the fire. He walked to the door and looked at the two people outside. He did not have a surprised expression. He asked calmly, \"What's wrong?\"Before Shi Mei could say anything, the featherman snorted and asked, \"Isn't it because the people from your Life and Death Summit have come? Your Master said that he wants to protect you and is currently negotiating with our Immortal Sovereign.\"\"\u2026 My Master?\"\"Elder Xuanji.\"\"Oh.\" Chu Wanning paused for a moment. He said expressionlessly, \"Very good.\"The featherman curled his lips and said, \"You two can come out. All the Supremes have already gathered at the Dew Pavilion and are waiting to hear your explanations.\"Chu Wanning turned around and looked at the chicken soup that was currently being cooked. He said, \"I'm not going. The soup is halfway done. I can't leave.Mo Ran, you go on my behalf. \"When the featherman heard this, he thought to himself that he was indeed a child who was still wet behind the ears. His words were actually so unreliable. Thus, he laughed coldly and threatened him, \"If you don't go, you will miss the chance to explain yourself. If the verdict is that you killed Miss Eighteen, you will have to pay with your life and lose your head.\"Unexpectedly, Chu Wanning was not afraid at all. Instead, his expression was indifferent. He looked at him coldly, turned around and left.Shi Mei wanted to stop him, but Mo Ran smiled and shook his head, \"Let him be. I'll go.\"\"But Elder Xuanji came from afar. If he doesn't go and greet him, it would be impolite \u2026\"Before Mo Ran could say anything, Chu Wanning said from afar, \"Martial Brother Mo, please send my regards to Master.\"\"\u2026\" He had said it so softly, but he was still heard. Shi Mei couldn't help but feel awkward. He cleared his throat and waited for the featherman to open the brambles outside the prison. He then pulled Mo Ran and prepared to leave.Unexpectedly, at this moment, Chu Wanning turned around and called him, \"Martial Brother.\"\"Martial Brother, have you changed your mind and want to go with me?\" Mo Ran smiled and asked.Chu Wanning waved his sleeves and said, \"I won't go.I'm here to remind you to come back early. If you're late, the soup will be cold. It won't taste good. \"Mo Ran was stunned for a moment and laughed, \"Alright, wait for me.\"\"Okay.\"Chu Wanning didn't say anything else. He waited until Mo Ran had walked far away and disappeared around the corner. Only then did he turn around and focus on boiling the soup.The Dew Pavilion wasn't far from the prison. On the way there, Shi Mei asked, \"Mo Ran, you seem to have gotten closer to Martial Brother Xia these days?\"Mo Ran smiled and said, \"Yes, we've gone through thick and thin together.Why, Shi Mei, are you jealous of a child? \"\"\u2026 You're spouting nonsense.\"\"Hahaha, Shi Mei, don't worry. The one I like the most is still Shi Mei. It won't change.\"\"\u2026 Don't talk nonsense. I just feel that Martial Brother Xia is a little strange \u2026\"\"Strange?Oh \u2026 \"Mo Ran thought for a moment and nodded,\" He is quite strange. \"\"You feel it too?\"\"Yes.\" Mo Ran smiled and said, \"He speaks like an adult at such a young age. His mana shouldn't be underestimated.In addition, I haven't had the time to tell you about the bizarre things that happened in the illusion.Do you know?I suspect that he's a distant relative of our Master. \"Shi Mei's eyes moved slightly and asked, \"What do you mean?\"\"We saw a person in the illusion. He was the son of the governor of Lin 'an two hundred years ago. His surname was also Chu and he looked very much like our Master. He had a son, and his appearance was also \u2026\"Just as he was about to get to the crux of the matter, he suddenly heard a burst of curses in front of him. He looked up and saw Xue Meng striding over with an angry look on his face. He kept on cursing, \"Bastard!Beast!You shameless dog! \"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySeeing Mo Ran out of the blue, Xue Meng was stunned for a moment. This was the first time they met after Mo Ran was imprisoned.Thinking of how Xue Meng protected him in front of everyone, Mo Ran couldn't help but smile at him. However, Xue Meng was shocked by this smile and showed a disgusted expression. He gritted his teeth and said, \"What are you doing?What are you looking at!What's there to look at!What are you laughing at!What's so funny! \"\"\u2026 I'm just greeting you.\"\"Disgusting!\"Mo Ran: \"\u2026\"His arrival interrupted Mo Ran's words. Shi Mei pondered for a while but didn't ask further. Instead, he smiled at Xue Meng and said, \"Young Master, who provoked you again?\"\"Who else could it be?Who else could it be!Shameless!Shameless!Wretched, despicable, obscene, shameless! \"Mo Ran sighed and said, \"It doesn't rhyme well enough.\"\"None of your business!Come if you're so capable! \"\"If you're not capable, then you're not a cultured person.\" Mo Ran smiled and said, \"Tell me, who provoked you?\"Shi Mei smiled and said, \"I'm guessing it's Eldest Senior Brother again.\"\"What bullsh * t Eldest Senior Brother!Beast!Lecher!He's so casual, why didn't he get STDs?!I'm willing to f * cking spend ten years of my life wishing that he'll have ulcers on his head, pus on his feet, and a rotten nose and rotten eyes. Let's see who would fancy him. This despicable, shameless, wretched, obscene \u2026 \"Mo Ran: \"\u2026\"Seeing that Xue Meng was about to fall into an endless loop, Shi Mei hurriedly stopped him and pointed behind him and shouted, \"Shh, look, the female cultivators who like Eldest Senior Brother are here \u2014\"\"Ah!\"Xue Meng was startled, and a trace of panic actually appeared on his usually proud and extravagant face. He cursed in a low voice, \"Lewd and filthy,\" and unexpectedly ran away with his tail between his legs without looking back. He was really as anxious as a stray dog. In the end, he still shouted, \"I remember that I have other important things to do, so I'll leave first!\"Mo Ran watched him disappear like a wisp of smoke and said in a daze, \"Wow, not bad. This Eldest Martial Brother can actually make him so scared.\"Shi Mei held back his laughter and said, \"Ever since he accidentally bumped into someone in a restaurant the day before yesterday and got into a conflict, he's been like this ever since he came back. He's met his nemesis.\"\"Admirable, admirable. If I have the chance, I must see it for myself.\"Although Mo Ran said this, he had a rough idea in his heart. If this \"Eldest Martial Brother\" could make Xue Meng hide like this, it must be the person he guessed.However, this was not the time to see Xue Meng's excitement. In the Dew Pavilion, Xue Zhengyong and Xuanji had already arrived. They were slowly discussing the case of Eighteen's murder with the owner of the Peach Blossom Spring, the Mighty Immortal of the feathermen.The Mighty Immortal of the feathermen had an almost fairy-like body, and her body was surrounded by sparkling spiritual light. Although she looked like a budding young girl, only God knew how old she was.She was slowly explaining the whole story to Xue Zhengyong when a servant came in and said in a low voice, \"Mighty Immortal, he's here.\"\"Let him in.\"Mo Ran followed Shi Mei into the warm room. He looked around and saw Xue Zhengyong waving the famous scholar's fan and talking with someone. He immediately shouted, \"Uncle!\"\"Child, child.\"Xue Zhengyong heard him and turned his head. His eyes lit up and he hurriedly called him over. He patted his shoulder and said, \"Come, sit next to me \u2026\"\"I didn't kill her \u2026\"\"Of course it wasn't you, of course it wasn't you.\" Xue Zhengyong sighed. \"I don't know how this misunderstanding came about, but the Mighty Immortal told me just now.I'm here this time to find a way to prove your innocence. Sigh, the heavens are pitiful. Look at how dejected you are. \"He pulled Mo Ran, and the Mighty Immortal of the feathermen did not stop them. She just looked at the two of them indifferently.Mo Ran greeted Elder Xuanji and then sat next to Xue Zhengyong.However, what made Mo Ran feel strange was that Xuanji did not immediately notice that his disciple Xia Si was not around. He just nodded at Mo Ran naturally.Instead, the Mighty Immortal of the feathermen asked, \"Eh?Where's the other child?The one with the surname Xia. \"\"Ah, yes.\" Xuanji regained his senses. \"\u2026 Where's my disciple?\"Mo Ran saw that he did not care about Xia Si and was slightly dissatisfied. He said, \"My Junior Brother is still in the Heavenly Prison. He asked me to send his regards to you.\"\"I see.\" Xuanji nodded. \"Why didn't he come?\"Mo Ran said unhappily, \"To cook.\"\"\u2026\"Xue Zhengyong was stunned. He laughed. \"Is cooking more important than clearing your name?\"Xuanji also smiled. \"He's really willful and willful. After the meeting, I'll go and see him.\"\"There's no need. We still have to eat after the meeting.\" Mo Ran said, \"How do you want to interrogate him? Hurry up and interrogate him.\"Xue Zhengyong said, \"Mighty Immortal, let's continue from where we left off. Look, there's another Elder in our sect who's good at refining pills. Before we came here, I specially asked him to refine a few red-baby pills.\"\"Red-Baby pills?\"The Exalted Immortal was slightly startled when he heard this. He tapped his lips lightly with his finger that was dyed with the rosy glow of Cardamom. \"Is it the pill that can make mortals speak the truth?\"\"That's right.\"The Mighty Immortal was slightly surprised. \"The ingredients required for this pill are complicated and extremely difficult to refine. Even in the Peach Blossom Spring, it takes at least half a month to refine this pill. I didn't expect you to have such a capable person in your sect. Why didn't you bring him along?\"\"He's a loner and doesn't like to travel with others.\" Xue Zhengyong said. \"The pills are already being refined. They can be sent to the Peach Blossom Spring in ten days.When the time comes, I'll ask you to test the effects of the pills and give them to my disciples. The truth will be revealed. \"\"\u2026\" The Mighty Immortal thought for a moment and nodded. \"This method is feasible.\"Xue Zhengyong sighed in relief and smiled. \"If that's the case, I'll go to the Heavenly Prison and get another disciple.\"\"Wait.\"\"What's wrong?\"The Mighty Immortal said, \"Before the matter is clarified, Mo Weiyu and Xia Si Ni are still suspicious.Even with your guarantee, I can't let the two of them go free. \"When Xue Zhengyong heard this, he closed his fan. Although he had a smile on his face, his eyes were cold. \"Mighty Immortal, it's not right to do this.\"The featherman Mighty Immortal looked up and stared at him with his red eyes. \"Is Lord Xue dissatisfied with my decision?\"\"That's right. Since my two disciples have not been convicted, and Elder Xuanji and I are vouching for them, Mighty Immortal, what's the reason for insisting on imprisoning them?\"\"It can't be considered imprisonment,\" the Mighty Immortal said coldly.\"I didn't mistreat them. I didn't stop providing them with food every day. I just restricted their activities. It's not too much.\"Although Xue Zhengyong was still smiling, it was a cold smile.\"Not too much?As far as I know, the Heavenly Prison doesn't see the sun and the moon. It's a place to imprison criminals. Mighty Immortal, you're really amazing to say that it's not too much. \"A featherman protector immediately stopped him. \"Lord Xue, please watch your words!\"\"What's wrong? Is there anything wrong with my words?I didn't insult your Mighty Immortal. What I said was true. It's just a little less polite. It's not too much. \"When the featherman heard what Xue Zhengyong said, he couldn't help but become angrier. \"You \u2014!\"A jade-like hand reached out and stopped him.The Mighty Immortal looked up and smiled coldly at Xue Zhengyong. \"I've heard rumors that Lord Xue of the Peak of Life and Death is the head of a generation. Although your mana is strong, your knowledge is lacking. You're not good with words. However, after seeing you today, I feel that the rumors are unfair.Lord Xue, you're right. \"Xue Zhengyong smiled at her, but there was no smile in his eyes. \"He's just a rough person. Please don't mind him.\"The featherman Mighty Immortal smiled and took an orange. She peeled it carefully and handed it to Xue Zhengyong. \"Then let's both take a step back.It's impossible for the two of them to be free, but it's not right for them to stay in the prison.I'll immediately order people to bring Xia Si out. Mo Weiyu and Xia Si will stay in Lingxiao Pavilion. That's the place to entertain guests.However, I'll have to send people to keep an eye on them. They can't be allowed to leave the pavilion.How about this? \"Xue Zhengyong was silent for a while. He raised his hand and paused in mid-air. In the end, he took the orange.Although Lingxiao Pavilion was a place to entertain guests, Peach Blossom Spring didn't often have guests.Thus, the pavilion had been deserted for a long time.Since the Mighty Immortal agreed to let them move here, Mo Ran planned to clean up the place himself.After he was done, he would bring Chu Wanning over.Xue Zhengyong and Xuanji still had important matters to discuss. Mo Ran went to Lingxiao Pavilion with Shi Mei under the watchful eyes of a few feathermen.Lingxiao Pavilion was located in the north-west of Peach Blossom Spring.Outside, flowers formed a forest. The mist was like a brocade.\"It's a good place. I won't feel aggrieved living like this.\" Mo Ran said with a smile.Shi Mei sighed, \"How can you not feel aggrieved?You clearly didn't kill them, but you're wrongly accusing a good person.It's a pity that Shizun can't come. If he came, we could use Heaven's Inquisition to interrogate them. There wouldn't be any need for the Red Child Pill. The truth would be revealed. \"\"Haha, Shi Mei's thinking is too simple.Heaven's Inquisition is a divine martial art. Although it can be used to extract the truth, whether or not it works depends on whether the caster has the heart to interrogate them.Do you think those birdmen would be willing to let my Shizun interrogate me?Would they believe me? \"\"\u2026 That's true.\"Seeing that it was almost dusk, Mo Ran began to clean up the house. Shi Mei helped him on the side.Strangely enough, when Mo Ran finished cleaning the house and sat down to drink some tea, he suddenly realized that he wasn't secretly happy that he could be alone with his junior sister. He also didn't have any romantic thoughts.This realization made Mo Ran choke and he almost spat out the tea.His junior sister was startled, \"What's wrong?\"\"No, nothing.\" Mo Ran repeatedly waved his hand, but in his heart he was complaining incessantly.Could it be that after cultivating with Chu Wanning for so long, he had also become a Liu Xiahui?Look at this High Heaven Pavilion. It was a desolate place with no one around. Peach blossoms swayed in the wind, a man and a woman alone. If it was before, he would definitely have spent some time with Shi Mei before getting down to business.What's wrong with him recently?His heart was so pure, it shouldn't be like this \u2026Mo Ran scratched his head.Shi Mei blinked.When their eyes met, Mo Ran grinned, showing his cute dimples, \"The peach blossoms outside are beautiful. I'll pick one for you to take away.\"Shi Mei said, \"Plants also have feelings. Let them bloom on the branches.\"\"Hmm \u2026 you're right. Then, then I won't pick one!\"After sitting for a while, Mo Ran racked his brain, wanting to talk to him again, but he found that the days they spent together were too short, so there was nothing to talk about.Looking up, he suddenly saw that Shi Mei was sweating because he was helping him take care of the room. He couldn't bear it, so he took out a handkerchief and handed it to him.\"Wipe your sweat.\"\"\u2026 \u2026\" Shi Mei looked down and saw Mo Ran nervously holding the handkerchief. He couldn't help but smile and say warmly, \"Thank you.\"So he took the handkerchief and gently wiped his forehead.The handkerchief was soft to the touch, made of excellent natural silk. After Shi Mei used it, he said, \"I'll take the handkerchief back and wash it before returning it to you.\"\"Good, good, good.\"Mo Ran repeatedly agreed. His ingratiation towards Shi Mei was so deep that it had become instinct. \"If you like it, you don't have to return it.\"Shi Mei smiled, \"I'm afraid that's not appropriate. Look at how well made this handkerchief is \u2026 \u2026\" As he spoke, he unfolded the handkerchief, preparing to smooth out the creases and fold it again.But when his slender white fingers brushed across the unfolded handkerchief, Shi Mei was stunned. He softly said, \"Huh?\"\"What's wrong?\"Shi Mei paused, then looked up and smiled, \"Mo Ran really wants to give this handkerchief to me?\"\"If you like it, then take it.What's mine is yours. \"Mo Ran was very generous.Shi Mei's eyes were smiling faintly, \"Borrowing flowers to offer Buddha Flowers. Aren't you afraid that Shizun will beat you when he finds out?\"\"What?\" This time it was Mo Ran's turn to be stunned, \"What do you mean by borrowing flowers to offer Buddha Flowers?What does this have to do with Shizun? \"\"You see for yourself.\"There was an inexplicable meaning in Shi Mei's tone. \"Such a big begonia flower. When did Master give his handkerchief to you?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"\u2026 \u2026\"Mo Ran was dumbstruck.After a long time, he scratched his ears and cheeks as he regained his senses. He repeatedly waved his hands, \"No, that, I don't know. This isn't my handkerchief, then where did my handkerchief go?\u2026 \u2026 I-I-I, sigh, I really can't clear my name even if I jump into the Yellow River \u2026 \u2026 \"He stared at the silk handkerchief embroidered with faint begonia flower marks, but couldn't remember how he got such an item.He anxiously pondered for a long time, then suddenly slapped his head.\"Ah!\"\"\u2026 \u2026 What's wrong \u2026 \u2026\"\"I remember now!\"Mo Ran let out a sigh of relief and took the handkerchief back from Shi Mei's hands. He smiled, \"I'm sorry, this handkerchief really isn't mine, I can't give it to you.\"Shi Mei, \"\u2026 \u2026\"I didn't say I wanted it.\"But this isn't Shizun's either. Don't think Haitang is Shizun's.\"Mo Ran folded the handkerchief and put it back into his pocket. He was obviously relieved that he didn't take his Shizun's handkerchief by mistake, \"This handkerchief is Junior Xia's.\"Shi Mei thought for a while, \"Junior Xia's?\"\"Yes, I've been living with him these days. Maybe I washed the handkerchief and took the wrong one in the morning. Haha, I'm really sorry.\"\"\u2026 \u2026 En, it's okay.\"Shi Mi still smiled gently. Then, he stood up and said, \"It's getting late. Let's go and bring Junior Xia over.\"The two left the house and went straight to the prison cell.However, they didn't go too far before Shi Mei's footsteps gradually slowed down. At first, it wasn't obvious, but he suddenly tripped over a piece of rock and almost fell. Fortunately, Mo Ran was walking beside him and caught him in time.Mo Ran saw that his face was pale and bloodless, and couldn't help but ask in surprise, \"What's wrong?\"\"It's okay,\" Shi Mei took a deep breath and said, \"I didn't eat much for lunch, so I don't have much energy. I'll be fine after some rest.\"The more vaguely he tried to muddle through, the more concerned Mo Ran became. After thinking about it carefully, he realized that Shi Mei's Qing Gong was not good, so he had to exchange his Peach Blossom Spring for his food and clothes. In the past, he had plucked feathers and given them to Shi Mei. Now that he had been locked up, Xue Meng was a brainless person who did not know how to take care of others \u2026The more Mo Ran thought about it, the more worried he became. He said, \"When you were in the sect, you often didn't eat lunch, but I've never seen you so weak.How are you saying that you haven't eaten anything?Tell me the truth, how long have you been hungry? \"\"I \u2026\"Seeing that he didn't say anything, Mo Ran's face became more and more gloomy. He pulled him in the opposite direction.Shi Mei hurriedly said, \"Mo Ran, where, where are you going?\"\"I'll take you to eat!\"Mo Ran said fiercely, but when he turned around, his eyes were full of heartache. \"Can't you take care of yourself when I'm not around?You always think about others, and you always think about others before you do anything!But what about you?Have you ever thought about yourself? \"\"Mo Ran \u2026\"He dragged Shi Mei all the way to the tavern. Logically speaking, Shi Mei belonged to the Healing Element, so without a token, he could not come to the Offensive Element encampment where Mo Ran and the others were used to staying.However, ever since Eighteen's accident, everyone was in a state of panic. In order to deal with unexpected situations, the feathermen had already removed the restrictions between the different elements.\"What do you want to eat?Order yourself. \"\"Just something will do.\"Shi Mei seemed to feel a little guilty. \"I'm sorry. I wanted to come here to help, but in the end, I still dragged you down \u2026\"\"What's there to be sorry about between you and me?\"Mo Ran stretched out his hand and flicked his forehead. He softened his tone and said, \"Order. After you order, I'll pay for it. You can sit down and eat.\"Shi Mei was startled. \"What about you?\"\"I have to go and pick up Junior Brother Xia. The culprit has not been caught.Although there are guards around the prison, I'm still worried. \"Hearing that Mo Ran was about to leave, Shi Mei's eyes seemed to dim for a moment. However, he quickly said, \"Just buy two steamed buns. I'll go with you. We can eat as we walk.\"Mo Ran was about to stop him when he suddenly heard the sound of chirping outside the tavern. More than ten beautifully dressed young female cultivators entered the tavern, giggling.\"Manager, I want to ask you something.\"The leading girl smiled and asked, \"Eldest Senior Brother \u2026 Did you book a banquet at this tavern tonight?\"\"That's right, that's right.\" The shopkeeper beamed with joy.These days, these feathermen had found out that their eldest senior brother loved to drink and listen to music. Every night, he would find a tavern to hold a banquet.Wherever their \"eldest senior brother\" was, there would be a group of chattering female cultivators swarming in.As expected, those female cultivators immediately became more and more excited. They hurriedly wanted to book a table. From time to time, a few sentences would float into Mo Ran's ears.They were talking about things like, \"Xiao Fang, look at my eyebrows today. Do you think they look good?Will eldest senior brother like them? \"\"They look good, they look good. Then look at my eye makeup. It's a bit too bright. Will he think I'm frivolous?\"There were also things like, \"You're so beautiful, eldest senior brother will definitely like you. I saw him looking at you a few times yesterday.\"\"Aiya, you're so annoying. How is that possible? Big Sister's temperament is still the best. Eldest Senior Brother will definitely like a talented girl like Big Sister.\"\"\u2026 \u2026\"At such a critical time, these people could still be so infatuated with a man. Mo Ran's mouth twitched. He turned to his junior sister and said, \"Steamed buns it is. We'll leave after we buy them. I'm also worried about leaving you alone in this tiger's den.\"Shi Mei looked at his expression and couldn't help but gently smile and shake his head.The most delicious food in this building was the unstoppable Big Steamed Pork Bun. Mo Ran bought ten of them in one go and gave them all to Shi Mei.Walking on the road, Mo Ran glanced at Shi Mei from time to time and finally relaxed a bit.However, no one would have thought that it was these steamed buns that would cause Shi Mei to be injured.His stomach was already weak to begin with. He hadn't eaten a single grain of rice for a long time, so when he suddenly ate these greasy steamed buns, his stomach couldn't bear the bursts of cramping pain.This time, Mo Ran was completely unable to pick up Chu Wanning. He hurriedly carried the pale and sweaty Shi Mei back to High Heaven Pavilion and placed him on the bed that had just been cleaned. Then he went outside to call for a doctor.After prescribing medicine and feeding him warm water, Mo Ran sat on the bed and looked at Shi Mei's haggard appearance. He blamed himself, \"Does it still hurt?I'll help you rub it. \"Shi Mei's voice was very soft and weak, \"No need \u2026 it's fine \u2026\"However, Mo Ran's slender hand had already reached over and was gently rubbing his stomach.Perhaps because the pressure was just right, it was very comfortable. In the end, Shi Mei didn't say anything and gradually relaxed his breathing and fell into a deep sleep.Mo Ran stayed until he fell asleep and then prepared to leave.However, before he could get up, his hand was caught.Mo Ran's eyes suddenly widened. His black eyes flashed with a faint purple light, \"Shi Mei \u2026?\"\"It hurts \u2026 don't go \u2026\"The beauty on the bed still had his eyes closed, as if he was sleep-talking.Mo Ran stood there in a daze. Shi Mei had never asked anyone to do anything for him. He had always been the one helping others without asking for anything in return. Only when he was in deep sleep would he ask Mo Ran to stay.Thus, she sat back down on the edge of the bed. While looking at the face that she yearned for day and night, she continued to rub his stomach. Outside the open window, peach blossoms drifted down, and the sky was finally dark.When Mo Ran suddenly remembered that he had promised his junior brother for dinner, it was already midnight.\"It's over!\" Mo Ran suddenly jumped up and patted his head, \"It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over!\"At this time, Shi Mei was also in deep sleep. Mo Ran took a big stride and wanted to run to the prison cell.However, a blue light suddenly lit up the sky. Elder Xuanji was carrying a child in his arms, and the child was carrying a small jar. The two people descended from the sky.\"Elder!\"Xuanji glanced at Mo Ran with slight reproach, \"What happened?Didn't you say that you were going to pick him up?If I wasn't worried and went to take a look, Yu \u2026 cough, I mean my disciple would have to wait in the prison until tomorrow morning. \"\"It's my fault,\" Mo Ran lowered his head. After a while, he couldn't help but look up at Chu Wanning, \"Junior brother \u2026\"Xuanji put Chu Wanning down. Chu Wanning held the jar and quietly looked at Mo Ran, \"Have you eaten dinner?\"He didn't expect that the first thing he said would be this. Mo Ran stared blankly, \"No, not yet \u2026\"Chu Wanning walked over and gave him the jar. He said calmly, \"It's still warm, drink some.\"Mo Ran stood in place and didn't move for a long time.When he reacted, he had already picked up the little fellow and the jar and held them in his arms.\"Okay, I'll drink.\"The silly child was afraid that the soup would be cold, so he took off his outer robe and wrapped it around the jar. Therefore, his small body was slightly cold when he held it.Mo Ran touched his forehead and gently rubbed it. He blurted out the words that he had never said in his two lives, \"I'm sorry, it's my fault.\"After saying goodbye to Xuanji, the two returned to the room.The outer robe was already wrinkled and couldn't be worn anymore. Mo Ran was afraid that the child would be cold, so he went to the room and found a small blanket for Chu Wanning.Chu Wanning yawned and climbed onto the stool with the jar in his arms. He was about to get two small bowls of soup.Suddenly, he blinked twice and his gaze fell on the meat bun that Shi Mei left behind.\"\u2026 \u2026\"Jumping off the stool, Chu Wanning walked to the bedroom and looked at the beauty lying on the bed with no expression on his face. He didn't get angry and didn't say anything. He only felt that there were traces of coldness coming from his bones. His heart, which was still warm just a moment ago, was frozen to ice.When Mo Ran returned to the kitchen, Chu Wanning was still sitting by the window at the table. One foot was on the stool and the other was hanging down. His arm was casually resting on the window frame.Hearing the movement, he turned around and glanced at Mo Ran.\"Here, I found a firefox blanket. Put it on first, it's cold at night.\"Chu Wanning didn't say anything.Mo Ran walked over and handed the blanket to him. Chu Wanning didn't take it. He just shook his head and slowly closed his eyes, as if he was resting.\"What's wrong?You don't like it? \"\"\u2026 \u2026\"\"Then I'll find another one for you to see if there's anything else.\"Mo Ran smiled and rubbed Chu Wanning's hair. He turned around and was about to find another one when he suddenly found that the pot on the table was gone.He couldn't help but be stunned, \"Where's my soup?\"\"Who said it's yours?\" Chu Wanning finally spoke. His voice was cold, \"It's mine.\"Mo Ran's mouth twitched. He thought that he was throwing a tantrum, \"Okay, okay, okay, it's yours. Then where's your soup?\"Chu Wanning said indifferently, \"Throw it away.\"\"Throw, throw it away \u2026 \u2026?\"Chu Wanning ignored him and lightly jumped off the stool. He turned around and pushed the door open.\"Hey?Shidi?Shidi, where are you going? \"Mo Ran didn't have time to take the blanket. The murderer was still unknown and it wasn't safe outside. He quickly followed him out.He saw that under the peach blossom tree, the small pot that contained the soup was still clumsily placed there. It hadn't been thrown away.Mo Ran let out a sigh of relief. He thought that he was in the wrong. Little Shidi didn't get angry just now because he was suppressing it. After suppressing it for a while, he realized that he couldn't take it anymore. There was nothing wrong with throwing a tantrum.So he walked over and sat beside Chu Wanning.Chu Wanning was under the peach blossom tree. He picked up his small pot and ignored Mo Ran. He opened the lid alone and took a spoon that was bigger than his face. He wanted to reach in to scoop the soup but found that he couldn't reach in at all. He couldn't help but become angrier. With a bang, he smashed the spoon and sat there holding the pot in a daze.Mo Ran supported his cheek and turned his head to the side to give him an idea, \"You can just drink it.There's only the two of us here anyway. It's not embarrassing. \"\"\u2026 \u2026\"\"You don't want to drink?If you don't want to drink, then I'll drink it. This is the first time my Shidi has made soup for me. I can't waste it. \"He wanted to tease him. As he spoke, he smiled and was about to snatch the pot.Unexpectedly, Chu Wanning slapped his hand away, \"Get lost.\"\"\u2026 \u2026\" Mo Ran blinked. He felt that this conversation was somewhat familiar. But then he put on a thick-skinned smile and leaned over, \"Shidi, it's my fault. Don't be angry.I wanted to come and pick you up a long time ago, but your Shidi Mingjing suddenly felt unwell, so I delayed it.I didn't mean to make you wait. \"Chu Wanning still kept his head down and didn't say anything.\"Then you see, I've been busy until now and haven't eaten dinner.I'm really hungry. \"Mo Ran pulled on his sleeve pitifully, \"Shidi, kind Shidi, my good Shidi, I beg you. Just give your Shidi a mouthful of soup.\"\"\u2026 \u2026\"Chu Wanning moved a little and finally put the pot of soup on the ground. She slightly raised her head and tilted it a little, but still turned away.He meant to let Mo Ran take the soup himself.Mo Ran smiled, \"Thank you, Shidi.\"The small pot was filled to the brim. With one look, he knew that his Shidi ate very little and left more than half of the meat for him. So there was a lot of meat and very little soup.Mo Ran stared at it for a while. His eyes curved and he said warmly, \"How is this soup? It's obviously a pot of stewed meat.Shidi is so kind. \"\"\u2026 \u2026\"Mo Ran didn't say much. He took care of Shi Mei for half a day, so he was really hungry. Moreover, this was his Shidi's kind intention, so he couldn't waste it.He broke two thin branches of a peach tree and used his fingers to trim the rough branches. He used them as chopsticks and put a piece of chicken into his mouth.\"Wow, it smells so good.\"Mo Ran had the chicken in his mouth, and his eyes were misty. He smiled and said, \"It's delicious.My Shidi is really capable. \"Actually, this pot of soup wasn't delicious. It was too salty, but in order to make his Shidi happy, Mo Ran ate it with all his might. Soon, he ate more than half of the chicken. Chu Wanning didn't look at him from beginning to end, and sat silently at the side.He drank a big mouthful of soup. The soup was saltier than the meat, and it was even a bit bitter, but it was still tolerable.Mo Ran picked up a chicken leg and was about to put it into his mouth when he suddenly froze, \"How many legs does a chicken have?\"Naturally, no one paid attention to him.Mo Ran answered himself, \"Two.\"Then he looked at the chicken leg between his chopsticks, and then looked at the remaining bone that he had just eaten.\"\u2026 \u2026\"This slow person finally raised his head and asked Chu Wanning in a daze, \"Shidi, you \u2026 \u2026 did you \u2026 \u2026\" He didn't have the courage to ask the second half of the sentence.Did you wait for me all this time and didn't eat dinner?This pot of soup is full of meat. Did you wait for me until the soup was almost dry, and only the meat was left? After fighting, there was only a pitiful little bit left, and I thought \u2026 \u2026I thought you had eaten \u2026 \u2026 and left some for me \u2026 \u2026 I thought you didn't have good culinary skills, and made a good chicken soup into stewed chicken \u2026 \u2026Mo Ran silently put down the pot.But he discovered it too late. There were only a few pieces of meat left in the pot.Chu Wanning finally spoke.His voice was still calm and pleasant, with a bit of the tenderness and clarity of a child.\"You said you would come back for dinner.That's why I waited. \"He said slowly, without joy or sorrow, \"If you don't want to eat, at least ask someone to pass a message. Don't let me be a fool.Is that okay? \"\"Shidi \u2026 \u2026\"Chu Wanning still didn't look at him. He turned his face sideways, so Mo Ran couldn't see his expression.\"Ask someone to pass a message to me. Tell me you went to accompany Shidi \u2026 \u2026 Tell me you went to accompany Shidi Mingjing.Is it difficult? \"\"\u2026 \u2026\"\"You took my pot. Before you drank the soup, you talked so much. Ask me if I've eaten.Is it difficult? \"\"\u2026 \u2026\"\"Before you eat, look clearly at how many drumsticks there are in the pot. Is it difficult?\" The last sentence was a little funny. It made people feel ashamed, but they still couldn't help but laugh.But Mo Ran's dimples froze before they melted.Little Shidi was crying.If he was in his adult form, he definitely wouldn't cry over such a small matter. But no one knew that the Heart-Picking Willow had caused his body to shrink. Although his mind wouldn't be affected too much, it would still be affected to a certain extent.If his body was weak, it would be easier for him to approach the mentality of a child.This concealment was extremely difficult to detect. That was why Madam Wang and Elder Tanlang didn't notice it when they checked his pulse.\"I also feel hungry, I also feel uncomfortable. I'm also human \u2026 \u2026\" Even though his child mentality took the upper hand, Chu Wanning still suppressed it. He silently choked with sobs, but his shoulders couldn't stop trembling. Tears rolled down his face, his eyes red and wet.For so many years, Elder Yu Heng had endured. No one liked him, no one accompanied him. He always pretended not to care. He walked coldly among the people who respected him.But only when his mentality was affected by the thoughts of a child would he speak the truth. Only then would he break down. Only then would he speak the depression that had accumulated for so long.It wasn't that he didn't treat others well. It was just that he did many things in silence.But doing it in silence, no one saw, no one cared. After a long time, it was also torturous.Mo Ran saw his Little Shidi's shoulders tremble slightly. He felt bad and reached out to touch. But before he could touch, he was mercilessly slapped away.\"Shidi \u2026 \u2026\"\"Don't touch me.\"In the end, Chu Wanning was a strong-willed person, regardless of whether he was young or old. He fiercely wiped his tears and suddenly stood up. \"I'm going to sleep. You can go accompany your junior brother. Get the hell away from me.\"\"\u2026\"In his anger, he even forgot that Shi Mei was actually older than Mo Ran.Mo Ran opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but Chu Wanning had already left. He quickly entered another bedroom and closed the door with a bang.But in High Heaven Pavilion, each courtyard only had two bedrooms.Mo Ran's original plan was to let Shiguan sleep in her own room while he squeezed in with his Junior Brother. However, his Junior Brother was so angry that he even locked the door. It seemed that they couldn't go to his room.He didn't want to sleep on Shi Mei's bed.What's more, after being scolded by Chu Wanning and making him cry, Mo Ran's mind was a mess. He simply didn't have the heart to think about other things. He just sat in the courtyard full of blooming peach blossoms, holding the jar that Chu Wanning brought for him.After a long time, he sighed and raised his hand to slap himself, cursing in a low voice, \"You're a worthless thing.\"So that night, Mo Ran simply used the sky as a cover and the ground as a mat. He lay on the ground full of peach blossoms and blankly looked at the dome of the sky.Little Shidi \u2026 \u2026 Shi Mei \u2026 \u2026 Shizun \u2026 \u2026 Xue Meng \u2026 \u2026 The fake North Star under the Jincheng Pool, the murderer who hasn't shown himself \u2026 \u2026 Chu Xun and his son in the illusion \u2026 \u2026Many vague shadows flashed in front of his eyes. He vaguely felt that something was wrong, but that feeling was so weak that he didn't even notice it.The peach blossoms were bright and dazzling.Raising his hand to catch a falling peach blossom, Mo Ran carefully looked at the scarlet soul under the moonlight.In an instant, it was as if he returned to the end of his previous life. He laid in the coffin that was cast in advance. That day, the flowers on the mountain withered and fell silently.But the one who fell was a begonia.Begonia \u2026 \u2026Why was it that he, in both his previous and current lives, loved Shi Mei, but before he died, he mysteriously buried himself under the begonia tree, in front of the Tower of Babel, in the place where he first met Chu Wanning?There were many things that he did in his previous life that made him shudder in fear when he thought about it. In his second life, the longer he lived, the more he couldn't understand why he did such a cruel thing in the past.Massacring the city, bullying, murdering his master \u2026 \u2026 and forcing Chu Wanning to do such a thing with him \u2026 \u2026Mo Ran threw away the peach blossom, covered his forehead with his hand, and slowly closed his eyes.Little Junior Brother had just said, \"I will be hungry, I will be sad, I am also human\". This sentence had been lingering in his ears. The person who said it was Little Junior Brother, but for a moment, another person's figure suddenly appeared in Mo Ran's mind.It was a man wearing a snow-white robe.In the blink of an eye, the white robe turned into a scarlet phoenix robe, which dragged on the ground. It was very similar to the ghost master's appearance in the illusion of a ghost wedding.\"I am also a human \u2026 \u2026\"I will be sad, I will be in pain.Mo Ran \u2026 \u2026I will also be in pain.Mo Ran suddenly felt a strong sense of suffocation in his heart, as if something was about to burst out. Fine beads of cold sweat seeped out of his forehead.He closed his eyes, slowly gasping for breath.He muttered, \"\u2026 \u2026 I'm sorry \u2026 \u2026\"He didn't know who he was apologizing to, Little Junior Brother, or that old friend in the scarlet phoenix robe \u2026 \u2026In the bedroom, Shi Mei sat up.He didn't turn on the light, and quietly went to the window with his bare feet. Through the gap in the window, he looked at Mo Ran who was lying in the middle of the flower petals, one hand still holding the pot. His eyes were dim, and he didn't know what he was thinking.The next morning, Mo Ran who was lying in the middle of the flower petals wrinkled his nose, took a big breath of fresh air, stretched his body and prepared to get up.But before he could stretch his body halfway, he suddenly heard a scream cut through the silence of Sky Tower.\"Ah \u2014 \u2014!!!\"Mo Ran suddenly opened his eyes and got up with a grunt. The scene in front of him made his bones and blood turn cold, and he was stunned!The fifteen elite feathermen who were in charge of guarding Sky Tower were all strangled to death in one night. The way they died was exactly the same as Eighteen, with a bright red willow vine tied around their necks.\u2014 \u2014 What the hell!Those fifteen people were hung in the middle of Sky Tower's flourishing peach blossom forest, their red sleeves fluttering, their long skirts touching the ground, and their bodies slightly swaying with the wind blowing through the forest. They looked like fifteen dried flowers, gloomy and beautiful.The one who screamed was a low level featherman who came to deliver breakfast. She was so scared that she was trembling, and the bamboo basket in her hand had already fallen to the ground, spilling the porridge and pastries inside.Seeing Mo Ran standing in the courtyard, the featherman trembled even more. She trembled as she put her hands behind her back, and took out something behind her back.Mo Ran subconsciously went forward and said, \"No, listen to me \u2026 \u2026\"It was too late, that featherman had touched the Collapse Spell tattoo on her back.The Collapse Spell was the most important communication method for feathermen. In almost an instant, all the feathermen in the peach blossom forest transformed into fiery red wings and descended from the sky.And the scene in front of them made everyone stunned.\"Sister!!\"\"Sister \u2014 \u2014!\"After a moment of silence, the feathermen burst out with heart-wrenching screams and cries.This huge commotion attracted the attention of the cultivators of Peach Blossom Spring one after another.Cries of shock, suspicion, anger, and howls quickly surrounded the entire Sky Tower.\"Mo Ran!What do you have to say now!? \"\"Murderer!You're crazy! \"Those feathermen were already seething with anger, as they screamed and cried, \"A murderer must pay with his life!Kill him!Kill him! \"Mo Ran really did not know how to defend himself. He said, \"If I were the murderer, why would I stay in Sky Tower and not leave if I could kill them all?Why would I wait for you to catch me? \"A red-haired featherman scolded with tears and snot, \"Pei!It's already like this, and you, you still have the face \u2026 \u2026 \"Another person said angrily, \"If you aren't the murderer, why did the murderer kill all the guards but not you?\"\"That's right!\"\"You really can't judge a book by its cover!\"\"Even if the murderer isn't you, it's definitely someone related to you!Otherwise, why didn't he kill you!?Tell me! \"\"A debt of blood must be paid with blood!\"Mo Ran was so angry that he wanted to laugh.In his previous life, he killed people like flies, and no one dared to mention \"a debt of blood must be paid with blood\" to him. In this life, he was not the murderer, but he was wrongly accused. This world is really \u2026 \u2026 He closed his eyes and was about to say something, when suddenly, a red ray of light flew over from the horizon.The featherman high immortal floated down from the clouds, coldly looking around with an ugly expression.\"Mo Weiyu.\"\"High Immortal.\"The featherman high immortal stared at him for a while, then walked to one of the corpses and lifted the blood-stained willow vine on the corpse's neck.\"Where's your weapon?Let me see it. \"\"\u2026 \u2026\"\"You don't want to?\"Mo Ran sighed. His weapon was the ghost. During this period of cultivation, who knows how many people had seen it, and when Eighteen was in trouble, a large group of people had seen it.Taking it out now, comparing the ghost with the willow vine on the dead feathermen's necks, it would undoubtedly add another heavy blow to his crime.But if he did not take it out, then he would be guilty of a crime.With a whoosh, a blazing red radiance appeared in his palm. The ghost materialized from his flesh and blood, flowing with a hissing red splendor. \"If Exalted Immortal wants to see, then let's see.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEveryone stared at the ghost, then looked at the fiery red willow vine on the dead featherman's neck. They could not help but become even more agitated.\"It's you!You look exactly the same as when you killed Eighteen! \"\"Why are you so ruthless?\"\"Kill him!\"The featherman immortal seemed to be having a headache from all the noise. She held her forehead and coldly said: \"Mo Weiyu, I will ask you one last time. Did you kill him?\"\"No.\"\"Good.\"The featherman immortal nodded. Mo Ran originally thought that she was going to let him go. He heaved a sigh of relief and was about to thank her for being so understanding.However, the next moment, the featherman immortal immortal raised her hand and coldly said:\"This person committed all kinds of evil and still wants to quibble. Capture him.\"Shi Mei washed up and dressed neatly in the house. When he came out, he saw that Mo Ran was restrained by more than ten high level feathermen using incantations. Someone was wrapping the Immortal Binding Rope around his wrist.\"What are you doing?!\"Shi Mei's expression changed. He hurriedly ran in front of Mo Ran: \"What happened?\"No one answered him. However, the floating corpses in the peach forest had already given him the answer.Shi Mei gasped and took a step back. He bumped into Mo Ran's chest.\"Mo Ran \u2026\"\"Don't be anxious. Calm down.\"Mo Ran stared at the featherman immortal immortal. He lowered his voice and said to Shi Mei: \"Go and invite Uncle and Elder Xuanji here.\"In this situation, these feathermen might not be able to maintain their rationality. If the feathermen did not care and wanted to tear him apart, with his current strength, he had no chance of winning. He had to quickly drag Xue Zhengyong and Xuanji here to save the situation.After Shi Mei left, Mo Ran stood alone. His burning gaze swept past the angry and twisted faces one by one.\"Pei!\"Suddenly, a mouthful of spit flew out from the crowd. Mo Ran dodged to the side, but the featherman who spat at him was very close to him, so he couldn't avoid being splashed by the spit.He slowly turned around and met a pair of crimson eyes.\"You killed so many people and you still want to call for reinforcements?I'll take your life now!! \"As he spoke, a cluster of blazing flames suddenly gathered in his palm, and he threw it straight at Mo Ran!Mo Ran took a step back. The hot flames burned past his temples and smashed into a peach tree behind him. In an instant, the thick tree trunk was burned to the waist.Boom!The peach tree fell, and the flowers scattered all over the ground like a snowstorm.Mo Ran looked at the fallen tree, then turned to look at the featherman: \"I'll say it again, I didn't kill him. Ten days later, the Childbirth Pill will be completed. If you want to seek revenge, it won't be too late then.\"\"Ten days later?If we wait another ten days, I'm afraid everyone in the Peach Blossom Spring will be killed by you! \"That person roared angrily:\" You can trade for my elder sister's life! \"As he spoke, he pounced at Mo Ran again.Mo Ran dodged his attack again, but his gaze fell on the featherman Exalted Immortal who was watching from the side. She didn't have any intention of helping.Mo Ran was even more flustered by the anger in his heart. He shouted at her: \"Hey!Old bird!Why don't you take care of your people? \"\"\u2026 \u2026\"\"Damn it.\"Mo Ran saw that she still didn't move, and couldn't help but curse: \"You're pretending to be deaf and mute at this juncture, do you want to see me burn alive?If I knew that you bunch of stinking birds don't have the ability to distinguish right from wrong, I wouldn't have come to this bullshit Peach Blossom Spring to cultivate!I still have to suffer such injustice for no reason! \"When the Exalted Immortal heard this, her expression changed slightly. She raised her sleeves, and with a wave of her sleeves, she swept out like a rainbow. With a slap, it was fierce and accurate \u2014 \u2014But it landed on Mo Ran's face.Although the feathermen looked similar to mortals, their thoughts were still different from mortals.In the cultivation world, not to mention the leader of a clan, even the leader of a small dojo wouldn't jump to conclusions without concrete evidence.However, the feathermen were half beasts, and they still had a strong bestial nature in their bones.The Exalted Immortal's black hair turned crimson red, and each strand seemed to be emitting boiling hot air. Her beautiful eyes opened wide, and she said in a cold voice:\"Who is your master?He actually taught such a filthy disciple!And you better clean your mouth! \"When she said this, the other feathermen all let out loud cries. Pairs of crimson eyes were filled with killing intent, and they closed in on Mo Ran.With a whoosh!An orange arrowhead formed by flames broke through the air, and pierced towards Mo Ran's heart.Mo Ran didn't dare to be negligent. He shook out the flowing flames and used [Ghost Flash] to block. However, that arrowhead was actually just a smokescreen. When he leaned his body to block, a featherman who had lost a close relative crossed his sword. The sword light was like water, and it was aimed towards Mo Ran's back!There was an arrowhead in front of him, and a long sword behind him. Originally, it was impossible for him to escape.Mo Ran knew that these half-beasts finally had the intention to kill. He steeled his heart, and in his mind, he thought of Chu Wanning's Heaven's Inquisition. He raised his hand and waved his wrist \u2014 \u2014The [Ghost Flash] was thrown into the air, and then suddenly tightened. The blood-red willow vines danced, forming a blurry shadow, and with lightning speed, they formed a strong air mass. The willow leaves on the vines instantly became sharp knives, absorbing the surrounding air and objects, and cutting them.One of Chu Wanning's ultimate moves \u2014 \u2014 \"Wind!\"Using the vines as wind leaves, he used spiritual power to absorb everything around him.Everything that was sucked into the wind would be crushed into powder and buried in the wind, leaving no remains behind!\"Ah!!!\"The featherman let out a scream. The arrowhead that she had thrown earlier had already been crushed into pieces by the [Ghost Flash]. Her long sword was also suddenly swept in because it was too close to Mo Ran.\"Clang!\"The sound of metal breaking was sharp and ear-piercing. Before she could react, she was also sucked to the scarlet edge of the \"wind\". She hissed, \"Let go of me!Madman!You're a madman! \"Seeing that her people were suffering, the featherman immortal flew into a rage. Her red dress fluttered, and she floated up.She held an extremely pure crimson crystal in her palm. Her sleeves fluttered, and she channeled her spiritual power into it. The Peach Blossom Spring suddenly became turbulent, and the grass and trees fell.An illusory fire phoenix faintly appeared behind her under her command. The immortal's eyes were so red that it seemed like they were going to drip blood. Her originally beautiful face was even a little distorted.\"Beast.\" She hissed, \"Why aren't you stopping?\"\"You've already summoned the illusion of the phoenix. If I stop now, would I be waiting for death?\"Mo Ran's face was illuminated by the enormous shadow of the fire phoenix. \"I'll stop if you stop first!\"\"You \u2014\"The featherman immortal slowly rose into the air.\"No \u2014\"She paused after every word, and her blood-red eyes stared straight at Mo Ran.\"Qualifications \u2014\"\"With me \u2014\"\"In terms of requirements!\"As her voice fell, a loud explosion sounded in the air. The illusion of the phoenix let out a clear cry, and spiraled down toward Mo Ran!\"Bang!!\"Another boom sounded, and this one was even more terrifying than the previous one. It was as if an azure dragon had ended its eternal slumber and emerged from the depths of the earth's core.A ray of golden light violently collided with the fire phoenix, setting off layers upon layers of terrifying shockwaves.The weaker feathermen screamed as they were thrown to the ground by this storm. Some of them directly vomited blood and were sent flying dozens of feet away.For a moment, sand and pebbles were sent flying in Sky Tower. The wind was chaotic, and the buildings and trees were instantly razed to the ground!When the dust settled, a familiar slender figure appeared in the air, blocking in front of Mo Ran.\"Mas, Master \u2026?!\"That person was dressed in white, and his wide sleeves billowed in the wind. Hearing the voice, he slightly turned his cold and handsome face, and a pair of phoenix eyes swept past Mo Ran, who was kneeling on the ground.Chu Wanning's voice was cold, like the clear water in a well in the middle of summer.\"Are you injured?\"Mo Ran opened his eyes wide, and for a long time he could not react. He could only stare blankly with his mouth open: \"\u2026\"Chu Wanning looked him up and down. Seeing that there were no obvious injuries on his body, he turned to the featherman and said: \"Just now, didn't you ask who his Master was?\"He released his terrifyingly powerful spiritual energy, and slowly descended from the air to the ground.He did not even bother to say a word, and only said coldly: \"The pinnacle of life and death, Chu Wanning. Please enlighten me.\"\"Wh, what?\"Chu Wanning frowned, and his eyes were like heavy jade.It seemed that these birds did not listen to polite words. That was good, anyway, his patience was running out.\"I said, his Master is me.\" After a pause, he said: \"You hurt my disciple, did you get my permission?\"Although the featherman immortals were respected as immortals, because of their noble bloodline, they were still far from being real immortals.Under this attack, not only was the phoenix illusion shattered by Chu Wanning, but her arm was also cut by Heaven's Inquisition.She covered her wound, and sticky black blood oozed out from between her fingers. Her face was very ugly.\"You, you are just a mortal, how dare you be so presumptuous!Also, who allowed you to enter the Peach Blossom Spring!How did you get in?! \"She was a little crazy.\" You don't know the immensity of heaven and earth \u2014 \"\"Swoosh!\"Heaven's Inquisition came out, and directly slapped her face, breaking the corner of her mouth and causing blood to flow out.\"What do you mean by I don't know the immensity of heaven and earth?\"Chu Wanning sneered, and smoothed out his slightly messy sleeves when he swung the willow vine. Then, he grabbed Mo Ran's collar with one hand, and lifted him up, but his eyes never left the featherman immortal. \"Tell me, what do you mean by I don't know the immensity of heaven and earth?\"\"You, you, you dare to do this, you \u2014\"\"Why wouldn't I dare?\" Chu Wanning looked at her indifferently. \"Why wouldn't I dare?\" After a pause, he picked up Mo Ran, who was beside him. \"Listen, this person is mine, I'm taking him away.\"Mo Ran had not yet recovered from the shock of Chu Wanning's sudden arrival, and was crushed by the words \"this person is mine\".\"Mas \u2026 Master \u2026\"\"Shut your dog mouth.\"Although Chu Wanning was still expressionless, Mo Ran could clearly see the anger in his eyes. \"You can't do anything right, you only cause trouble for me.\"After saying that, he slapped the back of Mo Ran's head, and took him up into the air. In a flash, they were dozens of feet away. When Mo Ran came back to his senses, he and Chu Wanning had already arrived at the desolate outskirts of the Peach Blossom Spring.\"Master!My junior brother is still over there \u2014 \"Chu Wanning glanced at him, and seeing his anxious expression, he coldly snorted. \"Junior brother?The one surnamed Xia? \"\"Yes, yes, yes, he's still at Sky Tower, I have to save him \u2014\"Chu Wanning raised his hand, and interrupted him. \"I already cast a spell to send him to Xuanji, you don't have to worry.\"Hearing him say this, Mo Ran was relieved. He raised his black and white eyes and looked at Chu Wanning. \"Master, why are you \u2026 here?\"Chu Wanning was originally awakened by the noise outside, and seeing that the situation was critical, he swallowed a pill given to him by Tanlang, temporarily restoring his body.But at the moment, it was not convenient for him to explain to Mo Ran, so he coldly said, \"Why can't I be here?\" After saying this, he raised his fingertips and gathered a golden begonia.\"West Tower's curtain is full of reeds and thin flowers, a night of spring wind reaches Qiantang.\"Lowering his eyelashes, Chu Wanning gently blew at the budding begonia, and in an instant, the flower bloomed, overflowing with colorful light.Chu Wanning's slender white fingertips flicked, and whispered, \"Go investigate.\"The begonia flower immediately drifted away with the wind, and soon disappeared into the mountain forest.Mo Ran curiously asked, \"Master, what kind of magic is this?\"\"Flower Throwing Technique.\"\"What?\"\"Flower Throwing Technique.\"Chu Wanning's expression was solemn, and did not seem to be joking at all. \"It didn't have a name, but you asked me, so I gave it a name.\"Mo Ran, \"\u2026\"No matter how lazy this person was, he didn't have to be like this, right?\"The Lord has already told me about your matter.\"Chu Wanning looked in the direction where the begonia had drifted away, and his voice was as cold as a stream as usual. \"This should be the work of the same person as Jin Chenghu.In this Peach Blossom Spring, I'm afraid that the Exquisite Chess Game has already been set up. \"\"How is that possible?\" Mo Ran was shocked.The Exquisite Chess Game was a magic that he had reached the peak of in his previous life. After Eighteen's accident, Mo Ran himself had already tried to sense whether there were traces of this magic, because this forbidden magic was often accompanied by killing and bloodshed. Once it was activated, it would definitely kill, so as long as he carefully examined the inexplicable strong resentment, he would know whether or not someone had set up the Exquisite Chess Game.If that mysterious person really used this forbidden magic again, unless he did it to the extreme, there was no reason why Mo Ran would not be able to detect it.Seeing Chu Wanning's slightly suspicious gaze, Mo Ran hurriedly explained, \"What I'm saying is \u2026 the Peach Blossom Spring is filled with Half Immortals. How could it be so easy for someone to set up a forbidden technique here without knowing?\"Chu Wanning shook his head and said, \"At the bottom of the Jin Chenghu, that mysterious person controlled all the ancient spirit beasts. Although the ancient spirit beasts' combat strength cannot be compared to the divine beasts, they are not inferior to the Loose Immortals.Since he was able to control the Jin Chenghu at that time, it is very likely that he is using the same trick in the Peach Blossom Spring now. \"\"So \u2026\"\"Yes.\"Mo Ran raised his head and smiled shyly, revealing deep dimples. \"Master, what do you mean by not inferior?\"Chu Wanning, \"\u2026\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChu Wanning had never been the kind of master who was kind and seductive. Mo Ran was also not a five or six-year-old child. When he asked such a ridiculous question, Chu Wanning could not be bothered with him at all. He lowered his eyes and remained silent.He cast a gale spell on the begonia flower that he threw out, and quickly investigated the entire Peach Blossom Spring.Not long after, a golden talisman fell from the sky and landed in his hand.\"Ancestral Abyss?\"Ancestral Abyss was the place where angry owls would rush out every day, and cultivators would rush to pluck their feathers.The feathermen had said before that the bottom of the abyss was endless Scarlet True Fire. Other than those angry owls that had lived in the abyss since ancient times, no matter who fell in, they would be melted into nothingness.Chu Wanning cast a barrier on himself and Mo Ran to hide their tracks and prevent the feathermen from discovering them.The two of them arrived at the Ancestral Abyss. It was so deep that they could not see the bottom. It was emitting a strange red light. Thousands of strange birds were densely packed on the cliffs. At this time, these birds were all in deep sleep with their heads buried in their wings. From afar, they looked like countless densely packed dots.According to Chu Wanning, if the Exquisite Chess Game was set in the abyss, then what the feathermen said about the raging fire and how they would be burned into nothingness after falling in, should all be made up.\"But how can we be sure that the fire below won't burn people to death?\" Mo Ran stared at the hibernating light below and muttered, \"No matter how I look at it, it seems to be real.\"\"Throw something down first.\"\"Then I'll go hunt a rabbit.\"\"No need.\"Chu Wanning stood up and flew. As his white clothes fluttered, he was already far away in the peach forest. Not long after, he floated back to his original spot like a celestial being from the nine heavens. There was an additional peach blossom in his hand.Mo Ran understood. The peach blossom was naturally more delicate than the rabbit. If this peach blossom could withstand the so-called \"raging fire\", there would be no danger for living people to enter.Chu Wanning stroked the peach branch with his fingertips and silently chanted an incantation. The Luminous Peach was instantly enveloped by a layer of gentle blue light. He pointed at the abyss and whispered, \"Go.\"The peach blossoms slowly fell. One foot, two feet, ten feet, a hundred feet.Hua Zhi's shadow had long disappeared, but Chu Wanning's spell allowed him to sense the situation of Hua Zhi. He closed his eyes, and after a while, his eyelashes fluttered as he opened his eyes again.\"The peach blossoms are unharmed.Since Chu Wanning was so certain, there was nothing more to say. Mo Ran immediately flew with him to the Ancestral Abyss. Both of them had decent movement techniques, and they smoothly made their way to the bottom.When he saw the scene at the bottom of the abyss, even though he was mentally prepared, Mo Ran still felt a chill.He now knew what the red light in the abyss was.He saw that inside the abyss, there were several thousand wooden frames, and on each frame hung a featherman. Those feathermen were completely naked, and their beautiful bodies were dripping with blood.Each of them had a Ling Chi fruit in their mouth that was emitting a dazzling red light.Several thousand red lights gathered together. Looking from above, it was easy to believe that this was the Scarlet True Fire at the bottom of the abyss.Chu Wanning's expression was very ugly. He was knowledgeable, so he naturally knew that this red fruit was a forbidden fruit in the cultivation world. Putting it in the mouth of a person who was about to die could prolong their last breath for three hundred and sixty-five days.In other words, a person who could be released in an instant would have to experience an extremely long death. What was originally a sudden heart stop in the blink of an eye would become an endless torture. It was called the Death of a Thousand Cuts.Mo Ran stared at the layers of living dead feathermen and muttered, \"\u2026 Soul Locking Array.\"Using living things as human pillars to trap resentment, even if there were thousands of dead souls trapped in the exquisite chess game, not a single bit of their aura would leak out!It was no wonder that he couldn't detect a single trace of resentment from the exquisite chess game's forbidden technique.Mo Ran couldn't help but shiver. He was thinking, was the fake Gouchen at Jin Chengchi the same person as the mastermind behind the peach blossom spring?From Jin Chengchi's experience, the fake Gouchen was only able to use the exquisite chess game to control the spirits under the water, so he should have only learned a little. However, this time, the fake feathermen outside the peach blossom spring were no different from the real body, other than being stupid and not having high emotional intelligence. They could even use featherman spells, and the level of this forbidden technique could be considered to be above average. Could it be that the fake Gouchen had improved so quickly?Chu Wanning came to the center of the soul locking array, where there was a stone pillar made of crystal.There was also a featherman tied to the stone pillar, but this featherman was already dead. The Death Slicing Fruit in her mouth had already withered, and her body had also started to rot.However, her previous identity could be seen from the bright yellow phoenix robe on her body and the star-shaped curse mark in between her eyebrows.\"This is \u2026\"Mo Ran said in shock, \"This is a real featherman immortal!\"\"That's right.\"Chu Wanning looked at the inexhaustible human pillar formation and opened her thin lips. \"There are at least eight hundred, if not a thousand, feathermen captured here to be used in the soul-locking formation. If the featherman exalted immortals were still alive, how could they tolerate such a deep grudge?Moreover, when I fought with the immortal outside just now, I felt that she was weaker than the ghost master of Colorful Butterfly Town.If I didn't guess wrongly \u2026 I'm afraid that the feathermen of the peach blossom spring have already been exterminated, and the ones outside are all walking corpses controlled by the exquisite chess game. \"\"!\" As expected!Chu Wanning had the same thoughts as him!Mo Ran was shocked and wanted to turn around and go back.Chu Wanning waved his sleeves and stopped him.\"Where are you going?\"\"I'm going to tell uncle and the rest about this. If that's the case, then it's too dangerous.\"\"Don't act rashly.\" Chu Wanning shook his head. \"Now, they're in the dark, and I'm in the light.There are many cultivators in the peach blossom spring, and we don't know who's behind this. Acting rashly will only make the situation worse. \"\"Hehe.Long time no see, Grandmaster Chu is still so cautious. \"A light laugh with a hint of playfulness came from mid-air, but it exploded in the ancestral abyss like thunder.The two of them looked up, and saw a featherman child swinging his legs and sitting on a tree branch that extended out from the cliff.Seeing them turn around, the dead child tilted his head and rolled his eyes a few times. A bright smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.Mo Ran said in shock, \"The exquisite chess game!\"Chu Wanning cursed and said gloomily, \"Another white chess piece.\"\"Hehehe, that's right, it's just a white chess piece.\" The featherman child rubbed his hands and said, \"Otherwise, do you think I'll guard this place with my real body?I'm not stupid. \"Mo Ran said, \"You're that fake North Star Jin Chenghu!You lunatic, what are you trying to do? \"\"Hehe, who do you think you are? You're just a small Foundation Building cultivator, and you think you're qualified to question me?Get your master to ask him. \"\"You \u2014!\"Chu Wanning waved his sleeves and stretched out his slender fingers to press down on Mo Ran, who was so angry that smoke was coming out of his head.He raised his eyes and asked coldly, \"What exactly is your plan?\"The featherman swung his legs. He was clearly a dead person, but because he was controlled by a forbidden technique, he kept doing all kinds of tricks like a marionette.\"I'm the one who planned it. It's not a big deal.\"Chu Wanning's voice was even colder. \"Then why do you want to take my disciple's life time and time again?\"\"Although it's not a big deal, it just so happens that I need your disciple's spirit core to complete it.\" The child said with a smile, \"It's all because his spirit core is so good.It's even better than yours, Grandmaster.When I saw Jin Chenghu, I knew that he had the essence of the wood spirit. If that wasn't the case, I'm afraid I'd be more interested in you, Grandmaster. \"His words were greasy, and with such a tender voice and an adult tone, Mo Ran couldn't help but feel disgusted. He said angrily, \"If I'm so unlucky to be caught by you, I'll f * cking detonate my spirit core immediately. Don't even think about touching me!\"\"I don't want to touch you.\" The child still had that infuriating sweet tone. \"I had no choice but to chase after you.All men in the world love beauties. Your master is better looking than you, so I'm more willing to touch him. \"\"You!!!\"Mo Ran was about to explode. \"You're so ugly that you don't even dare to show your face. You use white chess pieces as puppets all day long. You think you're worthy of touching my master?\"But the child rolled his eyes at him, as if he couldn't be bothered to pay attention to him. He turned his head and stared at Chu Wanning.\"Grandmaster Chu, when we were in Jin Chenghu, I advised you not to pursue this matter further.But you didn't listen, and it made my heart ache. \"\"Since I already know about this matter, even if you don't do anything to Mo Ran, I'll still investigate to the end. I won't let it go.\"\"Pfft, I knew you'd say that.\" The child was silent for a while, then laughed. \"Why are you Great Grandmasters so stubborn?\u2026 Fine, since Grandmaster Chu doesn't listen to my advice, then we'll wait and see. I actually want to see if your Heaven's Inquisition is more powerful, or if my forbidden technique is more powerful. \"Chu Wanning's sword-like eyebrows rose in anger. He said gloomily, \"Do you really want to kill so many innocent people?\"\"Everyone in the world is like Huainan.\"\"What do you mean?\"\"Sour.\"The child giggled. \"It's so sour. These dead people are all so sour. I hate them. I want to crush them and trample them all.\"Mo Ran was speechless.Chu Wanning's voice was full of murderous intent. \"You're really incurable.\"\"Grandmaster thinks that I'm incurable, but I also think that Grandmaster can't be cured.Our morals are different, so why are we entangled in this? \"The child shook his head and said, \"Grandmaster, just think of it as playing a game of chess with me. You won the game in Jin Chenghu. In the game in Peach Blossom Spring, since Grandmaster has found the Ancestral Abyss and seen me, the white chess piece, I'm also at my wit's end. I can't get the little disciple beside you, so naturally, you win.\"He paused, and his eyes suddenly narrowed. He was smiling, but more blood was squeezed out.\"However, you have to protect him well. I want to see if Grandmaster can protect him for a while, but can you protect him for a lifetime?\"\"\u2026\"\"As for the secret under the Ancestral Abyss, it's best that the two of you don't leak it.\" As the child spoke, a golden-red wing appeared at his fingertips.Mo Ran was stunned. \"This is the golden feather used as currency in Peach Blossom Spring?\"\"That's right.\"He smiled and said, \"This golden feather has been scattered everywhere in Peach Blossom Spring. If the two of you keep the secret and leave on your own, you will be safe in Peach Blossom Spring.Everyone in the paradise will be safe and sound. However, if the two of you are not obedient and want to announce my whereabouts to the public, these feathers have the resentment of the feathermen attached to them. Although they cannot take the lives of those cultivators, they can still disperse a large part of their cultivation base. \"Mo Ran said angrily, \"You planned this from the beginning?!\"\"Otherwise?\" The child said in surprise, \"Do you think that everyone is as stupid and violent as you?\"Mo Ran was speechless.He was really, really pissed off!!He admitted that he didn't know how to beat around the bush, and he didn't know how to calculate when to advance and when to retreat. However, when this little bastard said it so openly, he really wanted to summon a ghost and shout at this bastard's face. He wanted to show him what it meant to be stupid and violent.\"Grandmaster Chu, you should know very well whether to say it or not.Even if they know the truth, their cultivation will be greatly damaged. I'm afraid that they won't be grateful to Grandmaster Chu for eliminating the evil. \"Chu Wanning said coldly, \"You also eavesdropped just now. I didn't plan to disturb them now.\"\"Now?Haha, it seems that Grandmaster planned to say it later. However, it's useless to say it later. \"The child laughed and said, \"Once these cultivators leave, Peach Blossom Spring will be completely destroyed by me, just like Jin Chenghu.At that time, there will be no evidence. Let's see who will believe you. \"Chu Wanning's gaze was cold. \"With your actions, how can you say that Mo Ran is stupid and violent?\"The child didn't care about Chu Wanning's cold mockery. He stood up and spun around a few times. Flames suddenly appeared under his feet, slowly burning away his skin, flesh, bones, and blood.\"Wait until you catch me, then you can say that to me.Grandmaster Chu, I respect you as a gentleman. Today, I'll give you one last warning. Don't interfere. If you don't listen, we \u2026 will meet again in the end \u2026 \"With a boom, the flames suddenly soared into the sky and exploded.The featherman child who had been used as a puppet was completely burned away. A sparkling white chess piece fell from the sky and rolled on the ground twice before stopping.There was dead silence for a long time.\"\u2026\" Mo Ran knew that the mysterious person behind the scenes wasn't lying. However, he was still unwilling to give up. He asked, \"Master, are we really going to leave just like that?Do you have any other ideas? \"\"It's better to be safe than sorry. Let's leave the Peach Blossom Spring first.\"Chu Wanning's expression wasn't good either. He said gloomily, \"Since that person spent so much effort to set up the Soul Locking Formation to prevent others from finding out that he was controlling the Exquisite Chess Game, it means that he doesn't want to make this matter known to everyone for the time being.As for the High Lord, I'll send him a message and ask him to bring Xue Meng and Shi Mei away as soon as possible. Don't alert the enemy.As for you \u2026 \"Chu Wanning paused for a moment before continuing, \"The two incidents involving Jin Chenghu and the Peach Blossom Spring were all directed at you.This time, he planned to frame you in hopes of making you isolated and helpless.You don't have to worry about this matter. The High Lord is the leader of a sect. It's best for him to step in and mediate. \"\"Then what can I do?\" Mo Ran said, \"I can't push everything to others and do nothing.\"\"What are you trying to do now?That mysterious person's goal is very clear. After Jin Chengchi's Divine Wood fell, he has been looking for an Essence Spiritual Body to replace it.You're the Wood Essence Spiritual Body, so you're the most suitable. However, if he can't get you, he'll settle for the next best thing and look for other replacements. \"Chu Wanning paused for a moment before saying, \"If he finds you, I'm afraid there'll be another bloody storm. We have to stop him.\"\"That's true. However, Master, it's not that easy to find an Essence Spiritual Body. Even if he wants to find a replacement, he must \u2026\"Mo Ran suddenly paused. He raised his head and stared at Chu Wanning with his soft, black eyes. After a while, he said, \"If that little bastard wants to find out who has an Essence Spiritual Body, he has to go to every sect to investigate. However, cultivators won't release their Spiritual Roots for no reason. They'll only use their Spiritual Roots to sense when they're choosing weapons or refining stones.Therefore, the simplest way to test an Essence Spiritual Body is to sell weapons and spirit stones.We only need to observe the weapon markets in front of the various mountains and we'll be able to find traces of that bastard. \"After saying this, he saw Chu Wanning staring at him thoughtfully. He couldn't help but feel guilty.\"Uh \u2026 I guessed.\"\"You guessed correctly.\"Chu Wanning said slowly. After a while, he suddenly felt that he knew more things. He narrowed his eyes and asked, \"Mo Ran.Are you hiding something from me? \"\"What, what could I hide from Master?\"Although he said this, Mo Ran felt the hair on his back stand up. He felt that Chu Wanning's glass-like eyes seemed to be locking the real soul inside his reborn body.Fortunately, Chu Wanning was silent for a moment and didn't say anything else.He faintly lowered his eyes and said in a low voice, \"From today onwards, you and I will secretly investigate each sect.We won't return to the Peak of Life and Death for the time being. \"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter Chu Wanning and Mo Ran left the Peach Blossom Spring, they went around to find out when the big and small sects' markets would open. After traveling for a few days, they settled down in an inn in a small town that night.After leaving the Peach Blossom Spring, they finally had a chance to rest. Mo Ran had already returned to his room. Chu Wanning sat in front of the table and lit the candle. Under the warm yellow light, he carefully examined the porcelain bottle in his hand.Inside the white jade bottle, there were more than thirty dazzling golden pills.Fortunately, when Xuanji came, he gave this bottle of medicine to him. Otherwise, he really wouldn't know how to interact with Mo Ran.\"This is Tanlang's new medicine. There are about thirty pills.\"At that time in the Peach Blossom Spring cave, Xuanji said to Chu Wanning, \"He looked through the ancient records and changed some of the ingredients.One pill can support your recovery for seven days. This bottle of medicine should last you a long time. Take it. \"\"Thank Tanlang for me.\"\"No need to thank me.\"Xuanji waved his hand and smiled, \"I saw Tanlang's serious face. He must be very curious about your illness.Oh right, he told me to remind you that the medicinal properties of this pill are not stable. Don't be too happy or sad, or it will lose its effect. Remember this. \"Chu Wanning was lost in thought about Xuanji's words. Suddenly, he heard a knock on the door of the inn. He immediately put away the porcelain bottle and extinguished the incense burning in the celadon stove. Only then did he slowly say, \"Come in.\"Mo Ran had just finished bathing. He put on a thin silk bathrobe and wiped his black jade-like hair as he walked into Chu Wanning's room.\"\u2026\" Chu Wanning coughed. Fortunately, his face was still indifferent. \"What's wrong?\"\"My room is not good. I don't like it.Master, can I make do with sleeping on the floor here tonight? \"Seeing that Mo Ran's words were vague, Chu Wanning wasn't stupid and naturally felt that something was wrong. He asked, \"What's there not to like?\"\"In \u2026 in any case, it's \u2026 it's just not good.\" As he spoke, he secretly glanced at Chu Wanning and muttered, \"The sound insulation is too bad.\"Chu Wanning was used to having a noble temperament. He frowned and actually didn't understand what Mo Ran was referring to.He put on his outer robe and walked barefoot to Mo Ran's room. Mo Ran couldn't stop him and could only follow behind him.\"Although it's a little shabby, it's not to the extent that I can't sleep peacefully.\"Chu Wan-ning stood in the room and looked around. She scolded, \"Why are you so delicate?\"Before he finished speaking, he suddenly heard a violent crash from the other side of the wall. It seemed that something had fallen heavily to the ground.Mo Ran really didn't have the face to listen. Taking advantage of the situation before it got worse, he stepped forward and grabbed Chu Wanning's sleeve. \"Shizun, let's go quickly.\"Chu Wanning frowned. \"What's wrong with you?Is there something wrong? \"Mo Ran opened his mouth, but before he could organize his words, he heard a burst of laughter from the other side of the wall. \"Young Master Chang is so annoying. You only know how to bully others. Ah, don't, don't be like this \u2026 ah!\"\"Hehe, darling, the peony on your chest is so beautiful. Let me smell it to see if it's fragrant.\"The wall was really thin. Even the rustling of clothes on the other side could be heard clearly.A man's rough breathing and a woman's sweet moans mixed together. It was simply unbearable to the ear.At first, Chu Wanning didn't understand. After a while, he reacted. A pair of beautiful eyes suddenly widened. Then his face quickly turned from white to red, from red to green. Finally, with an ashen face, he scolded, \"Shameless!\" He angrily swung his sleeve and left.\"Pfft.\"Mo Ran couldn't hold back and laughed softly behind him.Fortunately, Chu Wanning was so embarrassed that he even walked with the same hand and foot. He didn't hear Mo Ran's ridicule.When he returned to his room, he silently drank a cup of tea. Only then could he force himself to be calm. He nodded to Mo Ran. \"Such filthy words are really bad for cultivation. Stay here with me tonight.\"\"Oh.\"In fact, when he suddenly saw Chu Wanning appear in the Peach Blossom Spring, and that he didn't suspect him at all and even protected him in every possible way, Mo Ran was pleasantly surprised. Now that he had settled down, he couldn't help but be in a good mood. Under the candlelight, his master's usually cold face seemed much cuter.Mo Ran curved his eyes and sat cross-legged on the ground. He supported his chin and looked up at Chu Wanning.\"\u2026 What are you looking at?\"\"I haven't seen Master in a long time.I want to see more. \"The youth's voice carried a hint of a smile. His gaze was also warm and bright.Upon closer inspection, Chu Wanning \u2026 really did look like Junior Martial Brother Xia.Chu Wanning glared at him. \"If you have time to look at me, why don't you go dry your hair? How are you going to sleep when it's so wet?\"\"I left my towel next door.\" Mo Ran smiled. \"Can Master help me?\"\"\u2026 \u2026\"Xue Meng had been injured once before and couldn't lift his arm for many days. During that time, when he washed his hair, it was his master who helped him dry it. Master always dried his hair very quickly because he could control his spiritual power very well. He quickly dried the towel in his hand.Chu Wanning lowered his eyes and looked at Mo Ran, whose hands and feet were all right. He coldly snorted. \"If you're not sick or in pain, why should I help you?\"But he still waved his hand to let him come over.At night, the candlelight was warm, illuminating Mo Ran's handsome young face.Mo Ran sat on the bed. It had been nearly a year since his rebirth. It was the time when a youth was growing. In these past few months, he had unknowingly grown a lot taller. At this time, he was actually about the same height as Chu Wanning.At this height, it was not convenient for Chu Wanning to dry his hair, so Mo Ran put his hands behind him and lowered his body. Chu Wanning stood by the bed and rubbed his long hair impatiently.Mo Ran yawned contentedly and closed his eyes to enjoy this rare peace.Occasionally, there would be two or three frog croaks outside the window.\"Master.\"\"Yes.\"\"Did you know that in the feathermen's illusion, I returned to Lin 'an two hundred years ago and saw a person called Chu Xun?\"His wiping did not stop at all. \"How would I know?\"Mo Ran rubbed his nose and laughed. \"He looks a lot like you.\"\"\u2026 \u2026 There are many people who look alike in the world. What's so strange about that?\"\"No.\"Mo Ran said seriously. \"He's more or less made from the same mold as you. Master, do you think he's your ancestor?\"Chu Wanning said lightly, \"It's possible.However, this was two hundred years ago. Who can say for sure? \"\"He has a son.\"Mo Ran said to himself. \"He looks a lot like Junior Martial Brother Xia. I think this is too much of a coincidence. Master, do you think Junior Martial Brother Xia is your long-lost relative?\"\"I don't have any relatives.\"\"I already said you're long-lost \u2026 \u2026\" Mo Ran muttered. He was very close to Chu Wanning and could smell the faint fragrance of begonia flowers that made people feel at ease.It smelled really good. Whether it was in his previous life or this life, Chu Wanning's scent always seemed to have a calming effect on his mind. In his previous life, he returned from a bloody battle. Only by burying his face in his master's neck could he obtain that moment of respite.Whether he was willing to admit it or not, he was already addicted to Chu Wanning's scent. He could not quit even if he wanted to.He closed his eyes. In this familiar silence, he gradually let go of his consciousness. He did not know what time it was.In his previous life, in the empty Shaman Mountain Hall, he killed someone and came back drenched in the rain. He was clearly a sinful person, but instead he was soaking wet like a homeless dog.At that time, he sat down and hugged Chu Wanning's waist. He buried his face in the other's stomach and let Chu Wanning stroke his hair over and over again. Only in this way could he barely suppress his crazy heart.Those old dreams were clearly separated from the past. The past was as vast as the sea.But when he closed his eyes, it seemed as if it was only yesterday.Chu Wanning saw that the person who had been talking about him was not talking. He lowered his eyes and saw a calm face in the dim candlelight.Although there was still a bit of youthfulness between his eyebrows, and he had not shed his childishness, his facial features had already matured. He could see that kind of handsome face.It was like the bones of a flower vaguely visible amidst the clouds. It carried the freshness and vitality of a young person.Chu Wanning's hand paused slightly, and his heart seemed to beat a little faster.For some reason, he called out softly, \"Mo Ran.\"\"Mm \u2026 \u2026\"Mo Ran, who was in a daze, responded vaguely. He seemed to be a little tired. He moved his face closer and leaned on Chu Wanning's waist like he did in his previous life.Chu Wanning, \"\u2026 \u2026\"Thump.Thump.Thump.The dense heartbeat was like a war drum on the battlefield. It shook him until he was a little dizzy.Chu Wanning pursed his lips. He did not know what to do. He could only continue to wipe Mo Ran's hair, evaporating the last bit of water.After a long time, he threw away the towel and smoothed the strands of hair in front of Mo Ran's forehead. He said in a low voice, \"Alright.Go to sleep. \"Mo Ran opened his eyes. His dark purple eyes were dazed for a moment, and then gradually became clear.He finally came back to his senses. He remembered that he had leaned against Chu Wan-ning's waist out of habit, and Chu Wan-ning hadn't pushed him away. He couldn't help but be shocked. He stared blankly with his eyes wide open like a silly dog.Chu Wanning was originally a little uncomfortable, but seeing him like this, he could not help but laugh.Mo Ran saw that he was actually laughing. Although it was a faint smile, it was definitely a smile. He could not help but open his eyes even wider. He sat up straight. With his slightly messy hair, he suddenly said very seriously, \"Shizun, there's a fragrance on your body. It smells very good.\"\"\u2026 \u2026\"After a pause, he suddenly frowned, as if he was trying hard to recall something. Then he remembered something. His expression was a little stunned. He muttered, \"How strange. Xia Si Ni \u2026 \u2026 why does he also have this smell?\"Chu Wanning's expression suddenly changed.Before Mo Ran could react, he threw the towel on Mo Ran's head and directly threw him off the bed. He said coldly, \"I'm tired. Get down and sleep.\"Mo Ran was unexpectedly thrown on his back. He lay on the floor in a daze for a long time. Then he sat up and rubbed his nose. He was not angry and obediently got up to sleep on the floor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThat night, Chu Wanning and Mo Ran shared a room. Mo Ran was heartless and quickly fell asleep on the ground. Chu Wanning, on the other hand, could not help but feel his mind drifting. After tossing and turning for a long time, he finally managed to fall asleep.Closing his eyes, he seemed to hear the whistling of wind blowing snow in his ears.Chu Wanning opened his eyes and found himself kneeling in the snow.\u2026 A dream?But why did it feel so real? It was as if he had experienced it himself at some point in time.It was the middle of winter. The sky was gray and the clouds were heavy. The cold wind flowed from the distant mountains all the way to the heart of the earth.The snow had accumulated about a foot, enough to reach his ankles. Even though he was wearing a coat, it still could not withstand the cold.Chu Wanning lowered his head to look at the sky-blue fur coat. It was embroidered with intricate curly grass patterns using silver silk thread. He felt that this coat was somewhat familiar, but this familiarity disappeared in an instant. Very soon, he could not capture it.\"\u2026\"He did not understand why he had such a torturous dream. Chu Wanning prepared to stand up, but his body did not seem to belong to him. He continued to kneel on the ground without moving an inch. Even when the snow fell on his shoulders and ice beads condensed on his eyelashes, he still had no intention of getting up.\"Grandmaster Chu, the sun is dark. Her Majesty will not see you tonight. Let's go back.\"An old, trembling voice sounded from behind.In the dream, he did not turn around. Footsteps sounded behind him. Someone stepped on the snow with a crunching sound and held an umbrella on his left and right.Chu Wanning heard himself say, \"Thank you, Liu Gong.You are old. Go back to the waterside pavilion and rest. I can still hold on. \"\"Grandmaster \u2026\"The old voice still wanted to say something, but Chu Wanning said, \"Let's go back.\"The weak voice sighed and dragged his heavy steps. He walked a few steps and turned back to hold the umbrella for Chu Wanning.\"This old servant will accompany the Grandmaster.\"Chu Wanning felt himself close his eyes in the dream and did not speak.He couldn't help but find it increasingly strange. This was truly an extremely preposterous dream.Both he and the old man were having a conversation that no one could understand.\"Your Majesty\" and \"Mr. Liu\" were not the world of Cultivators that he was familiar with. Instead, they seemed to be in a palace.He tried to see through the body, to see the scene of the dream through his lowered eyelids.This place seemed to be the pinnacle of life and death, but there was something different about it.The houses were mostly the same as before, but many extravagant little items had been added.The cloistered corridors around the courtyard were draped with snow green curtains embroidered with stars, and tied to them were octagonal incense bells containing auspicious beasts. When the wind blew, the bells jingled, as if they came from the Primordial Chaos.He knelt facing the main hall. In front of the hall stood a row of Imperial Bodyguards. He had never seen them before, so he didn't know which sect they were from.The sky gradually darkened. A line of palace maids walked out of the side door in a line. Their white hands were slender, and they lit two bronze lamps on the left and right side of the hall. The lampstand was as tall as a person and had nine floors. Each floor had forty-nine thin copper begonia. The begonia's core was brightly lit, and the candlelight scattered one after another, like the stars in the Milky Way in the sky, shining brilliantly in front of the hall.After lighting the lamps, the head palace maid glanced at Chu Wanning and said with a strange sneer, \"It's so cold at night. Who are you trying to show your bitterness to?His Majesty and the Empress are enjoying themselves. Even if you kneel until the end of time, no one will sympathize with you. \"How presumptuous!Chu Wanning had lived for so long, and no one dared to speak to him like this. He couldn't help but become angry. When he opened his mouth, his voice was his own, but he couldn't help but say something else.\"I didn't come here to disturb his mood. I actually have something important to discuss. Please pass the message.\"\"Who do you think you are? Why should I pass the message for you?\" The head palace maid said with disdain. \"His Majesty and the Empress are in a good mood. Who dares to disturb them?If you want to see His Majesty, then keep kneeling. When His Majesty gets up tomorrow, maybe he'll have the heart to look at you. Humph. \"The old servant behind Chu Wanning couldn't listen anymore. He said with a trembling voice, \"I know your Empress is favored, but don't you see who you're talking to?Don't you have some virtue in your mouth? \"\"Who am I talking to?At the peak of life and death, who doesn't know that His Majesty hates him the most?I'm talking to him. What respect do I need?You old thing, you have the guts to lecture me! \"The head palace maid glared at him and said angrily,\" Someone come! \"\"What do you want to do?\" The old servant couldn't help but take two steps forward and stand in front of Chu Wanning.The palace maid glared at him and said in a delicate voice, \"Extinguish the two basins of charcoal outside.\"\"Yes!\"Someone immediately came over and extinguished the charcoal basins in the courtyard.Chu Wanning thought that although this palace maid's mouth was stubborn, she wasn't stupid.The sky was cold and hard, so she didn't need to directly fight with the other party.As long as the two basins of charcoal were extinguished, the courtyard would become like an ice cave. No matter how strong the body was, it wouldn't be able to withstand half a night.The night grew deeper, but the palace was still warm. The sounds of music and dancing were endless.Chu Wanning was still kneeling. His legs and feet were numb.\"Grandmaster \u2026 go back \u2026\"The old servant's voice sounded like he was about to cry.\"Go back. Your health is important. You know His Majesty. If you freeze, he won't send a doctor to take a look. You have to take care of yourself.\"Chu Wanning said softly, \"I'm just a broken body. It's not worth mentioning.If I can stop him from attacking the Kunlun Treading Snow Palace, I won't regret even if I die. \"\"Grandmaster!You, why do you have to \u2026 \"Chu Wanning was extremely weak in the dream. He coughed a few times, but his eyes were still clear. \"It's my fault that he ended up like this.I \u2026 cough, cough. \"Before he could finish, he started coughing violently. Chu Wanning covered his mouth with his sleeve. There was a metallic taste in his throat. When he put down his sleeve, he saw that his hand was covered in blood. It was a glaring sight.\"Grandmaster Chu!\"\"I \u2026\"Chu Wanning still wanted to say something, but his vision turned black. He couldn't hold on anymore and fell into the snow.There was endless chaos in his ears. It was like the sudden turmoil of war, but it was also like the sea behind layers of curtains. He couldn't hear the noise around him.He could only vaguely hear the old servant shouting in panic. A few words drifted into his ears.\"Your Majesty!Your Majesty \u2026 I beg you \u2026 \"\"Grandmaster Chu, Grandmaster Chu is dying. I beg you to see him. I'm willing to die \u2026\"The surroundings gradually became chaotic. There were many footsteps, and the lights were brightly lit.The sound of drums and the woman's sweet singing suddenly stopped. It seemed that the door of the palace was wide open. A strong fragrance wrapped in the warmth of the room rushed out.Chu Wanning felt that someone had picked him up and brought him into the warm palace.A large hand touched his forehead, but it only probed for a moment before it was abruptly pulled back as if it had been stabbed.Then, a familiar low male voice was screaming dangerously.\"Why didn't you report to me?\"No one answered.The man suddenly flew into a rage. With a bang, he seemed to have thrown a pile of heavy objects. He roared angrily, accumulating the power of thunder.\"Have you all rebelled?He is the master of the Red Lotus Pavilion, and he is my master!He is kneeling here, but none of you came to report to me?Why didn't you report to me?! \"With a thump, someone knelt down, trembling. It was the head palace maid who had been flaunting her power earlier.\"This servant has committed a capital crime. This servant saw that His Majesty and the Empress were in a good mood, so this servant didn't dare to disturb \u2026\"The man paced back and forth a few times, but his anger only increased. His black robe with golden edges fluttered on the ground like black clouds. Finally, he stopped, his voice twisted to the extreme.\"His body is not good, and he is afraid of the cold.You didn't report to me, and made him wait in the snow. You also \u2026 you also extinguished the charcoal fire in the courtyard \u2026 \"His voice trembled because of his anger. In the end, he took a deep breath, and a sentence rumbled out of his throat.His voice was not loud, but the murderous intent in it made people feel cold.\"You want him to die.\"The palace maid was so scared that her face turned pale. She banged her head on the ground, and her forehead was bruised. Her lips trembled as she screamed, \"No!That's not it!How could this servant dare to have such thoughts!Your Majesty!Your Majesty has wronged me! \"\"Drag him down.He will be executed on the stage of good and evil. \"\"Your Majesty!Your Majesty \u2014 \"That sharp voice was like blood-red fingernails scratching the ear. The dream began to shake and disintegrate in the midst of her shrill screams. The surrounding scenes fell apart like snowflakes.\"I spent so much effort to bring him back from the gates of hell.Other than me, no one is allowed to hurt him, not even a finger \u2026 \"The hoarse voice was very cold, but because of this extreme coldness, it gave birth to a sinister madness.Chu Wanning felt that person come closer and stop in front of him.He pinched his chin with one hand.He opened his eyes vaguely, trying to see that person's appearance. In the dazzling light, he saw a blurry face. That person had dark and deep eyebrows, a straight nose, and eyes as black as ink. In the candlelight, there were faint traces of purple.\"\u2026 Mo Ran?\"\"Master!\"The voice suddenly became clear.Chu Wanning suddenly opened his eyes and saw that he was still lying in the room of the inn. The sky was still dark, and a single candle was trembling on the candlestick.Mo Ran sat by the bed, one hand on his forehead, the other on the bed. He was looking at him anxiously.\"How did I \u2026\"For a moment, he was in a daze. The dream just now was so real that he could not recover for a while.\"You had a nightmare. You kept shivering.\"Mo Ran pulled the thin blanket for him. \"I saw that you were very cold. I was afraid that you had a fever. Fortunately, you didn't.\"Chu Wanning made a sound and turned his head to look at the slightly open window.The sky outside was still heavy and dark, and the night was still deep.\"I had a dream. In the dream, it was snowing heavily.\"He muttered to himself, then fell silent.Chu Wanning sat up and buried his face in his hands. After a moment of silence, he sighed. \"I'm probably tired.\"\"I'll go make a bowl of ginger tea for Master.\" Mo Ran looked worriedly at his pale face. \"Master, your complexion is very bad.\"\"\u2026 \u2026\"Seeing that Chu Wanning did not say anything, Mo Ran sighed and did not think much of it. He habitually used his forehead to touch Chu Wanning's cold and sweaty forehead.\"If you don't say anything, I'll take it that you're willing.\"Chu Wanning was slightly surprised by this sudden intimacy. He subconsciously leaned back. \"\u2026 \u2026 En.\"Mo Ran was also confused from sleep. Just like in his previous life, he rubbed his hair. Only then did he put on a coat and ran downstairs to use the kitchen.After a while, he came up with a beech wood tray.Mo Ran was not a person with a heart of grass. Chu Wanning came to the Peach Blossom Spring to save him and protect him. No matter how much hatred he had for this person before, at this moment, he was grateful.On the tray, there was a pot of steaming ginger tea and a small jar filled with black sugar from the Tujia family.He remembered that Chu Wanning did not like to eat things that were choking, but he liked sweet things.In addition to the ginger tea, he also asked for a white steamed bun from the kitchen.The steamed bun was cut into thin slices, soaked in fresh milk, and fried in a pot of oil. A layer of icing was sprinkled on top. It was a simple but tasty snack.Chu Wanning held the ginger tea and slowly drank it. His face gradually regained color. His porcelain white fingertips picked up a piece of milk-flavored steamed bun. After looking at it for a while, he asked, \"What is this?\"\"I just made it casually. I haven't named it yet.\" Mo Ran scratched his head. \"Shizun, try it. It's sweet.\"Chu Wanning did not like fried food and hated greasy food. However, when he heard the word \"sweet\", he hesitated for a moment. He took a piece of steamed bun and took a bite.\"Oh \u2026 \u2026\"\"Is it good?\" Mo Ran asked tentatively.Chu Wanning looked at him and did not say anything. He then took another piece and slowly ate it with the ginger tea.The pot of tea and the plate of snacks were quickly finished. The nightmare also disappeared in this warmth. Chu Wanning yawned and lay back on the bed. \"Go to sleep.\"\"Wait a minute.\" Mo Ran suddenly raised his hand and wiped the corner of Chu Wanning's mouth with his finger. \"Snack crumbs.\"\"\u2026 \u2026\"Looking at the young man in front of him smiling so openly, Chu Wanning could not help but feel his ears heat up. He turned his face and said, \"En.\" Then he ignored him.Mo Ran put away the bowls and plates and went downstairs to return them. When he came back up, he saw Chu Wanning sleeping facing the wall. He did not know if he was asleep or not.He went forward and gently put down the gauze curtain. Suddenly, he heard Chu Wanning say, \"It's cold at night. Don't sleep on the floor.\"\"Then \u2026 \u2026\"Chu Wanning's long eyes drooped. He really wanted him to stay with him, but he could not say \"Sleep next to me.\" After hesitating for a long time, the tips of his ears became hotter.He felt sorry for him and did not want him to sleep on the floor. He liked him and did not want him to leave.But he was so thin-skinned. He knew that even if he asked, the other party would definitely reject him. At that time, he would lose all his face. Just thinking about it made him feel sad.It was better to be Xia Si Ni. As a child, he could be more willful.\u2014 \u2014 But Mo Ran treated him well today. He even remembered that when he drank ginger tea, he liked to put black sugar. Could he think that in fact, Mo Ran also cared about him more or less \u2026 \u2026Such thoughts made Chu Wanning feel a little hot in his heart. He blurted out in a daze.\"Come up and sleep.\"\"Then I'll go and see if it's quiet next door. If it's quiet, I'll go back to my room.\"They said this sentence almost at the same time. After Mo Ran finished speaking, he realized what Chu Wanning said and opened his eyes slightly.\"That's great.\"Chu Wanning agreed almost without hesitation, as if she was in a hurry to cover up what she had said earlier.\"Go back.\"\"Shizun, you \u2026 \u2026\"\"I'm tired. You can go.\"\"\u2026 Well, Shizun, rest early.\"The young man left. The door opened and closed with a creak.Chu Wanning opened his eyes in the dark night. His heart was beating fast and his palms were sweaty. He could not help but feel embarrassed for his loss of self-control just now.Sure enough, after being alone for a long time, a little care from others would make him think that it was rare warmth.Just like a fool.He turned over in annoyance and buried his face in the pillow, sinking into deep self-loathing.He knew that the person Mo Ran liked was Shi Mingjing. They were just a cold and polite master and disciple, but \u2026 \u2026The person in his dream seemed to appear clearly in front of him.The same facial features, but compared to the current Mo Ran, he seemed to be older.When he looked at him, his expression was perverse and paranoid. His eyes were so deep that he could not see clearly.With a creak, the door opened again.Chu Wanning froze in an instant. His back was tense, like a bow that had been pulled to the extreme.A person walked to the bed and remained silent for about a foot. He felt that person sit down on the side of the bed. When he came back, there was a unique smell of clothes.\"Shizun, are you asleep?\"No one responded to him.Mo Ran continued to speak. His voice was very calm, as if he was talking about a family matter. \"There's still a ruckus next door.\"He chuckled softly and leaned over to support the side of his face. He lay down beside Chu Wan Ning and glanced at the person's back that had clearly stiffened.\"Shizun just told me to sleep. Does it still count?\"\"\u2026 \u2026\"\"Shizun always doesn't like to respond to people.If you don't say anything, I'll take it that Shizun is willing again. \"\"\u2026 \u2026 Hmph.\"Hearing that person's cold snort from the depths of the bed, Mo Ran curved his eyes. His dark purple eyes were full of laughter.If spoiling Shi Mei was a habit of his, then teasing his teacher was a game that he would never get tired of.Mo Ran had never had a clear definition of his feelings for Chu Wanning. However, whenever he saw this person, his heart would itch and he would want to bare his canine teeth and bite him, making him cry or laugh uncontrollably \u2014 although most of the time, this was just Mo Ran's wishful thinking.However, as long as there was even the slightest change in emotion on that icy face, it was because of him. Mo Ran would feel exceptionally excited.\"Master.\"\"Yes.\"\"Nothing, I was just calling you.\"\"\u2026\"\"Master.\"\"If you have something to say, say it. If not, scram.\"\"Hahaha.\"Mo Ran laughed. He suddenly thought of something and asked half-jokingly, half-seriously, \"I was just thinking about it. I feel that Junior Martial Brother Xia and Shizun are too similar. Shizun, is he your son?\"\"\u2026\"Chu Wanning's mood had probably fluctuated too much in one night. At this time, he was sulking.Suddenly hearing Mo Ran teasing him like this, he couldn't help but feel a little angry.\"Pfft, I was just teasing Shizun. Shizun, you don't have to \u2014\"\"That's right.\" Chu Wanning coldly replied. \"He is my son.\"Mo Ran was still smiling. \"Oh, I knew it. So it's your son \u2014 Wait!Son??! \"As if struck by lightning, Mo Ran suddenly opened his eyes wide and his mouth wide in disbelief.\"Son, son, son, son?\"\"Yes.\"Chu Wanning simply turned his body and looked at Mo Ran seriously. His face was serious and fierce, and didn't look fake at all.Tonight, he had done too many wrong things. He was afraid that it would be suspicious.Since Mo Ran wanted to make a joke, he might as well take advantage of the chaos to play a trick. Anyway, he couldn't let Mo Ran know that he liked him.Thinking of this, Chu Wanning coldly picked up his lost dignity and said coldly, \"Xia Si is my illegitimate son. Even he was kept in the dark about this matter. Now, heaven, earth, you, and I know. If a third person knows, see if I don't want your dog life.\"Mo Ran, \"\u2026\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIf he didn't know Chu Wanning like the back of his hand, Mo Ran felt that he would really believe him when he saw how serious Chu Wanning was when he spoke.Xia Sini was Chu Wanning's son?What a joke, did he really think he was stupid?However, it was not easy to lose face with Shizun, so in the following days, Mo Ran had to cooperate with Chu Wanning from time to time to show reactions like \"Oh my god\", \"So it is like this\", \"I didn't expect Shizun to be such a wanton man\", and so on.It had to be said that although he didn't know what Chu Wanning wanted to do, this experience was somewhat interesting.Mo Ran went to tease him every few days. In the morning, when they were eating in the teahouse, Mo Ran held his chin and opened his eyes wide, calling, \"Shizun, Shizun.\"Chu Wanning swallowed a mouthful of Yang Xian tea, raised his eyes and looked at him faintly, \"Yes?\"\"Why don't you recognize Shidi Xia?\"Chu Wanning said, \"It's not that I don't recognize him, it's just that the time hasn't come yet.\"\"Then, when will we be considered to be fated?\"\"It depends on his luck.\"Mo Ran looked at his unfathomable appearance and held back his laughter until his ribs hurt, but he still had to put on a sympathetic expression, \"Shidi Xia is really pitiful.\"Another example was when they were hurrying along, Mo Ran raised his hand and broke a willow tree. Along the way, he played with cats and dogs, and when he was bored, he called Chu Wanning.\"Shizun, Shizun.\"\"What's the matter?\"\"I want to ask you something secretly.\" Mo Ran said with a smile, \"Shizun \u2026 what kind of person is she?Is she beautiful? \"Chu Wanning choked, and then covered it with a light cough.\"Not bad.\"\"Oh?Is it only passable? \"Mo Ran said in surprise, \"I thought that the one who could catch Master's attention must be a beauty that could topple countries and cities.\"\"\u2026\"Mo Ran rubbed his brow and brought his black horse closer to Chu Wanning's white horse. He sneakily leaned over and asked, \"Does Shizun and Shiniang still keep in touch?\"\"\u2026 What kind of relationship?\"Chu Wanning glanced at him coldly. He touched his lips and said in a deep voice, \"Your Master's wife is already dead.\"He had killed his own wife with just a few words?Mo Ran almost choked on his saliva. \"D-dead?How did he die? \"Chu Wanning was expressionless. \"Difficult labor.\"\"\u2026\" Puhahahahahaha.If it wasn't for the circumstances, Mo Ran would have fallen off his horse and fallen to the ground laughing.Mo Ran naturally wouldn't let go of such an interesting topic so easily.The next day, she washed a bag of fresh and plump cherries and put them in a pouch for Chu Wanning to eat on the way. She tricked him into talking to her again.\"Shizun, may I know who Shiniang was? What was her name?\"Chu Wanning picked up a sweet cherry and ate it without batting an eyelid. He then said coldly, \"The dead are gone. What's the use of knowing her name?\"Mo Ran played along smoothly. \"Revered Master follows the path of filial piety. Even if Shiniang was a beauty, as a disciple, I should still remember her name. When the Winter Solstice is bright and clear, I have to pay my respects.\"Chu Wanning continued to eat his cherries. He said indifferently, \"No need.Your Master's wife is not such a vulgar person. She doesn't like the smell of incense. \"Mo Ran curled his lips and secretly rolled his eyes. He thought to himself, It's obviously you who can't come up with Shiniang's background. You actually have the face to say that Shiniang is otherworldly and doesn't eat the food of the common populace.But his face was still smiling. \"Shiniang is so otherworldly. She must be a cultivator, right?\"Chu Wanning paused. He picked up another cherry with his snow-white fingertips and slowly chewed it. He then said, \"That's right.\"Mo Ran blinked his eyes curiously. \"Which sect did Shiniang belong to?\"Chu Wanning estimated Xia Si Ni's age. At that time, he was still in Linyi. He then said calmly, \"Confucian Wind Sect.\"\"Oh \u2026\" Mo Ran slightly raised his eyebrows.This gave Chu Wanning an opening. The Confucian Wind Sect had always respected the male disciples. Although the female disciples were not mistreated in teaching martial arts, they never had the opportunity to show their faces in public. When they went out, they never left their names behind. Therefore, although the female cultivators of the Confucian Wind Sect were quite capable, people in Jianghu only knew the four words \"Confucian Wind Sect female cultivators\". No one knew their names and lives. Therefore, Chu Wanning randomly made up stories. In any case, there was no way to verify them.However, Mo Ran was not a person who would give up easily. He immediately refocused and asked persistently, \"Then when did Shiniang and Shiniang meet? How did they meet?\"\"This \u2026\"Chu Wanning could not make up a story. He was hesitating when his eyes met Mo Ran's bright eyes. He suddenly realized that he did not need to answer his question. He immediately pursed his lips and waved his wide sleeves. He said coldly, \"Why are you asking so many questions about my personal affairs?\"As he said this, he pulled the reins and spurred his horse. His white robe left behind, leaving Mo Ran far behind him.The two of them wandered outside for more than ten days. They went to several small sects in a row and searched around the weapons and spirit stone stalls in the market. However, they did not find any clues.On this day, Chu Wanning used the Tang Flower to send a message as usual. After exchanging news with Xue Zhengyong, he left the inn with Mo Ran and went to the market under Lonemoon Night's sect to check on the situation.Lonemoon Night was the world's number one sect of medicine. It was also the sect of Xue Meng's birth mother, Madam Wang.This sect was built on an island called \"Lin Ling Island\". However, in reality, Lin Ling Island was not a real island. It was the back of a giant Black Tortoise.That Black Tortoise had a lifespan of millions of years. It had signed a blood contract with Lonemoon Night's ancestor elder. It carried the entire sect and roamed the sea, using its unique Immortal Qi to nourish the thousands of trees and flowers on the island.Lonemoon Night's disciples had always been mysterious and did not compete with the world.The sect itself did not have frequent communication with the outside world. Only on the first and fifteenth of every month, the Black Tortoise would carry the entire sect near the port of Yangzhou. At this time, people from other sects would come to the island to buy medicine. There would also be merchants selling weapons and spirit stones to them, as well as some goods that could not be bought on the island.However, the most famous sect on Lin Ling Island was not Lonemoon Night, but the \"Xuan Yuan Pavilion\". The Xuan Yuan Pavilion belonged to Lonemoon Night's sect. It was a famous trading company in the world of cultivation.This trading company opened twice a month and sold Lonemoon Night's best medicine as well as rare treasures sold by various sellers.Although the goods often touched the taboo of the world of cultivation, no one dared to make an enemy of Lonemoon Night. After all, more than half of the spiritual medicine in the world of cultivation came from this sect. From a certain point of view, Lonemoon Night's strength was not inferior to that of the current number one sect, the \"Confucian Wind Sect\".\"There are too many people here. Put on your cloak.\"As more and more people came to Lin Ling Island, Chu Wanning pulled down the hood of his cloak and reminded Mo Ran softly.Although the Xuan Yuan Pavilion had set up private rooms for the major sects to show respect, because this was a trading place for selling stolen goods and gray transactions, in most cases, the cultivators would not show their true faces for fear of being found out or getting killed for no reason.Mo Ran and Chu Wanning entered the Xuan Yuan Pavilion. The pavilion was divided into three floors. In the center of the first floor stood a white jade platform with a nine-petaled lotus. It was covered with nine layers of indestructible protective enchantments. This was the place where the goods would be displayed.With the white jade platform as the core, hundreds of benches made of red rosewood extended to the four directions of north, south, east and west. These were the most common seats.The second floor was a private room. In front of each room was a large golden Nanmu window. In front of the window was a layer of gauze. The curtain was made of Silver Moon Yarn. From the inside, one could see the outside clearly, but from the outside, one could not see the scene inside. It was very good to protect the privacy of the guests.However, the price was very expensive. It cost nine thousand gold per hour.Chu Wanning did not like to squeeze with others. He took the gold leaf sent by Xue Zhengyong and spent it without feeling any heartache.The servants who served the guests in the Xuan Yuan Pavilion had signed a life and death contract with the pavilion master. They would not leak any of the guests' private matters. Even so, Chu Wanning was still not at ease. He asked for the best room and asked the servant to bring two pots of Snow Ground Cold Fragrance, eight fresh fruits, eight candied fruits, four cakes and four candies. Then, he asked the servant to leave.Only he and Mo Ran were left in the room. Chu Wanning raised his hand and pulled down his cloak. He stood in front of the window and looked at the crowded heads below.\"I heard from the Lord that this time, the Xuan Yuan Festival will be selling a weapon called Return.\"\"Return?\" Mo Ran shook his head. \"I've never heard of it.\"\"It's a Divine Weapon.\"Mo Ran was shocked. \"Divine Weapon?But didn't Jin Chengchi already \u2014 \"\"I know what you are getting at.However, it's said that Return was discovered in a nameless tomb in Myriad God Ridge. It was likely that its previous owner did not have an heir when he died, so the Divine Weapon was buried with him. \"\"\u2026 So that's how it is.\"However, the Divine Weapon only recognized its owner. When the owner died, the Divine Weapon would recognize his heir.Even if others obtained the Divine Weapon, they would not be able to use even a fraction of its strength. From Mo Ran's point of view, there was not much point in buying such a weapon.Chu Wanning read Mo Ran's mind and said, \"Although the Divine Weapon cannot unleash its true strength without recognizing its owner, its strength is still several times stronger than ordinary weapons.People will still flock to it. \"Mo Ran was enlightened. \"I understand what Master is getting at. Ordinary people might not even see a Divine Weapon in their entire lives. Since it is said that Return was discovered in a nameless tomb and has been around for a long time, it is likely that people will use their own spiritual energy to test it. What if they are the original owner's descendants?There's no harm in trying. \"\"That's true.\"Mo Ran pondered and said, \"The Divine Weapon is rare, but now, there's an ownerless one up for auction.No matter how I look at it, it looks like the fake Gouchen's ploy. He would use a high quality replica to trick everyone into releasing their spiritual energy, so as to let him know if anyone here has the essence he is looking for. \"Chu Wanning sat down on a soft chair and poured himself a cup of Snow Ground Cold Incense before slowly drinking it.He looked at the sea of people below and whispered, \"That's true.Regardless of whether this Divine Weapon is real or not, or if it's a trap set by the fake Gouchen, it's never wrong to test it out. \"Just as he finished speaking, there was a commotion below.Chu Wanning and Mo Ran looked down and were slightly taken aback.They saw the golden door of Xuanyuan Pavilion open. Among a sea of hooded cultivators, two rows of blue-robed youths with jade crowns on their heads walked out. The man leading them was slender and handsome. He did not hide his stroll in the black market at all.Mo Ran exclaimed, \"Ye Wangxi?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe newcomer was none other than the modest gentleman, Ye Wangxi, who had shared a courtyard with Mo Ran in the Peach Blossom Spring.Today, he wore the Confucian Wind Sect's blue crane robe embroidered with silver threads, a sapphire blue hair band, and a silver sachet of auspicious beasts holding pearls at his waist. Perhaps because he had taken off his martial attire, his appearance was still handsome, but it also added a bit of elegance.The chief steward of the Xuanyuan Pavilion came forward to greet him. He lowered his head and said, \"Immortal Master Ye.\"Ye Wangxi nodded and said, \"I have come to bid on something on the orders of my adoptive father. I'll have to trouble the chief steward to lead me upstairs.\"\"The Pavilion Master already knows that Immortal Master has arrived. The Confucian Wind Sect's private room has already been prepared. I'll take you upstairs.\"Ye Wangxi led the dozen or so disciples of the Confucian Wind Sect upstairs, leaving behind a crowd of people in the hall who covered their faces and whispered to each other.\"The people of the Confucian Wind Sect also came today?\"\"Who is that Immortal Master?How come I've never seen him before \u2026 \"Mo Ran thought to himself, 'You haven't seen him before, so there's naturally a reason why you haven't seen him before.'On the other hand, he couldn't help but be curious. He watched as Ye Wangxi's figure disappeared around the corner, then said to Chu Wanning, \"Shizun, you also stayed in the Confucian Wind Sect before. Do you know this Immortal Master Ye?\"\"I don't know him.\"Chu Wanning frowned slightly. \"But I keep feeling that he looks familiar \u2026\" He paused, closed his eyes, and thought for a while. In the end, he still shook his head. \"I can't remember.\"Mo Ran scratched his head and said, \"This Immortal Master Ye stayed in the same courtyard as me in the Peach Blossom Spring. His strength isn't bad.Now that he's here to bid on behalf of the Confucian Wind Sect, his status in the sect shouldn't be low. Shizun actually doesn't know him? \"\"The Confucian Wind Sect has a total of seventy-two cities, and its members are very scattered.I don't like to move around, and I don't feel like asking about the affairs of the sect, so it's not strange that I don't know him. \"As the two of them were talking, the Confucian Wind Sect box on the third floor lit up with bright yellow candlelight. Presumably, Ye Wangxi and his group had already entered and taken their seats.The highest floor of the Xuan Yuan Pavilion was specially reserved for the major sects, but it was rarely used, so everyone raised their heads to look at it and felt very strange.With the Scholarly Wind Sect's public participation, everyone's expectations for this auction immediately rose by several degrees.After about ten minutes, the white jade lotus platform in the center suddenly glowed brightly. From the dome of the Xuanyuan Pavilion, a glowing red silk cloth was thrown down. A pretty girl, about eleven or twelve years old, wearing a snow-white silk cloth, descended from the sky with bare feet and gently landed on the cold white jade lotus platform. She was wearing a snow-white silk cloth, and was holding the silk cloth. She was barefooted.\"Sorry for the wait, Immortal Monarchs. I am the Second Pavilion Master of the Xuan Yuan Pavilion.\"That pretty little girl smiled and said, \"I am indebted to the Immortal Monarchs for thinking so highly of me, coming from all over the world to attend this meeting.Naturally, the Xuan Yuan Pavilion will adhere to tradition and repay everyone with the best treasures. \"Mo Ran's hearing was good, so he heard the people below discussing, \"The Second Pavilion Master of the Xuan Yuan Pavilion is actually a little girl who is still wet behind the ears?\"\"Aiyo, brother, you really don't know anything.Do you know how old this' little girl 'is? \"\"Ten?Fifteen?She can't be twenty, right? \"\"Hey, are you dumbfounded? She's over a hundred years old. You should be calling her great-grandmother, not a little girl.\"\"What?!Brother Liu, are you kidding me?How could this little thing be a hundred years old?! \"\"This is the Lone Moon Night, the number one medicine sect in the world. What is impossible? It's just a pill for eternal youth, that's all.\"\"Wow!\"The person who exclaimed in a low voice must have been here for the first time. After hearing these words, he excitedly craned his neck and couldn't help but play with the pouch he carried with him. Obviously, he couldn't wait to know what kind of spiritual medicine and treasures the Xuan Yuan Pavilion would take out to sell.The Second Pavilion Master did not disappoint them. With a snap of her fingers, the center of the stone lotus cracked open, and a small pedestal in the shape of a stamen slowly rose up. On the pedestal were five palm-sized velvet boxes. Each of the boxes was opened generously, revealing pills that glowed with a mother-of-pearl luster.Immediately, someone laughed and shouted, \"Isn't this the Infatuated Pill?What's so strange about it? \"\"That's right. Even if the first thing to be sold is not a rare treasure, you can't use the Infatuated Pill to make up the number.\"The Second Pavilion Master heard the clamor below, but she was not angry. Instead, she smiled and said in a clear voice, \"Everyone has good eyesight. This is indeed the Infatuated Pill.However, as everyone knows, although the Infatuated Pill is difficult to refine, it is not an extremely rare item. Naturally, my Xuan Yuan Pavilion will not use ordinary items to entertain our guests. \"As she spoke, she picked up one of the boxes and held it in her palm. With a click, she closed the box.Although everyone was sitting far away from each other, there was a spirit mirror in front of them. They could clearly see the details of the treasures. At this time, everyone noticed the snake emblem on the lid of the box.\"Han Lin Divine Hands?!\" Someone sucked in a breath of cold air.The Second Pavilion Master smiled and said, \"That's right. Each of these five boxes of Infatuated Pills came from the pill furnace of our sect's elder, Han Lin Divine Hands.Although ordinary Infatuated Pills can bewitch people and make them infatuated with them, the effect can only last for half a year. Moreover, it is very easy to concoct the corresponding antidote.However, these five \u2026 \"She lifted the box with her delicate fingertips and said seriously,\" can last for a full ten years, and there is no antidote for it. \"\"What?\"\"Heavens, how is this possible \u2026\"\"Han Lin Divine Hands is really too scary \u2026\"The Second Pavilion Master waited for the noise below to die down before she smiled and said, \"In order to distinguish these from ordinary Infatuated Pills, Han Lin Divine Hands named these five pills Infatuated Pills.You only need to buy one and mix it in water to persuade someone to drink it. Within ten years, I guarantee that the other party will be infatuated with you and will not waver. \"A female cultivator asked in a loud voice, \"Is there really no antidote for this pill after eating it?What if I don't like him after ten years? Won't he continue to pester me? \"Everyone chuckled.The Second Pavilion Master also smiled politely and said, \"Miss is right. Therefore, the Xuanyuan Pavilion would like to remind everyone that there is no antidote for the Infatuated Pills in this world. Unless the ten years are up, only death can cure it.If you are not infatuated with him, it is best not to drug him. \"After the introductions, they began to bid.Mo Ran looked at the people who were shouting one after another. Most of them were female cultivators. He couldn't help but be speechless.\"This is really too scary.\"\"That's right.The feelings that are earned like this are really boring. \"Hearing Chu Wanning's response, Mo Ran turned his head and looked back and forth at him. He said with a smile, \"Shizun, you have to be careful. You're so good-looking, I'm afraid that a female cultivator who has been at the peak of life and death here will buy you and secretly put it in your water to make you fall in love with her.But you're a married man, so you can't get close to other people. \"\"\u2026 \u2026\"This person made fun of him. Chu Wanning wanted to get angry, but this was the first time in his life that he heard Mo Ran say that he was good-looking, so he couldn't get angry. So he pursed his lips into a cold line and turned his face away, too lazy to pay attention to him.\"But if she really gave the other party this kind of medicine, she must like the other party very much.\"Mo Ran muttered. Seeing that the five boxes of medicinal pills were quickly bought, he sighed and shook his head. \"So pitiful.\"Chu Wanning stared at the snow-white wall for a while, then said calmly, \"If she really liked the other party, how could she bear to give him this kind of medicine?You're still young. There are some things that you don't understand. \"I'm still young?Mo Ran turned his head and smiled with deep dimples. \"I don't understand, but Shizun does?Then does Shizun want to talk to me about Shizun again? \"\"Get lost.\"\"Hahahahaha.\"Amidst the laughter, the second item was placed on the display table.\"Mantis Dew.\"The Second Pavilion Master introduced crisply, \"This is still from Han Lin's furnace. This is the latest medicinal dew that Han Lin has brewed.Lonemoon's generation of disciples have all tried it, and it's very effective. \"Cultivator A was rather cultured. \"Mantis Dew?\"Cultivator B was a little hungry. \"Mantis Dew?\"Cultivator C was perverted. \"Mantis Dew?\"Chu Wanning pondered for a moment, then his eyelashes trembled slightly. He looked at the five porcelain bottles on the display table. \"Mantis Dew \u2026 Dream-Eating Tapir?\"The Second Pavilion Master didn't mean to spoil everyone's appetite. Seeing that everyone was confused, he immediately explained with a smile, \"The reason why it's called Mantis Dew is because the medicinal ingredient used is the blood of the mutated beast, Dream-Eating Tapir.Just mixing a drop into tea and drinking it will last for seven days, and you will have good dreams every day.This doesn't mean much to ordinary cultivators, but due to the influence of cultivation methods and cultivation, some Immortal Monarchs have endless nightmares and can't sleep peacefully.After a long time, it's very easy for them to go berserk, so this Mantis Dew is the best choice. \"Hearing this, Chu Wanning suddenly thought of the realistic dream he had previously. Although it wasn't a nightmare, it did make him feel vaguely uneasy \u2026The Second Pavilion Master was still pushing her medicine with all her might. \"In addition, this Mantis Dew also has the effect of regulating Spirit Qi and helping with cultivation.\"Chu Wanning was still deep in thought, unmoved.\"If there are children cultivating at home, this Mantis Dew is also very good for them.Han Lin thought that there would be a teacher buying it for Tong Xiu, so he specially made these five bottles of Mantis Dew into five different flavors.The red bottle is lychee flavor, the yellow one is orange flavor, the white one is lactose flavor, the purple one is grape flavor, and the black one is mulberry flavor.The sweetness is very pure, and the taste is a hundred times better than ordinary candies. Once you drink it, the taste can stay in your mouth for a whole day. It's very wonderful. \"As soon as she finished speaking, a silver stick fell from the second floor.Because the second and third floors were far away, it was inconvenient to call out the price, so the price was written on the silver stick, and then the stick was thrown down. The silver stick was covered with a spell and would accurately float in front of the Pavilion Master.The Second Pavilion Master pinched the stick that floated in front of her and looked at it. \"\u2026\"At the same time, in the private room, Chu Wanning casually put down the finished brush and leisurely drank his tea. Mo Ran looked at him from the side and couldn't help but twitch the corner of his mouth.The Second Pavilion Master's voice came from downstairs. \"The second floor's Heaven Room bids five hundred thousand gold. Is there anyone who wants to increase the price?\"As soon as this was said, there was an uproar everywhere.This Mantis Dew was good, but it was obviously not as popular as the Aphrodisiac Pills. Five boxes of Aphrodisiac Pills were sold for three hundred thousand gold, and these five bottles of Mantis Dew were sold for five hundred thousand gold. This price was already too high.\"It should be the parents of some young master who bought it.\" Someone muttered.\"It must be for the young master of a rich family to cultivate.\"Some of the cultivators in the crowd who had suffered from qi deviation hardened their hearts. \"I bid five hundred and fifty thousand gold for these five bottles.\"\"Mantis Dew, the current price is five hundred and fifty thousand gold. Is there anyone \u2014\"Before the Second Pavilion Master could finish speaking, another silver stick slowly floated down from the air. It was also thrown down from the second floor's Heaven Room.She took a look and couldn't help but open her eyes wide.\"My apologies, everyone, I misunderstood earlier. I would like to correct it. Just now, the guest on the second floor said that he bid five hundred thousand gold for each bottle, so the total is two and a half million gold \u2026\"Only a fool would fight with Chu Wanning for this price. Seeing the attendant bring in the five bottles of Mantis Dew, Mo Ran felt that his entire body was not very good.Two and a half million gold \u2026Chu Wanning bought him a dessert \u2026Seeing Mo Ran's expression as if he had seen a ghost, Chu Wanning calmly asked, \"What's wrong?\"\"Ahaha, it's nothing. I just didn't expect Master to like this kind of thing.\"\"How could I like a child's toy?\" Chu Wanning calmly said, \"I bought it for Xia Si Ni.\"\"\u2026\"Pretending.Mo Ran's eyebrows twitched. Let's see how long you can pretend.The items for sale were taken out one by one. Although the following items were also rare spiritual medicines and treasures, they were of no value to Mo Ran and Chu Wanning. The two of them drank tea while waiting for Shen Wu's \"return\".Mo Ran leaned against the window. His black clothes wrapped around his thin waist, making his shoulders and legs look even wider. He looked at the lively situation below and then looked up at the Confucian Wind Sect's private room upstairs.\"That's right, Master, how did Uncle settle the matter of the Peach Blossom Spring?You haven't told me the details yet. \"\"It can't be considered settled.This matter can't be blown out of proportion, for fear of alerting the enemy.Although the High Lord knew the truth, he couldn't expose it. However, he fell out with the feathermen and brought Shi Mei and Xue Meng back to the Peak of Life and Death.At that time, the quarrel was very fierce. The disciples of several sects saw it. Some people felt that the Peach Blossom Spring was unreliable and left.This Ye Wangxi is probably one of them. \"Chu Wanning finished eating a piece of osmanthus cake and reached for the second one. \"The High Lord said to the outside world that you caused trouble and is reflecting behind closed doors at the Peak of Life and Death. This can more or less cover your tracks for a while.\"Mo Ran scratched his head. \"It sounds very troublesome. Thank you for your hard work, Uncle \u2026\"While muttering, the Pavilion Master of the Xuanyuan Pavilion on the Nine-Layered Lotus Platform suddenly used a sound amplification technique to clear his throat. His pleasant voice instantly spread to every inch of space.\"The next item for sale is an extremely rare treasure. It can be ranked in the top ten of our pavilion's three year auction.\"With just this sentence, there was dead silence everywhere.After a while, it was as if a spoonful of water had been poured into a pot of boiling oil. With a whoosh, there was an uproar.Almost everyone's eyes shone brightly as they whispered to each other.To be ranked in the top ten of Xuanyuan Pavilion's three year auction, what kind of treasure was this?For many people, to be able to see this kind of thing with their own eyes was a great fortune, not to mention buying it.The buyers were getting more and more excited. The tension in the air had even reached the point where it could be touched.The people below were looking forward to it. The people in the box also looked up and focused their gazes on the Lotus Platform.Mo Ran said softly, \"Is it the return of Shen Wu?\"Chu Wanning didn't say anything.As the center of the stone platform split open again, the Second Pavilion Master of the Xuanyuan Pavilion's clear voice reverberated everywhere.\"Please bring up this treasure, the Butterfly Bone Beauty Seat.\"\"What?\"Mo Ran was shocked. His hand suddenly gripped the window frame. \"It's not Shen Wu?!\"Chu Wanning didn't expect this either. He suddenly stood up and walked to Mo Ran's side, looking downstairs with him.They saw a stone couch slowly rising from the center of the Lotus Platform. Eight shackles as thick as a person's wrist were stacked on top of the couch, locking up a constantly struggling living thing.However, that living thing was completely covered by a felt, so for a moment, no one could clearly see what was underneath.However, this didn't affect the excited atmosphere in the slightest.The Butterfly Bone Beauty Seat, regardless of appearance, was already famous throughout the world.During the Primordial Era, before heaven and earth were separated, the Demon Race and the Human Race lived together on the Cultivation Continent.At that time, there was a race of demons called the Butterfly Bone Race. Their martial strength wasn't high, but their bodies contained an enormous amount of spiritual energy.Directly eating the flesh of a member of the Butterfly Bone Race or having intercourse with them could greatly increase one's cultivation. Those without spiritual roots could instantly reach the Foundation Establishment Stage, while those with spiritual roots could directly advance to the Grandmaster Stage.It was precisely because of this that the Butterfly Bone Race was exterminated in the early days of the Great War. They were either captured as slaves for intercourse or directly killed to eat their flesh and drink their blood.Until now, there were no true members of the Butterfly Bone Race in the world. However, in the vast sea of people, there were still descendants of the Butterfly Bone Race. Most of their flesh and blood were useless, and they were no different from ordinary cultivators.However, there were still a very small number of people who showed signs of atavism. Although their flesh and blood weren't as effective as their ancestors in the Primordial Era, they could still greatly increase a cultivator's talent.These people were called the \"Butterfly Bone Beauty Banquet\". This \"banquet\" had two meanings.A pillow seat.Or a banquet.It meant that they could be placed on the pillow seat to have intercourse, or eaten alive. The former and the latter depended on the preferences of the buyer.When a member of the Butterfly Bone Race showed signs of atavism, the Cultivation World would not treat them as \"humans\". Although they were no different from ordinary people, the Cultivation World defined them as \"goods\" due to their own selfish desires.Therefore, although the act of selling the Butterfly Bone Beauty Seat was terrifying, it didn't violate any taboos.However, a righteous Grandmaster like Chu Wanning had a very ugly expression.\"This Butterfly Bone Beauty Seat was not obtained by Lonemoon. It was sold on commission. Therefore, the Xuan Yuan Pavilion will take 30% of the price of the transaction as commission. Immortal Lords, please calculate the amount clearly and act according to your ability.\"After the Second Pavilion Master finished speaking, he snapped his fingers, and the felt cloth covering the bed slid down.Inside the pavilion, there was complete silence.Everyone stared intently at the chained body on the stone bed. In the huge Xuan Yuan Pavilion, even the sound of breathing and heartbeat could be heard.It was a young woman with a slender body and snow-white skin.Her long silk-like hair was draped over her shoulders, and she was completely naked except for a layer of transparent gauze. Her full and lustrous body trembled slightly, like newly frozen snow or jade soaked in water, emitting a soft glow under the light.Eight iron chains were tightly wrapped around her delicate body, clanging as she struggled, but it easily aroused the bestial desires of the men.Even the dissolute men who had seen countless women would admit without hesitation that this woman was a rare beauty in the world.\"Excellent quality.A female Butterfly Bone Beauty Seat in the prime of her youth. \"The Second Pavilion Master smiled sweetly. He stepped forward and untied one of the chains. Before the woman could resist, he grabbed her wrist and raised her in the air. \"The Chastity Sand that the Cold Scaled Divine Hand put on is good for everyone to see clearly.She is a virgin. \"The woman's mouth was wrapped with a snow-white cloth. She made a pitiful sound, but couldn't say a word. Only big drops of tears rolled down the corners of her eyes. Those golden tears undoubtedly showed that she was an atavistic descendant of the Butterfly Bone Clan.Some people were gasping, and some were swallowing their saliva. Such an atmosphere made the Xuanyuan Pavilion not seem to be full of cultivators for a moment, but more like a pack of hungry wolves, drooling at the corners of their mouths, greedily staring at their prey.\"Pa!\"Chu Wanning retracted his cold gaze and looked at Mo Ran.Mo Ran's face was pale, and his fingernails dug into the wooden lattice. He actually broke a corner of the windowsill.\"What's wrong?\"\"No,... nothing.\"Mo Ran took a deep breath and forced himself to calm down. He shook his head at Chu Wanning. \"I feel that buying and selling living people like this... is disgusting.\"He wasn't telling the truth.His eyes quietly glanced back at the Butterfly Bone Beauty Seat.This woman was the number one beauty in the Cultivation World that he married after he became an emperor in his previous life \u2014Song Qiutong!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAt the same time, in the Rufeng Sect's private room on the third floor, Ye Wangxi's tall and slender figure stood beside the carved railing of the hollowed out Tong Hua flower pattern. His brows were tightly furrowed, and his lips were thinly pursed.\"Young Master Ye, Elder Xu asked us to buy the Divine Martial Sword. If you really want to bid for the Butterfly Bone Beauty Seat, I'm afraid you won't have enough money \u2026\"\"It's fine. I'll pay for it myself.\"Seeing Ye WangXi's insistence, they secretly looked at each other and didn't utter another word.The Second Pavilion Master of the Xuanyuan Pavilion said crisply, \"The Butterfly Bone Beauty Seat starts at 10 million gold coins. Immortals can bid higher.\"\"11 million.\"\"12 million.\"The noise on the first floor grew louder and louder as the price soared rapidly.\"19 million!\"\"I bid 25 million!\"The sudden increase of 6 million made many cultivators sigh and sit down while shaking their heads.At this time, the silver slips from the private rooms on the second floor fell in front of the Pavilion Master of the Xuanyuan Pavilion. She quickly took them one by one and opened the slips between her fingers. Like opening a folding fan, she opened the slips with the price written on them.\"The highest bid.\"After the Second Pavilion Master read it, she said clearly, \"The Black Room No. 1 offers 35 million.\"\"35 million?!\"Everyone gasped and looked back at the Black Room on the second floor. However, the lights were dim and the silver gauze fluttered, but they couldn't see who was sitting there.\"35 million is enough to buy a palace on the Immortal Island.\"\"Who offered such a high price? It's too outrageous \u2026\"\"So rich, it must be someone from the Ten Great Sects. I wonder which one it is?\"Chu Wanning closed his eyes. When he heard the price, he asked Mo Ran, \"Did you bring enough money?\"\"Not enough!\"Mo Ran was extremely shocked to see Song Qiutong here. When he heard Chu Wanning calling him, he suddenly came back to his senses and asked cautiously, \"What do you want to do, Master?\"\"Buy her.\"Mo Ran widened his eyes and waved his hands. \"No, no, this woman is a burden. Where are we going to put her after we buy her?In the future, we'll need to rent an extra horse and book an extra room to sleep in. No, I won't buy it. \"\"Who said I was going to travel with her?Just buy her and set her free. \"Chu Wanning opened his eyes and stretched out his hand indifferently.\" Give me the money. \"Mo Ran clutched his money pouch tightly. \"No, no!\"\"I'll return it to you when we get back.\"\"This is the money to buy Shenwu!\"\"Didn't you see a ghost?What did he want Shenwu for?Give me the money! \"\"\u2026\"Mo Ran felt like his head was about to explode. This Song Qiutong, when he first met her in his previous life, she was already a disciple of the Confucian Wind Sect. At that time, when Mo Ran massacred the city, he saw that she looked a bit like Shi Mei, so he spared her life. Later, he saw that she was well-behaved and obedient, and her temperament was very similar to Shi Mei's, so he finally made her his empress.However, this was one of the decisions that Mo Ran made that he regretted the most.Now, Chu Wanning, this cold hearted guy, actually wanted to buy her. How could Mo Ran agree to this?Not to mention 40 million, even if this woman was worth 4 copper coins, Mo Ran wouldn't want it.No!Even if someone gave him 40 million, he wouldn't want it!The two were in a deadlock. Suddenly, they saw a golden stick floating down from the third floor.It was the top stick!The most expensive stick in the Xuan Yuan Pavilion was this kind of golden stick. There was no need to write anything on it. A stick was equivalent to 50 million gold. Once this kind of price was announced, almost no one would have the strength to compete, so it was also called the \"top stick\".Everyone was stunned, and then there was an uproar.\"The Confucian Wind Sect!\"\"The Confucian Wind Sect has a top stick!\"Chu Wanning no longer paid attention to Mo Ran who was tightly clutching his money pouch. Instead, he turned his head and looked outside.From his angle, he could see the first room on the third floor. Ye Wangxi was a person who was too lazy to hide. He had already tied up the snow moon gauze used by the Xuan Yuan Pavilion to protect the privacy of the guests. He stood with his hands behind his back and stood by the railing.His expression was solemn, and there was no extra expression on his handsome face. He glanced at the noisy scene below and seemed to be somewhat speechless. He turned around and walked into the depths of the room.Mo Ran heaved a sigh of relief and said to Chu Wanning, \"Master, you can rest assured. This Young Master Ye lives with me in the Peach Blossom Spring. I have some understanding of him. He is kind and benevolent. He won the Butterfly Bone Beauty Seat, so he won't do anything heartless.\"In the Confucian Wind Sect's room on the third floor, Ye Wangxi sat at a table covered with embroidered golden flowers and silver leaves. He poured a cup of fragrant tea.When the tea was finished, there was a knock on the door.Ye Wangxi's voice was gentle and proper. \"Please come in.\"\"Immortal Master Ye, the Butterfly Bone Beauty Seat has been brought to you. Please take a look.\"\"Thank you for your trouble. You may leave.\"The Xuan Yuan Pavilion's maids retreated, and the room was silent for a moment.The Butterfly Bone Beauty Seat's hands and feet were bound by the Forbidden Spell. She knelt on the ground, and there was panic in her eyes as she trembled. Because of her miserable crying, her peach blossom eyes were tinged with a faint red hue. It was very moving.However, Ye Wangxi glanced at her. There was no distracting thought in his clear eyes. He raised his hand and removed the restriction.\"The floor is cold. Miss, you are frightened.Sit down and have a cup of hot tea. \"\"\u2026\" The Butterfly Bone Beauty Seat trembled. She opened her crystal-like eyes and continued to curl up. She didn't dare to speak or move.Ye Wangxi sighed. He asked the left and right attendants to bring a cloak and handed it to her.\"Miss, don't worry. I didn't redeem you for cultivation.Put on this cloak first. If there's anything, we can talk about it later. \"\"You \u2026 you \u2026\"Ye Wangxi saw that she still didn't move. She looked very pitiful as she raised her head timidly. He smiled bitterly and shook his head. He knelt down on one knee and was level with her.\"My name is Ye Wangxi. May I ask for your name?\"\"My \u2026 my surname is Song.\"She hesitantly glanced at Ye Wangxi. Her eyes were hazy and she looked very wronged. \"My name is Song Qiutong. Thank you, Young Master Ye \u2026\"Downstairs, Mo Ran was secretly pondering.In his previous life, when he saw Song Qiutong, she was already a disciple of the Confucian Wind Sect. Presumably, she was saved by Ye Wangxi during the auction at the Xuan Yuan Pavilion.The Butterfly Bone Beauty Seat wouldn't be treated like a normal person. However, once they entered the sect of a great Immortal Sect and became a disciple, it was a different story.Mo Ran sighed in his heart. He didn't have a deep understanding of Ye Wangxi. He only knew that this person was very upright and was the most powerful person in the world besides Chu Wanning.When Mo Ran slaughtered the seventy-two cities of the Confucian Wind Sect, he had fought with Ye Wangxi once. That surging momentum of his swordsmanship and his heroic figure were truly unforgettable.Among the majestic seventy-two cities, Mo Ran easily took down the rest of the immortal cities. Those long-winded and famous Confucian Wind Sect City Masters were nothing in his eyes.Only this Ye Wangxi, only this Ye Wangxi, Mo Ran couldn't take down the seven cities he guarded for a long time.Even when the cities were finally broken, this person knelt among the jagged bones covered in blood. His eyes were clear and his heart didn't change.At that time, the Confucian Wind Sect's Sect Master Nangong had fled. Many people kowtowed and begged for mercy, begging Mo Ran to let them live.However, Ye Wangxi's long eyebrows were knitted. He closed his eyes and his expression was cold.Mo Ran still remembered that before he killed him, he asked him, \"Will you surrender?\"\"No, I won't.\"Mo Ran smiled. He sat on the golden dragon and phoenix chair of the Confucian Wind Sect's Sect Master. His eyelashes trembled as his gaze swept across the dense crowd. Not to mention the ordinary disciples, there were six or seven city masters and more than ten protectors. They were all prostrating themselves in the dust, trembling.Jackdaws circled in the lead-gray sky and blood-red banners fluttered in the wind. Mo Ran raised his hand and said, \"Kill them all.\"Before Ye Wangxi died, he said, \"Among the seventy-two cities of the glorious Confucian Wind Sect, not a single one is a man.\"Bloody light filled the sky.Mo Ran held the newly obtained beauty Song Qiutong in his arms. That peerless beauty's face was like gold paper. Looking at the Asura hell in front of her, her soft body couldn't help but shiver.\"Good girl, don't be afraid.Don't be afraid.From now on, you'll follow me. \"Mo Ran stroked her hair and smiled.\" Come, tell me again. What's your name?What did you do in the Confucian Wind Sect?I just heard it once, but I didn't remember it well. \"\"My name is \u2026 Song Qiutong.\" She said in panic, \"I was \u2026 I was Ye Wangxi's \u2026 maid \u2026\"Ye Wangxi's maid.At that time, she had answered Mo Ran like this.However, as a butterfly bone beauty, Mo Ran didn't know what kind of opportunity did she have to enter the Confucian Wind Sect, and how Ye Wangxi took her in as a maid.Until today, after his rebirth and coming to the Xuanyuan Pavilion, Mo Ran suddenly realized that it was actually Ye Wangxi who had scattered his daughter in order to save her from danger.However, it was clear that Ye Wangxi's eventual defeat under Mo Ran's blade was largely due to Qiutong's informant.Thinking about this, Mo Ran couldn't help but frown. His hatred for Qiutong increased by several degrees \u2014 he must have been possessed back then to think that this woman was actually Shi Mei.\"The last item in this auction is an ownerless Divine Weapon.\"Second Pavilion Master said tirelessly, interrupting Mo Ran's thoughts. \"This Divine Weapon doesn't belong to Mo Ran. It's also being consigned on his behalf.\"The finale of every auction would be leaked before the start of the auction. Therefore, compared to the intense reaction when they heard the words \"butterfly bone beauty\" just now, although the cultivators below were eager to try, they were much calmer.The white jade lotus bloomed again, and a silver satin box with the pattern of sun, moon, mountains and rivers on the stone platform slowly floated up.The box was long and narrow, and the embroidery on the surface was very delicate. Those who were knowledgeable could tell at a glance that the golden thread totem on the box was from the most famous embroidery workshop in Gusu, Xianyun Pavilion.Aside from the Divine Weapon inside, this box alone was worth hundreds of gold ingots.\"This Divine Weapon was found in Mount Jun's Mass Burial Mound.Its previous owner has passed away, and after verification by the Xuanyuan Pavilion, the Divine Weapon has not recognized a new owner. \"Second Pavilion Master paused and continued,\" As everyone knows, the weapons of the Divine Weapon are engraved with inscriptions.However, because the owner of this weapon has passed away for many years, the inscriptions on the weapon have been worn out. The only thing that can be recognized is the word 'return'. \"Someone muttered, \"After saying so much, why don't you open the box first?\"\"Aiyo, forget it. You'll get used to it. Isn't this the usual style of the Xuanyuan Pavilion?Let's say a few words first, then show the goods to everyone. \"\"That's true.\"Mo Ran found it funny. He turned his head and wanted to say a few words to Chu Wanning. However, when he turned around, he saw Chu Wanning's sword-like eyebrows furrowed. Chu Wanning's slender jade-like fingers were supporting his forehead. His face was as white as frost.He jumped in fright and hurriedly asked, \"Shizun, what's wrong?\"\"Suddenly \u2026 I feel uncomfortable.\"\"Why are you uncomfortable? Did you catch a cold again?\" Mo Ran leaned over and touched his forehead. \"You don't have a fever.\"\"\u2026\" Chu Wanning shook his head but didn't say anything. His expression was listless.Mo Ran didn't know what to do. He could only say, \"I'll pour you a cup of tea.\"As he spoke, he poured a cup of hot tea. After thinking for a while, he also poured in a little bit of the Mianxiang Dew that he had just bought.The medicine refined by the Cold Scale Divine Hand was world-famous. After Chu Wanning finished drinking the tea mixed with the Mianxiang Dew, he did feel better. His face didn't look as bad as before.He raised his eyes and looked at the bidding below again.Mo Ran stood to the side and tidied up the tea set. He poured a second cup for him.\"The Xuanyuan Pavilion doesn't know the full name of the Divine Martial Weapon. However, due to a coincidence, it returned to the world. Moreover, the inscription on the weapon itself has the word 'return'.Therefore, we temporarily came up with a name for it, 'Return'. \"Finally, an impatient person couldn't wait any longer and shouted from below, \"Pavilion Master, you've said so much. You've also whetted our appetite. Quickly open the box and let us see what this Divine Martial Weapon looks like.\"The Second Pavilion Master of the Xuanyuan Pavilion smiled faintly. \"Immortal Monarch, don't be impatient.According to the rules of the cultivation world, after the death of the original owner of the Divine Martial Weapon, the weapon should be given to the descendants according to their blood relations.'Return' was found in a mass grave. Our pavilion doesn't know the identity of its original owner.However, after the box is opened, everyone can release their spiritual energy to sense the weapon. If there is someone who resonates with the Divine Martial Weapon, that person will be the blood relative of the original owner.Then, there's no need to bid. 'Return' will naturally belong to the original owner. \"\"Hahaha, how could there be such a coincidence in the world?\"Most of the cultivators present burst into laughter.\"That's right. That's almost impossible.\"\"But it's a waste not to try. It's not bad to try our luck.\"The Second Pavilion Master looked at the people below the stage with a smile and said crisply, \"That's right. It's always good to try your luck.Immortal Monarchs, please focus. I'll open the box now. \"She snapped her fingers. Two of Lonemoon Ye's disciples immediately came up to her left and right. They were both 15 or 16 years old girls. They flew up to the lotus platform and placed their slender hands on the Sun Moon Brocade Box. Each of them had an exquisite crystal key in their hands. They carefully inserted it into the keyhole of the box.With a 'ka' 'ka' 'ka' sound, the lock fell off.When Mo Ran saw this, he inexplicably thought of the scene at the Jin Chengchi when he obtained the 'ghost'.At that time, it was clearly said that \"only the most loved person in the world\" could open the box. He didn't know why the brocade box ended up in Chu Wanning's hands.The surrounding people held their breaths. Countless pairs of eyes hidden under the hoods stared at the narrow box.The lid of the Golden Thread Brocade Box slowly opened. The atmosphere in the air was extremely tense, like a drawn bowstring.Thousands of people gathered in the pavilion. It was so quiet that even the sound of a strand of hair falling to the ground could be heard.Everyone's eyes were fixed on the simple and unadorned blade that was exposed in the box.Some were greedy, some were curious, some were appreciative \u2026Only Mo Ran's eyes widened the moment he saw the weapon in the box. The blood in his eyes faded completely.He had lived two lifetimes. In both his previous and current life, he owned two Divine Weapons. He had fought with more than ten Divine Weapon owners.As for the item that the Xuan Yuan Pavilion put up for auction this time, he thought that he would be unmoved.But he was wrong.\"The Divine Weapon is back.\" The Second Pavilion Master's crisp voice broke the silence. \"The shape of the Modao, four feet long and three inches wide.It has no sheath and is completely black. It doesn't reflect light in the sun. \"Mo Ran's fingertips trembled slightly. He almost blurted out the two words between his lips.\"No return \u2026\"No return \u2026The matter of the Jade Field and Zhu Bridge years ago had repeated itself for another year.\u2014 \u2014\"Mo Ran, you obtained the Divine Weapon. Why did you ask me to seal its consciousness and not give it a name?\"\"Reporting to Master, this disciple is not knowledgeable. This name can only be given once.I'm afraid that if it sounds bad, I won't be satisfied with it in the future. \"\"Mo Ran, why haven't you thought of a name for your Modao yet?You can't keep calling it 'Saber' and 'Saber'. \"\"It's fine. Take your time to think about it.This is a Divine Weapon. I want to give it the most beautiful name in the world. Only then will it be worthy of it. Hahaha. \"Later, Shi Mei died.Mo Ran once wanted Chu Wanning to release the seal. He wanted to name his Divine Weapon \"Bright and Clear\".But at that time, Chu Wanning said that because he fought against the Ghost Realm, his spiritual power was damaged. He really didn't have the energy to release the seal on the blade. So this matter was left unsettled.Later on, Mo Ran and Chu Wanning broke off completely. Mo Ran was no longer willing to beg him to unseal the Mo Sword. Thus, the Mo Sword, which was stained with blood, remained nameless for many years.But this was no longer important. At that time, there was no one in the world who didn't know about Mo Weiyu. Everyone knew about the Asura Blade in his hand.In the end.Chu Wanning also died.What disappeared with him was the seal on Mo Ran's blade that had been sealed for more than ten years.That night, Mo Ran drank a lot of Pear Blossom White and was a little drunk. Stroking the cold blade, he didn't know if he was happy or sad.He flicked the blade and listened to the sound of the drum and horn. Haitang was cold.He was lying on the roof of the Magi Mountain Palace, laughing out loud. He was laughing so hard that he almost went crazy.He didn't remember if he cried that night, but when he woke up in the morning, two cold words were engraved on the Modao that had been nameless for more than ten years.\"No return.\"Jun Bugui.Never to return.But why would this weapon, which had battled with him a hundred times in his previous life, appear in the world after his rebirth? Why would it appear in the auction of the Xuanyuan Pavilion?Before Mo Ran had time to think, the thousands of cultivators in the field released their own spirit flow, scrambling to sense each other with No Return.Mo Ran: \"\u2026\"It was useless. Since it could not return, then since Mo Ran was here, besides him, there could not be a second person in the world who could use this Mo Saber.But did its appearance have anything to do with the little bastard hiding behind the scenes?If it did, that person let No Return out at this time clearly because he knew that Mo Ran and Chu Wanning were tracking his tracks. Then his purpose was definitely not to test who had the essence spiritual body.What did he want to do?!Also, is this sword of no return for real?Or was it just a bait like those fakes of Jin Chengchi?With such doubts, Mo Ran slightly probed a little of his spirit flow.If No Return was not fake, then there would definitely be some resonance with him. This resonance could not be too obvious, otherwise it would be detected. Just a little bit would be enough \u2026However, just as he released a very weak trace of spirit power, he suddenly heard a slight groan behind him.\"\u2026 Shizun?!\"Mo Ran turned around and saw that Chu Wanning's brows were tightly knitted, his lips were blue, and he had already fallen to the side of the table. His snow-white clothes spread out like smoke, and his handsome face was paler than the snow. His eyelashes were down, and his eyes were tightly closed. It seemed that some chronic illness had flared up, and he had actually fainted at this moment.Mo Ran did not expect such a thing to happen, and could not help but turn pale with fright. He suddenly withdrew the spirit power that he had probed and ran back to Chu Wanning's side, hugging him, \"Shizun, what happened to you?!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOutside the Lingxiang Inn on Linling Island, the Lady Boss was dressed in red and green. Her delicate wrist was adorned with beaded bracelets, and her waist was as slender as a willow tree. She was leaning against the entrance, eating snake gall and fried melon seeds.Every time there was an auction at the Xuanyuan Pavilion, there would always be a large number of people who would come to stay at her place. That was because she was beautiful, intelligent, and knew how to get things done. That pair of beautiful eyes with distinct black and white could easily guess what the guests wanted.At this time, the sun was high in the sky, and it was already past noon. The Lady Boss spat a mouthful of melon seeds. She estimated that the auction would end in another two hours. The price of staying at Linling Island was high, so most cultivators wouldn't stay for long. She wouldn't be able to earn much from the room fees today.However, it didn't matter. Immortals always had to eat dinner before leaving, so she could still earn some money from the meal.The Lady Boss brushed away the crumbs of melon seeds on her skirt. She turned around and shouted to the shop assistant, \"Erfu, wipe the tables and chairs in the lobby again. Also, take out a basket of the snake gall and melon seeds that I fried. Put a plate on each table.We have to prepare for tonight's business. \"\"Yes, Lady Boss, I'll go get it now.\" The shop assistant ran away.The Lady Boss smiled with satisfaction. She had enough sun and melon seeds. Just as she was about to return to the inn to supervise the work, she suddenly saw a black and white figure coming from the end of the road. When he got closer, she realized that he was a handsome black-robed immortal. He was carrying a person in his arms as he rushed into her inn.\"Stay, stay, stay, stay!\"\"\u2026\"It was probably because he came suddenly and his behavior was strange.The shop assistant was shocked. He opened his mouth and couldn't come back to his senses for a long time.Mo Ran said angrily, \"Stay!Are you deaf?Where's the Lady Boss?! \"\"Aiyo, Immortal Lord.\"A young woman's voice sounded behind him. It was 30% joking and 70% apologetic, which made it difficult to get angry. Mo Ran suddenly turned around and saw the Lady Boss's smooth and slick smiling face. \"I'm sorry to have neglected you.I'm a new waiter. If you need me, I'm the Lady Boss. \"Mo Ran raised his dark brows and said anxiously, \"Stay at the hotel!\"The Lady Boss quickly and calmly looked at him. Seeing that this person was wearing a cloak, presumably he was an immortal master who was going to participate in the Xuan Yuan Assembly. However, because he was in a hurry, the hood of his hood had fallen down, revealing a delicate and handsome face of a young man. However, this was not the most important thing. The most important thing was that on his wrist, there was a brocade pouch embroidered with the Black Tortoise totem. It was the Qiankun pouch that the Xuan Yuan Pavilion gave to the customers after they sold the goods.He had money.The Lady Boss's eyes flashed.Very rich.She then looked at the person in his arms. Because of the large veil covering the person's face, and because the person's face was leaning inwards, she couldn't see the person's appearance clearly. However, the Lady Boss's eyes were very sharp. She quickly swept her gaze over the snow-white robe, and her gaze fell on the hand hanging from the wide sleeve.He was tall and thin, his skin was like porcelain, his fingers were long and sharp, and his bones were clearly defined.A beauty.The Lady Boss immediately understood.Although he was a handsome man, it wasn't rare for men to dual cultivate in the cultivation world, so there was nothing strange about it.\"Dafu, get a room.\"The Lady Boss reacted quickly. Without asking anything else, she snapped her fingers and ordered, \"I want the most comfortable room, the Sun and Moon Superior Room.\"Chu Wanning's illness came fiercely without warning.Fortunately, this was Lonemoon's territory, and good medicine was everywhere. Mo Ran invited a doctor to take Chu Wanning's pulse.The doctor, who had a rather high cultivation level, closed his eyes and touched Chu Wanning's wrist with his calloused fingers. He didn't say anything for a long time.Mo Ran couldn't help but ask, \"Doctor, how's my master?\"\"It's not a big problem, but \u2026\"What he hated the most was this kind of person who spoke in a roundabout way.Mo Ran widened his eyes. \"But what?\"\"But this old man feels very strange. Your master's cultivation level is very high, which is rare in the world.But when I examined him just now, his spirit core is very weak. It can't even compare to a small cultivator who has just built his foundation. \"If cultivation was compared to water, the spirit core was the container that carried the water.The spirit core was innate, while cultivation was slowly nurtured. Therefore, the stronger the innate spirit core, the easier it would be for a person to cultivate.However, when one's cultivation level reached a certain level, it would nourish the spirit core. Therefore, generally speaking, the two complemented each other.For a great master like Chu Wanning, his spirit core must be very strong. Therefore, ordinary doctors wouldn't pay special attention to this when taking a pulse.Mo Ran was shocked. \"How is this possible?!\"\"This old man also felt that it was impossible.Therefore, I repeatedly examined him many times, but it was the same every time. \"\"My master's spirit core can't even compare to a foundation building cultivator?How, how is this possible? It's simply a joke!Doctor, please take a closer look. Could it be that you made a mistake somewhere? \"\"This old man has always been cautious in his medical practice. Since I said it, I must be 100% sure.If you don't believe in my master's spirit core, the result will be the same. \"Mo Ran was stunned.The doctor said, \"It's precisely because your master's spirit core is very weak that he should have been sensed by some kind of powerful weapon. That weapon should have some resonance with him, but it's not something he possesses.Therefore, he suffered a backlash. His spirit core couldn't bear it, so he fell unconscious.This old man will prescribe him some medicine. After taking it, he should rest a lot. He'll be fine very soon. \"After sending off the doctor, Mo Ran sat beside Chu Wanning's bed. He held his chin in his hand and stared blankly for a long time.Weak spirit core?How is this possible \u2026However, that old man just now didn't know what happened at the Xuanyuan Club, but he could accurately say that Chu Wanning had encountered a powerful weapon. It really didn't seem like he was lying.In addition, there was also \"No Return\". Just now at the Xuanyuan Club, Mo Ran only released a little bit of spirit energy. Chu Wanning suddenly felt strange and fainted.Therefore, he didn't have time to determine whether that Mo Saber was really the Shen Wu from his previous life.If it was, why would \"No Return\" resonate with Chu Wanning?And why would it cause a backlash to Chu Wanning?As he thought about this, he stared blankly at Chu Wanning. After an unknown amount of time, the person on the bed seemed to be haunted by a nightmare again. His beautiful brows furrowed and his eyelashes couldn't help but tremble.For some strange reason, even he didn't know why. Mo Ran reached out and gently stroked his forehead. \"Master \u2026\"\"\u2026\"\"Master \u2026 Chu Wanning \u2026 I've lived two lives. Could it be that you still have secrets that I don't know?\"The shopkeeper quickly boiled the medicine in the kitchen and served it to Mo Ran.After tasting it, it was indeed very bitter. It was a taste that Chu Wanning hated the most.Mo Ran sighed and called out to the woman who was preparing to leave.\"Shopkeeper, do you have candy?\"\"Sigh \u2026 The store's candy is all freshly boiled. We've already used up all of today's candy.But if Immortal Sage wants some, I'll send someone to buy some on the street. \"Mo Ran looked at the steaming medicine and shook his head. \"Then forget it. The medicine will become cold after a while. It won't have any effect.Thank you very much. \"\"Ah, Immortal Sage, there's no need to be so polite. Just call me if you need anything.\"After the shopkeeper finished speaking, he tactfully left and closed the door behind him.After placing the medicine at the head of the bed, Mo Ran sat back on the edge of the bed. He put one hand on his knee and used the other to help Chu Wanning up. \"Master, it's time to take your medicine.\"Feeding him medicine was something that he was very familiar with in his previous life. Mo Ran picked him up and let Chu Wanning lean against his chest. He took a spoonful of the medicine and brought it to his lips to cool it down. Then, he slowly fed it to Chu Wanning.This was already the second time he was taking care of Chu Wanning after his rebirth. He didn't know why, but even though he hated this person, he still felt nervous when he saw him sick.\"Bitter \u2026\"Although the person in his arms wasn't awake, he was still aware. He frowned in a half-asleep state and turned his face away, refusing to drink anymore.Mo Ran couldn't be more familiar with this action. He raised the spoon and turned him back. Patiently, he coaxed, \"There's still one more mouthful. You'll be fine after drinking it. Come.\"As he spoke, he passed him another spoonful.Chu Wanning drank half of it and coughed. However, his frown deepened.\"So bitter \u2026\"\"It's sweet, it's sweet. The next spoonful is sweet. Come, come, come.\"\"Uh \u2026\"\"The next spoonful!I promise!It's so sweet that you can't believe it!This is the world's sweetest syrup that I ordered people to find! \"As he coaxed him, he didn't even know who he was anymore. Mo Ran smoothly pulled out the words from his previous life. \"It's very delicious. You'll regret it if you don't open your mouth.\"Just like that, he coaxed and coaxed the entire bowl of syrup. When he finished the last spoonful, Mo Ran heaved a sigh of relief. Just as he was about to get up and tidy up, a white shadow suddenly flashed in front of him. Before he could react, his face was firmly slapped.\"Liar, get lost!\"After Chu Wanning said this harshly, he tilted his head and went back to sleep.Mo Ran, who was slapped for no reason at all, was left with his mouth half open. After a while, he covered his face with his hands, feeling wronged.Just as he was about to explode, the person in his arms let out a muffled groan. He must've dreamt of something extremely uncomfortable. His expression became increasingly ugly.Seeing him like this, Mo Ran really didn't have much of a temper. He didn't have any sweets left. Seeing that the Qiankun Bag was still at the head of the bed, he had an idea and took out a bottle of sweet dew.He patted Chu Wanning's cheeks, neither too lightly nor too hard. This was his revenge.\"Lie down alone for a while. I'll go and mix some water for you to drink sweet dew.\"\"\u2026\"Seeing that Chu Wanning was quiet, Mo Ran supported him, intending to let him lie back on the pillow.Unexpectedly, when he got closer, he heard him mutter in a low and muffled voice. Then, he muttered, \"It's \u2026 thin you \u2026\"Mo Ran was stunned. \"What?\"Chu Wanning's eyes were tightly shut. His fan-like eyelashes couldn't stop trembling, as if he was suppressing a great deal of pain. The color of blood faded away bit by bit.He had clearly fallen into another dreamscape, a dreamscape that was even more terrifying and ferocious. He shook his head slightly, and a rare trace of sorrow appeared on his usually cold and noble face.\"It's \u2026 it's me \u2026\"For a moment, Mo Ran suddenly felt his heart stop beating. A strange feeling welled up in his chest. It was as if a secret was right in front of him. He only needed one last layer of gauze to cover it and he would immediately understand it.He couldn't help but stare at Chu Wanning. He whispered, \"It's you what?\"\"It's me \u2026 thin \u2026 you \u2026\"For a moment, his divine sense was in a trance. He didn't know if it was because the candlelight was too dim and made him see wrongly, but Mo Ran saw that Chu Wanning's thick eyelashes seemed to flash with water.It's me who thin you.These four words, when they came out of his mouth, were as light as mist, but when they entered his ears, it was like a clap of thunder.Mo Ran suddenly bounced up from the bed. His entire body froze in an instant!His pupils contracted. He stared at the handsome face of the person on the bed in disbelief. His expression changed in an instant. His heart was shocked as if thousands of horses and thousands of soldiers were galloping past. His hands clenched into fists. His blood seemed to boil into a raging fire overnight and then condensed into ice overnight.\"What did you say?\u2026 You \u2026 \"After being stunned for a long time, Mo Ran suddenly grabbed Chu Wanning's throat. His eyes were ruthless. The childish innocence he pretended to have after his rebirth was completely gone. \"Chu Wanning, what did you just say?\"\"Say it again!Say it again!! \"It's me who thin you. I won't complain even if I die.This was a curse that he would never forget in his life. It was a nightmare that had tormented him for two lifetimes.Many times when he closed his eyes, his ears would be filled with these four words. The person who said it was no longer in this world.But these words were clearly spoken by Chu Wanning in his previous life. Why would he now \u2014 why would he \u2014Could it be that Chu Wanning was also reborn?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis crazy thought caused Mo Ran's eyes to turn blood-red.His entire body trembled as he lost all reason. He gripped Chu Wanning's throat tightly, growling as he continuously interrogated him.As long as he said the second half of the sentence, as long as he said the words \"no regrets in life or death.\"Then it must be \u2026 it must be \u2026\"Ugh!\"A muffled groan sounded by his ear. Chu Wanning couldn't breathe, his face flushed red, and his struggle finally weakened.Mo Ran stared blankly for a moment. His crimson eyes widened, both madness and clarity flickering within. Suddenly, he reacted and hurriedly let go of his hand. Chu Wanning fell heavily back onto the couch, the five terrifying marks on his neck gradually calling back to Mo Ran's soul.\"...\" He opened his mouth. He wanted to call out 'Master', but he couldn't. He wanted to call out 'Chu Wanning', but he couldn't either. After hesitating for a while, he finally managed to croak out, \"You \u2026\"His throat was dry as if it had been burned by fire. Mo Ran swallowed his saliva with difficulty and slowly regained consciousness. Yesterday's events flashed before his eyes. In this life, Chu Wanning had never acted strangely, so he definitely couldn't have been reborn.Then why would he at this moment say those last words from his previous life before he died, \"I am the one who mistreated you.\"Wasn't this a lie that Chu Wanning had no choice but to say to him in order to protect Xue Meng, in order to protect those hypocritical cultivators?He had never believed it, never wanted to believe that Chu Wanning would truly admit his wrongs to him, that he would speak softly to him.In any case, Chu Wanning was definitely lying to him. He definitely didn't like him.In any case, this Shizun had always looked down on him and had never treated him sincerely.He didn't regret killing his Shizun one bit.Not one bit \u2026Mo Ran turned his face away and slowly closed his eyes.He didn't want to stay here for a moment longer. Whether Chu Wanning lived or died, what did it have to do with him?!He turned to leave.He wanted to leave.But no matter what, he couldn't move his feet.I was mean to you.In her memory, that cold and handsome face that was drenched in blood was actually somewhat gentle in the end.Beside the Kunlun Heavenly Lake, the person in the pool of blood slowly raised his hand and touched his forehead with the tip of his finger. His finger was already cold, but there was some warmth in his eyes.But at that time, Mo Ran felt that he must have seen wrongly.Life or death, no regrets.Chu Wanning said softly as tears of blood slowly flowed down from his eyes.\"Mo Ran \u2026\"The person on the bed murmured in his dream. The two soft sounds made the person who was called tremble.By the time he came back to his senses, Mo Ran was already standing by the bed, one hand propped against the bed, leaning over to stare at Chu Wanning's pale face.Her thin, watery lips opened and closed slightly. Another sound entered her ears.\"Mo Ran \u2026\"Closing his eyes, Mo Ran frowned. His fingertips were stuck in the hard, cold rosewood board, as if he was trying to suppress something.In the end, he couldn't help it and said hoarsely, \"Chu Wanning, are you sincere?\"\"Are you sincere about what you said \u2026\"Her chest hurt so much that it felt like it was about to burst. Since Chu Wanning was definitely not reborn, then the only reason he said such words now was because he felt that she didn't treat him well and felt guilty.Was he sincere?Chu Wanning was a dream talker, so naturally, he wouldn't answer him. But Mo Ran still wanted to wait for an answer.\"\u2026\"After waiting for a long time with his eyes closed, there was still no movement. Mo Ran sighed and slowly raised his eyelids with some reluctance.But he was caught off guard and met a pair of hazy phoenix eyes.Half opened and half closed, about to wake up.Chu Wanning opened his eyes at some point, but from his expression, it could be seen that his consciousness was not clear. It was just a temporary awakening from the torment. That pair of night eyes were still empty and absent-minded, as if they were thousands of years old.Wanye Yuheng was usually as sharp as thunder. It was rare for him to be at a loss like this.Without his usual sharpness, the person lying there was actually so beautiful. The corners of his eyes were dyed with a thin layer of red. He just looked at him without any defense.His heart trembled violently. Mo Ran felt his throat tighten. He said in a low voice, \"You \u2026\"This scene was too similar to the scene when he made love with him in his previous life. Mo Ran's thoughts trembled. For a moment, he felt like he was still in the Shaman Palace and Chu Wanning was his prisoner. Just thinking about it made his mouth dry up and his breathing gradually become heavy.I can't \u2026I don't like him.Don't touch him again.The enmity of the past is all in the past.In this life, we are only master and disciple.Mo Ran supported himself with one hand on the bed and looked down at Chu Wanning. He restrained himself and did not cross the line.His long hair that was tied into a ponytail hung down from his shoulders. The ends fell on the other side of the pillow.Chu Wanning lay there with his clothes on. His long hair was scattered. At first, his expression was still numb. After a while, his eyes gradually reflected Mo Ran's reflection. Chu Wanning was slightly startled. Then, as if the nightmare had not disappeared, he still did not know what time it was.He slowly reached out his hand and stopped in midair for a moment. Finally, he touched Mo Ran's forehead.\"I am the one who is mean to you \u2026\"When he said this, it was like in his previous life. It was rare to see such gentleness.Mo Ran only felt a boom. Something in his mind suddenly collapsed.His heart was surging and his head was hot. The spirit that he had summoned with great difficulty collapsed. He did not have time to think about anything. The familiar desire made him bend over Chu Wanning's body and fiercely kiss his slightly opened lips. His trembling hands uncontrollably tore at his clothes.In an instant, the past was like the waves of the sea. Everything around him melted like frost and snow.It was as if he was in the Magi Mountain Palace again. The dragon, phoenix, and red candles were shining brightly. This person under him struggled and scolded, panting and humiliated.\"Ugh \u2026\"Between the hot and wet kisses, Chu Wanning let out a muffled groan that made Mo Ran even more crazy.What dislike? What hatred? What not to touch him again? All of them were shattered into bubbles.Mo Ran only felt that he was not dead yet. The slightly trembling body under him was still his.He wanted to kiss him. He wanted to hug him. He wanted to fiercely tear him apart and penetrate him. He wanted to make this high and cold person beg for mercy under him. He wanted to fuck him until he climaxed.\"Chu Wanning \u2026\" He murmured hoarsely.The exhilarating feeling washed over his soul. Even his fingertips were burning hot.He once again sucked on those slightly cold and soft lips. The bitterness of the medicine still lingered in his mouth, but it made his heart beat like a drum. He was in a daze.He was already too familiar with this person.After his rebirth, because of resentment, he was unwilling to be intimate with him.But when he kissed him, only Mo Ran himself knew that this was a kind of ecstasy. It was like a traveler on the verge of death in the desert tasting sweet dew. It was like an extremely cold night when he wrapped himself in a warm coat over a fire pit.He originally thought that after his rebirth, he would naturally sever ties with him.But unexpectedly, in the end, he was unable to control himself. He was teased by a few words and couldn't control himself. He kissed him without permission.If it weren't for the fact that Chu Wanning's clothes couldn't be torn open and that something had suddenly fallen out of his lapel and pierced Mo Ran, perhaps he would have lost his mind and directly asked for his master without thinking about the consequences.\"Clang clang!\"After piercing Mo Ran's finger and falling on the pillow, the metal rolled twice and stopped moving.Mo Ran was in high spirits. He didn't care about this small injury. He only angrily glared at that thing and then continued to wrestle with Chu Wanning's troublesome clothes.It would have been fine if they hadn't kissed or hugged each other, but once they were on top of each other, all the feelings from his previous life came back. Just the thought of Chu Wanning's slender and tight waist made him feel an irresistible excitement.But the white gauze on Chu Wanning's body seemed to be cursed. He couldn't tear it open even after pulling for a long time.Mo Ran cursed in his heart. He fiercely hit the bed board and got up to take his sword to cut open the waist belt.When he sat up, he glanced at the metal object that had fallen to the side.Mo Ran didn't care about it at first. But suddenly, a trace of clarity flashed through his chaotic mind.He was stunned and suddenly turned back to look at that thing again.It was a brilliant golden orchid butterfly hairpin. When he was in the Peach Blossom Spring, he saved up feathers for several days to buy it for Xia Si Ni.At that time, he personally put the hairpin on top of Xia Si Ni's ponytail and coaxed that unhappy junior brother, saying, \"Children should use gold and red hairpins. Look, it's so lively.\"Mo Ran picked up the hairpin. He felt as if a basin of cold water had been poured over his head.He was completely stunned.No \u2026 What's going on?Why did the thing he gave to Xia Si Ni appear in Chu Wanning's arms?!Could it be \u2026A terrible idea gradually emerged in Mo Ran's mind. He slowly turned back and looked at Chu Wanning with moist and lustful eyes. Master had fainted. Mo Ran stared at his face. Looking at the red lips that were kissed by him, his heart suddenly skipped a few beats.Impossible, absolutely impossible.He felt that he must be crazy \u2026Could it be that Chu Wanning didn't lie to him?Could it be that \u2026 Xia Si Ni \u2014 was really Chu Wanning's son?This guess made Mo Ran shudder. He only felt that his scalp was about to explode!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Chu Wanning woke up, he saw Mo Ran sitting at the table in a daze with his hands on his cheeks. A bean lantern was reflected in his dark eyes, so bright that they seemed hollow.\"\u2026\"He wanted to sit up, but he didn't have the strength. Chu Wanning could only give up.The snow green inscriptions fluttered gently. He turned his body and stared at Mo Ran silently. But that fool was still immersed in himself and didn't notice that his Shizun had woken up.He couldn't be blamed. Anyone who knew that their lover had a son with another woman would be greatly shocked.Was Xia Si really Chu Wanning's illegitimate child?How could this be \u2026 Chu Wanning was so picky, which woman in the world could enter his eyes?Moreover, if the matter of an illegitimate child was true, Chu Wan-ning definitely had this child in her past life. However, they had been together for so many years, and Chu Wan-ning's words and actions had nothing to do with the words' husband 'at all, regardless of whether it was her daily words and actions, or her affairs in bed.But what was going on with this Golden Butterfly hairpin?Mo Ran was so distressed that he knocked his forehead on the table. He was about to go crazy!He wasn't smart to begin with, and he wasn't good at thinking about such complicated things. The more he thought about it, the more his head hurt. In the end, he hugged his head and completely collapsed on the table.\"Mo Ran, what are you doing?\"A deep and pleasant voice rang out in the room. It sounded a little hoarse.Suddenly, Mo Ran jumped up and said in surprise, \"Shizun, you're awake?\"\"Yes,\" Chu Wanning coughed a few times and raised his eyes to look at him, \"This is \u2026 the inn at Lin Ling Yu?\"\"Yes, yes.\"Mo Ran stood up and walked to the bedside. He suddenly saw that Chu Wanning's lower lip seemed to have some scratches. He thought about how he was in a daze and didn't control himself, almost causing a big mistake. His face flushed red.Seeing that he was in a daze, Chu Wanning said, \"What's wrong?\"\"Nothing, nothing.\"Mo Ran waved his hand and changed the topic. \"It's like this. Master suddenly fainted in the Xuanyuan Pavilion, so I carried \u2026 cough, brought you here to rest.I found a doctor to prescribe some medicine, and then \u2026 \"When I heard you talking in your sleep, I thought of the past and couldn't help but kiss you.But how could he say these words? Mo Ran's voice gradually became softer and softer. His eyes were filled with a rare fluster, and he appeared to be more and more embarrassed.Chu Wanning's heart skipped a beat when he heard that Wei Xiaobao was looking for a doctor. He was afraid that Wei Xiaobao already knew that he was poisoned and that his body would shrink.He could not help but quietly tighten his grip on the quilt.\"What did the doctor say?\"\"The doctor said that Master was affected by the Spirit Martial Technique, which is why you couldn't hold on.\" Mo Ran hesitated for a while before continuing, \"Master, your Spirit Core \u2026\"\"It's fine. It's just more fragile than ordinary people.\"Mo Ran was stunned. He originally thought that Chu Wanning and Chu Wanning both had scars on their chests, and guessed that there was some kind of connection between the two. But after hearing what Chu Wanning said, it seemed that this was not the case.He could not help but ask, \"How could this be?Master is so powerful, his Spirit Core must not be weak at birth. When did it start? \"\"A long time ago. Ever since I was injured many years ago, it has always been like this.\"Chu Wanning casually waved his hand. This was not what he was concerned about. \"Did the doctor say anything else?\"Mo Ran shook his head and said, \"Nothing else.\"The candlelight was hazy. Chu Wanning looked at him deeply and said, \"Then why did you hit the table with your head just now?\"\"\u2026\" Mo Ran held back for a while. Since he could not hold it in anymore, he simply threw caution to the wind. He took out the golden butterfly hairpin from his sleeve and spread it in his palm.\"I found this.\"\"\u2026\"\"It's on your body.\"The hairpin shone with a golden light, but Chu Wanning's heart continued to sink.Sure enough, he found out. In the end, he could not hide it.Sighing softly, they were silent for a long time. The two did not speak again.In the end, Chu Wanning closed his eyes. Just as he was about to tell the truth, he heard Mo Ran whisper, \"Master, Xia Shidi \u2026 is he really your son?\"Chu Wanning, \"\u2026\"Opening his eyes, the blood that had just frozen into ice seemed to flow again.For a moment, Chu Wanning only silently stared at Mo Weiyu, who had a complicated expression on his face. His eyes gradually condensed into two clear words, \"Idiot.\"\"Yes.\"Chu Wanning coldly raised his hand. Without waiting for Mo Ran to respond, he took the golden butterfly hairpin away. \"Didn't I tell you before? Why ask again?\"Mo Ran covered his face and said, \"I just \u2026 want to confirm it again \u2026\"Although Chu Wanning admitted that Xia Sini was his flesh and blood several times, Mo Ran was still skeptical. He endured the strong discomfort and secretly made up his mind that when he saw Xia Sini, he would definitely interrogate him properly.If he did not do a blood test for them, he would not believe it even if he died!After a while, Chu Wanning's strength gradually recovered and he could get up from the bed.\"My clothes \u2026\"He touched his lapel and was startled for a moment. He frowned, \"Why is it so messy?\"Mo Ran coughed, \"Cough.\"Afraid that he would remember some fragments of the past, Mo Ran hurriedly changed the topic, \"Master, are you hungry?I heard that this restaurant's dishes are good. The Wensi Tofu is especially delicious. How about we go down and try it?It's my treat. \"Chu Wanning coldly glanced at him, \"Isn't it because I gave you the money?\"Although he said this, he still waved his sleeves and pushed the door open to go downstairs.Linling Yu's dishes were similar to Yangzhou's. They were fresh and chic, and the taste was quite sweet. This was to Chu Wanning's liking.At this time, the Xuanyuan Gathering had already ended, and most of the cultivators had already left.They asked for a private room, so they did not have to deliberately wear a cloak to hide their identities. After the two sat down, the waiter served two cups of Biluochun tea and left after giving them the menu.\"Master, you can take a look first.\"\"You can choose whatever you want. I can eat all the dishes in the Jiangnan area,\" Chu Waning said as she picked up the cup and sipped her tea.However, when the tea touched his lips, he suddenly frowned, \"\u2026\"Mo Ran asked, \"What's wrong?Did you burn yourself? \"\"\u2026 It's fine.Maybe it's because the weather is too dry, the corners of my mouth are a little chapped. \"Chu Wanning said and touched his lips in confusion.Strange, when did it break?\"\u2026\"Mo Ran immediately lowered his head guiltily.After the dishes were all served, Chu Wanning and Mo Ran talked about the Xuanyuan Pavilion. The two left early, and they did not know who the Shenwu Flower would end up in. However, this was not a problem. When the time came, they would go out and ask around.As they chatted, the table was gradually filled with a dazzling array of Yangzhou dishes. Chu Wanning felt that if he continued to ask, he would not get any more information, so he gave up and stopped talking about this.His gaze swept across the table full of bowls, plates, and cups. After a pause, he raised his eyes a few inches and his gaze fell on the face of the young man opposite him who was smiling somewhat nervously.Chu Wanning asked, \"Have you been to Jiangnan before?\"Before Mo Ran was reborn, he had naturally gone to see the apricot flowers and misty rain. However, he did not forget that he was only seventeen and had just entered the peak of life and death for two years. He immediately shook his head, \"I've never been here before.\"Chu Wanning lowered his eyes. His expression was calm, and his voice was clear, \"But you ordered a table full of good dishes.\"\"\u2026!\"When he said this, Mo Ran suddenly realized that he ordered all the dishes according to Chu Wanning's preferences.He originally wanted to let him eat better and recover his strength, but he forgot that he should not know Huaiyang dishes like the back of his hand.\"When I was young, I worked in the back kitchen of the music house. There are many dishes that I have not tasted, but I have heard of them.\"Chu Wanning did not dwell on it, \"Let's eat.\"Jiangnan was filled with water, and Linling Island was filled with crab in a cattail basket, shrimp in a bamboo cage, and fish in willow branches. Therefore, on the square table, there were all kinds of seafood everywhere.Crispy Liang Creek Eel with sauce, sweet and sour Squirrel Mandarin Fish, Pipa Prawns, Chrysanthemum Sea Conch, and Stewed Silver Carp Head were all fragrant.As for fresh vegetables and meat, cold dishes and desserts, they were all exquisitely made and very elegant.Stewed Lion's Head with Crab Powder, Crystal Minced Pork, Chicken Sauce Shredded Cheese, Soup Dumplings, Wensi Tofu, and so on.Mo Ran held his chin and watched the waiter put the last plate of osmanthus cake on the table. Then, he quietly looked at Chu Wanning.He thought, \"I wonder which one will he eat first with so many dishes today?\"After thinking for a while, he secretly made a bet with himself.It must be the Lion's Head with Crab Powder.This was Chu Wanning's favorite Yangzhou dish. As expected, when the dishes were set, his chopsticks went to that side first without any suspense.Mo Ran sighed in his heart. This person is always so easy to guess. Eating and doing things, he is always right \u2026Gulp.A round and cute Lion's Head fell into Mo Ran's bowl.\u2026 Changed?Mo Ran looked up in shock, and a flattered expression gradually appeared on his face, \"Ma, Shizun.\"\"I haven't been feeling well these days. I'll have to trouble you to take care of me.\"Did he hear wrongly??Mo Ran was even more shocked.Chu Wanning actually said to him, \"I'll have to trouble you to take care of me??\"He had never said this sentence in his previous life!Chu Wanning saw the young man's face slowly turn red. His brows relaxed, and his eyes slowly widened. A strand of hair on his forehead stood up and swayed.He couldn't help but feel a little helpless, but he still wanted to save face. Grandmaster Chu took a sip of tea coldly.My lips hurt \u2026In fact, during the days when he became Xia Si Ni and accompanied him, Chu Wanning had already vaguely blamed himself in his heart.When he reflected on it at night, he also felt that he was indeed too harsh. He was even more harsh to Mo Ran.From then on, he told himself that when he regained his original body, he must not do this again. He had to change a little.When Xuanji came to the Peach Blossom Spring, Chu Wanning coughed for a long time and reluctantly asked him how to make his disciple not be so afraid of him.Xuanji was stunned for a moment, then said, \"First of all, you have to show appropriate care to your disciple.\"Show care \u2026Chu Wanning thought that Mo Ran might have never eaten crab meat lion's head, so he lightly opened his mouth and said, \"Stew crab meat lion's head. Chop the pork belly finely, and add shrimp roe, crab meat, and crab roe, and make them round.Pinch the meat lion's head and simmer it in the clear soup. Add the green vegetables floating in the soup and put it in a red clay pot. The color is very good. \"\"\u2026\"Mo Ran was stunned.Why did he have to memorize the recipe?However, Chu Wanning felt that he was patiently introducing the dishes, and that it was a kind of care for his disciple. Thus, during the meal, Mo Ran tasted all the dishes one by one, and even listened to a bunch of dishes that sounded like they were memorized from \"Jianghuai Food Chronicles\".If it wasn't for Chu Wanning's cold and pleasant voice, Mo Ran would have flipped the table and left.\"Hey, did you hear?Xuanyuan Pavilion's last auction item was bought by someone from Linyi Confucian Wind Sect! \"The private rooms were separated by bamboo curtains, so the voice of the person next to them was slightly louder. Without any hindrance, Mo Ran and the others heard it clearly.Chu Wanning suddenly stopped his introduction of the \"Crystal Pork Dish\" and looked at Mo Ran, listening attentively.A boorish man spoke, \"Why haven't I heard?Is it the Divine Weapon?The price of three hundred million gold was paid on the spot.Aiyo, it's really a sky-high price, I've never seen so much money in my life. \"\"Look at you, don't you know that other than the Divine Weapon, the Confucian Wind Sect also spent fifty million to buy the Butterfly Bone Beauty Seat!\"\"Heavens, isn't the Butterfly Bone Beauty Seat used to eat raw or dual cultivate?The number one sect in the world is actually doing such a despicable act of cultivation. This is too outrageous! \"\"Brother Su is wrong, the Butterfly Bone Beauty Seat is a reasonable cultivation method, it's not a forbidden technique.Although the Beauty Seat looks similar to us, it's not a mortal in the end.It's like eating an immortal fruit to help one's cultivation, there's nothing to criticize. \"\"Humph, forgive me for not agreeing \u2026\"Another person chuckled, \"The one who bought the Beauty Seat seems to be a reclusive young disciple of the Confucian Wind Sect, called Ye something Xi.I heard that he looks quite decent, but I didn't expect him to be the kind of person who relies on sleeping with women to increase his cultivation.I think the Confucian Wind Sect is also at dusk. \"Someone next to them chuckled, \"What's wrong with that, everyone has a heart for beauty.\"The people next to them began to argue about ethics and morality, it wasn't worth listening to.Chu Wanning softly repeated, \"The Divine Weapon was bought by the Confucian Wind Sect?\"\"It sounds that way.\"Chu Wanning couldn't help but reveal a worried expression, \"That's difficult.If this matter is traced, we'll have to go to the Confucian Wind Sect to investigate \u2026 \"As soon as he said this, Mo Ran remembered and softly said, \"Master was originally from the Confucian Wind Sect.\"\"Yes.\"\"You don't want to go back?\"At the mention of returning to the Confucian Wind Sect, Chu Wanning's expression became weary, his eyebrows twitching as he said, \"Although this sect is a famous sect in the upper cultivation world, I once \u2026\"Halfway through his words, a clamor suddenly came from the hall. Someone shouted, \"Lady Boss, I'll give you five hundred gold, immediately clear the place and drive these guests out!Today, our Young Lord wants to book the whole place! \"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Lady Boss's voice could be heard with an obsequious smile, \"Oh my, Master Daoist is so generous, giving you five hundred taels of gold. You really make me happy.But since we're doing business, we need to be polite.How can we drive other customers away?How about this, the largest private room in the Returning Fog Pavilion is specially reserved for generous guests like Master Daoist.I'll show you the way \u2014 \"Before she could finish her sentence, the sound of benches, tables, and chairs being smashed could be heard from below.\"What are you looking at?I don't care if you're the Returning Fog Pavilion or the Turtle Pavilion \u2014 Damn it, this name is such a waste.No, no, I'll give you a thousand taels of gold to drive them away! \"\"Master Daoist, please don't give me a hard time. Look, you'll see that I'm a knowledgeable scholar.\"The Lady Boss lied without hesitation. She laughed and said, \"You're a customer here. If you're not satisfied with the Returning Fog Pavilion, I can give you another one. It's smaller, but elegant and beautiful. I'll also give you a song and dance for free. What do you think?\"\"Not good!Not good!A thousand five hundred taels!Tell them to scram! \"The rough voice roared,\" Don't dilly-dally!My Young Master will be angry when he comes! \"\"Wow \u2014\" A thousand taels of gold might be a lot for others, but for Mo Ran, who was once the Sovereign Emperor of the Human Realm, it was really funny when he heard it.In his previous life, he casually gave Song Qiutong some treasures to play with, and those were all priceless treasures.Therefore, he bit his chopsticks and rolled his eyes. He whispered to Chu Wanning with a smile, \"Master, Master, listen to this person. He wants to drive us away for a thousand five hundred taels.\"Chu Wanning glanced at him, then lifted the bamboo curtain of the private room and looked downstairs.The dining hall was crowded with a large group of people. Although they were wearing ordinary clothes, and it was impossible to tell which sect they belonged to, each of them had a cold and piercingly cold high-grade treasured saber on their waists. Each of them was leading a demon wolf with saliva dripping from the corners of its mouth.It might not be easy to judge the value of the treasured saber, but this demon wolf was priceless. It was not easy for an ordinary small cultivation sect to get one, but each of them had one. Obviously, they were from an extremely prominent family.The guests who had been eating looked at these people in horror, and the hall was silent for a moment.Suddenly, a snow-white light flew into the inn. When everyone saw it clearly, they were stunned at first. Then, with a boom, they all shrank back. Some of the more timid ones even screamed, \"A Great Demon, a Great Demon!\"The one that jumped in was a snow-white wolf demon that was as tall as three people. Its eyes were as red as blood, and its fur was as bright as silk. It had a pair of wolf fangs that were as long as an adult man's arm.However, on the huge body of this ferocious beast, there was a handsome young man with arrogant eyes sitting leisurely with his legs crossed. The young man's hunting armor was biting cold. Under the armor was a bright red robe, and the cuffs were embroidered with neat golden threads. He wore a hood, and a cluster of soft red tassels hung from the top of the silver lion holding the sun. A jasper bow lay on his knees, which should be his weapon.When those arrogant cultivators saw him, they immediately knelt on one knee, hammered their chests with their hands, and said in unison, \"Welcome, Young Master!\"\"Okay.\"The young man waved his hand impatiently. \"I asked you to do something, so why are you hesitating? Welcome, welcome your dog head!\"\"Pfft.\"Mo Ran laughed and whispered to Chu Wanning, \"He said they welcome the dog head, so doesn't that make him a dog head himself?\"\"\u2026\"The young man sat on the soft neck of the demon wolf with a sullen expression. \"Where is the shopkeeper of this shabby inn?Who is he? \"Although the Lady Boss was scared, she still forced herself to calm down and walked forward. She smiled apologetically and said, \"I'm an insult to Immortal Monarch. The shopkeeper of this small inn is me.\"\"Oh.\" The young man glanced at her. \"I want to stay in an inn, but I'm not used to too many people talking.You tell them that I'll pay for the loss. \"\"But Immortal Monarch \u2026\"\"I know you're in a difficult position. This is for you. Apologize for me.If you really don't want to, then forget it. \"The young man threw a brocade pouch to the Lady Boss. When she opened it, there was a pile of golden Nine Turns Origin Pills.These pills could greatly increase one's cultivation within ten days. One pill on the market cost more than two thousand gold coins. The Lady Boss took it. At first, her expression changed because of the other party's generosity, but then she quietly sighed in relief.No cultivator would refuse such a good thing. It was reasonable to ask him to leave like this.The Lady Boss apologized one by one and gave the gifts. The young man yawned and looked down at the group of followers with disdain. He said, \"You're all trash. You still need me to do it personally.\"They looked at each other and said, \"\u2026 Young Master is wise. Young Master is mighty.\"The crowd quickly dispersed. Except for Chu Wanning and Mo Ran, who didn't care about money and pills, the others took their things and left the inn without any complaints. They went to other inns to stay.The Lady Boss said, \"Young Master, they've all left. But two guests said that it's late. One of them is unwell and doesn't want to go elsewhere. You see \u2026\"\"Forget it, forget it. I won't argue with a sickly person.\" The young man waved his hand happily. \"Just don't disturb me.\"The sickly person Chu Wanning was speechless.The Lady Boss immediately smiled and said warmly, \"Young Master is really a kind person.It's late now. Do you want to rest or eat something first? \"The young man said, \"I'm hungry.I don't want to rest. I want to eat. \"\"If Young Master wants to eat, then this inn will definitely serve the best dishes. Our chef is best at making crab meats, lion's head, crystal meat \u2026\"\"Lion's head to vent your anger?\"The young man was obviously not a southerner and didn't like southern food. Hearing the name of the dish, he was stunned for a moment. Then he frowned and waved his hand. \"No, I don't understand.What's all this nonsense? \"He originally thought that he was a son of an aristocratic family, but now it seemed that he might be a rich merchant.The Lady Boss said, \"\u2026 Then what do you want to eat? As long as this inn knows how, we can make it.\"\"Well said.\"The young man pointed at his followers. \"Cut five jin of beef for each of them. Also, give me ten jin of beef, one jin of wine, and two lamb legs. That's about it. It's too late to eat too much. Just a little to fill your stomach.\"Mo Ran, \"Wow \u2026\"He wanted to turn around and laugh at this young man's bucket-like appetite with his master, but he saw that Chu Wanning was staring at the young man. There seemed to be some unfathomable mist in his eyes.Mo Ran subconsciously asked, \"Master seems to know him?\"\"Yes.\"He originally just asked casually, but he didn't expect that Chu Wanning really did know him. He couldn't help but ask in surprise, \"What?Then, then who is he? \"\"The only son of the Confucian Wind Sect's Sect Master.\" Chu Wanning softly said, \"Nangong Si.\"\"\u2026\" Mo Ran thought to himself. No wonder Chu Wanning knew him. After all, Chu Wanning was a guest elder of the Confucian Wind Sect in Linyi. He must have seen the Sect Master's son before.It was also no wonder that he didn't know him. In his previous life, when he massacred the Confucian Wind Sect, this Nangong Si had already died of an illness.At that time, he thought that the Sect Master's son was a half-cripple. He didn't expect that when he saw him today, he would actually be such a lively, healthy, and arrogant young man.\u2026 How did he die of an illness?Was it a sudden illness?Nangong Si ate happily downstairs. In a short while, he devoured two lamb legs and ten kilograms of beef like a whirlwind sweeping away clouds. He also drank several bowls of wine. Mo Ran was speechless as he watched from upstairs.\"Master, isn't the Confucian Wind Sect the most cultured?What's wrong with this young master?He looks even worse than our Xue Mengmeng. \"Chu Wanning pushed his head back as he leaned over. His face was still tilted as he looked at the scene below. \"Don't randomly give your fellow disciples nicknames.\"Mo Ran chuckled twice. Just as he was about to say something, Chu Wanning tapped his head with the tip of his finger, and a fluttering sleeve fell on his face. The cloth was light, like silk but not silk, like satin but not satin. It was cool to the touch like water.He couldn't help but think of something and stare blankly for a moment.Just now in the room, he pulled on Chu Wanning's clothes in a daze. After tugging for a long time, he couldn't tear them off. He thought that Chu Wanning was wearing tight clothes.But now that he looked carefully at the material of the clothes, Mo Ran suddenly recognized that it was the \"Icy Mist Silk\" produced by the Kunlun Treading Snow Palace.The Kunlun Treading Snow Palace was the most aloof and reclusive sect among the immortals in the Upper Cultivation World. All its disciples entered the sect at the age of five. After a year, they had to enter the Kunlun Holy Land to cultivate in seclusion. They could only come out when they formed their own spiritual nucleus.Although the spiritual nucleus came with them, the cultivation was just to summon it out.But this time was very long, usually ten to fifteen years. During this time, unrelated people were not allowed to enter.Therefore, the disciples' food and clothing became troublesome. The food was still okay because the Kunlun Holy Land was adjacent to the Wangmu Lake. The disciples of the Treading Snow Palace could go into the lake to catch food every day, but they couldn't weave their own clothes, right?Therefore, the \"Icy Mist Silk\" was born.The clothes made from this silk were not only as soft as smoke, but also had a dust-repelling spell attached to them. They would not be contaminated by dust. Unless they were splashed with stains like blood, they did not need to be washed.But the most amazing thing was that the \"Icy Mist Silk\" would change according to the body shape of its owner. This was indispensable for the disciples of the Treading Snow Palace. They entered the Forbidden Land at the age of five and could only come out at the age of fifteen or twenty. During this long time, from a child to a tall and handsome young man, the clothes made of the Icy Mist Silk could grow with them, avoiding the embarrassment of not fitting the clothes.\u2014 But why would Chu Wanning wear clothes made of this material?Mo Ran narrowed his eyes. Suddenly, a spark lit up in his mind. He suddenly felt that something was wrong. It seemed that he had thought of something wrong from the beginning. What was it \u2026\"Sorry to disturb you. May I ask where the shopkeeper is?\"A youthful voice full of energy, but it was very kind and polite, suddenly interrupted Mo Ran's thoughts.Looking down, it was the group of disciples of the Confucian Wind Sect who had appeared at the Xuanyuan Pavilion earlier in the day. Their leader, He Zuo, was holding a sword. The hilt of his sword lifted the curtain and half of his body poked in.\"Aren't they Ye Wangxi's followers?\" Mo Ran immediately became spirited.The Confucian Wind Sect had seventy-two cities, and the disciples usually did not know each other.As for Nangong Si, he was sitting alone in a private room with his back to the door. Thus, when the group of youths swept their eyes over the disciples in the inn, they did not recognize this familiar face.Ye Wangxi versus Nangong Si, this was going to be a good show.\"I'm really sorry. Tonight, our inn has been booked.\"The Lady Boss hurriedly went over to greet them while secretly cursing herself for forgetting to lock the door. \"Immortal Monarchs, please go to another inn to have a look. I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.\"The youth in the lead revealed an awkward expression. \"Ai, how could this be?I just went to look at the other inns, and they were all filled with people.We have a thin and weak girl here. She hasn't rested for a long time, so we want to find a better place for her to sleep.Innkeeper, I'll have to trouble you to ask the uncle who booked the inn whether or not he can give up a few rooms. \"\"This \u2026 I'm afraid he won't be willing.\"The youth bowed and courteously pleaded, \"Lady Boss, please go and ask him. If he isn't willing, then forget it.\"Before the Lady Boss could say anything, one of the followers of Nangong Si at the table near the door suddenly slammed the table and stood up. He angrily said, \"What's there to ask!Get out, get out!Don't disturb our young master's meal! \"\"That's right!You're wearing the clothes of the Confucian Wind Sect, yet you have the nerve to sleep with a girl. Don't you think you're shaming your sect? \"The youth didn't expect that they would misunderstand. In a flash, his face turned red and he angrily said, \"Fellow Daoist, why are you slandering others?My Confucian Wind Sect is upright and upright, so we naturally wouldn't do such a thing. This girl was saved by my Young Master out of kindness, so how can you speak such nonsense? \"\"Your Young Master?\"Nangong Si's attendant glanced at the private room and saw that the young master was still casually drinking his wine, seemingly tacitly agreeing to his actions of chasing people away. Thus, he relaxed and raised his voice to sneer, \"Everyone knows that there is only one Young Master in the Confucian Wind Sect, so who is the one in your house?\"\"This humble one is Ye Wangxi of the Confucian Wind Sect.\" A gentle and elegant voice came from outside the door.The youths all turned their heads. \"Young Master Ye.\"Ye Wangxi was dressed in black, and his handsome face seemed more delicate and pretty under the candlelight. He walked into the inn with his hands behind his back. Behind him was a woman wearing a veil, revealing a pair of anxious and gentle eyes. It was Song Qiutong.\"\u2026\" When Mo Ran saw her, the veins on his forehead suddenly jumped.Enemies on a narrow road, how could it be her again \u2026When Nangong Si's followers saw that the person who came was actually Ye Wangxi, they were all stunned at first, but then a few of them lost their cool and revealed looks of disgust.Ye Wangxi was the adopted son of the Confucian Wind Sect's First Elder and belonged to one of the Confucian Wind Sect's 72 cities, \"Dark City\".As the name implied, Dark City was good at nurturing shadow guards. The Sect Leader of the Confucian Wind Sect had originally trained him to be the next leader of the shadow guards, but because Ye Wangxi's foundation was not suitable for the shadow guard cultivation method, he gradually transferred to the main city and became the High Lord's right-hand man.Because Ye Wangxi was a shadow guard in his early years, he acted in a low-key manner, so very few people knew his name.However, the High Lord regarded him very highly. In these years, there were even rumors that Ye Wangxi was the High Lord's illegitimate son.Perhaps because of this reason, the real Young Master Nangong Si had always been at odds with Ye Wangxi.The Young Master did not like him, so how could his followers have a good impression of Young Master Ye?Originally, as juniors, they absolutely could not offend Young Master Ye, but this group of people were all Nangong Si's trusted aides and directly received orders from Nangong Si. Thus, the atmosphere was stiff for a long time. Finally, there was a rough person who sneered and said, \"Young Master Ye, please go back. I'm afraid there is no room for you in this inn today.\"\"Young Master, since they said there is no room, then, then let's find another place.\"Song Qiutong stretched out her slender fingers and pulled on Ye Wangxi's clothes. She said in a panic, \"Besides, this place is very expensive. I really don't dare to ask Young Master to spend more money \u2026\"Mo Ran heard these two sentences from upstairs and rolled his eyes. He thought to himself, This guy really has this weak and pitiful tone wherever he goes. First, he tricked me, and now he's tricking Ye Wangxi.Just as Ye Wangxi was about to speak, a huge white shadow suddenly rushed out from inside and attacked Ye Wangxi from behind.Song Qiutong cried out in alarm, \"Be careful, Young Master!!\"\"Aowuuu!Wu wu wu!! \"Following a loud and clear howl, a snow-white demon wolf sprinted madly, circling around Ye Wangxi crazily.\"\u2026\"Everyone was silent.Ye Wangxi lowered his eyes and looked at the white-furred demon wolf that was as tall as three people, but was currently sticking to the ground and rolling around. He said in astonishment, \"Naobaijin?\"This demon wolf was Nangong Si's mount. Because its eyes were as red as agate, its fur was as white as snow, and its claws had a touch of gold, it was named Naobaijin.Since Naobaijin was here, Nangong Si must have come as well.Ye Wangxi raised his hand and patted Naobaijin's head. He looked around.Sha \u2014 \u2014The bamboo curtain was pulled aside by a hand. The sleeves were bright red, and there was even a golden thread wrapped around the edges.Half of his impatient face was revealed. Nangong Si had his arms crossed and was leisurely leaning against the side of the room. In his hand was a pot of soju wine. He glanced at Ye Wangxi and sneered, \"Interesting. Why do I run into you everywhere I go?You're following me so closely. If we provoke others to gossip about us, where will I put my face? \"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After a while, he said, \"You're mistaken.I don't want to follow you, but I was ordered by the Lord to come to Xuan Yuan Pavilion to buy something back. \"When Mo Ran and Chu Wanning heard this, they looked at each other.\u2014 \u2014 Shen Wu.Nangong Si shook the red clay wine pot in his hand, his expression gloomy. \"Father wants to buy something, why bother you?Do you think I don't know how to do it for him? \"\"\u2026 Ah Si, that's not what I meant.\"\"Who told you to call me that?\"Nangong Si lowered his eyebrows, his eyes like lightning. \"Young Master Ye, don't think that you can be so unbridled in front of me just because Father was blind to get close to you \u2026 Don't you feel disgusted?\"\"I called you that because the Lord wanted me to.If you feel disgusted, you can tell him yourself. \"Ye Wangxi was silent for a while, then said,\" What's the use of getting angry at me? \"\"Don't use Father to pressure me!\"Nangong Si took a deep breath, slightly restraining his anger. His black eyes were extremely cold, just like the silver moon hanging high in the sky, filled with smoke.\"Young Master Ye.\"He seemed to deliberately drag out these three words. \"Father told you to call me Ah Si, but I'm afraid he misunderstood your position in the sect, but you should know your place.Don't open a dye shop just because I gave you three colors. You have to know, even if you dye yourself red and purple, born here, you can't stand shoulder to shoulder with me. \"Ye Wangxi's gentlemanly face seemed to flash with a trace of dullness. His thick eyelashes drooped down, and he quietly said, \"Young Master is right, but this Ye \u2026 has never thought of standing shoulder to shoulder with Young Master.\"The change in title made Nangong Si feel slightly more comfortable. He raised his hand and gulped down a few mouthfuls of spicy soju, but he didn't get drunk. He then stared at Ye Wangxi for a while, snorted through his nose, and waved his hand, \"Even if I did, you wouldn't dare. Look at you right now, how can you be \u2026\"He suddenly realized that there were too many people here, and he almost said something he shouldn't have said. He suddenly pursed his lips, no longer speaking.\"\u2026\"On the other hand, Ye Wangxi, even if he suffered such humiliation, he still lowered his eyes, so no one could see whether it was anger or humiliation. He only gave everyone a calm and gentle face, thirty percent heroic spirit, seventy percent reserved...The atmosphere was awkward to the extreme.Nangong Si awkwardly looked left and right for a while before his gaze landed on the woman behind Ye Wangxi. As if to cover up the mistake he almost made, he coughed and raised his chin at the woman, asking Ye Wangxi, \"You saved her?\"\"Yes.\"\"Where is she from?Don't randomly save someone whose origin is unknown. \"\"It's okay, Xuan Yuan Pavilion bought it.\"Nangong Si didn't care about the Xuan Yuan Pavilion's bidding, so he didn't bother to inquire. But when he heard that Song Qiutong was bought, he couldn't help but be surprised.His originally lazy and perfunctory eyes suddenly sharpened, and he stared at Song Qiutong's face. After a while, he said, \"Is this an enslavement bone, or a butterfly bone beauty seat?\"In the Xiuzhen Continent, there were only two kinds of people who could be sold openly. In addition to the butterfly bone beauty seat, the other was the enslavement bone.The enslavement bone was the child of a human and a demon. Because people were afraid of the demon nature of this race, once it was detected, their Zhenqi would be destroyed, and their shoulder blades would be marked with a slave curse, making them servants.However, the price of enslavement bone wasn't high, and there was nothing rare about it. Generally, it was used to serve tea to the big sects, or bought by rich merchants to play with.Since it was sold by the Xuan Yuan Pavilion, it shouldn't be this kind of thing.Sure enough, Ye Wangxi said, \"It's a butterfly bone beauty seat.\"Nangong Si became interested. He bypassed Ye Wangxi, walked in front of Song Qiutong, and looked at her in a circle. Then, he frowned and said, \"Why is this thing lame?Is it defective? \"\"\u2026 She was injured when she was caught. She applied medicine, but it hasn't fully healed yet.\" Ye Wangxi paused. \"So we can't go far. We want to stay here for the night.\"Nangong Si didn't comment. He narrowed his eyes and suddenly moved close to Song Qiutong's neck and sniffed. His action was very similar to that of an untamed wolf.Song Qiutong was frightened by his lecherous action, and her face turned pale. She clutched her lapel and swayed.\"It doesn't smell any different from an ordinary person.\" He rubbed his nose and sneezed. \"There's also the fragrance of rouge \u2026\"Nangong Si waved his hand and casually asked, \"How much?\"\"Fifty million.\"\"Silver?\"\"Gold.\"Nangong Si suddenly opened his eyes wide. \"Ye Wangxi, are you crazy?Do you know how many top-grade whetstones you can refine with fifty million gold?You fucking bought a woman for me?Do you think my Confucian Wind Sect's money isn't money? \"\"I didn't spend the sect's money.\" Ye Wangxi paused for a moment and then said, \"I didn't buy it for you.\"\"You \u2014!\" Nangong Si's anger that had just subsided rose again. His expression changed. \"You're very good!\"He turned his head and glared at Song Qiutong. The more he stared, the more he found her to be pleasing to the eye. Especially the veil that covered her face. No matter how he looked at it, he was annoyed. He immediately ordered, \"You, take off that rag on your face!\"Song Qiutong was frightened. She tightly grabbed Ye Wangxi's sleeve and shrunk behind him. Her voice was extremely pitiful. \"Young Master Ye, I \u2026 I don't want to \u2026\"Ye Wangxi's slender figure was not as sturdy and tall as Nangong Si, but when he slightly raised his head and looked at Nangong Si, he was fearless. \"Since she doesn't want to, Young Master shouldn't force her.\"\"Stop nagging. She was saved by you, so she owes my Confucian Wind Sect a life. She must listen to me.Take it off! \"\"She was saved by me. From the moment I saved her, I returned her freedom.\" Ye Wangxi said, \"Young Master, please don't force her.\"\"Ye Wangxi!You're such a good person! \"Nangong Si was so angry that he banged on the door frame.\" What do you take me for?Today, I'm going to fight with you. If I say that I want her to take it off, then I want her to take it off. If she takes off her veil, then I'll let you stay here. If she doesn't take it off, then fuck off! \"Ye Wangxi almost imperceptibly sighed. He turned to Qiutong and said, \"Let's go.\"This time, Nangong Si wasn't the only one who was choked. Ye Wangxi had Shen Wu on him. No matter what, they couldn't just let him leave like this. Chu Wanning immediately said, \"Go stop him.\"\"Okay, okay, okay.\"Mo Ran also had the same intention, but after a long time, he suddenly froze. \"Shizun, if we stop him, where will he stay? He wants to stay in the inn to rest.\"\"Give him half of our room.\"\"\u2026 Uh.\" Mo Ran didn't know why, but his expression suddenly became somewhat awkward. \"I'm afraid that's a bit inappropriate.\"Chu Wanning slightly raised his eyelids. \"What's wrong?\"\"Shizun may not know, but it's best that the two of us don't stay in the same room as him. Moreover, he won't agree to it. Because this Ye Wangxi, he's actually a \u2026\"Just as they reached the critical point, they suddenly heard Nangong Si kick over a table. Cups, bowls, and plates fell to the ground. Then, he suddenly pulled over a stool and placed his leg on it. He angrily said, \"Who allowed you to leave as you please?!I think you've gone against the heavens!Get your ass back here! \"\"\u2026\" This time, even Nangong Si's personal attendants had somewhat awkward expressions on their faces.Wasn't this \u2026 Young Master, you wanted him to hurry and get lost?Ye Wangxi seemed to have long been used to Nangong Si's unreasonable tantrums. He planned to pretend that he didn't hear his roar. He patted Qiutong's shoulder, indicating that she shouldn't pay attention to the crazy person behind them.\"Ye Wangxi!\"\"\u2026\"\"Ye Wangxi!!\"\"\u2026\"\"Ye \u2014 \u2014 Wang \u2014 \u2014 Xi!!!\"The veins on Ye Wangxi's forehead couldn't help but throb twice. He finally couldn't help but turn around. Unexpectedly, he was met with a wine flask. His pupils suddenly shrank. Ye Wangxi was just about to dodge when suddenly, a white figure flashed in front of him.\"Ah \u2014 \u2014!\"A delicate cry of pain shocked everyone present. Ye Wangxi and Nangong Si's expressions changed even more.It turned out that in a flash, it was Song Qiutong who blocked in front of Ye Wangxi. That heavy red clay wine flask had ruthlessly smashed into her forehead. In an instant, blood flowed out. Her pair of lustrous white jade hands trembled as she touched the blood. Immediately, tears fell from her eyes from the pain.\"Don't touch, let me see your injury.\"\"I'm fine. It's fine as long as I didn't hurt Young Master \u2026\"\"If you want to speak, then speak. Why did you throw a bottle?\"Ye Wangxi's tone was scorching. He looked at Nangong Si reproachfully, then said to his attendant, \"Bring me the Jinchuang Ointment.\"\"Young Master, the Jinchuang Ointment that we brought is all used up.\" That attendant said softly, \"How about I run out and buy some more?\"Nangong Si also didn't expect this to happen. Although he forced himself to remain calm, his eyes still revealed a trace of regret.With a straight face, he stammered, \"I, I have some here.\u2026 \u2026 Ah Lan, bring me my medicine pouch. \"Ye Wangxi was a little angry. He pursed his lips and ignored him.Holding the small medicine bottle, Nangong Si froze in place for a long time. Seeing that Ye Wangxi didn't turn around to look at him, Nangong Si couldn't bear to lose face. He simply shoved the medicine bottle to Song Qiutong, \"It's for you. Use it or leave it.\"Song Qiutong was like a little deer that had lost its head out of fear. She first looked towards Ye Wangxi with trembling eyes. Seeing that he didn't stop her and only remained silent, she finally put away the Jinchuang Ointment like she was trying to keep the peace. She even lowered her head towards the person who had injured her and said softly, \"Thank you, Nangong gongzi.\"Nangong Si was stunned. He didn't expect that the girl he almost played with would actually thank him. Then, he waved his hand and awkwardly coughed, \"It's fine.\"That night, Ye Wangxi and his group finally decided to stay the night.In an inn, several candles flickered, and the stars were in chaos.Mo Ran sat by the window with his chin resting on his hands. He seemed a little absent-minded.It had been nearly two years since his rebirth. The progress of many things was very different from the progress of his previous life. Seeing the same people doing different things was always a little subtle.Song Qiutong, Ye Wangxi, No Return \u2026These people and things that he couldn't have been more familiar with in his previous life all appeared once again in his life as time passed.However, in this life, he would never take Song Qiutong as his wife again. As for Ye Wangxi, this person would soon become famous all over the world. He would become the second most powerful expert in the Cultivation World after Chu Wanning.There was also No Return.Thinking of this Mo Saber that had accompanied him in his previous life, his heart was restless.\"Shizun.\"\"What's the matter?\"\"You've already been drawing this talisman for an hour. Why haven't you finished yet?\"\"It's done.\"As Chu Wanning spoke, he carefully dipped the tip of his brush in cinnabar and made the last few strokes with the help of a lantern. An extremely complicated dragon appeared on the paper.Mo Ran leaned over to take a look.\"What is this?\"\"Rising Dragon Barrier,\" Chu Wanning said.\"What does it do?\"\"It can see all the traces of spells in the surroundings, big or small.If that mysterious person wants to test the essence of the Spirit Root with the Divine Martial Skill, he must leave a mark on the weapon.Whether the appearance of this weapon is a coincidence or his careful design, we'll know immediately. \"\"Wow, why didn't Shizun use such a good thing in the Xuanyuan Pavilion?\"\"\u2026 I'll awaken the Rising Dragon Barrier. You'll understand when you see it.\"Chu Wanning pierced his fingertip and wiped one of the dragon scales. The little yellow dragon on the paper instantly overflowed with golden light, and its eyes and tail began to move flexibly.Chu Wanning said, \"Are you a True Dragon?\"A shrill voice rang out from the paper, \"That's right, that's right. I'm the True Dragon.\"\"Why do you say that?\"\"Stupid mortal!Why don't you believe me! \"\"If you can jump out of the paper, I'll recognize you as a True Dragon.\"\"What's so difficult about that!Just you wait for this Seat!Heh! \"A golden light flashed, and a mighty little dragon the size of a palm suddenly jumped out of the paper. It shook its head and wagged its tail, bared its fangs and brandished its claws, and proudly flew around Chu Wanning. It made a ruckus and said, \"Hahaha, hahaha, I'm a big True Dragon, a big True Dragon, I have many little secrets, little secrets.I have many secrets, but I won't tell you, won't tell, won't tell, won't tell, won't tell, tell, you! \"Chu Wanning used his clear eyes to coldly glance at the little loach. He covered it with his hand and expressionlessly said to Mo Ran, \"Do you understand?\"\"I understand \u2026 \u2026\"\"Let go of me!You stupid mortal!You're messing with my whiskers! \"Chu Wanning raised his hand and rudely tapped its reverse scale, the one that was stained with blood. \"Shut up and get to work.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe little dragon came and went like the wind. In just a few minutes, it came back from the window and shouted, \"I found it, I found it. There are many traces of magic in this inn, wahahaha.\"\"Little loach, why are you shouting so loudly? Are you afraid that the people next door can't hear what you're saying?\"Mo Ran leaned on the table and touched the little dragon's body with his fingers. The dragon swung its tail and hit the back of his hand. However, it was made of paper after all. Not only did it not hurt, it even tickled.\"You annoying gigolo, don't touch me. I'm not married yet. If I let you touch me for no reason, how can I be a dragon in the future?\"Mo Ran laughed and said, \"What? What?You're a dragon made of paper and you want to get married? \"\"Wah-!Pooh pooh pooh!You're the one made of paper!You dog! \"\"Why are you calling me a dog too? Don't tell me your surname is Xue?\"\"My surname is Xue?Humph, you're stupid. I'm the famous Aurogon who created the world. When I open my eyes, it's the sun. When I close my eyes, it's the night. When I exhale, it's summer. When I inhale, it's winter.I don't change my surname, I'm the Candle Dragon! \"\"\u2026 I don't understand.\"\"Wahahaha!\"The little dragon was so angry that it kept spinning around. It used its two-finger-wide head to hit the candlestick. It hit the candlestick and red tears swayed.Mo Ran quickly went to help it. However, when he reached out his hand, it was bitten by the little dragon. Unfortunately, the paper teeth didn't hurt or itch. Mo Ran pulled the Candle Dragon's tail and threw it aside. It was in the air and stuck to Chu Wanning's collar. It was listless.\"Chu Wanning.\"The little dragon raised a whisker and weakly poked Chu Wanning's clothes. \"That bastard hit me.\"Chu Wanning was too lazy to talk nonsense with it. He pulled it down and casually slapped it on the table, \"What kind of enchantments are there outside?\"\"Humph, do you dare to call me Dragon Prince three times?If you call me that, I'll \u2026 \"Chu Wanning stared at it coldly, \"Speak.\"\"\u2026\"After being insulted, the little dragon was so angry that its body swelled and its dragon whiskers soared into the sky. Its pair of mung bean like eyes glared at Chu Wanning in anger. Its noble dragon mouth was also half open as it panted heavily. After a while, it actually spat out a large mouthful of ink.Chu Wanning narrowed his eyes. \"If you waste any more ink, I'll burn you.\"As he spoke, he grabbed its tail and pretended to drag it into the fire. \"I'll make you a real torch dragon.\"\"Good, good, good!You're amazing!You're amazing!I'll talk!I'll say it, okay?Really! \"Xiaolong spat a few times and spat out a few ink droplets. He muttered in a loud voice, \"You're so fierce. No wonder every time I see you, you don't have a wife!\"\"Huh?\"Mo Ran blinked and stole a glance at Chu Wanning. He smiled evilly and said, \"Didn't Master say that you have a wife?\"\"\u2026\" Chu Wanning ignored him. He frowned and shouted at the little dragon, \"You talk too much. Hurry up and write!\"\"Humph!Stinky man! \"With a plop, Xiaolong laid down on the rice paper that had already been spread out. It used its transcendence energy to condense the ink in its claws and hummed as it drew crooked dog-crawling talismans on the paper.It was no wonder that he couldn't directly dictate what spells he saw. Because the intelligence of a paper head was limited, it couldn't distinguish what the original spell was just by looking at the remaining traces. It could only follow the gourd and draw a ladle to erase what it saw.Fortunately, Chu Wanning could distinguish. As he lowered his eyes, he slowly said the name of each spell.Xiaolong drew a waning moon.Chu Wanning: \"Calming Spell.There's someone here who can't sleep. \"Xiaolong drew a Seven Stars Array.\"Star Manipulation Spell.Someone has set up a guard here. \"Xiaolong drew a rouge box.\"\u2026 Face Changing Spell.\"Mo Ran burst out laughing. He raised his hand and said, \"I know this. The little spell that little girls use to beautify their skin at night. It's that butterfly bone beauty seat, right?\"Chu Wanning didn't comment. It seemed that he was a little anxious because he had drawn so many insignificant spell marks. His slender fingers tapped twice on the wooden table. He frowned and said, \"Draw the next one.\"Xiaolong drew a heart again.Mo Ran asked curiously, \"What is this?\"\"Mind Calming Spell.\" Chu Wanning said irritably, \"It's useless. Someone is meditating.Next. \"Xiaolong mumbled and drew a dog-head again.\"\u2026 Beast Taming Spell \u2026\" Chu Wanning held his forehead, \"You, pick the important ones to draw. Don't draw those that are applied to the face, to the dog, to coax people to sleep.Next. \"Xiaolong raised its head and glared, \"You're really picky!\"\"Draw!\"Fearing that it would be thrown onto the candlestick and become the real \"Torch Dragon\", the paper dragon could only angrily use its two soft claws to draw a very complicated formation on the paper. At first glance, it looked very mysterious and profound.\"It looks like there are two circles, and then there's a cross, and then there's a vertical bar that goes straight down.It looks like the Yin and Yang Eight Trigrams. \"Mo Ran opened his eyes wide,\" Master, is this what the mysterious person left on the weapon \u2026 \"\"No.\" Chu Wanning glanced at it and felt a little pain in his forehead, \"It's the Voice Changing Spell.\"\"Oh?What does it do? \"\"Some people are born dissatisfied with their voice, or want to change their voice for other reasons. The Voice Changing Spell can do it. It's not a difficult spell.\"Chu Wanning paused and said, \"But the Voice Changing Spell will damage the throat if used for a long time. It's often difficult to restore the original voice \u2026 This spell is a little strange. I don't know who is using it.\"Mo Ran listened and smiled, \"Well, it's not strange.\"Chu Wanning sighed and was about to say the next one. Suddenly, he seemed to think of something. His eyes became misty and he suddenly turned to look at Mo Ran.\"Why not? Do you know something?\"\"What do I know? I just think that it's normal for someone to be dissatisfied with their own voice. Maybe it's that Miss Song. Maybe she originally had a rough and unpleasant voice and wanted to make it more pleasing to the ear?\"\"\u2026\" Chu Wanning flicked his sleeves and said, \"You're always thinking about nonsense.\" He turned to Xiaolong and said, \"Look at the next one.\"Xiaolong drew another heart.Mo Ran said, \"Oh, Master, didn't you say that the Qingxin Spell doesn't need to be drawn?\"\"Bah, you're just a kid. What do you know?\"The little dragon glared at him angrily and slapped his heart with its tail, leaving an ink mark on it. Then, it rubbed it away and painted the entire heart black.\"What's this?Black Heart Spell? \"Chu Wanning seemed to be embarrassed. After a moment of silence, he said, \"No.It should be the Love Spell. \"\"Then what is it?\"\"It's similar to the Love Pill sold by the Xuanyuan Society.\" Chu Wanning said, \"It bewitches people's intellect and makes them fall in love with themselves.It's usually used by women. \"Mo Ran opened his eyes wide, \"It can't be?Could it be that Song Qiutong's side \u2026 \"\"How would I know about this?\"Chu Wanning seemed very angry. He flicked his sleeves and said, \"It's other people's feelings. Why do you care so much? If they want to mess around, let them.\"\"But Chu Wanning, are you really not interested in this Love Spell?\"Xiaolong wagged its tail and said happily, \"I think this spell is very interesting. If you're willing to call me Dragon Prince three times, I'll \u2026\"Chu Wanning lowered his eyes and said murderously, \"Shut up and draw the next one.\"\"Hmph!You'll regret it! \"\"Are you going to draw it or not?\"Xiaolong didn't draw anymore. It sat down and scratched its belly with its short claws.Chu Wanning said coldly, \"What's wrong? Are you out of ink?\"\"Idiot, there's no array.\"Xiaolong rolled its eyes, \"I've already drawn so many spells and you still think it's not enough? There's no more, that's all. Besides these, this inn is clean. There's no more spells.\"Hearing this, Chu Wanning and Mo Ran's expressions changed slightly. Mo Ran said, \"That's all?\"\"That's all.\"Chu Wanning said, \"There's no spell to measure the Spirit Root?\"\"No.\"The master and disciple looked at each other, and there was a look of disbelief on each other's faces.It must be known that if the mysterious man wanted to use the Xuanyuan Club to find a new spiritual essence, he must have left a measurement curse on the Divine Martial Art. But now, it seemed that the Divine Martial Art was clean, and there was no curse attached to it. Could it be that they had misunderstood from the beginning that the appearance of this Modao had nothing to do with the mysterious man?Xiaolong saw that the two of them were silent, so it suddenly jumped into the air, circled left and right, and hummed, \"Hey, you guys should pay attention to me. I'm very tired from drawing things.Is there anyone who wants to give me a round of applause? \"Perhaps because Chu Wanning was irritated, seeing that it was still so noisy, he waved his sleeve and raised his hand, summoning a yellow talisman in the air. Xiaolong saw this and screamed again and again, \"I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it!\"But in the blink of an eye, it was sucked in by the talisman and became a picture on the paper. Chu Wanning pointed with his fingertips again, and the dragon on the picture slowly disappeared.Before it disappeared, it blinked at Chu Wanning in humiliation.Chu Wanning said, \"I'll call you if there's anything.\"Xiaolong cried bitterly and said, \"If there's something, Zhong Wuyan, if there's nothing, Xia Yingchun, Chu Wanning, Chu Wanning, you're so fickle \u2026\"\"Go back to where you came from!\"Chu Wanning, who had been talking to it nicely, heard this and became angry. He folded the talisman in half, flattened it with his palm, and put it into his sleeve.At night, Chu Wanning slept on the bed, and Mo Ran slept on the ground.Both of them were a little worried.They didn't expect that there was no talisman on the Shenwu Sword. Did the mysterious man master a method to measure Spiritual Roots that they didn't know, or was that man not in a hurry at all and didn't intend to find all the people with the strongest spiritual power now?\"Mo Ran.\"He called him in the dark night.Mo Ran naturally responded, \"Yes?\"\"Let's go back to the Peak of Life and Death tomorrow.\"He suddenly opened his eyes.\"What?\"\"That man can even miss the Xuanyuan Society, so he should have another way to find it.I'm afraid there won't be any results if we continue to investigate like this.Let's go back to the Peak of Life and Death first. I'll ask the Lord to send a secret message to the other nine sects and ask them to check if there are any Spiritual Essences in their sects. If there are, we'll protect them first. It's better than waiting for them. \"\"How can that be?What if that mysterious man is one of the leaders of the ten sects? \"\"The possibility is very small.Even if he is, it doesn't matter. He already knows that we're tracking him, so this matter won't make a difference. \"\"Then how can Master teach those leaders to listen to Uncle?\" Mo Ran said blankly, \"Is Master going to tell them everything?\"\"That's not necessary, and they may not believe it.\" Chu Wanning said lightly, \"I have my own way.\"Mo Ran asked curiously, \"What way?\"\"Recruiting disciples.\"\u201c\uff01\uff01\u201d\"I'll tell the Lord and let him tell the other nine sects that the Ghost Realm's barrier is often flawed, harming all sides.At the Peak of Life and Death, Yu Heng will take at most five disciples as disciples and teach them the High Purity Barrier, Slaughter Barrier, and other spells. \"Chu Wanning said calmly, \"Those sects have invited me many times to be an advisor, for the sake of these barrier techniques.If I spread the word that I'm willing to teach them, I'm not afraid that they won't come.I'll only take in high-grade Spiritual Bodies as disciples. In order to select talents, those leaders will have to obediently test the foundation of all their disciples, and our goal will be achieved. \"Mo Ran did not agree. In the darkness, his face turned green, \"You, you want to take in more disciples?\"\"Let's leave it to fate.\"Chu Wanning turned over, seeming to finally be a little sleepy, and his voice softened.\"I'll let them report their names when they find them, and then let them learn the normal barrier techniques by themselves. After three years, if there's really someone among them who can persevere, then I'll take them in \u2026\"In the darkness, hearing the gradually drowsy words of the person on the bed, Mo Ran felt as if he had kicked over a jar of vinegar in his chest, so sour that even his heart ached.Taking in more disciples?In the past life, you only took in three and were very picky. Why aren't you picky in this life?How can you just take them in like that!There were a few times when he wanted to talk to him, but when the words reached his lips, he became silent.Chu Wanning was completely unaware of Mo Ran's sea of jealousy, and finally fell asleep.The night was very cold. Mo Ran got up, put on a coat, and softly called him a few times. Seeing that he did not respond, he quietly pushed open the door and left the bedroom.The walkway of the inn was quiet, with only a few red silk lanterns shining with a faint light. The light was reflected on the wooden floor, creating ripples of orange reflections.Chu Wanning had already finished testing his Spirit Martial Skill.But Mo Ran had not yet tested his No Return.It should be known that if the Spirit Martial Skill was within a hundred feet of its owner, it could be summoned back to its owner's side with a spell.At that time in the Xuan Yuan Pavilion, Mo Ran did not have time to perceive whether this was the weapon from his previous life, so how could he miss this opportunity now?A layer of blood-red light floated on the tip of his finger.Slowly lowering his eyelashes, Mo Ran whispered, \"No Return, summon!\"After a few moments of hesitation, a muffled sound of a blade suddenly rang out in the distance. The sound was very soft, but it shook his eardrums, like a heavy hammer hitting his heart.Mo Ran suddenly opened his eyes, \"No Return!\"It was No Return. The Mo Blade was struggling, crying blood. The low roar seemed to be separated by layers of blood waves, rolling in the mortal world, rushing towards him.He could almost hear No Return wailing, shouting hoarsely. It was trapped, imprisoned by something that Mo Ran did not know.It could feel that its owner was calling it, but it could not answer the summons. Something was missing, cutting off the connection between him and it.But they had a contract, they had seen the beautiful rivers and mountains together, they had also waited for death together, and heard the last bit of warmth of the Shaman Mountain Hall.Man and Spirit Martial Skill were still connected, their flesh was torn apart by some kind of force, but their veins were still connected.Mo Ran's eyes were wet and red, and he muttered, \"No Return \u2026\"It's you.Why can't you come back?Who is stopping you?It's \u2026\"Creak.\"There was a light pushing sound.But in this breathless darkness, it was like a clap of thunder.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHe suddenly raised his head and looked toward the source of the sound.A man in a black, gold-patterned cloak appeared at the end of the corridor.He was tall and straight, and his whole body was covered with cloth. Even his face was covered with a black veil, only revealing a pair of eyes that couldn't be seen clearly in the dark.In that person's hand, there was a knife.The slender blade was completely black and unstoppable.No return.\"Who!\"\"Who I am is not important.\"That person said coldly. His voice was very strange, as if deliberately distorted. \"You only need me to know who you are.\"Mo Ran was shocked, but he still calmed down and hibernated.\"I'm just a disciple of the Peak of Life and Death. Is it interesting for you to know what I do?\"\"A disciple of the Peak of Life and Death?Oh, yes, but have you forgotten that you are also an Emperor Ta, an Emperor of the Human Realm, a ghost who killed his master to prove his Dao, a ghost who escaped from the Yellow Spring. \"With every word he said, Mo Ran's blood became colder.He felt like he had fallen into an ice cave.Emperor Ta.Slaughtered the 72 cities of Confucianism.Emperor of the Human Realm.Married the most beautiful woman in the world, killed his master and family, and climbed to the top of the Human Realm.That person said coldly, \"You are Mo Weiyu.\"Mo Weiyu.Heinous beyond redemption, unable to be reincarnated even after ten thousand deaths.Mo Weiyu should be torn into pieces at the Peak of Life and Death. His heart and eyes should be dug out, and he should die without a complete corpse!\"Who are you!!\"Mo Ran's eyes were red, and the childish look on his face was gone. What was left was only the fierceness of a demon. He confronted the person at the end of the corridor, and in the next moment, he would lock the other person's throat and tear all the names he didn't want to hear anymore into his throat!That person raised his hand wrapped in black veil. The long corridor condensed layers of ice in an instant, completely separating the space between the two of them.\"Now, you can't summon this knife.\"That person walked slowly and stopped about ten steps in front of him. \"Emperor of the Human Realm \u2026 Maybe it's better to call you Mo Ran now?What a joke. Have you ever taken a good look at yourself? \"\"My heart is no longer as cold and hard as steel. Following by Chu Wanning's side, I'm actually treating him better.\"\"Rebirth, rebirth, where is the person I said I would protect in my previous life?\"Mo Ran's expression changed. \"Shi Mei?!What did you do to Shi Mei?! \"That person did not answer. He only sneered, \"Do you know why you can't summon Bu Gui back?\"His fingertips slowly stroked the thick blade. \"It's because your soul is about to change, and your hatred is about to dissipate \u2026 Before you die, you regret that life of yours, for not being able to protect your Senior Brother Ming Jing. You once vowed that if there was an afterlife \u2026 you would definitely not let him down.\"That pair of sharp and horrified eyes suddenly looked up.\"Mo Ran, did you do it?!\"\"I \u2026\"\"The enchantment of the Ghost Realm is about to be broken. What happened in the past will repeat itself. Do you still want to watch him die and beg Chu Wanning to be merciful?\u2014 You're letting down the chance of rebirth in this life. You don't deserve to touch Bu Gui again. \"\"I don't need you to tell me that!\" Mo Ran said angrily, \"The matter between me and Shi Mei is not for others to interfere!Since you know that I'm a reborn person, who are you?A fake Gouchen?Or an old ghost who came back from the dead like me?! \"\"Heh \u2026\" That person chuckled. \"An old ghost who came back from the dead \u2026 Yes, I'm an old ghost who came back from the dead. Otherwise, do you think that you're the only one who's been blessed by the heavens to be reborn in this world?\"Who is it?!Blurred faces flashed through his mind like crazy.The people who died in his previous life.Xue Zhengyong, Madam Wang, Chu Wanning, Song Qiutong, Ye Wangxi \u2026Or the people who forced him to the Shaman Mountain Palace in his previous life to bury him.Xue Meng, Mei Hanxue, and the heads of the ten great sects \u2026Who is it \u2026 Who is it?!!!Who knew his secret? Who grasped his weak spot? Who was it that stepped through the Yellow Springs to chase after him? Who was it that wanted to force him into a dead end?!Who is it?!In just a moment, the figure in front of him moved. That man's clothes fluttered as he moved in front of him.After this person's rebirth, his strength was still so strong. Mo Ran was shocked.Bu Gui's blade was already pressed against his chest. With just a little bit of force, it could pierce through his flesh and destroy his heart.\"Mo Weiyu, I thought you were an infatuated person. But maybe it's because your Senior Brother Ming Jing is unlucky. Even after you've been reborn, you still don't put him in your eyes.\"Mo Ran gritted his teeth. \"Nonsense.\"\"I'm spouting nonsense?\"That person laughed coldly. He put a hand on Mo Ran's throat and slowly slid it down to his chest. \"How much space do you leave for him in your heart?That little bit of nostalgia you have, I'm afraid it's already been worn away. Is there anything left? \"Mo Ran angrily said, \"Who is in my heart? Do you think I don't know better than you?You're so long-winded. Why don't you take off your veil and let me see! \"\"You want to see me? There's no rush.\"That person's voice was like smoke. His gaze was also very distant, as if he didn't put him in his eyes. \"When you're about to die in this life, I'll show you.\"\"You're the one who's about to die. You \u2014 \u2014\"Before he finished speaking, he suddenly felt a bone-piercing cold under his feet.Mo Ran looked down. That person's ice spikes had climbed up his body at some point.Ice Curse, Ice Spikes \u2026 \u2026 Water Attribute \u2026 \u2026Who was it? In his previous life, who could cast this kind of spell \u2026 \u2026He had met too many enemies. When he was anxious to remember, his mind was a mess.Xue Meng, Fire Attribute.Chu Wanning, Metal Attribute. Wood Attribute.Ye Wangxi, Earth Attribute.Xue Zhengyong, Earth Attribute.Who was it? No matter how he thought about it, he couldn't remember who had such a strong power to control ice.\"You're right. I'm also going to die.However, Mo Weiyu, that will definitely be a matter of a very, very long time in the future. \"Xuan Ice quickly froze his entire body.This person's strength was too terrifying. Mo Ran released a bit of spirit energy to resist the ice. He felt a tyrannical and huge force fiercely rushing towards him.The person in front of him was not below Chu Wanning in terms of strength!!Water Attribute.Who!!In a flash, a blurry face seemed to flash past. But before he could think clearly, his throat was grabbed by that person.The fingertips covered by black gauze rubbed his throat. That person's eyes were gloomy, without any light.\"There's no need for Your Majesty to worry about my lifespan.\"He said slowly, \"Let me first help you regain some of the friendship you were born with. Otherwise, you won't do proper business and ruin my grand plan.\"\"Ugh \u2014 \u2014!\"Pfft.No Return wailed as it cut through its former master's flesh.\"The wound isn't deep. I'll just take your blood and make a seal.\"That person really did just smear some blood on his wound. Then, he touched the space between his eyebrows and muttered.Mo Ran only felt a sharp pain in his head. He cursed, \"Fuck, you, mother!Did I chop you up in your previous life? Or did I f * cking kill eighteen generations of your ancestors?Motherf * cker, what are you trying to do! \"\"Shh, don't move.It's just a good heart curse. \"\"I don't f * cking care if it's a good heart curse or a disgusting curse. Can you not disgust me?Scram!! \"\"Mo Ran.\"That person slowly drew a talisman between his eyebrows and sighed softly, \"How can you bear to ask me to scram.\" He paused and muttered again, \"The heart is not like water, the will cannot be stopped, the door of the heart \u2026 is wide open.\"His chest suddenly twisted in pain!\"You \u2026\"The ice curse was suddenly removed. Mo Ran staggered and slowly knelt on the ground with a pale face.\"You still haven't thanked me.\"That black-clothed person lowered his eyes with an indifferent expression. He looked at him for a while and said lightly, \"I've expanded all the emotions in your heart.What you love and hate will be clearer. In this way, you'll be able to see your own heart clearly, right?If you still don't do your best to protect Shi Mei and do your best, then you \u2026 are really useless. You're just an abandoned pawn! \"So this good heart curse made the love and hate in the heart stronger and clearer?Why did this person spend so much effort to protect Shi Mei's life \u2026Water attribute \u2026These were the last chaotic thoughts that flashed through his mind before he lost consciousness.With a \"thump\" sound, Mo Ran fell to the ground. Two thick eyelashes fell down.That black-clothed person coldly looked at him for a while, then slowly leaned over. He first checked his pulse. After a moment of silence, he raised his hand and condensed a ball of blue light in his palm.\"Forget all.\"The black-clothed person softly spat out these two words.The blue light became brighter. Mo Ran's tightly knitted eyebrows slowly relaxed.When he woke up, he would only remember that he went out and summoned Shen Wu, but Shen Wu did not come.He would not remember anything else. He would not know that there was another person in this world who was reborn.Although the good heart curse's effect could only last for a few days, it could very well point out the way to the heart of a confused person.\"Expanding your emotions, I'm afraid that when you wake up, you'll find that you like Shi Mingjing more and more. You like him so much that you want to dig out your heart and give it to him.\" The black-clothed person coldly said.\"See you later, Emperor Ta.\"After a night of disturbance, everything was settled. The next morning, Mo Ran opened his eyes and found that he was still lying next to Chu Wanning's bed.He turned his head. The window of the guest room seemed to have been blown open by the wind in the middle of the night. It was half open and half closed. With the morning breeze, it gently opened and closed, making a creaking sound as it hit the wood.The room was very quiet. Mo Ran did not look at the bed, but he knew that Chu Wanning should not have woken up yet.Outside the window of Banmiao Pavilion, there was a crab blue sky. The rising sun had not yet broken through the clouds. Early mornings were often pale and lacking in color. The sunlight did not give it much warmth. There were not many people who woke up early. She was too lazy to dress up and warm up her haggard and tired face.In the wind that blew in, there was a bit of the smell of grass and dew.Mo Ran laid like this for a while, letting his consciousness return. When he sat up, he felt a pain in his shoulder.Strange, when did his clothes tear? There was some dried blood under it.He was stunned for a while.Didn't he go out to investigate last night?He only remembered that there was no reaction from Bu Gui, so it should be a fake.After that, it seemed like \u2026Hiss, he could not remember clearly.He looked around and saw a thick nail protruding from the dark brown floor. Perhaps it was the nail that scratched him. Did he sleep so deeply?He did not feel anything at all.He put on his clothes and got up, looking at the bed.Chu Wanning was still lying on the bed. Although he was used to him being high up and enjoying the good position, he could only pick up the leftovers, such as the floor at the end of the bed, and make do with it for the night.But today, he was inexplicably angry. He glared at that person's side profile and gritted his teeth.\"Why is it always me sleeping on the floor and you sleeping on the bed? It's not wrong to respect your teacher, but isn't there also the saying of loving the child?\"Mo Ran was very unhappy.When he thought of the nail protruding from the floor that scratched him for no reason, he became even more angry.It was still early, and he did not want to suffer by lying on the floor. He simply lay down on the bed and closed his eyes to sleep.The two of them, one to the left and one to the right, would not touch each other on the wide bed.They had once hugged each other in dreams, but now they were sleeping in different places.In his previous life, they were skin to skin, limbs overlapping. In the craziest days, he was even unwilling to withdraw after making love with him every night.But the two of them, who had been so intimate, were now lying on the two ends of the big bed, sleeping like this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Mo Ran woke up again, the sun was already high in the sky.Mo Ran turned over and blinked. He saw that Chu Wanning was still sleeping.Perhaps it was because he had drunk the Mantis Fragrant Dew, or perhaps it was because his body hadn't been feeling well recently, so he had been having restless dreams. It was already so late, but he was still dreaming deeply. His back was facing her, and his long black hair was scattered, flowing between the pillows. What a beautiful night.Mo Ran: \"\u2026\"Since the Shizun didn't want to get out of bed, there was no need for the disciple to work hard. The bed was very comfortable, but it was better to lie on it.However, it was boring to lie down, so Mo Ran went over to play with Chu Wanning's hair.There was always a faint floral fragrance in Shizun's hair. It was soft like smoke and dense like mist. It was one of Mo Ran's favorite things to touch.His fingers passed through the thin stream of mist, and the silk-like texture wrapped around his fingers, giving rise to an itch that scratched at his heart and liver.The ink-colored bed curtains swayed slightly with the wind that came in through the window.He narrowed his eyes. He was always full of energy when he woke up in the morning. Besides, the taste of her fingers was so good, so familiar, so \u2026He lifted a strand of Chu Wanning's long hair and sniffed it.This warm and soft long hair slowly brought back the past from his previous life.Although after his rebirth, he tried his best not to think about the overly romantic and romantic affairs he had with Chu Wanning in the past, but for some reason, he missed them this morning.He also felt a little thirsty.He didn't want to touch the body of the person in front of him again, but he could always touch her hair. He closed his eyes and gently kissed the black hair between his fingers.This black color \u2026The Magi Mountain Palace at the Peak of Life and Death was also the same black color. Thousands of threads hung down and enveloped Mo Ran.He held the man's thin waist, and under his fingertips was a thin layer of muscle, which was completely different from a woman's.Chu Wanning sat between his waist and legs. He must be in a lot of pain. He kept knitting his sharp eyebrows. His phoenix eyes were filled with bits of light. In his ruthlessness and despair, there was also a touch of thick pink. He was so hateful, so unwilling, but so helpless and pitiful.As the victor, Mo Ran was calm and unruffled in the midst of the chaos, but at the same time, he ordered him without malice.\"Move faster.\"\"\u2026\"\"Why are you so slow? Are you out of strength?\"Even so, Chu Wanning was still unyielding. He slightly gasped for breath, his eyes filled with hatred, moist and thin red. Then, he bit his lips and began to violently move, almost as if he was harming himself.It was too painful.He repeated. His arched back gradually spasmed, and his body was drenched in cold sweat. He did not beg for mercy, nor did he make a sound.Mo Ran's long black hair cascaded in front of her. His eyes were blazing in the night. Bestial lust, madness, joy and comfort intertwined in his eyes.\"\u2026 Ugh!\"Suddenly, there was a muffled groan. The man on top of him seemed to be in so much pain that he could not bear it. Mo Ran's eyes darkened. He suddenly sat up and hugged the sweaty body. That person was trembling slightly. He tried so hard to endure, but he still could not help but tremble \u2026 But when Mo Ran sat up, he only sank deeper into the ground. His stomach felt like it was about to be pierced.The perpetrator of the violence, who caressed him tenderly, was extremely vicious.\"Chu Wanning, have you ever thought that one day, you would be done by me like this?\" He locked the person in his arms and slowly thrusted. Their ears and hair rubbed together. It was so intimate that it could not help but shudder.\"Wanye Yuheng, Bei Dou Xian Zun \u2026 Ah, it's still not the same. You want to open your legs and let me fuck you.\"His hands roamed around the other's waist as he pushed up against him. Feeling how tightly Chu Wan Ning was holding him, he was so excited that sparks flew in all directions in his chest, but he couldn't help but pretend to be calm, humiliating her in every possible way.\"Didn't you say that I'm despicable? Didn't you look down on me?But Chu Wanning, you're the one who's pleasing me now. \"He bit the other person's chin maliciously. \"Lower your head and look at how you're sucking me. Hmm?Between the two of us, who is more despicable, my good Shizun? \"\"\u2026\" Chu Wanning trembled and closed his eyes. He was unwilling to listen to such filthy words.This \u2026 was his first time \u2026It was with the person he used to like, but it was like torture.It was better to die.\"Open your eyes.\"His cold command rang in his ears.\"If you keep closing your eyes, Xue Meng is still in my hands. You know what I'll do.\"There was nothing he could do. In the end, he slowly opened his watery eyes.He was pinched and forced to lower his head to look at his disciple's genitals. Their bodies collided with each other, bringing out sticky blood and viscous fluids. It was extremely obscene.\"Get up.\"His legs went soft. His last bit of dignity made him unwilling to rely on Mo Ran's support to slowly get up.More than half of his genitals were pulled out. There was only a little bit of it left pressed against his acupoint.Mo Ran held his genitals and lightly poked them a few times. He didn't go too deep and only let Chu Wanning watch him being done. Chu Wanning's eyelashes kept trembling. He didn't know if it was because of pain, humiliation, or stimulation.\"You're really a pervert,\" Mo Ran said softly. \"If I knew this would happen, I would've done you when I was your disciple.\"He was a hooligan after all. He didn't know how to appreciate elegance.Such vulgar words were like knives, stabbing into Chu Wanning's heart.He suddenly raised his head and closed his eyes. His hoarse voice sounded for the first time.He said,\"Mo Ran, just kill me.\"That person's hand that was holding his waist trembled imperceptibly.Then Mo Ran smiled. His smile was still sweet and cute. His dimples were deep.\"Okay.\"Chu Wanning suddenly opened his eyes.Mo Ran saw his own twisted smile in those moist eyes that made him burn with lust.\"If you want to die, I won't stop you.But the way you die is not up to you.I want you to be ridden and fucked by thousands of people in front of your good disciple, Xue Meng. Oh, it's best if Xue Meng is also involved.Don't you think that's good enough? \"\"You \u2014 \u2014!\"These harsh words were like poisonous needles stabbing into a man's weak spot. This scorpion called Mo Ran bared his fangs and brandished his claws, admiring his results. He saw Chu Wanning's face instantly turn pale. Although he tried his best to restrain himself, his slightly open lips still trembled slightly. Mo Ran suddenly felt satisfied, pitiful, happy, and excited. He once again embraced Chu Wanning and buried himself deep into his body. He began to thrust rapidly and secretly, almost crazily: \"Heh, why are you so stupid. You took it seriously?\"He laughed lowly, and then kissed him hard. He rubbed him and panted: \"Don't think too much. I was lying to you.\"Chu Wanning was almost smashed into pieces in his arms, but his spirit seemed to have long been turned to dust.\"I was lying to you.\"Mo Ran panted heavily. He felt that he was not satisfied, so he pushed him to the ground and pressed on top of him. He raised his leg and invaded him, his buttocks moving quickly and forcefully.\"How can I bear to part with you \u2026 you can only be mine \u2026 you can only be mine \u2026\"His slender and cold fingers grabbed the ground, but he could not hold on to anything.Chu Wanning was helpless in the end, and could only be manipulated by him. He was fucked until he was absent-minded, and the light in his eyes gradually dimmed.Suddenly, he raised his hand and covered his eyes.Chu Wanning softly said: \"Mo Ran \u2026\"\"Mo Ran, if you still have a little bit of affection \u2026 a little bit of conscience \u2026\"His eyelashes slightly trembled under the back of his hand.\"Please \u2026 don't do this again \u2026\"\"Mo Ran \u2026\"His voice suddenly choked up.That was Mo Ran. In his previous life, it was the first time he heard him cry.\"Mo Ran, I can't take it anymore \u2026\"\"It hurts \u2026\"Suddenly, Chu Wanning turned over, startling Mo Ran out of his sweet memories. The past scattered, leaving only his heart thumping.The long hair between his fingers had slipped away, but that person was sleeping on his side. His face was very close, and Mo Ran could even see those long eyelashes clearly.So beautiful.He thought.To be honest, Chu Wanning did not have that kind of feminine appearance. His features were handsome, and he had a strong aura. In fact, he was more masculine than ordinary people.But the more he was like this, the more it made his heart itch.Mo Ran really wanted to see this iron-boned, insufferably arrogant man groveling under his body and being overwhelmed by ecstasy.His heart beat faster and faster.He stared at Chu Wanning's face, and his gaze moved inch by inch, landing on the light colored lips that were slightly open because he was sleeping.He could not help but get closer.Just a little closer, and he could kiss him.The taste of sweet dew.Mo Ran's Adam's apple moved, and he felt an endless thirst.A little closer, a little closer \u2026 they were about to touch.Suddenly, a trace of clarity flashed through his burning mind. He suddenly froze, and his face became pale.What was he doing!Suddenly sitting up, Mo Ran stared at the man on the bed \u2014 \u2014 Chu Wanning, Chu Wanning. No matter how used to being with him, it was all in the past!What was he doing?Was he crazy?Could it be that he really liked him?Suddenly shocked by this thought, Mo Ran's face turned pale, and he was in a daze.In the end, he took a deep breath, buried his face in his palms, and fiercely rubbed it. He cursed under his breath, and ran away like he was escaping.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Chu Wanning finally woke up, it was already noon.The Xianxiang Dew was really a good thing. He had a good night's sleep last night without any nightmares disturbing him. He yawned and slowly sat up.\"Mo Ran?\"Chu Wanning was slightly surprised that his disciple, who always liked to laze around in bed more than him, was not in the spot where he slept last night.There was no response.He got up, tidied up his clothes, and tied up his fog-like long hair while walking to the side room.A thin layer of water vapor rose from behind the Suzhou embroidered screen that depicted a mountain range. It seemed that someone was taking a bath behind it.\"\u2026 Mo Ran.\"Chu Wanning stood outside and called again.There was still no response.He couldn't help but feel suspicious. Chu Wanning knocked on the wooden edge of the screen several times, but there was no response. He frowned and went behind the screen.This was a place in the room specially used for bathing and washing. There was a big camphor wood bathtub in the middle.Chu Wanning glanced at it. The water inside was hot and full. It was sprinkled with herbs and flowers that had already been arranged by the shop, but there was no one taking a bath.But looking left and right, Mo Ran's clothes were folded on the wooden rack.He couldn't have taken a bath and ran out without wearing clothes, right?Chu Wanning's forehead twitched. He suppressed this terrible thought and pursed his thin lips. His expression was somewhat ugly.Just as he was about to turn around and leave, he suddenly heard two bubbling sounds behind him.Chu Wanning turned around and saw that in the large wooden tub covered with flower petals and herbs, there were several bubbles rising.\u2014 \u2014 Is there someone inside?As soon as he thought of this, he heard a \"splash\" sound. A naked young man jumped out of the tub like a dragon out of the water. Chu Wanning was so shocked that he took two steps back.The young man seemed to be holding his breath under the water, so he didn't hear Chu Wanning calling him outside. He couldn't hold it anymore and stood up, exposing half of his body. He shook off the water droplets in his hair like a dog on land. The water splashed all over Chu Wanning's clothes.\"Mo Ran!\"\"Ah!\"The person who was shaking his head was stunned for a moment before his eyes suddenly widened. It was obvious that he hadn't expected to see him as soon as he came out. He was extremely shocked. \"Master!\"\"You \u2026\"She glanced at the young man's well-adjusted figure. His gradually growing shoulders and back were already very broad. His lines were smooth and tight, full of youthful tension. The water droplets gathered into a stream along his firm chest muscles and slowly flowed down. Under the sunlight, they were dazzling.He looked like one of those extremely beautiful mermen, half floating on the water. His hair and eyes were wet, and there were even a few petals in his hair.Mo Ran wiped the water droplets off his face and smiled as he swam towards Chu Wanning. His hands were folded over the side of the bucket, his shoulders were stretched like a leopard's as he looked up at him.For a moment, Chu Wanning felt dizzy and his face was burning. He subconsciously asked, \"What are you doing?\"\"To take a bath.\"\"In the morning?\"\"Hehe.\" He felt a little guilty.In fact, in the beginning, he wanted to take a cold shower to suppress that evil fire. Later on, he suppressed the fire, but he also felt that since he had already taken off his clothes, he might as well take a good bath.After a while, he felt happy and dived into the water to practice the Breath Holding Technique. Unexpectedly, Chu Wanning bumped into him.\"What are you giggling about?\"Chu Wanning frowned. His tone gradually turned cold in an attempt to hide his hot-headedness. \"You woke up early and didn't even know to wake me up. You're messing around here by yourself, throwing your clothes here and there. You're a group \u2014\"\"Master.You \u2026 there's water here. \"He raised his hand and wiped the side of Chu Wanning's face.\"Group.\"Mo Ran smiled. He forgot that his hand was wet to begin with. Wiping Chu Wanning's face would only make it wetter.Chu Wanning froze in place. The surrounding air was cold. His face was tense and his lips were slightly pursed. Only his eyelashes fluttered occasionally.It felt like he was training a hunting dog, but the crafty dog raised its head and nudged him to please him.\"\u2026 Put on your clothes and get out.We're preparing to return to the sect. \"In the end, Chu Wanning threw down these words with a cold face and left with a flick of his sleeves.But in a place where Mo Ran couldn't see, the tips of his ears turned red.Just like in a place where he couldn't see, there was also a pair of moist, complicated, but still longing eyes that couldn't help but search for him until they disappeared around the corner.The cute smile on Mo Ran's face disappeared and was replaced by a kind of resentment.He angrily slapped the water and rubbed his face.Damn it.What was going on today?When he saw him in the bath, he only raised his hand to touch his face.The desire that he had suppressed with great difficulty was actually hard again \u2026\"Why did you wear your clothes for so long?\"By the window, Chu Wanning turned his face. His clothes were fluttering, and fine strands of hair blew across his jade cheeks. He was slightly impatient as he reprimanded him.Mo Ran coughed a few times and said vaguely, \"I used a spell to dry my hair. I, I didn't use it well. It was a bit slow.Shizun, please don't blame me. \"It was rare to see him speak so politely. Chu Wanning looked at him with some surprise and said, \"Since you're done washing up, go pack your things. We'll rent an immortal boat and go back later. I don't want to ride a sword. I'm tired of riding a horse.It's better to go by water. \"\"Oh, okay.\" Mo Ran didn't dare to look at him and coughed a few more times to cover it up.Chu Wanning frowned and said, \"What's wrong with your throat?\"\"\u2026 Nothing.\"He turned around to pack his luggage. The two bought some dry food and snacks in the shop, then went to the pier to rent a boat and set off.The boat traveled along the Yangtze River. When it reached a place where it was impassable, it set up a pair of wooden wings and flew high into the sky with magic.Although it wasn't traveling fast, it was comfortable and secluded.Eight days later, the two reached the peak of life and death. The wooden boat stopped in front of the mountain gate.Mo Ran lifted the bamboo curtain and let Chu Wanning come out of the cabin first, then followed behind him. At this time, the moon was high in the sky. It was late at night. Elder Yu Heng had ordered Xue Zhengyong not to send anyone to welcome them, so the two walked up the stairs. When they reached the entrance of the main gate, they met the four disciples guarding the gate.\"Elder Yu Heng!\"\"Young Master Mo!\"When the four disciples saw them, for some reason, a trace of panic flashed across their faces. Before the two could react, they knelt down and looked up to report anxiously, \"Elder, Young Master, there are people from the sect coming to seek revenge on the two of you!The Lord sent a messenger pigeon to ask the two of you to hide temporarily. It seems that this pigeon flew too slowly and didn't deliver!Elder, Young Master, quickly go to Unchanging Town to hide, but don't go in! \"Chu Wanning narrowed his eyes and asked, \"Why are you so panicked?\"\"It's people from the Upper Cultivation World. They said that Elder wants to practice evil techniques, so they want to take you to Heavenly Music Pavilion for interrogation!\"\"Heavenly Music Pavilion?\"Mo Ran said in surprise, \"Isn't that the prison built by the ten great sects to interrogate heinous criminals?\"\"Yes!They're here because of the incident in Colorful Butterfly Town! \"One of the female disciples said in panic,\" Elder, do you remember?It's that time when you were beaten with a rod! \"\"At most, it's just an abuse of the immortal technique and implicating mortals.Master has already been punished, so why are they suddenly bringing up old scores and alarming Heavenly Music Pavilion? \"Mo Ran frowned.\" Also, what's with the evil techniques? \"\"We don't know the details, but according to the people who came, the people of Colorful Butterfly Town were all killed in one night. The one who killed them was a half-immortal, half-ghost thing, and it seemed to have been ordered by someone.That ghost immortal's Dharmic powers are profound, so ordinary itinerant cultivators can't possibly control her. So those people in the Upper Cultivation World suspect \u2026 suspect that this was done by Elder Yu Heng! \"Chu Wanning: \"\u2026\"\"Pfft.\"Mo Ran laughed. \"I thought it was something serious. This kind of misunderstanding, it's better to clear it up, why hide?\"He then turned to Chu Wanning and said with a smile, \"Master, look at their brains. You should get rid of a small monster, saying that you're competing with your juniors for the limelight.You kill a big demon, then they suspect that you're practicing evil techniques and raising a ghost immortal to harm others.Then we might as well not do anything, and learn from them and focus on cultivating at home. \"Chu Wanning didn't laugh, but his expression was ugly. After a moment of silence, he asked, \"Are all the townspeople of Colorful Butterfly Town dead?\"\"It's said so, no one is alive.\"\"\u2026\"Chu Wanning closed his eyes.The female disciple saw that his expression was strange and said uneasily, \"Elder?\"\"Although this wasn't done by me, it might be because I didn't get rid of the devil completely.I have a responsibility, so how can I avoid it? \"Chu Wanning slowly opened his eyes.\" Mo Ran, follow me in. \"In the Shaman Mountain Hall, twelve bronze lanterns were lined up on both sides. Each lantern was ten feet tall, and nine layers of bronze branches stretched out. From top to bottom, from short to long, there were a total of 356 candles, brightly illuminating the Hall of Life and Death as if it was daytime.In the hall, Xue Zhengyong stood solemnly in his martial attire. His leopard-like eyes were like rings, staring at the people below like an iron statue.\"Villa Master Li, I'll tell you one last time.Elder Yu Heng is not in the sect right now, and I can guarantee with my head that the incident in Colorful Butterfly Town was not done by him deliberately.Don't make irresponsible remarks \u2026 that \u2026 \"Madam Wang covered her sleeves and reminded him softly, \"Huang.\"\"Cough, don't make irresponsible remarks about that!\" Xue Zhengyong waved his hand and said sternly.Madam Wang was speechless.In addition to the disciples on duty at the Peak of Life and Death, there were more than thirty people standing in the hall. Almost all of them were wearing jade-green brocade robes, with horsetail whisks in their arms and heavenly silkworm crowns on their heads. They were the disciples of the Jade Pool Villa, a new rising star in the Upper Cultivation World.The man in the lead was about fifty years old. His mustache was like a catfish, fluttering in the wind. Who else could it be other than the Villa Master of Jade Pool Villa, Li Wuxin?Li Wuxin twirled his long mustache and said with a cold smile, \"Master Xue, I respect your sect as a member of the Righteous Path, so I'm reasoning with you.After Elder Yu Heng and his disciples killed the devil in Colorful Butterfly Town, this shocking incident happened.Other than the three of them, Minister Chen's family didn't have any contact with any other cultivators. The witnesses and material evidence are all here. You have to admit it whether you want to or not. \"Xue Meng, who was standing beside his father, couldn't help but curse, \"You still have the f * cking face to say that?When have you ever cared about the Lower Cultivation World?Normally, you're just a bystander watching your own ascension, but when something happens, you blame it on my master. What kind of logic is this?! \"\"Young Master Xue.\"Li Wuxin didn't get angry. Instead, he looked at Xue Zhengyong meaningfully and said with a smile, \"I've heard of Young Master Xue's virtuous reputation, and people call you the Phoenix Fledgling. Now that I've met you, haha, you have such self-restraint. You've really opened my eyes.\"\"You \u2014!\"Li Wuxin leisurely turned to look at Xue Zhengyong. \"Master Xue, the Upper Cultivation World has strict laws.Once we interfere, we'll investigate thoroughly.If you insist on not handing over Yu Heng, Mo Ran, and the others, I'll have no choice but to ask the Scholarly Wind Sect, the number one sect in the world, to come and uphold justice! \"Xue Zhengyong had a fiery temper, so when he heard what Li Wuxin said, he felt rather disdainful.\"Whoa, I know your Blue Billows Manor has good relations with the Scholarly Wind Sect, but even if Nangong Liu himself stood in front of me today, I'd still say the same thing \u2014 if you don't hand them over, this matter has nothing to do with Yu Heng.\"Xue Meng also said, \"Manor Master Li, please go back.I won't see you out. \"\"Did you see that?Did you see that?!They're just so unreasonable, hiding and tolerating evil! \"A man's trembling voice suddenly erupted from the crowd. \"At that time, that guy surnamed Mo stole my friend's things. We politely came up the mountain to ask for an explanation, but they also coaxed us to leave in such a rude manner!Manor Master Li, did you see that?If they continue to commit crimes at the peak of life and death, the Lower Cultivation World will be finished! \"As soon as he finished speaking, he heard a soft laugh coming from the entrance hall.Everyone turned their heads and saw a blue-clothed and lightly armored youth leaning against the vermilion lacquered door in the darkness. He was lazily looking at the scene inside the hall.The youth was extremely handsome. His skin was tight and delicate under the candlelight, as if it would glow.\"Young Master Chang, when did I steal your friend's things?\"The youth smiled gently and cutely. \"Tell me about that Rong San 'er \u2026 No, maybe it's Rong Jiu, I can't remember clearly.In short, is that wonderful creature your friend, or is she your mistress?You're not honest, I'm afraid he'll be sad. \"The one crying and complaining was none other than the wealthy merchant from Yizhou, Chang, who had said earlier that he wouldn't let go of the peak of life and death.Young Master Chang suddenly turned his head and saw that Mo Ran had appeared. His expression changed at first, then his eyes flashed and he howled miserably.\"Mo Wei Yu, you bastard, Jiu 'er and I are close friends, there is nothing between us. Now that he has been poisoned by you demons and died a horrible death, you \u2026 you actually dare to slander others and frame him!\"\"What?\" Mo Ran was stunned and his eyes widened slightly. \"Rong Jiu is dead?\"Young Master Chang was angry and his eyes were filled with tears. \"His parents were also from the Colorful Butterfly Town. A few days ago, they went back to their hometown to visit their relatives and met with this accident.If he didn't go, how would I know about the evil things you and your master did?I wouldn't have gone to ask Manor Master Li for justice! \"However, Mo Ran didn't have a good impression of Rong Jiu. After being surprised, he waved his hand impatiently. \"What is a friend of a pestle and a mortar? You are the pestle and he is the mortar?Using a pestle to break a mortar, how are you innocent? \"\"Mo Ran!\" Young Master Chang didn't expect him to speak like this. He was shocked and angry. \"You, you are an illiterate hooligan!You, you \u2014 \"\"Cough \u2026\" Madame Wang couldn't keep her face.Xue Zhengyong blinked his eyes and didn't say anything. Pestle and mortar were not good words, but he felt that his nephew's words were reasonable and there was nothing wrong with them.Suddenly, a sigh sounded in the night. The sound was like the shattering of the Kun Mountain and the melting of the ice lake. It was indescribably deep and pleasant to the ears. Then, a hand with long bones and beautiful lines appeared \u2026It slapped Mo Ran's face unceremoniously.\"What filthy words, a friend of a pestle and mortar is a friendship between Gong Sha Mu and Wu You.\"Chu Wanning appeared at the door with a gloomy face. He said angrily, \"You only know how to embarrass me. Why are you still standing at the door? Get in!\"\"Master!\"\"Master!\"Xue Meng and Shi Mei unexpectedly saw him. They were both surprised and happy and came to greet him.Xue Zhengyong opened his eyes wide. He was angry and helpless. \"Yuheng, why did you suddenly come back?\"\"If I didn't come back, how long did you plan to hold on by yourself?\"Chu Wanning strode into the Magi Mountain Palace. Her handsome face was illuminated by the candlelight, making her look as elegant as a celestial being.He stood in front of the golden seat in the hall and nodded to Xue Zhengyong. He then turned around and waved his wide sleeves.Facing Li Wuxin's shocked eyes, Chu Wanning glanced over and said lightly, \"The Peak of Life and Death, Chu Wanning, sitting in Elder Yuheng's seat. I heard that you have something to ask and it would be impolite to refuse.\"\"Please enlighten me.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the main hall, this person was wearing a snow-white robe. He stood with his hands behind his back, his long sleeves reaching the ground.His expression seemed dignified and serious, but his eyes were slightly raised and his eyelashes drooped slightly. There was disdain and arrogance in his politeness.Li Wuxin did not expect Elder Yu Heng to be him. In an instant, his expression changed. \"Chu, Chu \u2026\"Chu Wanning calmly said, \"Manor Head Li, I trust you've been well since we last met.\"\"Why is it you!\"Li Wuxin, who had a glib tongue just now, was speechless for a long time. His face was as pale as wax. \"After you left the Confucian Wind Sect, there was no news of you. We thought you were going to travel the world. Who knew that you would actually \u2026 actually cast pearls before swine!\"Chu Wanning sneered. His eyes were cold. \"Thank you for thinking so highly of me.\"\"\u2026\"\"Alright, let's not talk too much. Let's talk business first.I heard that you think I killed five hundred residents of Colorful Butterfly Town to practice black magic.This was not my doing, but since Manor Head Li came all the way here, you must have misunderstood.I still have important matters to attend to, so I won't be accompanying you to the Heavenly Music Pavilion. If you have any questions, you can ask me here. \"After he finished speaking, he was too lazy to stand. With a wave of his sleeve, he sat down at the Elders' table.The Magi Mountain Palace had prepared special seats for every elder. Chu Wanning's seat was to the left of Xue Zhengyong. It was covered with a thin bamboo mat, and half of the bamboo curtain was hanging down. Compared to Elder Lu Cun's fancy seat, which was full of fresh flowers, it was too plain.All these years, although Chu Wanning had not deliberately concealed his identity, he had always kept a low profile. Thus, although the younger generation of the Blue Pool Manor had heard of him, they did not know how powerful he was.However, Li Wuxin was different. He had been in Jianghu for many years. How could he not know of Wanye Yuheng's illustrious reputation?He clenched his fists in his sleeves and glanced at Young Master Chang from the corner of his eyes.If he had not accepted Chang Family's money, he would not have taken on this difficult task.He originally thought that Elder Yu Heng, who stood at the pinnacle of life and death, was just a nameless cultivator. Who would have thought that he was actually Chu Wanning, who had not shown himself for a long time!If he had known that it was him, he wouldn't have gotten involved in this mess no matter how many benefits he was offered. But now, he couldn't advance or retreat. What should he do?Li Wuxin's expression did not change, but he was complaining incessantly in his heart.It just so happened that one of his direct disciples didn't understand the situation and thought that this Elder Yu Heng was being unreasonable, so his Master didn't know how to deal with it for a while. Thinking himself clever, he stepped forward and said, \"Elder Chu, have you ever been to Colorful Butterfly Town to subdue demons?\"Chu Wanning looked up and glanced at him. \"Not bad.\"\"Then, was that ghost bride also the evil that you suppressed?\"\"You mean Luo Xianxian?\"\"I \u2026\" That youth was at a loss for words. He only knew that the evil spirit who went berserk in Colorful Butterfly Town was a ghost bride, but he didn't know anything else. Therefore, when Chu Wanning asked him a question, he couldn't answer. He could only blush and say, \"In short, it's a female ghost!Why are you asking so many questions?She was very young, about 15 or 16 years old. How many brides in a town have died unjustly? \"Chu Wanning sneered. \"Colorful Butterfly Town has a ghost wedding as a custom. There are at least 50 ghost brides, if not 100. I really don't know which one you're talking about.\"\"You \u2014\"\"What do you mean by 'you' and 'me'?Unruly disciple, step back! \"After scolding the disciple who stepped forward, Li Wuxin put on a pleasant face and said to Chu Wanning, \"Grandmaster Chu, this is my disciple's first time out of the mountain, so he doesn't know the rules. Please don't take offense.The ghost bride he was talking about is indeed Luo Xianxian. \"Chu Wanning slightly frowned. \"Luo Xianxian's wronged spirit went berserk?\"\"Yes.\"Li Wuxin sighed. \"That female ghost lost her mind. Not only did she kill the entire Chen family, but she also started a massacre in the town.When I led my disciples to suppress her, there were almost no living people in Colorful Butterfly Town. \"Chu Wanning muttered, \"How could this be \u2026\"\"I heard that the one who was involved in this matter was Elder Yu Heng of the Peak of Life and Death. Something fishy happened, so I came here.In addition, in Colorful Butterfly Town, I also obtained two things.Grandmaster Chu, I hope you can take a closer look and see if they are related to you. \"As he spoke, he first took out a piece of blood-stained yellow silk from his sleeve and was about to hand it to Chu Wanning.Unexpectedly, Xue Meng stepped in front of him and said unhappily, \"Give it to me!\"\"This \u2026\"\"My Shizun is a clean freak. He doesn't like to touch things that have been touched by outsiders!\"Xue Meng was exaggerating. In fact, Chu Wanning was just unwilling to touch things that had been touched by people he hated. He really wasn't a clean freak.However, Chu Wanning didn't like Li Wuxin, so he just let Xue Meng be. He didn't say much and just lowered his eyes to drink the hot tea that Shi Mei offered.Li Wuxin suppressed his anger, but there was nothing he could do. He could only sneer and hand the yellow silk to Xue Meng.Under the candlelight, everyone was watching.Chu Wanning unfolded the silk and glanced at it. His expression changed.\"Crossing Spell \u2026\"\"That's right.Grandmaster Chu, according to my investigation, Luo Xianxian's vengeful spirit was temporarily sealed by you. Before you left, you gave a copy of the Crossing Spell to the only daughter of the Chen family and asked her family to copy it every day for ten years, right? \"\"That's right.\"\"Then this Crossing Spell is Grandmaster Chu's handwriting, right?\"\"\u2026 That's right.\"\"But Grandmaster Chu, your copy of the Crossing Spell has an extra rune at the end of every chapter. What does that mean? Don't tell me you don't know?\" Li Wuxin's voice suddenly became louder.\"The Myriad Waves Rune is a Counter Spell!\u2014 Every time the Chen family finished copying a copy of the Crossing Spell, they would draw a Counter Spell, which forcibly turned the Crossing Spell into a curse that harms people. It will break the seal and make Luo Xianxian's vengeful spirit go berserk!No one in the Chen family knows this. Except for Elder Yu Heng, who personally gave the silk to them, I can't think of a second person who can teach them to draw such a powerful spell! \"\"Old man, don't slander me!\" Xue Meng was furious. \"If my Shizun wanted to kill them, he wouldn't have to beat around the bush!What Positive and Counter Spells? Can't the handwriting be imitated?You suspect that my Shizun drew it, but I suspect that you secretly drew it on the way and used it to frame others! \"Li Wuxin put on a fake smile and said, \"Young Master Xue Meng, why are you interrupting when the elders are talking?\"Xue Zhengyong said, \"Villa Master Li, you're being biased by saying that this is Yu Heng's doing based on a piece of silk.My son is right. Handwriting can be imitated. If someone wants to frame Yu Heng, they can just copy his rune a few times and it will be very similar. \"\"Then we have to ask where Grandmaster Chu has such an old enemy who would spend so much effort to frame him.\"Mo Ran, who had been silent for a long time, suddenly laughed.Li Wuxin looked at him and thought of his vulgar remarks just now. He couldn't help but frown. \"What are you laughing at?\"\"I'm laughing at how you've forgotten one thing after discussing for so long.\"Xue Zhengyong asked curiously, \"What is it?Ran Er, what did you think of? \"\"Although I don't study much, I have some understanding of the Myriad Waves Incantation and I know how to draw it.\" Mo Ran smiled. \"Look, isn't this the right one?\"As he spoke, he condensed a wisp of red spiritual energy on his fingertips. He leaned against the pillar leisurely and spread it in the air. After a while, an exquisite incantation of the Myriad Waves Incantation was reflected in the air. It was as beautiful as a firework.Xue Meng said in surprise, \"You bastard, you're amazing. When did you learn it?\"Mo Ran smiled. \"It's in Shizun's book. I thought it was fun so I wrote it down.\"As he spoke, he casually tapped the bright red incantation and made it slowly rise into the air, above everyone's heads.The red inscriptions flickered blurrily, overflowing with bits of light.\"What do you think? Why don't you compare the incantation I drew and see if it's exactly the same as the one on the silk?\"The disciples of the Life and Death Summit were the least afraid of excitement. When they saw Chu Wanning expressionlessly throw the silk on the table, it was obvious that he agreed with Mo Ran's actions. They immediately rushed over and formed a circle to compare.The people from Bi Tan Village were still tense at first, but later they couldn't help but be curious. Some of them even had the mentality of nitpicking, so they also gathered around to take a look.After so many people looked at it for a long time, they finally came to a conclusion.The incantation that Mo Ran drew was exactly the same as the one on the silk. It was almost as if they were drawn by the same person.The idiot from before, Li Wuxin, spoke again. He pointed at Mo Ran and turned pale with fright. \"Good!Good!You confessed without being pressed!Looks like you killed them! \"Mo Ran was speechless.Chu Wanning suddenly said lightly, \"Little brother, how should I address you?\"\"Hmm?You're asking me? \"The idiot was stunned. He immediately puffed out his chest and said proudly, \"Wuxin's thirteenth direct disciple, Zhen Congming.\"Mo Ran: \"Pfft.\"Chu Wanning, on the other hand, didn't have much of a reaction to 'Really Smart'. After all, he also had a nickname, 'Scared You to Death'. He only said coldly, \"When the elders are talking, the younger generation should learn to shut up.\"This sentence was obviously mocking Li Wuxin's criticism of Mo Ran. When Li Wuxin heard this, his face turned into the color of pig liver. He was very annoyed, but there was nothing he could do. He could only change the topic and say, \"Grandmaster Chu's disciple is really a young hero. He's very capable. This incantation is actually drawn exactly like a grandmaster.\"\"Village Master Li, it's not just me. If you could draw this incantation, you would definitely draw the same incantation as my master.\"Li Wuxin glared at Mo Ran. \"What do you mean by that?!\"Mo Ran smiled. \"Myriad Waves Incantation, the strokes are complicated, the strength of the strokes, and the color of the ink can't be different by half a day.Therefore, no matter who drew it, it would be no different from the creator.This actually has nothing to do with the handwriting.If there is even the slightest difference in the drawing, this incantation won't take effect. \"\"Nonsense!\"After being pointed out by a junior like this in public, Li Wuxin couldn't help but become angry. His beard flew in all directions. \"Which incantation in this world would have such crafty requirements?!Although this old man has never practiced this incantation, I also know that this is nonsense. You brat, don't spread rumors! \"\"He's not spreading rumors.\"Li Wuxin couldn't hold it in anymore. He said angrily, \"Chu Wanning, words have no basis!How could you know!How could you know!The characteristics and weaknesses of an incantation are usually best understood by the creator. Do you dare to say that you are the creator of the Myriad Waves Incantation?! \"Chu Wanning raised his eyes and looked at him expressionlessly. He took another sip of tea and slowly said.\"Why wouldn't I dare?I'll tell you right now. \"Li Wuxin: \"???\"\"The Myriad Waves Incantation was created by me.\"Li Wuxin: \"\u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs soon as he said that, everyone was shocked.Especially the disciples of the Blue Pool Village, their expressions changed greatly as if they had been struck by lightning!In the Cultivation World, third-rate sorcerers memorized incantations, second-rate sorcerers comprehended incantations, and first-rate sorcerers modified incantations.However, there was another kind of person who was not related to the first, second, or third-rate sorcerers. That kind of person was usually unreachable. They did not need to memorize incantations because they had already comprehended them and were not satisfied with modification. Instead, they had mastered the last step.Creation.They were either good at refining unique elixirs, creating peerless armors, or drawing unprecedented spiritual incantations. In all these ways, they were called grandmasters.For the small cultivators of the Celestial Sect, these grandmasters often lived in the inscription of a scroll or on a treasure or spiritual weapon.The young disciples of the Blue Pool Village did not expect that the person they wanted to capture to the Heavenly Music Pavilion was such a god-like figure.Li Wuxin's forehead was covered with cold sweat, but as the head of the village, he had to hold on.He forced a smile, and there was a layer of oil on his waxy face.\"I didn't expect such a coincidence that the Myriad Waves Incantation was created by a grandmaster. Then I'm really \u2026 Haha, I've misunderstood you.However, when I was fighting with Luo Xianxian's vengeful spirit in the Colorful Butterfly Town, I got another thing. I don't know if this thing has anything to do with you. \"Chu Wanning frowned and asked, \"What is it?\"Li Wuxin waved his hand, and \"Smart\" immediately came over with a brocade box.\"It's a weapon.\"Chu Wanning did not speak. He looked at the brocade box for a while and suddenly said, \"Is it a willow vine?\"\u201c\uff01\uff01\u201dThis time, not to mention the others, even Mo Ran opened his eyes wide in disbelief.Li Wuxin said in a trembling voice, \"You, how do you know? Is it really you? No \u2026 What's going on!?\"A golden light lit up in Chu Wanning's palm, spreading inch by inch and coiling around the ground. As the light softened, a stretch of willow branches and leaves appeared in front of everyone.Chu Wanning, on the other hand, was unperturbed. He was now convinced that the Colorful Butterfly Town incident was the same as the Jin Chenghu incident and the Peach Blossom Spring incident; it was all done by the same person. Therefore, he asked, \"Villa Master Li, the thing inside the box is this weapon, right?\"\"Yes, that's right.\" Li Wuxin was almost at a loss for words.When the brocade box was opened, there was indeed a bunch of identical vine veins inside.Chu Wanning narrowed his eyes.When he was in the Peach Blossom Spring, the \"ghost\" that killed the feathermen and framed Mo Ran made him suspicious. Now, it seemed that he was right.\"Villa Master Li, can I take a look at this willow vine?\"Li Wuxin thought about it and secretly thought that the situation today was not good. It was better not to offend Chu Wanning, so he said, \"Grandmaster Chu is too polite. I came here to ask about the situation. If you're willing to take a look, I'm more than happy. There's no reason for me to stop you.\"When Young Master Chang heard this, he was unhappy. He had spent a lot of money to invite the Blue Pool Village to support him.Seeing that the situation was not good, was this old thing going to change sides?He kept glancing at Li Wuxin and glared at him angrily.Li Wuxin was not willing to pay attention to him. However, Mo Ran saw it clearly and joked, \"Young Master Chang, is there something wrong with your eyes?Why are you squeezing? \"On the other side, Chu Wanning took the willow vine from the brocade box and looked at it carefully.As expected, although the willow vine had the same appearance as Tianwen and the ghost, its breath was very weak. It was different from the Shenwu that had recognized its master. It was obviously a \"dead thing\".\"Heart-Picking Willow \u2026\"Xue Meng's ears were sharp. When he heard these three words, he was stunned. \"What?\"\"This willow branch, as well as the one that killed the feathermen in the Peach Blossom Spring, were all broken from the Heart-Picking Willow,\" Chu Wanning said.\"Ah!\" Shi Mei cried out in surprise. \"Is that so?\"\"Back in Jin Chenghu, before the old dragon died, he said that a certain spell of the fake North Chen required a strong wood spirit to sustain it.He must have left behind a few pieces of the Divine Willow before Jin Chenghu was destroyed.Although the spiritual power of the Divine Willow weakened after it fell, it could still hold on for a while. \"Chu Wanning's slender fingers stroked the golden leaves.\"And he didn't waste this kind of spiritual power that had been depleted. He used it to frame others and gave it to his puppets as weapons.\"As he spoke, he suddenly lit a fire in his hand and touched the willow vine that was very similar to Tianwen. The flame immediately burned and reflected in the frightened and confused eyes of the crowd.\"This item isn't my weapon.\"Chu Wanning extinguished the fire after burning a small part of the branch. He threw the willow vine away and said indifferently, \"Tianwen's spiritual power is abundant. Not even the Samadhi True Fire can burn him, let alone a normal fire curse.\"Li Wuxin opened his mouth and closed it again. After a while, he opened it again unwillingly.\"I've heard about the Peach Blossom Spring. I heard that Young Master Mo at the Peak of Life and Death killed the featherman immortal monarch by mistake \u2026\"\"Sigh, I didn't kill him.\" Mo Ran waved his hand.Xue Zhengyong was displeased, but his attitude was firm. \"I've already explained this to the immortal sects. It wasn't my nephew who did it.Villa Master Li, if you mention it again, don't blame me for being impolite. \"When Mo Ran saw him like this, he seemed to have triggered something in his heart. He was suddenly stunned. Something deep seemed to flow through his smiling eyes.He murmured, \"Uncle \u2026\"Chu Wanning said, \"The matter of the Peach Blossom Spring was originally a misunderstanding.But at that time, I couldn't defend my disciple.But today, all of you have come to ask for an explanation.I'm willing to tell the whole story to all of you from Bi Tan Manor. \"Under the flickering light, Chu Wanning briefly explained the matter of Jin Chengchi and the Peach Blossom Spring.When he finished, the disciples of Bi Tan Manor were dumbfounded. Li Wuxin's clothes were soaked in sweat. He stuttered for a while before he said bitterly, \"Grandmaster Chu, are you saying that there's a person in the world who has almost mastered one of the three great forbidden techniques, the 'Exquisite Chess Game'?\"\"That's right.\"\"How is that possible?That's a forbidden technique!Even the leader of the Confucian Wind Sect, the number one sect in the world, can't get the scroll of the forbidden technique \u2014 \"Chu Wanning said, \"I'm not lying. But whether you believe it or not, it's up to you to decide.\"\"That's impossible.\"Li Wuxin's face was pale. His lips trembled as he laughed, as if he could convince himself as long as he took this as a joke. \"If there's someone who can really master the Exquisite Chess Game, won't the world be in chaos? Won't everything in the cultivation world be rewritten?\"As the Emperor Ta of his previous life, Mo Ran was a bit unhappy. \"That guy only knows how to play it, not how to play it.If he really mastered it, would the world be so peaceful now? \"Li Wuxin's long beard trembled. He was about to say something when a sword light suddenly flashed at the door. A Bi Tan Manor disciple covered in blood rolled down from the sword and vomited a mouthful of blood. Then he raised his tear-stained face and shouted at Li Wuxin, \"Manor Lord, it's bad, it's bad.The barrier you set up above Colorful Butterfly Town has been broken!When the ferocious spirits rushed out, the senior martial brothers used their flesh and blood to create a barrier, temporarily preventing the ferocious spirits in the town from escaping. But \u2026 the thirty senior martial brothers of my Blue Billows Manor who were guarding the barrier have all died.He gasped for breath, then suddenly howled.\"Manor Lord!Quickly report this to all the cultivation sects in the upper cultivation world!All the dead people in that town are being controlled. It's a forbidden technique, a forbidden technique! \"\"What!?\"Li Wuxin staggered back and bumped into a pillar. His whole body was as pale and haggard as a corpse that had just fallen out of a coffin.\"We won't be able to hold on by ourselves \u2026\" The disciple's face was stained with blood and snot. \"Manor Lord!\"He suddenly saw Xue Zhengyong and repeatedly kowtowed to him.\"Sect Leader Xue, I beg you to come with us!My Senior Martial Brothers \u2026 I \u2026 I'm sorry \u2026 \"He mumbled incoherently for a while, then suddenly closed his eyes and looked up at the sky in grief.\"They're all \u2026 all dead!\"There was a moment of dead silence in the main hall, then an uproar ensued.Xue Zhengyong didn't panic in the face of danger. He immediately ordered Madame Wang to notify the rest of the eight major cultivation sects in the upper cultivation world and ordered Xue Meng to gather all the elders.\"Chu Wanning?\"\"There's no time to delay. I'll go first.\"\"But you don't know the Art of Sword Control \u2026\"Before Chu Wanning could answer, Mo Ran rushed over. He really wanted to meet the guy who \"mastered\" the exquisite Go game.\"Uncle, don't worry. I'll control the sword and go with Master.\"Chu Wanning glanced at him, but didn't say anything. It was a tacit agreement.The two of them walked out of the hall together. Shi Mei stood in place for a while with a pale face. Suddenly, he regained his senses and said, \"I, I also \u2026\"But when they ran out of the Shaman Mountain Hall, Chu Wanning and the others were already far away on their swords.Coincidentally, Xue Zhengyong told him to come back and not to run around by himself. Shi Mei had no choice but to turn back and look for Xue Meng, waiting for Xue Meng and the others to leave with the second group.Li Wuxin had lived like a prince for a long time in the Blue Pool Manor. He had never encountered such a big event. But the old man still wanted to save face. He took a deep breath and immediately ordered people to take care of the disciple who delivered the letter. He also sent a message to the rest of the elders of his sect, telling them to also gather troops and prepare to go to the Colorful Butterfly Town again to restore their dignity.A group of people walked out of the Peak of Life and Death in a grandiose manner. Like hundreds of shooting stars, they flew from the Peak of Life and Death to the Colorful Butterfly Town.Li Wuxin stood at the head of his sword and walked among the clouds. He couldn't help but secretly size up the disciples of the number one sect in the lower cultivation world with the corner of his eyes.He never expected that there would be a day when he would be leading his troops into battle. Unexpectedly, he would be on the same side as this \"motley crew\" that he looked down on the most. For a moment, his mood was a bit complicated.However, the sword traveled a thousand miles in the blink of an eye. The clouds in front of him were split open and a beam of blood-red evil light soared into the sky. Li Wuxin was no longer in the mood to care about the difference between the upper and lower worlds of cultivators \u2014In the sky, a red light formation as big as the entire Colorful Butterfly Town was constantly flashing. The huge formation was divided into a neat checkerboard grid by the beam of light. On the checkerboard, the shadows of the dead townspeople were floating in the air like wooden and clay sculptures. There were five hundred families and over a thousand residents. Looking at it, it looked like a lush jungle of human flesh.Li Wuxin cried out involuntarily, \"This, this is really \u2026 the Exquisite Chess Game!\"Xue Zhengyong's complexion was also extremely unsightly. He said to Li Wuxin, \"Villa Master Li, I'll take people to the southeast. I'll have to trouble you to go to the northwest. The people from the other eight sects haven't arrived yet. Colorful Butterfly Town will have to rely on us to hold on for a while.\"Li Wuxin really didn't have the mood to care about the \"us\". He nodded and said, \"Okay, okay.\"Xue Zhengyong cupped his fists towards him, and then descended with his sword, leading the others to descend from the sky, one after another landing in the southeast part of Colorful Butterfly Town. The protective barrier formed by the disciples of Blue Pool Manor using their flesh and blood was already on the verge of collapse, and its aura was extremely weak. Through the translucent barrier, one could see the rioting group of corpses inside.\"Chu Wanning!\"Seeing a man in white fluttering clothes and a young man in blue and silver light armor standing in front of him, Xue Zhengyong shouted, \"What's wrong?Can't this barrier be repaired? \"Chu Wanning had been here for a long time. The world's number one barrier master was here, but this barrier was still in a damaged state. Xue Zhengyong was very confused.Unexpectedly, Chu Wanning ignored him. Just as Xue Zhengyong was about to call again, Mo Ran suddenly turned around and gestured at him.\"Shh, uncle, don't make a sound.Come here. \"Xue Zhengyong walked over and asked, \"What do you mean?\"\"Don't disturb him.\"Mo Ran pointed at Chu Wanning.Although he was standing, his eyes were closed. His lips were pale, without a trace of blood.Xue Zhengyong was shocked. He used his finger to touch the side of his neck and said in horror, \"Soul Separation Technique?\"\"Yes, there are ghosts inside, thousands of them, but I can't see Luo Xianxian. She should be in the innermost part.The matter hasn't been investigated yet. He doesn't know what the person behind this is going to do this time, so he wants to find Luo Xianxian and ask her himself. \"\"They're all ghosts, what's the point of asking?!\" Xue Zhengyong slapped his thigh in anger. \"It's more important to strengthen the barrier!\"\"Absolutely not!\"Mo Ran said sternly. \"Master used the Soul Separation Technique to temporarily separate his soul and enter the barrier because it's full of dead people. This way, he won't alert the enemy.If we strengthen the barrier now, it'll kill Master! \"\"What?!\" Xue Zhengyong hurriedly said, \"Nephew, you stay here and guard. I'll go talk to Li Wuxin!\"Mo Ran nodded and said, \"If Master's soul returns, I'll immediately use the blue spell to light it up in the air. At that time, I'll seal the east, south, west, and north together.But if I don't light it up, uncle, you must not let them repair the barrier. Otherwise, thousands of ghosts will devour Master's soul and he won't be able to protect himself. \"\"I know, I know!\" Before Xue Zhengyong finished speaking, he had already dashed out.Mo Ran raised his eyes and looked at the barrier that was about to collapse.\"It's about time, Master. You should have found Luo Xianxian by now.\"He turned his face and held Chu Wanning's cold hand naturally out of worry. However, he didn't notice it at all.He stared at Chu Wanning and said softly.\"Soon \u2026\"At this time, Shi Mei, Xue Meng, and the others landed and stood in the crowd. Unexpectedly, as soon as they raised their heads, they saw the two people in front of the barrier with their hands clasped together.He was stunned at first, then his face turned pale. He bit his lips and slowly turned his head away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChu Wanning's soul was walking through the Bounded Domain at this time.Everywhere he passed, there were ghosts and demons roaming about.But what was strange was that the bodies were all badly mutilated. Every one of them had their hearts dug out before they died. Their chests were empty, and there were blood vessels and flesh hanging outside. Some of them even had white ribs.Chu Wanning knew that something was wrong, but the defensive Bounded Domain hanging around Colorful Butterfly Town was getting weaker and weaker. He couldn't stay for long, so he quickly rushed to the Chen Family's house.When he arrived at the Chen Family's house, he saw that there were four cauldrons in each of the four directions.Each of the four cauldrons was emitting thicker and thicker smoke.But the smoke was not pure white, but red, blue, brown, and gold.There was a fire under the cauldrons, which was filled with blood. However, when he looked closer, he found that under the boiling blood, there were piles of red meat.People's hearts!Each of the four cauldrons was full. They were the hearts of the dead people in the town!\"Sand makes a tower \u2026\"Chu Wanning murmured.He suddenly understood why he and Mo Ran had not seen the mysterious person continue to search for the Essence Spirit Body even though they had been searching for it for so many days. That crazy guy could actually do such a thing!The so-called accumulation of sand to form a tower was to dig out hearts of the same attribute and pile hundreds of them together. Although they were not as powerful as the Essence Spirit Body, due to the soaring resentment of the people who died in vain, they could still stimulate a significant amount of power for a short period of time.But why did it have to be Colorful Butterfly Town?Why did it have to be Luo Xianxian?Stepping into the Chen Family's courtyard, he saw that Minister Chen and Mrs. Chen had both hanged themselves on the beam in the hall. Their hearts were also dug out, but they didn't die like the townsfolk outside. They were torn into pieces from the waist down by a strong force. Their legs and feet couldn't be seen.Looking around the hall, he didn't see Luo Xianxian. Then he entered the ancestral courtyard and saw a bowl of meat paste in front of the ancestral tablets of the Chen Family.Looking carefully, there were half an eyeball and a finger mixed in the meat paste \u2026Chu Wanning was disgusted and was about to leave when he suddenly heard a burst of clear laughter coming from above his head.Suddenly, he raised his eyes. The white paper lanterns fluttered in the air, and the extinguished candles lit up one after another.Luo Xianxian was sitting on the beam. Her feet were as white as jade, and she was wearing a red wedding dress. She was swaying and looking at Chu Wanning with her head tilted.\"Oh, you found me.\"She smiled charmingly. Although she looked like the one in Chu Wanning's memory, she was completely different from the shy and bashful soul that Chu Wanning had seen back then.She was arrogant and blazing like a flame. Her eyes were still round, but they flashed with a demonic bloody light.Luo Xianxian was demonized.Heaven's Inquisition only had one chance.Before, when Chu Wanning came to Colorful Butterfly Town to subdue demons, he had already used Heaven's Inquisition to interrogate her, so he couldn't use this method a second time.The only way was to suppress the demonic nature in her soul and call her back to her true self before interrogating her.Chu Wanning said, \"Luo Xianxian, why are you doing this?\"In his sleeves, he had secretly formed a formation and was ready to launch it.\"Hey.\" The petite girl said crisply, \"I'm happy. It's none of your business.\"Chu Wanning shook his head and frowned deeper. There was a scar between his eyebrows, as if it was carved.\"The one in the bowl is Chen Bohuan's younger brother?\"\"Oh, you mean him.\"Luo Xianxian said carelessly, \"The one in the left column is his. The one in the right column was chopped up by that little bitch surnamed Yao.\"\"\u2026!\"\"Who asked her to die? She didn't like anyone else, but just because she was the county magistrate's daughter, she wanted to steal my husband.She should have been chopped into pieces! \"Luo Xianxian had completely lost her mind at this time. Her temperament was completely different from when she was alive. She couldn't recognize that the person in front of her was \"Brother Yama\" who had defended her.Chu Wanning heard that Chen Yaoshi was also dismembered, and his heart was even colder. He asked in a low voice, \"Then \u2026 the little sister of the Chen family \u2026\"\"She treated me well, so I didn't treat her badly.\"Luo Xianxian said and smiled. Her lips were delicate and beautiful, as if they had just been stained with blood.She rubbed her belly and said with a bright smile,\"That's why she's here.\"\"I ate her up.Then my little sister won't be bullied when she's with me. \"\"\u2026 You're crazy.\"Before he finished speaking, a flame and lightning appeared in his hand. The golden light suddenly lit up the whole room.Chu Wanning leaped into the air and slapped a spell on Luo Xianxian's forehead as she screamed.The ghost screamed!Speed was the most important thing in war. Chu Wanning was swift and fierce. She drew ten shining chains in the blink of an eye and bound Luo Xianxian.He pointed at her eyebrows with his slender fingertips.His eyes were shining like blazing lightning. His face was gloomy and cold, like thunder clouds.His thin lips moved slightly and he started to chant the spell.Luo Xianxian's eyes bulged and saliva dripped from her mouth. Her beautiful face became ferocious as she chanted, \"Shut up! Let me go!I'll pay with blood! What's wrong with that? \"Chu Wanning ignored her. He looked down and the light on his fingertips became brighter.\"Ah \u2014!\" Luo Xianxian screamed hysterically, \"Let me go!Let me go!!My head hurts!I can't take it anymore!!! \"She screamed and suddenly stopped. Her eyes were full of blood and the corners of her mouth were slightly curved.Two strange chuckles rang out.\"You want me to scream like that, right?This immortal? \"\u201c\uff01\u201dChu Wanning's phoenix-like eyes suddenly widened. Almost as soon as she withdrew her hand, her long body flew a zhang away.The white shadow was so fast that he barely avoided Luo Xianxian's Soul Breaking Palm. He floated under the veranda, white silk fluttering in the wind.Luo Xianxian straightened her body slowly. The pain she pretended to be in disappeared. She was not affected by Chu Wanning's Purification Spell at all. Instead, her Spiritual Power was stronger than before!\"You want to hurt me with a mere Purification Spell?\"Luo Xianxian sneered.\"I've absorbed the Qi of thousands of living people in this town. I only have one last night to refine my mortal body.At that time, I can save Chen from the netherworld. We can live together and stay away from the world of mortals.How can I fail at the last minute and be ruined by you, a Taoist priest? \"Her nature was gone. The only thing in her heart was to never be separated from Chen Bohuan.Chu Wanning thought of something and asked in a low voice, \"Who told you that you can refine your mortal body this way?\"\"What does it have to do with you?\"Chu Wanning said coldly, \"This person is full of nonsense. Your original body has been destroyed. If you want to refine your mortal body, you have to enter the reincarnation cycle again.How can you be reborn by absorbing the Qi of thousands of living people?He lied to you and slaughtered everyone in the town just to gather the hearts and souls so that he could gather Reiki and do what he wanted to do. \"\"\u2026!\" Luo Xianxian suddenly opened her eyes wide, \"Impossible!He wouldn't lie to me! \"\"Who is' he '?\"\"He \u2026 he is \u2026\" After a while, Luo Xianxian screamed and held her head, \"I don't know!I don't know!I want my mortal body!I want to live!I don't want to die!!!He didn't lie to me \u2026 He didn't lie to me \u2026 You lied to me \u2026 Yes, it's you!!! \"The red silk was biting cold. The female ghost stretched out her sharp claws and attacked Chu Wanning!At the same time, an ominous thunder suddenly came from the sky. Chu Wanning dodged Luo Xianxian's attack and looked up. He saw that the defense barrier had been torn apart by the murderous aura of the Colorful Butterfly Town. The Qi of the living people outside rushed in and zombies roared in all directions!The barrier was about to break.It was too late!If he couldn't call back Luo Xianxian's spiritual mind, he could only choose to kill her here.Then all the clues would be cut off \u2026Outside the defense barrier, Li Wuxin looked at the horrible crack in the sky and shouted at Xue Zhengyong, \"Don't you want to fix it?Fix it!If the barrier is broken, thousands of corpses will swarm out. Can you and I stop them? \"\"Wait!\"Xue Zhengyong's face was not good, and beads of sweat appeared on his forehead. \"Don't fix it. Yuheng is still inside.Wait. \"Li Wuxin cursed in his heart. Seeing the crack in the barrier, his heart was beating fast. He said angrily, \"If the barrier is broken later, there will be a fierce fight. I'll see how you explain it to the whole world of cultivation!\" After that, he turned to the disciple and asked loudly, \"Have you sent the fuse?When will the other eight sects arrive? \"The disciple in charge of sending the message was so anxious that his forehead was full of sweat. \"The eight sects all said that this is an important matter and they need to report it to their leaders first.After the leaders and elders discuss and decide, they can come to quell the chaos. \"\"\u2026\" Li Wuxin's face immediately turned as black as the bottom of a pot. \"What about the Confucian Wind Sect?Immortal Nangong has always been bold and daring. How can you be so wishy-washy? \"\"This \u2026\" The disciple didn't know how to answer, but suddenly, he saw the sound transmission talisman flash. After reading it, he was overjoyed and said repeatedly, \"The Confucian Wind Sect is here!The Confucian Wind Sect just sent a message saying that they will immediately send disciples to suppress the evil! \"Sure enough, in less than the time it took to drink a cup of tea, a layer of blue clouds suddenly rolled over from the horizon. When it got closer, it was no longer a cloud, but a black mass of over a thousand people. Each of them was under the command of a blue crane, and they were in an orderly formation.The two people in the lead were Nangong Si and Ye Wangxi.Nangong Si was riding on his demon wolf Naobaijin. He had a jade bow in his arm and a quiver of arrows on his back. He looked majestic, and the arrogance of a young man was written all over his face.Ye Wangxi was still dressed in black and wrapped in a shawl embroidered with the totem of the Confucian Wind Sect's red-crowned crane. He looked 70% handsome and 30% beautiful.\"What's going on?!\"As soon as Nangong Si saw the tattered defensive barrier explode, he glanced around the crowd with sparks in his eyes. He directly skipped over the group of people at the Life and Death Summit of the lower cultivation world.His gaze fell on the only person who was still qualified to talk to him, the Jadepool Manor Master.\"Li Wuxin!The barrier is already cracked like this, yet you're just standing there like idiots. Don't you know how to fix it?! \"Although Li Wuxin was much older than Nangong Si, he was the only son of the Sect Master of the world's number one sect. He was actually scolded until his face turned red, but he forced himself to smile.\"Young Master Nangong, you don't know. It was Sect Master Xue's idea not to fix the barrier \u2026\"In a word, he threw the hot potato to Xue Zhengyong.\"Life and Death Summit?\"Nangong Si glanced at Xue Zhengyong and snorted. It was unknown whether he was sneering or had other intentions.Then, he waved his hand and said to his personal attendant, \"Go fix this damn pot. So long-winded. I thought it was a big deal.\"Ye Wangxi wanted to stop him. \"Young Master \u2014\"Nangong Si didn't even look at him. What was even stranger was that Song Qiutong also came.However, she wasn't standing next to Ye Wangxi today. Instead, she stood next to Nangong Si. Her face was still covered by a white veil, and her eyes were lowered. She looked extremely obedient.The disciples of the Confucian Wind School didn't hesitate in their actions. They only listened to the orders of their school's leader.This was especially true for Nangong Si's personal attendant, who was raised by that wild horse. The group didn't listen to any dissuasion or explanation. They all stepped forward and began to form hand seals.\"Stop!\"Xue Zhengyong had just interrupted four or five people's moves. When he turned around, he saw that another disciple had already formed a repair hand seal. A ray of blue light shot towards the crack in the barrier.Xue Zhengyong's expression suddenly changed. He shouted, \"Yuheng!!\"\"Bang!\" Sparks flew in all directions.At this critical moment, a blood-red bolt of lightning suddenly struck down. It forcibly intercepted the repair hand seal in front of the crack!Everyone looked up and saw a young man holding a willow vine and standing in the air. He was currently guarding the barrier.The young man's face was originally very bright and amiable, as if he was born with warmth. However, at this moment, his gaze was sharp and his eyes were like torches. The willow vine in his hand was overflowing with blood-red light. Every leaf was sputtering with flames.Mo Ran's eyebrows were extremely low. In the air, he coldly said, \"I f * cking said that no one is allowed to touch this barrier.Are you newcomers deaf?Don't you understand human language?! \"Although he loathed Chu Wanning, that was still a personal grudge between the two of them.Whether it was in the past or present, except for himself, if anyone dared to touch a single hair on Chu Wanning's head, Mo Ran would want to take that person's dog life.He had said that only he could kill, destroy, and bully the people he hated.In his rage, he couldn't help but reveal some of the ruthlessness from his previous life. His entire aura was no longer that of the usual playboy playboy.Not to mention the people of the Confucian Wind School, even Xue Zhengyong, Xue Meng, and even Shi Mei were stunned when they saw Mo Ran like this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNangong Si looked displeased. His eyes were burning like boiling molten iron.His gaze swept past and paused for a moment on Mo Ran's fiery-red Divine Martial Arts. Then, he looked away.\"Who is this?\"Ye Wangxi said, \"He is the Young Master of the Peak of Life and Death. His surname is Mo.\"\"Mo?\" Nangong Si frowned. \"The one you just picked up a few years ago?\"\"Yes.\"Nangong Si glanced at Ye Wangxi. \"Do you know him?\"\"Peach Blossom Spring once lived in the same courtyard.\"Nangong Si sneered. No one knew what he meant.But Ye Wangxi saw his reaction. His handsome face paled a little. His eyelashes drooped, and then he pursed his lips and didn't say anything.\"Since he wants to wait, then let's give him some face.\"Nangong Si said, \"He is the Master of Divine Martial Arts at such a young age. I want to see what he is capable of.\"Mo Ran didn't have time to pay attention to the Confucian Wind Sect. He turned around and his clothes fluttered in the wind.The enchantment was broken. There was not much time left.Chu Wanning, are you not done yet?Whoosh!Luo Xianxian's claws broke the gauze curtain. The white silk fluttered, and the plain satin was shaken into thousands of snowflakes.Chu Wanning felt a very familiar aura approaching. He suddenly reacted and opened his eyes wide. \"Tian Wen?!\"No.It was not Tian Wen.When he fought with her, she had a spiritual power that was very similar to Tian Wen.The tent in the Chen family mansion was like a thin fog. It locked a living soul and a malicious spirit.After exchanging more than ten moves, the mystery in Chu Wanning's heart gradually dissipated. She suddenly thought of a part of it and was suddenly enlightened. She suddenly understood.\"Heart-Picking Willow \u2026\"Luo Xianxian had died long ago. She had been cremated. At that time, she could only rely on Madame Chen's body.There was no reason for her to turn back to her original appearance now.That mysterious person took a section of the Heart-Picking Willow's withered vine and built a temporary residence for her to return her soul.The cooked human hearts outside were steaming with smoke.Gold, Water, Fire, and Earth were all waiting for Luo Xianxian, the \"Wood\", the Heart Picking Willow.What was that person trying to do?!Could it be that he racked his brains just so that Luo Xianxian could regain her physical body so that she could go to the World of Spirits and Souls and live together with Chen Bohuan?Who would do this for her?Her family was long dead.Family \u2026Family!!Chu Wanning's heart stirred, and his blood surged.He suddenly remembered what Luo Xianxian had said to him when he first met her.She had an older brother who went missing many years ago \u2026Was it him?\"Those who block me shall not live!\"Luo Xianxian had a physical body, while Chu Wanning was a living soul. Although her Wakan was not as strong as his, it was hard to tell who was better.In the blink of an eye, her bright red claws pierced towards his heart. Fearing that his soul would be damaged, Chu Wanning suddenly dodged and backhanded her forehead.\"It's useless, it's the same no matter how many times you try!The Purification Spell can't hurt me! \"She sneered and roared to the sky, summoning the colorful butterflies from all directions to suppress the zombies.\"You wandering ghosts, why don't you listen to my orders?!Gather here, drink blood and slaughter! \"A terrifying howl suddenly rang out. The Colorful Butterfly Town was in a state of chaos. The Heartless Zombies that were randomly rampaging around heard her call and rushed towards the Chen Residence.The zombies were like a tide, rising and falling one after another, and their roars were like waves, quenching in the wind.The roar that made people feel cold was like a battle cry on the battlefield, spreading over hundreds of miles in an instant, and everyone could hear it clearly whether they were inside or outside the enchantment.Outside the enchantment, all the immortals were terrified.Inside the enchantment, Chu Wanning was fighting alone.He was alone, and his soul was lonely. He stood in front of Luo Xianxian in a white robe.She was laughing heartily, and her eyes were full of madness and fierceness.He was a gentleman, and his face did not change when he heard hundreds of ghosts, but his eyebrows were very low, and his eyes seemed to be covered with a layer of haze.\"Luo Xianxian, do you still remember some of the words you once said to me?\"\"Huh?\" She seemed to not expect him to ask this, and couldn't help but be stunned.While she was in a daze, Chu Wanning had already rushed to the top of the Chen House's courtyard with his white robe fluttering, and a pair of spotless silk shoes landed on the edge of the sandalwood tiles.\"You once said that you never wanted to be a ghost, and you also said that you never wanted to harm people.\"His voice lingered, and the wind blew in all directions.Chu Wanning looked up, and the black mass of zombies rushed over from all directions.He frowned slightly, and suddenly waved his sleeves, and the cold wind blew the living souls' clothes.A cage of golden light suddenly lit up between his hands.\"Excuse me.\"Suddenly, thousands of willow vines rose from the ground!Colorful Butterfly Town, which was full of blood and corpses, instantly cracked thousands of holes, and thick willow trees broke out of the ground one after another!They were all overflowing with dazzling golden light, and like thousands of chains, they strangled the running zombies one by one!Chu Wanning closed his eyes, and his long hair fluttered in front of his cold face.He said in a low voice, \"Tianwen, Ten Thousand Coffins.\"He suddenly looked up, and his eyes were like flames and lightning.The rows of golden willow trees suddenly shone brightly, and countless dense branches and leaves grew out, trapping the zombies that were still roaring and struggling. Then, a crack appeared on every willow tree, and as the crack opened, the trees wrapped the zombies and sealed them.Ten Thousand Coffins.The largest willow tree was uprooted from the center of the Chen House, and like a sharp arrow, it chased after Luo Xianxian, who was constantly dodging.However, Luo Xianxian's body was made of the Heart-Picking Willow. The Heart-Picking Willow, Tianwen, and ghost were all trees that the Gouchen Palace brought from the Realm of the Gods to the mortal world. For a moment, the Ten Thousand Coffins formed by Tianwen couldn't catch up with Luo Xianxian's petite and agile figure.Her bright red robe embroidered with golden phoenixes billowed in the wind like waves, and the giant willow tree grew taller and taller, piercing through the Bounded Domain and straight into the sky.The people outside the Bounded Domain were stunned by the wood. Some of the people with weak spiritual power couldn't stand it anymore, and their knees went soft under the pressure of the powerful guru's aura, and they fell to the ground with a thud.As the willow tree formed by the spirit of Tianwen grew taller and taller, Chu Wanning's spiritual power had been released to an unprecedented level. Some of the cultivators around the Colorful Butterfly Town were bleeding from their eyes, and even Nangong Si had difficulty breathing. His chest was tight and his heart was flustered.Nangong Si gritted his teeth, \"There's such a person at the peak of life and death?Elder Yu Heng? \"Li Wuxin calmed himself down. After all, he was the head of a village, so he could still stand it. He said, \"Young Master Nangong, this person is Chu Wanning!\"\"What?!\"Under such strong pressure, Nangong Si was suddenly shocked and spat out a mouthful of blood.\"It's \u2026 Grandmaster Chu?\"\"Young Master, don't say anymore.\"Seeing that he was injured, Ye Wangxi raised his hand and pressed two of Nangong Si's acupoints, and then transferred some spiritual power to him.Unexpectedly, Nangong Si didn't appreciate his kindness and suddenly broke free. He fiercely wiped the blood on his lips and said, \"Don't touch me.\"\"\u2026 \u2026\"\"Young Master Ye, let me do it.\"Song Qiutong was at the Butterfly Bone Beauty Seat, so she wasn't affected much. She stepped forward and looked at Ye Wangxi with a pair of delicate and timid eyes, and recommended herself in a low voice.Ye Wangxi wasn't as friendly as he was when they first met, and he didn't even pay attention to her.Qiutong was rebuffed by him, so she turned her head and looked at Nangong Si with watery eyes. Nangong Si's attitude towards her was much better than before, but he still said, \"I don't need your help.I'm just surprised because I haven't seen an old friend for many years.I'm not that weak. If you have time, go take care of others. \"On the other side, Mo Ran didn't notice the matter between Qiutong and Ru Feng on the other side.He had already returned to the side of Chu Wanning's body. He looked up and saw that Chu Wanning's soul and Luo Xianxian were fighting fiercely. Then he looked at the corpses that were temporarily sealed by thousands of willow trees, and he couldn't help but be frightened.It should be known that this kind of magic, even under normal circumstances, would consume a lot of spiritual power to use.Not to mention that Chu Wanning's soul was still in the out-of-body state.How unfathomable was this person's strength \u2026Before he finished thinking, he suddenly heard a loud scream.The withered vines of the Heart-Picking Willow were no match for Heaven's Inquisition. Luo Xianxian was bound by the willow vines under the lonely moon, and the lush branches and leaves soon swallowed her until she couldn't be seen. The towering tree wrapped her into a crack in the tree hole, and then the towering willow slowly lowered and finally reached the same height as the ordinary ancient trees.At this time, the enchantment was completely broken, but the coffin that Heaven's Inquisition turned into was still sealing the corpses, so it was not in danger for the time being.Xue Zhengyong didn't dare to relax, and ordered the rest of the people at the Peak of Life and Death to guard in front of each willow tree, just in case.The others followed the crowd and went straight to the courtyard of the Chen residence.Mo Ran didn't think too much because of the urgency of the situation. He carried Chu Wanning's cold body horizontally and also went there.When the crowd arrived, the ancient willow tree that sealed Luo Xianxian had become a real coffin. She was lying in it, and her face was sometimes ferocious and sometimes sad. Her eyes were sometimes fierce and sometimes sad.Her mouth kept changing between two kinds of voices, one was crazy, and she kept shouting, \"Why did you stop me!Why did you stop me!All of you should die!All of you should die! \"The other was weak and helpless, \"Brother Yama, is it you \u2026 is it you who came?Please \u2026 save me \u2026 I don't want to hurt anyone \u2026 please \u2026 \"The two kinds of voices alternated back and forth, and after a long time, the coffin was dead silent.At this time, the spiritual power of Chu Wanning's living soul was reaching its limit, and he couldn't hold on any longer. But he still relied on his mind and finally touched the forehead of the woman in the coffin.\"Who are you?\"The female ghost's closed eyes slowly opened, and they were still scarlet.Li Wuxin shouted, \"Oh no!\"He was about to rush forward and take Qingqing's life, but Chu Wanning touched him in the air, and a bolt of lightning fell, blocking his way.\"Chu Wanning, you \u2014!\"Chu Wanning ignored him, and stared at the delicate girl who was slowly sitting up in the coffin.She opened her blood-red eyes, but there was no murderous intent in them. Instead, she was confused and flustered, and she whispered, \"I am Luo Xianxian.\"When Chu Wanning heard her answer, he finally breathed a sigh of relief. His eyelashes drooped, and his soul dissipated.After a while, the man in Mo Ran's arms moved slightly. Mo Ran quickly put him down, and let him lean against the pillar. He knelt on one knee, and said, \"Shizun, you're back?\"Chu Wanning's phoenix eyes lost focus for a moment, and after a while, he slowly regained focus.He glanced at Mo Ran. He had used up a lot of spiritual power, and his spirit core was thin, so he looked a little weak. His face wasn't much better than when his soul left his body, and he was still as pale as before.\"Yes \u2026\" Chu Wanning responded, and leaned against the pillar for a while, then slowly got up.He walked slowly in front of Luo Xianxian, and lowered his eyes to look at her.Luo Xianxian opened her mouth slightly, and looked at him blankly, \"Brother Yama \u2026 why am I here?What, what happened? \"\"Let's not talk about other things.\"Although Chu Wanning was a little weak, his eyes were bright and sharp. He went straight to the point and asked, \"Tell me, who made this body for you?This is a very important matter, do you still remember? \"\"I \u2026\"Chu Wanning waited, and his fingernails almost broke on the pillar because of nervousness.\"I'm not very sure, but I have some impression \u2026\" Luo Xianxian murmured, \"It's a man, he \u2026 he \u2026\"Xue Meng was also anxious, \"Think again!\"Luo Xianxian tried hard to recall, \"I was in a daze at that time, and I didn't see his face clearly, but I heard his voice, and it sounded like a northern accent \u2026 I think \u2026 I think \u2026\"\"Ah!!\" She suddenly exclaimed, and her face was full of fear, \"I remember now!It's him!It's him!!!Tangerine!!Stealing tangerine!!! \"\"What tangerine stealing tangerine, what nonsense \u2026\" Xue Meng muttered.But Chu Wanning immediately understood \u2014 she was talking about the lunatic she met when she was young, who cut down the tangerine tree!There was a man in Linyi, and his heart was dead.Who was it \u2026Linyi, could it be the Confucian Wind Sect?It was \u2026But at this time, a sudden clap of thunder sounded in the sky, and the exquisite chessboard above Colorful Butterfly Town suddenly glowed red.Xue Zhengyong shouted, \"Oh no!\" He immediately shouted, \"Watch the Ten Thousand Coffin closely!!I'm afraid the person who set up the chessboard has found out and is about to make a move!!! \"Colorful Butterfly Town was instantly filled with sand and stones, and smoke and dust were everywhere.The cultivators were ready, and their backs were against each other, and their swords were in front of their chests.Chu Wanning's eyes darkened, and he said to Luo Xianxian, \"Get up!That person left a white chess piece in your body, so don't be controlled by him anymore. I'll expel it for you, and once the white chess piece falls, you'll leave immediately and reincarnate in the underworld. Don't stay in the mortal world for long! \"As he said, light gathered in his palm, and he hit Luo Xianxian's chest.However, he didn't feel the power of the white chess piece in the exquisite chessboard.Chu Wanning shuddered as a chill ran down his spine. In that split second, he sensed danger almost instinctively. He yelled at Luo Xianxian, \"Let's go!\"It was too late.\"Ah!!!!\"There was only a sharp scream.In the center of the exquisite chessboard in the sky, a bloody light shot down and hit Luo Xianxian's body made of willow vines.\"Boom!\"The fire covered the sky!\"Luo Xianxian!\"The girl's figure quickly became distorted in the sea of fire, and a wisp of fragrant soul rose to the sky and mixed with the scorched smoke.The soul and the smoke trembled, and the smoke and the soul merged.Where Luo Xianxian was standing, a green light array suddenly rose to the sky \u2014\"The essence of wood spirit?!\"In an instant, Chu Wanning's face turned pale, and his eyes were extremely fierce. He was wrong \u2014 he was wrong!!Luo Xianxian must have been a person with a high level of wood spirit when she was alive. The behind-the-scenes manipulator didn't use metal, fire, water, and earth to nourish the Heart-Picking Willow with wood attributes. Instead, he was waiting for the resentment to gather into thunder and hit Luo Xianxian, so that her resentment would become the source of the temporary life of the Heart-Picking Willow!Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, all five spirits.Whatever he wanted to do, he could do it now \u2026Chu Wanning looked up at the sky, and everyone looked up. The leaves were bleak, and for a moment, it was terrifyingly quiet.Then, all of a sudden.The earth trembled!!It was almost the same as the ancient city of Lin 'an that Mo Ran and the others saw in the illusion of the Peach Blossom Spring.Above the Colorful Butterfly Town, a huge purple-black crack was torn open, and it seemed to be wrapped in countless bloody storms, diseases, and pain. It slowly opened like a demon's eye.Li Wuxin pointed at the crack and shouted in a trembling voice, \"The boundary of the Avici Hell \u2014 the Avici Hell \u2014 is broken!!!!\"\"The sky above the Colorful Butterfly Town has cracked, and the gate of the Ghost Realm is open!!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Small holes were common and would not cause the cultivators to panic.However, at this time, a bloody eye pierced through the sky. In an instant, the sky changed color and sand and stones flew everywhere.It was the once-in-a-century Heaven's Split!Everyone present, except for Mo Ran, had never personally experienced such a calamity.Therefore, whether it was the white-haired Li Wuxin, the battle-hardened Xue Zhengyong, the Confucian Wind Sect of the Upper World of Cultivators, or the Life and Death Summit of the Lower World of Cultivators, the thousands of people present were all at a loss and did not know what to do.Mo Ran was even more shocked. A strong smell of blood seemed to come from his previous life. He grinded his teeth and sucked blood, killing people like flies \u2026It was this Heaven's Split!In her previous life, Shi Mo had died in this Heavenly Fissure. At that time, he and Chu Wanning had worked together to repair the enchantment. However, due to the lack of spiritual power, he was repelled by the thousands of ghosts that swarmed out and fell from the sky \u2026But that was clearly something that should have happened three years later!Mo Ran remembered that snowy night so clearly. New Year's Eve had just passed. The air was still filled with the faint smell of gunpowder, and there were still fragments of firecrackers on the snow.The night before, he stayed up with everyone and drank Tusu Wine.Mo Ran was slightly drunk and looked up.Under the warm candlelight, Shi Mei's eyes seemed to be filled with spring water. No matter which angle one looked at it, they were full of affection.The Life and Death Summit was very lively, toasting each other and laughing.At that time, he thought that this was really good. Even if he didn't disturb the person he liked, he could just watch and accompany her from afar for the rest of his life.After the banquet ended, the disciples returned home together.He and Shi Mei went back together from the Meng Po Lobby. The ground was covered with frost and snow, and the moonlight flowed. He saw that Shi Mei was a little cold, so he took off his outer robe and put it on his shoulders without saying anything.Because he was a little drunk, he carefully looked at him a few more times.The beauty was like new snow, so bright that he couldn't spit.\"Mo Ran.\"\"Yes.\"\"You drank a little too much today.\"\"Haha, is that so?\" Mo Ran laughed, but after a while, he suddenly couldn't laugh anymore.Shi Mei's slightly cold hands gently cupped his face, causing his burning cheeks to become even hotter. Mo Ran's eyes widened, and at that moment, he trembled slightly.Shi Mei smiled and said to him, \"Why not? Look at you, your face is red after drinking three cups of hot wine.\"\"Yes, it's hot.\"Mo Ran clumsily scratched his head, but his face burned even more.At that time, he was so satisfied. If he liked someone, he didn't have to get it. He didn't dare to think too much.That person had only touched his face, and he felt that he was already being treated kindly by the Heavens. He was so frightened that he couldn't say anything else, and could only stare blankly.His dark and warm eyes were filled with surprise and gratitude.The two of them said their goodbyes in front of the bedroom. When Shi Mei put on his coat and left, he turned his face to the side and smiled at him.\"Mo Ran.\"He was about to leave, but when he heard that, he hurriedly turned around like a spinning top, afraid that he would miss something.\"Yes, I'm here!\"\"Thank you for the coat.\"\"It's nothing!I'm hot anyway! \"\"There's more.\"Shi Mei's gaze became more and more gentle, and it was so warm that it could make a long winter pass. \"Mo Ran, actually I \u2026\"Bang.There was a firework explosion in the distance.Mo Ran didn't hear what he said, or maybe Shi Mei didn't continue at that time.When the surroundings quieted down, Shi Mei had already pushed open the door to his bedroom.Mo Ran was anxious, and hurriedly called out to him, \"Wait, what did you just say?\"It was rare for the other party to tease him, and he winked. \"I only say good things once.\"\"Shi Mei \u2014 \u2014\"But that seductive person still didn't fulfill Mo Ran's wish, and only half of her beautiful face was exposed under the warm curtain.There was also a faint smile that Mo Ran would never forget for the rest of his life.\"It's late, I'm going to sleep.If I still want to talk to you when you wake up tomorrow morning. \"He paused, and his soft eyelashes drooped like mimosas.\"I'll tell you again \u2026\"Unexpectedly, the sky cracked and the dawn came one after another.In the end, Mo Ran didn't hear Shi Mei's words, and the softest old dream of his life was dyed scarlet.Many times in the middle of the night, he still remembered Shi Mei's smiling face behind half of the warm curtain, so handsome, so gentle. He didn't know if it was his illusion, but he even felt that there was infinite affection.For the rest of his life, he continued to dream that long dream, over and over again, in pain.In the dream, Shi Mei told him that she liked him, and he woke up with a smile. He was so happy that he even forgot that Shi Mei was dead, and the past was forgotten.He smiled so happily, thinking about what to cook for his beloved in the future. Such an important matter was worth worrying about.But always, as he smiled, tears rolled down.He buried his face in his palms.That year on the snowy night of New Year's Eve, the words scattered in the wind, and he didn't know anymore.Thousands of miles of clouds broke, and the Infernal Hell opened.Countless evil spirits and evil spirits rushed out from the crack, like thousands of soldiers and horses rushing to attack the city.The screams around Mo Ran suddenly woke up from his memories.As if he had gone mad, he shouted anxiously in the chaotic, disorganized crowd and looked for them in panic.\"Shi Mei!!\"\"Shi Mei \u2014 \u2014!!Shi Mingjing!! \"\"Where are you?Where are you? \"I don't know why the sky cracked three years later suddenly came forward.I don't know if I can protect you now.But I can't watch you get hurt again, I can't watch you die again \u2026 \u2026I beg you to live \u2026 \u2026It's my fault, I wasn't strong enough to protect you immediately, I was too stupid, I didn't think of everything, where are you \u2026 \u2026\"Mo Ran \u2026 \u2026\"In the midst of the clashing of weapons, there was a vague voice, faintly heard.\"Shi Mei!!\"He saw him. Beside Xue Meng, he was using the Water Spirit as a shield, blocking the evil ghosts and dead souls that were pouncing over.Mo Ran almost didn't care and ran towards him, his voice choked, his eyes red.\"Dog, you, you come and help me!\"Xue Meng was one against ten, but the waves of zombies were like endless flowing water. His forehead gradually seeped with sweat, his silver teeth clenched, \"Come quickly!\"Without waiting for him to speak, Mo Ran leapt up, a red light flashed, the ghosts answered the call.His hand rose and the vines fell, the row of ghosts in front of him were scattered by the Divine Martial, instantly turning into fine powder.Mo Ran turned his head and shouted at Shi Mei: \"Don't go too far, come behind me!\"\"I want to help Shifu \u2026 \u2026\"\"Don't go!!!\" Mo Ran heard this, almost frightened!He definitely can't let Shi Mei get close to Chu Wanning in this chaotic battle.The scenes from his previous life kept overlapping with the scene in front of him.\u2014 \u2014 -back then, it was the same sentence.\"I want to help Shifu \u2026 \u2026\"\"Good, go quickly, Shifu will be safer, don't leave him, let him protect you\"How ridiculous \u2026 \u2026Let him protect you.Chu Wanning, Chu Wanning, Mo Ran calculated everything, but forgot that the person was Chu Wanning!Heartless, cold-blooded to the extreme.His heart and mind were filled with the people of the world, but he didn't care when his own disciple died!\"Don't go to him!He can handle it himself! \"The overlapping of the two lives made his scalp numb. Mo Ran's eyes were red, he angrily shouted at Shi Mei: \"Don't go anywhere, stay!\"\"But Shifu just used so much of his magic power \u2026 \u2026\"\"You won't die!Take care of yourself! \"As he said this, his eyebrows furrowed, and he fiercely whipped the zombies that were rolling towards him.In an instant, blood and flesh flew everywhere, brain matter splattered everywhere.Although his spiritual energy was far inferior to that of his previous life, his every move was skillful. This battle-hardened body had once fought with experts like Ye Wangxi and Chu Wanning. Even if there were millions of ferocious corpses, he was still fearless.The crack in the sky grew bigger and bigger.The ghosts that had been floating in the Avici Hell for hundreds of years poured into the human world like a storm, mixed in with the zombies of Colorful Butterfly Town that had broken free from the willow vines. The scene was getting crazier and more terrifying.It was like pouring water into a pot of boiling oil, boiling the sky. It was very lively.It was also like locusts pouncing on a field of grain, evil spirits grabbing living people and gnawing at them. The people at the peak of life and death were able to handle it because they had been fighting on a small scale in the past.However, the Confucian Wind Sect and the Jade Pool Manor were completely wiped out. Many cultivators cried out miserably, blood spurting several feet high!Chu Wanning was far away, Mo Ran couldn't see his situation for the time being.However, he inadvertently saw Ye Wangxi and Nangong Si in the rolling sea of people. Although the two didn't get along well, their fighting moves were shockingly similar.He saw Ye Wangxi abandon his long sword, his hand glowing with a blue light as he summoned a longbow. Nangong Si also drew a crescent moon. The two glanced at each other, passed each other, and rushed to the sides, aiming at the densest part of the zombies. They nocked an arrow, nocked the bow, and pulled the string.Whoosh!The two released their arrows almost at the same time, white feathers splitting the air, and the sound was like the cry of a wild goose.The arrows were quenched, and wind blades were scattered everywhere. Wherever they passed, evil spirits were torn apart and strangled...Nangong Si revealed a proud expression and reached for the quiver on his back to draw an arrow.However, he didn't expect to find anything.\"That's it?\"\"Here.\"Before he could get angry, Ye Wangxi threw a bunch of white-feathered arrows to him.\"You don't want to bring more.\"\"... Hmph!\"Nangong Si snorted, but the situation was critical, and he didn't have the mood to put on airs with Ye Wangxi. He caught the arrows, and the two sank back into their respective battles.In the blink of an eye, an hour had passed. Although many evil spirits were repelled, there were even more coming from the Ghost Realm.Li Wuxin killed more than ten evil spirits with a single slash of his sword, then turned to Xue Zhengyong and shouted, \"We can't continue like this, we can't hold on.Get someone to fix the barrier! \"Xue Zhengyong glanced at the distance of Colorful Butterfly Town. There were four golden light arrays in four directions.He gasped for breath and said angrily, \"Easy for you to say. Can you fix this barrier?Do you have anyone here who knows how to fix it? \"\"I \u2014\" Li Wuxin said with a dark expression, \"Barrier techniques aren't my sect's expertise.\"\"Then shut the f * ck up!How many Yuhengs do you think you have?Chu Wanning is guarding the four positions. Otherwise, these evil spirits will rush out of the encirclement and quickly kill their way through the entire Sichuan region. If the cultivators can't hold on, then won't the non-cultivators be done for? \"\"It's better for Sichuan to be destroyed than for the Cultivation World to be in chaos. If you don't get someone to fix the Heavenly Fissure, I'm afraid this matter will be difficult to resolve!\"Xue Zhengyong was furious. He swung his iron fan, and when the wind slashed at the evil spirits, it also seemed to inadvertently graze Li Wuxin's cheek. \"Do you think the Upper Cultivation World is so precious that the Lower Cultivation World is born to die for you?\"\"Don't talk nonsense!I'm talking about sacrificing the pawn to protect the cart!If this Heavenly Fissure happened in my Blue Pool Village, I would also sacrifice my entire sect to protect the peace of the world! \"\"How arrogant. Villa Master Li, it's easy for you to say that.\"Xue Zhengyong's eyes widened. He was so angry that he laughed. \"The entrance to the Ghost World is in Sichuan. It won't move to your Blue Pool Village for thousands of generations. It seems that the peak of life and death can be destroyed thousands of times to protect the peace of the world!Villa Master Li, you really know how to talk. \"The two of them were fighting and arguing at the same time. Suddenly, they saw a snow-colored light sweeping over from the western sky.Before they could see clearly whether it was a friend or a foe, they heard the fine and compact sound of a zither coming from the clouds. The sound was like a storm falling from the sky, but also like thousands of arrows piercing through the forest. They didn't see any weapons, but they felt that the shadows of swords and knives were everywhere. The cries of armored horses filled the city.\"Kunlun Trampling Snow Palace!\"Xue Zhengyong suddenly raised his head and looked at the rolling snow-colored light. When it got closer, he saw that it was a group of immortals riding on swords. They were wearing snow-colored silk clothes and had peach blossom petals floating around them.Regardless of whether they were men or women, they all looked very gentle and beautiful. Because of their mental cultivation method, they all looked like they were in their early twenties.The people of the Trampling Snow Palace were either standing or sitting. Half of them were holding a pipa in their arms, and the other half were holding a guqin in front of their knees. The noisy and clear music flowed down from the sky, making the evil spirits and zombies all over the ground cry out in pain. However, it was as if they were trapped in an inescapable net and couldn't escape.The leader was a man with light blonde hair, jade eyes, and deep facial features.He wore snow-colored silk clothes with a droplet of water on his forehead. His slender neck stuck out from the collar, like a flower in a porcelain vase.It was cold in the snow of Kunlun. He wore a fox fur coat on top of his plain clothes, which made him look even more calm and graceful.This person also held an exquisite pipa in his arms. He frowned and twisted the strings with his long and slender fingers. Countless bright peach blossoms danced around him in the sound of his zither.\"The Four Seas Royal Style is passed by, a thousand years of virtue is clear, and military clothes are not worn. Today, I have succeeded.\"The sound of the zither slowed down slightly. He lowered his eyes and saw Xue Zhengyong and the others. Just as he was about to say something, he suddenly heard a person in the distance angrily shout, \"Mei Hanxue!Why is it you dog!? \"The person who shouted was Xue Meng.As he shouted angrily, he rushed under Mei Hanxue's sword. He raised his head and scolded, \"Why did the Kunlun Trampling Snow Palace send such an unreliable thing like you to help?\"Ye Wangxi heard the sound and turned around. When he saw the man playing the zither, he was also angry.\"\u2026 It's him?\"Nangong Si: \"What?\"You know this one too? \"\"I don't know him.\"Ye Wangxi was not happy to see Mei Hanxue, but Xue Meng rushed up to scold him. He turned around and left, only leaving behind a sentence, \"It's just a fight.\"Nangong Si was interested. \"Oh, how is his skill?\"\"Heh.\" Ye Wangxi sneered. \"He relies on women to fight. What do you think?\"Nangong Si: \"\u2026\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was no wonder that Ye Wangxi looked down on him. This Mei Hanxue was precisely the \"Eldest Senior Brother\" that had attracted countless female cultivators to fight over him.He originally thought that the one who came was powerful, but who would have thought that it was a pretty boy who relied on his appearance to make a living. Nangong Si immediately lost interest and turned around to kill the enemy.Mei Hanxue glanced at Xue Meng. His eyes revealed some helplessness, but he did not pay attention to him. Instead, he lowered his eyebrows and casually plucked the zither strings several times. The hundred cultivators of the Treading Snow Palace heard the zither music and scattered in all directions.\"Zither Division, play the Twinkling Brilliance Song; Pipa Division, perform the Array Breaking Dance.\"Following his orders, those who were playing the zither and strings instantly changed the movements under their hands. Countless rapid sounds of metal and stone converged in midair, resounding through the clouds.For a moment, the ghosts were confused and confused. They actually stopped fighting and stretched their necks in place, looking around blankly.When Li Wuxin saw this, he remembered that not only were the people of the Treading Snow Palace good at music, they also knew how to repair barriers. He was overjoyed. He raised his head and shouted, \"Nephew Mei, do you know how to repair the Heavenly Fissure?\"Mei Hanxue did not care that his \"Nephew Mei\" was disgusting. He only replied, \"The Endless Hell's Heavenly Fissure is not something that can be repaired with my strength.\"\"Ah, this \u2026\" Li Wuxin's face paled. In the end, he flicked his sleeves and sighed, \"Ai!\"\"Hanxue, can you guard the barrier on all sides of the Colorful Butterfly Town?\"The one who spoke was Xue Zhengyong. Because the Peak of Life and Death had always been on good terms with the Treading Snow Palace, Mei Hanxue saw a familiar elder. He first hugged his pipa and bowed, then said, \"I can try.\"\"That's great!\" Xue Zhengyong clapped his hands and said, \"You go guard the barrier on all sides. Don't let the ghosts rush outside.Then call Yu Heng back \u2014 \"\"Elder Yu Heng?\"\"Ah, look at my memory. I forgot that you've never seen Yu Heng before.But it doesn't matter. You'll know when you get there. He's the one who's guarding the barrier. \"\"Good.\" Mei Hanxue was quite calm. She tilted her sword and flew towards the edge of Colorful Butterfly Town like a meteor.Nangong Si nocked three arrows and shot them in three different directions. Amidst the buzzing of the bowstring, he saw Mei Hanxue fluttering like a startled swan and the Ta Xue Gong people using the sound of the guqin to confuse the enemy. He could not help but be startled. He said to Ye Wangxi, \"This person's strength is so outstanding, how can you say that he is a gigolo who relies on women to fight?\"\"\u2026\"Ye Wangxi was also quite puzzled, but right now the ghosts were moving slowly, so it was a good opportunity to kill them. Therefore, he did not think too much about it. He only told Nangong Si, \"Probably at that time he did not use his full strength.\" And then he focused on killing the enemy and did not say anything else.Among the ten great sects, four of them had already arrived. They were no longer battered and exhausted when dealing with the Heaven's Fissure, but it was still very strenuous.Although the dead souls on the ground were frozen by the zither music of the Treading Snow Palace, there were even more ferocious howls gushing out from the bloody eyes of the ghost world.The people of the Treading Snow Palace were all standing in mid-air, and when they played the music, they could not divert their hands to protect themselves. Therefore, the evil spirits rushed towards the Pipa Formation and the Guqin Formation in the four directions of the clouds.The people of the Treading Snow Palace had no choice but to divert some of them to play the music of the defensive formation.Therefore, the sound of the exorcism music of the enemy was weakened by a lot. The evil spirits on the ground immediately surged up like anxious ants.What was even more frightening was that as the gate of the ghost world opened wider, some of the high-ranking evil spirits who were shackled actually broke free from their shackles because they had absorbed a large amount of Yang energy from the human world. They rushed into the mortal world with a loud bang.These evil spirits were different from before. Their corpses and resentful spirits merged into one. They were more ferocious and their spiritual power was stronger. Ordinary cultivators could not stop them at all. There were even some disciples who were alone who were flipped over by their palms. Their white bony claws suddenly pierced into the living person's chest and lungs \u2026\"Poof!\"Blood splattered everywhere. The hearts of the cultivators that were full of spiritual power were eaten by these high-ranking evil spirits. The blood flowed down the evil spirits' rotten faces continuously.With the remnants of flesh and blood in their mouths, the evil spirits' strength was even stronger. They fiercely rushed into the crowd, like a cheetah looking for a new prey to bite.In an instant, it was chaos!Xue Zhengyong shouted, \"Stay in formation and don't run around. Don't be alone!\"However, there were still people who were panicking and crying as they fled in all directions.The smell of blood in the air was getting heavier and heavier. The evil spirits were like a tide, and the dead people were like a tide \u2026Nangong Si was drawing his bow and fighting to his heart's content. Suddenly, a hanged ghost stuck out its blood-red tongue and wrapped around his waist. Its sharp claws pierced toward his chest.Ye Wangxi was far away. When he turned around, his usually calm face instantly turned pale \u2026\"Ah Si!!\"\"Master!\"At the critical moment, Song Qiutong held her sword and rushed over. She fiercely stabbed into the hanged ghost's arm.However, she had never killed a human before, let alone such a ferocious evil spirit. She was so shocked that she let go of her sword when she stabbed it. The long sword fell to the ground with a clang.The hanged ghost furiously swung an attack at her. Nangong Si put away his bow and changed to a sword. He blocked in front of her and shouted, \"Stay away. Quickly leave.\"Song Qiutong's eyes were glistening with tears. She said, \"Qiutong's life was saved by the Confucian Wind School. How can I leave now \u2026\"Nangong Si was not good at dealing with women, but when he saw her delicate posture and firm gaze, his heart was moved. He could not help but curse inwardly, \"Ye Wangxi!!\"\"Ye Wangxi!Get your ass over here!Protect her well! \"Ye Wangxi was bathed in blood. His handsome face was full of stains. He grabbed Song Qiutong's arm and sternly said, \"Go find Martial Brother Qin. Don't run around.\"\"I won't go. I can still help.\" She begged, \"Young Master, I want to stay by your side.\"\"Ye Wangxi, protect her!\"Ye Wangxi's expression instantly became very unsightly. He was such a gentleman, so it was rare for him to show such an angry expression.\"Nangong Si.\" Every word between his teeth was trembling and broken. \"I think you've lost your mind.\"After he finished speaking, he no longer paid attention to the two of them. Holding his sword, he swept away and hid in the rolling tide of corpses.More and more high level evil spirits appeared. They blended into the crowd like a sharp knife cutting through the belly of a fish, peeling off its scales. The sticky and shiny scales were dyed with dark red strands of blood, floating up and down.Everyone was unable to fend for themselves. The evil spirits surrounded the living people, wanting to tear them apart and swallow them into their stomachs, dragging them into the endless hell.Mo Ran, Xue Meng, and Shi Mei had their backs against each other, blocking the evil spirits from all sides. However, the circle was getting narrower and narrower. With a swoosh, Xue Meng chopped off the arm of an evil spirit, tainting its blood with a ruler.The evil spirits attacking saw that this person was tyrannical, so they circled around him and pounced on Shi Mei. Shi Mei formed a seal with both hands, but because his strength was gradually weakening, the Aqua Light Formation dimmed and brightened \u2026Seeing that it was difficult to resist, Mo Ran steeled his heart and said, \"Shi Mei, you open a defensive formation. Xue Meng, hide inside.\"\"What?\" Xue Meng was furious when he heard this. \"You want me to be a coward?\"\"Listen to me and hide inside!What kind of situation is this, and you still want to compete? How can we kill so many evil spirits? \"Shi Mei said, \"Mo Ran, what are you going to do?\"\"Don't ask too many questions. Just do as I say.\" Mo Ran softened his tone. \"It's okay.\"The encirclement gradually narrowed. Mo Ran urged, \"Hurry up, it'll be too late if we don't.\"Shi Mei had no choice but to change the spell talisman and raise a blue defensive light formation, enveloping himself and Xue Meng.When Mo Ran saw that he had formed the formation, he suddenly pulled out an arrow from his sleeve. He wiped his palm and sprinkled his blood on the formation, leaving his own spiritual power behind.Then, his eyes burned and he shouted, \"Why aren't you working?!\"When the evil spirits heard him, their flames grew brighter. Every willow leaf was wrapped in blood-red spiritual power, like a sharp knife that fell on the vine. The whole willow vine suddenly grew ten feet long. Mo Ran closed his eyes. In his mind, he saw the appearance of Chu Wanning using his killing moves several times. When he opened his eyes again, his eyes reflected the sinister faces of countless evil spirits.He held the evil spirits and struck them in the air. Sparks exploded and splashed everywhere.Mo Ran raised his hand, and his clothes fluttered.At that moment, his figure seemed to overlap with Chu Wanning's figure in his mind. The two people's movements were almost identical.\"Wind.\"Unstoppable!The clouds were rushing and the sky was low!The two people behind Mo Ran only saw a huge scarlet light formation like a red lotus from hell blooming. A strong wind passed through the ground like thousands of invisible blades. The evil spirits in Mo Ran's hands danced like shadows. Wherever they passed, sand and gravel flew. Countless evil spirits were swept up by this shocking airflow and were instantly crushed into minced meat!Chu Wanning's Heaven's Inquisition's \"Wind\".Mo Ran had actually learned ninety percent of it \u2026The fierce wind gradually stopped. The surroundings were vast, and there were no corpses left. Not a single piece of armor was left.Looking back, Xue Meng and Shi Mei's faces were full of astonishment. Mo Ran did not have time to be happy. He only felt that his daily learning was far from enough. If he could immediately return to his past cultivation, this small gap in the World of Spirits and Souls would not be so difficult for them.\"Look over there!\"Suddenly, someone shouted from afar.Everyone looked up at the same time. They saw several sword formations in different clothes and spiritual power coming from several directions in the sky.The Heaven's Fissure of the Avici Hell finally alarmed all the sects in the Upper Cultivation World. As the light swords fell to the ground, the people of Lin Ling Island were beautiful and elegant, and the masters of Wubei Temple were solemn and dignified \u2026 All kinds of things were overwhelming.The people of the Ten Great Sects finally arrived.More powerful evil spirits were still being born, like endless locusts. However, with the sudden increase of cultivators, the situation gradually became less disadvantageous.At the same time, Mei Hanxue and Chu Wanning's spiritual power exchange was finally completed. The enchantment in the four directions of north, south, east, and west changed from gold to blue.The edge was guarded by Mei Hanxue. Chu Wanning flew with the wind and swept to the center of the fierce battle.He looked up at the crack in the sky that had been completely opened. There was some kind of huge and terrifying evil force behind it.Chu Wanning could almost feel the madness of that power, as if it had drunk thousands of blood plasma and the brains of hundreds of millions of creatures \u2026If the enchantment was not sealed, he was afraid that some kind of evil spirit suppressed in the Avici Hell would break free from its restraint and come to the human world!Chu Wanning could not help but think, could it be that the person behind the scenes wanted to release some kind of evil spirit from purgatory into the world of mortals?But what did he want?\"Master!\"Shi Mei anxiously called him.Chu Wanning heard the voice and turned his face.The scene from his previous life overlapped again.\"Master!\"At that time, Shi Mei also called him like this.Chu Wanning heard the voice and turned his face.Shi Mei gasped for breath in the snow. His body was covered in blood, but his eyes were firm. \"Master is going to repair this crack in the sky?\"\"Yes.\"\"But this \u2026 This is not an ordinary crack in the sky. This is the crack in the Avici Hell. Master, how can you resist it alone?\"\"\u2026\"\"I'm here to lend Master a hand.I've learned the defensive technique in the Peach Blossom Spring, so I won't drag Master down \u2026 \"The conversation between the two of them years ago that decided life and death seemed to be in his ears.Mo Ran was frightened and his scalp was going numb. He suddenly pulled Shi Mei behind him and stuffed him to Xue Meng. He said loudly, \"Xue Ziming, look after him!Look after him! \"Xue Meng opened his eyes wide. \"Dog, where are you going?\"\"I \u2026\"The wind blew, and the smell of blood filled the air.There was no snow in the sky. Everything was different from his previous life.Mo Ran's eyes fell on Shi Mei, who was at a loss. He felt sad and relieved.It was impossible for Chu Wanning to fix this barrier on her own.But other than his disciples, no one knew Chu Wanning's spiritual energy cultivation method and could cooperate with him perfectly. Therefore, one of them had to go through this tribulation.The north wind is angry, and thousands of miles of killing intent.Mo Ran suddenly made up his mind and hugged Shi Mei. For the first time, he directly held him in his arms. He paused for a moment and then suddenly pushed him away.Shi Mei.The person who will die this time is probably me.\"I'm going to help Master seal the barrier.\" Mo Ran said firmly. His tone was resolute.He narrowed his eyes and looked deeply at Shi Mei.Suddenly, he didn't want to care about what other people thought of him. He didn't care that Xue Meng was right next to him. He didn't care that he would be rejected. He waited for two lifetimes, loved two lifetimes. Now he was going to leave, and maybe he wouldn't be able to come back.He stood in the wind, wanting to say a few words to his beloved one.\"Shi Mei, actually I \u2026\"But when he was about to open his mouth, the howls of evil spirits and evil beasts drowned out his voice.The urge to roll over and over like molten lava gradually cooled down in this stagnation, and finally stopped.\"Mo Ran, what do you want to say?\"Mo Ran suddenly saw the reflection of his previous life. Under the warm curtains, he saw Shi Mei's gentle and smiling face.How cruel.He remembered it all his life, from birth to death, from heaven to hell.Mo Ran's eyes were slightly red, but he smiled.\"Nothing, I won't say it twice.\"Shi Mei, \"You \u2026\"\"I'm going to help Master. When I come back \u2026 if I still want to tell you.\" His dimples were deep, and his eyes were full of affection. \"I'll tell you again \u2026\"After saying this, he turned around and rushed toward Chu Wanning.Shi Mei wouldn't die.At least, he wouldn't die in front of him.Mo Ran suddenly felt that the sky was high and the earth was wide. The figure in white fluttering in front of him was probably the end of his rebirth in this life.His Master had always been magnanimous.When Shi Mei died, Chu Wanning chose to leave in order to complete the final gap. In order to purge those demons and monsters that ran amok.This time, he was the one who had to build the barrier.Chu Wanning despised and hated him so much. He wouldn't give up his reputation as the Northern Dipper Celestial Venerable to help an insignificant person die.\"Master.\"He stood in front of him.A ghostly light appeared in his hand.\"This barrier is difficult to fix. Let me help you.\"The situation was dangerous. Chu Wanning glanced at him and didn't say anything, which was a tacit agreement.He leaped into the sky and stood at the corner of the eaves of Chen Manor. Mo Ran followed him and leaped up.Chu Wanning said, \"Set up the formation and observe.\"Mo Ran followed his instructions and raised his hand at the same time. The two of them stood on the left and right, and the tips of their fingers condensed the seal of the Observation Barrier. They slowly raised their hands.\"Open the formation!\"Along with this shout, the two people's spiritual power suddenly surged out from their bodies. They each stood at the foot of the formation and joined hands to forge, using their surging cultivation to condense into a constantly expanding golden-red barrier.When the barrier came into contact with the evil spirits that had just surged out, the evil spirits seemed to be burned by a raging fire. They screamed and retreated into the eyes of the Ghost Realm. The barrier became clearer and clearer, and the light formation became more and more dazzling. Two coiling dragon platforms condensed from spiritual spells rose under Chu Wanning and Mo Ran's feet, dragging the two of them to the highest point in the sky.The ghost eyes slowly closed under the pressure of the golden-red light formation, but they seemed to be unwilling, and the evil spirits inside became more intense.Every inch they closed, the evil spirits surging out of them became more and more intense. When the two of them were only a few miles away from the barrier's crack, the evil spirits inside were almost solid.After Mo Ran's reborn body, he gradually felt as if there was a million pounds of weight on his shoulders, and as if there was a huge rock pressing down on his chest, making it difficult for him to breathe.On the other side, Chu Wanning's spiritual power was steady and strong, continuously flowing out.Inch by inch, and another inch by inch.The evil winds between heaven and earth gathered in one place, turning into sharp blades, cutting every inch of his skin, flesh, bones, and blood.\"Master \u2026\"As his consciousness gradually blurred, he seemed to see the scene of the past.Shi Mei and Chu Wanning worked together to repair the formation, and the two worlds of Yin and Yang closed in only a moment. Those evil spirits who were unable to return to the mortal world saw that Shi Mei's power was weak, so they all gathered in one place, and attacked Shi Mei.\"Bang!\"In just a moment, Shi Mei, who was doing his best to maintain the balance of the barrier, was pierced through!It was like a reenactment, almost nothing had changed.Only this time, the person who was struck by the ten thousand evil spirits was Mo Ran.At the crack in the sky, the black evil spirits pierced through the clouds, and in an instant, pierced through Mo Ran's chest. Mo Ran only saw a smear of blood in front of his eyes, and when he came back to his senses, he realized that it was the hot blood gushing out of his chest.In this stifling air flow, he turned his face with difficulty, only to see that Chu Wanning's clothes were as white as snow, his expression solemn and cold. He didn't even spare him half a glance.His chest suddenly surged with countless grievances.In the end, the hatred was deep.He fell from the coiled dragon high platform, blood seeped out of the corner of his mouth, and his chest was burning red.Falling down was actually very fast, but suddenly it felt so long, like a drowning person gradually sinking to the bottom of the sea, no longer able to hear the whispers of the mortal world.Chu Wanning, did not raise his hand to greet him.Did not stop him.Did not even divert his attention to look at him.When he fell, the red spiritual power suddenly disappeared. Chu Wanning, just like in his previous life, chose to use all of his spells, and single-handedly closed the barrier that Mo Ran had not yet completed \u2014 \u2014Suddenly, it was sealed!However, the evil spirits that were left in the human world lost the nourishment of the Yin Qi in the ghost world. They instinctively felt anxious and became more and more violent. They became angry and made enemies with the cultivators. In just the blink of an eye, the formations of many sects were defeated.Chu Wanning fell from the sky.When Mo Ran fell, the coiled dragon pillar below formed a layer of light to protect him, so when he fell to the ground, he did not shatter into pieces.But his entire chest was penetrated by evil spirits, and blood flowed all over the ground, but it was no different from Shi Mei in the past.Chu Wanning pushed back the evil spirits that were rushing towards Mo Ran, and put down a barrier to protect Mo Ran.\"Master \u2026 \u2026\"The person behind him seemed to murmur softly.\"Are you leaving \u2026 \u2026\"Mo Ran coughed up blood, but there was a smile on his face.\"Are you leaving again?\"Outside the flowing golden barrier, that person's figure was still standing with his back to him. Mo Ran opened his mouth, but a mouthful of blood suddenly surged up in his throat.\"Chu Wanning, are you made of wood?You won't be sad, you have no selfish motives, right \u2026 \u2026 \"\"Chu Wanning \u2026 \u2026\"\"Chu Wanning \u2026 \u2026\"He felt that his vision was getting blurrier and blurrier. After the fierce battle, he was already full of injuries. Somewhere on his forehead was cut, and blood flowed down to his eyes. As he looked up to the sky and laughed wantonly, almost crazily, tears of blood rolled down his face.He choked up and said, \"Chu Wan-ning, turn around!Look at me \u2026 \u2026 are you still leaving \u2026 \u2026 \"Look at me one more time.I'm going to die.Back then, you at least looked at Shi Mei one last time.You \u2026 \u2026Is it true \u2026 \u2026You don't like me at all?You don't like me at all?Otherwise, why didn't you look at me one last time? Why didn't you turn back?\"Master \u2026 \u2026\"Tears of blood filled his eyes.His last impression was of the white-robed man walking away alone outside the golden enchantment.He went to suppress evil.So, in his heart, anyone in the world \u2026 \u2026 was more important than Mo Weiyu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Mo Ran, Mo Ran.\"Someone seemed to be calling him.He vaguely opened his eyes, a snow-white figure reflected in his hazy vision. He vaguely felt that this person was very similar to Chu Wanning, but he didn't dare to believe it. He only felt that person's hands were folded over his chest, continuously transferring spiritual energy to the place where his blood was flowing.So warm \u2026 \u2026Who is it?He blinked his eyes hard, trying to see that too blurry figure.\"Mo Ran \u2026 \u2026\"\"Ma, Shizun?\"He swallowed the blood in his throat, muttering to himself.Warm drops of water dripped onto his cheeks. Gradually, he saw clearly. The person in front of him had a pair of phoenix eyes like apricot flowers in Jiangnan. His face was pale and stained with blood.Mo Ran stared at him in a daze. He had never seen such an expression on Chu Wanning's face before.His Shizun had always been indifferent, but the person in front of him was crying.Mo Ran reached out, wanting to touch. He wanted to know if this was real or an illusion of a person about to die.But when his fingertips were a few inches away from that person's face, he stopped.Sometimes, hating a person was a habit.If he suddenly stopped hating them, he would be at a loss.He didn't dare touch it.He was afraid it was real.He was also afraid it was fake.He saw mountains of corpses and seas of blood behind Chu Wanning. He didn't know if it was Colorful Butterfly Town after a fierce battle, or if he was already in Asura Hell.He knew that he had committed many evil deeds. Even death couldn't wipe out his crimes. After his life was gone, he would fall into the abyss, never to be reincarnated.But Chu Wanning \u2026 \u2026He was a kind person.Why would he accompany him and be trapped in Avici forever?\"There is one last point.\"Chu Wanning's voice seemed to come from the deep sea, so hazy. \"You can't fall asleep, otherwise \u2026 \u2026\"He saw blood seeping out of Chu Wanning's mouth.The golden light became brighter and brighter. Suddenly, the person in front of him was covered by the light and turned into a child.\"Otherwise, I, Yu Heng, will no longer have a disciple like you.\"\"Junior Xia!\"Seeing Chu Wanning turn into Xia Si Ni with his own eyes, Mo Ran was extremely shocked. His wound suddenly hurt, and without thinking, he fainted again.\"Mo Ran.\"That gentle voice that was almost like a sigh was not an illusion from his previous life, but a whisper that he left in his ears.\"I'm sorry, it's Master's fault \u2026\"This sentence again!This sentence again!Chu Wanning, I don't want you to admit your mistake. I want you to \u2026How was it?Suddenly, he paused, not knowing what to think.If he didn't want him to admit his mistake, then what should he do?He suddenly opened his eyes and gasped for breath.Mo Ran's clothes were soaked with sweat. He looked up and saw a clean and tidy room without too many decorations.He was already lying in the bedroom of the Peak of Life and Death.He was actually still alive \u2026He looked around in disbelief. He raised his slightly cold hand and touched the wound on his chest.It was wrapped in a thick bandage, and blood was seeping through the bandage. It hurt to touch it, but under the bandage, the heart was still beating. It was so strong, surging with the ecstasy of surviving a disaster.He was still alive.He was still alive!!Blood flowed crazily in the young body, shaking his soul. His fingertips trembled.Suddenly, he heard the sound of the warm curtains rolling up. Mo Ran sat on the bed and looked up. He saw a beauty who opened the curtains and came in. Maybe it was because it was a little cold outside, he was wearing a white fur robe. His black hair was hanging down, and his soft eyes were slightly raised. His tail was dyed red, and it was better than many rouge colors.Shi Mei did not expect Mo Ran to be awake. He was shocked, and then said, \"Mo Ran?You, you \u2026 \"\"Shi Mei!Shi Mei! \"Mo Ran called him a few times. His eyes were very bright, shining like obsidian. He jumped off the bed, and did not care about the pain of his wound. He grimaced and jumped over to Shi Mingjing and hugged her tightly. He was overjoyed.\"That's great!You're not dead!I'm not dead either!It's over, it's all over! \"This Heaven's Split was a great disaster in his previous life. Demons and monsters fell from the sky, took away Shi Mei, and pushed Mo Ran into the abyss of evil.After he was reborn, he was anxious about this chaos. He was afraid that he would repeat the same mistake. In the end, he would be alone again, stepping on the bones of his loved ones, and walk alone to the empty Shaman Mountain Palace.But the heavens did not treat him badly. When he stood up and was willing to die for Shi Mei, everything changed.He would no longer be alone. He would no longer be betrayed by his loved ones. He would no longer be forced to go to Liangshan at night and become a lone traveler. From now on, the curse was broken.He had truly gotten rid of the nightmare of his previous life. He had truly been reborn.Mo Ran hugged Shi Mei for a long time before letting go. His eyes were so bright that they seemed to be filled with twinkling stars.Shi Mei was still standing in the same place in a daze until Mo Ran put his arm around his shoulder and looked down at him with a smile. After a long time, he gradually came back to his senses. He stretched out his forehead and actually took the initiative to touch Mo Ran's chin.\"Mo Ran.\"\"Yes, yes.\"When Shi Mei raised his head again, there was a faint smile on his face, but his eyes were a little wet.\"Fortunately, you're still alive.\"Mo Ran smiled and rubbed his head. He held his hand and said, \"Idiot, how could anything happen to me?I \u2026 \"He wanted to say more, but suddenly, someone outside lifted the curtain and strode in.\"Xue Meng?\"\"\u2026 \u2026\" Xue Meng was really a narrow-minded person. Probably because his limelight was stolen during the exorcism at Colorful Butterfly Town, his face was inevitably gloomy and his lips were tightly pursed.Seeing that Mo Ran had woken up, he only paused for a moment. Then he turned to Shi Mei and said, \"When did he wake up?\"Shi Mei hesitated for a moment before speaking. His tone was a little worried. \"Just now.\"\"\u2026 \u2026 Yes.\" Xue Meng responded. He was still unwilling to look at Mo Ran.Mo Ran thought that a child would always be a child. Being in the limelight was like being robbed of candy. His face did not look good for a long time.However, he was in a good mood and did not want to bicker with Xue Meng. Instead, he smiled and said, \"It seems that I've been unconscious for a long time. Who brought me back?\"\"Who else could it be.\" Xue Meng swung his sleeves and put his hands behind his back. His expression was very bad. \"Wasn't it Shizun?\"\"Ah.\"Hearing this, Mo Ran was stunned. When he was unconscious, bits and pieces flashed in front of his eyes. However, when he woke up, he was surprised and happy. He was even more uncertain whether the things he saw were real or not.He pondered, \"Shizun \u2026 \u2026 Junior Martial Brother Xia \u2026 \u2026\"Hearing him say this, Xue Meng's body trembled slightly. Then he stiffly said, \"You saw it?\"\"What?\"\"Junior Martial Brother Xia is Shizun.\"Mo Ran was just guessing. Now that he suddenly heard this, he could not help but turn pale. \"What!!\"Xue Meng suddenly turned his head. His expression was strange, as if he was trying to suppress something. \"What?I thought you already knew. \"Mo Ran exclaimed, \"How could I know!When I was unconscious \u2026 \u2026 I vaguely saw the two of them alternating \u2026 \u2026 I \u2026 \u2026 \"He thought of the company he had with Xia Sini in the Peach Blossom Spring. The two of them slept on the same bed. He also thought of the golden hairpin that fell out of Chu Wanning's lapel when he was unable to control himself at Lin Ling Island.The begonia handkerchief.The clothes that changed size according to one's body.The pot of soup in Xia Sini's hands.He looked up and called him Senior Martial Brother. Xia Sini patted his head and said with a smile that they would be brothers in the future. Senior Martial Brother will dote on you.These things gathered and scattered in front of him like smoke. One moment, it was Chu Wanning's indifferent face. The next moment, it was Xia Sini's silent appearance.He had said in front of Xia Sini that Chu Wanning was not good and did not like him.He had also patiently combed Xia Sini's long hair.The hair was so soft that it flowed between his fingers like ink.Thinking about it carefully, they were indeed so similar \u2026 \u2026Mo Ran felt like his head was about to explode. He played around in circles and muttered, \"Shizun is Junior Martial Brother Xia \u2026 \u2026 Shizun is Junior Martial Brother Xia \u2026 \u2026 Shizun is \u2026 \u2026\"He came to an abrupt halt, almost frantically.\"What kind of joke is this!How can Shizun be Junior Martial Brother Xia!! \"\"Mo Ran \u2026 \u2026\"Mo Ran did not know whether to laugh or cry. \"They, they are very similar in many ways, but \u2026 \u2026 but they are still not the same.Junior Martial Brother Xia is such a good person, how can \u2014 \u2014 \"\"What do you mean?\"Xue Meng suddenly interrupted Mo Ran's words and stared at his opponent's face with a pair of sharp eyes.\"Junior Martial Brother Xia is such a good person?Why, can't such a good person be Shizun? \"Mo Ran said, \"Of course I'm not saying that Shizun is not good.It's just that Junior Martial Brother Xia has always been sincere to me. I already see him as my own brother. You suddenly tell me that he is Shizun, how can I accept \u2026 \u2026 \"Xue Meng said angrily, \"Junior Martial Brother Xia is sincere, but Shizun is fake?\"Hearing the impending storm in his voice, Shi Mei hurriedly pulled on his sleeve.\"Young Master, think about what Uncle told you!Mo Ran just woke up, and \u2026 \u2026 \"Xue Meng suddenly shook off Shi Mei's hand. His brown eyes were still fixed on Mo Ran's face. The veins on his neck were slightly trembling because of his anger. He was like a hissing snake, ready to bite its prey at any time.\"Mo Weiyu, you better tell me clearly today. Why can't Shizun be Xia Sini?Why can't he be sincere, hm?Tell me, why is he fake in your heart?! \"Mo Ran was annoyed by his relentless questioning. This was not the first time he had seen Xue Meng's angry face. In his previous life, when he had become the Emperor Ta, every time he saw Xue Meng, he would have such a bad temper.He couldn't help but feel annoyed. He frowned and said, \"This is between me and him. Why do you care so much?\"\"Between you and him?\" Xue Meng said, \"Do you have him in your heart?\"Mo Ran was so angry that he laughed, \"Xue Ziming, are you crazy? Why are you acting crazy for no reason?Let's go, Shi Mei. Let's go to Dan Xin Palace and ask Uncle and Shizun clearly. \"As he said this, he pulled Shi Mei and walked past Xue Meng, intending to leave.Xue Meng stood in place for a while, as if he was trying to suppress something. But when Mo Ran was about to leave, he still couldn't hold it in. He turned around and shouted angrily, \"Mo Weiyu, do you have him as your Shizun in your heart?!\"\"\u2026\"Mo Ran couldn't help but feel annoyed by his yelling.He stopped in his tracks. His originally relaxed and cheerful face gradually became gloomy.Shi Mei squeezed his palm and whispered uneasily, \"Don't mind him. He has a bad temper these days.Let's go. \"\"\u2026 Okay.\"But just as his hand touched the warm curtain, before he could open it, Xue Meng's voice sounded. It was suffocating, hot, and boiling, as if it had come out of a fire.\"Mo Weiyu, you motherf * cker, you're really a good-for-nothing.\"With a \"swish\" sound, the curtain was lowered.Mo Ran closed his eyes and then opened them.\"Mo Ran \u2026\"Shi Mei tried to pull him, but he was gently pushed away.He turned his face and turned around. The two youths were about the same age, but they were much taller than Mo Ran. This person's malicious and cold appearance was really frightening.Mo Ran suddenly laughed, but his black eyes were heavy and there was no smile.He said, \"What a good-for-nothing.\"\"Xue Ziming, I have never looked down on Shizun. I also didn't stand aside when the sky cracked.The Avici Hell was broken and he couldn't fix it alone, so I volunteered to help him. Let me ask you, as his disciple, what did I do wrong? \"\"\u2026\"\"There was a huge difference in strength between us. I couldn't fix the barrier and fell from the Coiling Dragon Pillar, but he didn't even look at me. He didn't care whether I lived or died.Let me ask you again, if it were you, wouldn't you be disappointed? \"\"Mo Ran \u2026\"The knot in his heart of two lifetimes. When it came to the painful part, Mo Ran's handsome face couldn't help but distort.He said word by word, \"I thought I had done my best and had a clear conscience.I don't know what face you have to stand in front of me and say that I'm a good-for-nothing.\u2026 Xue Meng, do you think I never cared about him?You're wrong, I did. \"\"But this person is made of stone.\" Mo Ran said softly. Every word was like a knife cutting into his heart, dripping with blood. \"Xue Meng.Listen to me, I don't care how good of a Daoist priest he is in the eyes of the world, how powerful of a master he is, or whether he is Wanye Yuheng, the Big Dipper Celestial Venerable. These are not important. \"\"What's important is that when the sky cracked and leaked, my life was in danger.I begged him to turn back, but he didn't even spare me a glance. \"It was clearly such a cold and infuriating thing.But when he said it, he could be considered calm, but his eyes were more or less a little red.\"Also, Xue Meng, I can tell you.At that time, no matter who fell from the Coiling Dragon Pillar, even if it wasn't me, it would have been you or Shi Mei.He wouldn't have saved you. \"Because I saw it with my own eyes.In the heavy snow, he turned around, leaving his disciple's bones cold.\"Nothing is more precious than his good reputation as the Big Dipper Celestial Venerable.\" Mo Ran sneered. Maybe it was because of the dim light, but his smile was a little bleak.\"The lucky ones live, the unlucky ones die.\"Before the last word ended, light and shadow gathered in front of him, and a strong wind attacked.The room was narrow. Although Mo Ran had already sensed it, because Shi Mei was behind him, he was afraid that if he dodged now, he would hurt the innocent. So he stood in place and blocked the attack.Xue Meng pounced over like a cheetah, fiercely grabbing Mo Ran's collar. With a crisp \"pa\" sound, Xue Meng had ruthlessly slapped him in the face.Mo Ran was hit for no reason, so he was also burning with anger. He turned around and grabbed the violent youth, gritting his teeth, \"Xue Ziming!What are you doing?! \"Xue Meng didn't answer, only angrily spitting, \"Mo Weiyu, you animal!\"He didn't listen to reason. He didn't know what wrong medicine he ate, but he didn't have any intelligence at all. He tangled with Mo Ran in this empty room like two trapped beasts, wanting nothing more than to tear apart the other's skin and skin and chew the bones and blood into their stomachs.A lonely lantern flickered, illuminating their furious silhouettes on the stone wall. It was like a shadow puppet show, like an evil spirit totem.Suddenly, Mo Ran heard Xue Meng choke with sobs.It wasn't too loud, so he thought he must have misheard.But just as he thought this, a few drops of tears fell on the back of his hand.Xue Meng suddenly let go of Mo Ran and pushed him back. He hugged his knees and curled up on the ground, crying uncontrollably.Mo Ran's cheeks were still red and swollen, but he was stunned by this. He thought that he didn't use any killing moves, so he shouldn't have hurt him so much. Besides, it was his younger cousin who hit him first, so why did he suddenly \u2026Before he could finish his thought, he heard Xue Meng's sorrowful cries.\"How can you say that he didn't save you!How can you say that he didn't save you! \"Tears rolled down his cheeks, and he couldn't stop crying.On the side, Shi Mei saw that Xue Meng couldn't hide this matter, so he couldn't help but sigh. In the end, he lowered his eyes and didn't say anything.Xue Meng choked with sobs, \"If you say this, he'll be so sad if he hears it from underground \u2026\"This sentence came out too suddenly, so Mo Ran didn't react for a moment. He just blankly said, \"What?\"Xue Meng just cried bitterly. His venomous fangs had sunk into Mo Ran's neck, but he had also hurt himself.He cried so bitterly that his voice was fragmented. He kept wiping his face and his eyes. His gaze was sometimes fierce and sometimes sorrowful.He crouched on the ground and didn't get up.He buried his face in his arms for a long time.Mo Ran gradually felt a numbness surge up from the soles of his feet, and gradually, coldness spread throughout his body.He felt his lips move, and heard himself ask.\"Xue Meng, what did you say \u2026\"Xue Meng cried for a long time, or maybe it wasn't that long. It was just that Mo Ran felt that he had been waiting for that thunderous answer for too long.\"Shizun \u2026\" Xue Meng finally choked out, \"He's not here anymore.\"Mo Ran was speechless for a moment. His whole body was cold. He just listened blankly, as if he didn't understand what he meant.Not here anymore?What's not here anymore?Not here anymore, where did he go?Who's not here anymore \u2026 Who's not here anymore!!Who's not here anymore!!!Xue Meng slowly raised his head. There seemed to be hatred, mockery, and the deepest hatred in his eyes.\"Do you know why he didn't turn back at that time?\"\"\u2026\"\"My father said that after mending the Heavenly Fissure, his spiritual power was already exhausted. Do you think that the murderous aura of the World of Spirits and Souls only hit you?The Clairvoyance Barrier is twinned!No matter how much damage you suffered, he also suffered the same!It's just that he held on and didn't tell anyone. \"Mo Ran only felt a buzzing sound in his head.Could it be that in his previous life, he didn't save Shi Mei because \u2026Mo Ran didn't dare to think about it anymore. Even his fingertips were slightly trembling.\"Impossible \u2026 He's clearly so calm \u2026\"\"When has he ever been so calm in front of others?\"As Xue Meng spoke, his eyes reddened and tears fell again, \"After he came down, he was already exhausted. After he cast a defensive spell on you, he left you and didn't look at you. Why do you think it was?\"Xue Meng cried blood with every word.\"Master knew that he couldn't hold on for much longer.His spiritual power is very high. Once he reveals a flaw, it will attract a lot of evil spirits \u2026 Mo Ran, Mo Ran \u2026 Do you think he left because he didn't want you anymore \u2026 \"Mo Ran, \"\u2026\"\"He left because he didn't want to drag you down!Mo Weiyu!He was afraid of dragging you down! \"\"After the Avici Hell closed, the zombies went berserk. The ten great sects fought until dusk. There were countless casualties. Who would care about you?My father only found out that you were missing when he brought the heavily injured Elder Xuanji back to the Peak of Life and Death. \"Xue Meng panted for a while and choked out, \"Mo Weiyu, he was the one who brought you back \u2026 He was the one who took the medicine to recover his body and then dragged you out of the mountain of corpses. He was the one who was injured all over and even gave you the last of his spiritual power \u2026\"\"Impossible \u2026\"\"He was the one who brought you home. At that time, you hadn't woken up yet. His spiritual power was depleted and he was no different from a mortal. He couldn't use magic or send sound transmissions. He could only carry you and climb the stairs to the Peak of Life and Death step by step \u2026\"\"No \u2026\"\"More than three thousand levels of spiritual power \u2026 He's a \u2026 a person whose spiritual power has dissipated \u2026\"Mo Ran closed his eyes.Under the clear moonlight, he saw Chu Wanning, who was still alive, carrying him on his back and slowly climbing the endless stairs. He was covered in blood and his white clothes were mottled.That person was once so unreachable and untainted.Northern Dipper Celestial Sovereign, Wanye Yuheng.Mo Ran choked and said with a trembling voice, \"Impossible \u2026 how \u2026 could it be \u2026\"\"Yes.\" Xue Meng was also stunned when he said this. His eyes reddened.\"When I saw him, I thought that I was crazy and that what I saw was an illusion.Because I was also thinking. \"He was almost sighing.\" How \u2026 could it be \u2026 \"\"Impossible \u2026\" Mo Ran suddenly let out a sob. He hugged his head and muttered helplessly, \"Impossible \u2026\"\"Chang Jie's blood hasn't run dry. That's the way he'll bring you home.\" Xue Meng was filled with hatred and cruelty. \"Go and see, Mo Ran.Go and see. \"\"Impossible!!!\"Extreme shock and helplessness made Mo Ran suddenly furious. He grabbed Xue Meng and pulled him up from the ground. He pressed him against the wall and his expression changed.\"Impossible, absolutely impossible!Why would he save me?He never liked me and never looked down on me! \"\"\u2026 \u2026\"Xue Meng didn't say anything. After a moment of silence, he suddenly laughed bitterly.\"Mo Weiyu, it's not that he looks down on you.\"In the flowing candlelight, Xue Meng looked up with moist eyelashes and looked at him with hatred.\"It's me who looks down on you.\"Mo Ran: \"\u2026 \u2026\"\"I look down on you, Elder Xuanji looks down on you, Elder Tanlang looks down on you \u2026 \u2026 Who do you think you are.\" Xue Meng almost ground his teeth and spat these words at Mo Ran's face. \"Bastard.\"\"You \u2014 \u2014!\"Xue Meng suddenly laughed. He looked up at the dark ceiling. \"Mo Ran, on this peak of life and death, if there's one person who looks up to you the most, it's him.But you repay him like this. \"He laughed and laughed. Suddenly, he closed his eyes and tears rolled down his cheeks again.This time, it was a soft sob.\"Mo Ran, your Junior Brother Xia, my Master, is dead.\"Mo Ran was really bitten by the most vicious snake in the world. He was scalded. He let go of his hand in shock and took two steps back. It was as if he understood this sentence for the first time.His whole body started to tremble.Xue Meng suddenly called him, \"Brother.\"Mo Ran retreated, but his back hit the cold wall. There was nowhere to run.Xue Meng finally stopped crying.But his tone was as calm as death.\"Brother, we don't have a Master anymore.\u201cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Peak of Life and Death had a mountain range with a funny name called \"Ah Ah Ah\".There were many theories about the origin of this name in the sect. The most common one was that it was named \"Ah Ah Ah\" because this mountain range was so steep that people often fell down.However, Mo Ran knew that this was not the case.This mountain range was so tall that it reached the clouds. The mountain peak was covered in snow all year round and was extremely cold.If someone died at the Peak of Life and Death, their coffin would stop there and wait for the funeral.Mo Ran had only been here once in his previous life.That time was not very different from the current situation.It was also after the Avici Hell split open that a bloody battle took away countless lives. Shi Mei also died.He was unwilling to accept this reality, so he knelt beside Shi Mei's coffin and looked at the person's lifeless face in the ice coffin. He knelt for many days \u2026\"The reason why it's called Ah Ah Ah is because your father passed away that year.\" In his previous life, Xue Zhengyong accompanied him in the cold Frost Heaven Palace and told him this.\"I only have one elder brother. The Peak of Life and Death was created by the two of us. However, your father \u2026 he was very similar to you. He was an extremely capricious person.He only enjoyed his life for a few days before he got bored. He lost in a fight with an evil spirit and left. \"Frost Heaven Palace was too cold. Xue Zhengyong brought a pot of wine and took a sip. Then, he passed the goatskin wine bag to Mo Ran.\"Here, drink some, but don't tell your aunt.\"Mo Ran did not take it, nor did he touch it.Xue Zhengyong sighed. \"This peak is called Ah Ah Ah because during that time, I was also very sad. It was as if my heart had been dug out. I stayed on the mountain and watched over your father. When I thought of the sad part, I couldn't help but cry loudly.When I cried, it was very unpleasant to hear. I was always howling, so I got this name. \"He glanced at Mo Ran and patted his shoulder.\"Uncle didn't study much, but he also knows that life is like the morning dew. It disappears in the blink of an eye.Just treat it as Ming Jing taking the first step. We'll be brothers in the next life. \"Mo Ran slowly closed his eyes.Xue Zhengyong said, \"My condolences are just empty words. If you're sad, just cry it out.If she didn't want to leave, she could stay here and accompany him.But he had to eat and drink.I'll go to the Meng Po Lobby for some food and come back later.If you want to kneel after that, I will not stop you. \"The Frosty Heaven Palace was cold and silent. Inside the large cold room, the white silk gently fluttered like a gentle finger brushing across one's forehead.Mo Ran slowly opened his eyes.It was still the same ice coffin in his memory. It was made of the mysterious snow of Kunlun. The body of the coffin was sparkling and translucent, with wisps of cold air lingering around it.However, the person lying inside was Chu Wanning.Mo Ran had never expected that in this lifetime, the person who would die in this Heaven's Split would be Chu Wanning.He was caught off guard and couldn't react in time.Facing this person's ice-cold corpse, he didn't feel too much emotion. There wasn't the joy of an enemy's death, nor was there the sorrow of his master's passing.Mo Ran was somewhat puzzled. He lowered his eyes and looked at Chu Wanning for a long time. That person's face was even colder than usual. Right now, it was really covered in a layer of frost. Even his tightly closed eyelashes were frozen. His lips were pale and his skin was almost transparent. He could see the light blue blood vessels, like the fine cracks on white porcelain.How could the person who left be him?Mo Ran raised his hand and touched Chu Wanning's cheek. It was very cold to the touch.All the way down, his throat and neck, there was no pulse.He reached his hand again.He held his hand. His knuckles were already somewhat stiff, but they felt very rough.Mo Ran felt that it was strange. Although Chu Wanning's fingertips had small calluses, his palm was always soft and delicate. He couldn't help but look carefully. What he saw were chapped and broken scars. Although they had been wiped, the wounds would never heal. The flesh was still open.He remembered what Xue Meng said.\"His spiritual power was completely damaged. He was no different from a mortal. He couldn't use magic, nor could he transmit sound. He could only carry you and climb the stairs to the peak of life and death step by step \u2026\"He couldn't support himself. He couldn't stand up. He crawled on the ground, knelt, and dragged until his ten fingers were worn out and his hands were full of blood.He also wanted to bring him home.Mo Ran murmured in a daze, \"Did you carry me back?\"\"\u2026\"\"Chu Wanning, is it you \u2026\"\"\u2026\"\"If you didn't nod your head, I wouldn't have believed it.\"Mo Ran said to the person in the coffin. His face was calm, as if he believed that the person in front of him would really wake up. \"Chu Wanning, nod your head.If you nod your head, I'll believe you. I won't hate you anymore \u2026 Nod your head, okay? \"But Chu Wanning was still lying there. His expression was indifferent, and his eyebrows were cold. It seemed that he didn't care whether Mo Ran hated him or not. He had a clear conscience, leaving others in the world to feel uneasy.This person, whether alive or dead, made others feel annoyed. It was far better than making others feel pain.Mo Ran suddenly sneered, \"That's true.\" He said, \"When have you ever listened to me?\"He looked at Chu Wanning and suddenly felt that it was ridiculous.All this time, he hated Chu Wanning because he looked down on him. He hated Chu Wanning because he didn't save Shi Mei that year.After going around in circles, this hatred continued for more than ten years. Suddenly, one day, someone told him \u2014 \u2014\"Chu Wanning turned around and left because he didn't want to be a burden to you.\"Suddenly, someone told him \u2014 \u2014\"The Observation Barrier is twinned. You suffered heavy injuries, but so did he.\"His spirit flow was exhausted, he couldn't protect himself, he \u2026Good, this was really good.Chu Wanning was right, but what about him?He had been kept in the dark like a fool and had been played around like a clown. He had grimaced in pain and dug out his heart for so long.What was this?!Things like misunderstandings, if short, were like a lump of dirt that stuck to a wound when it was healing. If it was discovered in time, it couldn't be better to clean it up and apply ointment again.But if a misunderstanding continued for ten or twenty years, the person trapped in the net had invested a long time of hatred, a long time of care, a long time of fetters, and even his life into this misunderstanding.These feelings had already formed scabs and grown into new flesh, completely blending with the body.Suddenly, someone said: \"It's not like that, everything is wrong.\"Then what should he do now?The dirt from back then had already grown under the skin and in the blood with the passage of time.Only by tearing open the intact skin and flesh could the past be dispelled.A year of misunderstanding was a misunderstanding.Ten years of misunderstanding was a sin.And from birth to death, a lifetime of misunderstanding was fate.Their fates were thin.The heavy stone door of Frost Heaven Palace slowly opened.Just like in the previous life, Xue Zhengyong carried a goatskin wineskin full of soju wine and walked with heavy steps to Mo Ran's side. He sat on the ground and stood shoulder to shoulder with him.\"I heard that you were here, so Uncle came to accompany you.\"Xue Zhengyong's leopard eyes were red, showing that he had cried not long ago.\"I also came to accompany him.\"Mo Ran did not speak, so Xue Zhengyong opened the wine pot and drank a few mouthfuls. Then, he suddenly stopped, wiped his face, and forced a smile: \"In the past, when I drank, Yu Heng was always unhappy when he saw me. Now \u2026 sigh, forget it, I won't say it, I won't say it.I'm not old, but I've sent away one old friend after another.Ran Er, do you know how it feels? \"\"\u2026 \u2026\"Mo Ran lowered his eyes.In the previous life, Xue Zhengyong had also asked him this question.At that time, he only had eyes for Shi Mei's withered flesh and blood. What did the lives of others matter to him?He did not understand, nor did he want to understand.But now, how could he not understand?Before his rebirth, he was all alone. In the huge Shaman Mountain Palace, he was the only one left.One day, he woke up with a start from a light sleep and dreamed of the old times when he was studying under Yu Heng's tutelage. After waking up, he wanted to go back to his bedroom to take a look, but when he pushed open the door and entered, that narrow disciple's room had been deserted for a long time, the walls covered in dust.He saw a small incense burner on the ground, but he did not know who had knocked it over or when.He picked up the incense burner and subconsciously wanted to put it back to its original position.But time passed quickly. He held the small incense burner and suddenly froze.\"This incense burner, where was it originally placed?\"He did not remember.His hawk-like gaze swept past the people behind him, but those people all had blurry faces. He could not even tell who was called Zhang San and who was called Li Si.And naturally, they did not know where the incense burner of the Emperor's youth was placed in the room.\"This incense burner, where was it originally placed?\"He didn't remember, and those who could remember the past were either dead or scattered.How could Mo Ran not understand Xue Zhengyong's feelings at this time?\"Sometimes, I suddenly think of a joke when I was young and unconsciously say it, but I realize that there is no one who can understand this joke.\"Xue Zhengyong drank another mouthful of wine and lowered his head to laugh.\"Your father, your comrades in the past \u2026 your Shizun \u2026\"His fragmented light flowed, and he asked, \"Ran Er, do you know why this mountain range is called Ah Ah Ah?\"Mo Ran understood what he wanted to say, but he was currently upset and did not want to listen to Xue Zhengyong talk about his late father, so he said, \"I know.Uncle cried here before. \"\"Ah \u2026\" Xue Zhengyong was stunned. He slowly blinked, and there was a deep mark at the end of his tail. \"Did your aunt tell you?\"\"Yes.\"Xue Zhengyong wiped his tears and took a deep breath. \"Okay, okay, then you know, uncle wanted to tell you that if you feel bad, you can cry, it's okay.A man has tears for his king, it's not shameful. \"Mo Ran did not cry, perhaps because he had experienced two lifetimes, his heart was as hard as iron. Compared to the heart-wrenching pain when Shi Mei passed away, he was so calm.He was so calm that he even felt frightened by his own numbness.He did not know that he was so cold.After drinking, Xue Zhengyong sat for a while and stood up. It was unknown whether it was because his legs were numb from kneeling for too long or because he drank too much, but he was slightly unsteady.He patted Mo Ran's shoulder with his wide hand. \"Although the Heavenly Fissure has been mended, the person behind it has not been found out yet.Perhaps this matter will pass like this, or perhaps there will be a second great battle soon.Ran Er, it's about time to go down the mountain and eat something, don't starve yourself. \"After he finished speaking, he turned and walked away.At this time, it was night. A waning moon hung high in the sky outside the Frosty Sky Palace. Xue Zhengyong stepped on the snow that never melted all year round, carrying half a pot of turbid wine. His rough voice was like a broken gong as he sang a short song from the center of Sichuan.\"I worship an old friend half as a ghost, only now can I be happy.The corner is hidden under the osmanthus tree, drinking on the face with rotting hair.The sky is broken, the people are gone, abandoning my old body with turbid tears.I am willing to extend my life and return the wine to you. \"In the end, it was different from his previous life. The one who died was not Shi Mei, but Chu Wanning. Thus, Xue Zhengyong felt even more emotional.Mo Ran's back was facing the open door of Shuangtian Temple. He listened to the long, hoarse voice of a man, sonorous, yet desolate.The song was like an eagle flying away, finally swallowed up by the wind and snow.Heaven and earth were bright, the moon was high, and the people were faint. Everything was washed away very, very faint. Only one sentence remained, going back and forth.\"Abandoning my old body with turbid tears \u2026 abandoning my old body with turbid tears \u2026\"After an unknown amount of time, Mo Ran slowly walked down Shuangtian Temple.Uncle was right. Although the Heavenly Fissure had been mended, it did not mean that the matter would end here.Chu Wanning was no longer here. If there was another fierce battle, he would be the only one left to defend.When he arrived at the Meng Po Lobby, it was already late. Other than the old woman cooking supper, there was no one else.Mo Ran asked for a small bowl of noodles, found a corner seat, and slowly ate.The noodles were spicy, warming his stomach. He looked up as he wolfed down the food. Amidst the dense steam, the Meng Po Lobby was dimly lit, and his image was blurry.He vaguely remembered that after Shi Mei's death in his previous life, he was far more willful than he was now. He refused to leave for three days and three nights, and he did not eat.Later, he was finally persuaded to leave Shuangtian Temple to eat something. However, he saw Chu Wanning's busy figure in the kitchen.That person was clumsily rolling the dough and mixing the stuffing. There was flour and water on the table, as well as several neat rows of wontons.\"Clang!\"The things on the table were swept away, and that tyrannical sound came through the rolling dust.The current Mo Ran could not lift his chopsticks and eat.At that time, he felt that Chu Wanning was mocking him, harboring malicious intentions to hurt him.But now that he thought about it, perhaps Chu Wanning really did want to replace the already dead Shi Mei and cook another bowl of wontons for him.\"Who do you think you are?Are you worthy of the things he used?Are you worthy of cooking the dishes he made?Shi Mei is dead, are you satisfied?Will you only be satisfied after you drive all of your disciples to their deaths and drive them insane?Chu Wanning!There is no one else in this world who can make that bowl of wontons. No matter how much you try to imitate him, you won't be able to do it! \"Every word pierced his heart.He did not want to think about it anymore. He ate his noodles.But how could he? His memories would not let him off so easily.He recalled Chu Wanning's face more clearly than ever before. There was no joy or sorrow. He recalled every detail of that time more clearly than ever before.He remembered the slight tremble on his fingertips, the crumbs of flour on his cheeks.He remembered the plump, snow-white wontons rolling all over the floor.He remembered Chu Wanning. He lowered his eyes, bent down, and slowly picked up the food that could no longer be eaten. Then he personally threw it away.Personally threw it away.There was still more than half a bowl of pea noodles left.Mo Ran could not eat anymore. He pushed the bowl away and fled from this place that would drive him crazy.He ran madly at the peak of life and death, as if he wanted to leave behind all the misunderstandings of the past ten years, as if he wanted to catch up to the man who had left Granny Meng Hall alone that year.Catch up to him and say one sentence.\"I'm sorry, I hated you wrongly.\"Mo Ran ran without any order in the dark night. He ran \u2026 but everywhere he went, there was Chu Wanning's broken figure.The Good and Evil Platform, teaching him how to read and practice the sword.The Bridge of Helplessness, holding an umbrella with him, walking together.The Green Heaven Hall, suffering all kinds of punishment, wandering alone.He became more and more anxious and helpless in the night.Suddenly, he ran to a spacious place. Suddenly, the clouds parted and the fog cleared. The bright moon hung high in the sky.Mo Ran gasped for breath and stopped.Tong Tian Pagoda \u2026The place where he died in his previous life. The place where he and Chu Wanning first met.His heart beat like a drum. His eyes were in chaos. He was chased by the past like a tide. He could not resist or hide. In the end, he was forced to here.The moon was white and the wind was clear. When he first met Jun.Mo Ran finally stopped running. He knew that he could no longer escape. In this life, he was destined to owe Chu Wanning.He slowly walked up the steps to the crabapple tree that was still in the air.He reached out and stroked the dry tree trunk. It was hard like a cocoon on his heart.At this time, it had been nearly three days since Chu Wanning died.Mo Ran looked up. He suddenly saw that the tree was as gentle as before.At this time, he suddenly felt a burst of endless sadness. He pressed his forehead against the tree trunk. Finally, he lost his voice and cried. His tears fell like rain.\"Shizun, Shizun \u2026\" He choked and murmured. He repeatedly said the words when he first met Chu Wanning. \"Pay attention to me, please \u2026 pay attention to me \u2026\"But things were the same, people were different. In front of Tong Tian Tower, he was the only one left. No one paid attention to him. No one would come again.After being reborn, Mo Ran had the body of a teenager. But inside his body was the soul of the thirty-two year old Emperor Ta. He had seen too many deaths and tasted the sweetness of the world. Since he was reborn, the emotions in his heart were not so sincere and clear. It always seemed like there was a layer of mask covering them.But at this moment, his face suddenly showed such confusion and pain. It was naked, tender, pure, and inexperienced.Only at this moment did he truly look like an ordinary teenager who had lost his Shizun. Like an abandoned child. Like a lonely dog who had lost his home and could no longer find his way back.He said, \"Pay attention to me.Pay attention to me \u2026 \"But, in the end, what responded to him was only the swaying leaves and the lush shadow of the flowers.And the handsome man under the crabapple tree would never again, and could never again raise his head to look at him. Even if it was the last time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThat night, Mo Ran leaned against the crabapple tree and fell asleep.There were many places on the peak of life and death that had traces of Chu Wanning's life. If he wanted to pay homage, it was best to go to the Red Lotus Water Pavilion. However, he could only lean against this tree so that his heart would not hurt so much. Only then could he feel a little bit of the human world.He once thought that it was his greatest misfortune to have Chu Wanning as his teacher. This bow was wrong from the beginning.However, only today did he understand that the unfortunate person was not him, Mo Weiyu. Instead, it was Chu Wanning who was standing among the flowers with his head lowered in contemplation.\"Immortal Master, Immortal Master, please pay attention to me.\"He vaguely remembered the first sentence he said to his teacher. It seemed to be like this. Perhaps there were some differences in the words. It had been too long, so he could not remember it so clearly.However, he could clearly remember that when Chu Wanning raised his eyelashes, that blank and slightly stunned face.Between his eyebrows, he looked very gentle.Now, Mo Ran was lying under the tree. He thought, if time could go back to the day when he chose his teacher, no matter what, he would not pester Chu Wanning to accept him as his disciple.Because the moment he raised his eyes, the price he had to pay was the endless entanglement that followed, Chu Wanning's life.Two lifetimes.He destroyed them all in his own hands.Two lifetimes \u2026His throat moved, and he choked and closed his eyes. He was in the pain of ten thousand ants gnawing at his heart. After a long time, he fell into a light sleep.Then, the memory that he did not dare to touch easily since his rebirth broke free from the shackles in his sleep. Holding a knife, he dug out his heart.At that time, he had already reached the peak of the human world. Chu Wanning had already been crippled of his spiritual nucleus and was under house arrest in the palace without freedom.However, he suffered several assassinations in succession. The last assassination was even done by Xue Meng and Mei Hanxue. Although Mo Ran did not die on the spot because of his strong mana, he was seriously injured. He recuperated in the palace for more than a month before he recovered his energy.There was a lot of rain in the center of Shu. During that period of time, the rain did not stop.Mo Ran was draped in a thick brocade robe, his jade-like fingers gripping the lapels of his robe as he stood under the verandah, looking at the dark sky outside. His expression was a little happy and a little crazy. He didn't say anything, but everyone could feel the twisted humanity in him. He clearly had an extremely handsome face, but the light in his eyes was often gloomy and tyrannical, without the slightest bit of warmth.The longer he sat in his high position, the more obvious this gloominess became.The sound of footsteps came from behind him. He didn't turn around and only said, \"You're here?\"\"You want to destroy the Kunlun Treading Snow Palace?\" Chu Wanning's voice resounded faintly in the hall.Mo Ran said, \"So what if he is?\"\"\u2026 Did you forget what you promised me?You said that you wouldn't harm Xue Meng's life again. \"Mo Ran said calmly, \"Shizun came, but you didn't ask about my injuries. Standing here in the cold wind, you only care about who I kill and who I don't kill?\"\"Mo Weiyu, I came to tell you, don't do anything you will regret.\"\"Ha, regret?The one who should regret is you, Shizun. Back then, when I slaughtered the Confucian Wind Sect, you and I fought a life and death battle, and your spiritual core was shattered. Now that I want to destroy the Treading Snow Palace, you are no different from a mortal. You don't even have the ability to fight me anymore. Do you regret meddling in other people's business? \"After Mo Ran finished speaking, he turned his face and looked back. There was a trace of a cruel smile at the corner of his mouth, and a light flashed in the depths of his eyes. \"Chu Wanning, you are now a cripple. What can you use to stop me?\"Perhaps because he really had nothing left, Chu Wanning was speechless for a long time.With a thunderous boom, heavy rain poured down, flowing down the roof tiles and beams.Chu Wanning finally closed his eyes. When he opened them again, he softly said, \"Don't go.\"His black robe fluttering, Mo Ran turned around.Behind him was the leaden gray sky, the chilly wind and rain. He looked at Chu Wanning in the hall, and then said, \"Why don't I go?I gave Xue Meng a chance. That year, you were willing to submit to me for him. I kept my promise and took your people, but spared his life. Now that he wants to kill me, tell me, why don't I go? \"\"\u2026 \u2026\"\"What?Can't say anything? \"Mo Ran laughed coldly.\" Reprimand me, curse me. Chu Wanning, aren't you very capable?I know that Xue Meng is your flesh and blood, the disciple you are most proud of. You think that he has a pure heart, but I am just a piece of mud under his shoes. \"\"Enough.\" Chu Wanning's face was pale. His brows were tightly knitted, as if he was suppressing something.\"Not enough!How can it be enough? \"When Mo Ran saw this, the cruel pleasure in his heart grew stronger. Rage, ecstasy, hatred, jealousy, all kinds of intense emotions were like oil on fire, burning his heart.His eyes were extremely bright, shining with light. He paced back and forth.\"There is no second chance, Chu Wanning, he does not have a second chance.I want to kill him, peel off his skin and step on it, use his skull to drink wine!I want to dig out his liver and intestines, chop up his flesh and make soup!You can't stop me!\u2014 \u2014 Chu Wanning, you can't stop me! \"His eyes were red, and the more he spoke, the more excited he became. He was almost deranged.Suddenly, a hand grabbed his collar and slapped him in the face.\"Are you done being crazy!\"Chu Wanning's face was so close that he could see the other's eyelashes trembling, and tears in the other's eyes.\"Mo Ran \u2026 \u2026 Wake up, wake up \u2026 \u2026\"\"I'm awake!\"The burning pain on his face made him even more crazy. He stared at Chu Wanning's face, and suddenly became furious. \"I'm awake!The one sleeping is you!Are you blind? \"He pushed the other away and tore open his own collar, revealing the blood-red gauze underneath.\"Are you blind, Chu Wanning!\"He roared angrily, poking his own chest, but felt that it was not enough, so he viciously tore off the gauze, revealing a bloody mess \u2026 \u2026\"Who did this?Your good disciple!Xue Meng!If his Dragon City was a bit more to the side, I would have died!Tell me, why should I let him go! \"\"In your eyes, only his life is life, and mine is not, right?!\"Under the hatred, Mo Ran suddenly grabbed Chu Wanning's hand and stuck it to his bloody wound. \"Didn't you want to stop me?Fine, I'll give you a chance, take out my heart!\u2014 \u2014 Chu Wanning, if you have the fucking ability, take out my heart! \"\"\u2026 \u2026\" Chu Wanning's fingertips were trembling, so cold, so cold.Mo Ran stared at him, furious, ruthless, and the veins on his neck were trembling.He said hoarsely, \"Take it out.\"Outside, the rain was pouring down, hitting the roof tiles and eaves. It was apprehensive and crazy.Dead silence.No one moved.After an unknown amount of time, Mo Ran finally released Chu Wanning's hand. He gasped for breath and said in a deep voice, \"Xue Ziming and Mei Hanxue's lives, I want them.\"\"\u2026 \u2026\"\"You hate me, Shizun.\" Mo Ran said, \"In any case, my life is like this, our lives are like this.We can't turn back, so let's just walk in the dark.On the road to the Yellow Springs, I'll drag some old friends to accompany me. \"That day, Chu Wanning looked at his departing back and said one last sentence.He said, \"Mo Ran, if you destroy Treading Snow Palace and kill Xue Meng, I will also die in front of you. I have nothing to exchange with you, but at least I can choose to die.\"Mo Ran heard this, paused, and then turned half of his handsome face. In the hazy wind and rain, he revealed a smile.\"With this seat here, you won't die.\"\"\u2026 \u2026\"\"Even if your blood runs out, I can still bring you back from the Yama Palace. Even if you disgust me in this life, you still have to live with me.\"After Mo Ran released his madness, his face gradually regained its usual calm and cold killing intent. He said, \"My good Shizun, you should obediently stay at the peak of life and death. When I catch Xue Meng and come back, I will let him take a good look at the god he cares about day and night. Now that he is under me, I will let him take a good look at the god he cares about day and night.In any case, we are from the same sect, so I should let him die clearly and clearly. \"However, Mo Ran never thought that Grandmaster Chu would still be Grandmaster Chu after all.A month later, Mo Ran fulfilled his grand promise. He stood proudly at the peak of Kunlun Mountain, in front of the Heavenly Lake.Mei Hanxue and Xue Meng had already been captured by him and bound to an ice pillar. Then, he used the exquisite chess game to control the minds of the thousand people of Treading Snow Palace, making them slaughter each other in front of Mei and Xue.In a flash, the pure white snow mountain was dyed red. Blood dyed the Heavenly Lake red and soaked the mountain range.Mo Ran calmly sat in front of the Treading Snow Palace's entrance. While eating grapes handed to him by a servant, he smiled at the scene in front of him.He asked Xue Meng, whose eyes were almost out of focus. He said, \"Meng Meng, is it good?\"\"\u2026 \u2026\" Xue Meng did not respond, as if he had lost his hearing.Mo Ran was very satisfied with this and smiled even more intimately. He asked again, \"Did you like the performance that cousin showed you?\"\"\u2026 \u2026 Let go of the Treading Snow Palace.\"Suddenly hearing such a weak murmur, Mo Ran blinked and asked, \"What?\"\"Let go of the Treading Snow Palace.\"Xue Meng's burning eyes no longer had any light, \"Let go of them, let go of Mei Hanxue \u2026 \u2026 That assassination, the one who wanted your life was me. You can kill me, but don't implicate others.\"Mo Ran laughed in spite of himself, \"Are you negotiating with me?\"\"No.\" Xue Meng stared blankly, he said, \"I am begging you.\"The proud son of heaven said, I am begging you.The demon in his heart was suddenly pleased. Mo Ran's eyes lit up, as if he was interested. He pinched Xue Meng's chin, forcing him to look up at him. Just as he was about to say something, he suddenly saw a blue light on the horizon.\"What's going on?\"Before his servant could answer, he saw that above the snowy peak of Cui Wei, a brilliant array stretched for thousands of miles, covering the entire Kunlun mountain range.Above the array, Chu Wanning stood in the clouds, his clothes as white as snow, fluttering in the wind.In front of him hung a strangely shaped guqin. It was completely black, the end of the guqin curled up, spreading out lush branches and leaves. The begonia on the guqin wept, its brilliance scattered.\u2014 \u2014 Chu Wanning's third Divine Martial, \"Nine Songs\".Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMo Ran was terrified.In his life, he had only seen Chu Wanning's Nine Songs once, during the life and death battle. Chu Wanning had summoned the ancient zither Nine Songs, and the sound of the zither had broken through the air and entered the clouds.The living monsters, strange beasts, and birds that were controlled by the exquisite chess game were recalled by the Nine Songs. With one song, Mo Ran's millions of chess pieces were thrown into chaos.But summoning the Divine Martial required the activation of the spirit nucleus, which consumed a large amount of spiritual energy.Chu Wanning could not even summon back his usual Heaven's Inquisition, so how could he suddenly summon the \"Nine Songs\" that was even more powerful than Heaven's Inquisition?The fierce battle on the Heavenly Lake was not inferior to the life-or-death battle between the master and disciple back then.But Mo Ran could not remember so many details. After this bloody battle, there was finally no one by his side that he could talk to.In fact, when Mo Ran died in his previous life, he did not understand why Chu Wanning could use his own soul to summon the Nine Songs.This was a connection that no Divine Martial would have with its master, but Chu Wanning did it.On that day, the exquisite chess pieces made by Mo Ran were shattered into dust by the zither music. The power of the Nine Songs was purer and more powerful than the first time he saw it. It was so powerful that he even suspected that Chu Wanning's spirit nucleus was not broken at all. For so many years, it was Chu Wanning who was pretending, enduring humiliation, and wanting to avenge his shame.Later on, he could not help but think that if it was really like this, then it would be good.If Chu Wanning was really pretending, then maybe things would not have reached that final step.How good would that be.The Nine Songs destroyed Mo Ran's forbidden technique, causing the cultivators who were in the middle of killing each other to suddenly wake up. It even broke the ice pillars that imprisoned Xue Meng and Mei Hanxue.Mo Ran flew into the clouds, his robes fluttering in the wind. His eyes were filled with both anger and joy. He wanted to see just how many more shocking moves Chu Wanning had yet to use.He stepped on the top of the barrier and walked closer, standing in front of Chu Wanning.He saw the pair of pale and slender hands slow down and stroke the strings of the Nine Songs Guqin. The sound of the guqin stopped.Chu Wanning raised his head. His face was as white as snow under the sun.He said, \"Mo Ran.Come here. \"For some reason, he walked over to him.Chu Wanning's finger moved slightly, and a few jade-green rays of light flew towards Mo Ran's chest. Mo Ran was shocked, he thought that Chu Wanning was going to kill him.However, that brilliance was neither painful nor itchy. It lingered in front of his chest and slowly seeped into his skin. It was actually indescribably warm.\"The sword that Xue Meng injured you, I healed it for you.\"Chu Wanning sighed softly, \"Let him go, Mo Ran. If he is no longer here, if you want to find someone to talk about the past, who can you find \u2026 \u2026\"Before Mo Ran could react to what he meant, the powerful barrier beneath his feet suddenly disappeared. Along with it, the Nine Songs Guqin that Chu Wanning had summoned also disappeared.He immediately raised his hand to summon the Modao Does Not Return, only then did he stand in the clouds. However, Chu Wanning fell down like a fallen leaf, as if that song just now had used up the last of his strength.\"Wanning!\"His expression suddenly changed. He flew down with his sword, and before that person was about to fall into the ice-cold Heaven Lake, he grabbed him into his arms.\"Chu Wanning!You \u2014 \u2014 you \u2026 \u2026 \"Chu Wanning closed his eyes. Blood kept flowing out of his mouth, nose, eyes, and ears.Dignity was extremely important to him. Even if he was imprisoned in the Shaman Mountain Palace, he still did not bend his spine. He rarely embarrassed himself. However, right now, he was bleeding from all seven of his orifices. His usually upright and elegant appearance was now in such a sorry state.Chu Wanning swallowed a mouthful of blood and said hoarsely, \"You said \u2026 \u2026 that life and death is not up to me \u2026 \u2026 But look, Mo Ran \u2026 \u2026 You still underestimated your teacher. If I was determined to leave, even if you tried to stop \u2026 \u2026 you would not be able to stop me \u2026 \u2026\"\"\u2026 \u2026 Teacher \u2026 \u2026\" Mo Ran looked at him. He felt a chill in his heart. His scalp was numb. He was actually at a loss as to what to do as he shouted.Chu Wanning laughed. His expression seemed to be somewhat happy, \"Originally, I had been living like this because I was a little unwilling. I always wanted to accompany you for a few more years so that I could teach you \u2026 \u2026 not to commit more sins \u2026 \u2026 But now \u2026 \u2026 Now \u2026 \u2026\"Mo Ran trembled. He held the person in his arms. He suddenly felt very scared.Scared.This emotion did not belong to him for more than ten years. Now, it suddenly attacked him. It was so strong that it almost dug out his heart.\"But now, I know that only my death can make you \u2026 \u2026 not do evil anymore \u2026 \u2026\"When he said this, he seemed to be in extreme pain.Forcefully summoning Jiu Ge was too much for his body to handle. Some of his organs were broken again. Blood gushed out of his mouth. Mo Ran held him and landed beside the Heavenly Lake. His expression was crazed and painful. He kept sending spiritual energy into Chu Wansheng's chest.However, when that powerful energy entered Chu Wanning's body, it was like a clay ox entering the sea. It did not return.Mo Ran was really panicking. The Emperor Ta hugged the person in his arms tightly. He failed again and again, but he tried again and again to give him some spiritual energy.\"It's useless \u2026 \u2026 Mo Ran, I used my life to summon Jiu Ge. My life and death have been decided. If \u2026 \u2026 you still have some sense in your heart \u2026 \u2026 please \u2026 \u2026 let me go \u2026 \u2026\"Let go of who?Xue Meng? Mei Hanxue?Kunlun's Treading in Snow Palace? Or the entire cultivation world?Yes, yes \u2026 \u2026 he could let them go!As long as Chu Wanning lived, as long as this person he hated so much didn't die like this.Chu Wanning raised his trembling hand. His cold fingertips seemed to be sympathetic, but also seemed to be intimate. He gently tapped Mo Ran's forehead.He said, \"Please \u2026 \u2026 let go \u2026 let go of yourself \u2026 \u2026\"The ferocious look on Mo Ran's face froze in an instant.Let go of who \u2026 \u2026Who was he thinking about before he died?Let go of \u2026 \u2026 yourself \u2026 \u2026Was that what he said?The Emperor Ta hugged him. He seemed to be at a loss. He seemed to be happy. He seemed to be in great pain. He seemed to be satisfied.\"Let go of myself?Your last wish is for me to let go of myself? \"Mo Ran muttered. His eyes were bloodshot. He suddenly laughed out loud. That laughter was like a fierce fire. It penetrated the clouds and burned away all reason and consciousness.\"Hahaha \u2014 \u2014 Hahahahaha \u2014 \u2014 Let go of myself?Chu Wanning, you're crazier than me!You're so naive \u2014 \u2014 Hahahahaha \u2014 \u2014 \"The entire Kunlun Mountain reverberated with his disgusting and mocking laughter. It was twisted, unrecognizable, and chilling.Chu Wanning swallowed the blood in Mo Ran's crazy laughter. If he still had strength, his expression would be extremely painful. But he didn't even have the strength to frown. Only his pair of phoenix eyes \u2026 \u2026 those phoenix eyes that used to be sharp, resolute, stern, or gentle, were filled with sorrow.They were as pure as the snow in the heavenly lake. They were hazy like frost on the roof tiles.Chu Wanning's eyes gradually lost focus. Her eyes, which had once been as bright as lightning, gradually lost focus. She could no longer see anything clearly.In the end, he said softly to Mo Ran, \"Don't laugh. Seeing you like this makes my heart very sad \u2026 \u2026\"\"\u2026 \u2026\"\"Mo Ran, in this life, no matter what happens in the end \u2026 \u2026 I didn't teach you well at the beginning. I said you were inferior and difficult to cultivate \u2026 \u2026 I mistreated you. I won't blame you in life or death \u2026 \u2026\" Chu Wanning's pale face didn't have any color. His lips were pale. He tried to look up and look at Mo Ran's face. He opened his eyes. He wanted to cry, but what slowly flowed out of his eyes was blood. It flowed down his cheeks.Chu Wanning cried. He said, \"But you \u2026 \u2026 really hate me that much \u2026 \u2026 until the end \u2026 \u2026 you're not even willing to give me a moment of peace \u2026 \u2026\"\"Mo Ran \u2026 \u2026 Mo Ran \u2026 \u2026 don't be like this. Wake up. Turn back \u2026 \u2026 turn back \u2026 \u2026\"Wake up \u2026 \u2026He wanted him to wake up, but he opened his eyes blankly and fell asleep just like that.Mo Ran couldn't believe it. He didn't want to believe that Chu Wanning had died just like that.A Grandmaster of a generation, a high mountain to look up to. His own teacher, the person he hated so much, had died just like that.Lying in his arms, beside the blood soaked Heaven Mountain Heavenly Lake.Bit by bit, the cold turned into frost and snow, condensing into ice.Chu Wanning's face was full of blood. Mo Ran lowered his head and looked at it for a while. He raised his sleeves and tried to wipe it clean.But there was too much blood. The more he wiped, the dirtier that originally cold and clean face became.Mo Ran pursed his lips and wiped them with all his might.But what he got was a face mottled with blood.His facial features couldn't be seen clearly anymore.He finally stopped laughing.He closed his eyes and said softly, \"This time you've won, Chu Wanning.I can't stop you from dying. \"After a pause, he opened his eyes again. They seemed dark and cold, but they burned with the fire of the abyss.He said, \"But you underestimate me too much.If you don't want to live, I can't stop you. But if I don't want you to die, you can't stop me either. \"Mo Ran didn't announce Chu Wanning's life or death. He brought him back to the peak of life and death.At that time, he already had the ability to reach the heavens. He could guarantee that the corpse would never wither. He placed Chu Wanning's body in the Red Lotus Pavilion. He forced Chu Wanning to 'live' like this.It was too difficult for him to admit that he killed the last person in the world who cared about him.As long as Chu Wanning's body didn't turn into ashes, as long as he could still see him every day.He could feel that Chu Wanning was not dead.His crazy hatred, his twisted love, there was still a place where he could vent, a place where he could entrust himself.The Celestial Treading Monarch had finally gone completely mad.After Chu Wanning left, he went to the Red Lotus Pavilion every day to see his body. In the beginning, his eyes flashed with a vicious light. He cursed in front of the body. He said, \"Chu Wanning, you deserve it.\"\"You saved everyone in the world, but not me. You hypocrite.\"\"What kind of master are you?I was blind to have you as my master!Bastard! \"Later, he would ask every day, \"Why did you sleep for so long?When are you going to wake up? \"\"I've already let go of Xue Meng. You're almost done. Get up.\"Every time he said this, the servants by his side thought that he had lost his mind, that he was crazy.His wife, Song Qiutong, also thought that he was crazy.She was very scared, so after a rare pleasure, she said to him, \"Mo Ran, the dead can't come back to life. I know you're sad, but you \u2026\"\"Who's sad?\"\"\u2026 \u2026\"Song Qiutong was very good at reading people's expressions. These years, she was very careful around Mo Ran. Seeing his unkind expression, she immediately shut up and lowered her eyes. \"I was wrong.\"\"Don't.\"Mo Ran did not let her go easily this time. He narrowed his eyes. \"You spat out the words, why did you swallow them?Tell me, who's sad? \"\"Your Majesty \u2026 \u2026\"Mo Ran's black eyes were filled with thunder. He suddenly sat up and grabbed Qiutong's slender neck. He picked up the woman who was touching him with one hand and threw her off the bed.His face changed, becoming a vicious face of a wolf, a tiger, and a leopard.\"What do you mean by the dead can't come back to life? Who's dead?Who's going to come back to life? \"Mo Ran gritted his teeth. \"No one died, no one wants to come back to life, and no one is sad!\"Song Qiutong's lips trembled. She wanted to struggle, but just as she said, \"Red Lotus Pavilion \u2026 \u2026\", Mo Ran's eyes turned red. He was furious.\"There's only one unconscious Chu Wanning in the Red Lotus Pavilion. What are you trying to say!What are you trying to tell me?!Evil creature! \"Song Qiutong saw that Mo Ran had lost control of his anger. Her heart trembled. She did not know what crazy thing he would do if this continued. She threw caution to the wind and raised her voice. \"Your Majesty, the one lying in the Red Lotus Pavilion is a dead person. You spend your days here, so how can I not be worried?\"She said it cleverly. In order to not let Mo Ran blame her, she even said that her selfish desire was out of concern for Mo Ran.Mo Ran stared at her. His breathing gradually stabilized. It seemed that he had more or less listened to her. He no longer shouted at her.After a while, he said, \"I've made you worry.\"Song Qiutong let out a sigh of relief. \"For Your Majesty's good health, I can disregard life and death.Your Majesty is very affectionate, but you shouldn't be so depressed. \"\"Then what do you think I should do?\"\"I said too much for Your Majesty's good.In my opinion, one day Chu \u2026 \u2026 Grandmaster Chu should be buried \u2026 \u2026 He's no longer here. If his body is left empty like this, it will only make Your Majesty feel more pain. \"\"What else?You haven't said everything. Why don't you say it all today? \"Song Qiutong saw that his expression was gradually relaxing. She felt slightly relieved.She lowered her half-closed eyes and slightly tilted her head. She knew that her appearance was most similar to Shi Mingjing's.She firmly believed that Shi Mingjing was Mo Weiyu's weak spot. Although she didn't understand why she couldn't arouse Mo Ran's interest even though she meticulously embellished and imitated Shi Mingjing's appearance.Although this unpredictable man liked her company, ever since they got married, unless he was extremely depressed or drunk, he would never touch her.Song Qiutong felt that perhaps it was because Mo Ran didn't like women that much. In short, it clearly had nothing to do with Shi Mingjing.Not to mention her, the entire Peak of Life and Death knew that the man who died many years ago was the Emperor Ta's true love.What was Chu Wanning?Song Qiutong thought that he was just a plaything that the Emperor Ta used to vent his love. He was a man that the Emperor Ta was tired of using.Although Chu Wanning used his life in exchange for Mo Weiyu's restlessness after his death, she understood that this was just a moment of guilt and a moment of unfamiliarity.She was confident that with a face that was so similar to Shi Mingjing's, the living dead in the Red Lotus Pavilion was no match for her.But Mo Ran couldn't continue like this. Now that the world was in chaos and war was everywhere, she was afraid that she would follow the wrong master. If Mo Ran's power was gone, she was no longer young. She probably wouldn't be able to find a tree that reached the sky that she could cling to.Therefore, she sincerely hoped that Mo Ran would pull himself together and stop being so crazy.So she thought about it and weighed the pros and cons. In the end, she gathered her courage and said, \"After Grandmaster Chu left, no one deserves to go to the Red Lotus Pavilion.\"Mo Ran said, \"That's right.Go on. \"\"I think that since it's like this, Your Majesty will only recall the scenery if you go to the pavilion. Why don't you \u2026\"\"Why don't you?\" Mo Ran narrowed his eyes.\"Why don't we seal the Red Lotus Pavilion?One pavilion for one master, that's a good story. \"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
